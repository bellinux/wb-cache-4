25|$|Galleys were {{introduced}} to the Baltic Sea in the 16th century but the details of their designs are lacking due to the absence of records. They might have been built in a more regional style, but the only known depiction from the time shows a typical Mediterranean vessel. There is conclusive evidence that Denmark became the first Baltic power to build classic Mediterranean-style galleys in the 1660s, though they proved to be generally too large to be useful in the shallow waters of the Baltic archipelagos. Sweden and especially Russia began to launch galleys and various rowed vessels in great numbers during the Great Northern War in the first two decades of the 18th century. Sweden was late in the game when it came to building an effective oared fighting fleet, while the Russian galley forces under Tsar Peter I developed into a <b>supporting</b> <b>arm</b> for the sailing navy and a well-functioning auxiliary of the army which infiltrated and conducted numerous raids on the eastern Swedish coast in the 1710s.|$|E

She was recovering herself, and could see the extreme sweetness and solicitude of his face, and feel that she had never before leant on so kind and tender a <b>supporting</b> <b>arm,</b> since she had sat on her father's knee. 'Ah! sir, you mind me of my blessed father,' she said.|$|E

60|$|Cross it we did, my {{delicate}} companion {{being as}} much sustained by my <b>supporting</b> <b>arm,</b> as {{by her own}} resolution but we found the same obstacle to retreat interposing there also. The island above had turned the waters aside, until they found an outlet under each bank--shooting along their willowy shores, with the velocity of arrows. By this time, owing to our hurried movement, I found Anneke so far exhausted, that it was absolutely necessary to pause a minute to take breath. This pause was also necessary, in order to look about us, and to decide understandingly as to the course it was necessary now to pursue. This pause, brief as it was, moreover, contributed largely to the apparent horrors of our situation.|$|E
60|$|It was {{a bright}} sunshiny morning when Nigel found himself at last able to leave his turret chamber and to walk upon the rampart of the castle. There was a brisk {{northern}} wind, heavy and wet with the salt of the sea, and he felt, as he turned his face to it, fresh life and strength surging in his blood and bracing his limbs. He took his hand from Aylward's <b>supporting</b> <b>arm</b> and stood with his cap off, leaning on the rampart and breathing in the cool strong air. Far off upon the distant sky-line, half hidden by the heave of the waves, was the low white fringe of cliffs which skirted England. Between him and them lay the broad blue Channel, seamed and flecked with flashing foam, for a sharp sea was running and the few ships in sight were laboring heavily. Nigel's eyes traversed the wide-spread view, rejoicing in the change from the gray wall of his cramped chamber. Finally they settled upon a strange object at his very feet.|$|E

And when with much {{difficulty}} he had been lifted {{to the back of}} his cream-colour, who stood as gently and patiently as if he understood the exigency of the moment, he sat upright, and waved his hand as he passed the litter, while Ebbo, on his side, signed to him to speed on and prepare their mother. Long, however, before the castle was reached, dizzy confusion and leaden helplessness, when no longer stimulated by his brother's presence, so grew on him that it was with much ado that Heinz could keep him in his saddle; but, when he saw his mother in the castle gateway, he again collected his forces, bade Heinz withdraw his <b>supporting</b> <b>arm,</b> and, straightening himself, waved a greeting to her, as he called cheerily; [...] "Victory, dear mother. Ebbo has overthrown the count, and you must not be grieved if it be at some cost of blood." ...|$|E

5000|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, under the {{leadership}} of LtCol. James E. Toth, 2nd ANGLICO began experimenting with the concept of the [...] "Universal Spotter", a Marine trained to coordinate and control fires from artillery, naval gunfire, and Close Air Support (CAS); previously the organization of ANGLICO, USMC artillery and infantry units provided separate shore fire control party teams, artillery liaison and tactical air control party teams for the observation and control of <b>supporting</b> <b>arms</b> for both USMC and other forces maneuver units. The experimental concept relied on company level teams known as Firepower Control Teams (FCTs) containing personnel and equipment to control fires for all <b>supporting</b> <b>arms</b> and battalion level groups known as <b>Supporting</b> <b>Arms</b> Liaison Teams (SALTs) responsible for coordination of all <b>supporting</b> <b>arms</b> renabled 2nd ANGLICO to greatly reduce the number personnel required to support US Army and allied units and streamlined the request for and approval of the delivery of terminal control of USMC and USN <b>supporting</b> <b>arms.</b> The Universal Spotter concept was later adopted by all ANGLICOs and was the forerunner of today's Joint Terminal Attack Controller (JTAC) and Joint Fires Observers (JFO).|$|R

60|$|I {{thought the}} {{staircase}} {{would never have}} an end. Round! Yes, they went round and up, and round and up and round and up, until I could not help surmising, with the sagacious Pompey, upon whose <b>supporting</b> <b>arm</b> I leaned in all the confidence of early affection--I could not help surmising that {{the upper end of}} the continuous spiral ladder had been accidentally, or perhaps designedly, removed. I paused for breath; and, in the meantime, an accident occurred of too momentous a nature in a moral, and also in a metaphysical point of view, to be passed over without notice. It appeared to me--indeed I was quite confident of the fact--I could not be mistaken--no! I had, for some moments, carefully and anxiously observed the motions of my Diana--I say that I could not be mistaken--Diana smelt a rat! At once I called Pompey's attention to the subject, and he--he agreed with me. There was then no longer any reasonable room for doubt. The rat had been smelled--and by Diana. Heavens! shall I ever forget the intense excitement of the moment? Alas! what is the boasted intellect of man? The rat!--it was there--that is to say, it was somewhere. Diana smelled the rat. I--I could not! Thus it is said the Prussian Isis has, for some persons, a sweet and very powerful perfume, while to others it is perfectly scentless.|$|E
6000|$|I {{was frightened}} by her vehemence, and {{imagined}} some mistake in her incoherent tale; but I no longer hesitated to obey her. She had come by {{herself from the}} Castle, three long miles, at midnight, through the heavy snow; we must reach Englefield Green, {{a mile and a}} half further, before we could obtain a chaise. She told me, that she had kept up her strength and courage till her arrival at my cottage, and then both failed. Now she could hardly walk. Supporting her as I did, still she lagged: and at the distance of half a mile, after many stoppages, shivering fits, and half faintings, she slipt from my <b>supporting</b> <b>arm</b> on the snow, and with a torrent of tears averred that she must be taken, for that she could not proceed. I lifted her up in my arms; her light form rested on my breast.--I felt no burthen, except the internal one of contrary and contending emotions. Brimming delight now invested me. Again her chill limbs touched me as a torpedo; and I shuddered in sympathy with her pain and fright. Her head lay on my shoulder, her breath waved my hair, her heart beat near mine, transport made me tremble, blinded me, annihilated me--till a suppressed groan, bursting from her lips, the chattering of her teeth, which she strove vainly to subdue, and all the signs of suffering she evinced, recalled me to the necessity of speed and succour. At last I said to her, [...] "There is Englefield Green; there the inn. But, if you are seen thus strangely circumstanced, dear Idris, even now your enemies may learn your flight too soon: were it not better that I hired the chaise alone? I will put you in safety meanwhile, and return to you immediately." ...|$|E
