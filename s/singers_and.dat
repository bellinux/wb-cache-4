5|$|Though {{the major}} record {{companies}} dominate the American music industry, an independent music industry (indie music) does exist.

Indie music may be in styles generally similar to mainstream music, but is often inaccessible, unusual, or otherwise unappealing to many people. Indie musicians often release {{some or all of}} their songs over the Internet for fans and others to download and listen. In addition to recording artists of many kinds, there are numerous fields of professional musicianship in the United States, many of whom rarely record, including community orchestras, wedding <b>singers</b> <b>and</b> bands, lounge <b>singers,</b> <b>and</b> nightclub DJs. The American Federation of Musicians is the largest American labor union for professional musicians. However, only 15% of the Federation's members have steady music employment.|$|E
