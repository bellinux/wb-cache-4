500|$|Chromic acid is a {{powerful}} oxidizing agent and is a useful compound for cleaning laboratory glassware of any trace of organic compounds. It is prepared by dissolving potassium dichromate in concentrated sulfuric acid, which is then used to wash the apparatus. <b>Sodium</b> <b>dichromate</b> is sometimes used because of its higher solubility (50 g/L versus 200 g/L respectively). The use of dichromate cleaning solutions is now phased out due to the high toxicity and environmental concerns. Modern cleaning solutions are highly effective and chromium free.|$|E
500|$|The use {{of water}} as a coolant raised the problem of {{corrosion}} and oxidation of the aluminum tubing. The Metallurgical Laboratory tested various additives to the water to determine their effect. It was found that corrosion was minimized when the water was slightly acidic, so dilute sulfuric acid {{was added to the}} water to give it a pH of 6.5. Other additives such as sodium silicate, <b>sodium</b> <b>dichromate</b> and oxalic acid [...] were also introduced to the water to prevent a build up of film that could inhibit the circulation of the cooling water. The fuel slugs were given a jacket of aluminum to protect the uranium metal from corrosion that would occur if it came into contact with the water, and to prevent the venting of gaseous radioactive fission products that might be formed when they were irradiated. Aluminum was chosen because the cladding had to transmit heat but not absorb too many neutrons. The aluminum canning process was given close attention, as ruptured slugs could jam or damage the channels in the reactor, and the smallest holes could vent radioactive gases. The Metallurgical Laboratory investigated production and testing regimes for the canning process.|$|E

40|$|The {{potential}} of holograms {{has been left}} virtually untapped {{in the field of}} education. A hologram can be described as a three-dimensional photographic record of the interference pattern of two superimposed beams of coherent light.

Setups vary according to whether the recording proc,ss involves a one-beam transmission or a two-beam transmission.

Increase of concentration of nitric acid, treatment time and temperature further ennobles the potential.

50|$|Acidic {{anodizing}} solutions produce pores in the anodized coating. These pores {{can absorb}} dyes and retain lubricants, {{but are also}} an avenue for corrosion. When lubrication properties are not critical, they are usually sealed after dyeing to increase corrosion resistance and dye retention. Long immersion in boiling-hot deionized water or steam is the simplest sealing process, {{although it is not}} completely effective and reduces abrasion resistance by 20%. The oxide is converted into its hydrated form, and the resulting swelling reduces the porosity of the surface. Cold sealing, where the pores are closed by impregnation of a sealant in a room-temperature bath, is more popular due to energy savings. Coatings sealed in this method are not suitable for adhesive bonding. Teflon, nickel acetate, cobalt acetate, and hot <b>sodium</b> or potassium <b>dichromate</b> seals are commonly used. MIL-A-8625 requires sealing for thin coatings (Types I and II) and allows it as an option for thick ones (Type III).|$|R

40|$|If the parenchymal {{cells of}} the liver of the rat, or certain other cells, are stained with a {{modified}} Mallory stain or with iron haematoxylin, the nuclei are stained in two different ways. This effect may be observed after various fixatives. Direct microscopical observation shows that when part of a nucleus is cut away by the microtome-knife, the part of it remaining in the section stains differently from an intact nucleus. The probability of a nucleus being wholly or only partly contained in a section of a particular thickness can be calculated. Counts made in sections of various thicknesses show {{that the proportion of}} nuclei stained in the different ways is consistent with the calculated probability. It is suggested that the nuclear membrane in the fixed state presents a relatively low permeability.

40|$|Antisense {{technology}} is a nucleic acid-based approach capable of down regulating the expression of specific genes. Several antisense drugs have or will shortly gain approval for medical use. Phosphorothioate oligonucleotides (PS oligonucleotides), in {{which one of the}} non-bridging oxygen atoms of the internucleotide phosphodiester linkage is replaced by a sulfur atom {{is one of the most}} extensively used backbone modifications of antisense oligonucleotides. Therefore, they are the focus of this study. Their unique manufacturing routes and bioactivity raises hitherto, unaddressed environmental issues. The manufacture and use of antisense oligonucleotides at industrial scale could result in its unintentional release to waste streams and hence into the environment. This research aims to determine the environmental issues associated with the production lifecycle of an antisense drug and to develop effective treatment processes to degrade/remove antisense drugs from specific manufacturing waste streams. The composition of waste streams generated from each process step of the synthesis was identified and simulated using SuperPro Designer® 6. 0 flow sheets. This study highlighted that large quantities of chemical wastes, most specifically, significant volumes of acetonitrile (2037 L) and toluene (1018 L) are produced during the synthesis of crude 20 -mer PS oligonucleotide at 1. 5 kg scale. It is predominantly during downstream processing, in particular purification, that there is a potential for loss of synthetic nucleic acid material during which it is estimated that upwards of 50 % of synthetic oligonucleotide (750 g) is lost to waste streams. In this study, the main strategies adapted for the degradation and removal of antisense oligonucleotides include physical heat treatment, acidic and basic pH at ambient room temperature and in combination with elevated temperature (Chapter Three), chemical treatment with soft metal ions (silver nitrate) and oxidising agents (iodine, potassium permanganate, potassium <b>dichromate,</b> <b>sodium</b> hypochlorite, peracetic acid, hydrogen peroxide and Virkon®) (Chapter Four) and enzymatic treatment with commercially available nucleases (Chapter Five). Analysis was undertaken both qualitatively and quantitatively using Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis and Ion-Pair Reversed-Phase chromatography. Based upon the concentration of reagents required, treatment duration, economic considerations and potential environmental impacts, six optimum treatments were chosen. These include treatment with low pH (HCl, 0. 5 M) at 40 °C, low pH (H 2 SO 4, 0. 5 M) at 40 °C, iodine (25 mM), potassium dichromate (0. 125 M), nuclease P 1 (5 U/ml) and steam sterilisation for their efficacy in a simulated waste stream environment. Steam sterilisation was ineffective at degrading the PS oligonucleotides in the waste stream solution. Treatment with nuclease P 1 was the most effective treatment process degrading the PS oligonucleotide by 96. 9 %. The next most effective treatment method was low pH with HCl at 40 ºC, low pH with H 2 SO 4 at 40 ºC, acidic potassium dichromate and iodine degrading the PS oligonucleotide in simulated waste stream conditions by 92. 9, 92. 4, 88. 3 and 86. 7 %, respectively. The application of low pH with HCl at 40 ºC or nuclease P 1 presented as the most effective treatment methods of degrading the PS oligonucleotides in the simulated purification waste stream and demonstrated their suitability as the most technically feasible and eco-friendly methods of treatment. These methodologies may potentially be used to treat PS oligonucleotide containing waste streams, rendering them free of active drug product. EP...|$|R
