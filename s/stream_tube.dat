40|$|The {{purpose of}} this chapter is to explain the fimdamental {{principles}} involved in analytically modeling the flow through weirs and flumes, so that the head-discharge relationship and the modular limit of such structures can be determined. The information provided allows flumes of nearly any cross-sectional shape to be calibrated to a reasonable degree of accuracy. Software for making these calculations is presented in Chapter 8. 6. 1 Continuity Equation Figure 6. 1 shows a <b>stream</b> <b>tube</b> that is a flow passage bounded by streamlines. Since there is, by definition, no flow across a streamline, and since we assume that water is incompressible, water must enter the tube through cross-section 1 and exit through cross-section 2 at the same flow rate, measured in volume per unit time. From the assumption of steady flow, {{it follows that the}} shape and position of the <b>stream</b> <b>tube</b> do not change with time. For steady flow, the rate, Q, at which water is flowing across a small section is the product of the average velocity component perpendicular to the section, v, and the area of the section, A.

The implemented model automatically can find the terrain morphological characteristics, e. g. peaks and saddles, and deal with them respecting the stream flow. Using this type of discretization, the model divides the elements in which the water flows in two classes; the cells, that are mixtilinear polygons where the overland flow is modelled as a sheet flow and channels, obtained by the interception {{of two or more}} <b>stream</b> <b>tubes</b> and whenever surface runoff occurs, the surface runoff is channelised.

The surface flow and the subsurface flow across a element are routed according with the mono-dimensional equation of the kinematic wave. The also model considers the spatial variability of the channels geometry with the flow.

40|$|A {{free water}} surface {{finite element model}} was developed. The method was {{implemented}} with the Galerkin approach to solve the Laplace equation in the saturated region. It {{was developed in the}} object oriented Visual C ++ computer language to permit easy update and drawing of the adaptive mesh. For each time step, the new water table position was calculated based on flux across the water table, a Brooks-Corey equation mass balance for the unsaturated region, and an equation that calculates water table position for the saturated region. An equation was developed to calculate a drainage transfer coefficient, alpha, based on percentage of perforated area in the drain tube wall. The drainage transfer coefficient was incorporated into the finite element model as a Fourier boundary condition. To validate the finite element model, its results were compared with the Kirkham equation results for steady state recharge of three subsurface drainage systems. The finite element model was used to calibrate a semi-analytical frozen <b>stream</b> <b>tube</b> model for subsurface drainage of heterogeneous soils. The first step in the calibration procedure is to run the finite element model for steady state recharge and calculate the water table height divided by recharge rate (the <b>stream</b> <b>tube</b> resistance to flow) as a function of distance between drains. Least squares regression is used to fit a polynomial logarithmic equation, called the resistance function, to the <b>stream</b> <b>tube</b> resistance to flow vs. distance from the drain curve.

In conclusion, cytoplasmic <b>streaming</b> in pollen <b>tubes</b> is suggested to be regulated by Ca 2 ÷ through "myosin " inactivation. p OLLEN tubes show active cytoplasmic streaming.
