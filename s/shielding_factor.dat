40|$|Abstract: Magnetic shields in {{the form}} of {{parallel}} sheets were fabricated using second generation high temperature superconducting (2 G HTS) materials. <b>Shielding</b> <b>factor</b> increases with addition of superconducting layers, but does not change with the increase in the interlayer separation. The result is a useful observation because large separation between the layers enhances the cooling efficiency and reduces the pressure drop for the circulation of cryogenic fluid necessary to cool the superconducting shields. Larger interlayer separation also lowers ac losses due to the self-field effects. The results suggest that the slight increase {{in the size of the}} shield due to the larger separation does not have noticeable decrease in <b>shielding</b> <b>factor</b> or the effect is compensated by the more efficient cooling. Measurements of frequency dependence indicate that the <b>shielding</b> <b>factor</b> increases with increasing frequency due to the presence of ferromagnetic substrate and a thin layer of silver on the coated conductor tapes...|$|E
40|$|A superconducting tube {{can be used}} as an {{efficient}} magnetic shield. However, the <b>shielding</b> <b>factor</b> (defined as the ratio between the applied magnetic induction and the magnetic induction measured inside the tube) decreases towards tube extremities because of the field penetration through the open ends of the tube. To improve the performances at tube extremities, the tube should be closed. This can be achieved by using a superconducting vessel or by closing both extremities with a cap. The purpose of the present work is to study experimentally the shielding performances of a Bi 2223 tube closed by a superconducting Bi 2223 cap. The cap is a circular plate with a diameter equal to the outer diameter of the tube and there is no superconducting joint between the cap and the tube. Our interest is to characterize the effect of the cap on the <b>shielding</b> <b>factor</b> distribution along the tube axis when only one extremity of the tube is closed. We also study the effect of the gap size between the cap and the tube in axial configuration. Finally, a tube closed at its both ends is also characterized. All experiments are carried out at 77 K. The tube is subjected to a quasi-static (“DC”) uniform magnetic field. A Hall probe measures the three components of the local magnetic induction along the axis of the tube {{as a function of the}} applied magnetic induction. Results show that the shielding performances in the axial configuration are highly improved at the closed extremity as the cap reduces the penetration through the open end. The <b>shielding</b> <b>factor</b> distribution along the tube axis is affected by the presence of the cap. For an open tube, the <b>shielding</b> <b>factor</b> is maximum near the center and decreases towards both extremities. For the tube closed at one extremity, the <b>shielding</b> <b>factor</b> is maximum at the closed extremity and decreases towards the center. Moreover, the <b>shielding</b> <b>factor</b> distribution between the tube center and the open extremity is not affected by the presence of the cap.

An uninterrupted superconducting path {{is achieved by}} splitting two sections of a slit 2 G tape {{in order to obtain}} a loop without joint. Several loops are stacked together to obtain a coil acting as a magnetic screen. Persistent currents in this coil are shown to shield efficiently magnetic fields that are applied at very low sweep rates (500 @T/s). The shielding properties are characterized by measuring the <b>shielding</b> <b>factor</b> of the screen, i. e. the ratio between the magnetic field with and without screen. In a coil made of a single layer of coated conductors, the <b>shielding</b> <b>factor</b> {{at the center of the}} coil is shown to exceed 10 for an applied DC magnetic flux density of 5 mT.

Both the maximum field amplitude that can be shielded and the <b>shielding</b> <b>factor</b> of the coil can be enhanced by increasing the number of concentric coils.

40|$|The cryoEDM neutron {{electric}} dipole moment experiment requires a SQUID magnetometry system with pick-up loops inside a magnetically shielded volume connected to SQUID sensors by long (up to 2 m) twisted-wire pairs (TWPs). These wires run outside the main shield, and therefore must run through superconducting capillaries to screen unwanted magnetic pick-up. We show that the average measured transverse magnetic pick-up {{of a set of}} lengths of TWPs is equivalent to a loop area of 5. 0 × 10 - 6 m 2 /m, or 14 twists per metre. From this we set the requirement that the magnetic <b>shielding</b> <b>factor</b> of the superconducting capillaries used in the cryoEDM system must be greater than 8. 0 × 104. The <b>shielding</b> <b>factor</b> - the ratio of the signal picked-up by an unshielded TWP to that induced in a shielded TWP - was measured for a selection of superconducting capillaries made from solder wire. We conclude the transverse <b>shielding</b> <b>factor</b> of a uniform capillary is greater than 107. The measured pick-up was equal to, or less than that due to direct coupling to the SQUID sensor (measured without any TWP attached). We show that discontinuities in the capillaries substantially impair the magnetic shielding, yet if suitably repaired, this can be restored to the <b>shielding</b> <b>factor</b> of an unbroken capillary. We have constructed shielding assemblies for cryoEDM made from lengths of single core and triple core solder capillaries, joined by a shielded Pb cylinder, incorporating a heater to heat the wires above the superconducting transition as required. © 2014 Elsevier B.

40|$|Effective {{magnetic}} shielding from DC to power frequencies is of growing importance in many applications. Electrical steel {{is often used}} as a shielding material since it offers a cost effective solution over this frequency range. There is no standard or commonly accepted approach to measuring the shielding capabilities of different grades of sheet materials or accurately assessing their effectiveness in practical applications. This paper briefly reviews recent experimental approaches to measuring the <b>shielding</b> <b>factors</b> of electrical steels. Research results obtained from one type of simple test system are presented to show the dependence of the <b>shielding</b> <b>factors</b> of electrical steel panels on thickness and relative permeability. Multiple-layer shielding is often advocated and its effectiveness, {{in the case of}} grain oriented steel, is demonstrated. Depending on the application, the selection of shielding material based on typical B-H curves presented by manufacturers can be misleading so a clearer understanding of specific material properties which control the shielding effectiveness is needed. The standardized method for evaluation of shielding effectiveness used for small formed shields is not suitable for the evaluation of sheet materials. Some suggestions are presented on the approach to a standardized method of measurement of the shielding effectiveness of sheet materials...|$|R

The derivation of all additional correction <b>factor</b> for skyline <b>shielding</b> for large areas is still problematic. One important issue that has yet to he addressed is the effect of the accuracy and resolution of terrain representation by a digital elevation model (DEM) on topographic <b>shielding</b> collection <b>factors.</b> Topographic metrics scale with the resolution of the elevalion data, and terrain smoothing has a potentially large effect on the correction of terrestrial cosmogenic nuclide production rates for skyline shielding.

Here we demonstrate the effect of terrain smoothing on topographic <b>shielding</b> correction <b>factors</b> for various topographic settings, and introduce an empirical model for the estimation of topographic <b>shielding</b> <b>factors</b> based on landscape metrics.

40|$|We have {{experimentally}} {{studied the}} magnetic shielding properties of a cylindrical shell of BiPbSrCaCuO subjected to low frequency AC axial magnetic fields. The magnetic {{response has been}} investigated {{as a function of}} the dimensions of the tube, the magnitude of the applied field and the frequency. These results are explained quantitatively by employing the method of Brandt (1998 Phys. Rev. B 58 6506) with a Jc(B) law appropriate for a polycrystalline material. Specifically, we observe that the applied field can sweep into the central region either through the thickness of the shield or through the opening ends, the latter mechanism being suppressed for long tubes. For the first time, we systematically detail the spatial variation of the <b>shielding</b> <b>factor</b> (the ratio of the applied field over the internal magnetic field) along the axis of a high-temperature superconducting tube. The <b>shielding</b> <b>factor</b> is shown to be constant in a region around the centre of the tube, and to decrease as an exponential in the vicinity of the ends.
