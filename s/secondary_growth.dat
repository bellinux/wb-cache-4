40|$|International audienceThe optimal {{growth of}} {{perturbations}} to transiently growing streaks is studied in Poiseuille flow. Basic flows are generated by {{direct numerical simulation}} giving "primary" optimal spanwise periodic vortices of finite amplitude as the initial condition. They evolve into finite amplitude primary transiently growing streaks. Linear "secondary" optimal energy growth supported by these primary flows are computed using an adjoint technique which takes into full account the unsteadiness of the basic flows. Qualitative differences between primary and <b>secondary</b> optimal <b>growths</b> are found only when the primary streaks are locally unstable. For locally stable primary streaks, the <b>secondary</b> optimal <b>growth</b> has the same scalings with Reynolds number R as the primary optimal growth and the maximum growth is attained by streamwise uniform vortices, suggesting that the primary and <b>secondary</b> optimal <b>growth</b> {{are based on the}} same physical mechanisms.

5|$|In botany, a tree is a {{perennial}} plant with an elongated stem, or trunk, supporting branches and leaves in most species. In some usages, {{the definition of}} a tree may be narrower, including only woody plants with <b>secondary</b> <b>growth,</b> plants that are usable as lumber or plants above a specified height. Trees are not a taxonomic group but include a variety of plant species that have independently evolved a woody trunk and branches as a way to tower above other plants to compete for sunlight. Trees tend to be long-lived, some reaching several thousand years old. In looser definitions, the taller palms, tree ferns, bananas and bamboos are also trees. Trees have been in existence for 370 million years. It is estimated that there are just over 3 trillion mature trees in the world.|$|E
5|$|Overall, {{woodpeckers}} are arboreal {{birds of}} wooded habitats. They reach their greatest diversity in tropical rainforests, but occur {{in almost all}} suitable habitats including woodlands, savannahs, scrublands, and bamboo forests. Even grasslands and deserts have been colonised by various species. These habitats are more easily occupied where {{a small number of}} trees exist, or, in the case of desert species like the Gila woodpecker, tall cacti are available for nesting. Some are specialists and are associated with coniferous or deciduous woodland or even, like the acorn woodpecker, with individual tree genera (oaks in this case). Other species are generalists and are able to adapt to forest clearance by exploiting <b>secondary</b> <b>growth,</b> plantations, orchards and parks. In general, forest-dwelling species need rotting or dead wood on which to forage.|$|E
5|$|Stems mainly {{provide support}} to the leaves and {{reproductive}} structures, but can store water in succulent plants such as cacti, food as in potato tubers, or reproduce vegetatively as in the stolons of strawberry plants or {{in the process of}} layering. Leaves gather sunlight and carry out photosynthesis. Large, flat, flexible, green leaves are called foliage leaves. Gymnosperms, such as conifers, cycads, Ginkgo, and gnetophytes are seed-producing plants with open seeds. Angiosperms are seed-producing plants that produce flowers and have enclosed seeds. Woody plants, such as azaleas and oaks, undergo a <b>secondary</b> <b>growth</b> phase resulting in two additional types of tissues: wood (secondary xylem) and bark (secondary phloem and cork). All gymnosperms and many angiosperms are woody plants. Some plants reproduce sexually, some asexually, and some via both means.|$|E

50|$|The {{vascular}} cambium (also called main cambium, wood cambium, bifacial cambium; plural cambia) is a plant tissue located between the xylem and the phloem in the stems and roots of vascular plants. It is a cylinder of unspecialized meristem cells that divide to form secondary vascular tissues. It {{is the source}} of both <b>secondary</b> xylem <b>growth</b> inwards towards the pith, and <b>secondary</b> phloem <b>growth</b> outwards to the bark.

5|$|The terrain {{over which}} the two brigades were to advance was {{generally}} steep with the track having been cut along a high spur line that dropped on either side into deep ravines that were covered by kunai grass interspersed with areas of thick jungle. North of Bonga, the ground was markedly different, with the track having been pushed through flat swamp land that was punctuated by many deep creeks; vegetation in the area was mainly thick <b>secondary</b> <b>growth,</b> although to the west, in the steep hills, kunai grass was predominate. As {{a result of the}} harsh conditions and terrain, as the Australian advance continued it was increasingly hampered by vehicle break downs and fatigue amongst their crews. Resupply was also a problem for the Australians and consequently a lack of spare parts developed. This meant that a number of jeeps became unserviceable and some of the Matilda tanks were unable to advance for some time while their crews waited for parts to be brought up.|$|E
25|$|<b>Secondary</b> <b>growth</b> {{encompasses}} all {{growth in}} diameter, {{a major component}} of woody plant tissues and many nonwoody plants. For example, storage roots of sweet potato have <b>secondary</b> <b>growth</b> but are not woody. <b>Secondary</b> <b>growth</b> occurs at the lateral meristems, namely the vascular cambium and cork cambium. The former forms secondary xylem and secondary phloem, while the latter forms the periderm.|$|E
25|$|Vascular bundles {{are present}} {{throughout}} the monocot stem, although concentrated towards the outside.

Monocots rarely produce <b>secondary</b> <b>growth</b> and are therefore seldom woody, with Palms and Bamboo being notable exceptions.

40|$|The obvious {{importance}} of metastatic spread in determining clinical outcome in cancer patients has fuelled {{efforts to increase}} understanding of the pathobiology of this process {{in the hope that}} better understanding eventually can be translated into improved therapy. Considerable impetus was given to the experimental analysis of the mechanisms underlying tumour dissemination by the demonstration that populations of metastatic and non-metastatic cells could pre-exist within the same parental tumour (Fidler & Kripke, 1977). Selection during the complex, sequential events of cancer spread might ensure that the cellular composition of secondary tumours differed from that of primary tumours (Poste & Fidler, 1980). The opportunity was thus provided to define those characteristics of importance in regulating metastatic spread by comparing primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>growths</b> or by comparing variant lines differing only in their malignant behaviour (Hart et al., 1989). However, recent results with genetically tagged cells have shown that, in certain tumour types, overgrowth of the primary tumour with metastatic cell populations can be a particularly rapid event (Kerbel et al., 1988). Therefore, the identification of differences between local and distant growths may not be feasible in all instances. Nonetheless recent efforts to identify and isolate specific genes controlling metastatic behaviour often have utilised material derived from primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>growths.</b> Alternatively closely related variant lines with different metastatic potential frequently have provided the starting material used in these studies. These recent approaches to the direct identification and isolation of genes determining the metastatic phenotype form the subjects of this review. Transfection studies Conversion of non-metastatic tumour cells to the fully metastatic phenotype has been achieved in a number of experimental tumour systems by the relatively simple expedient of transfecting the benign population with an activated oncogene, generally of the ras family (e. g.

5|$|When {{grown in}} {{favorable}} conditions of high water availability and humidity, the fruit body can proliferate by growing additional (secondary) fruit bodies on {{all parts of}} its upper and lower surfaces. These <b>secondary</b> <b>growths</b> typically number between four and seven; some may be aborted as the nutrients from the pine cone substrate are depleted, resulting in stems lacking caps. In one instance, a complete secondary proliferation was noted (i.e., growing from a primary proliferation) that developed completely so as to produce viable spores. Humidity is a limiting factor for optimum fruit body development. Removal of incompletely mature laboratory-grown specimens from a relative humidity (R.H.) of over 98% to one of 65–75% causes the fruit bodies to brown and stop growing. When transferred to an even lower R.H. of about 50%, the stems quickly begin to collapse. Light also affects fruit body development: both continuous illumination and complete darkness inhibit growth.|$|R

25|$|Most monocots {{are unable}} to thicken their stems once they have formed, since they lack the {{cylindrical}} meristem present in other angiosperm groups.
