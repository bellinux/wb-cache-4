5|$|The Dresden meeting {{revealed}} that Austria's influence in Europe had reached its lowest point, and Metternich was now bent on re-establishing that influence by using {{what he considered}} strong ties with all sides in the war, proposing general peace talks headed by Austria. Over the next three months, he would slowly distance Austria from the French cause, while avoiding alliance with either Prussia or Russia, and remaining open to any proposal that would secure {{a place for the}} combined Bonaparte-Habsburg dynasty. This was driven by concern that if Napoleon were defeated, Russia and Prussia would <b>stand</b> <b>to</b> <b>gain</b> too much. Napoleon was intransigent, however, and the fighting (now officially the War of the Sixth Coalition) continued. Austria's alliance with France ended in February 1813, and Austria then moved to a position of armed neutrality.|$|E
25|$|Government, as the {{ultimate}} wielder of force is legally the final authority on planning but in practice the process involves {{both public and private}} elements. The legal principle of eminent domain is used by government to divest citizens of their property in cases where its use is required for a project. Planning often involves tradeoffs—decisions in which some <b>stand</b> <b>to</b> <b>gain</b> and some to lose—and thus is closely connected to the prevailing political situation.|$|E
25|$|Socrates gets Hippias {{to agree}} that the more a man knows about a subject, the better {{position}} he will be in to lie about it. He argues that the man who knows the subjects about which he tells lies, whether arithmetic, geometry, or astronomy, is twice as powerful as the man who does not know his subjects. Socrates never indicates what a man might <b>stand</b> <b>to</b> <b>gain</b> from lying about such matters, but brings the conversation back around to Achilles, and what kind of man Homer intended to portray.|$|E

25|$|Thirdly, covetousness is {{the third}} worldly evil, which {{is also known as}} lust. Colet calls this a plague that has {{overtaken}} many priests and blinded many. Many take part in the Church only for the hope of riches and promotions. Priests forget that they should be interested in the good they can do more than the amount of riches that they <b>stand</b> <b>to</b> <b>gain.</b> Paul called covetousness the root of all evils. From it, benefices stack up, including pensions and tithes. Colet states that: “every corruption, all the ruin of the Church, all the scandals of the world, come from the covetousness of priests”.|$|E
500|$|Cult {{films are}} often {{approached}} {{in terms of}} auteur theory, which states that the director's creative vision drives a film. [...] This has fallen out of favor in academia, creating a disconnect between cult film fans and critics. [...] Matt Hills states that auteur theory can help to create cult films; fans that see a film as continuing a director's creative vision are likely to accept it as cult. [...] According to academic Greg Taylor, auteur theory also helped to popularize cult films when middlebrow audiences found an accessible way to approach avant-garde film criticism. [...] Auteur theory provided an alternative culture for cult film fans while carrying the weight of scholarship. [...] By requiring repeated viewings and extensive knowledge of details, auteur theory naturally appealed to cult film fans. [...] Taylor further states that this was instrumental in allowing cult films to break through to the mainstream. [...] Academic Joe Tompkins states that this auteurism is often highlighted when mainstream success occurs. [...] This may {{take the place of}} – and even ignore – political readings of the director. [...] Cult films and directors may be celebrated for their transgressive content, daring, and independence, but Tompkins argues that mainstream recognition requires they be palatable to corporate interests who <b>stand</b> <b>to</b> <b>gain</b> much from the mainstreaming of cult film culture. [...] While critics may champion revolutionary aspects of filmmaking and political interpretation, Hollywood studios and other corporate interests will instead highlight only the aspects that they wish to legitimize in their own films, such as sensational exploitation. [...] Someone like George Romero, whose films are both transgressive and subversive, will have the transgressive aspects highlighted while the subversive aspects are ignored.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{issue that}} can lead {{researchers}} not to take part is whether the researcher would <b>stand</b> <b>to</b> <b>gain</b> any benefit from {{taking part in the}} experiment. [...] It is an ethical principle that volunteers must <b>stand</b> <b>to</b> <b>gain</b> some benefit from the research, even if that is only a remote future possibility of treatment being found for a disease that they only have a small chance of contracting. [...] Tests on experimental drugs are sometimes conducted on sufferers of an untreatable condition. [...] If the researcher does not have that condition then there can be no possible benefit to them personally. [...] For instance, Ronald C. Desrosiers in responding to why he did not test an AIDS vaccine he was developing on himself said that he was not at risk of AIDS so could not possibly benefit. [...] Against that, the early stages of testing a new drug are usually focused merely on the safety of the substance, rather than any benefits it may have. [...] Healthy individuals are required for this stage, not volunteers suffering from the target condition, so if the researcher is healthy, he or she is a potential candidate for testing. [...] An issue peculiar to AIDS vaccine research is that the test will leave HIV antibodies in the volunteers blood, causing the person to show HIV positive when tested even if they have never been in contact with an HIV carrier. [...] This could cause a number of social problems for the volunteers (including any self-testers) such as issues with life insurance.|$|E
2500|$|FairTax advocates {{state that}} total philanthropy as a {{percentage}} of GDP has held steady at around 2% for at least two decades, regardless of changes in income tax deductibility. According to the National Bureau of Economic Research, GDP would increase almost 10.5% in the first year after the FairTax goes into effect. FairTax advocates claim this economic boost, along with an estimated 8% real wage increase, would strengthen charitable giving. [...] In a 2007 study, the Beacon Hill Institute concluded that total charitable giving would increase under the FairTax, although increases in giving would not be distributed proportionately amongst the various types of charitable organizations. [...] "Due to differences in preferences for type of charitable organizations between itemizers and non-itemizers, religious charities <b>stand</b> <b>to</b> <b>gain</b> disproportionately under the FairTax, while education, health, and cultural charities will actually suffer a small loss." ...|$|E
2500|$|Startup founders {{often have}} a more casual or offbeat {{attitude}} in their dress, office space and marketing, as compared to traditional corporations. For example, startup founders in the 2010s may wear hoodies, sneakers and other casual clothes to business meetings. Their offices may have recreational facilities in them, such as pool tables, ping pong tables and pinball machines, which are {{used to create a}} fun work environment, stimulate team development and team spirit, and encourage creativity. Some of the casual approaches, {{such as the use of}} [...] "flat" [...] organizational structures, in which regular employees can talk with the founders and chief executive officers informally, are done to promote efficiency in the workplace, which is needed to get their business off the ground. In a 1960 study, Douglas McGregor stressed that punishments and rewards for uniformity in the workplace are not necessary because some people are born with the motivation to work without incentives. Some startups do not use a strict command and control hierarchical structure, with executives, managers, supervisors and employees. Some startups offer employees stock options, to increase their [...] "buy in" [...] from the start up (as these employees <b>stand</b> <b>to</b> <b>gain</b> if the company does well). This removal of stressors allows the workers and researchers in the startup to focus less on the work environment around them, and more on achieving the task at hand, giving them the potential to achieve something great for their company.|$|E

2500|$|Committed, by the 1920s, to {{a highly}} {{personalized}} pacifist socialism, Aderca veered toward the far-left of politics: in Idei și oameni, he chided Romanian reformism, moderate Marxism as personified by Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea and the Second International. He decried the exploitation of workers and luxuries such as the casinos of Sinaia. Nonetheless, Crohmălniceanu, a Marxist, noted that Moartea unei republici roșii told little about how [...] "a new society is to be organized". Aderca favored [...] "a nonconformism of a mostly moral and aesthetic kind", where sexual freedom, creative liberty and the celebration Aderca approved of class conflict, with Marxism as a legitimiate tool of the masses: [...] "war is a creation of masters fighting each other for dominance. [...] What can the impoverished people {{have in common with}} the polite master? The French worker, what does he <b>stand</b> <b>to</b> <b>gain</b> from this war, other than a more thorough understanding of Marxism?" [...] Aderca's leftist leanings were incompatible with the neoliberalism of his mentor Eugen Lovinescu, something acknowledged by Aderca in his Mic tratat years. In Mărturia unei generații, Aderca challenged Lovinescu to answer on the subject. Lovinescu did so, noting that Sburătoruls celebration of individualism outweighed the neoliberal stance of its leader. In Aderca's work, socialism was doubled by a sarcastic view of traditional authority. Police officers opened a file on him when, in 1927, he mocked King Ferdinand I as a standard of barber shop posters. According to Dumitru Hîncu, although the comment irritated state security, it was not truly [...] "an attack on State institutions or its leaders".|$|E

6000|$|But here, perhaps, {{before the}} finish, since the {{business}} of this book is explanation, it may be well to define a little the relation of Socialism to the political party that is most closely identified {{with it in the}} popular mind. This is the Labour Party. There can be no doubt of the practical association of aim and interest of the various Labour parties throughout modern civilized communities with the Socialist movement. The Social democrats of Germany are the Labour Party of that country, and wherever the old conception of Socialism prevails, those [...] "class war" [...] ideas of the Marxist that have been superseded in English Socialism for nearly a quarter of a century, there essentially the Socialist movement will {{take the form of a}} revolutionary attack upon the owning and governing sections of the community. But in Great Britain and America the Labour movement has never as a whole been revolutionary or insurrectionary in spirit, and in these countries Socialism has been affected from its very beginnings by constructive ideas. It has never starkly antagonized Labour on the one hand, and the other necessary elements in a civilized State on the other; it has never--I speak of the movement as a whole and not of individual utterances--contemplated a community made up wholly of [...] "Labour" [...] and emotionally democratic, such as the Marxist teaching suggests. The present labouring classes <b>stand</b> <b>to</b> <b>gain</b> enormously in education, dignity, leisure, efficiency and opportunity by the development of a Socialist State, and just in so far as they become intelligent will they become Socialist; but we all, all of us of Good Will, we and our children, of nearly every section of the community stand also to gain and have also our interest in this development. Great as the Labour movement is, the Socialist movement remains something greater. The one is the movement of a class, the other a movement of the best elements in every class.|$|E
