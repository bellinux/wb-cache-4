5|$|Critics have {{positively}} received <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> {{within the}} collection, analyzing Anarky {{as a unique}} force for political commentary and discussion within DC Comics' storytelling. However, the expansive growth of the character's unique abilities and characterization has also fueled criticism as having overpowered the character beyond suspension of disbelief.|$|E
5|$|Following the battle, Santa Anna was {{alternately}} {{viewed as}} a national hero or a pariah. Mexican perceptions of the battle often mirrored the prevailing viewpoint. Santa Anna had been disgraced following his capture at the Battle of San Jacinto, and many Mexican accounts of the battle were written by men who had been, or had become, his outspoken critics. Petite and many other historians believe that <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stories,</b> such as the execution of Crockett, may have been invented to further discredit Santa Anna. In Mexican history, the Texas campaign, including the Battle of the Alamo, was soon overshadowed by the Mexican–American War of 1846–48.|$|E

In 1999, when he was 105 years old, the Mississippi Legislature adopted a resolution recognizing him as an outstanding citizen of Mississippi. At the time, {{he was known as}} the oldest living World War I veteran, as Emiliano Mercado del Toro had not yet been discovered. He was interviewed by Treehouse Productions in 2006 as part of their Living History Project, a radio tribute to the last surviving World War I veterans that was hosted by Walter Cronkite. Though he could not speak coherently, his son Haywood Hardy, himself 80 years old at the time, recalled <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> that his father had told him.|$|E

25|$|The Short Fiction of Norman Mailer is a 1967 {{anthology}} {{of short stories}} by Norman Mailer. It is grouped into eight thematic sections and contains nineteen stories which all appeared in one of Mailer's miscellanies; thirteen were published in periodicals or other anthologies before appearing in this collection.

25|$|Richelieu forms a four-way alliance, the League of Ostend, {{to oppose}} the New United States, Gustavus' expeditionary army, and allied princes of the German states. After the first book, the series begins {{multiple}} plot lines or story threads reflecting this independence of action by a multitude of characters. The sequel 1633 spreads the Americans out geographically over Central Europe. Next, the novel , and {{the first of the}} anthologies called the Grantville Gazettes introduced new strong characters. The former begins what is called the South European thread, and <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> in the latter and Ring of Fire began the Eastern European thread (Austria-Hungary northwards to Poland).|$|E
25|$|The sudden {{spread of}} the rumours {{in the spring of}} 1915, six months after the events and Machen's story was {{published}}, is also puzzling. The stories published then often attribute their sources to anonymous British officers. The latest and most detailed examination of the Mons story by David Clarke suggests these men may have been part of a covert attempt by military intelligence to spread morale-boosting propaganda and disinformation. As {{it was a time of}} allied problems with the Lusitania sinking, Zeppelin attacks and failure to achieve a breakthrough on the Western Front, the timing would make military sense. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> conveniently claimed that sources could not be revealed for security reasons.|$|E

50|$|The film reunited Elizabeth Taylor with co-star Laurence Harvey {{from their}} 1960 {{collaboration}} Butterfield 8.

25|$|As a {{means of}} {{understanding}} the world through speculation and storytelling, science fiction has antecedents which go back to an era when the dividing line separating the mythological from the historical tended to become somewhat blurred. True History, written in the 2nd century AD by the Hellenized Syrian satirist Lucian, contains many themes and tropes that are characteristic of modern science fiction, including travel to other worlds, extraterrestrial lifeforms, interplanetary warfare, and artificial life, and is considered {{by some to be}} the first science fiction novel. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> from The Arabian Nights, along with the 10th century The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter and Ibn al-Nafis's 13th century Theologus Autodidactus also contain elements of science fiction.|$|E
25|$|Famously, Anthony {{is said to}} {{have faced}} a series of supernatural temptations during his pilgrimage to the desert. The first to report on the temptation was his {{contemporary}} Athanasius of Alexandria. It is possible these events, like the paintings, are full of rich metaphor {{or in the case of}} the animals of the desert, perhaps a vision or dream. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> included in Saint Anthony's biography are perpetuated now mostly in paintings, where they give an opportunity for artists to depict their more lurid or bizarre interpretations. Many artists, including Martin Schongauer, Hieronymus Bosch, Dorothea Tanning, Max Ernst, Leonora Carrington and Salvador Dalí, have depicted these incidents from the life of Anthony; in prose, the tale was retold and embellished by Gustave Flaubert in The Temptation of Saint Anthony.|$|E
25|$|The {{evidence}} of the early texts suggests that he was born as Siddhārtha Gautama in Lumbini {{and grew up in}} Kapilavasthu, a town in the plains region of the modern Nepal-India border, and that he spent his life in what is now modern Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. Some hagiographic legends state that his father was a king named Suddhodana, his mother was queen Maya, and he was born in Lumbini gardens. However, scholars such as Richard Gombrich consider this a dubious claim because a combination of evidence suggests he was born in the Shakyas community – one that later gave him the title Shakyamuni, and the Shakya community was governed by a small oligarchy or republic-like council where there were no ranks but where seniority mattered instead. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> about Buddha, his life, his teachings, and claims about the society he grew up in may have been invented and interpolated at a later time into the Buddhist texts.|$|E
50|$|Both the anime and manga {{have been}} {{released}} in France; the anime, slightly edited and censored to tone down <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>story's</b> more erotic elements, aired on TF1 in 1989, and the first six volumes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> manga reached the French market in the late 1990s.|$|R
5000|$|Payne {{also played}} Bukowski's {{literary}} alter-ego, Henry Chinaski, a character <b>of</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> adaptations, which {{were more like}} vignettes.

25|$|The hagiographic details is {{a subject}} of dispute, with modern {{scholarship}} questioning the details and authenticity of many claims. For example, Callewaert and Snell state that early Sikh texts do not contain these stories, and after these travel stories first appear in hagiographic accounts of Guru Nanak centuries after his death, they continue to become more sophisticated over time, with the late phase Puratan version describing four missionary journeys (udasis), which however differs from the Miharban version. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> about Guru Nanak's extensive travels first appear in the 19th-century versions of janam-sakhi in the Puratan version. Further, stories about Guru Nanak's travel to Baghdad is absent from even the early 19th-century Puratan version. These embellishments and insertion of new stories, according to Callewaert and Snell, closely parallel claims of miracles by Islamic pirs found in Sufi tazkiras of the same era, and these legends may have been written in a competition.|$|E

500|$|<b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> Tolkien wrote as elven {{history have}} been seen to be {{directly}} influenced by Celtic mythology. [...] For example, [...] "Flight of The Noldoli" [...] {{is based on the}} Tuatha Dé Danann and Lebor Gabála Érenn, and their migratory nature comes from early Irish/Celtic history. [...] John Garth also sees that with the underground enslavement of the Noldoli to Melkor, Tolkien was essentially rewriting Irish myth regarding the Tuatha Dé Danann into a Christian eschatology.|$|E
