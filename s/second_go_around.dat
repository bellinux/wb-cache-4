40|$|This {{research}} {{examines the}} effects of terror management theory (TMT) and athletic performance. TMT states that humans defend themselves against the anxiety stemming from death awareness (mortality salience; MS) by investing in cultural worldviews, which often results in identification with similar others as well as harsh denigration of anyone with opposing views. I sought to investigate whether participant’s athletic performance {{would be affected by}} mortality salience. Participants included varsity lacrosse players, varsity women soccer players, men soccer players, and a mixed population of undergraduate students. Each participant was asked to complete as many push-ups as they could and then asked to complete a self-esteem survey. They were then exposed to the mortality salience or control and then asked to repeat the push-up test. The goal was to determine if the participants exposed to the MS had a greater number of completed push-ups the <b>second</b> <b>go</b> <b>around...</b>|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Education, Washington State UniversityThis {{purpose of}} this action {{research}} study was to improve communication pathways and feedback loops used by one school district {{in its attempt to}} create a common use of time in high schools to maximize resources and improve student learning. Part of this study's intent was to solicit and protect the voices of institutional entrepreneurs in their efforts to challenge the traditional modes of doing business. In doing so, it was anticipated that our high schools would be better situated to respond to the adaptive challenges with which they are faced today. 	A major outcome of the study was {{a better understanding of the}} necessity for inclusion of stakeholders on the frontend of a change initiative. Resistance, while substantial during the first change attempt, was much more muted the <b>second</b> <b>go</b> <b>around.</b> Secondly, this study confirmed that being part of the same financial system tied to the state plays a role in the isomorphic nature of organizations as evidenced by the eventual directive by the superintendent for one school to change to become more like other schools in the district.
