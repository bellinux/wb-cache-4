5|$|The {{competition}} between orientation produced by surface anchoring and by electric field effects is often exploited in liquid crystal devices. Consider {{the case in}} which liquid crystal molecules are aligned parallel {{to the surface and}} an electric field is applied perpendicular to the cell. At first, as the electric field increases in magnitude, no change in alignment occurs. However at a threshold magnitude of electric field, deformation occurs. Deformation occurs where the director changes its orientation from one molecule to the next. The occurrence of such a change from an aligned to a deformed state is called a Fredericks transition and can also be produced by the application of a magnetic field of <b>sufficient</b> <b>strength.</b>|$|E

However, due to the perceived unsuitability of the Churchill and the late arrival of the new platform, the regiment was not deployed as part of Australia's commitment to the Korean War, although a number of officers served on exchange with British and US formations and the unit provided machine-gunners and signallers to Australian infantry battalions as reinforcements.

5|$|The {{controversial}} 1905 {{partition of}} Bengal had a widespread political impact. Acting as a stimulus for radical nationalist opinion in India and abroad, {{it became a}} focal issue for Indian revolutionaries. Revolutionary organisations like Jugantar and Anushilan Samiti had emerged in the 20th century. Several significant events took place. These included assassinations and attempted assassinations of civil servants, prominent public figures and Indian informants, including one in 1907 aiming to kill the Bengal Lieutenant-Governor Sir Andrew Fraser. Matters {{came to a head}} when the 1912 Delhi–Lahore Conspiracy, led by erstwhile Jugantar member Rash Behari Bose, attempted to assassinate the then Viceroy of India, Charles Hardinge. In the aftermath of this event, the British Indian police made concentrated police and intelligence efforts to destroy the Bengali and Punjabi revolutionary underground. Though the movement came under intense pressure for some time, Rash Behari successfully evaded capture for nearly three years. By the time World War I had begun in Europe in 1914, the revolutionary movement had revived in Punjab and Bengal. In Bengal the movement, with a safe haven in the French base of Chandernagore, had <b>sufficient</b> <b>strength</b> to all but paralyse the state administration. The earliest mention of a conspiracy for armed revolution in India appears in Nixon's Report on Revolutionary Organisation, which reported that Jatin Mukherjee (Bagha Jatin) and Naren Bhattacharya had met the Crown Prince of Germany during the latter's visit to Calcutta in 1912, and obtained an assurance that they would receive supplies of arms and ammunition. At the same time an increasingly strong pan-Islamic movement started developing, mainly in the north and north-west regions of India. With the onset of the war in 1914, the members of this movement formed {{an important component of the}} conspiracy.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{study the}} {{structure}} of clusters in a model colloidal system with competing interactions using Brownian dynamics simulations. A short-ranged attraction drives clustering, while a weak, long-ranged repulsion is used to model electrostatic charging in experimental systems. The former is treated with a shortranged Morse attractive interaction, the latter with a repulsive Yukawa interaction. We consider the yield of clusters of specific structure {{as a function of}} the strength of the interactions, for clusters with m = 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10 and 13 colloids. At <b>sufficient</b> <b>strengths</b> of the attractive interaction (around 10 kBT), the average bond lifetime approaches the simulation timescale and the system becomes nonergodic. For small clusters m � 5 where geometric frustration is not relevant, despite nonergodicity, for <b>sufficient</b> <b>strengths</b> of the attractive interaction the yield of clusters which maximise the number of bonds approaches 100 %. However for m = 7 and higher, in the nonergodic regime we find a lower yield of these structures where we argue geometric frustration plays a significant role. m = 6 is a special case, where two structures, of octahedral and C 2 v symmetry compete, with the latter being favoured by entropic contributions in the ergodic regime and by kinetic trapping in the nonergodic regime. We believe that our results should be valid as far as the one-component description of the interaction potential is valid. A system with competing electrostatic repulsions and van der Waals attractions may be such an example. However, in some cases, the one-component description of the interaction potential may not be appropriate. PACS numbers: 82. 70. Dd; 82. 70. Gg; 64. 75. +g; 64. 60. My 1...|$|R
