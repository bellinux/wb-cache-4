25|$|A turtle <b>excluder</b> <b>device</b> is a {{specialized}} device {{that allows a}} captured sea turtle to escape when caught in a fisherman's net. They are used to catch sea turtles when bottom trawling {{is used by the}} commercial shrimp fishing industry. The first turtle <b>excluder</b> <b>device</b> was called the Georgia Jumper.

40|$|The W. L. Gore <b>Excluder</b> {{bifurcated}} <b>device</b> uses a single-action {{deployment mechanism}} with an expanded polytetrafluoroethylene string that is stitched to an outer jacket constraining the nitinol self-expanding stent-graft. Under certain anatomic {{conditions of the}} proximal neck, the deployment angle of the proximal stent-graft {{can be difficult to}} predict and result in the device being seated caudal to the intended landing site just below the lowermost renal artery. This article describes a technique of controlled deployment of the <b>Excluder</b> <b>device</b> where the top of the main bifurcated device is “flowered” by slowly pulling the deployment string while being buttressed by an introducer sheath to prevent premature deployment and allow longitudinal positioning of the device. This technique could be used when a more gradual deployment of the <b>Excluder</b> <b>device</b> is desired in angulated or short proximal necks...|$|R

Recently, a new delivery system modification has been applied to the <b>Excluder</b> <b>device</b> which allows repositioning of the stent-graft to adjust for accurate proximal landing and facilitate gate cannulation. In this review, we examine the <b>Excluder</b> <b>device</b> with the new C 3 delivery system and its potential benefit in the management of abdominal aortic aneurysms.

40|$|Growing {{evidence}} suggests that graft porosity hampers aneurysm shrinkage in patients who have been treated with the original <b>Excluder</b> <b>device.</b> To our knowledge, this suspected porosity has never been visualized in such patients. We present three patients treated with the original <b>Excluder</b> <b>device</b> whose aneurysms did not shrink in the first 2 years after treatment. Computed tomography (CT) angiography and late phase CT did not show endoleak. We performed late phase magnetic resonance imaging with a blood pool agent to visualize graft porosity. Our cases illustrate the usability of a new contrast agent and a new imaging strategy for visualizing slow-flow endoleaks {{that can not be}} imaged using currently used imaging techniques with conventional contrast agents. status: publishe...|$|R
50|$|However, some {{relatively}} inexpensive changes to fishing techniques, such as slightly larger hooks and traps from which sea turtles can escape, can dramatically cut the mortality rate. Turtle <b>Excluder</b> <b>Devices</b> (TEDs) have reduced sea turtle bycatch in shrimp nets by 97 percent.|$|R

50|$|Ocean Conservancy’s {{effort for}} sea turtles, which {{resulted}} in the requirement for turtle <b>excluder</b> <b>devices</b> (TEDs) in shrimp trawl gear, saves thousands of turtles each year.

5000|$|The Mammals and Birds <b>Excluder</b> <b>Device</b> (MBED) {{consists}} in a modification {{to the traditional}} Spanish bottom longline used in the fishery of Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides). Several configurations are in use depending on the country, and fishermen. The first descriptions were issued in Chile and Uruguay, starting the tests in 2006.|$|R

5000|$|A Mammals and Birds <b>Excluder</b> <b>Device</b> or MBED (also named Cachalotera) is {{a fishing}} gear device that avoids the {{depredation}} {{of the fish}} caught in the line for Marine Mammals, and avoids the entanglement of seabirds when is setting the line and hauling.

50|$|In 1978, the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) {{started to}} develop turtle <b>excluder</b> <b>devices</b> (TEDs). A TED uses a grid which {{deflects}} turtles {{and other big}} animals, so they exit from the trawl net through an opening above the grid. US shrimp trawlers and foreign fleets which market shrimp in the US are required to use TEDs. Not all nations enforce the use of TEDs.|$|R
50|$|In 1987, the United States {{required}} all trawling shrimping {{boats to}} equip their nets with turtle <b>excluder</b> <b>devices.</b> As a follow-up two years after, the shrimp-turtle law was implemented. This required all countries that the USA was importing shrimp from to certify that the shrimp they shipped were harvested by boats equipped with TEDs. Countries that cannot guarantee {{the use of}} the escape devices were banned from exporting shrimp to the USA.|$|R
25|$|Fishing {{techniques}} may {{be altered}} to minimize bycatch and reduce impacts on marine habitats. These techniques include using varied gear types depending on target species and habitat type. For example, a net with larger holes will allow undersized fish to avoid capture. A turtle <b>excluder</b> <b>device</b> (TED) allows sea turtles and other megafauna {{to escape from}} shrimp trawls. Avoiding fishing in spawning grounds may allow fish stocks to rebuild by giving adults a chance to reproduce.|$|R
50|$|The TTED (Trash and Turtle <b>Excluder</b> <b>Device)</b> is {{a recent}} {{refinement}} of the TED, which, as well as turtles, can additionally free other forms of bycatch. The TTED reduces sorting time and risks of injury due to sharks and rays being caught, improves the quality of shrimps, which {{are less likely to}} be crushed in the bottom of the trawl, and may also lead to a reduction in the amount of fuel consumed by the boats.|$|R
5|$|Fishing gear is {{the biggest}} threat to loggerheads in the open ocean. They often become {{entangled}} in longlines or gillnets. According to the 2009 status review of loggerheads by the Fisheries Service, drowning from entanglement in longline and gillnet fishing gear is the turtles’ primary threat in the North Pacific. They also become stuck in traps, pots, trawls, and dredges. Caught in this unattended equipment, loggerheads risk serious injury or drowning. Turtle <b>excluder</b> <b>devices</b> for nets and other traps reduce the number being accidentally caught.|$|R
40|$|This report {{provides}} {{quantitative information}} {{on the effects of}} turtle <b>excluder</b> <b>devices</b> (TEDs) and bycatch reduction devices (BRDs) on the catch rates of bycatch, prawns, scallops and byproduct species, such as Moreton Bay bugs and Balmain bugs, in Queensland’s major trawl fishing sectors. It also provides biological information on, and management advice for several species referred to in the Fishery Management Plan as the permitted species. Several recommendations are included for reducing bycatch in the trawl fishery and for sustaining stocks of the permitted species...|$|R
5000|$|Kramer's first {{contention}} {{was that}} the district court erred in applying the enhancement [...] "because a cellular telephone, when used only to make voice calls and send text messages, cannot be a computer as defined in [...]" [...] In Kramer's view, the enhancement should apply only when a device is used to access the Internet. The Court of Appeals disagreed. The court concluded that [...] "there {{is nothing in the}} statutory definition that purports to <b>exclude</b> <b>devices</b> because they lack a connection to the Internet." ...|$|R

50|$|Marine {{conservation}} {{technologies are}} used to protect endangered and threatened marine organisms and/or habitat. These technologies are innovative and revolutionary because they reduce bycatch, increase the survivorship and health of marine life and habitat, and benefit fishermen who depend on the resources for profit. Examples of technologies include marine protected areas (MPAs), turtle <b>excluder</b> <b>devices</b> (TEDs), autonomous recording unit, pop-up satellite archival tag, and radio-frequency identification (RFID).
