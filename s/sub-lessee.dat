40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to {{identify}} the legal problems concerning agricultural land transactions and management as well as to try to solve these problems, namely to formulate de lege ferenda conclusions. First of all, the discussion focuses on the issues relating to a sub–lease of agricultural land in the context of the pre–emption right and getting the EU financial aid. Next, the paper indicates the problems concerning the pre–emption right that the lessees of municipal land have and the possibility these entities have to use tax preferences to enlarge their farms. Subsequently, the article presents the issue of building works on agricultural land which is part of the farm, especially the works done by individual farmers. The author, presenting the above problems, has tried to put forward de lege ferenda proposals, for instance granting the pre–emption right to a <b>sub–lessee,</b> granting tax preferences to lessees of municipal and private land in the case of enlarging the farms and the freedom to build family farms on agricultural land. In addition, the summary calls for adopting a new act on agricultural lease and for changing the scope of activity of the Agriculture Property Agency. Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy w Poznani...|$|E

40|$|Land tenure {{describes}} the regime {{by means of}} which land is owned or possessed, whether by landholders, private owners, tenants, <b>sub-lessees,</b> or squatters. It embraces individual or group rights to occupy and/or use the land, the social relationships that may be identified among the rural population, and the converging influences of the local and central power structures. Features in the portrait of ancient Egyptian land tenure that may be traced over time in response to changing configurations of government include state and institutional landownership, private smallholdings, compulsory labor (corvée), cleruchies, leasing, and tenancy. Such documents as Papyrus Harris I, the Wilbour Papyrus, Papyrus Reinhardt, and the Ptolemaic Zenon and Menches archives provide evidence of various regimes of landholding, {{the status of the}} landholders, their relationship to the land, {{and the way in which}} the harvest was divided among cultivators, landowners, and the state.

5000|$|Further {{leasehold}} land {{was added to}} Jondaryan by the mid-1850s, with its total area covering around 125,000 acres when brothers Robert and Edwin Tooth acquired the leasehold in 1856. They also made the last payment on the freehold block purchased in [...] The Tooth brothers were merchants and brewers, {{with an interest in}} the bank of New South Wales as well as the Colonial Sugar Refining Company established in 1855. They resided in Sydney during their tenure of Jondaryan. James Charles White was manager of the property and continued there for 12 years after William Kent and Edward Wienholt became <b>sub-lessees</b> of Jondaryan in 1858. For the next ten years, Jondaryan entered a phase of prosperity and growth as conditions on the Darling Downs allowed pastoralists to accumulate previously unparalleled profits. Some of these profits were used to purchase portions of the leaseholding. By 1867, more than 22,000 acres of Jondaryan's 154 square miles of land had been purchased under pre-emptive right, making Jondaryan one of the largest freehold properties of the district at that time.|$|R
30|$|However, in 1983 {{before this}} new {{management}} system was fully implemented government shifted to another policy under which waterbodies less than 20 acres {{were transferred to}} the newly formed Upazila Parishad (sub-district councils) {{as a means of}} augmenting their income, whilst those over 20 acres reverted to MOL control, although with 50  % of the income accruing from these earmarked for Upazila Parishad. The NFMP was adopted in 1986 to provide access to genuine poor fishers and promote fisheries management and conservation in association with the Department of Fisheries (DOF). About 400 waterbodies were brought under this management system. Another shift in waterbody management took place in 1991, when a tendering procedure was introduced among fishers society for the leasing of Jalmahal. None of these policy shifts created positive impacts on fish catch and bio-diversity as leaseholders’ main intention in each instance continued to be profit maximization. In order to ensure this outcome leaseholders employ middlemen (<b>sub-lessees)</b> or local musclemen to exclude real fishers in the fishing process. This enables them to use illegal fishing practices to extract the highest yields of fishes wherever possible.|$|R
5000|$|On his {{permanent}} {{return to}} Tyneside in 1843, residing at 39, Collingwood St., Hall was an established and secure figure. In {{addition to his}} lucrative mining and property holdings, he is listed as a shareholder in the Old Hartlepool Docks and Railway Company, Newcastle, Shields and Sunderland Union Banking Co., Scotswood Bridge Co., and J.S.Challoners, Scotswood Rd... Additionally, he {{had an interest in}} the Ovingham Bleachery, George Hartford & John Reed and the Middlesbrough Sail Cloth Co.Unfortunately, the late 1840s seem to have been a bad time for business. Correspondence from the period tells of a series of failures. In May 1847, the Middlesbrough Sail Cloth Company was heading for bankruptcy and Hall was referring to the Banks, [...] "going wrong". William Thompson Dixon, Sailcloth Manufacturer, has managed to pay only 5/3 in the £. By December, even Hall himself is being refused further credit by Balamore Mills on the supply of flax for his bleachery. Finally, in March 1848, the Union Bank is appealing to its members for additional funding to stave off its collapse. A further concern during this period was the developing problem with the Stella Haugh land. Townley, who had previously controlled the lease, sought to demonstrate that Hall had neglected his duties as lessee and landlord, which would potentially have allowed him to benefit from the considerable investment which Hall and his <b>sub-lessees</b> had made over more than a decade. The case was heard as Molyneux v. Hall before Mr. Justice Williams at the Durham Summer Assizes on 30 July 1851. Mr. Justice Williams reduced the argument to five points of law, on all of which the jury found predominantly for the defendant, Hall.|$|R
40|$|The thesis's {{objective}} is to describe the relationship between inland capture fisheries management and {{the welfare of the}} poor m Bangladesh. Existing economic models of fisheries management do not address issues of income-distribution, concentrating instead upon rent-maximisation. The thesis therefore aims to develop new models of the distributional impact of management interventions, based upon a qualitative and quantitative understanding of the social, institutional and economic processes whereby fishery incomes are created and distributed. The study site is Hail Haor, a 13, 600 ha floodplain in N. E. Bangladesh. Descriptions of its physical ecology, fishing technologies and fishing communities are given. There follows a detailed explanation of the social, institutional and economic transactions whereby fishing incomes are distributed between fishing labour, lessees, <b>sub-lessees,</b> government officials and the government. Estimates of yields, sales and employment levels are presented on a per hectare basis. Sales are divided between labour income, fishing costs and tolls. Tolls are in turn apportioned to the various groups of recipients. Fishermen's access to profitable fishing activities is shown to be a function of religion and social and economic status. Poor fishermen tend to operate with low-yield, labour-intensive gears, in shallow water and during the flood season. They therefore do not perceive themselves to benefit from policies that enhance the dry-season, capital-intensive fishery. Simulation and analytical models demonstrate how current policy interventions benefit rich people at the expense of poorer fisherfolk. They raise rents, which accrue to rich people, by reducing employment, upon which the poor depend. They also postpone the catch from the labour-intensive flood season fishery to the capital-intensive dry-season fishery. It is concluded that existing policy is regressive and that fisheries assessments should address the issue of income-distribution {{as well as that of}} rent-maximisation. Appropriate assessment methodologies are proposed...|$|R
