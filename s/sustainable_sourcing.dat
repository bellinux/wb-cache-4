50|$|A {{growing number}} of {{companies}} are realizing that investing in sustainable management of wild harvests and associated supply chains makes good business sense. As well as avoiding the need to discontinue or reformulate products, investment in <b>sustainable</b> <b>sourcing,</b> particularly when coupled with “fair trade”, can enhance a company’s corporate image. This is reinforced by growing consumer awareness of and demand for “ethical” products. Governments are also increasingly recognizing the economic importance of wild-product trade, and so keen to address sustainability issues and ensure product quality through more transparent supply chains. Groups promoting “alternative livelihoods” based on commercialization of non-timber forest products have also {{come to realize that}} success relies on stable supplies, as well as stable or growing markets.|$|E
5000|$|The {{project has}} {{acted as a}} case study for other, similar projects. Areas such as the Western Ghats in India and areas of Bali are {{beginning}} to use similar practices in order to make money from the fish trade and sustain the environment of the fish. Project Piaba is often used to show how groups can support the environment while providing economic stimulus to a poor region of the world. In addition, the <b>sustainable</b> <b>sourcing</b> of fish is also a stimulus to the idea of [...] "beneficial home fishkeeping" [...] which emphasizes proper fish care, which, in turn supports those who catch the fish in the wild. When there is no incentive to fish, individuals in the Rio Negro area turn to less-environmentally friendly means of support, such as logging or cattle ranching. In fact, Project Piaba aims to actively discourage domestic farming of fish which are also sustainable resources, like the cardinal tetra, because it will take the financial incentive away from protecting the rain forest of the Rio Negro area.|$|E
40|$|The {{decline of}} {{collective}} bargaining and the blurring of organisational boundaries between firms have adversely affected employment {{standards in the}} British labour market. In this context, this paper considers the potential for using socially <b>sustainable</b> <b>sourcing</b> to strengthen collective labour market protections for low-wage workers, particularly in situations where work and production is organised across organisational boundaries. It examines the different ways that firms, unions, civil society organisations and governments have used <b>sustainable</b> <b>sourcing</b> mechanisms to counter the negative impacts of outsourcing and supply chain pressures on labour standards. At a domestic level, compulsory forms of <b>sustainable</b> <b>sourcing</b> {{appear to be a}} more effective than voluntary forms for protecting labour standards, but the prospect of a compulsory model being adopted in Britain seems unlikely. Socially <b>sustainable</b> <b>sourcing</b> mechanisms are nevertheless likely to become increasingly important for protecting labour standards across organisational boundaries. 20 page(s...|$|E

40|$|Problem – Companies are {{increasingly}} focusing on sustainability issues {{in response to}} internal and external pressure. Research on sustainable performance of focal companies is vast; however {{there is a lack}} of guidelines for managing sustainability in extended supply chains. Scholars claim a need for additional research on intra- and inter-organizational diffusion of best sustainable practices. Besides, the outcomes of <b>sustainable</b> <b>sourcing</b> practices are still uncertain. The gap between potential benefits of <b>sustainable</b> <b>sourcing</b> and actual performance is attributed to lack of capabilities, instruments, and efficient processes. Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to explore existing <b>sustainable</b> <b>sourcing</b> practices which are used by leading multinational companies. Based on the obtained knowledge we aim to develop a framework that will suite as a guideline for enforcing <b>sustainable</b> <b>sourcing</b> practices. Method – The research has been conducted through the method of grounded theory, enabling the researchers to constructively interpret data from documentary primary data and semi-structured interviews. This approach was utilized in order to explore what are the most common practices of managing <b>sustainable</b> <b>sourcing</b> applied by the companies awarded as Industry leaders by the Dow Jones Sustainability Index. Conclusion We found that a commonly accepted approach towards managing and enforcing <b>sustainable</b> <b>sourcing</b> is absent both in theoretical discourse and practice. However, the most frequently mentioned tools and approaches were defined. They include the adoption of suppliers’ code of conduct, establishment of dedicated sustainability departments, procurement personnel training, suppliers’ capability building, risk assessment and categorization of suppliers, IT platforms for information sharing, supplier self-assessment, audit, joint projects with suppliers, meetings and conferences, and suppliers’ scorecards. Finally, we developed a <b>Sustainable</b> <b>Sourcing</b> Enforcement framework which could serve as a guideline to enforce supplier’s commitment to act sustainably. The framework consists of five chronologically connected pillars: Objectives alignment, Commitment creation, Supplier selection, Ongoing development and Work with stakeholders...|$|E
40|$|This study investigates {{procedures}} of <b>sustainable</b> <b>sourcing</b> in the German grocery retailing business focussing on green purchasing strategies {{with regard to}} food products. Since Germany is leading in sustainability commitment, {{it is interesting to}} see how retailers approach <b>sustainable</b> <b>sourcing</b> in a highly competitive market environment like the German grocery retailing. The research aims to provide insights in current practices across varying grocery retailing strategies as well as approaches of how to implement certain procedures or develop products sustainably. Primary data were collected conducting an online questionnaire survey in order to gain a first impression which was followed by semi-structured face-to-face interviews with seven managers in six small case studies. The main idea was to identify {{procedures of}} <b>sustainable</b> <b>sourcing</b> that are widely acknowledged among the players and showed first success at the customer base. Further the research aims to clarify how retailers may influence the greening of a products SC as well as the product itself. The data analysis reveals that German grocery retailers are {{in the early stages of}} development of <b>sustainable</b> <b>sourcing</b> procedures although some interesting approaches are implemented already. Moreover, the data indicates that differences in procedures exist according to corporate sustainability and corporate sustainability strategies as well as varying maturity levels of it, being caused by different retailing strategies such as discounting and self-service stores. Furthermore there is a relationship between development of sustainable products and communication between buyer and supplier. The research results have implications for German grocery retailers, as they indicate the potential for development of sustainable products through engaging in new product development and other supplier development approaches, mainly with SME suppliers. While this research focuses on the grocery retailing market, strategic deliberations concerning sustainability and <b>sustainable</b> <b>sourcing</b> may be transferred to other fast moving consumer goods markets likewise...|$|E

40|$|Import of {{wood pellets}} to the EU from the southeastern United States has {{increased}} almost ten-fold {{over the past}} seven years, driven largely by mandates under the Renewable Energy Directive. While the displacement of fossil fuels with biomass can offer significant energy diversity and climate benefits, these must be balanced against the potential detriment from unsustainable extraction of biomass resources. This study projects the scale of the sustainable biomass resource base in the US southeast through 2030 under various scenarios of industry development and domestic market dynamics. We characterise this resource base at the county level, disaggregating it by material type and spatially constraining it to ensure biodiversity conservation. Our analysis shows that there could be as much as 70 million green metric tons of sustainable export potential from the US Southeast in 2030. However, we also show the extent to which <b>sustainable</b> <b>sourcing</b> criteria applied only to EU biomass energy imports could create leakage across biomass markets, erasing gains from any sustainability mandate. This leakage risk was fairly consistent across our study scenarios and time periods, ranging from 50 to over 63 million green tons of biomass per year. Meaningful biodiversity protections can only be achieved if sustainability criteria for biomass import to the EU are combined with more comprehensive support for <b>sustainable</b> <b>sourcing</b> across biomass industries in exporting regions...|$|E
