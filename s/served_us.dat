From 1965 to 1966, with the aid of the United States and other Western governments, the military led the mass killing of an estimated half-million members and sympathizers of the Indonesian Communist Party and other leftist organizations. A top-secret CIA report stated that the massacres [...] "rank as one of the worst mass murders of the 20th century, along with the Soviet purges of the 1930s, the Nazi mass murders during the Second World War, and the Maoist bloodbath of the early 1950s." [...] These killings <b>served</b> <b>U.S.</b> strategic interests and constitute a major turning point in the Cold War.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the end of}} {{the second}} season, Taylor decided to remove the Kazon as the series' primary antagonists, having found the effort to develop the alien species to be unsuccessful. She felt that they never grew into a {{compelling}} adversary, despite their appearances in multiple episodes. Taylor argued that the Kazon limited the potential of the series, saying: [...] "It created the curious implication that we are standing still in space, when our franchise is that we are going at incredible speeds toward the Alpha Quadrant – we keep running into the same people over and over again! It was just an oddity, and I don't think the Kazon have <b>served</b> <b>us</b> well." [...] While discussing their role in the future episodes, she explained that it was her [...] "intention to leave them behind and to find new and I hope more interesting aliens".|$|E

Reilly, in announcing the renewal, stated that [...] "Fringe is a remarkably creative series that has set the bar as one of television's most imaginative dramas. Bringing it back for a final 13 allows us to provide the climactic conclusion that its passionate and loyal fans deserve". The writing team crafted {{an idea for a}} cohesive story-driven set of thirteen episodes as a means to complete the series, and to [...] "honor the audience that had <b>served</b> <b>us</b> so well was to say a proper farewell", according to Roth.

Duckworth received the endorsement of both the Chicago Tribune and the Daily Herald. Walsh generated controversy when in July 2012, at a campaign event, he accused Duckworth of politicizing her military service and injuries, saying [...] "my God, that's all she talks about. Our true heroes, {{the men and women}} who <b>served</b> <b>us,</b> it's the last thing in the world they talk about." [...] Walsh called the controversy over his comments [...] "a political ploy to distort my words and distract voters" [...] and said that [...] "Of course Tammy Duckworth is a hero ...
