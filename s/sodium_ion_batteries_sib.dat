40|$|Due to {{the poor}} {{transportability}} of <b>sodium</b> <b>ions,</b> conventional <b>sodium</b> <b>ion</b> <b>batteries</b> (<b>SIBs)</b> cannot deliver sufficient capacity for high rate applications. Surface-induced capacitive processes (SCP) (e. g. capacitance and pseudocapacitance) could provide fast charge/discharge capacity {{in conjunction with the}} capacity provided by diffusion-controlled intercalation processes (DIP) to address this issue. For the first time, SCP was used to design a hierarchical layered graphene composite as an anode material for high rate SIBs. The contributions of the individual sodium storage processes were quantitatively evaluated, verifying the proposed mechanism. The resultant SCP-enhanced SIB delivers an outstanding rate capacity of 120 mAh/g at 10 A/g, which is among best of the state-of-the-art carbon-based SIBs. It also demonstrates exceptional cycling stability, retaining 83. 5 % capacity of 142 mAh/g at 0. 5 A/g after 2500 cycles. Griffith Sciences, Griffith School of EnvironmentNo Full Tex...|$|R
40|$|Phosphorus {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{promising}} anodes for <b>sodium</b> <b>ion</b> <b>batteries</b> (<b>SIBs).</b> Little is known about the structural mechanism of Na/P cycling due to the fact that only one of the structures involved (Na 3 P) is crystalline. Using operando X-ray diffraction computed tomography (XRD-CT) analysed by Rietveld and pair distribution (PDF) methods combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations we show that the sodiation and desodiation mechanisms of phosphorus are very different. Sodiation follows the thermodynamic path of lowest energy from P via NaP to Na 3 P while desodiation follows a kinetically controlled deintercalation mechanism in which the layered Na 3 -xP type structure is maintained until P nanoclusters form. Using XRD-CT allows analysis of the 3 D structure of the anode, but most importantly, removes the contributions from the sample container and other battery components, particularly important for PDF analysis.

The work also shows that sulfur doping creates additional redox sites for reaction with Na+ and induces larger interspacing layers, leading to an enhanced capacity compared to the non-doped graphene. The self-standing nature of the films also eliminates the need for other additional anode components, such as conductive carbon or binder, and more importantly, allows their recovery and subsequent reuse in new applications...|$|R

Lithium <b>ion</b> <b>batteries</b> (LIBs) offer high energy storage density, long cycling life, and excellent safety properties, thus dominating the market for portable electronic device power sources [1]. However, the depletion of lithium resources and the consequent high cost of lithium hinder the application of LIBs in several emerging areas, such as large-scale grid energy storage [2]. Sodium, another Group I element, is much more abundant and has a much lower cost. As such, <b>sodium</b> <b>ion</b> <b>batteries</b> (<b>SIBs),</b> which have a charging/discharging mechanism {{similar to that of}} LIBs, are promising energy storage devices for the future and have received great research attention {{in the past few years}} [3]. Nevertheless, the energy storage performance of SIBs is significantly limited by a lack of suitable electrode materials. For example, while graphite is used as the anode material in most commercial LIBs, it is nearly electrochemically inactive with sodium due to the large ionic radius of Na+ [4]. Although many other carbonaceous materials have been intensively investigated as anode materials for SIBs, their sodium storage capabilities are too low to meet the demands of practical applications.|$|R

Among {{many different types of}} carbons, hard carbons—especially these derived from biomass—hold a great deal of promise for SIB technology thanks to their constantly improving performance and low cost. The main scope of this mini-review is to present current progress in preparation of negative electrodes from biomass including aspects related to precursor types used and their impact on the final carbon characteristics (structure, texture and composition). Another aspect discussed is how certain macro- and microstructure characteristics of the materials translate to their performance as anode for Na-ion batteries.

Na 2 FeP 2 O 7 maintains well-defined channel structures (triclinic framework under the P 1 space group) and exhibits a reversible capacity of ? 90 mAh g? 1 with good cycling performance. Both quasi-equilibrium measurements and first-principles calculations consistently indicate that Na 2 FeP 2 O 7 undergoes two kinds of reactions over the entire voltage range of 2. 0 � 4. 5 V (vs Na/Na+) : a single-phase reaction around 2. 5 V and a series of two-phase reactions in the voltage range of 3. 0 � 3. 25 V. Na 2 FeP 2 O 7 shows excellent thermal stability up to 500 �C, even in the partially desodiated state (NaFeP 2 O 7), which suggests its safe character, a property that is very critical for large-scale battery applications.

Herein, towards achieving fast and durable sodiation/desodiation reaction, Fe 3 O 4 and Co 3 O 4 nanocrystals encapsulated in carbon micro-spheres are synthesized via a biochemistry approach using recombinant elastin-like polypeptides containing hexahistidine tag (ELP 16 -His) followed by annealing. Fe 3 O 4 and Co 3 O 4 nanocrystals of approximately 5 nm in size, which are uniformly dispersed in a carbon matrix, are obtained.

In the formation process of FT-PNCNFs, PPY is directly converted into hierarchical porous nitrogen-doped carbon layers, while GO is simultaneously reduced to become electrically conductive. The complementary functions of individual components endow the FT-PNCNFs with excellent properties for both supercapacitors (SCs) and <b>sodium</b> <b>ion</b> <b>batteries</b> (<b>SIBs)</b> applications. When tested in symmetrical SC, the FT-PNCNFs demonstrate superior energy storage behaviour. At an extremely high scan rate of 3000 mV s- 1, the cyclic voltammetry (CV) curve retains an inspiring quasi-rectangle shape in KOH solution. Meanwhile, high capacitances (∼ 247 F g- 1 at 10 mV s- 1; ∼ 146 F g- 1 at 3000 mV s- 1) and good cycling stability (∼ 95 % retention after 8000 cycles) are achieved. In addition, an attractive SIB anode performance could be achieved. The FT-PNCNFs electrode delivers a reversible capacity of 187 mAh g- 1 during 160 th cycle at 100 mA g- 1.

The Co 3 O 4 @NC shows a porous nature with a surface area of 101 m 2 g 1.

Prussian blue (PB) and its analogues (PBAs) {{have been considered}} as potential cathodes because of their rigid open framework and low-cost synthesis. Nevertheless, PBAs suffer from inferior rate capability and poor cycling stability resulting from the low electronic conductivity and deficiencies in the PBAs framework. Herein, to understand the vacancy-impacted sodium storage and Na-insertion reaction kinetics, we report on an in-situ synthesized PB@C composite as a high-performance SIB cathode. Perfectly shaped, nanosized PB cubes were grown directly on carbon chains, assuring fast charge transfer and Na-ion diffusion. The existence of [Fe(CN) 6] vacancies in the PB crystal is found to greatly degrade the electrochemical activity of the FeLS(C) redox couple via first-principles computation. Superior reaction kinetics are demonstrated for the redox reactions of the FeHS(N) couple, which rely on the partial insertion of Na ions to enhance the electron conduction. The synergistic effects of the structure and morphology results in the PB@C composite achieving an unprecedented rate capability and outstanding cycling stability (77. 5 mAh g− 1 at 90 C, 90 mAh g− 1 after 2000 cycles at 20 C with 90 % capacity retention) ...|$|R

The organic compound 4, 8 -dihydrobenzo[1, 2 -b: 4, 5 -b¿] dithiophene- 4, 8 -dione (BDT) was prepared by a facile solution method, and its graphene composite (BDT-G) was synthesized by a simple dispersion-deposition process.

Since both sodium and lithium are located in Group 1 of the periodic table, they share similar (electro) chemical properties with regard to ionization pattern, electronegativity, and electronic configuration; thus the vast number of compounds developed from LIBs can provide guidance to design electrode materials for SIBs. However, the larger ionic radius of the sodium cation and unique (de) sodiation processes may also lead to uncertainties in terms of thermodynamic or kinetic properties. Herein, we present the first construction of SIBs based on inorganic fullerene-like (IF) MoS 2 nanoparticles. Closed-shell-type structures, represented by C 60 fullerene, have largely been neglected for studies of alkali-metal hosting materials due to their inaccessibility for intercalating ions into the inner spaces. However, IF-MoS 2, with faceted surfaces, can diffuse <b>sodium</b> <b>ions</b> through the defective channels, thereby allowing reversible <b>sodium</b> <b>ion</b> intercalation/deintercalation. Interestingly, Re-doped MoS 2 showed good electrochemical performances with fast kinetics (ca. 74 mAhg- 1 at 20 C).

40|$|We have {{systematically}} {{changed the}} number of atomic layers stacked in 2 D SnO nanosheet anodes and studied their <b>sodium</b> <b>ion</b> <b>battery</b> (<b>SIB)</b> performance. The results indicate that as {{the number of}} atomic SnO layers in a sheet decreases, both the capacity and cycling stability of the Na <b>ion</b> <b>battery</b> improve. The thinnest SnO nanosheet anodes (two to six SnO monolayers) exhibited the best performance. Specifically, an initial discharge and charge capacity of 1072 and 848 mAh g- 1 were observed, respectively, at 0. 1 A g- 1. In addition, an impressive reversible capacity of 665 mAh g- 1 after 100 cycles at 0. 1 A g- 1 and 452 mAh g- 1 after 1000 cycles at a high current density of 1. 0 A g- 1 was observed, with excellent rate performance. As the average number of atomic layers in the anode sheets increased, the battery performance degraded significantly. For example, for the anode sheets with 10 - 20 atomic layers, only a reversible capacity of 389 mAh g- 1 could be obtained after 100 cycles at 0. 1 A g- 1. Density functional theory calculations coupled with experimental results were used to elucidate the sodiation mechanism of the SnO nanosheets.

Especially, sodium-selenium (Na-Se) batteries have drawn increasing interest in these years [20 – 22]. The Se element is in the same group with S and has similar electrochemistry versus Na while the energy density of Na 2 Se (3254 mAh cm− 3) is comparable to Li 2 Se (3467 mAh cm− 3) [23 – 26]. Moreover, the electric conductivity of Se (10 − 3 [*]S[*]cm− 1) is much higher than that of S (10 − 30 [*]S[*]cm− 1 at 25 [*]°C) [27]. The shuttle effect of polyselenides (which is similar to the polysulfides, Na 2 Sen, 3 [*]<[*]n[*]<[*] 8) can also deteriorate the cycle life of Na-Se batteries; therefore, it is a key challenge to overcome the hurdle of polyselenides shuttle [28 – 30]. Carbon matrixes with appropriate porosity and high electric conductivity, which are always used to load Se, have been regarded as an effective way to address the above issues in recent years [20, 21, 31, 32]. Much endeavor has been made to trap the soluble polyselenides within various carbons including carbon nanofibers [33, 34], carbon spheres [35, 36], and carbon nanosheets [22], which have been proved to effectively improve the electrochemical performance of Na-Se batteries.

The XRD results evidenced that the mass ratio of layered and tunnel components would be markedly influenced by sodium source. Electrochemical test results also demonstrate distinctive performances of Na 0. 6 MnO 2 cathodes with various sodium sources. Na 0. 6 MnO 2 cathode with Na 2 C 2 O 4 exhibited the best performances with 90 mAh g− 1 retained after 100 cycles at 1. 0 C.

It has been demonstrated that Na 3 Ni 2 BiO 6 delivers a discharge capacity of 106 mA h g- 1, having high voltage plateaus at 3. 50 and 3. 25 V, with marginal capacity fading after 50 cycles. Operando X-ray diffraction studies during charging/discharging reveal two reversible two-phase transition mechanisms (initial O 3 phase → P 3 intermediate phase → O 1 final phase) during sodium extraction. Ex situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy reveals the charge compensation mechanism for the reversible Ni 3 +/Ni 2 + as an active redox couple while Bi 5 + being inactive during cycling. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure analysis shows highly reversible local structural changes around both Ni and Bi atoms occurring during electrochemical cycling.
