50|$|In {{addition}} to the Audi S4, which carried over the powertrain from the B6 S4 - Audi reintroduced the quattro GmbH developed Audi RS4 (RS for RennSport) to the lineup, {{for the first time}} on the saloon/sedan and Cabriolet body, and with a naturally aspirated, but high-revving 4.2-litre V8 FSI engine. Another notable inclusion on the RS4 is the latest generation Torsen T-3 quattro 4wd system, which uses a default asymmetric 40:60 front-rear dynamic torque distribution bias. This new asymmetric centre differential was initially only available on the RS4, but was added a year later on the S4. The remainder of the B7 A4 range still utilised the T-2 50:50 default dynamic <b>split</b> <b>centre</b> diff.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Linear flow {{splitting}} {{is a new}} continuous {{cold forming}} process where {{the edge of a}} sheet metal is formed into two flanges by splitting and supporting rolls. Thus the production of bifurcated profiles from sheet metal without lamination of material becomes feasible. The production of such structures takes place incrementally in a modified roll forming machine. Experimental investigate-ons on a HSLA steel show, that even at a surface increase of the sheet edge of about 1800 % no cracks were nucleated in the profiles. EBSD measurements in the <b>splitting</b> <b>centre</b> reveal that similar to other SPD processes UFG microstructures develop in the processing zone. Thus a steady state is reached in the processing zone where increasing strain has no more (or little) influence on the materials properties i. e. its deformability, as it is typical for SPD-processes. The formation of UFG microstructures {{is considered to be a}} mandatory condition for the linear flow splitting process, as it improves the formability of the material to the extremely high level required for this process. The mechanical properties of profiles produced by linear flow splitting are characterised by large gradients, depending on the local deformation and the resulting microstructure. Very high hardness is measured at the former processing zone, i. e. the <b>splitting</b> <b>centre</b> and the flange surface, where severe plastic deformation takes place and UFG microstructures are present.

50|$|There {{were later}} <b>splits,</b> <b>centred</b> {{as much on}} {{international}} affiliation as Irish issues. The Socialist Labour League in Britain {{had a number of}} (mainly Protestant) members in Belfast during the 1960s and was seeking a base in the Republic of Ireland. Cliff Slaughter was sent to Dublin to discuss with an LWR minority, which included Jim Monaghan (who later became a USec Reunified Fourth International supporter) and Dermot Whelan (later to rejoin the LWR and then Sinn Féin). Slaughter won the support of this faction for Gerry Healy and the ICFI (International Committee of the Fourth International). They then split and together with Dave Fry and others formed the League for a Workers Vanguard.|$|R

40|$|AbstractRecent X-ray {{structures}} determined for the Photosystem II (PSII) core complex {{isolated from}} cyanobacteria have provided important information {{for understanding the}} functionality of this photosynthetic enzyme including its water splitting activity. As yet, no high-resolution structure is available for PSII of plants or eukaryotes in general. However, crystal structures have been determined for some components of plant PSII which together with the cyanobacterial structure {{can be used to}} interpret lower resolution structures of plant PSII derived from electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM). Here, we utilise the published X-ray structures of a cyanobacterial PSII core, Light Harvesting Complex II (LHCII), PsbP and PsbQ proteins to construct a model of the plant LHCII–PSII supercomplex using a 17  Å resolution 3 D electron density map of the spinach supercomplex determined by cryo-EM and single particle analysis. In so doing, we tentatively identify the relative positioning of the chlorophylls within the supercomplex and consider energy transfer pathways between the different subunits. The modelling has also allowed density to be assigned to the three extrinsic proteins of plant PSII, PsbO, PsbP and PsbQ associated with the water <b>splitting</b> <b>centre</b> and concluded that although the position of PsbO is the same as in cyanobacteria, PsbP and PsbQ are located in different positions to the cyanobacterial extrinsic PsbU and PsbV proteins...|$|R
