This second frame was described as [...] "semi-floating" [...] to allow the damping out of engine vibrations and to prevent fractures.

Additionally, Ford also asked for dealers to stop test-driving and selling select Focus and C-Max vehicles in late August.

50|$|Originally the {{fairings}} were cowlings put {{around the}} front of the bike, increasing its frontal area. Gradually they became {{an integral part of the}} design. Modern fairings increase the frontal area at most by 5% compared to a naked machine. Fairings may carry headlights, instruments, and other items.

5000|$|The {{structural}} design, revolutionary at the time, applied aeronautical technology. The [...] "tub", or cockpit section, was of monocoque construction, mostly comprising {{sheets of}} aluminium alloy. Its elliptical shape and comparatively small cross-section provided torsional rigidity and reduced drag. To the front bulkhead was attached an aluminium tubing subframe for the engine, <b>steering</b> <b>assembly,</b> and front suspension.

50|$|An {{optional}} <b>steering</b> <b>assembly</b> with a sulky {{seat and}} wheels {{was available in}} 1949 to convert the Model W transmission into a riding unit. The BesRo tractor utilized a similar transmission and drive unit as the Model-W Garden King. The idea of the Model W BesRo was developed from Herbert Roths design of an ornamental tractor patent(D146,947). This original tricycle design {{was known as the}} BesRo Model W and was precursor to the BesRo Model R. The Model R BesRo used four wheels with the drive unit mounted in the rear. The riding frame was attached {{to the front of the}} transmission. The BesRo tractor was phased out of production by the mid-1950s and replaced with the Roths Country Boy.|$|E
50|$|The first {{generation}} King Midget was a single-passenger kit designed {{to resemble a}} midget racer. The kit included the chassis, axles, <b>steering</b> <b>assembly,</b> springs, instruction manual, plus dimensioned patterns for the sheet metal, all for a cost of $270.00. It would accept any one-cylinder engine. By 1947, the Model 1 was also available in assembled form, powered by a 6 hp (4.5 kW) Wisconsin engine. Since adding a differential would have increased the cost, the car was driven by the right rear wheel only. It used a centrifugal clutch designed by Orcutt. The pair began to develop a two-passenger micro car in 1947. In total, nine separate prototypes were built until the designers met their goals of simplicity, lightness, and economy. The result was the Model 2.|$|E

5000|$|In 2005 Traxxas {{released}} the Jato (pronounced Jay-toe) 2.5 (usually {{referred to as}} simply [...] "Jato"), which was a completely new design {{that was based on}} the 1/10 scale rear wheel drive stadium truck format popular in the industry, and it replaced the Nitro Rustler as Traxxas' high end stadium truck. It was powered by the same TRX 2.5 nitro engine as the Nitro Rustler but had many new high tech features, some borrowed from the Revo, that set it apart. One of the new features was a sophisticated 2-speed automatic transmission, that improved acceleration and top speed over the single speed Nitro Rustler. A new suspension design was another new feature. It included new [...] "GTR" [...] shocks and springs, which were borrowed from the Revo, but used in a traditional configuration instead of the Revo's push-rod configuration. The suspension also included front and rear mounting points for optional sway bars, which were offered as Traxxas accessories in three different thicknesses. The suspension was also fully adjustable for camber, caster, toe, anti-squat, and ride height. Other notable features included 2.8 inch wheels and tires, a sealed limited slip differential, rubber sealed drive shafts and ball bearings, <b>steering</b> <b>assembly,</b> Revo spec slipper clutch, and hex hardware.

50|$|The {{controls}} in the Model AA are entirely mechanical, except {{the windshield wipers}} in later models. The brakes are mechanical and the truck has four oversized drum brakes to stop the vehicle. The mechanical system is a pull lever system that applies the force from the pedal to a pivot that pulls the brake rods that expand the brakes in the drums. The brake light is activated when the brake pedal is pushed. The brakes are proportioned more toward the rear drums. The parking brake is a chrome lever {{on the floor with}} a release button on the top. The windshield wipers started as hand operated and later models were powered by vacuum diverted from the intake manifold. The horn button is mounted {{in the middle of the}} steering wheel assembly. Controls for the lights are also incorporated into the <b>steering</b> <b>assembly.</b> The switch was a three-stop switch for parking lights, headlights and high-beams. The tail-light lens colors on the AA underwent several changes during the production run. Two levers are mounted on the steering column to adjust the engine. The left lever controls the manual advance of the timing. Adjusting the timing of the engine changes the time that a spark will occur in the combustion chamber and those changes affect the performance of the engine. The right lever is a manual control for the throttle. The throttle can be adjusted to ease the shifting of the transmission and the idling speed of the engine. Underneath the dash on the right side is the choke rod. The choke can adjust the flow of fuel from the carburetor into the engine. Turning the knob on the choke rod clockwise closes the fuel flow, leaning out the engine; turning the knob counterclockwise opens the fuel flow to the engine.|$|E

40|$|The {{first part}} of this thesis {{addresses}} the design of the NMBU Mobile Agricultural Robot's drivetrain and <b>steering</b> <b>assembly,</b> while the second part discusses aspects related to controlling these systems. Part I: First, power requirements are calculated based on the expected worst case scenario. Second, the principle design of the systems is determined and parts are selected. For the drivetrain, a hub reduction system is used. The system comprises of four separate wheel modules, each with one brushless DC motor installed over the module's wheel. Power is transferred to an in-wheel planetary gearbox via a timing belt. For the <b>steering</b> <b>assembly,</b> brushless integrated servomotors with planetary gearboxes are used. The power distribution system is also discussed, and two designs are proposed, one for future and one for immediate implementation. All parts are selected based on availability, quality and cost. As a result, the components for the drivetrain are not perfectly matched. However, they allow for testing of the basic principle. Preliminary tests of the powertrain and <b>steering</b> <b>assembly</b> show promising results. Part II: Different components related to communication and control of the robot are presented, and the principle design of the motor control system is determined with interoperability between current and future systems in mind. ROS (Robotic Operating System) is selected to be used as the robotic framework, and the main computer and the various motor controllers are to communicate using the CANopen protocol. The process of configuring the propulsion motor controllers to match the propulsion motors is described, as is the process of setting up the servomotors. Problems were faced using the propulsion motors built in Hall sensors for feedback in closed loop speed mode, as the sensor assemblyâ€™s resolution proved to be too coarse.
