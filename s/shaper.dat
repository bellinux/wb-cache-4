5|$|An {{apprentice}} <b>Shaper</b> is sent on {{a training}} mission with a <b>Shaper</b> Agent named Shanti by the <b>Shaper</b> Council. The pair are tasked with assessing the failed <b>Shaper</b> colony Drypeak and making {{contact with the}} pair of Shapers, Barzahl and Zakary, who were dispatched years ago to revitalize the colony. The gates of Drypeak are found unmanned, much to Shanti's disgust, the Agent and her charge are also attacked by rogue <b>Shaper</b> creations. When the pair {{gain access to the}} colony, they find a dishevelled Zakary who informs them that both he and Barzahl were unsuccessful in revitalizing the colony, which remains a barren desert. He also states that Barzahl has died. Zakary and the population of Drypeak behave suspiciously. Shanti is shadowed by an armed guard against her will. She instructs the apprentice, who is not guarded, to explore Drypeak and beyond in order to discover the truth behind the colony and Barzahl's disappearance.|$|E
5|$|Players {{assume the}} role of an {{apprentice}} <b>Shaper,</b> a sect of mages who can create living creatures through force of will. The apprentice is cast away on Sucia, an island abandoned by the sect 200 years prior. The island contains groups of the Shapers' creations, who have formed their own ideologies regarding their creators in the intervening years. The primary motivation of the player is to escape the island and, in the process, deal with the forces working to steal the <b>Shaper</b> secrets abandoned on Sucia Isle.|$|E
5|$|The player {{begins as}} an {{initiate}} {{of a powerful}} sect of magicians, the Shapers. Members of the sect create living beings from the magical essence within themselves. Apprentices are sent to academies to learn the art of shaping and the player's character has been accepted to do so. The player departs on a voyage to the academy aboard a specially modified Drayk, a dragon-like <b>Shaper</b> Creation. During the journey, the <b>Shaper</b> passes a group of islands, {{one of which is}} recognized as the Barred Sucia Island. Locations Barred by the Shapers are closed to both the sect and outsiders alike, meaning a catastrophe has occurred or something very valuable is located there. As the <b>Shaper</b> examines Sucia, lost in thought, the craft is attacked and mortally wounded by an unidentified sailing ship. After igniting the vessel's sails with a fireball, the craft deposits the <b>Shaper</b> on an abandoned dockside before dying. The player is now stranded on Sucia Island and {{must find a way to}} leave.|$|E

40|$|Squeezable fabric-covered music interfaces, called "music <b>shapers</b> " were {{installed}} at the annual 2005 Bachman's / Marshall Field's flower show in Minneapolis, MN, which received approximately 200, 000 visitors during the two weeks it was open. The music <b>shapers</b> were {{one part of a}} set of interactive music and sound experiences that were designed to integrate into their large indoor garden. The music <b>shapers</b> {{were installed}} {{in a part of the}} garden representing an area under the sea. The <b>shapers</b> were mounted on pedestals and connected by string to fishing poles on a boat hung from the ceiling.

5|$|After encountering {{the three}} servile groups, the player begins {{to learn of}} a group of foreigners known as Sholai, explorers who have been shipwrecked on the island. It was the Sholai, led by a man named Trajkov, who {{attacked}} the player with their last remaining ship. Trajkov controls a device called the Geneforge, created by the Shapers, which can rewrite the user's DNA and make them incredibly powerful. This is the cause of the island's Barred status, the device was deemed too dangerous in the wrong hands. Trajkov and his followers have allied themselves with the Takers, absorbing the contents of canisters and trying to claim <b>Shaper</b> powers as their own. The group have been unable to activate the Geneforge itself due to a <b>Shaper</b> being needed to activate the device. A <b>Shaper</b> named Goettsch was kidnapped for this purpose, {{in the same manner as}} the player-character. Goettsch fled and stole the shaping gloves needed to safely use the Geneforge, causing Trajkov to attempt to kidnap the player as a replacement. During these events, some Sholai have escaped from their increasingly violent and unpredictable leader.|$|E
5|$|Geneforge 2 is a {{role-playing}} {{game where}} the player's choice of answers during conversations with non-player characters affects how the player is regarded amongst the game's four factions. The player character is an apprentice <b>Shaper,</b> a feared and secretive group who can create life. Players create a character {{from one of}} three character classes and explore the area surrounding Drypeak, a failing <b>Shaper</b> colony, solving quests and gaining experience. Each of the three character classes has a particular playing style and can approach tasks in different ways. Guardians are fighters who excel in standard combat skills, especially hand-to-hand fighting. They are capable of shaping creations, but have little affinity for magic. Agents are the game's version of rogues, and excel in spell casting and are capable of hand-to-hand combat. The <b>Shaper</b> is a summoner, capable of creating living creatures by using their own life essence. Shapers rely on their creations for protection. Players can also convince certain non-player characters to join them.|$|E
5|$|Players {{create a}} {{character}} {{from one of}} three character classes and explore the game's 84 locations, deciding whether to ally themselves {{with one of the}} four factions or remain neutral. The game's plot concerns an apprentice <b>Shaper</b> and an Agent (whose name is Shanti), both members of a secretive sect of wizards who can create life by using their own life energy. They are sent on a mission to investigate a failing <b>Shaper</b> colony called Drypeak. When they arrive not all is well, the player becomes drawn into a four-way war which has been hidden from the outside world.|$|E
50|$|Once at the safehouse, it's {{learned the}} <b>Shapers</b> have cut off Rebel {{reinforcements}} by blockading the Barrier Zone underground with three extremely powerful <b>Shapers</b> and their armies of powerful creations. Moseh, {{one of the}} three, has become a bit unstable and is threatening both <b>Shapers</b> and Rebels alike. Depending on whether the player is pro-rebel or pro-shaper, the player will be commanded to kill him or restore him respectively.|$|R
50|$|<b>Shapers</b> {{and their}} stats could be {{modified}} by players by choosing spells and items. <b>Shapers</b> also {{had access to}} wards that could be placed to provide vision to areas of the map for their team.|$|R
50|$|There {{were four}} roles: Gladiator, Tactician, Hunter, and Predator. Gladiators focused on killing lane minions. Tacticians focused on harassing enemy <b>shapers.</b> Hunters focused on killing creatures in the jungle. Predators focused on killing enemy <b>shapers.</b>|$|R
5|$|Using the Geneforge {{to empower}} {{himself and his}} followers, the Barzites, Barzahl intends to bestow god-like {{abilities}} on himself and his followers within the city of Rising. Barzahl cut off contact with Drypeak, preparing to repel the inevitable assault of the <b>Shaper</b> Council, who they wish to remain independent from. The Takers, a faction of intelligent serviles who had originated on Sucia Island, were given powers by Barzahl because they worked for him. In turn the Takers created powerful dragon-like beasts called drakons, taught the drakons how to create life themselves, and betrayed Barzahl. The Takers stand for the total destruction of the <b>Shaper</b> Council. The Awakened, the other servile faction in Geneforge 2, believe that Shapers should treat them as equals. They had {{been working with the}} Barzites, but the Awakened's leader Learned Pinner rejected the Barzites' view that serviles need to be controlled. Trade and communications between Zakary's now <b>Shaper</b> Council loyalist Drypeak and the other three factions have ceased, replaced with spies and subterfuge. The player is free to decide which faction they wish to join, if any, and to explore the game world, reacting to the characters and situations they encounter.|$|E
5|$|The {{player is}} free to join {{any one of the}} servile groups and share common goals, or remain unaligned. Geneforge can be {{completed}} without joining any group. Trajkov can be killed through combat or tricked into killing himself by using the Geneforge. He can also be aided in activating the device, if the player steals the <b>shaper</b> gloves from Goettsch. Goettsch offers the player fake <b>shaper</b> gauntlets, which do not protect Trajkov from the Geneforge's energy should he be convinced they are genuine shaping gloves. The player can complete the game by using the last boat on Sucia Island. The small vessel is moored in a guarded dock {{on the far side of}} the island. Finishing the game unlocks one of more than a dozen game endings, dependent on the player's actions during the game.|$|E
5|$|When {{confronted with}} the apprentice's findings, Zakary confesses to {{being part of a}} plot to conceal illegal {{experiments}} from the <b>Shaper</b> Council. Both he and Barzahl were sent to Sucia Island, the location where the original Geneforge game is set, where Barred <b>Shaper</b> technology had allowed Shapers to manipulate life in countless ways. Sucia Island.}} Instead of destroying the Geneforge, the pair agreed to spirit away the technology and experiment in private. Several of the intelligent serviles who lived on Sucia were brought along; a number of Shapers also followed Barzahl. Zakary remained in Drypeak to provide a front for the experimentation and rogue serviles which lay beyond the tunnel. Barzahl moved further into the valleys to build settlements and run experiments. Repeated use of the canisters can render the user cold, detached and possibly mad. When Zakary saw this happening to Barzahl the pair argued, Zakary regretted his part in the deceit. This occurred a year before the arrival of Shanti and the apprentice, Zakary had lost contact with Barzahl since the argument. Zakary pledges his loyalty to the <b>Shaper</b> Council once more and asks for help from the apprentice in dealing with what lies beyond the guarded cave.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Traffic shaping is a {{well-known}} technique {{in the area of}} networking and is proven to reduce global buffer require-ments and end-to-end delays in networked systems. Due to these properties, <b>shapers</b> also play an increasingly important role in the design of multi-processor embedded systems that exhibit a consid-erable amount of on-chip traffic. Despite their growing importance in this area, no methods exist to analyze <b>shapers</b> in distributed em-bedded systems, and to incorporate them into a system-level per-formance analysis. Hence it is until now not possible to determine the effect of <b>shapers</b> to end-to-end delay guarantees or buffer re-quirements in these systems. In this work, we present a method to analyze greedy <b>shapers,</b> and we embed this analysis method into a well-established modular performance analysis framework. The presented approach enables system-level performance analysis of complete systems with greedy <b>shapers,</b> and we prove its applica-bility by analyzing two case study systems. ...|$|R
5|$|Charles XI has {{sometimes}} been described in Sweden as {{the greatest of all}} the Swedish kings, except for Gustavus II Adolphus, unduly eclipsed by his father and his son. In {{the first half of the}} 20th century, the view of him changed and he was regarded as dependent, uncertain, and easily influenced by others. In the most recent book, Rystads biography from 2003, the king is again characterized as a strong-willed <b>shaper</b> of Sweden through economic reforms and achievement of financial and military stability and strength.|$|E
5|$|In 1910, {{he moved}} to Springfield, Vermont {{to work as a}} {{mechanical}} engineer for the Fellows Gear <b>Shaper</b> Company. He was already friendly with James Hartness, the president of the Jones & Lamson Machine Company (J), another company in town. In 1911, Flanders married Hartness' daughter, Helen. Shortly afterwards, Hartness hired Flanders as a manager of the department at J that built the Fay automatic lathe. Flanders redesigned that lathe to achieve higher productivity and accuracy. He became a director in 1912 and president of the company in 1933 after Hartness retired.|$|E
5|$|The Sandmans main {{character}} is Dream, the titular Sandman, also known to various characters throughout the series as Morpheus, Oneiros, the <b>Shaper,</b> the <b>Shaper</b> of Form, Lord of the Dreaming, the Dream King, Dream-Sneak, the Cat of Dreams, Murphy, Kai'ckul and Lord L'Zoril, {{who is the}} anthropomorphic personification of dreams. At {{the start of the}} series, Morpheus is captured by an occult ritual and held prisoner for 70 years. Morpheus escapes in the modern day and, after avenging himself upon his captors, sets about rebuilding his kingdom, which has fallen into disrepair in his absence. The character's initial haughty and often cruel manner begins to soften after his years of imprisonment {{at the start of the}} series, but the challenge of undoing past sins and changing old ways is an enormous one for a being who has been set in his ways for billions of years. In its beginnings, the series is a very dark horror comic. Later, the series evolves into an elaborate fantasy series, incorporating elements of classical and contemporary mythology, ultimately placing its protagonist in the role of a tragic hero.|$|E

5|$|After {{exploring}} {{a number of}} the game's locations, the apprentice gains access to a guarded tunnel and is astonished to discover what lies on the other side. Whereas the valley where Drypeak is located is a dustbowl devoid of vegetation, the lands {{on the other side of}} the tunnel are lush and green, meaning highly illegal shaping is taking place in secret. Serviles, the Shapers' slaves created from life essence, show abnormal intelligence and self-awareness. While still reeling from the revelation of what lies beyond Drypeak, the <b>Shaper</b> apprentice discovers that Shanti has disappeared during one of her escapes from her armed escorts, her necklace lay broken on the grass outside the tunnel. At this point, approximately a quarter of the way through the game, the player's choices expand considerably.|$|E
5|$|Broaches {{are shaped}} {{similar to a}} saw, except {{the height of the}} teeth {{increases}} over the length of the tool. Moreover, the broach contains three distinct sections: one for roughing, another for semi-finishing, and the final one for finishing. Broaching is an unusual machining process because it has the feed built into the tool. The profile of the machined surface is always the inverse of the profile of the broach. The rise per tooth (RPT), also known as the step or feed per tooth, determines the amount of material removed {{and the size of the}} chip. The broach can be moved relative to the workpiece or vice versa. Because all of the features are built into the broach, no complex motion or skilled labor is required to use it. A broach is effectively a collection of single-point cutting tools arrayed in sequence, cutting one after the other; its cut is analogous to multiple passes of a <b>shaper.</b>|$|E
5|$|Essence is {{used for}} both {{creating}} creatures and casting spells; the number, type and strength of creations {{is limited by the}} player's essence capacity. For instance, if a character with 70 maximum essence summons a creature which costs 20 essence, their maximum essence is reduced to 50 until the creation is destroyed, either through combat or being absorbed by the <b>Shaper</b> to regain essence. A total of 18 different creations are featured in the game, with larger and more powerful creatures costing more essence to create. The types and strengths of creations can be altered depending on the player's combat style. Creations accompanying the player receive a percentage of the experience points received for completing quests or defeating foes, levelling up and receiving skill points {{in the same manner as}} the player character. These skill points can be spent to increase creations' statistics, but every statistic increase costs more essence and reduces the amount of essence available to summon other creations or cast spells. Essence and health are regained from Shaper-designed pools or by entering a friendly town.|$|E

5|$|Exploration of {{the docks}} reveals a strange {{canister}} filled with swirling liquid. Thinking the canister contains healing or energizing properties, the <b>Shaper</b> breaks the seal and absorbs the contents. Instead the contents absorb into the Shaper's body, strengthening and changing it. The changes become visibly apparent, the player character's skin smoothens and glows slightly. The canisters also affect the user's mental state, causing a more violent and arrogant temperament. Serviles {{remain on the}} island, having been abandoned when the island was Barred. They are intelligent creations of Shapers, designed to serve them without question or hesitation. These Serviles have had no contact with Shapers for two centuries, and have separated into three groups with differing philosophies regarding their creators. The Obeyers are still faithful to the Shapers, the Awakened believe {{that they should be}} treated as equals. The Takers have rejected Shapers completely and view the sect as oppressors to be fought.|$|E
25|$|In the {{two-point}} linear implosion, {{the nuclear}} fuel is cast into a solid shape and placed within {{the center of}} a cylinder of high explosive. Detonators are placed {{at either end of the}} explosive cylinder, and a plate-like insert, or <b>shaper,</b> is placed in the explosive just inside the detonators. When the detonators are fired, the initial detonation is trapped between the <b>shaper</b> and the end of the cylinder, causing it to travel out to the edges of the <b>shaper</b> where it is diffracted around the edges into the main mass of explosive. This causes the detonation to form into a ring that proceeds inwards from the <b>shaper.</b>|$|E
