50|$|The <b>switched</b> <b>reluctance</b> <b>motor</b> (SRM) {{is a form}} of {{stepper motor}} that uses fewer poles. The SRM has the lowest {{construction}} cost of any industrial electric motor because of its simple structure. Common uses for an SRM include applications where the rotor must be held stationary for long periods, and in potentially explosive environments such as mining because it does not have a mechanical commutator.|$|E
50|$|There are {{3 phases}} in an {{asymmetric}} bridge converter {{corresponding to the}} phases of the <b>switched</b> <b>reluctance</b> <b>motor.</b> If both of the power switches {{on either side of}} the phase are turned on, then that corresponding phase shall be actuated. Once the current has risen above the set value, the switch shall turn off. The energy now stored within the motor winding shall now maintain the current in the same direction until that energy is depleted.|$|E
50|$|The <b>switched</b> <b>reluctance</b> <b>motor</b> (SRM) {{is a type}} of a stepper motor, an {{electric}} motor that runs by reluctance torque. Unlike common DC motor types, power is delivered to windings in the stator (case) rather than the rotor. This greatly simplifies mechanical design as power {{does not have to be}} delivered to a moving part, but it complicates the electrical design as some sort of switching system needs to be used to deliver power to the different windings. With modern electronic devices, precisely timed switching is not a problem, and the SRM is a popular design for modern stepper motors. Its main drawback is torque ripple. However, motor company Striatech developed controller technology that limits torque ripple with the same high torque at low speeds shown in switched reluctance.|$|E
