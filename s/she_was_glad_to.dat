5|$|Although having reached legal {{retirement}} age in 1927, and thus unable {{to be offered}} another five-year contract, Murray was reappointed {{on an annual basis}} each year until 1935. At this point, she retired, expressing the opinion that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> leave UCL, for reasons that she did not make clear. In 1933, Petrie had retired from UCL and moved to Jerusalem in Mandatory Palestine with his wife; Murray therefore took over as editor of the Ancient Egypt journal, renaming it Ancient Egypt and the East to reflect its increasing research interest in the ancient societies that surrounded and interacted with Egypt. The journal folded in 1935, perhaps due to Murray's retirement. Murray then spent some time in Jerusalem, where she aided the Petries in their excavation at Tall al-Ajjul, a Bronze Age mound south of Gaza.|$|E

2500|$|When King George III succeeded to {{the throne}} of Great Britain upon {{the death of his}} grandfather, George II, he was 22 years old and unmarried. His mother and advisors were anxious to have him settled in marriage. The 17-year-old Princess Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz appealed to him as a {{prospective}} consort partly because she had been brought up in an insignificant north German duchy and therefore would probably have had no experience or interest in power politics or party intrigues. That proved to be the case; to make sure, he instructed her shortly after their wedding [...] "not to meddle," [...] a precept <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> follow.|$|E

Rebecca Bowden, of Yahoo! commented that during the episodes Callum is [...] "acting like an absolute idiot, and it's making me really start to hate his character", citing Callum's reaction to Holly's ordeal and his lack of care for others as her reason for this. Bowden felt that Callum's death was a shock, explaining that the graphic nature would not have suited the pre-watershed main show. She added that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> see Callum die, although she commented that during the series he [...] "lost his personality for a little while".|$|E
2500|$|In 1996, the Santorums' son Gabriel {{was born}} prematurely after 20 weeks of {{pregnancy}} {{and died in}} the hospital two hours later. Karen wrote that she and Rick slept with the dead infant between them in the hospital that night, then brought him home the following day and introduced him to their other children as [...] "your brother Gabriel". Fifteen years later, their handling of their infant son's death attracted scrutiny in January 2012 following Santorum's success in the Iowa caucuses. One psychologist interviewed by ABC News said what the Santorums did was encouraged at the time, although no longer recommended; another told the media outlet: [...] "It's not far out of the norm at all... There is nothing pathological about it or particularly alarming." [...] Writers who had experienced a stillbirth defended the Santorums' actions, with columnist Charles Lane writing that he personally regretted not showing the body of his stillborn baby to his then six-year-old son, and Jessica Heslam, writing that holding her own stillborn baby brought her [...] "much peace". The four eldest children appeared with their parents on Piers Morgan Tonight in January 2012.
