25|$|The rifle's sights {{were placed}} {{relatively}} {{low over the}} bore axis to ensure a minimal silhouette when firing from the prone position (the shooter presents a 20% smaller target than with the Stgw 57), but high enough to provide comfort and speed when shouldering the rifle in the kneeling and offhand shooting positions. The design of the <b>shoulder</b> <b>stock</b> also facilitates the rapid alignment of the shooting eye with the rifle's line of sight.|$|E
25|$|These early prototypes, {{initially}} designated wz. 1981, were {{modeled on}} the Soviet 5.45mm AK-74 assault rifle and emphasized {{a high degree of}} parts commonality with the AKM rifle. As the weapon was intended to be able to launch rifle grenades, a newly designed, multi-functional muzzle device and a sturdier folding <b>shoulder</b> <b>stock</b> were used (the wire stock is a copy of the wire stock used on the East German MPi-KMS-72 rifle). Additionally, the wz. 81 was equipped with a mechanically limited burst fire mode, borrowed from the AKMS wz. 1980 prototype developed in the late 1970s by OBR.|$|E
500|$|The gray, white, and red Menacer {{is a light}} gun {{peripheral}} for the Sega Genesis. The Menacer {{is built}} of three separable parts: a pistol, twin sights, and <b>shoulder</b> <b>stock.</b> (In the peripheral's branding, these parts were called the Master Module, Binocular Module, and Stabilizer Module, respectively.) The pistol has a double grip and fires the infrared beam with a trigger on the back grip. There are three buttons on the pistol's front grip: one pauses {{the game and the}} other two provide game-specific functions. Unlike the Super Scope, the Menacer has two infrared transmitters. The optional skeletal <b>shoulder</b> <b>stock</b> and binocular twin sights were designed to improve the aim. Digital Spy reported that the twin sights never worked as intended, and Sega Force wrote that the gun must be recalibrated when adding or removing the sights. Calibration is performed by aiming at a bullseye target to adjust the gun's sensitivity. The gun was designed to be reassembled to suit the player.|$|E
50|$|The Third Model Dragoon numbers {{stand at}} ten-thousand from 1851 through 1860. This design had more {{variations}} {{as compared to}} its earlier counterparts. Some of the third model Colt Dragoon Revolvers had frame cuts for detachable <b>shoulder</b> <b>stocks,</b> horizontal loading lever latches and folding leaf sights. Third Colt Dragoon Revolvers had a round trigger guard. Government records showed an order for 8,390 Dragoons.|$|R

50|$|Almost all long-arms have front grips (forearms) and <b>shoulder</b> <b>stocks,</b> which {{provides}} the user {{the ability to}} hold the firearm more steadily than a handgun. In addition, the long barrel of a long gun usually provides a longer distance between {{the front and rear}} sights, providing the user with more precision when aiming. The presence of a stock makes the use of a telescopic sight or red dot sight easier than with a hand gun.|$|R

500|$|In his book, Lake {{wrote about}} the Colt Buntline Special, a variant of long-barreled Colt Single Action Army revolver. According to Lake's biography, dime novelist Ned Buntline had five Buntline Specials commissioned. Lake {{described}} them as extra-long Colt Single Action Army revolvers with [...] barrels. Buntline {{was supposed to have}} presented them to lawmen in thanks for their help with contributing [...] "local color" [...] to his western yarns. According to Lake, the pistol was equipped with a detachable metal <b>shoulder</b> <b>stock.</b> Lake wrote that Earp and four other well-known western lawmen—Bat Masterson, Bill Tilghman, Charlie Bassett and Neal Brown—each received a Buntline Special. However, neither Tilghman nor Brown were lawmen then.|$|E

5000|$|Stuart N. Lake, in his largely fictionalized {{biography}} Wyatt Earp: Frontier Marshal (1931), {{wrote that}} Earp {{and four other}} well-known western lawmen—Bat Masterson, Bill Tilghman, Charlie Bassett, and Neal Brown—each received a Colt Single Action Army revolver as a gift from Buntline, in thanks for their help in contributing local color to his western yarns. The revolvers {{were said to be}} chambered in [...]45 Colt with 12-inch barrels, removable <b>shoulder</b> <b>stocks,</b> standard sights, and wooden grips into which the name Ned was ornately carved. These revolvers came to be known collectively as the Buntline Special. According to Lake, Earp kept his at the original 12-inch length, but the four other recipients of the revolvers cut their barrels down to 7½ inches. Modern researchers have not found any evidence in secondary sources or primary documents of the gun's existence prior to the publication of Lake's book.|$|R

2500|$|Configurations of grips {{and stocks}} for riot {{shotguns}} vary widely, but often feature reinforced plastic [...] "furniture" [...] {{instead of the}} wood common on hunting firearms. Wood was used for riot gun stocks in the past, and sometimes still is. As compared to hunting shotguns, riot guns more often feature pistol grips, {{with or without a}} <b>shoulder</b> <b>stock.</b> Without a <b>shoulder</b> <b>stock</b> (or with a folding stock), a riot shotgun becomes more compact and thus is able to be brought to bear more rapidly in very close quarters. With the stock, the pistol grip facilitates control of the weapon and provides a more ergonomic grip when the shotgun is fired from the shoulder. Foregrips, or forends, also vary, often with the inclusion of a pistol-grip fore-end (further increasing control and absorbing recoil), and/or the addition of an accessory rail or other mounting point for a tactical light.|$|E
2500|$|The Beretta 93R is a {{significantly}} redesigned 92 {{to provide the}} option of firing in three-round bursts. [...] It also has a longer ported barrel, heavier slide, fitting for a <b>shoulder</b> <b>stock,</b> a folding forward grip, and an extended magazine. Unlike other Berettas in the 90 series it is single-action only, {{does not have a}} decocker, and very few are around today.|$|E
2500|$|The Bizon also {{utilizes}} the AKS-74 <b>shoulder</b> <b>stock.</b> It folds to {{the left}} side of the receiver but unlike the AKS-74 and AKS-74U, it is not held closed by a spring-loaded capture in the forward end of the receiver. Instead, it is held closed by the forward trunnion pin which is longer on the Bizon than on its AKS-74 predecessors. [...] The extended length of the pin allows it to catch the folding skeleton stock. The pistol grip is identical to the grip on the AK-100 series and is made of a black fiberglass-reinforced polyamide.|$|E
5000|$|In 1880 the South Australia Police, {{who were}} then {{interested}} in re-arming with up-to-date weapons, noted {{a display of}} New Model Number Three revolvers at the Australian Exposition in Melbourne. At the direction of Police Commissioner Peterswald an order was placed through S&W's New York agent for 250 nickel revolvers in [...]44 Russian with a seven-inch barrel length. The order, which included extension <b>shoulder</b> <b>stocks,</b> ammunition, and reloading kits, arrived at Adelaide in March 1882. The revolvers and stocks were thereupon marked with a government broad arrow punch mark, and were called revolver-carbines. They were issued to mounted police, known as troopers, who at that period also policed the Northern Territory. Both the South Australia and Western Australia police made further small purchases during 1886-88, none of which was marked with the broad arrow. For some thirty years the revolver-carbine was the front line weapon of the mounted police of S.A., W.A., and N.T. Nearly all serial numbers are known, and {{are listed in the}} book Service Arms of the South Australian Police. The S.A. revolvers were sold as surplus in 1953 to the Western Arms Corporation of Los Angeles.|$|R
50|$|France {{declined}} {{to adopt the}} Hi-Power for its armed forces, instead using the Modèle 1935 pistol. Despite this rejection, the Hi-Power was a sales success with more than 56,000 produced by May 1940, mostly for the Belgian military. It was used extensively in World War II by many nations including the British Commonwealth and Chinese forces. More than 65,000 Hi-Power pistols were also used by German forces, renamed Pistole 640(b), after the Nazis captured FN's manufacturing plant in Liège on May 12, 1940.Saive fled the German invasion, eventually arriving in London in mid-1941. He was soon at work at the Enfield Design Department at the Drill Hall in Cheshunt, England, recreating production drawings for the Hi-Power and further developing his design for a gas-operated rifle called the EXP-1, later the FN Model 1949. By June 1943, the British modified Saive's technical drawings to produce the Mk. I U.K. model of the Hi-Power.In April 1943, China requested 180,000 Hi-Powers with hollow wooden <b>shoulder</b> <b>stocks</b> that also served as holsters through a Mutual Aid Plan with Canada. The Chinese {{were familiar with the}} C96 Mauser Broomhandle that came with a stock/holster and wanted the same thing for the Hi-Powers they requested. The Canadian contract was with the Inglis firm who hired Dieudonné Saive and Rene Laloux, both Belgian engineers, to work on production. After the war, the Browning Hi-Power was adopted as the standard military service sidearm of many Western countries, including the United Kingdom and Australia. Slightly modernized versions remain in production today, three-quarters of a century later.|$|R
50|$|The Jatimatic lacks {{a folding}} stock common for {{this class of}} firearm; the weapon is instead fired {{unsupported}} from the hip or raised arm, without resting the firearm on the shooter's <b>shoulder.</b> However, aftermarket <b>stocks</b> are available which fasten to the lower side of the pistol grip and give it much greater accuracy, while also protecting the rear sight from being bent or broken.|$|R
2500|$|The {{distinctive}} {{characteristics of}} the C96 are the integral box magazine {{in front of the}} trigger, the long barrel, the wooden <b>shoulder</b> <b>stock</b> which gives it the stability of a short-barreled rifle and doubles as a holster or carrying case, and a unique grip shaped like the handle of a broom. The grip earned the gun the nickname [...] "Broomhandle" [...] in the English-speaking world because of its round wooden handle, and in China the C96 was nicknamed the [...] "box cannon" [...] (...) because of its rectangular internal magazine and the fact it could be holstered in its wooden box-like detachable stock.|$|E
2500|$|In 1970, the Policia Militar do Rio de Janeiro (PMRJ) {{asked the}} {{services}} of Jener Damau Arroyo, a Spanish-born gunsmith, to make modifications on their PASAMs {{in order to improve}} their handling. The first modification (PASAM MOD-1), of which 101 were modified, received a metal frame extension welded to the magazine housing. It was fitted with a metal forward grip well ahead of the gun under the muzzle. The original grip was left alone, making it compatible with the wooden holster/stock. The second modification (PASAM MOD-2), involving 89 pistols, featured a similar frame extension, but the forward grip had wooden panels and was of different shape. The pistol grip frame used thicker rectangular wooden grips and had a [...] "t-bar" [...] metal <b>shoulder</b> <b>stock</b> welded to it. A metal frame attached to the receiver supported a rectangular wooden foregrip, taking pressure off the barrel. In both models, of course, the barrel was left free so as to enable it to do its short recoil during firing. For the record, 295 PASAMs were left in the original condition. It took standard detachable 10-round box magazines, although they can also take the extended 20- and 40-round magazines.|$|E
2500|$|The Akdal MKA 1919 is a gas operated, {{semi-automatic}} shotgun {{that resembles}} the M16 rifle and mimics the layout and placement {{of some of}} the controls. It was created by Turkish company Akdal Arms. [...] The MKA 1919 uses a conventional gas-operated action which is located around the support tube that runs below the barrel. The return spring is also located around the same support tube which is concealed by an enlarged polymer handguard. The MKA 1919 barrel can be quickly removed from upper receiver. To charge the rifle, the charging handle on the receiver must be pulled. The upper receiver is manufactured from an aluminum alloy while the lower receiver, along with pistol grip and <b>shoulder</b> <b>stock,</b> is manufactured as one piece from impact-resistant polymer. Akdal MKA 1919 semi-automatic rifle has a 5-round detachable box magazine. It has a bolt release identical in location and [...] function to the one on the M16. Manual safety also duplicates M16-style being located {{on the left side of}} the receiver above the pistol grip. Standard sights include a front post installed on the M16-style removable base and a detachable M16A2-style carrying handle with built-in diopter sight. On the upper receiver, an integral Picatinny rail exists which will accept detachable carrying handle or optional red-dot or other optical sight attachments.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} special feature of a sniper rifle stock is the {{adjustable}} cheek piece, where the shooter's cheek meets {{the rear of}} the stock. For most rifles equipped with a telescopic sight, this area is raised slightly, because the telescope is positioned higher than iron sights. A cheek piece is simply a section of the stock that can be adjusted up or down to suit the individual shooter. To further aid this individual fitting, the stock can sometimes also be adjusted for length, often by varying the number of inserts at {{the rear of the}} stock where it meets the shooter's <b>shoulder.</b> Sniper <b>stocks</b> are typically designed to avoid making contact with the barrel of the weapon.|$|R
50|$|The {{retractable}} metal stock (made from {{strips of}} flat bar) is {{ended with a}} pivoting <b>shoulder</b> pad.

5000|$|The UK first {{selected}} the Diemaco C8 {{in the mid}} 1990s as the Special Forces Individual Weapon. This selection was later reconfirmed in the mid 2000s, by which time Diemaco had become Colt Canada. The weapon is so well-liked, reliable and successful that the planned competition to seek a replacement of the C8 from 2014 has been deferred in favour of continuing with the C8. Use of the C8 has expanded to include, among others, the original SAS and SBS, the Special Forces Support Group, the Pathfinder Platoon of 16 Air Assault Brigade, 43 Commando Fleet Protection Group, Royal Military Police Close Protection teams and MoD Police. There are about 2,500 in service. A number of barrel lengths are available for different users and most weapons are now fitted with Knights Armaments Rail Adapter System handguards and Picatinny rail flat-top upper receivers. Most users fit Trijicon ACOG x4 sights with CQB reflex attachment, but other sights are used. Various laser, light, downgrip and other attachments are used. Surefire vortex-type flash hiders are generally fitted, and suppressors are available. The standard Canadian bayonet is issued, but rarely used. Coloured furniture is becoming commonplace. The UK very much prefers polymer magazines to metal on grounds of weight and reliability and has now standardised on these for all C8 and operational SA80 users, with well over a million magazines purchased. Many weapons are fitted with the L17A1 underslung 40mm grenade launcher (UGL), the UK designation for the Heckler & Koch AG-C.

He would throw it about a foot in front of the student, so that it would rise 10 or 12 feet and then fall straight down again. McDaniel would tell the student to hold his gun at a high port-arms (diagonally in front of him with the barrel tilted up) initially, and to be look up in the air. When the washer entered the student's field of view, he would focus upon it and follow its flight, and move both forearms to pivot the gun to seat the butt against his <b>shoulder,</b> with the <b>stock</b> against his cheek, and pull the trigger the instant the gun was seated.|$|R
