Metallica decided to broaden its <b>sonic</b> <b>range,</b> writing songs with multiple sections, heavy guitar arpeggios and unusual time signatures.

BBC Music's Eamonn Stack wrote that …And Justice for All sounds different from the band's previous albums, with longer songs, sparser arrangements, and harsher vocals by Hetfield. According to journalist Martin Popoff, the album was less melodic than its predecessors because of its frequent tempo changes, unusual song structures and layered guitars. He argued that the album {{is more of a}} progressive metal record because of its intricately performed music and bleak sound. Music writer Joel McIver called the album's music aggressive enough for Metallica to maintain its place with bands [...] "at the mellower end of extreme metal". According to writer Christopher Knowles, Metallica took [...] "the thrash concept to its logical conclusion" [...] on the album.|$|E

40|$|A {{multifunction}} sonde {{designed to}} detect anomalous structure in horizontal gas drainage boreholes in coal has been developed. The sonde is manoeuvered in the borehole using the drill string and rig, and is remote-controlled {{to provide a}} semi-continuous suite of geophysical logs including seismic, caliper, natural gamma, spontaneous potential, resistivity, and survey. Logs are available in real time via a standard CCITT modem protocol. The seismic log is obtained from a piezoelectric source which can be pulsed at any rate from 1 to 30 Hz, detected by an array of six hydrophones with remotely switched gain in the range 24 to 90 dB, and bandwidth 300 Hz to 100 kHz. Selected sections of detected waveforms are sampled to 10 bit accuracy and averaged over up to 16, 000 firings of the source providing good random noise rejection. Preliminary field testing of the sonde {{has shown that the}} combination of caliper, resistivity and gamma logs provide good correlations on basic structure. Performance of the seismic log was limited in gas-filled holes but where liquid-filled conditions were available both refracted path (normal velocity logging) and reflected path (<b>sonic</b> <b>ranging)</b> logs were obtained. <b>Sonic</b> <b>ranging</b> logs, allowing location of floor or roof of the coal seam at distances of up to 4 m from the borehole, have been demonstrated for crosshole logs and should also be possible from a single borehole...|$|R

This system is advantageous for wave amplitude measurements from a moving towing carriage since the sensing elements or its supports do not disturb the water surface. The design operation range of the instrument is 2 -in. to 2 -ft wave height. The accuracy of measurement depends on the incremental slope of the water surface {{at the point of}} measurement. An intrinsic error of +/- 0. 8 per cent average over the wave would occur for a 2 -ft wave with a slope at mid-height of 0. 2.

5000|$|A {{defining}} attribute {{largely responsible}} for the 5150 sound is the fixed bias. Commonly described analog a car engine and its respective idle, the 5150 bias was set to a lower value (lower engine [...] "idle") which resulted in the Power Tubes running at a lower energy commonly known as [...] "cold-biased." [...] While the electrical theory behind this can easily be examined and theoreticized, the 5150 and its configuration resulted in a more controllable gain setting (ie. having a more forgiving <b>sonic</b> <b>range</b> than similarly [...] "hot-biased" [...] configurations. This engineering choice set the 5150 up to intrinsically sound its best with minimal augmentation. Since tube-amps are still uncontested in music amplification as far as tonal quality is concerned, (see hard-clipping) the optimal setting for tubes are when they are pushed to natural distortion (ie. Increases in [...] "volume" [...] or Bells(dB).) Thus, by allowing such a heavy amount of gain to be applied without sacrificing tonal definition, the amplifier could then be pushed due to the [...] "colder" [...] biasing requiring more current, versus a [...] "hotter" [...] setting from the beginning (volume knob or potentiometer knob [...] "value of 1.") ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{detection}} of swallowing events by acoustic means represents {{an important tool}} to assess and diagnose swallowing disorders {{as well as to}} objectively monitor ingestive behavior of individuals. Acoustic sensors used to register swallowing sounds may also capture sound artifacts arising from intrinsic speech and external noise affecting the detection. In this paper we tested if subsonic frequencies are less prone to artifacts from speech, chewing and other intrinsic sounds than sonic frequencies. A simple method using a throat and an ambient microphone was employed to compare the swallowing detection accuracy by acoustic signals acquired in the sonic (20 - 2500 Hz) and subsonic (≤ 5 Hz) ranges. Averaged recall values were higher than 85 % for both ranges. However, averaged precision values of 50 % for subsonic frequencies and of 42 % for sonic frequencies were caused by a high number of false positives. These results indicated no significant difference between averaged precision values which may suggest that subsonic frequencies were not less prone to intrinsic sound artifacts than frequencies in the <b>sonic</b> <b>range.</b> Further examination {{with the addition of a}} signal classification layer is proposed as a future step to confirm this statement.

40|$|The {{supersonic}} {{method of}} cleaning glassware is {{an outgrowth of}} the fact that it has been heretofore impossible to manually clean ground glass and quartz joints because the activity became lodged in the small pores of the ground surfaces. It has been theorized that the nature of the forces binding polonium to the glass is similar to that of the chemical bond but are less intense. The problem then becomes one of finding a force greater than this binding energy, capable of freeing the activity from the glass. This has been accomplished by using frequencies of 100 cycles to 20 kc at a power output from 2 to 20 watts, passing through a citric acid solution (pH- 2) into which the contaminated article is placed. The optimum results, using a tank with the dimensions 7 in. {times} 7 in. {times} 7 in. and 3 liters of solution, has been found at 200 cycles or harmonics of 200 cycles.

40|$|We {{recorded}} the auditory brainstem response (ABR) in four dolphins (Tursiops truncatus and Delphinus delphis). The ABR evoked by clicks consists of seven waves within 10 msec; two waves often contain dual peaks. The main waves {{can be identified}} with those of humans and laboratory mammals; {{in spite of a}} much longer path, the latencies of the peaks are almost identical to those of the rat. The dolphin ABR waves increase in latency as the intensity of a sound decreases by only 4 microseconds/decibel(dB) (for clicks with peak power at 66 kHz) compared to 40 microseconds/dB in humans (for clicks in the <b>sonic</b> <b>range).</b> Low-frequency clicks (6 -kHz peak power) show a latency increase about 3 times (12 microseconds/dB) as great. Although the dolphin brainstem tracks individual clicks to at least 600 per sec, the latency increases and amplitude decreases with increasing click rates. This effect varies among different waves of the ABR; it is around one-fifth the effect seen in man. The dolphin brain is specialized for handling brief, frequent clicks. A small latency difference is seen between clicks 180 degrees different in phase [...] i. e., with initial compression vs. initial rarefaction. The ABR can be used to test theories of dolphin sonar signal processing. Hearing thresholds can be evaluated rapidly.

40|$|Acoustic stimuli {{within the}} <b>sonic</b> <b>range</b> are {{effective}} triggers of C-type escape behaviours in fish. We have previously shown that fish have an acute sensitivity to infrasound also, with acceleration thresholds {{in the range}} of 10 (- 5) m s(- 2). In addition, infrasound at high intensities around 10 (- 2) m s(- 2) elicits strong and sustained avoidance responses in several fish species. In the present study, the possible triggering of C-escapes by infrasonic single-cycle vibrations was examined in juvenile roach Rutilus rutilus. The fish were accelerated in a controlled and quantifiable manner using a swing system. The applied stimuli simulated essential components of the accelerations that a small fish would encounter in the hydrodynamic flow field produced by a predatory fish. Typical C- and S-type escape responses were induced by accelerations within the infrasonic range with a threshold of 0. 023 m s(- 2) for an initial acceleration at 6. 7 Hz. Response trajectories were on average {{in the same direction as}} the initial acceleration. Unexpectedly, startle behaviours mainly occurred in the trailing half of the test chamber, in which the fish were subjected to linear acceleration in combination with compression, i. e. the expected stimuli produced by an approaching predator. Very few responses were observed in the leading half of the test chamber, where the fish were subjected to acceleration and rarefaction, i. e. the stimuli expected from a suction type of predator. We conclude that particle acceleration is essential for the directionality of the startle response to infrasound, and that the response is triggered by the synergistic effects of acceleration and compression...|$|E
40|$|Theoretical and {{numerical}} results {{based on}} the integral-differential equation {{for the form of}} an unsteady axisymmetrical supercavity and obtained with the use of slender body theory are reviewed. This theory is also employed for the calculation of the axisymmetric bodies with a pressure distribution prescribed over the surface, for the study of some principal hydrodynamical problems (for example, can the pressure gradient be positive at the body surface to provide an unseparated flow pattern and to improve the characteristics of the cavitation inception?), for the analysis of the unstable solutions and the corresponding restrictions on the flow parameters and for the investigation of the capillarity influence. The calculations of shapes of a slender axisymmetric steady cavity in the subsonic and supersonic cases are presented. It is shown that the fluid compressibility has little effect on extents of the supercavity, but increases sufficiently the pressure drag in the <b>sonic</b> <b>range</b> of Mach numbers. Methods for numerical simulation of axisymmetric and plane cavities in ideal incompressible fluid, {{based on the}} potentials of sources and doublets located in the axis of symmetry are suggested.
