5|$|Around 1830, Providence had {{manufacturing}} {{industries in}} metals, machinery, textiles, jewelry, and silverware. Manufacturing has declined since, {{but the city}} is <b>still</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the largest centers for jewelry and silverware design and manufacturing. Services also make up {{a large portion of}} the city's economy, in particular education, healthcare, and finance. Providence also is the site of a sectional center facility (SCF), a regional hub for the U.S. Postal Service. It is the capital of Rhode Island, so the city's economy additionally consists of government services.|$|E
5|$|Because of its low {{atomic number}} and very low {{absorption}} for X-rays, {{the oldest and}} <b>still</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the most important applications of beryllium is in radiation windows for X-ray tubes. Extreme demands are placed on purity and cleanliness of beryllium to avoid artifacts in the X-ray images. Thin beryllium foils are used as radiation windows for X-ray detectors, and the extremely low absorption minimizes the heating effects caused by high intensity, low energy X-rays typical of synchrotron radiation. Vacuum-tight windows and beam-tubes for radiation experiments on synchrotrons are manufactured exclusively from beryllium. In scientific setups for various X-ray emission studies (e.g., energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy) the sample holder is usually made of beryllium because its emitted X-rays have much lower energies (~100eV) than X-rays from most studied materials.|$|E
5|$|It is {{the only}} Bond film to be {{directed}} by Peter R. Hunt, who {{had served as a}} film editor and second unit director on previous films in the series. Hunt, along with producers Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman, decided to produce a more realistic film that would follow the novel closely. It was shot in Switzerland, England, and Portugal from October 1968 to May 1969. Although its cinema release was not as lucrative as its predecessor You Only Live Twice, On Her Majesty's Secret Service was <b>still</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the top performing films of the year. Critical reviews upon release were mixed, but the film's reputation has improved greatly over time.|$|E

5|$|Mary Dudley {{was one of}} Queen Elizabeth's most {{intimate}} confidantes {{during the early years}} of her reign. Her duties included nursing the Queen through smallpox in 1563 and acting as her mouthpiece towards diplomats. A sister of Elizabeth's favourite, Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, she remained always loyal to her family. She was the mother of seven children and accompanied her husband, Sir Henry Sidney, to Ireland and the Welsh Marches. From the 1570s the couple complained repeatedly about their, as they saw it, niggardly treatment at the Queen's hands. <b>Still</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> Elizabeth's favourite ladies, Mary Dudley retired from court life in 1579, suffering from ill health during her last years.|$|E
5|$|The {{all-time record}} between the clubs stood at 3–2 {{in favor of}} Seattle.

Seattle had recently lost three of five MLS matches but was <b>still</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the best teams in the league. Seattle was the favorite, with one pundit comparing Philadelphia to perennial underdog Rocky Balboa of the film series Rocky.|$|E

5|$|The theatre {{became part}} of the West End theatre scene and still stages popular musical {{productions}}. Later long runs at the theatre include productions of A Chorus Line (1976–1979), 42nd Street (1984–1989), Miss Saigon (1989–1999, the theatre's longest-running show), The Producers (2004–2007), an original musical, The Lord of the Rings (2007–2008), Oliver! (2009–2011) and Shrek the Musical (2011–2013). Charlie and the Chocolate Factory the Musical played from 2013 through January 2017. The Drury Lane is owned and managed by Really Useful Theatres, owned by Andrew Lloyd Webber. The seating plan for the theatre remains the same and the auditorium is <b>still</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the largest in London's West End. The building was Grade I listed in February 1958. It is one of the 40 theatres featured in the 2012 DVD documentary series Great West End Theatres, presented by Donald Sinden.|$|E
5|$|Though it is {{the least}} {{reactive}} of the halogens, iodine is <b>still</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the more reactive elements. For example, while chlorine gas will halogenate carbon monoxide, nitrogen monoxide, and sulfur dioxide to phosgene, nitrosyl chloride, and sulfuryl chloride respectively, iodine will not do so. Furthermore, iodination of metals tends to result in lower oxidation states than chlorination or bromination; for example, rhenium metal reacts with chlorine to form rhenium hexachloride, but with bromine it forms only rhenium pentabromide and iodine can achieve only rhenium tetraiodide. By the same token, however, since iodine has the lowest ionisation energy among the halogens and is the most easily oxidised of them, it has a more significant cationic chemistry and its higher oxidation states are rather more stable than those of bromine and chlorine, for example in iodine heptafluoride.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{his return}} to office, Kogălniceanu {{personally}} organized conspiratorial meetings with the Russian diplomat Aleksandr Nelidov, and approved Russian demands in exchange for co-belligerency. With C. A. Rosetti and Brătianu, he supported the transit of Russian troops and persuaded Carol to accept the Russian alliance, contrary to the initial advice of the Crown Council. He also sought advice on this matter from the French Third Republic, who was <b>still</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the powers supervising Romania; Louis, duc Decazes, the French Foreign Minister, declined {{to give him a}} reassuring answer, and pointed that, were Romania to join up with Russia, the other powers would cease offering their protection. Making note of this, Kogălniceanu expressed his hope that France would still support his country at the decisive moment.|$|E
5|$|All five forts {{and three}} battery positionsLeåkersberget, Norra Åberget and Södra Slumpbergetwere {{declared}} historic {{buildings in the}} summer of 1998 and are to be preserved for the future. The balloon hangar, the only of its kind in Sweden, was declared a historic building three years later in 2001. Two forts, Rödberget and Södra Åberget, are held in operation, and the former is used as a tourist attraction with guided tours, and there is also a possibility for companies to hold smaller conferences inside the fort. Over 10,000 visitors were expected to visit Rödberget Fort in 2002, averaging 300 a day during the summer. Boden Fortress is also <b>still</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the salute batteries of Sweden, which fire a 21-gun salute at special occasions such as the National holiday of Sweden and birthdays of some members of the Swedish Royal Family. The fortress was made a salute battery on 2 June 1931, but since the forts have been decommissioned, the salute is now fired with four cannon located at Kvarnängen in central Boden.|$|E
5|$|From 1971 onwards, Harvey was the {{chairman}} of selectors. It was a tumultuous period in Australian cricket, where captain Bill Lawry was acrimoniously sacked {{in the middle of the}} 1970–71 series against England after a dispute between players and Australian officials. Lawry was not informed of his fate and learned of his omission on the radio when he was <b>still</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> Australia's most productive batsmen. The dispute was the genesis of the pay dispute which, led to the formation of World Series Cricket in 1977 and generated a mass exodus of players. This resulted in the recall of Bob Simpson after ten years in retirement at the age of 41 to captain the Test team. Following the rapprochement between the establishment and the WSC players, Harvey left the selection panel. The WSC representatives felt that Harvey's anti-WSC comments made him prejudiced against the selection of former WSC players.|$|E

5|$|Puerto Rico's {{avifauna}} {{has diminished}} due to extinction and extirpation, either by natural forces or human intervention. For example, fossil evidence was discovered for {{a species of}} swift, Tachornis uranoceles, dated to the late Pleistocene (between 17,000 and 21,000 years ago). The species {{is believed to have}} become extinct as a result of habitat alteration after the Wisconsin glaciation. At least six endemic species have become extinct in the last millennia: Puerto Rican barn owl (Tyto cavatica), Puerto Rican caracara (Polyborus latebrosus), Puerto Rican conure (Aratinga chloroptera maugei), Puerto Rican woodcock (Scolopax anthonyi), Puerto Rican quail-dove (Geotrygon larva), and the Antillean cave rail (Nesotrochis debooyi). With a population of 13 individuals in 1975, the Puerto Rican parrot almost became the seventh, but conservation efforts helped save the species from extinction. However, it is <b>still</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the ten most critically endangered birds in the world. Four Puerto Rican birds, the Hispaniolan parakeet, the white-necked crow, the Cuban crow, and the limpkin, became extirpated after Puerto Rico's population expansion {{in the latter half of}} the nineteenth century and three more species, the black-bellied whistling duck, the black rail, and the American flamingo, no longer breed in the archipelago.|$|E
5|$|The game {{features}} {{characters from}} Nintendo video game franchises such as Mario, The Legend of Zelda, Star Fox, and Pokémon. Melee includes all playable characters {{from the first}} game in the series on the Nintendo 64 and also adds new characters from franchises such as Fire Emblem, of which no games had been released outside Japan at the time. The stages and gameplay modes make references to, or take their designs from, popular games released by Nintendo. Melees gameplay system offers an unorthodox approach to the fighting game genre with a counter that measures damage with increasing percentages, rather than a depleting health bar seen in most fighting games. It builds on the first game by adding new gameplay features and playable characters. Following the popularity of its multiplayer gameplay, Melee has been featured in many competitive gaming tournaments, and is <b>still</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the most popular fighting games for competitive play.|$|E
