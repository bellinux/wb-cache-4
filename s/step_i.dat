25|$|I admire {{a lot of}} what's {{going on}} out there, but the {{oversize}} kind of cartoon action movies is not something I'm terribly comfortable with. I think what I do is much more in the tradition that the bullets are real and they'll knock you down. I used to really get criticized for my lack of realism, but now I think my films {{are perceived to be}} vastly more realistic than most of the action movies that are happening out there... I {{think one of the things}} about being a director is, you should always try to re-create within yourself the kind of emotions you had watching film when you were very young. The kind of action movies that I always liked, the kind of comic books I always liked, were the serious ones. The characters were very realistic within the framework of the drama, and that kind of action movie interests me a lot more than the super-heroes. And so in that sense, maybe I'm slightly out of <b>step,</b> <b>I</b> suppose, but so be it.|$|E

"The general discontent I {{felt with}} woman's portion as wife, housekeeper, physician, and spiritual guide, the chaotic {{conditions}} into which everything fell without her constant supervision, and the wearied, anxious {{look of the}} majority of women, impressed me with a strong feeling that some active measures should be taken to remedy the wrongs of society in general, and of women in particular. My experience at the World Anti-slavery Convention, all I had read of the legal status of women, and the oppression I saw everywhere, together swept across my soul, intensified now by many personal experiences.

500|$|In October 1868 Cosima {{asked her}} husband for a divorce, to which he would not {{initially}} agree. To sceptical enquirers he explained her absence from the von Bülow family home by a supposed visit to her half-sister in Versailles. In June 1869, immediately {{after the birth of}} her and Wagner's third and final child, Siegfried, Cosima wrote to von Bülow in what she called a [...] "final attempt at an understanding". His reply was conciliatory; he wrote: [...] "You have preferred to consecrate the treasures of your heart and mind to a higher being: far from censuring you for this <b>step,</b> <b>I</b> approve of it". Legal processes extended the marriage until 18 July 1870, when the divorce was finally sanctioned by a Berlin court. After the divorce von Bülow distanced himself from both Wagner and Cosima; he never again spoke to Wagner, and 11 years passed before his next meeting with Cosima.|$|E
500|$|Oxford {{had left}} a small reserve of pike-equipped men with Henry. They slowed the pace of Richard's mounted charge and bought Tudor some {{critical}} time. The remainder of Henry's bodyguards surrounded their master and succeeded in keeping {{him away from the}} Yorkist king. On seeing Richard embroiled with Henry's men and separated from his main force, William Stanley made his move. He led his men into the fight at Henry's side. Outnumbered, Richard's group was surrounded and gradually pressed back. Richard's force was driven several hundred yards away from Tudor, near {{to the edge of a}} marsh. The king's horse lost its footing and toppled into it. Richard gathered himself and rallied his dwindling followers, supposedly refusing to retreat: [...] "God forbid that I retreat one <b>step.</b> <b>I</b> will either win the battle as a king, or die as one." [...] In the fighting Richard's banner man—Sir Percival Thirlwall—lost his legs but held the Yorkist banner aloft until he was killed. It is likely that James Harrington also died in the charge. The king's trusted advisor Richard Ratcliffe was also slain.|$|E

500|$|Epstein had {{no prior}} {{experience}} of artist management, {{yet he had}} a strong influence on the band's early dress code and stage demeanor. They had previously worn blue jeans and leather jackets, and they would stop and start songs when they felt like it or when an audience member requested a certain song. David Pomerran Szatmary states that when Epstein first saw them at The Cavern Club, he thought, [...] "They were a scruffy crowd in leather, {{and they were not}} very tidy and not very clean. They smoked as they played and they ate and talked and pretended to hit each other." [...] Epstein encouraged them to wear suits and ties, insisted that they stop swearing, smoking, drinking, or eating on stage, and also suggested the famous synchronised bow {{at the end of their}} performances. McCartney was the first to agree with Epstein's suggestions, believing that they reflected Epstein's RADA training. Epstein explained that the process from leather jackets and jeans to suits took some time: [...] "I encouraged them, at first, to get out of the leather jackets and jeans, and I wouldn't allow them to appear in jeans after a short time, and then, after that <b>step,</b> <b>I</b> got them to wear sweaters on stage, and then, very reluctantly, eventually, suits." [...] Epstein took the group to Wirral to see his friend, master tailor Beno Dorn, who made them their first suits based on a design they had previously seen, but which Epstein approved of: [...] "I thought it was an excellent design at the time." ...|$|E
500|$|In May, Benfica were chasing second place; {{they met}} Naval on 5 May. As with Marítimo, Miccoli was vital in {{securing}} the win, helping Petit score {{the first and}} then scoring the winner with two minutes to spare. Santos was satisfied, but said Benfica needed to do better, complaining of excessive individualism from his players. On 13 May, Benfica visited Estádio do Bonfim to play Vitória de Setúbal. They struggled to beat Setúbal goalkeeper Nikola Milojević until Miccoli broke the deadlock in the 79th minute. Santos commented on Benfica's chances in winning the Primeira Liga, saying, [...] "While [...] is mathematically possible, I will believe in it." [...] Miccoli, who scored his fifth goal in four matches, told the media he about his future, [...] "I would like to stay. Love the club, love the team and the fans. Benfica is everything to me." [...] A week later, {{on the final day}} of the league, Benfica received and beat Académica 2–0, with goals from Derlei and Mantorras. Because both rivals had won, Benfica finished in third place with 67 points, two behind winners Porto and one behind Sporting, missing out on direct entry to the 2007–08 UEFA Champions League. Despite the trophy-less season, Santos refused to label the season negative, saying, [...] "Not winning titles is never good, but calling this season negative is a <b>step</b> <b>I</b> will not take." [...] Benfica ended the season with tour of North America, playing Toronto FC and AEK Athens. During the tour, Santos predicted he would win the title in the next season, while Benfica President Luís Filipe Vieira said Benfica would invest heavily to make the team more competitive.|$|E
