500|$|Every year {{we change}} fewer wheels, because the {{wheels and tyres}} are getting better and better. We changed about 20 wheels today. Five years ago, it was much worse— we'd be {{choosing}} about a hundred. Tyres are becoming much better than before. <b>So,</b> <b>yes,</b> our job is easier— except that the race generally goes faster now, so we're under a bit more pressure. Every year, there's new types of gears, new aluminium frames, new titanium frames, so it's getting more complex for us to offer neutral service. We have a list in the car of who is riding Mavic or Shimano or Campagnolo; the moment someone gets a flat tyre {{we need to think}} of a lot of things at once. Is it a titanium frame or a carbon frame or a steel frame? ...|$|E
500|$|I {{was running}} back and forth, literally, from the editing room with [...] Jonas Akerlund to working with Stuart, who was also mixing the music in the film. We were together, non-stop, all of us. Cutting 350 hours of film down to two hours. There {{are a lot of}} serious aspects to the movie. I needed a release. When I would go to Stuart's, and we'd go up to his loft, it was like, 'Honey, I want to dance.' I wanted to be happy, silly and buoyant. I wanted to lift myself and others up with this record. <b>So,</b> <b>yes,</b> the new album was a {{reaction}} to all the other stuff I was doing, which was very serious in nature. I hope that doesn't imply that I wanted to make a superficial record, because it's not. I want people to smile when they hear this record. I wanted it to put a smile on my face, too.|$|E
500|$|Casting {{announcements}} {{began in}} March 2011, with Connie Britton {{first to be}} cast, portraying female lead Vivien Harmon. Britton stated that she took a risk in taking the role of Vivien. When Murphy presented the role to her, he said, [...] "This is something we've never seen you do before. It will be turning what you've just been doing on its ear." [...] She was intrigued by what he had presented her and ultimately {{decided to take the}} part. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, series co-creator Ryan Murphy stated that he had told Connie Britton, early on, that her character Vivien would die in the first season. [...] "We've really had the whole season mapped out from the beginning," [...] he said. [...] "In the meetings with the core actors, the three leads being Connie, Dylan [...] and Jessica , as we tried to snare them we were able to say this is where you start, this is the middle, and this is where you end up. <b>So,</b> <b>yes,</b> I was able to tell Connie really the whole run of the series." ...|$|E

500|$|In September 2011, Tripathi {{confirmed}} {{that from the}} next month he would start penning the third installment of the trilogy, The Oath of the Vayuputras. In January 2013, {{it was revealed that}} The Oath of the Vayuputras would be released on 27 February of the same year, by Westland Publishing. Tripathi explained that {{the final version of the}} book was longer than he had expected it to be, and consisted of 53chapters, making it twice as long as the other books. During an interview with The Times of India, the author discussed some of the important scenarios being presented in the book. He explained that since Shiva is a mortal in his series, he would have a fitting epilogue in the book, with many of the loose ends of the plot finally being deciphered. Shiva would meet the chief of the Vasudevas and the Vayuputras in the hidden cities of Ujjain and Pariha. [...] "Some loose ends will be left deliberately open for the readers to interpret. As for losing someone we love? The Shiva trilogy chronicles a battle against evil. And evil does not go quietly into the night; instead, it puts up a strong fight against Good. <b>So</b> <b>yes,</b> people will die in Vayuputras," [...] he concluded.|$|E
2500|$|On September 24 at the United Nations General Assembly, President Obama {{described}} the racial tensions at Ferguson {{as a failure}} {{to live up to}} America's ideals, and said that, [...] "n a summer marked by instability in the Middle East and Eastern Europe, I know the world also took notice of the small American city of Ferguson, Missouri – where a young man was killed, and a community was divided. <b>So</b> <b>yes,</b> we have our own racial and ethnic tensions." ...|$|E
2500|$|Yes, they're a {{military}} threat," [...] Cain {{said on the}} PBS NewsHour, {{in response to a}} question from Judy Woodruff. [...] "They've indicated that they're trying to develop nuclear capability and they want to develop more aircraft carriers like we have. <b>So</b> <b>yes,</b> we have to consider them {{a military}} threat." [...] "We already have superiority in terms of our military capability, and I plan to get away from making cutting our defense a priority and make investing in our military capability a priority," [...] he said.|$|E

2500|$|Everest {{led to a}} {{delay in}} the film Mohenjo Daro, another of Gowariker's projects. Gowariker {{came up with the}} {{concepts}} at the same time, but because he was more excited about starting Everest he postponed Mohenjo Daro. Gowariker later clarified this, saying: [...] "What is most important for me is the planning stage. Once that is in place, implementing the ideas becomes easier. The research (for Everest) took longer than usual. <b>So</b> <b>yes,</b> I did have to push the movie a little bit because Everest took up a lot of my time. It is my dream project and needed more attention." ...|$|E
2500|$|In May 2016, it was {{reported}} that the outgoing executive producer of EastEnders, Dominic Treadwell-Collins, had tried to get Tully to return to the show, saying [...] " [...] emailed back and forth, but she's a director now. I briefly considered a recast, but it just didn't sit right. And you never know, maybe someone else can woo Sue Tully to come back." [...] He added, [...] "Michelle carries the one unexploded secret—the child. But there are ways around that! <b>So,</b> <b>yes,</b> it was one of my original ideas—bringing Michelle in and the secrets she brings. I love secrets." [...] Instead, Treadwell-Collins introduced Michelle's son with Grant, Mark Fowler, played by Ned Porteous.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Noisey in March 2013, Jourgensen announced that Ministry would break up again, explaining {{that he did not}} want to carry on without Scaccia. He explained, [...] "Mikey was my best friend in the world and there's no Ministry without him. But I know the music we recorded together during the last weeks of his life had to be released to honor him. So after his funeral, I locked myself in my studio and turned the songs we had recorded into the best and last Ministry record anyone will ever hear. I can't do it without Mikey and I don't want to. <b>So</b> <b>yes,</b> this will be Ministry's last album." [...] The album, titled From Beer to Eternity, was released on September 6, 2013. Jourgensen stated that Ministry would tour in support of From Beer to Eternity, but would not record any more albums. In an April 2016 interview with Loudwire, however, Jourgensen mentioned the possibility of making another Ministry album [...] "if the circumstances are right." ...|$|E

2500|$|Blink-182 reunited in February 2009 and Hoppus {{confirmed}} {{in an interview}} with Alternative Press that +44 was on hiatus: [...] "I don't consider it done. We'll never say never with anything," [...] he remarked. [...] "As soon as you say, 'I'm not gonna do that anymore,' you find yourself in a situation where you wanna do that. Shane [...] and Craig [...] are awesome guitarists and great fun to play in a band with, so we definitely won't say that the band is done. But obviously, for the foreseeable future, all of our energy is going into Blink-182." [...] In an interview with Blunt Magazine in March 2009, Hoppus was asked if +44 will continue again, where he stated [...] "I think <b>so,</b> <b>yes.</b> I love Shane [...] and Craig [...] They are great guitarists and good friends and I'd love to do another record with them. I know that Tom DeLonge plans to continue doing Angels & Airwaves in some capacity but right now all of our efforts are on Blink." ...|$|E
2500|$|Paul proposes sharply {{reducing}} the government's regulation of medications and health supplements by {{reducing the}} role of, and ultimately eliminating, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In a 2011 interview, Paul said, [...] "Well, the FDA just serves the drug companies... they also prevent drugs from coming on the market [...] 10, 15 years later than other countries have it. <b>So,</b> <b>yes,</b> government just {{gets in the way}} on so many of those things." [...] He favors allowing FDA-approved prescription drugs to be imported from foreign countries and sold at a lower cost than the same drugs otherwise sell for in the US – thereby allowing international markets to set drug prices in the US market – a practice that has been prohibited by the FDA. In the interest, as he sees it, of fighting for greater freedom of choice for consumers, he has also introduced bills that would significantly reduce the government's ability to prevent manufacturers or sellers of dietary supplements and certain other health products from making what government regulators believe to be false or misleading claims about the health effects of the products. He essentially feels that consumers should be able to buy whatever health aids they want from whomever they want, without the need for guidance by the government.|$|E
2500|$|Rothenberg {{said he and}} {{his crew}} do some {{research}} with regard to depicting societies, such as the Grounders, within the series, but most of what is shown is based on his personal tastes. He enjoys the world-building aspect the most. [...] "Getting to create this universe from the language to the wardrobe to the tattoos ... we obviously get pretty deep into what the grounder spirituality is and means," [...] he stated. [...] "All of that is pretty awesome. <b>So</b> <b>yes,</b> we do some research as to how societies have evolved in the past {{but for the most part}} it's fiction." [...] Rothenberg said there are more than just men writing the show; there are several women [...] "writing hardcore sci-fi." [...] In 2015, two commander jackets were described as being [...] "made out of leather, metal, and fur". Debnam-Carey felt that the Grounder culture—the language, wardrobe, makeup and [...] "all the symbolic meaning behind that"—was [...] "one of the highlights" [...] for her. [...] "We explored it as much as we could as actors to break down its meaning, but the best thing about this was finally finding out all this backstory and fully creating this world," [...] she stated, adding they [...] "had three sets built just for the Grounders".|$|E
