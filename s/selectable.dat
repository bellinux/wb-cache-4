5|$|Available options include; 17-inch 5-spoke forged polished-aluminum wheels; {{rearview}} camera system, parking assist package; leather-wrapped steering wheel; {{and heated}} leather front seats with <b>selectable</b> automatic activation.|$|E
5|$|Archaea host a {{new class}} of {{potentially}} useful antibiotics. A few of these archaeocins have been characterized, but hundreds more are believed to exist, especially within Haloarchaea and Sulfolobus. These compounds differ in structure from bacterial antibiotics, so they may have novel modes of action. In addition, they may allow the creation of new <b>selectable</b> markers for use in archaeal molecular biology.|$|E
5|$|The {{first model}} to be commercially {{manufactured}} was the Mk I in 1963. An updated version, the Mk II, was released {{the following year}} which featured the full set of sounds <b>selectable</b> by banks and stations. The instrument was expensive, costing £1,000, {{at a time when}} a typical house cost £2,000–£3,000.|$|E
5|$|The {{mobile phone}} {{version of the}} game is {{primarily}} a beat 'em up with role-playing elements. Unlike the console versions the game plays as a side-scroller in the same vein as the 1992 X-Men arcade game. There are five <b>selectable</b> characters, and players upgrade each through experience points earned. Players control one character at a time, and can switch to another at the press of a button.|$|E
5|$|Using {{synchrotron}} radiation frequently has specific requirements for X-ray crystallography. The intense ionizing radiation can cause radiation damage to samples, particularly macromolecular crystals. Cryo crystallography protects the sample from radiation damage, by freezing the crystal at liquid nitrogen temperatures (~100 K). However, {{synchrotron radiation}} frequently {{has the advantage}} of user <b>selectable</b> wavelengths, allowing for anomalous scattering experiments which maximizes anomalous signal. This is critical in experiments such as SAD and MAD.|$|E
5|$|A feature {{coming into}} wide use in modern shortwave {{receivers}} is DSP technology, short for digital signal processing. DSP {{is the use}} of digital means to process signals, and a primary benefit in shortwave receivers is the ability to tailor the bandwidth of the receiver to current reception conditions and to the type of signal being listened to. A typical analog-only receiver may have a limited number of fixed bandwidths, or only one, but a DSP receiver may have 40 or more individually <b>selectable</b> filters.|$|E
5|$|Artificial {{selection}} is the intentional selection of traits {{in a population}} of organisms. This {{has been used for}} thousands of years in the domestication of plants and animals. More recently, such selection has become a vital part of genetic engineering, with <b>selectable</b> markers such as antibiotic resistance genes being used to manipulate DNA. Proteins with valuable properties have evolved by repeated rounds of mutation and selection (for example modified enzymes and new antibodies) in a process called directed evolution.|$|E
5|$|Many reticle {{illumination}} {{and pattern}} options are available. Common light sources used in firearm reflector sights include battery powered lights, fiber optic light collectors, and even tritium capsules. Some sights {{are specifically designed}} to be visible when viewed through night vision devices. The color of a sight reticle is often red or amber for visibility against most backgrounds. Some sights use a chevron or triangular pattern instead, to aid precision aiming and range estimation, and still others provide <b>selectable</b> patterns.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the game, the player is {{presented}} with a range of options that determine the experience. The game offers nine <b>selectable</b> levels of difficulty, including a tutorial difficulty in which the enemy forces do not fire back. Among the options, the player can choose to play either in summer or winter time and either daytime or nighttime, altering the scenery. The player must choose from the range of weapons that will be mounted on their AWAT plane. These include air-to-air, air-to-ground, air-to-sea and multipurpose missiles, depending on what enemies the player chooses to engage. In addition, the plane is equipped with a machine gun and decoy flares against hostile missiles.|$|E
5|$|Like {{the first}} Ridge Racer, the player {{normally}} starts with four cars. The remaining eight are <b>selectable</b> on winning the mini game before the title screen (the mini game is Galaga '88 {{instead of the}} original game's Galaxian). They are mostly unchanged; their names (certain cars are named after other Namco titles) and specifications {{are similar to the}} first game. After the player wins the first three circuits, reversed versions are unlocked, and Time Trial features an additional opponent driving a secret car. There are three secret cars; the '13th Racing' (from the first Ridge Racer) of the Novice course, and the new '13th Racing Kid' (of the Intermediate course) and 'White Angel' (of the Expert course). These cars are unlocked upon winning the respective course's Time Trial race.|$|E
5|$|Numerous easter {{eggs and}} secrets {{were added to}} the game to fuel the {{exploration}} efforts and wild speculation of many gamers. One of the most notable features is the pieces of cheese hidden on every level. These were deliberately placed by one of the game's artists as a graphical oddity for the player's confusion. The face of actor Robin Williams was used for Daniel Carrington, while the face of Shigeru Miyamoto along with faces of other Nintendo executives and game journalists can be seen on enemy guards and as <b>selectable</b> avatars in the multiplayer mode. The ranking system of the Combat Simulator awards a special username and password to skilled players. Rare had originally intended these details to allow access to password-protected parts of the official Perfect Dark website, but these sections were never implemented.|$|E
5|$|Apple {{began taking}} pre-orders for the first-generation iPad on March 12, 2010. The only major {{change to the}} device between its {{announcement}} and being available to pre-order was the change {{of the behavior of}} the side switch to perform either sound muting or screen rotation locking (user <b>selectable).</b> The Wi-Fi version of the iPad went on sale in the United States on April 3, 2010. The Wi-Fi+3G version was released on April 30. 3G service in the United States is provided by AT and was initially sold with two prepaid contract-free data plan options: one for unlimited data and the other for 250MB per month at half the price. On June 2, 2010, AT announced that effective June 7 the unlimited plan would be replaced for new customers with a 2GB plan at slightly lower cost; existing customers would have the option to keep the unlimited plan. The plans are activated on the iPad itself and can be cancelled at any time.|$|E
5|$|Rachel is {{the leading}} female character, and tragic heroine of the game. She and her twin sister, Alma, are afflicted with a blood curse that turns humans into fiends. Believing {{that there is no}} cure for their condition, Rachel seeks to kill Alma to redeem her sister's soul. The {{relationship}} between the sisters and the Greater Fiend Doku, who cursed them, serves as a plot device to drive the game forward, with Rachel occasionally needing to be rescued by Ryu. Although not a player-controlled character in Ninja Gaiden, in a few sections of the Ninja Gaiden Sigma remake she is controllable. Two other characters assist the player in the game. Ayane, a young female ninja and one of the DOA regular cast members, acts as a guide throughout Ninja Gaiden by supplying advice and objectives to the player. Muramasa, a bladesmith, has shops scattered throughout the game world where players can purchase useful items and upgrades for Ryu's weapons. Muramasa also gives quests and relates back-stories and other crucial information; for example, he tells Ryu how he can obtain the item required to upgrade his Dragon Sword to its full potential. Players have the option to customize the appearance of player characters, with <b>selectable</b> costumes for Ryu and hairstyles for Rachel.|$|E
5|$|Random dungeons {{were created}} for each {{floor of the}} dungeon by {{selecting}} ten to twenty rooms from a pre-built library of 200 layouts, adding in the monsters, items, and other features, and then including fixed rooms that would be found on each floor, such as a boss room and treasure room. In expanding the gameplay, McMillen used the structure of Zeldas dungeons to design how the player would progress through the game. In a typical Zelda dungeon, according to McMillen, the player acquires a new item that helps them to progress farther in the game; he took the same inspiration to assure that each level in Isaac included at least one item and one bonus item on defeating the boss that would boost the character's attributes. McMillen also wanted to encourage players to experiment to learn how things work within Isaac, mirroring how Miyamoto had done with the original Zelda game. He designed the level progression to become more difficult with the player's progression in the game, as well as additional content that became available after beating the game as to make it feel like the game was long. McMillen designed four of the <b>selectable</b> characters based on the main classes of Dungeons & Dragons—fighter, thief, cleric and wizard.|$|E
5|$|The Nintendo DSi {{connects to}} the Internet via either its {{built-in}} 802.11b/g Wi-Fi or a Nintendo Wi-Fi USB Connector; both methods grant access to the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection service. The DSi supports WEP, WPA (AES/TKIP), and WPA2 (AES/TKIP) wireless encryption; only software with built-in support can use the latter two encryption types, as they were {{not supported by the}} DS and DS Lite. Up to six wireless Internet connection profiles can be saved; using the traditional setup method, the first three profiles support WEP encryption, while the remaining three are <b>selectable</b> under a more advanced option, which supports WPA encryption. Under this advanced option, users may access the Wi-Fi Protected Setup method and configure proxy settings. The DSi can automatically detect Nintendo Zone service areas thus preventing the need to manually setup Wi-Fi connections. The service offers demos of upcoming and currently available games, access to the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection and DSi Shop, and may have location-specific content.|$|E
5|$|The PlayStation 3 {{version of}} Flow {{features}} enhanced visuals and three additional playable organisms: {{one that can}} move with a short burst of speed, one that can paralyze other creatures, and one that lunges toward its prey's weak point. The worm creature from the original game was given {{the ability to move}} faster, while the jellyfish may now create a vortex to attract small creatures. These special moves are activated by hitting any button on the controller. When the player reaches the bottom plane with each creature, the next creature type is unlocked and becomes <b>selectable</b> {{at the beginning of the}} game. The PlayStation 3 version features a multiplayer mode for up to four players; a game in progress can be joined at any time, players may play different creatures if they desire so. The PlayStation Portable version contains all of the features introduced by PlayStation 3 version, but reduces the size of each plane. On November 20, 2007, the PlayStation 3 version received an add-on pack that allows players joining a multiplayer game to select their creatures. The pack also includes new enemies, food types, and a playable creature with a shield ability.|$|E
5|$|The XrossMediaBar, {{originally}} {{used on the}} PSX, is a graphical {{user interface}} currently used for the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable, {{as well as a}} variety of other Sony devices. The interface features icons that are spread horizontally across the screen. Navigation moves the icons instead of a cursor. These icons are used as categories to organize the options available to the user. When an icon is selected on the horizontal bar, several more appear vertically, above and below it (<b>selectable</b> by the up and down directions on a directional pad). The XMB can also be accessed in-game albeit with restrictions, it allows players to access certain areas of the XMB menu from within the game and is only available for the PlayStation 3. Although the capacity to play users' own music in-game was added with this update, the feature is dependent on game developers who must either enable the feature in their games or update existing games.|$|E
5|$|The second {{generation}} Mac Pro has a redesigned configuration of ports. It has a HDMI 1.4 port, dual Gigabit Ethernet ports, six Thunderbolt 2 ports, four USB 3 ports, and combined digital Mini-TOSlink optical / analog 3.5mm stereo mini jack for audio output. It {{also has a}} headphones mini jack (the two are distinctly <b>selectable</b> within the Sound System Preference panel, Output tab). There is no dedicated port for inputting audio. The system has a low-fidelity internal mono speaker. The Thunderbolt 2 ports support up to thirty-six Thunderbolt devices (six per port) and can concurrently support up to three 4K displays. This design requires two GPUs to support the seven display outputs (HDMI and six Thunderbolt). The I/O panel illuminates itself when the unit senses it has been moved {{to make it easier}} for the user to see the ports. Unlike the previous model, it has no FireWire 800 ports, dedicated digital audio in/out ports, a SuperDrive, DVI port, 3.5-inch drive bays for replaceable storage drives, or changeable internal PCIe slots. Instead, there are six Thunderbolt 2 ports to connect high-speed external peripherals, including enclosures for internal PCIe cards.|$|E
5|$|There is a Practice mode {{which allows}} the player to {{practice}} any track with opponents. Time Attack lets the player choose a track and complete a 3-lap race in the shortest time possible. Transparent re-enactments of Time Attack performances, or ghost data, from the player or game developer can be raced against. Up to 3 player-contributed ghosts can be raced against simultaneously, but only one can be saved per track. Death Race has the player annihilating the 29 other racers as speedily as possible on a specialized course. There is no <b>selectable</b> difficulty level, or set amount of laps, but the boost is immediately available. Vs. Battle is the multiplayer mode where 2 to 4 players compete in a 3-lap race, and slots not in use by players can be operated by the artificial intelligence. A slot machine for those {{out of the race}} early will appear if the option is enabled. Players can adversely affect the energy levels of those still competing by matching symbols.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{previous}} {{games in}} the Mana series, Dawn of Mana {{takes place in a}} full three-dimensional world, in which the player characters navigate the terrain and fight off hostile creatures. The player controls the main character, Keldric, and is followed for almost all of the game by a fairy spirit, Faye. Unlike previous {{games in the}} series, Dawn is an action-adventure game, rather than an action role-playing game; as such, gameplay is focused on movement and attacking enemies, rather than leveling-up character statistics. Keldric is able to run, roll, and jump through the game world. Keldric has access to a vine-like plant attached to his arm, which can be used at any time as either a sword, a whip, or a slingshot. The sword can be used to hit enemies and objects, the whip can grab and throw enemies and objects, and the slingshot can throw collectible pebbles as projectiles. Faye can cast magic spells, <b>selectable</b> by the player.|$|E
5|$|With no keyboard, the Famicom version {{replaces the}} verb-noun parser with a menu list of {{fourteen}} set commands <b>selectable</b> with the gamepad. This {{is similar to}} the command selection menu system introduced in Yuji Horii's murder mystery adventure game , which was released in 1984, in between the PC and Famicom releases of Portopia. One of the commands on the menu allowed the player to use a point-and-click interface, using the D-pad to move a cursor on the screen in order to look for clues and hotspots. The Famicom version of Portopia also features branching menu selections, which includes using the pointer as a magnifying glass to investigate objects, which is needed to find hidden clues, and as a fist or hammer to hit anything or anyone, which could be used to carry out beatings during suspect interrogations. Additional sequences were also added, notably an underground dungeon maze, with a style similar to role-playing video games.|$|E
5|$|His first {{appearance}} outside Final Fantasy VII {{was as a}} <b>selectable</b> character in the fighting game Ehrgeiz. A redesigned Sephiroth also appears in the North American and European versions of Kingdom Hearts as an optional boss character in Olympus Coliseum. Lance Bass voiced Sephiroth in this game, while in subsequent titles he was replaced by George Newbern. In the Japanese re-release of the game, Final Mix, an additional scene was added in which Sephiroth fights Cloud, although {{the result of the}} fight is not revealed. Sephiroth {{was not included in the}} sequel , as director Tetsuya Nomura could not give him a storyline related to Cloud, and he feared negative fan response if Sephiroth did not have a notable role in the story. His third appearance outside Final Fantasy VII is as another optional boss in Kingdom Hearts II, where he is first encountered by the series' protagonist, Sora, and then Cloud, who is pursuing him. When Sephiroth battles Cloud, both of them disappear, with Sora believing that they went somewhere else to continue their fight. Nomura said that in this game, Sephiroth represents Cloud's dark side, in contrast to Tifa Lockhart, who represents his light side. Although Sephiroth does not appear in the prequel Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep, he is mentioned as a hero that Zack Fair aspires to be. The staff, however, did not know if they would portray him as a being of darkness as shown in other titles. Sephiroth's fourth outside appearance is in the Itadaki Street games Special and Portable, where he appears as an unlockable playable character. Due to Sephiroth's many appearances as a boss in the Kingdom Hearts series, Square Enix is not sure whether he will return in Kingdom Hearts III as it would be redundant.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} {{system remains}} unchanged from Ridge Racer, the checkpoint and time limit system remain the same; {{running out of}} time ends the race and passing through checkpoints grants additional time, although the car drifting is more like Ridge Racer 2. The player drives using automatic transmission or manual transmission. Ridge Racer Revolution supports Namco's NeGcon controller, and adds a rear-view mirror when using the in-car view. The game consists of three courses: 'Novice', 'Intermediate' (also called 'Advanced'), and 'Expert', each having different sections opened, and incorporates modes from the original game; Race, against eleven opponents, and Time Trial, against one. Ridge Racer Revolution adds a mode: Free Run, in which there are no other cars and the player practises driving. There is no lap limit. How fast the cars run depends on which speed grade is used, <b>selectable</b> in Free Run, and can be unlocked for Race. It is not available in Time Trial. A new feature is the option to select the time of day in which the race takes place, although this is not available {{at the start of the}} game. Ridge Racer Revolution features a two-player link-up mode which allows the players access to the original Ridge Racers courses known as 'Special 1' and 'Special 2'. There are two modes in two-player link-up: Race, identical to its single-player counterpart, and Versus, where only the players race against each other. Versus features a handicap option, increasing the speed of the trailing car.|$|E
25|$|A nearly unique {{feature of}} the newer iriver players is the direct MP3-recording {{capability}} with <b>selectable</b> bitrate of internal (FM, microphone) and external (line) sources.|$|E
25|$|Lada Niva (VAZ-2121) - {{full-time}} 4WD using {{open center}} differential. Transfer case with high/low range and manual central diff lock. Low range <b>selectable</b> in locked or unlocked mode, allowing use on pavement.|$|E
25|$|The A-10 {{was one of}} the <b>selectable</b> {{aircraft}} in the Nintendo 64 game Aerofighters Assault, piloted by the female pilot Glenda. It was unique as in being the only {{aircraft in}} campaign mode with no homing weapons.|$|E
25|$|The Mirage 2000 is {{equipped}} with built-in twin DEFA 554 autocannon (now GIAT 30–550 F4) 30mm revolver-type cannons with 125 rounds each. The cannons have <b>selectable</b> fire rates of 1,200 or 1,800 rounds per minute.|$|E
25|$|The Redskins' policy since Baugh's {{retirement}} {{has been}} to not retire numbers. However, some numbers are unofficially retired and are usually withheld from being <b>selectable</b> by new players. The following numbers of past Redskins greats fall into that category.|$|E
25|$|Triclosan {{has been}} {{employed}} as a selective agent in molecular cloning. A bacterial host transformed by a plasmid harboring a triclosan-resistant mutant FabI gene (mFabI) as a <b>selectable</b> marker can grow in presence of high dose of triclosan in growth media.|$|E
25|$|After Generation 9, similar dungeons called Shadow Missions and Theatre Missions were implemented. They {{feature the}} same basic mechanics, but are <b>selectable</b> by the player and usually take place on a large, isolated, fixed map or area instead of using a {{generated}} map.|$|E
25|$|The reactor is {{tripped in}} cases of high or low water level in the steam {{separators}} (with two <b>selectable</b> low-level thresholds); high steam pressure; low feedwater flow; loss of two main coolant pumps on either side. These trips can be manually disabled.|$|E
25|$|Also {{common is}} the use of Flash-based {{solutions}} such as sIFR. This is similar to image replacement techniques, though the text is <b>selectable</b> and rendered as a vector. However, this method requires the presence of a proprietary plugin on a client's system.|$|E
25|$|The first version, known {{simply as}} the Model 52, {{retained}} the basic trigger mechanism of the Model 39, with the Double-Action function <b>selectable</b> via a simple frame-mounted setscrew, allowing the pistol to be fired in either single-action or double-action mode depending on the setscrew's adjustment.|$|E
25|$|Series models feature leaf-sprung {{suspension}} with <b>selectable</b> two or {{four-wheel drive}} (4WD); though the Stage 1 V8 {{version of the}} Series III featured permanent 4WD. All three models could be started with a front hand crank and {{had the option of}} a rear power takeoff for accessories.|$|E
25|$|In a Drupal website's default configuration, authors can {{contribute}} content as either registered or anonymous users (at {{the discretion of}} the administrator). This content is accessible to web visitors through a variety of <b>selectable</b> criteria. As of Drupal 8, Drupal has adopted some Symfony libraries into Drupal core.|$|E
25|$|By convention, {{the term}} {{oscillators}} usually denotes integrated circuits (ICs) that supply single output frequencies. MEMS oscillators include MEMS resonators, sustaining amps, and additional electronics to set or adjust their output frequencies. These circuits often include phase locked loops (PLLs) that produce <b>selectable</b> or programmable output frequencies from the upstream MEMS reference frequencies.|$|E
