The measured tensile strengths of the GFRP <b>square</b> <b>bars</b> before and after exposure were considered as a measure of the durability performance of the specimens and were used for long-term properties prediction based on the Arrhenius theory. The test results showed the very high long-term durability of <b>square</b> GFRP <b>bars</b> exposed to alkaline solutions. According to the predictions, even after a service life of 100 years at 32 oC, the tensile-strength retention of the tested GFRP bars would still be over 95 % for GFRP <b>square</b> <b>bars...</b>|$|R

40|$|Eighteen splice {{specimens}} {{were tested}} under four-point loading {{as part of}} a larger experimental investigation to study the behaviour of lap spliced plain steel bars in reinforced concrete specimens. Three of the specimens were instrumented with strain gauges adhered to the reinforcement and the concrete side face. Three lap splice lengths, two <b>bar</b> sizes for <b>square</b> <b>bars,</b> and one bar size for round bars were investigated. The principal reinforcement was either cast in the bottom or top position. The results of maximum loads, crack patterns, load versus deflection behaviour, and deflected profiles are presented for all specimens. The analysis of specimens with strain gauge instrumentation is also presented, and includes results of strain compatibility, bond stress distribution, and flexural section analysis. All specimens failed by bond, caused by a sudden pullout of the reinforcement within the splice region. An equivalent round diameter based upon the cross-section area of the <b>square</b> <b>bars</b> allowed for a single predictive equation between the maximum normalized load as a function of splice length, casting position and bar size. A top cast factor of 0. 4 and 0. 6 captures the reduction in the maximum normalized load for specimens cast with round and <b>square</b> <b>bars,</b> respectively, in the top position. The CEB-FIP Model Code (1993) predictive equations are reasonably conservative in capturing the behaviour of specimens reinforced with round bars cast in the bottom position, and <b>square</b> <b>bars</b> with side dimension of 25 mm cast in the bottom position. However, the CEB-FIP Model Code (1993) predictive equation is unconservative when predicting the behaviour of specimens reinforced with either <b>square</b> or round <b>bars</b> cast in the top position. On the other hand, the draft CEB-FIP Model Code (2010) provisions showed an overly conservative prediction for all specimens reinforced with either round or <b>square</b> <b>bars</b> cast in the top or bottom position. Instrumented specimens showed that strain compatibility between the longitudinal reinforcement and the surrounding concrete did not exist for much of the loading range due to bond loss. The evaluation of the neutral axis location within the shear span showed that shear is first transferred by beam action, followed by arch action. The use of three strain gauges adhered to the concrete side face provided flexural moments similar to that predicted theoretically...|$|R

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation on}} deformation {{shape of a}} cylindrical shell with internal medium subjected to lateral contact explosion was carried out briefly. Deformation shapes at different covered width of lateral explosive were recovered experimentally. Based on the experimental results, a corresponding analytical approach has been undertaken with rigid plastic hinge theory. In the analytical model, the cylindrical shell is divided into end-to-end rigid <b>square</b> <b>bars.</b> Deformation process of the cylindrical shell is described by using the translations and rotations of all rigid <b>square</b> <b>bars.</b> Expressions of the spring force, buckling moment, and deflection angle between adjacent rigid <b>square</b> <b>bars</b> are conducted theoretically. Given the structure parameters of the cylinder {{and the type of}} the lateral explosive charge, deformation processes and shapes are reported and discussed using the analytical approach. A good agreement has been obtained between calculated and experimental results, and thus the analytical approach can be considered as a valuable tool in understanding the deformation mechanism and predicting the deformation shapes of the cylindrical shell with internal medium subjected to lateral contact explosion. Finally, parametric studies are carried out to analyze the effects of deformation shape, including the covered width of the lateral explosive, explosive charge material, and distribution of initial velocity...|$|R

40|$|Direct {{numerical}} simulations (DNS) {{are carried}} out to study the passive heat transport in a turbulent channel flow with either <b>square</b> <b>bars</b> or circular rods on one wall. Several values of the pitch (λ) to (κ) height ratio and two Reynolds numbers are considered. The roughness increases the heat transfer by inducing ejections {{at the leading edge}} of the roughness elements. The amounts of heat transfer and mixing depend on the separation between the roughness elements, an increase in heat transfer accompanying an increase in drag. The ratio of non-dimensional heat flux to the non-dimensional wall shear stress is higher for circular rods than <b>square</b> <b>bars</b> irrespectively of the pitch to height ratio. The turbulent heat flux varies within the cavities and is larger near the roughness elements. Both momentum and thermal eddy diffusivities increase relative to the smooth wall. For square cavities (λ/κ = 2) the turbulent Prandtl number is smaller than for a smooth channel near the wall. As λ/κ increases, the turbulent Prandtl number increases up to a maximum of 2. 5 at the crests plane of the <b>square</b> <b>bars</b> (λ/κ = 7. 5). With increasing distance from the wall, the differences with respect to the smooth wall vanish and at three roughness heights above the crests plane, the turbulent Prandtl number is essentially the same for smooth and rough walls...|$|R
