40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Intellectual property [...] which includes federally granted patents, trademarks, and copyrights [...] is often owned or used by state governmental entities, such as public institutions of higher education. Until recently, state entities that made unauthorized use of, or "infringed," the intellectual property of others were subject to lawsuits in federal court. In 1999, however, the U. S. Supreme Court held that states were not subject to such suits, striking down a federal law that would have taken away a state's right to claim immunity under the Eleventh Amendment of the U. S. Constitution when sued in federal court for patent infringement. Some intellectual property owners are concerned {{that they no longer}} have adequate remedies if a <b>state</b> commits <b>infringement.</b> Although the precise number is difficult to determine, few accusations of intellectual property infringement appear to have been made against the states through either lawsuits or matters handled out of court. GAO identified 58 lawsuits that had been active since January 1985 in either a state or federal court in which a state was a defendant in an action involving the unauthorized use of intellectual property. Intellectual property owners appear to have few proven alternatives or remedies against <b>state</b> <b>infringement</b> available if they cannot sue the states for damages in federal court.

40|$|Unenumerated {{rights are}} {{expressly}} protected against federal infringement {{by the original}} meaning of the Ninth Amendment and against <b>state</b> <b>infringement</b> by the original meaning of the Privileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Despite this textual recognition, unenumerated rights have received inconsistent and hesitant protection ever since these provisions were enacted, and what protection they do receive is subject to intense criticism. In this essay, the author examines why some are afraid to enforce unenumerated rights. While this reluctance seems most obviously to stem from the uncertainty of ascertaining the content of unenumerated rights, he contends that underlying this concern are more basic assumptions about legislative sovereignty and {{the proper role of}} judges. The author explains why a proper conception of constitutional legitimacy requires that unenumerated rights be protected somehow, that judicial protection is not as problematic as commonly thought once it is acknowledged that all liberty may be reasonably regulated (as opposed to prohibited), and that we need to ascertain the scope of unenumerated rights only to identify wrongful behavior that may be prohibited altogether because it invariably violates the rights of others...|$|R
50|$|Tully {{carefully}} distinguishes his expanded {{notion of}} citizenship (diverse, cooperative, civic, global) from the narrower but more conventional notion of citizenship, {{which he calls}} “civil citizenship” (modern, institutional, and international). Where civic denotes practice and pluralism, civil citizenship singularly refers to “a status given by {{the institutions of the}} modern constitutional state in international law.” This kind of (civil) citizenship is associated with the dominant tradition of liberalism, in which the state ensures a free market, a set of negative liberties (especially protections against <b>state</b> <b>infringements</b> into the private sphere), and a narrow range of participation through institutions of free speech and representative government. Tully argues that this dominant module of civil citizenship is neither universal nor inevitable; rather, it is “one singular, historical form of citizenship among others.” More problematically, the civil tradition often plays handmaiden to empire, insofar as imperial powers operate under international banners of ‘progress’ and ‘liberalism’:the dominant forms of representative democracy, self-determination and democratisation promoted through international law are not alternatives to imperialism, but, rather, the means through which informal imperialism operates against the wishes {{of the majority of the}} population of the post-colonial world.|$|R

The amendments stated that polygamy was legally harmful to a first wife and entitled her to sue for divorce within a year after learning of her husband's second marriage. The amendments also entitled the first wife to compensation. A husband retained the right to divorce his wife without recourse to the courts, but he was required to file for his divorce before witnesses at a registrar's office and officially and immediately to inform his wife. The divorced wife was entitled to alimony equivalent to one year's maintenance in addition to compensation equivalent to two years' maintenance; a court could increase these amounts under extenuating circumstances such as the dissolution of a long marriage. The divorced wife automatically retained custody of sons under the age of ten and daughters under twelve; courts could extend the mother's custody of minors until their eighteenth birthdays.|$|R

The aims are to identify factors which can enhance compliance with the underlying laws and the administrative arrangements for enforcing them. These research aims are in line with several of the broad outcomes describing the Government’s longer term aspirations for the community and which are associated with the Victorian Department of Justice’s strategic objectives, namely that ‘the legal rights of all persons are protected through a just, responsive and accessible legal system in which the Victorian community has confidence’ and that ‘offenders in Victoria are treated in a just and humane manner and encouraged to adopt law abiding lifestyle’ (Strategic Directions for Justice in Victoria 2001 - 2006, Department of Justice, victoria, November 2001). In addition, the research meets the objectives of the Department’s Strategic Research Plan 2001 - 2005 in relation too the need for collaborative applied research into alternative criminal sanctions and their enforcement.

40|$|Few {{people think}} about gun control and term limits in the same way. They {{generally}} favor one or the other, but not both or neither. The thesis of this Article, however, {{is that the two}} concepts are connected - or at least that the Framers of the United States Constitution would have found a connection between the two - and that theconnection between the two affects the way we should think about the subjects. This Article asserts that the two concepts are related because both gun control and term limits can infringe on {{the right of the people}} as ultimate sovereign to control thegovernment entities created to carry out the sovereign will - term limits, by interfering with the people 2 ̆ 7 s right to choose their representatives in the national lawmaking process; gun control, by interfering with the people 2 ̆ 7 s right to use force, if necessary, to resist efforts to wrest control of sovereign authority from the people. This Article maintains that because the two concepts are thus related, the basic theories, principles, and reasoning used to determine the constitutional legitimacy of one should be relevant to the constitutionality of the other. Structural constitutional limitations that prevent <b>state</b> <b>infringement</b> on the sovereign right of the people to choose their representatives should also prevent infringement onthe sovereign right of the people to use force to prevent tyrannical misuse of governmental authority. This Article attempts to demonstrate the validity and implication of this thesis by showing that the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s decision in U. S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton concerning the constitutionality of state-imposed term limitations for congressional elections provides some interesting insights into the scope of protection that should be given to the right of the people to keep and bear arms. Part I explains the reasoning of both the majority and dissent in Thornton and discusses how that reasoning is relevant to the debate concerning the right to keep and beararms. Part II then explores how several key issues in the Second Amendment debate would be resolved if viewed in light of Thornton. Part II concludes that application ofthe majority 2 ̆ 7 s reasoning in Thornton supports the position that the Constitution protects the people 2 ̆ 7 s right to keep and bear arms from both federal and <b>state</b> <b>infringement.</b> Moreover, viewed in light of Thornton, the right to keep and bear arms is both a collective and an individual right [...] broader than most gun control advocates and many scholars contend, but narrower than those on the opposite end of the issue have argued. Finally, consideration of the right to keep and bear arms in light of Thorntonsuggests that more may be at stake in the recent discussion about the continued relevancy of this right in today 2 ̆ 7 s society than has been appreciated up until now. If, as this Article suggests, the right to keep and bear arms is an essential attribute of sovereignty, there are legal and policy arguments counseling against its wholesale abandonment that have yet to be addressed by those who advocate that position. Those arguments raise issues warranting extensive consideration and discussion in our modern society...|$|R
