5|$|Other mammals {{found in}} Greater London are hedgehogs, rats, mice, rabbit, shrew, vole, and squirrels, In wilder areas of Outer London, such as Epping Forest, {{a wide variety}} of mammals are found {{including}} hare, badger, field, bank and water vole, wood mouse, yellow-necked mouse, mole, shrew, and weasel, in addition to fox, squirrel and hedgehog. A dead otter was found at The Highway, in Wapping, about a mile from the Tower Bridge, which would suggest that they have begun to move back after being absent a hundred years from the city. Ten of England's eighteen species of bats have been recorded in Epping Forest: soprano, nathusius and common pipistrelles, noctule, <b>serotine,</b> barbastelle, daubenton's, brown Long-eared, natterer's and leisler's.|$|E
5|$|In {{recognition}} {{of the fact that}} many people use the towpath to exercise their dogs, dog dips have been installed at Allbrook and Shawford. These provide easy access into the water for dogs, and owners are encouraged to only allow dogs to swim at these locations, to conserve the bank in other places. The water vole surveys have followed the best practice described in the Water Vole Conservation Handbook (2006), and have also recorded evidence of otter, brown rat and American mink populations. While carrying out the work, the surveyors have also counted sightings of kingfisher, heron, moorhen and coot. The bat survey recorded common pipistrelle, soprano pipistrelle, Daubenton's, noctule and <b>serotine</b> bats in 2011. Bat boxes have been erected near Allbrook, and there was some evidence that they were being used. The 2009 fisheries survey recorded large numbers of young Atlantic salmon in the lower river, but although fish weirs have been provided, wild parr were not recorded near Winchester. Above there, a large population of brown trout thrives. Eels were monitored {{for the first time in}} 2009, when their distribution was found to be variable.|$|E

40|$|In {{the course}} of the {{collection}} of bats for a cytological study of the organs related to the reproductive capacity, a number of observations on the reproductive cycle have been made. These are presented here because of the interest aroused by many aspects of the sexual cycle of the bat and the scant information available. The period of hibernation in many of the bats of the temperate zone occurs between an autumnal insemination and a vernal ovulation and gestation. Miller (1931) cited bats as examples of what he termed type I of mammalian sexual behavior in which the mating behavior in both sexes is limited to short, definitely determined periods that are usually seasonal. Heape (1900) used the bat as an illustration of the statement that ovulation may occur without the coincidence of estrus. Courrier (1927) reviewed the work of earlier students of the bat. Of ·these, Benecke (1879) and Eimer (1879) formulated the interpretation that coitus occurred only in the fall and that the sperm introduced at that time were responsible for the activation of the eggs that were ovulated in the spring. However, Robin and Vogt (1881) believed that copu-lation should occur again in the spring because the male ducts contained sperm at that season and young females were not inseminated in the fall. Duval (1895) observed coitus in three pairs of Rhinolophes in May, and Rollinat and Trouessart (1896) reported erection in male <b>Serotines</b> in February. After studying the period of spermatogenesis and the secondary sex characters of seven kinds of bats, Courrier con-cluded that coitus in the spring was exceptional, although he observed attempts at copulation during the winter and spring.

40|$|The {{increasing}} use of non-woven materials, such as breathable roofing membranes (BRMs) within {{buildings that}} either currently contain a bat roost or may do in the future, has led to concerns over bat safety by those involved in bat conservation in the UK. Whilst some information is currently available on the selection of roosts in roofs by bats, along with technical specifications of individual membranes, there is no research that has investigated the interactions between the two. Prior to determining the methods needed to test interactions between bats and BRMs, a series of preliminary investigations were conducted; including research and physical measurements on selected anatomical features of bats commonly found roosting in buildings in the UK. Data on body size and shape were gathered {{from a combination of}} experimental measurements of bat specimens (deceased) and information collated from literature. Data on bat claw morphology were collected by applying a method used to measure raptor talons, measurements obtained included; width, length and the curvature (hook ratio) of their claws. The results of this research provide additional information about bat body and claw morphometrics. It was found that bat species/group had a significant effect upon the length, width and curvature of the claws (to varying degrees). Pipistrelle species have the shortest and third narrowest claws, whereas <b>serotines</b> have the longest and widest claws on average. The curvature of the claws does not vary greatly between species; however, more variation was seen in the lower portion of the claws. The results from this research also demonstrate that the current standard industry tests do not represent the fine scale at which a bats claws interact with their roosting surfaces. Consequently, this information can be used to aid the development of industry tests for determining the suitability of BRMs for use in bat roosts...|$|R

50|$|The <b>serotine</b> bat has {{declined}} {{in many areas}} in its European range. Loss of feeding habitat {{is thought to have}} played a part in the decline. In addition, as this bat almost exclusively roosts in buildings, it is highly vulnerable to disturbance from construction work and toxic timber treatments. In the United Kingdom <b>serotine</b> bats benefit from a very comprehensive level of legal protection, as is the case across much of Europe.|$|E

50|$|<b>Serotine</b> bats mainly use {{buildings}} for summer roosts, especially those older buildings with high gables and cavity walls, and often occur in churches; modern buildings are used infrequently. The roost is normally accessed {{at or near}} the gable apex or the lower eaves. The <b>serotine</b> bat is hardly ever found in trees, which were the most likely pre-human roost sites, and the species seems to be very oriented towards using buildings. The roost is sometimes shared with pipistrelles or brown long-eared bats, and this species has also been recorded associating with Natterer's bats, whiskered bats and noctule bats. Only a few <b>serotine</b> bats have been found in winter, but it seems likely that most hibernate in buildings in cavity walls and disused chimneys. There are a few records of them being found in the coldest parts of caves, either in roof crevices or in accumulations of boulders.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>serotine</b> bat {{has long}} fur which {{on the back}} is smoky-brown in colour, while the underparts are a paler yellowish-brown, the nose and {{triangular}} shaped ears are black, and the membranes of the wings are dark black or brown. The juveniles are darker than the adults. <b>Serotine</b> bats are easy to identify in flight, because its broad wings combined with its slow, highly manoeuvrable, flapping flight interspersed with brief glides is distinictive. [...] The tragus has a relatively thin and pointed shape and is not kidney shaped as in Nyctalus.|$|E
