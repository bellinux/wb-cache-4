40|$|Relevance of <b>subsoil</b> <b>irrigation</b> usage {{for growing}} feed crops on {{alluvial}} meadow soils is shown. Distribution of pjezometric pressure, {{along the water}} emitter line during the irrigating period, is analyzed. Formation of moisture patterns in the soil regarding the quantities of irrigating water and emitters design are considered. In order to define the characteristics of moisture patterns in the soil, depending on the quantities of irrigating water, the ratios of vertical water spreading Kv and forms Kf are calculated. Expediency of usage low irrigating rates is substantiated. As a result of research, mathematical relations were derived in order to define water outlays in the emitters made of pottery tubes with diameter 50 mm under water pressure at the line 0. 1 … 0. 7 m. It is determined that usage of <b>subsoil</b> <b>irrigation</b> allows increase of commercial crop harvest, significantly save water resources, labour and energy comparing to sprinkling...|$|E
40|$|Symbiotic N 2 {{fixation}} by alfalfa provides substantial {{amounts of}} nitrogen (N) to livestock operations, subsequent crops, and soil organic matter. Fixed N can be a pollutant if alfalfa is not managed well. Symbiotic N 2 fixation is an adaptive process that declines as other N supplies increase. Well-managed stands of alfalfa effectively absorb mineralized N from manure and remove residual nitrate from the <b>subsoil,</b> <b>irrigation</b> water, and shallow ground water, and fix less N from the air. Although N losses can occur both during and after alfalfa production, {{it is possible to}} use this adaptive N 2 fixation process to reduce excess N supplies on farms...|$|E
40|$|Turkmenistan, {{like all}} Central Asian countries, is {{critically}} dependent on water {{because of its}} arid desert climate. The Amudarya, flowing from the Pamir and Tien-Shan Mountains to the tragically dying Aral Sea, is {{the main source of}} water for all agricultural and non-agricultural uses in Turkmenistan. Given the constancy of water resources and the rapidly growing population in the country, the annual water availability per capita decreased by 50 % during the last 35 years, dropping to 4, 000 cu. m in 2004. Water has thus become the principal strategic resource that determines the region‘s economic development options. Water allocation from Amudarya is governed by regional agreements between all Central Asian states. Turkmenistan‘s share is 22 cu. km per year, or 36 % of the river‘s total runoff. Agriculture is the main water user in Turkmenistan, consuming 95 % of the available resources. The emphasis on the expansion of cotton production in the Soviet era and the strategy of food self-sufficiency aggressively implemented since 1992 have led to accelerated growth of irrigated areas, which increased by nearly 4 times in the last 40 years, reaching 2. 3 million hectares. Almost half this area – 1 million hectares – has been added during the 15 years since independence. Irrigation is expanded without proper engineering attention to efficient conveyance of water, using mostly unlined canals and ditches with loss rates exceeding 30 %. Effective water use per hectare of irrigated land has steadily declined, and it is now one-half of its level in 1970. Inadequate water availability {{is one of the reasons}} for low crop yields in Turkmenistan. The expansion of the collector-drainage network lags far behind the expansion of irrigation: between 2000 - 2004 the collector-drainage network grew by 7 %, while the irrigated area increased by 26 %. This has led to accelerated rise of the groundwater table, deterioration of soil quality, and increased salinity. More that 1. 6 million hectares, or 73 % of irrigated land in Turkmenistan, is salinated. Increased use of concrete or plastic lined ditches, adoption of new efficient technologies – sprinkling, drip-irrigation, <b>subsoil</b> <b>irrigation,</b> and careful attention to water consumption for crop irrigation will significantly reduce water losses and seepage into the ground, and alleviate the problems associated with rising groundwater table. Adoption of water-saving technologies is costly, but it is essential for improved efficiency of water use. This technological approach will make it possible to increase the irrigated area in Turkmenistan to 4 - 5 million hectares while actually raising crop yields. It will thus help the country‘s agriculture achieve its economic potential. Resource /Energy Economics and Policy,...|$|E
40|$|Insufficient {{water is}} the {{greatest}} limitation to crop production and choice of crops grown in the Northern Great Plains. Supplemental irrigation can overcome this limitation. Uncertainties about the drainage capacity of fine-textured subsoils {{and the effect of}} irrigation on soil properties have impeded irrigation development. In this study we quantified salinity changes in soils with fine-textured subsoils receiving a range of irrigation treatments. Alfalfa (Medicago saliva L.) was planted in 18 non-weighing lysimeters at two sites having fine-textured <b>subsoils.</b> <b>Irrigation</b> was applied at three levels so that irrigation plus precipitation equaled either one, two, or three times the calculated evapotranspiration rate using two water qualities (electrical conductivity of irrigation water [EC 1] 0. 1 S m‒ 1, sodium adsorption ratio of irrigation water [SARi] 4; or ECi 0. 34 S m‒ 1, SARi 16). Changes in the electrical conductivity of saturated soil extracts (ECe) and the sodium adsorption ratio of saturated soil extracts (SARe) were determined from soil cores collected to a depth of 1. 5 m nine times between the years of 1984 and 1993. Averaged across irrigation levels, the profile-averaged ECe increased from 0. 03 to 0. 12 S m‒ 1 and the SARe increased from 1 to 6 in lysimeters receiving the 0. 1 S m‒ 1 water. In lysimeters receiving the 0. 34 S m‒ 1 water, the profile-averaged ECe increased from 0. 03 to 0. 23 S m‒ 1 and the SARe increased from 1 to 11. Salinity exhibited seasonal fluctuations. Changes in sodicity were persistent, exhibiting little seasonal variation. Supplemental irrigation of alfalfa is a viable management option in the Northern Great Plains when irrigation water quality is not a problem...|$|R

Several species of grasses including C. pennisetiformis, Diplachne fusca, Panicum turgidum and Pennisetum divisum are able to provide good grazing for livestock and even dairy enterprises in these areas.

40|$|AbstractYoung Populus tremula, Salix viminalis, Betula pendula and Picea abies {{trees were}} grown {{together}} in large open-top chambers. The treat-ments were: without or with (Cu/Zn/Cd/Pb 640 / 3000 / 10 / 90 mg kg 1) metal contamination in the topsoil, irrigation pH 3. 5 or 5. 5, and acidic or calcareous subsoil. Growth, metal allocation to foliage and wood, {{as well as}} leaf gas exchange were measured. Biomass was reduced in P. tremula and B. pendula by the metal-contaminated topsoil relative to uncontaminated topsoil, whereas in P. tremula photosynthesis and tran-spiration were decreased. These effects {{were related to the}} elevated foliar Zn accumulation in P. tremula. S. viminalis showed a significant re-duction in growth and an increased Zn and Cd accumulation on acidic vs. calcareous <b>subsoil.</b> Acidic <b>irrigation</b> produced only a few significant effects.

40|$|Mobilization {{of natural}} nitrate (NO 3 -) {{deposits}} in the <b>subsoil</b> by <b>irrigation</b> water in arid and semiarid regions {{has the potential}} to produce large groundwater NO 3 - concentrations. The use of isotopes to distinguish between natural and anthropogenic NO 3 - sources in these settings could be complicated by the wide range in δ 15 N values of natural NO 3 -. An 10 000 year record of paleore-charge from the regionally extensive High Plains aquifer indicates that δ 15 N values for NO 3 - derived from natural sources ranged from 1. 3 to 12. 3 ‰ and increased systematically from the northern to the southern High Plains. This collective range in δ 15 N values spans the range that might be interpreted as evidence for fertilizer and animal-waste sources of NO 3 -; however, the δ 15 N values for NO 3 - in modern recharge (3 ̆c 50 years) under irrigated fields were, for the most part, distinctly different from those of paleorecharge when viewed in the overall regional context. An inverse relation was observed between the δ 15 N[NO 3 -] values and the NO 3 -/Cl- ratios in paleorecharge that is qualitatively consistent with fractionating losses of N increasing from north to south in the High Plains. N and O isotope data for NO 3 - are consistent with both NH 3 volatilization and denitrification, having contributed to fractionating losses of N prior to recharge. The relative importance of different isotope fractionating processes may be influenced by regional climate patterns as well as by local variation in soils, vegetation, topography, and moisture conditions...|$|R
40|$|Irrigation of {{rice fields}} in Bangladesh with arsenic-contaminated {{groundwater}} transfers tens of cubic kilometers {{of water and}} {{thousands of tons of}} arsenic from aquifers to rice fields each year. Here we combine observations of infiltration patterns with measurements of porewater chemical composition from our field site in Munshiganj Bangladesh to characterize the mobility of arsenic in soils beneath rice fields. We find that very little arsenic delivered by irrigation returns to the aquifer, and that recharging water mobilizes little, if any, arsenic from rice field <b>subsoils.</b> Arsenic from <b>irrigation</b> water is deposited on surface soils and sequestered along flow paths that pass through bunds, the raised soil boundaries around fields. Additionally, timing of flow into bunds limits the transport of biologically available organic carbon from rice fields into the subsurface where it could stimulate reduction processes that mobilize arsenic from soils and sediments. Together, these results explain why groundwater irrigated rice fields act as net sinks of arsenic from groundwater. Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology.

50|$|A {{variety of}} complex, interrelated {{problems}} frustrated realization of targeted irrigation goals. Technical problems with gypsum <b>subsoil,</b> which caused <b>irrigation</b> canals to collapse, proved more troublesome than at first anticipated. Large cost overruns {{on some of}} the irrigation projects made them much more expensive than planned and created difficulties in financing additional projects. Moreover, these large irrigation projects required several years before returns on the investments began. There was also doubt about whether farmers could be attracted back from urban areas or enticed from more crowded agricultural areas to the sparsely populated Euphrates Valley. Another complication is that the Euphrates flow is insufficient for the irrigation needs of the three countries—Turkey, Iraq, and Syria that share the river. In 1962, talks on allotment of Euphrates water began and continued sporadically throughout the 1970s and early 1980s, but acrimonious relations between Syria and Iraq hampered final agreements. In fact, in 1978 when Syria began filling Lake Assad and water to Iraq was greatly reduced, the two countries almost went to war. In addition, Turkey's use of Euphrates' waters for its Keban Dam assures that water levels in Lake Assad will remain low. This problem will undoubtedly continue into the 1990s, when Turkey completes construction of the Atatürk Dam.|$|R
40|$|Vertical water fluxes at {{the water}} table and in the subsoil need to be {{quantified}} because of their significance for the supply of water to crops and the control of soil salinization in areas with shallow groundwater. A soilwateratmosphereplant (SWAP) model was calibrated using measured values of soil water content and the water fluxes {{at the water}} table. The measurements were taken in a field experiment where the depth to groundwater and the volume of irrigation water applied were controlled. The calibrated SWAP model was then used to simulate the soil water content and fluxes at the water table and in the <b>subsoil</b> under different <b>irrigation</b> and groundwater conditions. The predicted values provided a quantitative insight into specific terms in the water balance equation together with soil water fluxes in the subsoil that cannot be measured directly by field instruments. Crops utilized significant amounts of water from deeper soil layers and directly from groundwater, when the volume of irrigation decreased and the depth to the water table was < 3. 0 m. Depth to the water table significantly influenced water fluxes occurring in the soil profile over the period when evaporation dominated the hydrological cycle. Shallow groundwater is a very significant water resource for meeting the water requirement of crops. In practice, the frequency and quantity of irrigation need to be varied according to groundwater conditions...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Zone {{subsoiling}} on {{irrigated land}} {{has been successfully}} used to improve potato (Solanum tuberosum L) yield and quality. Zone <b>subsoiling</b> under furrow <b>irrigation</b> may disrupt water flow and influence infiltration and soil erosion. We hypothesized that zone subsoiling, done appropriately, will maintain integrity of irrigation furrows, improve small grain and dry bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) growth and yield, and not adversely affect water flow, infiltration, or erosion on furrow—irrigated soils. The experiment was conducted at the USDA—ARS Northwest Irrigation and Soils Research Laboratory in Kimberly, Idaho. The soil is a Portneuf silt loam (coarse—silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Durinodic Xeric Haplocalcids). Tillage treatments were disk, disk + paratill, paratill, and no—till. There were no differences in water infiltration, runoff, or soil erosion among treatments. Bulk density differences among treatments were largest at the 0. 15 to 0. 20 —m depth, and bulk density was about 16 % to 18 % greater on disk and no—till treatments than on paratill treatments. The highest frequency of low cone index (CI) values belonged to paratill treatments (65 % to 80 % frequency of CI values less than 2 MPa); the lowest frequency of low CI values belonged to no—till treatment (20 % frequency less than 2 MPa). Cone index versus bulk density relationships depended on soil water content with a slope of 5. 81 (r 2 = 0. 70) in the wetter year of 1997, and 2. 90 in the drier year of 1995 (r 2 = 0. 60). Subsoiling can be accomplished on furrow—irrigated lands with no adverse effects on runoff, infiltration, and erosion, but under our conditions did not improve crop growth and yield...|$|R
