5|$|Blood {{was viewed}} as a potent source of {{nourishment}} for the Maya deities, and the <b>sacrifice</b> <b>of</b> a living creature was a powerful blood offering. By extension, the <b>sacrifice</b> <b>of</b> a human life was the ultimate offering of blood to the gods, and the most important Maya rituals culminated in human sacrifice. Generally only high status prisoners of war were sacrificed, with lower status captives being used for labour.|$|E
5|$|In the Epistle to the Hebrews, Abraham's {{willingness}} to follow God's command to sacrifice Isaac {{is used as}} an example of faith as is Isaac's action in blessing Jacob and Esau with reference to the future promised by God to Abraham In verse 19, the author views the release of Isaac from sacrifice as analogous to the resurrection of Jesus, the idea of the <b>sacrifice</b> <b>of</b> Isaac being a prefigure of the <b>sacrifice</b> <b>of</b> Jesus on the cross.|$|E

40|$|Vanessa Carbonell {{argues that}} <b>sacrifices</b> <b>of</b> self, unlike most other sacrifices, cannot be {{analyzed}} entirely {{in terms of}} wellbeing. For this reason, Car- bonell considers <b>sacrifices</b> <b>of</b> self as posing {{a problem for the}} wellbeing theory <b>of</b> <b>sacrifice</b> and for discussions about the demandingness of morality. In this paper I take issue with Carbonell 19 s claim that <b>sacrifices</b> <b>of</b> self cannot be captured as prudential harms. First, I explain why Carbonell considers <b>sacrifices</b> <b>of</b> self par- ticularly problematic. In order to determine whether some state of affairs is (or would be) harmful for someone, it is necessary to assume a particular account of welfare. In this paper, I assume the self-fulfillment account of welfare (Haybron 2008). I introduce this theory and show that it can account for the harm <b>of</b> <b>sacrifices</b> <b>of</b> self...|$|R

5|$|In rabbinical tradition, {{the age of}} Isaac at {{the time}} of binding is taken to be 37, which {{contrasts}} with common portrayals of Isaac as a child. The rabbis also thought that the reason for the death of Sarah was the news of the intended <b>sacrifice</b> <b>of</b> Isaac. The <b>sacrifice</b> <b>of</b> Isaac is cited in appeals for the mercy of God in later Jewish traditions. The post-biblical Jewish interpretations often elaborate the role of Isaac beyond the biblical description and primarily focus on Abraham's intended <b>sacrifice</b> <b>of</b> Isaac, called the aqedah ("binding"). According to a version of these interpretations, Isaac died in the sacrifice and was revived. According to many accounts of Aggadah, unlike the Bible, it is Satan who is testing Isaac as an agent of God. Isaac's willingness to follow God's command at the cost of his death has been a model for many Jews who preferred martyrdom to violation of the Jewish law.|$|E

5|$|Reformed confessions {{reject the}} Catholic {{doctrine}} that the Eucharist is a <b>sacrifice</b> <b>of</b> propitiation, or sacrifice to satisfy God's wrath and attain forgiveness of sins. Instead, they teach that Christ's body {{is only to}} be received, not re-presented to God as a sacrifice. The confessions do sometimes speak of the Supper as a <b>sacrifice</b> <b>of</b> thanksgiving for the gift of propitiation which has been received. In the twentieth century, Scottish Reformed theologian T. F. Torrance developed a strong doctrine of Eucharistic sacrifice. He argued that Christ's person and work could not be separated, and that the Eucharist mediated his sacrificial death.|$|E

5|$|Although {{there are}} {{differences}} between the northern and southern Betsimisaraka, many major aspects of their culture are similar. Major customs among the Betsimisaraka include sambatra (circumcision), folanaka (the birth of a tenth child), ritual <b>sacrifice</b> <b>of</b> zebu for the ancestors, and celebrating the inauguration of a newly constructed house. Marriage, death, birth, the New Year and Independence Day are also communally celebrated. The practice of tromba (ritual spirit possession) is widespread among the Betsimisaraka. Both men and women act as mediums and spectators in these events.|$|E
5|$|Animal <b>Sacrifice</b> <b>of</b> {{a buffalo}} or goat, {{particularly}} during smallpox epidemics, has been practiced {{in parts of}} South India. The sacrificed animal is dedicated to a goddess, and is probably related to the myth of goddess Kali in Andhra Pradesh, but in Karnataka, the typical goddess is Renuka. According to Alf Hiltebeitel – a professor of Religions, History and Human Sciences, these ritual animal sacrifices, with some differences, mirrors goddess-related ritual animal sacrifice found in Gilgamesh epic and in texts of Egyptian, Minoan and Greek sources.|$|E
