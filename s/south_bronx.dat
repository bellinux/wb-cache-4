Herc said he retreated from the scene after being stabbed at the Executive Playhouse while trying to intercede in a fight, and the burning down {{of one of his}} venues.

25|$|By 1970, the 130,000-resident {{population}} of Brownsville was 77% black and 19% Puerto Rican. Despite {{the activities of}} black civil rights {{organizations such as the}} NAACP and Urban League whose Brooklyn chapters were based in nearby Bedford-Stuyvesant, they were, overall, less concerned with the issues of the lower-income blacks who had moved into Brownsville, thus further isolating Brownsville's population. These changes corresponded to overall increases in segregation and inequality in New York City, {{as well as to the}} replacement of blue-collar with white-collar jobs. The area gained a reputation for violence and poverty that was similar to the <b>South</b> <b>Bronx's,</b> a reputation that persisted through the 21st century.|$|R

2500|$|The {{reasons for}} Brownsville's lack of {{wholesale}} gentrification are numerous. One {{reporter for the}} magazine The Nation observed that the Los Angeles neighborhood of Pico-Union, which had a poverty rate similar to Brownsville's in 2000, had become a Businessweek [...] "next hot neighborhood" [...] by 2007. Brownsville had not seen a similar revitalization because, unlike Pico-Union, {{it had not been}} surrounded by gentrified neighborhoods; did not have desirable housing; and was not a historic district or an area of other significance. In addition, Brownsville is unlike similar neighborhoods in New York City that had since gentrified. The <b>South</b> <b>Bronx's</b> coastline gave way to attractions like Barretto Point Park; Bedford-Stuyvesant had cheap brownstones similar to the expensive ones in Park Slope, Fort Greene, and Prospect Heights; and Bushwick and Greenpoint became popular places for young professional workers once Williamsburg had become highly sought due to its waterfront location and proximity to Manhattan. By contrast, Brownsville is surrounded by other high-poverty, high-crime neighborhoods like East New York, Ocean Hill, and East Flatbush. Its high concentration of public housing developments has traditionally prevented gentrification in this area. Brownsville is still majority African-American and Latino, with exactly two Jewish-owned businesses in Brownsville in 2012.|$|R

In November 2016, the first two Links were installed in Brooklyn, along Fulton Street in the Bedford–Stuyvesant neighborhood, with plans to install nine more Links in various places around Brooklyn before year's end, especially around Prospect Park and LIU Brooklyn.
