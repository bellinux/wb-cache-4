Microfiche. xvi, 189 leaves, bound ill. 29 cmA {{series of}} four {{experiments}} {{was conducted to}} investigate the influence. of three video system parameters on the scaling of depth intervals with a stereoscopic (stereo) television display. A geometrical model of TV stereoscopy is presented which describes the influence of variations of the three video system parameters on retinal disparities. Experiment One investigated the independent and interactive effects of camera interaxial separation and lens magnification on depth interval scaling. Experiment Two investigated the effects of camera convergence angle on depth interval scaling. Experiments Three and Four partially replicated the video system parameters used in Experiment One under more complex scene conditions. For all experiments, ocular fatigue induced by various combinations of video system parameters was also measured. Four trained observers participated in Experiments One and Two. An additional observer participated in Experiments Three and Four. The apparatus used to produce depth intervals in the televised scene was a Howard-Dolman two-rod device. Rods were set to a pre-selected depth interval and observers were required to verbally report perceived depth interval and match the depth interval haptically {{by means of a}} <b>sliding</b> <b>peg</b> device. Stereoscopic TV imagery was provided by means of a beamsplitter camera station and a polarizer display station. All experiments included monoscopic (2 -D) and direct view control conditions. Ocular fatigue tests which were administered included a questionnaire, flicker fusion threshold adjustments, and a near-far test of oculomotor adjustment time. Multifactorial repeated-measures analyses of covariance were performed on data derived from all experiments with a. 05 level set for statistical significance. For Experiments One, Two, and Three stereoscopic imagery produced depth interval estimates which were superior to those found under monoscopic viewing conditions. In addition, increasing camera separation and thereby increasing disparities beyond "natural stereo" values produced improvements in depth interval estimation. Camera convergence exerted a significant effect on performance with camera convergence in front of objects to be compared in depth providing highest accuracy. Lens magnification, which affected retinal disparities, was not found to exert a significant influence on depth interval estimation. For all experiments, no evidence of ocular fatigue was found under any conditions tested. Results are discussed in light of previous studies of depth resolution with stereo TV displays, geometrical models of retinal disparities, and models to account for the discrepancies in depth perception observed between stereo TV and direct viewing conditions...|$|E
40|$|Faced {{with the}} two {{extremes}} of fixed and rigid parities on the one hand, and a system of floating rates on the other, many economists have proposed a system based on official sliding parities. According to this line of reasoning, floating exchanges is unachievable politically and therefore this solution would be the maximum concession towards floating that one may hope to negotiate. In this paper, the authors develop a different argument in favour of <b>sliding</b> <b>pegs</b> as compared to either extremes and conclude that such a system combines the advantages of short-run fixity in mitigating propagation of cyclical disturbances with long-run or structural changes in surplus or deficit.

50|$|The bolívar was a {{very stable}} {{currency}} for a decade after 1964, but by the early 1980s it was in serious trouble. A peg to the US dollar at 14·50 bolívares did not halt the <b>slide.</b> Neither <b>peg,</b> nor crawling peg, nor managed float could keep the bolívar exchange rate under control. It went from 47 per dollar in 1990 to 177 in 1995, to 680 in 2000, and to 2090 in 2005.|$|R

50|$|Saving the notched piece until last, set {{two pieces}} {{so they are}} facing away from each other, such as db, then place another between them at a 45 degree angle in a U shape. This will make {{the bottom of the}} sphere and serve as a {{platform}} for the other pieces. Rest the pieces on the middle finger to give them a firm base, with the thumb and first finger reaching through the U shaped piece so that the two db pieces can be held. Using the U shaped pieces as a table place two other pieces on either side of it, they will curve towards each other so that they hold the db pieces up, they will link together so that it won't be as wobbly. Then the notched piece should be slide down from the top, but it'll be stopped by two pegs. The notched piece will now give the side pieces a brace so they don't fall inward. The notched piece should be slid in so the first notch near the edge will meet the two pegs below it, push it onto the pegs, if done carefully this will cause one of the pegged pieces to sink down, as the first peg clears the center beam, move it more towards the center of the sphere, so the second notch is over the second <b>peg.</b> <b>Slide</b> the <b>pegged</b> piece back upward, now only the notched piece will be out of place. To lock the pegged piece into place push the notched piece to its center position.|$|R
40|$|Planning a {{goal-directed}} {{sequence of}} behavior {{is a higher}} function {{of the human brain}} that relies on the integrity of prefrontal cortical areas. In the Tower of London test, a puzzle in which beads <b>sliding</b> on <b>pegs</b> must be moved to match a designated goal configuration, patients with lesioned prefrontal cortex show deficits in planning a goal-directed sequence of moves. We propose a neuronal network model of sequence planning that passes this test and, when lesioned, fails in a way that mimics prefrontal patients’ behavior. Our model comprises a descending planning system with hierarchically organized plan, operation, and gesture levels, and an ascending evaluative system that analyzes the problem and computes internal reward signals that index the correct/erroneous status of the plan. Multiple parallel pathways connecting the evaluative and planning systems amend the plan and adapt it to the current problem. The model illustrates how specialized hierarchically organized neuronal assemblies may collectively emulate central executive or supervisory functions of the human brain...|$|R

To accomplish this manoeuvre in live shows, a hitching mechanism which Jackson co-patented was built into {{the floor of the}} stage and the performers' shoes, thereby allowing performers to lean without needing to keep their centers of mass directly over their feet. The system consists of pegs that rise from the stage at the appropriate moment and special shoes with ankle supports and cutouts in the heels which can <b>slide</b> over the <b>pegs</b> and be temporarily attached to the stage.|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} a one-pot {{strategy for the}} fabrication of novel slide-ring (SR) gels based on supramolecular polyrotaxane structures with cyclodextrin-derived cross-links and additional free cyclodextrin ring spacers co-threaded onto the polymer backbones. Photoinitiated thiol-yne click coupling leads to facile hydrogel fabrication from pseudo-polyrotaxanes prepared in situ from β-cyclodextrin derivatives and bifunctional polyethylene glycol (PEG). The obtained SR gels were characterized by NMR spectroscopy using a polyrotaxane model compound with the ratio of cyclodextrin <b>sliding</b> spacers to <b>PEG</b> backbone controlled by adjusting the feed ratio of the starting materials. This structural tuning leads to {{dramatic changes in the}} rheological properties, mechanical properties, and swelling behavior of the SR gels. In addition, the coupling of simple synthetic procedures with enhanced properties offers a versatile approach to novel elastomeric materials...|$|R
40|$|Most of the {{following}} paragraphs were copied from wikipedia [I]. Pictures were borrowed from [2] and [3]. The Tower of Hanoi or Towers of Hanoi is a mathematical game or puzzle. It consists of three pegs, {{and a number of}} disks of different sizes which can <b>slide</b> onto any <b>peg.</b> The puzzle starts with the disks neatly stacked in order of size on one peg, smallest at the top, thus making a conical shape. The objective of the game is to move the entire stack to another peg, obeying {{the following}} rules: Only one disk may be moved at a time. Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the <b>pegs</b> and <b>sliding</b> it onto another peg, {{on top of the other}} disks that may already be present on that peg. No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk. The puzzle was invented by the Rench mathematician ~douard Lucas in 1883. There is a legend about an Indian temple which contains a large room with three time-worn posts in it surrounded by 64 golden disks. The priests of Brahma, acting out the command of an ancient prophecy, have been moving these disks, in accordance with the rules o...|$|R
30|$|We {{have used}} ToF-SIMS imaging and PCA to analyze {{patterned}} polymers surfaces functionalized with N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) [67, 68]. For this, commercially available <b>slides</b> with a <b>PEG</b> based coating were patterned using standard photolithography methods. The surfaces were imaged using ToF-SIMS {{and the images}} were analyzed using PCA of the normalized, mean centered data. PC 1 was able to separate the NHS from the methoxy regions with good fidelity matching the originally designed pattern. The loadings separating the two regions were seen to contain peaks characteristic of the two compounds. Interestingly PC 3 showed a dark outline around {{the border between the}} two regions. From the PC 3 loadings it was determined that these dark regions corresponded with the photoresist material used in the pattern creation. The presence of residual photoresist had not been previously reported in other studies using a similar patterning method. This study presents {{a good example of how}} the combination of PCA with ToF-SIMS data can often pick up trends or identify components from complex data sets that would otherwise be overlooked by the analyst. The ability to identify the presence of submonolayer quantities of unexpected organic contaminants on an organic surface is particularly challenging, but as this study shows the combination of ToF-SIMS and PCA is well suited for this type of challenging analysis.|$|R
40|$|Objective: A new {{protocol}} for fixation and slide preservation was evaluated {{in order to}} improve the quality of immunocytochemical reactions on cytology slides. Methods: The quality of immunoreactions was evaluated retrospectively on 186 cytology slides (130 direct smears, 56 cytospins) prepared from different cytology samples. Ninety-three of the slides were air dried, stored at - 20 °C and fixed in acetone for 10 minutes (Protocol 1), whereas the other 93 were immediately fixed in methanol at - 20 °C for at least 30 minutes, subsequently protected with polyethylene glycol (PEG) and stored at room temperature (Protocol 2). Immunocytochemical staining, with eight primary antibodies, was performed on a Ventana BenchMark Ultra instrument using an UltraView Universal DAB Detection Kit. The following parameters were evaluated for each immunoreaction: morphology preservation, intensity of specific staining, background and counterstain. The slides were blinded and independently scored by four observers with marks from 0 to 20. Results: The quality of immunoreactions was better on methanol-fixed <b>slides</b> protected with <b>PEG</b> than on air-dried slides stored in the freezer: X¯ = 14. 44 ± 3. 58 versus X¯ = 11. 02 ± 3. 86, respectively (P < 0. 001). Conclusion: Immediate fixation of cytology slides in cold methanol with subsequent application of PEG is an easy and straightforward procedure that improves the quality of immunocytochemical reactions and allows the storage of the slides at room temperature...|$|R
40|$|In Ricci v. DeStefano, 129 S. Ct. 2658 (2009), the Supreme Court {{recently}} {{reaffirmed the}} doctrine, first articulated by the Court in Griggs v. Duke Power Company, 401 U. S. 424 (1971), that employers {{can be held}} liable under Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act for neutral personnel practices with a disparate impact on minority workers. The Griggs Court further held that employers can escape liability by showing that their staffing practices are job related or consistent with business necessity. In the interim since Griggs, social scientists have generated evidence undermining two key assumptions behind that decision and its progeny. First, the Court in Griggs noted the absence of evidence that the selection criteria in that case (a high school diploma and an aptitude test) were related to subsequent performance of the service jobs at issue, and expressed doubt {{about the existence of}} such a link. But research in industrial and organization psychology (IOP) has repeatedly documented that tests and criteria such as those at issue in Griggs (which are heavily “g”-loaded and thus dependent on cognitive ability) remain the best predictors of performance for jobs at all levels of complexity. Second, Griggs and its progeny rest on the implicit assumption, reflected in the so-called 4 / 5 rule, that fair and valid hiring criteria will result in a workplace that roughly reflects the representation of each group in the background population. Work in psychometrics and labor economics shows that this assumption is unjustified. Because blacks lag significantly behind whites on measures of cognitive ability, most valid job selection criteria will have a substantial adverse impact on this group. The combination of well-documented racial differences in cognitive ability and the consistent link between ability and job performance generates a pattern that experts term “the validity-diversity tradeoff”: job selection devices that best predict future job performance generate the smallest number of minority hires in a broad range of positions. Indeed, the evidence indicates that most valid screening devices will have a significant adverse impact on blacks and will also violate the 4 / 5 rule under the law of disparate impact. Because legitimately meritocratic (that is, job-related) job selection practices will routinely trigger prima facie violations of the disparate impact rule, employers who adopt such practices run the risk of being required to justify them – a costly and difficult task that encourages undesirable, self-protective behaviors and may result in unwarranted liability. To alleviate this burden, the article proposes to adopt a new regime of “disparate impact realism” that abandons the 4 / 5 rule in favor of <b>sliding</b> scale ratios <b>pegged</b> to measured disparities in group performance and the selectivity of particular positions. Alternatively, the disparate impact rule should be repealed altogether. The data indicate that pronounced differences in the background distribution of skill and human capital, not arbitrary hurdles imposed by employers, are the principle factor behind racial imbalances in most jobs. Moreover, blacks lag behind whites in actual on-the-job performance, which indicates that employers are not unfairly excluding minorities from the workforce but rather bending over backwards to include them. Disparate impact litigation, which does nothing to correct existing disparities and distracts from the task of addressing them, represents a cumbersome, misplaced effort that could better be directed at the root causes of workforce racial imbalance...|$|R
