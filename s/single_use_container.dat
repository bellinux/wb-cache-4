40|$|This product concept {{seeks to}} address three basic problems. First, nearly all liquid {{nutrition}} offerings that {{are readily available}} for people on the go do not offer personal choices for creating individually unique liquid replenishment. Second, there are no current offerings for protein drinks {{that do not require}} preparation. Protein drinks typically require extensive mixing and blending prior consumption. Last of all, readily available liquids for people on the go contribute to the consumption of <b>single</b> <b>use</b> <b>containers</b> and packaging which is not environmentally sound. The main purpose of this concept is to offer a quick, simple solution for health concerned people to enhance their life and to be the leader in introducing innovative, quality, and environmental friendly services to community. Promote personal health and environmental consciousness through healthy liquid replenishment into either personal reusable or environmental friendly containers.

25|$|Self-locking and {{sealable}} sharps containers {{are made}} of plastic so that the sharps can not easily penetrate through the sides. Such units are designed so that the whole container can be disposed of with other biohazardous waste. <b>Single</b> <b>use</b> sharps <b>containers</b> of various sizes are sold throughout the world. Large medical facilities may have their own 'mini' autoclave in which these sharps containers are disposed of with other medical wastes. This minimizes the distance the containers have to travel {{and the number of}} people to come in contact with the sharps waste. Smaller clinics or offices without such facilities are required by federal regulations to hire the services of a company that specializes in transporting and properly disposing of the hazardous wastes.|$|R
2500|$|The {{infrastructure}} of developing regions is {{not equipped to}} deal with this large volume of contaminated sharps waste. [...] Contrary to the industrialized world, disposal incinerators and transportation networks are not always available. [...] Cost restraints make the purchase of <b>single</b> <b>use</b> disposable <b>containers</b> unrealistic. Facilities are often overwhelmed with patients and understaffed with educated workers. Demand on these facilities can limit the emphasis or enforcement of waste disposal protocols. These factors leave a dangerous quantity of sharps waste in the environment. Contrasts between the industrialized and developing world segment can be seen in accidental needle stick injuries. These occur at a rate of [...]18 to [...]74 per person per year in industrialized nations and [...]93 to 4.68 per person per year in developing and transitional nations (Hutin, Hauri, Armstrong, 2003).|$|R

25|$|Intermodal {{containers}} are {{not strong}} enough for conversion to underground bunkers without additional bracing, as the walls cannot sustain much lateral pressure and will collapse. Also, the wooden floor of many <b>used</b> <b>containers</b> could contain some fumigation residues, rendering them unsuitable as confined spaces, such as for prison cells or bunkers. Cleaning or replacing the wood floor can make these <b>used</b> <b>containers</b> habitable, with proper attention to such essential issues as ventilation and insulation.|$|R

The solution to this is to run multiple containers on a dedicated machine. Each of these containers will exist completely isolated {{from the rest of}} the containers.
