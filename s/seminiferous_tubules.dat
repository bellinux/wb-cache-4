A study proved a male hybrid of the red hartebeest and the blesbok (Damaliscus pygargus) to be sterile. Sterility of the hybrid was attributed to difficulties in segregation during meiosis, indicated by azoospermia and a low number of germ cells in its <b>seminiferous</b> <b>tubules.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{process of}} {{spermatogenesis}} is highly sensitive to {{fluctuations in the}} environment, particularly hormones and temperature. Testosterone is required in large local concentrations to maintain the process, which is achieved via the binding of testosterone by androgen binding protein present in the <b>seminiferous</b> <b>tubules.</b> Testosterone is produced by interstitial cells, also known as Leydig cells, which reside adjacent to the <b>seminiferous</b> <b>tubules.</b>|$|E
25|$|Amphibians {{and most}} fish {{do not possess}} <b>seminiferous</b> <b>tubules.</b> Instead, the sperm are {{produced}} in spherical structures called sperm ampullae. These are seasonal structures, releasing their contents during the breeding season, and then being reabsorbed by the body. Before the next breeding season, new sperm ampullae begin to form and ripen.

25|$|Spermatocytogenesis is {{the male}} form of gametocytogenesis {{and results in}} the {{formation}} of spermatocytes possessing half the normal complement of genetic material. In spermatocytogenesis, a diploid spermatogonium, which resides in the basal compartment of the <b>seminiferous</b> <b>tubules,</b> divides mitotically, producing two diploid intermediate cells called primary spermatocytes. Each primary spermatocyte then moves into the adluminal compartment of the <b>seminiferous</b> <b>tubules</b> and duplicates its DNA and subsequently undergoes meiosis I to produce two haploid secondary spermatocytes, which will later divide once more into haploid spermatids. This division implicates sources of genetic variation, such as random inclusion of either parental chromosomes, and chromosomal crossover, to increase the genetic variability of the gamete.|$|E

40|$|Objective To {{study the}} effect of {{electromagnetic}} pulse (EMP) exposure on the permeability of blood-testicle barrier (BTB) in mice. Methods Adult male BALB/c mice were exposed to EMP at 200 kV/m for 200 pulses with 2 seconds interval. The mice were injected with 2 % Evans Blue solution through caudal vein at different time points after exposure, and the permeability of BTB was monitored using a fluorescence microscope. The testis sample for the transmission electron microscopy was prepared at 2 h after EMP exposure. The permeability of BTB in mice was observed by using Evans Blue tracer and lanthanum nitrate tracer. Results After exposure, cloudy Evans Blue {{was found in the}} testicle convoluted <b>seminiferous</b> <b>tubule</b> of mice. Lanthanum nitrate was observed not only between testicle spermatogonia near <b>seminiferous</b> <b>tubule</b> wall and sertoli cells, but also between sertoli cells and primary spermatocyte or secondary spermatocyte. In contrast, lanthanum nitrate in control group was only found in the testicle sertoli cells between <b>seminiferous</b> <b>tubule</b> and near <b>seminiferous</b> <b>tubule</b> wall.

40|$|Abstract. The potent {{smooth muscle}} agonist endothelin- 1 (ET- 1) is {{involved}} in the local control of <b>seminiferous</b> <b>tubule</b> contractility, which results in the forward propulsion of tubular fluid and spermatozoa, through its action on peritubular myoid cells. ET- 1, known to be produced in the seminiferous epithelium by Sertoli cells, is derived from the inactive intermediate big endothelin- 1 (big ET- 1) through a specific cleavage operated by the endothelin-converting enzyme (ECE), a membrane-bound metalloprotease with ectoenzymatic activity. The data presented suggest that the timing of <b>seminiferous</b> <b>tubule</b> contractility is controlled locally by the cyclic interplay between different cell types. We have studied the expression of ECE by Sertoli cells and used myoid cell cultures and <b>seminiferous</b> <b>tubule</b> explant...|$|R
25|$|During puberty, androgen, LH and {{follicle}} stimulating hormone (FSH) production {{increase and}} the sex cords hollow out, forming the <b>seminiferous</b> <b>tubules,</b> and the germ cells start to differentiate into sperm. Throughout adulthood, androgens and FSH cooperatively act on Sertoli cells in the testes to support sperm production. Exogenous androgen supplements {{can be used as}} a male contraceptive. Elevated androgen levels caused by use of androgen supplements can inhibit production of LH and block production of endogenous androgens by Leydig cells. Without the locally high levels of androgens in testes due to androgen production by Leydig cells, the <b>seminiferous</b> <b>tubules</b> can degenerate, resulting in infertility. For this reason, many transdermal androgen patches are applied to the scrotum.|$|E
25|$|Testicular seminoma {{originates}} in the germinal epithelium of the <b>seminiferous</b> <b>tubules.</b> About half of germ cell {{tumors of the}} testicles are seminomas.

Testes removed by unilateral castration of five animals were used. The testicular parenchyma was composed by 82. 1 ± 2. 2 % of <b>seminiferous</b> <b>tubule</b> and 17. 9 ± 2. 2 % of intertubular tissue. The tubular diameter was 249. 2 ± 33. 0 µm and the <b>seminiferous</b> <b>tubule</b> lenght per gram of testis was 19. 3 ± 4. 9 m. The spermatogonial mitoses efficiency coefficient, meiotic index and spermatogenesis efficiency were 10. 34, 2. 71 and 30. 5 respectively. Each Sertoli cell supported about 13 germinatives cells.

25|$|Spermatozoa are {{produced}} in the <b>seminiferous</b> <b>tubules</b> of the testes in a process called spermatogenesis. Round cells called spermatogonia divide and differentiate eventually to become spermatozoa. During copulation the cloaca or vagina gets inseminated, and then the spermatozoa move through chemotaxis to the ovum inside a Fallopian tube or the uterus.|$|E
25|$|The blood-testis barrier, {{maintained}} by the tight junctions between the Sertoli cells of the <b>seminiferous</b> <b>tubules,</b> prevents communication between the forming spermatozoa in the testis and the blood vessels (and immune cells circulating within them) within the interstitial space. This prevents them from eliciting an immune response. The blood-testis barrier is also important in preventing toxic substances from disrupting spermatogenesis.|$|E
25|$|Spermatozoa are {{the mature}} male gametes in many sexually {{reproducing}} organisms. Thus, eggtogenesis is the male version of gametogenesis, {{of which the}} female equivalent is oogenesis. In mammals it occurs in the <b>seminiferous</b> <b>tubules</b> of the male testes in a stepwise fashion. Spermatogenesis is highly dependent upon optimal conditions for the process to occur correctly, and is essential for sexual reproduction. DNA methylation and histone modification have been implicated in the regulation of this process. It starts at puberty and usually continues uninterrupted until death, although a slight decrease can be discerned in the quantity of produced sperm with increase in age (see Male infertility).|$|E
40|$|The {{spermatogenesis}} of Pseudis limellum, {{from the}} Southern Pantanal, Brazil, was studied from July 1995 to May 1996, through histological {{sections of the}} testis. The cells could be differentiated as: primary spermatogonia, large cells, generally with bilobed nucleus; secondary spermatogonia, smaller cells, with darker cytoplasm, chromatin of radial form; primary and secondary spermatocytes, differentiated according to the different stages of the nucleus during the successive cells divisions. Furthermore, we observed cells in process of morphologic differentiation: rounded spermatids much smaller, with nucleus containing chromatin in compacting process and cytoplasm reduction; elongated spermatids, generally parallel organized in well defined bundles, with the anterior region directed toward {{the periphery of the}} <b>seminiferous</b> <b>tubule</b> and the tail directed toward the lumen. Spermatozoa are free in the lumen of the <b>seminiferous</b> <b>tubule.</b> All the cells are organized as cysts, which are supported by a large amount of Sertoli cells. The spermatogenesis in P limellum is very similar to that of other anurans, but peculiarities were observed regarding the organization of the germ cells, the great amount of free Sertoli cells in the lumen of testis collected in May, and the long cytoplasmatic extensions of the cells bearing pigments and involving the <b>seminiferous</b> <b>tubule.</b> The diameter of the <b>seminiferous</b> <b>tubule</b> (SD) exhibited an annual mean of 251. 79 +/- 37. 57 mu m.

25|$|Gap Junctions {{have been}} {{observed}} in various animal organs and tissues where cells contact each other.

Since the 1970s gap junctions have continued {{to be found in}} nearly all animal cells that touch each other. By the 1990s new technology such as confocal microscopy allowed more rapid survey of large areas of tissue. Since the 1970s even tissues that were traditionally considered to possibly have isolated cells such as bone showed that the cells were still connected with gap junctions, however tenuously. Gap junctions appear to be in all animal organs and tissues and {{it will be interesting to}} find exceptions to this other than cells not normally in contact with neighboring cells. Adult skeletal muscle is a possible exception. It may be argued that if present in skeletal muscle, gap junctions might propagate contractions in an arbitrary way among cells making up the muscle. At least in some cases this may not be the case as shown in other muscle types that do have gap junctions. An indication of what results from reduction or absence of gap junctions may be indicated by analysis of cancers or the aging process.|$|E

40|$|History and Objectives: vasectomy {{is one of}} the {{prevalent}} method approved by the Ministry of Health and Medical Education for prevention of male reproductive competency. Due to discrepancies in the reported cases of the effect of vasectomy on the testicular tissue of human and animal models, {{in order to determine the}} long term affected of vasectomy on the general appearance and histology of testicular tissue, the present study was carried out in Tarbiat Modares university in 1995. Materials and Methods: An experimental study on 14 Wistar rats was performed. They were randomly divided equally into 2 vasectomy and shame operated groups: A bilateral surgery was performed on all rats. Changes in the testicular tissue were assessed by taking histologic samples (With hematoxillin-eosin, PAS and trichrome mission staining) 6 months after the surgery. Weight and volume of testis, <b>seminiferous</b> <b>tubule</b> diameter, epithelium thickness of <b>seminiferous</b> <b>tubule,</b> testicular volume percentage and number of epithelial germinal sertoli cell of <b>seminiferous</b> <b>tubule</b> were recorded.

Results: vasectomy induces changes in increased folding of membrane of <b>seminiferous</b> <b>tubule,</b> vacuolization of epithelium <b>seminiferous</b> <b>tubule</b> and desquamation of immature germ cells, in vasectomized group. Comparison of the changes of variables under investigation in 2 groups indicates that there is a significant difference between the 2 groups. Testicular weight (1. 2 ± 0. 2 in vasectomized group compared to 1. 5 ± 0. 2 g in control group), testicular volume (1. 1 ± 0. 2 cm³ compared to 1. 4 ± 0. 2 cm³) (P< 0. 0005), seminiferous tubular thickness 225 ± 53 micron compared to 78 ± 15. 1 micron) (P< 0. 0001) showed significant reduction. In addition, testicular volume percentage and number of germ cells in 2 groups showed significant difference (P< 0. 0001). However, number of sertoli cells did not changed significantly.
