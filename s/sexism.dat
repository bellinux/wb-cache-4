5|$|One {{year after}} the events of , Agent Peggy Carter is {{now a member of}} the Strategic Scientific Reserve (SSR). She faces <b>sexism</b> from her boss, Agent John Flynn, who treats her condescendingly and keeps her {{compiling}} data and code breaking while assigning field cases to the male agents. The SSR's main concern is the mysterious Zodiac, which they have been unable to recover for some time.|$|E
5|$|Sacha Baron Cohen as Borat Sagdiyev, {{a fictional}} Kazakh journalist, {{distinguished}} by exaggeratedly strong antisemitism, <b>sexism,</b> and antiziganism, which {{is depicted as}} apparently the norm in his homeland. Borat was originally created as a character for Da Ali G Show and appeared in every episode of the show, along with a cameo in the film spin-off.|$|E
5|$|Since {{appearing}} on Jeopardy!, Chu has used his fame {{to speak out}} publicly on {{issues that are important}} to him. He has become a columnist and Internet commentator, and currently writes for The Daily Beast and Salon on various issues, including racism and <b>sexism</b> in nerd culture.|$|E
5|$|A 1998 MIT study {{concluded}} that a systemic bias against female faculty existed in its School of Science, although the study's methods were controversial. Since the study, though, women have headed departments within the Schools of Science and of Engineering, and MIT has appointed several female vice presidents, although allegations of <b>sexism</b> continue to be made. Susan Hockfield, a molecular neurobiologist, was MIT's president from 2004 to 2012 {{and was the first}} woman to hold the post.|$|E
5|$|Agent Carter is a 2013 American direct-to-video {{short film}} {{featuring}} the Marvel Comics character Peggy Carter, produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment. It is a follow {{up to the}} 2011 feature film , and is the fourth Marvel One-Shot short film. The film is directed by Louis D'Esposito from a screenplay by Eric Pearson, and stars Hayley Atwell as Carter, along with Bradley Whitford and Dominic Cooper. In Agent Carter, Peggy Carter sets out on a solo mission to acquire the mysterious Zodiac while facing <b>sexism</b> post-World War II at the SSR, a precursor to S.H.I.E.L.D.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, Gillibrand {{published}} {{her first}} book, Off the Sidelines: Raise Your Voice, Change the World. The candid memoir was notable {{in the media}} upon release due to whisperings of a future presidential run as well as revealing a culture of <b>sexism</b> in the Senate, including specific comments made to her by other members of Congress about her weight and appearance. Off the Sidelines debuted at number 8 on the New York Times Best Seller list for hardcover nonfiction.|$|E
5|$|Just {{like most}} punk songs, Girlschoolâ€™s lyrics usually have short and direct texts, often {{reflecting}} the wild rock 'n' roll lifestyle and treating sex and romance {{as seen from}} a feminine point of view, {{with the use of}} reverse <b>sexism</b> and tongue-in-cheek sense of humour. Some of their songs deal also with more serious matters, such as exploitation and abuse of women, murder, addiction, the destruction of the environment, social and political issues.|$|E
5|$|The James Bond {{character}} and related media have triggered {{a number of}} criticisms and reactions across the political spectrum, and are still highly debated in popular culture studies. Some observers accuse Bond novels and films of misogyny and <b>sexism.</b> Geographers have considered the role of exotic locations in the movies in {{the dynamics of the}} Cold War, with power struggles among blocs playing out in the peripheral areas. Other critics claim that 21st century Bond movies reflect imperial nostalgia. American conservative critics, particularly in the 1960s and 1970s, saw Bond as a nihilistic, hedonistic, and amoral character that challenged family values.|$|E
5|$|The media {{tended to}} {{overlook}} the meaning behind Pussy Riot's feminism; the cultural context of it is vastly {{different from that of}} Western feminism. According to Elianna Kan in the American Reader, Pussy Riot's feminism focused on the repression of authoritarian regimes that created idealised ideas of <b>sexism,</b> sex and family life. Pussy Riot strove {{to make it clear that}} feminism in Russia was still an issue and that post-feminism had not been achieved.|$|E
5|$|While {{attending}} Antioch College in {{the early}} 1960s, Gould {{was active in the}} civil rights movement and often campaigned for social justice. When he attended the University of Leeds as a visiting undergraduate, he organized weekly demonstrations outside a Bradford dance hall which refused to admit black people. Gould continued these demonstrations until the policy was revoked. Throughout his career and writings, he spoke out against cultural oppression in all its forms, especially what he saw as the pseudoscience used in the service of racism and <b>sexism.</b>|$|E
5|$|Whitney Frost (portrayed by Wynn Everett) is {{the stage}} name of Agnes Cully, an actress and {{scientific}} genius forced {{to hide behind}} her husband, senatorial candidate Calvin Chadwick, due to the <b>sexism</b> of the age. She accidentally absorbs Zero Matter, which leaves her with a Zero Matter scar on her forehead, {{and the ability to}} absorb any living thing she touches. After she is purged of the Zero Matter, Frost goes insane and is committed to an asylum.|$|E
5|$|Even so, {{there is}} no {{shortage}} of criticism against Beyonce's particular brand of feminism. Many critics argue that Beyonce is part of the hyper sexualization of women in the pop industry since the 90's, something that occurred largely in sync with the explosion of the porn industry. Beyond this, some feminist critics argue that Beyonce fuels a culture of post-feminism. With songs like Girls (Who Run the World), Beyonce creates a mindset - particularly among teenage girls - that women are already outdoing men in every aspect of life. When the reality is, these critics say, there are still vast gender inequalities that keep them from doing so. The danger of post-feminism is that while they still exist, young people lack the language to label these inequalities as <b>sexism.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 2008 Clinton, a Senator and {{candidate}} for the Democratic Party presidential nomination, became the first American woman to win a presidential primary. Traister discusses Clinton's political campaign, which did not focus on her gender, and the misogynistic reactions she received from the media and political opponents. She argues that the Democratic Party's lack of response to the <b>sexism</b> of Clinton's opponents led {{a large number of}} liberal female voters to abandon the party, and blames Mark Penn for advising Clinton not to advertise herself as a feminist. Although she originally supported John Edwards' candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination, she became a strong supporter of Clinton.|$|E
5|$|Poehler and Fey are {{featured}} in a fictional speech playing New York Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton and Alaskan Governor Sarah Palin, respectively. The pair discuss the presence of <b>sexism</b> in the 2008 United States presidential election, and the differences between Palin and Clinton. Governor Palin was the Republican Party vice-presidential nominee and Senator Clinton was a contender for the Democratic Party presidential nomination. Through {{the course of the}} message, Palin tries to present herself as the candidate for the job, and Clinton gets progressively more and more disgusted at Palin's sudden rise to fame as John McCain's running mate, despite her background. It also features references to Clinton's campaign.|$|E
5|$|Produced by Garth Richardson, Spit is a nu metal {{album with}} {{elements}} of heavy metal, speed metal, techno, alternative rock, rap, groove metal, alternative metal and death metal. Spit, whose lyrical themes include <b>sexism,</b> hatred, ignorance, betrayal, bullying and life experiences, received mixed or positive reviews. Some critics praised the album's aggression but some critics criticized the album's song titles, lyrics and attitude. After releasing Spit, Kittie went on tours with bands such as Chevelle, Slipknot, Suicidal Tendencies, and Shuvel. Kittie also performed at Ozzfest and the 2001 SnoCore festival. Kittie planned to tour with Pantera, but the tour fell through when Pantera vocalist Phil Anselmo fell and broke two ribs.|$|E
5|$|Rubin {{studied for}} her Ph.D. at Georgetown University, the only {{university}} in Washington, DC that offered {{a graduate degree}} in astronomy. She was 23 years old and pregnant when she began her doctoral studies, and the Rubins had one young child at home. She began to take classes with Francis Heyden, who recommended her to George Gamow, her eventual doctoral advisor. Her dissertation, completed in 1954, concluded that galaxies clumped together, rather than being randomly distributed through the universe, a controversial idea not pursued by others for two decades. Throughout her graduate studies, she experienced discouraging <b>sexism,</b> including an incident where she {{was not allowed to}} meet with her advisor in his office, because women were not allowed in that area of the university.|$|E
5|$|Sexual Politics {{originated}} as Millett's PhD dissertation and {{was published}} in 1970, {{the same year that}} she was awarded her doctorate from Columbia University. The bestselling book, a critique of patriarchy in Western society and literature, addressed the <b>sexism</b> and heterosexism of the modern novelists D. H. Lawrence, Henry Miller, and Norman Mailer and contrasted their perspectives with the dissenting viewpoint of the homosexual author Jean Genet. Millett questioned the origins of patriarchy, argued that sex-based oppression was both political and cultural, and posited that undoing the traditional family was the key to true sexual revolution. In its first year on the market, the book sold 80,000 copies and went through seven printings and is considered to be the movement's manifesto.|$|E
5|$|Stanton {{wished for}} {{a greater degree of}} {{scholarship}} in The Woman's Bible, but was unable to convince Bible scholars of her day to take part in what was expected to be a controversial project. Scholars continued to avoid addressing the subject of <b>sexism</b> in the Bible until 1964 when Margaret Brackenbury Crook published Women and Religion, a study of the status of women in Judaism and Christianity. In her 1973 book Beyond God the Father, Mary Daly discussed The Woman's Bible, and subsequent works by Letty Russell and Phyllis Trible furthered the connection between feminism and the Bible. Today, biblical scholarship by women has come into maturity, with women posing new questions about the Bible, and challenging the very basis of biblical studies.|$|E
5|$|The Homosexual Matrix was {{controversial}} and received many negative reviews. It {{was criticized for}} Tripp's alleged bias in favor of homosexuality, dismissive treatment of psychoanalytic theories, rambling style, <b>sexism,</b> focus on male homosexuality and neglect of lesbianism, and failure to discuss the gay liberation movement. The book drew a negative reaction from psychoanalysts, including an ethics complaint against Tripp with the American Psychological Association. Tripp himself believed that it had received a negative reaction from the gay media and from some gay people. Nevertheless, it was influential and has received praise as an important work on homosexuality. Commentators have supported Tripp's view that erotic feeling depends on resistance to its satisfaction.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} {{was a popular}} comic book figure during the Silver Age of Comic Books, due to her appearances in the Batman television series and continued media exposure. She has achieved similar popularity in the Modern Age of Comic Books under the Birds of Prey publication and as a disabled icon. The character {{has been the subject}} of academic analysis concerning the roles of women, librarians and disabled people in mainstream media. The events of The Killing Joke, which led to the character's paralysis, as well as the restoration of her mobility, has also been a subject of debate among comic book writers, artists, editors and readership. Viewpoints range from <b>sexism</b> in comic books, to the limited visibility of disabled characters and the practicality of disabilities existing in a fictional universe where magic, technology, and medical science exceed the limitations of the real world.|$|E
5|$|The {{civil rights}} {{movement}} has influenced and informed the feminist movement and vice versa. Many Western feminists adapted the language and theories of black equality activism and drew parallels between women's rights {{and the rights of}} non-white people. Despite the connections between the women's and {{civil rights movement}}s, some tension arose during the late 1960s and early 1970s as non-white women argued that feminism was predominantly white and middle class, and did not understand and was not concerned with race issues. Similarly, some women argued that the civil rights movement had sexist elements and did not adequately address minority women's concerns. These criticisms created new feminist social theories about the intersections of racism, classism, and <b>sexism,</b> and new feminisms, such as black feminism and Chicana feminism.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} role in the Clan is that of the leader. The Clan leader overlooks all duties of Clan life, and will make all the important decisions, such as whether or not to engage in battle. Each Clan leader is given nine lives by StarClan, in order to sacrifice their lives nine times over to protect their Clan, and to serve their clans for many more moons to come. This means that Clan leaders can often live longer than that of a normal cat. To mark their new status, Clan leaders are given the suffix â€“star (e.g. Bluestar, Tallstar, and Brokenstar). Generally, Clan leaders sleep alone, although male leaders are allowed to take a mate. Female leaders are inhibited from taking a mate or having kits, which has led to discussions of <b>sexism</b> among many fans of the series.|$|E
5|$|The novel has {{pervasive}} lesbian themes, {{concentrating on}} eroticism and self-discovery. Waters {{was working on}} a PhD dissertation in English literature when she decided to write a story she would like to read. Employing her love for the variety of people and districts in London, she consciously chose an urban setting. As opposed to previous lesbian-themed fiction she had read where the characters escape an oppressive society to live apart from it, Waters chose characters who interact with their surroundings. She has acknowledged that the book imagines a lesbian presence and history in Victorian London where none was recorded. The main character's experiences in the theatrical profession and her perpetual motion through the city allow her to make observations on social conditions while exploring the issues of gender, <b>sexism,</b> and class difference.|$|E
5|$|During this period, Monroe {{gained a}} {{reputation}} for being difficult on film sets; the difficulties worsened as her career progressed. She was often late or did not show up at all, did not remember her lines, and would demand several re-takes before she was satisfied with her performance. Monroe's dependence on her acting coachesâ€”first Natasha Lytess and later Paula Strasbergâ€”also irritated directors. Monroe's problems have been attributed to a combination of perfectionism, low self-esteem, and stage fright; she disliked the lack of control she had on her work on film sets, and never experienced similar problems during photo shoots, in which she had more say over her performance and could be more spontaneous instead of following a script. To alleviate her anxiety and chronic insomnia, she began to use barbiturates, amphetamines and alcohol, which also exacerbated her problems, although she did not become severely addicted until 1956. According to Sarah Churchwell, some of Monroe's behavior especially later in her career was also in response to the condescension and <b>sexism</b> of her male co-stars and directors. Similarly, Lois Banner has stated that she was bullied by many of her directors.|$|E
5|$|During this time, Stanton {{maintained}} a broad focus on women's rights in general rather than narrowing her focus only to female suffrage in particular. After {{passage of the}} Fifteenth Amendment in 1870 and its support by the Equal Rights Association and prominent suffragists such as Stone, Blackwell, and Howe, the gap between Elizabeth Cady Stanton and other leaders of the women's movement widened as Stanton took issue with the fundamental religious leanings of several movement leaders. Unlike many of her colleagues, Stanton believed organized Christianity relegated women to an unacceptable position in society. She explored this view in the 1890s in The Woman's Bible, which elucidated a feminist understanding of biblical scripture and sought to correct the fundamental <b>sexism</b> Stanton believed was inherent to organized Christianity. Likewise, Stanton supported divorce rights, employment rights, and property rights for women, issues in which the American Women's Suffrage Association (AWSA) preferred not to become involved.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, Feynman began {{thinking}} of writing an autobiography, {{and he began}} granting interviews to historians. In the 1980s, working with Ralph Leighton (Robert Leighton's son), he recorded chapters on audio tape that Robert transcribed. The book was published in 1985 as Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman! and became a best-seller. The publication of the book brought {{a new wave of}} protest about Feynman's attitude toward women. There had been protests over his alleged <b>sexism</b> in 1968, and again in 1972. It did not help that Jenijoy La Belle, who had been hired as Caltech's first female professor in 1969, was refused tenure in 1974. She filed suit with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which ruled against Caltech in 1977, adding that she had been paid less than male colleagues. La Belle finally received tenure in 1979. Many of Feynman's colleagues were surprised that he took her side. He had gotten to know her, and both liked and admired her.|$|E
25|$|Occupational <b>sexism</b> (also called <b>sexism</b> in {{the work}} place and {{employment}} <b>sexism)</b> refers to any discriminatory practices, statements, actions, etc. based on a person's sex that are present or occur in a place of employment.|$|E
25|$|The website {{was such}} a success that Bates decided to write and publish a book, Everyday <b>Sexism,</b> which further {{emphasizes}} the importance of having this type of online forum for women. The book provides unique insight into the vibrant movement of the upcoming fourth wave and the untold stories that women shared through the Everyday <b>Sexism</b> Project.|$|E
