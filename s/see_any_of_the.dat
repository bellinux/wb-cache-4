They were sent to an RTD bus depot at 54th and Arlington and told to await further instructions. The command post formed at this location was activated at approximately 6:00 pm, but once set up had no cellular phones or computers other than those in squad cars. It had insufficient numbers of telephone lines and handheld police radios to assess {{and respond to the}} situation. Finally, the site had no televisions, which meant that as live broadcasts of unrest began, command post officers did not <b>see</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coverage for themselves.|$|E
500|$|The {{requirements}} {{for a new}} class of dreadnoughts were in a state of flux during 1907, but Vickers Ltd submitted a design that met the latest specifications and was very nearly accepted by the Navy for a [...] ship with twelve [...] guns in triple, superimposed turrets. However rumors of a contract with Vickers raised a public outcry as they had some problems with the armored cruiser [...] then building in England. The Naval Ministry defused the situation on 30 December 1907 by announcing an international design contest with the ship built in Russia regardless of the nationality of the winning firm. By the deadline of 12 March 1908 a total of 51 designs had been submitted by 13 different shipyards. The winner of the competition was a design from the German firm of Blohm & Voss, but the French protested that {{they did not want to}} <b>see</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> money that they had loaned Russia to build up its defenses in German pockets. The Russians bought the design for 250,000 rubles and shelved it to placate both sides. A design by the Baltic Works had been the runner-up and was revised for the Navy's updated requirements with a complete design to be presented by 22 March 1909. This was extended by a month to allow the Baltic Works to finalize its contract with the British firm of John Brown & Company for design assistance with the hull form and machinery.|$|E

With the deal, Whedon would [...] "contribute creatively" [...] on Phase Two of the MCU {{and develop the}} first television series set in the universe. In March 2013, Whedon expanded on his consulting responsibilities, saying, [...] "I understand what Kevin [...] is going for and where he's heading, and I read the scripts and watch cuts {{and talk to the}} directors and writers and give my opinion. Occasionally there could be some writing. But I'm not trying to get in anybody's soup, I'm just trying to be helpful." [...] Whedon later elaborated that [...] "Since the story has already been approved and everybody knows what we're doing with Avengers 2, we can really lay it out. It's not like anyone's saying [...] "well I don't know, what if I need that?" [...] It's like [...] "doing this is troublesome for us, whereas doing this will actually help us." ... You want to honor {{the events of the last}} movie but you don't want to be beholden to them, because some people will see Avengers who did not <b>see</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> movies in between or even Avengers 1." [...] He also found working in television and script doctoring to be [...] "great training ground for dealing with this ... because you're given a bunch of pieces and told to make them fit—even if they don't." ...|$|E

2500|$|Merezhkovsky {{insisted upon}} {{severing}} all the International PEN's contacts with Communist Russia and cancelling French {{help for the}} victims of mass hunger in Russian Volga Region arguing, not unreasonably, that those in need won't ever <b>see</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> money or food sent. He criticised the exiled Russian Constituent Assembly's communique which was, in his opinion, too conciliatory in tone. In 1922 the collection of articles and essays of the four authors (Merezhkovsky, Gippius, Filosofov contacts with whom have been restored, and Zlobin) came out under the title The Kingdom of Antichrist, the general idea of the book being that the 'Russian fires', globalist in their nature and intent, promise [...] "either brotherhood in slavery or the end in a common grave" [...] for the European nations.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the fall}} of 1941, Ribbentrop worked {{for the failure of}} the Japanese-American talks in Washington and for Japan to attack the United States. In October 1941 Ribbentrop ordered Eugen Ott, the German {{ambassador}} to Japan, to start applying pressure on the Japanese to attack the Americans as soon as possible. Ribbentrop argued to Hitler that a war between the United States and Germany was inevitable given the extent of American aid to Britain and the increasingly frequent [...] "incidents" [...] in the North Atlantic between U-boats and American warships guarding convoys to Britain. He said that having such a war start with a Japanese attack on the United States {{was the best way to}} begin it. Ribbentrop told Hitler that because of his four years in Canada and the United States before 1914, he was an expert on all things American; he thought that the United States was not a serious military power. On 4 December 1941, the Japanese Ambassador General Hiroshi Ōshima told Ribbentrop that Japan was on the verge of war with the United States. In turn, Ribbentrop promised that Germany would join the war against the Americans. On 7 December 1941, Ribbentrop was jubilant at the news of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and did his utmost to support a declaration of war on the United States. He delivered the declaration to the American Chargé d'Affaires Leland B. Morris on 11 December 1941. In the winter and spring of 1942, following American entry into war, the United States successfully pressured all of the Latin American states, except for Argentina and Chile, to declare war on Germany. Ribbentrop considered the acceptance of declarations of war from small states such as Costa Rica and Ecuador to be deeply humiliating, and he refused to <b>see</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Latin American ambassadors. He had Weizsäcker accept their declarations of war instead.|$|E

2500|$|On 12 August Rev. Gribble, {{accompanied}} by Inspector E. C. Mitchell of the Western Australian Aborigines Department in Wyndham, visited {{two of the}} alleged massacre sites identified by Tommy Doort, Mowerie and Gotegotemerrie. Mitchell reported that he found considerable evidence of attempts {{to clean up the}} site, which included the chipping away of stone to remove dark stains from a rock ledge, and that he had recovered a quantity of intact human teeth and skull fragments from the ashes of a large fire nearby. Mitchell sent a telegram to the Chief Protector, A.O. Neville: [...] "Shocking revelations, saw place Forrest River, rocky higher bed where natives chained small tree killed there then bodies burnt improvised oven". Two weeks later Chief Inspector Douglas visited both sites and noted finding dark stains that had human hairs attached on a rock slab behind a tree near where the fire had been. In September Douglas returned with Sulieman, a tracker who had ridden with the patrol. Following tracks from Mowerie and Gotegotemerrie to police camp 3 Sulieman pointed out the remains of a fire. He claimed that the Aboriginal trackers had been sent to destroy another police camp while St Jack and O'Leary remained with six chained prisoners, and that, on returning the next morning, they found Constable St Jack and O'Leary at a large fire. He did not <b>see</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> prisoners killed, but [...] "knew that the bodies were in the fire". Arriving at camp 3 Sulieman stated that Regan, O'Leary and Murnane led nine prisoners in chains into a ravine, returning the next morning alone. Douglas followed tracks from camp 3 into the ravine where he [...] "found the remains of a large fire and some thousands of fragments of bone in the ashes". Douglas' report to the police commissioner stated: [...] "sixteen natives were burned in three lots; one, six and nine; only fragments (of) bone not larger than one inch remain".|$|E
2500|$|Many have {{questioned}} the legality of Elgin's actions, including {{the legitimacy of the}} documentation purportedly authorising them. A study by Professor David Rudenstine of the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law concluded that the premise that Elgin obtained legal title to the marbles, which he then transferred to the British government, [...] "is certainly not established and may well be false". Rudenstine's argumentation is partly based on a translation discrepancy he noticed between the surviving Italian document and the English text submitted by Hunt to the parliamentary committee. The text from the committee report reads [...] "We therefore have written this Letter to you, and expedited it by Mr. Philip Hunt, an English Gentleman, Secretary of the aforesaid Ambassador" [...] but according to the St. Clair Italian document the actual wording is [...] "We therefore have written this letter to you and expedited it by N.N.". In Rudenstine's view, this substitution of [...] "Mr. Philip Hunt" [...] with the initials [...] "N.N." [...] can hardly be a simple mistake. He further argues that the document was presented after the committee's insistence that some form of Ottoman written authorisation for the removal of the marbles be provided, a fact known to Hunt by the time he testified. Thus, according to Rudenstine, [...] "Hunt put himself in a position in which he could simultaneously vouch for the authenticity of the document and explain why he alone had a copy of it fifteen years after he surrendered the original to Ottoman officials in Athens". On two earlier occasions, Elgin stated that the Ottomans gave him written permissions more than once, but that he had [...] "retained none of them." [...] Hunt testified on March 13, and one of the questions asked was [...] "Did you ever <b>see</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> written permissions which were granted to [...] for removing the Marbles from the Temple of Minerva?" [...] to which Hunt answered [...] "yes", adding that he possessed an Italian translation of the original firman. Nonetheless, he did not explain why he had retained the translation for 15 years, whereas Elgin, who had testified two weeks earlier, knew nothing about the existence of any such document.|$|E
