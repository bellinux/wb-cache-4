40|$|Part of Choreodrome, Digital Lab – Post-Digital Playground, The Place, London 11 - 13. 9. 15 A two-day {{exploration}} {{into the world}} of electronic circuits, sound-making and choreography. Capacity looks at the very essence of electronic circuits: the humble capacitor and the flow of electric current. The capacitor (condenser) is seen as a metaphor for momentarily holding on to an energy that is transient and fleeting. A choreography is also suggested that studies the dichotomy of charging and discharging and how energy can be created, held and dissipated. Attendees are invited to build an electronic <b>sound</b> <b>circuit</b> that becomes the starting point for choreography. A fluid interchangeable workspace will be created: dance studio will become laboratory and vice versa. There is no distinction made between builder, sound-maker or choreographer, but a philosophy is adopted where building and investigating the electronic circuit and sound object becomes part of the performance practice. The building process brings the performer closer to the object and serves as an analysis of circuit ‘behaviour’. From this analysis and investigation, a choreography is formed that encourages the performer to look beyond the ‘self’ toward an object-orientated ontology...|$|E

Most forms of audio signal distortion (usually for electric guitar) primarily add odd harmonics to a signal, as this is easily accomplished by clipping the waveform. This project instead utilizes a signal multiplier in a feedback loop, with one multiplier input coming from the circuit’s input, and the other from the multiplier’s own output.

40|$|Chemical synapses are the {{fundamental}} units that mediate communication between neurons in the mammalian brain. In {{contrast to the}} enormous progress made in mapping out postsynaptic contributions of receptors, scaffolding structures and receptor trafficking to synaptic transmission and plasticity, {{the small size of}} nerve terminals has largely precluded direct analyses of presynaptic modulation of excitability and transmitter release in central synapses.

This review will highlight experimental evidence that resolves several long-standing issues with respect to intricate interplays between the waveform of action potentials, Ca 2 + currents and transmitter release and further conceptualize their relationships in a physiological context with theoretical models of the spatial organization of voltage-gated Ca 2 + channels and synaptic vesicles at release sites...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a system for}} the automatic creation of digital synthesizer circuits that can generate sounds similar to a sampled (target) <b>sound.</b> The <b>circuits</b> will consist of very basic signal functions and generators that are arbitrarily interconnected.

They are used for "breeding" {{to form a new}} generation where, hopefully, at least some individuals perform better than their parents did. The end result will be a circuit that can create a sound that resembles the target sample. Because it's a synthesizer we can manipulate the different parameters when generating the sound.
