50|$|Together with Harry Dexter White, Assistant Secretary of the Treasury, and V. Frank Coe, Director of the Treasury's Division of Monetary Research, Adler {{strongly}} opposed a gold loan program of $200 {{million to help}} the Nationalist Chinese Government control the inflation that took hold in unoccupied China during World War II. Inflation in China between 1943 and 1945 was more than 1,000% per year, weakening the Nationalist government in China. This inflation helped the Communists eventually come to power in China, and in later years White, Coe, and Adler were accused of having deliberately fostered the Chinese inflation by obstructing the <b>stabilization</b> <b>loan.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{economic}} recession of 2008 along with rapid {{devaluation of the}} domestic currency and plunge in customers’ purchasing ability in the retailer`s basic territory placed Amstor {{on the edge of}} bankruptcy. To save the business, business partners Shifrin and Vagorovskiy turned to Vadym Novynskyi for support. They offered him 70% of Amstor’s stock in exchange for infusion of working capital and aid in restructuring of the company’s excessive credit portfolio. The beginning of the cooperation was the $3 million <b>stabilization</b> <b>loan</b> provided (or given) by Novynskyi`s company Smart-Holding. In consequence of the cooperation deal, Shifrin and Vagorovskiy retained 15% of the company’s stock each.|$|E

Government authorized Vnesheconombank as its principal agent in distributing state loans to these corporations, amounting initially up to 50 billion US dollars, or 8% of Russia's foreign currency assets. At {{the same time}} Putin recommended the Central Bank to extend unsecured <b>stabilization</b> <b>loans</b> to Russian banks, which was duly implemented. The policy was immediately dubbed [...] "soft re-nationalisation" [...] and criticized for selective picking of [...] "eligible" [...] borrowers. The 50 billion installment covers only the current portion of 477 billion US dollars owed by Russian corporations to foreign lenders; total assets {{of the government and}} the Central Bank combined are estimated at 550 billion US dollars.|$|R
40|$|We {{highlight}} {{the elements of}} the operation of the U. S. Exchange Stabilization Fund that Harry Dexter White, who directed the Treasury's division of monetary research, transferred to his plan for the operation of the International Monetary Fund. The elements included the principle that all currencies were equivalent and the goal of the international fund, like that of the U. S. fund, was to stabilize exchange rates. The ESF also influenced White's vision for the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. The IBRD, however, represented a reaction by White against key elements of ESF <b>stabilization</b> <b>loans,</b> which were very short term, paid above market interest rates, and required collateral. Had White carried forward to the IMF the ESF elements pertaining to interest rates and collateral, its operations would have evolved in a markedly different direction from the one that it has taken. ...|$|R

The adequate estimate of the value of real estate properties and competent analysis of all aspects related thereto are used as decision support regarding the use and disposal of the real estate properties. In determining the market value of a real estate property, you can choose one of three methods available in the practice of the valuation, market approach, income approach or cost approach. In this context, using the cost approach, we determine the market value of a real estate property, given that realistic, accurate estimate contribute to the establishment and <b>stabilization</b> of <b>loans</b> and investments that promote the development of the real estate property in the sense required by society. valuation, cost approach, the market valu...|$|R

40|$|Charles Zheng (2009) {{purports to}} model the U. S. toxic asset auction plan. In the model, “moderately poor bidders outbid rich bidders in such auctions,” because poor bidders have less to lose by {{defaulting}} on taxpayer loans. Thus, says Zheng: “After defeating their rich rivals and acquiring the toxic assets, such bidders will default on government-provided loans whenever the toxic assets {{turn out to be}} unsalvageable. ” The chief trouble with the paper is that the assumptions do not fit reality. In reality, the government-provided loans used to buy toxic assets are nonrecourse, allowing the borrower {{to walk away from the}} loan with no penalties besides ceding the asset that the loan purchased. Thus, there is nothing to make rich bidders less ready to win the auction. Zheng’s conclusions that less well endowed borrowers will win toxic asset auctions are erroneous. Further Zheng’s use of auctions {{to model the}}se plans is largely inappropriate since only one of the three government toxic asset plans has government backed investors bid for the same toxic asset in an auction format. auctions,bailout,banking,CMBS,CDOs,EESA,Emergency Economic <b>Stabilization</b> Act,lending,Legacy <b>Loans</b> Program,Legacy Securities Program,mortgages,nonrecourse loans,Public-Private Investment Partnership,PPIP,TALF,Term Asset Lending Facility,Troubled Asset...|$|R

The main incentive for repaying sovereign debt {{is to maintain}} access to international capital markets. However, in a democracy, one generation may choose default regardless of its consequences for future generations. An old generation with little concern for its country''s access to capital markets can force a default on debt if it has the majority of voters. On the other hand, if the younger generation is more numerous, it can force repayment of previously defaulted debt. Other voter heterogeneities, such as in income, can generate similar results.

40|$|The paper {{analyses}} {{the cost}} and effectiveness of bank restructuring policies in 11 transition countries during 1991 - 98. It argues that country-specific banking sector features, the size of bad loans inherited from the centrally planned system, and weaknesses in the restructuring policies implemented were the main factors affecting the overall fiscal costs, with the latter two being more significant. The paper finds no significant relationship between the size of restructuring costs and overall improvement in banking sector performance for the sample countries as a whole.
