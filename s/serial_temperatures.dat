40|$|Background and Purpose: Previous {{research}} {{has attempted to}} analyze the relationship between post-stroke hyperthermia and prognosis. These analyses have been hindered {{by a lack of}} information about the time course and determinants of temperature change after stroke. Methods: <b>Serial</b> <b>temperatures</b> were measured until 48 h after ischaemic stroke in a prospectively recruited cohort. Potential determinants of temperature, including stroke severity [measured using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) ], infection and paracetamol use were recorded. Mixed-effects models were used to model serial temperature measurements over time, adjusted for significant determinants. Results: In 155 patients the mean temperature rose from 36. 5 degrees C at the time of stroke to 36. 7 degrees C approximately 36 h later. The factors with significant multivariable associations with <b>serial</b> <b>temperatures</b> were: first- and second-order time components, infection, paracetamol administration and the interaction between stroke severity (NIHSS >= 6) and time (all p = 6 had a mean temperature rise of 0. 35 degrees C during the first 36 h after stroke, compared with a rise of 0. 17 degrees C in those with NIHS...|$|E

40|$|Non-freezing cold injury (NFCI), {{so called}} trench foot, is a {{condition}} characterised by a peripheral neuropathy, developing when the extremities are exposed for prolonged periods to wet conditions at temperatures just above freezing. Classically, military personnel are affected, with 14 % of casualties in the Falklands conflict afflicted. Clinically, NFCI is characterised by a well-defined acute clinical picture and chronic sequelae. Little is known regarding the pathophysiology and treatment of this condition. Opinions vary as {{to the type of}} nerve fibres most susceptible to damage and proposed mechanisms of injury include direct axonal damage, ischaemia and ischaemia/reperfusion. A series of investigations has been performed to clarify which populations of nerve fibres are more susceptible to damage, and to elucidate the exact mechanism of nerve injury. An in vivo rabbit hind limb model, subjected to 16 h of cold immersion (1 - 2 degrees C), provided the basis of this study. Nerve specimens were examined by semi-thin sectioning for myelin fibre counts, by electron microscopy to assess the unmyelinated fibre population, and fine nerve terminals in plantar skin were assessed immunohistochemically. The results showed that large myelinated fibres were preferentially damaged, while small myelinated and unmyelinated fibres were relatively spared. Nerve damage was found to start proximally and extend distally with time. <b>Serial</b> <b>temperature</b> measurements identified a warm-cold interface in the upper tibial region of immersed limbs. As this was the initial site of injury, this suggested that a dynamic balance exists in the cold immersed limb between the protective effects of cooling and the damaging effects of ischaemia.

40|$|Abstract Background Most cast {{materials}} {{mature and}} harden via an exothermic reaction. Although rare, thermal injuries secondary to casting can occur. The {{purpose of this}} study was to evaluate factors that contribute to the elevated temperature beneath a cast and, more specifically, evaluate the differences of modern casting materials including fiberglass and prefabricated splints. Methods The temperature beneath various types (plaster, fiberglass, and fiberglass splints), brands, and thickness of cast material were measured after they were applied over thermometer which was on the surface of a single diameter and thickness PVC tube. A single layer of cotton stockinette with variable layers and types of cast padding were placed prior to application of the cast. <b>Serial</b> <b>temperature</b> measurements were made as the cast matured and reached peak temperature. Time to peak, duration of peak, and peak temperature were noted. Additional tests included varying the dip water temperature and assessing external insulating factors. Ambient temperature, ambient humidity and dip water freshness were controlled. Results Outcomes revealed that material type, cast thickness, and dip water temperature played key roles regarding the temperature beneath the cast. Faster setting plasters achieved peak temperature quicker and at a higher level than slower setting plasters. Thicker fiberglass and plaster casts led to greater peak temperature levels. Likewise increasing dip-water temperature led to elevated temperatures. The thickness and type of cast padding had less of an effect for all materials. With a definition of thermal injury risk of skin injury being greater than 49 degrees Celsius, we found that thick casts of extra fast setting plaster consistently approached dangerous levels (greater than 49 degrees for an extended period). Indeed a cast of extra-fast setting plaster, 20 layers thick, placed on a pillow during maturation maintained temperatures over 50 degrees of Celsius for over 20 minutes. Conclusion Clinicians should be cautious when applying thick casts with warm dip water. Fast setting plasters have increased risk of thermal injury while brand does not appear to play a significant role. Prefabricated fiberglass splints appear to be safer than circumferential casts. The greatest risk of thermal injury occurs when thick casts are allowed to mature while resting on pillow. </p...|$|R

With switchable transformers, it is also significant to carry out temperature monitoring to protect the switching devices.

The behavior of the I 27 domain of titin and its serial repeats is contrasted to that of simple secondary structures. In all cases thermal fluctuations accelerate the unraveling process, decreasing the unfolding force nearly linearly at low temperatures.

Due to its special native state geometry titin is much more thermally and elastically stable than the secondary structures.

Charles Wyville Thompson and Sir John Murray launched the Challenger expedition. The Challenger, leased from the Royal Navy, was modified for scientific work and equipped with separate laboratories for natural history and chemistry. Under the scientific supervision of Thomson, Challenger travelled nearly 70000 nmi km surveying and exploring. On her journey circumnavigating the globe, 492 deep sea soundings, 133 bottom dredges, 151 open water trawls and 263 <b>serial</b> water <b>temperature</b> observations were taken.

He went on to found the academic discipline of oceanography at the University of Edinburgh, which remained the centre for oceanographic research well into the 20th century. Murray was the first to study marine trenches and in particular the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, and map the sedimentary deposits in the oceans.

Metal ion complexation was performed to try and control the self-assembly but to no avail. Fluorescence studies were performed on several compounds to further examine the metal-ligand interactions. It was found that with the addition of the metal ions intensity had an overall increase in intensity and the fluorescence bands were blue-shifted with respect to the parent compound fluorescence bands. Unfortunately suitable crystals were not obtained for X-ray analysis. SEM was performed on several of the compounds and their corresponding metal complexes and the images obtained give some insight into the morphology of the structures...|$|R
