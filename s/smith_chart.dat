For every receiver, the range of frequencies yields a series of con-cyclic points. The phenomenon was called [...] "motional impedance" [...] and the circle a [...] "motional impedance circle".

50|$|The inverse {{connection}} (impedance step-up) {{is simply}} the reverse—for example, reactance in series with the source. The magnitude of the impedance ratio is limited by reactance losses such as the Q of the inductor. Multiple L-sections can be wired in cascade to achieve higher impedance ratios or greater bandwidth.

The <b>Smith</b> <b>chart</b> scaling is designed in such a way that reflection coefficient can be converted to normalised impedance or vice versa.
