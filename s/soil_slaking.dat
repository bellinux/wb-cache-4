Diffusion, shown to be the main process by which salts move from the poorly permeable mass of the soil to the network of macropores in which drainage occurs, is a relatively slow process. But is not as much a limiting factor on the leaching of salts from clays as poor internal drainage. Laboratory and field investigations have shown that salts can be rapidly leached from clay soils if the soils are restructured into smaller units so that the salt is more accessible and the soil more permeable. However the improved soil structure is adversely affected by soil overburden weight and by the <b>soil</b> <b>slaking</b> which occurs when the soil is first wetted. Accordingly, the maximum depth for such restructuring is between 500 and 800 mm, and the moisture content at the time of first wetting should also not be allowed to fall below 24 % w/w. <br/...|$|E

[...] Though there is a report of a nesting Broad-tailed hummingbird that sustained itself for several days only upon arthropods, this suggests that insects may have a larger part in hummingbird diet in some instances than previously thought.

Internal forces originating from matric suction can change soil physical properties. A laboratory study was conducted on pots of a surface silty clay loam soil of Khomeinishahr series (fine-loamy, mixed, thermic Typic Haplargids, USDA), located in Research Farm of Isfahan University of Technology. Soil surface subsidence, bulk density, cone index, and tensile strength were measured after first flood irrigation. Results showed that the seedbed (0 - 20 cm) with a bulk density of 1. 2 Mg. m- 3 will be changed to a massive soil with high values of bulk density, cone index, and tensile strength after soil wetting. Slaking, slumping and coalescence of the soil caused soil surface to subside about 1. 5 cm in 20 cm soil layer. After irrigation, cone index and tensile strength increased abruptly with decreasing of moisture content. It is shown that the dominant source of strength (cone index and tensile strength) gain during drying is the effective stress due to matric suction. In the absence of external loads, physical state (tilth) of the soil returned {{back to the original}} state.

40|$|Soil {{fertility}} was {{studied in}} the Great Konya Basin, {{as part of the}} study carried out by the Department of Tropical Soil Science of the Agricultural University at Wageningen. The purpose was to find the agricultural value of the soils, to learn about the main factors governing soil fertility, and to work out regional fertilizer recommendations for winter wheat, the main crop in dry farming. The study was in the field, greenhouse and laboratory. Because of results already available from Turkish scientists, only nitrogen and phosphorus were examined. In 1966 - 7 and 1967 - 8 a total of about thirty trial fields were laid out on the most important soils suitable for crops, mainly Terrace, Bajada, and Marl soils. The trials were carried out on farmers' fields in the common wheat-fallow rotation. As rainfall is low (about 300 mm per year), the land is fallowed each alternate year to conserve moisture for the next crop. To study the significance of this fallow year, the course of soil moisture content was observed during the trial years. In the greenhouse, short-term trials (3 weeks) were used. A technique was developed, by which young wheat plants could take up nutrients simultaneously from the studied soil and from a nutrient solution (Fig. 11). If a nutrient is omitted in the solution, plants can take up that nutrient from the soil only. The availability of that nutrient in the soil is indicated by the 'sufficiency quotient', the ratio between the relative growth rates of plants on deficient and complete solutions (S Q N and S Q P for nitrogen and phosphorus, respectively). In the laboratory, several physical and chemical soil characteristics were determined; also grain and straw samples from the field trials were chemically analysed. Wheat yields of the field trials ranged from 300 to 3000 kg grain per ha. The response to fertilizers varied with precipitation and soil unit. There was a reasonable relation between crop data in May (height and growth stage) and final dry-matter production in July. The yield factors moisture, nitrogen and phosphorus were studied in more detail. The amount of water stored in soil at sowing proved to depend mainly on precipitation in the preceeding fallow period and slightly on soil unit. There Was a clear connexion between the amount of stored water and maximum dry-matter production. Because of differences in spring rainfall, the relation was not the same for 1967 as for 1968. Between transpiration and maximum dry-matter production, a linear relation was found; it was used to calculate transpiration from each field, so quantifying moisture supply. The different characteristics for nitrogen status in soil, namely organic nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen and SQ N, corresponded well with each other. Yield increase with nitrogen fertilizer, nitrogen content of grain and nitrogen withdrawal from soil depended on soil nitrogen and on moisture supply. If grain nitrogen exceeded 2. 0 - 2. 2 %, there was no yield increase with nitrogen fertilizer. Nitrogen recovery, the percentage of applied nitrogen absorbed by the crop, varied from 0 to 30 %. The results of soil phosphorus determinations by P-Olsen did not correspond with SQ P. Both parameters, as well as phosphorus content in the crop, indicated a very poor phosphorus status of all soils. The interrelations between soil, crop, and fertilizer phosphorus were complex and were governed by moisture conditions. Phosphorus withdrawal from soil was low, did not depend on soil properties and was determined almost entirely by moisture supply. Phosphorus recovery, low for all soils, was lowest on Marl soils, probably because of the fine texture and the high content of carbonate. On some fields, <b>soil</b> <b>slaking,</b> profile depth and slope were factors influencing yield. Yield increments from the factors moisture, nitrogen and phosphorus were effected mainly by increased tillering. The greater number of tillers could cause moisture shortage later in the season to become more severe, and could sometimes cause decrease of seed set and of 1000 -grain weight. Phosphorus did not much change the grain/straw relation; longer culms were associated with more grains per ear. Differences in productivity and in response to fertilizers between the soil units could be ascribed to differences in content of organic matter and in moisture supply. Since those factors have been included partly directly, partly indirectly in many units of de Meester's soil map, a fertilizer recommendation map could be drawn. For recommendations, the profit- maximizing combinations of nitrogen and phosphorus were determined by an algebraic and a graphical method. For the algebraic method, regression equations were used that had been calculated for the statistical analysis of field results. The graphical method was based on the construction of 'maps' with iso-profit lines. On these 'maps' the optimum combination of fertilizers as well as financial consequences of non-optimum rates, can easily be found. Appendix I gives details of the developed technique of greenhouse trials, discusses the course of relative growth rate and its consequences for the determination of S Q N and SQ P and shows that reference soils are needed...|$|E
40|$|The rice-wheat {{cropping}} system (RWCS) of Pakistan comprises 1. 7 mha out of 13. 5 mha of total RW area of Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP), South Asia. Its current productivity (5 Mg ha- 1) is {{far below the}} combined potential yields of both improved rice and wheat cultivars. Findings from farm surveys suggest that production model for RW belt of Pakistanâs Punjab province as âmedium input-medium outputâ because of degradation of soil and water resources. The slowdown in cereal productivity growth {{is linked to the}} soils not functioning to their full capacity and decreasing efficiency due to mismanaged cultivation. The constraints like depletion of organic matter as well as poor 3 D soil health parameters viz. physical, chemical and biological jeopardize the sustainable productivity and net farmer profits. From the surveyed soils in the surroundings of 11 major cities of the Punjab, Pakistan viz., Kala Shah Kaku, Muridke, Narang Mandi, Narowal, Pasroor, Sialkot, Wazirabad, Gujranwala, Hafizabad, Sheikhupura and Lahore, more than 90 % of the soils were severely deficient of the soil organic matter (SOM), soil organic carbon (SOC), potentially mineralizable nitrogen (PMN) and low soil microbial communities assessed on the basis of total soil DNA extraction. An extreme variation in soil pH 1 : 1 and EC 1 : 1 was observed throughout the surveyed area. The physical parameters of soil health were found to be poorer in most of the sampled soils such as soil bulk density, soil infiltration rate, aggregate stability based on <b>soil</b> <b>slaking</b> test and water holding capacity. Nevertheless, the physical and physico-chemical parameters showed strong regression with crop yield; however, the loss of SOM, SOC and PMN found to be playing the most predominant role in the most robust and parsimonious yield response of rice-wheat. The high and significant value of R 2 for soil health parameters and rice-wheat yields showed that the productivity of both of the crops is highly vulnerable to the soilsâ physical, chemical as well as biological health. Rice straw (RS), being the main crop residue from RW is mainly being burned in the field due to its least preference for animal feed, limited time for recycling before sowing of succeeding wheat crop, and less favor for residue management because of high organic C contents that could result in net N immobilization if left in field, as part of crop residue management. The on-field burning of RS has been environmentally unacceptable because of its unhealthy emissions including soot,smoke, GHGs, and loss of key plant nutrients. In such a situation, composting seems {{to be one of the}} possible high value uses of RS. The current study describes a quality rice straw compost (RSC) prepared in a short span of time by inoculating indigenous microorganisms (IMOs) collected from the local environment mainly comprising of fungi, bacteria and actinomycetes. The RSC proved to be mature to very mature in terms of its quality and its potential to incur significant improvement of physical, physico-chemical and biological parameters of soil health. The RSC was analyzed for its comparative efficacy against commercial fertilizer (CF). For this purpose, rice and wheat was cultivated on rotation basis in tetra plicate field plots of CF treatment, applied with recommended NPK respective to rice and wheat; C treatment, applied with RSC only at 12 t ha- 1; C+CF treatment, applied with both RSC and CF at half of the rate of C and CF treatments; and Ctrl treatment, control amended with neither of the of the soil amendments. The C+CF treatment provided yield of both rice and wheat at least equal to the CF treatment during the very first year of study; which indicated that application of RSC does not cause yield stagnation at the early stage of soil management practice, contrary to retaining or incorporating RS in soil. There was a gradual but continuous increase in the yield of both of the crops and during the conclusive year of this study, it was observed to be 6. 415 and 4. 545 t ha- 1, for rice and wheat respectively being almost double than yield in Ctrl. It was the maximum in C+CF treatments followed by CF while being the least in Ctrl. Overall, the maximum productivity of both of the crops was yielded by applying as low as 40 - 50 % less CF than the recommended dose of NPK, as â¥ 50 % of the applied fertilizer is lost from the soil-plant system due to several factors. The hypothesis that rice-wheat productivity being vulnerable to the physical, chemical and biological parameters of soil derived for survey part of this study was reinforced from the outcome of field trials at one of the city of the selected study zone of RWCS of Punjab, Pakistan. The proposed technology is economical as well as sustainable for small scale experiment; however, expansion of the proposed technology to the end users i. e. small and medium farmers of Punjab, Pakistan would be one of the key future perspectives of this stud...|$|E

This study was conducted to determine changes in {{hydraulic conductivity}} and macro- and micro-aggregate stability of a fine-textured submerged soil under intense cattle grazing for 15 years. Hydraulic conductivity of the cattle grazing soil ranged from very slow (0. 46 cm hr- 1) to slow (19. 56 cm hr- 1) in the top 0 - 25 cm depth, and attained near zero permeability (0. 15 cm hr- 1) before 75 cm depth. Permeability was rapid (21. 1 to 30. 06 cm hr- 1) throughout the profile in the non-cattle grazing soil. Organic residues from cattle grazing activities raised the soil total organic carbon to as high as 72 g kg- 1 in the top 0 - 25 cm depth. Wet trampling of organic residues from cattle excreta induced greater soil swelling and loss of soil strength resulting in low aggregated silt and clay (ASC) and clay flocculation index (CFI) within the 25 - 75 cm depth.

40|$|A {{model has}} been {{presented}} to illustrate {{the way in which}} the influence of exchangeable Na on the fundamental processes of dispersion and flocculation on Na-Ca systems affects the various soil physical properties in the field. Most cultivated <b>soils</b> <b>slake</b> (breakdown into microaggregates) when subjected to rapid wetting, giving rise to a surface seal and a reduction in infiltration rate. However, slaking alone may not neccessarily reduce the soil 2 Ì 7 s productivity, e. g. surface aggregates of the highly productive self-mulching black earths slake even when in the virgin state. If dispersion follows slaking, in most cases it will lead to poor physical properties which may manifest as poor drainage, surface crusting, hardsetting and poor trafficability or workability of the soil and eventually lead to reduced crop yields. It is the dispersion phase that is affected by the presence of excessive sodium on the exchange complex of the soil, and this may have a profound effect on the soilâs physical properties and behaviour. This paper reviews the possible mechanisms by which excessive sodicity may manifest in undesirable soil physical behaviour. It also attempts to relate observations made in the laboratory on pure Na-Ca-clay systems to the behaviour of the soil in the field. The effect of sodium on the dispersive behaviour of a soil is discussed in relation to its hydraulic conductivity and the processes of infiltration, redistribution and evaporation of water which in turn affects the subsoil water storage in a soil profile. The presence of sodium is also discussed in relation to changes in soil strength characteristics, the soils workability and ease of tillage and ultimately the soilâs productivity. Data are presented which show that the validity of a threshold ESP and the exclusive use of ESP as a measure of sodicity are open to question...|$|R

In this report, the behavior of clayey soil on reclamatcd land in the water area was studied in various drying stages and also on the repeated action of drying and wetting. Namely, the clayey soil (muddy soil) sampled from the sea bottom destined for reclamation was prepared by kneading and moulding with water content of about the liquid limit, and was preliminarily dried to a given pF of the soil moisture, and observations were made on their slaking properties when soaked in the 20 â distilled water. The slaking percentages after leaving the soil for 24 houres on the 5 mm sieve in the waterãwere calculated And then, the slaking percentages after receiving repeated actions of drying and wetting or the effect of salt concentration in the sample were also tested under the same experimental conditions. The experimental results are as follows : 1. The slaking percentages of clayey soil of the sea bottom differs considerably depending on whether the drying stages is below or above pF 4 of the soil moisture. When below pF 4 of the soil moisture, the drying brings decrease in the amount of <b>slaking</b> <b>soil.</b> And when drying becomes over pF 4 of the soil moisture, rewetting brings in very loose soil structure and the great amount of <b>slaking</b> <b>soil.</b> 2.

While the oven dried sample with only 0. 4 % slaking at first gets finally about 33 % slaking after receiving 6 th cycle of the repeated actions of drying and wetting. 3.

This material is usually some kind of clay soil which is considered as impermeable and erosion-resistant. Dispite that, in many occasions not only seepage, but {{the failure of the}} dam occured due to surface erosion, because these kinds of irregular soils are barely investigated, and their presence are not considered during the phase of designing. In geotechnics these soils are called dispersive clays, and their greatest hazard is that they are not distinguishable at sight or by the standard geotechnical tests from the regular erosion-resistant clays, therfore many dams are built by these kind of materials, causing extra risk when {{it comes to}} evaluating the probability of failure. The reason for this kind of behavior {{can be found in the}} structure and the distribution of the clay minerals which are building up the soil. Based on earlier experiences and papers it is possible to reduce the magnitude of erosion by mixing the <b>soil</b> with <b>slaked</b> lime. First to evince the dispersive nature of the soils we developed a testing program. Therefore we collected samlpes from the Great Hungarian Plane, and identified them by the pinhole test after Sherard.

The reason behind these unexpected findings is the change from sodium nitrate to calcium nitrate + cattle salt as the sodium nitrate fertilizer in 1984, 15 years prior to sampling. The resulting additional supply of Ca 2 + was able to remediate the formerly visible deterioration of the soil structure by Na+.

40|$|Abstract. Soil {{surface sealing}} {{is one of}} the main causes for low {{infiltration}} rate (IR) and high runoff and soil loss under raindrop impact conditions in arid and semiarid regions. Many studies have focused on the effects of soil properties on seal formation under fast wetting conditions. However, in the field, soils can be exposed to different wetting conditions, before an intense rainfall event, which can affect the role of the soil properties on seal formation. The present paper reviews the effects of different initial wetting conditions and their interactions with soil properties on seal formation, IR, runoff, and soil loss in smectitic soils. Fast wetting of <b>soil</b> causes aggregate <b>slaking,</b> which enhances seal formation, runoff, and soil loss under rainfall, mainly in soils with> 40 % clay content. An increase in clay content of the soil increases aggregate strength, but at the same time increases the slaking forces. Hence, in soils with low clay content ( 40 % clay content and high aggregate stability, slaking plays an important role in aggregate breakdown and seal formation. An increase of raindrop kinetic energy, from 8 to 15. 9 kJ/m 3, decreased the effect of the slaking forces on seal formation and runoff. It was suggested that the effects of raindrop kinetic energy and of the slaking forces on aggregate disintegration and seal formation are complementary. An increase in soil exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP), from 0. 9 to 20. 4 %, decreased the effect of slaking forces on seal formation and runoff production under rainfall with 15. 9 kJ/m 3 kinetic energy. Probably, increasing the ESP increased the soi...|$|R

The main objectives of this thesis was to test {{the possibility of using}} plant roots to modify soil structure and to use laboratory screening methods to find plant species suitable for penetrating strong soil. Two laboratory screening methods were tested. The first method used soft and hard wax layers installed in sand cores. The proportion of roots penetrating the hard relative to the soft layer was highest for lucerne, intermediate for chicory, lupin and red clover, and lowest for barley. The second method used natural soil compacted by different vertical stresses. Measurements of root length density showed that lucerne had a greater ability to establish a deep root system in compacted soil than barley and lupin. A field experiment was carried out to test the possibility to use plant roots to modify subsoil structure. The complete area of all plots except the control plots were compacted by a dump truck (weight 30 Mg) {{prior to the start of}} the experiments. The plant species studied were lupin (Lupinus luteus L.), lucerne (Medicago sativa L.), red clover (Trifolium pratense L.), tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea L.), chicory (Cichorium intybus L.) and barley (Hordeum vulgare L.). Tall fescue had the highest root length density (RLD) at 30 - 35 cm depth, but RLD of chicory and lucerne were also fairly high. Chicory had the largest effect on subsoil structure, as estimated by saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat) at 30 - 35 cm depth, closely followed by lucerne. Abundance of earthworms was related to tillage intensity and was consistently higher in plots of perennial crops. The influence of earthworms on Ksat was lower than that of plant roots. Two field experiments were carried out to study mechanical subsoiling in combination with: a) incorporation of slaked lime and b) the use of plant roots as reinforcement of the loosened <b>soil.</b> Incorporation of <b>slaked</b> lime increased stability of the modified soil structure.

40|$|Multispecies {{riparian}} buffers (MRBs) are {{a conservation}} practice that protects {{water quality and}} prevents soil erosion by improving soil quality including aggregate stability, particulate organic matter (POM), and water infiltration. USDA Conservation Reserve Program MRB contracts last 10 - 15 years; evidence shows MRB soil quality may improve within 3 - 7 years, {{but there is little}} data on how MRB soils perform after contracts typically expire. <b>Slaked</b> <b>soil</b> aggregate stability was measured in a 20 - 21 year-old MRB in central Iowa at the surface (0 - 15 cm) and used to calculate the indices mean weight diameter (MWD), geometric mean diameter (GMD), and percent water-stable macroaggregates (%WSA). The MRB contained zones of switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L. âCave-in-Rockâ), hybrid poplar (Populus spp.), and cool-season grass; results were compared with an adjacent crop field, a formerly grazed pasture, and a natural riparian forest. Bulk density, total soil carbon, and POM were also measured. A Cornell sprinkle infiltrometer was used to measure infiltration in a 10 -year old tree and cool-season grass MRB, and in the switchgrass, cool-season grass and silver maple zones of the MRB used in the soil aggregate study. MRBs were compared with trafficked and non-trafficked crop interrows in a nearby crop field. Perennial vegetation had greater MWD, GMD, %WSA, and total SOC compared to the crop field. Data collected in 1997 showed no significant differences in %WSA or MWD between switchgrass and crop field, but did between cool-season grasses and crop field. However, %WSA and MWD under switchgrass increased 45. 8 % and 120. 5 %, respectively, since 1997; under cool-season grasses %WSA and MWD increased 17. 9 % and 34. 3 %, respectively, since 1997, but decreased by 37. 0 % and 35. 2 % under row crops. Sixty-minute cumulative infiltration did not significantly differ among MRBs, but was greater than trafficked crop interrows, and was best explained by rainfall rate, bulk density, and initial saturation. Percent rooted vegetation was not a significant factor explaining infiltration in MRBs. Results suggest MRBs do continue to positively impact selected soil physical parameters. Switchgrass may take longer to improve soil quality parameters in MRBs. Soil quality improvements depend upon the edaphic factors and the amount of disturbance on site...|$|R
