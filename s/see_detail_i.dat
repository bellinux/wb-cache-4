40|$|The quantum {{evolution}} of black holes including back reaction effects {{is an open}} problem. One can simplify it by considering the scattering of low-energy neutral particles off extremal Reissner-Nordström black holes [1]. If, in addition, we also consider spherically reduced configurations, the theory can be described, in a region {{very close to the}} horizon, by a solvable effective model. This model is just the Jackiw-Teitelboim model [2] (for <b>details</b> <b>see</b> [3]) <b>I</b> = d 2 x √ −g (R +...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Simple {{analytical}} expressions for {{the spacing}} between the quasi-Landau reson-ances are derived in a first-order WKB approximation. The expressions are valid for any {{value of the}} magnetic quantum number and cover the whole energy range. In addition, several aspects {{of the effect of}} the magnetic quantum number on the spacing of the quasi-Landau resonances are discussed. In a recent paper (Gallas and O’Connell 1982, hereafter referred to as I) analytical expressions for the spacing between the so called quasi-Landau resonances were derived. The spacing was obtained through a first-order WKB approximation consider-ing the spinless electron as constrained to move in the z = 0 plane. (For <b>details</b> <b>see</b> <b>I</b> and the review article of Garstang 1977; the present status of the field is discussed by Gay 1980.) In I the magnetic quantum number of the electron was assumed to be m = 0, which means that the centrifugal barrier present in the WKB model is neglected. This previous work is now extended by taking the centrifugal barrier into consideration and quantitatively studying the influence of the magnetic quantum number on the spacing. This extension is motivated in part by the different Ansiitz...|$|R
