It is an enhanced version of the traditional chroot mechanism. A process that runs within such a jail is unable to access the resources outside of it. Every jail has its own hostname and IP address. It is possible to run multiple jails at the same time, but the kernel is shared among all of them. Hence only software supported by the FreeBSD kernel can be run within a jail.|$|E

40|$|Computer {{and network}} {{security}} has become {{of paramount importance}} in our everyday lives. Cyber attacks {{can lead to a}} wide range of undesirable situations ranging from breaches of personal information and confidential data to loss of human lives. One way to protect computer and network systems is through the use of technical (i. e., software and hardware) <b>security</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> such as firewalls and Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs). Previous work has introduced formal frameworks that can be used to model such technical <b>security</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> Such formal frameworks help us: (1) understand the fundamental limitations of <b>security</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> (2) verify the correctness of the design of <b>security</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> and (3) efficiently design secure systems. While these frameworks provided an important first step for the modeling of <b>security</b> <b>mechanisms</b> and the analysis of their enforcement capabilities, they were able to model only individual <b>security</b> <b>mechanisms</b> and they could not be used to compare the cost of different monitoring designs. In this thesis we present formal frameworks for modeling and reasoning about a larger class of <b>security</b> <b>mechanisms</b> and enforcement scenarios than previous research. We demonstrate how our frameworks can be used to model different types and architectures of <b>security</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> both for centralized and distributed systems (e. g., IDSs and distributed IDSs). We use our frameworks to identify and prove new lower and upper bounds of the enforceable security policies by <b>security</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> These results extend the list of bounds of enforceable security policies identified by previous research and broaden our understanding of fundamental limitations of the enforcement capabilities of <b>security</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> Finally, we demonstrate how to compare the expected cost of different designs of <b>security</b> <b>mechanisms...</b>|$|R
40|$|Recently, web {{services}} security {{has shown a}} significant gesture as several specifications have been developed and implemented to meet the security challenges of {{web services}}. However, {{the performance of the}} <b>security</b> <b>mechanisms</b> is fraught with concerns due to additional security, contents in SOAP messages, the higher number of message exchanges to establish trust as well as extra CPU time to process these additions. In this paper, we consider and compare the performance of various <b>security</b> <b>mechanisms</b> applied on a simple web service tested with different initial message sizes. The test results show that transport layer <b>security</b> <b>mechanisms</b> are considerably faster than message level <b>security</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> Moreover, the effect of adding SAMIL-tokens is negligible and the performance of SAML-based web services depends mostly on the underlying <b>security</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> Finally, the performance penalty of applying STS <b>security</b> <b>mechanisms</b> is significantly high comparing to non-STS mechanisms...|$|R

25|$|The V8 Security Feature Pack (a mid-release product update {{designated}} 8.5) added {{important new}} security features designed to lock down Pervasive.SQL data files. Prior to 8.5, access to Btrieve data {{was controlled by}} the operating system's <b>security</b> <b>mechanism.</b> This meant that any user who needed read/write access to the database, also needed read/write access to the underlying data files. 8.5 introduced new security models, which allow administrators to control access to the Btrieve data using database security. Once activated, database security no longer requires that the user {{has access to the}} underlying files. In addition, client/server configurations no longer require the use of network shares or mapped drives. Applications can reference secure Btrieve data using a URI connection string.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} day, Chen narrowly won {{the election}} with a margin of less than 30,000 votes out of 12.9million votes counted. Both of his referendum proposals were rejected due to insufficient turnout, {{in part by the}} Pan-Blue boycott. Those that did vote for the referendum overwhelmingly favored it. Due to the activation of the so-called National <b>Security</b> <b>Mechanism</b> which prevented military officers from voting, and island-wide reports of election fraud, Pan-Blue candidate Lien Chan refused to concede and sued both for a recount and for a nullification of the outcome while supporters held a week-long protest led by the Pan-Blues front of the presidential office in Taipei. He also claimed that the shooting was staged by Chen to win sympathy votes. Chen claimed that the shooting could not have been staged, because it would be too dangerous to have himself shot in a moving jeep and also challenged Lien and vice-presidential candidate James Soong to try their luck with a shooter in a stationary jeep. This challenge was {{based on the assumption that}} his belly wound was inflicted while he was in the moving jeep and not before or afterwards.|$|E
40|$|Multilevel {{security}} {{deals with}} the problem of controlling the flow of classified information. We present multilevel information flow control mechanisms for distributed systems that allow concurrent accesses to shared data. In a distributed computing environment, the different sites communicate through message passing. Our <b>security</b> <b>mechanisms</b> check the <b>security</b> of information flows caused by computations within individual sites as well as ones caused by communications among the sites. The correct behavior of the <b>security</b> <b>mechanisms</b> cannot be guaranteed if the allowed concurrency is left uncontrolled in the system. We present concurrency control <b>mechanisms</b> for the <b>security</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> In the presence of such concurrency control mechanisms, the consistency of the security data, which the <b>security</b> <b>mechanisms</b> rely upon, is preserved.

2500|$|During {{the time}} when the X-Men were based in the Australian outback, Psylocke gained {{possession}} of a unique suit of armor. Made of an unknown metal, it was lightweight and form-fitting, yet extremely resistant to physical damage, giving Psylocke an added protection to her physical body. The armor was also resistant to projectiles and energy weapons. Wolverine had the armor custom-ordered through a weapons and technology firm named Landau, Luckman, and Lake for [...] "a colleague". Mr. Chang, an agent of Landau, Luckman, and Lake, loaned the armor to Lindsay McCabe since Wolverine had sent her to him. Tyger Tiger also wore the body armor for a short time, and she was briefly trapped in the armor due to a built-in <b>security</b> <b>mechanism,</b> which Wolverine managed to free her from. After traveling through the Siege Perilous and trading bodies with Kwannon, Psylocke no longer used the body armor. When Kwannon, in Betsy's original body, returned to Xavier's mansion, she was wearing an armor that was similar to the one Betsy used to wear, but it has never been officially stated whether or not this armor had the same capabilities as Psylocke’s original one. The same can be said for the armor worn by Psylocke's resurrected original body, after it was brought back during by Madelyne's sisterhood, wearing armor of the same coloring.|$|E

2500|$|On 26 December 2011, an {{accident}} occurred during a maintenance drill involving {{one of the}} systems. While loading missiles into a launcher vehicle from a bunker at the Air Defense Network's school near kibbutz Mashabei Sadeh in the Negev, two soldiers caused twenty Tamir interceptors to {{fall from a height}} of four meters near soldiers and officers without detonating, causing no injury, but making them unserviceable. Ynetnews reported that the soldiers were never in danger because the interceptor missiles are equipped with a <b>security</b> <b>mechanism</b> that prevents premature explosions. The IDF Spokesperson's Unit said that the Air Force commander, Maj. Gen. Ido Nehushtan, appointed a committee to examine the accident and ordered an immediate stop to all Air Defense Network maintenance work until a preliminary investigation was concluded. It also said that during the following week actions would be taken to [...] "improve skills and safety awareness". A security official told Reshet Bet that the failure was twofold in that the soldiers and their commander deviated from severely strict safety protocols, and 20 costly interceptors were lost. Walla! website reported that the soldiers made a mistake in loading the missiles and they fell backwards. The website calculated the damage at $1 million USD (at $50,000 per missile). The missiles were transferred back to Rafael to determine whether they could be repaired.|$|E
2500|$|Clinton {{specifically}} {{pointed to}} the death of Muammar Gaddafi and the conclusion of the Libyan intervention. She had been active during the final stages of the Libyan rebellion, and via Sheik Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, had urged the rebels forces to unify and avoid factional conflicts with each other. She visited Tripoli in October 2011 and, in private, was somewhat guarded about Libya's future following the rebel success. (A video of her exclaiming [...] "Wow" [...] upon first reading on her BlackBerry of Gaddafi's capture achieved wide circulation.) Over the next few years, the aftermath of the Libyan Civil War became characterized by instability, two rival governments, and a slide into status as a failed state; it became a refuge for extremists and terrorist groups, such as ISIL, and spurred a massive refugee crisis as immigrants crossed the Mediterranean to southern Europe. The wisdom of the intervention would continue to be debated, with President Obama maintaining that the intervention had been worthwhile but that the United States and Europe underestimated the ongoing effort needed to rebuild Libyan society afterward; former U.S. Representative to NATO Ivo Daalder stating that the limited goals of the intervention had all been met but that the Libyan people had not seized their opportunity to form a better future and that post-intervention military involvement by the West would have been counterproductive; and scholar Alan J. Kuperman (along with some other scholars and human rights groups) writing that the intervention had been based on the faulty notion that Libya had been headed towards humanitarian disaster when in fact it was not and was thus the intervention was [...] "an abject failure, judged even by its own standards". Kuperman's view that Gaddafi son Saif al-Islam Gaddafi held promise as a Western-style political reformer was in turn disputed by former Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs Derek Chollet, who stated that such faith was misplaced and that Libyans were resistant to any post-intervention <b>security</b> <b>mechanism</b> and to many rebuilding programs. Clinton said in her 2014 memoir that she had been [...] "worried that the challenges ahead would prove overwhelming for even the most well-meaning transitional leaders. If the new government could consolidate its authority, provide security, use oil revenues to rebuild, disarm the militias, and keep extremists out, then Libya would have a fighting chance at building a stable democracy. If not, then the country would face very difficult challenges translating the hopes of a revolution into a free, secure, and prosperous future." ...|$|E
