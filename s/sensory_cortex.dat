5|$|The cortex {{is mapped}} by {{divisions}} into about fifty different functional areas known as Brodmann's areas. These areas are distinctly different when seen under a microscope. The cortex {{is divided into}} two main functional areas – a motor cortex and a <b>sensory</b> <b>cortex.</b> The primary sensory areas receive signals from the sensory nerves and tracts by way of relay nuclei in the thalamus. Primary sensory areas include the visual cortex of the occipital lobe, the auditory cortex in parts of the temporal lobe and insular cortex, and the somatosensory cortex in the parietal lobe. The primary motor cortex, which sends axons down to motor neurons in the brainstem and spinal cord, occupies the rear portion of the frontal lobe, {{directly in front of the}} somatosensory area. The remaining parts of the cortex, are called the association areas. These areas receive input from the sensory areas and lower parts of the brain and are involved in the complex cognitive processes of perception, thought, and decision-making. The main functions of the frontal lobe are to control attention, abstract thinking, behavior, problem solving tasks, and physical reactions and personality. The occipital lobe is the smallest lobe; its main functions are visual reception, visual-spatial processing, movement, and colour recognition. There is a smaller occipital lobule in the lobe known as the cuneus. The temporal lobe controls auditory and visual memories, language, and some hearing and speech.|$|E
25|$|Among {{the handful}} of cases that Evers and Ellgers studied, major lesion sites {{included}} the temporal cortex; however, the specific location and laterality (left vs. right temporal cortex) was variable. Many cases of focal brain lesions had comorbidity with hearing impairment (see hypoacusis), epileptic activity and intoxication. There have also been several findings of acute musical hallucinations in patients with dorsal pons lesions post-stroke and encephalitis potentially due to disruption of connections between the <b>sensory</b> <b>cortex</b> and reticular formation.|$|E
25|$|The {{clinical}} uses of MEG are {{in detecting}} and localizing pathological activity {{in patients with}} epilepsy, and in localizing eloquent cortex for surgical planning in patients with brain tumors or intractable epilepsy. The goal of epilepsy surgery is to remove the epileptogenic tissue while sparing healthy brain areas. Knowing the exact position of essential brain regions (such as the primary motor cortex and primary <b>sensory</b> <b>cortex,</b> visual cortex, and areas involved in speech production and comprehension) helps to avoid surgically induced neurological deficits. Direct cortical stimulation and somatosensory evoked potentials recorded on ECoG are considered {{the gold standard for}} localizing essential brain regions. These procedures can be performed either intraoperatively or from chronically indwelling subdural grid electrodes. Both are invasive.|$|E
50|$|Input {{from all}} <b>sensory</b> <b>cortexes</b> flows to the perirhinal and parahippocampal cortexes, {{from where it}} {{continues}} to the entorhinal cortex, and proceeds to the hippocampus.

50|$|A neuroscientist, Silas Weir Mitchell, {{specialized}} in examining amputees and was fascinated with them. He examined patients who complained of pain or discomfort in their phantom arms, legs, and genitals. Here, Kean ties the motor and <b>sensory</b> <b>cortexes</b> in. When something is amputated, the respective {{part of the}} brain for controlling that part goes black (figuratively). The now obsolete {{part of the brain}} is quickly taken over by neighboring brain areas, such as the face or arms.|$|R
50|$|If {{the middle}} {{cerebral}} artery is occluded during a CVA (or stroke), there is dramatic loss of {{blood flow to}} the area of the brain supplied by this artery (the lateral surfaces of the frontal, parietal and temporal lobes, including the primary motor and <b>sensory</b> <b>cortexes).</b> The leptomeningeal collateral circulation allows a very limited degree of compensation for this. However, this mild compensatory effect is nowhere near adequate - a CVA is a very serious medical emergency.|$|R
25|$|Later {{experiments}} by Nicolelis using rhesus monkeys {{succeeded in}} closing the feedback loop and reproduced monkey reaching and grasping movements in a robot arm. With their deeply cleft and furrowed brains, rhesus monkeys {{are considered to}} be better models for human neurophysiology than owl monkeys. The monkeys were trained to reach and grasp objects on a computer screen by manipulating a joystick while corresponding movements by a robot arm were hidden. The monkeys were later shown the robot directly and learned to control it by viewing its movements. The BCI used velocity predictions to control reaching movements and simultaneously predicted handgripping force. In 2011 O'Doherty and colleagues showed a BCI with sensory feedback with rhesus monkeys. The monkey was brain controlling the position of an avatar arm while receiving sensory feedback through direct intracortical stimulation (ICMS) in the arm representation area of the <b>sensory</b> <b>cortex.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} {{cortical}} stimulation mapping {{dates back to}} the late 19th century. Neurologists David Ferrier and Victor Horsley were some of the first to utilize this technique. Ferrier and Horsley employed CSM to further grasp the structure and function of the pre-Rolandic and post-Rolandic areas, also known as the pre central gyrus and post central gyrus. Prior to the development of more advanced methods, in 1888 C.B. Nancrede utilized a battery operated bipolar probe in order to map the motor cortex. In 1937, Wilder Penfield and Boldrey were able to show that stimulating the precentral gyrus elicited a response contralaterally; a significant finding given that it correlated to the anatomy based on which part of the brain was stimulated. In the early 1900s Charles Sherrington began to use monopolar stimulation in order to elicit a motor response. This technique allowed Sherrington to determine that the precentral gyrus (pre-Rolandic area) is a motor cortex and the postcentral gyrus (post-Rolandic area) is a <b>sensory</b> <b>cortex.</b> These findings, which were repeated by Harvey Cushing through the early 1900s, show that the Rolandic fissure is the point of separation between the motor and sensory cortices. Cushing's work with CSM moved it from an experimental technique to one that became a staple neurosurgery technique used to map the brain and treat epilepsy. Cushing took work that had previously been done on animals, specifically chimpanzees and orangutans, and was able to utilize cortical stimulation mapping to account for the differences between these species and humans. Cushing's work dramatically increased the effectiveness of the treatment utilizing cortical stimulation mapping, as neurosurgeons were now utilizing a more updated picture of the brain.|$|E

40|$|Background: Earlier {{cross-sectional}} {{studies with}} functional {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) in treated patients with schizophrenia have reported abnormalities of cortical motor processing, including reduced lateralization of primary <b>sensory</b> motor <b>cortex.</b> The objective of the present longitudinal study was to evaluate whether such cortical abnormalities represent state or trait phenomena of the disorder. Methods: Seventeen acutely ill, previously untreated patients were studied after 4 weeks and after 8 weeks of olanzapine therapy. Seventeen matched healthy subjects served as control subjects. All subjects underwent two fMRI scans 4 weeks apart during a visually paced motor task using a simple periodic block design. Functional magnetic resonance imaging data were analyzed in Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM 99). Region of interest analyses were used to determine a laterality quotient (an index of lateralization) of motor cortical regions. Results: The fMRI data indicated that patients had reduced activation of the primary <b>sensory</b> motor <b>cortex</b> at 4 weeks but not at 8 weeks; however, the laterality quotient in the primary <b>sensory</b> motor <b>cortex</b> was reduced in patients at both time points. Conclusions: These results suggest that some cortical abnormalities during motor processing represent state phenomena, whereas reduced functional lateralization of the primary <b>sensory</b> motor <b>cortex</b> represents an enduring trait of schizophrenia...|$|R
40|$|Extracting periodicities in rhythmic stimuli is an {{important}} property of the sensory system, illustrated for example {{in the emergence of}} beat and meter perception in music. Moreover, the periodic entertain- ment to rhythms is strongly related to the motor system. In this study, we used the EEG to explore the neural activity elicited by the synchronization of a strictly periodic, isochronous, motor action to non-isochronous sensory input, in both auditory and visual modalities. Preliminary results show a modulation of the neural entertainment to the sensory input, for both auditory and visual conditions, in the movement condition compared to conditions in which the participant was not performing any motor activity. Further testing will allow us to study whether this modulation occurs specifically in <b>sensory</b> <b>cortexes,</b> or whether it requires broader sensory-motor neural network...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of serotonergic innervation to rat cerebral cortex {{was characterized by}} immunohistochemical localization of serotonin combined with autoradiographic imaging of serotonin-uptake sites. In neonatal rat, a transient, dense, serotonergic innervation appears in all primary <b>sensory</b> areas of <b>cortex.</b> In somatosensory cortex, dense patches of serotonergic innervation are aligned with specialized cellular aggregates called barrels. The dense patches are not apparent after 3 weeks of age, and the serotonergic innervation becomes more uniform in adult neocortex.

500|$|From the skin, {{the brain}} {{receives}} information about fine touch, pressure, pain, vibration and temperature. From the joints, the brain receives information about joint position. The <b>sensory</b> <b>cortex</b> is found just near the motor cortex, and, like the motor cortex, has areas related to sensation from different body parts. Sensation collected by a sensory receptor {{on the skin}} is changed to a nerve signal, that is passed {{up a series of}} neurons through tracts in the spinal cord. The posterior column–medial lemniscus pathway contains information about fine touch, vibration and position of joints. Neurons travel up the back part of the spinal cord to the back part of the medulla, where they connect with [...] "second order" [...] neurons that immediately swap sides. These neurons then travel upwards into the ventrobasal complex in the thalamus where they connect with [...] "third order" [...] neurons, and travel up to the sensory cortex.The spinothalamic tract carries information about pain, temperature, and gross touch. Neurons travel up the spinal cord and connect with second-order neurons in the reticular formation of the brainstem for pain and temperature, and also at the ventrobasal complex of the medulla for gross touch.|$|E

2500|$|As {{with many}} {{functions}} of the brain, there are various regions of the brain involved in deciphering fear in humans and other nonhuman species. [...] The amygdala communicates both directions between the prefrontal cortex, hypothalamus, the <b>sensory</b> <b>cortex,</b> the hippocampus, thalamus, septum, and the [...] brainstem. The amygdala {{plays an important role}} in SSDR, such as the ventral amygdalofugal, which is essential for associative learning, and SSDRs are learned through interaction with the environment and others of the same species. An emotional response is created only after the signals have been relayed between the different regions of the brain, and activating the sympathetic nervous systems; which controls the flight, fight, freeze, fright, and faint response. Often a damaged amygdala can cause impairment in the recognition of fear (like the human case of patient S.M.). This impairment can cause different species to lack the sensation of fear, and often can become overly confident, confronting larger peers, or walking up to predatory creatures.|$|E

A compression lesion was induced in the right <b>sensory</b> motor <b>cortex</b> of rat brains. At 0. 5, 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48 and 72 h after lesioning, motor functions were evaluated by behavioral tests, and cortical layers IV and V were examined by electron microscopy. Behavioral recovery was observed at 48 h after lesioning. At 0. 5 - 1 h in the lesioned area, the neuropil was expanded and contained affected cells. Apoptotic cells were found between 0. 5 - 72 h, and at 12 h, 47. 3 % of the total cell number was apoptotic cells. On the contralateral side, cells showed an enlarged endoplasmic reticulum at 3 h, indicating secondary delayed cell death. Our results show that a compression lesion is a useful model for studying ultrastructural changes in injured cells. The lesion results in the penumbra zone with apoptotic cell death between 0. 5 - 72 h. As secondary delayed cell death occurred on the contralateral side at three hours after lesioning might be the time period during which injured, but still viable, neurons can be targets for acute treatment.
