40|$|The {{subthalamic nucleus}} (STN) {{is a small}} but vitally {{important}} structure in the basal ganglia. Because of its small volume, and its localization in the basal ganglia, the STN can best be visualized using ultra-high resolution 7 Tesla (T) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In the present study, first we individually segmented 7 T MRI STN masks to generate atlas probability maps. Secondly, the individually segmented STN masks and the probability maps were used to derive cortico-subthalamic white matter tract strength. Tract strength measures were then taken to test two functional STN hypotheses which account for the efficiency in <b>stopping</b> <b>a</b> <b>motor</b> response: the right inferior fronto-subthalamic (rIFC-STN) hypothesis and the posterior medial frontal cortex-subthalamic (pMFC-STN) hypothesis.

40|$|A key {{component}} of crime deterrence is the certainty of detection, but in 2005 seat belt laws in 27 states prohibited law enforcement officers from ticketing an observed violation unless the driver is stopped for another offense, which {{is referred to as}} secondary enforcement. Thirteen states and the District of Columbia have upgraded from secondary to primary enforcement, which authorizes police to <b>stop</b> <b>a</b> <b>motor</b> vehicle if a driver or occupant covered by the law is observed not using a seat belt. To test the impact of seat belt enforcement provisions, cross-sectional time series regressions are estimated for annual driver and occupant fatality rates in the American states from 1990 to 2002. Using several control variables for other traffic policies and state demographics, the results indicate primary enforcement is more effective in saving lives than secondary enforcement. Furthermore, upgrading to a primary law enhances the effectiveness of an existing state mandatory use law. © 2006 by the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — It {{has been}} {{observed}} that modern heavy industries are plagued with hazardous working environments like high temperature, high voltage etc. that pose a severe threat {{to the life of}} a human operator. Most common examples are steel plants and mines which report huge losses of life every year. Thus, {{there is a need to}} develop a system which any human personnel can use to control a process without exposing himself to any type of prevailing work hazards. This paper describes a Remote Voice Control and Security System (RVCS) to solve the above problem. It is a system that can control any process (e. g. switching ON/OFF <b>a</b> dc <b>motor</b> for experimental purposes) from anywhere in the world by vocalizing appropriate commands into a mobile phone. The hardware of the system comprises of a GSM handset connected to a TI TMS C 6713 DSP Starter Kit via a stereo audio cable. An authorized operator at a remote location uses his GSM handset to connect to this system located at the process site. The system prompts the operator for access authentication (security feature) and once authenticated the user controls the plant operation by voicing the appropriate predefined commands (e. g. starting and <b>stopping</b> <b>a</b> <b>motor).</b> The DSK kit carries out real time speaker recognition for access authentication and speech verification [2 - 3] for decoding the vocal commands. The software of the system has been developed in ANSIC in Code Composer Studio Platform...|$|R

40|$|This study aims {{to explore}} whether human {{intentions}} {{to move or}} cease to move right and left hands can be decoded from spatiotemporal features in non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG) {{in order to control}} a discrete two-dimensional cursor movement for a potential multi-dimensional Brain-Computer interface (BCI). Five naïve subjects performed either sustaining or <b>stopping</b> <b>a</b> <b>motor</b> task with time locking to a predefined time window by using motor execution with physical movement or motor imagery. Spatial filtering, temporal filtering, feature selection and classification methods were explored. The performance of the proposed BCI was evaluated by both offline classification and online two-dimensional cursor control. Event-related desynchronization (ERD) and post-movement event-related synchronization (ERS) were observed on the contralateral hemisphere to the hand moved for both motor execution and motor imagery. Feature analysis showed that EEG beta band activity in the contralateral hemisphere over the motor cortex provided the best detection of either sustained or ceased movement of the right or left hand. The offline classification of four motor tasks (sustain or cease to move right or left hand) provided 10 -fold cross-validation accuracy as high as 88 % for motor execution and 73 % for motor imagery. The subjects participating in experiments with physical movement were able to complete the online game with motor execution at the average accuracy of 85. 5 ± 4. 65 %; Subjects participating in motor imagery study also completed the game successfully. The proposed BCI provides a new practical multi-dimensional method by noninvasive EEG signal associated with human natural behavior, which does not need long-term training...|$|R
40|$|Self-control {{is defined}} as the process in which thoughts, emotions, or prepotent {{responses}} are inhibited to efficiently enact a more focal goal. Self-control not only allows for more adaptive individual decision making but also promotes adaptive social decision making. In this chapter, we examine a burgeoning area of interdisciplinary research: the neuroscience of self-control in social decision making. We examine research on self-control in complex social contexts examined from a social neuroscience perspective. We review correlational evidence from neuroimaging studies and causal evidence from neuromodulation studies (i. e., brain stimulation). We specifically highlight research that shows that self-control involves the lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) across a number of social domains and behaviors. Research has also begun to directly integrate nonsocial with social forms of self-control, showing that the basic neurobiological processes involved in <b>stopping</b> <b>a</b> <b>motor</b> response appear to be involved in social contexts that require self-control. Further, neural traits, such as baseline activation in the lateral PFC, can explain sources of individual differences in self-control capacity. We explore whether techniques that change brain functioning could target neural mechanisms related to self-control capacity to potentially enhance self-control in social behavior. Finally, we discuss several research questions ripe for examination. We broadly suggest that future research can now turn to exploring how neural traits and situational affordances interact to impact self-control in social decision making in order to continue to elucidate the processes that allow people to maintain and realize stable goals in a dynamic and often uncertain social environment...|$|R

40|$|The neural {{systems that}} support motor {{adaptation}} in humans {{are thought to}} be distinct from those that support the declarative system. Yet, during motor adaptation changes in motor commands are supported by a fast adaptive process that has important properties (rapid learning, fast decay) that are usually associated with the declarative system. The fast process can be contrasted to a slow adaptive process that also supports motor memory, but learns gradually and shows resistance to forgetting. Here we show that after people <b>stop</b> performing <b>a</b> <b>motor</b> task, the fast motor memory can be disrupted by a task that engages declarative memory, but the slow motor memory is immune from this interference. Furthermore, we find that the fast/declarative component {{plays a major role in}} the consolidation of the slow motor memory. Because of the competitive nature of declarative and nondeclarative memory during consolidation, impairment of the fast/declarative component leads to improvements in the slow/nondeclarative component. Therefore, the fast process that supports formation of motor memory is not only neurally distinct from the slow process, but it shares critical resources with the declarative memory system...|$|R

40|$|The Minnesota Supreme Court {{recently}} addressed {{whether a}} Minnesota statute authorizing {{law enforcement to}} stop motorists {{based solely on the}} presence of special license plates issued primarily to repeat drunken drivers is proper under the United States and Minnesota Constitutions. In State v. Henning, the court held the statute unconstitutional by a 4 - 3 decision. Finding no persuasive reason to do otherwise, the court struck down the legislature 2 ̆ 7 s attempt to eliminate the requirement that law enforcement have “reasonable articulable suspicion” to conduct <b>an</b> investigatory <b>stop</b> of <b>a</b> <b>motor</b> vehicle. This article provides a brief survey of similar laws in other states that require offenders to visually inform the police and public that they have been convicted of drunken driving or other crimes [...] a requirement reminiscent of centuries-old “scarlet letter” sentencing.

40|$|Impulsive {{behavior}} in humans partly relates to inappropriate overvaluation of reward-associated stimuli. Hence, {{it is desirable}} to develop methods of behavioral modification that can reduce stimulus value. Here, we tested whether one kind of behavioral modification—the rapid stopping of actions {{in the face of}} reward-associated stimuli—could lead to subsequent devaluation of those stimuli. We developed a novel paradigm with three consecutive phases: implicit reward learning, a stop-signal task, and an auction procedure. In the learning phase, we associated abstract shapes with different levels of reward. In the stop-signal phase, we paired half those shapes with occasional stop-signals, requiring the rapid <b>stopping</b> of <b>an</b> initiated <b>motor</b> response, while the other half of shapes was not paired with stop signals. In the auction phase, we assessed the subjective value of each shape via willingness-to-pay. In 2 experiments, we found that participants bid less for shapes that were paired with stop-signals compared to shapes that were not. This suggests that the requirement to try to rapidly <b>stop</b> <b>a</b> response decrements stimulus value. Two follow-on control experiments suggested that the result was specifically due to stopping action rather than aversiveness, effort, conflict, or salience associated with stop signals. This study makes a theoretical link between research on inhibitory control and value. It also provides a novel behavioral paradigm with carefully operationalized learning, treatment, and valuation phases. This framework lends itself to both behavioral modification procedures in clinical disorders and research on the neural underpinnings of stimulus devaluation...|$|R

40|$|The Escherichia coli two-component chemosensory pathway {{has been}} {{extensively}} studied, and its response regulator, CheY, has become a paradigm for response regulators. However, unlike E. coli, most chemotactic nonenteric bacteria have multiple CheY homologues. The roles and cellular localization of the CheYs in Rhodobacter sphaeroides were determined. Only two CheYs were required for chemotaxis, CheY(6) and either CheY(3) or CheY(4). These CheYs were partially localized to {{either of the two}} chemotaxis signaling clusters, with the remaining protein delocalized. Interestingly, mutation of the CheY(6) phosphorylatable aspartate to asparagine produced <b>a</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>motor,</b> caused by phosphorylation on alternative site Ser- 83 by CheA.

Analogous mutations in R. sphaeroides CheYs did not cause activation. These results suggest that although the R. sphaeroides and E. coli CheYs are similar in that they require phosphorylation for activation, they may differ in both the nature of the phosphorylation-induced conformational change and their subsequent interactions with the flagellar motor. Caution should therefore be used when projecting from E. coli CheY onto novel response regulators...|$|R
