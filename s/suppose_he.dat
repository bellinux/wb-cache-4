5|$|He {{is always}} there, he knows everything. He is infallible but always failing. When the boys rescue him, he is {{typically}} emaciated, dehydrated, semi-conscious, delirious; they must succor him with candy bars and water. He {{can take on}} any shape, but reveals his identity within moments of doing so. He never discusses a case except the one he's working on in a given novel, so that his legendary close-mouthedness turns to garrulousness when a Hardy Boys novel begins, which is of course {{the only time we}} ever get to see him. All the same, he only discusses the case in enough detail to mislead his sons and put them in mortal danger. He has systems of information and data-gathering that put the FBI to shame, yet he is always losing his case notes, his ciphers, his microfilm, or some other valuable clue, usually by leaving it in his extra pair of pants, meaning that the Boys have to drive to Canada or Florida or somewhere to retrieve it. I <b>suppose</b> <b>he</b> isn't mysterious at all; he simply embodies what many think of their own fathers: utterly powerful, contemptibly inept.|$|E
25|$|Galileo {{put forward}} a bold {{alternative}} conjecture: <b>suppose,</b> <b>he</b> said, that we always observe objects coming to a halt simply because some friction is always occurring. Galileo had no equipment with which to objectively confirm his conjecture, but he suggested that without any friction to slow down an object in motion, its inherent tendency is to maintain its speed without the application of any additional force.|$|E
25|$|Tom Bombadil {{is not an}} {{important}} person—to the narrative. I <b>suppose</b> <b>he</b> has some importance as a 'comment.' I mean, I do not really write like that: he is just an invention (who first appeared in The Oxford Magazine about 1933), and he represents something that I feel important, though I would not be prepared to analyse the feeling precisely. I would not, however, have left him in, {{if he did not}} have some kind of function.|$|E

500|$|Reverend Samuel Bishop (1731–95) was a poet, {{headmaster}} of Merchant Taylors' {{school and}} rector of Ditton. His posthumously published book entitled Poems (1796) was much admired and several times reprinted. Not everyone was complimentary about Bishop and his verses: [...] "the character of Bishop's countenance {{is not very}} intellectual, {{and there is a}} timid, and almost mean expression about the mouth. He looks but little qualified to insist upon the discipline necessary to be observed at Merchant Tailor's (sic) school, or to wield the weapons of Dr. Busby. But, we <b>suppose,</b> <b>he</b> did both occasionally, besides writing his epigrams, and composing verses to his wife, — [...] "To Mrs. Bishop." [...] Of this lady he sings sometimes more like the tea-kettle than the nightingale".|$|E

2500|$|On 24 October 1961, a {{group of}} campaigners {{including}} J. M. Richards, {{the editor of the}} Architectural Review, went to see Harold Macmillan, the Conservative Prime Minister, to plead for the preservation of the arch, arguing that if it really had to be moved, that it should be dismantled and re-erected elsewhere. As J. M. Richards recalled, [...] "Macmillan listened – or I <b>suppose</b> <b>he</b> listened [...] he sat without moving with his eyes apparently closed. He asked no questions; in fact he said nothing except that he would consider the matter." ...|$|E
2500|$|After his conversion, Paul went to Damascus, where Acts 9 states he was healed of his {{blindness}} and baptized by Ananias of Damascus. Paul {{says that it}} was in Damascus that he barely escaped death. Paul also says that he then went first to Arabia, and then came back to Damascus. Paul's trip to Arabia is not mentioned anywhere else in the Bible, and some <b>suppose</b> <b>he</b> actually traveled to Mount Sinai for meditations in the desert. He describes in Galatians how three years after his conversion he went to Jerusalem. There he met James and stayed with Simon Peter for 15 days. Paul located Mount Sinai in Arabia in [...]|$|E

2500|$|The driving {{intellectual}} curiosity {{that was}} to distinguish Paul Wild was evident from an early age. He said, [...] " [...] showed great appreciation if ever I was successful in anything but she didn't push me." [...] He was interested in building things with model house kits, Meccano and cardboard; an early gift of a Hornby train from his mother started him on his lifelong love of trains. Then he [...] "read about the great man Isambard Kingdom Brunel and all his works, which were not only railways but the extraordinary ships that he built at the time. Well, I <b>suppose</b> <b>he</b> was the first source of inspiration to me." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Oxfordian {{theory of}} Shakespeare authorship proposes that De Vere wrote the plays and poems {{traditionally}} attributed to William Shakespeare. The attribution has {{been rejected by}} nearly all academic Shakespeareans. , quoting William Hunt: [...] "No, absolutely no competent student of the period, historical or literary, has ever taken this theory seriously. First of all, the founding premise is false—there is nothing especially mysterious about William Shakespeare, who is as well documented as one could expect of {{a man of his}} time. None of his contemporaries or associates expressed any doubt about the authorship of his poems and plays. Nothing about De Vere (Oxford) suggests he had any great talent, {{and there is no reason}} to <b>suppose</b> <b>he</b> would have suppressed any talents he possessed." [...] : [...] "There is, it should be noted, no academic Shakespearian of any standing who goes along with the Oxfordian theory." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a 2002 {{review of}} NKS, the Nobel laureate and {{elementary}} particle physicist Steven Weinberg wrote, [...] "Wolfram himself is a lapsed elementary particle physicist, and I <b>suppose</b> <b>he</b> can't resist trying to apply {{his experience with}} digital computer programs {{to the laws of}} nature. This has led him to the view (also considered in a 1981 paper by Richard Feynman) that nature is discrete rather than continuous. He suggests that space consists of a set of isolated points, like cells in a cellular automaton, and that even time flows in discrete steps. Following an idea of Edward Fredkin, he concludes that the universe itself would then be an automaton, like a giant computer. It's possible, but I can't see any motivation for these speculations, except that {{this is the sort of}} system that Wolfram and others have become used to in their work on computers. So might a carpenter, looking at the moon, suppose that it is made of wood." ...|$|E

2500|$|Some {{commentators}} have viewed Ptolemy's comparatively dispassionate approach towards points of astrological contention as reason to <b>suppose</b> <b>he</b> {{was more interested}} in the theoretical principles than the actual practice of astrology. [...] On the other hand, the objective tone that marks his style; his assertion that the subject is natural (by which he makes no demand for oaths of secrecy from its students as some contemporaries do); and the way he shows respectful reference to alternative views without vilifying authors whose practices might differ from his own, [...] all helped to secure the text’s historical reputation as an intellectually superior one. Classics scholar Mark Riley raised these points in his assessment that Ptolemy approached the subject of astrology with exactly the same theoretical inclination that he applied to astronomy, geography and the other sciences on which he wrote. This distinctive style of approach led Riley to conclude: [...] "The respect shown to Ptolemy’s work by all later astrologers was due, not to its usefulness to the practitioner, but to his magisterial synthesis of astrology and science".|$|E
2500|$|Shevchenko {{was arrested}} {{along with other}} members of the society on April 5, 1847. Tsar Nicholas read Shevchenko's poem, [...] "Dream". Vissarion Belinsky wrote in his memoirs that, Nicholas I, knowing Ukrainian very well, laughed and chuckled whilst reading the section about himself, but his mood quickly turned to bitter hatred when he read about his wife. Shevchenko had mocked her frumpy {{appearance}} and facial tics, which she had developed fearing the Decembrist Uprising and its plans to kill her family. After reading this section the Tsar indignantly stated [...] "I <b>suppose</b> <b>he</b> had reasons not to be on terms with me, but what has she done to deserve this?" [...] In the official report of Orlov Shevchenko was accused in using [...] "Little-Russian language" [...] (archaic Russian name for Ukrainian language) of outrageous content instead of being grateful to be redeemed out of serfdom. In the report Orlov claimed that Shevchenko was expressing a cry over alleged enslavement and disaster of Ukraine, glorified the Hetman Administration (Cossack Hetmanate) and Cossack liberties and [...] "with incredible audacity poured slander and bile on persons of Imperial House".|$|E
2500|$|The Flatiron Building {{has become}} an icon of New York City, and the public {{response}} to it was enthusiastic, but the critical response to {{it at the time}} was not completely positive, and what praise it garnered was often for the cleverness of the engineering involved. Montgomery Schuyler, editor of Architectural Record, said that its [...] "awkwardness [...] entirely undisguised, and without even an attempt to disguise them, if they have not even been aggravated by the treatment. ... The treatment of the tip is an additional and it seems wanton aggravation of the inherent awkwardness of the situation." [...] He praised the surface of the building, and the detailing of the terra-cotta work, but criticized the practicality of the large number of windows in the building: [...] " [...] can, perhaps, find wall space within for one roll top desk without overlapping the windows, with light close {{in front of him and}} close behind him and close on one side of him. But <b>suppose</b> <b>he</b> needed a bookcase? Undoubtedly he has a highly eligible place from which to view processions. But for the transaction of business?" ...|$|E

2500|$|For Kierkegaard's author, Vigilius Haufniensis, anxiety/dread/angst (depending on the {{translation}} and context) is unfocused fear. Haufniensis uses {{the example of}} a man standing {{on the edge of a}} tall building or cliff. From this height he can see all the possibilities of life. He's reflecting on what he could become if he only threw himself into the power of his own choice. As long as he stands there he stands at the crossroads of life, unable to make a decision and live within its boundaries. The mere fact that one has the possibility and freedom to do something, even the most terrifying of possibilities, triggers immense feelings of dread. Haufniensis called this our [...] "dizziness of freedom."Anxiety may be compared with dizziness. He whose eye happens to look down into the yawning abyss becomes dizzy. But what is the reason for this? It is just as much in his own eye as in the abyss, for <b>suppose</b> <b>he</b> had not looked down. Hence, anxiety is the dizziness of freedom, which emerges when the spirit wants to [...] the synthesis and freedom looks down into its own possibility, laying hold of finiteness to support itself. Freedom succumbs to dizziness. Further than this, psychology cannot and will not go. In that very moment everything is changed, and freedom, when it again rises, sees that it is guilty. Between these two moments lies the leap, which no science has explained and which no science can explain. He who becomes guilty in anxiety becomes as ambiguously guilty as it is possible to become.
