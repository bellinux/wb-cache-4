Such a system doesn't {{oscillate}} at all, but when displaced from its equilibrium steady-state output it returns to it by exponential decay, approaching the <b>steady</b> <b>state</b> <b>value</b> asymptotically. It has an impulse response that is the sum of two decaying exponential functions with different rates of decay. As the quality factor decreases the slower decay mode becomes stronger relative to the faster mode and dominates the system's response resulting in a slower system. A second-order low-pass filter with a very low quality factor has a nearly first-order step response; the system's output responds to a step input by slowly rising toward an asymptote.|$|E

Thus, the effects of saturation of a control system {{must be taken into}} account when the gradient of the objective function is estimated and the necessary optimality conditions are checked. In particular, because the optimality conditions cannot be checked directly in the presence of active constraints on the manipulated variables, approximations of the <b>steady</b> <b>state</b> <b>values</b> of the manipulated variables as functions of the setpoints (static plant model) are needed in order to be able to evaluate the optimality conditions.

In a simple one-species formulation, a subpopulation may occupy a patch, move from one patch to another empty patch, or die out leaving an empty patch behind. In such a case, the proportion of occupied patches may be represented aswhere m is the rate of colonization, and e is the rate of extinction.

Since '''''' increases, so must the temperature drop across the turbine and the turbine power output.

Since the corrected speed of the compressor has hardly changed, the working point tends to move upwards, along a line of roughly constant corrected speed. As time progresses the shaft begins to accelerate and the effect just described diminishes.|$|E
