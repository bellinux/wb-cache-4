Professor G.Kh. Akhatov brought fundamental contribution to the research of dialects and lexicological features of Turkic languages, mainly, Tatar, in formation and development of phraseological researches. G.Akhatov was a founder of chairs of the Tatar language and the literature in a number of the state universities and teacher training colleges of the country in places of compact residing of the Tatar population, <b>specialised</b> <b>councils</b> about defence of doctor's and master's dissertations.

50|$|Spain {{was subject}} to {{different}} assemblies: the Cortes in Castile, the assembly in Navarre, and one each for the three regions of Aragon, which preserved traditional rights and laws from {{the time when they}} were separate kingdoms. This made Spain and its possessions difficult to rule, unlike France, which, while divided into regional states, had a single Estates-General. The lack of a viable supreme assembly led to power defaulting into Philip's hands, especially as manager and final arbiter of the constant conflict between different authorities. To deal with the difficulties arising from this situation, authority was administered by local agents appointed by the crown and viceroys carrying out crown instructions. Philip felt it necessary {{to be involved in the}} detail, and he presided over <b>specialised</b> <b>councils</b> for state affairs, finance, war, and the Inquisition.|$|R

40|$|The {{enlargement}} of the European Union to 25 Member States is having a particularly strong impact {{on the work of}} the Council. It has made it all the more important to streamline and better coordinate the <b>Council’s</b> <b>configurations</b> and preparatory bodies. The increase from 11 to 20 official languages poses unprecedented practical challenges, and {{it remains to be seen}} whether the new linguistic regime will make it possible to cope. New guidelines for the presidency and delegations have been adopted concerning preparation and management of meetings. Other innovations are being explored under the Dutch Presidency. The first months of experience in EU 25 suggest that continuing efforts will be required to ensure that Council business can be managed efficiently and effectively in the coming years...|$|R

25|$|The Spanish crown at {{the time}} ruled through a system of royal councils. The most {{significant}} of these were the Councils of State and its subordinate Council for War, that were in turn supported by the seven professional councils for the different regions, and four <b>specialised</b> <b>councils</b> for the Inquisition, the Military Orders, Finance and the Crusade tax. These councils were then supplemented by small committees, or juntas, as necessary, such as the 'junta of the night' through which Philip II exercised personal authority {{towards the end of}} his reign. As a matter of policy, Philip had tried to avoid appointing grandees to major positions of power within his government and relied heavily on the lesser nobles, the so-called 'service' nobility. Philip II had taken the traditional system of councils and applied a high degree of personal scrutiny to them, especially in matters of paperwork, which he declined to delegate – the result was a 'ponderous' process. To his contemporaries, the degree of personal oversight he exercised was excessive; his 'self-imposed role as the chief clerk to the Spanish empire' was not thought entirely appropriate. Philip first started to become engaged in practical government at the age of 15, when he joined Philip II's private committee.|$|R

40|$|The General Affairs Council (GAC) {{has so far}} {{not lived}} up to the {{expectations}} created by the Treaty of Lisbon, which in principle assigned it an important position within the EU system. The EU’s new General Affairs Council (GAC) –chaired by the Trio Presidency– was designed to fulfil the role of strategic coordinator of policy-making in the Union. Nearly a year-and-a-half since its creation, this aim is even more pertinent than ever, since the need to develop that function has become more acute. The GAC has not asserted itself politically and other possible coordinators that are well established and permanently based in Brussels –such as the President of the European Council, the COREPER, and even the Secretariat General of the Council– are not the ideal actors to carry out the coordinating function, which needs a strong political involvement of the member states at the ministerial level. The GAC has probably achieved the basic goal of guaranteeing a minimum of consistency {{in the work of the}} nine other <b>Council</b> <b>configurations</b> and it has formally prepared and followed up on the meetings of the European Council. However, it has failed to become a powerful and distinctive actor with a strategic approach...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the {{participation}} of ministers in the Council of the European Union. The first goal is to explore the participation as such, i. e. how often the ministers attend the Council meetings and what differences there are among the member states and the <b>Council</b> <b>configurations.</b> Secondly, the thesis seeks to reveal factors at the institutional (European), national and governmental level which {{have an impact on}} the participation. From the theoretical point of view, the thesis is framed by the rational choice approach. In terms of methodology, a quantitative analysis based on extensive dataset for the period 2009 - 2015 and logistic regression have been employed. The thesis concludes that the ministers attend the Council meetings quite often - the average for the period was 64 %. Regarding the individual factors, it is argued that the ministers representing the presidency country attend the sessions more often. Similarly, the participation is higher if there are many points on the agenda or if the minister represents a pro-European government. On the contrary, the probability of the participation is lower if the ministers face upcoming legislative elections at home. The analysis also shows that the public attitude towards the EU is irrelevant in this case. The results are, finally, [...] ...|$|R

40|$|This article {{presents}} the principal {{results of the}} doctoral thesis “Direct Operational Methods in the Environment of a Computer Algebra System” by Margarita Spiridonova (Institute of mathematics and Informatics, BAS), successfully defended before the <b>Specialised</b> Academic <b>Council</b> for Informatics and Mathematical Modelling on 23 March, 2009. The presented research {{is related to the}} operational calculus approach and its representative applications. Operational methods are considered, as well as their program implementation using the computer algebra system Mathematica. The Heaviside algorithm for solving Cauchy’s problems for linear ordinary differential equations with constant coefficients is considered {{in the context of the}} Heaviside-Mikusinski operational calculus. The program implementation of the algorithm is described and illustrative examples are given. An extension of the Heaviside algorithm, developed by I. Dimovski and S. Grozdev, is used for finding periodic solutions of linear ordinary differential equations with constant coefficients both in the non-resonance and in the resonance cases. The features of its program implementation are described and examples are given. An operational method for solving local and nonlocal boundary value problems for some equations of the mathematical physics (the heat equation, the wave equation and the equation of a free supported beam) is developed and the capabilities of the corresponding program packages for solving those problems are described. A comparison with other methods for solving the same types of problems is included and the advantages of the operational methods are marked...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} basic motivations behind Engineering Data Management (EDM) {{in a decade}} long Large Hadron Collider (LHC) project with at least another decades {{operational}} period at CERN. The main argument is that without strict managerial principles to control engineering work the exploitation of EDM becomes impossible. Structured and organized configuration management is the absolute prerequisite for an effective integration of design, manufacturing and installation work. EDM is seen to provide all collaborating parties of the project with a coherent and up-to-date view of the product specifications together with other relevant information, such as products change log, responsibilities and status indicators during the products whole life-cycle. It is argued that by combining simple and commonly accepted managerial principles with an advanced EDM system the outcome supports the main phases of products evolution, i. e. design, assembly, operation and maintenance. The paper outlines the main tasks of the configuration management and the fundamental requirements of EDM {{in order to meet}} LHC-projects complexity, stringent budget, high quality and tight schedule constraints set by the CERN <b>Council.</b> Keywords: <b>configuration</b> management, new product development, project management, concurrent engineering, engineering data managemen...|$|R
