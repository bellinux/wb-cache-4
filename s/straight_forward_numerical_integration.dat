40|$|The {{main goal}} of this work was an {{investigation}} of the dynamical stability of potential additional terres-trial planets in the habitable zone 1 (HZ) of systems in the solar neighbourhood (< 30 pc). Therefore we in-vestigated the long-term evolution of fictitious planets in the full three-body problem. We performed a para-metric study, where the gas giantâ€™s eccentricity, semi-major axis and mass were varied as well as the mass and the inclination of the fictitious planets. We used <b>straight</b> <b>forward</b> <b>numerical</b> <b>integrations</b> and checked the stability {{with the help of the}} maximum eccentricty. Additionally we used the Relative Lyapunov Indica-tor (RLI) as a chaos indicator. The {{goal of this}} work is to investigate possible target systems of upcoming space missions in which already one extrasolar planet has been found. We will be able to exclude all systems in which no additional terrestrial planet can move on stable orbits inside the HZ. 1...|$|R

40|$|A {{complete}} {{procedure for}} calculating the joint predictive distribution of future observations {{based on the}} cointegrated vector autoregression is presented. The large degree of uncertainty in the choise of the cointegration vectors is incorporated into the analysis through a prior distribution on the cointegration vectors which allows the forecaster to realistically express his beliefs. This prior leads {{to a form of}} model averaging where the predictions from the models based on the different cointegration vectors are weighted together in an optimal way. The ideas of Litterman (1980) are adapted for the prior on the short run dynamics with a resulting prior which only depends on a few hyperparameters and is therefore easily specified. A <b>straight</b> <b>forward</b> <b>numerical</b> evaluation of the predictive distribution based on Gibbs sampling is proposed.

In our survey of the numerical procedure we account for the circumstance that the objective function might result from a more complex measurement process and is, in the worst case, known on a finite sequence of coordinate values, only. We contrast the performance of the resulting algorithms with a procedure based on a <b>straight</b> <b>forward</b> <b>numerical</b> quadrature of the underlying integral transform and asses its efficienty for two benchmark Fourier-Bessel pairs. An application to the problem of finite-size beam-shape convolution in polar coordinates, relevant in the context of tissue optics and optoacoustics, is used to illustrate the versatility and computational efficiency of the numerical procedure.

30|$|At present, {{the study}} of {{supercritical}} water (SCW) flow in wellbores is at the starting stage. In this paper, a simple but useful model is developed to study the effect of seawater on the thermophysical properties of SCW in offshore vertical wellbores. Firstly, based on the momentum and energy balance equations, a flow model describing SCW flow in a tube is established. Then, coupled with transient heat transfer model in seawater and formation, and thermophysical parameters of SCW, a comprehensive mathematical model is established. In order to solve the model, the governing equations are expressed {{in the form of}} difference equations. The <b>straight</b> <b>forward</b> <b>numerical</b> method is adopted to solve the model from wellhead to well-bottom. In the process of solving, iterative technique is used to control the calculation accuracy. Finally, type curves of SCW flow in offshore wellbores and sensitivity analysis are discussed. Results show that (a) the flow of seawater results in a rapid decline in the temperature/enthalpy of SCW in wellbores. (b) Heat loss is the dominant factor of physical parameter distribution in wellbores when the injection rate is relatively small. (c) Heat loss has an obvious influence on temperature drop when SCW is sparse in volume. (d) The SCW pressure decreases with increasing of injection temperature.|$|R
40|$|Using {{a simple}} {{dynamical}} {{model of a}} wind-driven ocean circulation of the Stommel type, and an analytical basis developed to objectively analyze the sea surface height residuals from an altimeter and, in the process, to determine the total flow instead of just the near surface geostrophic component associated with the given sea surface topography. The method is based on first deriving {{the solution to the}} forced problem for a given wind stress required to develop a hypothetical true or perfect data field and to establishing the basis for the objective analysis. The stream function and the surface height field for the forced problem are developed in terms of certain characteristic functions with the same expansion coefficients for both fields. These characteristic functions are simply the solutions for a homogeneous elliptic equation for the stream function and the solutions of an inhomogeneous balance equation for the height field. For the objective analysis, using a sample of randomly selected height values from the true data field, the height field characteristic functions are used to fit the given topography in a least squares sense. The resulting expansion coefficients then permit the synthesis of the total flow field via the stream function characteristic modes and the solution is perfectly well behaved even along the equator. The method of solution is easily adaptable to realistic ocean basis by <b>straight</b> <b>forward</b> <b>numerical</b> methods. The analytical basis of the theory and the results for an ideal rectangular basin on a beta plane are described...|$|R
40|$|The semi-classical {{theory of}} a finite {{temperature}} Bose condensed gas is presented, {{based on the}} Gross-Pitaevskii equation. The theory leads to a <b>straight</b> <b>forward</b> <b>numerical</b> technique used to generate self-consistent thermally-excited states of a dilute boson gas, results of which are presented. The numerical technique is generalised to multi-component spinor fields, with results presented for the self-consistent thermally-excited states of a two-component field. The process of evaporative cooling is modeled by following the time evolution of the system using the same equation. It is shown that the subsequent rethermalisation of the thermally-excited state produces a cooler, more coherent condensate. Further results presented show that trapping vortex states with the ground state may be possible. The process of sympathetic cooling is modeled in a two-component spinor field using a generalisation of the evaporative cooling model. Results presented show that the subsequent rethermalisation and cross-thermalisation of the fields produces a cooler spinor condensate. Results of the numerical calculation of the energy spectrum of a self-consistent thermally-excited state are presented. It is shown that the Gross-Pitaevskii equation leads to the reproduction of the Kohn modes to an accuracy of 0. 08 %, {{a direct result of}} treating all the excited modes consistently. The temperature of the self-consistent thermally-excited state is calculated in the non-interacting limit. It is shown that the maximum condensate population occurs for a normalised temperature of T/T sup 0 c approx 0. 4. Finally, a direct characterisation of the temperature of the Bose-condensed gas with respect to the position of the 'r. f. scalpel' during the evaporative cooling process is presented...|$|R
40|$|A new {{quadrilateral}} {{thin plate}} bending element with 12 degrees of freedom, called element ACGCQ, {{has been developed}} by employing both the area coordinates and the generalized conforming approach. The deflection field of the element is expressed as a polynomial, in terms of area coordinates, which is corresponding to a fourth order polynomial in terms of Cartesian coordinates x and y. The 12 generalized conforming conditions implemented are four-point and four-line compatibility conditions for the deflection w, and four-line compatibility conditions for the normal slope Ïˆn. Since {{the relation between the}} area and Cartesian coordinates is linear, the formulation of the element stiffness matrix is <b>straight</b> <b>forward.</b> Several <b>numerical</b> examples were employed to test the proposed element.

40|$|In {{this paper}} a two {{terminal}} VSC-HVDC system {{embedded in a}} strong grid ACenvironment is considered, emphasizing modeling, controllers design and small-signal stability analysis. Traditionally, DC cables are most often modeled by &#x 3 A 0;-sections, and when using them for higher frequencies or in case of transmission over long distances, approximation accuracy aspects must be considered. Here, a distributed parameter cable model, based on the damped wave equation, is used to overcome this limitation. It is shown that the VSC-HVDC system can be described by a forward transfer function cascaded with a feedback loop. The first transfer function will be different, due to which input and output variables that are considered but is in all realistic cases stable. The feedback loop, where the forward path is a rational function and the return path is a dissipative infinite dimensional system, remains the same in all cases. The stability is then analyzed, using the Nyquist criterion, in a <b>straight</b> <b>forward</b> manner. <b>Numerical</b> examples are given by MATLAB...|$|R

To alleviate the volumetric locking {{which may be}} encountered in nearly incompressible materials, a volumetric enhanced assumed strain (EAS) mode is incorporated in the eight-node and nine-node uniformly reduced-integrated (URI) elements. To control the compatible spurious zero energy mode in the 9 -node element, a stabilization matrix is attained by using a hybrid-strain formulation and, after some simplification, the matrix can be programmed in the element subroutine without resorting to <b>numerical</b> <b>integration.</b> <b>Numerical</b> examples show the relative efficacy of the proposed elements and other popular eight-node elements.

40|$|To tackle complex problems, {{engineers}} have increasingly looked to natural processes and creatures, as models and metaphors, for inspiration. Darwinian evolution and social group behavior, two instances of optimization mechanisms in nature, have inspired {{the two main}} families of nature-inspired intelligent computing algorithms, i. e. evolutionary and swarm algorithms. Although both families of algorithms are generally applied towards search and optimization problems, {{each has its own}} distinguishing features. In this dissertation, a genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimizer, instances of each main family of nature-inspired intelligent computing algorithms, are implemented to optimize heat transfer devices such as heat sinks and compact heat exchangers. These optimization methods are ideal for obtaining optimal designs of the constrained, multi-parameter, multi-objective, and multi-model complex optimization problems faced by heat transfer device engineers. However, the primary hurdle facing designers of such heat transfer devices, which has precluded the use of these optimization methods, is the significant computational costs of performing direct numerical simulations (DNS), i. e. with CFD, of the flow and heat transfer in such heterogeneous (and porous), hierarchical devices with conjugate effects included and flow often in the turbulent regime. This makes device simulations very costly and population-based optimization nearly impossible, which has resulted in most designs being based on ad hoc considerations, resulting in constrained performance, and thus accumulating financial losses for those manufacturing and operating the devices, and troubling environmental effects, i. e. excessive carbon emissions and thermal pollution, due to the accompanying energy losses. Breakthroughs {{in the past few decades}} in the modeling of transport phenomena in heterogeneous media with Volume Averaging Theory (VAT) have allowed engineers to fully simulate flow and heat transfer in thermal devices in mere seconds on a modern laptop, in comparison with the many hours it takes to do so with CFD, paving the way to thorough optimization studies of the multi-parameter devices. VAT is a hierarchical modeling method in which the lower-scale governing equations are the Navier-Stokes and thermal energy equations in the fluid and solid phases, and the upper-scale governing equations are the VAT-based mass, momentum, and fluid and solid thermal energy transport equations. The two sets of equations are rigorously connected by mathematical scaling (i. e. averaging) procedures and the result of such a model allows a nonlocal description of transport phenomena in heterogeneous thermal devices, with the morphology directly incorporated into the field equations and conjugate effects fully treated. The upper-scale VAT-based governing equations in hierarchical and heterogeneous media are complicated and at first formidable, yielding additional integral and differential terms when compared to the transport equations in homogeneous media. Understanding these additional terms led to them being directly related to the local transport coefficients, i. e. heat transfer coefficient and drag coefficient, providing a rigorous yet intuitive method of closure to the complicated integro-differential equations, and yielding simple differential equations that are quickly solved with <b>straight</b> <b>forward</b> <b>numerical</b> methods. Closure of the VAT-based equations can be obtained either theoretically, numerically, or experimentally, and past work has focused on numerical methods (i. e. CFD). In this work novel experimental methods for obtaining closure are explored, developed, and then implemented for several surfaces. With the VAT equations closed, rapid simulations can be performed, and thus the nature-inspired optimization methods can be exploited to guide the design to its optimal configuration...|$|R
