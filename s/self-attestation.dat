40|$|An {{intellectual}} sensor module of soil light-color control {{designed for}} an accurate agriculture technology which comprises functions of self-diagnostics, self-corrections and <b>self-attestation.</b> Circuit diagrams sensor module components {{have been developed}} {{on the basis of}} a micro-controller, a photo-diode driver, an interface integrated circuit and a receiving block of optical pulses. An algorithm and an operational program of a microcontroller have been devised for executing control over light pulses, processing of  photoelectric receptor signals, data receive-transmit operations, correction of sensitive elements, diagnostics of system failure and attestation of control results...|$|E
40|$|The paper aims {{to explain}} how Paul Ricœur’s phenomenological and {{hermeneutic}} approach offers an original theory of the self as <b>self-attestation.</b> Considering useful an approach that combines the psychological uses {{of the notion of}} self with a reflection on one’s capacity to design himself/herself as a person, the paper offers a thorough analysis of Ricœur’s work Soi-même comme un autre / Oneself as Another. The main purpose of this analysis is to highlight that, drawing a clear distinction between two forms of identity (la mêmeté/sameness and l’ipséité/selfhood) and proposing a dialectic between the self and the other, Ricœur grounds his theory on a notion of self which includes one’s acceptance of the other...|$|E

This WD Letter provides Boards with the following updates: • Information on Senate Bill (SB) 431, enacted by the 82 nd Texas Legislature, Regular Session (2011), which mandates criminal penalties for falsifying military records {{in order to receive}} priority of service; and • New Sample <b>Self-Attestation</b> Form (Attachment 1), which includes a statement regarding criminal penalties under SB 431. Additionally, information on priority of service for foster youth is now se...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{deals with the}} mostly {{negative}} image of Tatars, which - despite the regionally limited German-Tatarian integration (Baltikum, Dobrudja) - was a narrative in the cultural memory of the Germans and experienced a tentative change only in the 20 th century. It shows how the recent development of the Tatar image is based on historical constants of imagined foreign and <b>self-attestations.</b> These questions are investigated by means of researches on the Tatar picture of the Germans in Central Europe as 'remote' neighbors of the Tatars. Tatar images {{are taken into account}} in German literature, in the area of onomastics and in the cultural history (secondary stereotypes) ...|$|R
40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (DRA) included a provision that requires states to obtain documentary evidence of U. S. citizenship or nationality when determining eligibility of Medicaid applicants and current beneficiaries; <b>self-attestation</b> of citizenship and nationality is no longer acceptable. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) issued regulations states must follow in obtaining this documentation. Interested parties have raised concerns that efforts {{to comply with the}} requirement will cause eligible citizens to lose access to Medicaid coverage and will be costly for states to implement. GAO was asked to examine how the requirement has affected individuals' access to Medicaid benefits and assess the administrative and fiscal effects of implementing the requirement. To do this work, GAO surveyed state Medicaid offices in the 50 states and the District of Columbia about their perspectives on access issues and the administrative and fiscal effects of the requirement. GAO obtained complete responses from 44 states representing 71 percent of national Medicaid enrollment in fiscal year 2004. GAO also reviewed federal laws, regulations, and CMS guidance. ...|$|E
