5|$|Three weeks later, on Raw, Vince McMahon signed another {{handicap}} match pitting the Spirit Squad against Shawn Michaels. The match never started, however, {{because the}} Spirit Squad attacked Michaels, ripping apart his ring attire and, in storyline, shattering his knee with a steel chair. McMahon then called Triple H {{to the ring}} to attack Michaels with a sledgehammer, however, Kenny <b>snatched</b> <b>the</b> sledgehammer away, disrespecting Triple H, which led to him attacking the group.|$|E
5|$|Three weeks later, McMahon {{scheduled}} another handicap match, with The Spirit Squad facing Michaels. The match never started, however; instead The Spirit Squad attacked Michaels, ripping apart {{his ring}} attire and, {{as part of}} the storyline, shattering his knee with a steel chair. McMahon then called Triple H to the ring to attack Michaels with a sledgehammer; however, Kenny <b>snatched</b> <b>the</b> sledgehammer away, disrespecting Triple H, which led to him attacking the group. Triple H and Michaels revived D-Generation X (DX), since their teased reunion in 2002, and as a team began a feud with the Spirit Squad. DX played various sophomoric pranks on the team and the McMahons (Vince and Shane), as well as defeating The Spirit Squad in handicap matches at Vengeance and a clean sweep in an elimination handicap match at Saturday Night's Main Event.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the second}} half, no substitutions {{were made by}} either teams as Galatasaray kicked-off the match. During the third minute, Vieira picked Parlour, but his shot hit {{the outside of the}} goal. Galatasaray almost scored the opening goal, when Okan Buruk played in Hakan Şükür, whose shot hit the right post. Arsenal {{attempted}} to strike, with Sylvinho passing Hagi, and finding Henry, who in turn put in a cross for Keown, only for his shot to go over. Later throughout the match, Parlour sent a long ball into the Galatasaray midfield, but no Arsenal player was there to pick up the ball. A free-kick was given to Bergkamp after a foul on Overmars, which was cleared with a Popescu header. Galatasaray attempted an attack on the counter – Capone gave the ball to Hagi, who lost his balance while preparing to take a shot. After receiving a pass, Hagi put in a wide cross for Şükür, but he was denied a shot on target after a clearance. Arsenal had another chance, when Henry <b>snatched</b> <b>the</b> ball from Korkmaz, and entered the penalty area, only to see his shot to go off target.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>snatch</b> is <b>the</b> {{first of}} two lifts contested in the sport of weightlifting (also known as Olympic weightlifting) {{followed}} by the clean and jerk. The objective of <b>the</b> <b>snatch</b> is to lift the barbell from the ground to overhead in one continuous motion. There are four main styles of snatch used: squat snatch (or full snatch), split snatch, power snatch, and muscle <b>snatch.</b> <b>The</b> squat <b>snatch</b> and split <b>snatch</b> are <b>the</b> most common styles used in competition while power snatch and muscle snatch are mostly used for training purposes. In <b>the</b> squat <b>snatch,</b> <b>the</b> lifter lifts the bar as high as possible and pulls themselves under it in a squat position, receiving the bar overhead with the arms straight, decreasing the necessary height of the bar, therefore {{increasing the amount of}} weight that the lifter may successfully lift. In <b>the</b> split <b>snatch,</b> <b>the</b> lifter lifts the bar as high as possible and pulls themselves under the bar similar to <b>the</b> squat <b>snatch</b> but in <b>the</b> split <b>snatch</b> <b>the</b> lifter [...] "splits" [...] his legs, placing {{one foot in front of}} them and one behind, allowing themselves to receive the bar lower as in <b>the</b> squat <b>snatch.</b> <b>The</b> split <b>snatch</b> has become much less common with the increased popularity of <b>the</b> squat <b>snatch</b> but is occasionally performed by some lifters. In <b>the</b> power <b>snatch,</b> <b>the</b> lifter lifts the barbell as high as possible and receives the bar overhead with only a slight bend in the knee and hip, increasing the height that the bar must be lifted and decreasing the amount of weight that may be successfully lifted. In <b>the</b> muscle <b>snatch,</b> <b>the</b> lifter lifts the bar all the way overhead with arms locked out and the hip and knee fully extended.|$|R

5|$|Martin Keown {{took care}} of the free-kick which Popescu unsuccessfully {{attempted}} to clear, only to give Overmars a shot on goal, a volley which went over. One minute later, Galatasaray's first opportunity came when Erdem received a straight ball from a Hagi taken free–kick, and took a shot on goal, which goalkeeper David Seaman managed to keep out with his left hand for a corner. The corner was taken, but no Galatasaray player was available to direct the ball towards the goal. Arsenal would create more opportunities into the match, when Sylvinho <b>snatched</b> <b>the</b> ball from Hagi and ran down to Galatasaray's left, before putting in a cross to the running Henry, who was halted by a clearance from Bülent Korkmaz. As Galatasaray grew more into the game minute, Erdem exchanged passes with Şükür, whose bicycle kick went completely off target. Arsenal began creating more chances – in the 35th minute, Overmars made a low powerful shot on goal, forcing Cláudio Taffarel to make a diving save. Overmars then made another run into the area but his attempt went across the goal. Galatasaray nearly took the lead with only two minutes of the first half remaining, when Şükür found Erdem, who beat the offside trap. However, his shot went just wide.|$|E
5|$|The electors of Cardinal Rolando, {{immediately}} after proclaiming him Pope, attempted to place upon him the purple mantle which symbolized {{the assumption of}} the papal office, but then the election entered the tumultuous stage. Cardinal Ottaviano Monticelli <b>snatched</b> <b>the</b> mantle from Alexander’s back and his armed bands burst into the basilica. Alexander III and his supporters fled to the citadel of St. Peter, {{which was in the}} hands of Cardinal Boso. In their absence, the few cardinals who remained in basilica elected Ottaviano of S. Cecilia to the papacy and enthroned him as Victor IV. The exact number of his electors is not known, but there are good reasons to believe that it amounted six, including Ottaviano himself, since only five cardinals signed the manifest in his favour in the following month. However, it is possible that some additional cardinals participated in the election of Victor IV but very quickly joined the obedience Alexander III.|$|E
25|$|Henry {{is said to}} have disliked {{his younger}} brother, Charles, and to have teased him, {{although}} this derives from only one anecdote: when Charles was nine years of age, Henry <b>snatched</b> <b>the</b> hat off a bishop {{and put it on the}} younger child's head, then told his younger brother that when he became king he would make Charles Archbishop of Canterbury, and then Charles would have a long robe to hide his ugly rickety legs. Charles stamped on the cap and had to be dragged off in tears.|$|E

25|$|Valverde grabbed three stage {{victories}} in the Volta a Catalunya. On stage 2, he {{got the better of}} a bunch sprint and helped score a 1-2 for Movistar with his teammate José Joaquín Rojas. On stage 5, he launched a late attack as he was part of a small group containing all the leaders coming into Valls and won solo. On the last stage, he won the sprint of a group of about 40 riders and with the bonus seconds, <b>snatched</b> <b>the</b> second place of the overall classification from Domenico Pozzovivo. At the Amstel Gold Race he came in second, being bested in a small group sprint by Michał Kwiatkowski. The following Wednesday, Valverde equalled the record number of victories on La Flèche Wallonne with 3, distancing Julian Alaphilippe and Michael Albasini in the final meters of the Mur de Huy.|$|E
25|$|Warne had an undistinguished Test debut {{when called}} into the Australian team in January 1992 for a Test against India at the Sydney Cricket Ground. He took 1/150 (Ravi Shastri caught by Dean Jones for 206) off 45 overs. He took 0/78 in the fourth Test in Adelaide, {{recording}} overall figures of 1/228 for the series, and was dropped for the fifth Test on the pace-friendly WACA Ground in Perth. His poor form continued in the first innings against Sri Lanka at Colombo, in which he recorded 0/107. However, on 22 August 1992, he took the last three Sri Lankan wickets without conceding a run in the second innings precipitating a second innings collapse and contributing to a remarkable 16-run Australian win. Sri Lankan captain Arjuna Ranatunga commented in an interview that, 'a bowler with Test average of more than 300 came and <b>snatched</b> <b>the</b> victory from our hands'.|$|E
25|$|In Greek mythology, Aquarius is {{sometimes}} associated with Deucalion, {{the son of}} Prometheus who built a ship with his wife Pyrrha to survive an imminent flood. They sailed for nine days before washing ashore on Mount Parnassus. Aquarius is also sometimes identified with beautiful Ganymede, a youth in Greek mythology {{and the son of}} Trojan king Tros, who was taken to Mount Olympus by Zeus to act as cup-carrier to the gods. Neighboring Aquila represents the eagle, under Zeus' command, that <b>snatched</b> <b>the</b> young boy; some versions of the myth indicate that the eagle was in fact Zeus transformed. An alternative version of the tale recounts Ganymede's kidnapping by the goddess of the dawn, Eos, motivated by her affection for young men; Zeus then stole him from Eos and employed him as cup-bearer. Yet another figure associated with the water bearer is Cecrops I, a king of Athens who sacrificed water instead of wine to the gods.|$|E

500|$|In a 2015 {{interview}} Igor Kirillov, {{the senior}} Soviet news anchor, {{said that he}} was initially given a printed TASS report to announce over the news on September 1, which included an [...] "open and honest" [...] admission that the plane was shot down by mistake (a wrong judgement call by the Far Eastern Air Defence Command). However, at the moment the opening credits of the Vremya evening news programme rolled in, an editor ran in and <b>snatched</b> <b>the</b> sheet of paper from his hand, handing him another TASS report which was [...] "completely opposite" [...] to the first one and to the truth.|$|E

500|$|Custine also {{recognized}} and recruited talented officers. At {{the surrender of}} the garrison at Mainz, he offered the Mainz commander, Rudolf Eickemeyer, a colonel's commission {{to serve in the}} French army. By 1793, Eickemeyer had been promoted to brigadier general; he served in the Upper Rhine campaigns and the Rhine Campaign of 1796. During this campaign, he also acquired the services of a young officer, Laurent Gouvion, later known as Laurent de Gouvion Saint-Cyr. [...] According to Antoine Marie Chamans, he acquired Saint Cyr's services in an unusual way, indicative of Custine's temperament and personality. In a break in action, Gouvion was sketching the countryside, including the enemy positions near Eckheim, in the vicinity of Mainz, when Custine saw him from a distance. Not approving of his occupation, Custine galloped to him, <b>snatched</b> <b>the</b> paper from his hand, and angrily asked what he was doing. Upon noticing that Gouvion's drawing closely matched the positions, he assigned the young officer to his own staff.|$|E

The London fence arrives with the payoff, after which Tony leaves to single-handedly rescue the child by force, advising Jo {{it is the}} only way they will see him alive. [...] With Mado's help he tracks Tonio down at Grutter's country house and kills Grutter's {{brothers}} Rémy and Louis while rescuing him. On the way back to Paris, Tony learns Jo has cracked under the pressure and agreed to meet Grutter at his house with the money.

500|$|John Roebling was a {{contrasting}} {{character to}} Charles Ellet. [...] Whereas Ellet embellished his proposals with fanciful words and deeds, Roebling presented papers filled with meticulous calculations and drawings. [...] The elder engineer was stern and driven to achieve, taking a scientific approach to all interests. [...] Rarely did he show emotions in his dealings, even to his closest associates. [...] The man, however, dared to confront his detractors and make bold exaltations about his work. [...] He openly called European suspension bridges—including American suspension bridges built with European techniques—weak, and occasionally sniped at Ellet's and Stephenson's works. [...] He announced that his Brooklyn Bridge, when completed, [...] "will {{not only be}} the greatest bridge in existence, {{but it will be}} the greatest engineering work of this continent, and of the age." [...] Roebling's history with Ellet started before the bidding for the Niagara Suspension Bridge, early in their careers. [...] During the bidding for the Schuylkill Suspension Bridge project, Ellet had written a proposal that was published in the American Railroad Journal. [...] Mistakenly believing Ellet had won the contract, Roebling wrote to offer his congratulations and requested to be Ellet's assistant. [...] He received a formal reply without any reference to his request, and his subsequent letter was ignored. [...] When Roebling learned that a contractor had won the bid, he successfully applied to be the contractor's chief engineer. [...] Ellet, however, persisted with his tactics and <b>snatched</b> <b>the</b> project away from the contractor; he promoted himself to the bridge company and offered to accept land instead of cash as payment. [...] From then on, Ellet and Roebling became rivals, vying with each other for suspension bridge projects in North America. [...] Roebling learned from their rivalry. [...] His losses to Ellet showed him that he needed to promote himself and gain backers to effectively secure the contracts he desired.|$|E
