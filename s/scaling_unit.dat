Multi-instances horizontal scaling is the common scalability architecture in Cloud; however, its cur-rent implementation is coarse-grained, while it considers Virtual Machine (VM) as a <b>scaling</b> <b>unit,</b> this implies additional scaling-out overhead and limits it to specific applications. To overcome these limitations, we pro-pose Elastic VM as a fine-grained vertical scaling architecture. Our re-sults proved that Elastic VM architecture implies less consumption of re-sources, mitigates Service Level Objectives (SLOs) violation, and avoids scaling-up overhead. Furthermore, it scales broader range of applications including databases. Key words: virtualization, elasticity, auto-scaling, cloud computing...|$|E

This report presents architecture of CORDIC, embedded with a <b>scaling</b> <b>unit</b> that has only minimal number of adders and shifters. It can be implemented in rotation mode as well as vectoring mode. The purpose of the design is to get a scaling free CORDIC unit preserving the design of original algorithm. The proposed design has a considerable reduction in hardware when compared with other scaling free architectures. The analysis of error for different word lengths and different input ranges for fixed word length gives a better choice to choose the parameters. The error in rotation mode for 16 bit data path, obtained for Y equivalent input is 0. 073 % and for X equivalent input is 0. 067 %.

40|$|The FFT {{processor}} {{serves as}} one of core components in numerous DSP-based systems, such as OFDM in modern wireless communication. While creating an FFT processor, key parameters, such as architecture, wordlength, and number format, must be all considered very carefully. In this paper, we propose an optimization flow that properly scales fixed-point numeric values at each butterfly stage to maximize the output SQNR under a fixed wordlength constraint. The proposed flow utilizes probability distribution to model the probabilistic behavior of the output signal at each stage. The computation errors due to quantization and saturation operations are statically analyzed before making scaling decisions. Therefore, without a need of time-consuming simulation, our method can efficiently determine the most appropriate number format for each stage and thus optimize the overall output SQNR. Besides, the proposed flow is capable of handling various FFT sizes, FFT algorithms, wordlengths, and input signal distributions. Experimental {{results indicate that the}} wordlength can be reduced about three bits for an 8 K-point radix- 2 memory-based FFT processor without compromise in the output SQNR. Furthermore, the FFT processor created using our static scaling optimization technique can produce a comparable output quality as the one equipped with an extra dynamic number <b>scaling</b> <b>unit,</b> which requires significantly more hardware logic...|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} an initial effort to {{estimate}} one important {{category of benefits}} of environmental improvements in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE), those related {{to the effects of}} air pollution on human health. Our estimates are derived from data on ambient air quality in selected CEE locations, together with a model that links these ambient conditions to physical impacts on health and attaches economic values (in dollar terms) to these impacts. Given data limitations, our focus here is on three pollutants: particulates (PM), sulfur dioxide (SO 2), and lead (Pb). Our data set includes ambient concentrations for these pollutants in four CEE countries: Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, and Ukraine. Given the ambient data, dose-response functions taken from the clinical and epidemiological literature in the U. S., Canada, and Western Europe are used to generate estimates of the change in physical effects. These effects then are given an economic value by applying two approaches for <b>scaling</b> <b>unit</b> valuation figures applicable to the U. S. A Monte Carlo model is constructed to propagate the uncertainties of the dose-response functions and unit values to obtain confidence intervals on the total benefits from pollutant reductions in each country. We examine scenarios where the CEE countries improve ambient conditions for the pollutants in question to meet European Community (EC) standards and then compare these scenarios to ones involving uniform percentage ambient reductions across locations in each country.

Materials and Methods: A total of 30 subjects {{with a combination of}} 17 males and 13 females with the chronic generalized gingivitis with a minimum calculus score of 1 (CSSI - Ennever J 1961) who reported to Department of Periodontics, Yenepoya Dental College, Mangalore were chosen for the study. Ultrasonic magnetostrictive scaler unit CAVITRON BOBCAT PRO ® - (DENTSPLY) with maximum power setting at 130 A and 25 kHZ frequency with 2 different inserts i. e., Slim line insert and Focus spray (DENTSPLY) were used for supragingival scaling in the study. A VRS was used to assess the subjective intensity of pain. Results: There was no statistically significant difference in pain perception when the scores were compared using Wilcoxon signed rank test. VRS rating scores with slimline inserts showed a pain intensity of 2 in 43. 3 %, 1 in 53. 3 % and 0 in 3. 3 %, whereas the focus spray insert showed a pain intensity of 1 in 23. 3 % and 0 in 76. 7 %.

40|$|Untargeted {{metabolomic}} studies generate information-rich, high-dimensional, {{and complex}} datasets that remain challenging to handle and fully exploit. Despite the remarkable {{progress in the}} development of tools and algorithms, the “exhaustive” extraction of information from these metabolomic datasets is still a non-trivial undertaking. A conversation on data mining strategies for a maximal information extraction from metabolomic data is needed. Using a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) -based untargeted metabolomic dataset, this study explored the influence of collection parameters in the data pre-processing step, scaling and data transformation on the statistical models generated, and feature selection, thereafter. Data obtained in positive mode generated from a LC-MS-based untargeted metabolomic study (sorghum plants responding dynamically to infection by a fungal pathogen) were used. Raw data were pre-processed with MarkerLynxTM software (Waters Corporation, Manchester, UK). Here, two parameters were varied: the intensity threshold (50 – 100 counts) and the mass tolerance (0. 005 – 0. 01 Da). After the pre-processing, the datasets were imported into SIMCA (Umetrics, Umea, Sweden) for more data cleaning and statistical modeling. In addition, different <b>scaling</b> (<b>unit</b> variance, Pareto, etc.) and data transformation (log and power) methods were explored. The results showed that the pre-processing parameters (or algorithms) influence the output dataset with regard to the number of defined features. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that the pre-treatment of data prior to statistical modeling affects the subspace approximation outcome: e. g., the amount of variation in X-data that the model can explain and predict. The pre-processing and pre-treatment steps subsequently influence the number of statistically significant extracted/selected features (variables). Thus, as informed by the results, to maximize the value of untargeted metabolomic data, understanding of the data structures and exploration of different algorithms and methods (at different steps of the data analysis pipeline) might be the best trade-off, currently, and possibly an epistemological imperative...|$|E

40|$|Precirculated abstract. In 1888 - 9, E. H. Weber {{discovered}} one of {{the first}} basic principles of Experimental Psychology: equal ratios of the quantity of stimulation to the senses were rated as equally different in intensity, when the levels of input were moderate. This semilog linear range of an input/output function for physical or chemical stimuli is plain linear when the stimuli are symbolic such as quantitative descriptions. This discriminative sensitivity of an output can therefore be used as a <b>scaling</b> <b>unit</b> for quantities of any input. Furthermore, inputs that are treated as the same by an output will summate in discrimination units from the level to which the person or animal has learnt: that is, an information-transmitting channel through an adapted intelligent system constitutes a mental dimension. If two transforms operate over different channels, then their interaction is orthogonal. Hence the simplest account of a mind is as a Euclidean hyperspace of distinct causal processes. When two outputs are observed from one input, two distinct ways of processing the input may be distinguished. With sufficiently independent multiple inputs tested on specific outputs as well as on an overall output of interest, the set of possible processes and their interactions can be tested against each other on the individual’s multiple discrimination performance in acting on variants of a specific situation (Booth & Freeman, 1993; data-analytic program in Java: ‘Co-Pro’, 2006).
