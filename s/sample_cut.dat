After selecting the original sample of PSUs, a number of selected PSUs were cut from the sample for budgetary reasons. However, the deletion process did not use an explicit probability mechanism in some cases. Consequently, it was of interest to develop weighting-adjustment methods that provide some degree of robustness against potential bias.

All pigs, fed the same commercial diets, were weighed and measured periodically and were slaughtered at a target live weight of 150 kg. Indoor-pigs grew faster than the outdoor ones and crossbred pigs showed higher average daily gain than CS breed (476, 437 and 387 g/d for IDxCS, ILWxCS and CS, respectively).

Subsequently, the simulated grain reorientation fields are compared to experimental measurements of the DC 04 sample after the tensile test at different deformation levels.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{measured}} the {{profiles of the}} trapped field, BT, on a thin Gd-Ba-Cu-O superconducting bulk plate with 45 mm in diameter and 2 mm in thickness magnetized by the pulsed field, where Gd-Ba-Cu-O consists of a superconducting matrix phase of GdBa 2 Cu 3 O 7 −δ and a nonsuperconducting secondary phase of Gd 2 BaCuO 5. The vortices were mainly trapped at the periphery in the growth sector regions (GSRs) for low applied fields, and around the growth sector boundaries (GSBs) and under the seed crystal (SC) position for high applied fields. The irreversibility line, which was determined from the resistivity measurements, of the <b>sample</b> <b>cut</b> from the GSR was rather {{lower than those of}} the samples cut from the GSBs and the SC position.

These are generally measured on a sample that is considered representative of the component. In the case of welded samples, the possibility of variation in weld shape between the d(0) sample and the area where stresses are determined {{must be taken into}} account. To assess this, d(0) values are measured on an area considered representative of the sample, and then are re-measured on a <b>sample</b> <b>cut</b> from the actual strain measurement plane. The residual stresses are re-calculated with these new d(0) values and the results compared to those based on the initial d(0) measurement. Methods of estimating these errors are discussed.
