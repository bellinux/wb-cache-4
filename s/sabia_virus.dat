50|$|Brazilian {{hemorrhagic fever}} (BzHF) is an {{infectious}} disease {{caused by the}} <b>Sabiá</b> <b>virus,</b> an Arenavirus. The <b>Sabiá</b> <b>virus</b> {{is one of the}} arenoviruses from South America to cause hemorrhagic fever. It shares a common progenitor with the Junin virus, Machupo virus, Tacaribe virus, and Guanarito virus. It is an enveloped RNA virus and is highly infectious and lethal.

40|$|International audienceTo date, the International Committee for Taxonomy of Viruses {{recognizes that}} the family {{contains}} a unique genus that includes 22 viral species. There are 9 additional arenaviruses that either have been discovered recently, or which taxonomic status remains pending. Arenaviruses have been classified according to their antigenic properties into two groups, the Lassa-Lymphocytic choriomeningitis (LCM) serocomplex and the Tacaribe serocomplex which has been further divided into four evolutionary lineages. Each arenavirus {{is more or less}} tightly associated with a mammal host. The distribution of the host dictates the distribution of the virus. Humans may become infected by arenaviruses through direct contact with infected rodents, including bites, or through inhalation of infectious rodent excreta and secreta. Lassa, Junin, Machupo, Guanarito, and <b>Sabia</b> <b>viruses</b> are known to cause a severe hemorrhagic fever, in western Africa, Argentina, Bolivia, Venezuela, and Brazil, respectively. Infection by LCM virus can result in acute central nervous system disease, congenital malformations, and infection in organ transplantation recipients. Detection of arenaviruses in their animal host can be achieved by virus isolation, and has recently taken advantage of PCR-based techniques. The approach based on consensus degenerate primers has shown efficient for both detection of known arenaviruses, and discovery of new arenaviruses...|$|R
40|$|Dystroglycan (-DG) {{has been}} {{identified}} as a major receptor for lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) and Lassa virus, two Old World arenaviruses. The situation with New World arenaviruses is less clear: previous studies demonstrated that Oliveros virus also exhibited high-affinity binding to -DG but that Guanarito virus did not. To extend these initial studies, several additional Old and New World arenaviruses were screened for entry into mouse embryonic stem cells possessing or lacking -DG. In addition, represen-tative viruses were further analyzed for direct binding to -DG by means of a virus overlay protein blot assay technique. These studies indicate that Old World arenaviruses use -DG as a major receptor, whereas, of the New World arenaviruses, only clade C viruses (i. e., Oliveros and Latino viruses) use -DG as a major receptor. New World clade A and B arenaviruses, which include the highly pathogenic Machupo, Guanarito, Junin, and <b>Sabia</b> <b>viruses,</b> appear to use a different receptor or coreceptor for binding. Previous studies with LCMV have suggested the need for a small aliphatic amino acid at LCMV GP 1 glycoprotein amino acid position 260 to allow high-affinity binding to -DG. As reported herein, this requirement appears to be broadly applicable to the arenaviruses as determined by more extensive analysis of -DG receptor usage and GP 1 sequences of Old and New World arenaviruses. In addition, GP 1 amino acid position 259 also appears to be important, since all arenaviruses showing high-affinity -DG binding possess a bulky aromatic amino acid (tyrosine or phenylal...|$|R

Molecular screening detected a new arenavirus in Natal multimammate mice (Mastomys natalensis), Morogoro virus, related to Mopeia virus. Only {{a small percentage of}} mice carry Morogoro virus, although a large proportion shows specifi c antibodies. Arenaviruses are segmented negative-strand RNA viruses. Their natural hosts are various rodent species. The virus family comprises several human pathogens causing hemorrhagic fever, namely Machupo, Guanarito, Junin, <b>Sabia,</b> and Chapare <b>viruses</b> in South America, and Lassa and Lujo viruses in Africa (1 – 3). In addition, Africa harbors arenaviruses that are not linked with human disease: Mobala, Ippy, Mopeia, and Kodoko viruses (4 – 7). We conducted a systematic search in wildlife in Tanzania to identify new African arenaviruses.

50|$|There {{have only}} been three {{documented}} infections of the <b>Sabiá</b> <b>virus,</b> only one of which occurred naturally {{and the other two}} cases occurred in the clinical setting. The only naturally occurring case was in 1990, when a female agricultural engineer who was staying in the neighborhood of Jardim Sabiá near São Paulo, Brazil contracted the disease. She presented with hemorrhagic fever and died. Her autopsy showed liver necrosis. A virologist who was studying the woman's disease contracted the virus but survived. Ribavirin was not given in these first two cases. Four years later, in 1994, a researcher was exposed to the virus in a level 3 biohazard facility at Yale University when a centrifuge bottle cracked, leaked, and released aerosolized virus particle. He was successfully treated with ribavirin.|$|E
50|$|An arenavirus is a virus {{which is}} a member of the family Arenaviridae. These viruses infect rodents and {{occasionally}} humans; arenaviruses have also been discovered which infect snakes. At least eight arenaviruses are known to cause human disease. The diseases derived from arenaviruses range in severity. Aseptic meningitis, a severe human disease that causes inflammation covering the brain and spinal cord, can arise from the Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection. Hemorrhagic fever syndromes are derived from infections such as Guanarito virus (GTOV), Junin virus (JUNV), Lassa virus (LASV), Lujo virus (LUJV), Machupo virus (MACV), <b>Sabia</b> <b>virus</b> (SABV), or Whitewater Arroyo virus (WWAV). Arenaviruses are divided into two groups: the Old World and the New World viruses. The differences between these groups are distinguished geographically and genetically. Because of the epidemiological association with rodents, some arenaviruses and bunyaviruses are designated as roboviruses.|$|E
50|$|Later {{that decade}} while at YARU, he characterised novel arboviruses from birds in Egypt. In 1969, his {{research}} turned to outbreaks of Lassa and yellow fever in Nigeria. The following year, with Frederick A. Murphy, he discovered Duvenhage, Lagos bat and Mokola viruses, {{which were the}} first viruses shown {{to be related to}} rabies. He characterised Thottapalayam virus, later shown to be the first hantavirus, from an Indian shrew in 1971. With Murphy and others, he discovered multiple viruses related to bluetongue, including bluetongue 20 virus, the first bluetongue-like virus from Australia. In the late 1970s, with Jim Meegan, he showed that Rift Valley fever virus - previously believed to be restricted to sub-Saharan Africa, and mainly to infect livestock - was the cause of an epidemic in Egypt in which around 200,000 people were infected. With Allan Steer, {{he was the first to}} describe Lyme disease, a tick-borne bacterial disease, in the US. He subsequently worked on viral hemorrhagic fevers, discovering <b>Sabiá</b> and Guanarito <b>viruses,</b> the causative agents of Brazilian and Venezuelan hemorrhagic fevers. He also researched dengue and its vaccines.|$|R
40|$|The family Arenaviridae, genus Arenavirus, {{consists}} of two phylogenetically independent groups: Old World (OW) and New World (NW) complexes. The Lassa and Lujo viruses in the OW complex and the Guanarito, Junin, Machupo, <b>Sabia,</b> and Chapare <b>viruses</b> in the NW complex cause viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF) in humans, leading to serious public health concerns. These viruses are also considered potential bioterrorism agents. Therefore, it is of great importance to detect these pathogens rapidly and specifically {{in order to minimize}} the risk and scale of arenavirus outbreaks. However, these arenaviruses are classified as BSL- 4 pathogens, thus making it difficult to develop diagnostic techniques for these virus infections in institutes without BSL- 4 facilities. To overcome these difficulties, antibody detection systems {{in the form of an}} enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and an indirect immunofluorescence assay were developed using recombinant nucleoproteins (rNPs) derived from these viruses. Furthermore, several antigen-detection assays were developed. For example, novel monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to the rNPs of Lassa and Junin viruses were generated. Sandwich antigen-capture (Ag-capture) ELISAs using these mAbs as capture antibodies were developed and confirmed to be sensitive and specific for detecting the respective arenavirus NPs. These rNP-based assays were proposed to be useful not only for an etiological diagnosis of VHFs, but also for seroepidemiological studies on VHFs. We recently developed arenavirus neutralization assays using vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) -based pseudotypes bearing arenavirus recombinant glycoproteins. The goal of this article is to review the recent advances in developing laboratory diagnostic assays based on recombinant viral proteins for the diagnosis of VHFs and epidemiological studies on the VHFs caused by&nbsp;arenaviruses...|$|R

40|$|<b>Sabia</b> <b>virus</b> Glycoprotein G 1 (GP 1) is a {{peripheral}} membrane protein involved in viral adsorption and consequential pathogenic infection. Glycoprotein G 1 (GP 1) {{was subjected to}} immunoformatic and molecular simulation study to predict effective B-cell and T-cell epitopes with knowledge-based exploration of probable immunological responses the epitopes may elicit. The linear and conformational epitopes of GP 1 for B-cell were predicted by immunoformatic tools housed in IEDB recourse. Both CD 4 + and CD 8 + T-cell epitopes were predicted exploiting IEDB recourse tools whereas CD 8 + T cell epitopes were severed further by immune response evoking ability of epitope-MHC complex. Contribution of GP 1 to innate antiviral response was evolved by interferon (IFN) -gamma inducing and imitation capacity by immunoformatic and docking study respectively. The results of the B-cell epitope analysis suggest the occurrence of potential linear and conformational epitope with cross-reactivity. A range of T-cell epitopes were assumed {{to be involved in}} MHC class I and MHC class II molecule dependent antigen presentation. Glycoprotein G 1 (GP 1) may induce the IFN-gamma but its IFN-gamma mimicking ability (confirmed by docking study) that adduces a prompt immune defense.

40|$|Members of the Arenaviridae {{family have}} been {{isolated}} from mammalian hosts in disparate geographic locations, leading to their grouping as Old World types (i. e., {{lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus}} [LCMV], Lassa fever virus [LFV], Mopeia virus, and Mobala virus) and New World types (i. e., Junin, Machupo, Tacaribe, and Sabia viruses) (C. J. Peters, M. J. Buchmeier, P. E. Rollin, and T. G. Ksiazek, p. 1521 – 1551, in B. N. Fields, D. M. Knipe, and P. M. Howley [ed. ], Fields virology, 3 rd ed., 1996; P. J.

Several types in both groups—LFV, Junin, Machupo, and Sabia viruses—cause severe and often lethal human diseases. By sequence comparison, we noted that eight Old World and New World arenaviruses share several amino acids with the nucleoprotein (NP) that consists of amino acids (aa) 118 to 126 (NP 118 – 126) (RPQASGVYM) of LCMV that comprise the immunodominant cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) epitope for H- 2 d mice (32).

In this study, we produced three monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to the recombinant nucleocapsid protein of JUNV, designated C 6 - 9, C 11 - 12, and E 4 - 2. The specificity of these MAbs was examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), indirect immunofluorescence assay, and an epitope-mapping method.

30|$|Lassa virus (LASV) {{belongs to}} the Mammarenavirus genus, Arenaviridae family. Arenaviruses are {{classified}} into two main groups—Old World (OW) and New World (NW)—based on virus genetics, serology, antigenic properties and geographical relationships. The OW LASV and Lujo virus (LUJV), as well as NW Junín virus (JUNV), Machupo virus (MACV), Guanarito virus (GTOV), <b>Sabiá</b> <b>virus</b> (SABV) and Chapare virus (CHAPV), are known to cause severe hemorrhagic fever and are listed as biosafety level 4 (BSL- 4) agents. The arenavirus glycoprotein complex (GPC) contains three subunits—the retained stable-signal peptide (SSP), the receptor-binding subunit GP 1, and the membrane fusion subunit GP 2 (Lenz et al., 2001). Notably, the proximate external membrane region and TM of GP 2, together with the ectodomain loop and TMs of SSP, form an SSP-GP 2 interface, playing essential roles in regulating membrane fusion, and providing targets for distinct fusion inhibitors (Larson et al., 2008; Lee et al., 2008; York et al., 2008; York and Nunberg, 2009; Thomas et al., 2011; Burgeson et al., 2013 a; Shankar et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2018).|$|E
40|$|Viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHFs) are a {{group of}} {{infectious}} diseases with similar symptoms in people; the causative viruses affect the vascular system and can produce a severe multisystemic illness in some patients. Arenaviruses known to cause VHF include Lassa virus (Lassa fever), Junin virus (Argentine hemorrhagic fever), Machupo and Chapare viruses (Bolivian hemorrhagic fever), Guanarito virus (Venezuelan hemorrhagic fever), <b>Sabia</b> <b>virus</b> and Lujo virus. Some of the causative arenaviruses have probably not been identified yet; the South American arenaviruses emerged as agents of VHF within the last 60 years, and Lujo virus was discovered in Africa in 2008. Arenavirus-associated VHFs are zoonotic diseases, with humans acting as accidental hosts. The viruses are carried in asymptomatic animal reservoirs, typically rodents. Nonhuman primates can be experimentally infected, {{but there is no}} evidence that these viruses are pathogenic in livestock, cats or dogs. In humans, the illness may be mild to severe or fatal.

40|$|Guanarito virus (GTOV) is an {{emergent}} {{and deadly}} pathogen. We present the crystal {{structure of the}} glycosylated GTOV fusion glycoprotein to 4. 1 -Å resolution in the postfusion conformation. Our structure reveals a classical six-helix bundle and presents direct verification that New World arenaviruses exhibit class I viral membrane fusion machinery. The structure provides visual-ization of an N-linked glycocalyx coat, and consideration of glycan dynamics reveals extensive coverage of the underlying pro-tein surface, following virus-host membrane fusion. Guanarito virus (GTOV), first recognized in 1989, is the etio-logical agent of Venezuelan hemorrhagic fever (1). Human transmission of this highly virulent virus from rodent reservoirs probably occurs primarily through contamination of food stocks and dust particles (2, 3). Clinical manifestations include fever and malaise, which develop into hemorrhagic fever (HF) (4).

Our screening efforts resulted in the discovery of a series of novel small molecule inhibitors of viral entry that are highly active against both Old World and New World hemorrhagic arenaviruses. We observed potent inhibition of infection of human and primate cells with live hemorrhagic arenaviruses (IC 50 = 500 – 800 nm). Investigations of the mechanism of action revealed that the candidate compounds efficiently block pH-dependent fusion by the arenavirus GPs (IC 50 of 200 – 350 nm). Although our lead compounds were potent against phylogenetically distant arenaviruses, they did not show activity against other enveloped viruses with class I viral fusion proteins, indicating specificity for arenavirus GP-mediated membrane fusion...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Emerging {{infectious}} diseases are a global threat. In countries like Brazil, where biodiversity {{is high and}} public health conditions in terms of infrastructure and medical care are often precarious, emerging diseases are particularly worrisome. The lack of monitoring strategies to identify pathogens {{with the potential to}} cause outbreaks or epidemics is another problem in Brazil and other developing countries. In this article, we present the history of the <b>Sabiá</b> <b>virus</b> (SABV), a pathogen that was described in the 1990 s in Brazil. Several aspects of the biology and ecology of the SABV remain unknown. The SABV has the potential to cause hemorrhagic fever in humans. To date, four cases of human infections have been reported worldwide; two were naturally acquired (both in Brazil), whereas the other two were linked to occupational exposure in the laboratory environment (one in Brazil and one in the USA). In this review, we summarize the basic biological and ecological characteristics of the SABV. This is the first work to gather all available data on the historical aspects involving the cases of SABV infection along with an update on its characteristic features...|$|E
40|$|The virus family Arenaviridae {{includes}} several hemorrhagic fever causing agents such as Lassa, Guanarito, Junin, Machupo, and <b>Sabia</b> <b>virus</b> that pose {{a major public}} health concern to the human population in West African and South American countries. Current treatment options to control fatal outcome of disease are limited to the ribonucleoside analogue ribavirin, although its use has some significant limitations. The lack of effective treatment alternatives emphasizes the need for novel antiviral therapeutics to counteract these life-threatening infections. Maturation cleavage of the viral envelope glycoprotein by the host cell proprotein convertase site 1 protease (S 1 P) is critical for infectious virion production of several pathogenic arenaviruses. This finding makes this protease an attractive target {{for the development of}} novel anti-arenaviral therapeutics. We demonstrate here that highly selective S 1 P-adapted α 1 -antitrypsins have the potential to efficiently inhibit glycoprotein processing, which resulted in reduced Lassa virus replication. Our findings suggest that S 1 P should be considered as an antiviral target and that further optimization of modified α 1 -antitrypsins could lead to potent and specific S 1 P inhibitors with the potential for treatment of certain viral hemorrhagic fevers...|$|E
40|$|A small {{focus of}} hemorrhagic fever (HF) cases {{occurred}} near Cochabamba, Bolivia, in December 2003 and January 2004. Specimens were available from only one fatal case, {{which had a}} clinical course that included fever, headache, arthralgia, myalgia, and vomiting with subsequent deterioration and multiple hemorrhagic signs. A non-cytopathic virus was isolated from two of the patient serum samples, and identified as an arenavirus by IFA staining with a rabbit polyvalent antiserum raised against South American arenaviruses known {{to be associated with}} HF (Guanarito, Machupo, and Sabiá). RT-PCR analysis and subsequent analysis of the complete virus S and L RNA segment sequences identified the virus {{as a member of the}} New World Clade B arenaviruses, which includes all the pathogenic South American arenaviruses. The virus was shown to be most closely related to <b>Sabiá</b> <b>virus,</b> but with 26 % and 30 % nucleotide difference in the S and L segments, and 26 %, 28 %, 15 % and 22 % amino acid differences for the L, Z, N, and GP proteins, respectively, indicating the virus represents a newly discovered arenavirus, for which we propose the name Chapare virus.

40|$|Viral {{haemorrhagic}} fevers (VHF) {{caused by}} arenaviruses {{are among the}} most devastating emerging human diseases. The most important pathogen among the arenaviruses is Lassa virus (LASV), the causative agent of Lassa fever that is endemic to West Africa. On the South American continent, the New World arenavirus Junin virus (JUNV), Machupo (MACV), Guanarito (GTOV), and <b>Sabia</b> <b>virus</b> (SABV) have emerged as causative agents of severe VHFs. Clinical and experimental studies on arenavirus VHF have revealed a crucial role of the endothelium in their pathogenesis. However, in contrast to other VHFs, haemorrhages are not a salient feature of Lassa fever and fatal cases do not show overt destruction of vascular tissue. The functional alteration of the vascular endothelium that precede shock and death in fatal Lassa fever may be due to more subtle direct or indirect effects of the virus on endothelial cells. Haemorrhagic disease manifestations and vascular involvement are more pronounced in the VHF caused by the South American haemorrhagic fever viruses. Recent studies on JUNV revealed perturbation of specific endothelial cell function, including expression of cell adhesion molecules, coagulation factors, and vasoactive mediators as a consequence of productive viral infection. These studies provided first possible links to some of the vascular abnormalities observed in patients, however, their relevance in vivo remains to be investigated...|$|E
40|$|The retinoic acid-inducible gene I product (RIG-I) is a {{cellular}} sensor of RNA virus infection that regulates the cellular beta interferon (IFN-) response. The nucleoproteins (NP) of arenaviruses {{are reported to}} antagonize the IFN response by inhibiting interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF- 3). Here, we demonstrate that the Z proteins of four New World (NW) arenaviruses, Guanarito virus (GTOV), Junin virus (JUNV), Machupo virus (MAVC), and <b>Sabia</b> <b>virus</b> (SABV), bind to RIG-I, resulting in downregulation of the IFN- response. We show that expression of the four NW arenavirus Z proteins inhibits IFN- mRNA induction in A 549 cells in response to RNA bearing 5 phosphates (5 pppRNA). NW arenavirus Z proteins interact with RIG-I in coimmunoprecipitation studies and colocalize with RIG-I. Furthermore, expression of Z proteins interferes with the interaction between RIG-I and MAVS. Z expression also impedes the nuclear factor kappa light chain enhancer of activated B cells (NF-B) and IRF- 3 activation. Our results indicate that NW arenavirus Z proteins, but not Z protein of the Old World (OW) arenavirus lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) or Lassa virus, bind to RIG-I and inhibit downstream activation of the RIG-I signaling pathway, preventing the transcriptional induction of IFN-.

40|$|Several {{members of}} the Arenaviridae can cause acute febrile {{diseases}} in humans, often resulting in lethality. The use of convalescent-phase human plasma is an effective treatment in humans infected with arenaviruses, particularly species found in South America. Despite this, little work has focused on developing potent and defined immunotherapeutics against arenaviruses. In the present study, we produced arenavirus neutralizing antibodies by DNA vaccination of rabbits with plasmids encoding the full-length glycoprotein precursors of Junín virus (JUNV), Machupo virus (MACV), and Guanarito virus (GTOV). Geometric mean neutralizing antibody titers, {{as measured by the}} 50 % plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT 50), exceeded 5, 000 against homologous viruses. Antisera against each targeted virus exhibited limited cross-species binding and, to a lesser extent, cross-neutralization. Anti-JUNV glycoprotein rabbit antiserum protected Hartley guinea pigs from lethal intraperitoneal infection with JUNV strain Romero when the antiserum was administered 2 days after challenge and provided some protection (∼ 30 %) when administered 4 days after challenge. Treatment starting on day 6 did not protect animals. We further formulated an IgG antibody cocktail by combining anti-JUNV, -MACV, and -GTOV antibodies produced in DNA-vaccinated rabbits. This cocktail protected 100 % of guinea pigs against JUNV and GTOV lethal disease. We then expanded on this cocktail approach by simultaneously vaccinating rabbits with a combination of plasmids encoding glycoproteins from JUNV, MACV, GTOV, and <b>Sabia</b> <b>virus</b> (SABV). Sera collected from rabbits vaccinated with the combination vaccine neutralized all four targets.

Cellular immunity, chiefly the CD 8 + T-cell response, plays {{a critical role in}} providing protective immunity following infection with the Old World arenaviruses LASV and LCMV. In the current study, we evaluated whether HLA class I-restricted epitopes that are cross-reactive among pathogenic arenaviruses could be identified for the purpose of developing an epitope-based vaccination approach that would cross-protect against multiple arenaviruses. We were able to identify a panel of HLA-A* 0201 -restricted peptides derived from the same region of the glycoprotein precursor (GPC) of LASV (GPC spanning residues 441 to 449 [GPC 441 - 449]), LCMV (GPC 447 - 455), JUNV (GPC 429 - 437), MACV (GPC 444 - 452), GTOV (GPC 427 - 435), and WWAV (GPC 428 - 436) that displayed high-affinity binding to HLA-A* 0201 and were recognized by CD 8 + T cells in a cross-reactive manner following LCMV infection or peptide immunization of HLA-A* 0201 transgenic mice. Immunization of HLA-A* 0201 mice with the Old World peptide LASV GPC 441 - 449 or LCMV GPC 447 - 455 induced high-avidity CD 8 + T-cell responses that were able to kill syngeneic target cells pulsed with either LASV GPC 441 - 449 or LCMV GPC 447 - 455 in vivo and provided significant protection against viral challenge with LCMV.
