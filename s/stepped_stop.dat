40|$|Purpose. A {{quantitative}} analysis of biomechanical force {{interactions between the}} foot and the support when the athletes special tests. Material and methods. In the experiment involved 30 young athletes aged 7 - 8 years {{who are at the}} stage of initial training. Subjects performed four tests: jump up from their seats repulsion two feet, jump up and down with one foot repulsion run, <b>stop</b> <b>step,</b> jump <b>stop.</b> Results. As a result of studies to obtain quantitative values of reference indices interactions as the maximum reaction force impulse force, force gradient, the reference duration, and other interactions. Revealed that when jumping forward and upward to run and jump and <b>step</b> <b>stops</b> the horizontal component of force production is from 38 to 73 % of the resulting value. Conclusions. Significant power load on the musculoskeletal system and in particular the foot of young basketball players can lead to abnormalities in the foot.

2500|$|Malt extract is {{frequently}} {{used in the}} brewing of beer. Its production begins by germinating barley grain in {{a process known as}} malting, [...] immersing barley in water to encourage the grain to sprout, then drying the barley to halt the progress when the sprouting begins. The drying <b>step</b> <b>stops</b> the sprouting, but the enzymes remain active due to the low temperatures used in base malt production. In one before-and-after comparison, malting decreased barley's extractable starch content by about 7% on a dry matter basis, and turned that portion into various other carbohydrates.|$|R

This message {{plays a key role}} during pheromone diffusion, and as such, some properties need adjustment. In the route exploration period, once a node obtains new information of routes to the gateway, the node sends “keep-alive” messages to its neighbors. The time interval of the transmission of these messages must be more than 1 s. Each message carries information about five routes to the gateway at most. As this <b>step</b> <b>stops,</b> the properties of “keep-alive” message are reset to their default configuration.|$|R
