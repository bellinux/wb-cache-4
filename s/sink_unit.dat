Akishirome) plant by feeding 13 CO 2 and 15 NO 3. The plants were grown at two levels of nitrogen in the basal medium, i. e. low-N (2 g N m- 2) and high-N (35 g N m- 2) and a treatment of depodding was imposed by removing all the pods from the plant, except the pod of the source <b>sink</b> <b>unit,</b> 13 days after flowering. The plants at high-N accumulated more biomass in its organs compared to low-N and pod removal increased the weight of the vegetative organs. When the terminal leaflet of the source-sink unit was fed with 13 CO 2, almost all of the radioactive materials were retained inside the source-sink unit and translocation to rest of the plants was insignificant under any of the treatments imposed. Out of the 13 C exported by the terminal leaflet, less than half went into the axillary pod, as the lateral leaflets claimed equal share and very little material was deposited in the petiole. Pod removal decreased 13 C export at high-N, but not at low-N. Similar to 13 C, the source-sink unit retained all the 15 N fed to the terminal leaflet at high-N. At low-N, the major part of 15 N partitioning occurred in favour of the rest of the plant outside the source-sink unit, but removal of the competitive sinks from the rest of the plants nullified any partitioning outside the unit. Unlike the situation in 13 C, no partitioning of 15 N occurred in favour of the lateral leaflets from the terminal leaflet inside the unit. It is concluded that sink demand influences partitioning of both C and N and the translocation of carbon is different from that of nitrogen within a source-sink unit. The translocation of the N is more adjustive to a demand from other sink units compared to the C...|$|E
40|$|Electrical {{machines}} for aerospace applications often operate {{close to the}} allowable thermal limits due to high power density requirements. The power density of electrical machines is generally dependent on the machine and thermal management design. At flight level, a reduced pressure exists which in turn results in more challenging thermal management. Aerospace electric machine manufacturers are often limited {{with respect to the}} implemented cooling mechanisms. That is, natural convection systems are the norm, as fan cooled and fluid cooled machines may suffer from reliability issues. The original contribution of this work, is the design, testing, and implementation of an alternative forced cooling convective system (FCCS) based on piezoelectric fans. This thesis commences by an investigation of the capabilities of MotorCAD (a sophisticated analytical lumped thermal package) and how it can be utilised in a fully integrated way to optimise (for a maximum power density and an overall minimum motor mass) both the electromagnetic and thermal aspects of a typical traditional horizontally-mounted permanent magnet synchronous machine (PMSM) operating at flight level. The resultant analytical temperature values were then compared to actual experimental temperature data. Piezoelectric fans are then investigated as a potential, fault tolerant FCCS that may enhance the overall cooling of a motor. These fans could be implemented in the aerospace industry as they do not suffer from the same reliability issues as traditional FFCS’s. Detailed thermal results indicating the effective piezoelectric fan cooling range together with the overall cooling effectiveness over a traditional vertical straight-finned heat <b>sink</b> (<b>unit</b> – cell), operating under different operating conditions are also presented. Furthermore, the fin/fan geometry that minimises the thermal resistance whilst minimising the overall cooling mass is presented. Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) techniques were implemented to further understand the flow fields generated by an oscillating piezoelectric fan. Common parameters governing the fluid flow (vibration amplitude, separation distance, fin spacing and fan orientation) were investigated and the results are herewith presented. Designs of a supporting structure for the proposed FCCS implementation are drawn up and analysed through FEA. A prototype structure was built and its durability tested. Furthermore, the reliability (fault tolerance) of the suggested FCCS was evaluated. The feasibility of implementing this innovative cooling technique was further investigated by performing a study on the weight saving potential of the FCCS over traditional natural convective fins, and the FCCS geometry that minimises the thermal resistance whilst minimising the overall mass is selected. Furthermore, a prototype FCCS was built and tested. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

In 1983 he creates the monumental relief Extraterrestrial Dance (1983) using polispectral colored stainless steel. A new {{contact with the}} Norderstedt based printed circuit board manufacturer Heidemarie Heger of Heger GmbH then forms the foundation for many fine arts projects using specially manufactured printed circuit boards as design elements. Professor Dieter Kind, President of the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) in Braunschweig, helps Wandrey to acquire rejected elements from the «H 1» hydrogen maser atomic clock, which he assembles to form the sculpture Atomic Time Guardian (1988). Through Philips RHW, Wandrey is able to access large-format plotter-prints, diagrams of microchips for processor assemblies, which he uses in many of his art compositions. He also uses dual in-line package (DIP), wafers, electrical cables, etc. in many works mounted on stainless steel sheets or wood. In works such as the Jugglers triptych (1989) and Digitalistic Lesson (1989) he uses this hardware and rigorously robs it of its technological meaning by placing it in a purely artistic context.

40|$|The {{desire to}} have smaller and faster {{portable}} devices {{is one of the}} primary motivations for technology scaling. Though advancements in device physics are moving at a very good pace, they might not be aggressive enough for now-a-day technology scaling trends. As a result, the MOS devices used for present day integrated circuits are pushed to the limit in terms of performance, power consumption and robustness, which are the most critical criteria for almost all applications. Secondly, technology advancements have led to design of complex chips with increasing chip densities and higher operating speeds. The design of such high performance complex chips (microprocessors, digital signal processors, etc) has massively increased the power dissipation and, as a result, the operating temperatures of these integrated circuits. In addition, due to the aggressive technology scaling the heat withstanding capabilities of the circuits is reducing, thereby increasing the cost of packaging and heat <b>sink</b> <b>units.</b> This led to the increase in prominence for smarter and more robust low-power circuit and system designs. Apart from power consumption, another criterion affected by technology scaling is robustness of the design, particularly for critical applications (security, medical, finance, etc). Thus, the need for error free or error immune designs. Until recently, radiation effects were a major concern in space applications only. With technology scaling reaching nanometer level, terrestrial radiation has become a growing concern. As a result Single Event Upsets (SEUs) have become a major challenge to robust designs. Single event upset is a temporary change in the state of a device due to a particle strike (usually from the radiation belts or from cosmic rays) which may manifest as an error at the output. This thesis proposes a novel method for adaptive digital designs to efficiently work with the lowest possible power consumption. This new technique improves options in performance, robustness and power. The thesis also proposes a new dual data rate flipflop, which reduces the necessary clock speed by half, drastically reducing the power consumption. This new dual data rate flip-flop design culminates in a proposed unique radiation hardened dual data rate flip-flop, “Firebird”. Firebird offers a valuable addition to the future circuit designs, especially with the increasing importance of the Single Event Upsets (SEUs) and power dissipation with technology scaling.
