40|$|Utilizing {{electric}} arc smelters for making steel has allowed many smaller manufacturers {{to compete with}} large integrated mills. The {{electric arc}} furnace melts scrap to produce steel. The subject of this report is a Scrap Preheater that heats and cleans the arc furnace scrap using its own low cost natural gas energy supply. Scrap preheating can increase the capacity of a given arc furnace and reduce the operating costs. In addition it reduces the air emissions and allows utilization of lower cost scrap. The program was divided into three phases and was to culminate with an operating prototype at a demonstration host site steel mill. A host site agreement was executed and critical components were tested. The prototype scrap preheater was completely designed. It was sized to preheat 30 tons of scrap in a <b>scrap</b> <b>bucket</b> in 30 minutes. Energy is supplied by a rich fume reactor that completely oxidizes organics from the scrap and auxiliary natural gas. There were several delays {{and changes in the}} project that resulted in the host site requesting to withdraw from the program. Extensive efforts were made to secure a replacement host site. However, when another host could not be found, the project was terminated...|$|E
40|$|This {{project is}} an {{analysis}} of the performance of Hulaminâ€™s Camps Drift Remelt (CDR) facility in order to establish a standard operating procedure for the loading of <b>scrap</b> into <b>buckets</b> for different furnaces. Taking into consideration the simulated furnace charging sequence scenarios, a linear programming model was built to generate optimal loading sequences and scrap breakdowns while applying relevant constraints to each scenario. The results of each scenario model, as well as additional observations made during the study, are incorporated to enforce the recommendation that a stricter standard operating procedure for bucket loading needs to be implemented and immediate attention is required to control particular avoidable delays that are causing extensive losses to production time.
