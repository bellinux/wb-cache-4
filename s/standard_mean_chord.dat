40|$|Tests {{have been}} made in the 8 ft x 8 ft wind tunnel on a 1 / 18. 86 scale model in order to {{investigate}} the effects of Reynolds number and Mach number on the low speed stalling characteristics. In particular, measurements of lift and pitching moment were obtained in conjunction with flow visualization studies using tufts attached to the wing upper surface. The investigation covered a range of Reynolds number based on <b>standard</b> <b>mean</b> <b>chord</b> from 1 " 12 x 106 to 4. 33 x 106, with a Mach number range extending from 0. 15 to 0. 30. The results obtained effectively demonstrate the importance of testing accurate models at sufficiently high Reynolds numbers, and of the necessity of separating Reynolds number effects from Mach number effects, if realistic values of CLmax are to be obtained in wind-tunnel tests and if the full scale type of stall development is to be reproduced at model scale. The stall development on the present model at the highest Reynolds number of the tests (Re = 4. 33 x 106) closely resembles that on the aircraft at the same Mach number (0. 2) and the ful...|$|E
40|$|Chord length {{distributions}} for rectangular parallelepipeds {{of various}} relative dimensions were studied {{in relation to}} radiation hardness testing. For each geometry, a differential chord length distribution was generated using a Monte Carlo method to simulate exposure to an isotropic radiation source. The frequency and dose distributions of chord length crossings for each geometry, {{as well as the}} means of these distributions, are presented. In every case, the dose <b>mean</b> <b>chord</b> length was greater than the frequency <b>mean</b> <b>chord</b> length with a 34. 5 % increase found for the least extreme case of a cube. This large increase of the dose <b>mean</b> <b>chord</b> length relative to the frequency <b>mean</b> <b>chord</b> length demonstrates the need to consider rare, long-chord-length crossings in radiation hardness testing of electronic components...|$|R
40|$|An {{accurate}} {{system matrix}} {{is required for}} quantitative proton CT (pCT) image reconstruction with iterative projection algorithms. The system matrix is composed of chord lengths of individual proton path intersections with reconstruction pixels. In previous work, reconstructions were performed assuming constant intersection chord lengths, which led to systematic errors of the reconstructed proton stopping powers. The {{purpose of the present}} work was to introduce a computationally efficient variable intersection chord length in order to improve the accuracy of the system matrix. An analytical expression that takes into account the discrete stepping nature of the pCT most likely path (MLP) reconstruction procedure was created to describe an angle-dependent effective <b>mean</b> <b>chord</b> length function. A pCT dataset was simulated with GEANT 4 using a parallel beam of 200 MeV protons intersecting a computerized head phantom consisting of tissue-equivalent materials with known relative stopping power. The phantom stopping powers were reconstructed with the constant chord length, exact chord length, and effective <b>mean</b> <b>chord</b> length approaches, in combination with the algebraic reconstruction technique. Relative stopping power errors were calculated for each anatomical phantom region and compared for the various methods. It was found that the error of approximately 10 % in the mean reconstructed stopping power value for a given anatomical region, resulting from a system matrix with a constant chord length, could be reduced to less than 0. 5 % with either the effective <b>mean</b> <b>chord</b> length or exact chord length approaches. Reconstructions with the effective <b>mean</b> <b>chord</b> length were found to be approximately 20 % faster than reconstructions with an exact chord length. The effective <b>mean</b> <b>chord</b> length method provides the possibility for more accurate, computationally efficient quantitative pCT reconstructions...|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} a parallel benchmark procedure and numerical results for a three-dimensional binary stochastic medium particle transport benchmark problem. The binary stochastic medium {{is composed of}} optically thick spherical inclusions distributed in an optically thin background matrix material. We investigate three sphere <b>mean</b> <b>chord</b> lengths, three distributions for the sphere radii (constant, uniform, and exponential), and six sphere volume fractions ranging from 0. 05 to 0. 3. For each sampled independent material realization, we solve the associated transport problem using the Mercury Monte Carlo particle transport code. We compare the ensemble-averaged benchmark fiducial tallies of reflection from and transmission through the spatial domain as well as absorption in the spherical inclusion and background matrix materials. For the parameter values investigated, we find a significant dependence of the ensemble-averaged fiducial tallies on both sphere <b>mean</b> <b>chord</b> length and sphere volume fraction, with the most dramatic variation occurring for the transmission through the spatial domain. We find a weaker dependence of most benchmark tally quantities on the distribution describing the sphere radii, provided the sphere <b>mean</b> <b>chord</b> length used is {{the same in the}} different distributions. The exponential distribution produces larger differences from the constant distribution than the uniform distribution produces. The transmission through the spatial domain does exhibit a significant variation when an exponential radius distribution is used...|$|R

50|$|<b>Mean</b> Aerodynamic <b>Chord</b> (MAC): A {{specific}} {{chord line}} of a tapered wing. At the <b>mean</b> aerodynamic <b>chord,</b> the center of pressure has the same aerodynamic force, position, and area as it does {{on the rest of}} the wing. The MAC represents the width of an equivalent rectangular wing in given conditions. On some aircraft, the center of gravity is expressed as a percentage of the length of the MAC. In order to make such a calculation, the position of the leading edge of the MAC must be known ahead of time. This position is defined as a distance from the reference datum and is found in the aircraft's flight manual and also on the aircraft's type certificate data sheet. If a general MAC is not given but a LeMAC (leading edge <b>mean</b> aerodynamic <b>chord)</b> and a TeMAC (trailing edge <b>mean</b> aerodynamic <b>chord)</b> are given (both of which would be referenced as an arm measured out from the datum line) then your MAC can be found by finding the difference between your LeMAC and your TeMAC.|$|R
40|$|This article {{outlines}} a new control {{approach for}} flapping-wing micro-aerial vehicles (MAVs), in-spired both by biological systems {{and by the}} need for lightweight actuation and control solutions. In our approach, the aerodynamic forces required for agile motions are achieved indirectly, by modifying passive impedance properties that couple motion of the power stroke to the angle of attack (AoA) of the wing. This strategy is theoretically appealing because it can ex-ploit an invariant, cyclical power stroke, for efficiency, and because an impedance-adjusting strategy should also require lower bandwidth, weight, and power than direct, intra-wingbeat control of AoA. We examine the theoretical range of control torques and forces {{that can be achieved}} using this method and conclude that it is a plausible method of control. Our results demon-strate the potential of a passive dynamic design and control approach in reducing mechanical complexity, weight and power consumption of an MAV while achiev-ing the aerodynamic forces required for the types of high-fidelity maneuvers that drive current interest in au-tonomous, flapping-wing robotics.

40|$|A lift {{producing}} {{device is}} disclosed which {{is adapted to}} be connected to a vehicle to provide lift to the vehicle when the vehicle is moved relative to a first fluid medium having a first density and viscosity and being in contact with a second fluid medium adjacent the vehicle. The second fluid medium has a second fluid density which is different from the first fluid density. The lift producing device comprises opposed first and second major surfaces joined at a longitudinally extending leading edge and at a longitudinally extending trailing edge, with at least a portion of the longitudinally extending leading edge being spaced from the longitudinally extending trailing edge by a predetermined <b>mean</b> <b>chord</b> length. When the vehicle is moved relative to the first fluid medium at a velocity within a range of predetermined velocities, with each of the velocities having a direction inclined from a plane extending through the leading edge and the trailing edge within a predetermined angular range, a region of high pressure is generated in the first fluid medium adjacent the first major surface and a region of low pressure is generated in the first fluid medium adjacent the second major surface. The lift producing device has a cross-sectional shape which will generate a pressure distribution around the device when the vehicle is moved relative to the first fluid medium at a velocity within the range of predetermined velocities such that the first fluid medium exhibits attached laminar flow along the device for a portion of the predetermined <b>mean</b> <b>chord</b> length from the leading edge to the trailing edge and will neither form a laminar separation bubble adjacent the second major surface of the device, nor exhibit turbulent separation adjacent the second major surface for substantially all of the predetermined <b>mean</b> <b>chord</b> length from the leading edge to the trailing edge.

40|$|International audienceCyclopentane (CP) is {{an organic}} {{thermodynamic}} additive which promotes the clathrate hydrate formation at low pressure and middle temperature. It forms classical gas hydrates with structure SII. Cyclopentane is dispersed as an emulsion, and crystallizes with CO 2 {{to form a}} clathrate hydrate a low pressure that is enriched in the CO 2 (Galfré et a l, 2014). Experimental studies were investigated with a focused Beam Reflectance Measurements (FBRM) probe in a cooled stirred batch reactor. Firstly, we performed a parametric study to allow evidencing the occurrence of the coalescence of the CP droplets in the emulsion at high speed rate and at low ratio of surfactant (Tween 80). As the surfactant concentration is increased, we monitor the coalescence phenomenon of the droplets and observe it is reduced. Secondly, in presence of a stable emulsion of CP in water, we observe the crystallization of mixed hydrates of CP and CO 2. It {{was found that the}} FBRM can successfully monitor the nucleation. A sudden change in the <b>mean</b> <b>chord</b> length is observed followed by an enlargement of the Chord Length Distribution (CLD), and a progressive disappearance of the CP droplets, to the benefice of the mixed hydrate of CP and CO 2.
