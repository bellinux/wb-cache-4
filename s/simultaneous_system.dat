However Pál Engel noted other {{authorities}} also held the title {{at the same time}} beside the Palatine, because they exercised sovereignty over each seats. In this <b>simultaneous</b> <b>system,</b> the Palatine was only a ceremonial and [...] "honorary" [...] judge of the Cumans, and the judges acted independently of the Palatine, according to Tibor Szőcs. The first known Palatine was Nicholas Zsámboki, who took action on the matter of Cumans, in accordance with a diploma from 12 April 1343. The document preserved that the Cuman chieftain Buthemer's kindred came under the jurisdiction of Zsámboki from Thomas Szécsényi, Voivode of Transylvania in order to Louis I's provision. This also confirms that the Palatine's authority was due to an ad hoc royal privilegium, and not a permanently fixed role. In 1371, Louis I granted this privilegium to his Cuman-origin royal fowler, Ladislaus and his Kuncheg kindred too.|$|E
50|$|In December 1998 a INES 2 {{incident}} occurred after severe winds and sea spray disabled all four power {{lines to the}} site. After multiple grid failures {{in a short period}} of time, emergency diesel generators failed to start. Normally, in the absence of power for the reactor cooling pumps, the reactor would be passively cooled. However, the emergency control system which would have initiated passive cooling failed to act, as it had not been reset. Reactor cooling was reinstated after 4 hours. There was considerable confusion and delay in restoring power as plant schematics and security systems were computerised but were rendered inoperable due to lack of electrical power. Due to the inherent safety margins of the AGR reactor design, there was no reactor damage, and the plant would have tolerated loss of cooling for 20 hours. The subsequent investigation made several recommendations: redesign of the insulators on the 400 kV power lines, installation of an additional 132 kV power line for emergency power, a second diesel generator building remote from the first, installation of an uninterruptible power supply for the reactor safety systems and for essential computer equipment, provision of hard copy plant schematics and emergency protocols, and revised staff training procedures including simulation of multiple <b>simultaneous</b> <b>system</b> failures.|$|E

This system is tested for two air pollution cases in China: the annual average concentration of SO 2 and total suspended particles (TSP). Based on a panel database of 80 cities (1993 - 2001), the system is estimated by the Generalized Method of Moment (GMM) estimator for <b>simultaneous</b> <b>system.</b> The fixed effect estimator and the method of Anderson and Hsiao (1982) are included {{to take into account the}} city’s specific effect and the potential first-order autocorrelation respectively.

40|$|An {{approach}} to the calculation of longitudinally complicated waveguide structures is developed based on integral equation method. A problem of electromagnetic wave diffraction on the complicated structure consisting of {{a great number of}} connected waveguide sections has been solved in rigorous formulation. The expressions for its generalized scattering matrices which order is limited only by capabilities of computation technology are obtained. A designing technique for calculation of waveguide connections symmetrical with respect to the transverse plane passing through the middle of the structure perpendicularly to its longitudinal axis has been proposed. This technique is based on the solution of two <b>simultaneous</b> <b>systems</b> of linear algebraic equations with complex coefficients. The mathematical model of the symmetrical waveguide structure in the form of two <b>simultaneous</b> <b>systems</b> of linear algebraic equations with real coefficients is derived for estimation of single mode scattering matrix. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is illustrated by example of definition of mathematical models for calculation of scattering matrices of diaphragm of finite thickness and resonant enlargement between two circular waveguides. Proposed and known techniques for calculation of scattering matrices of these structures regarding the cost of computer time are compared. For the correct providing of this comparative analysis, the expressions for obtaining generalized scattering matrix of two circular waveguides junction are derived as a special case of scattering matrix of doubled discontinuity. It is shown that the proposed design technique based on the solution of <b>simultaneous</b> <b>systems</b> of linear algebraic equations which number is equaled to a number of discontinuities in waveguide structure ensures significant cost savings of computer time in comparison with the known approach based on the consecutive combining of generalized scattering matrices of separate junctions...|$|R
