25|$|Coincident {{with the}} {{construction}} of railways in the region, the age of the wooden sailing ship began to come to an end, being replaced by larger and faster <b>steel</b> <b>steam</b> ships. The Maritimes had long been a centre for shipbuilding, and this industry was hurt by the change. The larger ships were also less likely to call on the smaller population centres such as Saint John and Halifax, preferring to travel to cities like New York and Montreal. Even the Cunard Line, founded by Maritime-born Samuel Cunard, stopped making more than a single ceremonial voyage to Halifax each year.|$|E

She was powered {{by a pair of}} triple {{expansion}} steam engines, with cylinders of 15, 24 and 39 inches by 21-inch stroke, built by the W. & A. Fletcher Co. of Hoboken, New Jersey. Steam was supplied by two Babcock & Wilcox boilers at a working pressure of 225 pounds. The engines reportedly developed 2500 indicated horsepower and in an 1896 race with the steamer Monmouth—said to be the second fastest steamer in New York—Sovereign won handily.|$|E

50|$|Henry Scarr {{began his}} career in {{shipbuilding}} working with his brother Joseph in a yard at Beverley on the River Hull. The output from the yard included <b>steel</b> <b>steam</b> tugs, including Southern Cross, which was completed in 1896 for the City Steam Towing Company. It was fitted with a 200 ihp steam engine, and was still operational in 1921, when it {{became one of the}} first tugs owned by the newly formed United Towing Company. The partnership between the brothers was dissolved in 1897, and Henry moved to Hessle. The shipyard which he bought constructed wooden ships, including sloops and small pleasure craft, but after he took it over, the building of wooden ships ceased, and only iron and steel ships were produced. He advertised that the slipway at the yard was suitable for ships up to 100 ft long.|$|E
50|$|On March 17, two of Colonel Lowe's Washington-class {{hydrogen}} dirigibles {{flew into}} Portland to deliver much needed supplies and ammunition. The dirigibles, the George Washington and Nathaniel Greene, were {{powered by a}} light <b>steel</b> <b>steam</b> engine that turned a propeller for propulsion, and carried specially redesigned 72 pound 9-inch shells as armament. Major General Doyle of the Portland Field Force also had new weapons, special pivoting mountings for Armstrong guns allowing for the breech loading gun {{to be used as}} an anti-balloon gun battery. The Washington and Greene began to take fire from these batteries, but the shells passed through the gasbags without igniting. Doyle's guns did eventually find their mark, hitting the basket of the Greene and sending the dirigible to ground in flames, but Lowe avenged her by bombing the anti-balloon gun battery and then the British ammunition dump before returning to Portland.|$|E
50|$|Six boilers are extant at {{the site}} of the former boiler house {{approximately}} 28m west of the headframe. These consist of two sets of Babcock and Wilcox water tube boilers and chain grate stokers (a set of two and a set of four). Each set comprises a rectangular enclosure made of refractory bricks standing between 3m and 4m high. Riveted, <b>steel</b> <b>steam</b> drums are seated on the tops of the enclosures. They are held in place at intervals along the structure by steel girders that run up the sides and across the top. Large square, steel-framed openings at one end of the enclosure expose the ends of the sets of water tubes that run the length of the interior of the structure. A set of tubes is missing from the larger set of boilers, leaving a cavity. Underneath these openings are the arched brick openings of the furnaces.|$|E
50|$|During John Cockerill's lifetime, the {{factories}} produced not only spinning engines and <b>steel,</b> but <b>steam</b> engines (including air-blowers, traction engines, and engines for ships); in 1835 Belgiums first steam locomotive Le Belge was made. He also had interests in collierys and mines, {{as well as}} factories producing cloth, linen and paper.|$|R

Due to the railway not being connected to the national network, she had to be moved by road from Carnforth and the entrance to the yard at Llangollen was very tight. Unfortunately during the first weekend of the gala, the locomotive was failed with cylinder problems and wasn't able {{to take part in the}} remainder of the gala, with the engine returning to Carnforth shortly after the gala finished.|$|E
50|$|Grimsby was {{witness to}} the {{evolution}} of the fishing trawler. It saw the change from the early timber sailing vessels to the introduction of steam which revolutionised the fishing fleet. Steam allowed for powerful vessels to push ever further north and it was soon found that new <b>steel</b> <b>steam</b> trawler design had to evolve further to cope with the extreme environments the ships were required to encounter; the traditional 'bridge aft side' design of trawler was lost to ships with a hardy sleek steel wheelhouse amidships, the ships developed sleek hulls {{with the addition of a}} 'whaleback' forward in an attempt to provide shelter to the fishdeck, steam engines were replaced by modern powerful marine diesel technology and at the final stage of this evolution of the side winder trawler is Ross Tiger. Being built in the 1950s she was constructed the decade prior to Grimsby's introduction to the modern 'stern trawlers' and welded ship construction that changed the profile of the trawler forever. She is also old enough to retain the traditional character, brass and woodwork that is similar to the heritage and atmosphere of trawlers long before her time, but was lost by the 1960s.|$|E
50|$|Coincident {{with the}} {{construction}} of railways in the region, the age of the wooden sailing ship began to come to an end, being replaced by larger and faster <b>steel</b> <b>steam</b> ships. The Maritimes had long been a centre for shipbuilding, and this industry was hurt by the change. The larger ships were also less likely to call on the smaller population centres such as Saint John and Halifax, preferring to travel to cities like New York and Montreal. Even the Cunard Line, founded by Maritime-born Samuel Cunard, stopped making more than a single ceremonial voyage to Halifax each year.More controversial than the role of technology is the argument over the role of politics in the origins of the region's decline. Confederation and the tariff and railway freight policies that followed have often been blamed for having a deleterious effect on the Maritime economies. Arguments have been made that the Maritimes' poverty was caused by control over policy by Central Canada which used the national structures for its own enrichment. This was the central view of the Maritime Rights Movement of the 1920s, which advocated greater local control over the region's finances. T.W. Acheson {{is one of the main}} proponents of this theory. He notes the growth that was occurring during the early years of the National Policy in Nova Scotia demonstrates how the effects of railway fares and the tariff structure helped undermine this growth. Capitalists from Central Canada purchased the factories and industries of the Maritimes from their bankrupt local owners and proceeded to close down many of them, consolidating the industry in Central Canada.|$|E

50|$|Though {{intended}} to recapitulate in <b>steel</b> and <b>steam</b> {{the concept of}} the 74-gun third-rate, which had formed the backbone of the sailing battle fleets of the previous century, the tactical and technical calculus of early 20th century naval warfare had made the third-rate concept obsolete; to be viable, a battle line needed to consist entirely of what could be considered first-rate units.|$|R
40|$|This article {{presents}} a literature overview and discusses a practical case involving {{the effect of}} in service weld repair on the performance - behavior under creep conditions and remanent life - of low alloy CrMo <b>steel</b> <b>steam</b> pipelines with longstanding use. According to the specialized literature, several authors argue that the in service weld repair of low alloy CrMo <b>steel</b> <b>steam</b> pipes can be done successfully, while others disagree, reporting a reduction of up to 30 % or more in the remanent life. According to the case analyzed here, which involves the weld repair of a 1 &frac 14;Cr&frac 12;Mo ferrite-pearlite <b>steel</b> <b>steam</b> pipe operating for 20 years at 480 °C, in service weld repair leads to the intragranular precipitation of Fe 2 MoC-type carbides and decreases the solute concentration of the ferrite in the base metal adjacent to the welded joint, thereby considerably reducing the pipeline's remanent life, since the estimated rupture time for the service-aged material is 3. 6 times that estimated for the weld-repaired joint...|$|E

50|$|Northwestern <b>Steel's</b> <b>steam</b> engines {{were among}} the last {{to operate in the}} United States. Old No. 73, as it was known, (a 1929 Baldwin {{locomotive}}) was the final steam engine to be used in America. NWSW last used the locomotive on Dec. 3, 1980 at 10 a.m. Its final run was made coupled to the technology that replaced it, a diesel engine. On Jan. 19, 1981, No. 73 was moved to the south lawn of the Paul W. Dillon Home. From tracks inside the steel mill complex, the locomotive was taken east along the Geneva Subdivision main line of the Chicago & North Western Railroad {{a mile and a half}} to a location which passes just behind the Dillon home. 73 was then lifted via four cranes and moved the last 75 yards to its final resting place as a memorial to Dillon, the man who kept the idea of steam engines alive for more than twenty years.|$|R
