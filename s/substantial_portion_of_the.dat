5|$|Before {{construction}} could begin, the Navy {{found itself}} {{in the midst of}} political situation because the Hungarian government demanded that a <b>substantial</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> submarine contracts be allocated to Hungarian firms. After intricate negotiations, the order was split into two orders of two submarines each, with U-20 and U-21 built at the Pola Navy Yard, and U-22 and U-23 built at the Hungarian UBAG yard at Fiume. The subcontracts were also divided between Hungarian and Austrian firms, with about two-thirds going to Hungarian companies and one-third to Austrian companies. This allocation of contracts, while politically expedient, exacerbated technical problems that resulted in numerous modifications and delays.|$|E
5|$|Under the {{protection}} of the National Guard, some miners returned to work and some strikebreakers, imported from the eastern coalfields, joined them as Guard troops protecting their movements. In February 1914, a <b>substantial</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> troops were withdrawn, but a large contingent remained at Ludlow. On April 20, 1914, a general fire-fight occurred between strikers and troops, which was antagonized by the troops and mine guards. The camp was burned, resulting in 15 women and children, who hid in tents at the camp, being burned to death. Costs to both mine operators and the union were high. This incident brought unwanted national attention to Colorado.|$|E

Rixey originally declined, saying he wanted to be a chemist, but Rigler insisted, even offering a <b>substantial</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bonus he received for signing a player. With his family in financial trouble, Rixey accepted the deal. The National League, upon hearing of the deal, created a rule that prohibits umpires from signing players.

Lake Scranton and the Williams Bridge Reservoir are used as a water supply, with the former providing 22 million gallons of water per day. Together with Roaring Brook and Spring Brook, it provides a <b>substantial</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> water supply of the Lackawanna Valley. Downstream of Lake Scranton, the watershed contains a lake used by the Montage Mountain Ski Resort for snowmaking.|$|E
5|$|Until 1886, the Sultan of Zanzibar {{controlled}} a <b>substantial</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> east African coast, {{known as}} Zanj, and trading routes extending {{further into the}} continent, as far as Kindu on the Congo River. That year, the British and Germans secretly met and re-established the area under the Sultan's rule. Over the next few years, most of the mainland possessions of the Sultanate were taken by European imperial powers. With {{the signing of the}} Heligoland-Zanzibar Treaty in 1890 during Ali bin Said's reign, Zanzibar became a British protectorate. In August 1896, Britain and Zanzibar fought a 38-minute war, the shortest in recorded history, after Khalid bin Barghash had taken power after Hamid bin Thuwaini's death. The British had wanted Hamoud bin Mohammed to become Sultan, believing that he would be much easier to work with. The British gave Khalid an hour to vacate the Sultan's palace in Stone Town. Khalid failed to do so, and instead assembled an army of 2,800 men to fight the British. The British launched an attack on the palace and other locations around the city. Khalid retreated and later went into exile. Hamoud was then installed as Sultan.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to its strategic military importance, the Golan Heights is an important water resource, especially at the higher elevations, which are snow-covered {{in the winter and}} help sustain baseflow for rivers and springs during the dry season.

The occupied sector of the Golan Heights provides or controls a <b>substantial</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> water in the Jordan River watershed, which in turn provides a portion of Israel's water supply.
