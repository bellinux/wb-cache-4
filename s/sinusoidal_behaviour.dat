The magnetoresistance (MR) of LSMO thin film shows a large MR for current parallel to applied magnetic field compared to current perpendicular to field, which agrees well with the large magnetization observed when the magnetic field applied parallel to plane of the film. The angular dependence of magnetoresistance deviating from the <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>behaviour</b> indicates {{the role played by}} grain boundary. From the anisotropic magnetotransport and magnetic measurements, it is evident that our LSMO thin film exhibits the in-plane anisotropy...|$|E

40|$|We present high {{spectral}} {{and time}} resolution observations of high signal-to-noise ratio (above 200) of the beta Cephei star alpha Lupi, carried out for three different wavelengths during three nights. The radial velocity curves show a nice <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>behaviour</b> for all elements. However, the amplitude {{and the average}} velocity of the variation depend on the considered lines. By means of a simple least squares fit conducted on each observed night, we also point out a non-constancy of the pulsation period. A comparison between the RI and FWHM curves {{seems to indicate that}} temperature effects are present during the pulsation, while the EW varies by about 3 %. The radius variation and acceleration curves have a small amplitude, indicating that the motion does not have any strong non-linear behaviour. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|The Fourier-based {{analysis}} customarily {{employed to}} analyze the dynamics of a simple pendulum is here revisited to propose an elementary iterative scheme aimed at generating a sequence of analytical approximants of the exact law of motion. Each approximant is expressed by a Fourier sum whose coefficients are given by suitable linear combinations of Bessel functions, which {{are expected to be}} more accessible, especially at an undergraduate level, with respect to Jacobian elliptic functions. The first three approximants are explicitely obtained and compared with the exact solution for typical initial angular positions of the pendulum. In particular, it is shown that, at the lowest approximation level, the law of motion of the pendulum turns out to be adequately described, up to oscillation amplitudes of π/ 2, by a <b>sinusoidal</b> temporal <b>behaviour</b> with a frequency proportional to the square root of the so-called "besinc" function, well known in physical optics...|$|R

We use this model {{to construct a}} phase diagram of different delamination behaviours, produced by varying the compression of the film and also the radius to which local relaxation is allowed to take place about failing bonds. From this we see a progression from laminar and linear behaviours to radial and rounded features as compressive stress is increased. <b>Sinusoidal</b> telephone cord <b>behaviour</b> occurs only at a small range of fairly low stresses, and thin films. © EDP Sciences, Società Italiana di Fisica, Springer-Verlag 2005...|$|R
40|$|Characteristics of {{synchronous}} {{machines with}} permanent magnets depend among others on geometric {{layout of the}} machine section. Unlike EC motors, where rectangular arrangement of quantities is suitable, these machines require <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>behaviour.</b> Specific forming of individual machine parts is partially derived from this requirement. This thesis deals with design of such machines, including various geometrical modifications of their sections and examination of influence of those modifications. The thesis includes also analytical calculation procedure of machine parameters as well as verification of final characteristics using the finite element method. It results in a combination of various design methods. FEMM, Maxwell RMxprt and Maxwell 2 D Transient Analysis programs were used for verification. Individual modifications of machine geometries are applied to machines with concentrated windings with different ratio of number of slots and poles, and differences between machines and results of individual methods are compared...|$|E
40|$|For {{prediction}} of limit cycle oscillations of linearly unstable thermo-acoustic systems, a frequency-domain, low-order system with explicit modal coupling is developed. To this purpose, {{a model for}} the nonlinear heat source dynamics is obtained from unsteady computational fluid dynamics in combination with feed-forward neural network identification. From the neural network, an equivalent representation for the input-output relation in Volterra series form is derived, where Volterra kernels are computed in terms of the weights of the neural network. Then the kernels are transformed into the frequency domain to obtain the higher order transfer functions, through which the modes are coupled. In this way nonlinear energy exchange among the modes can be described explicitly. Comparison with a Galerkin time domain simulation shows that deviations from purely <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>behaviour</b> in the limit cycle are captured correctly, while the computational cost is drastically reduced...|$|E
40|$|Josephson {{junctions}} with topological insulator weak links can host {{low energy}} Andreev bound states {{giving rise to}} a current phase relation that deviates from <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>behaviour.</b> Of particular interest are zero energy Majorana bound states that form at a phase difference of π. Here we report on interferometry studies of Josephson junctions and superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) incorporating topological insulator weak links. We find that the nodes in single junction diffraction patterns and SQUID oscillations are lifted and independent of chemical potential. At high temperatures, the SQUID oscillations revert to conventional behaviour, ruling out asymmetry. The node lifting of the SQUID oscillations is consistent with low energy Andreev bound states exhibiting a nonsinusoidal current phase relation, coexisting with states possessing a conventional sinusoidal current phase relation. However, the finite nodal currents in the single junction diffraction pattern suggest an anomalous contribution to the supercurrent possibly carried by Majorana bound states, although we also consider the possibility of inhomogeneity.

40|$|We {{study the}} forms {{of a range of}} free energy functionals for {{materials}} with memory for two types of strain history, namely <b>sinusoidal</b> and exponential <b>behaviours.</b> The work deals with discrete spectrum materials, which are those with relaxation functions given by sums of decaying exponentials. Various standard free energy functionals are explored, including the minimum free energy and related quantities. It is shown that quite different formulae are obtained, depending on the manner in which these functionals are evaluated, particularly for those related to the minimum free energy. Such differences are resolved. Various numerical plots of free energies are presented and discussed, along with the rates of dissipation associated with them. This is the first comprehensive exploration of quantitative comparisons between the various free energy functionals. The results both illustrate certain properties that have been deduced theoretically and expose an interesting proximity between apparently unconnected functionals...|$|R
40|$|Haptic {{feedback}} has {{two important}} sources of dynamics: the machine being controlled and the haptic device itself. This paper {{concentrates on the}} means of identifying the dynamics of a Phantom Omni haptic feedback device. Two models are compared: a dynamic model with parameters using results from sinusoidal steady state analysis and a data driven model that uses pseudo-random binary sequences (PRBS) for identification. The overall form of the frequency and phase response is well-defined for the dynamics model but for the data driven model a spectral estimate from PRBS response data is {{used to determine the}} model order. The results in this paper show that a dynamic equation based minimal model produces accuracy as good as the data driven model. While the data driven model has more fitting accuracy the increase in accuracy is not useful for modelling the physical response as the differences occur at high frequencies where the Phantom arm is not sensitive anyway. The dynamic model is particularly useful as it gives a physical basis for the observed output and the <b>sinusoidal</b> steady state <b>behaviour</b> is useful for exposing non-linearities. Future work includes development and verification an arm inertia model that allows system parameters to be identified from response data at arbitrary arm angles...|$|R
40|$|Impedance and current-noise {{measurements}} {{were made on}} n-type gold-doped silicon single crystals provided with electron-injecting contacts. The d. c. current {{is proportional to the}} applied voltage in the ohmic regime considered here. The capacitance is both frequency and d. c. bias dependent at frequencies below the reciprocal electron transit time. In addition, the capacitance shows a <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>behaviour</b> as a function of frequency under certain conditions. The a. c. resistance, equal to the d. c. resistance at lower frequencies, rapidly decreases at frequencies around the reciprocal free-electron lifetime and becomes constant at higher frequencies; moreover, the magnitude depends on the d. c. bias. The observed generation-recombination (g-r) noise is trapping noise associated with a gold-acceptor level at 0. 54 eV below the conduction band. The frequency behaviour of the g-r noise spectra depends on d. c. bias voltage at the higher levels where the free-electron transit time becomes smaller than both the free-electron lifetime and the dielectric relaxation time. The free-electron lifetime is found to be about 1 μs at room temperature...|$|E
40|$|Massive {{stars and}} supernovae (SNe) {{have a huge}} impact on their environment. Despite their importance, a {{comprehensive}} knowledge of which massive stars produce which SNe is hitherto lacking. We use a Monte Carlo method to predict the mass-loss rates of massive stars in the Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram (HRD) covering all phases from the OB main sequence, the unstable Luminous Blue Variable (LBV) stage, to the final Wolf-Rayet (WR) phase. Although WR produce their own metals, a strong dependence of the mass-loss rate on the initial iron abundance is found at sub-solar metallicities (1 / 10 - 1 / 100 solar). This may present a viable mechanism to prevent the loss of angular momentum by stellar winds, which could inhibit GRBs occurring at solar metallicities - providing a significant boost to the collapsar model. Furthermore, we discuss recently reported quasi-sinusoidal modulations in the radio lightcurves of SN 2001 ig and SNe 2003 bg. We show that both the <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>behaviour</b> and the recurrence timescale of these modulations are consistent with the predicted mass-loss behaviour of LBVs.

30|$|The SSF {{profiles}} of various combinations implicated an interesting {{relation between the}} rate of saccharification, rate of sugar utilization {{and the rate of}} ethanol formation. A sinusoidal behavior was represented in most cases of the dynamic profile of reducing sugar depicting a balance between the rate of saccharification and utilization of sugar for growth and ethanol fermentation. In some cases, specifically, in bioreactor SSF, the accumulation of reducing sugar in the broth repressed activity of cellulase enzyme which in turn resulted in decreased rate of hydrolysis concluding the inverse relationship between the enzyme activity and the reducing sugar content. A glucose concentration of 20 g L- 1 is reported to have 75 % repressive effect on the cellulase activity [21]. Thus, the <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>behaviour</b> observed in all batch SSF experiments (Figures  3, 4 and 5) may be attributed to the combined effect of decrease of saccharification and in turn its subsequent utilization for growth and ethanol production. On the other hand, a sugar concentration below a threshold level decreased the repressive effect on cellulase activity. An interesting behaviour in our batch SSF experiments between depletion of sugars without any further rise in ethanol concentration indicated the utilization of sugars for maintenance and survival of the fermentative microbes (Figures  3, 4 and 5).|$|E
40|$|Pollux is {{considered}} as an archetype {{of a giant}} star hosting a planet: its radial velocity (RV) presents sinusoidal variations with {{a period of about}} 590 d, which have been stable for more than 25 years. Using ESPaDOnS and Narval we have detected a weak (sub-gauss) magnetic field at the surface of Pollux and followed up its variations with Narval during 4. 25 years, i. e. more than for two periods of the RV variations. The longitudinal magnetic field is found to vary with a <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>behaviour</b> with a period close to that of the RV variations and with a small shift in phase. We then performed a Zeeman Doppler imaging (ZDI) investigation from the Stokes V and Stokes I least-squares deconvolution (LSD) profiles. A rotational period is determined, which is consistent with the period of variations of the RV. The magnetic topology is found to be mainly poloidal and this component almost purely dipolar. The mean strength of the surface magnetic field is about 0. 7 G. As an alternative to the scenario in which Pollux hosts a close-in exoplanet, we suggest that the magnetic dipole of Pollux can be associated with two temperature and macroturbulent velocity spots which could be sufficient to produce the RV variations. We finally investigate the scenarii of the origin of the magnetic field which could explain the observed properties of Pollu...|$|E

Despite their importance, a {{comprehensive}} knowledge of which massive stars produce which SN/GRB is hitherto lacking. We present a brief overview about our knowledge of mass loss in the Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram (HRD) covering evolutionary phases of the OB main sequence, the unstable Luminous Blue Variable (LBV) stage, and the Wolf-Rayet (WR) phase. Despite the fact that metals produced by ``self-enrichment'' in WR atmospheres exceed the initial [...] host galaxy [...] metallicity, by orders of magnitude, a particularly strong dependence of the mass-loss rate on the initial metallicity is found for WR stars at sub-solar metallicities (1 / 10 [...] 1 / 100 solar). This provides a significant boost to the collapsar model for GRBs, as it may present a viable mechanism to prevent the loss of angular momentum by stellar winds at low metallicity, whilst strong Galactic WR winds may inhibit GRBs occurring at solar metallicities.

40|$|Measurements of C 2 –C 8 non-methane {{hydrocarbons}} (NMHCs) {{have been made}} in situ at Halley Base, Antarctica (75 ° 35 'S, 26 ° 19 'W) from February 2004 to February 2005 as part of the Chemistry of the Antarctic Boundary Layer and the Interface with Snow (CHABLIS) experiment. The data show long- and short-term variabilities in NMHCs controlled by the seasonal and geographic dependence of emissions and variation in atmospheric removal rates and pathways. Ethane, propane, iso-butane, n-butane and acetylene abundances followed a general OH-dependent sinusoidal seasonal cycle. The yearly averages were 186, 31, 3. 2, 4. 9 and 19 pptV, respectively, lower than those which were reported in some previous studies. Superimposed on a seasonal cycle was shorter-term variability that could be attributed to both synoptic airmass variability and localized loss processes due to other radical species. Hydrocarbon variability during periods of hour-to-day-long surface O 3 depletion in late winter/early spring indicated active halogen atom chemistry estimated to be in the range 1. 7 × 103 – 3. 4 × 104 atom cm− 3 for Cl and 4. 8 × 106 – 9. 6 × 107 atom cm− 3 for Br.

40|$|The {{present study}} focuses on {{understanding}} {{the effect of}} load and temperature on Acoustic Emission (AE) signal propagation in an Aluminium 2024 -T 3 panel. In addition, the ability of an AE system to locate damage under these operational and environmental conditions was evaluated. The work was performed in two stages. In stage one, the wave group velocities of guided Lamb waves were measured {{for a range of}} temperatures from - 40 ?C to 70 ?C. At each temperature level, six different static loads were applied that ranged from 0 MPa to 250 MPa in increments of 50 MPa. A mathematical analytical model for the effect of temperature on the wave group velocities was re-produced in order to verify it through experimental and FEM results. Furthermore, experimental and FEM results have been obtained for the effect of load and the combined case. It was observed that the variation of temperature and load altered the wave group velocities. The results showed that an increase in the temperature resulted in a decrease of the wave group velocity and vice versa. Furthermore, external applied loads resulted that the change group velocity varies linearly with increasing stress and has a sinusoidal dependence with the angle between sensor path and loading direction. Which meant that the wave group velocity decreased for small angles, increased for large angles and varied with a <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>behaviour</b> for the other angles between the propagation path and the loading direction. The effect of temperature and load can be super imposed onto each other. Experimentally obtained wave group velocities with temperature were within an error of 6 % to the analytical solution and for the FEM results this was within 3 %. In stage two, a representative AE signal, simulating a fracture phenomenon was emitted from a randomly selected point. Using values of wave velocity measured in stage one, the location of the representative AE signal under these conditions was calculated and errors were determined. It was found that the location algorithm was not sensitive to wave group velocities changes due to temperature and loads, thus providing an accurate location of the source within 1 cm, for a specimen size of 65 by 60 cm. The experimentally obtained localization results were also supported with results from a numerical model that calculated location errors for many locations in and outside the array. The effects of temperature and load were taken into account in the Time Differences Of Arrival (TDOA) function for a known location. These TDOA were then fed into a location algorithm (Geiger’s method). It was found that location errors due to temperature or load were within 1. 5 cm and were at some areas more significantly affected than at other locations. The reduced location accuracy of these source locations can be related to the angle dependent effect of load on wave group velocities. Source locations that have an angle between most sensors paths and loading direction that fits the largest change in wave velocity were found to be more significantly affected. The experimental results also presented problems with threshold selection during the experiments. A low AE threshold could translate into too much noise in the acquired signals, which can result in wrongfully triggering, while a high AE threshold could translate into incorrect group velocity measurements because a later part of the waveform would be used for triggering. Therefore the development of an threshold independent trigger mechanism is a recommendation for further research as well as investigating the effect of EOC in complex or composite structures.
