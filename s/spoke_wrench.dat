50|$|A <b>spoke</b> <b>wrench</b> or spoke key {{is a small}} wrench or tool used {{to adjust}} {{the tension in the}} spokes of a bicycle wheel, sulky wheel, {{wheelchair}} wheel, or similar wheel. A <b>spoke</b> <b>wrench</b> is sometimes called a nipple wrench, as it is the spoke nipple - not the spoke - that is turned in the process of changing the tension of a spoke.|$|E
5000|$|A {{wheel truing}} stand is a {{specialized}} tool for [...] "truing" [...] (straightening) bicycle wheels. Individual models differ slightly, but all consist of an axle stand {{on which the}} wheel can rotate and calipers, to measure slight deviations of the wheel's rim from ideal alignment. The stand is {{used in conjunction with}} an appropriately sized <b>spoke</b> <b>wrench</b> to loosen or tighten the spokes that connect the wheel's hub to the rim.|$|E

5000|$|Nigel Wrench {{is one of}} the few {{journalists to}} have met and interviewed Banksy. The {{graffiti}} artist <b>spoke</b> to <b>Wrench</b> for PM at the opening of [...] "Turf War", the first Banksy exhibition in London in 2003.|$|R
500|$|The pound-force has a metric counterpart, less {{commonly}} used than the newton: the kilogram-force (kgf) (sometimes kilopond), is the force exerted by standard gravity on one kilogram of mass. The kilogram-force {{leads to an}} alternate, but rarely used unit of mass: the metric slug (sometimes mug or hyl) is that mass that accelerates at [...] when subjected to a force of 1kgf. The kilogram-force is {{not a part of}} the modern SI system, and is generally deprecated; however it still sees use for some purposes as expressing aircraft weight, jet thrust, bicycle <b>spoke</b> tension, torque <b>wrench</b> settings and engine output torque. Other arcane units of force include the sth√®ne, which is equivalent to 1000N, and the kip, which is equivalent to 1000lbf.|$|R
50|$|The area of {{the nipple}} around which the <b>spoke</b> <b>wrench,</b> or key, is fitted in use is square in cross-section. Spoke keys may be 3- or 4-sided; the latter type has a small cutout to enable it to be fitted over a spoke, after which it may be slid along to engage all four flats of the nipple. It {{is less likely to}} round off the nipple than the 3-sided type, but is slower to use.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>spoke</b> <b>wrench</b> is {{used during}} the creation, maintenance, or repair of spoked wheels to adjust the tension of the spokes. The goal common to these {{activities}} is to bring the wheel (nearer) {{to a state of}} true [...] - [...] namely, a wheel in which the rim is 1) a perfect circle concentric with the axis of the axle in the hub, and 2) planar, such that the plane of the rim is centered laterally between the two extremes of the axle where it is supported in a frame. Additionally it is to make the spoke tension as close to the same on all spokes {{on the same side of}} the wheel, and to center the rim between the locknuts of the hub (known as dishing the wheel).|$|E
5000|$|Since spoke {{threading}} and nipple threading must match, {{boxes of}} spokes usually include a like number of nipples. Weight savings or {{the need for}} great strength due to building a wheel with few spokes might call for obtaining different nipples than those shipped with the spokes. Standard materials for nipples are brass (usually nickel-plated) and aluminum. Brass is heavier but more durable and less prone to corrosion, rounding of flats while tightening, breaking and galling; aluminum is far lighter. If using aluminum nipples, the spokes should be long enough to engage {{the full length of}} spoke nipple threads so that the load is carried from spoke {{to the top of the}} nipple. [...] If the spoke is only part way into the nipple, the nipple carries the tension load and is prone to breaking from fatigue failure. Also, with aluminum nipples care and a good <b>spoke</b> <b>wrench</b> are needed to avoid rounding the flats while tightening. Recently, titanium nipples have become available from both US and Chinese sources. Proponents of titanium nipples suggest that they combine the advantages of brass and aluminum nipples (strength and weight, respectively), while being more corrosion resistant than either material.|$|E
