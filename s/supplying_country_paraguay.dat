To assure a stable supply of qualified foreign seafarers, this study aims to research and select a foreign seafarer <b>supply</b> <b>country</b> for Korean Flag vessels. Factors influencing the selection were identified, and these factors were assessed by Delphi, fuzzy, and fuzzy TOPSIS methods in order to make a selection from several countries. Via empirical analysis by the fuzzy method, the results show that the factor of “total crew costs” is the most significant, followed by “quality of seafarers’ education and training” and “supply ability for well-trained seafarers. ” “government support from supply countries” is the least weighted factor for decision makers. The alternative countries assessment by fuzzy TOPSIS method suggests that the Philippines should be chosen as the dedicated foreign seafarer <b>supply</b> <b>country</b> for Korean Flag vessels, given the analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of these alternative foreign seafarer <b>supply</b> <b>countries.</b> Finally, some implications for continuous improvement of the seafarer <b>supply</b> <b>countries</b> are provided...|$|R

40|$|Commodity markets may be {{characterized}} by concentration on the buyer side, with {{a small number of}} transnational intermediary firms purchasing from <b>supplying</b> <b>countries</b> and distributing to the market. In many cases, developing economies may have little choice but to sell through these intermediaries, and recent work has suggested the export taxes may be an optimal policy to recapture some of the monopsony rent. However, in many commodity markets there are a limited number of large <b>supplying</b> <b>countries.</b> Even if the markets are competitive, this supply-side concentration suggests that economies have market power themselves, and that the governments of the countries may be engaged in a strategic game when selecting trade policies. We consider a situation where an oligopsonistic intermediary industry purchases from a small number of <b>supplying</b> <b>countries,</b> the governments of which act strategically in their policy choices both with respect to the intermediaries and any competing suppliers.

This paper investigated sourcing strategies and sourcing <b>supplying</b> <b>countries</b> of firms in Malaysia in responding to the intensified competition and put these strategies as an integral parts of firms’ distinctive competencies. Specifically, the results indicated sourcing strategies have significant effects to both financial and non-financial performance. However, both models indicated the ‘self-produce’ and ‘outsourcing’ strategies affect non-financial performance more than financial performance. The results also indicated the most popular <b>supplying</b> <b>countries</b> for both sourcing strategies (self-produce and outsourcing) are Malaysia, China and Singapore and majority of them received <b>supply</b> from one <b>country.</b> These findings provide new insights of sourcing practices among Malaysia based manufacturing firms and how those companies perceive and react to the competition environment surrounding them...|$|R

The selection argument outlined above implies that nonparticipants from a high female labor <b>supply</b> <b>country</b> would be more negatively selected than nonparticipants from a low female labor <b>supply</b> <b>country.</b> So selection could not explain why we find an especially large positive effect of source <b>country</b> female labor <b>supply</b> {{for those who did}} not work prior to migrating. Thus, while selection could help to explain the negative interaction effect by lowering the source <b>country</b> female labor <b>supply</b> effect for those who worked before migrating, it cannot explain the very large source country female participation effect we obtain for those who did not work prior to migrating. This makes it very unlikely that a reasonable selection story can account for these findings.|$|R
