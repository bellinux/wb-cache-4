Magasin du Nord took over its competitor Illum in 1991 but it was sold to Merrill Lynch in 2003. The company was controlled by Emil Vett's until the mid-1990s. To reduce its debts after a period with economic difficulties, the company chose to part with its buildings at Kongens Nytorv, in Lyngby and in Aalborg in a <b>sale</b> <b>and</b> <b>lease</b> <b>back</b> scheme.

This article aims to approach the leasing as a source or as a financing alternative investments, to highlight the benefits given by that to the three parties involved in a lease - the lessee or the user of the lease, the lessee or the leasing company and the good or the assets supplier which are the subject lease.

40|$|Until a {{few decades}} ago, the right of {{leasehold}} was a popular tool among various governments. That has changed. Of all the municipalities that were accustomed to use this figure, only Amsterdam is now {{referred to as a}} ‘real’ leasehold municipality. Nowadays, in particular others have discovered the potential of this right. Investors for example use leasehold as a vehicle for a (tax) attractive form of <b>sale</b> <b>and</b> <b>lease</b> <b>back.</b> Housing companies make use of the right of leasehold in order to enable their target group to acquire a home at a relatively low price. Nature conservation organisations are able to retain influence over the sustainable use of land and to ensure themselves from a more or less constant flow of funds. Governments use the right of leasehold merely in special cases, such as in areas where short term development is needed. In each case, the leasehold conditions are specifically tailored to the function that the legal concept fulfils in the situation concerned. Leasehold is therefore a user right that is established with differing objectives and under widely differing conditions. However, the legal possibilities to regulate the use of land and its financing through leasehold are not unlimited. This thesis maps these boundaries. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{unpredictable}} economic ups and downs, {{competition and}} advancement in technology has seen organisations that hold {{a great deal}} of real estate (RE) taking greater interest in the way their Corporate Real Estate (CRE) is managed: with the aim of reducing costs and making sure organisations occupy the right amount of space that is flexible to their changing needs. Public sector (PS) organisations are no exception, with tight budgetary constraints and calls for improved accountability in the use of public resources has seen CRE gain strategic importance. Governments have introduced Corporate Real Estate management (CREM) reforms, giving birth to establishment of RE management departments or subsidiaries and outsourcing of certain RE functions to experts in the private sector. PS organisations have replicated similar strategies to those applied in the private sector such as disposal of surplus property to unlock tied up capital, <b>sale</b> <b>and</b> <b>lease</b> <b>back</b> of property, collocation and portfolio management as value adding mechanisms to improve performance of their real estate. The main aim of CREM is to ensure that the properties occupied by organisations support their core operations. CREM is a discipline that has received {{a great deal of}} attention from organisations in the developed world due to pressure to stay competitive and improve shareholder value. CREM is relatively a new concept in developing countries and has not been studied at all in Botswana. The aim of this research report is to explore the current CRE management practices in Central Government Departments (CGD) in Botswana, and how it impacts on efficient use of office space compared to similar sized Private sector and Parastatal organisations. The intention of this research report is to develop CRE framework that will aid in the utilisation of office in government departments. Data was collected through semi structured interviews, open and closed end questionnaires administered to CRE professionals in public and private institutions. The Report recommends that Central Government Departments establish formal CRE units and the current CRE managers must go for further training in Real Estate management disciplines to improve their expertises in the field. Central Government Departments must take cognisance of the existing national office occupancy rate of 9 m 2 per office space per person and benchmark the use of their occupancy levels against it. It is recommended that CRE managers introduce more open plan office space layouts to improve efficiency in space occupation. The ratio cellular or enclosed to open plan offices is recommended at a rate of 1 : 9. Further investigation is required to establish office occupancy densities across the three sectors using the total number of offices occupants and total useable floor area. It is recommended that the future research adopts a comparative approach that is based on size and similar functions of the organisations.

40|$|As {{intellectual}} property (IP) and {{intellectual property}} rights (IPRs) play an increasingly important role in corporate strategy, the accurate valuation of IP remains a major obstacle to their emergence as a tradable asset class. Though there are several generally accepted ways to measure the value of IP, the introduction of more transparency in IP valuation procedures may render the trading of IP rights significantly more efficient and profitable. This report summarises the conclusions and recommendations of a European Commission (EC) appointed panel of European IP valuation experts drawn {{from a range of}} disciplines including those involved with accounting, business valuation, IP consulting, litigation and damage award activities. The panel's task was to consider how IP valuation plays a part in the policy for the "Innovation Union" and the bottlenecks that occur. This Expert Group has received the mandate to review valuation methods for IP and their use; to identify bottle necks in the valuation methods used for the purpose of a company’s financial reporting, access to finance and litigation; to identify good practices; and to recommend possible policy actions. Following the mandate given, this expert group has focused its analysis on IP and IPRs (excluding other intangible assets). The intangible assets created through the processes of innovation represent a major share of the value of today's businesses. The IP rights associated with those assets are the legal underpinning for potential returns on investment in that innovation. Despite their fundamental importance, the understanding of IP and IP rights does however differ widely amongst businesses large and small. There is a clear need to increase market actors’ confidence and certainty in IP valuation methods as a way to stimulate IP transactions, to support IP based financing and to give companies the tools to provide information about their IP. This will also allow investors to better understand the business and the value of the company itself and even to provide decision makers with the required information to decide whether to enforce or to license IP. However, the Expert Group has demonstrated {{that it is not the}} lack of valuation methods per se, or even standards for valuing IP that are missing, but rather other barriers that are having a greater influence on business and lenders. As IP is, by its nature, innovative and therefore different, each case for valuation requires investigation, rather than having an automated approach to IP valuation. As a result, IP valuation of a company’s assets is an opinion, at a particular point in time – similar in many respects to the way that a legal opinion is given. Although an informed layman might proffer a good guess, it is important to note that in the same way that one cannot automate the judgement on a law suit, one cannot automate judgement on an independent IP valuation. There are many factors involved and evidence and purpose can have a large impact. The valuation of IP assets is complicated by the fact that no two IP assets are the same. This is inherently the case when IP is protected by rights such as patents and trademarks, where a requisite for obtaining such rights is that the IP does not already exist. The uniqueness of IP makes comparisons with other IP difficult, thereby limiting the usefulness of comparison based pricing. As a result, valuations are often based on assumptions about the IP asset’s future use, what important milestones will be met and what management decisions will be taken. Valuation involves assumptions and judgement by the valuer derived from and justified based on a bespoke, rigorous analysis of the IP within its business context, together with its importance versus other business drivers, broader industry and competitor constraints, dynamics and economic outlook. Numerous valuation standards have been issued during the last years concerning different IP rights with different geographical scope and different regulation approach. They have different binding power for professionals, organizations or for certain applications. It is important to note that these standards and guidelines have no contradictory content. Also, from a content perspective they are quite homogeneous. The bottleneck for the improvement of an IP market is not in the lack of accepted methods or standards, their content or consistency, but in the limited dissemination of the fact that they exist and the little confidence in their results. This Expert Group has firstly investigated European best practice in IP valuation as performed by financial institutions that are providing capital, particularly to SMEs. This report presents the results of this research and their approach to IP backed financing – the successes and failures and whether IP valuation is actually carried out as part of the financing process. The findings of the research carried out are summarised under the headings of equity financing and debt financing and some examples of current practice are provided. We note that there is a significant difference in the approach to lending to SMEs and start-ups compared with larger corporates that have a strong trading history. A solution is needed to fund the commercialisation of innovative ideas, with the value of the IP asset acting as collateral. Overcoming the barriers to lending against IP assets is therefore attractive at a national and European Level. Equity investors typically invest into companies, but not into IP assets as such. The equity finance community considers the importance of IP when financing companies, however, the actual value of IP assets per se is rarely considered important. In general IP is evaluated but generally not formally valued in the regular banking, venture capital or private equity sectors. The general consensus amongst those interviewed is that IP is too risky to be used as collateral for traditional loans. However, it must be noted that cases of intangible asset based lending (IABL) have occurred in certain circumstances. Combined asset based lending has been achieved whereby a bank provides a loan to a pension fund against tangible assets and the pension fund then provides a sale and lease-back arrangement against intangible assets. IABL from pension funds (on a <b>sale</b> <b>and</b> <b>lease</b> <b>back</b> arrangement) rather than banks, provides a route for SMEs to obtain loans that is gaining increasing attention. One reason given for this uptake in IABL between a company and director pension funds is the growing number of SMEs who have difficulties in securing bank loans. In the Accounting and Reporting section the Expert Group reports that there are limitations on when and how it is possible to place the value of IP assets on the balance sheet of the company. The complexity of IP from an accounting perspective leads to problems in its reporting, which may result in the vulnerability of firms which base most of their performance on IP. The existing regulatory situation implies that IP can only be recognised in rare cases, and mostly at historical cost based on a previous acquisition of such IP. It is difficult to recognise internally generated IP as, when the expenditure to develop the IP is incurred, it is usually unclear whether it will generate benefits in the future. As a consequence, an important part of internally generated IP is not recognised in the balance sheet of an enterprise, meaning that potential investors are not receiving some relevant information about the company. The filing of a “management report” together with the annual report, giving detailed information about IP value, seems to be a useful vehicle to improve publicly available information on intangibles. Finally, the Expert Group states that an issue that influences a company’s decision to protect its IP, especially in the case of SMEs, is to what extent such rights are enforceable, the time and costs involved in litigation, and the foreseeable economic results. The quality of the enforcement system has an important impact in IP protection. SMEs and large companies need to be assured an accessible justice system in case of infringement, validity and other IPR related litigation cases, which implies the need to provide judges and professional valuers with the appropriate tools and data to facilitate valuation in litigation. As a result of the in-depth analysis carried out in all the mentioned areas, the Expert Group recommends a number of policy actions that could have a significant impact on reducing the identified barriers in order to increase the efficient use of IP valuation and to make such valuation flexible, transparent and reliable to respond to market requirements: Establishing a data source containing information for use by valuation professionals, as a way to enhance credibility of valuations by improving data and available information on IP transactions, Creating an organization to oversee IP valuation practice as a way to increase confidence in the quality of valuations being performed and to ensure that valuations are in line with generally accepted principles and standards, Introducing a risk sharing scheme for banks to facilitate IP secured lending to innovative companies, especially SMEs, Introducing an additional reporting section for intangible assets and IP that would increase the transparency of IP value within company accounts, providing important information to lenders, investors and stakeholders...|$|E
