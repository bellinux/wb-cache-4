However, the bid did not reach the formal UEFA <b>selection</b> <b>stage</b> having been abandoned by the Welsh and Scottish Football Associations for financial reasons. In April 2014, the FAW did submit a formal bid to host three group matches and either a round of 16 match or a quarter-final at Euro 2020, which UEFA planned to host at 13 venues across Europe. When the host venues were voted on in September 2014, the Millennium Stadium lost out by a single vote behind Glasgow's Hampden Park, a decision that FAW chief executive Jonathan Ford put down to UEFA politics. On 30 June 2015, the Millennium Stadium was chosen as the venue for the 2017 UEFA Champions League Final. The game was played on 3 June 2017 between Italian club Juventus and Spanish club Real Madrid, in a repeat of the 1998 final; Madrid won the match 4–1.|$|E
500|$|Biographer John E. Ferling {{suggests}} that Adams {{made the most}} of juror selection during the jury <b>selection</b> <b>stage</b> of the trial, saying that Adams [...] "expertly exercised his right to challenge individual jurors and contrived what amounted to a packed jury. Not only were several jurors closely tied through business arrangements to the British army, but five ultimately became Loyalist exiles." [...] While benefitting from prosecutorial mismanagement, Adams [...] "performed brilliantly." [...] Hiller B. Zobel is a scholar who has closely studied the trial, and he concluded, [...] "we can be fairly sure that before a single witness had been sworn, the outcome of the trial was certain." [...] Ferling also surmises that Adams may have been encouraged to take the case in exchange for political office; one of Boston's seats opened three months later in the Massachusetts legislature, and Adams was the town's first choice to fill the vacancy.|$|E

40|$|The {{continuous}} need {{to adapt}} to the dynamics of the environment requires employers from both public and private sectors to select qualified human resources. It is people who lead the organization towards performance, and selecting competent employees is critical for competitive success. The paper is focused on the job selection practices implemented by hiring organizations in a developing country. Due to the differences that exist regarding the employee selection policy between public and private organizations, the paper aims to understand the characteristics of the job selection process according to the ownership of the employer agent. Based on a quantitative survey applied on 64 companies, the results analyze the main <b>selection</b> <b>stages</b> implemented in private vs. public sector employers in a developing country. While in private companies the most frequently used <b>selection</b> <b>stages</b> are the job selection interview, CVs screening and trial period, in public institutions the hiring process is based on the job selection interview, written knowledge tests, and practical tests. Compared to private companies, in public institutions the written knowledge tests rank a higher position in the <b>selection</b> <b>stages</b> hierarchy, but the private employers rely more on CVs screening stage than public institutions. Emphasis is laid on understanding the reasons leading to variations in job selection practices according to the ownership of the employing agent. The predictive validity of the job <b>selection</b> <b>stages</b> implemented by the companies is also discussed. </p...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a text localization approach for binarized printed document images. Emphasis {{is given to}} the feature extraction and feature <b>selection</b> <b>stages.</b> In the former, several document structure elements and spatial features, likely to convey useful information, are extracted. In the latter, evolutionary multiobjective feature selection is employed to identify combinations of features with simultaneous good performance in terms of text localization sensitivity and specificity. The selected features are applied to a range of classifiers. Performance results over document image sets from known databases are presented, employing the classifiers with or without feature selection. The results suggest that the hybrid techniques, which utilize the classifiers in combination with the customized pre-processing, feature extraction and feature <b>selection</b> <b>stages,</b> exhibit promising performance on a range of document images. 1...|$|R

The judges then cut the number of acts down to 50. Following a further set of auditions, the number of contestants was narrowed to 24. Originally, the group Trucolorz were chosen by the judges for the final 24 but were disqualified due to one of the group's members being too young for the show, and they were replaced by Harmony Hood.|$|E

50|$|The {{challenge}} in the Simon effect is said to occur during the response <b>selection</b> <b>stage</b> of judgment.

In the stimulus identification stage the participant only needs to be cognitively aware that a stimulus is present. An error would not occur at this stage unless he or she were visually impaired or {{had some sort of}} stimulus deficit. As well, an error or delay cannot occur during the execution state because an action has already been decided upon in the previous stage (the response <b>selection</b> <b>stage)</b> and no further decision making takes place (i.e. you cannot make a change to your response without going back to the second stage).|$|E
