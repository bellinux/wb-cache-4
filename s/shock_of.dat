5|$|Even in {{the absence}} of close contact between {{humanity}} and extraterrestrials, high-information messages from an extraterrestrial civilization to humanity have the potential to cause a great cultural shock. Sociologist Donald Tarter has conjectured that knowledge of extraterrestrial culture and theology has the potential to compromise human allegiance to existing organizational structures and institutions. The cultural <b>shock</b> <b>of</b> meeting an extraterrestrial civilization may be spread over decades or even centuries if an extraterrestrial message to humanity is extremely difficult to decipher.|$|E
5|$|Full-scale armour trials {{revealed}} serious {{weaknesses in}} the proposed protection scheme. The trials employed the obsolete ironclad , modified with armour protection identical to that used by the s then under construction. The deck and turret roof armour proved to be too thin, and the structure supporting the side armour was {{not strong enough to}} withstand the <b>shock</b> <b>of</b> impact from heavy shells.|$|E
5|$|Later, Osborn stumbles upon an old Green Goblin hideout which, again, restores his memory. However, the <b>shock</b> <b>of</b> seeing Harry Osborn hospitalized, overdosed on drugs, causes Osborn's amnesia {{to return}} once more. After the final {{restoration}} of his memories, the Green Goblin kidnaps and takes Gwen Stacy to a bridge. During Spider-Man's rescue attempt, Osborn knocks Gwen off the bridge, {{resulting in the}} girl's death. Spider-Man, traumatised and obsessed with revenge, tracks Green Goblin to his hideout, and in the ensuing battle, Osborn is impaled by his own goblin glider.|$|E

In the event that AC power is lost for normal cooling systems, the pool water begins to absorb heat and boil.|$|E

The video has a similar impromptu charm to the many intimate, one-shot performance clips popularized by Vincent Moon's Take-Away Shows, its appeal compounded by the <b>shock</b> <b>of</b> seeing such a notoriously manicured superstar without embellishment.

40|$|The {{theoretical}} {{properties of}} relativistic, transverse, magnetosonic collisionless shock waves in electron-positron-heavy ion plasmas of relevance to astrophysical sources of synchrotron radiation are investigated. Both 1 D electromagnetic particle-in-cell simulations and quasi-linear theory {{are used to}} examine the spatial and kinetic structure of these nonlinear flows. A new process <b>of</b> <b>shock</b> acceleration <b>of</b> nonthermal positrons, in which the gyrating reflected heavy ions dissipate their energy in the form of collectively emitted, left-handed magnetosonic waves which are resonantly absorbed by the positrons immediately behind the ion reflection region, is described. Applications of the results to the termination <b>shocks</b> <b>of</b> pulsar winds and to the termination <b>shocks</b> <b>of</b> jets emanating from the AGN are outlined...|$|R

We {{establish}} pointwise bounds for the Green {{function and}} consequent linearized stability for multidimensional planar relaxation <b>shocks</b> <b>of</b> general relaxation systems whose equilibrium model is scalar, under the necessary assumption of spectral stability.

Since the new carriage was lighter than that of the M-10, the barrel was fitted with a massive double-baffle muzzle brake DT-3 to soften the <b>shock</b> <b>of</b> recoil. The breech block was of interrupted screw type, the recoil system consisted of a hydraulic buffer and a hydro-pneumatic recuperator. The separately loaded ammunition included a variety of shells and eight different propellant charges in cartridges.|$|E
5|$|The final {{disaster}} for Villiers occurred in November, when Princess Amelia died.

It was the strongest seismic event to hit Nicaragua since {{the earthquake}} of 1972.|$|E

5|$|Another bombshell is {{dropped in}} Dimitri's {{life when he}} finds out that Anton Lang, who he {{believed}} to be the son of two Marick family employees, is really his son with his maid, Corvina Lang (Margaret Sophie Stein). Dimitri had had a drunken one-night stand with Corvina which he had no memory of. Dimitri is happy to finally be a father, but Corvina convinces him not to tell Anton the truth right away. Dimitri attempts to forge relationship with Anton so it will ease the <b>shock</b> <b>of</b> the news. Nevertheless, Anton, who had believed Corvina was his sister, doesn't take the news of his parentage well and marries Kendall to throw it in Dimitri's face. Eventually, Anton sees Kendall for the manipulator that she is and divorces her. Anton and Dimitri manage to work things out before Anton leaves town.|$|E

5|$|As {{her health}} went downhill, Emmeline Pankhurst {{moved into a}} nursing home in Hampstead. She {{requested}} that she be treated by the doctor who attended to her during her hunger strikes. His use of the stomach pump had helped her feel better while in prison; her nurses were sure that the <b>shock</b> <b>of</b> such treatment would severely wound her, but Christabel felt obligated to carry out her mother's request. Before the procedure could be carried out, however, she fell into a critical condition from which none expected her to recover. On Thursday 14 June 1928 Pankhurst died, {{at the age of}} 69. She was interred in Brompton Cemetery in London.|$|E
5|$|Cold shock {{response}} is the physiological response of organisms to sudden cold, especially cold water, {{and is a}} common cause of death from immersion in very cold water, such as by falling through thin ice. The immediate <b>shock</b> <b>of</b> the cold causes involuntary inhalation, which if underwater can result in drowning. The cold water can also cause heart attack due to vasoconstriction; the heart has {{to work harder to}} pump the same volume of blood throughout the body, and for people with heart disease, this additional workload can cause the heart to go into arrest. A person who survives the initial minute after falling into cold water can survive for at least thirty minutes provided they do not drown. The ability to stay afloat declines substantially after about ten minutes as the chilled muscles lose strength and co-ordination.|$|E
5|$|Fairly {{inactive}} in nature, the Japanese sleeper ray {{spends much}} of its time lying buried on the sea floor. It can produce an electric <b>shock</b> <b>of</b> 30–80 volts to ward off predators, which include the blotchy swell shark (Cephaloscyllium umbratile). Its electric organs are composed of electrocytes, which are specialized cells derived from muscle fibers that are filled with a jelly-like substance. These electrocytes are stacked in vertical columns, with many columns making up each electric organ; this arrangement functions essentially like batteries connected in parallel. The diet of the Japanese sleeper ray includes benthic invertebrates. A parasite of this species is the tapeworm Anteropora japonica (Yamaguti, 1934) Subhapradha, 1955.|$|E
