40|$|A {{stock split}} is a {{decision}} by the company‟s board of directors {{to increase the number of}} shares outstanding to its current shareholders. This is considered purely a cosmetic event not having a direct impact on the company‟s valuation. However, empirical findings show that the value of the firm increases when it announces a stock split. The current study employs the standard event study methodology to identify the abnormal returns associated with a stock split announcement. In Sri Lanka, the Companies Act No. 07 of 2007 brought in provisions for <b>splitting</b> <b>of</b> <b>shares.</b> The entirety of announcements from 2008 to November 2012 has been considered for the study. This is a total of 80 announcements relating to 66 companies. Three normal return benchmarks, namely the market-adjusted model, mean-adjusted model and the market model have been used in an attempt to provide a methodological triangulation of results. The study finds significant abnormal returns on the day of announcement that exceed 6 %. Announcements that are contaminated by other contemporaneous firm specific announcements show lower abnormal returns compared to pure stock split announcements. Also there is a positive relationship between the split ratio and the abnormal returns. Finally, abnormal returns experienced during the boom period exceed that of the bust period. The signaling hypothesis, liquidity hypothesis, managerial entrenchment hypothesis and the neglected firm hypothesis all support these findings. The study finds that it is not possible to make arbitrage profits after the first day relative to the announcement day and due to the quick adjustment of prices this study concludes that the CSE is semi-strong form efficient with regard to stock split announcements...|$|E

40|$|International audienceMany {{studies have}} {{examined}} the performance of production systems with shared resources through the application of data envelopment analysis (DEA). The present models are based on the multiplier-type frameworks and resource allocation variables (RAVs) in simple yet edifying network settings, such as multi-component and two-stage structures. Two issues associated with RAVs, however, are relevant to both the theory and practice. First, the existing models with RAVs are nonlinear in general. Second, a potential conflict of interest between a central evaluator (CE) and the managers of decision-making units (DMUs), due to the unknown allocation parameters, has not been addressed. The current study contributes to the resolution of these issues by presenting conflict free models (CFMs). Two striking features of the proposed models include their convenient transformation into linear programs and that they are conflict free. Thus, the manager of a DMU has no basis to argue against the evaluation results by simply claiming that faulty information regarding the <b>split</b> <b>of</b> <b>shared</b> resources has been used, as no such information relating to the CE’s preference or pertaining to RAVs is included in the model formulation. Furthermore, we investigate the relations between CFMs and the existing models, strengthening the interpretations of the existing models. Finally, the proposed models incorporate partial ordering preferences expressed as the cone ratio constraints, which are suitable {{for a wide range of}} real life applications.

40|$|Studies of {{bank branch}} {{performance}} have, to date, concentrated on obtaining a single perspective of efficiency. As {{the financial services}} industry has intensified, banks have increasingly engated in a proactive, differentiated and customer-based strategy in retail banking in which the sales component of the bank branch activity is emphasized. With the emerging sales culture within banks, as discussed earlier, {{there is a need}} to evaluate both sales and service performance. Cook et al. [12] have proposed a model to evaluate simultaneously the sales, service, and aggregate efficiencies of a bank branch. This model accounted for the fact that inputs, in particular resources, are often shared among these functions. In this paper, we extend the data envelopment analysis additive model using goal programming concepts. We thereby derive optimal efficiency scores while taking into account non-volume related activities, that is those involving resources that cannot be assigned to a specific input or output. Again, the proposed model derives an optimal <b>split</b> <b>of</b> the <b>shared</b> resources that maximizes the aggregate efficiency.

40|$|We {{consider}} campaign {{competition in}} which candidates compete for votes among {{a continuum of}} voters by engaging in persuasive efforts that are targetable. Each individual voter is persuaded by campaign effort and votes for the candidate who targets more persuasive effort to this voter. Each candidate chooses a level of total campaign effort and allocates their effort among the set of voters. We completely characterize equilibrium for the majoritarian objective game and compare that to the vote-share maximizing game. If the candidates are symmetric ex ante, both types of electoral competition dissipate the rents from office in expectation. However, the equilibria arising under the two electoral objectives qualitatively differ. In majoritarian elections, candidates randomize over their level of total campaign effort, which provides support for the puzzling phenomenon {{of the emergence of}} supermajorities in majoritarian systems. Vote-share maximization leads to an equilibrium in which both candidates make deterministic budget choices and reach a precise fifty-fifty <b>split</b> <b>of</b> vote <b>shares.</b> We also study how asymmetry between the candidates affects the equilibrium. If some <b>share</b> <b>of</b> the voters is loyal to one of the candidates, then both candidates expend the same expected efforts in equilibrium, but the advantaged candidate wins with higher probability for majoritarian voting or a higher <b>share</b> <b>of</b> voters for vote-share maximization...|$|R
