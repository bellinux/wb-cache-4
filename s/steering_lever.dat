60|$|From a drum {{on top of}} {{the pole}} a thin wire cable ran to the extreme edge of the field and was {{attached}} to the <b>steering</b> <b>lever</b> of a small gasoline tractor. About the tractor two mechanics fluttered. At command from Dick they cranked the motor and started it on its way.|$|E
60|$|He {{was between}} a tree-stem and the saddle, with his {{leg over the}} <b>steering</b> <b>lever</b> and, so {{far as he could}} realise, not hurt. He tried to alter his {{position}} and free his leg, and found himself slipping and dropping through branches with everything giving way beneath him. He clutched and found himself in the lower branches of a tree beneath the flying-machine. The air was full of a pleasant resinous smell. He stared for a moment motionless, and then very carefully clambered down branch by branch to the soft needle-covered ground below.|$|E
60|$|And so {{she drove}} her motor forward {{again and then}} with her firm, white teeth set in grim {{determination}} she drove the <b>steering</b> <b>lever</b> far down to port {{with the intention of}} forcing the nose of her craft straight into the teeth of the wind, and the wind seized the frail thing and toppled it over upon its back, and twisted and turned it and hurled it over and over; the propellor raced for an instant in an air pocket and then the tempest seized it again and twisted it from its shaft, leaving the girl helpless upon an unmanageable atom that rose and fell, and rolled and tumbled--the sport of the elements she had defied. Tara of Helium's first sensation was one of surprise--that she had failed to have her own way. Then she commenced to feel concern--not for her own safety but for the anxiety of her parents and the dangers that the inevitable searchers must face. She reproached herself for the thoughtless selfishness that had jeopardized the peace and safety of others. She realized her own grave danger, too; but she was still unterrified, as befitted the daughter of Dejah Thoris and John Carter. She knew that her buoyancy tanks might keep her afloat indefinitely, but she had neither food nor water, and she was being borne toward the least-known area of Barsoom. Perhaps {{it would be better to}} land immediately and await the coming of the searchers, rather than to allow herself to be carried still further from Helium, thus greatly reducing the chances of early discovery; but when she dropped toward the ground she discovered that the violence of the wind rendered an attempt to land tantamount to destruction and she rose again, rapidly.|$|E

The left and right <b>steering</b> <b>levers</b> are coupled by lever mechanisms and an elongated rod to move in opposite directions. Left and right fore and aft links extend from {{the left and right}} <b>steering</b> <b>levers</b> to the left and right front wheels to transmit steering motion displacement to the steerable front wheels causing rotation of the axles of the wheels about a vertical axis. A controller arm connected to each wheel stub axles is connected to the forward end of a fore and aft link for steering motion of a front wheel. The control arm fore and aft link combination causes each wheel steering motion to have a predetermined relation to motion of the corresponding link...|$|R

40|$|Describes a {{steering}} system in an all-terrain four-wheeled vehicle with independent suspension where the necessary forces for wheels to respond to steering control is supplied by fluid pressure or electrical actuators mounted parallel to the suspension arm between vehicle frame and wheel control arm. Steering control by the driver is by manipulation of right and/or left <b>steering</b> <b>levers</b> eliminating the need of steering wheel and steering column {{in front of the}} driver. The steering actuators are independent and there is no tracking rod or other linkage for coordinating their turning angles. Close coordination of the wheel turning angles for achieving the Ackerman angle relation or other non-linear turning angle relation between the wheels is by a now-linear linkage between left and right <b>steering</b> <b>levers</b> or elsewhere or by a computer control for electric actuators. Optionally, a computer control in an electrical system has inputs for acceleration and velocity for detecting hazards associated with steering and inputs to provide artificial feel signals to the hand levers...|$|R

50|$|In 1896 he {{completed}} another four-wheeled vehicle, {{this time with}} an electric engine. It was derived from a horse-drawncarriage. His last car was built in 1898, an electric Three-wheeler with a single front wheel, allowing {{the use of a}} long <b>steering</b> <b>lever.</b> It had a center-tube frame, and the bodywork was hinged with springs.|$|E
50|$|Sandusky {{also made}} a {{somewhat}} more expensive car, the Courier, with similar specifications, but a steering wheel instead of a <b>steering</b> <b>lever.</b> The 1904 model was advertised at $800, and at $700. The 1905 Courier F was a two-seater roadster that weighed 1100 lb, had a 70-inch wheelbase, wooden body, and steel frame. The engine was one-cylinder and 7 horsepower, with a transmission that had two forward speeds and reverse.|$|E
50|$|It steers {{by the use}} of a {{hydraulic}} ram mounted on the point of articulation. The ram is operated by a steering wheel {{in the same way as}} driving a regular car. It is the only type of tracked vehicle that can be driven on (UK) public roads without a category H track license as it does not need the use of <b>steering</b> <b>levers</b> as in a regular tank.|$|R
50|$|The later {{model used}} a Cletrac-type final drive (instead of the automotive-type {{differential}} unit used previously) {{along with many}} other improvements. The engine was mounted {{on the floor of the}} driving cab with the drive taken through a single plate clutch to the transmission. The transmission had four forward gears and one reverse. The suspension consisted of four large pressed-steel disk wheels on each side, mounted in pairs with elliptic springs. Steering involved upright <b>steering</b> <b>levers</b> to four hydraulic brakes on the sprockets and idlers. A spring-loaded pintle was fitted at the rear, and towing hooks were fitted in the front. It had a speed of about 30 km/h.|$|R
50|$|Steering was {{accomplished}} through a seven-speed AK 7-200 synchromesh gearbox, designed by Zahnradfabrik Friedrichshafen (ZF), and a MAN single radius steering system, operated by <b>steering</b> <b>levers.</b> Each gear had a fixed radius of turning, ranging from 5 m for 1st gear up to 80 m for 7th gear. The driver {{was expected to}} judge the sharpness of a turn {{ahead of time and}} shift into the appropriate gear to turn the tank. The driver could also engage the brakes on one side to force a sharper turn. This manual steering was a much simplified design, compared to the sophisticated dual-radius hydraulically controlled steering system of the Tiger tanks.|$|R
50|$|In 1895 {{followed}} a prototype automobile that featured a 2 bhp (ca. 1,5 kW) gasoline engine by American that gave its power via a chain {{to the left}} rear wheel. Speed was controlled by two levers; one sat {{on the right of}} the <b>steering</b> <b>lever.</b> Moving it forward accelerated the vehicle, backwards lowed it. In a vertical position it brought the engine to idle. A second lever behind the seat did the same for reverse. Packard found a buyer for his car before he finished it.|$|E

50|$|The {{drive train}} {{consists}} of twin GMC Model 302 6-cylinder inline petrol engines, each developing 146 hp at 3600 rpm. Both engines were {{directly connected to}} a Hydramatic model 301MG transmission (early models used 300MG) with four forward speeds and one reverse. Steering is through controlled differential via <b>steering</b> <b>levers</b> at the drivers station. The track is driven by a drive sprocket at the front. There are five road wheels per side, along with three return rollers. The vehicle uses torsion bar suspension and has shock absorbers on {{the first and last}} road wheel. The vehicle has a top road speed of about 32 miles per hour, considerably less than that of its M75 predecessor.|$|R
50|$|Panhard & Levassor {{designed}} a complete automobile. Levassor mounted an engine (Daimlers) {{over the front}} axle, giving better balance and turning.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a drowsiness on-line detection system for monitoring driver fatigue level under real driving conditions, {{based on the}} data of steering wheel angles (SWA) collected from sensors mounted on the <b>steering</b> <b>lever.</b> The proposed system ﬁrstly extracts approximate entropy (ApEn) featuresfromﬁxedslidingwindowsonreal-timesteeringwheelanglestimeseries. Afterthat, this system linearizes the ApEn features series through an adaptive piecewise linear ﬁtting using a given deviation. Then, the detection system calculates the warping distance between the linear features series of the sample data. Finally, this system uses the warping distance to determine the drowsiness state of the driver according to a designed binary decision classiﬁer. The experimental {{data were collected from}} 14. 68 h driving under real road conditions, including two fatigue levels: “wake” and “drowsy”. The results show that the proposed system is capable of working online with an average 78. 01 % accuracy, 29. 35 % false detections of the “awake” state, and 15. 15 % false detections of the “drowsy” state.

5|$|The final {{official}} designation, assigned in 1938, was PanzerkampfwagenI (M.G.) {{with special}} ordnance number Sd.Kfz. 101. The first 150 tanks (1./LaS, 1st series LaS, Krupp-Traktor), produced in 1934, {{did not include}} the rotating turret and were used for crew training. Following these, production was switched to the combat version of the tank. The Ausf.A was under-armoured, with steel plate of only 13millimeters (0.51in) at its thickest. The tank had several design flaws, including suspension problems, which made the vehicle pitch at high velocities, and engine overheating. The driver was positioned inside the chassis and used conventional <b>steering</b> <b>levers</b> to control the tank, while the commander was positioned in the turret where he also acted as gunner. The two crewmen could communicate by means of a voice tube. Machine gun ammunition was stowed in five bins, containing various numbers of 25-round magazines. 1,190 of the Panzerkampfwagen I Ausf. A were built in three series (2.-4./LaS). Further 25 were built as command tanks.|$|R

40|$|Describes a {{steering}} system for a wheeled vehicle, particularly one with independent suspension of the steerable wheels. This {{is characterized by the}} lack of any necessity for a direct physical linkage between steering control arms of the left and right wheels and by the use of separate, independent fluid pressure cylinder pairs connected by fluid pressure conduit for imparting motion to the respective steerable wheels. Coordination between the angular motion of the left and right steerable wheels is attained by a direct mechanical linkage between actuator members of the hydraulic cylinders remote from the wheel suspension which linkage can be arranged for non-linear relative motion that will result in desired coordinated but unequal motion of left and right steerable wheels. Such linkage between actuator members is operated directly or indirectly by the <b>steering</b> wheel, <b>steering</b> <b>levers,</b> or other device. Preferably the fluid pressure cylinders connected to steering control arms of the wheels extend substantially parallel to suspension arms of the wheel suspension, and fluid pressure lines to such cylinders are flexible hoses which permit wide angle motion of the independent wheel suspension. Each fluid pressure cylinder may include between its ports a by-pass conduit and a valve releases the constraint between the interconnected fluid pressure cylinders. This facilitates alignment of the vehicle wheels or other adjustments. Preferably the fluid pressure system is pressurized at over 100 psi...|$|R
