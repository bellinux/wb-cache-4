Principal photography for the episode commenced on October 6, 2011, while the fifth episode, [...] "The First Time" [...] was still shooting; It was initially filmed in parallel with that episode, which continued through October 14, 2011, and also with the seventh episode, which began filming on October 13, 2011. This episode marked the 300th musical number Glee has filmed, which was a mash-up of two Adele songs: [...] "Rumour Has It" [...] and [...] "Someone Like You", with lead vocals by Amber Riley and Naya Rivera. The performance was filmed with great fanfare [...] "in {{front of an audience}} of press and crew members" [...] on October 26, 2011, and included a press briefing afterward.

500|$|You {{know how}} many verses I did for that song. I did a version of that before her album [...] even came out. I did two verses. I love these verses too, but they ended up going with André's verse and André killed it. [...] Then [...] reached out to me and <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> get on the remix. I did two more verses. Out of the second set that I did, she picked the first verse. But my second verse, I just gotta say for the record… It was just too long, I think {{she was looking for}} {{something}} shorter and more to the point. [...] It's just a blessing to even be able to work with [...] I'm on my defensive rapper, like yo man. When you follow in André's 3000's shoes, you're expected to really go in. Just the fact to even be on the song with her and shoot the video with her and just be in her presence. She's such a hard working, incredible artist. I’ll never forget that day we shot the video, I'll never forget being able to be on that song, and hopefully we got more as time goes on[...]|$|E
500|$|On 19 December David Smith, then 38, also {{returned}} to the moor. He spent about four hours helping police pinpoint areas where he thought more bodies might be buried. Topping continued to visit Hindley in prison, along with her solicitor Michael Fisher and her spiritual counsellor, the Reverend Peter Timms, {{who had been a}} prison governor before resigning to become a minister in the Methodist Church. She made a formal confession to police on 10 February 1987, admitting her involvement in all five murders, but news of her confession was not made public for more than a month. The tape recording of her statement was over 17hours long; Topping described it as a [...] "very well worked out performance in which, I believe, she told me just as much as <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> know, and no more". He also commented that he [...] "was {{struck by the fact that}} she was never there when the killings took place. She was in the car, over the brow of the hill, in the bathroom and even, in the case of the Evans murder, in the kitchen". Topping concluded that he felt he [...] "had witnessed a great performance rather than a genuine confession".|$|E

500|$|Madonna also enlisted American {{professional}} boxer Mike Tyson to give {{a speech}} that would be used on the track. According to the singer, [...] "I was thinking: who is in my eyes super iconic, who do I look up to, who is alive today that's been through what I feel like I've been through, that's been through a lot, survived, has stories to tell, has evolved as human being [...] is a survivor, his name came to mind right away." [...] She also revealed that she was moved and impressed after seen his HBO-documentary [...] "Mike Tyson: Undisputed Truth", directed by Spike Lee and contacted him. Tyson revealed that he ad-libbed his part of the song in one take and was inspired by Benito Mussolini, who Tyson admitted that was seen as arrogant, but he tried to come from a positive perspective and be uplifting. In an interview for Rolling Stone he explained: [...] "I didn't know what the hell I was going there for. I'm just there having a good time and hanging out with Madonna. She has her producer there and I go into the studio and I didn't know if <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> talk or rap. I just go in there and start talking. I'm talking about my life and things that I have endured. I'm saying some really crazy stuff. It was really intense." ...|$|E
2500|$|At 21, {{he married}} a Georgian, Fran Cook, and when their son, Joel, was born a year later, he shifted from playing rock bands to {{learning}} the music business via Liberty Records' publishing division. The Liberty job got him to Los Angeles and {{made it easier to}} [...] "pitch his own tunes" [...] to record producers. [...] "One day Fran decided to do her own thing and <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> do mine." [...] They divorced, and she returned to Atlanta, where she still lives with Joel.|$|E

During the reconciliation rally of 1997, the two women made speeches together. But later their friendship broke up, with Eckford reflecting, [...] " [...] wanted me to be cured and be over it and for this not to go on anymore. <b>She</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> be less uncomfortable so that she wouldn't feel responsible." [...] In 1999, President Bill Clinton presented the nation’s highest civilian award, the Congressional Gold Medal, {{to the members of the}} Little Rock Nine.|$|E

6000|$|... "No," [...] said he {{somewhat}} lackadaisically; [...] "I {{suppose that}} would be the best, but Charlotte thinks another plan might be joined with it. <b>She</b> <b>wants</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> marry you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your wife sent me," [...] {{said the}} tall man briskly, [...] "My name's Thompson--Dr. Thompson. She says you've got a case of small-pox on board which <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> see." ...|$|R
2500|$|On 20 April 1932, the Lytton Commission {{arrived in}} Manchuria to begin its {{investigation}} to establish if Japan had committed aggression or not. Puyi {{was interviewed by}} Lord Lytton, and recalled thinking {{that at the time}} that he desperately wanted to ask Lytton for political asylum in Britain, but as General Itagaki was sitting right next to him at the meeting, he told Lytton that [...] "the masses of the people had begged me to come, that my stay here was absolutely voluntary and free". After the interview, Itagaki told Puyi: [...] "Your Excellency's manner was perfect; you spoke beautifully". The diplomat Wellington Koo, who was attached to the Lytton Commission as its Chinese assessor received a secret message saying that [...] "...a representative of the imperial household in Changchun wanted to see me and had a confidential message for me". The representative, posing as an antique dealer, who [...] "...told me he was sent by the Empress: <b>She</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> help her escape from Changchun. He said she found life miserable there because she was surrounded in her house by Japanese maids. Every movement of hers was watched and reported". Koo said he was [...] "touched", but he could do nothing to help Wanrong escape, which her brother Rong Qi said was the [...] "final blow" [...] to her, leading her into a downward spiral. Right from the start, the Japanese occupation had sparked much resistance by guerrillas, whom the Kwantung Army called [...] "bandits". General Doihara was able for in exchange for a multi-million bribe to get one of the more prominent guerrilla leaders, the Hui Muslim general Ma Zhanshan to accept Japanese rule, and had Puyi appoint him Defense Minister. Much to the intense chagrin of Puyi and his Japanese masters, Ma's defection turned to be ruse, and only months after Puyi appointed him Defense Minister, Ma took his troops over the border to the Soviet Union to continue the struggle against the Japanese.|$|E
60|$|HER HUSBAND. I got {{a message}} from Georgina. <b>She</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> go to her.|$|E
60|$|I {{was taken}} aback. I {{reflected}} that I had only seen him once. I {{did not know}} what <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> do.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] said Ethel, [...] "Miss Winter {{has been}} talking to you. I know {{she said she would}} tell you that <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> give up Cocksmoor. You aren't dreaming of it, Margaret?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, God {{bless the}} girl, what does <b>she</b> <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> say? And as for joking, surely that is {{innocent}} enough. You're as tender about the doctor {{as though he}} were a girl of seventeen." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll {{engage with}} you in respect to my aunt exactly <b>to</b> what <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> of <b>me</b> in respect <b>to</b> you. <b>She</b> <b>wants</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> choose. Very well, I will choose. I'll wash my hands of her for you to just that tune." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "To be frank, I {{have asked}} myself the question, and couldn't be quite {{sure it was}} {{altogether}} because <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> get this unfortunate steamboat off." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mamma {{wanted us}} to come back," [...] {{explained}} Dora. [...] "She says, {{even if we do}} lose that fortune <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> have a better education, and she will pay the bill for Nellie and Grace, too." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "No, it was--Miss Nash, {{the artist}} I told you about, asked <b>me</b> <b>to</b> meet {{her at the}} boat. I suppose <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> help her with her baggage and the customs and all them things. She's just coming from Paris." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I hope not," [...] said Clifford. [...] "He has {{n't said}} so--in so many words--to me. But I know it worries him; and I want to stop {{worrying}} him. The Baroness knows it, and <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> stop, too." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Oh, I see! She 's {{told you}} about it? Well, then, {{if you want to}} please her, you'll learn a hymn right off. Come, now, <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> be clever to you, and I'd like to do it; but if you get peppery, how can I?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know what}} <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> do," [...] he said, whining most dolefully. [...] "She <b>wants</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> go after that horrid old Grimes.
