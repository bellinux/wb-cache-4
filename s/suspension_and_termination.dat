40|$|This {{contribution}} aims to {{show that}} the dominance of formalism in treaty law is much more nuanced and qualified than the general perception sketched out in the preceding paragraph suggests. It will be argued that from its making to its termination, a treaty see-saws between formalism and flexibility, and that the body of rules designed by international lawyers to regulate the life of treaties mirrors this constant oscillation: the law of treaties, as codified in the two Vienna Conventions, displays both formal rationality and flexibility. This chapter aims to shed some light on the various, and disparate, features of this fundamental tension. It is more specifically submitted here that the oscillation between formal rationality and flexibility comes to a head at three different levels: at the moment of the creation of the treaty, at the moment of its validation and identification as a treaty properly so-called and, finally, at the moment of its application, that is when the provisions of a treaty are confronted with the facts and accordingly need to be interpreted. At each of these stages, the tension between formal structures and flexibility is solved according to a different equilibrium. The different balances struck are themselves unstable and {{in a constant state of}} flux, for they are treaty-dependent and have not been definitively concretized by the rules of the Vienna Conventions. It is true that the constant oscillation between formalism and flexibility also infuses the rules on <b>suspension</b> <b>and</b> <b>termination.</b> However, as <b>suspension</b> <b>and</b> <b>termination</b> form the subject of a separate contribution, the ‘un-making’ of treaties will be addressed only briefly...|$|E

40|$|Provide a brief {{description}} of the issue and reason for the proposed amendment. If possible, provide a qualitative and quantitative assessment of the impacts of the issue on you and the IESO-administered markets. Include the Chapter and Section number of the relevant market rules. Background The market rules (sections 6. 3, 6. 4, 6. 5 of Chapter 3) provide for the <b>suspension</b> <b>and</b> <b>termination</b> of a market participant and disconnection of a facility for financial events of default and for persistent breaches of the market rules. The recent insolvencies of two market participants exposed gaps in the market rules relating to suspension, termination and disconnection for events of default. Among other things, these gaps create a risk that the market may be required to “carry ” a defaulting market participant for an extended period of time. The IESO is seeking to reduce this risk by streamlining the process and limiting or removing measures that duplicate legal protections available to a defaulting market participant outside of the market rules. At its meeting on June 28, 2007 the IESO Board reviewed these issues and provided a preliminary policy direction that the IESO undertake stakeholder consultation on amendments to the market rules to address these gaps identified and bring forward these amendments to the IESO Board for its review and consideration later in 2007. The IESO Board also directed the IESO to establish predetermined criteria for those instances in which the IESO seeks to convert an existing market rule obligation (shall) into a market rules permission (may). This would provide greater transparency to market participants with respect to the IESO’s process for invoking that discretion...|$|E

The appellant was appointed as a teacher in a Primary School run by a trust and receiving grant in aid, which included rent for the building. In 2005, the Municipal Corporation raised a tax bill of Rs. 79, 974 /-treating the said property as commercial. Thereupon, the Headmistress of the school, who was also President of the Trust, addressed a letter to all the employees including the appellant requiring them to contribute a sum of Rs. 1500 /- per month towards the tax liability. The appellant refused to comply with the said dictate. The management issued as many as 25 memos to the appellant and then placed her under suspension by letter dated 14. 11. 2006. She was not even paid subsistence allowance. The management issued notice dated 28. 12. 2006 for holding an inquiry against the appellant under rr. 36 and 37 of the Maharashtra Employees of Private Schools (Conditions of Service) Rules, 1981. The appellant’s nominee was not allowed to participate in the inquiry proceedings, which were conducted ex parte. Ultimately, the appellant’s services were terminated by order dated 15. 6. 2007.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{addresses}} the question how foreign policy fits within the constitutional {{structure of the}} European Union. It does so by analysing, in the particular field of foreign policy, certain key constitutional concepts, principles, and legal techniques that are fundamental to the legal organisation of the Union. The study {{is divided into three}} parts. The first part examines {{the way in which the}} principles of conferral and primacy, as well as the Community method operate within Community external relations, as compared to their operation with respect to internal Community policies (for instance, exclusivity as the typical expression of the primacy principle in the field of external relations). The second part draws a further contrast between these concepts, principles, and legal techniques as they apply in relation to the common foreign and security policy and their operation under Community external relations. The subject of the third part are constitutional concepts, principles, and legal techniques, which, in practice, have been found to have a more significant part to play in Union foreign policy than in its internal policies, in particular the principle of consistency, or which have developed specifically in the field of external relations, in particular the technique of mixity. Essentially, therefore, this is a study of the extent to which foreign policy is legally sui generis within the sui generis constitutional order of the European Union, and of how the common foreign and security policy is in turn sui generis within the foreign policy structure of the Union. It is not of course suggested that the constitutional concepts, principles, and legal techniques that are here analysed are the only significant ones in the constitutional organisation of the Union, just that they are particularly suited to illustrate the sui generis character of the legal arrangements that govern the conduct of EU foreign policy. The present study provides both an analysis of the constitutional reality of EU foreign policy and theoretical reflections at a critical distance, which suggest possibilities for reform.

European Social Charter considers the right to strike as a means of ensuring collective bargaining. The right to strike is even enshrined in the Constitution, and the ILO Conventions. In our law system, the exercise of the strike is governed by the Labor Code and Law no. 168 of 1999 regarding labor disputes, which states in detail the conditions of organization, release and deployment of the strike, pre-initiation procedures, <b>suspension</b> <b>and</b> its <b>termination.</b> The right to strike can be exercised only under certain conditions, regarding the depletion of the possibility in advance prior to settlement of conflict of interest, a bond meeting of a minimum number of employees and bringing the decision to the employing unit knowledge. Employee participation to strike is free, and the law regulations constraint penalizing a person for the purposes of participating or not to strike and protect the salaries of striking workers.
