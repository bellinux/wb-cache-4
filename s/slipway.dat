5|$|A {{temporary}} <b>slipway</b> {{was built}} at the New Admiralty Shipyard in January 1871 and construction of Novgorod, named after the city, began on 13 April. Using two shifts to speed construction, her hull was completed by 29 December, when the official keel-laying ceremony was held. Within two weeks it was disassembled, and the first shipment of parts arrived at Nikolaev on 2 April 1872. Reassembly began on a specially-prepared <b>slipway</b> eight days later. As there was no rail line between Saint Petersburg and Nikolaev, the components had to be railed to Odessa, where they were transshipped onto river barges and steamers. The boilers were too large {{and had to be}} shipped by freighter from the Baltic Sea to Odessa for transshipment. Construction was delayed by late deliveries of parts and the workforce's lack of experience; the ship was finally launched on 2 June 1873, with Grand Duke Konstantin Nikolayevich in attendance. Novgorods guns were mounted in September, and she entered service the following year, at a cost of 2,830,000 rubles.|$|E

50|$|The ferry {{was moved}} in 1873 {{due to the}} {{expansion}} of Cumberland Basin, with new <b>slipways</b> built {{on both sides of the}} river. At low tide, the crossing was a bridge of boats rather than a ferry. The toll was 1d, due to the tidal nature of the crossing and the need to clean the <b>slipways</b> of mud after each high tide. The ferry ceased operation on 31 December 1932. The <b>slipways</b> are still occasionally visible at low tide.|$|R

5|$|Ajax, {{the fourth}} ship {{of her name}} {{to serve in the}} Royal Navy, was named for the mythological hero. The ship was laid down on 21 March 1876 in No. 4 <b>Slipway,</b> Pembroke Dockyard, Wales, and was {{launched}} on 10 March 1880 by Mrs. George Parkin, wife of the dockyard's Captain-Superintendent. She was completed on 30 March 1883 at a cost of £548,393.|$|E
5|$|In 2004 the Vauxhall Cross {{area at the}} {{southern}} end of the bridge was redeveloped as a major transport interchange, combining a large bus station with the existing National Rail and London Underground stations at Vauxhall. Immediately to the east of {{the southern}} end of the bridge, a <b>slipway</b> provides access for amphibious buses between the road and river.|$|E
5|$|The Yugoslavs re-launched Split in March 1950 {{to free up}} the <b>slipway,</b> but {{no other}} work was done. In 1953 there was a {{rapprochement}} with the NATO powers and the American and the British agreed to help complete the ship. The Tosi machinery ordered earlier had been used for other ships so the British agreed to furnish her propulsion machinery while the Americans provided the ship's armament, fire-control equipment and electronics.|$|E

5|$|After {{his victory}} in the Spanish Civil War, Francisco Franco's plans for the Spanish Navy {{included}} the acquisition of four modern battleships, and {{a variation on the}} Italian s was the favored candidate to fill the requirement. In late 1939, a Spanish mission to Italy received assurances of technical support for the construction of ships of the class in Spanish yards, and a <b>slipway</b> of sufficient size to construct two ships at a time was built at Ferrol. However, Italy's entry into the Second World War in 1940, combined with the limited resources of Spain, led to the cancellation of the project.|$|E
5|$|HMS Audacious {{was ordered}} on 29 April 1867 from Robert Napier in Govan, Glasgow. She was laid down on 26 June 1867 and {{launched}} on 27 February 1869 in a gale. The winds caught {{the rear of}} the ship as she was about halfway down the <b>slipway</b> and twisted her enough that some plates and frames of her bottom were damaged. The ship was completed on 10 September 1870 and commissioned the following month. She cost £256,291 to build.|$|E
5|$|Illinois {{was ordered}} on 9 September 1940, and {{initially}} laid down on 6 December 1942. However, work was suspended pending {{a decision on}} whether to convert the hull to an aircraft carrier. Upon determination the result would cost more and be less capable than building from scratch construction resumed, but was canceled for good approximately one-quarter complete on 11 August 1945. She was sold for scrap and broken up on the <b>slipway</b> in September 1958.|$|E
50|$|On 9 December 1896 {{during a}} visit to the station, the RNLI’s District Inspector, Engineer and Architect {{suggested}} that the lifeboat should be moved on to the town's iron jetty and be launched from <b>slipways</b> which should be constructed {{on either side of the}} jetty. An agreement between the Margate Pier and Harbour Company was reached and plans were agreed upon for two <b>slipways</b> operating two lifeboats. Following tenders the estimate of £3045 from Thomas Gibson of Westminster for the erection of the <b>slipways.</b> A storm occurred during the construction causing damage and revealing shortfalls in the design, and after inspection by the architect and engineers, it was apparent that revisions were required. The upper decks of the <b>slipways</b> were raised 18 inches more than the original specifications. With these problems and subsequent wrangling with the RNLI, the local committee and the harbour company delayed the completion for some time. The <b>slipways</b> designated Stations 1 and 2, were declared open by Rt. Hon. James Lowther the MP for Thanet on 14 May 1898. Early on the same day the two new lifeboats were handed over to the station and were christened Civil Service No.1 (ON 415) on station No.2, and Eliza Harriet (ON 411) on station No.1.|$|R

5|$|Jun'yōs keel {{was laid}} down by Mitsubishi on <b>Slipway</b> No. 3 at their {{shipyard}} in Nagasaki on 20 March 1939. She was yard number 900 and had the name Kashiwara Maru at that time. The ship was purchased on 10 February 1941 by the Navy Ministry and she was temporarily referred to as No. 1001 Ship (Dai 1001 bankan) to keep her conversion secret. She was launched on 26 June 1941 and commissioned on 3 May 1942 as Jun'yō.|$|E
5|$|Radetzky {{was built}} at the Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino {{dockyard}} in Trieste, the same place where her sister ships were built. She was the second ship of her class to be constructed and her kneel was laid down on 26 November 1907. The teak used on Radetzkys deck was the only material Austria-Hungary had to purchase abroad to build the ship. Radetzky was launched from the <b>slipway</b> on 3 July 1909, and commissioned into the Austro-Hungarian navy on 15 January 1911 and had a crew of 880 to 890 officers and men.|$|E
5|$|The stations' closure also {{forced the}} Tyne Sea Scouts, who had {{operated}} from the North station since 1978, to seek new accommodation. The scouts {{had moved into}} the station when their boat house in Blyth was deemed unsafe and demolished. They had been provided with two site offices, storage in the power station complex, and permission to keep their boats at the North station's jetty, {{at the end of}} which they had a <b>slipway</b> built.|$|E

5|$|Warrior {{was ordered}} on 11 May 1859 from Thames Ironworks and Shipbuilding Company in Blackwall, London. The ship was laid down {{some time after}} 6 June 1859 on the West Ham side of Bow Creek when the P ocean liner Seine was launched, and the <b>slipway</b> was {{reinforced}} to support Warriors weight. Full-scale production of the ship's iron began in August, and the construction probably began in mid-August. Indecision by the Admiralty and frequent design changes caused many delays and nearly drove her builders bankrupt before a grant of £50,000 was awarded to keep them solvent. Her launching on 29 December 1860 was during the coldest winter for 50 years. She was frozen to her <b>slipway</b> and required the use of hydraulic rams, additional tugs, and dockworkers running {{from side to side}} on the upper deck to rock her free. Warrior was commissioned in August 1861 to conduct her sea trials; she was completed on 24 October for £377,292, almost twice the cost of a contemporary wooden ship of the line. Between March and June 1862, defects exposed during her trials were rectified, and damage repaired. Changes included the fitting of a lighter bowsprit and a shorter jib boom, along with the provision of extra heads amidships.|$|E
5|$|Zrínyi {{was built}} at the Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino {{dockyard}} in Trieste, the same place where her sister ships were built earlier. She was laid down on 15 November 1908 and launched from the <b>slipway</b> on 12 April 1910. The teak used on Zrínyis deck was the only material Austria-Hungary had to purchase abroad to build the ship. The ship was completed by 15 July 1911, and on 22 November 1911 she was commissioned into the fleet. She was the last ship of the class to be completed and had a crew of 880 to 890 officers and men.|$|E
5|$|Abdül Kadir was {{the first}} Ottoman pre-dreadnought {{battleship}} to be constructed. She was laid down in 1892 {{at the beginning of}} a small-scale expansion of the Ottoman Navy. Work slowed down considerably once she was framed. By the early 1900s the only progress that had been made was the addition of armor plating around her keel. Once that was finished, work ceased. Construction was planned to resume in 1904 but by that time her keel blocks, which were used to prevent hogging and sagging, had shifted and the ship was considered a total loss. She was scrapped on the <b>slipway</b> in 1914. A model of this ship exists in the Constantinople Naval Museum.|$|E

5|$|Basilicata {{was laid}} {{down at the}} Castellammare {{shipyard}} on 9 August 1913, {{the same day as}} Campania. Both ships were built on the same <b>slipway.</b> They were launched {{less than a year later}} on 23 July 1914. Fitting-out work proceeded more slowly on Basilicata, and she was completed on 1 August 1917, four months after her sister ship. After completion, Basilicata was stationed in Italian Libya. On 13 August 1919, while moored in Tewfik at the southern end of the Suez Canal, one of Basilicatas boilers exploded, which sank the ship. Salvage operations began thereafter, and on 12 September 1920, the ship was refloated. The Regia Marina decided that repairing the ship was not worth the cost, and so on 1 July 1921 she was sold to ship breakers in Suez.|$|E
5|$|Bellona, {{the sixth}} ship of that name, was ordered {{as part of}} the 1907 Naval Programme and was laid down on No. 5 <b>Slipway</b> at Pembroke Royal Dockyard on 15 June 1908 by Mrs. Kingsford, wife of the Captain-Superintendent of the dockyard, Rear-Admiral Henry Kingsford. The ship was {{launched}} on 20 March 1908 by Lady Leonora, wife of John Philips, Baron St Davids. She was completed in February 1910 under the command of Captain Edwyn Alexander-Sinclair, commander of the 2nd Destroyer Flotilla. He was relieved by Captain The Honourable Hubert Brand on 7 February 1911. Captain Reginald Tyrwhitt replaced him on 10 August 1912. The ship had been transferred to the 1st Battle Squadron as of 18 June 1913 and Captain Percy Royds assumed command on 5 July.|$|E
5|$|Cöln and Dresden, {{the only}} two ships to be completed, were {{launched}} on 5 October 1916 and 25 April 1917, respectively.

Magdeburg followed on 17 November 1917; she was nine months from being finished when she was canceled. Leipzig was launched on 28 January 1918 and canceled seven months from completion. Rostock followed on 6 April, and also was seven months away from being finished. Frauenlob, the last ship of the class to be launched, on 16 September, was about thirteen months away from completion when she was canceled. The last three ships were canceled while still on the <b>slipway.</b>|$|E
