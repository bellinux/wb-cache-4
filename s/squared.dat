50|$|<b>Square</b> Stealing - If <b>Square</b> Stealing {{has been}} {{declared}} any player may enter a <b>square</b> that has been fully vacated by its owner. In order to vacate a <b>square,</b> a player must be completely outside the <b>square.</b> In order to claim a <b>square,</b> a player must get both feet inside {{the boundaries of the}} <b>square.</b> If the owner of a <b>square</b> reenters his <b>square</b> before it has been claimed, he'll retain the <b>square.</b> He retains the <b>square</b> by having any body part enter the <b>square.</b> Ties go to the owner (remember, the center has the right to settle disputes). If a <b>square</b> is stolen, the previous owner may claim any open <b>square.</b> If no <b>squares</b> are open, the displaced player is eliminated. If the owner of a <b>square</b> is eliminated while his <b>square</b> is stolen, he is eliminated from play, but his <b>square</b> is still retained by the successful <b>square</b> stealer.|$|R

5|$|Coherent {{units are}} derived units that contain no {{numerical}} factor other than 1—quantities such as standard gravity and density of water are absent from their definitions. In the example above, one newton is the force required to accelerate {{a mass of}} one kilogram by one metre per second <b>squared.</b> Since the SI units of mass and acceleration are kg and m·s−2 respectively and , the units of force (and hence of newtons) is formed by multiplication to give kg·m·s−2.
