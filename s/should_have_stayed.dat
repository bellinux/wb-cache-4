5|$|In his High Court appeal Dietrich was {{represented}} by David Grace, QC. The main argument advanced on Dietrich's behalf was that his trial was a miscarriage of justice, since {{he did not have}} legal representation. He argued that he should have been provided with counsel at public expense, given the seriousness of the crime with which he was charged. Alternatively, he argued that the judge <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>stayed</b> or adjourned the trial until he was able to obtain counsel himself. His argument was based on the common law tradition that an accused is entitled to a fair trial.|$|E

After returning to Pine Valley, Bianca reveals to her brother that Maggie has cheated on her and that the two have broken up. Bianca tells her sister, Kendall Hart Slater, that she <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>stayed</b> in Paris and fought for Maggie, that Maggie is the woman she {{is in love with}} and she never should have come home.|$|E
25|$|We {{all knew}} {{in our hearts}} that Michael was disappointing. We felt that we had {{compensated}} adequately in making a fun, exciting, stylized world. You know, I was disappointed in one aspect: a voiceover from Tom’s sister that we had, which Walter later decided to cut. Um, {{there were a couple}} of things in the narrative that I felt went out that probably <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>stayed</b> in. At the same time, I was myself knocked out by what Walter and (cinematographer) Andy Laszlo and our editor were doing visually on the film. And I felt, as I watched the post-production process going on, I just saw the film getting better and better. More impressive. To the point where I thought it was going to do well. And I thought that we had done what we set out to do. Created the world that we set out to create.... It was a movie that was built to succeed. It’s funny. The movie screened very, very well. I remember, after the first screenings, people told me that I was going to be rich for life. There was tremendous love and confidence.|$|E

500|$|By {{inserting}} her authorial {{voice in}} the tale's epilogue, Potter reveals her uncertainty about the believability of her fantasy, and her uncertainty mars the narrative line which, Kutzer remarks, is analogous to a [...] "comedy sketch that <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>stayed</b> at joke length, but is unwisely stretched into ten minutes of tepid comedy." [...] The notion of having animals shed their skins for laundering provides opportunities for amusing illustrations, but the tale {{does not have a}} strong narrative line to hold it together or to grip the reader's attention. The tale is held together solely by the quaint language and work of the charming central character.|$|E
500|$|At Beauregard's request, {{his allies}} in the Confederate Congress petitioned Davis to restore his command in the West. Davis {{remained}} angry at Beauregard's absence {{and told him he}} <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>stayed</b> at his post even if he had to be carried around in a litter. He wrote, [...] "If the whole world were to ask me to restore General Beauregard to the command which I have already given to General Bragg, I would refuse it." [...] Beauregard was ordered to Charleston and took command of coastal defenses in South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida, replacing Maj. Gen. John C. Pemberton. The latter was promoted to lieutenant general and transferred to command the defenses of Vicksburg, Mississippi.|$|E

In September 2008, Ice {{signed a contract with}} Cleopatra Records, recording the cover album Vanilla Ice Is Back! at the label's request. The album was released on November 4, 2008, and contained covers of songs by Public Enemy, House of Pain, Bob Marley, and Cypress Hill. IGN reviewer Spence D. called the album [...] "an embarrassing endeavor that sounds like it <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>stayed</b> locked inside Ice's studio (or at the very least leaked on YouTube and passed off as a piss take)." [...] On February 27, 2009, Ice performed as part of a joint performance with MC Hammer in Orem, Utah called [...] "Hammer Pants And Ice", which featured twenty four dancers and a full choir.|$|E

500|$|A {{muscle strain}} forced Mackin {{to miss a}} {{pre-season}} friendly against Shrewsbury Town in July 2008 and he returned to pre-season training later that month. He was shown a red card after picking up two yellow cards in his first appearance of 2008–09, which was Wrexham's first match in the Conference Premier, as they beat Stevenage Borough 5–0 at home on 9 August 2008. On reflection, Mackin said [...] "As for the second yellow I felt the ball was there to be won and I thought that's what I did. Looking back now I know I <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>stayed</b> on my feet". He was handed a one-match suspension and returned in a 1–1 draw away to Rushden & Diamonds on 17 August 2008. Mackin scored his first goal {{of the season with}} a 25-yard shot against Grays Athletic, which was Wrexham's only goal in a 2–1 away defeat on 20 September 2008. Despite starting the season as a regular in the team, he found opportunities hard to come by after the arrival of Dean Saunders as manager.|$|E
500|$|After {{returning}} to New York, the New York Dolls played to capacity crowds at venues such as Max's Kansas City and the Mercer Arts Center in what Sylvain called a determined effort to [...] "fake it {{until they could}} make it": [...] "We had to make ourselves feel famous before we could actually become famous. We acted like we were already rock stars. Arthur even called his bass 'Excalibur' after King Arthur. It was crazy." [...] Their performance at the Mercer Arts Center was attended by journalist and Mercury Records publicity director Bud Scoppa, and Paul Nelson, an A executive for the label. Scoppa initially viewed them as an amusing but inferior version of the Rolling Stones: [...] "I split after the first set. Paul stuck around for the second set, though, and after show he called me and said, 'You <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>stayed.</b> I think they're really special.' Then, after that, I {{fell in love with}} them anyway." [...] In March 1973, the group signed a two-album deal with a US $25,000 advance from Mercury. According to Sylvain, some of the members' parents had to sign for them because they were not old enough to sign themselves.|$|E
500|$|After {{graduating from}} Greenwood High School, Miller became {{a student at}} Memphis State University in 1973, {{attending}} with a band scholarship. He played euphonium, but, during his two years at the university, Miller met pianists Donald Brown and James Williams, who {{introduced him to the}} music of well-known players such as Wynton Kelly, Bud Powell, and McCoy Tyner. Still at Memphis State, Miller attended a jazz workshop, where one of the tutors was his future bandleader, Woody Shaw, who stated that they would meet again in two years. They did meet again two years later, and Shaw remembered the young pianist. After leaving university in 1975, Miller took lessons privately in Boston with Madame Margaret Chaloff, who had taught many of the pianists that Miller admired. He later commented that, [...] "I <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>stayed</b> with her longer, [...] but at that time I was so restless, constantly on the move." [...] Miller played with saxophonists Ricky Ford and Bill Pierce in Boston. That winter, Miller was invited to Los Angeles by a school friend and decided to go, to escape the northern cold. He stayed on the West Coast for a year, playing locally in clubs and a church.|$|E

500|$|Gwen Stacy's Spider-Woman has {{received}} critical acclaim from reviewers. Her design {{has also been}} cited as a popular choice for cosplay and fan art after her debut. Evan Narcisse of Kotaku opined that the character design {{is part of what}} made the character so popular and [...] "is one of the best riffs on the Spider-Man motifs in decades." [...] Andrew Wheeler from ComicsAlliance felt that even though Gwen Stacy <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>stayed</b> dead, the costume inspired him to want her back. He also cited it as a potential favorite superhero costume in years. The creative director of Marvel Games, Bill Rosemann, described Gwen Stacy as [...] "one of the greatest modern superhero designs." [...] IGN's Jesse Schedeen, reviewing the first Spider-Gwen issue, felt that the character never came across as merely just a female variant of Peter Parker and was also distinct from Jessica Drew, Spider-Girl, Anya Corazon, and other female-themed Spider costume characters. Jessie Schedeen further felt that Gwen had [...] "her own set of hang-ups and her own brand of humor". Doug Zawisza, writing for Comic Book Resources, described Gwen Stacy as [...] "likeable and humorous, conflicted but determined and quick with a zinger", adding, [...] "Latour gives Gwen real world problems as well as superheroic ones. She has family problems and perception problems." ...|$|E
500|$|Whitney had {{no further}} {{involvement}} with Star Trek until 1976, when {{she happened to}} meet DeForest Kelley at an unemployment office in Van Nuys, Los Angeles. He informed her about a Star Trek convention coming up that was organised by Bjo and John Trimble called Equicon. She received such a reception upon making an appearance there that she was inspired to think more about the series and wanted to appear at more events. In 1977, after reading the back cover of the book Letters to Star Trek by Susan Sackett and finding that [...] "Whatever happened to Grace Lee Whitney?" [...] {{was one of the}} ten most frequently asked queries, Whitney got in touch with Sackett and was invited to meet at Roddenberry's office at Paramount. When he entered, he was happy and excited to see her and immediately offered to bring back Rand for the new television series [...] Roddenberry told her that removing Rand was the biggest mistake he'd made, saying that the character <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>stayed</b> so that [...] "when Captain Kirk came back from having affairs with all these other women on all these other planets – he'd have to deal with [...] What a great plot-thickener that would have been!"

This caused some controversy when both Kurt Bachman and Joey Daub informed that they would have not give permission to include extra material if they were asked.

2500|$|An inquest {{was held}} at North Middlesex Hospital on 7 September 1938, where {{evidence}} showed that the pilot was disobeying orders in flying over the area.

Edmonton was around 12 miles from Hatfield. The inquest heard that the aircraft had been fit to fly and had been flown by other pilots that day.

2500|$|In 1867, William {{attempted}} to sell Luxembourg to France, to both restore the European {{balance of power}} after the unexpected Austrian defeat in the Austro-Prussian War (1866), and alleviate his personal financial troubles. His decision greatly angered Prussia (artificially agitated by Chancellor Otto von Bismarck), triggering the Luxembourg Crisis. Prime Minister Julius van Zuylen van Nijevelt was able to prevent war between Prussia, the Netherlands and France by hosting a conference between the Great Powers, resulting in the Treaty of London (1867). The cabinet was heavily criticised by the liberals in Parliament, because it had threatened the Netherlands' neutrality whilst it <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>stayed</b> out of the matter, which was William's sole responsibility as the Grand Duke of Luxembourg. Parliament rejected the cabinet's foreign budget plans in November, leading the cabinet to offer its resignation to King William, but the furious William decided to dissolve Parliament instead. The newly elected House of Representatives maintained its opposition and again rejected the foreign budget, and approved the motion-Blussé van Oud-Alblas, condemning the needless dissolution of Parliament that had not served the country's interests in any way. This time the cabinet did step down, resulting in a parliamentary victory. The Luxembourg Crisis confirmed the parliamentary system's working, and reduced the royal influence on politics: ...|$|E
2500|$|The most {{controversial}} cuts were the scenes involving Otto, initially a recurring character, {{who had a}} thin Adolf Hitler moustache and spoke with a German accent, shouting accusations of [...] "racial impurity" [...] at people whose conceptions were similar to Brian's (Roman centurion rape of native Judean women), and other Nazi phrases. The logo of the Judean People's Front, designed by Terry Gilliam, was a Star of David with a small line added to each point so it resembled a swastika, most familiar in the West as {{the symbol of the}} anti-Semitic Nazi movement. The rest of this faction also all had the same thin moustaches, and wore a spike on their helmets, similar to those on Imperial German helmets. The official reason for the cutting was that Otto's dialogue slowed down the narrative. However, Gilliam, writing in The Pythons Autobiography by The Pythons, said he thought it <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>stayed,</b> saying [...] "Listen, we've alienated the Christians, let's get the Jews now". Idle himself was said to have been uncomfortable with the character; [...] "It's essentially a pretty savage attack on rabid Zionism, suggesting it's rather akin to Nazism, which is a bit strong to take, but certainly a point of view". Michael Palin's personal journal entries from the period when various edits of Brian were being test-screened consistently reference the Pythons' and filmmakers' concerns that the Otto scenes were slowing the story down and thus were top of the list to be chopped from the final cut of the film. However, Oxford Brookes University historian David Nash says the removal of the scene represented [...] "a form of self-censorship" [...] and the Otto sequence [...] "which involved a character representative of extreme forms of Zionism" [...] was cut [...] "in the interests of smoothing the way for the film's distribution in America." ...|$|E
