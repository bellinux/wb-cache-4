40|$|Abstract. Common R or R-L load do {{not need}} special {{inverter}} circuits, however piezoelectric load {{can be considered as}} R-C load and its voltage does not become 0 even though the applied voltage is 0. Therefore it needs some special inverter with circuit that can discharge the capacitive energy. Especially for unidirectional <b>square-wave</b> <b>voltage</b> driving, it becomes more serious problem. In this paper, an energy recovery circuit for unidirectional <b>square-wave</b> <b>voltage</b> driving for piezoelectric load is proposed. With the circuit, the peak load current and the power supply capacity can be reduced because the energy in the load capacitor is saved to a capacitor for energy recovery and recharged from the capacitor. The appropriateness is proved from the simulation of the proposed circuit...|$|E

40|$|We have {{measured}} {{the dependence of}} the hysteretic voltage-induced torsional strain (VITS) in crystals of orthorhombic tantalum trisulfide on temperature and applied torque. In particular, applying <b>square-wave</b> <b>voltages</b> above the charge-density-wave (CDW) threshold voltage, so as to abruptly switch the strain across its hysteresis loop, {{we have found that}} the time constant for the VITS to switch (at different temperatures and voltages) varied as the CDW current. Application of torque to the crystal could also change the VITS time constant, magnitude, and sign, suggesting that the VITS is a consequence of residual torsional strain in the sample which twist the CDW. Application of voltage changes the pitch of these CDW twists, which then act back on the lattice. However, it remains difficult to understand the sluggishness of the response.

40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{frequency}} and voltage dependence of voltage-induced torsional strains in orthorhombic TaS 3 [V. Ya. Pokrovskii, et al, Phys. Rev. Lett. 98, 206404 (2007) ] by measuring the modulation of the resonant frequency of an RF cavity containing the sample. The strain has an onset voltage below the charge-density-wave (CDW) threshold voltages associated with changes in shear compliance and resistance, suggesting that the strain is associated with polarization of the CDW rather than CDW current. Measurements with <b>square-wave</b> <b>voltages</b> show that the strain is very sluggish, not even reaching its dc value at a frequency of 0. 1 Hz, but the dynamics appear to be very sample dependent. By applying oscillating torque while biasing the sample with a dc current, we have also looked for strain induced voltage in the sample; none is observed at the low biases where the voltage-induced strains first occur, but an induced voltage is observed at higher biases, probably associated with strain-dependent CDW conductance.

The dipping method for the aligning film {{makes it easy}} to prepare the fabricatidn of the cells as compared with the spinning alignment, oblique evaporation and so forth. A glass(ITO) surface coated with polyethylene glycol is rubbed by cotton, felt or gauze to enhance the homogeneous aligrment. Aligning characteristics are examined (1) on the relation of capacitance and the DC bias voltage (C-V) and (Ⅱ) on the relation of light transmittance and the DC bias voltage (T-V).

40|$|We {{have studied}} the charge density wave (CDW) repolarization {{dynamics}} in blue bronze by applying <b>square-wave</b> <b>voltages</b> of different frequencies to the sample and measuring the changes in infrared transmittance, proportional to CDW strain. The frequency dependence of the electro-transmittance was fit to a modified harmonic oscillator response {{and the evolution of}} the parameters as functions of voltage, position, and temperature are discussed. Resonant frequencies decrease with distance from the current contacts, indicating that the resulting delays are intrinsic to the CDW with the strain effectively flowing from the contact. For a fixed position, the average relaxation time has a voltage dependence given by tau_ 0 ~V^-p, with 1 <p< 2. The temperature dependence of the fitting parameters shows that the dynamics are governed by both the force on the CDW and the CDW current: for a given force and position, both the relaxation and delay times are inversely proportional to the CDW current as temperature is varied. The long relaxation and delay times (~ 1 ms) suggest that the strain response involves the motion of macroscopic objects, presumably CDW phase dislocation lines.

It is demonstrated that the excitation of the primary tank resonance, by odd harmonics of the <b>square-wave</b> input <b>voltage,</b> facilitates reduced power dissipation for systems that are subject to long periods of standby operation. Due to the inherent limitations of traditional fundamental mode approximation techniques to predict sub-harmonic resonant peaks, an alternative, steady-state, cyclic-averaging methodology, is proposed, that is shown to provide accurate and rapid analysis of the resonances when the converter is operated under short-circuit conditions, thereby allowing the effects of high electrical components stresses to be mitigated, and eliminates the necessity for time-consuming integration-based simulations. Measurements from a prototype converter, along with simulation results from a derived statevariable model and a component-based simulation package, are used to demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed cyclic predictions, and the reduction in losses imparted by the use of harmonic excitation when compared to other previously published techniques for over-current/short-circuit protection...|$|R
