This fact emphasises the importance of services offered by Public Administrations and in the modern technological era, {{it is essential for}} Information Technology to provide solutions for transforming these traditionally offered services into electronic transactions that could be initiated over the Internet, aiming at the facilitation of the citizen’s life, who is the eventual “client ” of any government. Although public administrations have strived {{over the last few years}} to meet this goal, their individual attempts resulted in isolated, ad-hoc systems, offering a small piece of the whole <b>service</b> <b>bouquet.</b> As the connectivity generated by the Internet is opening new opportunities in service delivery, public administrations are seeking ways to deliver integrated value-adding services though an Interoperable environment. The goal of a systematic service composition, which will guarantee eGovernment Interoperability, can be accomplished with an effective method of modelling the public services, in order to expose their interfaces and their actual workflow. Applying this method in Greek Municipalities by respecting the context of the emerging Greek eGovernment Interoperability Services Framework, various services have been analysed, leading to corresponding generic process patterns...|$|E

6000|$|It was Morgan who {{eventually}} asked if no supper {{had been ordered}} for him; sitting with him below, later, at the dim delayed meal, {{in the presence of}} a great deal of corded green plush, a plate of ornamental biscuit and an aloofness marked on the part of the waiter. Mrs. Moreen had explained that they had been obliged to secure a room for the visitor out of the house; and Morgan’s consolation—he offered it while Pemberton reflected on the nastiness of lukewarm sauces—proved to be, largely, that his circumstance would facilitate their escape. He talked of their escape—recurring to it often afterwards—as if they were making up a “boy’s book” together. But he likewise expressed his sense that there was something in the air, that the Moreens couldn’t keep it up much longer. In point of fact, as Pemberton was to see, they kept it up for five or six months. All the while, however, Morgan’s contention was designed to cheer him. Mr. Moreen and Ulick, whom he had met the day after his return, accepted that return like perfect men of the world. If Paula and Amy treated it even with less formality an allowance was to be made for them, inasmuch as Mr. Granger hadn’t come to the opera after all. He had only placed his box at their <b>service,</b> with a <b>bouquet</b> for each of the party; there was even one apiece, embittering the thought of his profusion, for Mr. Moreen and Ulick. “They’re all like that,” was Morgan’s comment; “at the very last, just when we think we’ve landed them they’re back in the deep sea!” ...|$|R
