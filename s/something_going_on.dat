25|$|Another highly {{classified}} U.S. {{study was}} conducted by the CIA's Office of Scientific Investigation (OS/I) {{in the latter half}} of 1952 in response to orders from the National Security Council (NSC). This study concluded UFOs were real physical objects of potential threat to national security. One OS/I memo to the CIA Director (DCI) in December read: the reports of incidents convince us that there is <b>something</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> that must have immediate attention... Sightings of unexplained objects at great altitudes and traveling at high speeds in the vicinity of major U.S. defense installations are of such a nature that they are not attributable to natural phenomena or any known types of aerial vehicles. The matter was considered so urgent that OS/I drafted a memorandum from the DCI to the NSC proposing that the NSC establish an investigation of UFOs as a priority project throughout the intelligence and the defense research and development community. It also urged the DCI to establish an external research project of top-level scientists, now known as the Robertson Panel to analyze the problem of UFOs. The OS/I investigation was called off after the Robertson Panel's negative conclusions in January 1953.|$|E
25|$|The Eagles' drive {{carried over}} from the {{previous}} quarter. A completed pass and a run moved the Eagles to the 12-yard line. But on third down, Vick was sacked for a 4-yard loss by DT Rocky Bernard, forcing Philadelphia {{to settle for a}} 34-yard field goal from K David Akers. The Giants received the ball and started at their own 21-yard line, whereupon they put together an 8-play, 79-yard drive. RB Ahmad Bradshaw ran three times for 24 yards. The drive ended on Manning's second touchdown pass to Manningham, this one for 33 yards putting the Giants in the driver's seat, 14–3. The Giants once again stopped the Eagles on their next drive and received the ball. Two passes to Hagan for 27 yards and 11-yard run by Bradshaw helped the Giants get to the Eagles 7-yard line. The Giants were unable to score on third down because of an incomplete pass to TE Kevin Boss. The Giants settled for a 25-yard field goal from K Lawrence Tynes to make the score 17–3. The Eagles tried to get <b>something</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> the next drive and it appeared they did when Vick found WR Jeremy Maclin, but the ball came loose before he hit the ground. S Kenny Phillips recovered it and ran it to the Philadelphia 8-yard line. The Eagles called a timeout {{to try to get the}} replay assistant to take a look at the play since it was now under two minutes in the half, but the play was reviewed and it was determined to be a fumble. The Giants took advantage of this and on the next play, Manning found WR Hakeem Nicks for an 8-yard touchdown pass putting the Giants in total control at halftime 24–3.|$|E

While shooting, Nimoy commented that the character [...] "was a unique experience," [...] as he had not acted outside of the Spock character for a number of years.

Natasha later asks Andrew if he loves her, {{but he does}} not reply. In December 2010, Summer and Andrew give into their feelings for each other and have sex. Novakovic said Natasha would be [...] "devastated" [...] if she knew what had happened and that she would not let Andrew and Summer off lightly. Andrew tells Natasha {{that he is going to}} business meeting, but he meets Summer instead. While they are together in Summer's house, a fire breaks out. Natasha sees the smoke and calls her father and the emergency services before entering the house to rescue Summer, unaware Andrew is also there. Novakovic explained Natasha's ordeal: [...] "Natasha is pulled from the fire by her dad, Michael. Andrew and Summer are rescued separately, and Natasha has no idea of the reason why Andrew was in the house - he was cheating on her with Summer!" [...] After the rescue, Natasha has to come to terms with the fact she will be scarred from a burn she sustains on her neck. Novakovic said that it is a [...] "big deal" [...] for Natasha, as she aspires to be a model and this could ruin her chances. Novakovic also opines that Summer wants nothing more than to be with Andrew, but how can she take him when Natasha tried to save her? Novakovic believed Natasha was blasé to their feelings adding [...] "Deep down, I think Natasha knows that there's <b>something</b> <b>going</b> <b>on,</b> but she doesn't want to admit it to herself.

Roger Ebert stated that V for Vendetta [...] "almost always has <b>something</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> that is {{actually}} interesting, inviting us to decode the character and plot and apply the message where we will". Margaret Pomeranz and David Stratton from At the Movies stated that despite the problem of never seeing Weaving's face, there was good acting and an interesting plot, adding that the film is also disturbing, with scenes reminiscent of Nazi Germany. Jonathan Ross from the BBC blasted the film, calling it a [...] "woeful, depressing failure" [...] and stating that the [...] "cast of notable and familiar talents such as John Hurt and Stephen Rea stand little chance amid {{the wreckage of the}} Wachowski siblings' dismal script and its particularly poor dialogue." [...] Sean Burns of Philadelphia Weekly gave the film a 'D', criticizing the film's treatment of its political message as being [...] "fairly dim, adolescent stuff," [...] as well as expressing dislike for the [...] "barely decorated sets with television-standard overlit shadow-free cinematography by the late Adrian Biddle. The film is a visual insult." [...] On Alan Moore removing his name from the project, Burns says [...] "it's not hard to see why," [...] as well as criticising Portman's performance: [...] "Portman still seems to believe that standing around with your mouth hanging open constitutes a performance." [...] Harry Guerin from the Irish TV network RTÉ states the film [...] "works as a political thriller, adventure and social commentary and it deserves to be seen by audiences who would otherwise avoid any/all of the three". He added that the film will become [...] "a cult favourite whose reputation will only be enhanced with age." [...] Andy Jacobs for the BBC gave the film two stars out of five, remarking that it is [...] "a bit of a mess... it rarely thrills or engages as a story." ...|$|E

At this time, the reports of incidents convince us that there is <b>something</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> that must have immediate attention. The details of some of these incidents have been discussed by AD/SI with DDCI.

[...] "We always {{put on a show}} ... I mean it just wasn't us up there pickin' and singing. There was <b>something</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> all the time." [...] "... the demonstrative Maddoxes, helped release white bodies from traditional motions of decorum... more and more younger white artists began to behave on stage like the lively Maddoxes."

2500|$|His {{reason is}} that it puts the {{entities}} about which we require knowledge behind a [...] "veil of perception", an occult field of [...] "appearance" [...] which leaves us ignorant of the reality presumed to be beyond it. He is convinced that such uncertainty propels into the dangerous regions of relativism and solipsism: relativism sees all truth {{as determined by the}} single observer; solipsism, in which the single observer is the only creator of and legislator for his or her own universe, carries the assumption that no one else exists. These accusations constitute a powerful ethical argument against qualia being <b>something</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> in the brain, and these implications are probably largely responsible for {{the fact that in the}} 20th century it was regarded as not only freakish, but also dangerously misguided to uphold the notion of sensations as going on inside the head. The argument was usually strengthened with mockery at the very idea of [...] "redness" [...] being in the brain: the question was—and still is—"How can there be red neurons in the brain?" [...] which strikes one as a justifiable appeal to common sense.|$|E
2500|$|The CIA {{started their}} own {{internal}} scientific review the following day. Some CIA scientists were also seriously considering the ETH. An early memo from August was very skeptical, but also added, [...] "...as {{long as a}} series of reports remains 'unexplainable' (interplanetary aspects and alien origin not being thoroughly excluded from consideration) caution requires that intelligence continue coverage of the subject." [...] A report from later that month was similarly skeptical but nevertheless concluded [...] "...sightings of UFOs reported at Los Alamos and Oak Ridge, {{at a time when the}} background radiation count had risen inexplicably. Here we run out of even 'blue yonder' explanations that might be tenable, and we still are left with numbers of incredible reports from credible observers." [...] A December 1952 memo from the Assistant CIA Director of Scientific Intelligence (O/SI) was much more urgent: [...] "...the reports of incidents convince us that there is <b>something</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> that must have immediate attention. Sightings of unexplained objects at great altitudes and traveling at high speeds in the vicinity of U.S. defense installation are of such nature that they are not attributable to natural phenomena or known types of aerial vehicles." [...] Some of the memos also made it clear that CIA interest in the subject was not to be made public, partly in fear of possible public panic. (Good, 331–335) ...|$|E
2500|$|For Kierkegaard, true {{individuality}} {{is called}} selfhood. Becoming {{aware of our}} true self is our true task and endeavor in life—it is an ethical imperative, as well as preparatory to a true religious understanding. Individuals can exist {{at a level that}} is less than true selfhood. We can live, for example, simply in terms of our pleasures—our immediate satisfaction of desires, propensities, or distractions. In this way, we glide through life without direction or purpose. To have a direction, we must have a purpose that defines for us the meaning of our lives. Kierkegaard puts it this way in Either/Or, Here, then, I have your view of life, and, believe me, much of your life will become clear to you if you will consider it along with me as thought-despair. You are a hater of activity in life-quite appropriately, because {{if there is to be}} meaning in it life must have continuity, and this your life does not have. You keep busy with your studies, to be sure; you are even diligent; but it is only for your sake, and it is done with as little teleology as possible. Moreover, you are unoccupied; like the laborers in the Gospel standing idle in the marketplace, you stick your hands in your pocket and contemplate life. Now you rest in despair. Nothing concerns you; you step aside for nothing; “If someone threw a roof tile down I would still not step aside.” You are like a dying person. You die daily, not in the profound, earnest sense in which one usually understands these words, but life has lost its reality and you “Always count the days of your life from one termination-notice to the next.” You let everything pass you by; nothing makes any impact. But then something suddenly comes along that grips you, an idea, a situation, a young girl’s smile, and now you are “involved,” for just on certain occasions you are not “involved,” so at other times you are “at your service” in every way. Wherever there is <b>something</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> you join in. You behave in life as you usually do in a crowd. “You work yourself into the tightest group, see to it, if possible, to get yourself shoved up over the others so that you come to be above them, and as soon as you are up there you make yourself as comfortable as possible, and in this way you let yourself be carried through life.” But when the crowd is gone, when the event is over, you again stand on the street corner and look at the world.
