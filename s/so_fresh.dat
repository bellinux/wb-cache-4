Pryia Elan of NME noted the track [...] "almost falls {{under the weight of}} this persona. There's none of 'Video Games' measured, piano-led reflection.

[...] Baradwaj Rangan, writing for The Hindu, said, [...] "Listen to the lazy drawl with which certain words taper off in ‘Avalukkenna,’ an antidote to the rock ‘n’ roll bounce {{in the rest of the}} song."

But it sure is fun." [...] Writing in The Observer, Penelope Gilliatt noted that [...] "The way the credits are done has the same self-mocking flamboyance as everything else in the picture." [...] Gilliatt {{went on to say that}} the film manages [...] "to keep up its own cracking pace, nearly all the way. The set-pieces are a stunning box of tricks". The critic for The Times wrote of Bond that he is [...] "the secret ideal of the congenital square, conventional in every particular... except in morality, where he has the courage—and the physical equipment—to do without thinking what most of us feel we might be doing..."

Steve [...] "Flash" [...] Juon of RapReviews also praised its sound, writing that [...] "Cuts are provided with infinite skill and precision by DJ Q-Bert" [...] and that the DJ Shadow/Automator remix of [...] "Waiting List" [...] is [...] "so good that you could hardly miss the original, if indeed there was one." [...] An instrumental version of the album was released in 1996 under the title Instrumentalyst (Octagon Beats). Kembrew McLeod of Allmusic wrote of the instrumental album, stating [...] "If any other artist released an album such as this it would be considered throwaway trash—something for the hardcore fans.

500|$|Both Surfer Rosa and Steve Albini's {{production}} of the album have been influential on alternative rock, and on grunge in particular. Nirvana's Kurt Cobain cited Surfer Rosa {{as the basis for}} Neverminds songwriting. When he first heard the album, Cobain discovered a template for the mix of heavy noise and pop he was aiming to achieve. He remarked in 1993 that he [...] "heard songs off of Surfer Rosa that I'd written but threw out because I was too afraid to play them for anybody." [...] Cobain hired Albini to produce Nirvana's 1993 album In Utero, primarily due to his contribution to Surfer Rosa. The Smashing Pumpkins' Billy Corgan described Surfer Rosa as [...] "the one that made me go, 'holy shit'. It was <b>so</b> <b>fresh.</b> It rocked without being lame." [...] Corgan was impressed by the album's drum sound, and acknowledged that The Smashing Pumpkins used to study the record for its technical elements. Musician PJ Harvey said that Surfer Rosa [...] "blew my mind," [...] and that she [...] "immediately went to track down Steve Albini."

500|$|The Sugababes {{collaborated with}} members from Orson to produce two brand new tracks for the album, [...] "Easy" [...] and [...] "Good to Be Gone". Buchanan spoke upon the collaboration, saying: [...] "When we {{started working with}} the Orson guys the sound just blew us away – it's <b>so</b> <b>fresh,</b> but has the same qualities as the biggest songs of our career. It's perfect for this album." [...] Range, however, {{explained}} how she initially {{did not like the}} song in comparison to [...] "Good to Be Gone". After leaving the studio, she called {{the other members of the}} group and spoke of her dissatisfaction with [...] "Easy". Range realised she enjoyed the song after listening to it the following day, and later named it one of her favourite songs by the group. Despite being titled The Singles Collection, the album does not contain all of the group's previous singles; [...] "New Year", [...] "Soul Sound", [...] "Angels with Dirty Faces" [...] and [...] "Follow Me Home" [...] are omitted, although [...] "Run for Cover" [...] is included as a bonus track on the UK version. [...] "Red Dress" [...] was re-recorded to feature the vocals of Berrabah instead of Buena following the latter's departure from the group.|$|E
500|$|The {{order of}} the two victims next after Joseph is also unclear; Rosner puts the {{sequence}} as Abigail Simpson followed by an English male lodger from Cheshire, while Bailey and Dudley Edwards each have the order as the English male lodger followed by Simpson. The unnamed Englishman was a travelling seller of matches and tinder who fell ill with jaundice at Hare's lodging house. As with Joseph, Hare was concerned with the effect this illness might have on his business, and he and Burke employed the same modus operandi they had with the miller: Hare suffocating their victim while Burke lay over the body to stop movement and noise. Simpson was a pensioner {{who lived in the}} nearby village of Gilmerton and visited Edinburgh to supplement her pension by selling salt. On 12 February 1828—the only exact date Burke quoted in his confession—she was invited into the Hares' house and plied with enough alcohol to ensure she was too drunk to return home. After murdering her, Burke and Hare placed the body in a tea-chest and sold it to Knox. They received £10 for each body, and Burke's confession records of Simpson's body that [...] "Dr Knox approved of its being <b>so</b> <b>fresh...</b> but [...] did not ask any questions". In either February or March that year an old woman was invited into the house by Margaret Hare. She gave her enough whisky to fall asleep, and when Hare returned that afternoon, he covered the sleeping woman's mouth and nose with the bed tick (a stiff mattress cover) and left her. She was dead by nightfall and Burke joined his companion to transport the corpse to Knox, who paid another £10.|$|E

Disney truly bridged a generation gap with The Little Mermaid... Now, lightning has definitely struck twice with Beauty and the Beast." [...] Awarding the film a perfect score of four stars, Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times compared Beauty and the Beast positively to Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and Pinocchio, writing, [...] "Beauty and the Beast reaches back to an older and healthier Hollywood tradition in which the best writers, musicians and filmmakers are gathered for a project on the assumption that a family audience deserves great entertainment, too." [...] In 2001 Ebert again gave the IMAX re-release a full 4 out of 4 stars. James Berardinelli of ReelViews rated the film similarly while hailing it as [...] "the finest animated movie ever made", writing, [...] "Beauty and the Beast attains a nearly-perfect mix of romance, music, invention, and animation." [...] The use of computer animation, particularly in the ballroom sequence, was singled out in several reviews as one of the film's highlights. Hal Hinson of The Washington Post gave the film a positive review, calling the film [...] "A delightfully satisfying modern fable, a near-masterpiece that draws on the sublime traditions of the past while remaining completely in sync with the sensibility of its time." [...] Janet Maslin of The New York Times gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "It is a surprise, in a time of sequels and retreads, that the new film is <b>so</b> <b>fresh</b> and altogether triumphant in its own right." [...] Dave Kehr of the Chicago Tribune gave the film three out of four stars, saying [...] "Beauty and the Beast is certainly adequate holiday entertainment for children and their more indulgent parents..... But the film has little of the technical facility, vivid characterization and emotional impact of Disney past." ...|$|E

Duchovny considers [...] "Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose" [...] to be one of his favorite episodes of the third season. Nutter highlighted it {{as one of the most}} enjoyable entries that he had worked on. He also noted that, [...] "the writing was so tight and so crisp and <b>so</b> <b>fresh</b> that I think, as a director, the only thing you have to do is create the atmosphere, set up the characters, set up the shots and you are basically invisible. Then you step back and just let it happen." [...] Series writer and producer Frank Spotnitz stated that the episode worked on many levels and that it is his favorite of the episodes written for the show by Morgan. In 2016, Ira Madison of Vulture.com named it the best episode of the series and [...] "one of the best episodes of television ever", stating that the episode [...] "takes every element that made the series so iconic and throws them all into one heartbreaking installment".|$|E

The singer was a true original, delivering a blend of sensitivity and strength, defiance and tenderness, via a regionally inflected voice. The young man's lips spilled forth words that were realistic without being dour, full of sly humour and beautifully observed detail.
