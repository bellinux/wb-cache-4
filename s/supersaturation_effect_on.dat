40|$|Understanding the {{fundamentals}} {{of the growth of}} nanostructures is key to controlling their size and morphology. This thesis investigated the supersaturation effect as well as other effects on the growth of two one-dimensional nanomaterials - Magnesium hydroxide sulfate hydrate(MHSH) nanobelt and ZnO nanorod. It was found that the supersaturation for the growth of 1 D nanomaterial had to be controlled at low level and it could be controlled through sparingly soluble carbonate salts. To examine the <b>supersaturation</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> one-dimensional nanostructure growth, this study developed a quantitative kinetic model was developed to describe the one-dimensional nanostructure growth. The qualitative investigation and the quantitative model should provide more insight to the processes and some guide-lines for one-dimensional nanostructure growth in the future. This thesis also examines other factors such as agitation and temperature. Some other process parameters can {{have a significant effect on}} the growth process. The Zn(NO 3) 2 and HMT system was used as a model system to demonstrate that agitation had dramatic effects on the final morphology of the nanostructure. Spherical morphology could be obtained through mixing the reaction solution. The building blocks of the nanospheres were similar to those forming the nanorods. Thus, the spherical morphology was believed to result from the breakdown of the free diffusion of building blocks to the growing nanocrystal surface. Ph. D.

40|$|Gas {{supersaturation}} problems {{generated by}} spill from dams on the Columbia River were first {{identified in the}} 1960 s. Since that time, considerable {{research has been conducted}} <b>on</b> <b>effects</b> of gas <b>supersaturation</b> <b>on</b> aquatic life, primarily juvenile salmonids. Also since that time, modifications to dam structures and operations have reduced supersaturated gas levels produced by the dams. The limit for total dissolved gas saturation (TDGS) as mandated by current Environmental Protection Agency water quality standards is 110 %. State management agencies issue limited waivers to water quality, allowing production of levels of up to 120 % TDGS to facilitate the downstream migration of juvenile salmonids. Recently, gas supersaturation as a water quality issue has resurfaced as concerns have grown regarding chronic effects of spill-related total dissolved gas on salmonids, including incubating embryos and larvae, resident fish species, and other aquatic organisms. Because of current concerns, and because the last comprehensive review of research <b>on</b> <b>supersaturation</b> <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> fishes was conducted in 1997, we reviewed recent supersaturation literature to identify new or ongoing issues that may not be adequately addressed by the current 110 % TDGS limit and the 120 % TDGS water quality waiver. We found that recent work supports older research indicating that short-term exposure to levels up to 120 % TDGS does not produce acute <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> migratory juvenile or adult salmonids when compensating depths are available. Monitoring programs at Snake and Columbia river dams from 1995 to the early 2000 s documented a low incidence of significant gas bubble disease or mortality in Columbia River salmonids, resident fishes, or other taxa. We did, however, identify five areas of concern in which total dissolved gas levels lower than water quality limits may produce sublethal <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> fishes of the Columbia River. These areas of concern are 1) sensitive and vulnerable species or life stages, 2) long-term chronic or multiple exposure, 3) vulnerable habitats and reaches, 4) <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> incubating fish in hyporheic habitats, and 5) community and ecosystem effects. Although some of these areas of concern may have been identified previously in earlier works, we suggest that consideration of the issues is warranted to avoid detrimental impacts on aquatic resources of the Columbia River system. We discuss these issues and provide recommendations to regulatory and management agencies based on our review of recent literature. In general, we recommend that additional attention be directed toward resolving the uncertainties within these five areas...|$|R

40|$|Supersaturation of {{atmospheric}} gas in {{waters of the}} Columbia and Snake rivers has long been recognized as a serious problem affecting the survival of salmonids. Although the issue was considered essentially solved by the mid- 1970 's, recent changes in river management and endangered species listings have renewed the concern about dissolved gas <b>supersaturation</b> (DGS) <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> salmonids. Much of the recent concern involves potential sublethal or indirect effects of exposure to DGS, particularly increased vulnerability to predation. Consequently, we conducted laboratory experiments to assess the effects of an acute exposure to DGS on the predator avoidance ability of juvenile chinook salmon Oncorhvnchus tshawvtscha. We exposed fish to 120 % total dissolved gas (TDG) for 8 h and then subjected them, simultaneously with unexposed control fish, to predation by northern squawfish (Ptvchocheilus oreaonensis). A total of 14 predation tests were conducted, but only six of these met our criterion for analysis (i. e., predators had to eat {{of the total number}} of prey released). Using data from these six tests, we determined there was no significant difference in the numbers of fish consumed from either group 0. 10; = 77). Statistical power (to detect a 20 % effect size) of the pooled chi-square test was 0. 38. Although our results suggest that juvenile salmon receiving acute, sublethal exposures to DGS are not more vulnerable to predation, the small sample size and low statistical power preclude any strong inferences from our data. We will continue to explore the <b>effects</b> of DGS <b>on</b> predator avoidance ability to increase our understanding about this potential source of indirect mortality.

Starting from aqueous Ba 2 + chloride (BaCl 2) and acetic acid (C 2 H 2 O 4) in gel, this method offers a low-cost and an easiest alternative to other preparation methods {{for the production}} of barium oxalate bulky single crystals. The optimal conditions for the growth of BOM crystals in silica gel were found by investigating different growth parameters such as gel pH, gel aging and crystallization temperature. Irrespective of all such crystallization environments, growth rate of the crystals were initially less and then exhibited <b>supersaturation</b> <b>effect</b> leading to non-linearity. Gel aging and temperature has profound <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> nucleation density that resulted less number of crystals of maximum size in the gel matrix. Perfect single crystals were grown on gels of higher pH. The macropore morphology and porosity was controlled by changing age of the gel.

40|$|Hot melt {{extrusion}} (HME) is a preferred technique for preparing solid dispersions of poorly water soluble drugs, for {{the enhancement of}} drug dissolution rate and ultimately bioavailability. This technique is preferred to other methods due to the short time necessary for processing, and no need for solvents, which can be both problematic to patients and the environment. A wide variety of carriers is available, and may be selected based on {{factors such as the}} nature of release required and the compatibility with the drug. In this thesis, solid dispersions of two model BCS class 11 drugs, felodipine and celecoxib were prepared using Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), EudragitSl L- IOO (LJOO) and Eudragit~ FS 30 D (FS 30 D) by HME. The influence of molecular weight on the ability of the PVP to form a one phase amorphous dispersion and to stabilize the dispersed amorphous drug was investigated. Also, the feasibility of using the Eudragit polymers as both single and binary matrices for the generation of one-phase solid dispersions via ID 1 E, and to stabilize the amorphous drug during storage and dissolution was investigated. Pluronic Fl 27 (FI 27) was added to best performing binary and ternary systems to investigate the influence of surfactant on stability and dissolution. No difference was observed in the ability the different molecular PVP to form a one-phase molecular dispersion with felodipine or celecoxib and in stabilizing the amorphous form. The ability of methacrylate polymers to improve the pharmaceutical performance of the solid dispersions was dependent on drug loading. Also the performance of the binary methacrylate matrices depended on the ratio of the polymers. F 127 improved the degree of <b>supersaturation,</b> and its <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> stabilization of the amorphous drug was concentrated dependent, with higher levels producing instability. The best performing formulation was the ternary system consisting of the higher ratio of FS 30 D with 10 % F 127. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|International audienceWe {{study the}} {{distribution}} of ions in a drying porous medium up {{to the formation of}} first crystals at the surface. The study is based on comparisons between numerical simulations and experiments with packings of glass beads. The experimental configuration, which is representative of many previous drying experiments, is characterized by the formation of an efflorescence fairy ring at the surface of the porous medium. The preferential formation of crystals at the periphery is explained by the combined effect of higher evaporation fluxes at the surface periphery, as in the classical coffee ring problem, and variations in the porosity near the wall bordering the packing. It is shown that both effects have a great impact on the time marking the occurrence of first crystals, which {{is referred to as the}} first crystallization time. The experiments indicate that the first crystallization time increases with a decreasing bead size for a given initial ion concentration. This is explained by the variation with bead size of the characteristic size of the near wall region where a preferential desaturation of the sample occurs as a result of the porosity increase near the wall. The study also reveals a significant salt <b>supersaturation</b> <b>effect.</b> This represents a noticeable fact in relation with salt weathering issues...|$|R

40|$|Two {{conventionally}} solidified Al- 0. 2 Ti alloys (with 0. 18 and 0. 22 at. pct Ti) exhibit no hard-ening after aging up to 3200 {{hours at}} 375 C or 425 C. This {{is due to}} the absence of Al 3 Ti precipitation, as confirmed by electron microscopy and electrical conductivity measurements. By contrast, an Al- 0. 2 Zr alloy (with 0. 19 at. pct Zr) displays strong age hardening at both temperatures due to precipitation of Al 3 Zr (L 12) within Zr-enriched dendritic regions. This discrepancy between the two alloys is explained {{within the context of the}} equilibrium phase diagrams: (1) the disparity in solid and liquid solubilities of Ti in a-Al is much greater than that of Zr in a-Al; and (2) the relatively small liquid solubility of Ti in a-Al limits the amount of solute retained in solid solution during solidification, while the comparatively high solid solu-bility reduces the <b>supersaturation</b> <b>effecting</b> precipitation during post-solidification aging. The lattice parameter mismatch of Al 3 Ti (L 12) with a-Al is also larger than that of Al 3 Zr (L 12), further hindering nucleation of Al 3 Ti. Classical nucleation theory indicates that the minimum solute supersaturation required to overcome the elastic strain energy of Al 3 Ti nuclei cannot be obtained during conventional solidification of Al-Ti alloys (unlike for Al-Zr alloys), thus explaining the absence of Al 3 Ti precipitation and the presence of Al 3 Zr precipitation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Unconjugated {{bilirubin}} (UCB) is {{an unstable}} substance with very low aqueous solubility. Its aqueous pKa values affect {{many of its}} interactions, particularly their pH-dependence. A companion paper shows that only our prior solvent partition studies, leading to pKa values of 8. 12 and 8. 44, met all essential requirements for valid pKa determinations. Other published values, generally lower, some below 5. 0, were shown to be invalid. The present work was designed to derive suitable models for interpreting published data on the pH-dependent binding of UCB with four agents, mentioned below, chosen because they are not, themselves, sensitive {{to changes in the}} pH range 4 - 10, and the data, mainly spectrometric, were of reasonable quality. Results These analyses indicated that the high pKa values, dianion dimerization constant and solubilities of UCB at various pH values, derived from our partition studies, along with literature-derived pH- and time-dependent <b>supersaturation</b> <b>effects,</b> were essential for constructing useful models that showed good qualitative, and sometimes quantitative, fits with the data. In contrast, published pKa values below 5. 0 were highly incompatible with the data for all systems considered. The primary species of bound UCB in our models were: undissociated diacid for phosphatidylcholine, dianion for dodecyl maltoside micelles and cyclodextrins, and both monoanions and dianion for sodium taurocholate. The resulting binding versus pH profiles differed strikingly from each other. Conclusions The insights derived from these analyses should be helpful to explore and interpret UCB binding to more complex, pH-sensitive, physiological moieties, such as proteins or membranes, in order to understand its functions. </p...|$|R
