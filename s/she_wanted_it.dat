5|$|Rosenblat also {{recalled}} (Vulture interview) {{that while}} filming an episode directed by Jodie Foster she plucked her nipple hair. Foster was on set to talk over {{the logistics of}} how <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> portrayed through Miss Rosa. During season two Miss Rosa needs life saving surgery. But Sam Healy (Michael J. Harney) informs her that the DOC {{are not willing to}} fund the operation. Instead she is forced to continue with chemotherapy meaning she will die.|$|E
5|$|When {{some of the}} behind-the-scenes footage {{was used}} in a BET Access Granted special, some of the scenes that Beyoncé was shown {{shooting}} did {{not appear in the}} finished video. Beyoncé said that the video did not turn out the way <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> to be and she had to reshoot most of it. In post-production, she decided that it would be more artistic to play the events in reverse.|$|E
5|$|Before Lauper {{covered the}} song, the band The Cars {{produced}} {{an early version}} of it that was not released. Shear's version was originally a folk rock song, but Lauper instead turned it into a pop ballad for her album, with a heavy emphasis on a synthesizer. According to Lauper, <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> to be just like Shear's version, with a bit more of an acoustic sound. However, she changed her mind, saying that she wanted to sing it like herself. Unlike her other singles from the album, this one did not have a music video released with it.|$|E

25|$|Soon {{after the}} NIMH {{accepted}} the grant proposal, in late May 1971, Susan Curtiss began {{her work on}} Genie's case {{as a graduate student}} in linguistics under Victoria Fromkin, and for the remainder of Genie's stay at Children's Hospital Curtiss met with Genie almost every day. Curtiss quickly recognized Genie's powerful nonverbal communication abilities, writing that complete strangers would frequently buy something for her because they sensed <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> and that these gifts were always the types of objects she most enjoyed. Curtiss concluded that Genie had learned a significant amount of language but that it was not yet at a usefully testable level, so she decided to dedicate the next few months to getting to know Genie and gaining her friendship. Over the following month, she and Genie very quickly bonded with each other.|$|E
25|$|The {{competition}} between Holly and Sebastian {{for the center}} ring develops into a romantic triangle as well, with both Sebastian and Brad vying for Holly as the aerialists' acts become increasingly daring and dangerous. Sebastian ignores his former lovers on the show: Angel, who performs in the elephant act; and Phyllis, who does a double turn as an iron jaw artist and a vocalist, starring in a South Seas spectacular built around her talent as a singer. The duel ends when, {{in response to a}} challenge from Holly, Sebastian removes his safety net and suffers serious injuries in a fall when a trick goes wrong. Buttons tends to him; and when the show's doctor expresses admiration for the way he dealt with the injuries, the clown explains, a little nervously, that he used to be a pharmacist's mate. Holly finally has the center ring and star billing – but not the way <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>it.</b> Brad is unable to comfort her because she is in love with Sebastian.|$|E
500|$|Because {{the mixing}} {{engineers}} {{were aware of}} Timbaland and Furtado's rock influences, the songs were mixed on a mixing board in the studio instead of [...] "the fancy mixer at the end". Furtado said she preferred the louder volume that process gave to the album because <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> to sound like her demo tapes, which she prefers to her finished albums. She said, [...] "It didn't have that final wash over it; it didn't have the final pressing at the end, save for a couple sounds".|$|E

500|$|Christian Science leaders {{place their}} {{religion}} within mainstream Christian teaching, according to J. Gordon Melton, and reject any {{identification with the}} New Thought movement. Eddy was strongly influenced by her Congregationalist upbringing. In founding the Church of Christ, Scientist, in April 1879, she wrote that <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> to [...] "reinstate primitive Christianity and its lost element of healing." [...] Later she suggested that Christian Science {{was a kind of}} second coming and that Science and Health was an inspired text. In 1895, in the Manual of the Mother Church, she ordained the Bible and Science and Health as [...] "Pastor over the Mother Church." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Push the Button" [...] was {{directed}} by American director Matthew Rolston, who collaborated with the Sugababes on the videos for their singles [...] "Hole in the Head" [...] and [...] "In the Middle". It was filmed in Shepherd's Bush, London, during July 2005. The men who appear in the video are models and dancers, and were selected based on their dancing ability. Buena described the video as [...] "really cheeky" [...] and stated that it [...] "turned out really great in the end". Some clips {{were removed from the}} final product because of their sexual content, although Buchanan admitted that <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> to be more suggestive.|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Randee St. Nicholas. Underwood said that when she heard first the song, she already had ideas of a possible video for it. <b>She</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> to be a dark Wizard of Oz in 2012. It earned her an award for Video of the Year at the 2013 CMT Music Awards. The video was nominated for Music Video of the Year at the 2013 Country Music Association Awards. Underwood has performed [...] "Blown Away" [...] {{in a number of}} live appearances, including at the 2012 Billboard Music Awards, the 55th Annual Grammy Awards, and {{two years in a row}} at the Country Music Association Awards. It was also performed as the encore of the Blown Away Tour (2012–13).|$|E

500|$|Pierce called Dawn Wells on July 8, 1976, {{to star in}} his film. She {{arrived by}} plane in Texarkana before noon the next day. She stayed in Texarkana for six days, but {{completed}} her scenes in the first two. While filming the cornfield scene, Wells was almost attacked by a bulldog, but the crew scared it away by shooting at it. Wells {{wanted to talk to}} the real-life survivor of her role, Katie Starks, but Katie refused. The Town That Dreaded Sundown was Wells' fourth film and her second time working with Pierce. During her stay, she did not read the script; she relied on the director, instead. She said that was the way <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>it.</b> Wells explained, [...] "Acting-wise, it's an extremely emotional role. I didn't want to pattern my interpretation after anything. I wanted to go on my own feelings." [...] Being shot was a new experience for the actress. [...] "They planted a charge in the receiver, so I was standing there holding the phone, shaking, expecting the receiver to blow up in my face." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Clarence Waldron from Jet, Cole said the idea of recording a Christmas album started after {{a telephone call from}} producer and longtime friend Michael Masser, with whom Cole had worked on the song [...] "Someone That I Used to Love" [...] from her 1980 album Don't Look Back and her 1989 single [...] "Miss You Like Crazy". Cole described the telephone call from Masser as unexpected; Masser told her, [...] "I've got this beautiful Christmas song I wrote just for you". When they met, Messer played [...] "No More Blue Christmas"; after the session they both agreed to record a Christmas album. Cole described the decision to form a Christmas album as leaving her [...] "running around in April, looking for Christmas songs". Cole expressed hope that the album would remind her fans about [...] "the true spirit of the holiday season". <b>She</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> to communicate that Christmas is [...] "a time for families to reflect and not just wait until the holidays to be a family". Cole's twin sister Timolin Cole said, [...] "Christmas Eve has always been a magical time with Natalie" [...] when she could connect with family over holiday traditions.|$|E
500|$|... "Living for Love" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by Madonna, Diplo and Ariel Rechtshaid, with additional writing from MoZella and Toby Gad. Madonna's collaboration with Diplo was revealed in May 2014 through an image on her Instagram showing her {{working on her}} laptop with him. She had invited him for her annual Oscar party, {{and he could not}} make it. So he began texting with her about music and sent some music. Madonna replied with a 20-page text containing her anecdotes on the music. Following this they started collaborating for the album. In an interview with Idolator, Diplo explained that Madonna had asked him to provide his [...] "craziest record" [...] for the album. Together they wrote and recorded seven songs and Diplo added that [...] "Those records are gonna be crazy-sounding. We really pushed the envelope with some of the stuff we were doing... he was up for anything. I love when an artist gives a producer the confidence he needs to work with them, and Madonna was very open-minded to my ideas... she was down from day one." [...] According to Diplo, [...] "Living for Love" [...] had almost 20 versions ranging from a piano ballad to an EDM composition, ultimately Madonna and Diplo compromising on a middle level. Rechtshaid and British singer MNEK also joined for writing sessions with them, improving the verse of the song. Madonna denied that there were 20 versions of the song, admitting it [...] "might be a little too high", and commented on how <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> to sound: ...|$|E

500|$|Worried of Clarkson being {{continually}} typecast as {{a talent}} show winner, Davis met with various producers, primarily Max Martin, and {{encouraged them to}} produce records for Clarkson in a pop rock direction. Clarkson revealed that she expected that she'll always be labeled as an American Idol winner; she remarked, [...] "I'm the first one, so it's {{going to be on}} my grave, I'm aware of that. (There's no getting away from it) so why even try?" [...] Upon their meeting, Martin presented songs he wrote with Dr. Luke. These songs include [...] "Since U Been Gone" [...] and a demo version of what would have been [...] "Behind These Hazel Eyes". Davis wanted Clarkson to record the songs, describing them having [...] "a sharp rock edge but were still capable of being pop hits. They would push Kelly in a promising direction for her, while maintaining and even growing her audience." [...] Martin insisted that the songs should be given to rock acts, wanting to stray from his reputation for producing pop singles for the Backstreet Boys and Britney Spears in the 1990s. Davis recalled, [...] "Max was looking to move on from what he had done with Backstreet Boys, and I really spent time convincing them that an American Idol winner could bring all the feeling and passion that was required to the song." [...] Martin and Dr. Luke eventually agreed and invited Clarkson to travel to Sweden to record the songs. Upon hearing the tracks, Clarkson was skeptical of the pop elements; and the three eventually decided to develop a rock sound, a move Clarkson claimed Davis did not approve. Davis reiterated that he was ecstatic with the prospect, claiming that she disliked it and demanded that both the songs be removed from the album. Clarkson then asserted that <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> to be on the record and claimed that Davis had detested [...] "Because of You" [...] instead, saying that she [...] "was a shitty writer (sic) who should be grateful for the gifts that he bestows upon her". Davis reiterated that he loved the song and felt that Clarkson could indeed write hits.|$|E
2500|$|... "Milkshake" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by Pharrell Williams and Chad Hugo, {{better known as}} The Neptunes. The song came out when Tasty {{was chosen as the}} album's title. When making the song, Kelis [...] "knew right away that it was a really good song", and <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> to be the album's first single. Recording sessions took place at Hovercraft Studios in Virginia. Phil Tan mixed the recordings at Right Track Studios in New York City.|$|E
2500|$|While The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie {{was still}} an unproduced script, Alfred Hitchcock read it and offered Allen the script for Marnie (1964). Hitchcock brought Allen to California {{to work on the}} film at Universal Studios in the San Fernando Valley. Allen, who lived close by, would bicycle to work. [...] This upset Hitchcock, who thought it was low-class and insisted that a {{limousine}} be sent for her every day, whether <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> or not.

2500|$|The {{failure to}} rescue General Gordon's force in Sudan {{was a major}} blow to Prime Minister Gladstone's popularity. Queen Victoria sent him a {{telegram}} of rebuke which {{found its way into}} the press. Victoria's telegram was not coded as usual which suggests <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> to appear in the press. Critics said Gladstone had neglected military affairs and had not acted promptly enough to save the besieged Gordon. Critics inverted his acronym, [...] "G.O.M." [...] (for [...] "Grand Old Man"), to [...] "M.O.G." [...] (for [...] "Murderer of Gordon"). Gladstone told the Cabinet that the public cared much about Gordon and nothing about the Sudan, so he ordered Wolseley home after learning of Gordon's death. Wolseley, who had been led to believe that his expedition was the initial phase of the British conquest of the Sudan, was furious, and in a telegram to Queen Victoria contemptuously called Gladstone [...] "...the tradesman who has become a politician".|$|E
