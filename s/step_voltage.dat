40|$|The {{horizontal}} {{electric field}} at the ground surface {{in the vicinity of}} structures hit by lightning flashes is relevant to the safety of human beings and livestock; it determines the touch and <b>step</b> <b>voltages</b> around the structure. This paper uses an approximate analytical formula for calculating the horizontal electric field, which was adapted {{to take into account the}} effect of the structure foundation. The input for the calculation is the current waveform at the base of the structure, and the results agree well with those obtained by other authors using the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method. The approximate formula is applied to calculate touch and <b>step</b> <b>voltages</b> in the vicinity of a structure and the results show that the use of the direct current (DC) approximation to calculate touch and <b>step</b> <b>voltages</b> may lead to significant errors; especially for fast-rising currents and relatively good-conducting soils. This means that DC approximation could be used for positive first stroke and poor-conducting ground (ρ ≥ 1000 Ω∙m), but cannot be used for subsequent strokes and good-conducting ground (ρ ≤ 100 Ω∙m). Moreover, <b>step</b> <b>voltages</b> differ more from the DC approximation than the touch voltages...|$|R

Previous work has been done in [1] on the DC {{model of the}} grid and this paper deals with the transient model. Rather than directly reducing the steady state voltage drops below the threshold we work on reducing the first time <b>step</b> <b>voltage</b> drops. The method uses current constraints proposed in [2] to find the first time <b>step</b> <b>voltage</b> drop whose distance to the corresponding threshold is the largest.

40|$|This paper {{suggests}} an advanced {{approach in the}} verification of the adequacy of a grounding system (GS) located in a common zone of influence with other GSs, taking in account the mutual interferences between the GSs. In fact, {{the presence of other}} GSs can transfer inadmissible touch and <b>step</b> <b>voltages</b> on the testing GS, especially sensitive for critical power systems as data centers and hospitals. The safety of a local grounding system (LGS) or of a global ground system (GGS) does not admit uncontrolled interferences. Simulation programs assume a relevant importance, because they allow analyzing the interferences of GSs, especially when operational difficulties for the tests. GSs have to maintain in the installation lifetime their characteristics of integrity and continuity, their safety performances, so they require a management program. This paper highlights the relevance of intrinsically safe GSs that guarantee safe touch/ <b>step</b> <b>voltages</b> lower than permissible permanent voltages such as GGSs. GSs in city centers, urban and industrial areas evolve in the time. Each installation of a new GS can influence the performance of the GSs existent in the area.
