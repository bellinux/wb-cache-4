500|$|In May 1928, the KCA {{launched}} a Kikuyu-language magazine, Muĩgwithania (roughly translated as [...] "The Reconciler" [...] or [...] "The Unifier"), {{in which it}} published news, articles, and homilies. Its purpose was to help unify the Kikuyu and {{to raise funds for}} the KCA. Kenyatta, now described as Secretary of the KCA, was listed as the publication's editor, although Murray-Brown suggested that he was not the guiding hand behind it and that his duties were largely confined to translating things into Kikuyu. Kenyatta's approach to campaigning was cautious; he was aware that Thuku had been exiled for his activism. In Muĩgwithania, he expressed support for the churches, district commissioners, and chiefs. He also praised the British Empire, stating that: [...] "The first thing [...] is that all people are governed justly, big or small – equally. The <b>second</b> <b>thing</b> is that nobody is regarded as a slave, everyone is free to do what he or she likes without being hindered." ...|$|E
500|$|Speaking {{about the}} moment when Nico Rosberg let him past {{in the early stages}} of the race, Hamilton told the press that he had thanked his {{teammate}} for [...] "being a gentleman". When asked how painful it had been to be asked to let Hamilton go by, Rosberg said: [...] "It was more painful the feeling that I had in the car. That was the worst. Around Monaco, that's not a nice feeling to have. I had no confidence at all. The <b>second</b> <b>thing</b> [...] was just a consequence of that." [...] Mercedes's motorsport director Toto Wolff also praised Rosberg for working for the team and moving to the side without questioning the team's decision. Rosberg was however unable to give an explanation for his slow pace during the early stages. He pointed to the possibility that his car's tyre and brake temperatures had been particularly affected by the period behind the safety car.|$|E
2500|$|In 2008, {{the group}} {{received}} the MTV Legend award by MTV Russia. The {{group is the}} most successful Russian musical export of all time. Katina stated to Billboard Magazine; [...] "People will remember us for great songs, being free, taking life as it is and not being afraid of anything, [...] provocative images of two girls kissing each other, but the <b>second</b> <b>thing</b> was the really great music." [...] In 2006, both Lena and Yulia were awarded [...] "Woman of the Year" [...] by GQ's Person of the Year Awards, but were not awarded under the band name.|$|E

60|$|For {{the space}} of half a <b>second</b> <b>things</b> seemed just as they were. There was the tree, the balcony, the shining river, the distant church tower. Then {{he noticed that the}} acacia was {{displaced}} about a foot to the right, and that it was quivering, and the leaves were rustling. The tree was shaken violently, and a heavy panting was audible.|$|R
50|$|A <b>second</b> book, <b>Things</b> We Found During the Autopsy, was {{released}} on October 1, 2014.|$|R
2500|$|That {{was written}} {{around the time}} of the first record [...] I think that was the <b>second</b> <b>thing</b> Ed and I wrote together. It came out of a jam in the studio and Ed didn't really have any lyrics. He came up with some ideas right there on the spot, and that's what we recorded. For some reason, it didn't make it on Ten. I was kind of bummed at the time. I really wanted it to be on our first record. But at the time, I was really young and just happy to be around this situation, so I did whatever.|$|E
2500|$|For Tilghman, Princeton has two {{essential}} missions. [...] "One is {{to ensure}} that our doors are open as wide as possible to every talented student in the world who is capable of doing the hard work we ask of them. [...] And that means maintaining our commitment to financial aid, which is the tool – the critical tool – to get those students to Princeton. [...] And the <b>second</b> <b>thing</b> is that we must address the most critical issues, and push back the frontiers of knowledge, and not just in science and technology, but in social policy, and in public policy, and in understanding the nature of the human condition." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to {{the legend}} of Ɓoxo-koƥ (dog of the forest or [...] "wild dog" [...] (figuritively) - jackal), the jackal was the first living thing created by the supreme deity Roog. The jackal circled {{the world in a}} day and two of its hands were {{transformed}} into paws. [...] The supreme being gave it the ngud tree (guiera senegalensis) and thus ngud became the first tree and the <b>second</b> <b>thing</b> created by Roog. After the creation of ngud, the nalafun tree (combretum paniculatum) was created to whom the deity told: [...] "Go and keep the ngud tree company, it is lonely". During the life cycle of the nalafun, the tree grow so tall that it headed towards the sky. The supreme being considered that an affront and gave it a sharp flick on the head (mak in Serer) and told it: [...] "You are rude. Go! Turn around and go back to where you've just came from". After that event, the nalafun never grew tall as it once did and was always bent.|$|E
50|$|During the {{previous}} offseason, Chicago had traded their starting third baseman, Sparky Adams, to the Pittsburgh Pirates along with outfielder Pete Scott for outfielder Kiki Cuyler. They shifted second baseman Clyde Beck over to third and installed Maguire as their starter at <b>second.</b> <b>Things</b> {{started off with}} a bang, as Maguire hit his first Major League home run on Opening Day off Cincinnati Reds pitcher Dolf Luque. It was the only run the Cubs scored that day in a 5-1 loss.|$|R

2500|$|The Spice Girls {{were fully}} {{involved}} {{in the writing of}} all the songs. Halliwell in particular was clearly a fund of ideas for songs, arriving at sessions with her book of jottings, notes and miscellaneous scribblings which often produced the starting point of a lyric or a song title or just an agenda for the day's work. Watkins commented, [...] "Geri [...] would come up with the concept for a song. Typically, she'd sing one line and the girls would pick up on it or we'd pick up on it and construct around it and then Mel C [...] and Emma [...] would be very active. They'd really like to sit and sing melodies and go off and come up with little sections." [...] They [...] "conceptualised" [...] and sang bits of melody and wrote the lyrics. But in musical terms it was not a partnership of equals. Rowe commented: [...] "We had to kind of steer it. It was very different for different tracks really. Some of them were when we were all jamming in the room. We'd just put up some drum sounds and start making things up. On other tracks me and Richard [...] would prepare something beforehand and play it to them. We'd have some lyrics and make them write the second verse." [...] The Spice Girls introduced two key innovations that have had a lasting impact on the way which modern pop acts go about their creative business. Firstly they introduced the idea of songwriting identity. This was a familiar concept in rock bands like Queen or the Sex Pistols, but not in the world of [...] "manufactured pop", where the credits of songwriting would be divided out strictly in accordance with whoever had written the song. The Spice Girls recognised their solidarity as a group, which depended on maintaining parity in all departments, including the songwriting credits and the resulting royalties. They share the songwriting royalties on all the songs irrespective of what any member of the group had or had not contributed to any particular song. The <b>second</b> <b>thing</b> the Spice Girls established from the outset was a straight 50–50 split between them and their various songwriting collaborators. Here they anticipated one of the key developments in the pop industry since the 1990s, namely the increasing importance of publishing royalties as opposed to royalties payments made for the performance of the song on the record.|$|E

30|$|A shared view on envy {{is that it}} is a kind of {{negative}} emotion that surfaces when one lacks and desires others’ superior qualities, achievements, or possessions (Parrott & Smith, 1993). Extant literature has uncovered three prerequisites for being envied by others. First, the envied target has the better <b>things.</b> <b>Second,</b> the <b>things</b> that one lacks are vital to his or her self-concept. Third, the envious person perceives that the target is similar to him or her to some extent. (Cohen-Charash & Mueller, 2007).|$|R
5000|$|In summer 2004, he {{released}} the album Fried, {{on which he}} collaborated with the New Orleans vocalist, Jonte Short. The album was a mix of soul, funk, and R&B. Fried signed to SonyBMG and their <b>second</b> album, <b>Things</b> Change, was released in 2007.|$|R

50|$|There was minor {{contact between}} Menu and Tarquini {{at the second}} corner on the first lap in Race 1, {{as a result of}} which the latter was pushed wide and dropped down to fifth. Menu kept the lead of the race, but was quickly under {{pressure}} from Yvan Muller. The Frenchman passed Menu on lap 4 to take the lead, with Huff following him though into <b>second.</b> <b>Things</b> became worse for Menu a lap later, when he had to pit for repairs after a power steering issue and was knocked out of contention. Muller and Huff left {{the rest of the field}} behind, and Muller took his eighth win of the season ahead of Huff. Norbert Michelisz finished third behind the Chevrolets and took the Independents win.|$|R
