25|$|On 31 March 2014, {{a lesbian}} couple {{applied for a}} {{marriage}} license in San Francisco de Campeche but were denied in April 2014 based on a decision that same-sex couples must join via the state's civil union provisions. In July 2014, Mexico's Supreme Court declared that the current marriage laws were unconstitutional and told the local government that they must modify their Civil Code to allow same-sex marriages. It was later announced that the couple could marry after a district judge granted them an injunction, but the law must still be revised. PAN has <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> abide by the ruling. The couple married on 30 August 2014. In September 2014, the Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD) announced that 16 persons, 10 from San Francisco de Campeche and 6 from Ciudad del Carmen have filed for injunctions and that analysis of changing the marriage statues is in progress.|$|E
25|$|Incumbent {{president}} Miloš Zeman {{is running}} for reelection. He {{is expected to be}} supported by Freedom and Direct Democracy and Dawn - National Coalition. Independent candidate Michal Horáček was considered his main rival in early 2017. The Social Democratic Party <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> hold a presidential primary in November 2017 to choose their candidate but finally they did not organize them. ANO 2011 also planed to hold a presidential primary but decided to not. It was speculated that both parties may select Zeman as their candidate, but ČSSD leader Bohuslav Sobotka announced that his party probably would not support Zeman due to his actions during the Czech government crisis in May 2017. It was reported that ČSSD planned to nominate Lubomír Zaorálek who decided to not run. Drahoš is running with the support of TOP 09, and the Christian and Democratic Union (KDU-ČSL) and Mayors and Independents are also expected to support his candidacy.|$|E
25|$|On 10 July, Egypt's {{parliament}} convened despite dissolution, but {{the session}} was adjourned by Speaker Saad al-Katatni after {{the members of}} parliament approved Katatni's proposal that the parliament seek legal advice from the Court of Cassation on how to implement the supreme court's ruling. Thousands gathered in Cairo in protest of a ruling by Egypt's Supreme Constitutional Court to freeze the decree issued by President Mohamed Morsi to reinstate the Islamist-led parliament. While the Supreme Constitutional Court ruled that Morsi {{did not have the}} right to reconstitute the body, it also threatened the new president with the equivalent of contempt of court if he continued to reject its decisions. Parliament asked Egypt's Court of Cassation to essentially overrule the aspect of the Supreme Constitutional Court's decision holding that the whole Parliament must be immediately dissolved because of flaws in the electoral system used to fill a third of the seats. The Administrative Court (whose function is the review of executive actions), besides the Supreme Constitutional Court (whose function is the review of statutes) and Court of Cassation (whose function is the handling of appeals of lower court rulings) one of the three highest Courts in Egypt, is also weighing that question and has <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> issue its own ruling on 17 July.|$|E

25|$|There {{were many}} {{concerns}} expressed by local residents and historic preservationists by the successful Trump bid. Preservationists believed Trump would not respect the historic {{nature of the}} building and had almost no experience renovating historic properties but government officials said any redesign would need to be approved by the Commission of Fine Arts (whose secretary signaled heavy scrutiny for any changes). Trump dismissed concerns that he lacked experience with historic buildings, pointing to his redevelopment of Grand Central Terminal in New York City and the Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Florida. Some city residents worried that Trump would block access to the clock tower. However, the National Park Service <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> retain control over the clock tower and observation deck and it will keep them open for tours. Washington Post business columnist Steven Pearlstein questioned the financial wisdom of selecting Trump/Colony Capital, given Trump's extensive problems with bankruptcy and Colony Capital's current problems keeping its hotel properties out of receivership. Pearlstein and local hoteliers argued that the market would not support the room rates Trump wished to charge, and therefore {{would not be able to}} support the excessive amount of redevelopment money and rent Trump was paying for the property. Robert Peck, Commissioner of the General Services Administration, defended the selection, arguing that the Trump/Colony Capital bid was by far the best in terms of financial commitment, experience in renovating and managing properties, and quality of design. Peck dismissed criticism about Trump's numerous past bankruptcies, noting that these mostly concerned casinos rather than hotels.|$|E

Other opposition societies such as National Democratic Action Society (Waad) and Nationalist Democratic Assembly also joined Al Wefaq in affirming the rights of freedom of speech and freedom of assembly. Mainstream opposition societies cancelled a planned mass protest on 14 August, [...] "because of the heavily intimidating security presence in Manama".|$|E
