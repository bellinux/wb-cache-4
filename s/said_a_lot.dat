It wasn't to shock people, though, but to get people involved in what we were doing. We had to get peoples' attention.

500|$|Carter was {{inspired}} to write the scene in which Scully throws water into Doggett's face, due to Carter being aware that new actor Patrick would be facing opposition from {{some members of the}} fan community, Patrick has even called that scene his favorite ever shot for the series, admitting that he couldn't think of a better way to introduce the character and that the scene not only <b>said</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> but that it had actually helped him. The introduction of the new character in the eighth season was one of two main factors that influenced the series' production personnel to decide to go back to more serious episodes. The other major reason was to avoid [...] "trivializing the absence of Mulder".|$|E

O'Neal denied that his comments were racist, {{and said he was}} only joking. Yao also said he believed O'Neal was joking, but he <b>said</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of Asians would not see the humor. In the game, Yao scored the Rockets' first six points of the game and blocked O'Neal twice in the opening minutes as well as altering two other shots by O'neal, all 4 of those attempts coming right at the rim, and made a game-sealing dunk with 10seconds left in overtime. Yao finished with 10points, 10rebounds, and 6blocks; O'Neal recorded 31points, 13rebounds, and 0blocks. O'Neal later admitted that he regretted how he hazed Yao early in his career.|$|E
500|$|Literary critic Claudia Sadowski-Smith {{has called}} Cisneros [...] "perhaps {{the most famous}} Chicana writer", and Cisneros has been {{acknowledged}} as a pioneer in her literary field as the first female Mexican-American writer to have her work published by a mainstream publisher. In 1989, The House on Mango Street, which was originally published by the small Hispanic publishing company Arte Público Press, was reissued in a second edition by Vintage Press; and in 1991 Woman Hollering Creek was published by Random House. As Ganz observes, previously only male Chicano authors had successfully made the crossover from smaller publishers. That Cisneros had garnered enough attention to be taken on by Vintage Press <b>said</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> about the possibility for Chicano literature to become more widely recognized.

Speaking about this first meeting, Stevens remarked that the group [...] "felt {{comfortable}} with each other from the beginning". Several {{members of the group}} have since stated that the [...] "S" [...] in S Club 7 stands for Simon, after the group's creator, although the official line has always been ambiguous. The group's entry on the Popjustice website states that at one point they were nearly called [...] "Sugar Club" [...] instead of the name that stuck. [...] Another theory is that the group is so-named because [...] "S" [...] is the first letter of the word [...] "seven". McIntosh, in a December 2012 interview, <b>said</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of Simon Fuller's success has been based on the number 19 (owning 19 Entertainment); therefore, as [...] "S" [...] is the 19th letter of the alphabet, the [...] "S" [...] was put into S Club 7.|$|E

500|$|Illmatic is also {{credited}} with reviving the Queensbridge rap scene. Once home to prestigious pioneers such as Marley Marl, MC Shan, Roxanne Shanté, Queensbridge {{had been one}} of the most productive hip hop scenes in the country during the 1980s. In an April 2006 article, an XXL columnist wrote of the history and impact of the Queensbridge hip hop scene, stating [...] "Since the 1980s, New York City's Queensbridge Housing Projects has been documented perhaps better than any other geographic location. Starting with super producer Marley Marl's dominant Juice Crew in the ’80s all the way through ’90s mainstays like Nas, Cormega and Capone, the Bridge has produced the highest per-capita talent of any ’hood." [...] Yet during the early 1990s, the Queensbridge rap scene was otherwise stagnant [...] According to Nas: [...] "I was coming from the legacy of Marley Marl, MC Shan, Juice Crew kind of vibe. Knowing these guys out in the neighborhood. At that time, the Queensbridge scene was dead. Dropping that album right there <b>said</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> for me to carry on the legacy of the Queensbridge pioneers." ...|$|E
500|$|Carter was {{inspired}} to write the scene in which Scully splashes water into Doggett's face, since {{he was aware that}} new actor Robert Patrick would be facing opposition from some members of the fan community. The scene was even the first filmed, in order to truly introduce Patrick to the show. After the conclusion of The X-Files television series in 2002, Patrick commented that this part of the episode had been his favorite scene in the series, and admitted that he could not think of a better way to introduce his character because the scene not only <b>said</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot,</b> but it had actually helped him. Tom Braidwood, who appears in this episode as long-running recurring character Frohike, similarly remarked that the first meeting of Doggett and Scully was one of his favorite scenes from the entire series. Both Robert Patrick and the director of this episode, Kim Manners, felt that it was the perfect introduction to the character of John Doggett {{as the leader of the}} taskforce sent to find Mulder. Manners stated that Patrick gave a new [...] "sense of energy" [...] to the show, since they had basically used the same characters for seven years.|$|E
500|$|Victor's pairing with Nikki has {{received}} positive reviews from critics throughout the years; The News & Advance cited Victor and Nikki with other romances considered [...] "epic" [...] {{of the early}} supercouple era. Global News wrote of their long-standing relationship, [...] "Victor is the consummate womanizer {{and has been a}} part of many relationships over the years. Nonetheless, his heart belongs to one woman alone, the stunning Nikki Reed. Despite true love and good intention, the relationship between Victor and Nikki has always been troubled by poor timing and miscommunication." [...] In 1990, The Washington Times wrote that, [...] "Victor Newman's sudden marriage to Ashley Abbott fooled us all." [...] In 1995, Sports Illustrated wrote of Victor's marriage to Hope, saying a [...] "man with that much power could have married anyone, but he fell in love with a blind woman. Not for what she is, but who she's about." [...] In 2002, Entertainment Weekly wrote that the soap opera was [...] "keeping it real" [...] with Victor and Nikki's third wedding. Upon their fourth wedding in 2013, the magazine stated: [...] "Say what you will about Victor (and we’ve all <b>said</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot),</b> but the ol’ boy definitely knows who is best for him — Nikki." ...|$|E

500|$|During the 2016 Republican primaries, McCain said {{he would}} support the Republican nominee {{even if it was}} Donald Trump, but {{following}} Mitt Romney's March 3 speech, McCain endorsed the sentiments expressed in that speech, saying he had serious concerns about Trump's [...] "uninformed and indeed dangerous statements on national security issues". [...] Relations between the two had been fraught since early in the Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016, when McCain referred to a room full of Trump supporters as [...] "crazies", and the real estate mogul then said of McCain: [...] "He insulted me, and he insulted everyone in that room... He is a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren't captured... perhaps he was a war hero, but right now he's <b>said</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of very bad things about a lot of people." [...] Following Trump becoming the presumptive nominee of the party on May 3, McCain said that Republican voters had spoken and he would support Trump. [...] McCain himself faced a primary challenge from Kelli Ward, a fervent Trump supporter, and then was expected to face a potentially strong challenge from Democratic Congresswoman Ann Kirkpatrick in the general election. The senator privately expressed worry over the effect that Trump's unpopularity among Hispanic voters might have on his own chances but also was concerned with more conservative pro-Trmp voters; he thus kept his endorsement of Trump in place but tried to speak of him as little as possible given their disagreements. [...] However McCain defeated Ward in the primary by a double-digit percentage point margin and gained a similar lead over Kirkpatrick in general election polls, and when the Donald Trump Access Hollywood controversy broke, he felt secure enough to on October 8 withdraw his endorsement of Trump. McCain stated that Trump's [...] "demeaning comments about women and his boasts about sexual assaults" [...] made it [...] "impossible to continue to offer even conditional support" [...] and added that he would not vote for Hillary Clinton, but would instead [...] "write in the name of some good conservative Republican who is qualified to be president." [...] McCain, now 80 years of age, went on to defeat Kirkpatrick, securing a sixth term as United States States Senator from Arizona.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Esquire that appeared in early August 2016, Eastwood discussed Donald Trump and how this generation, as he put it, is a [...] "pussy generation." [...] "All these people that say, 'Oh, you can't do that, and you can't do this, and you can't say that.' I guess it's just the times." [...] Eastwood also said {{that while he was}} not endorsing Trump, he did see where he was coming from at times, even though the filmmaker stated that the candidate has said dumb things. [...] "What Trump is onto is he's just saying what's on his mind. And sometimes it's not so good. And sometimes it's … I mean, I can understand where he's coming from, but I don't always agree with it. I haven't endorsed anybody. I haven't talked to Trump. I haven't talked to anybody. You know, he's a racist now because he's talked about this judge. And yeah, it's a dumb thing to say.

But everybody—the press and everybody's going, 'Oh, well, that's racist," [...] and they're making a big hoodoo out of it. Just fucking get over it. It's a sad time in history.'" [...] Eastwood also said, when asked if he was still a Libertarian, that he was a little bit of everything and that he wants this generation to get to work and be more understanding instead of calling people names. [...] "Kick ass and take names," [...] Eastwood said. When asked which candidate he would prefer between Trump and Hillary Clinton, Eastwood replied, [...] "That's a tough one, isn't it? I'd have to go for Trump … you know, 'cause she's declared that she's gonna follow in Obama's footsteps. There's been just too much funny business on both sides of the aisle.
