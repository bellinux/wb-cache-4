2500|$|Mr. A.'s wife - Vera's mother - {{had died}} in 1967. In December 1969, when Vera was {{recovering}} from an illness, <b>she</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> mother's framed photograph on the piano and wished they could still talk. With pen in hand Vera found herself writing - with difficulty - on the writing pad in front of her, [...] "I love you Vera." ...|$|E
60|$|Then Miss Kinnaird laughed {{softly as}} <b>she</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> attire.|$|E
60|$|When {{they reached}} the hall <b>she</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> {{companion}} as the light fell on his face.|$|E
6000|$|The widow laughs heartily and really. She {{places a}} {{handkerchief}} over <b>her</b> mouth. <b>She</b> <b>glances</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> brother {{with a pair}} of eyes full of knowing mischief. [...] "Ah, dear James," [...] she says, [...] "you don't {{know what it is to}} have a mother's feelings." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>glanced</b> down <b>at</b> <b>her</b> high-necked {{gown and}} avoided Helen's anxious eyes.|$|R
60|$|She looked up. <b>She</b> shyly <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> eager, {{handsome}} suitor. She gazed tenderly on her furrowed sire.|$|R
60|$|He saw the {{twinkle in}} the girl's eyes as <b>she</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> companion, who sat close by.|$|E
60|$|He sprang {{down from}} the stump, the crowd melted away, and Hetty laughed as <b>she</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> companions.|$|E
60|$|His {{voice had}} a faint thrill in it, and Violet laughed softly as <b>she</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> left hand.|$|E
6000|$|Alora {{read the}} paper twice, with, growing indignation. Then <b>she</b> <b>glanced</b> up <b>at</b> <b>her</b> jailer and muttered questioningly: [...] "Jones? Janet Orme Jones?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! Well, do be careful!" [...] pleaded Laura Porter, as <b>she</b> <b>glanced</b> affectionately <b>at</b> <b>her</b> brother. [...] "A {{revolver}} is such {{a dangerous}} thing!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{glad you}} think that women should be tall," [...] <b>she</b> said, <b>glancing</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> shadow. [...] "The eyes were such as mine, were they not--in colour, I mean?" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> husband, but Mr. Stobell, {{taking an}} {{enormous}} {{bite out of}} a slice of bread and butter, made no sign.|$|E
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> wedding ring, {{and so did}} Lady Belle, who screamed, [...] "You've the impudence to wear that! Give it to me." ...|$|E
60|$|Marjorie {{wanted to}} know why every one didn't get up and leave the room. <b>She</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> mother and came near to speaking.|$|E
60|$|Miss Haldin was {{carrying}} the prayer-book. <b>She</b> did not <b>glance</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> mother.|$|R
6000|$|... "In--in drawing," [...] {{replied the}} queen very slowly, while her {{pretty little head}} {{went up and down}} as <b>she</b> <b>glanced</b> {{alternately}} <b>at</b> <b>her</b> sitter and the sketch-book on her knee; [...] "it--it takes one's mind--so--off--" ...|$|R
60|$|While Ozma sat in {{her pretty}} room engaged in thought <b>she</b> {{happened}} to <b>glance</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> Magic Picture.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, the Warden {{will most}} likely be the new Emperor!" [...] my Lady explained. [...] "Where could we find a better? Unless, perhaps--" [...] <b>she</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> husband.|$|E
6000|$|... "She's {{changing}} her dress," [...] explained Mrs. Marvin, with a smile. <b>She</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> own crumpled attire as she added: [...] "I'm past thinking {{of such things}} as that!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Marvin, who was suggestively pallid, smiled. [...] "She's {{changing}} her dress." [...] <b>She</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> own crumpled attire and added: [...] "I'm past thinking {{of such things}} as that." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>glanced</b> up <b>at</b> him, <b>her</b> eyes {{abruptly}} and slightly moist, half with hurt, half with anger.|$|R
60|$|An idea {{suddenly}} darted into Nancy's brain. At {{first she}} looked aghast. Then <b>she</b> laughed and <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> watch.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Mrs. Ashwood, laying {{aside the}} 'Clarion' with a skeptical shrug of her pretty shoulders, as <b>she</b> <b>glanced</b> up <b>at</b> <b>her</b> brother; [...] "I suppose {{this means that}} you are going to propose again to the young lady?" ...|$|R
60|$|In a {{few more}} minutes, Mrs. Nesbit came in to {{announce}} that a meal was awaiting him. When he went out, Eveline Annersly smiled again as <b>she</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> companion.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course," [...] and Hetty smiled mischievously as <b>she</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> companion. [...] "Still, you needn't be jealous, Chris. I'll {{take the}} best care she doesn't make love to him." ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{stopped a}} moment, and smiled {{in a curious}} fashion as <b>she</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> companion. [...] "I suppose you have heard that they are {{building}} a new peach-house and vinery at Barrock-holme?" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>glanced</b> inquiringly <b>at</b> <b>her</b> mother. To all appearance, Mrs. Vanstone {{had been}} {{alarmed by the}} change in him also. She looked anxious and uneasy; she turned her face away on the sofa pillow--turned it suddenly, {{as if she was}} in pain.|$|R
60|$|When {{they reached}} the garden, Lady Cynthia was alone. <b>She</b> {{scarcely}} <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> Francis. <b>Her</b> eyes were anxiously fixed upon his companion.|$|R
60|$|She knew, at any rate, how to {{take the}} current when it served. So <b>she</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> Festus, folded <b>her</b> lips meaningly, and nodded.|$|R
6000|$|Winifred laughed. [...] "In any case, he doesn't {{drive me}} out here {{every two or three}} weeks, though"--and <b>she</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> {{companion}} provocatively--"he once or twice suggested that he would like to." ...|$|E
60|$|Miss Lillycrop {{expressed}} {{and felt}} great delight {{at the prospect}} of meeting Phil's friend, but the smallest possible shade of anxiety was mingled with the feeling as <b>she</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> very small and not too heavily-loaded table.|$|E
60|$|Tony {{thanked her}} gravely, {{and with a}} little formal goodbye, which {{included}} Hester Earle, {{went out of the}} room. In another minute they heard the outer door close behind him, and Nettieâ€™s color grew a trifle deeper as <b>she</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> companion.|$|E
60|$|Affairs {{were in this}} {{condition}} when Miss Deringham sat listening to the conversation of other visitors {{in the house of}} a friend of Mrs. Forel's one afternoon. Now and then a veiled allusion reached <b>her,</b> and <b>at</b> last <b>she</b> <b>glanced</b> inquiringly <b>at</b> <b>her</b> hostess.|$|R
6000|$|... "It was Miss Ottway who {{recommended}} me," [...] <b>she</b> said, <b>glancing</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> sister, who {{during this}} conversation had sat in silence. Lise's expression, normally suggestive of a discontent not unbecoming to her type, had grown almost sullen. Hannah's brisk gathering {{up of the}} dishes was suddenly arrested.|$|R
6000|$|... "Stuff and nonsense," [...] said Mrs. Holt; [...] "women are {{superior}} to men, and it's our duty {{to keep them in}} order. And if we're really going to risk our lives in your automobile, Mr. Brent, you'd better make sure it's there," [...] <b>she</b> added, <b>glancing</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> watch.|$|R
