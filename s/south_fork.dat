5|$|The United States Geological Survey {{monitors}} {{the flow of}} Big Butte Creek at three different stream gauges: two on the <b>South</b> <b>Fork,</b> {{and one on the}} main stem. Both <b>South</b> <b>Fork</b> gauges were shut down in 1991, but the gauge located near the mouth of Big Butte Creek continues to operate. The main stem often discharges less water than the <b>South</b> <b>Fork</b> alone in the summer months because of numerous diversions.|$|E
5|$|The United States Geological Survey {{monitored}} {{the flow of}} Little Butte Creek at seven different stream gauges: two on the <b>south</b> <b>fork,</b> three on the north fork, and two on the main stem. The first opened in 1908 at the newly constructed Fish Lake Dam on the north fork, while the last opened in 1927 near the Big Elk Ranger Station on the <b>south</b> <b>fork.</b> By 1989, all seven were closed. The data recorded by the lowermost gauges of both forks and the main stem are listed below.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the three main-stem gauges, the USGS operates five other stream gauges in the Bull Run watershed. Each of the following tributaries has one gauge: Fir Creek, Blazed Alder Creek, the North Fork, the <b>South</b> <b>Fork,</b> and the Little Sandy.|$|E

5|$|Kentucky Governor John Y. Brown, Jr., {{the son of}} Cooper's former {{opponent}} in the senatorial elections of 1946 and 1966, awarded Cooper the Governor's Distinguished Service Medallion in 1983. Later that year, Senators Walter Huddleston of Kentucky and Howard Baker of Tennessee introduced a bill to honor Cooper by renaming the Big <b>South</b> <b>Fork</b> National River and Recreation Area to the Cooper National Recreation Area; Kentucky Congressman Hal Rogers sponsored a parallel measure in the House. As a senator, Cooper had been instrumental in securing congressional approval {{for the creation of}} Big <b>South</b> <b>Fork.</b> Opponents of the measure in both Kentucky and Tennessee (the recreation area spans the two states) cited a variety of reasons to retain the old name, and the proposal was eventually dropped at Cooper's request.|$|E
5|$|Milton and Houston Mann {{opened a}} toll road to Yosemite Valley in 1856, up the <b>South</b> <b>Fork</b> of the Merced River. They charged the then {{considerable}} sum of two dollars per person until {{the road was}} bought by Mariposa County, after which it became free.|$|E

5|$|SR202 {{continues}} into unincorporated King County, traveling {{east and}} south around the Sammamish Plateau by following the course of Patterson Creek. The highway turns east at Duthie Hill and passes through Fall City, turning north to cross the Snoqualmie River. At {{the north end of}} the bridge, SR202 intersects SR203 in a roundabout, forming the latter's terminus. The highway continues southeast along the Snoqualmie River, passing Fall City Airport and crossing Tokul Creek via a long hairpin turn. SR202 passes Snoqualmie Falls, enters a roundabout at Tokul Road, and travels south across the Snoqualmie River towards downtown Snoqualmie. From Snoqualmie, it travels southeast through the Three Forks lowlands and crosses the <b>South</b> <b>Fork</b> Snoqualmie River into North Bend. The highway turns southwest onto Bendigo Boulevard and travels through the city's downtown, exiting via a crossing of the <b>South</b> <b>Fork</b> Snoqualmie River. SR202 passes the North Bend Premium Outlets mall and intersects I-90, where it terminates at a partial dumbbell interchange.|$|E
5|$|State Route 190 {{begins at}} State Route 99 {{just south of}} {{downtown}} Tipton in Tulare County and heads straight east along the flat San Joaquin Valley on Avenue 144. There is a short expressway segment in Porterville, including a cloverleaf interchange at State Route 65 and a partial interchange at Main Street, after which the highway begins to curve alongside the Tule River, passing {{the south side of}} Lake Success, as the terrain becomes more rugged. Following the river, it meets the south end of County Route J37, an access road to Balch Park in the Mountain Home State Forest, at the forks of the river near the community of Springville. SR 190 continues east near the Middle Fork and <b>South</b> <b>Fork</b> Middle Fork Tule River to near Camp Nelson, where it begins rising into the foothills, going around many hairpin turns in order to rise to Quaking Aspen, the source of the <b>South</b> <b>Fork</b> Middle Fork {{and the end of the}} western segment of SR 190. The county-maintained Western Divide Highway continues south to a point west of Johnsondale, where traffic can turn east to reach US 395 via Sherman Pass and County Route J41.|$|E
5|$|Fishing, four-wheel driving, swimming, boating, camping, sightseeing, and picnicking are {{the primary}} {{recreational}} activities in the watershed. Whitewater kayaking is also popular in the winter months when water levels are high. Several trails are maintained throughout the Kalmiopsis Wilderness, {{as well as other}} regions in the watershed. Eight boat launches are located on the river between its confluence with the <b>south</b> <b>fork</b> and its mouth. Alfred A. Loeb State Park, located {{on the banks of the}} Chetco, has three cabins and 48 camping sites.|$|E

Numerous developed boat launch sites provide access to rivers for whitewater enthusiasts, and Dagger Falls is the primary launching site for visitors to the Middle Fork of the Salmon River and Frank Church River of No Return Wilderness. Motorized boating is permitted on Anderson Ranch Reservoir, Deadwood Reservoir, and Warm Lake.|$|E
5|$|The Hupa {{lived in}} the fertile Hoopa Valley along the Trinity River and the Hyampom Valley on the <b>South</b> <b>Fork</b> – some of the few flat lands in a region {{otherwise}} dominated by rugged mountains. A Hupa village called Weitspus stood {{at the site of}} present-day Weitchpec at the confluence of the Trinity and Klamath Rivers. The Hupa traded with the coastal Yurok and Karok by using canoes to navigate the Trinity and Klamath Rivers. The trade arrangements with neighboring tribes were complex and involved the use of dentalium shells as currency.|$|E
5|$|The Oregon Canyon Mountains border the Trout Creek Mountains on {{the east}} along the Harney–Malheur county line (according to the United States Geological Survey's definitions), while the Pueblo Mountains are the next range west of the Trout Creek Mountains. The Bilk Creek Mountains in both Oregon and Nevada border the Trout Creek Mountains on the southwest; the two ranges are {{separated}} by Log Cabin Creek and <b>South</b> <b>Fork</b> Cottonwood Creek. South of the Trout Creek Mountains is the Kings River Valley, which separates the Bilk Creek Mountains on the west from the Montana Mountains {{on the east}}.|$|E

5|$|A second road in California {{was built}} by Horace Gasquet, who {{acquired}} a stand of trees at the present site of Gasquet, California— where the North and Middle Forks of the Smith River converge— in 1857. In 1881, he began to build a corduroy road from what had become Gasquet Flats to the plank road at the state line near Oregon Mountain, shown as Old Gasquet Toll Road on USGS maps. Tolls were charged starting in 1882, and in 1887 the road was completed. Gasquet also built a free road from Gasquet Flats along the Smith River {{to the mouth of}} the <b>South</b> <b>Fork,</b> including a suspension bridge across that waterway, and Del Norte County extended it along the Smith River and Mill Creek and over Howland Summit to the Crescent City Plank Road just east of Crescent City.|$|E
5|$|Below Lewiston Dam the Trinity River {{passes the}} towns of Lewiston and Douglas City and turns west, passing within {{a few miles of}} Weaverville, the seat of Trinity County and the main {{population}} center of the area. It then turns northwest, past Junction City, and receives the North Fork Trinity River at Helena. Further west it passes the former mining settlement of Big Bar and enters a deep gorge, which provides the route for Highway 299, the principal road connecting Redding to the Humboldt Bay area. At Burnt Ranch it receives the New River from the north. At Salyer the <b>South</b> <b>Fork,</b> its main tributary, enters from the south, nearly doubling the flow.|$|E
5|$|For many years, {{the four}} lanes from Sacramento stopped at Riverton, where the {{original}} two-lane road {{continued through the}} canyon and over Echo Summit. The state rejected a proposed $133 million total realignment between Riverton and Kyburz in 1985, instead opting for a less expensive program of spot improvements including new bridges and passing lanes. Portions of the work were completed by 1987, including a four-lane bridge at Riverton (though two lanes are used by traffic turning at Ice House Road at {{the east end of}} the bridge). Between White Hall and Kyburz, a pair of four-lane bridges over the <b>South</b> <b>Fork</b> American River, carrying a realignment across a bend in the river, were dedicated on May 31, 1995, as the El Dorado County Veterans Bridges.|$|E
