5000|$|Although some {{safeguards}} {{are included}} {{to limit the}} situations in which law can be modified, the provisions granting these powers have been criticised for being too wide-ranging; in particular section 9, which de facto gives ministers {{the ability to create}} or repeal any law (including itself) and could be used to bypass a Parliamentary vote {{in the final days of}} negotiations. While pro-Remain and <b>Soft</b> <b>Brexit</b> parties have criticised the powers it gives the government, Dominic Cummings of Vote Leave instead criticised the clause for giving too much power to the EU - as section 9 powers can be used to modify the Bill itself, it would empower the government to [...] "ditch almost the entire Bill via final agreement with EU" [...] and backtrack on parts of withdrawal in the final days of negotiations.|$|E
40|$|On {{the face}} of it, Martin Schulz’s {{announcement}} that he is leaving his post {{as president of the}} European Parliament would appear to be good news for British policymakers hoping for a <b>soft</b> <b>Brexit.</b> This is because Schulz has been an outspoken opponent of making concessions to the British government to soften the impact of the UK’s departure...|$|E
40|$|Lowering {{immigration}} {{was the key}} motivation {{behind the}} Brexit vote, and how to achieve it dominates the current political debate. Drawing on new data, Eric Kaufmann analyses the propsects of support for a hard and a <b>soft</b> <b>Brexit,</b> based on how much Britons {{would be willing to}} pay to reduce the number of Europeans entering the UK...|$|E
40|$|Are we {{heading for}} a <b>softer</b> <b>Brexit</b> after the Conservatives’ electoral setback? Piers Ludlow doubts it. There is little to suggest voters were warning Theresa May off a hard Brexit. The Cabinet {{reshuffle}} is unlikely to tip the balance, and even if she returns from Brussels with a softer deal {{it is far from}} clear that Labour would back it...|$|R
5000|$|The High Court {{decision}} {{was met with}} mixed views in the daily press. The Daily Telegraph commented that the High Court ruling increased {{the prospect of an}} early general election, while the Financial Times and The Guardian reported the case as a [...] "blow" [...] or a [...] "setback" [...] to the UK government plans. The financial markets reacted by an increasing exchange rate for the pound sterling against the euro and the dollar, on speculation of a delayed or <b>softer</b> <b>Brexit.</b>|$|R
40|$|This {{paper offers}} {{a cautionary tale}} about the {{economic}} cost of European disintegration. Scotland provides an interesting twist on that story as somewhere that voted to remain part of the EU, but is now likely to be negatively affected, {{even though it is}} less directly exposed to EU trade than the UK. This occurs even if it were to achieve the <b>softer</b> <b>Brexit</b> with continued single market membership to which it aspires. The analysis includes potentially important lessons for the many nations and regions in which there exists pressures to move away from trade liberalization and towards protectionism...|$|R
40|$|Will the {{decision}} to back a <b>soft</b> <b>Brexit</b> hurt Labour’s prospects in the upcoming election further, or would it help? And what would it do to Labour’s prospects in the long run? Ben Margulies looks at the evidence and explains how Labour can avoid becoming irrelevant {{and how it can}} recover its position as the leading party of the left...|$|E
40|$|The Brexit {{negotiations}} continued {{this week}} with the UK government still insisting that the endpoint be an exit from the EU, including its Customs Union and the Single Market. But back in Britain, the turmoil is obvious, with different members of government taking diverging views, suggesting, at times, that a <b>soft</b> <b>Brexit</b> or a transition arrangement might be possible, {{even if it means}} concessions {{on the role of the}} European Court of Justice (ECJ), the exit payment, the rights of EU citizens and even (temporarily) continued freedom of movement of EU citizens...|$|E
40|$|The {{process of}} leaving the European Union (EU) will have {{profound}} consequences for health and the National Health Service (NHS) in the UK. In this paper, we use the WHO health system building blocks framework to assess the likely effects of three scenarios we term <b>soft</b> <b>Brexit,</b> hard Brexit, and failed Brexit. We conclude that each scenario poses substantial threats. The workforce of the NHS is heavily reliant on EU staff. Financing of health care for UK citizens in the EU and vice versa is threatened, as is access to some capital funds, while Brexit threatens overall economic performance. Access to pharmaceuticals, technology, blood, and organs for transplant is jeopardised. Information used for international comparisons is threatened, as is service delivery, especially in Northern Ireland. Governance concerns relate to public health, competition and trade law, and research. However, we identified a few potential opportunities for improvement {{in areas such as}} competition law and flexibility of training, should the UK Government take them. Overall, a soft version of Brexit would minimise health threats whereas failed Brexit would be the riskiest outcome. Effective parliamentary scrutiny of policy and legal changes will be essential, but the scale of the task risks overwhelming parliament and the civil service. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper studies local {{economic}} {{impacts of}} the increases in trade barriers associated with Brexit. Predictions of the local impact of Brexit are presented under two different scenarios, <b>soft</b> and hard <b>Brexit,</b> which are developed from a structural trade model. Average effects are predicted to be negative under both scenarios, and to be more negative under hard Brexit. The spatial variation in negative shocks across areas is higher {{in the latter case}} as some local areas are particularly specialised in sectors that are predicted to be badly hit by hard Brexit. Areas in the South of England, and urban areas, are harder hit by Brexit under both scenarios. Again, this pattern is explained by sector specialisation. Finally, the areas that were most likely to vote remain are those that are predicted to be most negatively impacted by Brexit...|$|R
40|$|F]ree {{movement}} of people {{is one of the}} four essential freedoms. These four freedoms are indivisible. This is how our Single Market works. And let me be clear: the integrity of the Single Market will never be compromised in these negotiations’ (Michel Barnier). ‘In a colourful interview with the Czech daily Hospodářské noviny Mr Johnson [was quoted] as using the word "bollocks" in reference to the idea of the free {{movement of}} people being a founding principle of the EU. To many EU officials the union’s four freedoms – goods, services, capital and the free {{movement of people}} – are essential to membership. But in the interview, Mr Johnson, added: "It's a total myth - nonsense. It is stupid to say that freedom of movement is a fundamental right. It's something that has been acquired by a series of decisions by the courts. And everyone now has in his head that every human being has a fundamental, God-given right to go and move wherever he wants. But it is not. It was never a founding principle of the European Union. It's a complete myth. Total myth’ (Boris Johnson). Michel Barnier wants to defend the four freedoms as indivisible, while Boris Johnson wants to shatter their unity. Michel Barnier adopts an elegantly thoughtful tone while Boris Johnson prefers oafish truculence. But in the background both are working on a common understanding: that the EU’s internal market is a political construct, and that its nature is open to contestation. They are right. It is not only a political construct – internal market lawyers are not out of a job. But there is a remarkably range of ambiguities in the legal definition of the EU’s internal market (and related phenomena such as the EEA) and within those vacant spaces political choices are required to determine its shape and direction. The internal market is a legal concept that is both ambiguous and marked by heterogeneity. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to traverse the ambiguous and heterogenous character of the EU’s internal market (and related phenomena such as the EEA) and to explain that there are in fact several ‘internal markets’ to be found in and beyond the EU. This paper is not about Brexit: it is about the definition of the internal market. But Brexit has brought into focus that troublingly imprecise definition, and some of the confusion about hard and <b>soft</b> versions of <b>Brexit</b> stems from the absence of a secure anchor for the debate (though some too stems from calculated misrepresentation of the options, not least by the egregious Mr Johnson). </p...|$|R
40|$|Financial {{services}} {{constitute an}} important net export for the UK economy, {{for which the}} rest of the EU is the largest market. This paper considers the likely consequences of Brexit for this sector. A ‘soft’ Brexit, whereby the UK leaves the EU but remains in the single market, would be a lower-risk option for the City than other Brexit options, because it would enable financial services firms to continue to rely on regulatory passporting rights. Under a ‘hard’ Brexit scenario, where the UK leaves the single market, the UK might in principle be able to benefit from the EU’s third country ‘equivalence’ frameworks for financial services, but these are cumbrous and incomplete alternatives to passporting. UK firms would find it considerably more costly to export to the EU. This would also be a loss to the EU 27, because the UK specializes in capital markets services for which the EU, over-reliant on banking, recognizes a need. However, much of this ‘UK’ activity is provided by subsidiaries of US-headquartered groups. In the event of hard Brexit, these firms may be able to compete just as effectively from New York as from London. If <b>soft</b> <b>Brexit</b> proves politically impossible, it seems highly desirable that the UK push for a transition period of continued EU membership pending at the very least completion of equivalence determinations and, more usefully, the conclusion of a suitable bilateral agreement...|$|E
