Although not as destructive as the volcanism at vent sites of the mid-ocean ridges, the dynamics of shallow hydrate formation and movement will clearly affect sessile animals that form part of the seepage barrier. There is potential of a catastrophic event where an entire layer of shallow hydrate could break free of the bottom and considerably affect local communities of chemosynthetic fauna. At deeper depths (>1,000 m, >3,281ft), the bottom-water temperature is colder (by approximately 3°C) and undergoes less fluctuation. The formation of more stable and probably deeper hydrates influences the flux of light hydrocarbon gases to the sediment surface, thus influencing the <b>surface</b> <b>morphology</b> and characteristics of chemosynthetic communities. Within complex communities such as Bush Hill, petroleum seems less important than previously thought (MacDonald, 1998b).|$|E

The FESEM images of the exterior shapes and the enlarged surfaces for the CNT-A (without Al interlayer) and CNT-C (with Al interlayer) emitters are compared in Figure  1. It seemed that no significant differences in their <b>surface</b> <b>morphologies</b> were observed. It was also observed in this study that thermal treatment hardly affected the <b>surface</b> <b>morphologies</b> of the CNTs, although their FESEM images are not displayed in Figure  1. This may indicate that neither the coating of Al interlayer nor the thermal treatment altered the structural aspect ratios of the CNTs. Also, this may be in good agreement with the results that the β values were similar for all of the CNTs.|$|R

The rough <b>surface</b> <b>morphologies</b> are characterized by laminar and jagged structures formed {{on the surface of}} stainless steel fibers.

The interaction between heat transfer and deformation during the early stages of solidification is considered in this work.
