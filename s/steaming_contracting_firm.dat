It is a challenge for earthwork <b>contracting</b> <b>firms</b> to capture information and transform it into knowledge that is available for sharing. This study involves a survey on determining the level of implementation of knowledge transferring (KT) process by earthwork <b>contracting</b> <b>firms.</b> Questionnaire forms were distributed to 120 relevant <b>contracting</b> <b>firms</b> in Johor Bahru and Kuala Lumpur.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyse the {{structure}} of wages of workers in <b>contract</b> <b>firms</b> for a two-period economy {{in which there is}} interfirm mobility. A <b>contract</b> <b>firm</b> provides specific training for a worker during the first period, which increases his productivity if he stays in the second period, but the worker may quit to join an alternative firm after a successful search. When the worker cannot borrow in capital markets, the motive for consumption smoothing dominates and the <b>contract</b> <b>firm</b> acts as a banker and sets wage above marginal product in the first period and below it in the second. When the worker can borrow, insurance is the dominant concern and the <b>contract</b> <b>firm</b> acts instead as an insurer by setting the first-period wage below marginal product and the second-period wage above it. This dichotomy will fade away if the contract includes an exit fee as a quit penalty. © 1995. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|This study {{attempts}} {{to examine the}} differences in the collaborative activities between the Turkish <b>contracting</b> <b>firms</b> that are listed as the “Top 225 International Contractors” by Engineering News Record (ENR), according to their international revenues, and other large <b>contracting</b> <b>firms</b> that are not on this list. For this purpose, 30 large-scale Turkish general <b>contracting</b> <b>firms,</b> including 15 listed by the ENR, have been examined in terms of their collaborations during the innovation process as well as the levels of significance for the sources of information that serve as the means of “sources of innovation”. Results show some remarkable differences between the top-listed firms and other large-scale contracting companies. The levels of importance indicated for the collaborations made with “universities and research institutions” and the sources of information “conferences, fairs and exhibitions” and “scientific/ technical publications” show remarkable {{differences between the two groups}} of companies. Contractors who are not ENR listed are more active in making collaborations. While the number of collaborations is increasing in the timeline, both groups of contractors indicate the most important collaborations as “consultants, private R&D institutions” and “suppliers”. Findings also show a decreasing interest against collaborations with universities. Finally, findings of the research are discussed in the context of innovation, expecting to contribute to international <b>contracting</b> <b>firms</b> in evaluating their innovation approaches to their competitive advantage...|$|R

Strategic alliances in building construction may be a useful evaluation criterion in assisting public sector construction managers evaluate and select tenders and encourage more co-operative relationships amongst construction project team members. This paper reviews competitiveness of the Australian building construction industry {{in the context of}} the theory of {{strategic alliance}}s between <b>contracting</b> <b>firms</b> and subcontractors; and explores whether implementing strategic alliances provides <b>contracting</b> <b>firms</b> any competitive advantage over competitors. A theoretical concept of strategic alliances is proposed and appropriate indicators of competitive advantage are developed. An analysis framework comprising six attributes of strategic alliances—trust, commitment, interdependence, co-operation, communication and joint problem solving is described. These attributes were used to collect data from 59 building construction firms in South-East Queensland to assess their respective levels of strategic alliance. The formation of strategic alliance relationships between <b>contracting</b> <b>firms</b> and subcontractors is proposed as a component of the tender evaluation process for public works sector...|$|R
