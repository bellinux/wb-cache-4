2500|$|An {{understanding}} of the relationship between electricity and magnetism began in 1819 with work by Hans Christian Ørsted, a professor at the University of Copenhagen, who discovered by the accidental twitching of a compass needle near a wire that an electric current could create a magnetic field. [...] This landmark experiment is known as Ørsted's Experiment. [...] Several other experiments followed, with André-Marie Ampère, who in 1820 discovered that the magnetic field circulating in a closed-path was related to the current flowing through the perimeter of the path; Carl Friedrich Gauss; Jean-Baptiste Biot and Félix <b>Savart,</b> both of whom in 1820 came up with the Biot–Savart law giving an equation for the magnetic field from a current-carrying wire; Michael Faraday, who in 1831 found that a time-varying magnetic flux through a loop of wire induced a voltage, and others finding further links between magnetism and electricity. James Clerk Maxwell synthesized and expanded these insights into Maxwell's equations, unifying electricity, magnetism, and optics into the field of electromagnetism. In 1905, Einstein used these laws in motivating his theory of special relativity, requiring that the laws held true in all inertial reference frames.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe Laboratoire National des Champs Magnétiques Intenses (LNCMI) is {{a member}} of the European Magnetic Field Laboratory (EMFL). This is the French {{facility}} enabling researchers to perform experiments in the highest possible magnetic fields. The numerical modeling jointly developed with the Center of Modeling and Simulation of Strasbourg (Cemosis) plays an essential role in the understanding and the optimization of such magnets based on the so-called polyhelix technique (a magnet is a set of Copper alloy tubes cut by Electrical Discharge Machining). In the context of this collaboration, a full 3 D multi-physics model dedicated to the study of LNCMI resistive high field magnets has been implemented. Applications of this model have shown a 3 D behaviour of the magnetic field, specifically in the vicinity of the beginnings and ends of the helical cuts. The effect is greater than what is commonly expected by experts. To validate our model and this unexpected behaviour, dedicated measurement campaigns were carried out both on a real magnet insert and on a low field test bench. In this paper, we will describe the in-situ and low field testbench setups used to perform a 3 D mapping of the magnetic field. We will briefly detail the ingredients of our numerical model, especially the parallel algorithm proposed to apply efficiently the Biot and <b>Savart’s</b> law for computing the magnetic field produced by magnet inserts and seen by the researchers. Finally we will present the comparative study based on calculations and measurements that confirm the 3 D distribution of the magnetic field and therefore validate to some extent our modeling choices.

40|$|On {{the basis}} of archaeological and written sources and {{linguistic}} studies, the issues of Hungarians’ early ethnic history before they found their homeland on the Danube are analyzed in the article. The ethnic core of the Magyars (proto-Magyars) was formed in the Tobol-Irtysh forest-steppe zone within the Sargat archaeological community. After the split of the latter in the 2 nd quarter of the 1 st millennium, {{a part of the}} population migrated to the southern areas of Eastern Europe with the Hun Horde. The remaining component groups of the Sargatskaya archaeological community formed closely related ethno-cultural entities, mixing up with the forest population of the border zone. In written sources, the ancestors of Magyars are fixed as the Savirs (Savyrs, <b>Savarts).</b> For the first time, they are mentioned in the works by Byzantine authors {{after the collapse of the}} Hun ethno-political union in the mid- 5 th c. The Savirs inhabited the territory of the Volga-Don interfluve and had stayed under the aegis of the Khazar Khaganate since its formation in the mid- 7 th c. and until the Pecheneg intrusion from the Trans-Volga steppes in the late 9 th c. Later, the Savirs got divided, and a part of them, led by the Magyars, resettled to the Northern Black Sea area, and soon to Pannonia. The groups of population closely related to them, who had left the Kushnarenkovo-type (2 nd half of the 6 th c.) and the Karayakupovo-type (2 nd half of the 8 th c) sites, moved from the trans-Urals to the Volga-Urals regions.

5000|$|The <b>savart</b> {{is named}} after the French {{physicist}} and doctor Félix <b>Savart</b> (1791-1841) who advocated the earlier similar interval of the French acoustician Joseph Sauveur (1653-1716). Sauveur proposed the méride, eptaméride (or heptaméride), and decaméride. In English these are meride, heptameride, and decameride respectively. The octave is divided into 43 merides, the meride is divided into seven heptamerides, and the heptameride is divided into ten decamerides. There are thus 43 &times; 7 [...] 301 heptamerides in an octave. The attraction of this scheme to Sauveur was that log10(2) {{is very close to}} [...]301, and thus the number of heptamerides in a given ratio is found to a high degree of accuracy from simply its log times 1000. This is equivalent to assuming 1000 heptamerides in a decade rather than 301 in an octave, the same as Savart's definition. The unit was given the name <b>savart</b> sometime in the 20th century. [...] A disadvantage of this scheme is that there are not an exact number of heptamerides/savarts in an equal tempered semitone. For this reason Alexander Wood used a modified definition of the <b>savart,</b> with 300 savarts in an octave, and hence 25 savarts in a semitone.|$|E

Savart's specific contribution was to attach a tachometer to the axis of the toothed wheel to facilitate calibration of the tooth rate. <b>Savart</b> used his wheel as a practical alternative to John Robison's siren, which was also being adopted at the time by Charles Cagniard de la Tour to test the range of human hearing. By 1834 <b>Savart</b> was constructing brass wheels with a width of 82 cm, containing as many as 720 teeth. These wheels, which could produce frequencies up to 24 kHz, have been tentatively proposed as the first artificial generators of ultrasound.|$|E
5000|$|A related unit is the jot, {{of which}} there are 30103 in an octave, or {{approximately}} 100,000 in a decade.
