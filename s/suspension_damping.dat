The struts are inverted to deliver higher bending rigidity (thanks to larger damping tube diameter) and less damping fade {{as a result}} of increased piston size. Springs are mounted offset so their centreline coincides with the pivot axis. This reduces road shock and - by minimising bump and rebound friction - provides less vibration.|$|E

50|$|Because the Bosto was {{designed}} for heavy loads, {{as opposed to the}} sedan version of the Syrena, the suspension underneath was modified. An extended chassis held a rear trailing axle on leaf suspension, each with a hydraulic <b>suspension</b> <b>damper.</b> This allowed a lower floor level, and in turn allowed FSM to borrow directly parts from the Zuk A05/A06.|$|R
50|$|After {{the track}} was cleared of debris, {{the race was}} {{restarted}} behind the safety car. Hamilton led at the restart from Vettel, Massa, Stroll, and Ricciardo. Ricciardo passed both Williams cars at turn 1 and settled into third place. Hülkenberg collided with the wall on lap 25 {{and was forced to}} retire from 6th place. On the next lap, Felipe Massa retired due to a broken <b>suspension</b> <b>damper.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Since both {{cars were}} {{intended}} for the entry-level market, chassis layout was extremely simple. The modular rear end was located to the chassis tub by a hinge joint. Rear <b>suspension</b> <b>damping</b> was via a single vertically mounted spring shock absorber. The equally simple front suspension consisted of a trailing arm on either side, each damped by a spring shock.|$|E

5000|$|Like other in-wheel motors, the ActiveWheel design {{provides}} {{direct power}} delivery of approximately , {{as well as}} regenerative braking. In addition, it replaces a mechanical suspension with an active suspension driven by an in-wheel electrical suspension motor that controls torque distribution, traction, turning maneuvers, pitch, roll and <b>suspension</b> <b>damping</b> for that wheel. However, the effects of shocks, water and snow to such an [...] "in-wheel" [...] design have not been precisely studied.|$|E
30|$|The {{use of the}} {{aforementioned}} two suspension elements, lateral dampers at primary suspension and longitudinal suspension dampers at the secondary suspension (anti-yaw dampers), results in higher manufacturing and assembly costs of the rail vehicle {{in addition to the}} additional maintenance and operation costs. Therefore, the two viscous dampers, lateral <b>suspension</b> <b>damper</b> of the primary suspension and longitudinal anti-yaw dampers of secondary suspension, are not used in the suspension system of the rapid transit vehicle.|$|R
50|$|There {{are only}} very minor changes between the 1988 model {{year and the}} 1989-1991 model years. In 1989, the front <b>suspension</b> <b>damper</b> rods were changed to have only two (rather than four for the 1988) holes. The front brake {{calipers}} were also changed to have screw-on covers over the mounting pins. In 1991, the oil lines were run internally through the engine, rather than externally. The Canadian model was identical to the US model except for the colors.|$|R

5000|$|The Intrepid was {{available}} in two trim levels: base and the sportier, better-equipped ES, which added four-wheel disc brakes, 16" [...] wheels with better tires, and stiffer [...] "touring" [...] <b>suspension</b> <b>damping.</b> All Intrepids received driver and front passenger airbags, a rarity at the time, as well as air conditioning and the four-speed automatic transmission. Anti-lock brakes were optional, as was traction control and the more powerful 3.5 L SOHC engine rated at (214 hp).|$|E
5000|$|Perhaps {{the most}} highly {{regarded}} option is a computer-controlled <b>suspension</b> <b>damping</b> system called [...] "Skyhook". [...] This adaptive damping system uses coil-over shock absorbers {{and a set of}} six accelerometers that continually monitor the movement of the wheels and car body and transmits this information to a control unit. [...] The vehicle's computer analyzes this data and coordinates it with the Cambiocorsa transmission and other Maserati safety systems. Skyhook then calculates, and recalculates, the data at least 40 times per second and instantaneously adjusts each shock absorber accordingly. [...] When placed in the Sport mode, the suspension firms up for better cornering.|$|E
50|$|The KR200 was {{developed}} on the Kabinenroller platform and replaced the KR175 in 1955. Based {{on the same}} frame and an evolution of the original suspension, the KR200 had {{a large number of}} detail changes. On 29-30 August 1955, a modified KR200 with a tuned engine, revised gear ratios, redundant control cables, a one-off streamlined body, and stock <b>suspension,</b> <b>damping,</b> steering, and brakes, was run at the Hockenheimring for twenty-four hours. During the run, the vehicle set twenty-two closed-circuit speed records for three-wheeled vehicles with displacements up to 250 cc, including the fifty-mile record at 107 km/h and the twenty-four-hour record at 103 km/h.|$|E
25|$|New to the GS {{line was}} an {{electric}} power steering (EPS) system, and both the V8 and hybrid models featured a variable gear ratio steering (VGRS) system and Electronically Controlled Brake (ECB) a type of brake-by-wire system. V8 and hybrid models also featured an adaptive suspension system that individually altered <b>suspension</b> <b>damper</b> firmness. Vehicle Dynamics Integrated Management (VDIM) was standard on the GS 430, 460, and 450h models and coupled to VGRS, with which it could alter steering gear ratios.|$|R

5000|$|Again {{depending}} on the model, the 164 could feature automatic climate control and electronically controlled <b>damping</b> <b>suspension</b> - the latter, for example, in the sports-oriented Quadrifoglio Verde ("Green Cloverleaf [...] ") and 164S models.

50|$|Top speeds in the National Class {{are easily}} {{as high as}} in the other junior {{formulae}} of BMW and Renault, but cornering speeds tend to be lower as Formula Ford cars lack the downforce-producing aerodynamic aids on the other cars; handling is therefore entirely down to mechanical grip, {{and the lack of}} wings ensures that cars following another are not aerodynamically disadvantaged, allowing some of the closest racing with plenty of overtaking. Series' rules may permit slick or treaded tyres, generally supplied either by Dunlop or Avon. As the rules limit engine modifications, all cars are relatively equal and racing results tend to be close. Formula Fords allow <b>suspension,</b> <b>damping,</b> gearing and braking bias changes, but not aerodynamic options such as winged cars.|$|E
50|$|The {{ride height}} is 20 mm {{lower than the}} {{standard}} Golf. Golf R models equipped with the optional 'DCC' (Dynamic Chassis Control), offer 3 suspension modes: 'Comfort', 'Normal', and 'Race'. Each mode adjusts the stiffness of the <b>suspension</b> <b>damping,</b> thereby offering drivers a way {{to change the way}} the vehicle responds by the push of a button. Comfort mode places the dampers in the softest setting, increasing the absorption of road imperfections allowing for a smoother and more comfortable ride. Race mode stiffens the dampers to their most aggressive setting, reducing body movements and increasing adhesion to the road for more precise high speed driving. Race mode also increases throttle response, firms up the steering for a heftier feel, and alters the shift pattern of the DSG gearbox (where fitted) as well as increases the speed of the Adaptive headlamps (AFS) response time.|$|E
50|$|The ZL1’s {{power is}} complemented by {{exclusive}} performance technologies, including {{the third generation}} of Magnetic Ride suspension and Performance Traction Management. Brembo calipers with six pistons per wheel in front and four pistons per wheel in back handle stopping. A duct system delivers air from the grille to the hard-working rotors. The 20-inch forged-aluminum wheels are fitted with second-generation Goodyear Eagle F1 Supercar radials (285/35ZR-20 in front, 305/35ZR-20 in back). Damping is provided by Magnetic Ride Control units {{similar to those that}} Cadillac and Corvette have long used. This system can sense the need for a damping correction 1000 times per second and make that change in only five milliseconds. The Performance Traction Management (PTM) system was originally engineered for the Corvette C6 ZR1. In addition to modulating engine torque for optimum launch performance in manual-equipped ZL1s, PTM also varies the traction control and <b>suspension</b> <b>damping</b> as needed. The five available modes are for wet, dry, sport with or without stability control, and race-driving conditions.|$|E

40|$|In the {{automotive}} industry, numerous expensive and time-consuming trials {{are used to}} “optimize” the ride and handling performance. Ideally, a reliable virtual prototype is a solution. The practical usage of a model is linked and restricted by the model complexity and reliability. The object {{of this study is}} development and analysis of a refined quarter car suspension model, which includes the effect of series stiffness, to estimate the response at higher frequencies; resulting Maxwell's model representation does not allow straightforward calculation of performance parameters. Governing equations of motion are manipulated to calculate the effective stiffness and damping values. State space model is arranged in a novel form to find eigenvalues, which is a unique contribution. Analysis shows the influence of <b>suspension</b> <b>damping</b> and series stiffness on natural frequencies and regions of reduced vibration response. Increase in the <b>suspension</b> <b>damping</b> coefficient beyond optimum values was found to reduce the modal damping and increase the natural frequencies. Instead of carrying out trial simulations during performance optimization for human comfort, an expression is developed for corresponding <b>suspension</b> <b>damping</b> coefficient. The analysis clearly shows the influence of the series stiffness on suspension dynamics and necessity to incorporate the model in performance predictions...|$|E
30|$|Longitudinal <b>suspension</b> <b>damping</b> at {{secondary}} suspensions had {{a negligible}} {{effect on the}} tangent track response of the car body of a rapid transit vehicle. This suspension element is also neglected in the final model. Similarly, the effect of longitudinal <b>suspension</b> <b>damping</b> is tested by adding a viscous damper to the longitudinal secondary suspension and then by comparing simulation results for zero and non-zero damping values. The yaw motion between bogie and car body remains {{in a very small}} range of angular motion (≈ 10 ^- 3 rad), Fig. 7. The amplitudes of yaw motion are very small meaning that motion itself remains very small during tangent track analysis which leads to negligible effect of the longitudinal secondary suspension dampers on car body yaw motion.|$|E
40|$|The {{suspension}} {{springs and}} dampers, employed in road vehicles, typically exhibit nonlinear and asymmetric force-deflection and force-velocity characteristics. The asymmetric {{characteristics of the}} suspension components are characterized to investigate the phenomenon of drift in dynamic equilibrium, {{also known as the}} 'ride height drift'. A quarter-vehicle model, incorporating nonlinear and asymmetric suspension components, is mathematically modeled and simulated using 'simulink'. <b>Suspension</b> <b>damper</b> is represented by multistage nonlinear asymmetric characteristics, while the stiffness is treated as a nonlinear cubical spring, asymmetric in compression and rebound. The model results are validated by comparing the responses over a wide frequency range with the published data. A comprehensive parametric study is performed to establish the influence of variation in design and operating parameters of suspension components on 'ride height drifting' phenomenon. The study clearly reveals that the 'ride height drifting' phenomenon {{is a direct result of}} asymmetric properties of the <b>suspension</b> <b>damper.</b> The magnitude of the drift increases with an increase in asymmetry as well as amplitude of excitation, and it approaches maximum corresponding to the wheel hop natural frequency. Reduced damping with a fixed asymmetry also tends to increase the magnitude of drift over the entire frequency range. The results further suggest that, the suspension spring with hardening and softening characteristics in compression and extension, respectively, yields the sprung mass drift in the opposite direction. Suspension springs with asymmetric characteristics may thus reduce the magnitude of the sprung mass drift...|$|R

40|$|Three-dimensional ride {{dynamic model}} {{of an urban}} bus, {{developed}} in {{first part of the}} study, is applied to determine desirable <b>suspension</b> <b>damping</b> through subjective tuning and objective parametric optimisation under a wide range of operating conditions, including vehicle speed, load, road roughness and tyre inflation pressure. While the subjective method relies on the motion perception of the experimenter, the objective approach is limited to performance measures considered in the optimisation problem. The results suggest that both the objective and subjective methods could yield enhanced driver ride and dynamic tyre loads over the most probable ranges of operating conditions when compared with the baseline dampers. The ride responses of the candidate bus equipped with subjectively tuned dampers were subsequently measured, which further demonstrated applicability of the model for <b>suspension</b> <b>damping</b> tuning for enhancing both the driver- and road-friendliness...|$|E
30|$|Figure  7 shows that, with an {{increase}} in vehicle <b>suspension</b> <b>damping,</b> the vertical vibration of the car body decreases at a frequency lower than 1  Hz and increases above 1  Hz. The vertical vibration of the bogie decreases at a frequency lower than 10  Hz and increases above 10  Hz. The vertical vibration of the wheel–rail force increases at a frequency lower than 50  Hz, appreciably decreases within the range of 50 – 80  Hz, and slightly decreases above 80  Hz. The vertical vibration of the rail decreases within the range of 50 – 80  Hz. An increase in vehicle <b>suspension</b> <b>damping</b> thus effectively reduces the low-frequency vertical vibration of the car body and bogie as well as the vertical vibration of the wheel–rail force and track structure at 50 – 80  Hz, but is unfavorable in terms of mid-frequency and high-frequency vertical vibrations of the vehicle system.|$|E
40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in the Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part D: Journal of Automobile Engineering [SAGE © IMechE] and the definitive version is available at: [URL] paper aims to quantify the influences of non-steady state tyre behaviour and <b>suspension</b> <b>damping</b> on the instantaneous response of a vehicle to handling manoeuvres. The influences of such parameters cannot be determined using steady state tests. In the present work, a recently developed methodology is employed, which has been applied in the past to simple transient handling studies. Here, the approach is applied to more demanding situations and the effects of tyre lags and <b>suspension</b> <b>damping</b> are directly related to the under-steer, over-steer, or neutral-steer character of the vehicle under test. To distinguish between the effects of tyre force lags, tyre non-linearities, and combined tyre–vehicle non-linearities, an increasingly complex approach is adopted, which involves the implementation of a linear bicycle model, a non-linear bicycle model, and a ten-degrees-of-freedom (10 DOF) non-linear vehicle model. In all cases, tyre-force lags are simulated using the relaxation length concept. The 10 DOF vehicle model is validated against experimental measurements and forms the basis for fully non-linear studies. It is shown that even inherently under-steering vehicles may initially over-steer {{as a result of the}} delayed response of tyres. Finally, it is demonstrated that the proposed approach captures the effect of <b>suspension</b> <b>damping</b> and some problems are discussed regarding its application...|$|E

On the basis of these analyses, a conclusion is drawn that secondary lateral damping is the most sensitive <b>suspension</b> <b>damper.</b> Subsequently, the secondary lateral dampers are replaced with magnetorheological fluid (MRF) dampers. Finally, a high-speed train model with MRF dampers is simulated by a combined ADAMS and MATLAB simulation and tested in a roller rig test platform to investigate the mechanism of how the MRF damper affects the train 2 ̆ 7 s stability and critical speed. The results show that the semi-active suspension installed with MRF dampers substantially improves the stability and critical speed of the train...|$|R
