5000|$|The {{first known}} {{practical}} <b>sensitometer,</b> which allowed {{measurements of the}} speed of photographic materials, was invented by the Polish engineer Leon Warnerke - pseudonym of [...] (1837-1900) - in 1880, among the achievements for which he was awarded the Progress Medal of the Photographic Society of Great Britain in 1882. It was commercialized since 1881.|$|E
5000|$|This {{telescope}} {{is used to}} study galactic structure, stellar spectra, asteroid studies, supernovae, and to photograph heavy bodies. The main lens diameter is 71.12 cm, the correcting bi-concave and convex lens is 50 cm with a focal length of 2.5 m. It is also equipped with a spectral prism with a prime angle of 6.10 degrees for stellar spectra, a wedge <b>sensitometer</b> and a film recorder.|$|E
50|$|The film lab thus needs various {{apparatus}} {{from developing}} equipment and machines, over measuring tools, cutting, editing devices, and printers to different sorts of viewing machinery including classic projectors. Besides there are <b>sensitometers,</b> densitometers, analysers, and array of chemical laboratory items {{that will help}} maintaining a level of repeatability of operations. Auxiliary material is also encountered within a film laboratory, for example leader film, plain plastic, to keep a developing machine threaded up.|$|R
5000|$|The {{system was}} later {{extended}} to cover larger ranges {{and some of}} its practical shortcomings were addressed by the Austrian scientist Josef Maria Eder (1855-1944) and Flemish-born botanist [...] (1896-1960), (who, in 1919/1920, jointly developed their Eder-Hecht neutral wedge <b>sensitometer</b> measuring emulsion speeds in Eder-Hecht grades). Still, it remained difficult for manufactures to reliably determine film speeds, often only by comparing with competing products, so that an increasing number of modified semi-Scheiner-based systems started to spread, which no longer followed Scheiner's original procedures and thereby defeated the idea of comparability.|$|E
50|$|The Warnerke Standard <b>Sensitometer</b> {{consisted}} of a frame holding an opaque screen {{with an array of}} typically 25 numbered, gradually pigmented squares brought into contact with the photographic plate during a timed test exposure under a phosphorescent tablet excited before by the light of a burning Magnesium ribbon. The speed of the emulsion was then expressed in 'degrees' Warnerke (sometimes seen as Warn. or °W.) corresponding with the last number visible on the exposed plate after development and fixation. Each number represented an increase of 1/3 in speed, typical plate speeds were between 10° and 25° Warnerke at the time.|$|E
50|$|He {{made many}} inventions {{in the field}} of photography. Małachowski, first {{developed}} in 1875 the camera system, which acted like modern cameras. His system was based on the photosensitive layer of dry collodion imposed on the paper covered with a layer of gum arabic. After exposure, the layer of collodion was through a complex process, transferred to a glass substrate. This material is also suitable for printing positive. Photosensitive material in a roll was placed in a special cartridge which allows to perform up to 100 photos. The design of this camera was based on entirely new solutions that allow {{for the first time to}} perform such a large number of images on a single cartridge is loaded. Unfortunately, high production costs have prevented the proliferation of these films and their disposal.Małachowski in 1880 invented the first practical <b>sensitometer,</b> which allows measurement of the speed of photographic materials.He also discovered the phenomenon of tanning the exposed parts gelatin emulsion by pyro developer, which later found its application in Bromoil Process. Malachowski has developed the basic concepts of this photographic technique for which he was awarded the Progress Medal of the Photographic Society of Great Britain (known as Royal Photographic Society today) in 1882.|$|E

This problem involves designing, constructing, and verifying the <b>sensitometer.</b> Designing the <b>sensitometer</b> is done by looking at different methods of exposing each dye layer of a photographic color paper. These methods include: fiber optics or light guides, light integrating devices, and projection systems. The method which was chosen for this experiment is the projection system.

40|$|PHAKOCHRONOLOGY 4 is {{the science}} of {{determining}} the time of events that affect the crystal-line lens during its lifetime. In this study the lens {{is considered to be}} a <b>sensitometer</b> and a chronograph recording and dating structural changes caused by local and systemic dis-turbances. While the term phakochronology is new, some of the underlying phenomena are well known to ophthalmologists. I am concerned herein with developing methods for dating structural changes in the lens. The Lens as a <b>Sensitometer</b> and a Chronograph The avascular lens depends on the surrounding aqueous medium to maintain its integrity. Alterations in the composition of the aqueous milieu as a result of hyperglycaemia, galactosaemia, and other metabolic, endocrine, and nutritional disorders frequently produce opacities and other structural changes in the lens. Moreover, sunlight, trauma, and radiation may cause direct injury to the cells of the lens and are not mediated by the aqueous medium (Bellows, 1944). A 11 these disturbances are registered in the lens as if it were a <b>sensitometer.</b> Not only is the lens a <b>sensitometer,</b> but it may also be regarded as a chronograph whic...|$|E
40|$|An Intensity Scale <b>Sensitometer</b> {{for testing}} the {{photographic}} response of Graphic Arts materials was built and evaluated. The <b>sensitometer</b> utilizes a stepped area diaphragm and a cylindrical lens {{to produce a}} stepped illuminance distribution at the film plane. Both tungsten and pulsed xenon lamps are provided. A computer aided study was used to find the optimum lamp position {{with respect to the}} reflector. A scanning aperture type shutter located at the stepped diaphragm and a knife edge aperture located at the lens are used to control exposure duration and intensity. The main advantage of this <b>sensitometer</b> is the production of an intensity scale without interposing a light absorbing step wedge. This permits graphic arts screens to be overlayed directly on the film simulating practical exposures. The unique ability of this <b>sensitometer</b> to provide complete 2 ̆ 2 system 2 ̆ 2 photographic response (density - vs – log exposure or percent dot - vs - log exposure) was demonstrated through the use of practical exposures.

40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Boston UniversityThe {{spectral}} sensitivity of five film types was measured over {{a region of}} 3380 to 6000 Angstroms. Curves of sensitivity vs wave length were produced for each film. The method of producing these curves was to expose the film to the continuous spectrum in the spectrograph, develope and make a microdensitometer trace {{in order to secure}} a density vs wave length curve. From this curve densities at various specified wave lengths were obtained. Using the Eastman IB <b>sensitometer</b> H and D curves were obtained throughout the wave length interval of interest. From these curves a difference in exposure, Δlog Hλ, is obtained: Δlog Hλ= log HD - log Hλ where log HD is the irradiance required to give a density of 1. 00 and Hλ the irradiance of the same wave length in the spectrograph. The spectral radiancy ratio Rλ/Rλmax obtained from the black body radiation curve for the source is corrected by the Δlog Hλ value log H = Δlog Hλ + log Rλ/Rλmax The {{spectral sensitivity}} S, is the reciprocal of H. A special spectrograph was designed and built for this work. It was designed to use a concave grating so that glass elements would not interfere with wave lengths below the 4000 Angstrom point. The film was scanned in a recording densitometer to give a trace of density vs wave length. The H and D curves for the various wave lengths of interest were obtained on an Eastman IB <b>sensitometer.</b> The Wratten 78 AA conversion filter was replaced by narrow band interference filters. The sensitometric strips made on the <b>sensitometer</b> were read on an Ansco-Macbeth densitometer.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundMammography is a {{radiological}} {{diagnostic method}} which relies on an X-ray examination of breasts {{and is a}} process involving the use of low-dose amplitude-X-rays (usually around 0. 7 mSv). Combining the use of small doses and high quality images requires extensive quality protocols, part of them being included in regulations adopted by the Minister of Health. AimThe {{aim of this study}} was to check the usefulness and efficacy of selected quality tests associated with mammography. Material/methodsThe study was performed in the mammography service of the Greater Poland Cancer Centre in Poznan. Following equipment was used: densitometer, <b>sensitometer,</b> mammographic scales, electronic scales, thermometer, hygrometer, PMMA plates, Europhantom, screen film contact phantom, viewing boxes and magnifying glasses. The methods were based on basic mammography tests. Quality control in mammography demands: clean darkroom, marked and clean cassettes, clean viewing boxes with homogenous light. ResultsThe results of the “Development Process” test show that each <b>sensitometer</b> has to be used with an appropriate densitometer. Phantoms with abnormal structures cannot be used to “AEC System – Solidity exposure” test. “Compression – The force of compression” test may only be carried out with suitable scales and compressible material. Analysis of rejected films shows that the main reasons for rejection were wrong collimation and underexposure. ConclusionEvery quality control in mammography provides essential information about the functioning of a laboratory.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} the relative effectiveness of improperly stored, preexposed sensitometric film in the evaluation of processing during a several month period of time, a comparison was made of medical x-ray film which was exposed with a light <b>sensitometer</b> and immediately processed (freshly exposed) and film that had been exposed with a light <b>sensitometer</b> at an earlier time (preexposed) and processed along with the freshly exposed film. The freshly exposed and preexposed films were further divided into a properly stored group, in our darkroom, and an environmentally stored group. The environmentally stored films were kept in a light-tight box in the trunk of a car during the months of August through October, 1983, and August through September, 1984. Each sample set of data included (1) properly stored and freshly exposed film, (2) properly stored and preexposed film, (3) environmentally stored and freshly exposed film; and (4) environmentally stored and preexposed film. A complete set of films was processed at specific times during the study. Initially the time interval for processing between two consecutive sample sets was measured in minutes, with this time interval increasing to hours, days, and weeks. The last sample set was processed 70 days after the study began. Density differences as large as 0. 70 between the freshly exposed and preexposed films were observed. A second trial was conducted in order to repeat some of our earlier observations. Two additional film types were incorporated into the second trial.

The sensitometric indices like base plus fog level (B + F), maximum optical density (ODmax), average gradient (AG) and speed of this film at varying development temperatures and times were evaluated using a light <b>sensitometer.</b> Totally 33 film strips were cut from a single Kodak MinR- 2000 mammography film box and exposed in a light <b>sensitometer</b> operated in the green light spectrum to produce a 21 -step sensitometric strip. These exposed film strips were processed at temperatures {{in the range of}} 32 °C– 37 °C in the step of 1 °C and at processing times in the range of 1 – 6 minutes in the step of 1 minute. The {{results of the present study}} show that the measured base plus fog level of the mammography film was not affected much, whereas significant changes were seen in the ODmax, AG and speed with varying development temperatures and times. The ODmax values of the film were found in the range of 3. 67 – 3. 76, AG values were in the range of 2. 48 – 3. 4 and speed values were in the range of 0. 015 – 0. 0236 when the processing temperature was varied from 32 °C to 37 °C. With processing time variation from 1 to 6 minutes, the observed changes in ODmax values were in the range of 3. 54 - 3. 71, changes in AG were in the range of 2. 66 – 3. 27 and changes in speed were in the range of 0. 011 – 0. 025.

40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Boston UniversityThe {{high speed}} of present day and future {{reconnaissance}} vehicles {{brings to the}} fore {{the problem of the}} effect of heat on the components of the reconnaissance system. This thesis presents an investigation of the effect of heat upon the photographic emulsion, considered by some the weakest link in the reconnaissance system in this regard. In addition, the effect of humidity on the photographic emulsion is studied. In order to provide a suitable system for carrying out the experimental work, a thermosensitometric test unit was designed and built. This test unit, coupled with a controlled heat electric oven, made it possible to heat emulsions for any duration of time at elevated temperatures and expose them at specified time intervals on the Eastman IB <b>Sensitometer.</b> The combination of this test unit and the Eastman IB <b>Sensitometer</b> made it possible to make careful determinations of sensitometric properties, in particular, gamma and speed. Two emulsions, Plus-X Aerecon and Eastman SO- 1213, were tested at temperatures up to 240 ° F. at very low humidity levels. Solutions of sulfuric acid were used for humidity control with temperatures up to 150 ° F. The results of this experiment showed that the speed of Plus-X Aerecon decreases almost linearly with increasing temperature. An increase in humidity caused a greater decrease in speed. On the other hand, SO- 1213 showed an increase in speed with higher temperatures and also a slight increase in speed with greater humidities. The use of sulfuric acid solutions for humidity control in open receptacles within the test unit may have been responsible for some questionable results. Other means for humidity control need to be considered. In summation, equipment and techniques are described by means of which the reaction of two aerial photographic emulsions to the heat environment of a reconnaissance system may be predicted...|$|E

Improvements made on the machine include the addition of an electromagnetic actuated shutter that is timed by an accurate integrated circuit timer that has the capability of six exposure times ranging from 1 / 100 sec. to 1 sec. This replaces a sector shutter that was motor driven and timed by a mechanical method.

40|$|Four desktop sensitometers of stereolithographic resins {{were created}} and tested against the {{characteristic}} curves of the resins produced under exposure conditions {{used with a}} Stereolithographic Apparatus.

It was concluded that the slopes of the characteristic curves can be determined by measuring the optical density of the resins. However, the slopes cannot be determined by measuring the percent conversion of the resins as a function of exposure. The critical exposures of the resins can be determined from the induction periods measured by the percent conversion sensitometers.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} method to {{calibrate}} surface photometry of faint sources measured from direct photographic plates, {{such as those of}} the NGS/POSS and ESO/SRC Sky Survey. This calibration procedure does not require scanning <b>sensitometer</b> spots on the plates, but instead uses measurements of the brightness profiles of many faint stars of known brightness to fit a linearized approximation to the characteristic curve. The approximation is valid for only low- to medium-density emulsions, so this technique is appropriate only for relatively faint emission. Comparison between measurements of representative extended sources on the NGS/POSS and CCD images indicates that surface photometry can be obtained from the Sky Survey plates accurate to 0. 1 - 0. 3 mag in the range mu(B) between 23 and 27 and mu(R) between 22 and 26 mag/sq arcsec...|$|E
