Ficou provado que, com cortes freqüentes e severos, o ciclo de vida das plantas fica bastante prolongado, ao mesmo tempo que a produção de fibras por unidade de área decai sensivelmente, em conseqüência da redução de tamanho das fôlhas e menor conteúdo de fibras nas fôlhas das plantas submetidas a êsse sistema de corte. Os exames de laboratório demonstraram que, enquanto as características químicas das fibras não eram afetadas pelos sistemas de corte estudados, as características físicas eram, pelo contrário, sensivelmente afetados pelo corte freqüente e severo. This paper {{describes}} {{the results obtained}} with the <b>sisal</b> <b>plant</b> (Agave sisalana Perrine) in a cutting trial located in the "Estação Experimental Central do Instituto Agronômico", at Campinas. This trial was designed to compare the effects of four cutting cycles, combined with three levels of severity of cutting, upon growth, longevity, and yield of the <b>sisal</b> <b>plant,</b> and {{on the quality of}} its fiber. The experiment was laid out in 4 randomized blocks of 4 plots, each plot having 3 sub-plots. Sub-plot size was of twelve plants spaced 2. 5 x 1. 5 m and arranged in two rows of 6 plants each. The results can be summarized as follows : (a) The life cycle of the <b>sisal</b> <b>plant</b> was greatly influenced by the cutting method used. The greater the frequency and severity of cutting the slower was the growth of the plant and the longer it took to pole. (b) Light cutting at six to twelve-month cycles was conducive to early poling, and the plant yielded fewer, though heavier, leaves. (c) Heavy cutting at a three-month cycle reduced plant size considerably and induced the formation of short leaves containing less fiber weight per leaf. There was. therefore, a significant decrease in total fiber yield per area. (d) The final fiber yields indicated that a light cutting (30 %) at three or six-month intervals gave higher yields per area {{than any of the other}} treatments. Life cycle was slightly prolonged by this treatment and significantly more leaves were produced per plant without adverse effects upon leaf weight and actual fiber content. (e) Fiber analysis showed that its chemical characteristics were not affected by the treatments, even by heavy and frequent cuttings. Heavy cuttings, especially at a three [...] month cycle, had a marked effect on the physical fiber characteristics...|$|E

Sisal is severely affected by Aspergillus niger Thieg, the causal agent of sisal red rot. Currently, existing control strategies are fruitless. Here, we tested different homeopathic drugs Carbo vegetabilis, Ferrum metallicum, Natrum muriaticum, phosphorus and sulphur at centesimal Hahnemannian (CH) dynamizations, of 3 CH, 5 CH, 7 CH, 9 CH and 12 CH, on Aspergillus niger. We measured in vitro growth inhibition, sporulation and germination of Aspergillus niger during 12  days. We assessed in planta Aspergillus niger incidence and disease severity. Our results show that homeopathic drugs inhibited Aspergillus niger growth in vitro, in a dynamization-dependent way. Natrum muriaticum 5 CH revealed the higher inhibition of 66  %, whereas sulphur 5 CH yielded the lowest inhibition of 6. 4  %. Spore production was stimulated using all homeopathic drugs at all dynamization levels, whereas spore germination was reduced. In planta assays revealed different results from in vitro assays, corroborating that in planta and in vitro effectiveness is different according to the homeopathic drugs applied.
