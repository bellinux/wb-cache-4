A Sizable landslide accured in this region in december, 1962. During august 1977, a major landslide came roaring down the main nala (a local term used for small channels or stream) of Khela village and destroyed sheds and houses, killing 44 persons and 76 heads of cattle. About 150 acres of standing crops were washed out. Geological and geomorphological investigataion showed that a large area was dislocated {{at the head of the}} nala moving down the gradient and activating the boulder filled nala. The mass of the mountain scree that moved was perhaps resting already at a critical angle and the torrential rains had triggered the flow.

Because of potential {{side effects of}} these drugs and the possible development of drug resistance, finding a cure for HIV infection remains a high priority of HIV/AIDS research. We recently generated a recombinase (termed Tre) tailored to efficiently eradicate the provirus from the host genome of HIV- 1 infected cells by specifically targeting a sequence that {{is present in the}} long terminal repeats (LTRs) of the viral DNA [1]. In vivo analyses in HIV-infected humanized mice demonstrated highly significant antiviral effects of Tre recombinase [2]. However, the fact that Tre recognizes a particular HIV- 1 subtype A strain may limit its broad therapeutic application. To advance our Tre-based strategy towards a universally efficient cure, we have engineered a new, universal recombinase (uTre) applicable to the majority of HIV- 1 infections by the various virus strains and subtypes. We employed the search tool SeLOX [3] in order to find a well-conserved HIV- 1 proviral sequence that could serve as target site for a universal Tre from sequences compiled in the Los Alamos HIV Sequence Database.

40|$|A {{non-linear}} {{numerical model}} is {{developed for the}} computation of water level and discharge for the propagation of a unidirectional two-layered tsunami wave. Four governing equations, two for each layer, are derived from Euler’s equations of motion and continuity, assuming a long wave approximation, negligible friction and no interfacial mixing. A numerical model is developed using a staggered Leap-Frog scheme. The developed non- linear model is compared with an existing validated linear model developed earlier by the author for different non-dimensional wave amplitudes. The significance of non-linear terms is discussed. It is found that for simulations of the interface wave amplitude, the effect of non-linear terms is not significant. However, for the simulation of the top surface, the effect of non-linear terms is significant for higher wave amplitudes, and insignificant for lower wave amplitudes. Developed non-linear numerical model {{is used for the}} case of a progressive internal wave in an inclined bay. It is found that the effect of an adverse bottom <b>slipe</b> towards the direction of wave propagation is to amplify the wave. This amplification depends on the steepness of slope as well as the ratio of densities of upper layer fluid to lower layer fluid (α). Amplification increases with slope. For higher values of α, amplification of the top and interface surface decreases, which is reasonable. It is also found that even for a 4 percent density difference between upper layer and lower layer, amplification of the top surface will be twenty times higher than amplification in the non-stratified case. The model can be applied confidently to simulate the basic features of different practical problems, similar to those investigated in this study...|$|R

During field prospection and contact with local population, few possible pollution sources were located. There was a strong possibility that the oil traces in the cave are the result of the railway accident in 1970. Because of the railway accident on Rijeka-Zagreb railroad, tank carriage <b>sliped</b> off from the tracks and the content of the dangerous cargo leaked onto the nearby valley, 800 meters away from the cave entrance. A spring, used sometimes for water supply by the local population is also located nearby. Sampling of the water from the cave and the spring was carried out several times during the next period with the intention of monitoring the pollution impact on water quality in different seasonal (climatic) conditions.

40|$|EN] This paper {{deals with}} the relief {{generation}} in Ourense, an interior territory of the Galicia Country, at NW Spain, after the breakdown of Pangea 200 million years ago. The rupture of supercontinent causes the main effects in the outer part of Galicia, the present coast line and the shelf, but also the inner parts of Galicia where the landscape changes dramatically mainly ruled by fluvial incision connected with uprising, (orogenic, epirogenic, or isostatic origin), or even with eustatic oscillations, that shaped the previous old mesozoic landscape. Various things complicate the correct understanding of Galician geomorphology: 1) the prevalent hercynian structure, (presumably reactivated during the Alpine Orogeny), causes that the epigenic processes, (fluvial, glaciar, marine and etching), acting on Galicia from Mesozoic to present times, produce end forms identified erroneously at the previous literature as tectonic and not as etch forms profiting from lithological or structural contrasts. 2) the common morphotectonic model accepted by all previous researchers establishes {{for the whole of}} Galicia a blocky pattern, (horst and graben like), due to extensional tectonic regime. This model is proved as no longer valid because the Galician tertiary basins, even were described at the past as graben depressions never have this origin. 3) big differences exist between the north and western sides of Galicia that show contrasted tectonic regime: compressional (with forms as the so called raised platforms), at the northern coast border, and extensional (with forms so typical as the Rias), at the western side. The study area is located at the confluence of two tectonic domains where the above mentioned effects are coincidents and specially well showed through different effects: prominent assimetry of fluvial captures (west facing), pronounced river incision and different kinds of tertiary basins: either strike <b>slipe</b> faults (Maceda, Xinzo de Limia, etc), or overslipped by inverse faults, (Quiroga, A Rúa, etc.), or even corresponding with depressions never, (or anywise passively), affected by tectonic movements, (Monforte).

40|$|The major {{purpose of}} this thesis is to adjust {{sampling}} locations in two rail-geometry datasets obtained by track-inspection cars. A special rolling stock called a track-inspection car periodically measures rail geometry in order to monitor rail geometry. This is because the railway track {{plays an important role}} in ensuring running safety of the trains and riding comfort of the passengers. Thus, railway companies must maintain the quality of their tracks against wear, tear, and so forth caused by the loads of the passing trains. 　A track-inspection car continuously measures various aspects of rail geometry while running on the rails. These geometric measurements are simultaneously discretized at fixed spatial intervals, and are recorded as digital datasets. The set of their discretized locations on the rail changes slightly with each measurement although it is desirable that these locations be fixed in order to observe variations in rail geometry. This location gaps are based on the fact that the wheel-rotation pulse that is used to select the discretized locations is linked to the rotation of the car wheel. Thus, identical spatial discretization cannot be reproduced. Moreover, it is difficult to adjust these location gaps after the discretization. If the spatial intervals(called sampling intervals) between the discretized locations stay constant in two measuring runs, these gaps could be easily adjusted by calculating the correlation coefficient distance between the two datasets, even if the locations themselves change. In reality, however, some sampling intervals shorten or lengthen locally due to slipping or sliding of the car wheel, respectively. In addition, the length and location of these locally irregular intervals cannot be detected unfortunately. This makes it difficult to adjust the location gaps. 　In this thesis a procedure is proposed to adjust the sampling locations in one spatially discretized dataset to the sampling locations in another when the differences between these sets are mainly caused by the sampling intervals that locally lengthen and shorten. This adjustment is formulated as an optimization problem that can be efficiently solved by dynamic programming. This formulation contains a few hyperparameters which are usually tuned by manual. Here these hyperparameters are identified automatically by using the Bayesian framework. 　The developed procedure is described in more detail as follows. First, the adjustment problem is formulated as an alignment problem between the reference dataset and the misregistered dataset. Then the alignment problem is reformulated as an optimization problem which can be solved efficiently with dynamic programming. 　Then, a Bayesian framework is introduced to determine the hyperparameters automatically. This idea is based on the observation that the optimal solution in dinamic programming is interpreted as the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate in a certain Bayesian model with the specific values of the hyperperparameters. With this framework, the hyperparameters are estimated with the maximum likelihood procedure for the associated Bayes model by employing the non-linear filtering procedure for a generalized state-space model. 　This approach appears to work reasonably well in detecting <b>sliping</b> and sliding of the wheels in view of the MAP estimate. But by taking a closer look, it turned out that the procedure gives unsatisfactory results in view of the smoothing (predictive) distribution of the adjusted data points. 　In order to resolve this problem, a refined Bayesian model is introduced. The hyperparameters in this model are classified into two categories: the one representing the state of the wheel rotation, and the other representing the noise from the measuring device which is formulated as AR model. When all parameters are simultaneously estimated with the maximum likelihood procedure, the results indicated that too many slippng or sliding occurred in the misregistered dataset than expected. To overcome this difficulty, a procedure is developed that estimates the noise parameters directly from the difference sequence between the reference and the roughly adjusted sets. This procedure alternatively identifies the wheel rotation and the noise parameters until the internal inconsistency incurred in the model is eliminated. Plausibility of the smoothing distribution of the adjusted data points obtained with this procedure is demonstrated through application to real datasets...|$|R

Occupational {{accidents}} and diseases {{are the most}} serious health problem for employees nowadays. Thousands of people die or disable every year due to occupational accidents. In addition, serious labour force and economic losses happens. Occupational Safety is very important issue to prevent these loses. Occupational {{accidents and}} diseases are more vital especially for countries which {{do not have enough}} hospitals and health workers as doctors and nurses. Everyday, tens of people visit hospitals due to simple or serious occupational accidents and diseases. Most of issues as injury, cancer, herniated disc and other health problems that requires physical terapy caused due to unsafe and unhealthy working conditions. As a matter of fact, many hospitals can not be able to supply enough health service under this patient traffic. As a result of this, quality of treatment and service to the patients decreseas. In addition, countries economy and companies could be under serious economic weight. Aside delays on work schedule, losing of qualified workers is a really economic problem. Also, after an occupational accident, working performance of other workers decreases spontaneously. Geomatics Engineering is very important not only for map production, but also for almost all Engineering works. There are many academic studies on occupational safety for construction, mining and naval architecturing sectors in literature. However, there is no sufficient academic studies found (in Literature search) for Geomatics Engineering which has a critical duty for all these sectors and also which has different types of occupational accidents. Based on this deficiency, occupational accidents, dangers and risks for Geomatics Engineers and their co-workers (survey team) are investigated in this thesis study. The study consists of three chapters. In introduction chapter, in general, the aim and contents of the study are indicated. Terms as employee, employer, deputy employer, insurant, working place, incident, accident, occupational accident, occupational disease, temporaray incapability of working, permanent incapability of working, occupational safety which are about the topic are explained. Then, importance of occupational safety is mentioned. Under the topic of importance of occupational safety, reasons of occupational accidents and costs of occupational accidents is provided. After that, historical process of occupational safety is mentioned. First attempts on occupational safety and developments in this topic both in the world and Turkey are explained. The activities of International Labour Organization (ILO) is also mentioned. Judicial procedure in Turkey is investigated for {{a better understanding of the}} topic. Effectuation dates of Occupational Safety and Health Code (in Turkey) which is published at 20. 06. 2012 are listed. The other laws (Labor Code, Obligations Code, Social Insurances and General Health Code, Turkish Criminal Code) which contain occupational safety matters are also mentioned. Regularities for complying to European Union explained and information about occupational health and safety management systems are given. OHSAS 18001 (Occupational Health and Safety Assesment Series) is introduced. Components of a succesful management system as generel essentials, occupational safety policy, planning, application and running, control and corrective activities, revising of administration are summarized. In the second chapter, definition of risk is given and general risk factors are indicated. These factors are specified as; based on physical work area, based on workers behaviors, based on organizing types of work, based on management systems. Risk assessment in Turkish laws is indicated. Risk management on occupational safety and health is explained. Also, benefits of risk management and risk management process are explained and illustrated on table. Risk management process are explained under 7 stages. These are; “determining of dangers”, “risk analyzing”, “assesment of risks”, “determining of control precautions”, “execution of control precautions”, “monitoring and revision”, “communication and solidatory”. In chapter three, occupational safety in Geomatics Engineering is investigated in two main topics as Field Works and Office Works. On Field Works, it is stated that tehere can be many differnet types of risks and dangers can be faced by survey team. However, there are some risks and dangers which were already faced by survey teams before. To generalize and summarize these, some main risks and dangers as “falling down-sliping-descending”, “stone-rock-land sliping”, “dust infection to eyes”, “nail-thorn pricking”, “electricity-lightning pound”, “explosion and burning”, “botulism”, “animal attacks”, “getting lost”, “sun stroke”, “freezing or burning due to weather conditions”, “radiation”, “cronical joints aches”, “people threats-attacks” are indicated. There are many geomatics engineers who work in engineering projects. Most of these projects are construction projects. To analyze risks and dangers more accurately, these projects are classified as “superstructure works”, “infrastructure works” and “transportation works”. Some statistical data about occupational accidents and deaths in building constructions, channel constructions and highway constructions are showed in tables. Furthermore, mining measurements and hydrographic measurements also investigated as uniqe works in Geomatics Engineering. Mostly observed occupational accidents in superstructure works (buildings, shopping centers, skyscrappers, public buildings, hotels, airports etc.) are shown as “falling down of workers due to the height of structure”, “material falling”, “material spattering (nail etc.) ”. Mechanical construction devices are also stated as another serious risk factor for survey team in these works. Some superstructure projects such as airport projects are worked as skift (7 days 24 hours). In these works, to make measurement under darkness is also indicated as increasing factor of all risks and dangers for survey team. It is indicated that in infrastructure works such as “channel construction”, “power plants (electricity, natural gas) ”, “sewage construction”, the most frequently faced occupational accident is “falling and <b>sliping</b> of edge of excavation area”. “Sliping of stone and earth” is also specified as the other dangereous and often faced risk for survey team. Also some wrong and correct infrastructure works are illustrated with pictures. Transportation works (motorways, bridges, viaducts, underpasses, overpasses, tunnels, railways etc.) are defined as the most exhaustive works for Geomatics Engineers due to long distance of routes and different types of works. In transportation works there are different types of construction teams (earthwork, structures, drainage, paving, finishing) which work in same area simultaneously. As a result of this tempo, many different occupational accidents happens. According to statistics the most observed occupational accident is based on mechanical construction devices. This problem examplified especially for device operators carelessness while working. Because of their concentration, they can forget survey team who makes measurements in same area. As a result of this, many occupational accidents can be faced. Traffic accidents in construction area are also indicated as other most frequently faced accidents in transportation works. Traffic is also stated as the most important risk for survey team who makes “Deformation Measurements (Settlement Readings) ” of structures which requires serious concantration. Spattering of materials as nails also considered among remarkable risks for survey team. In tunnel works, beside ordinary risks for all workers some uniqe risks and accidents also mentioned. Mining measurements are one of the most dangerous works for Geomatics Engineers and survey team. Mining measurements are investigated as “open mines (overground) ” and “closed mines (underground) ”. Working in open mines contains risks and dangers similar to infrastructure works and excavation works. Working in closed mines has risks and dangers similar to tunnel works. The most dangerous accident is stated as earth collapsing in these mines. Psychological factors of working underground without sufficient air and illumination are also indicated as other risks for survey team. Harmful gases and dust density can be assumed as plus risks for both open and closed mines. Occupational safety in hydrographic measurements is investigated in two sub-topics as “bathymetry” and “diving”. Electrical shock and boat accidents are mentioned as risks for bathymetry stage while suffocating is stated as main risk in diving stage due to different reasons. Finally, importance of Ergonomics is emphasized for Office Works and requirements of ergonomic designed working is explained and also illustrated with figures. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|R
