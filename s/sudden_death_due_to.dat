Due {{to the emotional}} reverberations of the shooting crisis, Owen and Cristina decide to wed one another shortly after their reconciliation, not wanting to risk separation. When Cristina discovers she is pregnant, Owen is displeased with her desire to abort the baby, and the two separate from each other. In the fallout of resident Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo)'s tampering with Derek Shepherd's Alzheimer's trial, Owen is promoted to Chief of Surgery after Webber steps down. After substantial thought, Owen reluctantly decides to accompany Cristina to the abortion, uniting the two. Owen's friendship with Teddy ends when Owen lies to Teddy about her husband's <b>sudden</b> <b>death,</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> Owen wanting her to finish a surgery she was currently performing and Teddy blaming Owen for her husband's death. Feeling abandoned and disconcerted after an altercation with Cristina, Owen has a one-night stand with a patient's friend. Cristina consequently finds out, terminates their relationship, and their marriage is tested. After Cristina passed her medical boards, she reconciles with Owen, but reveals to him that she is leaving Seattle to go to Mayo Clinic. Teddy and Owen eventually became friends again. She had been offered a position at the United States Army Medical Command but chose to stay at Seattle Grace Mercy West out of loyalty.

40|$|Reasons of {{development}} of life-threatening arrhythmias {{that lead to}} <b>sudden</b> and total <b>death</b> in cases of cardiovascular diseases are still unclear, though cardiac research of this problem is conducted throughout the world. Damage of connective tissues insulation cover of the heart’s conductive pathways with oxidation of ectopic nodes can lead to life-threatening arrhythmias. This damage has never been considered before {{as a cause of}} electrical instability of the heart. Accordingly, treatment of such patients should change, and consequently should reduce the total number of <b>sudden</b> <b>deaths</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> cardiovascular diseases. The speed of electricity conduction from the heart to the nervous system and its distribution throughout the body remains underestimated. Slowdown of electric magnetic induction (acceleration) between the heart and the central nervous system as well as slowdown of its distribution results in insufficient speed of electric flow and reduction of bioelectric processes of the body. This leads to activation of the sympathetic nervous system with the subsequent cascade of pressor mechanisms and development of essential hypertension...|$|R
