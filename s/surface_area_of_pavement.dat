40|$|Permeable {{pavements}} play {{an essential}} role in urban drainage systems, making them the subject of great interest to both researchers and practitioners. However, previous studies have demonstrated a significant degree of uncertainty regarding both the hydrological performance and the maintenance requirements of this type <b>of</b> <b>pavement.</b> Within this context, a one metre square <b>surface</b> <b>area</b> <b>of</b> permeable <b>pavement</b> and a laboratory rainfall simulator were constructed to investigate the influence of rainfall intensity on the hydrologic response <b>of</b> permeable <b>pavements.</b> The hydrological performance <b>of</b> permeable <b>pavement</b> was tested under clean laboratory conditions and under the influence of sedimentation. The design <b>of</b> the permeable <b>pavement</b> test rig complied with the SuDS manual guidance and British Standards (BS 7533 - 13 : 2009). Simulated rainfall event results demonstrate that the hydrologic performance <b>of</b> the <b>pavement</b> varied according to the rainfall intensity and duration. More than 40 % of the total rainfall from all rain events was temporarily detained within the structure. The total volume of discharge from the permeable pavement ranged from 8 % to 60 % of the inflow, illustrating the storage capacity <b>of</b> the <b>pavement.</b> The results <b>of</b> the simulation showed that the outflow reduction due to the application of sediment was 6. 4 % within the first ten years. The reduction in outflow volume was a result of the increasing water content within the pavement structure over time. The impact of sediment addition on the pavement surface was evident in the third year of the simulation. The concentration of suspended solids in the outflow showed a slight variation following the addition of the sediment, but remained low. Further analysis showed the outflow duration increased over time and no temporary ponding occurred on the surface during the ten-year simulation...|$|R
40|$|Variations in {{erosion and}} {{deposition}} {{for the last}} fifty years (based on estimates from 137 Cs profiles) on surfaces (Late Pleistocene to Late Holocene in age) making up the Fortymile Wash alluvial fan south of Yucca Mountain, is a function of surface age and <b>of</b> desert <b>pavement</b> development or absence. For purposes of comparing erosion and deposition, the surfaces can be examined as three groups: (1) Late Pleistocene <b>surfaces</b> possess <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> desert <b>pavement</b> development with thin Av or sandy A horizons, formed by the trapping capabilities <b>of</b> the <b>pavements.</b> These zones <b>of</b> deposition are complemented by coppice dune formation on similar parts <b>of</b> the <b>surface.</b> <b>Areas</b> on the <b>surface</b> where no pavement development has occurred are erosional in nature with 0. 0 +/- 0. 0 cm to 1. 5 +/- 0. 5 cm of erosion occurring primarily by winds blowing across the surface. Overall these surfaces may show either a small net depositional gain or small erosional loss. (2) Early Holocene surfaces have no well-developed desert pavements, but may have residual gravel deposits in small <b>areas</b> on the <b>surfaces.</b> These surfaces show the most consistent erosional <b>surface</b> <b>areas</b> on which it ranges from 1. 0 +/-. 01 cm to 2. 0 +/-. 01 cm. Fewer depositional forms are found on this age of surface so there is probably a net loss of 1. 5 cm across these surfaces. (3) The Late Holocene surfaces show the greatest variability in erosion and deposition. Overbank deposition during floods cover many edges of these surfaces and coppice dune formation also creates depositional features. Erosion rates are highly variable and range from 0. 0 +/- 0. 0 to a maximum of 2. 0 +/-. 01. Erosion occurs {{because of the lack of}} protection of the surface. However, the common <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> deposition probably result in the surface having a small net depositional gain across these surfaces. Thus, the interchannel surfaces of the Fortymile Wash fan show a variety of erosional styles as well as <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> deposition. The fan, therefore, is a dynamic system that primarily responds to the incising of the channels into the upper fan surface, and the development <b>of</b> protecting desert <b>pavements</b> with time...|$|R
