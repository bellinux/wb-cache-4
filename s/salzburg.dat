5|$|Conrad {{seems to}} have been {{involved}} when Henry V revolted against his father in 1105. This would explain his election as Archbishop of <b>Salzburg</b> at the Diet of Mainz on 7 January 1106. At that time the anti-Archbishop Berthold von Moosburg was installed in <b>Salzburg.</b> Conrad came to <b>Salzburg</b> accompanied by his brothers, the counts Otto and Wolfram, with an escort of 1,000 soldiers. Some of these soldiers may well have been servitors, servile rather than free vassals. With this display of force, he was able to force Berthold to abdicate. Pope Paschal II consecrated him as bishop on 21 October 1106 and gave him the pallium.|$|E

5|$|North of the line, {{the highway}} follows West Side Saginaw Road through fields {{in a less}} {{urbanized}} area. West of University Center and the campus of Delta College, M-84 crosses over I-75/US23 at exit160 and proceeds through several curves into Bay City. At the intersection with Euclid Avenue on the city line, M-13 merges in {{from the north and}} the two highways run concurrently along <b>Salzburg</b> Avenue. Since this segment of highway is both northbound M-84 and southbound M-13 along eastbound <b>Salzburg</b> Avenue, the two trunklines form a wrong-way concurrency.|$|E

Among those inspired by Toscanini's performances were Herbert von Karajan and Georg Solti, who were among his répétiteurs at <b>Salzburg.</b> Toscanini's younger colleague Tullio Serafin continued to present the work in Germany and Austria after Toscanini refused to perform there because of his loathing of the Nazi regime.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to further}} {{conflicts}} with imperial officials, Conrad had to flee in 1112 {{and was not}} able to return to <b>Salzburg</b> until 1121. While in exile, he lived in Tuscany, Admont in Styria, and Saxony.|$|E

5|$|Wolfgang was {{qualified}} by {{his skills}} {{at the keyboard}} and violin, and by his compositional experience, for a post as Kapellmeister; but at 17 he was too young. He therefore remained in Colloredo's employ at the <b>Salzburg</b> court, increasingly discontent, until his dismissal from the Archbishop's retinue during its stay in Vienna, in 1781.
