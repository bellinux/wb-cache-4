Polyglutamylated folate forms are produced by the enzyme folylpolyglutamate synthetase (FPGS). The FPGS enzyme is encoded by two genes in rice, Os 03 g 02030 and Os 10 g 35940. Os 03 g 02030 represents the major expressed form in developing seed. To determine the function of this FPGS gene in rice, a T-DNA knockout line was characterised.

This bifunctional enzyme controls the first two steps of Lys catabolism. The phenotype of the LKR/SDH knockout was indistinguishable from wild-type plants under normal growth conditions, suggesting that Lys catabolism is not an essential pathway under standard growth conditions.

25|$|Even {{a return}} to RFK Stadium {{was not enough to}} cure {{whatever}} had been ailing United over the last 2 or 3 months of league play. United fell behind 2–0 against Columbus, but an attempt at a late rally came up short. A penalty kick by Rolfe put United on the scoreboard. Later, Saborio appeared to have tied the score in the 84th minute, off a through pass by Pontius, but the Costa Rican was controversially ruled offside. The result vaulted the Crew {{to the top of the}} standings in the Eastern Conference, while United slipped to 4th place. With dreams of MLS hardware slipping away, D.C. United still had top position in CONCACAF Champions League group play, which the team locked down in their final group match of 2015, a 3–3 draw in Jamaica, against Montego Bay United. The Jamaican side jumped out to an early lead when a quick restart caught out a really makeshift D.C. defense, that included Aguilar making his first start as a fullback, and Jalen Robinson making his first start as a center back. That goal was Montego Bay's first ever tally in CCL play. The home side extended the lead 3 minutes later and took what appeared to be a commanding 3-0 lead early in the second half on a penalty kick, after a phantom foul call against midfielder Jared Jeffrey. D.C. however rallied, with goals by Arrieta and Opare, and earned a draw and a point, when Michael Farfan collected a loose ball deep into stoppage time and aimed his shot into the top corner of the goal.

40|$|In vertebrates, the endocannabinoid {{signaling}} pathway is an important lipid regulatory pathway that modulates a variety of physiological and behavioral processes. N-Acylethanolamines (NAEs) comprise a group of fatty acid derivatives that function within this pathway, and their signaling activity is terminated by an enzyme called fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), which hydrolyzes NAEs to ethanolamine and their corresponding free fatty acids. Bioinformatic approaches led to the identification of plant homologues of FAAH {{that are capable of}} hydrolyzing NAEs in vitro. To better understand the role of NAEs in plants, we identified T-DNA knockouts to Arabidopsis FAAH (AtFAAH; At 5 g 64440) and generated plants overexpressing AtFAAH. Here we show that <b>seeds</b> of AtFAAH <b>knockouts</b> had elevated levels of endogenous NAEs, and seedling growth was hypersensitive to exogenously applied NAE. On the other hand, seeds and seedlings of AtFAAH overexpressors had lower endogenous NAE content, and seedlings were less sensitive to exogenous NAE. Moreover, AtFAAH overexpressors displayed enhanced seedling growth and increased cell size. AtFAAH expression and FAAH catalytic activity increased during seed germination and seedling growth, consistent with the timing of NAE depletion during seedling establishment. Collectively, our results show that AtFAAH is one, but not the only, modulator of endogenous NAE levels in plants, and that NAE depletion likely participates in the regulation of plant growth...|$|R
40|$|There {{is growing}} {{evidence}} that Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms exhibit a multicellular developmental life cycle analogous {{to that of}} the myxobacteria. In non-mucoid PAO 1 biofilms cultured in glass flow cells the phenotypic differentiation of microcolonies into a motile phenotype in the interior of the microcolony and a non-motile surrounding 'wall phenotype' are described. After differentiation the interior cells coordinately evacuated the microcolony from local break out points and spread over the wall of the flow cell, suggesting that the specialized microcolonies were analogous to crude fruiting bodies. A microcolony diameter of approximately 80 microm was required for differentiation, suggesting that regulation was related to cell density and mass transfer conditions. This phenomenon was termed 'seeding dispersal' to differentiate it from 'erosion' which is the passive removal of single cells by fluid shear. Using the flow cell culturing method, in which reproducible seeding phenotype in PAO 1 wild-type was demonstrated, the effects of quorum sensing (QS) and rhamnolipid production (factors previously identified as important in determining biofilm structure) on <b>seeding</b> dispersal using <b>knockout</b> mutants isogenic with PAO 1 was investigated.

40|$|Raffinose synthase 5 (AtRS 5, At 5 g 40390) was {{characterized}} from Arabidopsis as a recombinant enzyme. It has a far higher {{affinity for the}} substrates galactinol and sucrose than any other raffinose synthase previously reported. In addition raffinose synthase 5 is also working as a galactosylhydrolase, degrading galactinol and raffinose under certain conditions. Together with raffinose synthase 4, which is predominantly a stachyose synthase, both enzymes contribute to the raffinose family oligosaccharide (RFO) accumulation in <b>seeds.</b> A double <b>knockout</b> in raffinose synthase 4 and raffinose synthase 5 (ΔAtRS 4, 5) was generated, which is devoid of RFOs in seeds. Unstressed leaves of 4 week old ΔAtRS 4, 5 plants showed drastically 23. 8 -fold increased concentrations of galactinol. Unexpectedly, raffinose appeared again in drought stressed ΔAtRS 4, 5 plants, but not under other abiotic stress conditions. Drought stress leads to novel transcripts of raffinose synthase 6 suggesting that this isoform is a further stress inducible raffinose synthase in Arabidopsis. ΔAtRS 4, 5 seeds showed a 5 days delayed germination phenotype in darkness and an elevated expression of the transcription factor phytochrome interacting factor 1 (AtPIF 1) target gene AtPIF 6, being a repressor of germination.

40|$|Starch {{biosynthesis}} {{is important}} for plant development and is {{a critical factor in}} crop quality and nutrition. As a complex metabolic pathway, the regulation of starch biosynthesis is still poorly understood. We here present the identification of candidate regulators for starch biosynthesis by gene coexpression analysis in rice (Oryza sativa). Starch synthesis genes can be grouped into type I (in seeds; sink tissues) and type II (in vegetative tissues; source tissues), and 307 and 621 coexpressed genes are putatively involved in the regulation of starch biosynthesis in rice seeds and vegetative tissues, respectively. Among these genes, Rice Starch Regulator 1 (RSR 1), an APETALA 2 /ethylene-responsive element binding protein family transcription factor, was found to negatively regulate the expression of type I starch synthesis genes, and RSR 1 deficiency results in the enhanced expression of starch synthesis genes in seeds. <b>Seeds</b> of the <b>knockout</b> mutant rsr 1 consistently show the increased amylose content and altered fine structure of amylopectin and consequently form the round and loosely packed starch granules, resulting in decreased gelatinization temperature. In addition, rsr 1 mutants have a larger seed size and increased seed mass and yield. In contrast, RSR 1 overexpression suppresses the expression of starch synthesis genes, resulting in altered amylopectin structure and increased gelatinization temperature. Interestingly, a decreased proportion of A chains in rsr 1 results in abnormal starch granules but reduced gelatinization temperature, whereas an increased proportion of A chains in RSR 1 -overexpressing plants leads to higher gelatinization temperatures, which is novel and different from previous reports, further indicating the complicated regulation of starch synthesis and determination of the physicochemical properties of starch. These results demonstrate the potential of coexpression analysis for studying rice starch biosynthesis and the regulation of a complex metabolic pathway and provide informative clues, including the characterization of RSR 1, to facilitate the improvement of rice quality and nutrition...|$|R
30|$|We also {{knocked out}} MKKK 62 in ZH 11 by gene editing {{technology}} and obtained three independent lines (Additional file 6 : Table S 1). However, the germination efficiency (percentage of germinating <b>seeds)</b> of the <b>knockout</b> lines was not obviously decreased (Additional file 7 : Figure S 6). Our {{explanation for this}} result is as follows: In Arabidopsis, at least five MKKKs (AtMKKK 14 / 15 / 16 / 17 / 18) are able to activate AtMKK 3 (Choi et al. 2017; Matsuoka et al. 2015). In rice, {{there are at least}} eight genes showing strong similarity to MKKK 62 (Rao et al. 2010), and six of them are transcribed in seeds (Sato et al. 2013). We speculated that these six genes can functionally complement the mutation of MKKK 62. AtMKKK 14 / 15 / 16 / 17 / 18 in Arabidopsis also belong to the MEKK subfamily. According to the phylogenetic tree, their predicted amino acid sequences show strong similarity to that of MKKK 62 (Rao et al. 2010). However, there were no significant changes in the seed dormancy of Arabidopsis overexpressing AtMKKK 14 / 15 / 16 / 17 / 18 (Choi et al. 2017; Matsuoka et al. 2015). In Arabidopsis, ABA was shown to positively regulate the expression of AtMKKK 18 and promote the phosphorylation of the downstream proteins, AtMAPK 1 / 2 / 7 / 14 (Danquah et al. 2015; Leonhardt et al. 2004). Overexpression of AtMKKK 18 led to accelerated leaf senescence, a phenotype usually induced by ABA (Matsuoka et al. 2015). Seed dormancy is usually promoted by ABA (Jin et al. 2018). Since AtMKKK 18 has been shown to positively regulate the ABA signal (de Zelicourt et al. 2016), it has been speculated that AtMKKK 18 also positively regulates seed dormancy. The {{results of the present study}} showed that rice seed dormancy is negatively regulated by MKKK 62. This result suggests that the regulatory mechanisms of seed dormancy differ between Arabidopsis thaliana and rice.|$|R
