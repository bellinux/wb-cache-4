5|$|In 2010, {{the health}} of the Dry Island Albertosaurus {{assembly}} was reported upon. Most specimens showed no <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>disease.</b> On three phalanges of the foot strange bony spurs, consisting of abnormal ossifications of the tendons, so-called enthesophytes, were present, their cause unknown. Two ribs and a belly-rib showed signs of breaking and healing. One adult specimen had a left lower jaw showing a puncture wound and both healed and unhealed bite marks. The low number of abnormalities compares favourably with the health condition of a Majungasaurus population of which it in 2007 was established that 19% of individuals showed bone pathologies.|$|E
2500|$|Some ranchers have {{disputed the}} more scientifically {{mainstream}} [...] "natural causes hypothesis" [...] {{on the grounds}} that the mutilated animals often fall outside of the normal categories of natural deaths by predation or disease. One reason cited is that the animals were healthy and showed no <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>disease</b> prior to death, and were large and strong enough not to be a likely target for a predator. In some cases, ranchers have reported that the mutilated cattle were among the healthiest and strongest animals in their herd.|$|E
2500|$|The pair {{review the}} ship's logs from the non-hibernating flight crew. The Vardy were {{programmed}} to help construct and operate the colony {{and make the}} colonists happy, monitoring the emotional state of the colonists through the emotion badges and avatars. When one of the flight crew died naturally, it created grief amongst the crew that the avatars were not programmed to register. The Vardy took this as a <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>disease,</b> and killed those who displayed unhappiness. This created a [...] "grief tsunami" [...] which rapidly wiped out the flight crew, and will likely wipe out the waking colonists when they discover what happened.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{have not}} {{examined}} it yet," [...] I answered, and {{then and there}} proceeded to loose the band. Just over the external jugular vein there were two punctures, not large, but not wholesome looking. There was no <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>disease,</b> but the edges were white and worn looking, as if by some trituration. It at once {{occurred to me that}} that this wound, or whatever it was, might be the means of that manifest loss of blood. But I abandoned the idea as soon as it formed, for such a thing could not be. The whole bed would have been drenched to a scarlet with the blood which the girl must have lost to leave such a pallor as she had before the transfusion.|$|E
60|$|As to {{the cause}} of death, the witness said it could be stated in two words. The {{internal}} jugular vein had been cut through, with such violence, judging by the appearances, that the wound could not have been inflicted, in the act of suicide, by the hand of the deceased person. No other injuries, and no <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>disease,</b> was found on the body. The one cause of death had been Hemorrhage; and the one peculiarity which called for notice had been discovered in the mouth. Two of the front teeth, in the upper jaw, were false. They had been so admirably made to resemble the natural teeth on either side of them, in form and color, that the witness had only hit on the discovery by accidentally touching the inner side of the gum with one of his fingers.|$|E
6000|$|Mr Powell did {{not wait}} for more. He went down on the main deck. Without taking the mate's jeremiads seriously he put them beside the words of Mr Smith. He had grown already {{attached}} to Captain Anthony. There was something not only attractive but compelling in the man. Only {{it is very difficult}} for youth to believe in the menace of death. Not in the fact itself, but in its proximity to a breathing, moving, talking, superior human being, showing no <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>disease.</b> And Mr Powell thought that this talk was all nonsense. But his curiosity was awakened. There was something, and at any time some circumstance might occur ... No, he would never find out ... There was nothing to find out, most likely. Mr Powell went to his room where he tried to read a book he had already read a good many times. Presently a bell rang for the officers' supper.|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} {{of age and}} sex on the induction of chronic EAMG was analysed. Aged male rats, immunized with Torpedo acetylcholine receptor (tAChR), showed no clinical <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> <b>disease</b> or AChR loss. Immunization of young male Brown Norway (BN) rats resulted in both clinical <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> <b>disease</b> and 65 % AChR loss. In contrast, both young and aged female BN rats showed comparable AChR loss (58 % and 50 %, respectively), although aged female rats did not develop clinical <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> <b>disease.</b> Differences in antibody titres, isotype distribution, fine specificity or complement activation could {{not account for the}} observed resistance. These results suggest that resistance against EAMG in aged rats is due to resistance of the AChR against antibody-mediated degradation, or to mechanisms able to compensate for AChR loss...|$|R

The majority of these dimples are minor and do not represent any underlying disease; however, the minority may be a <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>disease,</b> notably spina bifida. Even so, this is usually the spina bifida occulta form, which is the least serious kind.|$|E
50|$|In a gingival pocket, no {{destruction}} of the connective tissue fibers (gingival fibers) or alveolar bone occurs. This early <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>disease</b> in the mouth is completely reversible when the etiology of the edematous reaction is eliminated and frequently occurs without dental surgical therapy. However, in certain situations, a gingivectomy is necessary to reduce the gingival pocket depths to a healthy 1-3 mm.|$|E

Clubbing for no obvious reason can also occur, but is rare. Hippocrates was probably the first to document clubbing as a <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>disease,</b> and the phenomenon is therefore occasionally called [...] "Hippocratic fingers".|$|E
40|$|Chytridiomycosis, {{a disease}} caused by Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, {{has contributed to}} {{worldwide}} amphibian population declines; however, the pathogenesis <b>of</b> this <b>disease</b> is still somewhat unclear. Previous studies suggest that infection disrupts cutaneous sodium transport, which leads to hyponatremia and cardiac failure. However, infection is also correlated with unexplained effects on appetite, skin shedding, and white blood cell profiles. Glucocorticoid hormones may be the biochemical connection between these disparate effects, because they regulate ion homeostasis and can also influence appetite, skin shedding, and white blood cells. During a laboratory outbreak of B. dendrobatidis in Australian Green Tree Frogs, Litoria caerulea, we compared frogs showing clinical <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> chytridiomycosis to infected frogs showing no <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> <b>disease</b> and determined that diseased frogs had elevated baseline corticosterone, decreased plasma sodium and potassium, and altered WBC profiles. Diseased frogs also showed evidence of poorer body condition and elevated metabolic rates compared with frogs showing no <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> <b>disease.</b> Prior to displaying <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> <b>disease,</b> we also observed changes in appetite, body mass, {{and the presence of}} shed skin associated with infected but not yet diseased frogs. Collectively, these results suggest that elevated baseline corticosterone is associated with chytridiomycosis and correlates with some of th...|$|R
5000|$|A {{delegation}} {{of members of}} the sanitation board was to greet every incoming ship. They were then to ask for the captain’s log, which recorded every city the ship had landed in, and to consult the sanitation board's master list of cities throughout the Mediterranean who had rumors of recent plague activity. The delegation also inspected all the cargo, crew and passengers looking for <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> possible <b>disease.</b> Should they see <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> <b>disease,</b> the ships were to be turned away from Marseilles docks. If there were no <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> <b>disease,</b> but the ship’s itinerary included a city with documented plague activity, then the ship was sent to the second tier of quarantine on islands outside of Marseilles harbor. The criteria for the lazarettos were ventilation (to drive off the miasma <b>of</b> <b>disease),</b> be near the sea to facilitate communication and pumping of water to clean, and must be isolated yet be easily accessible.|$|R

50|$|Pulmonary {{insufficiency}} (or incompetence, or regurgitation) is {{a condition}} in which the pulmonary valve is incompetent and allows backflow from the pulmonary artery to the right ventricle of the heart during diastole. While a small amount of backflow may occur ordinarily, it is usually only shown on an echocardiogram and is harmless. More pronounced regurgitation that is noticed through a routine physical examination is a medical <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>disease</b> and warrants further investigation. If it is secondary to pulmonary hypertension it is referred to as a Graham Steell murmur.|$|E
40|$|Experiments {{were carried}} out to {{determine}} how turkeys, ducks, quails, pheasants, and pigeons respond to the same avian influenzavirus (A/turkey/Ontario/ 7732 / 66).
