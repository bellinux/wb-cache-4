Thus these are a potential location for gene exchange and selection for resistance. We develop and analyze a mathematical model to quantify the <b>spread</b> of antimicrobial <b>resistance</b> in stored agricultural waste.

We show that the <b>spread</b> of <b>resistance</b> depends in a subtle way on the rates of gene transfer and antibiotic inflow.

The equipment for SIMS tends to be considerably more expensive to manufacture and operate. While <b>spreading</b> <b>resistance</b> is limited to silicon, germanium {{and a few other}} semiconductors, SIMS can profile the atomic concentration of almost anything in anything.

5000|$|The analogical current signals {{flowing through}} the tip/sample nanojunction are sent to the preamplifier, which {{transforms}} them into digital voltages that can be read by the data acquisition (DAQ) card of the computer. Many manufacturers integrate the preamplifier in the so-called [...] "CAFM application module", which is a removable component that can be fixed to the AFM (usually very near to the tip to minimize the electrical noise) to perform conductivity measurements. Similarly, many other modules allow AFMs to perform other operations, like scanning capacitance microscopy (SCM) or scanning <b>spreading</b> <b>resistance</b> microscopy (SSRM). In most CAFM experiments the currents measured typically can range between a few picoamperes and hundreds of microamperes, while the voltages readable by the DAQ card usually range between -3 V to +3V. Therefore, the preamplifier needs to provide a very low noise and a high transimpedance (gain). Figure 2 shows the simplified schematic of a typical low noise preamplifier for CAFM measurements, in which some elements can be distinguished: i) an operational amplifier with high input impedance; ii) a feedback resistor (Rf) and its parasite capacitor (Cs) and Johnson noise (et) associated effects; iii) a noise voltage source associated to the operational amplifier (en); and iv) a capacitance associated to the input interconnections (Ci). A correct selection of the electrical components is essential to achieve good and reliable CAFM data acquisition. For example, the value of Rf is not trivial: a very high value of Rf improves the noise-signal ratio, while reduces the bandwidth of the preamplifier. Therefore, the value of Rf should be chosen to provide enough bandwidth and a noise level below the current values {{that we want to}} measure. The parameter en can be easily reduced by using a commercial low noise operational amplifier. The capacitance associated to the connections (Ci) can be easily minimized by placing the preamplifier as near as possible to the conductive tip. The company FEMTO, one of the world leading manufacturers of preamplifiers compatible with CAFMs, can provide devices with electrical noise as low as 3 fA and a gain up to 1013 V/A. Nevertheless, the main limitation of CAFM preamplifiers is their narrow current dynamic range, which usually allows collecting electrical signals only within three or four orders of magnitude (or even less). To solve this problem preamplifiers with an adjustable gain can be used to focus on specific ranges. A more sophisticated solution for this problem is to combine the CAFM with a sourcemeter, semiconductor parameter analyzer or with a logarithmic preamplifier, which can capture the currents {{flowing through the}} tip/sample system at any range and with a high resolution.|$|E

The ability to perform an accurate thermal performance analysis of a heat sink is a crucial step in the design process.
