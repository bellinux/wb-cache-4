40|$|This article’s model based {{diagnostics}} {{system has}} four modules. Diagnosis and fault location forms physics {{models of the}} machine, measures states off the real in-service machine, generates simulated machine states and simulated <b>sensor</b> <b>outputs</b> for the machine model with loads same as the real machine, and compares simulated <b>sensor</b> <b>outputs</b> to real <b>sensor</b> <b>outputs.</b> The parameter tuning module adjusts (tunes) {{the parameters of the}} model until the simulated <b>sensor</b> <b>outputs</b> closely mimic real <b>sensor</b> <b>outputs.</b> Tuning transfers information on the system’s health from the sensor data to the model’s parameters. Parameters changed from nominal values locate faults and bad parts. For the health assessment module to assess machine health, we view a machine as a “machine channel ” that organizes power and information flow through the machine. Machines focus power via an organization inherent in its components and design. Broken or degraded components disrupt this organization and the power and information flows. Shannon’s information theory for communications channels can then be applied as a health metric to this “machine channel”. Ageing of components degrades machine functional health. To prognose future health, differential equations that model ageing of the machine’s components are formulated and solved. These equations predict component degradation, and update values of parameters in the model associated with component ageing. With these future parameter values, simulations of the machine operation model can then predict “future” machine behavior, and system health. This article demonstrates these methods on motors and a pump. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Autonomous {{mobile robot}} {{behaviors}} are notoriously {{difficult to predict}} using simulations. Robot behaviors are driven by the robot’s sensor systems, and <b>sensor</b> <b>outputs</b> need to be produced in simulations at near-truth levels. However, {{in order to achieve}} real-time or faster performance, most simulation environments use empircal, effects-based sensor models, and these simplified models do not provide <b>sensor</b> <b>outputs</b> at the level of fidelity necessary to develop and test autonomy algorithms. Simulated <b>sensor</b> <b>outputs</b> must accurately reflect not only the sensor’s intrinsic noise and signal processing effects but also the sensor’s interaction with its external environment. To address this need for physics-based sensor models, models of the Global Positioning System (GPS), micro electro-mechanical (MEMS) accelerometer, and MEMS gyroscope sensors were developed using a first-principles, physics-based methodology. These sensor models run in near real-time on high performance computering (HPC) assets. The sensors were simulated for a test site located in Vicksburg, MS, and the simulated <b>sensor</b> <b>outputs</b> were compared to truth data collected using a Garmin hand held GPS unit and low cost 6 DOF commercial inertial measurement unit (IMU) consisting of three orthogonal MEMS accelerometers and 3 orthogonal MEMS gyroscopes.
