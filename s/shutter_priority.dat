50|$|In {{addition}} to its ISO capability, the F10's success was also fueled by its excellent battery life, speedy shooting, and overall picture quality. One of the camera's weaknesses, however, was manual shooting. Lacking aperture and <b>shutter</b> speed <b>priority</b> modes, the F10 was mostly a point and shoot camera. Other criticisms included the proprietary dongle needed to make any connections to the camera and a relatively high level of purple fringing.|$|R
50|$|The OM-10 hit {{the markets}} in June 1979 {{at the same}} time as the OM-2N. The camera was a 35mm focal-plane <b>shutter</b> {{aperture}} <b>priority</b> AE SLR camera with an electronic shutter. Only aperture-priority AE was available with the camera unless the optional manual exposure adapter was installed. This allowed the setting of shutter speeds between 1s and 1/1000s, (bulb mode was also available). The camera was equipped with a fixed pentaprism viewfinder which contained an LED exposure indicator. The finder coverage was measured to be 93%.|$|R

5000|$|The Canon AV-1 is a 35mm single-lens {{reflex camera}} with an FD lens mount, {{introduced}} by Canon Inc. in 1979. The AV-1 {{was very similar}} to the 1976 AE-1 but provided aperture priority autoexposure rather than the AE-1's <b>shutter</b> speed <b>priority</b> AE. [...] The camera is not capable of fully manual exposure.Canon's international distributors, particularly in the United States, had clamored for such a camera because competing brands offered mostly aperture-priority cameras and some preferred it. [...] The AV in the name referred to the type of autoexposure; Av (Aperture Value) is a common abbreviation for aperture priority.|$|R
50|$|Early {{examples}} of Exposure Simulation Live View (ES-LV) in advanced prosumer digicams with Full Manual / Manual ISO, such as Canon's PowerShot Pro70 (1998), Powershot G1 (2000) and Powershot Pro90 IS (2001), all feature an optical viewfinder or optical tunnel and display the preview image on their vari-angle swivel screen LCD. This gives a live real-time WYSIWYG (what {{you see is}} what you get) exposure simulation preview in Full Manual / Manual ISO mode, and Auto-Exposure (AE) / Manual ISO modes: P (Program), Tv (Time Value: <b>shutter</b> speed <b>priority),</b> and Av (Aperture Value). If Auto ISO is used, Autogain (Auto-EV0) framing/focus live view suspends Exposure Simulation live view.|$|R
50|$|The major {{improvements}} in the FM3A compared to the FM2N are the hybrid electro-mechanically controlled aluminium-bladed focal plane <b>shutter,</b> the aperture <b>priority</b> auto-exposure mode, the match-needle exposure control system and provision for through-the-lens (TTL) off-the-film (OTF) electronic flash automation. In other words, the FM3A merged the robust mechanical systems of the FM2N with the proven, reliable electronic exposure controls of the FE2.|$|R
50|$|<b>Shutter</b> <b>priority</b> {{with longer}} {{exposures}} is chosen {{to create an}} impression of motion. For example, a waterfall will appear blurred and fuzzy. If the camera is panned with a moving subject, the background will appear blurred. When photographing sports or high-speed phenomena, <b>shutter</b> <b>priority</b> with short exposures can ensure that the motion is effectively frozen in the resulting image.|$|E

50|$|This {{camera is}} known by several names and variations, it {{features}} full automatic program, and 5 preset programs. Manual control {{is not an}} option. It has a prominent visible built in flash and was released in 1995, the ISO settings range 25-5000, the focal plane shutter speeds: 30 seconds - 1/2000. It is considered an entry level camera {{because of the lack}} of manual, <b>shutter,</b> or aperture, <b>priority</b> capability.|$|R
50|$|Other {{advanced}} {{features of}} the 950 included <b>shutter</b> and aperture <b>priority</b> modes {{and the ability to}} custom-preset white balance. The 950 included a flash-sync socket for use with various Nikon external flash units (no shoe-mount was provided, however). As with all 9xx series, the lens movement during focusing and zooming was all internal, resulting in superior weather and dust resistance. The 950 shared with other 9xx series cameras the 28 mm filter threads and shared numerous Nikon and 3rd-party filters and diopter filters.|$|R
50|$|The Nikon F3 was Nikon's third {{professional}} single-lens {{reflex camera}} body, preceded by the F and F2. Introduced in 1980, it had manual and semi-automatic exposure control whereby the camera would select the correct <b>shutter</b> speed (aperture <b>priority</b> automation). The Nikon F3 series cameras {{had the most}} model variations of any Nikon F camera. It {{was also the first}} of numerous Nikon F-series cameras to be styled by Italian designer Giorgetto Giugiaro, and to include a red stripe on the handgrip - a feature that would later become (with variants of stripes and various other shapes) a signature feature of many Nikon cameras.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} component concepts {{developed for}} the ITER core charge exchange recombination spectroscopy (cCXRS). They {{are based on the}} cCXRS layout of 2009, named as reference design option. It includes an outer shell, carrying a blanket shield module and a shielding cassette. The cassette, attached to the outer shell, carries secondary mirrors and a retractable tube. The tube holds a first mirror (M 1) and a <b>shutter.</b> Development <b>priority</b> is given to the M 1, M 1 holder, shutter, calibration system and retractable tube. These units are the most critical from reliability point of view. The developed design approaches could be likely used as generic or prototype solutions for a cCXRS diagnostic port plug in future. Before prototyping critical components as the M 1 holder and shutter, the final cCXRS conceptual design has to meet forthcoming changes in the ITER diagnostic upper port plug (UPP) and blanket system. The integrated first wall - diagnostic shield modules, first wall recession, blanket shaping and generic UPP layout have considerable impact on the layout of the cCXRS and its components. The paper presents a preliminary solution for integration of the customized reference cCXRS into expected ITER blanket and UPP layouts. Â© 2011 FORSCHUNGSZENTRUM JULICH GMBH-EURATOM-FZJ...|$|R

50|$|In 1977, Minolta {{introduced}} the XD-11, the first multimode 35 mm compact SLR to include both aperture and <b>shutter</b> <b>priority</b> {{in a single}} body. It {{was also the first}} camera to employ a computerised chip, which in <b>shutter</b> <b>priority</b> mode overrode the chosen speed if necessary to give a correct exposure, thus offering the first-ever 'programmed mode'. The XD-11 is {{considered by many to be}} the best manual-focus 35 mm SLR Minolta ever produced, and the last serious attempt by Minolta to enter the professional and semiprofessional 35 mm SLR market until the Maxxum 9 in 1998. Elements of the XD-11 design (called the XD-7 in Europe) were utilized by Leitz for the Leica R4 camera.|$|E
50|$|The Nikon FA was {{a mostly}} metal, heavily {{computerized}} {{version of the}} Nikon FE2. The FA was a battery-powered (two SR44 or LR44, or one 1/3N) electromechanically (much electronics, but many springs, gears and levers) controlled manual focus SLR with manual exposure control or aperture priority, <b>shutter</b> <b>priority</b> and programmed autoexposure. The FA was Nippon Kogaku's first SLR to have <b>shutter</b> <b>priority</b> autoexposure and first to have {{all four of the}} now standard PASM exposure modes. The FA actually had two programmed modes: a normal mode and a High Speed mode that automatically biased toward faster shutter speeds whenever an AI-S compatible lens (including Series E) of 135 mm or longer focal length was mounted.|$|E

50|$|The F10's sibling, the FinePix F11, {{which was}} not {{released}} in the United States except {{in the state of}} Hawaii, added aperture and <b>shutter</b> <b>priority</b> modes but still did not provide full manual control.
