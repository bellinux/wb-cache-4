2500|$|Zamilon is a virophage, a {{group of}} small DNA viruses that infect protists and require a helper virus to replicate; they are a type of <b>satellite</b> <b>virus.</b> Discovered in 2013 in Tunisia, infecting Acanthamoeba polyphaga amoebae, Zamilon most closely resembles Sputnik, the first virophage to be discovered. The name is Arabic for [...] "the neighbour". Its spherical {{particle}} is 50–60nm in diameter, and contains a circular double-stranded DNA genome of around 17kb, which is predicted to encode 20 polypeptides. A related strain, Zamilon 2, has been identified in North America.|$|E
5000|$|Panicum mosaic <b>satellite</b> <b>virus</b> (SPMV) is a plant <b>satellite</b> <b>virus.</b> It only infects grasses {{which are}} {{infected}} by Panicum mosaic virus.

50|$|Virophages are {{double-stranded}} DNA {{viruses that}} share properties with <b>satellite</b> <b>viruses</b> and inhibit or impair {{the reproduction of}} the auxiliary <b>virus.</b> As other <b>satellite</b> <b>viruses,</b> virophages depend on the coinfection of their host by another virus, typically a giant virus. In contrast to <b>satellite</b> <b>viruses,</b> virophages encode their own DNA replication proteins and are assumed {{to depend on the}} transcription proteins provided by the coinfecting giant virus. The virophage usually jeopardizes the reproduction of the auxiliary virus, a phenomenon that is also known from some <b>satellite</b> <b>viruses,</b> but Zamilon is an apparent exception.|$|R
40|$|<b>Satellite</b> <b>viruses</b> encode {{structural}} proteins {{required for}} the formation of infectious particles but depend on helper viruses for completing their replication cycles. Because of this unique property, <b>satellite</b> <b>viruses</b> that infect plants, arthropods, or mammals, as well as the more recently discovered satellite-like viruses that infect protists (virophages), have been grouped with other, so-called "sub-viral agents. " For the most part, <b>satellite</b> <b>viruses</b> are therefore not classified. We argue that possession of a coat-protein-encoding gene and the ability to form virions are the defining features of a bona fide <b>virus.</b> Accordingly, all <b>satellite</b> <b>viruses</b> and virophages should be consistently classified within appropriate taxa. We propose to create four new genera - Albetovirus, Aumaivirus, Papanivirus, and Virtovirus - for positive-sense single-stranded (+) RNA <b>satellite</b> <b>viruses</b> that infect plants and the family Sarthroviridae, including the genus Macronovirus, for (+) RNA <b>satellite</b> <b>viruses</b> that infect arthopods. For double-stranded DNA virophages, we propose to establish the family Lavidaviridae, including two genera, Sputnikvirus and Mavirus...|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} <b>satellite</b> <b>viruses</b> - viruses {{that require the}} {{assistance}} of another virus to complete their life cycle - are also known.

The following four genera have been proposed for positive sense single stranded RNA <b>satellite</b> <b>viruses</b> that infect plants - Albetovirus, Aumaivirus, Papanivirus and Virtovirus. A family - Sarthroviridae which includes the genus Macronovirus - has been proposed for the positive sense single stranded RNA <b>satellite</b> <b>viruses</b> that infect arthropods.|$|R
50|$|A {{satellite}} is a subviral agent {{composed of}} nucleic acid {{that depends on}} the co-infection of a host cell with a helper or master virus for its replication. When a satellite encodes the coat protein in which its nucleic acid is encapsidated it is referred to as a <b>satellite</b> <b>virus.</b> A <b>satellite</b> <b>virus</b> of mamavirus that inhibits the replication of its host has been termed a virophage. However, the usage of this term remains controversial {{due to the lack of}} fundamental differences between virophages and classical satellite viruses.|$|E
50|$|Enterobacteria phage P4 (also {{known as}} {{satellite}} phage P4) is a temperate bacteriophage {{of the family}} Myoviridae. It is a <b>satellite</b> <b>virus,</b> requiring P2-related helper phage to grow lytically.|$|E

50|$|<b>Satellite</b> <b>viruses</b> {{are small}} viruses with either RNA or DNA as their genomic {{material}} that require another virus to replicate. There {{are two types}} of DNA satellite viruses—the alphasatellites and the betasatellites—both of which are dependent on begomoviruses.

40|$|Satellite RNAs (satRNAs) and <b>satellite</b> <b>viruses</b> {{depend on}} the {{replicase}} complexes provided by their cognate helper viruses and host plants for replication, pretending that {{they are part of}} the viral genomes. Although satRNAs and <b>satellite</b> <b>viruses</b> do not share significant nucleotide sequence similarity with the helper viruses, the essential cis-acting elements recognized by the replicase complexes must reside on their genomes, acting as the mimicry for the molecular pretenders. By understanding how this molecular mimicry deceives the helper viruses into supporting the satellites, a significant amount of knowledge of the basic requirements and mechanisms for replication of <b>viruses</b> and <b>satellites</b> has been obtained. Here we review the recent advances in understanding the effects of the cis elements at the termini of satRNAs and <b>satellite</b> <b>viruses</b> on their accumulation. Several well-characterized satellite/helper virus systems, representing the non-coding short satRNAs, mRNA-type long satRNAs, circular satRNAs and <b>satellite</b> <b>viruses,</b> are compared and contrasted. It is concluded that different satellites may adopt different strategies to exploit the replication/transcription/translation machineries of their helper viruses, and different mimicries may be implemented by the same molecular pretender for different biological functions...|$|R

50|$|There {{exists a}} <b>{{satellite}}</b> <b>virus</b> to panicum mosaic virus. Although {{little is known}} about the satellite panicum mosaic virus, the pathogen is believed to play a role in the infection process because when combined with panicum mosaic virus, the <b>satellite</b> <b>virus</b> causes symptoms to appear earlier in the growing season and results in a more severe infection. Because of the change in disease virulence to the main viral pathogen, panicum mosaic virus and satellite panicum mosaic virus are believed to cause synergistic effects to their hosts. Satellite panicum mosaic virus cannot produce its own replication nor movement proteins, thus it depends entirely on panicum mosaic virus for replication and systemic movement in the host plant.|$|E

40|$|The {{view that}} {{satellite}} RNAs (satRNAs) and <b>satellite</b> <b>viruses</b> are purely molecular parasites of their cognate helper viruses has changed. The molecular mechanisms underlying the synergistic and/or antagonistic interactions among satRNAs/satellite viruses, helper viruses, and host plants {{are beginning to}} be comprehended. This review aims to summarize the recent achievements in basic and practical research, with special emphasis on the involvement of RNA silencing mechanisms in the pathogenicity, population dynamics, and, possibly, the origin(s) of these subviral agents.

40|$|<b>Virus</b> <b>satellites</b> are {{widespread}} subcellular entities, present both in eukaryotic and in prokaryotic cells. Their {{modus vivendi}} involves parasitism {{of the life}} cycle of their inducing helper viruses, which assures their transmission to a new host. However, the evolutionary and ecological implications of <b>satellites</b> on helper <b>viruses</b> remain unclear. Here, using staphylococcal pathogenicity islands (SaPIs) as a model of <b>virus</b> <b>satellites,</b> we experimentally show that helper viruses rapidly evolve resistance to their <b>virus</b> <b>satellites,</b> preventing SaPI proliferation, and SaPIs in turn can readily evolve to overcome phage resistance. Genomic analyses of both these experimentally evolved strains as well as naturally occurring bacteriophages suggest that the SaPIs drive the coexistence of multiple alleles of the phage-coded SaPI inducing genes, as well as sometimes selecting for the absence of the SaPI depressing genes. We report similar (accidental) evolution of resistance to SaPIs in laboratory phages used for Staphylococcus aureus typing and also obtain the same qualitative results in both experimental evolution and phylogenetic studies of Enterococcus faecalis phages and their <b>satellites</b> <b>viruses.</b> In summary, our results suggest that helper and <b>satellite</b> <b>viruses</b> undergo rapid coevolution, which is likely to {{play a key role in}} the evolution and ecology of the viruses as well as their prokaryotic hosts...|$|R
50|$|Satellites {{depend on}} co-infection {{of a host}} cell with a helper virus for {{productive}} multiplication.

50|$|In 2011, a {{new species}} of virophage (a <b>satellite</b> <b>virus</b> that impairs the ability of its co-infective host virus to replicate) was {{discovered}} in Organic Lake, the Organic Lake virophage.

50|$|Phage P4 infects Escherichia coli. It is a <b>satellite</b> <b>virus</b> which cannot {{engage in}} lytic growth without the {{presence}} of a P2-related helper phage.

40|$|AbstractTobacco {{necrosis}} virus (TNV) {{is a small}} icosahedral plant virus {{which is}} often associated with <b>satellite</b> <b>viruses.</b> The genomic RNA of TNV contains six open reading frames (ORFs), of which ORFs 1 and 2 are thought to encode the viral polymerase.

50|$|The <b>satellite</b> {{tobacco mosaic}} <b>virus</b> is a small, {{icosahedral}} plant virus which worsens {{the symptoms of}} infection by tobacco mosaic <b>virus</b> (TMV). <b>Satellite</b> <b>viruses</b> {{are some of the}} smallest possible reproducing units in nature; they achieve this by relying on both the host cell and a host virus (in this case, TMV) for the machinery necessary for them to reproduce. The entire STMV particle consists of 60 identical copies of a single protein that make up the viral capsid (coating), and a 1063-nucleotide single-stranded RNA genome which codes for the capsid and one other protein of unknown function.|$|R
40|$|Virophages are a {{new type}} of <b>satellite</b> <b>viruses</b> that infect giant DNA viruses of the Mimiviridae family.

40|$|Abstract Background Viroids, <b>satellite</b> RNAs, <b>satellites</b> <b>viruses</b> and {{the human}} {{hepatitis}} delta virus form the 'brotherhood' of the smallest known infectious RNA agents, known as the subviral RNAs. For most of these species, it is generally accepted that characteristics such as cell movement, replication, host specificity and pathogenicity are encoded in their RNA sequences and their resulting RNA structures. Although many sequences are indexed in publicly available databases, these sequence annotation databases do not provide the advanced searches and data manipulation capability for identifying and characterizing subviral RNA motifs. Description The Subviral RNA database is a web-based environment that facilitates the research and analysis of viroids, <b>satellite</b> RNAs, <b>satellites</b> <b>viruses,</b> the human hepatitis delta virus, and related RNA sequences. It integrates {{a large number of}} Subviral RNA sequences, their respective RNA motifs, analysis tools, related publication links and additional pertinent information (ex. links, conferences, announcements), allowing users to efficiently retrieve and analyze relevant information about these small RNA agents.

It is, therefore, possible to compare the tertiary structure of viral protein subunits, their quaternary interactions, and the interactions of protein subunits with the RNA genome. This analysis indicates that, in spite of common function and preservation of a “jelly-roll” motif in the protein monomer, the three viruses are remarkably different. The differences include the arrangement of secondary structural elements, interactions of adjacent subunits, and the disposition of subunits relative to icosahedral symmetry axes. In {{each of the three}} viruses, however, the narrow end of the jelly roll forms fivefold contacts. The fivefold protein interactions are organized about a Ca 2 +ion for STNV, an anion for STMV, and, apparently, neither of these for SPMV. Low-resolution neutron diffraction studies using H 2 O/D 2 O solvent contrast variation revealed the general location of the RNA genome within the STNV. In the case of SPMV, regions of electron density on the interior of the capsid could be assigned to RNA, although {{it was not possible to}} model the nucleic acid.

50|$|PMV {{was first}} {{observed}} in Kansas in 1953.

Other strains have been identified infecting centipedegrass (Eremochloa ophiuroides). Foxtail millet (Setaria italica), white proso millet (Panicum miliaceum) and pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum) have also been used to propagate PMV and panicum mosaic <b>satellite</b> <b>virus</b> (SPMV), and mechanical transmission can occur to maize and some cultivars of common wheat (Triticum aestivum).|$|E
5000|$|The virus called Mimivirus infects amoebae. Another virus, called Sputnik, also infects amoebae, but it cannot {{reproduce}} unless mimivirus {{has already}} infected the same cell.

50|$|In {{regard to}} {{pathogen}} composition, {{there are two}} characteristic components of panicum mosaic and its related panicum satellite mosaic viruses.

From replication testing, it is believed the 109S component is the panicum mosaic pathogen and the 42S component of the pathogen is the panicum <b>satellite</b> <b>virus</b> because the 109S component replicates independently while 42S cannot replicate without the presence of the 109S component.|$|E
