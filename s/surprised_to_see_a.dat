25|$|In 1938, {{while he}} was still leading Chinese forces in Shanxi, Japanese {{soldiers}} who had joined the Communists and were serving under Lin's command presented Lin with a Japanese uniform and katana, which they had captured in battle. Lin then put the uniform and katana on, jumped onto a horse, and rode away from the army. While riding, Lin was spotted alone by a sharpshooter in Yan's army. The soldier was <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> Japanese officer riding a horse in the desolate hills alone. He took aim at Lin and severely injured him. The bullet grazed Lin's head, penetrating deep enough to leave a permanent impression on his skull. After being shot in the head, Lin fell from his horse and injured his back.|$|E
500|$|Lennox was {{attending}} a benefit held by former South African president Nelson Mandela's 46664 HIV/AIDS campaign in 2003. There she was <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> {{man wearing a}} black t-shirt with the message [...] "I am HIV positive" [...] written in capital letters. She {{found it to be}} a bold statement and inquired about the man, {{who turned out to be}} Zackie Achmat, a South African activist, film director, and co-founder of the Treatment Action Campaign (TAC). Although the singer had been associated with the 46664 campaign, being introduced to Achmat gave her an opportunity to do more for the campaign and the project.|$|E
500|$|The Texian {{scouting}} party {{divided into}} two camps. Fannin supervised 49men at the south part of the horseshoe bend, while Bowie and the remaining men camped at {{the northern part of}} the bend. Any Mexican force coming from the north would be caught in their cross-fire. [...] Pickets were stationed around the area and in the mission tower, which offered greater visibility. As they settled down for the evening, the Texians were <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> Mexican cannonball, fired from one of the church towers in Bexar, hit just beyond their camp. [...] Many of the Texian soldiers believed that a priest from the mission had informed the Mexican Army of their position.|$|E
5000|$|Margot Fenring also {{reads the}} title page of a Fremkit manual in Dune: House Harkonnen:"This is like the Azhar Book," [...] Margot exclaimed, <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>an</b> edition adapted <b>to</b> Fremen ways. [...] "Our Book of Great Secrets." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's {{a private}} trough," [...] exclaimed a thin voice, high like a peewit's cry. We started in <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> tall, black-bearded man {{looking at us}} and away from us nervously, fidgeting uneasily some ten yards off.|$|R
30|$|The reader may <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> {{significant}} {{high fidelity}} simulation {{time for the}} small case study presented here; the reason for this, at least partially, is that our implementation is not generally efficient compared to commercial simulators which utilize efficient solvers particularly linear solvers.|$|R
2500|$|His {{ability to}} gain broad {{international}} support for the Gulf War and the war's result were seen as both a diplomatic and military triumph, rousing bipartisan approval, though his decision to withdraw without removing Saddam Hussein left mixed feelings, and attention returned to the domestic front and a souring economy. A New York Times article mistakenly depicted Bush as being <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> supermarket barcode reader; the report of his reaction exacerbated {{the notion that he}} was [...] "out of touch". Amid the early 1990s recession, his image shifted from [...] "conquering hero" [...] to [...] "politician befuddled by economic matters".|$|E
2500|$|This chapter {{begins with}} a {{reference}} to [...] "the old Salina ladies," [...] three elderly sisters whose right to have private masses in their home is being investigated by representatives of the Archdiocese of Palermo. That investigation is being undertaken because the ladies have certain relics in their home that, according to rumor, may not be authentic. Eventually, narration reveals the ladies are the three daughters of the Princeâ€”the authoritarian Concetta, the blunt-spoken Carolina, and the paralyzed Caterina. As the priests enter the chapel, they are <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> sensuously painted [...] "Madonna" [...] hanging behind the altar, and walls lined with relics.|$|E
2500|$|Mallet-Prevost {{was then}} sent to Spain, {{arriving}} in Madrid on June 12, 1894. [...] The first place the Mexican-born lawyer checked was the [...] in Seville. [...] There he found that Reavis had arrived as a tourist and after several days had applied for and was granted permission to search the archives. [...] Reavis searched bundles for several days without success, the archivist assigned to assist him believing the documents he was searching for did not exist. [...] Reavis then requested access to case 77, drawer 3, [...] (file) 31. [...] The assisting archivist was <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> document he had previously never seen in the bundle. [...] This incident was reported to the Chief Archivist who ordered that Reavis be carefully watched and that all records be carefully numbered before {{he was allowed to}} examine them in the future.|$|E
50|$|One {{side effect}} of this change is that the BogoMIPS value will reflect the timer {{frequency}}, not the CPU's core frequency. Typically the timer frequency is {{much lower than the}} processor's maximum frequency, and some users may be <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>an</b> unusually low BogoMIPS value when comparing against systems that use traditional busy-wait loops.|$|R
5000|$|Octavio {{dies and}} Claudio sees what {{happened}} but he's unable {{to say anything}} to the family because of Augusto's abuse. To be sure that Claudio won't say anything about Octavio's death, he sets his dog on him who bites him severely. When the family returns from Octavio's wake ceremony they're <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>an</b> injured Claudio muttering to himself [...] "Don't touch me. If you do I'll break...

5000|$|I {{have been}} abroad {{for the last}} four years, during which I left my {{daughter}} at a large and fashionable boarding school near London; I sent for her home directly I arrived, and, having had no bad accounts of her health during my absence, I expected <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> fresh rosy girl of seventeen come bounding to welcome me. What, then, was my <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> tall, pale young lady glide slowly in with measured gait and languidly embrace me? ...|$|R
2500|$|It {{has been}} six months since Marty McFly {{witnessed}} Emmett [...] "Doc" [...] Brown depart into an unknown time, {{and the bank}} has foreclosed on Doc's home. While helping his father George sort through Doc's possessions, Marty is <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> DeLorean time machine, which he thought had been destroyed, appear outside the house. Inside is Einstein, Doc's dog, and a tape recorder with a message from Doc explaining how the time machine would return to this present should Doc ever run into problems. Einstein helps track down Edna Strickland, the elderly sister of Marty's school principal and a former reporter for Hill Valley's paper. Marty reads through her newspaper collection to find Doc had been jailed in 1931 and killed by Irving [...] "Kid" [...] Tannen, Biff Tannen's father. Marty and Einstein set off to 1931 in the DeLorean to prevent Doc's death.|$|E
2500|$|Around this time, Lind {{became famous}} as a skirt dancer. [...] Skirt dancing, popularised by Kate Vaughn in the 1880s, {{was a huge}} craze until around 1910. [...] It fused the grace of ballet with the {{footwork}} of step-dancing, which was considered common and lacking in grace. [...] The dance depended on the dancer's skill in manipulating up to 12 metres of fabric in the skirt of her costume. Skirt dancing's advantage over ballet was that people could do it at home, and it became popular among all social classes. [...] Lind was able to differentiate herself from other skirt dancers because she {{had the benefit of}} classical training that most of them did not, and she often added an acrobatic touch to the end of her dances. [...] When she danced in America in 1888, the critics were <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> dancer who did not show her legs and breasts.|$|E
2500|$|Natan-Zada {{boarded the}} Shefa-'Amr-bound bus on Thursday, 4 August 2005. He {{was dressed in}} full IDF uniform, {{carrying}} his IDF-issued M16 rifle, and, according to observers, wearing the skullcap, beard, and sidelocks of an observant Jew, {{as well as an}} orange ribbon hanging from his pocket. According to witnesses, the bus driver was initially <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> religiously-observant Jewish soldier making his way to Shefa-'Amr (an overwhelmingly Arab city) via public bus, so he asked Natan-Zada if he was certain he wanted to take his current route. [...] Upon arriving in Shefa-'Amr's primary Druze neighborhood, Natan-Zada stood up and approached the front door as if to disembark the bus. [...] When the door opened, Natan-Zada turned around and shot the driver. He then fatally shot a man sitting behind the driver, and fired into the rest of the bus, killing two young women and wounding twenty-one passengers. When he paused to reload his weapon, a passenger grabbed the barrel of his gun, sustaining burn injuries, and he was subdued by streetgoers gathered around the scene of the bus shooting. When the police arrived at the scene he was tied up but still alive, but the small force of police officers on the scene could not prevent the crowd from lynching him, and nine police officers were injured attempting to protect him. It took the police four hours to remove his body from the scene.|$|E
50|$|His {{first big}} work was Jaya Jaya Shankara, which was {{published}} as a serial in Kalki in 1962. Reading about Adi Shankara and his philosophy of Advaita, in this book, people went to meet him for clarifications, and were taken by <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> youngster {{as the author of}} such a complex subject. After working at Kalki for over ten years, he went on to write several other serialized biographies of saints like Ramakrishna, Swami Vivekananda, Sarada Devi, and Meera.|$|R

While walking around, she finds a glass ring with jewels encased in the glass. Seeing it, she picks it up, believing it is important.

Sister is soon met by other survivors. They make their way through the hazardous Holland Tunnel, eventually scrabbling their way to New Jersey.|$|R

30|$|In {{light of}} the above, ML became the tool of choice for misuse-based IDSs. Its ability to find {{patterns}} in big datasets, fits the need to learn signatures of attacks from collected network traces. Hence, {{it comes as no}} <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> fair amount of literature [20, 84, 90, 252, 322, 344, 354, 402, 421] that rely on ML for misuse-detection. These efforts are summarized in TableÂ  21. Naturally, all existing works employ supervised learning, and the majority perform the detection offline. Note, we classify all work that use normal and attack data in their training set as misuse-detection.|$|R
5000|$|He had {{pitched a}} {{tent in the}} center of Addis Ababa, where he began to treat {{patients}} free of charge. While occupied at this undertaking, as Pankhurst tells the story, [...] "He was soon <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>an</b> old lady accompanied by attendants, going back and forth in front of his tent and regarding him with obvious attention." [...] The doctor, who had long forgotten the few words of Amharic he knew as a child and was forced to rely on an interpreter to talk to his fellow countrymen, sent the man to ask the lady what she wanted.|$|R
60|$|There {{is but one}} {{church in}} this town, {{but it is a}} very large one and well built, as most of the churches in this county are, and of impenetrable flint; indeed, there is no {{occasion}} for its being so large, for staying there one Sabbath day, I was <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>an</b> extraordinary large church, capable of receiving five or six thousand people, and but twenty-seven in it besides the parson and the clerk; {{but at the same time}} the meeting-house of the Dissenters was full to the very doors, having, as I guessed, from six to eight hundred people in it.|$|R

50|$|A {{critical}} {{aspect of}} Biju's {{work has been}} the combination of molecular techniques with traditional approaches bringing on par with the international practice in amphibian research. His efforts have resolved long-standing taxonomic and systematic problems and confusions in difficult amphibian groups: the bush frogs Philautus and night frogs Nyctibatrachus. In recognition of his outstanding contribution to India's modern amphibian systematics scientists named a frog after him Polypedates bijui. Biju's tireless endeavor brought the Indian amphibians into the global limelight. The world was taken by <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> frog featured {{on the cover of}} a largely macro-economics and a business magazine, The Economist, London.|$|R
6000|$|Two {{women and}} three men were at supper when he entered, and silently made room {{for him to}} sit down by them. When he had eaten he began to look about him, and was <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>an</b> animal sitting by the fire {{different}} from anything he had ever noticed before. It was grey in colour, and not very big; but its eyes were large and very bright, {{and it seemed to}} be singing in an odd way, quite unlike any animal in the forest. 'What is the name of that strange little creature?' asked he. And they answered, 'We call it a cat.' ...|$|R
