40|$|The {{effects of}} {{cross-coupled}} stimuli on the semicircular canals are {{shown to be}} influenced by the position of the <b>subject's</b> <b>head</b> with respect to gravity and the axis of rotation, but not by the <b>subject's</b> <b>head</b> position relative to the trunk. Seventeen healthy <b>subjects</b> made <b>head</b> yaw movements out of the horizontal plane while lying on a horizontal platform (MIT short radius centrifuge) rotating at 23 rpm about an earth-vertical axis. The subjects reported the magnitude and duration of the illusory pitch or roll sensations elicited by the cross-coupled rotational stimuli acting on the semicircular canals. The results suggest an influence of head position relative to gravity. The magnitude estimation is higher and the sensation decays more slowly when the head's final position is toward nose-up (gravity in the <b>subject's</b> <b>head</b> x-z-plane) compared to when the head is turned toward the side (gravity in the <b>subject's</b> <b>head</b> y-z-plane).

40|$|A newly {{developed}} head-mounted perimeter termed "imo" enables visual field (VF) testing without a fixed head position. Because the positional {{relationship between the}} <b>subject's</b> <b>head</b> and the imo is fixed, the effects of head position changes on the test results are small compared with those obtained using a stationary perimeter. However, only ocular counter-roll (OCR) induced by head tilt might affect VF testing. To quantitatively reveal the effects of head tilt and OCR on the VF test results, we investigated the associations among the head-tilt angle, OCR amplitude and VF testing results. For 20 healthy subjects, we binocularly recorded static OCR (s-OCR) while tilting the <b>subject's</b> <b>head</b> at an arbitrary angle ranging from 0 ° to 60 ° rightward or leftward in 10 ° increments. By monitoring iris patterns, we evaluated the s-OCR amplitude. We also performed blind spot detection while tilting the <b>subject's</b> <b>head</b> by an arbitrary angle ranging from 0 ° to 50 ° rightward or leftward in 10 ° increments to calculate the angle by which the blind spot rotates because of head tilt. The association between s-OCR amplitude and head-tilt angle showed a sinusoidal relationship. In blind spot detection, the blind spot rotated to {{the opposite direction of}} the head tilt, and the association between the rotation angle of the blind spot and the head-tilt angle also showed a sinusoidal relationship. The rotation angle of the blind spot was strongly correlated with the s-OCR amplitude (R 2 ≥ 0. 94, p< 0. 0001). A head tilt greater than 20 ° with imo causes interference between adjacent test areas. Both the s-OCR amplitude and the rotation angle of the blind spot were correlated with the head-tilt angle by sinusoidal regression. The rotated VF was correlated with the s-OCR amplitude. During perimetry using imo, the change in the <b>subject's</b> <b>head</b> tilt should be limited to 20 °...|$|R

5000|$|PSH is a tree {{structure}} with 44 thematic sections. Subject headings {{are included in}} a hierarchy of six (or seven) levels according to their semantic content and specificity. There are hierarchical, associative ("see also") and equivalence ("see") relations in PSH. Hierarchical relations are represented by broader and narrower terms (e.g. physical diagnostic methods is broader term to electrocardiography, {{and on the other}} hand, electrocardiography is narrower term to physical diagnostic methods). Equivalence relations link subject headings with their nonpreferred versions (e.g. electrocardiography and ECG). Moreover, associative relations are used to link related subject headings from different parts of PSH, regardless their affiliation to a section, (e.g. electrocardiography: see also cardiology). Every <b>subject</b> <b>heading</b> belongs to just one section, which has its own two-character abbreviation, assigned to every <b>subject</b> <b>heading</b> of the section.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to compare neurobehavioural {{outcomes}} and performance on neuropsychological measures of two groups of <b>subjects</b> with <b>head</b> injuries - those with focal/sharp head injuries and those with generalized/blunt head injuries. The study was conducted in two parts. Part one involved examining epidemiology and neurobehavioural outcomes of 235 <b>subjects</b> with <b>head</b> injuries. As expected, young males with low educational levels were most likely to sustain <b>head</b> injury. Maori <b>subjects</b> were overly represented in comparison to general population statistics. <b>Subjects</b> sustaining <b>head</b> injuries from focal/sharp head injuries, such as assaults, exhibited more irritability than <b>subjects</b> with generalized/blunt <b>head</b> injuries. No conclusive information was obtained concerning post-traumatic epilepsy or post-traumatic stress disorder. Part two of this study involved a comparison of the performance of subjects on a wide range of neuropsychological measures. It was predicted that <b>subjects</b> with focal/sharp <b>head</b> injuries would exhibit more specific cognitive difficulties than <b>subjects</b> with generalized/blunt <b>head</b> injuries. Some support was provided for this hypothesis, but more often the data contradicted it. <b>Subjects</b> with focal/sharp <b>head</b> injuries were less likely to experience difficulties in areas sensitive to frontal lobe damage.
