5|$|Although {{specimens}} of M.griveaudi differ by only 0.6% in their cytb sequences, analysis of D-loop data does show some differentiation between the island populations. These {{data suggest that}} the species originated on Madagascar, where a large, <b>stable</b> <b>population</b> persists, and independently colonized Grande Comore and Anjouan; subsequently, the Grande Comore and Anjouan populations came into contact, resulting in inter-island gene flow.|$|E
5|$|Breeding over a huge area, the Siberian accentor has a {{large and}} {{apparently}} <b>stable</b> <b>population.</b> It is therefore evaluated as a species of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), although, as a northern breeding species, it may be affected by climate change in the long term.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{construction}} of hypothetical "model" migration schedules and multiregional <b>stable</b> <b>populations.</b> It begins by identifying the persistent regularities that are exhibited by observed migration schedules and then summarizes these regularities by means of regression equations to establish a family of hypothetical migration schedules. These schedules are then combined with model fertility and mortality schedules to generate hypothetical <b>stable</b> <b>populations</b> which offer valuable insights into the dynamics of spatial population growth and change...|$|R

40|$|In many European {{countries}} {{a strong}} decline of Phragmites australis (common reed) populations {{has been observed}} {{during the past two}} decades. This has become known as die-back or reed regression. A greenhouse growth experiment was performed with P. australis cuttings from <b>stable</b> and die-back <b>populations</b> from The Czech Republic and The Netherlands. The <b>stable</b> <b>populations</b> were from fertile and infertile environments, and the die-back populations were originally from infertile but now eutrophicated habitats. It was hypothesised that (i) <b>stable</b> P. australis <b>populations</b> from fertile and infertile habitats would show inherent differences in biomass (allocation) and N-content in response to nitrogen loading, and (ii) die-back populations would be more similar to <b>stable</b> <b>populations</b> from infertile as opposed to fertile habitats in terms of biomass (allocation) and N-content. The <b>stable</b> Czech <b>populations</b> showed an increase in dry weight with increasing fertility of the habitat. This was not related, however, to leaf area ratio (LAR), specific leaf area (SLA) or nitrogen use efficiency (NUE). The dry weight of the <b>stable</b> Dutch <b>populations</b> did not vary with fertility, although the population from the infertile habitat showed a higher allocation of dry matter and nitrogen to the below-ground parts as compared to the fertile habitat population. Total dry weight of the die-back Czech population did not differ from that seen for <b>stable</b> <b>populations</b> from the infertile habitats, and no {{differences were found between the}} Dutch populations. Die-back populations did not show a higher resemblance with <b>stable</b> <b>populations</b> from infertile as opposed to fertile habitats with respect to plant traits involved in the capture of Light and/or nitrogen. Most plant traits were affected by nitrogen, irrespective of habitat fertility, and populations did differ in morphology and dry matter allocation. However, since performance of populations could not be related to the fertility of the habitat, both hypotheses were rejected. The importance of other selectional processes is discussed.

5|$|Foreign {{immigration}} {{is also a}} factor in the state's population growth, causing the state's population to continue to grow as of the 2010 Census (particularly in Massachusetts gateway cities where costs of living are lower). 40% of foreign immigrants were from Central or South America, according to a 2005 Census Bureau study, with many of the remainder from Asia. Many residents who have settled in Greater Springfield claim Puerto Rican descent. Many areas of Massachusetts showed relatively <b>stable</b> <b>population</b> trends between 2000 and 2010. Exurban Boston and coastal areas grew the most rapidly, while Berkshire County in far Western Massachusetts and Barnstable County on Cape Cod were the only counties to lose population as of the 2010 Census.|$|E
5|$|Within its range, the pied butcherbird is {{generally}} sedentary. Common in woodlands and in urban environments, it is carnivorous, eating small vertebrates and insects. A tame and inquisitive bird, the pied butcherbird {{has been known}} to accept food from humans. It nests in trees, constructing a cup-shaped structure out of sticks and laying two to five eggs. The pied butcherbird engages in cooperative breeding, with a mated pair sometimes assisted by several helper birds. The troop is territorial, defending the nesting site from intruders. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the pied butcherbird as being of least concern on account of its large range and apparently <b>stable</b> <b>population.</b>|$|E
5|$|Gerard van Swieten, whom Maria Theresa had {{recruited}} {{following the}} death of her sister, Archduchess Maria Anna, founded the Vienna General Hospital, revamped Austria's educational system and served as the Empress's personal physician. After calling in van Swieten, Maria Theresa asked him to study the problem of infant mortality in Austria. Following his recommendation, she made a decree that autopsies would be mandatory for all hospital deaths in the city of Graz, Austria's second largest city. This law – still in effect today – combined with the relatively <b>stable</b> <b>population</b> of Graz, resulted {{in one of the most}} important and complete autopsy records in the world. Maria Theresa banned the creation of new burial grounds without prior government permission, thus countering wasteful and unhygienic burial customs. Her decision to have her children inoculated after the smallpox epidemic of 1767 was responsible for changing Austrian physicians' negative view of inoculation. The empress herself inaugurated inoculation in Austria by hosting a dinner for the first sixty-five inoculated children in Schönbrunn Palace, waiting on the children herself.|$|E

5|$|In Hawaii, the planarian Endeavouria septemlineata {{has been}} used to control the {{imported}} giant African snail Achatina fulica, which was displacing native snails, and Platydemus manokwari, another planarian, {{has been used}} for the same purpose in Philippines, Indonesia, New Guinea and Guam. Although A. fulica has declined sharply in Hawaii, there are doubts about how much E. septemlineata contributed to this. However, P. manokwari is given credit for severely reducing, and in places exterminating, A. fulica – achieving much greater success than most biological pest control programs, which generally aim for a low, <b>stable</b> <b>population</b> of the pest species. The ability of planarians to take different kinds of prey and to resist starvation may account for their ability to decimate A. fulica. However, these abilities have raised concerns that planarians may themselves become a serious threat to native snails.|$|E
5|$|The {{gray wolf}} was {{once one of}} the world's most widely {{distributed}} mammals, living throughout the northern hemisphere north of 15°N latitude in North America and 12°N in India. However, deliberate human persecution has reduced the species' range to about one third, because of livestock predation and fear over attacks on humans. The species is now extinct in much of Western Europe, in Mexico and much of the United States. In modern times, the gray wolf occurs mostly in wilderness and remote areas, particularly in Canada, Alaska and northern USA, Europe, and Asia from about 75°N to 12°N. Wolf population declines have been arrested since the 1970s, and have fostered recolonization and reintroduction in parts of its former range, due to legal protection, changes in land-use and rural human population shifts to cities. Competition with humans for livestock and game species, concerns over the danger posed by wolves to people, and habitat fragmentation pose a continued threat to the species. Despite these threats, because of the gray wolf's relatively widespread range and <b>stable</b> <b>population,</b> it is classified as least concern by the IUCN.|$|E
5|$|Native herbivores such as {{the moose}} are found in small numbers near waterways, {{especially}} at lower elevations. Moose populations in northwestern Wyoming and other areas of North America {{have been on the}} decline {{since the end of the}} 20th century, possibly due to a parasite. There were an estimated 739 moose in the forest in 2006 which is almost 300 fewer than there were 20 years earlier. Other ungulate species are much more common and there are over 20,000 elk (also known as wapiti) and 40,000 mule deer. Bighorn sheep and mountain goats inhabit the rocky terrain and highest elevations. During the winter, one of the largest bighorn sheep herds in the lower 48 states congregate in the region around Dubois, Wyoming; however, their numbers since 1990 have been diminished due to disease transmitted from contact with domesticated sheep and goats. An estimated 5,000 bighorn sheep are found throughout the forest and a small but <b>stable</b> <b>population</b> of 200 mountain goats reside in the northernmost portions of the forest. Bison and pronghorn antelope are two other ungulates that live on the forest and have sustainable populations.|$|E

40|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that amyloid β-protein (Aβ) oligomers may be seminal pathogenic agents in Alzheimer's disease (AD).
