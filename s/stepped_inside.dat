5|$|Despite United's early pressure, it was Barcelona {{who scored}} the first {{goal of the}} match. Edwin van der Sar cleared the ball downfield for Manchester United, but it was headed away by Barcelona's midfield anchor Sergio Busquets. Carrick was first to the ball for Manchester United, but he could only head {{it as far as}} Xavi, who passed to Andrés Iniesta. The Manchester United defence backed away from the Spaniard, who – after exchanging passes with Lionel Messi – played the ball into the path of Samuel Eto'o in the Manchester United penalty area. Nemanja Vidić {{attempted}} to shepherd the Cameroonian striker towards the goal line, but Eto'o easily <b>stepped</b> <b>inside</b> him and toe-poked the ball past Van der Sar to make it 1–0 to Barcelona inside 10minutes.|$|E
25|$|Bull and Fox {{captured}} Spillman with no incident, {{and placed}} him {{in the custody of}} several miners while the two continued to search for the others. Locating them in a large tent used as a saloon, Bull <b>stepped</b> <b>inside</b> with a double barrel shotgun, and demanded both men throw up their hands and surrender. Arnett immediately grabbed his pistol laying on the table beside him, at which point Bull shot him with one blast from his shotgun in the chest, killing him instantly. Jermagin surrendered, and he and Spillman were tried the next morning in a makeshift court. Jermagin was able to successfully argue that he played no part in the horse theft. However, Spillman was convicted and sentenced to hang. The next morning he was executed.|$|E
2500|$|The general {{elections}} of June 15 in the Oviedo constituency resulted in 584,061 votes cast, for a voter turnout rate of 74.6%. PCE got 60,297 votes (10.5% of the ballot), {{good enough to}} seat one member, Dolores Ibárruri. The party with the most votes was the Spanish Workers' Socialist Party (31.8%). In contrast, the dictatorship's party, Falange Española, garnered a minuscule 0.46%. On July 13 at 10:05 AM—she notes in her memoirs— Ibárruri <b>stepped</b> <b>inside</b> the chamber of Congress she had vacated forty-one years before. Moments later she occupied the inaugural session's vice-presidential chair. The next day Radio España Independiente aired its last broadcast, number 108,300. On July 22 the king opened Parliament. She joined in the 1-minute general standing ovation, although she remained seated. Earlier, as Ibárruri entered Congress, a 56-year-old man in Falangist uniform gave the Roman salute and heckled her, [...] "Drop dead! If you had any shame {{you would not have}} returned to Spain." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 258, Sun Chen deposed {{the second}} Wu emperor Sun Liang and {{replaced}} the latter with Sun Xiu. Sun Xiu was unhappy that Sun Chen monopolised state power so he plotted with the minister Zhang Bu to eliminate Sun Chen. Zhang Bu told the emperor, [...] "Ding Feng {{may not be}} proficient in administrating civil affairs, but he is an outstanding strategist and is capable of making important decisions." [...] Sun Xiu then summoned Ding Feng for a meeting and said to the latter, [...] "Sun Chen usurps state power and is plotting treason. I want {{you to help me}} eliminate him." [...] Ding Feng replied, [...] "The Chancellor (Sun Chen) and his brothers have many supporters. Not everyone in the imperial court is on our side. We cannot confront them directly. I suggest that Your Majesty order your soldiers to kill him during the Laba Festival." [...] Sun Xiu followed Ding Feng's plan and pretended to invite Sun Chen to the palace to celebrate the Laba Festival. When Sun Chen <b>stepped</b> <b>inside,</b> Ding Feng and Zhang Bu signalled to the imperial guards to kill him. For his contributions, Ding Feng was promoted to the position of General-in-Chief (大將軍) and received the additional appointments of Left and Right Protectors of the Capital (左右都護).|$|E
