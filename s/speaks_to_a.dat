5|$|Father John {{returns to}} the red-light {{district}} and <b>speaks</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> prostitute named Miriam (Greta Oglesby), who suggests a powerful pimp named James St. Clair (Ansa Akyea) might know about the woman. As they speak in a bar, the mysterious prostitute enters and solicits a john (Patrick Coyle), who leaves with her immediately. As she goes, Father John catches {{a glimpse of the}} crucifix she is wearing and tries to chase her down. She leaves in the john's car before he can catch them, but he writes down the license plate as they drive off. Back at church, his sermons start to grow more unorthodox, and Father Ralph warns him that his unusual church manner and trips to the red-light district have the archbishop concerned. Meanwhile, Father John is contacted by his ex-girlfriend Nadine Brennan (Amy Matthews), who tells him she is divorcing her husband and still harbors romantic feelings for Father John.|$|E
5|$|Veronica and Piz {{hang out}} at her house. Keith (Enrico Colantoni) tests Veronica on her {{upcoming}} private investigator exam, and Piz states that he is interviewing a former child soldier, Apollo, and Hearst student for his radio show. Keith informs his deputies that a robbery wave has been occurring. Piz interviews the student before telling Veronica {{that he has been}} offered an internship by Pitchfork Media. Veronica receives a 95% on the PI exam before being called by a man stating that Apollo is his son. Keith <b>speaks</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> suspect in some of the robberies and discovers that he is connected to the Fitzpatricks. Logan meets Parker’s (Julie Gonzalo) parents, who are very uptight. Veronica speaks to Apollo, posing as a reporter for the school newspaper, finding that Apollo’s mother’s handwriting is very similar to the letter his father claimed to have from his mother.|$|E
25|$|Nechtan's ecclesiastical {{reforms are}} seen as having led to closer links between Pictland and Northumbria, with notable results in artistic forms. His {{expulsion}} of Ionan clerics, rather than being a submission to Rome and Northumbria, probably marks the coming of age of an independent Pictish church, which nonetheless remained close to Iona and to Ireland. In addition, it <b>speaks</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> very considerable degree of royal control over the church in Pictland, which {{appears to have been}} contentious in the ninth century.|$|E

25|$|A {{group of}} poets of the Beat Generation gather around Allen Ginsberg in the smoky {{atmosphere}} of an underground cellar where Bebop music is played. They talk of Marilyn's death and look towards the East for {{hope in the}} guise of Buddha and Nirvana. Marilyn has supper with Yves Montand and gives him one of her poems. Left alone, she sings a hymn to the night. A silent pacifist demonstration files past and is broken up by the police. Marilyn phones her analyst again, then receives the visit of a mysterious person who slaps her. Timothy Leary lectures on the effects of LSD, Mescaline and Psilocybin and incites the audience to experiment with drugs. The police puts an end to the general delirium by carrying everyone away. Marilyn, in a hopeless state, {{under the influence of alcohol}} and barbiturates, <b>speaks</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> doll about her despair. The threatening shadows of two male figures appear on the background. Help! Help! she calls...|$|E

[...] For The A.V.

500|$|The Economist heralded the book's publication, saying [...] "If {{there is}} no place for Watership Down in children’s bookshops, then children’s {{literature}} is dead." [...] Peter Prescott, senior book reviewer at Newsweek, gave the novel a glowing review: [...] "Adams handles his suspenseful narrative more dextrously than most authors who claim to write adventure novels, but his true achievement lies in the consistent, comprehensible and altogether enchanting civilisation that he has created." [...] Kathleen J. Rothen and Beverly Langston identified the work as one that [...] "subtly <b>speaks</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> child", with [...] "engaging characters and fast-paced action [...] make it readable." [...] This echoed Nicholas Tucker's praise for the story's suspense in the New Statesman: [...] "Adams ... has bravely and successfully resurrected the big picaresque adventure story, with moments of such tension that the helplessly involved reader finds himself checking whether things are going to work out all right on the next page before daring to finish the preceding one." ...|$|E
500|$|In contrast, groups {{opposed to}} {{abortion}} saw [...] "Papa Don't Preach" [...] as a positive, pro-life song. Susan Carpenter-McMillan, {{the president of}} the California chapter of Feminists for Life (FFL) in the US, said that [...] "abortion is readily available on every street corner for young women. Now what Madonna is telling them is, hey, there's an alternative." [...] Tipper Gore, a founder of the Parents Music Resource Center (PMRC), who a year earlier denounced Madonna for the sexual lyrical content of her single [...] "Dress You Up", and had led a campaign against explicit content in music, commended Madonna for speaking candidly about such a serious subject and important social issue. When speaking of the song, Gore said [...] "the song <b>speaks</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> serious subject with a sense of urgency and sensitivity in both the lyrics and Madonna's rendition. It also speaks to the fact that there's got to be more support and more communication in families about this problem, and anything that fosters that I applaud." ...|$|E
500|$|Chung <b>speaks</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> {{science fiction}} and Dungeons & Dragons fanatic, Blaine, who {{frequently}} roams {{the woods of}} Klass County at night looking for UFOs. As Blaine tells Chung, one night he found an alien body that was subsequently recovered by Mulder, Scully and Detective Manners. Blaine thinks that Mulder and Scully {{are a couple of}} men in black. He claims that Mulder was emotionless, but shrieked when he saw the alien, and that Scully, whom Blaine believed was a man dressed like a woman, threatened him and told him not to talk to anyone about the alien body. Mulder allows Blaine to videotape Scully performing an autopsy on the alien, which is quickly released as a video [...] "documentary" [...] labeled [...] "Dead Alien! Truth or Humbug?" [...] that is narrated by the Stupendous Yappi (from [...] "Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose"). The autopsy reveals that the alien is actually a dead Air Force pilot in an alien costume. His superiors arrive to claim the body, but find it missing. Mulder tricks the military officers into revealing the identity of a second missing Air Force pilot, Lieutenant Jack Schaefer.|$|E

500|$|After a party Aden attends {{with his}} classmate Matilda Hunter (Indiana Evans), Cassie drives them home. She {{is under the}} {{influence}} of alcohol, and when Aden becomes high on marijuana and taunts her, she crashes. Aden sustains a leg injury that ends his chance of becoming a professional footballer. When Geoff refuses the chance to take up professional football, Aden intensifies his bullying of him. In return, Geoff punches Aden and knocks him out. Aden later helps an inebriated Annie, who has had her drink spiked. [...] Tony and Geoff presume that Aden was responsible as he was previously involved in similar prank with Tamsyn Armstrong (Gabrielle Scollay), and Annie lies to get Aden into trouble. The rest of the town believe he is to blame, so he seeks help from local lawyer Morag. Annie's guardian Irene Roberts (Lynne McGranger) hits Aden and injures his bad leg, which prompts him to file a claim against her. Annie admits that she lied, hoping that Aden will drop the lawsuit, but he refuses. He <b>speaks</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> journalist about Irene, which annoys Belle, Irene's lodger who is also a journalist. Belle writes an article of her own about Aden's war veteran grandfather, Stan, much to Aden's distress. He attacks Belle, sets fire to her article and cries.|$|E
500|$|In {{a review}} {{for the first}} issue, David Pepose of Newsarama wrote, [...] "The biggest victory that Bendis scores with Miles Morales is that he makes us care about him, and care about him quickly. Even though we're still {{scratching}} the surface of what makes him tick, we're seeing the world through his eyes, and it's similar to Peter Parker's but a whole lot tougher. But that kind of Parker-style guilt—that neurotic, nearly masochistic tendency for self-sacrifice that comes with great power and greater responsibility—is still intact." [...] Jesse Schedeen of IGN wrote that [...] "Miles still feels like {{a bit of an}} outsider in his own book. Bendis never quite paints a complete picture of Miles—his thoughts, motivations, personality quirks, and so forth. Miles is largely a reactionary figure throughout the book as he confronts struggles like registering for a charter school or dealing with family squabbles." [...] Schedeen also opined that [...] "Miles occupies a more urban, racially diverse, and tense landscape. All the story doesn't pander or lean too heavily on elements like racial and economic tension to move forward. Miles is simply a character who <b>speaks</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> slightly different teen experience, and one not nearly as well represented in superhero comics as Peter's". James Hunt of CBR.com rated the issue #1 four and a half out of five stars, lauding Bendis for emphasizing Morales' character and his supporting cast instead of rushing him into costume. The first issue holds a score of 7.8 out of 10 at the review aggregator website Comic Book Roundup, based on 11 reviews, while the final issue, #28, holds a score of 8.3, based on 9 reviews, and the series overall holds an average issue rating of 8.3.|$|E

2500|$|The opening falsetto harmonies {{captured}} the drip-drop {{of rain and}} tears by using a late 1950s doo-wop singing style. That it became a regional favorite is summed up by one journalist who noted that [...] "Maybe it's because although it <b>speaks</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> universal sentimental human experience - romantic heartbreak - it does so with dignity, rather than pour on the sap." [...] Nevetheless, [...] "It's Raining" [...] did not reach any national chart.|$|E
2500|$|Shelby American {{launched}} the new Shelby Super Snake in 2015. Due to the discontinuation of Shelby GT500, the 2015 Super Snake lost its GT500 tag, but {{still have some}} people called it as GT500 Super Snake. Like the 2015 Shelby GT, it is also based on 2015 Ford Mustang GT. The 2015 Super Snake has a 5.0L V8 Shelby/Ford Racing supercharger engine rated at 650+hp (750+hp via Shelby/Whipple Supercharger). Shelby says the test car produces 850 hp at the crank. But the car's 12.3-second, 116-mph quarter-mile run <b>speaks</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> horsepower number far less than 750, let alone 850. A stock Camaro ZL1 is quicker. Tuner cars {{such as this one}} lack SAE-certified horsepower and torque ratings.|$|E
2500|$|Even as Japanese hung Sambo signs {{throughout}} the city, they were undeniably attracted to black music and style. Before hip hop, the Japanese had embraced jazz, rock n roll and funk. It {{is important to}} note however, despite the seemingly racist tendencies toward African Americans and the simultaneous embrace of black culture, the Japanese have a very different construction of racial ideology then the US. Whereas the white versus black dichotomy typifies the racial system in the US, the Japanese construct their identities in terms of nationalism. Rather than identifying strongly with a color, Japanese tradition <b>speaks</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> homogeneous society that places foreigners in the [...] "other category." [...] Because of this context, [...] "jiggers" [...] and the young teens who wear blackface rebel by embracing individual identities that are different from the norm.|$|E

2500|$|In 1977, Năstase {{finished}} no. 9 in the ATP rankings. He was a quarterfinalist at the French Open and at Wimbledon (losing to Borg), {{and participated}} in the WCT Finals. It was during his quarterfinal match at Wimbledon that Năstase had a memorable row with umpire Jeremy Shales. Shales called him [...] "Năstase" [...] when asking him {{to move to the}} advantage court, [...] "like a master <b>speaks</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> naughty schoolboy." [...] (Năstase has also said Shales asked him to pick up a piece of paper that had blown onto the court, saying, [...] "Năstase, pick up that paper.") Năstase angrily replied, [...] "You call me Mr. Năstase!". Since this incident umpires have always used a courtesy title when addressing the players directly.

2500|$|Block and Jöns enter {{a church}} where a fresco of the Dance of Death is being painted. The squire draws a small figure {{representing}} himself, while chiding the artist for colluding {{in the religious}} and ideological fervour {{which has led to}} the disastrous crusade. Still hoping for resolution and comfort within his faith, the knight goes to the confessional where he is joined by Death in the robe of a priest. During confession, Block admits that his life has been futile and without meaning, but that he wants to perform [...] "one meaningful deed". Upon revealing the chess strategy that will save his life, the knight discovers that the priest is Death, who promises to remember the tactics. Leaving the church, the knight <b>speaks</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> young woman (Maud Hansson) who has been condemned to be burned at the stake for consorting with the devil. He believes she will tell him about life beyond death, only to discover a woman beyond her sanity.|$|E
2500|$|Passions {{debuted in}} 1999 with major fanfare. Creator Reilly had been {{credited}} {{for a large}} surge in the ratings for Days of Our Lives years before, thanks to innovative storylines like that of heroine Dr. Marlena Evans being possessed by Satan that drew new viewers, but also tended to alienate stalwart fans. With Passions, Reilly was able {{to start with a}} blank slate and no pre-existing fan base to please. The series replaced the long-running Procter & Gamble-produced serial Another World, which ended a 35-year run in June 1999, on NBC's daytime schedule. [...] In {{the early days of the}} show, Passions heroine Sheridan Crane is identified as a close friend of Diana, Princess of Wales; soon Sheridan recalls speaking to Diana on the phone immediately prior to the 1997 car accident in which Diana was killed. Sheridan also has a similar accident in the same Paris tunnel, and <b>speaks</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> [...] "guardian Angel Diana" [...] who urges her to fight to survive, which drew considerable controversy. Sheridan later adopts the name Diana after a boating accident that results in amnesia.|$|E
