25|$|OBD-II is an {{improvement}} over OBD-I in both capability and standardization. The OBD-II standard specifies the type of diagnostic connector and its pinout, the electrical signalling protocols available, and the messaging format. It also provides a candidate list of vehicle parameters to monitor along with how to encode the data for each. There is a pin in the connector that provides power for the <b>scan</b> <b>tool</b> from the vehicle battery, which eliminates the need to connect a <b>scan</b> <b>tool</b> to a power source separately. However, some technicians might still connect the <b>scan</b> <b>tool</b> to an auxiliary power source to protect data in the unusual event that a vehicle experiences a {{loss of electrical power}} due to a malfunction. Finally, the OBD-II standard provides list of standardized DTCs. As a result of this standardization, a single device can query the on-board computer(s) for these parameters in any vehicle. OBD-II standardization was prompted to simplify diagnosis of increasingly complicated emissions equipment, and though only emission-related codes and data are required to be transmitted through it according to U.S. legislation, most manufacturers have made the OBD-II Data Link Connector the main connector in the vehicle through which all systems are diagnosed and reprogrammed. OBD-II Diagnostic Trouble Codes are 4-digit, preceded by a letter: P for engine and transmission (powertrain), B for body, C for chassis, and U for network. Manufacturers may also add custom data parameters to their specific OBD-II implementation, including real-time data requests as well as trouble codes.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: <b>SCAN</b> <b>tools</b> (Social and Cognitive Awareness and Navigation tools) inform {{participants}} {{about social}} and/or cognitive variables {{with respect to}} a group and its members. This paper describes how <b>SCAN</b> <b>tools</b> facilitate and "institutionalize " the natural processes of becoming aware about social and cognitive variables, thereby leading to adaptive behavior in collaboration. The notion of person-object relations (PORs) is introduced as the basic building block underlying both group awareness and social navigation. Four design principles of <b>SCAN</b> <b>tools</b> (response formatting, juxtaposition, aggregation/transformation, and prediction/recommendation) are discussed, and their application in CSCL scenarios is described. Finally, issues for both practical implications and use-inspired basic research on SCAN mechanisms will be explored...|$|R

2500|$|The {{regulatory}} {{intent of}} OBD-I was to encourage auto manufacturers to design reliable {{emission control systems}} that remain effective for the vehicle's [...] "useful life". The Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTCs) of OBD-I vehicles can usually be found without an expensive 'scan tool'. Each manufacturer used their own diagnostic link connector (DLC), DLC location, DTC definitions, and procedure to read the DTCs from the vehicle. DTCs from OBD-I cars are often read through the blinking patterns of the 'Check Engine Light' (CEL) or 'Service Engine Soon' (SES) light. By connecting certain pins of the diagnostic connector, the 'Check Engine' light will blink out a two-digit number that corresponds to a specific error condition. The DTCs of some OBD-I cars are interpreted in different ways, however. Cadillac (gasoline) fuel-injected vehicles are equipped with actual on-board diagnostics, providing trouble codes, actuator tests and sensor data through the new digital Electronic Climate Control display. Holding down 'Off' and 'Warmer' for several seconds activates the diagnostic mode {{without the need for}} an external <b>scan</b> <b>tool.</b> Some Honda engine computers are equipped with LEDs that light up in a specific pattern to indicate the DTC. General Motors, some 1989–1995 Ford vehicles (DCL), and some 1989–1995 Toyota/Lexus vehicles have a live sensor data stream available, however, many other OBD-I equipped vehicles do not. OBD-I vehicles have fewer DTCs available than for OBD-II equipped vehicles.|$|E
