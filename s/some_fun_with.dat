In this episode, Squidward and SpongeBob are forced to work 24 hours a day by Mr. Krabs, {{so that he can}} get more money. Squidward soon gets bored, and tells SpongeBob a scary story to have <b>some</b> <b>fun</b> <b>with</b> him. After scaring SpongeBob, Squidward tells him that the story is fictional.

25|$|By using tape, I {{could do}} a thirty-five or forty-minute show, then edit {{it down to the}} twenty-six or twenty-seven minutes the program ran. In that way, we could take out jokes, gags, or {{situations}} that didn't play well and finish with only the prime meat of the show; the solid stuff that played big. We could also take out the songs that didn't sound good. It gave us a chance to first try a recording of the songs in the afternoon without an audience, then another one in front of a studio audience. We'd dub the one that came off best into the final transcription. It gave us a chance to ad lib as much as we wanted, knowing that excess ad libbing could be sliced from the final product. If I made a mistake in singing a song or in the script, I could have <b>some</b> <b>fun</b> <b>with</b> it, then retain any of the fun that sounded amusing.|$|E
500|$|Writing in The Times, Peter Millar {{thought that}} [...] "This is vintage Bond, {{in a very}} real sense"; he went on to observe that the central figure was [...] "Bond as Fleming {{abandoned}} him, shortly before his own death". Millar summarised his critique by saying that the novel was a [...] "ripping yarn, but don't take it seriously". Sam Leith, reviewing the novel for The Daily Telegraph thought that Faulks managed to avoid pastiche in his writing of the book, but had <b>some</b> <b>fun,</b> <b>with</b> [...] "crass stuff... being played, of course, for laughs". Leith noted that aside from the more camp elements to the book—of which he approved—"when [...] throttles down and lets the Bond schtick do its own work he soon hits a comfortable cruising speed. Plot Bristol fashion: violent pre-credit sequence; flirtatious exchange with Moneypenny; apprehension mid-snoop; transportation to secret base; villain confessing plans; thwarting of plans; coitus." ...|$|E

500|$|Following script rewrites, Cherry {{pitched the}} series to ABC, who {{picked up the}} pilot. ABC {{executives}} were, however, concerned about {{the title of the}} series, which Cherry had selected before even writing the script. They suggested renaming the series Wisteria Lane or The Secret Lives of Housewives, but Cherry insisted on keeping the original title. He later commented, [...] "I put 'desperate' [...] to try to indicate, however subtly... I'm going to have <b>some</b> <b>fun</b> <b>with</b> the imagery, to take it to some interesting places. Most critics got the joke. Some people see the word 'housewives' and it pushes a button in them and they seem to lose all reason." [...] The project was officially announced on October 23, 2003 as a cross between American Beauty and Knots Landing. While Desperate Housewives, along with fellow new series Grey's Anatomy and Lost, would later help reverse ABC's flagging fortune, network executives Lloyd Braun and Susan Lyne were fired shortly after greenlighting these risky and expensive pilots.|$|E
500|$|Limp Bizkit {{was leading}} ShipRocked 2015 cruise from February 2 to 6. Other bands present were Chevelle, Black Label Society, P.O.D., Sevendust among others. But some {{days before the}} event, Borland took to Instagram to express his discontent, posting a photo of his luggage with a caption reading: [...] "Can't wait to see me some roided out tribal tattooed spray tanned Jell-O shot filled bohunks do their best drunk MMA {{impressions}} in the top deck mosh pit." [...] Speaking to NME, Borland moved to clarify the comments, saying [...] "When I first read {{the description of the}} cruise I realised {{it is what it is}} and I thought I'd have <b>some</b> <b>fun</b> <b>with</b> it...I'll retract everything if I don't see a big muscly frat boy moshing in the pit.

500|$|With {{the season}} reinventing the series again, {{composer}} Bear McCreary expanded {{the sound of}} the score [...] "in a big way". In addition to introducing new themes for the characters of Lash and Rosalind Price, McCreary made some changes to the orchestra: [...] "To represent Lash, I brought in larger percussion: merciless pounding taikos that I digitally compressed and distorted. This new, mangled percussion sound is horrific, and will become increasingly important as the season progresses." [...] McCreary also brought in trombones [...] "to get the scariest sound possible," [...] which resulted in the recording space being reconfigured when they were recorded. For Price, her scenes with Coulson [...] "give the series the feeling of a dense political thriller...I really leaned into that, musically. I introduce light acoustic percussion, mostly egg shakers, to give the pulsing synths a softer edge. And I used an acoustic piano to play the [...] "Rosalind Theme" [...] at key moments in her scenes...her music is meant to add intrigue and suspicion, and simultaneously allow us to have <b>some</b> <b>fun</b> <b>with</b> their witty banter." [...] For [...] "Maveth", McCreary used a 90-piece orchestra rather than the series' typical 50 or 70 players.|$|E

500|$|Upon {{its initial}} release, the song {{received}} mixed reviews from music critics. UKMIX described the song as [...] "quite blissful {{with a smooth}} vocal delivery and some pretty nice lyrics," [...] but despite {{not being able to}} fault the song, the reviewer was unsure that the song was the right choice for the Eurovision Song Contest and predicted that Tyler would suffer the same criticism that Engelbert Humperdinck received the previous year. Robert Copsey from Digital Spy gave the song two stars out of five, stating that the song is a [...] "polar opposite to the slew of Euro-club bangers entering this year's contest," [...] but applaud Tyler for entering the Eurovision Song Contest with the contrasting song. The Guardian held a poll on their website asking the public if they expected Tyler to be successful at Eurovision. The results were fairly even with 46% predicting that Tyler would win and 54% voting that they didn't expect Tyler to win. Ann Gripper from the Daily Mirror described the song as [...] "heartfelt," [...] and {{went on to say that}} Tyler [...] "can still sing." [...] She criticised the songwriters' choice of [...] "above" [...] and [...] "stuff" [...] as the first rhyming lyrics, but noted the line [...] "you never see the rainbow, you just curse the rain" [...] as an improvement, and an opportunity to [...] "have <b>some</b> <b>fun</b> <b>with</b> the staging on finals night in Malmo." [...] Gripper concluded by saying that it [...] "doesn't get into your head like (2012 Sweden winning song) [...] "Euphoria"," [...] and stated that unless the staging is [...] "spectacular", the song won't be remembered by voting time.|$|E
500|$|Harrison Ford reprises {{the role}} of Dr. Henry [...] "Indiana" [...] Jones, Jr. To prepare for the role, the 64-year-old Ford spent {{three hours a day}} at a gym, practiced with the bullwhip for two weeks, and relied on a high-protein diet of fish and vegetables. Ford had kept fit during the series' hiatus anyway, as he hoped for another film. He {{performed}} many of his own stunts because stunt technology had become safer since 1989, and he also felt it improved his performance. It is also said that he still fit into his pants from Raiders of the Lost Ark. He argued, [...] "The appeal of Indiana Jones isn't his youth but his imagination, his resourcefulness. His physicality {{is a big part of}} it, especially the way he gets out of tight situations. But it's not all hitting people and falling from high places. My ambition in action is to have the audience look straight in the face of character and not at the back of a capable stuntman's head. I hope to continue that no matter how old I get." [...] Ford felt his return would reduce U.S. ageism (he refused to dye his hair for the role), because of the film's family appeal: [...] "This is a movie which is geared not to [...] segment of the demographic, an age-defined segment ... We've got a great shot at breaking the movie demographic constraints." [...] He told Koepp to add more references to his age in the script. Spielberg said Ford was not too old to play Indiana: [...] "When a guy gets to be that age and he still packs the same punch, and he still runs just as fast and climbs just as high, he's gonna be breathing a little heavier at the end of the set piece. And I felt, 'Let's have <b>some</b> <b>fun</b> <b>with</b> that. Let's not hide that. Spielberg recalled the line in Raiders that said, [...] "It's not the years, it's the mileage," [...] and felt he could not tell the difference between Ford during the shoots for Last Crusade and Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.|$|E
2500|$|Mark Spitz {{is quoted}} as saying, [...] "When I went to the Olympics, I had every {{intention}} of shaving the moustache off, but I realized I was getting so many comments about it—and everybody was talking about it—that I decided to keep it. [...] I had <b>some</b> <b>fun</b> <b>with</b> a Russian coach who asked me if my moustache slowed me down. [...] I said, 'No, {{as a matter of}} fact, it deflects water away from my mouth, allows my rear end to rise and make me bullet-shaped in the water, and that's what had allowed me to swim so great.' [...] He's translating {{as fast as he can}} for the other coaches, and the following year every Russian male swimmer had a moustache." ...|$|E

50|$|Doescher {{claims to}} be only a Star Wars and Star Trek fan and not well versed in other science-fiction literature.

2500|$|Durham Dynamos {{recorded}} {{their first}} win of their Twenty20 campaign with a last-over six-wicket win at Riverside. Mark Ealham had <b>some</b> <b>fun</b> <b>with</b> Durham bowler Neil Killeen as he thumped six sixes in a 17-ball 45, and his 73-run partnership with Chris Read threatened to lift Nottinghamshire Outlaws {{to a much}} bigger score than their final 179, as they were 154 for 5 midway through the 18th over. However, four wickets in two overs from Jamaican-born Gareth Breese helped set them back, although Will Smith hit two fours in a six-ball 13. In reply, Nathan Astle and Gordon Muchall both made 64 - the latter a not out - and Ealham was smashed about, conceding 51 runs in four overs. [...] Andrew Harris conceded runs at an even higher rate, with 38 off 15 legitimate deliveries as Benkenstein took runs off him and Durham won with three balls to spare.|$|E

5000|$|Another {{focus for}} {{criticism}} of the organization has been {{a photograph of the}} three founders holding weapons and posing with armed members of the SPLA. Invisible Children responded on their website with founder Jason Russell explaining that it was a joke photo taken at the 2008 Juba Peace Talks in the Democratic Republic of Congo that would have been [...] "funny to bring back to our friends and family". Glenna Gordon, the photographer who took the picture, is not associated with the organization and was on assignment for the Associated Press at the time. Gordon explained the context of the photograph as the Invisible Children founders being bored at the stalled peace talks and deciding to have <b>some</b> <b>fun</b> posing <b>with</b> weapons and SPLA members.

500|$|Eric Goldman of IGN Movies {{gave the}} film {{two out of}} five stars. He was unhappy with the little screen time Bell and Elwes had been given, saying that the time the film did spend with them didn't have much impact. He said the traps were a step down from Saw VI, but did point out his {{favorite}} and highlight of the film as the [...] "garage trap". About the film's 3D effects, Goldman said [...] "The 3D is used {{as you might expect}} it to be – which is to say, this is no James Cameron immersive experience. Instead, blades jut out of the screen, and there is <b>some</b> <b>fun</b> had <b>with</b> blood and guts literally shooting forward at several points". [...] Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter gave the film a mixed review. He said Saw 3D is [...] "consistent both stylistically and thematically with previous editions", but said most of the film's traps lack the [...] "Rube Goldberg-style cleverness that marked the series". [...] Scheck {{went on to say that}} it was [...] "unfortunate" [...] the creators killed Bell's character so early in the series and called Mandylor's character (Hoffman) an [...] "exceedingly bland stand-in".

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this session today is not to bemoan the {{fragmentation}} of television and film. I {{love the fact that}} we all get to watch what we want, when we want it. The world is very different than at the time of Baha’u’llah, when real live people sat together around a real live fire and told stories to each other. The purpose of today is to examine and help recognize some of the story constructs that audiences – that is to say, entire cultures – now consider normal. We have, in fact, had our brains trained to respond to media and story in a certain way. And I would pose, that our media savvy and media programmed brains are applying these constructs across the board in ways that we are yet to understand. I propose that we pay attention to this – because these constructs are changing the way that audiences, in the western developed world at least, interface with us, Baha’is both when we communicate and tell our stories as an ‘organisation’.

The characters on the island had some moments, especially Hook, but it looks like the real action will happen next week." [...] She also commented highly on Ariel's return, saying [...] "JoAnna Garcia continues to be a bright spot as Ariel and she and Belle working together could kill audiences with adorableness. Ariel hits the exact innocent note you'd expect, making me just want to pinch her cheeks repeatedly. Her optimism and spunk is infectious. Plus, Ariel pairs well with Belle - both as actors and as characters;" [...] though was a little more critical on the episode's effects, saying [...] " [...] the effects in [...] "Dark Hollow" [...] weren't bad. The red lighting effectively communicated the creepy vibe, and the shadows looked menacing. The creatures were a little rough around the edges but only a bit. And since they’re fantasy shadows, it worked okay. Since this episode only had a few of the horrible digital backgrounds, it gets extra points from me." ...|$|R

Theron Martin also from ANN described it as [...] "essentially a complement to a like-named card game aimed at teen and preteen girls". ANN's Carlo Santos agreed about it's a commercial-like anime, but also criticized the animation, saying the [...] "quality is barely enough to get by, and the character designs look oddly outdated." [...] Carl Kimlinger's opinion was less negative as he said Aikatsu! [...] "isn't terrible by any stretch, but it doesn't make even a desultory effort to differentiate itself from the dozens of other shows that use aspiring idols to sell games and figurines and god knows what else" [...] and that [...] "character designs also have a lovely shōjo flavor, and the whole series looks just as pink and pretty as can be." [...] He finished telling it will be [...] "a highly tolerable diversion" [...] for those who like this kind of anime.|$|R
