Allen Ginsberg states that, in a private conversation in 1967, Pound told the young poet, [...] "my poems don't make sense." [...] He {{went on to say}} that he [...] "was not a lunatic, but a moron", and to characterize his writing as [...] "stupid and ignorant", [...] "a mess".

Shubha Shetty-Saha of Mid Day reviewed, [...] "Vidya Balan, a fine actress with {{thousand}} emotions fleeting across her lovely face, has <b>shown</b> <b>us</b> what she's capable of in her earlier movies.

Vidya next took {{on the part of a}} police officer in Te3n (2016), a thriller inspired by the 2013 South Korean film Montage, co-starring Amitabh Bachchan and Nawazuddin Siddiqui. She was attracted to the idea of playing a [...] "no-nonsense police inspector who commands much respect" [...] and was particularly drawn to her character's [...] "silent aggression". NDTV's Saibal Chatterjee criticised the decision to bill Vidya's pivotal role as a special appearance and noted how much her presence benefited the film. Rajeev Masand was critical of the film's predictable denouement, but wrote that Vidya [...] "is reliably solid each time she’s on screen, raising her brow, curling her lip to effectively communicate more than words can". She then portrayed the actress Geeta Bali in multiple songs for Ekk Albela, a Marathi language biopic of the actor-director Bhagwan Dada.|$|E
