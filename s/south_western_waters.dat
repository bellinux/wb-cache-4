40|$|The 2002 Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) reform {{introduced}} {{a set of}} novelty bodies, the Regional Advisory Councils (RACs) to enhance stakeholder involvement and correct one of the policy’s primary deficiencies, its lack of legitimacy, arising in part from low stakeholder involvement. Based on an analytical study of the <b>South</b> <b>Western</b> <b>Waters</b> RAC (SWWRAC), this thesis illuminates the current capacities and limitations linked to the governance process of the <b>South</b> <b>Western</b> <b>Waters</b> through a governability assessment. Stakeholder participation in the CFP {{is seen as a}} precondition to guarantee legitimacy to the regulatory measures aimed at achieving sustainable fisheries in EU waters. This study illustrates the importance of critical examination of stakeholders’ experiences and expectations and what they imply for the governance of the RACs...|$|E

40|$|Since {{the reform}} of the EU Common Fisheries Policy in 2002, effort {{has been devoted to}} {{addressing}} the governance, scientific, social and economic issues required to introduce an ecosystem approach to fisheries management (EAFM) in Europe. Fisheries management needs to support the three pillars of sustainability (ecological, social and economic) and Fisheries Ecosystem Plans (FEPs) have been developed as a tool to assist managers considering the ecological, social and economic implications of their decision. Building upon previous studies (e. g. the FP 5 -funded European Fisheries Ecosystem Plan project), the core concept of the Making the European Fisheries Ecosystem Plan Operational (MEFEPO) project is to deliver operational frameworks (FEPs) for three regional seas. The project focus is on how best to make current institutional frameworks responsive to an EAFM at regional and pan-European levels in accordance with the principles of good governance. The regional seas selected for the project are the North Sea (NS), North Western Waters (NWW) and <b>South</b> <b>Western</b> <b>Waters</b> (SWW) RAC regions. The aim of this work package (WP 5) was to develop operational objectives to achieve the ecological objectives identified for the 3 regional seas in WP 2. This report describes {{the development and implementation of}} a transparent and formal process that should lead to identification of the “best” operational management strategies for an EAFM, based on sound scientific information and stakeholder involvement (e. g. regional industry groups, citizen groups, managers and other interest groups) ...|$|E

40|$|Ocean {{dynamics}} {{is affected}} by atmospheric conditions. Surface wind is one of atmospheric variables that has {{an important role in}} the ocean dynamics. This study was conducted to determine impacts of extreme weather on sea surface temperature in the <b>western</b> <b>waters</b> of Sumatera and the southern waters of Java in June 2016. Daily surface wind (2007 - 2016), sea surface temperature (1987 - 2016), sea wave height (1 - 10 June 2016) and surface current (1994 - 2016) were analyzed using anomaly analysis to assess the impact of surface winds on surface ocean. The result showed that in June 2016 extreme weather occurred in these waters that was characterized by sea wave height reached 2. 6 m. Impacts of extreme weather in these waters cause upwelling intensity weakened that was marked by increase of sea surface temperature. The increases of sea surface temperature in the middle to north of <b>western</b> <b>waters</b> of Sumatera reached 0. 9 OC, in the middle to <b>south</b> of <b>western</b> <b>waters</b> of Sumatera reached 1. 8 OC and in the southern waters of Java reached 1. 6 OC...|$|R

40|$|Today, deep waters {{produced}} in the North Atlantic are exported through the <b>western</b> <b>South</b> Atlantic. Antarctic intermediate water (AAIW) also enters the Atlantic in this region. Circumpolar deep water (CDW) fills the depths below AAIW and above and below northern source waters. A depth transect of cores from 1567 - 3909 m water depth in the <b>western</b> <b>South</b> Atlantic are ideally located to monitor inter-ocean exchange of deep water, and variations in the relative strength of northern versus southern source water production. Last glacial maximum (LGM) Cd/Ca and 813 C data indicate a nutrient-depleted intermediate-depth water mass. In the mid-depth <b>western</b> <b>South</b> Atlantic, a simple conversion of LGM 813 C data suggests significantly less nutrient enrichment than LGM Cd/Ca ratios, but Cd/Ca and 613 C data can be reconciled when plotted in CdW/ 13 C space. Paired LGM Cd/Ca and S 13 C data from mid-depth cores suggest increasingly nutrient rich waters below 2000 m, but do not require an increase in Southern Ocean water contribution relative to today. Cd/Ca data suggest no glacial-interglacial change in the hydrography of the deepest waters of the region. To maintain relatively low Cd/Ca ratios (low nutrients) in the deepest <b>western</b> <b>South</b> Atlantic <b>waters,</b> and in CDW in general, during the LGM requires an increased supply of nutrient-depleted glacial North Atlantic intermediate water (GNAIW) and/or nutrient-depleted glacial Subantarctic surface waters to CDW to balance reduced NADW contribution to CDW. LGM Cd/Ca and 513 C data suggest strong GNAIW influence in the <b>western</b> <b>South</b> Atlantic which in turn implies export of GNAIW from the Atlantic, and entrainment of GNAIW into the Antarctic Circumpolar current. by Michael Horowitz.
