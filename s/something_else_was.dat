60|$|What that <b>something</b> <b>else</b> <b>was</b> to be was not clear. He {{moved from}} one branch to another to investigate, then a thought struck him, and he {{resolved}} to act upon it.|$|E

60|$|Half a mile {{further on}} she looked {{round in the}} faint hope {{that it might have}} {{recovered}} itself and followed. But no mare was to be seen. <b>Something</b> <b>else</b> <b>was</b> to be seen, however, for there, three or four miles away upon the plain behind them, easy to be distinguished in that dazzling air, were a number of black spots that occasionally seemed to sparkle.|$|E
6000|$|His {{companion}} {{considered the}} matter dispassionately, as an abstract proposition. Here was a man, who {{in return for}} certain information respecting the whereabouts of a marketable commodity had undertaken to find and share it with his informant. The commodity had proved to be valueless, but during the search for it he had incidentally discovered <b>something</b> <b>else.</b> <b>Was</b> he under any obligation to share the latter with his informant's heirs? ...|$|E
60|$|However, to {{find the}} shell thus left on her hands was no slight perplexity. Should she, as eldest {{daughter}} left in charge, demand the desk, Barbara would produce her reasons for its abstraction, and for this Janet was not prepared. Unless <b>something</b> <b>else</b> <b>was</b> wanted from it, so as to put Babie in the wrong, Janet saw {{no alternative but to}} secure the book in her own bureau, and watch for a chance of smuggling it back.|$|E
60|$|This is {{our first}} theory. Let us try to verify it, as {{scientific}} men are {{in the habit of}} doing, by saying, If that <b>be</b> true, then <b>something</b> <b>else</b> <b>is</b> likely to be true too.|$|R
50|$|Whether {{or not the}} Sicambri spoke a Germanic or Celtic language, or <b>something</b> <b>else,</b> <b>is</b> not certain, {{because they}} lived in the {{so-called}} Nordwestblock zone where these two language families came into contact and were both influential.|$|R
5000|$|One {{mistake is}} [...] "message-hunting" [...] - [...] looking {{only for a}} {{profitable}} statement or idea in a poem. A short prose statement can work better than a poem for communicating advice. <b>Something</b> <b>else</b> <b>is</b> at work in poetry.|$|R
60|$|<b>Something</b> <b>else</b> <b>was</b> {{sometimes}} to be watched. Martyn, all this time, {{was doing the}} work of two curates, and was to be seen walking home with Anne from church or school, carrying her baskets and bags, and, as we were given to understand, discussing by turns ecclesiastical questions, visionary sisterhoods, and naughty children. At first I wished it were possible to remove Clarence from the perpetual spectacle, but we had one last talk over the matter, and this was quite satisfactory.|$|E
60|$|And in {{the shelter}} of the padded or {{thatched}} hurdles, by the hedge-side, old Nance spent her days keeping guard over the turnips, and afterwards <b>something</b> <b>else</b> <b>was</b> found for her to do, and in the meanwhile she lodged in Caleb's cottage and became like one of the family. She was fond of the children and of the dog, and Watch became so much attached to her that {{had it not been for}} his duties with the flock he would have attended her all day in the fields to help her with the crows.|$|E
60|$|He {{admitted}} that the reward was offered for bringing the horns and tail, not for killing the monster. But were the king's intentions to go for nothing? When a subject only meant well, {{of course he had}} to suffer; but when a king said one thing, was he not to be supposed to have meant another? Any fellow with a waggon could bring the horns and tail; the difficult thing was to kill the monster. If Benson's claim was allowed, the royal prerogative of saying one thing and meaning <b>something</b> <b>else</b> <b>was</b> in danger.|$|E
50|$|In response, a {{government}} agency, the Special Security Force, is formed {{with the ability}} to act outside the law. However, when the Red May suddenly find themselves being wiped out, the force discovers that <b>something</b> <b>else</b> <b>is</b> hunting the terrorists.|$|R
50|$|<b>Something</b> <b>Else</b> <b>is</b> {{the third}} studio album by R&B singer Robin Thicke, {{released}} on September 30, 2008. It is a follow up to Thicke's highly successful second album The Evolution of Robin Thicke and features a guest appearance by Lil Wayne.|$|R
50|$|Using {{data from}} the SAEE (which {{includes}} measures for ideology, income, job security, and other measures), Caplan simulates what people would believe {{if they had the}} same circumstances as economists, a technique often used in political science called “enlightened preferences”. If the ideological and self-serving biases are true, most of the difference between the “enlightened public” and economists should disappear. If, however, the enlightened public is not much closer to economists, then <b>something</b> <b>else</b> <b>is</b> going on, as those explanations have been neutralized. Caplan believes that that <b>something</b> <b>else</b> <b>is</b> the biases he enumerated earlier. The data tends to support Caplan’s argument, with most (but not all) of the enlightened public closer to economists than to the public.|$|R

[...] Of course there was something else, and of course Lady Altringham knew what that <b>something</b> <b>else</b> <b>was.</b> She demanded, in accordance with her scheme, that George should lose no time. This was in May. It was known that Sir Harry intended to leave town early in June. [...] "Of course you will take him at his word, and go to Humblethwaite when you leave us," [...] she had said.|$|E
60|$|Prince Prigio was {{now called}} on to speak. He {{admitted}} that the reward was offered for bringing the horns and tail, not for killing the monster. But were the king's intentions to go for nothing? When a subject only meant well, {{of course he had}} to suffer; but when a king said one thing, was he not to be supposed to have meant another? Any fellow with a waggon could bring the horns and tail; the difficult thing was to kill the monster.

60|$|And then, {{across the}} river, {{away into the}} northeast, I saw {{for the first time}} the mystery of smoke. It was the biggest animal I had ever seen. I thought it was a monster snake, up-ended, rearing its head high above the trees and swaying back and forth. And yet, somehow, I seemed to gather from the conduct of the Folk that the smoke itself was not the danger. They {{appeared}} to fear it as the token of something else. What this <b>something</b> <b>else</b> <b>was</b> I was unable to guess. Nor could they tell me. Yet I was soon to know, and I was to know it as a thing more terrible than the Tawny One, than old Saber-Tooth, than the snakes themselves, than which it seemed there could be no things more terrible.|$|E
60|$|These {{speeches of}} Mr. Davis were not long in {{reaching}} Sherman. He {{took advantage of}} the information they gave, and made all the preparation possible for him to make to meet what now became expected, attempts to break his communications. <b>Something</b> <b>else</b> had to <b>be</b> done: and to Sherman's sensible and soldierly mind the idea was not long in dawning upon him, not only that <b>something</b> <b>else</b> had to <b>be</b> done, but what that <b>something</b> <b>else</b> should <b>be.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{significance}} level α is the threshold for p below which the experimenter assumes {{the null hypothesis}} <b>is</b> false, and <b>something</b> <b>else</b> <b>is</b> going on.

60|$|As {{they were}} riding on to Havant it {{occurred}} to Mr. Hoopdriver in a transitory manner that the interview had been quite other than his expectation. But {{that was the way}} with everything in Mr. Hoopdriver's experience. And though his Wisdom looked grave within him, and Caution was chinking coins, and an ancient prejudice in favour of Property shook her head, <b>something</b> <b>else</b> <b>was</b> there too, shouting in his mind to drown all these saner considerations, the intoxicating thought of riding beside Her all to-day, all to-morrow, perhaps for other days after that. Of talking to her familiarly, being brother of all her slender strength and freshness, of having a golden, real, and wonderful time beyond all his imaginings. His old familiar fancyings gave place to anticipations as impalpable and fluctuating and beautiful as the sunset of a summer day.|$|E
60|$|Was {{this some}} new {{encroachment}} upon his rights and his liberties? He was puzzled and, like all lions, being short of temper, he was irritated. He had not minded {{it when the}} Tarmangani squatted upon the verge of the pit and looked down upon him, for had not this Tarmangani fed him? But now <b>something</b> <b>else</b> <b>was</b> afoot and the suspicion of the wild beast was aroused. As he watched, however, Numa saw the stakes rise slowly to an erect position, tumble against each other and then fall backwards out of his sight upon {{the surface of the}} ground above. Instantly the lion grasped the possibilities of the situation, and, too, perhaps he sensed the fact that the man-thing had deliberately opened a way for his escape. Seizing the remains of Bara in his great jaws, Numa, the lion, leaped agilely from the pit of the Wamabos and Tarzan of the Apes melted into the jungles to the east.|$|E
60|$|Mordecai {{knew that}} the nameless {{stranger}} was to come and redeem his ring; and, in spite of contrary chances, the wish {{to see him again}} was growing into a belief that he should see him. In the January weeks, he felt an increasing agitation of that subdued hidden quality which hinders nervous people from any steady occupation on the eve of an anticipated change. He could not go on with his printing of Hebrew on little Jacob's mind; or with his attendance at a weekly club, which was another effort of the same forlorn hope: <b>something</b> <b>else</b> <b>was</b> coming. The one thing he longed for was to get as far as the river, which he could do but seldom and with difficulty. He yearned with a poet's yearning for the wide sky, the far-reaching vista of bridges, the tender and fluctuating lights on the water which seems to breathe with a life that can shiver and mourn, be comforted and rejoice.|$|E
50|$|Philosophic value may {{be split}} into {{instrumental}} value and intrinsic values. An instrumental value is worth having {{as a means}} towards getting <b>something</b> <b>else</b> that <b>is</b> good (e.g., a radio is instrumentally good in order to hear music). An intrinsically valuable thing is worth for itself, not {{as a means to}} <b>something</b> <b>else.</b> It <b>is</b> giving value intrinsic and extrinsic properties.|$|R
