Box, a large siren that was sold by the Hendie & Bolthoff Mfg. and Supply Co. as early as 1915 until the early 1920s. These sirens used a centrifugal clutch connected to a 5 HP motor, usually General Electric. These distinctive sirens had one or two large, open-ended, double sided, 20-port rotors connected by a long shaft to the motor and mounted to a common horizontal frame. single head models were known as the [...] "Duplex" [...] and double head models were known as [...] "Quadruplex". Two smaller models were also available, connected directly to a <b>single</b> <b>phase</b> <b>motor,</b> the small double 12 port Type A or the slightly larger double 20 port Type B. Sometime in the early 1920s, Sterling Fire Alarm of Rochester NY. Sold {{a variant of the}} Denver siren under the name [...] "Sterling Siren Fire Alarm", and produced them for s short while. These models have a window-frame grill bolted to the stator, most likely to keep birds from nesting in the rotor. Due to their weight, (the largest being nearly 6 feet long and 2 feet wide, made completely of iron with bronze or aluminum rotors on the Sterling models grossing near 2000 lbs) they were usually mounted on top of high buildings rather than poles. An article from [...] "Electrical Review and Western Electrician" [...] once stated when tested, local official departments received calls from several miles away by people wondering what the cause of the noise was.

40|$|Thesis (Masters Diploma (Heavy Current)) [...] Cape Technikon, 1991 Linear {{induction}} motors {{are built}} for numerous applications. Their robustness, gearfree-link to the load {{and the fact}} that speed is not a function of the number of poles (as in round machines) are only a few advantages. As every <b>single</b> <b>phase</b> <b>motor</b> needs some starting aid, so does a linear induction drive. For round machines, capacitors or shaded poles are usually used. A capacitor can be damaged electrically, which is a rare occurrence for shading rings. A useful combination of these advantages is a linear induction motor which is gearless and uses the shaded pole principle as a starting aid. In order to simplify the designing process, a computer program (Fortran) was written. The main objective on the electrical side was to obtain low input power, high power factor and high efficiency.

40|$|The {{number of}} {{brushless}} DC (BLDC) motor applications has increased significantly, essentially due to reduced costs of semiconductors and permanent magnets, {{but also because}} of the emergence of new control strategies, such as closed-loop and sensorless control. Among the different electric drives, the heating circulation pump is a typical application which could greatly benefits from new BLDC technologies. Nowadays, the majority of low power heating circulation pumps is driven by AC induction motors. Despite of its low efficiency (< 20 % for a <b>single</b> <b>phase</b> <b>motor</b> and < 50 % for a three phase motor), this kind of motor is still used widely, because of its inherent simplicity since no electronic driver is needed. When a regulation is necessary (for example pressure, flow regulation), this advantage disappears. The aim of this work is a systematic analysis of the circulating pump motor. One solution is investigated in particular: the pump with a sealed BLDC motor. The following points are analysed in details: An analytical method to calculate the flux density distribution is tailored for motors with an important gap, as the sealed motors or slotless motors. The analysis of the electromagnetic characteristics for brushless DC motors shows the similarity of the various brushless DC motors. The calculation of tube losses determines their influence on the energetic balance of the motor. The determination of the acoustical motor noise shows the influence of the different modes of phases switching. The thermal aspects which take into account the motor environment are examined from the theoretical and practical point of view. The synthesis of these points results in a concept for the design and optimisation of BLDC motors; a series of pump prototype have been designed. For the heating circulation pump, the replacement of the AC induction motor with a brushless DC motor makes it possible to double the global installation efficiency. This solution is very promising from an energising aspect as well as an economical one and contributes to electrical energy savings, essential in this end of century...|$|E

Generator has {{one or more}} machine elements that turn with the shaft - e. g. bearings, rotors. In a perfectly balanced machine, all rotors run on their true centre-line and forces are equal. Rotor imbalance will generally be present due to uneven weight distribution or due to the imbalance between generated lift and gravity.

Vibration profile that results from motion {{is the result of}} a force imbalance - there is always some imbalance in real-world applications. All mechanical equipment in motion generates a vibration profile, or signature, that reflect sits operating condition. Many vibrations are normal for rotating or moving machinery, e. g. normal rotation of shafts and other rotors, contact with bearings etc. Synchronous Generator faults such as mechanical misalignments, rotor imbalance, loose bolts, bearing faults and incipient metal fatigues cause to generate abnormal identifiable vibrations. In the research, First, the relationship between the generator mechanical faults and the vibration harmonic magnitudes are studied for particular machine problems occur previously and for that analysis the critical frequencies in the frequency spectrum of the synchronous generators are identified by using the Microlog instrument CMVA 60, which is a property of the Mahaweli Complex of Ceylon Electricity Board.
