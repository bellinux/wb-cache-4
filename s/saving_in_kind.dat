40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} how attitudes {{to health and}} exercise in connection with cycling influence the estimation of values of travel time <b>savings</b> <b>in</b> different <b>kinds</b> of bicycle environments (mixed traffic, bicycle lane in the road way, bicycle path next to the road, and bicycle path not {{in connection with the}} road). The results, based on two Swedish stated choice studies, suggest that the values of travel time savings are lower when cycling in better conditions. Surprisingly, the respondents do not consider cycling on a path next to the road worse than cycling on a path not in connection to the road, indicating that they do not take traffic noise and air pollution into account in their decision to cycle. No difference can be found between cycling on a road way (mixed traffic) and cycling in a bicycle lane in the road way. The results also indicate that respondents that include health aspects in their choice to cycle have lower value of travel time savings for cycling than respondents that state that health aspects are of less importance, at least when cycling on a bicycle path. The appraisals of travel time savings regarding cycling also differ a lot depending on the respondents’ alternative travel mode. The individuals who stated that they will take the car if they do not cycle have a much higher valuation of travel time savings than the persons stating public transport as the main alternative to cycling...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of specific tools for the audit of air-conditioning systems {{is described in}} a companion paper. These developments are {{carried out in the}} frame of the HarmonAC project launched in 2007 in order to assist the implementation of the EPBD, article 9. The {{development of}} these tools was continously supported by the application to case studies. This paper reports on the application of the tools within an audit procedure applied to a typical office building in Belgium, which is in operation for more than 20 years. The first step of the work consisted in analyzing the current performance of the building which proved to point out a number of problems in the operation of the building. As it is not rarely the case for running office buildings, these problems were {{due to a lack of}} commissioning and a progressive decrease of the performances due to a poor management. Application of the first stage “Benchmark” tool to this building led to a very high discrepancy between the measured consumptions and the calculated ones. This appeared mainly for the electricity consumption but also for the gas consumption. Calibration of the simulation tool, mainly by representing more exactly the management of the building and the real internal gains improved the accuracy of the calculations to a large extent. After calibration of the building and HVAC model, the application of a second tool (SimAudit) allowed to evaluate the savings obtained by the implementation of a number of Energy Conservation Opportunities (ECOs). In this case, the dominant ECOs were in relation with the operation of the building: change of schedules, modification of setpoints; implementation of free-cooling strategies; provision of heat recovery and move to reversibility of the chillers. Reasonable estimates of the savings can be obtained following the calibration/simulation process. The paper will highlight some of the most relevant ECOs and provide an order of magnitude for the <b>savings</b> <b>in</b> this <b>kind</b> of building and in a mild climate. Peer reviewe...|$|R
5000|$|The Internal Revenue Code {{provides}} for a foreign earned income exclusion allowing non-resident U.S. tax filers to exclude wage income {{up to a certain}} threshold ($99,400 for the 2013 tax filing season) from U.S. taxation, as well as credits for taxes paid to other countries. The result is that accidental Americans often do not owe U.S. income tax, but must spend thousands of dollars in accounting fees to prove that fact, and face potential fines {{of tens of thousands of}} dollars for paperwork errors. The reason is that the foreign earned income exclusion does not affect filing obligations nor the treatment of non-U.S bank accounts and investment plans. Tax lawyers state that compliance with the foreign trust and passive foreign investment company rules can be particularly onerous, because their definitions are so broad as to include mutual funds, retirement accounts, and similar such structures owned by accidental Americans in their country of residence; people with <b>savings</b> <b>in</b> these <b>kinds</b> of plans will face higher taxes and compliance burdens than U.S. residents who keep money in similar U.S. investment plans. Those who have spent their lives planning for their retirement without considering the U.S. tax consequences of the non-U.S. financial instruments they hold may find that U.S. taxation, in particular PFIC taxation, wipes out most of their returns on investments; as Allison Christians states, [...] "the PFIC regime is designed to be so harsh that no one would ever knowingly own one unless they were treating it like a partnership, and marking it to market annually with the assistance of sophisticated tax counsel". Even Canada's Registered Disability Savings Plan falls under such reporting requirements. Under the 2011 Offshore Voluntary Disclosure Initiative, people residing outside of the U.S. who stated that they did not file U.S. tax and asset-reporting forms because they were unaware of their U.S. citizenship faced fines of 5% of their assets.|$|R

6000|$|... "In Oliver Cromwell's time, {{it used to}} be said, 'With Spain, in Europe, {{there may}} be peace or war; but between the Tropics it is always war.' A state of things well {{recognized}} by Oliver, and acted on, according to his opportunities. No settlement was had in Oliver's brief time; nor could any be got since, when it was becoming yearly more pressing. Bucaniers, desperate naval gentlemen living on BOUCAN, or hung beef; who are also called Flibustiers (FLIBUTIERS, 'Freebooters,' in French pronunciation, which is since grown strangely into FILIBUSTERS, Fillibustiers, and other mad forms, in the Yankee Newspapers now current): readers have heard of those dumb methods of protest. Dumb and furious; which could bring no settlement; but which did astonish the Pope's Decree, slashing it with cutlasses and sea-cannon, in that manner, and circuitously forwarded a settlement. Settlement was becoming yearly more needful: and, ever since the Treaty of Utrecht especially, there had been an incessant haggle going on, to produce one; without the least effect hitherto. What embassyings, bargainings, bargain-breakings; what galloping of estafettes; acres of diplomatic paper, now fallen to the spiders, who always privately were the real owners! Not in the Treaty of Utrecht, not in the Congresses of Cambray, of Soissons, Convention of Pardo, by Ripperda, Horace Walpole, or the wagging of wigs, could this matter be settled at all. Near two hundred years of chronic misery;--and had there been, under any of those wigs, a Head capable of reading the Heavenly Mandates, with heart capable of following them, the misery might have been briefly ended, by a direct method. With what immense <b>saving</b> <b>in</b> all <b>kinds,</b> compared with the oblique method gone upon! In quantity of bloodshed needed, of money, of idle talk and estafettes, not to speak of higher considerations, the saving had been incalculable. For it was England's one Cause of War during the Century we are now upon; and poor England's course, when at last driven into it, went ambiguously circling round the whole Universe, instead of straight to the mark. Had Oliver Cromwell lived ten years longer;--but Oliver Cromwell did not live; and, instead of Heroic Heads, there came in Constitutional Wigs, which makes a great difference.|$|R

This article analyzes the determinants of private <b>saving</b> <b>in</b> Sub-Saharan Africa, seeking to explain the region's dismal performance and identify poli-cies that could help to reverse the region's decline <b>in</b> <b>saving.</b> The analysis shows that in Sub-Saharan Africa causality runs from growth to investment (and perhaps to private saving), whereas a rise m the saving rate Granger-causes an increase in investment. For-eign aid Granger-causes a reduction <b>in</b> both <b>saving</b> and investment, and investment also Granger-causes an increase in foreign aid. The empirical analysis of private <b>saving</b> <b>in</b> Sub-Saharan Africa and other regions over 1970 - 95 suggests that private <b>saving</b> <b>in</b> Africa {{can be explained by}} standard behavioral models. According to these models private <b>saving</b> <b>in</b> Africa lags behind that in other regions (most notably, the high performing Asian econo-mies) because of the region's lower per capita income, high young-age dependency ratio, and high dependence on aid.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to investigate the determinants of domestic <b>saving</b> <b>in</b> Ethiopia using time series annual data form 1969 / 70 - 2010 / 11. In this study, both qualitative explanations and econometric analysis are used. The qualitative (descriptive) part of the analysis shows that average domestic <b>saving</b> <b>in</b> Ethiopia was low and continuously falling. In the econometric analysis, effort has been made to identify the long run and short run determinants of domestic <b>saving</b> <b>in</b> Ethiopia using Johnson Maximum Likelihood co-integration test and Vector error correction mechanism (VECM). Estimated results reveal that growth rate of GDP, government consumption and foreign aid are statistically significant long run determinants of domestic <b>saving</b> <b>in</b> Ethiopia. On the other hand, deposit interest rate, dependency ratio, and financial depth are found to be insignificant determinants. However, in the short run, all the explanatory variables included in this study do not have statistically significant meaning <b>in</b> explaining domestic <b>saving</b> <b>in</b> Ethiopia. The speed of adjustment has value 0. 585743 with negative sign, which shows the convergence of saving model towards long run equilibrium. By considering the significant as well as insignificant but very important variables to enhance domestic saving: Sustainable economic growth, increasing private sector participation as well as selective privatization of government owned institutions, expansion of financial intermediaries and creating competitive environment in the financial sector are suggested to improve domestic <b>saving</b> <b>in</b> Ethiopia.
