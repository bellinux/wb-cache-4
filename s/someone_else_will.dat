The progressive ophthalmoplegia is often unnoticed till decreased ocular motility limits peripheral vision.

All directions of gaze are affected; however, downward gaze appears to be best spared.

The {{findings suggest that}} in the case of an emergency, when people believe that there are other people around, they are less likely or slower to help a victim because they believe <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> <b>will</b> take responsibility. People may also fail to take responsibility for a situation depending on the context. They may assume that other bystanders are more qualified to help, such as doctors or police officers, and that their intervention would be unneeded. They may also be afraid of being superseded by a superior helper, offering unwanted assistance, or facing the legal consequences of offering inferior and possibly dangerous assistance.

6000|$|The last notable {{works of}} Thackeray are like afterthoughts. The Virginians {{continues}} {{the story of}} Colonel Esmond, and The Newcomes recounts the later fortunes of Arthur Pendennis. The Virginians has two or three splendid scenes, and some critics regard The Newcomes as the finest expression of the author's genius; but both works, {{which appeared in the}} leisurely form of monthly instalments, are too languid in action for sustained interest. We grow acquainted with certain characters, and are heartily glad when they make their exit; perhaps <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> <b>will</b> come, some adventurer from the road or the inn, to relieve the dullness. The door opens, and in comes the bore again to take another leave. That is realism, undoubtedly; and Laura Pendennis is as realistic as the mumps, which one may catch a second time. The atmosphere of both novels--indeed, of all Thackeray's greater works, with the exception of English Humorists and The Four Georges--is rather depressing. One gets the impression that life among [...] "the quality" [...] is a dreary experience, hardly worth the effort of living.|$|E

[...] She pushed him outward with her through the door [...] And shut it after her. [...] "Be kind," [...] she said. [...] She took the market things from Warren's arms [...] And set them on the porch, then drew him down [...] To sit {{beside her on the}} wooden steps. [...] "When was I ever {{anything}} but kind to him? [...] But I'll not have the fellow back," [...] he said. [...] "I told him so last haying, didn't I? [...] 'If he left then,' I said, 'that ended it.' [...] What good is he? Who else will harbour him [...] At his age for the little he can do? [...] What help he is there's no depending on. [...] Off he goes always when I need him most. [...] 'He thinks he ought to earn a little pay, [...] Enough at least to buy tobacco with, [...] So he won't have to beg and be beholden.' [...] 'All right,' I say, 'I can't afford to pay [...] Any fixed wages, though I wish I could.' [...] 'Someone else can.' 'Then <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> <b>will</b> have to.' [...] I shouldn't mind his bettering himself [...] If that was what it was. You can be certain, [...] When he begins like that, there's someone at him [...] Trying to coax him off with pocket-money,-- [...] In haying time, when any help is scarce. [...] In winter he comes back to us. I'm done." [...] "Sh! not so loud: he'll hear you," [...] Mary said. [...] "I want him to: he'll have to soon or late." [...] "He's worn out. He's asleep beside the stove. [...] When I came up from Rowe's I found him here, [...] Huddled against the barn-door fast asleep, [...] A miserable sight, and frightening, too-- [...] You needn't smile--I didn't recognise him-- [...] I wasn't looking for him--and he's changed. [...] Wait till you see." [...] "Where did you say he'd been?" [...] "He didn't say. I dragged him to the house, [...] And gave him tea and tried to make him smoke. [...] I tried to make him talk about his travels. [...] Nothing would do: he just kept nodding off." [...] "What did he say? Did he say anything?" [...] "But little." [...] "Anything? Mary, confess [...] He said he'd come to ditch the meadow for me." [...] "Warren!" [...] "But did he? I just want to know." [...] "Of course he did. What would you have him say? [...] Surely you wouldn't grudge the poor old man [...] Some humble way to save his self-respect. [...] He added, if you really care to know, [...] He meant to clear the upper pasture, too. [...] That sounds like something you have heard before? [...] Warren, I wish you could have heard the way [...] He jumbled everything. I stopped to look [...] Two or three times--he made me feel so queer-- [...] To see if he was talking in his sleep. [...] He ran on Harold Wilson--you remember-- [...] The boy you had in haying four years since. [...] He's finished school, and teaching in his college. [...] Silas declares you'll have to get him back. [...] He says they two will make a team for work: [...] Between them they will lay this farm as smooth!

[...] "Yes, I took care to keep well out of earshot." [...] "Well, those days trouble Silas like a dream. [...] You wouldn't think they would. How some things linger! [...] Harold's young college boy's assurance piqued him. [...] After so many years he still keeps finding [...] Good arguments he sees he might have used. [...] I sympathise. I know just how it feels [...] To think of the right thing to say too late. [...] Harold's associated in his mind with Latin. [...] He asked me what I thought of Harold's saying [...] He studied Latin like the violin [...] Because he liked it--that an argument! [...] He said he couldn't make the boy believe [...] He could find water with a hazel prong-- [...] Which showed how much good school had ever done him. [...] He wanted to go over that. But most of all [...] He thinks if he could have another chance [...] To teach him how to build a load of hay----" [...] "I know, that's Silas' one accomplishment. [...] He bundles every forkful in its place, [...] And tags and numbers it for future reference, [...] So he can find and easily dislodge it [...] In the unloading. Silas does that well. [...] He takes it out in bunches like big birds' nests. [...] You never see him standing on the hay [...] He's trying to lift, straining to lift himself." [...] "He thinks if he could teach him that, he'd be [...] Some good perhaps to someone in the world. [...] He hates to see a boy the fool of books. [...] Poor Silas, so concerned for other folk, [...] And nothing to look backward to with pride, [...] And nothing to look forward to with hope, [...] So now and never any different."

[...] "Silas has better claim on us you think [...] Than on his brother? Thirteen little miles [...] As the road winds would bring him to his door. [...] Silas has walked that far no doubt to-day. [...] Why didn't he go there? His brother's rich, [...] A somebody--director in the bank." [...] "He never told us that." [...] "We know it though." [...] "I think his brother ought to help, of course. [...] I'll see to that if there is need. He ought of right [...] To take him in, and might be willing to-- [...] He may be better than appearances. [...] But have some pity on Silas. Do you think [...] If he'd had any pride in claiming kin [...] Or anything he looked for from his brother, [...] He'd keep so still about him all this time?" [...] "I wonder what's between them." [...] "I can tell you. [...] Silas is what he is--we wouldn't mind him-- [...] But just the kind that kinsfolk can't abide. [...] He never did a thing so very bad. [...] He don't know why he isn't quite as good [...] As anyone. He won't be made ashamed [...] To please his brother, worthless though he is." [...] "I can't think Si ever hurt anyone." [...] "No, but he hurt my heart the way he lay [...] And rolled his old head on that sharp-edged chair-back. [...] He wouldn't let me put him on the lounge. [...] You must go in and see what you can do. [...] I made the bed up for him there to-night. [...] You'll be surprised at him--how much he's broken. [...] His working days are done; I'm sure of it." [...] "I'd not be in a hurry to say that." [...] "I haven't been. Go, look, see for yourself. [...] But, Warren, please remember how it is: [...] He's come to help you ditch the meadow. [...] He has a plan. You mustn't laugh at him. [...] He may not speak of it, and then he may. [...] I'll sit and see if that small sailing cloud [...] Will hit or miss the moon." [...] It hit the moon. [...] Then there were three there, making a dim row, [...] The moon, the little silver cloud, and she.
