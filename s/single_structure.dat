5|$|Areoles {{are highly}} {{specialized}} and very condensed shoots or branches. In a normal shoot, nodes bearing leaves or flowers would be separated by lengths of stem (internodes). In an areole, the nodes {{are so close}} together, they form a <b>single</b> <b>structure.</b> The areole may be circular, elongated into an oval shape, or even separated into two parts; the two parts may be visibly connected in some way (e.g. by a groove in the stem) or appear entirely separate (a dimorphic areole). The part nearer {{the top of the}} stem then produces flowers, the other part spines. Areoles often have multicellular hairs (trichomes) that give the areole a hairy or woolly appearance, sometimes of a distinct color such as yellow or brown.|$|E
5|$|The Twenty-five Year Award can {{be awarded}} to {{any type of}} {{architectural}} project and may be either a <b>single</b> <b>structure</b> {{or a group of}} structures that compose a larger whole. Past examples of projects winning the award in this way include both monuments, such as the Gateway Arch and Vietnam Veterans Memorial, and groupings of buildings, such as the Salk Institute for Biological Studies and Haystack Mountain School of Crafts. Most buildings nominated for this award are new structures but one winner, Faneuil Hall Marketplace, was a substantial renovation of warehouses into a festival marketplace.|$|E
5|$|The {{earthquake}} was 6.4 on {{the moment}} magnitude scale, {{with a maximum}} perceived intensity of IX (Violent) on the Mercalli intensity scale. However, most of the intensity measurements were consistent with an overall maximum intensity of VII (Very strong), and only the damage to a <b>single</b> <b>structure,</b> the Imperial County Services building in El Centro, was judged to be of intensity IX. Several comprehensive studies on the total structural failure of this building were conducted {{with a focus on}} how the building responded to the earthquake's vibration.

40|$|The Fourier {{approach}} and theories of space groups and color symmetries {{are used to}} systematically generate and compare bicontinuous cubic structures {{in the framework of}} a Ginzburg-Landau model for ternary amphiphilic systems. Both <b>single</b> and double <b>structures</b> are investigated; they correspond to systems with one or two monolayers in a unit cell, respectively. We show how and why <b>single</b> <b>structures</b> can be made to approach triply periodic minimal surfaces very closely, and give improved nodal approximations for G, D, I-WP and P surfaces. We demonstrate that the relative stability of the <b>single</b> <b>structures</b> can be calculated from the geometrical properties of their interfaces only. The single gyroid G {{turns out to be the}} most stable bicontinuous cubic phase since it has the smallest porosity. The representations are used to calculate distributions of the Gaussian curvature and 2 H-NMR bandshapes for C(P), C(D), S, C(Y) and F-RD surfaces.

5|$|Kirie and Shuichi {{devise a}} plan to escape Kurōzu-cho, but when they attempt to escape, their efforts are unsuccessful. After {{returning}} to the town, they discover that several {{years have passed since}} they left, as time speeds up away from the spiral. The other citizens have expanded the terraced houses until they connect into a <b>single</b> <b>structure</b> forming a spiral pattern. Kirie and Shuichi decide to search for Kirie's parents, which brings them {{to the center of the}} spiral. At the center, they fall down a pit, within which they discover the corpses of Kirie's parents and an ancient city completely covered with spiral patterns. Shuichi urges Kirie to move forward and find a way to stop the curse, but she replies that she does not have the strength and wishes to stay with him. The two embrace each other, and their bodies twist and wrap together as a result of the curse. As they lie together, Kirie notes that the curse ended at the same time it began, for just as time speeds up away from the center, it freezes at the center, and concludes that the curse is eternal, and all the events will repeat when a new Kurōzu-cho is built where the previous one laid.|$|E
5|$|The Polish–Lithuanian {{national}} contingent {{was organized}} in traditional formations {{dating back to}} the earlier medieval times, with chorągiew (banner) unit, commanded by a rotmistrz and composed of smaller poczet (lance) retinues, each composed of one towarzysz and a varying number of aides. The size of a chorągiew could vary from as little as 60 to as many as 300 men. Two or more choragwie (through rarely more than a dozen, and never more than about forty) formed a regiment (pułk) unit, a type of a unit similar to the medieval battle or modern division or corps. Its senior commander was known as pułkownik (colonel). The foreign contingent was organized into regiments, often numbering around 500-1,000, and divided into companies. King John III Sobieski made an attempt in the 1670s to replace the national-foreign contingent divisions with a <b>single</b> <b>structure,</b> dividing units into infantry, cavalry and dragoons, but it would take many decades before those reforms bore fruit.|$|E
5|$|The upper molars {{have two}} {{longitudinal}} rows of cusps, not three {{as in the}} black and brown rats. The first and second upper molars are oval in form and the flexi do not extend to the midline of the molars. The anterocone, the front cusp of the upper first molar, is not divided in two by an indentation at its front (anteromedian flexus), but does display a hollow in the middle, the anteromedian fossette, which divides it into separate cuspules at the labial and lingual (inner) sides of the molar. A crest, the anteroloph, is present behind the labial cuspule, but in older animals, the cusps and the crest are united into a <b>single</b> <b>structure</b> by wear. In the third upper molar, the cusps at the back are reduced and scarcely distinguishable. As in most oryzomyines, the upper molars all have one root on the inner (lingual) side and two on the outer (labial) side; in addition, the first upper molar usually has another small labial root.|$|E

25|$|The human cornea borders {{with the}} sclera via the corneal limbus. In lampreys, the cornea is solely an {{extension}} of the sclera, and is separate from the skin above it, but in more advanced vertebrates it is always fused with the skin to form a <b>single</b> <b>structure,</b> albeit one composed of multiple layers. In fish, and aquatic vertebrates in general, the cornea plays no role in focusing light, since it has virtually the same refractive index as water.|$|E
40|$|The {{biological}} {{performance of}} artificial biomaterials {{is closely related}} to their structure characteristics. Cell adhesion, migration, proliferation, and differentiation are all strongly affected by the different scale structures of biomaterials. Silk fibroin (SF), extracted mainly from silkworms, has become a popular biomaterial due to its excellent biocompatibility, exceptional mechanical properties, tunable degradation, ease of processing, and sufficient supply. As a material with excellent processability, SF can be processed into various forms with different structures, including particulate, fiber, film, and three-dimensional (3 D) porous scaffolds. This review discusses and summarizes the various constructions of SF-based materials, from <b>single</b> <b>structures</b> to multi-level structures, and their applications. In combination with <b>single</b> <b>structures,</b> new techniques for creating special multi-level structures of SF-based materials, such as micropatterning and 3 D-printing, are also briefly addressed...|$|R

25|$|In birds, {{there is}} a {{variable}} number of cervical vertebrae, which often form the only truly flexible part of the spine. The thoracic vertebrae are partially fused, providing a solid brace for the wings during flight. The sacral vertebrae are fused with the lumbar vertebrae, and some thoracic and caudal vertebrae, to form a <b>single</b> <b>structure,</b> the synsacrum, which is thus of greater relative length than the sacrum of mammals. In living birds, the remaining caudal vertebrae are fused into a further bone, the pygostyle, for attachment of the tail feathers.|$|E

25|$|In his Investigations in Collective Form Maki {{coined the}} term Megastructure to refer {{structures}} that house the whole or part of a city in a <b>single</b> <b>structure.</b> He originated the idea from vernacular forms of village architecture that were projected into vast structures {{with the aid of}} modern technology. Reyner Banham borrowed Megastructure for the title of his 1976 book which contained numerous built and unbuilt projects. He defined Megastructures as modular units (with a short life span) that attached to structural framework (with a longer life span). Maki would later criticise the Megastructure approach to design advocating instead his idea of Group Form which he thought would better accommodate the disorder of the city.|$|E
25|$|According to {{the editor}} of Gray's Anatomy Professor Susan Standring, {{mesentery}} has been known for thousands of years. The classical anatomical description of the mesocolon is credited to British surgeon Sir Frederick Treves in 1885, although a description of the membrane as a <b>single</b> <b>structure</b> dates back to at least Leonardo da Vinci. Treves is known for performing the first appendectomy in England in 1888; he was surgeon to both Queen Victoria and King Edward VII. He studied the human mesentery and peritoneal folds in 100 cadavers and described the right and left mesocolons as vestigial or absent in the human adult. Accordingly, the small intestinal mesentery, transverse, and sigmoid mesocolons all terminated or attached at their insertions into the posterior abdominal wall. These assertions were included in mainstream surgical, anatomical, embryological, and radiologic literature for more than a century.|$|E
