25|$|The primary {{function}} of the pusdalyvis is to indicate a simultaneous, but <b>secondary</b> <b>action</b> done by the sentence subject in nominative case (it must be matched according to gender and number with the said subject): Lauko darbus mes dirbome dainuodami – We were doing the field works while singing. In this case the present padalyvis participle {{can be used as}} well: Lauko darbus mes dirbome dainuojant, but this time the sentence will mean: We were doing the field works while someone else was singing. A <b>secondary</b> <b>action</b> done previously by the sentence subject can be expressed with adjectival past simple participle: Lauko darbus mes dirbome padainavę – We were doing the field works having sung. When used with the preposition prieš (before), pusdalyvis and padalyvis denote a <b>secondary</b> <b>action</b> in future: Lauko darbus mes dirbome prieš dainuodami. – We were doing the field works before singing. Lauko darbus mes dirbome prieš dainuojant. – We were doing the field works before someone else started to sing.|$|E
25|$|Another {{function}} of the padalyvis is to explain (precise) another verb by indicating a <b>secondary</b> <b>action</b> of which the subject is not the agent: Vartydamas seną albumą, prisiminiau mus šiame ežere maudydavusis – While seing an old photo album, I remembered us having used to swim in this lake. If the subject is the agent, an adjectival participle must be used instead.|$|E
25|$|The third, a {{somewhat}} rarer, {{function is to}} explain (precise) another verb by indicating a <b>secondary</b> <b>action</b> of which the subject is the agent: Kaltinamasis prisipažįsta padaręs nusikaltimą ir labai dėl to gailisi. – The defendant confesses having committed the crime and sincerely regrets it. If the subject is not the agent expressed in the nominative case of a noun or a pronoun, an adverbial participle must be used instead.|$|E

25|$|Adding <b>secondary</b> <b>actions</b> to {{the main}} action gives a scene more life, and can help to support the main action. A person walking can {{simultaneously}} swing their arms or keep them in their pockets, speak or whistle, or express emotions through facial expressions. The important thing about <b>secondary</b> <b>actions</b> is that they emphasize, rather than take {{attention away from the}} main action. If the latter is the case, those actions are better left out. For example, during a dramatic movement, facial expressions will often go unnoticed. In these cases it is better to include them at {{the beginning and the end}} of the movement, rather than during.|$|R

For instance, various chlorides acted upon, when fused (402.), by platina electrodes, have the chlorine determined electrically to the anode. In many cases, as with the chlorides of lead, potassium, barium, &c., the chlorine acts on the platina and forms a compound with it, which dissolves; but when protochloride of tin is used, the chlorine at the anode does not act upon the platina, but upon the chloride already there, forming a perchloride which rises in vapour (790. 804.). These are, therefore, instances of <b>secondary</b> <b>actions</b> of both kinds, produced in bodies containing no water.|$|R
25|$|Lawful trade {{disputes}} were {{restricted to}} those disputes between employers and their workers concerning working conditions, wages, etc. This new definition, therefore, excludes disputes between an employer and a trade union where (i) {{none of the}} workers are in a dispute, (ii) disputes between trade unions and workers, (iii) and disputes connected only to working conditions, wages, etc. and not about them either mainly or wholly. This definition also does not include disputes on foreign matters unless the jobs of the workers striking in Great Britain {{are likely to be}} affected by the outcome of the dispute. Immunity is removed from <b>secondary</b> <b>action</b> when taken by workers of one company to pressurise another company where there is no dispute between their workers and employers.|$|E
25|$|From 1979, a new Conservative {{government}} took a strongly sceptical policy to {{all forms of}} labour law and regulation. During the 1980s ten major Acts gradually reduced the autonomy of trade unions and the legality of industrial action. Reforms to the internal structure of unions mandated that representatives be elected and a ballot is taken before a strike, that no worker could strike in sympathetic <b>secondary</b> <b>action</b> with workers with a different employer, and that employers could not run a closed shop system of requiring all workers to join the recognised union. The wage councils were dismantled. A public campaign against the merits of unions paralleled the decline of membership and collective agreement coverage to under 40 per cent. In addition, the government opted out of the EU Social Chapter in the Maastricht Treaty. In 1997 the new Labour government brought the UK into the EU's Social Chapter, which {{has served as the}} source for most reform in UK law since that time. Domestic led reform was minimal. The National Minimum Wage Act 1998 established a country-wide minimum wage, but did not attempt to reinvigorate the Wage Board system. The Employment Relations Act 1999 introduced a 60-page procedure requiring employers to compulsorily recognise and bargain with a union holding support among workers, though union membership remained at a level steadily declining below 30 per cent.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{function}} of active participles {{is to describe}} a <b>secondary</b> <b>action</b> performed by the sentence subject before the main action: Atidariusi langą mergina grožėjosi tekančia saule. – Having opened the window, the girl admired the sunrise. This function {{is limited to the}} past simple participle and is one of its most common uses. If {{there is a need to}} describe a <b>secondary</b> <b>action</b> performed by the sentence subject at the same time as the main action, the pusdalyvis must be used instead (present active participle does not have this function): Atidarydama langą mergina grožėjosi tekančia saule. – While opening the window, the girl admired the sunrise.

30|$|Primary {{actions are}} {{confined}} to the company’s internal environment and exclude carrying out community action projects. The community can be incorporated in the <b>secondary</b> and tertiary <b>actions.</b> In <b>secondary</b> <b>actions,</b> which {{are directly related to}} a company’s productive activity, it can, for example, facilitate employment and economic activity in the local community or county, providing advice and assistance to the community on matters stated therein and, where the company has knowledge and resources, collaborate in the creation of internships for vocational education and university students.|$|R
30|$|Bestratén and Pujol {{believe it}} is {{necessary}} to comply with primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>actions</b> in order to achieve these tertiary actions, which incorporate activities in the community that are not directly related to the company’s business.

2500|$|Based upon a {{view that}} life begins at conception, Protestant author Randy Alcorn rejects all forms of {{hormonal}} contraceptives, while James Dobson and obstetrician and minister William R. Cutrer reject only certain forms of them. Dobson and Cutrer view progesterone-only birth control pills as potentially problematic, since they may be potentially abortive contraceptives because of the theoretical possibility {{that they may have}} a slight <b>secondary</b> <b>action</b> of preventing a fertilized embryo from implanting within the uterine wall, while Alcorn implicates all hormonal contraceptives as problematic in these regards. Dobson's Focus on the Family states,Dr. Dobson would emphasize as foundational his strict concurrence with the biblical teaching that every child is a blessing from God ... While affirming that human life begins with fertilization (the union of sperm and egg), his interpretation of Scripture leads him to believe that the prevention of fertilization is not morally wrong. However, he would oppose any method of birth control that acts after fertilization and terminates a conceived human life by preventing its implantation in the womb ... After two years of extended deliberation and prayer, the PRC {{has not been able to}} reach a consensus as to the likelihood, or even the possibility, that these medications might contribute to the loss of human life after fertilization. The majority of the experts to which Dr. Dobson has spoken feel that the pill does not have an abortifacient effect. A minority of the experts feel that when conception occurs on the pill, there is enough of a possibility for an abortifacient effect , however remote, to warrant informing women about it.|$|E

50|$|In {{philosophy}} and gender studies, some theorists, notably Jacques Derrida and Judith Butler, {{have argued that}} even commonplace communication and speech acts are performative, in that they serve to define and maintain identity. In this way, performativity reverses the idea that an identity {{is the source of}} more <b>secondary</b> <b>actions</b> (speech, gestures).

6000|$|... 831. vi. A body not decomposable when alone, as boracic acid, is not {{directly}} decomposable by the electric current when in combination (780.). It may act as an ion going wholly to the anode or cathode, but does not yield up its elements, except occasionally by a <b>secondary</b> <b>action.</b> Perhaps it is superfluous for me {{to point out that}} this proposition has no relation to such cases as that of water, which, by the presence of other bodies, is rendered a better conductor of electricity, and therefore is more freely decomposed.|$|E
6000|$|... 1010. In {{order to}} simplify the conditions, dilute sulphuric acid was first used in all the cells, and platina for the {{interposed}} plates; for then the initial intensity of the current which tends to be formed is constant, being due to the power which zinc has of decomposing water; and the opposing force of decomposition is also constant, {{the elements of the}} water being unassisted in their separation at the interposed plates by any affinity or <b>secondary</b> <b>action</b> at the electrodes (744.), arising either from the nature of the plate itself or the surrounding fluid.|$|E
6000|$|... 706. There is no {{substance}} better fitted, under ordinary circumstances, {{to be the}} indicating body in such {{an instrument}} than water; for it is decomposed with facility when rendered a better conductor {{by the addition of}} acids or salts; its elements may in numerous cases be obtained and collected without any embarrassment from <b>secondary</b> <b>action,</b> and, being gaseous, they are in the best physical condition for separation and measurement. Water, therefore, acidulated by sulphuric acid, is the substance I shall generally refer to, although it may become expedient in peculiar cases or forms of experiment to use other bodies (843.).|$|E

6000|$|... 833. viii. A {{substance}} which, {{being used}} as the electrode, can combine with the ion evolved against it, is also, I believe, an ion, and combines, in such cases, in the quantity represented by its electro-chemical equivalent. All the experiments I have made agree with this view; {{and it seems to}} me, at present, to result as a necessary consequence. Whether, in the <b>secondary</b> <b>actions</b> that take place, where the ion acts, not upon the matter of the electrode, but on that which is around it in the liquid (744.), the same consequence follows, will require more extended investigation to determine.|$|R
6000|$|... 757. Sulphuric acid.--I {{have already}} given my reasons for {{concluding}} that sulphuric acid is not electrolyzable, i.e. not decomposable {{directly by the}} electric current, but occasionally suffering by a <b>secondary</b> <b>action</b> at the cathode from the hydrogen evolved there (681.). In the year 1800, Davy considered the sulphur from sulphuric acid {{as the result of}} the action of the nascent hydrogen[A]. In 1804, Hisinger and Berzelius stated that it was the direct result of the action of the voltaic pile[B], an opinion which from that time Davy seems to have adopted, and which has since been commonly received by all. The change of my own opinion requires that I should correct what I have already said of the decomposition of sulphuric acid in a former series of these Researches (552.): I do not now think that the appearance of the sulphur at the negative electrode is an immediate consequence of electrolytic action.|$|E
6000|$|... 681. On {{experimenting with}} sulphuric acid, I found {{no reason to}} believe that it was by itself a {{conductor}} of, or decomposable by, electricity, although I had previously been of that opinion (552.). When very strong it is a much worse conductor than if diluted[A]. If then subjected to the action of a powerful battery, oxygen appears at the anode, or positive electrode, although much is absorbed (728.), and hydrogen and sulphur appear at the cathode, or negative electrode. Now the hydrogen has with me always been pure, not sulphuretted, and has been deficient in proportion to the sulphur present, so that it is evident that when decomposition occurred water must have been decomposed. I endeavoured to make the experiment with anhydrous sulphuric acid; and it appeared to me that, when fused, such acid was not a conductor, nor decomposed; but I had not enough of the dry acid in my possession to allow me to decide the point satisfactorily. My belief is, that when sulphur appears during the action of the pile on sulphuric acid, it is the result of a <b>secondary</b> <b>action,</b> and that the acid itself is not electrolyzable (757.).|$|E
6000|$|... 839. In {{the next}} place, from propositions ii. and iii., may be deduced the {{knowledge}} of many other ions, and also their equivalents. When chloride of lead was decomposed, platina being used for both electrodes (395.), there could remain no more doubt that chlorine was passing to the anode, although it combined with the platina there, than when the positive electrode, being of plumbago (794.), allowed its evolution in the free state; neither could there, in either case, remain any doubt that for every 103.5 parts of lead evolved at the cathode, 36 parts of chlorine were evolved at the anode, for the remaining chloride of lead was unchanged. So also, when in a metallic solution one volume of oxygen, or a secondary compound containing that proportion, appeared at the anode, no doubt could arise that hydrogen, equivalent to two volumes, had been determined to the cathode, although, by a <b>secondary</b> <b>action,</b> it had been employed in reducing oxides of lead, copper, or other metals, to the metallic state. In this manner, then, we learn from the experiments already described in these Researches, that chlorine, iodine, bromine, fluorine, calcium, potassium, strontium, magnesium, manganese, &c., are ions and that their electro-chemical equivalents {{are the same as}} their ordinary chemical equivalents.|$|E
