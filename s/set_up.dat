40|$|A {{major issue}} in micromilling is the <b>setting</b> <b>up</b> with the {{necessary}} accuracy the work coordinate system on the machine. The spindle thermal stability during the <b>setting</b> <b>up</b> procedure make this a very difficult task. Thus, {{it is essential to}} develop new tool <b>setting</b> <b>up</b> technology to increase the process productivity, reduce machine <b>setting</b> <b>up</b> times and errors, {{and at the same time}} improve the precision and quality of machined components. The paper presents a cost-effective and reliable method for <b>setting</b> <b>up</b> the work coordinate system for micro-milling operations employing an on-line tool–workpiece voltage monitoring system. The viability of the proposed method was verified in a series of experiments conducted on an ultra-precision micromilling machine centre. The experimental trials involved the machining of test parts in brass with cutters 100 and 200 µm in diameter. The results of these experiments were analysed and compared with the capabilities of currently available methods and technologies on micro milling machine tools for condition monitoring and <b>setting</b> <b>up</b> the working coordinate systems. Finally, conclusions are made about the effectiveness of the proposed new tool-workpiece <b>setting</b> <b>up</b> technology for micro milling...|$|R
