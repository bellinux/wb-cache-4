30|$|Extensive {{research}} {{work has been}} performed to discuss the modeling, control strategies and schedulable potential of AC loads for peak load reduction in the past decades [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. Based on the widely used equivalent thermal parameters (ETP) model for a decentralized AC load, a comfort-constrained state-queueing model is adopted to model and control the aggregated thermostatically controlled appliances in [16, 17]. Bashash et al. [18] develops a bilinear partial differential equation model and a sliding mode controller for the real-time management of thermostatic AC loads. Zhang et al. [19] builds a highly accurate aggregated model for a heterogeneous population of AC loads and designs a novel aggregated control strategy for the load population under realistic conditions. To provide a daily control scheduling, the dynamic programming algorithm is presented and optimized for groups of interruptible AC loads [20, 21, 22].To avoid the transient payback load phenomenon, a group-direct load control (DLC) program of air-conditioning systems is proposed with a least enthalpy estimator-based thermal comfort controller [23]. Goel et al. [24] provides a fuzzy logic based DLC scheme for AC loads which can achieve a good tradeoff among peak load shaving, system operating cost reduction and system reliability improvement. A decentralized control approach is proposed in [25] for accurate modulation of the aggregate power consumption of the thermostatically controlled loads. In order to manage a virtual power plant composed {{of a large number}} of customers with thermostatically controlled appliances, Ruiz et al. [26] provides a control strategy based not only on ON/OFF cycles but also on modifications of the temperature settings of the thermostats. Taking the customer’s satisfaction into consideration, Huang et al. [27] presents a novel adaptive control strategy for integrating DLC with interruptible load management to provide instantaneous reserves for ancillary services. In order to eliminate the unwanted power oscillations, several safe protocols of the thermostatically controlled loads are presented for providing power system reserves [28, 29]. By utilizing the building simulation tool, the potential for residential mechanical pre-cooling of building thermal mass to shift the peak load is evaluated [30]. A Kalman filter-based method is proposed for estimating the energy savings of populations of controlled AC loads [31]. An evaluation performed by employing the energy management and control system of several control strategies is presented for <b>split</b> <b>heating,</b> ventilation and AC systems [32].|$|E

40|$|The {{primary goal}} of the work {{described}} in this paper was to evaluate and extend a virtual refrigerant charge sensor (VRC) for determining refrigerant charge for equipment having variable-speed compressors and fans. To evaluate {{the accuracy of the}} VRC, data were first collected from previous laboratory tests for different systems and over a wide range of operating conditions. In addition, new laboratory tests were performed to consider conditions not available within the existing data set. The systems for the new laboratory tests were two residential ductless <b>split</b> <b>heat</b> pump systems that employ a variable-speed compressor and R- 410 a as the refrigerant. Based on the evaluations, the original virtual charge sensor (termed Model I) was found to work well in estimating the refrigerant charge for systems with a variable-speed compressor under many operating conditions. However, for extreme test conditions such as low outdoor temperatures and low compressor speed, the VRC needed to be improved. To overcome the limitations, the model associated with the VRC sensor was modified to include a term involving the inlet quality to the evaporator (termed model II). Both the model I and II showed good performance in terms of predicting charge levels for systems with a constant speed compressor, but model II gave better performance for systems with a variable-speed compressor. However, when the superheat of the compressor was zero, neither model I nor II could accurately predict charge level. Therefore, a third approach (Model III) was developed that includes the discharge superheat of the compressor. This model improved performance for a laboratory-tested system that included a number of points with no superheat entering the compressor...|$|R
40|$|The {{need for}} making a shift from {{refrigerants}} with high Global Warming Potential (GWP) to those with lower GWP is becoming increasingly important. A broad spectrum of alternative refrigerants have been proposed and their performance needs to be investigated through simulation and testing. To evaluate the performance of these candidates, the Air Conditioning, Heating and Refrigeration Institute (AHRI) has announced an industry-wide research program for studying the performance of low GWP refrigerants for major product categories such as air conditioners, heat pumps, chillers and refrigerators. One such study investigated alternatives to R 410 A, namely R 32, D 2 Y 60 and L 41 a. The investigation was conducted using a 3 -ton residential <b>split</b> <b>heat</b> pump unit. This paper presents Simulink®-based steady state and transient analysis of the heat pump unit using two of the alternative refrigerants, R 32 and D 2 Y 60. A simplified, finite control volume approach is used to model the heat exchangers, while the expansion valve and compressor are treated as quasi-steady state components. The steady state and transient results compare well with measured data and the transient trends of the model are reproduced as expected, although with faster system response due {{to the exclusion of}} a TXV and accumulator. The proposed model can reasonably predict both steady state and transient performance of the heat pump for all the refrigerants analyzed under the operating conditions simulated. The results show that comparable capacities to the R 410 A baseline can be obtained using R 32, although with a lower COP due to degradations in compressor efficiencies. For D 2 Y 60 cycles, the capacities and COP are generally lower than the baseline cycle...|$|R

R 410 A is a common refrigerant for air conditioning and heat pumping application but has a GWP of 2088. Drop-in tests of three R 410 A low-GWP alternative refrigerants (R 32, D 2 Y 60 and L- 41 A) in a 3 ton <b>split</b> <b>heat</b> pump unit are performed according to ASHRAE Standard 116 - 1995 test matrix. The test matrix is expanded to include extended cooling and heating conditions which represent extreme weather conditions.

However, the capacity of D 2 Y 60 is {{lower than that of}} R 410 A by an average of 18 % for cooling and 14 % for heating. An in-house component based vapor compression system simulation tool is validated against the experimental data.

A total of 32 experiments are used in the validation. The results of the validation are in good agreement with the experiments. Most of the predicted COP and capacity results lie within 5 % of the measured values. The largest error is in the case of low temperature and extended condition tests because the mass flow rates were estimated and not measured.
