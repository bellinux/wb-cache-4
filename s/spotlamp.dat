40|$|The six carbon {{atoms of}} a benzenoid {{aromatic}} ring {{can be a}} valuable resource for constructing more complex, nonaromatic targets, 1 and photochemistry 2 has a good track record {{as a tool for}} breaking open the aromatic sextet. In this Communication, we reveal a mild new photochemical reaction which, by means of base and a simple halogen <b>spotlamp,</b> achieves the stereospecific transforma-tion of tertiary benzamides into a range of seven-membered cyclic trienes and dienones, or their norcaradiene analogues. As we have previously shown, the extended enolate 3 may be made by lithiating 1 to form organolithium 2 in the presence of HMPA. 3 Protonation of 3 yields the dearomatized tetrahydroisoin-dolinones 4 in 80 % yield (Scheme 1). However, when the enolate 3 (which can be re-formed from 4 with LDA) was cooled to- 78 Â°C and the resulting red solution was placed under a 500 W tungsten-filament halogen lamp, a rearrangement took place over a period of 3 h. Workup gave the cycloheptatriene 5 in 72 % yield...|$|E

5000|$|Announced 16 October 1956, the 105R and 105S used a high-output, 8.5:1 {{compression}} {{version of}} the 2.6 L engine used in the 90. The higher compression was {{to take advantage of}} the higher octane fuel that had become widely available. This twin-SU carburettor engine produced 108 hp (80 kW). [...] Both 105 models also featured the exterior changes of the rest of the range announced a month earlier. The 105S featured separate front seats, a cigar lighter, chromed wheel trim rings and twin Lucas SFT 576 <b>spotlamps.</b> To minimise the cost of the 105R, these additional items were not standard, however they were provided on the (higher priced) 105R De Luxe.|$|R
2500|$|There {{have also}} been various special editions of the Defender created by the company's {{overseas}} operations for sale in their specific markets such as the [...] "Sahara" [...] edition and 55th anniversary Defender 90s sold in France - the former being a basic-spec model painted in a sand-like tan colour and supplied with special decals and the latter being a 4x4 fitted with numerous luxury options and special badges in the mould of the factory-built 50th editions. Sometimes individual Land Rover dealers have created limited editions of vehicles to suite their markets. A dealer in Scotland created the [...] "Braemar" [...] edition of 25 vehicles to appeal to local agricultural and forestry buyers, being a 90 hard top supplied ready fitted with a winch, off-road tyres, <b>spotlamps</b> and worklamps, underbody protection and chequer plate.|$|R
2500|$|Following the team's {{first race}} outing both cars used {{returned}} to the factory in a damaged state. Alongside minor engine modification, during repair dramatic changes {{were made to the}} styling of the machines. The panelwork was smoothed even further, with the small front wings now completely gone and the roofline raised between the rear fins; the headlamps were set into deeply recessed, [...] conical tunnels; the <b>spotlamps</b> and indicator lights were set into more conventional faired recesses; and the engine air intake bulge was smoothed and tapered. At the same time the car's width was reduced, and cutout ducts were introduced behind the front wheels to improve cooling of the front brakes. All ancillary components were also removed from the airflow, either by fairing or by choosing alternative methods.|$|R

50|$|With few 9C1 Chevrolet Caprice {{vehicles}} {{remaining in}} the motor pool (as the final model year of the Chevrolet Caprice was 1996), the Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor {{is one of two}} sedans for patrol in the department fleet, the other being the newly approved 2008 Dodge Charger LX Police Special. Only the sedan is permitted to engage in a vehicle pursuit, pursuant to department policy. Like most police agencies throughout southern California, Los Angeles Police Department vehicles are ordered painted in black clearcoat with the roof, doors, and pillars painted white from the factory. The Department has used this black-and-white paint scheme since approximately 1940 with minimal modifications. Options available from Ford ordered by the Department today include the handle-bar <b>spotlamps,</b> 16-inch heavy duty steel wheels with chrome center caps, and ballistic panels within the two front doors.|$|R
