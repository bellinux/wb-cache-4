2500|$|A {{large number}} of {{personality}} traits are related to SWB constructs, although intelligence has negligible relationships. Positive affect is most <b>strongly</b> <b>predicted</b> by extraversion, {{to a lesser extent}} agreeableness, and more weakly by openness to experience. Happiness was most <b>strongly</b> <b>predicted</b> by extraversion, and also <b>strongly</b> <b>predicted</b> by neuroticism, {{and to a lesser extent}} by the other three factors. Life satisfaction was significantly predicted by neuroticism, extraversion, agreeableness, and conscientiousness. Quality of life was very <b>strongly</b> <b>predicted</b> by neuroticism, and also <b>strongly</b> <b>predicted</b> by extraversion and conscientiousness, and to a modest extent by agreeableness and openness to experience. [...] One study found that subjective well-being was genetically indistinct from personality traits, especially those that reflected emotional stability (low Neuroticism), and social and physical activity (high Extraversion), and constraint (high Conscientiousness).|$|R
40|$|The study {{examined}} the contribution of domain-specific cultural orientation and racial discrimination to subjective competence (as measured by sense of coherence) in American-born and immigrant Chinese American young adults. It was hypothesized that sense of coherence would be more <b>strongly</b> <b>predicted</b> by domain-specific cultural orientation for immigrants, but by racial discrimination for American-borns. A total of 122 American-born and 231 immigrant Chinese American college students living in a multicultural setting participated in this study. As hypothesized, domain-specific cultural orientation more <b>strongly</b> <b>predicted</b> sense of coherence for immigrants (coherence varied by cultural orientation on all three life domains studied) than for American-borns (coherence varied by cultural orientation on only one domain). Also, racial discrimination more <b>strongly</b> <b>predicted</b> sense of coherence for American-borns than immigrants. Implications of the findings are discussed. © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

For 1523 students in 12 secondary schools in England, science self-confidence was predicted by various factors: current self-confidence (self-concept) was most <b>strongly</b> <b>predicted</b> by received praise, current grades, and interest in science; self-confidence for future attainment (self-efficacy) was most <b>strongly</b> <b>predicted</b> by current grades and perceived utility of science. For both measures of self-confidence, reported subject-comparisons (science being harder than other subjects) predictively associated with under-confidence, while reported utility predictively associated with over-confidence. Under-confident students reported consistently lower than other students, highlighting that under-confidence may ultimately be motivationally detrimental...|$|R

Lastly, a client may have an expectation about how many sessions they will be attending.

50|$|Reading is an {{important}} skill as reading ability during primary school predicts academic achievement and later success. Therefore, particular emphasis is usually placed upon the development of literacy skills for preschool and kindergarten students {{to prepare them for}} the future. Children are not expected to read upon entering kindergarten. However, they are expected to have phonemic and phonological awareness, as well as a knowledge of print. Phonemic awareness {{is the first step in}} learning to read; it refers to the ability to hear and manipulate the smallest forms of language known as phonemes. Phonemic awareness upon entering kindergarten is the strongest predictor of reading success. Once a child understands phonemes, the next step is to develop phonological awareness, which is the ability to recognize that there is a relationship between sounds and letters, and letters and words. Phonological awareness <b>strongly</b> <b>predicts</b> the development of literacy skills. Upon entering kindergarten, children should also be able to recognize their own name in print, know how to handle a book, recognize letters, and identify words that rhyme. These are all predictors of literacy success.|$|E

Endothelin- 1 (ET- 1) is the most potent vasoconstriction agent known and its serum levels are increased in PIH. Therefore {{it is important to}} elucidate maternal and neonatal factors which influence endothelin- 1 serum levels. 100 pathological pregnancies and 88 controls were analyzed for blood endothelin- 1 and their anthropometric and clinical data were collected. In maternal blood ET- 1 levels were <b>strongly</b> <b>predicted</b> by diagnosis, therapy and BMI, while umbilical cord ET- 1 levels were <b>strongly</b> <b>predicted</b> by gestational age, therapy and delivery termination.

5000|$|Gottman {{and colleagues}} have {{discovered}} the ratio of positive interactions to negative interactions <b>strongly</b> <b>predicts</b> divorce. [...] Couples who maintain a ratio of five positive interactions for every negative interaction are likely to remain together. Couples who do not maintain this 5:1 ratio are likely to get divorced. Moreover, couples {{are more likely to}} stay together if they follow certain patterns of communication during conflict:"We conclude that the marriages that wound up happy and stable had a softened start-up by the wife, that the husband accepted influence from her, that he de-escalated low-intensity negative affect, that she was likely to use humor to effectively soothe him, and that he was likely to use positive affect and de-escalation to effectively soothe himself. The alternative to the active listening model suggested by these analyses is a model of gentleness, soothing, and de-escalation of negativity (negativity by one spouse is followed by the partner's neutral affect)." [...] (Gottman, Coan, Carrere, & Swanson, 1988, page 00) These patterns of communication differ from the Speaker-Listener technique, but the goals are the same: stop the escalation of negativity during conflict and take steps to make a safe space for open and honest discussion.|$|E

METHODS: Eighty-five patients with severe traumatic brain injury (admission Glasgow Coma Score [GCS] 1. 13 microg/L was the strongest predictor of death with 100 % discrimination, but GFAP (> 1. 5 microg/L) and NSE (> 21. 7 microg/L) levels also <b>strongly</b> <b>predicted</b> death (adjusted odds ratios 5. 82 [for GFAP] and 3. 91 [for NSE]).

40|$|Granting {{forgiveness}} demands self-regulation. Distinct {{modes of}} self-regulation might therefore produce distinct routes to forgiveness. Self-regulation focused on advancement (or promotion) could motivate forgiveness through the perceived benefits to be attained by repairing a relationship, i. e., one’s trust that a partner will provide such benefits rather than further betrayal. In contrast, self-regulation focused on security (or prevention) could motivate forgiveness through the perceived costs of further relationship deterioration, i. e., one’s commitment {{to maintain a}} relationship upon which one depends and protect against the loss of this relationship. These hypotheses were supported across two studies that (a) measured and manipulated promotion-focused versus prevention-focused self-regulation, (b) included real and imagined offenses in casual and close relationships, and (c) assessed forgiveness immediately following an offense and after a two-week delay. Trust in a relationship partner more <b>strongly</b> <b>predicted</b> forgiveness among promotion-focused individuals, whereas commitment to this partner more <b>strongly</b> <b>predicted</b> forgiveness among prevention-focused individuals...|$|R

40|$|This article tests four {{models of}} how parental and {{childhood}} welfare use affects sons' labor supply: the correlated disadvantages model, Wilson's structural-environmental model, Mead's welfare culture model, and Murray's incentives model.

There are four main findings. First, welfare {{use in the}} childhood neighborhood has no effects on sons' work hours.
