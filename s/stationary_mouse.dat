40|$|Analysis of the {{requirement}} for serum in the activation of the endogenous leukemia virus expression in AKR mouse embryo cells by 5 -iododeoxyuridine shows that activation can be dissociated into two discrete serum-dependent events. The first involves incorporation of 5 -iododeoxyuridine into DNA and results {{in the formation of}} a stable “activation intermediate” resembling the provirus formed during infection of <b>stationary</b> <b>mouse</b> embryo cells with exogenous leukemia virus. The second event, resulting in expression of the activation intermediate as synthesis of virus proteins, requires DNA replication but not 5 -iododeoxyuridine...|$|E
40|$|Mitotic inhibitors (colcemid, colchicine, and vinblastine) {{initiate}} DNA synthesis {{in dense}} <b>stationary</b> cultures of <b>mouse</b> embryo fibroblast-like cells. This initiation {{is not due}} to any changes in local cell population density. Relationships between the activation of proliferation and other changes of interphase fibroblast-like cells produced by the mitotic inhibitors (disappearance of cytoplasmic microtubules and activation of movements of cell surface) are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{previously}} documented {{differences in}} the behavior of microtubules in growing axons of two types of neurons, adult mouse sensory neurons and Xenopus embryonal spinal cord neurons. Namely, the bulk of microtubules was <b>stationary</b> in <b>mouse</b> sensory neurons both by the method of photoactivation of caged-fluorescein-labeled tubulin and photobleaching of fluorescein-labeled tubulin, but the bulk of microtubules did translocate anterogradely by the method of photoactivation. Although these results indicated that the stationary nature of photobleached microtubules in mouse neurons is not an artifact derived from the high levels of energy required for the procedure, it has not yet been settled whether the photobleaching method can detect the movement of microtubules properly...|$|R
40|$|Evidence is {{presented}} that the marked stimulation of sugar uptake and thymidine incorporation by addition of extra Ca 2 + to <b>stationary</b> phase <b>mouse</b> 3 T 3 cells in culture is phosphate dependent {{and due to}} {{the action of the}} calcium phosphate precipitate formed in the medium. The cells are similarly stimulated by a variety of particulate materials, including calcium pyrophosphate, barium sulfate, kaolin, and polystrene beads. The precipitate effects on sugar uptake are of the same magnitude as those seen with certain hormones (insulin, epidermal growth factor) or with fresh 10 % calf serum. The effect of barium sulfate on thymidine incorporation is also of the same magnitude as seen with these hormones, but much less than half that found with fresh calf serum. The stimulation by barium sulfate or hormones of thymidine incorporation is not phosphate dependent...|$|R
40|$|SummaryThe brain’s {{response}} to sensory input is strikingly modulated by behavioral state. Notably, the visual response of mouse {{primary visual cortex}} (V 1) is enhanced by locomotion, a tractable and accessible example of a time-locked change in cortical state. The neural circuits that transmit behavioral state to sensory cortex to produce this modulation are unknown. In vivo calcium imaging of behaving animals revealed that locomotion activates vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) -positive neurons in mouse V 1 independent of visual stimulation and largely through nicotinic inputs from basal forebrain. Optogenetic activation of VIP neurons increased V 1 visual responses in <b>stationary</b> awake <b>mice,</b> artificially mimicking the effect of locomotion, and photolytic damage of VIP neurons abolished the enhancement of V 1 responses by locomotion. These findings establish a cortical circuit for the enhancement of visual response by locomotion and provide a potential common circuit for the modulation of sensory processing by behavioral state...|$|R

Here we report photobleaching experiments on growing axons of Xenopus embryonal neurons. Anterograde movement of photobleached microtubules was observed at a frequency and translocation rate similar to the values determined by the method of photoactivation. Our results suggest that, under appropriate conditions, the photobleaching method is able to reveal the behavior of microtubules as accurately as the photoactivation method...|$|R
40|$|Examined {{have been}} the {{bacteria}} of kin Pseudomonas, {{the water of the}} open reservoirs, the wash-off from the objects of the environment of the patients' <b>stationary,</b> the albino <b>mice,</b> rabbits. The purpose of the work: a comparative study of the biological properties of the bacteria, kin Pseudomonas, isolated from the different ecological niches of the Tumensky region {{for the development of the}} criteria for the differentitation of the saprophyte and hospital strains of the pseudomonas. For the first time shown has been the significance of the freely-living pseudomonades, in particular, P. putida in the circulation on the subjects of the envinorment and contamination of the women-in-birth and the new-bornes. The method of the electrophoretic typing of the pseudomonades has been recommended for the epidemiologists and bacteriologists for performing the epidemiological investigation of cases of the intra-hospital infections.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to clarify the cooling effect of going-up sea breeze along the canal on thermal environment in the center of the city. Field observations of air temperature, humidity, wind direction and velocity were conducted in summer, 1994 and 1995 in Nagoya. These climatic conditions were measured at <b>stationary</b> points (the <b>mouse</b> of the canal and the center of the city), and moving observations points along the canal by car, around the canal on foot, and at the center of the city on foot. The sea breeze went up Horikawa canal up to 9 ? 11 km in daytime in the maximum. In that case, the stronger the sea breeze blow, the lower the air temperature in the center of the city was. In case of the sea breeze went up not so far, the cooling effect of sea breeze appeared only around the mouse of the canal. The wind velocity on the canal as a whole were stronger than that in the street. In the center of the city, cooling spots appeared in the boulevard and the small park. As a result, two canals in Nagoya can act as Wind trail which introduces cooling air to urban hot climate...|$|R
40|$|In this work, {{the effect}} of {{vaccination}} of a newly described Leishmania infantum antigenic protein has been studied in BALB/c mice infected with this parasite species. The LiHyD protein was characterized after a proteomic screening performed with the sera from dogs suffering visceral leishmaniasis (VL). Its recombinant version was expressed, purified and administered to BALB/c mice in combination with saponin. As a result of vaccination and 10 weeks after challenge using an infective dose of L. infantum <b>stationary</b> promastigotes, vaccinated <b>mice</b> showed lower parasite burdens in different organs (liver, spleen, bone marrow and footpads' draining lymph nodes) than mice inoculated with the adjuvant alone or the vaccine diluent. Protected mice showed anti-Leishmania IgG 2 a antibodies and a predominant IL- 12 -driven IFN-γ production (mainly produced by CD 4 T cells) against parasite proteins, whereas unprotected controls showed anti-Leishmania IgG 1 antibodies and parasite-mediated IL- 4 and IL- 10 responses. Vaccinated mice showed an anti-LiHyD IgG 2 a humoral response, and their spleen cells were able to secrete LiHyD-specific IFN-γ, IL- 12 and GM-CSF cytokines before and after infection. The protection was correlated with the Leishmania-specific production on nitric oxide. Altogether, {{the results indicate that}} the new LiHyD protein could be considered in vaccine formulations against VL.
