Ping learns that Kai can shape-change and turns into firstly a <b>soup</b> <b>ladle.</b> They are living happily until one day, their goat is found with its throat slit. Hua also returns to Ping on a red phoenix's back. Ping and Kai flee but they run into the necromancer. After Hua uses his newfound powers to hold off the necromancer while Ping and Kai escape, Ping, Kai and Hua are later captured by guards and taken to Liu Che, Emperor of China, and Ping's 'friend' who drops all charges against them. Ping stays in the palace and meets Princess Yangxin and the two become friends, and the Princess begins to teach Ping how to read and write, since she is unable to do so already. Ping eventually convinces the Emperor to search for any other Dragon Keepers, as she hopes to find her family. She, Kai and Dong Fang Suo (Fatso as Kai had begun to call him) go to a village in search of the next Dragon Keeper. But they do not find Ping's family there, instead, a boy named Jun is taken to be instructed as a Dragonkeeper. Ping becomes jealous when Kai seems to prefer Jun over her. During the journey back to the palace, Ping is nearly killed in an accident and left for dead, but she survives and finds her real family. After staying with them for a short time, she decides to return to the palace for Kai. However the Necromancer is there, bleeding Kai. They duel and Ping, without Kai, escapes to warn the Emperor who reveals he is in league with the Necromancer. She is stripped of her position as Imperial Dragonkeeper and taken off to be sacrificed. During the sacrifice, Dong Fang Suo, Jun, Hua and Kai come to her aid and they defeat the necromancer though Dong Fang Suo is sadly killed (who says it was the Emperor who ordered him and the necromancer to make the accident that almost killed Ping before he dies). While Jun takes his body away, Ping and Kai (Ping had let Hua go free with other rats) escape with Princess Yangxin, who asks them to go with her to the Duke's at the Kunlun Mountains, and the two agree, hoping {{to find a place to}} live in safety from the Empire.|$|E

40|$|Background & objectives: Rainwater often {{collects}} in depressions on {{rocks to}} form pools that are ideal breeding sites of mosquito vectors of diseases. Knowledge {{on the existence}} of disease vectors in these remote and relatively inaccessible locations could improve epidemiologic understanding and control capabilities. This study identifies mosquito species, their relative abundance and physicochemical characteristics of breeding microhabitats in rock pools on four inselbergs in northern Nigeria. Methods: <b>Soup</b> <b>ladle</b> dipper was used to obtain representative samples of larval mosquitoes breeding in 141 rock pools on four inselbergs. Physicochemical parameters (depth, electrical conductivity, pH, surface area, temperature and total dissolved solids) of the pools were determined. Larvae were preserved in 70 % alcohol and identified microscopically to species using taxonomic keys. Statistical correlation analysis and ANOVA were used to test the associations between physicochemical parameters and mosquito abundance, and for differences amongst inselbergs. Results: Of 2991 larvae, five species of mosquito distributed in three genera (Anopheles, Aedes and Culex) including Ae. vittatus (92. 88 %), An. ardensis (0. 13 %), An. distinctus (1. 67 %), An. wilsoni (0. 13 %) and Cx. ingrami (5. 18 %) bred in the rock pools, Up to five species occurred per pool in various conspecific and heterogeneric combinations. Except for Ae. vittatus, the physicochemical parameters of the pools correlate significantly with species abundance. Conclusion: Ae. vittatus, a potential vector of yellow fever in Nigeria breeds profusely in rock pools on inselbergs around Zaria. For comprehensive vector implication and control, rock pools should be amongst the habitats of focus in yellow fever epidemiology...|$|E
50|$|Bokoblins are {{a race of}} human-sized Goblin-like creatures, {{that first}} {{appeared}} in The Wind Waker. Bokoblins {{come in a variety}} of colors such as red, blue, and green. They often appear as standard enemies and fight wielding Boko Sticks, machetes, and clubs. Though their appearance varies from game to game, the one thing that remains consistent is they wear loincloths with a single skull. In Twilight Princess, their appearance is less common and their role as standard enemies is largely taken over by Bulblins, which are more prevalent. In Skyward Sword, Bokoblins are revealed to have been around since ancient times and are common monsters that serve the Demon Tribe, under Demon Lord Ghirahim and his master, the Demon King Demise. The game also introduces different varieties of Bokoblin such as Technoblins, which lived in Lanayru Desert in the distant past and wield sophisticated ancient technology and Cursed Bokoblins, undead Bokoblins that possess the power to curse Link. The game introduces the bow wielding Bokoblin Archers and Bokoblin Leaders that can summon other Bokoblins using the Monster Horns they carry. Humorously, Link's companion Fi notes that Bokoblins are obsessed with their idea of fashion, particularly their unusual leopard-print underwear. Red Bokoblins are most commonly encountered on the game's overworld, while green Bokoblins are encountered in dungeons. Blue Bokoblins appear in later stages of the game and effectively replace red Bokoblins. In Breath of the Wild, Bokoblin are revealed to have an omnivorous diet that consists of fruits, vegetables, fish, and meat. They also can occasionally be seen eating food and hunting wild animals for their meat, which they will consume after a successful kill. Bokoblins can wield a variety of melee weapons, bows, and shields though tend to favor their own crafted clubs, bats, spears, and bows the strongest of which are made from Dragonbone. Occasionally they will wield farming tools, <b>soup</b> <b>ladles,</b> and even Wooden Mops as weapons or Pot Lids as shields. Like in The Wind Waker, Link can equip their weapons though Breath of the Wild allows him to keep them in his inventory. The game also introduces another undead variant of Bokoblin called Stalkoblin, which raise from the ground at night and will continue to regenerate unless all Stalkoblin skulls in the area are destroyed as a single skull can reanimate its headless comrades. Link can pick up and wield Bokoblin Arms that are left behind by defeated Stalkoblin who may wield these as weapons themselves. The game also introduces stronger Black Bokoblins and Silver Bokoblins. Cursed Bokoblins return but are depicted in Breath of the Wild as floating Stalkoblin skulls corrupted by Calamity Ganon's malice and are spawned from mouths located in pools of Malice.|$|R
40|$|It is very {{important}} that in managing food safety risks, the food, associated pathogen(s) and/or situations that lead to food borne illness are identified. It is also important to determine the magnitude of impact the risk has on public health (risk assessment). The microbial hazard Listeria monocytogenes has been associated with the vegetable cabbage (Brassica oleracea) and coleslaw an example of minimally processed vegetables with cabbage forming the predominant vegetable. This study was carried out to determine the prevalence and concentration of Listeria monocytogenes in fresh cabbage obtained from informal markets and commercially prepared ready-to-eat (RTE) coleslaw from food vendors in the Accra Metropolis. Detection and enumeration of L. monocytogenes was done using the 2009 edition of Health Protection Agency of Wales, UK standards for detection and enumeration of Listeria spp. To determine the magnitude of the impact of this hazard on public health, an exposure assessment through consumer survey was conducted with 300 vegetable consumers to determine how much (serving size) and how often (frequency/consumption rate) minimally processed vegetables such as coleslaw were consumed. Washing and/or decontamination of vegetables is an important step in managing the identified hazard (or risk). Thus the study determined the effectiveness of some common washing and decontamination methods on reducing the contamination level by Listeria monocytogenes in fresh cabbage. Results from the survey suggested that 55 % of respondents consumed about one <b>soup</b> <b>ladle</b> (approximately 80 g) of minimally processed vegetables including coleslaw on daily basis. Listeria monocytogenes was detected in 23 out of 24 samples of fresh cabbage (95. 8 % prevalence rate) obtained from informal markets and road side stalls. The prevalence rate for ready-to-eat coleslaw was 80. 1 %. Mean concentration of the pathogen in fresh cabbage was determined to be 29. 79 ± 0. 4 cfu/ 25 g of fresh cabbage; RTE coleslaw had 25. 51 ± 0. 5 cfu/ 25 g of RTE coleslaw. Risk assessment was conducted using the probabilistic approach. Data obtained from the detection and enumeration analysis were fitted into the risk model together with certain factors that influence the food beginning from farm till it reached the consumer (farm-to-fork). Using Monte Carlo simulations, the risk of ingesting Listeria monocytogenes on consuming commercially prepared coleslaw obtained from food vendors in Accra Metropolis was estimated as 90 %. Although some washing methods in terms of concentration of disinfectant, pH and temperature reduced contamination level by L. monocytogenes; log reductions were not statistically significant (P > 0. 05). Contact time between cabbage and washing solution (irrespective of concentration of disinfectant, pH and temperature) significantly reduced (P = 0. 044) contamination level by the hazard...|$|E
40|$|Malaria is a {{widespread}} parasitic disease in developing countries of the tropics and subtropics, infecting approximately 200 million people and causing over half a million deaths every year. The disease {{is caused by the}} protozoan Plasmodium and is transferred to humans through infective bites from female mosquitoes of the genus Anopheles. In order to reduce malaria transmission, measures of larval control have been implemented throughout the tropics. This includes usage of larvicides, source reduction by environmental or physiochemical manipulation as well elimination of larval habitats. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate differences in occurrence and densities of anopheline larvae by investigating the environmental characteristics of their habitat. The study was conducted in the Gamo Gofa Zone, Great Rift Valley, Ethiopia where a total of 26 sampling sites were chosen for larval sampling. Each sampling site was characterized according to a protocol and sampled for water chemistry analysis. Environmental variables studied include water depth, habitat size, distance to nearest dwelling, land use within a 10 m and 100 m from the sampling site and number of domestic animals within a 100 m. Physiochemical variables include water temperature, pH, electric conductivity (EC), total dissolved solids (TDS), dissolved oxygen (DO), turbidity and phosphate. Larval sampling was conducted on each site using a <b>soup</b> <b>ladle</b> dipper. The occurrence of anopheline larvae was statistically analysed using multiple logistic regressions, while using linear regression for analysing larval abundance at positive sites. Larval sampling resulted in a total of 1245 mosquito larvae, 567 anopheline and 678 non-anopheline. Of the anopheline larvae, 118 were analysed morphologically by microscopy which resulted in 117 belonging to An. gambiae complex and one An. garnhami. Of the 26 sites investigated, 16 were positive for anopheline larvae. All sampled river fringes and flood pools were positive for anopheline larvae whereas none were found in irrigation channels. Negative correlation for anopheline larval occurrence was obtained for both water depth and percentage of tall vegetation within 10 m radius of the sampling area. Anopheline larval abundance was only correlated, positively, with water temperature. The study concludes that water depth, temperature and percentage of tall riparian vegetation are important factors to consider when designing a control program for anopheline larvae. One should be aware of the fact that clearing riparian forest and other tall vegetation is likely to improve growing conditions for anopheline larvae. Furthermore, different habitat classes were either exclusively positive or negative for anopheline larvae, irrigation channels in the area not being suitable larval habitats during the time of measurements.  The authors suggest that more studies are needed, preferably on a larger set of sampling sites and over a longer period.
