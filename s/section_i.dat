40|$|Edith Piaf {{is famous}} for her chanson “Non, je ne regrette rien”.

In <b>section</b> 2 <b>I</b> formulate a principle, Desire Reflection, which is a version of Piaf’s maxim. In <b>section</b> 3 <b>I</b> argue that standard evidential decision theory violates this principle. In <b>section</b> 4 <b>I</b> argue that standard causal decison theory does not violate it. In <b>section</b> 5 <b>I</b> discuss whether a couple of variations on these standard decision theories satisfy Desire Reflection. In <b>section</b> 6 <b>I</b> make a suggestion for how causal decision theorists should pick what they consider to be the relevant causal situations. In <b>section</b> 7 <b>I</b> discuss the ‘If you’re so smart, why ain’t cha rich’ objection to causal decision theory, and dismiss it.

30|$|I shall {{argue that}} there is a {{fundamental}} flaw in the non-uniqueness theory, which is the assumption that there is no common set of criteria that all phonemic solutions can be measured against.
