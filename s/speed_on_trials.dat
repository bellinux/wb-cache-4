40|$|Passive {{avoidance}} l arning occupies acentral role in accounts ofdisinhibited behavior, anging from psychopaths ' persistent criminality (Hare, 1970) to extraverts ' gregariousness (Gray, 1972). To ex-plore {{the mechanism}} underlying passive avoidance deficits, we assessed {{the relation of}} extraversion, neuroticism, and response latency after punishment to passive avoidance l arning by using two successive go/no go discrimination tasks. The tasks were designed to examine two aspects of subjects' reactions to punishment: response <b>speed</b> <b>on</b> <b>trials</b> immediately following punishment (Experiment 1) and time to terminate punishment feedback between successive trials (i. e., reflectivity; Experi-ment 2). Consistent with previous findings, the results of Experiment 1 showed that extraverts com-mit more passive avoidance rrors than introverts do (Newman, Widom, & Nathan, 1985) and fail to pause following punished errors (Nichols & Newman, 1986). In Experiment 2, only neurotic extraverts displayed this pattern of performance differences. In both experiments, longer pausing following punishment predicted better learning from punishment for both introverts and extraverts. These results uggest that, {{in the presence of}} salient cues for reward, extraverts ' characteristic reac-tion to punishment interferes with processing punished errors and may contribute to their more general propensity for impulsive, nonreflective action...|$|E
