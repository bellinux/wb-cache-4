After he watched the Sati of his own sister-in-law, Ram Mohan Roy began campaigning for abolition of the practice in 1811.

On the death of his character in the episode, Kassianides said, [...] "I'm sad to see him go, [...] I'm happy to see <b>someone</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> get their comeuppance". Noting that the character was originally intended to be killed off in [...] "A Hen in the Wolf House", Kassianides felt that the way Bakshi and his relationships had developed throughout the season was [...] "fantastic" [...] and made the character's final sacrifice a much more [...] "beautiful" [...] death.|$|E

500|$|Michael Schur {{said another}} {{goal of the}} third season was to better {{demonstrate}} the comedic abilities of Rashida Jones, whose Ann Perkins character had often been portrayed as a straight man role to the other characters. This was done by placing Jones in a romantic relationship with Rob Lowe's character Chris Traeger, who is so overly-optimistic and seemingly-perfect that Ann has trouble finding any flaws and is taken aback by him. Schur said: [...] "Rashida is a very intelligent and attractive woman, and it's hard to knock <b>someone</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> off balance. And the way to knock that person off balance is to get Rob Lowe {{in a relationship with}} you." [...] Ann is further taken out of her element when it is revealed in [...] "Indianapolis" [...] that Chris broke up with her, but did so in such a positive and upbeat way that Ann did not realize it for several days. Afterward, Ann continues to move away her previous straight man role by going on a string of dates with many random men. During the final episodes of the season, Ann takes a part-time job at city hall as the health department public relations director, which Schur described as [...] "the natural full circle {{from the beginning of the}} season". This marked her process of getting over Chris and becoming a [...] "more mature person". Schur also said having Ann work at city hall would make it easier to integrate her into storylines with the other characters.|$|E
500|$|Parks and Recreation co-creator Michael Schur said Chris' {{habit of}} {{pointing}} {{directly into the}} faces of people he meets and repeating their names {{was one of the}} first elements of his character that the writing staff conceived. Chris' desire to live 150 years was inspired by Schur's wife, J. J. Philbin, who had read an article which stated that scientists believe the first human who will live 150 years has already been born, and felt it applied to the Chris Traeger character. Lowe's first day of filming on the series was his birthday (March 17, 2010), which was the day his kiss scene with Rashida Jones in [...] "The Master Plan" [...] was shot. Lowe said he loved his character's [...] "unrelenting enthusiasm" [...] and the fact that he is not a romantic lead, but rather a [...] "big, fat nerd". Parks and Recreation star Amy Poehler said of Chris Traeger: [...] "It's a really fun character to play against because what you’ll see start to happen is Chris doesn’t want to deliver any bad news, but he’s actually like the Bad News Bear." [...] Like much of the rest of the cast, Lowe occasionally improvises lines and actions for his character that are not included in the script. The writers hoped to use Ann Perkins' breakup with Chris, and the drastic changes in her behavior afterward, as a way of tapping into more comedic potential of her character rather than having her fill the role of straight man as she had in the past. Schur said: [...] "Ann is a very intelligent and attractive woman, and it's hard to knock <b>someone</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> off balance. And the way to knock that person off balance is to get Rob Lowe in a relationship with you." ...|$|E

2500|$|Cage is seen {{wearing a}} black hoodie {{throughout}} the series, which, beyond being practical for a character trying to lie low, was a nod to Trayvon Martin and Black Lives Matter. Colter said {{it was meant to}} invoke [...] "the idea that a black man in a hoodie isn’t necessarily a threat. He might just be a hero." [...] The series also features a political campaign with the slogan [...] "Keep Harlem Black", [...] "in the face of gentrification that threatens to homogenize Harlem’s cultural history." [...] Discussing these racial undertones, Coker asked, [...] "how does the presence of a bulletproof black man change the ecosystem of a neighborhood? Not just in terms of the street-level crime. How do the cops react to <b>someone</b> <b>like</b> <b>that?</b> What are the ripple effects of doing that? That’s one of the things I wanted to explore on the show". He added that [...] "when you’re a black superhero you can’t erase the notion that you’re black. If you’re black living in the community and you want to change things, {{there are going to be}} things that happen." [...] He did caution comparisons to recent headlines involving racial tension given when they had begun working on the show, stating that his focus had been on [...] "identity", which he saw as a common element in all black art.|$|E
2500|$|Most {{of these}} {{practices}} {{were accompanied by}} a loud utterance of ritual texts, which had their own semantics, symbolism and structure. Standing {{in the yard and}} facing the cloud, farmers would address the cloud himself, or hail, prodigy, the unholy power, ala, drowned or hanged persons (usually calling by name <b>someone</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> from their region), and others. People tried to deflect the horrific bringer of clouds from their fields, by scaring him off with something even more appalling that was allegedly present in their village. For example: [...] "Back! Back, ala! Here is a bigger ala, beware!" [...] or [...] "Hey, do not go, prodigy, on prodigy! We have a huge prodigy: here a girl bore a girl, a girl of nine years old! Do not go, prodigy, on prodigy: we have a huge prodigy!" [...] These texts often contained the idea of hail clouds as cattle, usually white: [...] "OSava and Nevena, turn back those white cattle! There is no pasture for them here! We only have ashes to put their eyes out!" [...] Uttering this, they would spill the ashes of the fire on which a česnica had been baked for Christmas, into the wind. (Sava and Nevena were a couple who drowned themselves in the Morava River for not having been allowed to marry.) Saint John and Saint Sava also appeared as leaders of cattle/clouds: [...] "Saint Sava, turn back your cattle from our village!" ...|$|E
