The size and shape of the dies in the extruder through which the pasta is pushed determine the shape that results. The pasta is then dried at a high temperature.|$|E

500|$|David Balls from Digital Spy noted Gaga's {{homage to}} her Italian-American {{roots in the}} video, but {{wondered}} if Gaga would [...] "overexpose herself" [...] with the video. Like his review of the single, Moralde found the video to be complimenting the simplistic composition of the song. He believed that with the videos for previous singles, [...] "Just Dance" [...] and [...] "Poker Face", Gaga's persona was established, but with the video for [...] "Eh, Eh" [...] she traversed her persona from the original Stefani Germanotta that she was born, to the character Lady Gaga. He explained: [...] "What's striking about it is how much it feels like Lady Gaga is playacting: the video has a nostalgic, dreamlike tone. Set in a stylized pastel 1950s Little Italy, the video plays heavily with stereotypical and historical shorthand as it displays moustached chefs, macho men in wife beaters, cute Vespas, and <b>spaghetti</b> <b>and</b> meatballs." [...] He noted that {{with all of these}} activities, Gaga created an essential fashion dollhouse, by playing feminine characters.|$|E

500|$|Cincinnati chili {{originated}} with immigrant restaurateurs from the Macedonian region {{who were trying}} to expand their customer base by moving beyond narrowly ethnic styles of cuisine. Tom and John Kiradjieff began serving a [...] "stew with traditional Mediterranean spices" [...] as a topping for hot dogs which they called [...] "coneys" [...] in 1922 at their hot dog stand located next to a burlesque theater called the Empress. Tom Kiradjieff used the sauce to modify a traditional Greek dish, speculated to have been pastitsio, moussaka or saltsa kima {{to come up with a}} dish he called chili spaghetti. He first developed a recipe calling for the spaghetti to be cooked in the chili but changed his method in response to customer requests and began serving the sauce as a topping, eventually adding grated cheese as a topping for both the chili <b>spaghetti</b> <b>and</b> the coneys, also in response to customer requests. To make ordering more efficient, the brothers created the [...] "way" [...] system of ordering. The style has since been copied and modified by many other restaurant proprietors, often fellow Greek and Macedonian immigrants who had worked at Empress restaurants before leaving to open their own chili parlors, often following the business model to the point of locating their restaurants adjacent to theaters.|$|E

They were so broke that they snuck out of a hotel room carrying their clothes in paper bags." [...] Reddy recalled: [...] "When we did eat, it was <b>spaghetti,</b> <b>and</b> we spent what little money we had on cockroach spray." [...] They left New York City for Chicago and Wald landed a job as talent coordinator at Mister Kelly's. While in Chicago, Reddy gained a reputation singing in local lounges – including Mister Kelly's – [...] and, in the spring of 1968, she landed a deal with Fontana Records, a division of major label Chicago-based Mercury Records.
