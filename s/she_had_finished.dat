5|$|Rowling {{revealed}} {{the title of}} Half-Blood Prince on her website on 29 June 2004. This was the title she had once considered for the second book, Chamber of Secrets, though she decided that the information disclosed belonged better in book six. On 21 December 2004, she announced <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>finished</b> writing it, along with the release date of 16 July. Bloomsbury unveiled the cover on 8 March 2005.|$|E
5|$|She was {{sensible}} how arduous a task it is {{to produce}} a truly excellent novel; and she roused her faculties to grapple with it. All her other works were produced with a rapidity, that did not give her powers time fully to expand. But this was written slowly and with mature consideration. She began it in several forms, which she successively rejected, after they were considerably advanced. She wrote {{many parts of the}} work again and again, and, when <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>finished</b> what she intended for the first part, she felt herself more urgently stimulated to revise and improve what she had written, than to proceed, with constancy of application, in the parts that were to follow.|$|E
5|$|The {{title of}} the seventh and final Harry Potter book was {{announced}} on 21 December 2006 as Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.

Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows was released on 21 July 2007 (0:01 BST) and broke its predecessor's record as the fastest-selling book of all time. It sold 11million copies in the first day of release in the United Kingdom and United States. The book's last chapter was one of the earliest things she wrote in the entire series.|$|E

25|$|She was a {{precocious}} child, — {{so much so}} that, {{on being}} asked, she once confessed she had no more recollection of learning to read either French or English than of learning to talk. As soon as she could walk, her mother said, she was following her about, book in hand, begging to be taught to read stories for herself. She read them soon to so much purpose that before she was five years old, <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>finished</b> the Bible, being rewarded by a polyglot Testament for the feat, and had also read Plutarch, which at every subsequent reading gave her an equal pleasure, and at seven, had mastered Racine in the original, upon which she began the study of Latin with her father.|$|E
25|$|Grande's debut studio album Yours Truly was {{released}} on September 3, 2013, and was met with critical acclaim. Later that month, {{in an interview with}} Rolling Stone, Grande stated that she had begun writing and working on her second studio album and had already completed two songs. Recording sessions began in October 2013 with Grande working with previous producers from her debut album Harmony Samuels and Tommy Brown. Grande was initially aiming at releasing the album around February 2014. In January 2014, Grande confirmed she had been working with new producers Ryan Tedder, Savan Kotecha, Benny Blanco, Key Wane and Max Martin. Grande stated in late February that she wanted to name her album after a song <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>finished</b> that weekend that is very honest and makes her cry.|$|E
25|$|In {{the morning}} of 8 April 1940, {{on the eve of}} the German {{invasion}} of Norway, Sæl was docked at the Marineholmen naval base in Bergen between patrol missions. By 02:30 on 9 April <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>finished</b> coaling, having been ordered to make war preparations the previous day, and moved south towards her blocking position in the Lerøy area in the approaches to Bergen. Due to a lack of information as the position of the intruding German forces she sailed on a collision course with the German Kampfgruppe 3. When the German ships were spotted by Sæl they were at such close range that the Norwegians had to make evasive manoeuvres to avoid a collision and were unable to launch a torpedo. As the Kriegsmarine ships passed her at only 10–15 metres distance, Sæl turned around and gave chase in the hope of catching up with the Germans and get within range for a torpedo shot. As dawn was soon approaching Sæls commander, Fenrik (Ensign) L. Gulbrandsen, decided to disengage and temporarily place his ship in cover behind the Bratholmen islet.|$|E

25|$|From {{that time}} she was an indefatigable reader, troubling her parents only by her devotion to books {{rather than to the}} play natural to her age. Her father had a {{considerable}} library, the contents of every book in which she made her own, always preferring history, — before <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>finished</b> her 10th year being acquainted with Hume, Gibbon, Alison, and kindred writers. At this point, she was sent away to school. Her father and mother, seeing the intellect for which they were responsible, took all possible pains with her education, and fortunately her physical strength was sufficient to carry her through an uninterrupted course in different academies and a series of lessons with masters at home. She cared more for languages and natural sciences, in which she was very proficient, than for most other studies, and took no especial pleasure in mathematics. Booth's superior education was not given her at school, where she learned less than she did by herself, for she showed very young that disdain of obstacles and that taste for literature which were two strong points in her character. She was only a tiny child when she taught herself French. A stray French primer fell into her hands, and she became interested in spelling out the French words and comparing them with the English ones, and continued to study in this way. Later she acquired German in the same manner, and being self-taught, and not hearing either language, she never learned to speak them, but made herself so proficient in them in after years that she could translate almost any book from either German or French at sight, reading them aloud in English.|$|E

500|$|Moore {{moved to}} New York City after graduating, {{and worked as}} a waitress. After {{registering}} her stage name with Actors' Equity, she began her career in 1985 with off-Broadway theatre. Her first screen role came in 1985, in an episode of the soap opera The Edge of Night. Her break came the following year, when she joined the cast of As the World Turns. Playing the dual roles of half-sisters Frannie and Sabrina Hughes, she found this intensive work to be an important learning experience, and she said of it fondly: [...] "I gained confidence and learned to take responsibility." [...] Moore performed on the show until 1988, when she won a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Ingenue in a Drama Series. Before leaving As the World Turns, she had a role in the 1987 CBS miniseries I'll Take Manhattan.

The actress returned intermittently to television over the next three years, appearing in the TV movies Money, Power, Murder (1989), The Last to Go (1991), and Cast a Deadly Spell (1991).|$|E
500|$|Numerous {{news outlets}} started {{reporting}} on the concert tour supporting Rebel Heart. The Italian newspaper Torino Today reported Madonna was planning on returning to Turin with the tour on November 20 and 21, 2015. The tour was called the Rebel Heart Tour with appearances in North America, Europe, Asia and Oceania, beginning on September 9, 2015. Billboard reported that the tour would use arenas only, and would visit cities where Madonna had not performed previously. The initial itinerary had 25–30 shows in North America and 20–25 shows in Europe, with additional dates being revealed later on. This tour was the singer's first visit to Australia in more than 20 years, having last toured there with The Girlie Show World Tour in 1993, and her first time performing in New Zealand and the Philippines. The tour's main stage was elevated and set {{up at the end}} of each arena, with a long catwalk extending from its middle to the center of the space. At the middle of the catwalk there was a circular stage, while the far end of the pathway ended in a heart-shaped stage. Designers working on the tour's wardrobe included: Jeremy Scott for Moschino, Alessandro Michele for Gucci and Alexander Wang, along with Fausto Puglisi, Prada, Miu Miu, Swarovski, Lebanese designer Nicolas Jebran, as well as Madonna's longtime collaborator Arianne Phillips. The tour generated positive critical reviews, many noting that Madonna appeared to be in a happy mood onstage. It grossed a total of $169.8 million from 82 shows, with over 1.045 million ticket sales. In March 2016, Madonna announced that the Sydney, Australia shows of March 19 and 20, 2016 would be filmed for a tour DVD release. Danny B. Tull and Nathan Rissman, who had both worked on Madonna's previous feature and tour films, will be directing it.
