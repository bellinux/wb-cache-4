5|$|Throughout history {{mandrake}}s (Mandragora officinarum) {{have been}} highly sought after for their reputed aphrodisiac properties. However, {{the roots of}} the mandrake plant also contain large quantities of the alkaloid <b>scopolamine,</b> which, at high doses, acts as a central nervous system depressant, and makes the plant highly toxic to herbivores. <b>Scopolamine</b> was later found to be medicinally used for pain management prior to and during labor; in smaller doses it is used to prevent motion sickness. One of the most well-known medicinally valuable terpenes is an anticancer drug, taxol, isolated from the bark of the Pacific yew, Taxus brevifolia, in the early 1960s.|$|E
5|$|Those {{taking more}} than 4mg per day have an {{increased}} potential for dependence. This medication may cause withdrawal symptoms upon abrupt withdrawal or rapid tapering, which in some cases {{have been known to}} cause seizures, as well as marked delirium similar to that produced by the anticholinergic tropane alkaloids of Datura (<b>scopolamine</b> and atropine). The discontinuation of this medication may also cause a reaction called rebound anxiety.|$|E
25|$|Other {{experiments}} involved heroin, morphine, temazepam (used under {{code name}} MKSEARCH), mescaline, psilocybin, <b>scopolamine,</b> cannabis, alcohol, and sodium pentothal.|$|E
25|$|It is also marketed in {{combination}} with <b>scopolamine</b> as Novalona and {{in combination}} with alanine as Pausafrent T.|$|E
25|$|The first {{clinical}} {{use of the}} drug was documented in 1917, the year after it was first developed. It was first introduced to the US market in May 1939. In early 1928, Merck introduced a combination product containing <b>scopolamine,</b> oxycodone, and ephedrine under the German initials for the ingredients SEE, which was later renamed Scophedal (<b>SCOpolamine</b> ePHEDrine and eukodAL). This combination is essentially an oxycodone analogue of the morphine-based ´twilight sleep´, with ephedrine added to reduce circulatory and respiratory effects.|$|E
25|$|Adjuvant analgesics, {{also called}} {{atypical}} analgesics, include nefopam, orphenadrine, pregabalin, gabapentin, cyclobenzaprine, hyoscine (<b>scopolamine),</b> {{and other drugs}} possessing anticonvulsant, anticholinergic, and/or antispasmodic properties, {{as well as many}} other drugs with CNS actions. These drugs are used along with analgesics to modulate and/or modify the action of opioids when used against pain, especially of neuropathic origin.|$|E
25|$|For {{dentistry}} and obstetrics as well {{as other}} surgeries and procedures and acute pain situations like accidents, hydroxyzine is useful as a first line anxiolytic and opioid adjunct because it lacks both antagonism and synergy with benzodiazepines and <b>scopolamine,</b> allowing either of these agents to be used simultaneously or later in the procedure if need be.|$|E
25|$|Acetylcholine {{has been}} implicated in {{learning}} and memory in several ways. The anticholinergic drug, <b>scopolamine,</b> impairs acquisition of new information in humans and animals. In animals, disruption of the supply of acetylcholine to the neocortex impairs the learning of simple discrimination tasks, comparable to the acquisition of factual information and disruption of the supply of acetylcholine to the hippocampus and adjacent cortical areas produces forgetting comparable to anterograde amnesia in humans.|$|E
25|$|Reportedly {{the mixture}} was {{ground to a}} paste, boiled in water, and {{administered}} as a drink. After 2 to 4 hours the patient would become insensitive to pain and then lapse into unconsciousness. Depending on the dosage, they might remain unconscious for 6–24 hours. The active ingredients in tsūsensan were <b>scopolamine,</b> hyoscyamine, atropine, aconitine and angelicotoxin. When consumed in sufficient quantity, tsūsensan produced a state of general anesthesia and skeletal muscle paralysis.|$|E
25|$|Bartolomeu Anania {{was among}} the last people to be sentenced in {{connection}} with the Burning Pyre movement. Tried separately, and probably drugged on <b>scopolamine,</b> he agreed to become a Securitate informant. Vasile Voiculescu was the first of Tudor's spiritual followers to be granted a reprieve, in 1962. He was severely weakened by repeated torture, terminally ill with Pott disease, and only survived into 1963. The other Burning Pyre affiliates were all released from prison in 1964, when the communist regime enforced a set of liberalization measures.|$|E
25|$|Like {{many members}} of the Solanaceae, species of Mandragora contain highly biologically active {{alkaloids}}, tropane alkaloids in particular. Hanuš et al. reviewed the phytochemistry of Mandragora species. More than 80 substances have been identified; their paper gives the detailed chemical structure of 37 of them. The different parts of the plant contain different proportions and concentrations of alkaloids, with the roots having the highest concentration. Alkaloids present include atropine, apoatropine, belladonnine, cuscohygrine, hyoscyamine, <b>scopolamine</b> (hyoscine), 3α-tigloyloxytropane and 3α,6β-ditigloyloxytropane. M.caulescens and M.turcomanica are also reported to contain anisodamine.|$|E
25|$|Within the {{hospital}} were operating rooms, kitchens, baths, a dispensary, latrines, a mortuary and herb gardens, as doctors {{relied heavily on}} herbs for drugs. The medici could treat any wound received in battle, {{as long as the}} patient was alive. They operated or otherwise treated with scalpels, hooks, levers, drills, probes, forceps, catheters and arrow-extractors on patients anesthetized with morphine (opium poppy extract) and <b>scopolamine</b> (henbane extract). Instruments were boiled before use. Wounds were washed in vinegar and stitched. Broken bones were placed in traction. There is, however, evidence of wider concerns. A vaginal speculum suggests gynecology was practiced, and an anal speculum implies knowledge that the size and condition of internal organs accessible through the orifices was an indication of health. They could extract eye cataracts with a special needle. Operating room amphitheaters indicate that medical education was ongoing. Many have proposed that the knowledge and practices of the medici were not exceeded until the 20th century CE.|$|E
25|$|Doxepin {{should not}} be used within 14days of using a monoamine oxidase {{inhibitor}} (MAOIs) such as phenelzine due to the potential for hypertensive crisis or serotonin syndrome to develop. Its use in those taking potent CYP2D6 inhibitors such as fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, duloxetine, bupropion, and quinidine is recommended against due to the potential for its accumulation in the absence of full CYP2D6 catalytic activity. Hepatic enzyme inducers such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, and barbiturates are advised against in patients receiving TCAs like doxepin due to the potential for problematically rapid metabolism of doxepin to occur in these individuals. Sympathomimetic agents may have their effects potentiated by TCAs like doxepin. Doxepin also may potentiate the adverse effects of anticholinergic agents such as benztropine, atropine and hyoscine (<b>scopolamine).</b> Tolazamide, when used in conjunction with doxepin has been associated with a case of severe hypoglycaemia in a type II diabetic individual. Cimetidine may influence the absorption of doxepin. Alcohol may potentiate some of the CNS depressant effects of doxepin. Antihypertensive agents may have their effects mitigated by doxepin. Cotreatment with CNS depressants such as the benzodiazepines can cause additive CNS depression. Co-treatment with thyroid hormones may also increase the potential for adverse reactions.|$|E
25|$|Medical {{treatment}} with anti-vertigo medications {{may be considered}} in acute, severe exacerbation of BPPV, {{but in most cases}} are not indicated. These primarily include drugs of the anti-histamine and anti-cholinergic class, such as meclizine and hyoscine butylbromide (<b>scopolamine)</b> respectively. The medical management of vestibular syndromes has become increasingly popular over the last decade, and numerous novel drug therapies (including existing drugs with new indications) have emerged for the treatment of vertigo/dizziness syndromes. These drugs vary considerably in their mechanisms of action, with many of them being receptor- or ion channel-specific. Among them are betahistine or dexamethasone/gentamicin for the treatment of Ménière's disease, carbamazepine/oxcarbazepine for the treatment of paroxysmal dysarthria and ataxia in multiple sclerosis, metoprolol/topiramate or valproic acid/tricyclic antidepressant for the treatment of vestibular migraine, and 4-aminopyridine for the treatment of episodic ataxia type 2 and both downbeat and upbeat nystagmus. These drug therapies offer symptomatic treatment, and do not affect the disease process or resolution rate. Medications may be used to suppress symptoms during the positioning maneuvers if the patient's symptoms are severe and intolerable. More dose-specific studies are required, however, {{in order to determine the}} most effective drug(s) for both acute symptom relief and long-term remission of the condition.|$|E
500|$|Alkaloids are bitter-tasting chemicals, very {{widespread}} in nature, and often toxic, {{found in many}} medicinal plants. There are several classes with different modes of action as drugs, both recreational and pharmaceutical. Medicines of different classes include atropine, <b>scopolamine,</b> and hyoscyamine (all from nightshade), the traditional medicine berberine (from plants such as Berberis and Mahonia), caffeine (Coffea), cocaine (Coca), ephedrine (Ephedra), morphine (opium poppy), [...] nicotine (tobacco), reserpine (Rauwolfia serpentina), quinidine and quinine (Cinchona), vincamine (Vinca minor), and vincristine (Catharanthus roseus).|$|E
500|$|After his ennoblement, Linnaeus {{continued}} {{teaching and}} writing. His reputation had {{spread over the}} world, and he corresponded with many different people. For example, Catherine II of Russia sent him seeds from her country. He also corresponded with Giovanni Antonio Scopoli, [...] "the Linnaeus of the Austrian Empire", who was a doctor and a botanist in Idrija, Duchy of Carniola (nowadays Slovenia). Scopoli communicated all of his research, findings, and descriptions (for example of the olm and the dormouse, two little animals hitherto unknown to Linnaeus). Linnaeus greatly respected Scopoli and showed great interest in his work. He named a solanaceous genus, Scopolia, the source of <b>scopolamine,</b> after him, {{but because of the}} great distance between them, they never met.|$|E
500|$|Most of {{the scenes}} {{featuring}} Schnauz on plasterer's stilts were shot using stuntmen. In the scene where Scully meets Schnauz, a safety cable was attached to Vince to keep him upright on the stilts and was edited out in post-production. Ken Hawryliw created the lobotomy instrument Schnauz used from scratch when he was unsuccessful with his attempts to borrow one from a doctor or hospital. The title of the episode, [...] "Unruhe", is the German word for [...] "unrest" [...] or [...] "anxiety". When Scully talks in German to Schnauz, she says [...] "Ich habe keine Unruhe" [...] (literally [...] "I do not have anxiety"). The episode prominently features the drug <b>scopolamine</b> which can cause people to quickly become unconscious, and twilight sleep, which is a condition that can render people unconscious following great moments of pain.|$|E
500|$|The {{girlfriend of}} Mazeroski's son, Rick, Katie, {{is the latest}} to be found, and her blood is found to contain an unknown {{alkaloid}} substance {{and high levels of}} <b>scopolamine,</b> a controlled substance. This appears to link her to Odin, a former doctor. Meanwhile, the agents meet an old man who points to a pair of men injecting growth serum into cattle, which he believes is the cause of the trouble. That night, local doctor Jerrold Larson is killed in a plane crash. An investigation of the site turns up shipping orders that trace back to the kidnapped teens. One of the men injecting the cows is murdered by the Crew Cut Man. The other, a peeping tom named Gerd Thomas, is revealed to be the kidnapper after the agents find a hidden supply of videotapes in the home of one of the victims. Thomas claims that Larson had been turning the children into [...] "monsters" [...] with the drugs he had been injecting in them, which he claims to be unknown.|$|E
500|$|At {{a meeting}} of the American Gynecological Society in 1920, DeLee sparked {{controversy}} when he presented a paper advocating for the use of a systematic approach to childbirth for physicians, including the use of forceps and episiotomy even in women who had no labor complications. DeLee's [...] "prophylactic forceps operation" [...] consisted of several steps: <b>scopolamine</b> injections in the first stage of labor, ether anesthesia in the next stage, then episiotomy and forceps delivery. Ergot was used in the subsequent manual extraction of the placenta. DeLee reasoned that the episiotomy prevented perineal tears which could cause complications like uterine prolapse and vesicovaginal fistula. He said that the early use of forceps would avoid pressure from the pelvic bones against a baby's head, thus preventing complications like epilepsy and cerebral palsy; DeLee said that fatal complications occurred in 4–5% of labors managed with the traditional conservative approach. Though DeLee said that such interventions should only be carried out by a well-equipped physician specialist, John Whitridge Williams and other prominent obstetricians criticized DeLee sharply. They felt that DeLee was being too aggressive by removing a baby before complications occurred; DeLee's colleagues preferred to be conservative and to manage complications as they arose.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Scopolamine</b> is {{effective}} and is sometimes {{used in the}} form of transdermal patches (1.5mg) or as a newer tablet form (0.4mg). [...] The selection of a transdermal patch or <b>scopolamine</b> tablet is determined by a doctor after consideration of the patient's age, weight, and length of treatment time required.|$|E
2500|$|Anticholinergic agents such as benztropine, hyoscine (<b>scopolamine)</b> and atropine, {{because the}} two might {{exacerbate}} each other's anticholinergic effects, including paralytic ileus and tachycardia ...|$|E
2500|$|Du Toit {{cites the}} studies of Lydia Cabrera on the {{religious}} and healing role of indigenous medicinal plants, and Jose Gallo on the 900-page compilation of folk medicine, and also mentions that with the 31 herbs prescribed as bronchodilators, only Datura candida was effective, due to its contents of <b>scopolamine</b> and atropine in the leaves. Lemongrass or [...] is used for low blood pressure and anti-inflammatory effects. Thyme tea and castor oil are used to speed the delivery of babies and the broomweed (Corchorus siliquosus) induces the quick expulsion of the placenta. Herbs are also {{used to create a}} trance possession using the hallucinogenic properties of Datura metel and Datura stramonium (both have <b>scopolamine</b> and atropine, causing amnesia), the psychoactive ingredients from the cane toad (Bufo marinus).|$|E
2500|$|Dennett co-founded the Twilight Sleep Association 1913, which {{advocated}} {{the use of}} <b>scopolamine</b> and morphine to allow women to have painless childbirth. [...] Statistics showed that twilight sleep reduced infant mortality {{and the risk of}} injury and infection, due to reduced use of forceps. [...] She served as acting president until 1914, then as vice president.|$|E
2500|$|The active {{ingredients}} in tsūsensan are <b>scopolamine,</b> hyoscyamine, atropine, aconitine and angelicotoxin. When consumed in sufficient quantity, tsūsensan produces {{a state of}} general anesthesia and skeletal muscle paralysis. Shutei Nakagawa (1773–1850), {{a close friend of}} Hanaoka, wrote a small pamphlet titled [...] "Mayaku-ko" [...] ("narcotic powder") in 1796. Although the original manuscript was lost in a fire in 1867, this brochure described the current state of Hanaoka's research on general anesthesia.|$|E
2500|$|Their {{disappearance}} led {{the police}} at Scotland Yard to perform another three searches of the house. During {{the fourth and}} final search, they found the torso of a human body buried under the brick floor of the basement. William Willcox (later Sir William Willcox, senior scientific analyst to the Home Office) found traces of the calming drug <b>scopolamine</b> in the torso parts [...] The corpse was identified by a piece of skin from its abdomen; the head, limbs, and skeleton were never recovered.|$|E
2500|$|A common {{mnemonic}} used {{to describe}} the physiologic manifestations of atropine overdose is: [...] "hot as a hare, blind as a bat, dry as a bone, red as a beet, and mad as a hatter". [...] These associations reflect the specific changes of warm, dry skin from decreased sweating, blurry vision, decreased sweating/lacrimation, vasodilation, and central nervous system effects on muscarinic receptors, type 4 and 5. [...] This set of symptoms is known as anticholinergic toxidrome, and may also be caused by other drugs with anticholinergic effects, such as hyoscine hydrobromide (<b>scopolamine),</b> diphenhydramine, phenothiazine antipsychotics and benztropine.|$|E
2500|$|Chlordiazepoxide in {{laboratory}} mice studies impairs latent learning. [...] Benzodiazepines impair learning and memory via their action on benzodiazepine receptors, which causes a dysfunction in the cholinergic neuronal system in mice. It was later found that <b>scopolamine</b> impairment in learning {{was caused by}} an increase in benzodiazapine/GABA activity (and that benzodiazepines were not associated with the cholinergic system). In tests of various benzodiazepine compounds, chlordiazepoxide was found to cause the most profound reduction in the turnover of 5HT (serotonin) in rats. Serotonin is closely involved in regulating mood and {{may be one of the}} causes of feelings of depression in rats using chlordiazepoxide or other benzodiazepines.|$|E
2500|$|Drug-induced amnesia is {{intentionally}} {{caused by}} injection of an amnestic drug {{to help a}} patient forget surgery or medical procedures, particularly those not performed under full anesthesia, or likely to be particularly traumatic. Such drugs are {{also referred to as}} [...] "premedicants". Most commonly, a 2-halogenated benzodiazepine such as midazolam or flunitrazepam is the drug of choice, although other strongly amnestic drugs such as propofol or <b>scopolamine</b> may also be used for this application. Memories of the short time-frame in which the procedure was performed are permanently lost or at least substantially reduced, but once the drug wears off, memory is no longer affected.|$|E
2500|$|Over-the-counter and {{prescription}} medications are readily available, such as Dramamine/Gravol (dimenhydrinate), <b>scopolamine,</b> Bonine/Antivert (meclizine), promethazine, cyclizine, and Stugeron (cinnarizine). Cinnarizine {{is not available}} in the United States, as it is not approved by the FDA. As these medications often have side effects, anyone involved in high-risk activities while at sea (such as SCUBA divers) must evaluate the risks versus the benefits. Promethazine is especially known to cause drowsiness, which is often counteracted by ephedrine in a combination known as [...] "the Coast Guard cocktail.". There are special considerations {{to be aware of}} when the common anti-motion sickness medications are used in the military setting where performance must be maintained at a high level.|$|E
2500|$|Neuromodulation {{exists in}} the {{olfactory}} system and is responsible for neural plasticity and behavioural change in both mammals and insects. In the context of olfactory memory, neuromodulators regulate storage of information {{in a way that}} maintains the significance of the olfactory experience. These systems are highly dependent on norepinephrine and acetylcholine, which affect both implicit and explicit memory. Studies involving the noradrenergic system of mice demonstrate elimination of habitual learning when areas involving this system are lesioned, and subsequent restoration of habitual learning abilities when noradrenaline is injected into the olfactory bulb. [...] The importance of cholinergic systems has been demonstrated in studies of rats and the effects of <b>scopolamine,</b> with acetylcholine being involved in initial learning stages and more specifically in the reduction of interference between stored memories.|$|E
2500|$|Partly {{because of}} its muscle-activating function, but also {{because of its}} {{functions}} in the autonomic nervous system and brain, a large number of important drugs exert their effects by altering cholinergic transmission. [...] Numerous venoms and toxins produced by plants, animals, and bacteria, as well as chemical nerve agents such as Sarin, cause harm by inactivating or hyperactivating muscles via their influences on the neuromuscular junction. Drugs that act on muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, such as atropine, can be poisonous in large quantities, but in smaller doses they are commonly used to treat certain heart conditions and eye problems. [...] <b>Scopolamine,</b> which acts mainly on muscarinic receptors in the brain, can cause delirium and amnesia. The addictive qualities of nicotine are derived from its effects on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the brain.|$|E
2500|$|Adaptation to {{weightlessness}} involves {{not just}} the Sensory-motor coupling functions, but some autonomic nervous system functions as well. Sleep disorders and orthostatic intolerance are also common during and after spaceflight. There is no hydrostatic pressure in a weightless environment. As a result, the redistribution of body fluids toward the upper body causes a decrease in leg volume, which may affect muscle viscosity and compliance. An increase in intracranial pressure may also be responsible for a decrease in near visual acuity. In addition, muscle mass and strength both decrease {{as a result of}} the reduced loading in weightlessness. Moreover, approximately 70% of astronauts experience space motion sickness to some degree during the first days. [...] The drugs commonly used to combat motion sickness, such as <b>scopolamine</b> and promethazine, have soporific effects. These factors can lead to chronic fatigue. The challenge of integrative space medicine and physiology is to investigate the adaptation of the human body to spaceflight as a whole, and not just as the sum of body parts because all body functions are connected and interact with each other.|$|E
2500|$|Their {{disappearance}} led {{the police}} at Scotland Yard to perform another three searches of the house. During {{the fourth and}} final search, they found {{the remains of a}} human body, buried under the brick floor of the basement. Sir Bernard Spilsbury found traces of the calming drug <b>scopolamine.</b> The corpse was identified by a piece of skin from its abdomen; the head, limbs, and skeleton were never recovered. Crippen and Le Neve fled across the Atlantic on the Montrose, with le Neve disguised as a boy. Captain Henry George Kendall recognised the fugitives and, just before steaming out of range of the land-based transmitters, had telegraphist Lawrence Ernest Hughes send a wireless telegram to the British authorities: [...] "Have strong suspicions that Crippen London cellar murderer and accomplice are among saloon passengers. Mustache [...] taken off growing beard. Accomplice dressed as boy. Manner and build undoubtedly a girl." [...] Had Crippen travelled 3rd class, he would have probably escaped Kendall's notice. Dew boarded a faster White Star liner, the , arrived in Quebec, Canada ahead of Crippen, and contacted the Canadian authorities.|$|E
2500|$|While imprisoned, Woodcock {{underwent}} {{various forms}} of psychiatric therapy, including LSD treatments when they were popular in the 1960s. He was also given other personality-breaking drugs: <b>scopolamine,</b> sodium amytal, methedrine and dexamyl. He was subjected to [...] "dyads" [...] — a personality-breaking therapy in which inmates challenged each other's belief systems — which inmates referred to as [...] "The Hundred-Day Hate-In". Dyads were developed in the late 1950s to early 1960s by a Harvard psychologist and former CIA interrogation and psychological warfare expert, Henry A. Murray. In the 1960s, one of Murray's volunteer personality-destruction subjects had been a young Harvard student—Ted Kaczynski, the future Unabomber. Woodcock did not respond well to these treatments, and was not an ideal prisoner. He engaged in homosexual acts and exploited his fellow inmates, who were often less intelligent or less sane than he was. He formed an imaginary gang, the Brotherhood. He convinced inmates that he had contact with the mythical group on the outside, and {{that in order to}} be initiated, inmates had to perform oral sex on him and bring him gifts of cigarettes.|$|E
50|$|<b>Scopolamine</b> enters {{breast milk}} by secretion. Although no human studies exist to {{document}} the safety of <b>scopolamine</b> while nursing, the manufacturer recommends that caution be taken if <b>scopolamine</b> is administered to a breastfeeding woman.|$|E
