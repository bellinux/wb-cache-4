5|$|In Virginia, {{the storm}} {{produced}} a storm tide of 3.6feet (1.1m) above normal in Norfolk. Sustained winds peaked at 60mph (95km/h) in Langley Air Force Base, while gusts reached 71mph (114km/h) in Norfolk. The bands {{of the storm}} spawned an F1 tornado near Portsmouth and Chesapeake, damaging twelve homes and downing hundreds of trees. Damage from the tornado amounted to $250,000 (1971USD, $ USD). Rainfall from Doria was moderate, peaking at 6.44inches (164mm) at a location 2miles (3.2km) south-southeast of Halifax. One person drowned in Alexandria when she fell into a draining ditch. The storm severely damaged a large warehouse in Norfolk, as well. Damage in Virginia totaled $375,000 (1971USD, $ USD). Floodwaters from Doria clogged sewage systems near Norfolk, Virginia with <b>sand</b> <b>and</b> <b>silt.</b> This forced the sewage to be dumped into the Chesapeake Bay, resulting in the closure of several beaches for days.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the bones}} {{collected}} were encased in siltstone nodules surrounded by fine <b>sand</b> <b>and</b> <b>silt,</b> with the rest lying in clay. The bones were disarticulated and scattered over a 5 x 2m (17 x 8ft) area, but most were not far from their natural positions. The position of some bones was disturbed by a bulldozer, and some were broken by mechanical equipment before they were collected. Preparing the specimen was difficult, due to the hardness of the siltstone matrix {{and the presence of}} siderite; acid preparation was attempted, but most of the matrix was removed mechanically. The skeleton consisted of partial skull bones; teeth; cervical, dorsal and caudal vertebrae; ribs; a sternum; coracoids; arm and hand bones; claws; hip bones, and leg bones. The original specimen number was BMNH R9951, but it was later re-catalogued as NHMUK VP R9951.|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} sieve sizes are available. The {{boundary}} between <b>sand</b> <b>and</b> <b>silt</b> is arbitrary. According to the Unified Soil Classification System, a #4 sieve (4 openings per inch) having 4.75mm opening size separates sand from gravel and a #200 sieve with an 0.075mm opening separates sand from silt and clay. According to the British standard, 0.063mm is {{the boundary between}} <b>sand</b> <b>and</b> <b>silt,</b> and 2mm is the boundary between sand and gravel.|$|E

25|$|Ground shaking {{triggered}} soil liquefaction in a subsurface {{layer of}} sand, producing differential lateral and vertical movement in an overlying carapace of unliquified <b>sand</b> <b>and</b> <b>silt.</b> This mode of ground failure, termed lateral spreading, {{is a principal}} cause of liquefaction-related earthquake damage.|$|E
25|$|Silts, sands and gravels are {{classified}} by their size, and hence they may {{consist of a}} variety of minerals. Owing to the stability of quartz compared to other rock minerals, quartz is the most common constituent of <b>sand</b> <b>and</b> <b>silt.</b> Mica, and feldspar are other common minerals present in sands and silts. The mineral constituents of gravel may be more {{similar to that of the}} parent rock.|$|E
25|$|Fine-grained <b>sand</b> <b>and</b> <b>silt</b> {{mixed with}} sandy lime were laid down as sediments {{on top of}} the Entrada Sandstone, forming the locally 0 to 175foot (53m) thick erosion-resistant Curtis Formation. A green iron {{potassium}} silicate called glauconite in the Curtis indicates it was deposited in a shallow sea. Outcrops of the light grayish-green Curtis {{can be seen as a}} capstone in the northern section of the park while it is locally absent in the southern part.|$|E

25|$|It was {{concluded}} that the bridge collapsed due to extensive scour under pier three. The foundation of the pier was bearing on erodible soil, consisting of layers of gravel, <b>sand</b> <b>and</b> <b>silt,</b> inter-bedded with folded and tilted till. This allowed high velocity flood waters to penetrate the bearing stratum. The area left around the footing was not filled with riprap stone, but instead was back-filled with erodible soil and topped off with dry riprap. Riprap protection, inspection, and maintenance were determined to have been inadequate.|$|E
25|$|In unconsolidated aquifers, {{groundwater}} {{is produced}} from pore spaces between particles of gravel, <b>sand,</b> <b>and</b> <b>silt.</b> If the aquifer is confined by low-permeability layers, the reduced water {{pressure in the}} sand and gravel causes slow drainage of water from the adjoining confining layers. If these confining layers are composed of compressible silt or clay, the loss of water to the aquifer reduces the water pressure in the confining layer, causing it to compress from the weight of overlying geologic materials. In severe cases, this compression can be observed on the ground surface as subsidence. Unfortunately, much of the subsidence from groundwater extraction is permanent (elastic rebound is small). Thus, the subsidence is not only permanent, but the compressed aquifer has a permanently reduced capacity to hold water.|$|E
25|$|Quicksand forms {{when water}} {{saturates}} {{an area of}} loose sand and the ordinary sand is agitated. When the water trapped in the batch of sand cannot escape, it creates liquefied soil that can no longer support weight. Quicksand can be formed by standing or (upwards) flowing underground water (as from an underground spring), or by earthquakes. In the case of flowing underground water, {{the force of the}} water flow opposes the force of gravity, causing the granules of sand to be more buoyant. In the case of earthquakes, the shaking force can increase the pressure of shallow groundwater, liquefying <b>sand</b> <b>and</b> <b>silt</b> deposits. In both cases, the liquefied surface loses strength, causing buildings or other objects on that surface to sink or fall over.|$|E

25|$|The wide {{valley of}} the Loire {{is made up of}} a mixture of <b>sand</b> <b>and</b> <b>silt</b> that is carried along by the river. The slopes on either side are made up of a mixture of clays and other {{elements}} that have come down from the plateau areas. The wine-growing area is mainly located on the two halves of the plateau and, occasionally, on the upper slopes to either side of the valley. The plateau areas are covered in a thin layer of clay-sand silt that has been deposited there by the wind. Beneath this silt lies a polygenetic puddingstone dating from the Upper Eocene Age, mixed with varicoloured clays and small pebbles of rolled silex, Jurassic cherts and quartz grains. The soils of this wine-growing terroir can be carbonate, overlying tuffeau stone on the higher slopes, or, more frequently, silicate and fairly heavy, overlying sands and clay gravels.|$|E
25|$|Later in Permian time, the Kaibab Sea {{invaded the}} land and laid down a limey ooze that later lithified to form the locally up to 200foot (60m) thick Kaibab Limestone. This is the same light gray to white {{formation}} that rims the Grand Canyon to the southwest (see Geology of the Grand Canyon area). The lower parts of the Kaibab were interbedded with <b>sand</b> <b>and</b> <b>silt</b> before its main component, limestone, was converted into chert-rich dolomite by the intrusion of magnesium. The formation contains fossils of invertebrates including brachiopods, bryozoans, crinoids, gastropods, and pelecypods. Outcrops of the cliff-forming Kaibab in Capitol Reef can only {{be seen in the}} deeper canyons located in the westernmost part of the park. Retreat of the Kaibab Sea by the Mid Permian exposed its seabed to erosion, resulting in 100foot (30m) deep channels {{and the creation of a}} gap in the geologic record called an unconformity.|$|E
25|$|The Indus river {{feeds the}} Indus {{submarine}} fan, {{which is the}} second largest sediment body on the Earth. It consists of around 5million cubic kilometres of material eroded from the mountains. Studies of the sediment in the modern river indicate that the Karakoram Mountains in northern Pakistan and India are {{the single most important}} source of material, with the Himalayas providing the next largest contribution, mostly via the large rivers of the Punjab (Jhelum, Ravi, Chenab, Beas and Sutlej). Analysis of sediments from the Arabian Sea has demonstrated that prior to five million years ago the Indus was not connected to these Punjab rivers which instead flowed east into the Ganges and were captured after that time. Earlier work showed that <b>sand</b> <b>and</b> <b>silt</b> from western Tibet was reaching the Arabian Sea by 45million years ago, implying the existence of an ancient Indus River by that time. The delta of this proto-Indus river has subsequently been found in the Katawaz Basin, on the Afghan-Pakistan border.|$|E
50|$|Around the village, {{there are}} several woods (comprising oaks, beeches, chestnuts, and poplars), fields (comprising potatoes, sugar beets, corn, and wheat), and prairies (for cows and horses). The ground is made of <b>sands</b> <b>and</b> <b>silts.</b>|$|R
30|$|The {{location}} is about 5  km on the outskirt of Epe town, along Ibeju/Lekki-Epe Expressway and about 1  km from the Epe Lagoon. The geology {{is that of}} Recent Littoral/Lagoonal Deposit consisting mainly of <b>sands</b> <b>and</b> <b>silts.</b> The topsoil exhibits a light greyish colouration and is underlain by reddish-coloured <b>sand</b> <b>and</b> <b>silts</b> which gives the impression of being clayey from a distance. The site is sequestered away from the town and is almost completely surrounded by trees which {{have the ability to}} trap ensuing CO 2. The intention is to develop this site to an integrated landfill. However, the soils which are essentially sandy are incapable of retaining landfill gases in an enclosure.|$|R
40|$|Along active {{continental}} margins earthquake shaking was {{singled out}} {{as one of the}} most important triggering mechanisms for submarine landslides, which may trigger a tsunami wave and have tremendous impact on coastal communities and infrastructure. It is known that seismic loading may lead to sudden strength loss in loosely deposited granular soils such as <b>sands</b> <b>and</b> <b>silts</b> due to liquefaction. Volcanic arcs provide a source of granular sediment along active margins through ejection of volcaniclastica. Volcanic ash is of sand to silt size, such that it is presumed to act preferentially as gliding plane in submarine landslides. However, volcanic ash differs significantly in its geotechnical properties compared to commonly studied <b>sands</b> <b>and</b> <b>silts.</b> This dissertation tackles the question to what extent physical properties of volcanic <b>sands</b> <b>and</b> <b>silts</b> affect their response to gravitational and seismic loading in comparison to common <b>sands</b> <b>and</b> <b>silts.</b> Advanced laboratory shear experiments (direct shear and triaxial shear) were conducted with the purpose to investigate the shear behavior of volcanic material. In generic laboratory studies it is shown that properties like angularity, roughness and particle strength (i. e. crushability) play a key role in sediment stability and majorly determine the shear behavior of volcanic ash at effective stress < 0. 5 MPa. Furthermore, a case study was conducted on a subaqueous landslide located in the earthquake prone area of South-Central Chile. Recovered sediment cores show volcanic fall-out ash a few mm from the basal shear plane of a landslide that occurred ~ 6 k years ago. In a highly detailed analysis that gathers seismic profile data with CPT data and advanced geotechnical laboratory shear experiments, it is shown that the sole presence of volcanic ash was not sufficient to result in liquefaction failure due to earthquake shaking...|$|R
25|$|In deep marine environments, {{the water}} current working the sea bottom is small. Only fine {{particles}} can be transported to such places. Typically sediments depositing {{on the ocean}} floor are fine clay or small skeletons of micro-organisms. At 4km depth, the solubility of carbonates increases dramatically (the depth zone where this happens is called the lysocline). Calcareous sediment that sinks below the lysocline dissolves, as a result no limestone can be formed below this depth. Skeletons of micro-organisms formed of silica (such as radiolarians) are not as soluble and still deposit. An example of a rock formed of silica skeletons is radiolarite. When {{the bottom of the sea}} has a small inclination, for example at the continental slopes, the sedimentary cover can become unstable, causing turbidity currents. Turbidity currents are sudden disturbances of the normally quite deep marine environment and can cause the geologically speaking instantaneous deposition of large amounts of sediment, such as <b>sand</b> <b>and</b> <b>silt.</b> The rock sequence formed by a turbidity current is called a turbidite.|$|E
25|$|The area east of {{the divide}} in the state' north-central portion is known for the Missouri Breaks and other {{significant}} rock formations. Three buttes south of Great Falls are major landmarks: Cascade, Crown, Square, Shaw and Buttes. Known as laccoliths, they formed when igneous rock protruded through cracks in the sedimentary rock. The underlying surface consists of sandstone and shale. Surface soils {{in the area are}} highly diverse, and greatly affected by the local geology, whether glaciated plain, intermountain basin, mountain foothills, or tableland. Foothill regions are often covered in weathered stone or broken slate, or consist of uncovered bare rock (usually igneous, quartzite, sandstone, or shale). The soil of intermountain basins usually consists of clay, gravel, sand, silt, and volcanic ash, much of it laid down by lakes which covered the region during the Oligocene 33 to 23 million years ago. Tablelands are often topped with argillite gravel and weathered quartzite, occasionally underlain by shale. The glaciated plains are generally covered in clay, gravel, <b>sand,</b> <b>and</b> <b>silt</b> left by the proglacial Lake Great Falls or by moraines or gravel-covered former lake basins left by the Wisconsin glaciation 85,000 to 11,000 years ago. Farther east, areas such as Makoshika State Park near Glendive and Medicine Rocks State Park near Ekalaka contain some of the most scenic badlands regions in the state.|$|E
