500|$|The Mississippi-class {{ships were}} {{smaller than the}} several {{preceding}} classes of US battleships. [...] They were designed {{in an attempt to}} reduce the rapid growth in the size and cost of U.S. battleships. Also, a theory existed among influential naval leaders, including Dewey and Mahan, that many small battleships could be strategically useful, as were small ships of the line in the 18th and 19th centuries. In essence, the Mississippi-class ships were smaller versions of the preceding Connecticut class with virtually the same armament and armor, but the reduction in length, engine size, and fuel capacity caused them to be slow and short-ranged. Other design compromises caused them to perform poorly in terms of <b>steering,</b> <b>stability,</b> and sea keeping.|$|E
50|$|When a {{wheel is}} set up to have some camber angle, the {{interaction}} between the tire and road surface causes the wheel to tend to want to roll in a curve, as if it were part of a conical surface (camber thrust). This tendency to turn increases the rolling resistance as well as increasing tire wear. A small degree of toe (toe-out for negative camber, toe-in for positive camber) will cancel this turning tendency, reducing wear and rolling resistance. On some competition vehicles such as go-karts, especially where power is extremely limited and is highly regulated by the rules of the sport, these effects can become very significant in terms of competitiveness and performance.Toe-in and toe-out give the <b>steering</b> <b>stability.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The <b>steering</b> <b>stability</b> of {{a vehicle}} at high speed is the urgent key problem to be solved of {{automobile}} independent development. And {{it is also the}} premise and one of the necessary conditions of vehicle safety. Considering of the effects of tire nonlinearity, a 4 -DOF dynamics model for a vehicle is established. The yaw rate responses, side slip angle, carriage roll angle and front wheel steering angle with different vehicle speeds are calculated. The calculated values are then compared with the values without considering of the effects of tire nonlinearity. The simulations results show that the vehicle responses can be reflected accurately by using nonlinear tire model.

40|$|Lateral <b>steering</b> <b>stability</b> is a {{critical}} parameter of driving performance i?om both a theoretical as well as applied per-spective. The measurement of lateral <b>steering</b> <b>stability</b> in a driving simulation environment is both straightforward and ubiquitous. However, the ability to measure this performance parameter in real-time during real-world driving has typically been fraught with technical challenges.

40|$|International audienceThe goal of {{this study}} was to examine the effects of visual roll tilt on gaze and riding {{behavior}} when negotiating a bend using a motorcycle simulator. To this end, experienced motorcyclists rode along a track with a series of right and left turns whilst the degree of visual roll tilt was manipulated in three different conditions. Gaze behavior was analyzed by using the tangent point as a dynamic spatial reference; the deviation of gaze to this particular point was computed in both the horizontal and vertical directions. Steering control was assessed in terms of the lateral positioning, <b>steering</b> <b>stability</b> and number of lane departures. In the no-roll condition, the motorcyclists tracked a steering point on the road ahead, which was compatible with the hypothesis of ‘‘steer where you look” behavior. In the roll condition, our results revealed that the horizontal distribution of gaze points relative to the tangent point was preserved. However, significantly more fixations were made further ahead of the tangent point in the vertical direction. This modification of visual behavior was coupled with a degradation in <b>steering</b> <b>stability</b> and an offset in lateral positioning, which sometimes led to lane departures. These results are discussed with regard to models of visual control of steering for bend negotiation...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{adaptive}} vehicle skid control, {{for stability}} and tracking {{of a vehicle}} during slippage of its wheels without braking, is addressed. Two adaptive control algorithms are developed: one for the case when no road condition information is available, {{and one for the}} case when certain information is known only about the instant type of road surface on which the vehicle is moving. The vehicle control system with an adaptive control law keeps the speed of the vehicle as desired by applying more power to the drive wheels where the additional driving force at the non-skidding wheel will compensate for the loss of the driving force at the skidding wheel, and also arranges the direction of the vehicle motion by changing the steering angle of the two front <b>steering</b> wheels. <b>Stability</b> analysis proves that the vehicle position and velocity errors are both bounded.
