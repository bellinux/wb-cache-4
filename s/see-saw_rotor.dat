40|$|A {{number of}} lifting rotor {{conditions}} with random inputs are discussed. The {{present state of}} random process theory, applicable to lifting rotor problems is sketched. Possible theories of random blade flapping and random blade flap-bending are outlined and their limitations discussed. A plan for preliminary experiments to study random flapping motions of a <b>see-saw</b> <b>rotor</b> is developed...|$|E
40|$|The blade {{flapping}} equation has bden solved on an analogue COmPUter {{taking into}} acoount the reversed flow region but neglecting stall. The fully articulated blade becomes unstable at about p = 2. 3, Whilst a <b>see-saw</b> <b>rotor</b> is stable up to p = 5 at least and the trends {{suggest that it}} may be stable for all values of G. However, the response to a gust, or the equivalent change of no-feathering axis angle, 1 s almost the same fcrr boti rotors up to about p = 0. 75. For a 35 ft/sec gust at a forwLard speed of 200 ft/sec, and typical rotor/fuselage clearance, this represents the limiting tip-speed ratio for either rotor. The better response of the <b>see-saw</b> <b>rotor,</b> however, makes it possible to increase the limiting tipxxpeed ratio by some form of flapping restraint. This has been investigated by considering the effects of springs and dampers, and offset and 63 -hinges...|$|E
