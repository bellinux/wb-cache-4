5|$|The {{development}} of the germanium transistor in 1948 {{opened the door to}} countless applications of solid state electronics. From 1950 through the early 1970s, this area provided an increasing market for germanium, but then high-purity silicon began replacing germanium in transistors, diodes, and rectifiers. For example, the company that became Fairchild Semiconductor was founded in 1957 with the express purpose of producing silicon transistors. Silicon has superior electrical properties, but it requires much greater purity that could not be commercially achieved {{in the early years of}} <b>semiconductor</b> <b>electronics.</b>|$|E
5|$|Silicon carbide (SiC), {{also known}} as {{carborundum}} , is a semiconductor containing silicon and carbon with chemical formula SiC. It occurs in nature as the extremely rare mineral moissanite. Synthetic silicon carbide powder has been mass-produced since 1893 for use as an abrasive. Grains of silicon carbide can be bonded together by sintering to form very hard ceramics that are widely used in applications requiring high endurance, such as car brakes, car clutches and ceramic plates in bulletproof vests. Electronic applications of silicon carbide such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and detectors in early radios were first demonstrated around 1907. SiC is used in <b>semiconductor</b> <b>electronics</b> devices that operate at high temperatures or high voltages, or both. Large single crystals of silicon carbide can be grown by the Lely method; they can be cut into gems known as synthetic moissanite. Silicon carbide with high surface area can be produced from SiO2 contained in plant material.|$|E

25|$|Before the {{development}} of silicon semiconductor rectifiers, vacuum tube thermionic diodes and copper oxide- or selenium-based metal rectifier stacks were used. With the introduction of <b>semiconductor</b> <b>electronics,</b> vacuum tube rectifiers became obsolete, except for some enthusiasts of vacuum tube audio equipment. For power rectification from very low to very high current, semiconductor diodes of various types (junction diodes, Schottky diodes, etc.) are widely used.|$|E
25|$|The {{crystallinity}} of the produced tungsten layers can {{be controlled}} by altering the WF6/H2 ratio and the substrate temperature: low ratios and temperatures result in (100) oriented tungsten crystallites whereas higher values favor the (111) orientation. Formation of HF is a drawback, as the HF vapor is very aggressive and etches away most materials. Also, the deposited tungsten shows poor adhesion to the silicon dioxide which the main passivation material in <b>semiconductor</b> <b>electronics.</b> Therefore, SiO2 has to be covered with an extra buffer layer prior to the tungsten deposition. On the other hand, etching by HF may be beneficial to remove unwanted impurity layers.|$|E

25|$|As a night fighter {{that was}} not {{expected}} to be as fast as smaller daylight fighters, the expectation was to have a stable platform for its radar system and the four 20mm cannon mounted in the lower fuselage. The F3D was, however, able to outturn a MiG-15. The fire control system in the F3D-1 was the Westinghouse AN/APQ-35. The AN/APQ-35 was advanced for the time, a combination of three different radars, each performing separate functions: an AN/APS-21 search radar, an AN/APG-26 tracking radar, both located in the nose, and an AN/APS-28 tail warning radar. The complexity of this vacuum tube-based radar system, which was produced before the advent of <b>semiconductor</b> <b>electronics,</b> required intensive maintenance to keep it operating properly.|$|E
25|$|Superheterodyne {{receivers}} {{have essentially}} replaced all previous receiver designs. The development of modern <b>semiconductor</b> <b>electronics</b> negated {{the advantages of}} designs (such as the regenerative receiver) that used fewer vacuum tubes. The superheterodyne receiver offers superior sensitivity, frequency stability and selectivity. Compared with the tuned radio frequency receiver (TRF) design, superhets offer better stability because a tuneable oscillator is more easily realized than a tuneable amplifier. Operating at a lower frequency, IF filters can give narrower passbands at the same Q factor than an equivalent RF filter. A fixed IF also allows {{the use of a}} crystal filter or similar technologies that cannot be tuned. Regenerative and super-regenerative receivers offered a high sensitivity, but often suffer from stability problems making them difficult to operate.|$|E
25|$|Cascaded diode and {{capacitor}} stages can {{be added}} to make a voltage multiplier (Cockroft-Walton circuit). These circuits are capable of producing a DC output voltage potential up to about ten times the peak AC input voltage, in practice limited by current capacity and voltage regulation issues. Diode voltage multipliers, frequently used as a trailing boost stage or primary high voltage (HV) source, are used in HV laser power supplies, powering devices such as cathode ray tubes (CRT) (like those used in CRT based television, radar and sonar displays), photon amplifying devices found in image intensifying and photo multiplier tubes (PMT), and magnetron based radio frequency (RF) devices used in radar transmitters and microwave ovens. Before the introduction of <b>semiconductor</b> <b>electronics,</b> transformerless vacuum tube receivers powered directly from AC power sometimes used voltage doublers to generate roughly 300VDC from a 100–120V power line.|$|E

40|$|This study {{analyzes}} the industry performance of ADRs between 1995 - 2005 and our {{results show that}} ADR performance varies based on industry group. In addition, ADRs are compared to domestic equity industry portfolios. Although both groups have similar average monthly returns, the associated risk varies.

We also consider a shorter time frame (2000 - 2005) in order to include technology-related industries which become more prominent in the 2000 s. The results suggest that an agent should invest in the following domestic industries: <b>semiconductors,</b> <b>electronics,</b> insurance, media, banking, food, electric, beverages and oil/gas and the following ADRs: software, telecommunications, Internet, automotive, pharmaceuticals, airlines, and mining. 1...|$|R
