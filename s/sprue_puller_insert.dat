50|$|The score stayed 4-3 {{until the}} bottom of the seventh. With one out and runners at first and third, Tony La Russa <b>pulled</b> Davis and <b>inserted</b> Rick Honeycutt. Honeycutt's relief {{appearance}} in Game 2 had been disastrous; this time, it was worse and cost the A's any chance to win. Honeycutt gave up singles to two light-hitting Blue Jays, Manuel Lee and Junior Felix, scoring Tony Fernández and loading the bases with only one out. A walk to Lloyd Moseby forced in another run giving the Jays a 6-3 lead. Of the last six hitters Honeycutt had faced in the two games he had walked three and given up three hits and three had scored. Gene Nelson relieved Honeycutt and gave up a single to right by Wilson that scored Lee, but a great throw from Canseco nailed Felix at the plate. Nevertheless, the Blue Jays now had a 7-3 lead with two innings to play.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{a new approach}} to the investigation of the contents of microfluidic droplets at the single molecule level. Glass nanopores with diameters below 25 nm, formed by pipette <b>pulling,</b> are <b>inserted</b> into a microfluidic channel with a height and width of 100 μm. Subsequently, a segmented flow of buffered KCl droplets in an FC- 40 carrier oil is flowed through the device and analysed via changes in the measured electrical signal upon application of a voltage between the nanopipettes. Initially, the thesis focuses on the optimisation of droplet generation and pipette performance. A T-junction geometry and a novel method of droplet generation using an integrated pipette are both trialled as methods for droplet production in the device. In addition, atomic layer deposition (ALD) is investigated as an approach to optimise the size of the glass nanopore for the detection of single molecules. Subsequently, droplets in the segmented flow are examined with the device. Optical studies are undertaken to study the viability of droplets in the device and the preservation of their ‘isolated microreactor’ status. The length and frequency of droplets is then measured electrically and compared to an optical control, the excellent agreement between the two methods confirming the validity of the electrical approach. Attention then turns to the measurement of the bulk properties of the droplet with the determination of the KCl concentration within individual droplets. Finally, single molecules of 10 kbp double stranded DNA are translocated from within the droplet into the nanopipette, illustrating the device’s potential for the analysis of droplet contents and the control of their contents at the single molecule level.

5000|$|Rage Against the Machine's Zack de la Rocha {{spoke about}} Bad Religion to the OC Register during the band's 30-year anniversary in 2010. Speaking about How Could Hell Be Any Worse?, he said: [...] "I {{remember}} hearing BR's How Could Hell Be Any Worse? {{for the first}} time in 1985, I was fifteen. The first thing I remember is <b>pulling</b> the <b>insert</b> from the sleeve of the record and seeing those drawings from Dante's Inferno, and that red wash over the blurry shot of Los Angeles, and I admit I was scared. A little terrified even. I had no idea what to expect. When the needle hit the record I have to say it was a defining moment for me. The music was darker than most punk records I had heard. It was almost gothic, and there was a genuine sadness to the melodies. Listening to the words I remember being overwhelmed. It wasn't some revelation that god didn't exist ... it was more like an injection of the sad truth. That our condition is the product of the mess of our own making ... and at fifteen that was as scary as the inferno drawings. I wasn't reading Sartre or Nietzsche, and I'm convinced now that if I was it wouldn't have had the same effect. Throughout the record there was very little relief from the sad truths except one: 'there are two things you can do ... one is to turn and fight ... the other's to go headlong into the night.' Truly one of the greatest L.A. bands". De la Rocha also said that the song [...] "Fuck Armageddon...This Is Hell" [...] changed his life.|$|R

We {{work on a}} concept of hermetic assembly in which a MEMS wafer is covered (top-down) by a crossing optical waveguide wafer. The mirrors {{are designed to be}} <b>pulled</b> up and <b>inserted</b> at waveguide intersection for N × N optical switching. Vertical micromirrors have been fabricated in SU 8 photopolymer or in single crystalline silicon (on SOI substrate). The SU 8 mirrors, coated with gold layer, exhibit vertical and smooth sidewalls that will be sufficient for optical use. For integration of silicon mirrors, we have developed a new simple two-step deep reactive ion etching (DRIE) pattern transfer that allow simultaneous fabrication of good quality silicon mirrors (20 μm height and 2 μm thickness) and of recessed mechanical platform (5 μm thick). The platform has been analysed through its resonance behaviour. The strong effect of mechanical non-linearity which is observed in clamped suspension can be exploited to increase the control range of the electrostatic actuator. © 2005 Elsevier B. V.

It was easy to recognize the 4WD thanks to the large lateral fascia of plastic material, the wheel rims of a specific design without any hub caps, and the front and rear splash guard; to distinguish it further unique identification was written on the tailgate, on the side shields and the splash guard as standard. Inside was a novel covered steering wheel. The standard package included: a right external mirror, optional headlamp cleaning system, instrumentation and control system with tachometer, sunroof, electric windows, central locking, split rear seat, and a steering wheel adjustable for height. The Y10 4WD had a top speed of 145 km/h and accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h in 17.4 seconds.|$|R
40|$|Many short {{peptides}} selectively permeabilize {{the bacteria}} plasma membrane, leading to their lyses and death: they are therefore {{a source of}} antibacterial molecules, and inspiration for novel and more selective drugs. Another class of short (< 100 residues) membrane proteins called viroporins, because they are coded by viral genes, permeabilizes the membrane of susceptible cells during infection of by most animal viruses. The permeabilization leads to host cell lyses {{and the release of}} the virus mass, replicated at host cell expense, to propagate the infection. Detailed knowledge of the permeabilization properties of these proteins would allow to design, for instance, selective blockers of these pores, that would contrast the spread of the viral infection. In this chapter, the patch-clamp technique is employed to study the mechanism of membrane permeabilization induced by the pore-forming peptides, under strict physiological conditions. This goal is achieved by recording the ion current through the channels formed by these peptides, once inserted in a cell plasma membrane. To avoid contamination by the cell membrane currents, all the endogenous current sources must be blocked. It has been found that the photoreceptor rod outer segment mechanically isolated from the retina of low vertebrates (OS) was the most suitable cell to carry on the above studies, because it was possible to fully block all its endogenous currents without using any drug (such as TTX, TEA, dihydropyridines, etc.), that could obstruct the peptide pores or interfere with the pore formation. The peptides were applied to (and removed from) the extracellular OS side in 50 ms with a computer-controlled microperfusion system, in which every perfusion parameter (as the rate of solution flow, the temporal sequence of solution changes or the number of automatic, self-washing cycles) was controlled by a user-friendly interface. This system allowed rapid application and removal of ions, drugs and peptides on the cells with a controlled timing, so that the ion channel characteristics (as its selectivity, blockade and gating) and the dynamics of pore formation could be precisely assessed. On the basis of the electrophysiological recordings obtained with representative peptides and with selected analogs, as alamethicin F 50 / 5, the cecoprine-mellitin hybrid peptide, and a 20 -aminoacid long fragment of the viroporin poliovirus 2 B, it will be shown that the membrane pore formation occurs according to the barrel and stave, toroidal, and carpet model, respectively, that are the most widely-accepted mechanisms of membrane permeabilization. When recording large currents (produced for instance by high concentrations of peptides and/or highly permeable peptides), it is necessary to minimize series resistance, to reduce time constant of charging the cell membrane capacitance and error in membrane potential control. A second problem arises from the asymmetry of the plasma membrane: {{it is possible that the}} permeabilization properties of a particular peptide could be different depending upon the side of the membrane to which it is applied. For example, it is conceivable that viroporins are optimized to insert in the intracellular face of the plasma membrane, because they are synthesized in host cell cytosol. These two problems could be circumvented by widening the patch pipette shank, through the calibrated combination of heat and air pressure. These pipettes dramatically reduce series resistance, and allow at the same time to <b>insert</b> <b>pulled</b> quartz or plastic tubes very close to the pipette tip, making it possible the delivery of large molecules to the cytosol with a controlled timing. Finally, it is presented here a simple procedure to consistently attain seals with conventional or pressure polished pipettes, made from just one glass type, on a wide variety of cell types, isolated from different amphibian, reptilian, fish, and mammalian tissues, and on artificial membranes made with many different lipid mixtures...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{develop a}} {{practical}} method of measuring shotcrete adhesion strength in underground mines. A more {{thorough understanding of}} the in-situ strength properties of shotcrete, particularly the bond strength of shotcrete to the rock, will lead to improvements in ground support practices, thereby preventing ground falls and reducing mine roof-fall incidents. Background: When shotcrete is used {{as an integral part}} of a mine's ground support system, it is important to know the strength properties of the in-place shotcrete. To quantify the bond strength of the shotcrete to the rock, a shotcrete adhesion test system has been developed for use in underground mines. The test system consists of readily available components, primarily a small stand-mounted core drill and a pulling unit equipped with a precision pressure gauge. All of these components are rugged and portable, and they can reliably be used to measure the adhesion strength of shotcrete app lied to the surface of an underground mine opening. With this test method, a direct tensile load is applied to a core drilled through the shotcrete into the underlying rock. As this load is gradually increased, the test core typically breaks or fails in tension. This tensile failure can occur in the shotcrete, at the bond surface (interface), in the rock, or at some combination of these locations. As a result, the tensile-strength values derived from these tests provide important information about the quality of the applied shotcrete and the competency of the underlying rock, as well as the bond strength of the shotcrete to the rock. Conducting the Shotcrete Adhesion Test: Once a desired test site has been selected, a hand-operated rotary percussive drill is used to drill a 16 -mm x 51 -mm (0. 625 - in x 2 -in) hole for anchoring the drill stand. After installing a 13 -mm- (0. 5 -in-) diameter threaded stud and expansion anchor in this hole, the drill stand is leveled and secured in position. Three holes are then drilled from this drill setup ensuring that all of the holes are parallel and concentric. First, an 11. 1 -mm- (0. 4375 -in-) diameter hole is drilled dry into the shotcrete using a rotary percussive bit, to a depth of 60 mm (2. 375 in), assuming a shotcrete thickness of 75 mm (3 in). Next, the hole is cleaned, filled with a quick-setting, two-part epoxy adhesive, and a 9. 5 -mm- (0. 375 -in-) diameter <b>pull</b> anchor is <b>inserted.</b> After the epoxy has initially set or gelled (about 15 min), a 102 -mm- (4 -in-) diameter diamond core bit is used to wet drill a second hole through the shotcrete to a depth of about 25 to 50 mm (1 to 2 in) into the underlying rock. Finally, a 127 -mm- (5 -in-) diameter diamond core bit is used to wet drill a shallow kerf for seating the base of the pulling fixture. After the epoxy has fully set (30 - 60 min), a threaded extension rod is connected to the pull anchor with a coupling nut; the pulling fixture is then carefully placed over the core sample with the base of its reaction ring positioned in the kerf of the outer drill hole. Next, a collet and a slip-on, quick-threading locknut are connected to the threaded extension rod to serve as a mechanical stop for the pulling fixture's ram. The hydraulic hose from the hand pump is then connected to the loading ram, and the pressure gauge is zeroed. To conduct a test, an increasing tensile load is applied to the core sample through a slow and steady movement of the pump handle until the core breaks. The adhesion strength of the test core is determined by converting the maximum hydraulic pressure value, saved on the pressure gauge's digital display, to the maximum tensile stress acting normal to the core's failure surface. Typical adhesion test results comparing tensile strength with shotcrete curing age are shown in Figure 4. " - NIOSHTIC- 2 "June 2011.
