5000|$|The racial {{demographics}} regarding <b>serial</b> <b>killers</b> {{are often}} subject to debate. In the United States, {{the majority of}} reported and investigated <b>serial</b> <b>killers</b> are white males, from a lower-to-middle-class background, usually in their late twenties to early thirties. However, there are African American, Asian, and Hispanic (of any race) <b>serial</b> <b>killers</b> as well, and, according to the FBI, based on percentages of the U.S. population, whites are not more likely than other races to be <b>serial</b> <b>killers.</b> Criminal profiler Pat Brown says <b>serial</b> <b>killers</b> are usually reported as white because <b>serial</b> <b>killers</b> usually target victims of their own race, and the media typically focuses on [...] "All-American" [...] white and pretty female victims who were the targets of white male offenders; that crimes among minority offenders in urban communities, where crime rates are higher, are under-investigated; and that minority <b>serial</b> <b>killers</b> likely exist at the same ratios as white <b>serial</b> <b>killers</b> for the population. She believes that the myth that <b>serial</b> <b>killers</b> are always white might have become [...] "truth" [...] in some research fields due to the over-reporting of white <b>serial</b> <b>killers</b> in the media.|$|R

5000|$|Morrison {{claims that}} there are no female <b>serial</b> <b>killers.</b> Most experts {{recognize}} that, though fewer in number than male <b>serial</b> <b>killers,</b> there are in fact female <b>serial</b> <b>killers,</b> and that women such as Aileen Wuornos and Jane Toppan qualify.|$|R
50|$|Juvenile <b>serial</b> <b>killers</b> are uncommon. There {{are three}} main {{categories}} that juvenile <b>serial</b> <b>killers</b> can fit into: primary, maturing, and secondary killers. There have been studies done to {{compare and contrast}} these three groups and to discover {{similarities and differences between}} them. Although these types of <b>serial</b> <b>killers</b> are less common, oftentimes adult <b>serial</b> <b>killers</b> may make their debut at an early age and it can be an opportunity for researchers to study what factors brought about the behavior.|$|R
5000|$|Female <b>serial</b> <b>killers</b> {{are rare}} {{compared}} to their male counterparts. Sources suggest that female <b>serial</b> <b>killers</b> represented fewer than one in every six known serial murderers in the U.S. between 1800 and 2004 (64 females from a total of 416 known offenders), or that around 15% of U.S. <b>serial</b> <b>killers</b> have been women, with a collective number of victims between 427 and 612. Lethal Ladies authors, Amanda L. Farrell, Robert D. Keppel, and Victoria B. Titterington state that [...] "the Justice Department indicated 36 female <b>serial</b> <b>killers</b> have been active {{over the course of}} the last century." [...] According to The Journal of Forensic Psychiatry & Psychology, there is evidence that 16% of all <b>serial</b> <b>killers</b> are women.|$|R

50|$|The book {{presents}} various facts, {{perceptions and}} descriptions of <b>serial</b> <b>killers</b> in a diffused way and ties the ideas together at the end while presenting {{the theory that the}} origin of a <b>serial</b> <b>killer's</b> behavior is genetic. An illustrative example notes that <b>serial</b> <b>killers</b> experience profound physiological events during their crimes that are related to the hypothalamus and that the <b>serial</b> <b>killer's</b> lack of emotion has a similar connection to the hypothalamus. Morrison also describes how serial killers' crimes are similar to drug addiction.|$|R
50|$|Vronsky cites {{statistics}} that indicate one {{in nearly every}} six (16 percent) <b>serial</b> <b>killers</b> apprehended in the United States since 1820 was a female, either acting alone or as a partner of a male or female offender. Vronsky argues that {{contrary to popular belief}} that female <b>serial</b> <b>killers</b> prefer to murder their male intimates or family members, recent data indicate that currently female <b>serial</b> <b>killers</b> marginally prefer strangers as victims and that historically in the United States, 53 percent of female <b>serial</b> <b>killers</b> had murdered at least one adult female and 32 percent at least one female child.|$|R
50|$|Male serial murderers tend to {{use more}} brutal methods of killing such as {{suffocation}} and beatings, while women use methods such as poison or less violent measures. In addition, while {{a large percentage of}} male <b>serial</b> <b>killers</b> do focus on women as their targets, female <b>serial</b> <b>killers</b> are less likely to focus exclusively on males as targets. Some male <b>serial</b> <b>killers</b> focus on males as targets, such as Jeffrey Dahmer and Wayne Williams The ways serial murderers are portrayed in the media reflect the views on femicide and gender in society. Often, murders of prostitutes/low-income women/women of color by <b>serial</b> <b>killers</b> receive less attention in the media than the killings of younger, prettier, more affluent women, usually married, engaged, or in relationships with much handsome, affluent, younger men their age. <b>Serial</b> <b>killers</b> are almost always portrayed as monsters and sociopaths in the news.|$|R

50|$|The {{recurring}} characteristic <b>serial</b> <b>killers</b> share, Morrison contends, is {{the emotional}} age of an infant. <b>Serial</b> <b>killers</b> lack a coherent personality and are missing {{large parts of}} their humanity. They are generally charismatic and able to fit in by learning to behave as normal people do, while lacking the empathy most normal people possess. Most <b>serial</b> <b>killers</b> are fluent liars, often protest against the injustice of their incarceration and are unable {{to understand that they}} did anything wrong. They have a fractured psyche which is incapable of connecting their crimes with the consequences, and often proclaim no memory of the murders. She also notes frequent instances of hypochondria among <b>serial</b> <b>killers.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Morrison {{argues that}} <b>serial</b> <b>killers</b> are not {{motivated}} by sexual urges. It is recognized by nearly all other {{experts in the}} field {{that this is not the}} case, and that lust is a very common motive for <b>serial</b> <b>killers.</b>|$|R

40|$|M. A. This {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} similarities and differences between South African <b>serial</b> <b>killers</b> and their American counterparts.

Two of the stereotypes surrounding <b>serial</b> <b>killers</b> are that they are almost always White males and that African American males are barely represented in their ranks. In a sample of 413 <b>serial</b> <b>killers</b> operating in the United States from 1945 to mid- 2004, it was found that 90 were African American. Relative to the African American proportion of the population across that time period, African Americans were overrepresented in the ranks of <b>serial</b> <b>killers</b> by a factor of about 2.
