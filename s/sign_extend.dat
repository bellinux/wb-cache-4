The [...] pointer refers to the data extracted from the header as outlined earlier, it is assumed to have already been converted to the host Endian. This implementation is not intended to be optimal and the external concerns have been ignored such as the specific method for sign extension and the method of acquiring a bitstream from a file or network source. Once it completes, there will be samples_needed sets (if stereo, there will be pairs for example) of samples in the output buffer. The decoded samples will be in host-endian standard interleaved PCM format, i.e. left 16bit, right 16bit, left, right, etc. Finally, if looping is not enabled, or not supported, then the function will return the number of sample spaces that were not used in the buffer. The caller can test if this value is not zero to detect the end of the stream and drop or write silence into the unused spaces if necessary.|$|E
