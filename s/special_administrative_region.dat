Hong Kong was later occupied by Japan during the Second World War until British control resumed in 1945. The Sino-British Joint Declaration signed between the United Kingdom and China in 1984 paved way for the transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong in 1997, when it became a <b>special</b> <b>administrative</b> <b>region</b> of the People's Republic of China {{with a high degree of}} autonomy.|$|E
