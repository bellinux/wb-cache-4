This reflected a movement in the larger New Zealand cities in the 1920s and 1930s for apartment living. The appeals were inexpensive living in a central location, with apartments offering modern conveniences and built in furniture. <b>St</b> <b>Elmo</b> Courts was constructed in 1930.

50|$|Until the 1880s, {{the area}} {{at the foot of}} Lookout Mountain {{remained}} primarily a wooded area.

25|$|It {{was there}} where Dragut met with Lala Mustafa, {{commander}} of the Ottoman land forces, who was besieging Fort <b>St.</b> <b>Elmo.</b> He advised him to first capture the poorly defended Cittadella and Mdina as soon as possible, but this advice was not taken. He also arranged for more cannon fire to be concentrated on the recently built Fort <b>St.</b> <b>Elmo</b> which controlled {{the entrance of the}} Grand Harbour and seemed weaker than the other forts; joining the bombardment with 30 of his own cannon. In only 24 hours the Ottomans fired 6000 cannon shots. Realizing that Fort <b>St.</b> <b>Elmo</b> and Fort <b>St.</b> Angelo (the main headquarters of the Knights {{on the other side of}} the Grand Harbour) could still communicate with each other, Turgut Reis ordered a complete siege of Fort <b>St.</b> <b>Elmo</b> with the aim of isolating it from Fort St. Angelo.|$|R
