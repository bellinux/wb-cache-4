Two granular materials, namely, a <b>silica</b> rock <b>flour</b> and a Chatelet flint grit, which differed in nominal diameter by a factor of 50 but were otherwise practically similar in all other grain characteristics were used in this work. A comprehensive series of triaxial tests under a wide range of cell pressures was carried out to quantify the stress and absolute particle size effects. Model footing tests were also performed by pushing a rigid circular punch axisymmetrically into the flat surface of a cylindrical soil model either under 1 -g (gravity) with surcharge or under elevated g in a centrifuge. The 1 -g and centrifuge test series were used to study the scale effects on the surcharge term Ng and the self-weight term Nγ of the Terzaghi bearing capacity equation, respectively. Parameters varied were punch diameter, particle size and surcharge or g level. Two theoretical analyses were attempted based on the finite element method and the method of characteristics. Using the Schofield Soil Model, the finite element analysis can give a reasonable order of magnitude prediction for the settlement of the footing under working load conditions. When the effect of reducing angle of shearing with increasing stress was taken into account together with the change of geometry due to footing penetration, the angles of shearing inferred from the method of characteristics fall within ± 20 of those measured in triaxial compression tests. Distortion due to violating the scaling law by not conserving the ratio of particle size to model dimension was not considered to be significant. Distortion due to violating the constitutive soil behaviour by varying the absolute particle size was found to be significant due to differences in grain crushing, but this can be accounted for effectively by the new style of calculations developed in the thesis.

It is frequently observed in cement sheaths of heavy oil wells submitted to steam injection. The present study evaluated the mechanical behavior of Special Class Portland Oilwell Cement (SCPOC) slurries containing <b>silica</b> <b>flour</b> to prevent retrogression. A factorial statistical planning was used to assess the effect of the main variables on the mechanical behavior of cement slurries, i. e., mechanical testing temperature (30, 100, 120, 180 and 230 ºC); contents of <b>silica</b> <b>flour</b> replacing cement (0 - 18 and 36 %) and curing time for rupture (12 h and 7 days). The results revealed that slurries containing 18 % of <b>silica</b> <b>flour</b> tested at 230 ºC depicted an increase in compressive strength up to 30 % after curing for 12 h and 10 % after curing for 7 days, indicating retrogression. On the other hand, testing slurries containing <b>silica</b> <b>flour</b> at temperatures up to 180 ºC revealed strength increase of just 10 %, suggesting the mechanical stability of the SCPOC, which prevents retrogression. Such behavior was probably related to the relatively low content of C 3 A and low specific area of the material. Therefore, strength retrogression at typical bottom hole temperatures of up to 180 ºC can be controlled by small additions of <b>silica</b> <b>flour,</b> economically contributing to the use of SCPOC cementing...|$|E

40|$|Diatomaceous {{earth is}} {{formed by the}} {{deposition}} of biological matter and as such {{has a number of}} unique engineering properties. Unique diatomaceous earth?s characteristics include high specific surface area, low dry density, high water storage ability, high friction angle, high compressibility, and unstable response under dynamic loads. These properties came from its biological origin and structure. Due to these peculiar characteristics, diatomaceous earth could be detrimental in some engineering application while it could find application in in the cover of landfills, hydraulic barriers, ionic barriers, low-weight fills, and etc. However to assess potential beneficial properties, engineers and researchers much first completely characterize the material. This characterization must include an estimation of the percentage of diatomaceous earth in the soil and how the diatomite content controls the physical behavior of soils. In this study, the pure diatomaceous earth mixed with kaolinite and <b>silica</b> <b>flour</b> in several proportion was used to assess how parameters such as Atterberg limits, compression tests, and electrical properties change with diatomaceous earth content and how these changes may affect the sue use on diatomic soils in engineering applications. Experimental results show that diatomaceous earth have high liquid and plastic limits. The higher fraction volume of diatomaceous earth allows higher water storage and that is represented on the results of liquid limit and electrical property test results. The permittivity of diatomaceous earth, kaolinite, and <b>silica</b> <b>flour</b> are governed by the availability of volume of free water in the soil specimens. The higher volumetric water content determines the higher real and imaginary permittivity. In compression tests, as pore fluid drains out with void ratio and volumetric fluid content decrease, the measured permittivity decreased as well.

40|$|Magma {{transport}} in volcanic plumbing systems induces surface deformation, {{which can}} be monitored by geodetic techniques, such as GPS and InSAR. These geode- tic signals are commonly analyzed through geodetic models in order to constrain the shape of, and the pressure in, magma plumbing systems. These models, how- ever, suffer critical limitations: (1) the modelled magma conduit shapes cannot {{be compared with the}} real conduits, so the geodetic models cannot be tested nor validated; (2) the modelled conduits only exhibit shapes that are too simplistic; (3) most geodetic models only account for elasticity of the host rock, whereas substantial plastic deformation is known to occur. To overcome these limitations, one needs to use a physical system, in which (1) both surface deformation and the shape of, and pressure in, the underlying conduit are known, and (2) the mechanical properties of the host material are controlled and well known. In this contribution, we present novel quantitative laboratory results of shallow magma emplacement. Fine-grained <b>silica</b> <b>flour</b> represents the brittle crust, and low viscosity vegetable oil is an analogue for the magma. The melting temperature of the oil is 31 ◦C; the oil solidifies in the models {{after the end of the}} experiments. At the time of injection the oil temperature is 50 ◦C. The oil is pumped from a reservoir using a volumetric pump into the <b>silica</b> <b>flour</b> through a circular inlet at the bottom of a 40 x 40 cm square box. The <b>silica</b> <b>flour</b> is cohesive, such that oil in- trudes it by fracturing it, and produces typical sheet intrusions (dykes, cone sheets, etc.). During oil intrusion, the model surface deforms, mostly by doming. These movements are measured by an advanced photogrammetry method, which uses 4 synchronized fixed cameras that periodically image the surface of the model from different angles. We apply particle tracking method to compute the 3 D ground deformation pattern through time. After solidification of the oil, the intrusion can be excavated and photographed from several angles to compute its 3 D shape with the same photogrammetry method. Then, the surface deformation pattern can be directly compared with the shape of underlying intrusion. This quantitative dataset is essential to quantitatively test and validate classical volcano geodetic models...|$|E

A simple analytical model of the particle-drop collision was developed to describe the particle recovery by the drops {{as a function of}} the water flux, covering two extremes of relative velocity between the particles and drops. The Discrete Element Method was used to validate the analytical model. Further validation of the model and insights were obtained through experimental studies. The physical process of wetting was observed to be important in influencing the tendency of particles to become engulfed by the drops of water, or to either adhere to the drops or by-pass the drops altogether. Hydrophilic particles were readily engulfed while hydrophobic particles, at best, adhered to the surface of the drop, or failed to attach. Moreover, the recovery of the hydrophilic silica particles was significantly higher than the recovery of hydrophobic coal particles, with the selectivity ratio approximately 1. 5. Spherical ballotini particles were the most sensitive, with a notable increase in recovery when cleaned, and evidence of increased recovery with increasing particle size. The recovery of irregular shaped <b>silica</b> <b>flour</b> particles, however, was largely independent of the particle size.

40|$|After the Great East Japan Earthquake of 2011, nearly 24 {{million tons}} of {{disaster}} debris such as concrete products, natural and polymeric fibres, and tsunami deposits remained {{on the coast of}} Japan. Much of this debris was recycled and repurposed in engineering projects such as embankments, park restoration, and agricultural field restoration around Tokyo Bay, one of the hardest hit regions of the country. Such a major disaster developed a need for the stabilization of the liquefaction susceptible regions of the reclaimed Tokyo Bay coastline. This thesis specifically focuses on the stabilization against liquefaction of Toyoura sand with the typical silt contents found in the Tokyo Bay region using polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) fibres and Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC). A link between the large strain static and dynamic behavior of the silty sand and the microstructural elements controlling the mechanical response of the amended soil was developed. On a macro scale (Rowe cell, bender element, 2 ̆ 6 cyclic triaxial tests), trends based on cement content, fibre content, <b>silica</b> <b>flour</b> content, and cyclic stress ratio were developed to aid the prediction of the mechanical response of the soil mixture. On a micro scale (SEM and CT scans, mercury intrusion porosimetry), the pore structure, soil structure and soil fabric were visualized to understand the mechanisms underlying these trends. Results from the many tests performed confirmed that the addition of polymer fibres and cement improve the liquefaction resistance, undrained shear strength, and stiffness of silty and clean Toyoura sand.

40|$|Abstract The main {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to gain insight in processes governing bank strength and the influence of bank strength on channel patterns in flume experiments. Variables such as root length, root branching, plant density and spatial and temporal distribution of fines have not been quantified in terms of bank strength in flume experiments. Therefore supporting experiments have been done to study these variables. In the past attempts have been done to create dynamic meandering rivers in flume experiments (Friedkin, 1945; Schumm and Khan, 1972; Tal and Paola, 2007; Braudrick et al., 2009). In none of these experiments effects of vegetation and cohesive fines on bank strength and channel pattern have been studied in a systematic way. Bank cohesion for a range of substrates and effects of vegetation on bank strength have been studied in past experiments (Hoendervoogt, 2008; Van de Lageweg, 2009). However, the governing processes behind bank strength have not been studied thoroughly. The effect of vegetation on bank strength has been studied for natural rivers (Pollen and Simon, 2005; Pollen, 2007, Pollen-Bankhead and Simon, 2010). Vegetation provides cohesion to banks through tensile strength (pulling strength). Field data has shown that tensile strength decreases as vegetation bends due to shearing forces of flow. This bending has been parameterized as the angle of shear distortion (Pollen and Simon, 2005). In order to calibrate initial fluvio-dynamical parameters and channel pattern for the flume experiments, the physics-based Struiksma bar theory has been used (Struiksma et al., 1985; Crosato and Mosselman, 2009). This theory predicts channel pattern, bar type and bar length for natural rivers. Therefore parameters can be calibrated to obtain single-thread meandering rivers with alternating bars. However, the Struiksma bar theory lacks the effect of vegetation and cohesive fines on channel pattern development. In order to study the effect of vegetation on bank strength, supporting Friedkin bank erosion tests have been done. For practical purposes Alfalfa and Rucola shoots have been used. The effect of both high and low plant densities and growth duration on bank erosion rate have been investigated on both plant species. These tests have shown a decrease in bank erosion in the presence of vegetation. Growth duration is the dominant variable, as bank erosion rate is related to plant species after long growth durations. Subsequently, these plant densities and growth durations have been extrapolated to the flume experiments. However, bank strength of river banks is not governed by vegetation only. Previous studies have shown that water retention in varying substrates has a significant effect on bank strength (Simon et al., 2000; Simon and Collison, 2002; Hillel, 2004). Therefore retention curves of mixtures of cohesive fines have been produced as supporting experiments. The range of mixtures consisted of <b>silica</b> <b>flour</b> and poorly sorted sand. Mixtures have been chosen so that the effect of <b>silica</b> <b>flour</b> on water retention could be tested. Flume experiments serve as the synthesis of all the supporting experiments. Effects of both cohesive fines and vegetation have been observed. Seeds have been sown in two scenarios. In the first seeding scenario seeds have been sown at low flow in the same plant densities as in the bank erosion tests. Shoots have grown at low flow in the same duration as the bank erosion tests. In the second seeding scenario seeds have been added periodically to the flow as bed-load at the upstream end of the flume. This has been done daily during 1 hour bankfull flow events. Finally tests have been done in which <b>silica</b> <b>flour</b> has been added periodically at the upstream end. The second seeding scenario has produced vegetation patterns which originate from opportunistic settling of seeds at high-water marks. In conclusion all the tests show a decreasing bank erosion rate in the presence of vegetation and cohesive fines. Results of the bank erosion tests and the flume experiments show that bank erosion rate decreases most significantly with increasing plant growth duration. Therefore the effect of rooting depth seems to be dominant in governing bank strength, not plant density. Furthermore, deposition of <b>silica</b> <b>flour</b> on the floodplains led to a rapid decrease in bank erosion. Similar results have been observed for the experiments with opportunistic seed settling. Seeds settled predominantly on high-water marks, such as levees and scroll bars. After prolonged plant growth the banks are increasingly stable, which has been observed by a decrease in cut-off frequency and occurrence of one single-thread dominant channel. Abovementioned results of this study can be implemented in future flume studies for channel pattern behaviour. Especially effects of varying growth conditions of vegetation and seeding methods on channel patterns are useful for future study...|$|E

Results from the model tests involving layered soils suggest that during liquefaction, a water interlayer or very loose zone of soil develops between the sand and the silt due to the difference in permeabilities.

40|$|Concrete {{and cement}} {{are used in}} constructions {{as well as in}} {{conditioning}} of waste in repositories for radioactive waste. The development of low pH cements for use in geological repositories for radioactive waste stem from concerns over the potential for deleterious effects upon the host rock and other EBS materials (notably bentonite) under the hyperalkaline conditions (pH> 12) of cement pore fluids. Low pH cement (also known as low heat cement) was developed by the cement industry for use where large masses of cement (e. g. dams) could cause problems regarding heat generated during curing. In low pH cements, the amount of cement is reduced by substitution of materials such as fly ash, blast furnace slag, silica fume, and/or non-pozzolanic <b>silica</b> <b>flour.</b> SKB has (as the Finnish Posiva and the Japanese NUMO) defined a pH limit 11 for cement grout leachates. Because low pH cement has little, or no free portlandite, the cement consists predominantly of calcium silicate hydrate (CSH) gel with a Ca/Si ratio 0. 8.

40|$|This {{research}} {{documents the}} use of a 7. 6 cm laboratory Knelson Concentrator (LKC) to determine the amount of gravity recoverable gold (GRG) content in ores and evaluate the performance of gravity circuits, with an emphasis on high gangue density. Two approaches were used to minimize the effect of the high gangue density in estimating the GRG content, oversize removal and 2 : 1 ratio dilution with <b>silica</b> <b>flour.</b> The amount of GRG was determined in four ore samples with an established protocol, yielding values of 35 % to 78 % of total gold. Results from the Angnico-Eagle La Ronde Division (AELRD), Louvicourt and East Malartic mills suggest that the typical Knelson-based gravity circuit which can recover one half to two thirds of GRG from low density gangues will only recover one third to two fifths of the GRG from high density gangues. Simulation of gold recovery at AELRD showed that the high circulating loads, 700 [...] 1100 %, were a significant factor in reducing gold recovery by gravity. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|E
40|$|Braided rivers are {{relatively}} simple to produce in the laboratory, whereas dynamic meandering rivers {{have not been}} sustained beyond initial bend formation. Meandering is theoretically explained by bend instability growing from planimetric perturbation, which convects downstream. In this study, we experimentally tested the importance of upstream perturbation and chute cutoff development in the evolution and dynamics of a meandering channel pattern. The initial straight channel had a transversely moving upstream inlet point and silt-sized <b>silica</b> <b>flour</b> {{was added to the}} sediment feed to allow floodplain formation. We obtained a dynamic meandering river with scroll bars. Bend growth was alternated by chute cutoffs that formed across the point bars. Meandering was maintained as one channel was disconnected by a plug bar. The curvature at the chute bifurcation transported sediment and build a new floodplain, while the other channel widens. At the end of the experiment, the fluvial plain exhibited a meandering channel, point bars, chutes and abandoned and partially filled channels with a slightly cohesive floodplain surface similar to natural meandering gravel bed rivers. We conclude that the necessary and sufficient conditions for dynamic meandering gravel bed river are a sustained dynamic upstream perturbation and floodplain formation...|$|E
40|$|Amending {{irrigation}} furrow inflows with polyacrylamide (PAM) at low concentrations (10 mg L- 1) reduces irrigation-induced erosion by 94 % and increases infiltration by 15 %, relative to untreated furrows. We hypothesized that PAM erosion-control technology would allow irrigation managers to increase furrow inflows to speed furrow-stream advance, produce a more uniform water distribution down field, {{and reduce the}} leaching hazard at the upper end (due to reduced infiltration opportunity time and/or shorter sets). We developed, tested, and installed instruments in a furrow irrigated Portneuf silt loam (Co-Si, mixed, mesic, Durixerollic Calciorthids with 1. 6 % slope) to investigate this premise. Soils were instrumented with repeating pulse multivibrator (CS- 615) soil water sensors, thermocouples, tensiometers, and percolation soil water samplers at upper and lower ends of the furrows. Percolation samplers consisted of a 23 -cm-deep, 20 -cm-dia. stainless-steel beaker with a 1 7 -cm-long, 4 -cm-dia., 0. 5 bar air-entry ceramic cup imbedded in a 5 -cm-deep <b>silica</b> <b>flour</b> layer, slurried into the beaker bottom. Water was collected under suction (- 1. 4 x ambient) via teflon tubes. Percolation sampler design and testing, field installation, and study experimental design are discussed...|$|E

Silicosis is an occupational lung disease caused by inhalation of crystalline silica. People working in occupations like sandblasting, surface drilling, tunneling, <b>silica</b> <b>flour</b> milling, ceramic making, and so forth are predisposed to develop silicosis. Crystalline forms of silica are more fibrogenic than the amorphous forms, highlighting {{the importance of the}} physical form in pathogenesis. Lung biopsy is rarely performed for the diagnosis of silicosis as it can easily be detected by occupational history and radiological features. Patients with silicosis can develop complications like tuberculosis, lung cancer, progressive massive fibrosis, cor pulmonale, broncholithiasis, or tracheobronchial compression by lymphnodes. Pleural involvement in silicosis is rare. Spontaneous pneumothorax is a pleural complication that can develop in such patients. Usually in silicosis pneumothorax is unilateral. We hereby report the lung biopsy findings and discuss the mechanism of pneumothorax development in a case of chronic silicosis who, later on died {{during the course of the}} disease. 1...|$|E
40|$|TH ~ {{electron}} microscope {{has been used}} to study changes in particle size, shape, and arrangement that occur during the hydration of clay in soft-cement. Samples of kaolinite, of a mixture of <b>silica</b> <b>flour</b> and montmorillonite, and of a natural silty clay were mixed with sufficient portland cement to produce soft-cement. Specimens were cured at con-stant moisture content for periods up to 32 weeks after compaction at optimum oisture content for the mixture. At the end of the curing period surfaces of fresh fractures were replicated, and the replicas were studied using the {{electron microscope}}. All three mixtures howed similar behavior. Initially the fabric is one of separate portland cement grains distributed throughout the clay soil. As hydration of the cement proceeds, cement hydrate gel forms along the edges of groups of clay particles. Reaction between the soil and the cement is observed early in the hydration period. As hydration continues the soil grains are more and more broken down and the cement gel diffuses more extensively throughout the mass. Eventually, the breakdown of the soil minerals and the formation of hydration products reaches a point whore the soil and cement can no longer be distinguished asseparate phases...|$|E
40|$|Sedimentary {{deposits}} in reservoir lakes record the sediment transport {{capacity of the}} up-stream river and past water levels of the downstream basin. Volumes and morphologies of deltas {{can be used to}} calculate flow and sediment dynamics. We constructed circular basins to which we fed constant flow discharge over a feeder channel of gravelly sand with different ratios of added <b>silica</b> <b>flour.</b> During water level rise, the fan radius decreased over time. During water level fall, after dam removal, the deltas were partially destroyed. Surprisingly, for low discharges the channel markedly destroyed the deposit through transverse movements of the initial channel whereas for higher discharges the terraces were pre-served for a longer time. Our results indicate that dam removal at wide lakes may lead to an unexpected inverse relation between discharge and erosion of the deposit, which has consequences for the subsequent sediment pulse magnitude. Point-modelling of sediment transport capacity yielded volumes in good agreement with observed volumes, proving that the time scale of activity can be inferred from feeder channel dimensions and delta volume. Our results suggest that these parameters can yield consistent re-construction of formative time scale also on Mars, which has consequences for interpretation of ancient climate...|$|E
