Application of the LPG refractive index sensor has been found in chemical sensing and biochemical sensing, however for application of label-free dip and measure biosensors based on receptor immobilized LPG bio-sensor, the conventional fiber optic refractive index sensors are limited in the refractive index sensitivity, resolution, and operational range owing to the low sensitivity of the cladding mode effective index dependence on the ambient refractive index and the broad-spectrum feature of the LPG transmission spectrum.

The microstructures were examined both after the fibers had been carefully peeled from the matrix and after the fibers had been pulled from the matrix along their axes. The previously noted enhancement by PVA of the pull-out properties from ordinary Portland cement matrix of steel fibers is attributed to the formation of a ductile, fine-grained interfacial layer. The formation of this microstructure is suggusted to arise from the effect of PVA on the nucleation of CH and C [...] -S [...] -H at the fiber surface and on the presence of polymer around the fibers.

40|$|Abstract: Exposing {{an optical}} fiber core to the {{measurand}} <b>surrounding</b> <b>the</b> <b>fiber</b> {{is often used}} to enhance the sensitivity of an optical fiber sensor. This paper reports on the rapid fabrication of microstructures in an optical fiber using a CO 2 laser system which help exposing the optical fiber core to the measurand. The direct-write CO 2 laser system used is originally designed for engraving the polymeric material. Fabrications of microstructures such as in-fiber microhole, D-shaped fiber, in-fiber microchannel, side-sliced fiber and tapered fiber were attempted. The microstructures in the fibers were examined using a SEM and an optical microscope. Quality of microstructures shown by the SEM images and promising results from fluorescence sensor tests using in-fiber microchannels of 100 μm width, 210 μm depth and 10 mm length show the prospect of this method for use in optical fiber sensor development. The direct-write CO 2 laser system is a flexible and fast machining tool for fabricating microstructures in an optical fiber, and can possibly be a replacement of the time consuming chemical etching and polishing methods used for microstructure fabrications of optical the fiber sensors reported in other literatures...|$|E

The active fatigue crack growth failure processes were very similar for both composite orientations tested. For both orientations, fatigue crack growth was along the fiber direction.

The failure of the interface region was apparently driven by normal stresses perpendicular to the fiber direction. The FCG rates were considerably higher for the (90) (8) oriented CT specimens in comparison to the unreinforced material. This is consistent with the scenario in which the interface has lower fatigue resistance than the matrix, causing lower composite fatigue resistance.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze the {{influence}} of hollow fiber module design, specially packing density, and filtration operating mode on the filtration performance. In order to perform this analysis, a model based on the finite element method was used to simulate numerically the flow and filtration velocity along the fiber. An annular region of fluid <b>surrounding</b> <b>the</b> <b>fiber</b> was considered in order to account for the packing density Φ of the module. The originality of this approach lies in the study of fiber density effect on the hydrodynamic conditions, both for inside/out (IO) and outside/in (OI) filtration modes. The numerical simulations of fluid flow have shown a modification of the axial filtration velocity profile with packing density. When the density of fibers was high, filtration took place preferentially in the bottom of the fiber. In contrast, when the packing density was low, permeate flow was higher at the top of the fiber, i. e. the filtration module. Two experimental hollow fiber modules with two packing densities were tested and showed good agreement with the numerical data. These results underline the variations of filtration velocity along the fiber that will allow some predictions on fouling deposit to be done...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{in-plane}} longitudinal {{compressive strength}} of continuous fiber-reinforced composites is {{significantly less than}} their tensile strength, a phenomenon that is still not well understood. Dow and Rosen attempted in 1965 to explain this phenomenon through a fiber microbuckling model, in which each fiber was modeled as a beam-on-an-elastic-foundation. The model, however, grossly overestimates the compressive strength; researchers have since focused on introducing factors that reduce the predicted compressive strength to fit experimen-tally observed values. These include initial fiber waviness, fiber and matrix properties, the interfacial strength, and interphase properties. While empirical results have demonstrated the influences {{of some of these}} factors, an analytical model that can accurately predict the strength while taking into account the underlying failure mechanism is still lacking. The present study treats the compressive strength prediction of continuous fiber-reinforced composites using a different approach. Here, the matrix <b>surrounding</b> <b>the</b> <b>fiber</b> is not assumed to be homogeneous, but is divided into a discrete interphase region adjacent to the fiber and bulk matrix phase beyond the interphase. The three-phase model is shown to provide a more accurate prediction of the compressive strength of typical high-performance composites, such as glass and carbon fiber-reinforced epoxy. The present model’s prediction agrees well with the trends shown in the experimental database available in the literature.

40|$|The uptake {{kinetics}} of fluorene, phenanthrene, fluoranthene, pyrene, and benzo[e]pyrene by solid-phase microextraction fibers was {{studied in}} the presence of dissolved organic matter (DOM) obtained from sediment pore water and resulted in increased fiber absorption and desorption rate coefficients. Compared to the control without DOM, these rate coefficients were increased at a DOM concentration of 36. 62 mg/L by a factor of 1. 27 to 2. 21 and 1. 31 to 2. 10 for fluorene and benzo[e]pyrene, respectively. The calculated values for the fiber absorption and desorption rate coefficients show that diffusion through an unstirred boundary layer (UBL) <b>surrounding</b> <b>the</b> <b>fiber</b> probably forms the rate-limiting step of the process. The mineralization of aqueous-phase phenanthrene and pyrene by a representative polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) -degrading bacterium (Mycobacterium gilvum VM 552) also was found to be enhanced by DOM. The initial degradation rates of phenanthrene (9. 03 µg/L) and pyrene (1. 96 µg/L) were significantly higher compared to the control values and were enhanced by a factor of 1. 32 and 1. 26 at a DOM concentration of 43. 14 and 42. 15 mg/L, respectively. We suggest that such an enhancement results from the combination of faster uptake kinetics of the water-dissolved compounds in the UBL surrounding microbial cells and direct access of the bacteria to DOM-associated PAHs.

Birefringence obtained by removing of a row of holes in a two-ring hexag- onal lattice of holes in a gold covered silica fiber leads to a relatively high sensitivity of the fiber optical response to a refractive index of the analyte <b>surrounding</b> <b>the</b> <b>fiber.</b> This fiber structure supports two types (I and II) of resonant modes. In these modes, there is an opposite variation of some sensing parameters with the increase of the refractive index of the analyte between 1. 36 and 1. 39. Thus, for a smaller value (1. 36) of the refractive index of the analyte na, the resonance spectral width δλ 0. 5 is large for the core mode I and small for the core mode II but for a larger value (1. 39) of na, δλ 0. 5 is small for the core mode I and large for the core mode II.
