40|$|This paper applies a {{new measure}} of the {{effectiveness}} of <b>sterilized</b> <b>interventions</b> to data for 16 economies. The measure is defined as the difference between ex ante(xaEMP) and ex post exchange market pressure(xpEMP). xaEMP is calculated {{on the basis of a}} counterfactual that no intervention takes place and this is the rationally expected policy. xpEMP is the degree of exchange market pressure that remains based on the actual intervention policy in place. Based on a sample of 12 emerging markets, and Hong Kong, Korea, Japan, and Singapore, we conclude that <b>sterilized</b> <b>interventions</b> have persistent exchange rate effects.

In this respect, we provide an explanation for the presumed inconsistency between intervention secrecy and the effectiveness of the signalling channel since our model predicts that interventions will be more effective on average if the central bank retains some degree of ambiguity. Moreover, it is also shown that <b>sterilized</b> <b>interventions</b> will not exert a lasting effect on the exchange rate. Finally, we have also investigated the extent to which some political and economic parameters determine the size of the intervention bias. ...|$|R

50|$|<b>Sterilized</b> <b>intervention</b> is {{a policy}} that {{attempts}} to influence the exchange rate without changing the monetary base. The procedure {{is a combination of}} two transactions. First, the central bank conducts a nonsterilized intervention by buying (selling) foreign currency bonds using domestic currency that it issues. Then the central bank “sterilizes” the effects on the monetary base by selling (buying) a corresponding quantity of domestic-currency-denominated bonds to soak up the initial increase (decrease) of the domestic currency. The net effect of the two operations is the same as a swap of domestic-currency bonds for foreign-currency bonds with no change in the money supply. With sterilization, any purchase of foreign exchange is accompanied by an equal-valued sale of domestic bonds, and vice versa.|$|E
40|$|The paper reviews Japan’s {{experiences}} with the liberalization of foreign exchange controls, and attempts to identify its policy implications for China, focusing on foreign exchange rate regime, capital mobility restrictions, <b>sterilized</b> <b>interventions,</b> and independence of monetary policy. To provide a theoretic foundation, the paper first sets up a simple enlarged Mundell-Fleming model and analyses whether capital account controls and <b>sterilized</b> <b>interventions</b> can maintain managed floating rate regime and independent monetary policy simultaneously. The author argues that it is theoretically possible for a finite time and it is increasingly difficult under circumstances of the expansion in current transactions, and large and persistent capital mobility. Secondly, the paper presents an overview on Japan’s experiences in liberalization of foreign exchange controls from immediate postwar to 1990. Japan adopted gradual steps to liberalize foreign exchange controls, with the freedom in current account in 1964, the shift of exchange rate from pegged to managed floating in 1971, and finally to freely floating in 1973, and the liberalization of capital account in 1980. Japanese experiences of liberalization on foreign exchange controls are mixed. Japan’s long resistances to the unavoidable yen revaluation led t...|$|R

50|$|A <b>sterilized</b> <b>intervention</b> against {{depreciation}} {{can only}} be effective in the medium term if the underlying cause behind the currency's loss of value can be addressed. If the cause was a speculative attack based on political uncertainty this can potentially be resolved. In practice, the cause driving sterilized interventions in the late 20th century was often that a high money supply had meant local interest rates were lower than they were internationally, creating the conditions for a carry trade. This involves market participants borrowing domestically and lending internationally {{at a higher rate}} of interest, a side effect of which is to exert downwards pressure on the currency being borrowed. Because a sterilizing intervention holds the money supply unchanged at its high level, the locally available interest rates can still be low. The carry trade therefore continues to be profitable and the central bank must intervene again if it still wants to prevent depreciation. This can only go on so long before the central bank runs out of foreign currency reserves with which to intervene.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the general equilibrium effects of monetary policy choices on port-folio shares {{of domestic and}} foreign currency denominated securities. Concentrating on the small open economy case, it relates the optimal choice of portfolio shares to the domestic-foreign interest rate differential. The first contribution of the paper {{is to show that}} there are indeed conditions under which a portfolio balance relationship holds in equilibrium, after the effects of government tax and spending policies have been endogenized. This has two important implications. First, monetary policy can be shown to not only affect the level of inflation via a target path for the nominal anchor, but also the volatility (and also the level) of inflation via balance sheet operations. Most strikingly, <b>sterilized</b> <b>intervention</b> affects interest rates through its effect on inflation volatility. Second, this provides a theory of currency risk premia and their endogenous determination by fundamentals and monetary policy, including a determination of the conditions under which risk premia are or are not significant. We identify two factors that affect the effectiveness of <b>sterilized</b> <b>intervention.</b> The first is the prevalence of exogenous fiscal spending shocks, shocks that induce budget balancing exchange rate movements instead of being financed by endogenous tax responses. The sec-ond is the central bank’s initial balance sheet position- <b>sterilized</b> <b>intervention</b> has the largest effects if the government has only issued small amounts of domestic currency denominated debt. This suggests that the conditions that give rise to this type of imperfect asset substi-tutability {{are more likely to be}} observed in developing countries...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{integrates}} exchange-rate policy into a {{model of}} exchange- rate behavior, and examines the data econometrically to infer hypotheses about policy behavior in the 1970 s. The model shows how unanticipated movements in money, the current account, and relative price levels will cause first a jump in the exchange rate, and then a movement along a "saddle path" to the new long run equilibrium. Here the role of "news" in moving the exchange rate is clear. The model is {{used to analyze the}} options available to the central bank that wants to reduce the jump in the exchange rate following a real or monetary disturbance. The distinction is made between monetary policy and <b>sterilized</b> <b>intervention,</b> and a regime in which the domestic interest rate is used as the policy variable is also studied. Systems of vector autoregressions (VARs) for each of four countries [...] the U. S., the U. K., Germany, and Japan [...] are estimated, and the correlations among their residuals are studied. These represent the "innovations," or "news" in the time series. A clear pattern emerges in these correlations, in which policy in the U. S. {{and to a lesser extent}} Japan, drives exchange rates, and policy in Germany and the U. K. reacts. It appears that U. S. monetary policy is essentially determined by domestic considerations, with the exchange rate moving as a consequence.
