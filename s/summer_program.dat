5|$|Coonley died in 1958; ACS {{had looked}} to Coonley for her {{leadership}} {{over the years}} but even more so for her philanthropy.

5|$|Copeland {{auditioned for}} several dance {{programs}} in 1999, and each made her {{an offer to}} enroll in its <b>summer</b> <b>program.</b> She performed with ABT {{as part of its}} 1999 and 2000 Summer Intensive programs.

Her mother insisted that she finish high school, and so Copeland returned to California for her senior year, even though ABT arranged to pay for her performances, housing accommodations and academic arrangements. She studied at the Summer Intensive Program on full scholarship for both summers and was declared ABT's National Coca-Cola Scholar in 2000. In the 2000 Summer Intensive Program, she danced the role of Kitri in Don Quixote. Copeland's strongest memory from the summer is working with Tharp on Push Comes to Shove".

40|$|How youth {{spend their}} time has become an {{increasingly}} important factor in studying adolescent development. During the summer months, longer periods of unsupervised time {{have been associated with}} a loss of academic skills and lower social-emotional skills. One support for at-risk youth and adolescents might be <b>summer</b> <b>programs</b> housed in community-based organizations. Using a pre-post test design over an 11 -week period, the present study examines the linkages among participation in <b>summer</b> <b>programs,</b> individual characteristics, and youth outcomes among ethnically diverse, low-income Chicago youth. Analyses revealed ethnicity was related to math skills {{at the end of the}} summer, although the strongest predictor of mathematic ability at the end of the summer was academic skills at the beginning of the summer. Higher participation in <b>summer</b> <b>programs</b> was associated with more empathetic feelings on a self-report measure. Future directions and implications for studying community-based <b>summer</b> <b>programs</b> are discussed...|$|R
