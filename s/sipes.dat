Typically, wide, straight grooves {{have a low}} noise level and good water removal. More lateral grooves usually increase traction. <b>Sipes</b> are small grooves that are cut across larger tread elements. Up to a point, more <b>sipes</b> give more traction in snow or mud.|$|E

This environmental chamber study compared physiological responses of volunteers exercising in MOPP 0, MOPP 1, and MOPP 4 with equivalent <b>SIPE</b> configurations, including <b>SIPE</b> 4 with and without ambient air microclimate cooling (MCC). Responses to all uniforms were compared over 100 minutes of continuous treadmill walking at 30.0 deg C, 50% rh. Responses to MOPP 4 and <b>SIPE</b> 4 with no cooling were also compared over 100 minutes at 18.5 deg C, 50% rh. Responses to MOPP 4 and <b>SIPE</b> 4 MCC were compared over four hours of intermittent work-rest cycles at 30.0 deg C, [...]50% rh. There were no differences between MOPP 0 and <b>SIPE</b> 0, MOPP 1 and <b>SIPE</b> 1, and MOPP 4 and <b>SIPE</b> 4 with no cooling (in both environments) [...] Core temperature, skin temperature, heat storage, and heart rate were lower in <b>SIPE</b> 4 MCC than in MOPP 4; while evaporative cooling was greater in <b>SIPE</b> 4 MCC than in MOPP 4. Three volunteers completed the 4-hour tests in <b>SIPE</b> 4 MCC with similar advantageous trends apparent from the cooling. It is concluded that the <b>SIPE</b> clothing did not increase thermal strain compared to equivalent MOPP levels, and MCC, (although increasing uniform weight by approximately 10 kg) reduced thermal strain at 30.0 deg Celsius.|$|R
