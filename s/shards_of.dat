5|$|Each {{set from}} <b>Shards</b> <b>of</b> Alara to Eldritch Moon {{featured}} five Intro Packs. They contained a 60-card pre-constructed deck, {{as well as}} two booster packs from the set they accompany and a rule guide.|$|E
5|$|Many shells {{exploded}} in the trees, sending <b>shards</b> <b>of</b> steel and wood into the ground, but the men were protected by their reinforced foxholes. The German guns cut deep holes the size of trucks in the pasture.|$|E
5|$|Previously, {{cards were}} also sold in Tournament Packs {{typically}} containing three rares, ten uncommons, thirty-two commons, and thirty basic lands. Tournament Packs were discontinued after <b>Shards</b> <b>of</b> Alara.|$|E

5|$|<b>Shards</b> <b>of</b> Alara also debuted mythic rares (red-orange), which replace one {{in eight}} rare cards on average. There are also premium {{versions}} of every card with holographic foil, randomly inserted into some boosters {{in place of}} a common, which replace about one in seventy cards.|$|E
5|$|Greenland ice cores show {{evidence}} of a large volcanic eruption in 1642±5BCE, which was suggested as being associated with Santorini. However, volcanic ash retrieved from an ice core does not match the expected Santorini fingerprint. The late Holocene eruption of the Mount Aniakchak, a volcano in Alaska, is now {{believed to be the}} source of the minute <b>shards</b> <b>of</b> volcanic glass in the Greenland ice core.|$|E
5|$|More tornadic {{damage was}} {{reported}} in southern Durham and Killingworth, with some homes severely damaged, {{but there were some}} minor injuries, one young woman in Killingworth was injured by <b>shards</b> <b>of</b> glass from a breaking window. Some sources insist that the Wallingford tornado dissipated a few miles west of the town, and this was an entirely separate tornado, but without a modern damage survey it is impossible to tell. The parent storm finally moved out over the ocean around 8 PM.|$|E

5|$|On July 14, 2004, {{four people}} {{were struck by}} flying debris while riding the coaster. Reports {{indicated}} that a metal cable frayed during launch, shearing off <b>shards</b> <b>of</b> metal that struck the riders. The injuries were mainly arm abrasions, with one passenger experiencing cuts to the face. They were treated at the park's first aid station, and two later sought further medical attention.|$|E
5|$|Roman remains, {{possibly}} a signal station or watchtower, {{have been identified}} on the island by an electrical resistance survey. Accurate exploration and interpretation of the site is difficult as it was reused by builders in both the Victorian era and during World War II. A carved stone head found on the island in 1991 {{is likely to be}} a Celtic head from the Romano-British era, but may be from the Iron Age. In addition to <b>shards</b> <b>of</b> cooking pots from the Roman era, some luxury items have been identified including Arretine ware, La Tène style brooches, and an amphora dating from between 90 and 140AD which was made in southern Spain. There have also been <b>shards</b> <b>of</b> Castor ware. Fragments of pottery roofing and box flue tiles have been identified signifying the presence of a heating system and {{possibly a}} bath house. Roman coins from the reigns of Claudius Gothicus (268–270) and Tetricus I (271–273) have also been found.|$|E
5|$|Several of the {{downtown}} buildings were damaged in a major tornado in March 2008, scattering glass from several hundred feet. It took workers several days to clean the buildings and remove all of the loose <b>shards</b> <b>of</b> glass from the skyscrapers. No structural damage was reported, and by late 2010 each skyscraper had all of its windows replaced. Window blinds and other office objects from the tall buildings were found {{as far away as}} Oakland Cemetery.|$|E
50|$|Ephriam: A codebearer captain {{from the}} <b>shard</b> <b>of</b> Abiosis who only {{appears in the}} first book.|$|R
50|$|In April 2015 a {{prisoner}} was stabbed with a <b>shard</b> <b>of</b> glass and almost bled to death.|$|R
50|$|In {{excavation}} at Mirabat, a <b>shard</b> <b>of</b> Roman amphora {{was found}} {{at the bottom of}} a water tank.|$|R
5|$|The {{majority}} of cards {{are sold in}} booster packs, which contain fifteen cards normally divided into four rarities, which can be differentiated {{by the color of}} the expansion symbol. A fifteen-card Booster Pack will typically contain one rare (gold), three uncommons (silver), ten commons (black), and one basic land (colored black, as commons). Sets prior to <b>Shards</b> <b>of</b> Alara contained eleven commons instead of a basic land.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{exterior}} of the Pont du Gard is rough and relatively unfinished, the builders took care to ensure that the interior of the water conduit was as smooth as possible so that the flow of water would not be obstructed. The walls of the conduit were constructed from dressed masonry and the floor from concrete. Both were covered with a stucco incorporating minute <b>shards</b> <b>of</b> pottery and tile. It was painted with olive oil and covered with maltha, a mixture of slaked lime, pork grease and the viscous juice of unripe figs. This produced a surface that was both smooth and durable.|$|E
5|$|Museum curators {{consider}} {{visitors who}} pick up {{items from the}} ground to be thieves, and local police will charge them as such. The maximum penalty is a prison sentence of ten years. On 22 June 2015, two British youths from the Perse School were convicted of theft after picking up buttons and <b>shards</b> <b>of</b> decorative glass they found on the ground near the area where camp victims' confiscated personal effects were stored. The boys, both 17 years old, received probation and were fined £170, but later appealed the sentence. Curators said that similar incidents happen {{once or twice a}} year.|$|E

5|$|Shooting {{took place}} over several days at Music Bank, the famous {{rehearsal}} studios in London. Actor Michael spent forty hours practising the drumming beforehand, but with vision inside the suit limited to a camera feed piped to a small screen inside the head, precision was almost impossible. Many takes ended with the wooden drum sticks broken against the rims, sending <b>shards</b> <b>of</b> wood flying off-camera. This, combined with the difficulty of choreographing the delicate movements of the gorilla head with Michael's acting, meant that 35takes were required to produce the final 90-second scene.|$|E
5|$|Sonic and Shadow play fast-paced levels, {{emphasizing}} platforming and gameplay. Their homing attack can lock onto robots {{created by}} Eggman and G.U.N., {{and they can}} grind on rails. Tails' and Eggman's levels are slower and oriented towards multi-directional shooting; they are confined to mechs {{in which they can}} jump short heights, hover and shoot enemies. Knuckles' and Rouge's levels are open and feature action-adventure gameplay with treasure hunting; in each level, they must find three <b>shards</b> <b>of</b> the Master Emerald. Their search is guided by radar and puzzle-based clues from harmless robots. Knuckles and Rouge can glide, defeat enemies with punches and kicks and scale walls, digging into them to find power-ups.|$|E
5|$|Tetra {{remains in}} the castle while Link and the King journey to the two sages who {{provided}} the Master Sword's power. They discover Ganon's forces murdered them both, so Link must awaken new sages: the Rito Medli and the Korok Makar. The sages restore the Master Sword, but the King learns that Ganon has abandoned the Forsaken Fortress, and fears an attack. They then track down the eight <b>shards</b> <b>of</b> the missing Triforce of Courage, once kept by the Hero of Time, and the gods recognize Link as the Hero of the Winds.|$|E

50|$|<b>Shard</b> <b>of</b> Spring is a {{role-playing}} {{video game}} developed by TX Digital Illusions {{and published by}} Strategic Simulations for the Apple II, Commodore 64 and MS-DOS computers in 1986. <b>Shard</b> <b>of</b> Spring {{tells the story of}} a group of adventurers hired to retrieve the titular magical item stolen by a power-hungry evil witch. The game was generally well received upon its release and was followed by a sequel titled Demon's Winter in 1988.|$|R

5|$|A {{survey by}} {{archaeologist}} Howard Thomas in 1979 unearthed {{a number of}} medieval potsherds {{in the vicinity of}} the farmhouse and found evidence of continuous occupation of the island including middens containing numerous animal bones along with oyster and cockle shells. Fragments of green glazed jugs and flagons from the late 12th to 13th century and <b>shards</b> <b>of</b> pottery from the 14th century were also found on the island. The presence of Pennant sandstone roofing tiles and a fragment of a 14th-century glazed ridge tile indicate the existence of a substantial medieval building, possibly a chapel, demolished when the present farmhouse was constructed. Property records from 1542 show that King Henry VIII granted a lease to farm the island to a gentleman by the name of Edmund Tournor. His family remained on Flat Holm until the end of the 17th century when the lease passed to Joseph Robins.|$|E
5|$|After his {{transfer}} to JG 27, Galland met Mölders again. Due to his injuries, Galland could never match Mölders' sharp eyesight; the <b>shards</b> <b>of</b> glass {{in his eyes}} denied him that capacity. However, Mölders, by that time a recognised ace (a pilot with five or more aerial victories), shared what experiences he could with Galland; leadership in the air, tactics and organisation. Mölders was Geschwaderkommodore of Jagdgeschwader 53 {{at the time of}} their meeting. In order for Galland to gain experience on the Bf 109E, which Galland lacked, he offered Galland the chance to join his unit which was flying patrols along the French border. During these sorties, Galland learned Mölders' tactics, such as using spotter aircraft to indicate the position of enemy formation, as an early warning system. Galland learned to allow the Staffel to operate freely in order to seize the initiative and surprise. Taking his findings back to JG 27, its commander Max Ibel, agreed to their implementation. Galland gained further experience as a combat leader acting as the Gruppenkommandeur, when the Gruppenkommandeur went on leave.|$|E
5|$|On April 13, 1992, Reagan was {{assaulted}} by an anti-nuclear protester during a luncheon speech while accepting an {{award from the}} National Association of Broadcasters in Las Vegas. The protester, 41-year old Richard Paul Springer, smashed a 2-foot-high (60cm) 30-pound (13.5kg) crystal statue of an eagle that the broadcasters had given the former president. Flying <b>shards</b> <b>of</b> glass hit Reagan, {{but he was not}} injured. Using media credentials, Springer intended to announce government plans for an underground nuclear weapons test in the Nevada desert the following day. Springer was the founder of an anti-nuclear group called the 100th Monkey. Following his arrest on assault charges, a Secret Service spokesman could not explain how Springer got past the federal agents who guarded Reagan's life at all times. Later, Springer pled guilty to reduced charges and said he hadn't meant to hurt Reagan through his actions. He pled guilty to a misdemeanor federal charge of interfering with the Secret Service, but other felony charges of assault and resisting officers were dropped.|$|E
