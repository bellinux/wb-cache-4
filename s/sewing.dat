As the drug, a water-insoluble agonist of sphingosine- 1 -phosphate type 1 receptor (<b>SEW</b> 2871) was selected. <b>SEW</b> 2871 (<b>SEW)</b> was water-solubilized by micelle formation with gelatin grafted by L-lactic acid oligomer. <b>SEW</b> micelles were mixed with gelatin, followed by dehydrothermal crosslinking of gelatin to obtain gelatin hydrogels incorporating <b>SEW</b> micelles. <b>SEW</b> was released from the hydrogels incorporating <b>SEW</b> micelles in vitro and in vivo. The water-solubilized <b>SEW</b> showed in vitro macrophage migration activity.

5|$|Following a {{demonstration}} at Remington's offices in New York, the company contracted on March1, 1873, to manufacture 1,000machines, with {{the option to}} produce an additional 24,000.

Remington dedicated a wing of its factory to the typewriter, and spent several months retooling and re-engineering the device; production began in September and the machine entered the market on July1, 1874. Typewriter production was largely overseen by Jefferson Clough and William K. Jenne, manager of Remington's <b>sewing</b> machine division. The redesigned machine was sturdier and more reliable than Sholes' model, but it had taken on some of the characteristics of a <b>sewing</b> machine, including a japanned case with floral ornamentation and a stand with a treadle to operate the carriage return.

40|$|Graduation date: 2003 Rat selenoprotein W (<b>SeW)</b> {{promoter}} {{activity was}} investigated using different concentrations of cadmium, copper, and zinc. Two fragments (404 bp and 1265 bp) of the <b>SeW</b> promoter, containing a single metal response element (MRE), were ligated into the {{multiple cloning site}} of a pGL 3 -Basic reporter plasmid. The constructs were transfected into cultured rat C 6 (glial) and L 8 (myoblast) cells and promoter activity measured by means of luciferase reporter gene fused to the <b>SeW</b> promoter fragments in the reporter plasmid. With post-transfection exposure of these cell lines to these metals, copper and zinc, but not cadmium, significantly increased promoter activity of the unmutated 1265 bp (not 404 bp) construct (p< 0. 05) only in the C 6 cells. Mutation of the MRE sequence abolished promoter response to metal exposure but did not eliminate promoter activity. The results suggest that <b>SeW</b> expression in glial cells can be increased on exposure to copper and zinc and that this response {{is dependent on the}} MRE sequence present in the <b>SeW</b> promoter. To understand transcriptional regulation of the <b>SeW</b> gene, we used in vitro binding assays to identify transcription factors that may be involved in the transcriptional regulation of the <b>SeW</b> gene. Using protein from rat C 6 (glial) cell nuclear extracts, oligonucleotides containing putative regulatory elements in the <b>SeW</b> promoter, and antibodies, we were able to show that the specificity protein 1 (Sp 1) transcription factor binds to the Sp 1 consensus sequence in the <b>SeW</b> promoter as well as the MRE. However, the MRE, GRE, AP- 1 and LF-A 1 did not yield any specific binding. Although, competition analysis showed specific binding at the TFII- 1 site, super-shift analysis using anti-TFII- 1 antibody did not yield any super-shifted band. Therefore the <b>SeW</b> gene may be a target for Sp 1 whose interaction with the <b>SeW</b> promoter may activate or repress the transcription of <b>SeW...</b>|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1999 The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to further determine the distribution of selenoprotein W (<b>SeW)</b> in tissues from rats and sheep fed different selenium levels and to search for the possible functions of this protein. In the rat study a total of 28 rat tissues were examined and <b>SeW</b> was found in all of the tissues except for liver, thyroid, pancreas, pituitary and eyes regardless of the level of Se fed. <b>SeW</b> was not detected in heart, lungs, prostate, esophagus, small intestine, tongue, skin diaphragm and skeletal muscle from selenium deficient rats, but was present in these tissues when the two higher levels of selenium (0. 1 and 4. 0 mg/kg) were fed. <b>SeW</b> has the highest expression in muscle, brain, testis and spleen when selenium is adequate. Interestingly, selenium deficiency resulted in undetectable <b>SeW</b> levels in heart and muscle from deficient sheep and rats, but the content in brain was unaffected by selenium status. Second generation selenium depleted and repleted rats indicated that the expression of <b>SeW</b> in cortex and cerebellum was not significantly affected by selenium, but selenium increased its levels in thalamus. Cortex had the highest <b>SeW</b> expression among the three parts of the rat brain. <b>SeW</b> levels in muscle, spleen, skin and testis were undetectable in weanling rats, but became detectable after 6 weeks of selenium repletion. Studies with various brain cell cultures indicated that Se appears to be metabolized differently by different brain cell types. As demonstrated in neuroblastoma and glial cells, glutathione peroxidase (GPX) activity decreased at a faster rate than <b>SeW</b> with neuroblastoma cells whereas <b>SeW</b> decreased at a faster rate than GPX activity in glial cells when selenium was removed from the media. Since other work showed that glutathione was bound to <b>SeW,</b> it was speculated that it has antioxidant function similar to other selenoproteins. <b>SeW</b> overexpressed and underexpressed cell lines were established by DNA recombinant techniques. There was a greater survival rate of overexpressed cells when incubated with 2, 2 '-Azobis (2 -amidinopropane) dihydrochloride (AAPH) than control cells, suggesting <b>SeW</b> possibly has an antioxidant function...|$|R
40|$|Segregated {{early weaning}} (<b>SEW)</b> {{works well with}} pasture-farrowed pigs. The <b>SEW</b> pasture-farrowed pigs weighed {{about the same as}} {{conventionally}} weaned pigs at 9 weeks of age with lower death losses (about 2 % less). For the period 5 – 9 weeks of age the <b>SEW</b> pigs gained more rapidly and were more efficient converting feed to live gain than pigs weaned at 5 weeks of age and moved to an open-front shelter. However, costs were presumably higher for the <b>SEW</b> pigs because of higher labor costs from multiple feedings per day, higher-priced pig feed for early weaned pigs, higher utility costs, and the added cost of a nursery unit. Based on the results of this trial, <b>SEW</b> is compatible with pasture farrowing. However, pasture farrowing may not be as compatible with the mechanics of <b>SEW.</b> For example, because pasture farrowing is seasonal, the <b>SEW</b> nursery may not be kept full at all times. This would reduce the throughput, the number of pigs through the unit, which would increase the fixed building costs per pig. A new approach of putting newly weaned 2 -week-old, 10 -lb pigs directly into a finishing unit would partially alleviate this situation or lower fixed cost <b>SEW</b> nurseries are needed that then could be used on a seasonal basis. On the other hand, the technique of early weaning pasture-farrowed pigs has the potential of extending the farrowing season while reducing piglet mortality and minimizing the negative effects of weather extremes. By its nature, a one-litter pasture-farrowing system may benefit less from <b>SEW</b> than other more intensive or continuous pig production systems. In a one-litter system considerable age segregation of pigs occurs on the farm at all times. The sows are sold after weaning. At most times throughout the year the pigs on the farm are the same age. If the herd already has a high health status, the advantages of <b>SEW</b> are much less. Therefore, <b>SEW</b> will work for pasture farrowed pigs but herd health status and overall <b>SEW</b> costs need to be carefully evaluated. A cost comparison of <b>SEW</b> for pasture-farrowed pigs is elsewhere in this report...|$|R
