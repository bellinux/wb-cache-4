50|$|Commercial fishing today uses {{a variety}} of {{techniques}} for fishing. Fishing rods with baited hooks and fishing lines used in various ways are used for fishing for some particular types of fish. Fishing using nets like cast nets, hand nets, drift nets, gillnets, seine nets, trawl nets, <b>surrounding</b> <b>nets</b> etc. of various sizes and construction as well as longline fishing with hundreds of hooks on a line fishing both for bottom and pelagic fish (near surface fish) are the most common devices used to catch high yields of fish. The crab fisheries uses crab pots baited with dead fish to catch crabs.In some parts of the Pacific Northwest, fishing with baited traps is also common. Common commercial methods for catching shrimp and prawns include bottom trawling, cast nets, seines, shrimp baiting and dip netting. Bottom trawling often tears up the ocean bottom and can be very destructive to all bottom dwelling fish. Trawling involves the use of a system of nets deployed on or near the sea floor. Benthic trawling is towing or dragging a net at the very bottom of the ocean. Demersal trawling is towing a net just above the benthic zone. Midwater trawling (pelagic trawling) is trawling, or net fishing nearer the surface of the ocean.|$|E
40|$|Studies {{have been}} {{conducted}} on the sexual development, maturity and reproduction of the dolphinfish (Coryphaena hippurus L. 1758) in the Mediterranean area, with special reference to the Balearic islands and Sicily. Professional fishing, carried out from August to December 1996, uses FADs (Fish Attracting Devices) and <b>surrounding</b> <b>nets.</b> 2087 juvenile specimens of dolphinfish from the Ionian and southern Tyrrhenian seas, the Strait of Sicily and the Balearic islands were sampled. A small number of adult fish (39), which are not usually caught in <b>surrounding</b> <b>nets,</b> was sampled in the swordfish long-line by-catch. The gonads of the young fish were analysed monthly to establish the stage of development of the ovaries or testes, {{during the first few}} months of life. The gonads of the adult fish, sampled in the months of June-September only, were all mature. The specimens caught between October and December presented maturity stage V in the case of the females and I in the case of the males, indicating the end of the reproductive period. The gonado-somatic index (GSI) and condition factor (CF) were calculated for both genders. The trend of the GSI confirms the presence of immature specimens as regards the juvenile fish; the low value of GSI was obtained for the adults, probably associated with the post-reproduction conditions found in the October-December period. Most of the gonads sampled during the months between August and December belonged to young specimens born in early summer. This is confirmed by the juvenile stages (FL 2. 5 to 4. 3 cm) caught with plankton nets in the Strait of Messina area in July...|$|E

40|$|In {{this note}} we {{describe}} the dolphinfish (Coryphaena hippurus) fishery off Tunisian waters (central Mediterranean). Dolphinfish is fished from late August to early December, with the main catches in September-October, using fish aggregation devices and <b>surrounding</b> <b>nets.</b> A total of 260 boats are devoted to this fishery along the whole Tunisian coast, with an average annual catch of around 300 metric tonnes. The main fishing areas and ports are located on the central-eastern coast, which concentrates around 70 - 75 % of fishing effort and landings. Both the sesonality of the fishery and the length composition of the catches, with a clear increase in mean size during the fishing period (from 26. 0 cm fork length in August to 44 cm fork length in December), {{are similar to those}} reported in other Mediterranean areas...|$|E

40|$|The {{pilotfish}} (Naucrates ductor) is an epipelagic oceanic species, whose 0 -group specimens tend {{to aggregate}} below flotsam, constituting a principal by-catch {{of the western}} Mediterranean FAD fishery. During a one-year survey sampling, monthly experimental hauls using <b>surrounding</b> <b>nets</b> were conducted at sites in south Peloponnesian waters, where FADs were moored; during the summer-early autumn months bongo tows were also carried out. 0 -group pilotfish appeared beneath FADs from mid-summer till early winter and the total length of the collected specimens ranged between 120 and 330 mm. Pilotfish larvae, measuring 2. 0 - 3. 9 mm, were found at FAD sites in mid-summer and in early autumn. The age of juvenile specimens, determined by counting daily increments on their sagittae, ranged between 50 - 141 increments (days) for males, and 51 - 131 increments (days) for females. The predicted asymptotic length {{was found to be}} 412. 3 mm TL for males and 435. 2 mm TL for females. The onset of sexual maturity appeared to occur when specimens were a few months old.

The most abundant species from experimental net catches were Trachurus picturatus, which represented over 80 % of the specimens caught in spring and summer, Naucrates ductor, which represented about 50 % of autumn catches, both in terms of abundance and biomass, and Seriola dumerili, which represented 46 % and 21 % of the samples taken in summer and autumn respectively. Seriola dumerili was also frequent in commercial net catches, in which T. picturatus did not appear, while Coryphaena hippurus and N. ductor represented more than 85 % of both abundance and biomass. Large differences between the two types of net were also obtained in the mean fish weight and length frequency distributions of the catches by season. Fish caught with the experimental net ranged from 6 to 570 mm length, while fish collected from commercial hauls had a size range of 35 to 700 mm. The effectiveness of the experimental net in catching small fishes showed that it can be an optimal sampling method not only in the study of fish fauna associated with flotsam, but also in studies to catch early life stages...|$|E
40|$|Despite the {{considerable}} importance of artisanal fishing in Kainji Lake lower basin, knowledge about gear and craft being used is deficient and outdated. Little {{is also known}} as to why fishermen adopted the diverse fishing gear and craft they use in the Lake, as well as the relationship of these input factors to the socio-economic status of the fishermen and ecology of the lake. To address these issues, a survey of sixty (60) artisanal fishers and twelve (12) village leaders drawn from 12 selected communities was undertaken. The survey was performed as a structured questionnaire to the fishers, and as unstructured interviews with the heads of the fishing villages (Maigari). The data collected were analyzed in a dual way: as general statistics of the population of fishers (aggregate analysis), and as multi-dimensional statistics of the individual respondents (respondent analysis). The survey showed that the commonest gear are gill nets, cast nets, hooks and line, traps, <b>surrounding</b> <b>nets,</b> beach seines and lift nets. The kind of craft used in the region is planked canoe (paddle and mechanized) with flat bottom hull, and ownership varies across fishermen. Fish diversity is high, and along this survey # species (# families) were detected. There was a trend for association of species to types of fishing gear, and each fisher could own a number of gear types in different amounts. The most frequent species in the catches is x, but in terms of biomass y seems to be the most important, while Nile perch (Lates niloticus) is relevant for fishers is because of its commercial value. The Hausa ethnic group is dominant in number among the resident fishers. Relationship between gear types and socio-economic status of the fishers revealed inter alia that fishermen that use gill nets, cast nets and hook & line tend to have larger households, belong to a cooperative society, married and older than their counterparts. Settled older fishers are often members of the local cooperative group (fadama), an organization that seems to be less interesting or inclusive for young fishers or outsiders. This seems to exclude these workers from access to credit. The fishers generated a relatively good (gross) income compared to e. g. civil servants in of the state. The majority of the fishers, particularly the settled older men, are part-time in fishing with the possibility of pursuing other activities to generate income. There was contradiction in the opinions of most fishers and village leaders concerning the status and trends of the fisheries in the basin. Further research is needed to provide a better understanding on: (i) dynamics of change of gear with respects to daily or seasonal occurrence; (ii) social dynamics of the fishery...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{media and}} public discourses <b>surrounding</b> <b>net</b> neutrality, with particular attention to public utility philosophy, from a critical perspective. The article suggests that further public education about net neutrality would be beneficial.

In order to contextualize the debate, an overview of public utility philosophy is provided, shedding light on how the Internet can be conceptualized as a public good. Following this discussion, an analysis of mainstream media is presented, exploring how the media represents the issue of net neutrality and whether or not the Internet is discussed through the lens of public utility. To further examine how the net neutrality debate is being addressed, and to see the potential impacts of media discourses on the general public, the results of a focus group are reported and analyzed. Finally, a discussion assesses the implications of the net neutrality debate as presented through media discourses, highlighting the future of net neutrality as an important policy issue...|$|R

50|$|In the 1980s and 1990s, fishing {{operations}} had a deleterious {{effect on the}} conditions in the area due to increased number of fishermen (many from outside the area) also adopting unacceptable practices for fishing such as dynamite, beach seines and kigumi fishing, where corals are broken deliberately to force fish out into the <b>surrounding</b> <b>net.</b> Local poisonous weed called “Utupa” also aggravated the problem. Studies also indicated that the traditional “dago” system of temporary fishing camp during the fishing season was replaced by permanent settlements, which caused serious damage to the coral reefs of the bay. In order to control these activities, local villagers started operating patrols in the fishing zones, such as in Fumbal peninsula, with proactive support of the Commission of Natural Resources.
