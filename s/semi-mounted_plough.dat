40|$|In the {{literary}} {{part of the}} diploma thesis, {{a brief overview of}} the current state in the tractor design has been done, concentrating onto such elements that lead to lowering of fuel consumption. The practical part is based on the realized solution. The target of the measurement was to prove the influence of adjusting of the three-point hitch onto the output parameters of ploughing sets, consisting of the Zetor Forterra 140 HSX tractor and Kverneland 150 B mounted plough or Kverneland PN 100 <b>semi-mounted</b> <b>plough.</b> The essence of the measurement was gradual shortening of the upper linkage of the three-point hitch, whereas simultaneously with shortening of the linkage, the force on the linkage was rising. The force was measured by means of strain gauge Hotinger U 2 A. In case of the mounted plough it has been proved that shortening of the upper linkage causes rising of the force. That shifts part of the plough weight onto the rear wheels of the tractor, resulting in lower wheel slipping and lower fuel consumption...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is force effect {{analysis}} of ploughing rigs. MSC Adams software was used for mathematical-physical model drafting and subsequent evaluation of measured data from tensometrical load sensing. Designed model was utilized for force reactions calculations under the driving wheels of a tractor using analysis of spatial system of forces of tractors three point hitch. Field measurement data and data from MSC Adams software were tabular and graphically processed. Dependencies between plough and tractor connection setting and output performance of ploughing rigs were clarified. Results from experimental measurement with fully-mounted plough point out on the utilization of longitudinal and lateral position of ploughs CG for reducing of difference in load between furrow and land wheel with properly adjusted connection between plough and tractor. A result from experimental measurement with <b>semi-mounted</b> <b>plough</b> confirms the fact of significant difference in vertical load between rear axle wheels. This negative phenomenon could be eliminated with usage of traction cylinder localized in construction of semi-mounted ploughs over the horizontal joint. Correct adjustment of tractors three point hitch in case of fully-mounted ploughs and utilization of traction cylinder in case of semi-mounted ploughs have got positive influence on fuel consumption and field performance of ploughing rigs...|$|E

25|$|Driving {{with all}} four wheels on unploughed land is another {{solution}} to the problem of wide tyres. <b>Semi-mounted</b> <b>ploughs</b> can be hitched in are heavier and more expensive than right-handed models, but they have the great advantage of leaving a level surface which makes seedbed preparation and harvesting easier. Very little marking out is necessary before ploughing can start and idle running on the headland is minimal compared with conventional ploughs.|$|R
25|$|Modern ploughs {{are usually}} {{multiple}} reversible ploughs, {{mounted on a}} tractor via a three-point linkage. These commonly have between two {{and as many as}} seven mouldboardsâ€“ and <b>semi-mounted</b> <b>ploughs</b> (the lifting of which is supplemented by a wheel about halfway along their length) can have as many as eighteen mouldboards. The hydraulic system of the tractor is used to lift and reverse the implement, as well as to adjust furrow width and depth. The ploughman still has to set the draughting linkage from the tractor so that the plough is carried at the proper angle in the soil. This angle and depth can be controlled automatically by modern tractors. As a complement to the rear plough a two or three mouldboards-plough can be mounted {{on the front of the}} tractor if it is equipped with front three-point linkage.|$|R
