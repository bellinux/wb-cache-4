40|$|SummaryWith {{the advent}} of locking screws {{fixation}} devices, came new problems when removing internal fixation hardware. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate these problems and their possible solutions. The first problem was screws jamming on the plate, secondary to either initial poor screwing technique (with inadequate placement of the targeting device) or use of excessive force (when screwing in the screws without using the torque-controlling screwdriver). Treatment consists of destroying the screw heads using tungsten drills. The screw bodies can then be extracted using a trephine drill. The second problem involves destruction of the recess of the screw head. It can be secondary to overly forceful screw insertion or risky screw extraction. This can be treated using a specific conical left-turn screwdriver, assuming that the screw/plate thread is still intact. Finally, the <b>screw</b> <b>recess</b> can be filled. The plate itself may be a source of problems when being extracted because the screw holes left free also have been filled. Lever arm maneuvers to raise the fibrous bridges and substantial traction along the axis can be useful. These problems are more frequent with minimally invasive surgery. The consequences of this fixation type's hardware removal surgery are multiple: lengthened operative time, risk of secondary maximally invasive surgery, presence of metallic shavings residues in cases of screw head destruction, and the risk of iterative fracture secondary to trephine drill use. Prevention is thus essential. It is based on rigorous technique in placing the targeting device, drilling, and inserting screws, the systematic use of the torque-controlling screwdriver, and the verification of proper screw position. The locking compression plate (LCP) material is highly effective but its removal should not become challenging. Level of evidenceLevel V...|$|E

50|$|Drywall screws heads have {{a curved}} taper, which {{allows them to}} self-pilot and install rapidly without having to be punched through the paper cover. When {{finished}} driving, these <b>screws</b> are <b>recessed</b> slightly into the drywall. Screws for light-gauge steel framing have an acute point and finely spaced threads. If the steel framing is heavier than 20-gauge, self-tapping screws with finely spaced threads must be used. In some applications, the drywall may {{be attached to the}} wall with adhesives.|$|R
50|$|Since {{the second}} half of the 19th century, most {{artillery}} fuzes are fitted to the nose of the projectile. The base of the fuze is <b>screwed</b> into a <b>recess,</b> and its nose is designed to conform to the shape of the shell’s ogive. The depth of recess can vary with the type of shell and fuze. Artillery fuzes were sometimes specific to particular types of gun or howitzer due to their characteristics, notable differences in muzzle velocity and hence the sensitivity of safety & arming mechanisms. However, by World War 2, while there were exceptions, most fuzes of one nation could be used with any required artillery shell of that nation, if it could be physically fitted to it, although different army and navy procurement arrangements often prevented this. The exceptions were mortar bomb fuzes, and this continues.|$|R
