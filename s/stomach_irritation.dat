30|$|Heavy metal {{presence}} in the environment has several adverse health effects {{on a variety of}} living organisms. Ingestion of these metals by humans in excessive amount can cause accumulative poisoning, cancer, nervous system damage and ultimately death (Corapcioglu and Huang 1987; Issabeayev et al. 2006). Copper is essential for human life but excess intake can cause anemia, liver damage, kidney damage, <b>stomach</b> and intestinal <b>irritation.</b> The WHO permissible limit of Cu(II) for drinking water is 2  mg L− 1 and that for wastewater and industrial effluents is 3  mg L− 1. Several remediation methods like chemical precipitation, lime coagulation, reverse osmosis, ion exchange and solvent extraction have been developed and used but they either are ineffective or expensive (Ahalya et al. 2003).

40|$|Borneol is a {{traditional}} Chinese medicine that can promote drug absorption from the gastrointestinal tract and distribution to the brain. However, <b>stomach</b> <b>irritation</b> may occur when high doses of borneol are used. In the present work, gastrodin, the main bioactive ingredient of the traditional Chinese drug “Tianma” (Rhizoma Gastrodiae) {{was used as a}} model drug to explore reasonable application of borneol. Sustained-release solid dispersions (SRSDs) for co-loading gastrodin and borneol were prepared using ethylcellulose as a sustained release matrix and hydroxy-propyl methylcellulose as a retarder. The dispersion state of drug within the SRSDs was analyzed by using scanning electron microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, and powder X-ray diffractometry. The results indicated that both gastrodin and borneol were molecularly dispersed in an amorphous form. Assay of in vitro drug release demonstrated that the dissolution profiles of gastrodin and borneol from the SRSDs both fitted the Higuchi model. Subsequently, gastric mucosa irritation and the brain targeting of the SRSDs were evaluated. Compared with the free mixture of gastrodin and borneol, brain targeting of SRSDs was slightly weaker (brain targeting index: 1. 83 vs. 2. 09), but <b>stomach</b> <b>irritation</b> obviously reduced.

30|$|Heavy metal ions are {{released}} into the environment by several industrial processes. The continuous production of metal-containing wastewater poses {{a serious threat to}} the environment and public health. This is mainly due to their entry and bioaccumulation in food chains (Malik 2004; Chuah et al. 2005). Metal ions such as lead, cadmium, mercury, copper, chromium, zinc, nickel, and cobalt are highly toxic to organisms and have a great impact on the environment (Gadd 1993; Volesky and Holan 1995). Copper is the third most used metal in the world and is an essential micronutrient required in the growth of both plants and animals. Copper is indeed essential, but in high doses, it can cause anemia, liver and kidney damage, and <b>stomach</b> and intestinal <b>irritation.</b> Wastewater especially the electrical and electroplating industries contain high levels of Cu 2 + and treatment of such waters to remove Cu 2 + is needed before disposal (Yilmaz et al. 2010). The conventional methods used for the removal of heavy metals are chemical precipitation, lime coagulation, ion exchange, reverse osmosis, and solvent extraction (Rich and Cherry 1987). These methods are less effective and more expensive when metal concentrations are in the range of 1 – 100 [*]mg/l (Nourbakhsh et al. 1994). Biosorption by different fungal biomass as biosorbents is a potentially important mechanism for heavy metal clean-up relative to conventional methods due to its low cost, high efficiency, and the possibility of the regeneration and recovery of the metals (Cruz et al. 2004; Luo et al. 2010; doCarmo et al. 2013; Ghosh and Saha 2013). Living as well as dead fungal biomass has been used as biosorbents in the removal of toxic metal ions (Arıca et al. 2001 and Saad 2015). It should be mentioned that large amount of fungal biomass are available as byproducts of fermentation industries (antibiotics, organic acids, enzyme production, and biopolymer production for pharmaceutical and food industries). Thus, the waste products from other processes could probably be put to use as biological sorbents (Brown et al. 2001).|$|R
40|$|Two {{nationwide}} {{surveys were}} carried out using an electronic poll of 2000 GPs and postal questionnaires were sent to 30 000 patients with osteoarthritis (OA). Both surveys found {{a high level of}} gastrointestinal (GI) side-effects in patients treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Almost every GP (97 %) reported experience of patients suffering GI symptoms while on an NSAID, 38 % reported patients who had been hospitalised and 4 % reported patients who had died owing to NSAID-induced side-effects. Most GPs (92 %) said they were concerned about GI safety when prescribing an NSAID and almost a third (32 %) said they were concerned about litigation from patients who had experienced a bleed. Use of NSAIDs in CA remained high, with 44 % of GPs prescribing conventional NSAIDs to at least three quarters of their patients, 57 % of GPs using simple analgesia and just 12 % using a cyclo-oxygenase- 2 (COX- 2) selective inhibitor in over 74 % of patients. Some 45 % of patients reported receiving NSAIDs compared with 43 % on simple analgesia and 4 % on COX- 2 selective inhibitors. Most GPs (69 %) stated that their main therapeutic objective in using an NSAID to treat OA was to control pain without GI side-effects. Almost a quarter (24 %) said they used low-dose NSAIDs in the hope that this would control pain without GI side-effects. Dissatisfaction with treatment was the most common reason reported by GPs for patients on an NSAID to re-present, with 73 % citing either breakthrough pain or incomplete pain relief as the most common reason for patient dissatisfaction. This mirrored the patients' perception, with 63 % citing inadequate pain relief as their main reason for dissatisfaction with current painkillers compared to 17 % who cited <b>stomach</b> upsets or <b>irritation.</b> Patient and GP appear to be united in their concern at the GI risks of NSAID treatment, In the light of this and recent data on the efficacy, safety profile and cost-effectiveness of COX- 2 selective inhibitors, GPs should re-examine their medical management of OA...|$|R
40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVES: To {{investigate}} whether exposure to tap water contaminated {{in a major}} river pollution incident with 2 ethyl 5, 5 dimethyl 1, 3 dioxane (EDD) and 2 ethyl 4 methyl 1, 3 dioxolane (EMD) was associated with an increase of self reported symptoms. To assess the extent of association between noticing the water had an unusual taste or odour and self reported symptoms. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: A city and two nearby towns in a semi-rural area of England, UK. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 3861 people who replied to a postal questionnaire asking about symptoms and water consumption sent {{to a sample of}} 1000 households in each of three areas [...] one area supplied with contaminated water (study group) and two control areas that were unaffected (control groups). MAIN RESULTS: The household response rates were 65 % for the study group and 56 % and 57 % for the two control groups. Self reporting of 10 individual symptoms was significantly increased in the study group compared with controls. Within the study group, reporting of one or more symptoms was significantly higher in subjects who consumed contaminated water but not among subjects who used it to wash or cook. Subjects who drank contaminated water showed a dose-response relationship for self reporting of one or more symptoms and for seven individual symptoms. Within the study group, however, only 62 % (867 of 1398 subjects) noticed that the water had an unusual taste or odour. Among subjects who did not notice that the water had an unusual taste or odour, no association was found between drinking contaminated water and reporting one or more symptoms, or between drinking contaminated water and reporting of individual symptoms, although a dose-response relationship was shown between the amount of water consumed and self reporting of nausea. Among subjects who noticed the water had an unusual taste or odour, both an association and a dose-response relationship were found between consumption of contaminated water and the self reporting of six symptoms [...] diarrhoea, nausea, headache, <b>stomach</b> pains, skin <b>irritation,</b> and itchy eyes. CONCLUSIONS: Higher rates of symptom reporting were associated with the water contamination incident. Reported symptoms seemed, however, {{to be associated with the}} ability to detect an unusual taste or odour in the water. Because concentrations of the contaminants would be expected to be evenly distributed in the tap water in the affected area, irrespective of taste or odour, and because of the known toxicity of the parent compounds of EMD and EDD, it is concluded that the increase in self reported symptoms in the study group respondents was associated with noticing the unpleasant taste or odour of the tap water and not with the chemical contamination. It is concluded that the observed increase in reporting of nausea with increasing water consumption was due to public anxiety caused by the incident but did not pose a serious risk to the public's health. The increase in self reported symptoms in the area affected by the contamination was an important reminder of the wider health implications of "health scares"...|$|R

30|$|Among heavy metals, Cd 2 + {{has been}} {{recognized}} as one of the most toxic, teratogenic and carcinogenic species (Cui et al. 2008). The major sources of Cd 2 + released into the environment are phosphate fertilizers, waste batteries, electroplating industry, paint pigments, smelting and alloy manufacturing (Garg 2008). Once accumulated in the body, Cd 2 + is stored mainly in the bone, liver, and kidneys causing renal damage, pulmonary insufficiency and negative effects on blood. Infants and children who drink water containing large amounts of Cd 2 + may suffer <b>stomach</b> <b>irritation,</b> vomiting, and diarrhea (Singh et al. 2005). Accordingly, the drinking water guideline value recommended by the World Health Organization and Egyptian standards for Cd 2 + is 0.005  mg/L (Wang et al. 2013). Thus, it is necessary to treat Cd 2 +-contaminated wastewater prior to its discharge to the environment. Removal of Cd 2 + can be achieved by conventional treatment processes such as chemical precipitation, ion exchange, electrochemical removal and reverse osmosis. However, these processes have some disadvantages such as being too expensive, incomplete removal, high-energy requirements, and production of toxic sludge (Sud et al. 2008).|$|E
40|$|Naproxen {{is widely}} used for the {{treatment}} of arthritic pain. It can induce gastrointestinal (GI) side effects ranging from <b>stomach</b> <b>irritation</b> to ulceration and bleeding. These complications are believed to be determined from the combined effect of the blockage of prostaglandin biosynthesis in the GI tract and direct action of free carboxylic groups. Prodrugs approach have been proposed to overcome the Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) side effects by masking the carboxylic acid groups via formation of bioreversible bonds. It has been demonstrated that the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) plays an important pathogenic role in gastrointestinal ulceration. Our goal was to develop a new Naproxen prodrug which integrates the concepts of prodrug and the beneficial antioxidant effect. For this purpose we designed and synthesized naproxen esters containing tocopherols. Among the possible antioxidant compounds we focused our attention on �-tocopherol for its potent antioxidant properties and anti-inflammatory activity. In addition, esterification of phenolic group on chroman ring of tocopherols, to form the prodrug, is expected to increase the stability to oxidation of the vitamin. In the present paper, we report the synthesis and the in vitro enzymatic and non-enzymatic hydrolysis of two prodrug esters of naproxen with �- and �-tocopherols.

40|$|Heavy metals usually {{referred}} {{to those with}} atomic weights ranging from 63. 5 to 200. 6. Because of natural-mineral dissolution and human activities such as mining, pesticides, fertilizer, metal planting and batteries manufacture, etc., these heavy metals, including zinc, copper, mercury, lead, cadmium and chromium have been excessively released into water courses, like underground water, lake and river, etc. The ingestion of the heavy metals-contaminated water would raise serious health problems to human beings even at a low concentration. For instance, lead can bring human beings about barrier to the normal function of kidney, liver and reproductive system, while zinc can cause <b>stomach</b> cramps, skin <b>irritations,</b> vomiting and anemia. Mercury is a horrible neurotoxin that may result in damages to the central nervous system, dysfunction of pulmonary and kidney, chest and dyspnea. Chromium (VI) has been proved can cause many diseases ranging from general skin irritation to severe lung carcinoma. Accordingly, the World Health Organization announced the maximum contaminant levels (MCL) for the heavy metals in drinking water. There are numerous processes for eliminating heavy metals from water {{in order to provide}} citizens safe drinking water, including precipitation, adsorption, ion exchange, membrane separation and biological treatment, etc. Adsorption is considered as a potential process for deeply removing heavy metals, in which the selection of adsorbents plays a predominant role. Nano-sheet minerals as the adsorbents are currently the hottest researches in the field. They are obtained from layered minerals, such as montmorillonite, graphite and molybdenite, through the processing of intercalation, electrochemical and mechanical exfoliation, etc. Nano-sheet minerals are featured by their large specific surface area, relatively low costs and active adsorbing sites, leading to be effective and potential adsorbents for heavy metals removal from water. Montmorillonite was usually pre-interacted with organics to increase the interlayer space, and then exfoliated to single or several layers by using ultrasonic. Among the nano-sheets, the surfaces are strongly charged negatively, while the edges are positively charged. This characteristic allows the adsorption of cations or anions, as well as the substances with negative or positive charges. Graphite can be oxidized and exfoliated into graphene oxide (GO), which has a huge specific surface area and plentiful of functional groups such as carboxyl, epoxy, carbonyl and hydroxyl, leading to high adsorption capacity to heavy metals in water. Nano-sheet molybdenite is a novel two-dimensional material with single or several layers of MoS 2 sheets. The most common method to prepare nano-sheet molybdenite is exfoliated from bulk molybdenite through chemical method based on ion intercalation process. A large quantity of functional groups and S atom on the sheets are the active sites for adsorbing heavy metals in water. Nano-sheet minerals are used as adsorbents in the form of three-dimension hydrogels. They are featured by the huge specific surface area and high adsorption efficiency. In addition, the clean and smooth surfaces allow heavy metals to adsorb directly by film dispersion. Without any barrier of mesopores and micropores, the adsorption rate could be well improved. These characteristics would lead to the extremely large adsorption capacity and high adsorption rate. Currently, nano-sheet minerals as adsorbent is a very hot research topic in the field of heavy metal removal. It is expected that nanosheet minerals will be promising adsorbents in the removal of heavy metals from water...|$|R

The X-ray powder diffraction data suggested the intercalation of VP 16 into layers with the increased basal spacing from 0. 84 – 1. 18 nm was successful. Then, it was characterized by X-ray powder diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetry and differential thermal analysis, and transmission electron microscopy. The prepared nanoparticles, VP 16 -LDH, showed an average diameter of 62. 5 nm with a zeta potential of 20. 5 mV. Evaluation of the buffering effect of VP 16 -LDH indicated that the nanohybrids were ideal for administration of the drugs that treat human <b>stomach</b> <b>irritation.</b> The loading amount of intercalated VP 16 was 21. 94 % and possessed a profile of sustained release. The mechanism of VP 16 -LDH release in the phosphate buffered saline solution at pH 7. 4 is likely controlled by the diffusion of VP 16 anions from inside to the surface of LDH particles. The in vitro cytotoxicity and antitumor assays indicated that VP 16 -LDH hybrids were less toxic to GES- 1 cells while exhibiting better antitumor efficacy on MKN 45 and SGC- 7901 cells. These results imply that VP 16 -LDH is a potential antitumor drug for a broad range of gastric cancer therapeutic applications.

30|$|At higher concentrations, {{heavy metals}} {{have been shown}} to have {{negative}} effects. Lead, which may be an impurity, is a proven neurotoxin linked to learning, language, and behavioral problems (Ayenimo et al. 2010). It has also been linked to miscarriage, reduced fertility in men and women, hormonal changes, menstrual irregularities, and delays in puberty onset in girls. Pregnant women and young children are also vulnerable because lead crosses the placenta and may enter the fetal brain (Horowitz et al. 2002). Cadmium found in body and hair creams are absorbed into the body through dermal contact (Ayenimo et al. 2010) and stored in the kidney and the liver, although it can be found in almost all adult tissues. It is considered to be “carcinogenic to humans” by the IARC (ATSDR 2012) and its compounds, categorized as known human carcinogens by the United States Department of Health and Human Services. Ingestion of high levels of cadmium can lead to severe <b>stomach</b> <b>irritation,</b> vomiting, and diarrhea, while exposure to lower level for a long time can lead to kidney damage, bone deformity, and the ability of bones to break easily (Campaign for Safe Cosmetics 2007). Chromium is also corrosive and causes allergy to the skin. Adverse effects of the chromium on the skin may include ulcerations, dermatitis, and allergic skin reactions. Mercury is linked to nervous system toxicity, as well as reproductive, immune, and respiratory toxicity. It is also found in thiomersal, which is a mercury-based preservative and used as direct ingredients or impurities. But the high toxicity of this metal means that the presence of mercury in any cosmetic is a concern. Other heavy metals show a similar tendency to be toxic (UNEP 2008). A recent assessment by WHO reported that mercury in skin lightening creams and soaps that are commonly used in Asian and Central African nations is potentially dangerous as they have serious side effects and can be fatal (WHO 2011).|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Chemotherapy of cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), {{a devastating}} cancer with {{increasing}} worldwide incidence and mortality rates, is largely ineffective. The discovery {{and development of}} effective chemotherapeutics is urgently needed. Methods/Design The study aimed at evaluating anticancer activities, toxicity, and pharmacological activities of the curcumin compound (CUR), the crude ethanolic extracts of rhizomes of Zingiber officinale Roscoe (Ginger: ZO) and Atractylodes lancea thung. DC (Khod-Kha-Mao: AL), fruits of Piper chaba Hunt. (De-Plee: PC), and Pra-Sa-Prao-Yhai formulation (a mixture of parts of 18 Thai medicinal plants: PPF) were investigated in animal models. Anti-cholangiocarcinoma (anti-CCA) was assessed using CCA-xenograft nude mouse model. The antihypertensive, analgesic, anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, and anti-ulcer activities and effects on motor coordination were investigated using Rota-rod test, CODA tail-cuff system, writhing and hot plate tests, carrageenan-induced paw edema test, brewer's yeast test, and alcohol-induced gastric ulcer test, respectively. Acute and subacute toxicity tests were performed according to the OECD guideline for testing of chemicals with modification. Results Promising anticancer activity against CCA in nude mouse xenograft model was shown for the ethanolic extract of AL at all oral dose levels (1000, 3000, and 5000 mg/kg body weight) {{as well as the}} extracts of ZO, PPF, and CUR compound at the highest dose level (5000, 4000, and 5000 mg/kg body weight, respectively). PC produced no significant anti-CCA activity. Results from acute and subacute toxicity tests both in mice and rats indicate safety profiles of all the test materials in a broad range of dose levels. No significant toxicity except <b>stomach</b> <b>irritation</b> and general CNS depressant signs were observed. Investigation of pharmacological activities of the test materials revealed promising anti-inflammatory (ZO, PPF, and AL), analgesic (CUR and PPF), antipyretic (CUR and AL), antihypertensive (ZO and AL), and anti-ulcer (CUR, ZO, and AL) activities. Conclusion Plants used in Thai traditional medicine for the treatment of various ailments may provide reservoirs of promising candidate chemotherapeutics for the treatment of CCA. </p...|$|E
