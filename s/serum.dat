The range of anti-aging <b>serums</b> first appeared in 2007. The range comprises four clinically proven anti-aging <b>serums</b> designed to target the aging concerns of a specific age group. In May 2014, two new No7 Protect & Perfect ADVANCED <b>Serums</b> were launched for women aged between 35 and 45 years. No7 also has a skincare range for men and a range of cosmetics. No7 is not only sold in Boots stores, but is also internationally available through third party retailers.|$|R

25|$|IGFBP-3 {{levels in}} human <b>serum</b> are, like IGF-1, {{dependent}} on growth hormone (GH); for example, <b>serum</b> IGFBP-3 is increased in acromegaly {{and low in}} GH-deficient children. However, IGFBP-3 gene expression in human liver is GH-independent. Because it is stabilized in human <b>serum</b> by forming complexes with IGF-1 and ALS, which are both GH-dependent, <b>serum</b> IGFBP-3 also appears regulated by GH.

40|$|The {{value of}} {{pregnancy}} <b>serums</b> for HL-A typing is well recognized (1). Most {{of the specific}} antibodies in these <b>serums</b> arise through immunization of the mother by the foreign HL-A antigens of the fetus. These determinants are found on all peripheral blood lymphocytes and are primarily detected in microcytotoxicity assays (1, 2). In addition to the HL-A antigens, the histocompatability complex on the lymphocyte surface also includes the structures determining the mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR). Although these remain undefined, certain pregnancy <b>serums</b> are known to selectively inhibit the MLR (3), and the serologic characterization of these MLR-related structures has been initiated (4). In the mouse an additional series of serologically defined determinants, the la system has been described recently that appears to map with immune response genes (5).

In this study, we investigate whether the two formulas have any effect on germ cell formation and differentiation by culturing rat medicated <b>serums</b> containing YGW or ZGW with stem cells derived from human first trimester umbilical cord. Our results showed that while the normal rat <b>serums</b> had no significant effects, the rat medicated <b>serums</b> had significant effects on the differentiation of the stem cells into oocyte-like cells (OLCs) based on (1) cell morphological changes that resembled purative cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs); (2) expressions of specific markers that were indicative of germ cell formation and oocyte development; and (3) estradiol production by the COC-like cells. Furthermore, ZGW medicated <b>serums</b> exhibited more obvious effects on specific gene expressions of germ cells, whereas YGW medicated <b>serums</b> showed stronger effects on estradiol production.
