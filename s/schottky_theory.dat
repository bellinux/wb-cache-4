50|$|The first {{theory that}} {{predicted}} the correct direction of rectification of the metal-semiconductor junction {{was given by}} Nevill Mott in 1939. He found the solution for both the diffusion and drift currents of the majority carriers through the semiconductor surface space charge layer which has been known since about 1948 as the Mott barrier. Walter H. Schottky and Spenke extended Mott's theory by including a donor ion whose density is spatially constant through the semiconductor surface layer. This changed the constant electric field assumed by Mott to a linearly decaying electric field. This semiconductor space-charge layer under the metal {{is known as the}} Schottky barrier. A similar theory was also proposed by Davydov in 1939. Although it gives the correct direction of rectification, it has also been proven that the Mott theory and its Schottky-Davydov extension gives the wrong current limiting mechanism and wrong current-voltage formulae in silicon metal/semiconductor diode rectifiers. The correct theory was developed by Hans Bethe and reported by him in a M.I.T. Radiation Laboratory Report dated November 23, 1942. In Bethe's theory, the current is limited by thermionic emission of electrons over the metal-semiconductor potential barrier. Thus, the appropriate name for the metal-semiconductor diode should be the Bethe diode, instead of the Schottky diode, since the <b>Schottky</b> <b>theory</b> does not predict the modern metal-semiconductor diode characteristics correctly.|$|E
40|$|Because the {{conductivity}} {{of organic}} semiconductors is very low, a useful {{model for the}} organic diode consists of treating the organic layer as an insulator, an approximation {{often referred to as}} the metal-insulator-metal (MIM) model. Moreover, the dominant charge carrier injection process is diffusion, so that a modified <b>Schottky</b> <b>theory</b> can be used to derive a simple analytical equation for the current voltage curve of the diode. Here, we carried out a full analysis of the MIM model for the organic diode. We show that <b>Schottky</b> <b>theory</b> is only valid when charge injection is poor, that is, for high injection barriers. When the injection barrier is lowered, the current given by <b>Schottky</b> <b>theory</b> is still valid in the weak injection regime, when the applied potential is lower than the diffusion potential.

When two layers are in contact with each other, the Fermi levels align in equilibrium by the transfer of electrons from Ag to SiO 2 and TiO 2.

Many different research groups and companies have achieved high open-circuit voltages above 730 mV, but fill factors (FFs) {{at the level of}} conventional silicon solar cells are rare.

With Low-power Schottky (LS), internal resistance values were increased to reduce power consumption and increase switching speed over the original version.

30|$|In {{the case}} of platinum-coated tip, on the other hand, the {{resistance}} of the tip Rtip may be neglected, and thus, the tip may be used to quantify the electrical properties of the composite if the tip-sample contact resistance Rtip-CNT is also negligible. Unfortunately, the metal-CNT contact is a complex problem which cannot be explained with the <b>Schottky</b> <b>theory</b> but instead involves the pinning of the Fermi level and the adhesion between the metal and the CNT[30]. Platinum exhibits a quite high contact resistance with the CNT in comparison to palladium. This has been attributed to the de-wetting property of platinum on the CNT, while the palladium wets the CNT well and leads to a lower contact resistance[31]. Under these assumptions, the electrical transport is controlled by a tunneling mechanism, and the contact should not be considered as ohmic. However, local I V curves performed with platinum tip exhibit both non-ohmic and ohmic behaviors. The ohmic I V curve corresponds to an ohmic contact probably due to a good mechanical contact with metallic shells, and the non-ohmic corresponds to a formation of Schottky or tunneling barrier with semimetallic shells of MWCNT (see the description above). However, in the two situations, the contact resistance is dependent on the tip-sample contact size Rtip-CNT[*]=[*]f (a). The global electrical resistance (R = V / I) measured by C-AFM can be written as follows: R[*]=[*]Rtip-CNT[*]+[*]Rcomp[*]=[*]f(a)[*]+[*]Rcomp, where a is the tip-sample contact radius, and Rcomp is the composite resistance.|$|E
40|$|Among various 2 D materials, {{monolayer}} transition-metal dichalcogenide (mTMD) semiconductors with intrinsic band gaps (1 – 2  eV) {{are considered}} promising candidates for channel materials in next-generation transistors. Low-resistance metal contacts to mTMDs are crucial because currently they limit mTMD device performances. Hence, a comprehensive {{understanding of the}} atomistic nature of metal contacts to these 2 D crystals is a fundamental challenge, which is not adequately addressed at present. In this paper, we report a systematic study of metal-mTMD contacts with different geometries (top contacts and edge contacts) by ab initio density-functional theory calculations, integrated with Mulliken population analysis and a semiempirical van der Waals dispersion potential model (which is critical for 2 D materials and not well treated before). Particularly, In, Ti, Au, and Pd, contacts to monolayer MoS_{ 2 } and WSe_{ 2 } as well as Mo-MoS_{ 2 } and W-WSe_{ 2 } contacts are evaluated and categorized, based on their tunnel barriers, Schottky barriers, and orbital overlaps. Moreover, going beyond <b>Schottky</b> <b>theory,</b> new physics in such contact interfaces is revealed, such as the metallization of mTMDs and abnormal Fermi level pinning. Among the top contacts to MoS_{ 2 }, Ti and Mo show great potential to form favorable top contacts, which are both n-type contacts, while for top contacts to WSe_{ 2 }, W or Pd exhibits the most advantages as an n- or p-type contact, respectively. Moreover, we find that edge contacts can be highly advantageous compared to top contacts in terms of electron injection efficiency.

However, the traditional <b>Schottky</b> barrier <b>theories</b> developed for the metal and planar semiconductor contacts are different from the contacts between metal and CNT owing to the unique properties originated from CNT's nano-scale size. Therefore how to optimize the performance of the 1 D Schottky photodiodes is still a mystery. The properties of the 1 D Schottky diodes are determined by the energy alignment between metals and CNT. In order to improve our understating of its working principle, we not only used different metals to explore the role of metal work function, but also investigated the performances of the photodetectors by varying the Fermi levels of the CNT through electrostatic doping utilizing the gate from CNT field effect transistor (CNTFET). It was observed that a low work function metal electrode (Cu) based photodetector can render a higher on/off ratio than its high work function contender (Au) by suppressing the dark current with a higher barrier. It was also demonstrated photocurrent was maximized by selecting high built-in potential and moderate doping using the CNTFET.

40|$|The {{knowledge}} of the solid-state properties of passive film is a preliminary task for {{a full understanding of}} the electron and ion transfer processes at the metal/oxide and oxide/electrolyte interface. Both processes are of paramount importance in determining the mechanism of film growth and dissolution as well as in determining the nature of the breakdown during the growth of anodic oxide films or the onset of generalized or localized corrosion process (1 - 2). With very few exceptions, it is a common belief, that most of anodic oxide films, grown on metals and alloys in aqueous solutions, display a semiconducting or insulating behaviour. It is also very well known that in many cases the initial air-formed or electrochemically grown films have a highly defective or amorphous structure. In any case the location of the characteristic energy levels of the metal/passive-film/electrolyte junction is a necessary task to reach {{a deeper understanding of the}} mechanism of charge transfer at the metal/oxide/electrolyte interface so that it is not surprising that in-situ electrochemical techniques like electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and differential admittance (DA) have been routinely employed to get information both on the electrical properties as well as on the mechanism of growth of thin and thick oxide films. In order to account for the amorphous or scarcely crystalline nature of anodic oxide films we have suggested, in several papers (3 - 5), an approach to the description of physicochemical properties of semiconducting passive films based on the theory of amorphous semiconductors. We have stressed in previous papers that the characterization of semiconducting passive film/electrolyte junction based on the use of simple M-S theory to get information on the solid state properties of anodic films presents some drawbacks in terms of assumptions as well as for a correct location of the characteristics energy levels of the passive film/electrolyte junction: flat band potential, Ufb, and the nearest characteristic level of the semiconductor EC (n-type SC) or EV (p-type SC).

Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 118 - 122) Microfiche. xv, 122 leaves, bound ill. 29 cmThis PhD dissertation {{is concerned}} with an experimental study of solid surfaces and interfaces. The electronic structure of magnesium hydride, chemisorption of oxygen or hydrogen on the Kg surface, and photoeffect of the Pd/SiOx/Si interface were investigated using the techniques of ultraviolet photoemission (UPS), x-ray photoemission (XPS), and interfacial photoemission (photoemission into solution). The core level binding energies, the valence bandwidth and the volume plasmon energy of KgH 2 were determined from the x-ray photoelectron spectra. The observed plasmon energy {{was found to be}} useful in calculating the average energy gap and the static dielectric constant of MgH 2, which is new information on MgH 2. Measurements of uv photoemission from the Mg surface were made at photon energies a few eV above the photoelectric threshold before and after exposure to oxygen or hydrogen. The oxygen induced vacant-state features in the photoelectron spectra appear to be in good agreement with the calculated resonant state energy levels, suggesting that both singly anionic Oˉ complex and doubly charged O^ 2 - complex exist at the initial stage of oxidation of the Kg surface. This is a new technique for observing the initial stage of chemisorption on Mg. The uv photoelectron spectra and spectral photoelectric yield also provided evidence of coadsorption of hydrogen and oxygen as magnesium hydride-hydroxide. From the XPS study of the Pd/SiOx/Si interface under the visible light bias, we developed a novel method of making non-destructive testing of the open-circuit photovoltage at the interface. The core level spectra of Pd 3 d 5 / 2 was observed to shift to higher (lower) binding energy for the n-type (p-type) Si substrate under illumination, in agreement with the <b>Schottky</b> photovoltaic <b>theory.</b> This shift was found {{to be sensitive to the}} presence of oxygen or hydrogen which can change the Schottky barrier height. This technique appears to be a promising method of investigating the effect of metal microclusters on the semiconductor surface electronic properties. The effect of hydrogen on the photoresponse of the Pd/SiOx/Si photoelectrode was also investigated using the solid/electrolyte interfacial photoemission technique. Hydrogen was used to exploit the fact that exposure to hydrogen can lower the work function of Pd. The results obtained at low light intensity (6. 4 microwatts/cm 2) agree with the metal/semiconductor interface model. However, at high light intensity (34 milliwatts/cm^ 2), our results of p-type Si/SiOx/Pd support the metal/solution interface model. The dependence of the photocurrent change on light intensity suggests that the magnitude of the surface recombination rate constant is important in locating the rate-determining step in the photoelectrochemical system. The results help resolve the controversy over the proposed models...|$|R
