5|$|Several {{studies have}} shown that {{hypopituitarism}} is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and some also an increased risk of death of about 50% to 150% the normal population. It has been difficult to establish which hormone deficiency is responsible for this risk, as almost all patients studied had growth hormone deficiency. The <b>studies</b> <b>also</b> do not answer the question as to whether the hypopituitarism itself causes the increased mortality, or whether some of the risk is to be attributed to the treatments, some of which (such as sex hormone supplementation) have a recognized adverse effect on cardiovascular risk.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the program}} started in 1982, only three formal studies over the {{nutritional}} {{impact of the}} benefits provided to each family have been publicly released, in 1985, 1993, and 1996, respectively. All studies were designed to analyze {{the impact of the}} program with respect to the previous food stamps program, focusing on changes in household nutrient availability, while the 1985 and 1993 <b>studies</b> <b>also</b> focused on changes in household food expenditures (the amount of money households spent on acquiring food).|$|E

The <b>study</b> <b>also</b> {{revealed that}} 82% of the young people not in the labour force actually want to be placed in long-term employment.

5|$|Undergraduate {{students}} are expected to fulfill most of the core requirements prior to the completion of their sophomore year; a wide variety of courses can be applied to this endeavor. Upon the completion of the Core Curriculum, students choose from approximately 50 major courses of study, in which they will receive their degree. One option is the personalized interdisciplinary major, which allows students to create their own course of study across various disciplines. School of Professional and Continuing <b>Studies</b> <b>also</b> awards bachelor's degrees; the Gabelli School of Business offers both undergraduate and graduate degrees.|$|E
5|$|Another {{difference}} between older and newer studies {{is that the}} type of patients treated with the ketogenic diet has changed over time. When first developed and used, the ketogenic diet was not a treatment of last resort; in contrast, the children in modern studies have already tried and failed a number of anticonvulsant drugs, so may be assumed to have more difficult-to-treat epilepsy. Early and modern <b>studies</b> <b>also</b> differ because the treatment protocol has changed. In older protocols, the diet was initiated with a prolonged fast, designed to lose 5–10% body weight, and heavily restricted the calorie intake. Concerns over child health and growth led to a relaxation of the diet's restrictions. Fluid restriction was once a feature of the diet, but this led to increased risk of constipation and kidney stones, and is no longer considered beneficial.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s and 1970s however Dessau's {{original}} arguments received powerful restatement {{and expansion}} from Sir Ronald Syme, who devoted three books {{to the subject}} and was prepared to date {{the writing of the}} work closely in the region of AD 395. Other recent <b>studies</b> <b>also</b> show much consistency of style, and most scholars now accept the theory of a single author of unknown identity, writing after 395. Although it was believed that the History Augusta did not reference any material from Ammianus Marcellinus' history, which was finished before 391 and which covered the same period, this has now been shown not to be the case, and that the Historia Augusta does in fact make reference to Ammianus' history.|$|E

5|$|Master's and {{doctoral}} programs are offered through the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, the Law Center, the School of Medicine, the McCourt School of Public Policy, and the School of Continuing Studies. Masters students occasionally share some advanced seminars with undergraduates, and most undergraduate schools offer abbreviated bachelors and masters programs following {{completion of the}} undergraduate degree. The McDonough School of Business and the Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service both offer masters programs. The School of Foreign Service is renowned for its academic programs in international affairs. Its graduate program was ranked first {{in the world by}} Foreign Policy and its undergraduate program was ranked fourth. The Center for Contemporary Arab <b>Studies</b> <b>also</b> offer a Master's of Arab Studies, as well as certificates.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{challenges}} in assessing progress {{in this area is}} the number of clinical studies that either do not report the gender of the subjects or lack the statistical power to detect gender differences. These were still issues in 2014, and further {{compounded by the fact that}} the majority of animal <b>studies</b> <b>also</b> exclude females or fail to account for differences in sex and gender. for instance despite the higher incidence of depression amongst women, less than half of the animal studies use female animals. Consequently, a number of funding agencies and scientific journals are asking researchers to explicitly address issus of sex and gender in their research.|$|E
5|$|The best-studied medical {{treatment}} for intracranial hypertension is acetazolamide (Diamox), which acts by inhibiting the enzyme carbonic anhydrase, and it reduces CSF production by six to 57 percent. It {{can cause the}} symptoms of hypokalemia (low blood potassium levels), which include muscle weakness and tingling in the fingers. Acetazolamide cannot be used in pregnancy, since {{it has been shown}} to cause embryonic abnormalities in animal <b>studies.</b> <b>Also,</b> in human beings it has been shown to cause metabolic acidosis as well as disruptions in the blood electrolyte levels of newborn babies. The diuretic furosemide is sometimes used for a treatment if acetazolamide is not tolerated, but this drug sometimes has little effect on the ICP.|$|E

40|$|This study aims to {{describe}} the relationship of personality disorders to the repetition of parasuicide whilst taking cognizance of recent developments in the classification of and assessment for personality disorders. This <b>study</b> <b>also</b> aims to determine whether risk factors described by other authors for further suicidal behavior are characteristic of these patients locally. This <b>study</b> <b>also</b> aims {{to describe}} the contribution of newly described personality dimensions to repetition of parasuicide. This <b>study</b> <b>also</b> describes suicidal behavior in the follow-up period of a cohort of parasuicide patients who were seen in the emergency psychiatric service during follow-up. This <b>study</b> <b>also</b> examines the comorbidity between the personality disorders categories defined by the clinical criteria of the Tenth International Classification of Mental and Behavioral Disorders or ICD- 10, (World Health organization, 1992). This study compares the co-occurence of these new personality disorder categories with the comorbidity which has been observed in older classification systems (American Psychiatric Association; 1980, 1987) {{in order to determine}} whether this new classification system has led to less comorbidity among the personality disorders. This <b>study</b> <b>also</b> examines aspects of the relationship between informant based diagnoses of personality disorder and personality dimensions described by Cloninger et al (1994) ...|$|R
5|$|This gender {{discrepancy}} {{is often}} distorted in specific populations where rates of self-harm are inordinately high, {{which may have}} implications on the significance and interpretation of psychosocial factors other than gender. A study in 2003 found an extremely high prevalence of self-harm among 428 homeless and runaway youths (aged 1619) with 72% of males and 66% of females reporting a history of self-harm. However, in 2008, a study of young people and self-harm saw the gender gap close, with 32% of young females, and 22% of young males admitting to self-harm. <b>Studies</b> <b>also</b> indicate that males who self-harm may also be at {{a greater risk of}} completing suicide.|$|E
5|$|Redback {{antivenom}} {{was developed}} by Commonwealth Serum Laboratories, then a government body involved with discovering antivenoms for many venomous Australian creatures. Production involves the milking of venom from redbacks and repeatedly inoculating horses with non-lethal doses. The horse immune systems makes polyclonal antibodies. Blood plasma, containing the antibodies, is extracted by plasmapheresis. The plasma is treated with pepsin, and the active F(ab')2 fragments are separated and purified. Each vial contains 500 units of redback antivenom in approximately 1.5 ml, which is enough to inactivate 5mg of redback spider venom in a test tube. The antivenom has been safely administered to women {{in various stages of}} pregnancy. Redback antivenom has been widely used in Australia since 1956, although evidence from controlled studies for its effectiveness has been lacking. Recent trials show antivenom has a low response rate little better than placebo, and any effect is less than might be achieved with optimal use of standard analgesics. Further studies are needed to confirm or refute its effectiveness. It appears clinically active against arachnidism caused by Steatoda spiders; however, as these cases are often mild and the evidence of its effectiveness is limited, this treatment is not recommended. Similarly, the antivenom has been reported as effective with bites of L. katipo, and L. tredecimguttatus. Animal <b>studies</b> <b>also</b> support its use against envenomation from other widow spiders, having successfully been tested against venom from L. mactans, L. hesperus, and L. tredecimguttatus (synonym L.lugubris).|$|E

In 2005, Anton Plaza opened in Hyde Park while the Ventura Center for Menu Research and Development opened in St. Helena. The school's third campus opened in 2008 in San Antonio. Two years later, the CIA opened a campus in Singapore consisting of a facility {{on the campus of}} Temasek Polytechnic. In 2012, the CIA began offering a bachelor's degree program in culinary science, and in 2014 introduced a bachelor's degree in applied food <b>studies.</b> <b>Also,</b> in 2012 the college was inducted into the Culinary Hall of Fame. In 2015, the college expanded its recreation center and added a new dining facility for students, called The Egg; both are housed in the CIA's Student Commons building. In the same year, the college acquired a portion of Copia, a museum in downtown Napa, California that operated from 2001 to 2008. In 2016, the college opened a campus, the Culinary Institute of America at Copia, which houses the CIA's new Food Business School. The college, which was outgrowing its St. Helena campus, purchased the northern portion of the Copia property for $12.5 million. In September 2018, the CIA is launching a Bachelor of Science degree program in Hospitality Management.|$|E
