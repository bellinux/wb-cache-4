In one study by Wells, individuals were exposed to misleading information after witnessing an event; they were then tested on their ability to remember details from this event. Their findings included: when given misinformation that contradicts the witnessed event they were less able to recall those details; and whether misinformation was given before or after the witnessed event did not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>matter.</b> Furthermore, visual memory can be subjected to various memory errors which will affect accuracy.|$|E
25|$|The {{tourists}} {{began the}} second Test with their confidence shaken. Hutton {{opted for a}} more balanced bowling attack; to include the spinners Bob Appleyard and Johnny Wardle, he left out Alec Bedser, England's most reliable bowler since the war, doubting that he was fit enough to play. Australia were also weakened by injuries for this Test, but his did not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>matter</b> when Hutton lost the toss, had to bat first and England collapsed to 154 in their first innings. Hutton batted over two hours for 30 in this innings and scored 28 in the second. However, in a low scoring match, Tyson {{proved to be the}} crucial factor and he bowled England to a 38 run win. After a break for Christmas, Hutton was unwell {{at the start of the}} third match in the series, suffering from fibrositis and a heavy cold. After deciding to play at the last minute, he again left out Bedser from the side, although he was fit to play. This was an unexpected decision. Hutton did not inform Bedser that he would not play before the match, and the bowler only learned of his fate when he saw the team list displayed in the dressing room before the match. Hutton scored 12 and 42, with the latter innings particularly valuable at a difficult time in the match. However, Peter May and Colin Cowdrey made large scores and Tyson took seven wickets as Australia were bowled out for 111 in their second innings, giving England a 128 run victory in a match where no innings total reached 300.|$|E

2500|$|In 2004, with Bianca's rape {{having left}} her {{subsequently}} pregnant with Michael's child, {{and the baby}} switch storyline having robbed her of her daughter, viewers were infuriated by what they felt was the pain the character had endured within the year. They additionally found the Bianca and Babe friendship unappealing, specifically due to Babe knowingly keeping Bianca from her own child. Within the story, Babe is initially unaware that her child has been switched with Bianca's and that Bianca's child, the one she is caring for, is still alive and not dead {{as she had been}} led to believe. However, once convinced by Krystal to keep Bianca's child as her own in order to save JR from heartbreak, she does as advised. Due to her guilt, she goes as far as to name Bianca godmother of the child. Angered by these events, viewers campaigned for Bianca to discover the truth. The amount of mail sent to the ABC studios requesting and demanding that Bianca's baby be returned to her was cited as astounding for a fictional character, especially one of daytime [...] and who is also gay: [...] "Bianca's sexuality did not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>matter</b> to the thousands of fans who wrote letters, e-mail messages, and blog entries insisting that the only safe place for the baby was back in the arms of Pine Valley's one known lesbian." ...|$|E

2500|$|With {{the rise}} of the Nazis in Germany and the Austrofascism in Austria, many of the Vienna Circle's members left for America and the United Kingdom. Schlick, however, stayed on at the University of Vienna. When visited by Herbert Feigl in 1935, he {{expressed}} dismay at events in Germany. On June 22, 1936, Schlick was ascending the steps of the University for a class when he was confronted by a former student, Johann Nelböck, who killed Schlick with a pistol. The court declared Nelböck to be fully compos mentis, he confessed to the act, was detained without any resistance, but was unrepentant. The delinquent used the judicial proceedings as a chance to present himself and his ideology in the public. He claimed that Schlick's anti-metaphysical philosophy had [...] "interfered with his moral restraint". In another version of the events, the murderer covered up all political causes and claimed that he was motivated by jealousy over his failed attachment to the female student Sylvia Borowicka, leading to a paranoid delusion about Schlick as his rival and persecutor. Nelböck was tried and sentenced, but the event became a distorted cause célèbre around which crystallized the growing nationalist and anti-Jewish sentiments in the city. (The fact that Schlick was not Jewish did not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>matter</b> to propagandists capitalizing on the crime.) After the annexation of Austria into Nazi Germany in 1938 the assassin was released on license after serving two years of a 10-year sentence.|$|E

This gives a false sense of reliability to what is a ranking system without any real validity." [...] Sweet Briar College president, Elizabeth S. Muhlenfeld stated that, [...] "one of our colleagues likened it to trying to rank composers. It's a great analogy. How can you say that Beethoven and Brahms are better than Mahler or Mozart?" [...] Trinity Washington University president Patricia McGuire argued that, [...] "the survey asks me to 'rate the academic quality of undergraduate programs,' assigning each school a single score using a 1-to-5 scale from 'marginal' to 'distinguished.'

[...] Finally, DePauw University president, Robert G. Bottoms, argued that, [...] "I, in fact, did not fill out the reputational survey for this past year. [...] I came to the conclusion that I am not in a position to make judgments on other schools, many of which I have little or no familiarity with. The fact that one quarter of a college's ranking is based upon what is, in essence, its popularity, is very disturbing and we choose not to be a part of the process." ...|$|E
