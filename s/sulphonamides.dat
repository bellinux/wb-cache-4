2500|$|The popular {{story of}} Winston Churchill's father paying for Fleming's {{education}} after Fleming's father saved young Winston from death is false. According to the biography, Penicillin Man: Alexander Fleming and the Antibiotic Revolution by Kevin Brown, Alexander Fleming, {{in a letter}} to his friend and colleague Andre Gratia, described this as [...] "A wondrous fable." [...] Nor did he save Winston Churchill himself during World War II. Churchill was saved by Lord Moran, using <b>sulphonamides,</b> since he had no experience with penicillin, when Churchill fell ill in Carthage in Tunisia in 1943. The Daily Telegraph and The Morning Post on 21 December 1943 wrote that he had been saved by penicillin. He was saved by the new sulphonamide drug Sulphapyridine, known at the time under the research code M 693, discovered and produced by May & Baker Ltd, Dagenham, Essex – a subsidiary of the French group Rhône-Poulenc. In a subsequent radio broadcast, Churchill referred to the new drug as [...] "This admirable M". It is highly probable that the correct information about the sulphonamide did not reach the newspapers because, since the original sulphonamide antibacterial, Prontosil, had been a discovery by the German laboratory Bayer, and as Britain was at war with Germany at the time, it was thought better to raise British morale by associating Churchill's cure with a British discovery, penicillin.|$|E

40|$|Gower Street, London, W. C. I, England An {{in vitro}} {{study of the}} {{activity}} of cotrimoxazole against <b>sulphonamide</b> resistant urinary Escherichia coli has been undertaken, using chequer board titration. The results indicate that there is synergy between the <b>sulphonamide</b> and the trimetho-prim. The degree of synergy shown suggests that cotrimoxazole treatment would give better results than treatment with trimethoprim alone in urinary tract infection caused by <b>sulphonamide</b> resistant E. coli. Similar studies undertaken with urinary E. coli resistant both to <b>sulphonamide</b> and to trimethoprim gave two different results. When the trimethoprim resistance was not caused by an R factor, some synergy was demonstrated but its degree was such as to suggest only marginal clinical usefulness in treating such infection with co-trimoxazole. When the resistances were due {{to the presence of}} an R factor, no synergy was demonstrated.

40|$|Objectives: Despite a 97 % {{reduction}} in clinical <b>sulphonamide</b> usage, {{the prevalence of}} <b>sulphonamide</b> resistance among Escherichia coli has remained constant in the UK. Genetic linkage of <b>sulphonamide</b> resistance to other resistances is thought important for this maintenance, but the finding also implies that <b>sulphonamide</b> resistance exerts little fitness cost. To test this hypothesis, we examined the fitness impact of four naturally occurring sul 2 -coding plasmids upon their hosts. Methods: The fitness impact of the plasmids upon E. coli was determined by pairwise growth competition in a minimal medium. The DNA sequence of plasmid p 9123 was obtained by primer walking and PCR. Results: Three of the four sul 2 -coding plasmids studied imposed fitness costs on their hosts. The fourth plasmid, a 6. 2 kb resistance element carrying sul 2, strA and strB designated p 9123, conferred a 4 % fitness advantage upon its original clinical host and also on E. coli K 12 JM 109. The complete sequence of p 9123 revealed eight open reading frames, including five of unknown function. There was no obvious gene to which the fitness advantage might be attributed. Conclusions: The novel finding that p 9123 can improve host fitness may explain why this plasmid and its close relatives are so widespread among enteric bacteria. In addition to other factors such as co-selection of <b>sulphonamide</b> resistance by other agents, the fitness advantage conferred by plasmids such as p 9123 {{may have contributed to}} the maintenance of <b>sulphonamide</b> resistance in the UK in the absence of clinical selection pressure.

40|$|A large {{proportion}} of disease caused by <b>sulphonamide</b> resistant strains of group B type 15 meningococci affects patients 10 - 24 years. In contrast, disease caused by <b>sulphonamide</b> sensitive strains conforms to the usual pattern, and most infection occurs in early childhood. In an attempt to explain this phenomenon possible differences in susceptibility of resistant and sensitive strains to phagocytosis by polymorphonuclear leucocytes were investigated, using radioactively labelled bacteria. In initial experiments a group B resistant strain required higher concentrations of normal human serum and longer opsonisation times for phagocytosis than an ungroupable non-pathogenic meningococcus. Comparison of <b>sulphonamide</b> resistant and sensitive group B meningococci showed that with either heat inactivated serum or agammaglobulinaemic serum, phagocytosis did not occur {{with any of the}} strains, whereas if these two sera were used together, phagocytosis was restored to the level seen with normal human serum. Thus both antibody and complement are required for phagocytosis. Furthermore, opsonisation depended on an intact classical pathway of complement for each group B strain.

40|$|Objectives: We {{investigated}} whether <b>sulphonamide</b> {{resistance in}} Escherichia coli remained prevalent in 2004, 9 {{years since the}} formal introduction of a UK prescribing restriction on co-trimoxazole. Resistance to other agents no longer in common use was also examined. Methods: Consecutive urinary E. coli isolates were obtained at the diagnostic microbiology laboratory of the Royal London Hospital from January to March 2004. The presence of the <b>sulphonamide</b> resistance genes, sul 1, sul 2 and sul 3, and the class I integrase gene, int 1, were determined by PCR. Results: Of the 391 E. coli isolates recovered in 2004, 45. 5 % were sulphonamide-resistant compared with 46. 0 % in 1999 and 39. 7 % in 1991. The sul 2 gene remained the most prevalent <b>sulphonamide</b> resistance determinant, present in 81 % of resistant isolates in 2004 compared with 79 % and 67 % in 1999 and 1991, respectively; 28 % of resistant isolates carried both sul 1 and sul 2 genes; sul 3 was not found. Resistance to streptomycin also remained common, whereas resistance to chloramphenicol and kanamycin had decreased since 1999.
