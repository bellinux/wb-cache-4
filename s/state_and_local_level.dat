5|$|Kennedy {{returned}} to the Senate in January 1965, walking with a cane. He employed a stronger and more effective legislative staff. He took on President Lyndon B. Johnson and almost succeeded in amending the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to explicitly ban the poll tax at the <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>local</b> <b>level</b> (rather than just directing the Attorney General to challenge its constitutionality there), thereby gaining a reputation for legislative skill. He was a leader in pushing through the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, which ended a quota system based upon national origin and which, despite Kennedy's predictions, would {{have a profound effect}} on the demographic makeup of the United States. He played a role in creation of the National Teachers Corps.|$|E
5|$|White middle-class Indiana women learned {{organizational}} skills through the suffrage and temperance movements. By the 1890s they were applying their new {{skills to the}} needs of their home communities, by organizing women's clubs, the combined literary activity with social activism focused on such needs as public health, sanitation, and good schools. Hoosier women worked at both the <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>local</b> <b>level</b> to materialize Progressive Era reforms. In Lafayette, for example, the suffragists concentrated in the Lafayette Franchise League, while those oriented toward social concerns worked through the Lafayette Charity Organization Society (LCOS), the Free Kindergarten and Industrial School Association (FKISA), and the Martha Home. Albion Fellows Bacon led statewide and national efforts at housing reform. A native of Evansville, Bacon worked to pass tenement and housing legislation in Indiana in 1909, 1913, and 1917. She also held leadership roles in Indiana Child Welfare Association; the Child Welfare Committee, a part of the Women's Section of the Indiana State Council of Defense; the Indiana Conference of Charities and Corrections, and the Juvenile Advisory Commission of Indiana's Probation Department. Women in Indiana would officially gain the right to vote in 1920 when the 19th Amendment is ratified for the United States constitution.|$|E

25|$|However, Westchester is less Democratic {{in state}} and local elections. For instance, it voted for Republican George Pataki, by a margin of 23.07% against Democratic candidate, Carl McCall in the gubernatorial race of 2002, and by 26.22% in 1998. Pataki hails from Westchester, where he {{previously}} served as mayor of Peekskill prior to being elected governor. The county currently has a Republican county executive and a majority coalition of Republicans and conservative Democrats in the Board of Legislators. Republicans still remain competitive at the <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>local</b> <b>level.</b>|$|E
25|$|Major {{demographic}} changes ensued in the 20th century; {{during the two}} waves of the Great Migration, {{a total of six}} million African Americans left the South for opportunities in the North, Midwest and West Coast. In some areas, white migration increased into the South, especially since the late 20th century. Beginning with the Goldwater–Johnson election of 1964, a significant contingent of white conservative voters in the Deep South stopped supporting national Democratic Party candidates and switched to Republicans. They still voted for many Democrats at the <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>local</b> <b>level</b> into the 1990s.|$|E

25|$|The Republicans {{welcomed the}} Progressive Era at the <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>local</b> <b>level.</b> The first {{important}} reform mayor was Hazen S. Pingree of Detroit (1890–1897), {{who was elected}} governor of Michigan in 1896. In New York City, the Republicans joined nonpartisan reformers to battle Tammany Hall and elected Seth Low (1902–1903). Golden Rule Jones was first elected mayor of Toledo as a Republican in 1897, but was reelected as an independent when his party refused to renominate him. Many Republican civic leaders, following the example of Mark Hanna, were active in the National Civic Federation, which promoted urban reforms and sought to avoid wasteful strikes.|$|E

In January 2012, the ACLU {{filed a lawsuit against}} Snyder and the state of Michigan in federal court on behalf of five Michigan same-sex couples, each with one spouse working for local public schools or municipalities in Michigan. The suit alleges that the law violates the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution. On June 28, 2013, a federal judge struck down the law.|$|E

This field was an Angus bull farm prior to being donated to the town for school construction. During the soccer fields improvement program, tests were conducted at the soccer complex which showed elevated levels of unspecified contaminants. The Mayor closed the fields {{as soon as the}} test results came in. The township then applied for and received a grant to help with the remediation work. Marlboro received money from the Hazardous Discharge Site Remediation Fund to conduct soil remediation at the soccer fields.|$|E

NGO representatives reported that the country's conviction rate was only between 1 and 2 percent, citing a general indifference and ineffectiveness of the justice system. A poll conducted by Grupo Reforma and published in a Mexico City daily in August found that 68 percent of respondents had no or little trust in the judiciary.|$|E
25|$|Well {{into the}} 20th century, {{the party had}} {{conservative}} pro-business and Southern conservative-populist anti-business wings. The New Deal Coalition of 1932–1964 attracted strong support from voters of recent European extraction—many of whom were Catholics based in the cities. After Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal of the 1930s, the pro-business wing withered outside the South. After the racial turmoil of the 1960s, most Southern whites and many Northern Catholics moved into the Republican Party at the presidential level. The once-powerful labor union element became smaller and less supportive after the 1970s. White Evangelicals and Southerners became heavily Republican at the <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>local</b> <b>level</b> in the 1990s. Racial and ethnic minorities in the U.S., such as Jewish Americans, Hispanic Americans, Arabic Americans and African Americans, tend to support the Democratic Party much more than they support the rival Republican Party, giving the Democratic Party its current membership lead over the Republicans.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the popular}} {{perception}} that conservatism {{is limited to}} Republicans, during the era of segregation before 1965 many Southern Democrats were also conservative, especially about social and racial issues. Southern Democrats were {{a key part of}} a Conservative Coalition that largely blocked liberal labor legislation in Congress from 1937 to 1963, though they tended to be liberal and vote {{with the rest of the}} Democratic Party on other economic issues. Southern Democrats fended off the more conservative Republican Party (GOP) by arguing that only they could defend segregation because the Republican Party nationally was committed to integration. That argument collapsed when Congress banned segregation in 1964. This provided an opportunity for Republicans to appeal to conservative Southerners on the basis that the GOP was the more conservative party on a wide range of social and economic issues, as well as being hawkish on foreign policy when the antiwar forces gained strength in the Democratic party. Southern white conservatives moved from the Democratic Party to the GOP at the presidential level in the 1960s, and at the <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>local</b> <b>level</b> after 1990.|$|E

500|$|Until recently, {{the full}} panoply of {{potential}} federal resources {{had not been}} brought to bear effectively on corruption schemes at the <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>local</b> <b>level.</b> These schemes {{are at least as}} corrosive of the governmental process as corruption at the federal level. From the time of Tammany Hall this country has been painfully aware of the existence of corrupt practices in many of our metropolitan areas, and of the [...] "machines" [...] and [...] "rings" [...] which siphon off millions of dollars from public treasuries for private gain. Most state and local prosecutors, beset by inadequate resources and the overwhelming demands of a rising rate of street crime, are simply unable to deal with this type of corruption. Moreover, in some cases, local law enforcement {{is part and parcel of}} the problem itself, due to the outright corruption of its own establishment.|$|E

50|$|Unlike in some {{parliamentary}} systems, Americans {{vote for}} a specific candidate instead of directly selecting a particular political party.
