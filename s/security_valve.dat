5000|$|At {{the heart}} of the system, acting as {{pressure}} sink as well as suspension elements, are the so-called spheres, five or six in all; one per wheel and one main accumulator as well as a dedicated brake accumulator on some models. On later cars fitted with Hydractive or Activa suspension, there may be as many as ten spheres. Spheres consist of a hollow metal ball, open to the bottom, with a flexible desmopan rubber membrane, fixed at the 'equator' inside, separating top and bottom. The top is filled with nitrogen at high pressure, up to 75 bar, the bottom connects to the car's hydraulic fluid circuit. The high pressure pump, powered by the engine, pressurizes the hydraulic fluid (LHM) and an accumulator sphere maintains a reserve of hydraulic power. This part of the circuit is at between 150 and 180 bars. It powers the front brakes first, prioritised via a <b>security</b> <b>valve,</b> and depending on type of vehicle, can power the steering, clutch, gear selector, etc.|$|E
40|$|The {{mitochondrial}} alternative oxidase is {{an important}} enzyme that allows respiratory activity and {{the functioning of the}} Krebs cycle upon disturbance of the respiration chain. It works as a <b>security</b> <b>valve</b> in transferring excessive electrons to oxygen, thereby preventing potential damage by the generation of harmful radicals. A clear biological function, besides the stress response, has so far convincingly only been shown for plants that use the alternative oxidase to generate heat to distribute volatiles. In fungi it was described that the alternative oxidase is needed for pathogenicity. Here, we investigate expression and function of the alternative oxidase at different stages of the life cycle of the corn pathogen Ustilago maydis (Aox 1). Interestingly, expression of Aox 1 is specifically induced during the stationary phase suggesting a role at high cell density when nutrients become limiting. Studying deletion strains as well as overexpressing strains revealed that Aox 1 is dispensable for normal growth, for cell morphology, for response to temperature stress as well as for filamentous growth and plant pathogenicity. However, during conditions eliciting respiratory stress yeast-like growth as well as hyphal growth is strongly affected. We conclude that Aox 1 is dispensable for the normal biology of the fungus but specifically needed to cope with respiratory stress...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} decades, various studies have {{reported}} the occurrence of emissions of nitrous oxide (N 2 O) from aquatic ecosystems characterised by {{a high level of}} algal activity (e. g. eutrophic lakes) as well as from algal cultures representative of the processes used by the algae biotechnology industry. As N 2 O is a potent greenhouse gas (GHG) and ozone depleting pollutant, these findings suggest that large scale microalgae cultivation (and possibly, eutrophic ecosystems) could contribute to the global N 2 O budget. Considering the current rapid development of microalgal biotechnologies and the ubiquity of microalgae in the environment, this PhD research was undertaken to determine the biochemical pathway of microalgal N 2 O synthesis and evaluate the potential significance of microalgal N 2 O emissions with regard to climate change. To determine the pathway of N 2 O synthesis in microalgae, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and its associated mutants were incubated in short-term (24 h) laboratory in vitro batch assays. For the first time, axenic C. reinhardtii cultures (i. e. culture free of other microorganisms such as bacteria) fed nitrite (NO 2 ⁻) were shown to synthesise N 2 O under aerobic conditions. The results evidenced that N 2 O synthesis involves 1) NO 2 ⁻ reduction into nitric oxide (NO), followed by 2) NO reduction into N 2 O by nitric oxide reductase (NOR). With regard to the first step, the results show that NO 2 ⁻ reduction into NO could be catalysed by the dual system nitrate reductase-amidoxime reducing component (NR-ARC) and the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase (COX). Based on our experimental evidence and published literature, we hypothesise that N 2 O is synthesised via NR-ARC-mediated NO 2 ⁻ reduction under physiological conditions (i. e. low/moderate intracellular NO 2 ⁻) but that under NO 2 ⁻ stress (i. e. induced by high intracellular NO 2 ⁻), N 2 O synthesis involves both NR-ARC-mediated and COXmediated NO 2 ⁻ reductions. RNA sequencing analysis on C. reinhardtii samples confirmed that the genes encoding ARC, COX and NOR were expressed in NO 2 ⁻-laden culture, although NO 2 ⁻ addition did not trigger significant transcriptomic regulation of these genes. We therefore hypothesise that the microalgal N 2 O pathway may be involved in NO regulation in microalgae where NOR acts as a <b>security</b> <b>valve</b> to get rid of excess NO (or NO 2 ⁻). To evaluate N 2 O emissions during microalgal cultivation, N 2 O emissions were quantified during the long term outdoor cultivation of commercially relevant microalgae species (Chlorella vulgaris, Neochloris sp. and Arthrospira platensis) in 50 L pilot scale tubular photobioreactors (92 days) and during secondary wastewater treatment in a 1000 L high rate algal pond (365 days). Highly variable N 2 O emissions were recorded from both systems (0. 0 – 38 μmol N 2 O·m- 2 ·h- 1, n = 510 from the 50 L photobioreactors; 0. 008 – 28 μmol N 2 O·m- 2 ·h- 1, n = 50 from the high rate algal pond). Based on these data, we estimated that the large scale cultivation of microalgae for biofuel production in order to, for example, replace 30 % of USA transport fuel with algal-derived biofuel (i. e. a commonly used sustainability target), could generate N 2 O emissions representing up to 10 % of the currently budgeted global anthropogenic N 2 O emissions. In contrast, N 2 O emissions from the microalgae-based pond systems commonly used for wastewater treatment would represent less than 2 % of the currently budgeted global N 2 O emissions from wastewater treatment. As emission factors to predict N 2 O emissions during microalgae cultivation and microalgae-based wastewater treatment are currently lacking in Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change methodologies, we estimated these values to 0. 1 – 0. 4 % (0. 02 ̶ 0. 11 g N-N 2 O·m- 3 ·d- 1) of the N load on synthetic media (NO 3 ⁻) during commercial cultivation and 0. 04 – 0. 45 % (0. 002 ̶ 0. 02 g N-N 2 O·m- 3 ·d- 1) of the N load during wastewater treatment. The accuracy of the emission factors estimated is still uncertain due to the variability in the N 2 O emissions recorded and by consequence further research is needed. Nevertheless, further monitoring showed that the use of ammonium as N source and/or the cultivation of microalgae species lacking the ability to generate N 2 O (e. g. A. platensis) could provide simple mitigation solutions...|$|E

40|$|The Sandia National Laboratories (SNL) Safeguards and Seals Evaluation Program is {{evaluating}} new {{fiber optic}} active seal technologies for use at Department of Energy (DOE) facilities. The {{goal of the}} program is to investigate active seal technologies that can monitor secured containers storing special nuclear materials (SNM) within DOE vaults. Specifically investigated were active seal technologies that can be used as tamper-indicating devices to monitor secured containers within vaults while personnel remain outside the vault area. Such a system would allow minimal access into vaults while ensuring container content accountability. The purpose of this report is to discuss tamper-indicating devices that were evaluated for possible DOE use. While previous seal evaluations (Phase I and II) considered overall facility applications, this discussion focuses specifically on their use in vault storage situations. The report will highlight general background information, specifications and requirements, and test procedures. Also discussed are the systems available from four manufacturers: Interactive Technologies, Inc., Fiber SenSys, Inc., Inovonics, Inc., and <b>Valve</b> <b>Security</b> Systems...|$|R
