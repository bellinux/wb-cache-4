5|$|Almost all jumping spiders are predators, mostly {{preying on}} insects, on other spiders, {{and on other}} arthropods. The most common {{procedure}} is sighting the prey, stalking, fastening a silk <b>safety</b> <b>line</b> to the surface, using the two pairs of back legs {{to jump on the}} victim, and finally biting the prey. Most jumping spiders walk throughout the day, so that they maximize their chances of a catch.|$|E
5|$|If {{a spider}} walks under a P. schultzi female's capture web and the {{vertical}} distance {{is less than}} 8centimetres, the P. schultzi often drops onto the prey too fast for a human eye to follow. If the P. schultzi misses, it quickly returns up its <b>safety</b> <b>line</b> to its vantage point and looks for another chance - and seldom misses the second time. Most drops cover two to four centimetres, as longer drops are often obstructed by the web.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} to self-contained breathing systems is to supply breathing gases {{from the surface}} through a hose. When combined with a communication cable, a pneumofathometer hose and a <b>safety</b> <b>line</b> {{it is called the}} diver's umbilical, which may include a hot water hose for heating, video cable and breathing gas reclaim line. More basic equipment that uses only an air hose is called an airline or hookah system. This allows the diver to breathe using an air supply hose from a cylinder or compressor at the surface. Breathing gas is supplied through a mouth-held demand valve or light full-face mask. It is used for work such as hull cleaning and archaeological surveys, for shellfish harvesting, and as snuba, a shallow water activity typically practised by tourists and those who are not scuba-certified.|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to using their silk for <b>safety</b> <b>lines</b> while jumping, they also build silken [...] "pup tents", where they shelter from bad weather and sleep at night. They molt within these shelters, build and store egg cases within them, and also spend {{the winter in}} them.|$|R
5|$|Production {{moved to}} Turkey in March 2012, with filming {{reported}} to be continuing until 6 May. Production was expected to take three months in the country. Adana stands in for the outskirts of Istanbul in the film. A group of Turkish teenagers infiltrated a closed set in a railway sidings in Adana to film rehearsals of a fight scene {{on top of a}} train before being caught by security. The train scene depicted in trailers showed the Varda Viaduct outside Adana. Bond stunt double Andy Lister dived backwards off the 300-foot drop for the scene. A crane was set up on a train carriage to hold a <b>safety</b> <b>line.</b> Parts of Istanbul—including the Spice Bazaar, Yeni Camii, the Grand Post Office, Sultanahmet Square and the Grand Bazaar—were closed for filming in April. Store owners in the affected areas were reportedly allowed to open their shops, but were not allowed to conduct business, instead being paid TRY750 ($418) per day as compensation. Production faced criticism for allegedly damaging buildings while filming a motorcycle chase across rooftops in the city. Michael G. Wilson denied these claims, pointing out that the film crew had removed sections of rooftops before filming began and replaced them with replicas {{for the duration of the}} shoot; when filming finished, the original rooftops would be restored. The production team negotiated with 613 part owners of the Calis Beach in Fethiye, to film along the coastline.|$|E

25|$|Spiders produce silk {{from their}} {{spinneret}} glands {{located at the}} tip of their abdomen. Each gland produces a thread for a special purpose – for example a trailed <b>safety</b> <b>line,</b> sticky silk for trapping prey or fine silk for wrapping it. Spiders use different gland types to produce different silks, and some spiders are capable of producing up to eight different silks during their lifetime.|$|E
5|$|The {{defensive}} backfield, {{often called}} the secondary, consists of cornerbacks (CB) and safeties (S). Safeties are themselves divided into free safeties (FS) and strong <b>safeties</b> (SS). Cornerbacks <b>line</b> up outside the defensive formation, typically opposite of a receiver {{so as to be}} able to cover him, while <b>safeties</b> <b>line</b> up between the cornerbacks but farther back in the secondary. Safeties are the last line of defense, and are responsible for stopping deep passing plays as well as running plays.|$|R

25|$|Breathing gases may be {{supplied}} {{from the surface}} through a diver's umbilical, or airline hose, which provides breathing gas, communications and a <b>safety</b> <b>line,</b> with options for a hot water hose for heating, a video cable and gas reclaim line. The diver's breathing gas supply is significantly more secure than for scuba; communications are simplified and the divers position is either known or can be traced reliably by following the umbilical. Several major risks are thereby mitigated, but the system also has serious disadvantages in some applications, as diver mobility is constrained by {{the length of the}} umbilical, and it may snag on obstructions.|$|E
500|$|The men who removed {{this rock}} were called [...] "high scalers". While {{suspended}} {{from the top of}} the canyon with ropes, the high-scalers climbed down the canyon walls and removed the loose rock with jackhammers and dynamite. Falling objects were the most common cause of death on the dam site; the high scalers' work thus helped ensure worker safety. One high scaler was able to save life in a more direct manner: when a government inspector lost his grip on a <b>safety</b> <b>line</b> and began tumbling down a slope towards almost certain death, a high scaler was able to intercept him and pull him into the air. The construction site had, even then, become a magnet for tourists; the high scalers were prime attractions and showed off for the watchers. The high scalers received considerable media attention, with one worker dubbed the [...] "Human Pendulum" [...] for swinging co-workers (and, at other times, cases of dynamite) across the canyon. To protect themselves against falling objects, some high scalers took cloth hats and dipped them in tar, allowing them to harden. When workers wearing such headgear were struck hard enough to inflict broken jaws, they sustained no skull damage, Six Companies ordered thousands of what initially were called [...] "hard boiled hats" [...] (later [...] "hard hats") and strongly encouraged their use.|$|E

2500|$|Phase 1 of the complex, called One Liberty Place, broke {{ground on}} May 13, 1985. One Liberty Place {{would be the}} tallest {{structure}} of the complex. The skyscraper became the tallest structure in Philadelphia on September 10, 1986 when the first [...] long steel columns of the skyscraper's 44th floor were installed. One Liberty Place was topped off on December 12 with a ceremony that included a laser light show and Mayor Goode who said the tower [...] "breaks the status quo {{of the city and}} says we arrived". On March 27, 1987 Robert Heenan, Jr., a 22-year-old glazier, fell 42 stories to his death after his <b>safety</b> <b>line</b> snapped when it got caught in a hoist mechanism. A month later, on May 27, the tower's spire was placed {{at the top of the}} building. Placing the spire was delayed when it was discovered sections of the spire didn't align with each other and had to be re-welded. Conrail became the first major tenant to lease space when it signed its lease in December 1985, but by April 1987 only twenty percent of the building was leased. Conrail became the first tenant to move in when the building officially opened on August 17.|$|E
2500|$|When {{the crew}} cannot {{get away with}} using a sound stage they have to scout actual {{locations}} that reflect a similar look to {{what needs to be}} filmed; sometimes those on-location shots create problems for the crew. Pitt Meadows, in the Fraser Valley east of Vancouver, subbed for the Indonesian landscape the crew needed for the sequence of Whitney Fordman's ultimate demise during battle [...] "Visage". This location presented its own problems for the crew, as the swampy waters of the river slowed production as well as the limited daylight available—in November, there is only six hours of daylight in the Pitt Meadow's region. The crew had to return eight days before the scheduled airdate for the episode in order to shoot close-ups of Whitney {{and the rest of the}} soldiers. The location that was scouted for the river scene, where Emily Dinsmore pushes Lana off a bridge and into a river, became problematic on the first day of shooting. The river had become too dangerous to shoot the water scenes, so they simply tied Kreuk to a <b>safety</b> <b>line</b> and had Jodelle Micah Ferland (Emily) push her over the edge, but without her actually going into the water. They moved the set to a sound stage where they filmed Kreuk's remaining scenes—where Tom Welling dives into the river to save her—in a water tank.|$|E
60|$|But Mexico Sam {{was playing}} his vendetta along safe lines. He was a bird of {{different}} feather from the plover.

His horse wheeled to the right, and as his victims rounded to the safe side of their equine breast-work he sent a ball through the district attorney's hat. Once he miscalculated in making a détour, and over-stepped his margin. Littlefield's gun flashed, and Mexico Sam ducked {{his head to the}} harmless patter of the shot. A few of them stung his horse, which pranced promptly back to the <b>safety</b> <b>line.</b>|$|E

5000|$|During {{the eight}} or nine seconds between Webber {{crossing}} the <b>safety</b> car <b>line,</b> with the green restart lights illuminated, and Webber finishing the race, Schumacher overtook Alonso in the final corner for sixth place to finish 5.7 seconds behind the winner. The rule 40.7 states that after the safety car {{has returned to the}} pitlane, drivers may only overtake once they have passed the white <b>safety</b> car <b>line</b> spanning the width of the circuit; in Monaco, this line is at the exit to Rascasse. Replays showing Schumacher's manoeuvre were shown shortly after the race and controversy started with Ferrari claiming that overtaking on the last lap was not permitted, according to rule 40.13, which states: [...] "If the race ends whilst the safety car is deployed it will enter the pit lane {{at the end of the}} last lap and the cars will take the chequered flag as normal without overtaking." [...] Mercedes principal Ross Brawn produced documents to show that the restart had taken place (thus the 40.13 rule was not applicable in his opinion) and Schumacher's position beyond the <b>safety</b> car <b>line</b> before the overtaking.|$|R
