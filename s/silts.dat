5|$|Some {{reaches of}} Keyser Creek {{experience}} total flow loss {{and there is}} no regular flow in the watershed's lower reaches. There are also extensive piles of culm and <b>silts</b> piled up in the creek's floodplain, left over from the coal mining era. There is at least one sanitary sewer overflow in the watershed. As of 2013, there are an estimated four stormwater detention facilities in the watershed. The creek has no perennial flow, since it loses flow to mine pools during dry weather. For this reason, it is unlikely to attain its designated uses. However, it still has flow during storms. During storm flows, the creek carries large amounts of sediment containing coal waste. Additionally, there are some discharges of rusty water into the creek, in addition to a combined sewer overflow.|$|E
5|$|During the Cambrian period, Gondwana had a mild climate. West Antarctica was {{partially}} in the Northern Hemisphere, and {{during this period}} large amounts of sandstones, limestones and shales were deposited. East Antarctica was at the equator, where sea floor invertebrates and trilobites flourished in the tropical seas. By {{the start of the}} Devonian period (416Ma), Gondwana was in more southern latitudes and the climate was cooler, though fossils of land plants are known from this time. Sand and <b>silts</b> were laid down in what is now the Ellsworth, Horlick and Pensacola Mountains. Glaciation began {{at the end of the}} Devonian period (360Ma), as Gondwana became centred on the South Pole and the climate cooled, though flora remained. During the Permian period, the land became dominated by seed plants such as Glossopteris, a pteridosperm which grew in swamps. Over time these swamps became deposits of coal in the Transantarctic Mountains. Towards the end of the Permian period, continued warming led to a dry, hot climate over much of Gondwana.|$|E

30|$|The {{generation}} of coarse <b>silt</b> with sand and mud clasts {{may have been}} explained by brecciation of slightly less dense but cohesive silt and sand and mixing of the brecciated clasts (sand and mud clasts) with less cohesive <b>silt</b> (<b>silt</b> slurry) created by seismic tremor. The rounded sand and mud clasts and the stretched sand and <b>silt</b> within the coarse <b>silt</b> portion imply that they were moved and sheared within <b>silt</b> slurry; fluidization occurred below the fine <b>silt.</b>|$|R

40|$|Erosion and {{sediment}} controls on construction sites minimize environmental impacts from sediment-laden stormwater runoff. <b>Silt</b> fence, a widely specified perimeter control practice on construction projects used to retain sediment on-site, has limited performance-based testing data. <b>Silt</b> fence failures and resultant sediment losses {{are often the}} result of structural failure. To better understand <b>silt</b> fence performance, researchers at the Auburn University-Erosion and Sediment Control Testing Facility (AU-ESCTF) have evaluated three <b>silt</b> fence options to determine possible shortcomings using standardized full-scale testing methods. These methods subject <b>silt</b> fence practices to simulated, in-field conditions typically experienced on-site without the variability of field testing or the limited application of small-scale testing. Three different <b>silt</b> fence practices were tested to evaluate performance, which included: (1) Alabama Department of Transportation (ALDOT) Trenched <b>Silt</b> Fence, (2) ALDOT Sliced <b>Silt</b> Fence, and (3) Alabama Soil and Water Conservation Committee (AL-SWCC) Trenched <b>Silt</b> Fence. This study indicates that the structural performance of a <b>silt</b> fence perimeter control {{is the most important}} performance factor in retaining sediment. The sediment retention performance of these <b>silt</b> fence practices was 82. 7 %, 66. 9 % and 90. 5 %, respectively.

40|$|The physico-chemical {{properties}} and water regimes of loamy sand amended by adding <b>silt</b> loam were investigated under wheat (Triticum aestium L.) cultivation in field condition for two consecutive years.

The amendment (adding <b>silt</b> loam), by increasing organic matter and porosity; and altering the pore size distribution, improved soil structure that significantly (p = 0. 05) reduced hydraulic conductivity and elevated field capacity of loamy sand with a consequent increase in its water retention. The first small dose of <b>silt</b> loam (25 %) significantly elevated soil-water availability, the rate of which, however, decreased with further increase in amendment. The improved soil structure in the amended treatments (T 2 & T 4) significantly augmented irrigation efficiency by reducing irrigation requirement of wheat.

30|$|The {{characteristics}} of this deformed bed (ca. 0.6  m thick) {{are similar to}} those described above except for the absence of strongly stretched sand and <b>silt</b> lens. This interval hosts two massive coarse <b>silt</b> parts and an interbedded massive sand part (Fig.  8 a). Both of the coarse <b>silt</b> parts have an indistinct basal boundary (Fig.  8 a). Numerous small rounded mud clasts are scattered in {{the upper part of the}} massive sand and in the overlying upper coarse <b>silt</b> (Fig.  8 b). The rounded sand clasts, which seem to have been originated from the underlying sand are contained in the upper coarse <b>silt</b> (Fig.  8 b). The boundary of the massive sand and the upper coarse <b>silt</b> shows flame-like shape in some part (Fig.  8 b), revealing both the parts were under the liquefied state when this boundary deformation occurred. The mud clasts in the massive sand are, therefore, interpreted to have been originated from the overlying massive coarse <b>silt.</b> The top of the upper coarse <b>silt</b> is then overlain by the fine <b>silt</b> and its boundary is undulated.

40|$|Abstract — Turbine is {{the most}} {{important}} part of hydro power plant which converts the potential energy of water into mechanical energy. The presence of <b>silt</b> in water erodes the turbine material. Erosion of turbine decreases the performance of turbine, life of the turbine as well as loss of power generation. This paper presents a new approach for the study of <b>silt</b> erosion of hydro turbine. In this study, weight of eroded material of turbine have been determined by employing criterion of plastic strain which include parameters (<b>silt</b> size, <b>silt</b> hardness, concentration of <b>silt,</b> flow velocity, hardness of turbine material) affecting <b>silt</b> erosion of turbine. Results have been verified with experimental work for Pelton turbine having 16 buckets made up of brass material. It is seen that the results of analytical study matches with the experimental work.

30|$|Nonplastic <b>silt</b> is {{a common}} {{alluvial}} deposit in the flood plain of Bangladesh. It is finer than sand and behaves like sand but different from elastic <b>silt</b> and clay.

On the other hand, nonplastic <b>silt</b> content in sand–silt mixtures controls {{the behavior of the}} soil under monotonic and cyclic loading. Many researches are found in literature on the effect of nonplastic <b>silt</b> content in sand–silt mixtures. But, their findings are sometimes contradicts each other. Therefore, it is necessary to study the topic more. Moreover, design engineers are not aware of the behavior of nonplastic silt-sand mixtures.|$|R

40|$|Renewed {{interest}} in land management practices, like conservation tillage techniques on agricultural lands and timber harvesting, prescribed fires and wildfires on forested lands has made it desirable to measure hillslope soil erosion. Measuring soil erosion is generally costly and time consuming requiring expensive equipment, many site visits and laboratory analyses. The objective {{of the study was}} to determine the suitability of <b>silt</b> fences for measuring onsite hillslope erosion. <b>Silt</b> fences are low-cost and easy to install. They commonly are used as an erosion control device for construction projects and therefore generally available. For this study a <b>silt</b> fence was installed at the base of an existing long-term hillslope erosion plot at the Agricultural Research Service-Palouse Conservation Field Station, Pullman, WA. Two seasons of erosion data were collected. The <b>silt</b> fence was installed by making a concave cavity facing upslope such that runoff could not go around the <b>silt</b> fence. Also, the <b>silt</b> fence was folded to form a pocket to collect the sediment and eliminate the possibility of undermining the <b>silt</b> fence. <b>Silt</b> fences were installed across the width of the plot.
