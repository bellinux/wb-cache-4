The group led by him is credited with the discovery of a novel subset of IgD receptors on 'naive' B lymphocytes which helped in a wider understanding of antigen-specific B cell selection and amplification. Later, furthering his earlier researches, he worked on designing new synthetic peptide vaccines for Hepatitis B which were reported to generate high immunogenicity in humans. He is also known to have contributed in the pathogenesis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and in the diagnostics of HIV/AIDS. It was during his period with Virander Singh Chauhan and Ranjan Kumar Nanda at ICGEB, the group developed an electronic nose, a urine test, to monitor the progress of tuberculosis therapy. His current assignments are on the <b>study</b> <b>of</b> <b>plasticity</b> controlling mechanisms in receptor-initiated signaling pathways based on the systems level analysis of the antigen receptor-dependent signal transduction network.

Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), however, has become a suitable, noninvasive, and painless technique that can be applied to detect changes in cortical excitability as an indicator of neurological changes.

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} with Dynamic Discrete Dislocation Plasticity (D 3 P), a planar method of discrete dis- location dynamics {{aimed at the}} study of plastic relaxation processes in crystalline materials subjected to weak shock loading and high strain rates. Traditionally, the <b>study</b> <b>of</b> <b>plasticity</b> under these condi- tions was based on experimental measurement of the macroscopic response of the material. Using these data, well-known macroscopic constitutive laws and equations of state have been formulated. However, direct simulation of dislocations as the dynamic agents of plasticity in those circumstances remains a challenge. In discrete dislocation dynamics (DDD) methods, in particular planar discrete dislocation plasticity (DDP), dislocations are modelled as discrete discontinuities in an elastic contin- uum. Current DDP and DDD methods are unable to adequately simulate plastic relaxation because they treat dislocation motion quasistatically, neglecting the time-dependent nature of the elastic fields and assuming that they instantaneously acquire the shape and magnitude predicted by elastostatics. This thesis proves that under shock loading, this assumption leads to models that invariably break causality. This thesis posits that these limitations can only be overcome with a fully time-dependent formulation of the elastic fields of dislocations. A truly dynamic formulation for the creation, annihi- lation, and nonuniform motion of straight edge dislocations is derived, extending the DDP framework to a fully elastodynamic formulation, D 3 P. This thesis describes the changes in paradigm that D 3 P poses, including retardation effects in dislocation interactions {{and the effect of}} the dislocation past history. The thesis then builds an account of all the methodological aspects of D 3 P that have to be modified from DDP, including mobility laws, generation rules, etc. Finally, the thesis explores the ap- plications D 3 P has to the <b>study</b> <b>of</b> <b>plasticity</b> under shock loading. It is found that, D 3 P elastodynamic formulation is able to explain the attenuation of the dynamic yield stress in a shock as a cumulative interference of elastic waves. Open Acces...|$|E

40|$|Plastic {{deformation}} of micron-sized specimens or smaller cannot be described by continuum plasticity, as the discrete {{nature of the}} dislocations {{can no longer be}} ignored. This paper presents a three-dimensional dislocation dynamics plasticity method developed for the <b>study</b> <b>of</b> <b>plasticity</b> of such small specimens. The approach includes two components: (i) plasticity is described by the dynamics of individual, discretized three-dimensional dislocation loops; (ii) a finite element model supplies ‘image fields’ that incorporate traction or displacement boundary conditions on the specimen. A circular dislocation loop is used to validate the chosen discretization of the dislocation. The critical stress for activating a Frank–Read source confirms the used line-tension description. A tensile test of a free-standing thin film illustrates the incorporation of the boundary conditions into the model. Particular attention is given to the treatment of dislocation loops that have glided partly out of the body, leaving a step at the surface. ...|$|E

40|$|Until recently, the <b>study</b> <b>of</b> <b>plasticity</b> {{of neural}} {{circuits}} focused {{almost exclusively on}} potentiation and depression at excitatory synapses on principal cells.

It is now evident that inhibition is highly plastic, with multiple underlying cellular mechanisms. This Review considers these recent developments, focusing mainly on functional and structural changes in GABAergic inhibition of principal cells and long-term plasticity of glutamateric recruitment of inhibitory interneurons in the mammalian forebrain.

40|$|Claims of {{beneficial}} {{side effects}} of music training are made for many different abilities, including verbal and visuospatial abilities, executive functions, working memory, IQ, and speech perception in particular.

Music training in childhood is also associated with cognitive, personality, and demographic variables, and it is well established that IQ and personality are determined largely by genetics.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with two theoretically and empirically important issues in longitudinal research: (1) identifying correlates and predictors of change and (2) discerning patterns of change. Two traditional methods of change measurement-the residualized observed difference and the residualized gain score-are discussed. A general structural equation model for measuring residualized true change and studying patterns of true growth or decline is described. This approach allows consistent and efficient estimation {{of the degree of}} interrelationship between residualized change in a repeatedly assessed psychological construct and other variables, such as studied/presumed correlates and predictors of growth or decline on the latent dimension. Substantively interesting patterns of change on the trait level, such as regression to the mean, overcrossing, and fan-spreading, can be discerned. The model is useful in research situations in which it is of theoretical and empirical concern to identify those variables that correlate with, or can be used to predict, such patterns of true growth or decline that deviate from a group-specific trend in longitudinally-measured psychological constructs. The approach is illustrated using data from a cognitive intervention <b>study</b> <b>of</b> <b>plasticity</b> in fluid intelligence of aged adults (Baltes, Dittmann-Kohli, & Kliegl, 1986).

40|$|It is {{well known}} that amplitude-dependent {{internal}} friction (ADIF) in crystals is created by the interaction between dislocations and point defects (PD). There is a number of theories of dislocation ADIF and numerous experimental tests of them. This review is devoted to works where base theories in this field were probed by means of experiments performed in Ioffe Physical- Technical Institute. A wide scope of investigation of ADIF in Ioffe Institute enables to pass in the review the main directions of developing in this field of Mechanical Spectroscopy. That approach gives rather full consideration of mechanisms and facilities of internal friction (IF) to study the plasticity of crystals.

Thesis (Doctorate in Bioethics) – Centro Universitário São Camilo, São Paulo, 2012. If Ethics is not {{a static}} science, it is because ethos — its basic object <b>of</b> <b>study</b> — is a mutable reality. For this reason, ethical themes, chiefly those of Bioethics, are {{directly}} related to the <b>study</b> <b>of</b> the <b>plasticity</b> <b>of</b> the ethos. Nevertheless, such investigation requires that the researcher distance himself from concrete ethical questions, to apply himself to the theoretical examination of what enables the existence and development of such questions — that is, the aforementioned plasticity. However, bibliographical literature on this subject has revealed a scarcity of works focused specifically on the theme. This scarcity seems to indicate that the subject is still in a process of methodological definition. Therefore, we propose as a research question, to investigate at the theoretical level, if Thomistic Psychology can be considered a valid study tool for the <b>plasticity</b> <b>of</b> ethos. For this aim, we adopt a documental and bibliographical research methodology adapted to the aforesaid question, based on the presupposition that such validity can be gauged to the extent that Thomistic Psychology offers objective contributions to the <b>study</b> <b>of</b> the <b>plasticity</b> <b>of</b> the ethos. Backed by extensive literature, we present an overview of Thomistic Psychology, as well as of ethos and its plasticity.

Voltage-dependent calcium currents and biophysical properties of N-methyl-D-aspartate channels {{were examined in}} acutely isolated granule cells and revealed significant differences between control and epileptic (kindled) neurons. In the slice preparation, the input resistance of granule cells recorded in the whole-cell mode was about 5 - 6 times larger than that obtained with sharp microelectrode recordings. The membrane time constant was longer while the electrotonic length was significantly shorter than previously estimated. Whole-cell recordings in granule cells of hippocampal slices also established {{the presence of a}} powerful depolarizing-shunting gamma-aminobutyric acid-A (GABAA) receptor-mediated inhibition which appears to control the NMDA component of synaptic transmission through the perforant path. Furthermore, spontaneous miniature synaptic excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic currents, occurring with relatively high frequency, could be observed in granule cells. The present findings demonstrate that granule cells of the dentate gyrus have electrophysiological and synaptic properties in many ways different from those previously reported.

40|$|The fitness {{costs of}} {{reproduction}} by clonal growth can include a limited {{ability to adapt}} to environmental and temporal heterogeneity. Paradoxically, some facultatively clonal species are not only able to survive, but colonize, thrive and expand in heterogeneous environments. This is likely due to the capacity for acclimation (sensu stricto) that compensates for the fitness costs and complements the ecological advantages of clonality. Introduced Phragmites australis demonstrates great phenotypic plasticity in response to temperature, nutrient availability, geographic gradient, water depths, habitat fertility, atmospheric CO 2, interspecific competition and intraspecific competition for light. However, no in situ comparative subspecies studies have explored the difference in plasticity between the non-invasive native lineage and the highly invasive introduced lineage. Clonality of the native and introduced lineages {{makes it possible to}} control for genetic variation, making P. australis a unique system for the comparative <b>study</b> <b>of</b> <b>plasticity.</b> Using previously identified clonal genotypes, we investigated differences in their phenotypic plasticity through measurements of the lengths and densities of stomata on both the abaxial (lower) and adaxial (upper) surfaces of leaves, and synthesized these measurements to estimate impacts on maximum stomatal conductance to water (gwmax). Results demonstrated that at three marsh sites, invasive lineages have consistently greater gwmax than their native congeners, as a result of greater stomatal densities and smaller stomata. Our analysis also suggests that phenotypic plasticity, determined as within-genotype variation in gwmax, of the invasive lineage is similar to, or exceeds, that shown by the native lineage...|$|E
