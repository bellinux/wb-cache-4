40|$|Abstract—We {{demonstrate}} a two-stage optical limiting erbium-doped fiber amplifier (OLA) using an interstage <b>synchronized</b> etalon <b>filter</b> and an isolator. The proposed OLA shows higher gain, lower noise figure, and wider dynamic range (> 30 dB) than conventional two-stage erbium-doped fiber amplifiers (EDFA’s) with an interstage isolator. In addition, this OLA {{is well suited}} for the use in wavelength-division multiplexed (WDM) networks since the <b>synchronized</b> etalon <b>filter</b> has multiple passbands at the standardized WDM wavelengths.

30|$|In practice, as PU and SU will {{generally}} not be <b>synchronized,</b> <b>filtering</b> is then {{a good choice}} for OOBE suppression because of its low complexity and robustness to TO. However, filtering alone is usually not adequate to produce sufficient OOBE suppression because the filter length of F-OFDM is limited by the CP length. In order to satisfy the OOBE suppression requirement and to minimize the sensitivity with respect to TO, the combination of filtering with precoding would be necessary if the CP length is not long enough to allow a sufficient long filtering function. Thus, we conclude from this example that the combination of filtering with precoding would be {{the most efficient way to}} suppress OOBE of OFDM signal but at the cost of a small spectral efficiency loss and a significant complexity increase. This can be seen in Fig.  8 where, among all results shown, the hybrid approach F(18)-PMix(6)-OFDM for the SU has the best OOBE suppression performance when TO[*]=[*] 200.|$|R
50|$|The {{technique}} {{requires a}} source of neutrons. Neutrons are usually produced in a nuclear reactor or spallation source. At a research reactor, other components are needed, including a crystal monochromators as well as filters to select the desired neutron wavelength. Some parts of the setup may also be movable. At a spallation source, the time of flight technique is used to sort the energies of the incident neutrons (higher energy neutrons are faster), so no monochromator is needed, but rather a series of aperture elements <b>synchronized</b> to <b>filter</b> neutron pulses with the desired wavelength.|$|R
30|$|If {{the guide}} star is bright and stable enough, i.e. if {{the size of}} light {{emitting}} particle is big enough and still not disturbing the physiology of the sample, some in vivo applications can be performed as well. For this purpose, the guide star image and image of the scene in its close vicinity can be captured continuously with the camera with short exposure times in tens of milliseconds range. Image data at video rate can be handled and processed online or offline with a dedicated computer. A big challenge of such an application would be the differentiation of the signals coming from the guide star and the structures of interest. The guide star can be labeled with a slightly different color and a <b>synchronized</b> <b>filter</b> wheel {{in front of the}} camera can enable the differentiation of the images. Since the scattering properties depend on the wavelength, the labeling of the guide star and the biological structure must be as similar as possible. Another possibility could be to label the structures of interest with switchable fluorophores which can be turned on and off depending on the wavelength and timing of the excitation laser. However, if the in vivo dynamics change the scattering properties within a few milliseconds or faster, this technique would most probably suffer from low signal. Additionally, fast transfer of image data would be challenging.|$|R

The key idea is to filter all constraints of a scheduling problem in a synchronized way in order to scale better.

40|$|The {{effect of}} the shaping filter excess {{bandwidth}} {{in the performance of}} symbol-sampled receivers over unknown continuous-time channels is investigated. The shaping filter overall response is divided between the transmit and receive filters. The performance loss is determined in terms of information rate, and relative to the case of perfectly <b>synchronized</b> matched <b>filtering,</b> where the continuous-time channel has to be known a priori. Numerical results are presented for the case of a raised cosine shaping filter and 2 -ray and 3 -ray continuous-time channel models. We show that the losses increase with the increase of the excess bandwidth, reaching a maximum at 100 % excess bandwidth, and a minimum at no excess bandwidth. Index Term...|$|R

40|$|Phase-locked or APC loops {{have found}} {{increasing}} applications {{in recent years}} as tracking <b>filters,</b> <b>synchronizing</b> devices, and narrowband FM discriminators. Considerable work has been performed to determine the noise-squelching properties of the loop when it is operating in or near phase lock and is functioning as a linear coherent detector. However, insufficient consideration has been devoted to the non-linear behavior of the loop when it is out of lock and in the process of pulling in. Experimental evidence has indicated that there is a strong tendency for phase-locked loops to achieve lock under most circumstances. However, the analysis which has appeared in the literature iis limited to the acquisition of a constant frequency reference signal with only one phase-locked loop filter configuration. This work represents an investigation of frequency acquisition properties of phase-locked loops for a variety of reference-signal behavior and loop configuration...|$|R
40|$|A new {{scheme for}} the {{implementation}} of programmable FIR digital filters with 100 % operational efficiency is presented in this paper. The term 100 % operational efficiency implies that no zero bits have to be inserted between successive input data words in order the filter input to be <b>synchronized</b> with the <b>filter</b> output. Both the input data and the filter output are in two’s complement LSB-first bit-serial form. The coefficients are in two’s complement bit-parallel form. All the intermediate results and the filter output are produced and handled in full precision. The proposed scheme is based on a special serial-parallel multiplier that operates with 100 % efficiency. We exploit the internal registers and the free accumulation input in this multiplier to reduce the hardware complexity of the filter significantly. The proposed scheme is compared from the aspect of hardware complexity and efficiency with other bit-serial schemes. 1...|$|R
40|$|Warping {{techniques}} can be complicated {{and difficult to}} use, but {{through the use of}} fluid dynamics the warping becomes simple and it is intuitively controlled by physical properties such as viscosity and forces. These properties are naturally associated with the image itself or with spatial control handles. The key idea is to think of the image domain as a two-dimensional incompressible and homogeneous fluid, and to use the Navier Stokes equations to change it by applying forces to the image function. In this way, the process does not move the image values as in fluid simulations, but transforms the coordinates of a parametrization of the image through a vector field generated by the simulation equations — effectively acting as a texture mapping. 1 1. Introdution The process that changes the shape of objects in an image is called warping. The use of warping {{plays an important role in}} many applications, from the correction image distortions in medical data to the creation of special effects in the entertainment industry. Warping can also be used together with blending for creating transitions between different objects, a technique known as morphing [7]. More formally, given an image, f: U ⊂ R 2 ← C, the mapping between source space (u,v) and destination space (x,y) is called warping filter. Such a map, W (f) =g, acts on the input image f(u, v) giving rise to an output image g(x, y) that can be regarded as a deformation of the image domain [8]. Furthermore, in the case of morphing, a composition operator combines the result of two <b>synchronized</b> warping <b>filters</b> applied to different images. Spatial transformations based on Navier-Stokes equations, and the use of fluid dynamics in general, present a great potencial in the above context because they are very powerful to derive warping transformations. In the present paper we develop a framework where such a technique is exploited...|$|R
40|$|The Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory (STEREO), {{the third}} mission in NASA s Solar Terrestrial Probes program, was {{launched}} in 2006 on a two year mission to study solar phenomena like coronal mass ejections. STEREO consists of two nearly identical satellites, each carrying a suite of instruments that provide, among other data, simultaneous images of the Sun. One of these telescopes is the Extreme Ultraviolet Instrument (EUVI). There are two EUVI telescopes, one on each STEREO satellite (EUVI-A and EUVI-B). EUVI is a normal incidence, 98 mm diameter, Ritchey-Chretien telescope designed to obtain wide field of view (approx. 1 deg) images of the Sun at short wavelengths (approx. 20 nm) using a CCD detector. The telescope entrance aperture is divided into four quadrants by a mask near the secondary mirror spider veins. A mechanism that rotates another mask allows {{only one of these}} sub-apertures to accept light from the Sun during an observation. The EUVI is thus four co-aligned, off-axis telescopes. Each off-axis segment on the primary and secondary mirrors has a different extreme ultraviolet coating stack. Furthermore, the aperture select mechanism is <b>synchronized</b> with a <b>filter</b> wheel mechanism near the CCD detector. The EUVI contains no focus mechanism. Models predict that the difference in on-orbit operating temperature and ambient clean room conditions yield a "best focus" difference between integration and operation of approx. 0. 2 mm...|$|R
40|$|Time {{synchronization}} {{errors in}} GPS-aided {{inertial navigation systems}} Abstract—The effects of time synchronization errors in a GPSaided inertial navigation system (INS) are studied {{in terms of the}} increased error covariance of the state vector. Expressions for evaluating the error covariance of the navigation state vector— given the vehicle trajectory and the model of the INS error dynamics—are derived. Two different cases are studied in some detail. The first case considers a navigation system in which the timing error is not included in the integration filter. This leads to a system with an increased error covariance and a bias in the estimated forward acceleration. In the second case, a parameterization of the timing error is included {{as a part of the}} estimation problem in the data integration. The estimated timing error is fed back to control an adjustable fractional delay <b>filter,</b> <b>synchronizing</b> the inertial measurement unit (IMU) and GPS-receiver data. Simulation results show that by including the timing error in the estimation problem, almost perfect time synchronization is obtained and the bias in the forward acceleration is removed. The potential of the proposed method is illustrated with tests on real-world data that are subjected to timing errors. Moreover, through an observability analysis, it is shown that the timing error is observable for all trajectories that include turns or non-zero accelerations.

40|$|This thesis {{begins with}} a survey of current state-of-the art in-car {{navigation}} systems. The {{pros and cons of}} the four commonly used information sources — GNSS/RF-based positioning, vehicle motion sensors, vehicle models and map information — are described. Common filters to combine the information from the various sources are discussed. Next, a GNSS-aided inertial navigation platform is presented, into which further sensors such as a camera and wheel-speed encoder can be incorporated. The construction of the hardware platform, together with an extended Kalman filter for a closed-loop integration between the GNSS receiver and the inertial navigation system (INS), is described. Results from a field test are presented. Thereafter, an approach is studied for calibrating a low-cost inertial measurement unit (IMU), requiring no mechanical platform for the accelerometer calibration and only a simple rotating table for the gyro calibration. The performance of the calibration algorithm is compared with the Cramér-Rao bound for cases where a mechanical platform is used to rotate the IMU into different precisely controlled orientations. Finally, the effects of time synchronization errors in a GNSS-aided INS are studied in terms of the increased error covariance of the state vector. Expressions for evaluating the error covariance of the navigation state vector are derived. Two different cases are studied in some detail. The first considers a navigation system in which the timing error is not taken into account by the integration filter. This leads to a system with an increased error covariance and a bias in the estimated forward acceleration. In the second case, a parameterization of the timing error is included as part of the estimation problem in the data integration. The estimated timing error is fed back to control an adjustable fractional delay <b>filter,</b> <b>synchronizing</b> the IMU and GNSS-receiver data. QC 2010111...|$|R
