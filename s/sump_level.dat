Controlling motor speed with load change has proven very successful in many applications such as water pumping. It is therefore important to optimize the efficiency of motor drive and pump systems if significant energy savings are to be obtained. The system gives best performance when system operates at the rated operating condition with the constant pressure head. But in actual operation the system is operating different operating point due to present system condition. (Actual system head may vary with the <b>sump</b> <b>level,</b> and the designed pump characteristics may not match with the present condition, so on). This causes to inefficient system operation. // This thesis proposes a new control scheme based on Neuro-Fuzzy concepts. The fuzzy logic concept used computes the required motor speed to meet the optimum overall efficiency of the pumping system {{in the presence of}} the variation of the output pressure, <b>sump</b> <b>level</b> and tank level. An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) used to predict the required Voltage and Frequency as the speed changes. // The network was trained on a set of data patterns generated by calculation based on the induction motor with pump equivalent circuit, using Matlab/Simulink computer piograme. A simulation result of overall efficiency and specific energy consumption has shown a very good concordance between the two methods, (with or without Neuro-Fuzzy controller). // The detail of overall energy saving while proposed Neuro-Fuzzy control shows below table. Energy savings 433, 555 kWh per annum Benefit Rs. 3, 077, 850. 00 perannuam The proposed methods can be easily implemented on pumping system equipped with pressure sensors. However, like many pumping system control techniques, the developed model is sensitive to motor and pump parameter variation due to temperature changes. // Finally, the advantages that can be gained by Neuro-Fuzzy controller with the proposed efficiency optimization algorithm are tremendous, and energy saving can be achieved with a very high percentage, specially in the field of water pumping systems...|$|E

Thus study of operational failures, which may results into incidents or accidents, in a distillation column unit by simulation is of value. In such cases, a mandatory condition in safety assessment is the detailed disturbance analysis through simulation to cover {{a wide range of}} operation. In this paper, scenarios such as loss of cooling, more or less steam flow rate, high or low feed flow rate etc. are simulated to evaluate control structures and for safety examination. This is achieved through introduction of small and large disturbances. The distillation column unit, which is part of a hydrocarbon recovery plant, from a real chemical plant is taken for case study. The operational failures in distillation column unit under study were identified through simulation with two different inferential configurations and a dual composition control scheme. Simulation results illustrates that the condenser level controller, <b>sump</b> <b>level</b> controller, temperature controller and vent to atmosphere keeps the process controlled variables at the set point for these disturbances except for the case where 20 % reduction in feed was introduced...|$|E

A variation of the <b>sump</b> oil <b>level</b> affects different working conditions of gears, such as the power loss, the heat generation, and the load-carrying capacity with respect to different types of damage. In particular, reduced oil levels decrease the scuffing load capacity of gears because of high bulk temperatures and reduced oil quantity in the gear mesh. Investigations were made in a back-to-back hypoid gear test rig to evaluate the influence of the bath oil level on the scuffing load-carrying capacity of dip lubricated hypoid gears...|$|R

40|$|This thesis interprets {{about the}} {{dynamics}} and control study of distillation columns using Aspen. As {{all of us}} are aware, that distillation {{is one of the most}} important separation processes in the Chemical Engineering. In the present thesis, simulation studies of the distillation column are presented. Steady state simulations are being performed using Aspen Plus followed by Aspen Dynamic simulation, licensed software of Aspen Tech. In the steady state simulation we have tried to see the effect of changing the flow rate of the extracting solvent etc., which gives criterion about the optimum flow rate in the distillation column. The basic controllers are used for controlling <b>sump</b> <b>level,</b> reflux level and molar feed flow rate. Further two important strategies used for controlling the purity of distillate are: (1) controlling the tray temperature where the maximum change of temperature is observed due to reboiler heat change (2) composition controller. Tyreus ¡VLuyben method is used to tune the proportional integrator controller (PI) for temperature and composition control. The location of temperature controlled tray is obtained by steady state gain value. The design value of integral time constant, I ƒä of temperature control and composition control configurations are found as 2. 54 min. and 68. 54 min. respectively. Hence, response of temperature controller is faster than the composition controller, but on account of less purity. Thus results encourage to use cascade controller...|$|E
40|$|This {{document}} {{describes the}} actions taken to confirm {{and respond to}} a very small (0. 046 ml/min) leak in the stainless steel liner of Hanford`s Waste Encapsulation and Storage Facility (WESF) storage pool cell 5 in Building 225 -B. Manual level measurements confirmed a consistent weekly accumulation of 0. 46 liters {{of water in the}} leak detection grid sump below the pool cell 5 liner. Video inspections and samples point to the capsule storage pool as the source of the water. The present leak rate corresponds to a decrease of only 0. 002 inches per week in the pool cell water level, and consequently does not threaten any catastrophic loss of pool cell shielding and cooling water. The configuration of the pool cell liner, sump system, and associated risers will limit the short-term consequences of even a total liner breach to a loss of 1 inch in pool cell level. The small amount of demineralized pool cell water which has been in contact with the concrete structure is not enough to cause significant structural damage. However, ongoing water-concrete interaction increases. The pool cell leak detection sump instrumentation will be modified to improve monitoring of the leak rate in the future. Weekly manual <b>sump</b> <b>level</b> measurements continue in the interim. Contingency plans are in place to relocate the pool cell 5 capsules if the leak worsens...|$|E
40|$|Reactive {{distillation}} {{has enormous}} {{potential for the}} economical synthesis of tertiary ethers. Methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) has been commercially produced with this technology since the early 1980 s {{and it appears that}} the process also has application for Ethyl tert-butyl ether (ETBE) and other ethers. However, the combination of reaction and distillation in a single unit operation produces a process complexity that inhibits expeditious design and tight control, and presents a technology risk for potential developers. This particularly applies to hybrid reactive distillation where both reactive and non-reactive column sections are employed. The steady state simulation of a series of reactive distillation columns and processes for the production of ETBE and MTBE illuminated a number of important issues related to the optimal design techniques. Many of these issues are peculiar to reactive distillation and would not reasonably be anticipated without a priori knowledge of the phenomena involved. For example, the addition of theoretical equilibrium stages and an increase in the reflux ratio do not always have a directionally equivalent effect. The trade-off between energy consumption and capital cost which is the basis for most distillation designs cannot always be applied to reactive distillation. Importantly, the use of standard modelling techniques for equilibrium processes was also validated for reactive distillation design. The use of residue curve diagrams and reactive residue curve diagrams for the design of reactive distillation processes was investigated and shown to provide useful information regarding the feasibility of reaction-separations. Combined with simulation tools (e. g. Pro/II and SpeedUp), these techniques form the basis of a proposed design strategy for hybrid reactive distillation. It is important to apply these design tools appropriately and to ++select the correct process for a given application. The optimal design must also consider economics and the relative values of products, reactants and energy. These issues were studied with respect to ETBE production for gasoline oxygenation. The complexity of hybrid reactive distillation not only presents design challenges but potentially makes the process more difficult to control. Dynamic simulations of ETBE and MTBE reactive distillation processes were used to explore some unusual dynamic phenomena and to elucidate the process non-linearity and bidirectionality of reactive distillation. The presence of multiple steady states for some reactive distillation columns has been documented previously but the analysis of this behaviour has been incomplete and somewhat flawed. It was shown that the distinction between molar inputs and physically realisable mass or volumetric inputs is crucial and that multiplicity could be present in one case and not in the other. Multiplicity that is only observed with molar inputs (relatively common) was termed pseudo-multiplicity. Pseudo-multiplicity has few implications for the operation and control of practical reactive distillation processes although most literature examples of multiple steady states fall into this category. Four distinct causes of output multiplicity were identified including one new cause, reaction hysteresis, which is only applicable to hybrid reactive distillation. It was shown, using dynamic simulations, that transitions between parallel steady states are possible for a range of physically realisable and practical disturbances. This contrasts with other work in the area, which examines only unrealisable events and control schemes. An extensive analysis of reactive distillation control was also undertaken with respect to ETBE and MTBE hybrid columns. Manual (open-loop) control was shown to be impractical due to ++the need to sustain the operating conditions at close to the optimal values in order to produce acceptable process performance. One-point composition control was found to be relatively easy to implement and effective with either an energy-balance or a material-balance control scheme provided only one steady state was present. Where multiple steady states exist, there are restrictions on the feasible control structures due to unavoidable instability in the inventory controllers. For example, if multiple steady states exist for the one value of the reboiler duty, only the bottoms product draw rate can be used to control the reboiler <b>sump</b> <b>level.</b> Thus, a material-balance control structure that uses the reboiler duty to control the <b>sump</b> <b>level</b> cannot be implemented in practice. Two-point control was also investigated and found to effectively prevent transitions between parallel steady states. Although more complex and difficult to implement than one-point control, a two-point scheme could be used successfully to control both the product composition and the reactant conversion and this could be desirable in some cases. A reactive distillation pilot plant was designed and operated for ETBE synthesis from ethanol and a locally available refinery hydrocarbon stream. The design of the pilot plant was based on simulation studies and the objective of operating in the industrially significant ranges of product purity and isobutene conversion. A fully automatic control system was designed and installed on the pilot plant to permit precise control of the manipulated variables and the framework to implement a range of control structures and schemes.

40|$|Prediction of {{pump station}} alarms {{based on data}} is an {{interesting}} future service for companies as {{it allows them to}} both offer a new service and reduce the downtime of the pumps. In order to predict the alarms a study of the available data was done in order to examine feasibility and identify problems. The chosen solution was to use two neural networks which were connected in a chain to create a complete solution. The first neural network used long short term memory (LSTM) neurons in order to recursively predict time-series data from sensors, such as <b>sump</b> water <b>level</b> and pump electric current, this was then used by the second LSTM neural network in order to determine if these parameter values would trigger an alarm. The second LSTM network was unable to determine if an alarm would happen and thus the whole solution did not work. There were two main reasons for this, the first being that the alarms stop time did not correlate to the time-series sensor data which created an uncertainty of which parameter levels actually belonged to an alarm, making the LSTM network unable to identify what an alarm is. The second reason was that the data was downsampled too much making it even harder for the LSTM network to identify what an alarm was.

40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of a physical model study of the Market Avenue Retention Basin (MARB) located in Orand Rapids, Michigan. The model study was conducted for Dell Engineering, Inc. and the City of Orand Rapids, MI. The MARB described herein is a combined sewer overflow retention basin located in Orand Rapids, MI. The facility consists of a pumping station with ten pumps and three retention basins. The sump is designed to function through a ten foot operating range, with an additional pump coming on-line with each one foot rise in the <b>sump</b> <b>level.</b> The water enters the first basin through any of the ten pumps and discharges into Basin Two through an outfall channel when the elevation reaches 622 ft. Basin Two is a large triangular shaped area with eight elevated channels that water is allowed to overtop and enter Basin Three. Because this is a combined sewer plant the number of pumps in operation, and hence the pumping rate, varies with the magnitude of the storm event. Each 'PU 1 Tt 1 ' is'rated at 105 million gallons per day (MOD), giving the maximum basin capacity of 1050 MOD when all ten pumps are in operation. The initial scope of this study focused on the hydraulic efficiency of Basin Two as a secondary sedimentation basin. The objective was to determine if short-circuiting occurred, and if so, to test various baffle arrangements to mitigate the short-circuiting. During the assessment process, it became clear that in addition to its capacity as a settling compartment, Basin Two was also being used as a disinfection chamber. With this in mind, and since it is impOliant for disinfection to occur properly, sufficient chlorine contact time with all effluent is necessary. Since the model study of the existing facility confirmed that the necessary contact time was not being achieved, alternative baffle designs were developed to increase the residence time to that needed for satisfactory disinfection. The results of this model study illustrate the efficiency of Basin Two as a sedimentation basin as well as a retention basin for chlorine disinfection. The information obtained from the experiments is given in the results section of the report and except where noted, all data has been scaled to existing facility values.

40|$|Engine oil {{consumption}} {{is an important}} source of hydrocarbon and particulate emissions in modem automobile engines. Great efforts have been made by automotive manufacturers to minimize the impact of {{oil consumption}} on engine emissions. Research engineers in the last decade have been trying to study the sources and driving mechanism of oil consumption. In contrast to oil consumption mechanisms in the piston-ring-liner system of the engine, the Positive Crankcase Ventilation (PCV) blowby-oil consumption mechanism has not yet been fully characterized. Studies have shown that the blowby contribution to oil consumption could be significant under certain conditions. In this study, an experimental approach was taken in order to study the sources and characteristics of oil in the PCV blowby gases at different speeds and loads. An extensive diagnostic system was successfully integrated in a production spark ignition engine, to measure total oil consumption, blowby oil consumption and flow and in-cylinder variables, such as inter-ring pressures, oil film thickness and liner temperatures. Results showed an increase in blowby oil consumption with load and speed. Blowby flow was mainly dependent on the load of the engine. Oil concentration in the blowby varied with engine operating conditions. A strong relationship was observed between oil consumption and <b>sump</b> oil <b>level,</b> showing that the oil in the crankcase is {{an important source of}} oil in the blowby. Moreover, extensive experiments were conducted to determine the blowby flow's oil characteristics, by varying the liner temperatures and analyzing the mass distribution of different oil particle size. It was found that the average oil droplet size decreased as the load and speed were increased. (cont.) This work is an important step in understanding blowby oil consumption in efforts to minimize oil consumption in spark ignition engines. by Oscar Lopez. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|It is {{well known}} that the release of {{long-lived}} radionuclides to the water path is probably the most relevant radiological risk originating from an underground repository. Transuranic elements (ie. all elements with an atomic number greater than 92 (U)) do not have any non-radioactive isotopes and are very rare in natural materials. The long term geochemical behaviour of these elements must thus be derived from chemical analogues such as the rare earth elements (REE), Th and U. Steenkampskraal monazite mine, situated 350 km north of Cape Town, {{has been found to be}} an excellent locality for the study of these elements, due to the high concentration of these elements in the ore as well as the ideal geology, which consists of low permeability rocks with groundwater flow governed by fractures. The ore body consists of a monazite [(REE, Th, U) P 04], apatite [Ca₃P 0 ₄) ₂], chalcopyrite [CuFeS] and magnetite [FeP₄] veindeposit. Water was sampled from six boreholes in the vicinity of the mine and five wi. ndpumps on the surrounding farm Nabeep and Brandewynskraal. Surface water samples were taken from the slimes dam, an ephemeral stream on the western side of the mine, as well as from the surface of a road shortly after rain, below the tailings. Four water samples were taken from within the underground mine workings (Mainshaft, Main shaft extension, <b>Sump</b> on <b>level</b> 3 and Inclined shaft). Colloids were sampled from three of the boreholes and a precipitate was taken from the surface of the main shaft water. Soils were sampled along two transects away from the mine on the eastern and western side of the ore body. Due to the topography of the area, surface contamination could only occur on these two sides. Stable isotopes of oxygen (8 180) and hydrogen ((8 180) indicated the presence of two distinct groups of waters within the vicinity of the mine. One group is composed of unevaporated waters and includes all borehole sand the water sampled in the inclined shaft. The water moving through the inclined shaft is in contact with the ground water. A second group of highly evaporated waters was present in the slin 1 es dam samples as well as the underground water samples not directly in contact with groundwater. Groundwater contamination by REE-bearing phosphate minerals has resulted in measurable concentrations of U, Th and REE in all mine waters and boreholes in the near vicinity of the mine. The chondritenormalized REE patterns of the water samples are sin 1 ilar to those displayed by monazite, with a distinctive Eu depletion and an obvious enrichment in LREE with respect to HREE. Monazite-normalized REE patterns for the selected borehole waters show a marked fractionation between LREE and HREE, with the HREE strongly enriched in the aqueous phase. Heavy REE have been shown to have a greater tendency for complexatioi 1 and a greater affinity for mineral surfaces. In the present study, the three boreholes in which colloids were found had high concentrations of U, Th and REE. It is likely that colloidal transport of these elements is the dominant mechanism of transport...|$|R
