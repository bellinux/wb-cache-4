However, Padayappa saves her life when he {{prevents}} a bull from attacking her, {{while at the same}} time dodging the bullets she fires at him. Rather than live with the humiliation of knowing she was unsuccessful in avenging her father's death, as well as having her life saved by her enemy, Neelambari commits suicide, promising to take revenge on Padayappa in her next birth. Padayappa prays for her <b>soul</b> <b>to</b> be at peace and eventually attain salvation.|$|E

5|$|Priestley {{strongly}} {{suggested that}} there is no mind-body duality, and put forth a materialist philosophy in these works; that is, one founded on the principle that everything in the universe is made of matter that we can perceive. He also contended that discussing the soul is impossible because it is made of a divine substance, and humanity cannot perceive the divine. Despite his separation of the divine from the mortal, this position shocked and angered many of his readers, who believed that such a duality was necessary for the <b>soul</b> <b>to</b> exist.|$|E

The Vachanamrut is the scripture most commonly used in the Swaminarayan sect. It contains views on dharma (moral conduct), jnana (understanding {{of the nature of}} the self), vairagya (detachment from material pleasure), and bhakti (pure, selfless devotion to God), the four essentials Hindu scriptures describe as necessary for a jiva (<b>soul)</b> <b>to</b> attain moksha (salvation).|$|E
5|$|The Genocide run {{requires}} the player to kill all monsters and maximize their LOVE. As Frisk reaches Asgore's castle, Sans attempts to stop them, but Frisk kills him along with Asgore and Flowey. Chara materializes after Flowey is killed and explains {{that they were}} resurrected by the player's LOVE. The player is then asked to join them {{in the destruction of}} the universe, which occurs regardless of the player's choice. In order to enable further replays of the game, Frisk must first give their <b>soul</b> <b>to</b> Chara in exchange for restoring the universe. In doing so, the ending of every subsequent Pacifist route is marred by Chara's malevolent presence.|$|E

5|$|The Motown Record Corporation in Detroit, Michigan became {{successful}} {{with a string}} of heavily pop-influenced soul records, which were palatable enough to white listeners so as to allow R and <b>soul</b> <b>to</b> crossover to mainstream audiences. An important center of soul music recording was Florence, Alabama, where the FAME Studios operated. Jimmy Hughes, Percy Sledge and Arthur Alexander recorded at Fame; later in the 1960s, Aretha Franklin would also record in the area. Fame Studios, often referred to as Muscle Shoals, after a town neighboring Florence, enjoyed a close relationship with Stax, and many of the musicians and producers who worked in Memphis also contributed to recordings done in Alabama.|$|E
5|$|As {{introduced}} in Soulcalibur, Ivy {{was raised by}} the Valentines, a noble family in London, England. Ivy's father became obsessed with the cursed sword Soul Edge, and worked himself to death. Her mother died shortly afterward, and revealed to Ivy {{that she was not}} their biological daughter. Becoming an alchemist, Ivy learned of her father's obsession and decided to destroy Soul Edge. She created an animated, segmented sword, bringing it to life by unknowingly summoning Soul Edge's current host, Nightmare, and was convinced to become one of his servants without realizing he wielded the blade she sought. After learning the truth, and that her real father was the sword's previous host Cervantes and her to be its next, she departed. Continuing her quest to destroy the sword in later games, Ivy was attacked by Cervantes and her soul consumed in Soulcalibur IV. Using an artificial <b>soul</b> <b>to</b> keep herself alive, she acts as a teacher to younger warriors when the sword re-appears years later.|$|E

The corpse is revealed as that of a servant when Lady Van Tassel (Miranda Richardson) emerges alive to ambush Katrina. Lady Van Tassel tells Katrina that her family was driven from their ancestral home by the Van Garretts, who then sold it to the Van Tassels. She proceeded to pledge her <b>soul</b> <b>to</b> Satan and become a witch, summoning the Horseman to kill Van Garrett, his son, new wife, unborn child, and every villager who knew about his new will, marriage, and child, {{in order to be able}} to claim everything that she deemed to be rightfully hers uncontested. She then sends the Horseman after Katrina to remove the last obstacle to inheriting the combined Van Garrett and Van Tassel estates.|$|E

They later conduct research at Bobby's home, hoping to determine Azazel's plan. Ellen Harvelle (Samantha Ferris), owner of the now-destroyed Roadhouse, then arrives, and is forced to drink holy water to prove {{that she is not}} possessed by a demon. After giving them a map of Wyoming that Ash had left in the Roadhouse's safe, she points out five X's that have been marked, representing frontier churches built by Samuel Colt—hunter and creator of the mystical Colt, a gun capable of killing anything. Research also shows that railway lines connect all the churches {{in the form of a}} pentagram, creating a giant devil's trap that demons cannot enter.|$|E
5|$|Donen briefly {{returned}} to the musical genre in 1958 with Damn Yankees!, based on George Abbott's Broadway hit. He again co-directed with Abbott in the same hands-off collaboration as their first film. Like The Pajama Game the film includes music by Adler and Ross and choreography by Fosse. It starred Tab Hunter, Gwen Verdon, and Ray Walston. Damn Yankees! is an adaptation of the Faust legend about {{a fan of the}} baseball team the Washington Senators who mentions that he would sell his <b>soul</b> <b>to</b> give the losing team a good hitter. Walston plays the Brooks Brothers-attired Devil who grants the fan his wish and transforms him into the muscular young hitter Joe Hardy (Hunter). Donen was able to shoot three real Senator-Yankee games on location with as many as seven hidden cameras. The low-budget film was a moderate financial success and received good reviews. It was also Donen's last musical film for many years.|$|E

A number of armored soldiers are sent through the portal, only to emerge on the other side in the city of Liore as mutated zombie-like creatures. Alphonse, who is visiting Liore, fights off the armored soldiers and merges parts of his <b>soul</b> <b>to</b> three of their suits to aid him in combat. Meanwhile, Edward breaks into the Thule Society headquarters and accidentally reopens the portal, returning the dead armored soldiers to Earth and allowing Alphonse's armored form to briefly reunite with his brother before his soul returns to his body, increasing Edward's determination to return to his world.|$|E
5|$|The {{first half}} of the anime's plot follows that of the manga, but the plots {{severely}} diverge from each other near the middle of the story. After Kimblee uses alchemy to transform Al's armor into explosive material, Scar transfers all of his incomplete Philosopher's Stone into Al to save his life. As a result, Alphonse's armor becomes the Philosopher's Stone. Because he houses the Stone in his body, he becomes the primary target of the homunculi's leader Dante, who is trying to cheat death. Once captured by the homunculi for Dante, Al is to be eaten by Gluttony to complete the Stone inside Gluttony's body. But when he sees his brother killed trying to save him, Al uses the stone's power to heal Edward's body and re-bind his <b>soul</b> <b>to</b> it. This destroys Al's own body as he uses up the whole of the Philosopher's Stone in the transmutations. Then Edward, using his own body, resurrects Alphonse. As a result, Edward disappears and Alphonse continues studying alchemy to find him.|$|E
5|$|The trio {{flies to}} the Mana Fortress and confronts Thanatos, who is {{preparing}} to transfer his mind into Dyluck. With {{the last of his}} strength, Dyluck warns that Thanatos has sold his <b>soul</b> <b>to</b> the underworld and must not be allowed to have the Fortress. Dyluck kills himself, forcing Thanatos to revert to a skeletal lich form, which the party defeats. The Mana Beast finally flies in and attacks the Fortress. The hero expresses reluctance to kill the Beast, fearing that with the dispersal of Mana from the world, the sprite will vanish. With the sprite's encouragement, he uses the fully energized Mana Sword to slay the Beast, causing it to explode and transform into snow. At the conclusion of the game, the hero is seen returning the Mana Sword to its place beneath the Potos waterfall.|$|E
