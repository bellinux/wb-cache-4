40|$|According to the Chapman multi-scale rock {{physical}} model, {{the seismic}} <b>response</b> <b>characteristics</b> vary for different fluid-saturated reservoirs. For class I AVO reservoirs and gas-saturation, the seismic response is a high-frequency bright spot as the amplitude energy shifts. However, it is a low-frequency shadow for the Class III AVO reservoirs saturated with hydrocarbons. In this paper, we verified the high-frequency bright spot results of Chapman for the Class I AVO response using the frequency-dependent {{analysis of a}} physical model dataset. The physical model is designed as inter-bedded thin sand and shale based on real field geology parameters. We observed two datasets using fixed offset and 2 D geometry with different fluidsaturated conditions. Spectral and time-frequency analyses methods are applied to the seismic datasets to describe the <b>response</b> <b>characteristics</b> for gas-, water-, and oil-saturation. The results of physical model dataset processing and analysis indicate that reflection wave tuning and fluid-related dispersion are the main seismic <b>response</b> <b>characteristic</b> mechanisms. Additionally, the gas saturation model can be distinguished from water and oil saturation for Class I AVO utilizing the frequency-dependent abnormal characteristic. The frequency-dependent characteristic analysis of the physical model dataset verified the different spectral <b>response</b> <b>characteristics</b> corresponding to the different fluid-saturated models. Therefore, by careful analysis of real field seismic data, we can obtain the abnormal spectral characteristics induced by the fluid variation and implement fluid detection using seismic data directly. ...|$|R

40|$|A new {{approach}} to regionalisation for prediction of flow characteristics in ungauged catchments is presented. If flows in ungauged catchments are to be predicted using calibrated rainfall-runoff models, regional relationships between the parameters of such models and catchment attributes must be determined. This is only possible with parsimonious models (fewer than about 7 parameters), and even then there are considerable uncertainties in the prediction of ungauged catchment response, due to the accumulation of uncertainties in the regionalization process for estimating parameter values. The uncertainties in the catchment attributes and climate data used for the ungauged catchment combine with the uncertainty in the relationships between catchment attributes and model parameters for the gauged catchments. Moreover, these relationships are subject to uncertainty in both catchment attributes and gauged-catchment model parameter values. The latter are influenced by model structure, parameter identifiability, subjective selection of "optimal" parameter values and errors in the climate data. The uncertainty for the ungauged catchment can be minimised either by minimising each contributing uncertainty or by altering the approach so as to bypass some of them. An example of the second option is to regionalize catchment <b>response</b> <b>characteristics</b> rather than model parameters, then relate the ungauged-catchment model parameter values to these <b>response</b> <b>characteristics.</b> This bypasses the influence of model structure, parameter identifiability and subjective selection of "optimal" parameter values, thereby reducing uncertainty in the estimates of the <b>response</b> <b>characteristics</b> at the catchment scale.
