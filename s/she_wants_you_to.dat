60|$|THE BISHOP. Mrs Collins has {{something}} to say to me that <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> hear.|$|E
6000|$|LORD WINDERMERE. Margaret, {{you could}} save this woman. She {{wants to get}} back into society, and <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> help her. [Crossing to her.] ...|$|E
60|$|Black her eye for love's sake, if you will; {{but it is}} all-to-the-good {{business}} to do a thing when <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> do it.|$|E
6000|$|... "I guess <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> help her," [...] said Dick bitterly. Then he {{continued}} suddenly: [...] "Have <b>you</b> anything <b>to</b> do just now?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How {{much does}} <b>she</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> have?" [...] I asked, laughing. [...] "She ought {{to fix the}} sum, so that I may stay till it's made up." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, this evening, say; and, by the way, couldn't {{you come}} up and see Lillie a little while this morning? She sent her love <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> {{and said she was}} so hurried with packing, and all that, that <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> excuse her not calling." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Lady Kelsey {{has offered}} to pay his {{expenses}} at the 'Varsity,' answered Dick, 'and <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> go and stay with her for the present.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Devine {{took the}} letter. [...] "I fancy <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> go," [...] she said. [...] "She {{mentions}} {{that she has}} asked you several times already." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come in, mamma; here's the housemaid been {{bullying}} Essie, and <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> help her. These two can {{go round}} the park by themselves, can't they ?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Edward {{shook his}} head. [...] "I was merely envying Miss Drewitt her {{possession}} of you," [...] he said, carelessly, [...] "and I {{was just about}} to remark that I wished you were my uncle too, when she came indoors. I suppose <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> hear it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, Miss Mary Jane <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> do that. <b>She</b> says, 'Tell {{them to give}} Uncle Harvey and William my {{love and}} a kiss, and say I've run over the river to see Mr.'--Mr.--what IS {{the name of that}} rich family your uncle Peter used to think so much of?--I mean the one that--" ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{restrained}} the words: [...] "Of course it's old {{to a kid}} like you!" [...] And, instead, {{he looked}} at her. Was she exactly a kid? She seemed quite tall (for a girl) and not very thin, {{and there was something}} frank and soft about her face, and as if <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> be nice to her.|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{was writing}} {{to me and}} she put this under cover. I know what it contains. <b>She</b> <b>wants</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> go to her at Cheltenham for a month." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "To the westward," [...] {{explained}} Almayer, {{under his}} breath. [...] "She remembers everything. <b>She</b> <b>wants</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> {{build a house}} of cards. You did, {{last time you were}} here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'She {{said you}} would have these delusions, but must pay no {{attention}} to them. <b>She</b> <b>wants</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> particularly remember that there are no such things as hunger and thirst and pain.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mrs. Acton's {{a mighty}} smart woman, but she plays some fool tricks," [...] he commented. [...] "Where's the blame use in taking a {{boatload}} of folks after trout when {{none of them}} but the boss knows how to fish?" [...] Then he chuckled. [...] "You'd have gone with the rest this morning if <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>you</b> <b>to.</b> Guess the gig would have carried another one quite nicely." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, but let Tilly undress you. Let Tilly undress you, {{who loves}} you, don't be wilful to-night. Mother's poorly, <b>she</b> doesn't <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> cry." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's yours," [...] {{said the}} vice-consul, sourly, almost savagely. [...] "She didn't give it <b>to</b> <b>you</b> without <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> have it, and she didn't expect <b>you</b> <b>to</b> pay her bequests with it. In my opinion," [...] he burst out, in a wrathful {{recollection}} {{of his own}} sufferings from Mrs. Lander, [...] "she didn't give you a millionth part of your due for all the trouble she made you; and I want Mr. Orson to understand that, right here." ...|$|R
6000|$|Klaus {{looked up}} quickly. [...] "You {{can see what}} she's trying to say. She thinks I'm the Second Variety. Don't you see, Major? Now <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> believe I killed him on purpose. That I'm--" ...|$|E
6000|$|The boy {{answered}} with the disgust a sister's company manners always rouse in a brother. [...] "Motha wants you. Says she's wo'ked down, and <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> come and help." [...] Then he went his way.|$|E
6000|$|... "To {{protect her}} from Miss Dawkins, I think. <b>She</b> <b>wants</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> ride at her side, so that Dawkins mayn't get at her. Now, Mr. Ingram, I'll bet you half-a-crown I'm {{at the top of}} the big Pyramid before you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Greatson," [...] she said, [...] "do {{you know}} what I should <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> do if I were Isobel--what I am quite sure that <b>she</b> must <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> do now?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She has a notion," [...] Corp explained, growing grave again, [...] "that it wouldna do for <b>you</b> <b>to</b> own {{the like}} o' us. 'We mauna cheapen him,' <b>she</b> said. <b>She</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> {{see that we}} hinna been cheapening you." [...] He said, in a sepulchral voice, [...] "There has been leddies here, {{and they want to}} ken what Thomas Sandys was like as a boy. It's me they speir for, but Gavinia she just shoves me out o' sight, and says she, 'Leave them to me.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Marse Tom, if {{you would}} only be a little patient, and not fly off the handle at the least little thing. Why, <b>she</b> only <b>wants</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> speak to him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They say--Mrs d'Urberville says--that <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> {{look after}} a little fowl-farm which is her hobby. But this is only her artful way of getting 'ee there without raising your hopes. She's going to own 'ee as kin--that's the meaning o't." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, it wasn't. The {{girl was}} carried out of herself. She is somehow enslaved by Clarke, and she wants help. She wants to be investigated; but she wants it done privately. <b>She</b> <b>wants</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> do it. She begs you to do it." ...|$|E
6000|$|Some {{time after}} supper Mrs. Farnam went away, and Farnam {{presently}} made {{an excuse for}} following his wife. When they had gone George remarked: [...] "I must pull out to-morrow, but Florence sends a message. <b>She</b> <b>wants</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> stop with us {{for two or three}} months." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'She {{asked me}} <b>to</b> bring <b>you</b> {{here in the}} hope that you'd,'--Alec had some {{difficulty}} in expressing himself--'do something that would make people forget what happened to your father. She's very proud of her family. She feels that your good name is--besmirched, and <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> give it a new lustre. I think that is the object she has most at heart in the world. It is as great as her love for you. The plan hasn't been much of a success, has it?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She's poorly, my lamb, she's poorly to-night, but she'll {{be better}} by mornin'. Oh, don't cry, don't cry, love, <b>she</b> doesn't <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> cry, {{precious}} little heart, no, she doesn't." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> know me--she thought I {{would like}} you!" [...] And {{apparently}} {{she had not}} been wrong; for Mrs. Luna, when they reached Beacon Street, would not hear of his leaving her to go her way alone, would not in the least admit his plea that he had only an hour or two more in Boston (he was to travel, economically, by the boat) and must devote the time to his business. She appealed to his Southern chivalry, and not in vain; practically, at least, he admitted the rights of women.|$|R
6000|$|... "What do {{you suppose}} <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> go there for? As for {{political}} life, I am quite sure {{it would be the}} death of you. If I were you I wouldn't go near her. You have got out of the scrape, and I would remain out." ...|$|E
6000|$|MRS. ERLYNNE. [Rising hurriedly.] Oh, no! It's nothing serious. She's {{only very}} tired, that is all. Besides, {{there are people}} still in the supper-room. <b>She</b> <b>wants</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> make her apologies to them. She said she didn't wish to be disturbed. [Drops letter.] She asked me to tell you! ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No, sir, an' Missis says she's sure he won't come now, an' <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> come in an' hev tea. Dear heart, Miss Lizzie, you've stained your pinafore, an' I shouldn't {{wonder if}} it's gone through to your frock. There'll be fine work! Come alonk wi' me, do.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Good morning," [...] he said absently. [...] "I {{have just}} called {{on my way}} to school with a message from Miss Millar. <b>She</b> <b>wants</b> <b>you</b> all <b>to</b> come up and have Christmas dinner with her tomorrow." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, Aunt Ermine {{said you}} were coming, and that I might meet you, but that I must let you come in alone, for {{she had not seen}} you so long, that <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>you</b> all <b>to</b> herself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, no, no," [...] cried Felicity quickly, {{before the}} Story Girl could speak, [...] "none {{of us would}} ever think THAT. Sara only meant <b>she</b> didn't <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> go to any bother on our account." ...|$|R
