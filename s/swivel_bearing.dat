50|$|Exposed hub locks can {{be broken}} or damaged by {{off-road}} conditions, rendering 4×4 useless and leaving the vehicle stranded. Also, in some axle designs (such as those used on older Land Rovers), the top <b>swivel</b> <b>bearing</b> can become starved for lubrication (which is normally supplied by oil slung up by the rotating axle), unless the hubs are locked every few hundred miles. Also, since locking hubs generally do not require a key to operate, they can be maliciously locked or unlocked by persons other than the vehicle owner.|$|E
50|$|The first monowheel {{tractors}} {{appeared in}} the 1920s, {{as a result of}} technical developments in small petrol engines. These had been driven by improving engine technology, particularly for motorbikes. Such engines now represented an affordable and portable power source. An entire powertrain could be constructed as a single monobloc unit, carried on a single wheel, and this mounted onto a trailer through a large <b>swivel</b> <b>bearing.</b> The engine and its drivetrain represented a relatively high technology machine for the period, although its trailer could be much more crude. The engine units were made by the new light engineering works of the time, such as R A Lister, and custom-made trailers could be produced {{for a wide range of}} tasks by less sophisticated workshops, down to village blacksmiths.|$|E

On a conveying medium (1), support arms (2) are arranged horizontally and vertically to its travel direction, said support arms (2) forming a pair of support arms (3) to support the wheels of a motor vehicle axle.

40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a compact laser machining head for machining laser material, in particular for laser-based material machining processes, for 2 -D and 3 -D laser machining. Said laser-machining head {{consists of a}} sensor for geometry detection and/or contour tracing, one or several mirrors (4) and/or mirror systems comprising a mirror housing (2) and a mirror holder (5), a defined interface (1) for the machine beam guidance system (3) and other necessary components, terminals and lines. According to the invention, the sensor (7) in this compact machining head for geometry detection and/or contour tracing is fully integrated {{in the design of}} the laser machining head and is mounted in a <b>swivel</b> <b>bearing</b> about the sensor's axis of rotation (12) together with other laser machining head accessories related to the machining direction...|$|E

PRONKEVICH, I. MARTYNENKOПредставлена созданная математическая модель для расчета прямоугольных и квадратных в плане конструкций с неизменяемой геометрией, при комбинированном нагружении, основанная на методе начальных параметров. Полученная зависимость позволяет определить поля напряженно-деформированного состояния при моделировании модульного тренажерного комплекса для подготовки пожарных-спасателей и его механического поведения под воздействием собственного веса. Проведены виртуальные испытания в пакете ANSYS. Показаны опасные площади при оценке деформаций при местном выпучивании в соответствии с минимальным критическим напряжением. = The {{mathematical}} model for calculation rectangular and square {{in respect of}} designs with unchangeable geometry is created, at the combined loading, based on a method of initial parameters.

50|$|Ackermann {{steering}} {{separates the}} steering movement into two pivots, one near {{the hub of}} each front wheel. The beam axle between them remains fixed relative to the chassis, linked by the suspension. Ackermann steering has the two advantages that it reduces tyre scrub, the need to drag tyres sideways across their tread when turning the steering, and also it reduced bump steer, suspension and road bumps tending to upset the steering direction. The kingpins were now fixed to the axle ends and the hub carriers pivoted upon them. Most commonly {{the centre of the}} kingpin was fixed in the axle and the hub carrier was forked to fit over this, but some vehicles, including the Ford Model T illustrated, used a forked axle and a kingpin fixed into a single piece carrier. Kingpins were always clamped in the centre and the <b>swivel</b> <b>bearings</b> at the ends, to increase the lever arm and so reduce the bearing load.|$|R
40|$|Contained herein is the {{research}} and data acquired from the Turntable Design portion of the Spinning Rocket Simulator (SRS) project. The SRS Project studies and eliminates the effect of coning on thrust-propelled spacecraft. This design and construction of the turntable adds a structural support for the SRS model and two degrees of freedom. The two degrees of freedom, radial and circumferential, will help develop a simulated thrust force perpendicular to {{the plane of the}} spacecraft model while undergoing an unstable coning motion. The Turntable consists of a ten-foot linear track mounted to a sprocket and press-fit to a thrust bearing. A two-inch high column grounded by a Triangular Baseplate supports this bearing and houses the slip rings and pressurized, air-line <b>swivel.</b> The thrust <b>bearing</b> allows the entire system to rotate under the moment applied through the chain-driven sprocket producing a circumferential degree of freedom. The radial degree of freedom is given to the model through the helically threaded linear track. This track allows the Model Support and Counter Balance to simultaneously reposition according to the coning motion of the Model. Two design factors that hinder the linear track are bending and twist due to torsion. A Standard Aluminum "C" channel significantly reduces these two deflections. Safety considerations dictate the design of all the components involved in this project...|$|R
50|$|The patent Stülcken derrick is {{used for}} very heavy cargo. It stems from the German {{shipyard}} HC Stülcken & Sohn which has been taken over later by neighboring yard Blohm & Voss. This derrick can handle up to 300 tonnes. The Stülcken can be made ready in few minutes, dramatically faster than a traditional heavy derrick, doesn't require lots of space and is operated by four winches. Between two v-shaped, unstayed Samson-posts is the Stülcken secured. This {{makes it possible to}} let the derrick swing through the posts to reach another hatch. For each post is a hoisting winch, a span winch and a lever that is run by one man only. <b>Bearings,</b> <b>swivels,</b> sheaves and the gooseneck can be unattended for up to four years and create only a friction of about 2%. The span tackles are independent and the halyard is endless. With the revolving suspension heads on the posts it takes ten minutes to swing all the way through. In the double-pendulum block type, half of the cargo tackle can be anchored {{to the base of the}} boom. In order to double the hook speed, the halyard passes through the purchases since one end is secured which reduces the SWL to its half. Typical dimensions of a 275 tonne Stülcken are: 25.5 m length, 0.97 m diameter, 1.5 m to 3.4 m diameter of posts, 18 m apart the posts (upper end) and 8.4 m apart the posts (lower end). The hook of a full-loaded 275 tonne Stülcken can move 2.3 m per minute. If only one purchase is secured and the derrick is loaded with 137 tonnes the hook gains velocity to 4.6 m per min. Even more speed can be gained when the winch ratios are reduced to 100 tonnes (triple speed) and 68 tonnes (quadruple speed). Detaching the union table the double-pendulum block type of Stülcken is able to swing through which allows the lower blocks to swing freely to each side of the boom. In this way the derrick reaches a vertical position. A bullrope easily pulls the derrick to the other side until the weight of the cargo tips the derrick over. The span tackles now have the weight on the other side. The union table is fixed again and the derrick can start its work on the other side. There are also Stülcken with single-pendulum blocks. At this type the cargo hook is detached and the lower and upper cargo block are hauled into the center of the Stülcken. To tip the derrick over the gravity is here used again. A derrick helps pump oil in most offshore rigs.|$|R
