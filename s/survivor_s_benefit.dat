Specifically, the Article views the publicly held U. <b>S.</b> <b>benefit</b> corporation {{from the perspective}} of litigation risk. It first situates, in Part I, the U. <b>S.</b> <b>benefit</b> corporation in its structural and governance context as an incorporated business association. Corporate purpose and the attendant managerial authority, responsibilities, and fiduciary duties are the key points of reference. Then, in Part II, the Article seeks to identify and describe the salient, unique litigation risks that may be associated with publicly held corporations with the structural and governance attributes of a benefit corporation. These include both state litigation under the ultra vires doctrine and similarly situated statutory causes of action, as well as actions for breach of a corporate law fiduciary duty, and federal law causes of action for securities fraud and misstatements. The reflections in Part III draw conclusions from the synthesis of the observations made in Parts I and II. Specifically, Part III links the importance of a publicly held benefit corporation’s public benefit purpose to litigation risk management from several perspectives. The commentary in Part III is intended to be of use to government officials, policymakers, legal advisors of corporations, benefit corporation management, and academic observers, among others...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Social {{enterprise}} {{is becoming an}} increasingly popular and profitable venture in the United States {{and around the world}} today. In the United States, the benefit corporation model leads this movement, offering incorporating companies a positive image, a platform to build consumer trust, and the flexibility to pursue social good. However, though the benefit corporation form comes with the aforementioned branding advantages, states’ benefit corporation laws as they currently exist generally lack adequate oversight mechanisms. Consequently, third parties like B Lab play an important role as the primary enforcement entities ensuring that benefit corporations adhere to their stated purposes. The U. <b>S.</b> <b>benefit</b> corporation could gain from a close analysis of the U. K. community interest corporation, as the latter model places greater emphasis on impacts to local community and operates under strict government oversight. Simultaneously, U. K. community interest corporations could enhance their efficacy by incorporating benefit corporations’ emphasis on global branding. By gaining from the other’s strengths, U. <b>S.</b> <b>benefit</b> corporations and U. K. community interest corporations could gain considerable influence, not only as profitable and community-centered businesses but also as global leaders in today’s growing social enterprise movement...|$|R

Electrocardiograms and non-invasive blood pressure monitoring using a bedside monitor (BSM- 9100, Nihon Koden; Tokyo, Japan) were conducted. We defined heart rate and blood pressure variability as the standard deviation (SD) of the 2 variables measured during the first 24 hours after ICU admission. Patients were divided into 2 groups based on their outcome at hospital discharge: the <b>survivor</b> (<b>S)</b> and non-survivor (NS) groups. Patient outcomes were assessed by non-paired t-tests, Chi-squared tests, and a multivariate logistic regression analysis. P values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.|$|R
