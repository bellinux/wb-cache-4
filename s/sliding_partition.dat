It was constructed in 1843 and is a sprawling one-story fieldstone structure with shallow-pitched gable roof and a shed-roofed porch. The building replaced an earlier meetinghouse built in 1773.

Conforming to sectional design, covered verandahs were incorporated on both the ground and first floor, along all but the southern side of the building.

40|$|Abstract [...] Network worms are {{a growing}} threat to today’s Internet-connected {{networks}} and hosts. Modern worms can spread {{very quickly and}} widely so automatic response is required to contain worm outbreaks. In this paper, we propose a system that can automatically generate useful signatures {{that can be used}} by intrusion detection systems such as bro and snort to filter out or slow down the spread of the worm elsewhere in the network. Our system makes use of three sliding window techniques coupled with the Rabin fingerprint digest algorithm. The first method, the fixed <b>partition</b> <b>sliding</b> window scheme (FPSW), uses a fixed window size and a one-byte window sliding. The second method referred to as Variable-length <b>Partition</b> <b>Sliding</b> Window (VPSW), uses a variable length window with a predetermined breakmark. The third method, referred to as Variable-length Partition with multiple breakmarks (VPMB), is similar to VPSW except that multiple breakmarks are used. Our results indicate that while FPSW and VPSW methods are effective for detecting worms with mild changes in the worm code contents, VPMB is suitable to detect fully polymorphic worms. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{vulnerability}} of infilled frames represents {{a critical issue}} in many regions with high seismicity around the world where infills are typically made of heavy masonry as they are used for thermal control of the buildings because of their thermal inertia. In this context, the use of earthen masonry infills can give a superior performance because {{of their ability to}} regulate thermal-hygrometric performance of the building and sustainability of its life-cycle. This paper presents a numerical study on the seismic behaviour of infill walls made of earthen masonry and partitioned with horizontal wooden planks that allow the relative <b>sliding</b> of the <b>partitions.</b> The combination of the deformability of earthen masonry and the sliding mechanism occurring along the wooden planks gives a high ductility capacity to the in-plane response of the infill and, at the same time, significantly reduces its stiffness and strength, as compared with traditional solid infills made of fired clay units. As a result, the detrimental interaction with the frame and the damage in the infill when subjected to in-plane loading can be minimized. The numerical model is validated with results from an experimental study and is used to perform a parametric analysis to examine the influence of variations in the geometry and mechanical properties of the infill walls, as well as the configuration of the sliding joints. Based on the findings of this study, design guidelines for practical applications are provided, together with simple formulation for evaluating their performance...|$|R
