5|$|Back at the Eppes house, Charlie and Don {{discuss what}} went wrong. Alan is {{confident}} that the math is correct. Don tells Charlie that if Charlie ran his model on Don, the model will not show Don at his apartment. Instead, it would zone in on his office, where {{he spends most of}} his time. Charlie then realizes that he needs to modify his model to identify two hot zones, one where the <b>suspect</b> possibly resides and one where he possibly works. Using the new equation and a list of potential suspects who work in the new hot zone, Don, Terry, and David confront the <b>suspect</b> and find his latest victim. After Don kills the <b>suspect</b> in a hostage situation, he calls Charlie down to the crime scene to tell Charlie that the <b>suspect</b> lived in the original hot zone but moved three weeks earlier. This revelation proves that Charlie's models are correct.|$|E

5|$|On June 11, {{two days}} after the murder, police arrested their <b>suspect.</b> Hayden {{provided}} a confession and subsequently pleaded guilty in court. Hayden's legal representative, Randolph Williams, urged the judge to show leniency because the <b>suspect</b> had shown remorse for his crime from the moment of his arrest. The judge, Justice Basil Reid, sentenced Hayden to life in prison with the possibility of parole after fifteen years.|$|E

5|$|The Court {{held that}} {{unless and until}} the <b>suspect</b> {{actually}} stated that he was relying on that right, his subsequent voluntary statements {{could be used in}} court and police could continue to interact with (or question) him. The mere act of remaining silent was, on its own, insufficient to imply the <b>suspect</b> has invoked his or her rights. Furthermore, a voluntary reply even after lengthy silence could be construed as implying a waiver.|$|E

50|$|At about 11:30 am on August 26, 2014, law {{enforcement}} authorities arrested two <b>suspects</b> at a service station in Olanchito. The <b>suspects</b> were identified as Carlos Javier Martínez Ponce (28), who {{was believed to be}} the perpetrator, and Marcelino Edilberto Martinez (22), who was <b>suspected</b> of involvement in the crime.

5|$|The {{investigation}} into the fire was led by the Division of Forestry's chief investigator, Sam Butcher. The investigation lasted four months, and once a <b>suspect</b> had been identified, the case {{was turned over to}} the Webster County prosecuting attorney's office. Butcher credited Art Yagel, a Division of Forestry investigator, for bringing the investigation to its conclusion. In January 2008, a 17-year-old <b>suspect</b> from Bergoo was formally charged with a felony count of arson for setting fire to the tree, while a second juvenile was also charged with a misdemeanor for providing false information to investigators. The <b>suspect</b> was also charged with misdemeanor counts of providing false information to conservation officers, possession of marijuana, and underage consumption of alcohol. The second juvenile was not involved in the setting of the fire.|$|E
5|$|The {{main problem}} for American breeders was the {{presence}} of the blood of Lexington in their breeding programs. Lexington's pedigree on his dam's side was <b>suspect</b> in the eyes of British racing authorities, and as he had been the leading sire of racehorses in the United States for 16years, his descendants were numerous. Most American-bred Thoroughbreds traced to Lexington at least once, and he was not the only horse with <b>suspect</b> bloodlines registered in the American Stud Book.|$|E
5|$|The <b>suspect</b> (later {{identified}} as David Lace) was discovered when {{the profile of}} the killer showed a partial match on the national database, which belonged to a sibling of a previous <b>suspect.</b> A further sample was taken from another sibling, who was not on the database, to help confirm the match via a process called familial searching. At first the police refused to release the identity of the new prime <b>suspect,</b> except to reveal that he had committed suicide in 1988, and had confessed to DeSimone's murder while in custody for an unrelated crime in 1983, 18 months after Hodgson's conviction. His body was exhumed at Kingston cemetery in Portsmouth on 12 August 2009 in order to compare his DNA to that found at the crime scene. Hampshire Constabulary said the breakthrough in the case was only possible because of advances in forensic science and tests on the body would take six weeks, after which a file on the dead <b>suspect</b> could then be submitted to the Crown Prosecution Service. Visitors to the cemetery in Portsmouth said the grave of the <b>suspect</b> had no headstone and was untended. Police revealed that the suspect's confession was one of seven which had been made since Hodgson's conviction.|$|E

Spencer notes that seven other individuals have murdered twenty-two people in Franklin in the past six months. Mulder discovers that the LED display in the elevator has been damaged, and that the dead <b>suspect</b> has a green residue on his fingertips.|$|E
5|$|Attitudes {{and social}} {{stereotypes}} can create {{barriers to the}} detection and treatment of alcohol abuse. This {{is more of a}} barrier for women than men. Fear of stigmatization may lead women to deny that they are suffering from a medical condition, to hide their drinking, and to drink alone. This pattern, in turn, leads family, physicians, and others to be less likely to <b>suspect</b> that a woman they know is an alcoholic. In contrast, reduced fear of stigma may lead men to admit that they are suffering from a medical condition, to display their drinking publicly, and to drink in groups. This pattern, in turn, leads family, physicians, and others to be more likely to <b>suspect</b> that a man they know is an alcoholic.|$|E

They <b>suspect</b> {{one or more}} additional mass graves exist in the general area, or that the bodies originally buried at the site were moved to a secondary grave. Nevenka Nekić, the Croatian {{author of a book}} on Nicolier, claims that an additional shallow grave was excavated at Ovčara in November 1991 and that Nicolier and 60 others were buried there. According to her, they were exhumed by Croatian Serb authorities and moved to a secondary location in early 1992 because the grave was so shallow that body parts protruded through the ground surface.|$|E
5|$|Croitoru's {{most famous}} {{encounter}} with the law occurred on January 6, 2005 when {{he was charged with}} the November 16, 1998 murders of Lynn and Fred Gilbank. The couple was shot execution-style with a shotgun. Police <b>suspect</b> that the murders were in response to Lynn Gilbank's assistance in getting William and Angie Smith into a witness protection program after William Smith gave the police information about the Gravelle crime family. Croitoru, who had several contacts within the Gravelle family (including a contract to kill police inspector Rick Wills, who was investigating the Gravelles), was a <b>suspect</b> in the investigation and had his phones tapped during the investigation.|$|E
40|$|The authors {{analyzed}} authentic, videotaped police interviews (N = 27) {{to examine}} how the use of different influencing behaviors by police officers affects the provision of information by <b>suspects.</b> The analysis focused on variations in cue-response patterns across <b>suspects</b> from cultures that tend to use more direct and content-oriented communication (i. e., low-context cultures) and cultures in which communication is typically more indirect and context orientated (i. e., high-context cultures). As expected, rational arguments were more effective in eliciting case-related personal information from low-context <b>suspects</b> than from high-context <b>suspects.</b> Contrary to the authors' expectations, high-context rather than low-context <b>suspects</b> seemed to respond negatively in terms of explicitly refusing to give information to police behavior coded as being kind. Additional analyses considered the effects of two types of intimidating behavior (intimidating the individual vs. the context) across the low-and high-context <b>suspects.</b> Results showed that intimidating the individual was more effective at eliciting case-related personal information from low-context <b>suspects,</b> whereas intimidating the context appeared {{to be more effective}} in eliciting case-related contextual information for high-context <b>suspects...</b>|$|R
