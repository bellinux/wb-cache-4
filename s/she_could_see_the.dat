25|$|Catherine {{agreed to}} a {{commercial}} treaty with Great Britain in 1766, but stopped short of a full military alliance. Although <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> benefits of Britain's friendship, she was wary of Britain's increased power following its victory in the Seven Years' War, which threatened the European balance of power.|$|E
25|$|Black-and-white film in {{that era}} was {{sensitive}} to blue light, not the reds and oranges of hot steel, so <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> beauty, but the photographs were coming out all black. She solved this problem by bringing along a new style of magnesium flare, which produces white light, and having assistants hold them to light her scenes. Her abilities resulted {{in some of the}} best steel factory photographs of that era, which earned her national attention.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the ancient}} designations are still adhered to, in modern Shinto many priests also {{consider}} kami to be anthropomorphic spirits, with nobility and authority. One such {{example is the}} mythological figure Amaterasu-ōmikami, the sun goddess of the Shinto pantheon. Although these kami can be considered deities, they are not necessarily considered omnipotent or omniscient, and like the Greek Gods, they had flawed personalities and were quite capable of ignoble acts. In the myths of Amaterasu, for example, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> events of the human world, but had to use divination rituals to see the future.|$|E
60|$|Joan {{calculated}} {{she must}} have seen a thousand miners {{in less than two}} miles of the gulch, and then <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> up <b>the</b> draws and washes that intersected the slope, and <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> beyond <b>the</b> camp.|$|R
6000|$|... “What’s the matter?” asked Mrs Verloc in a subdued voice. Through {{the door}} left ajar <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that <b>the</b> {{customer}} was not gone yet.|$|R
6000|$|... "Very true," [...] {{observed}} Miss Pritty, with a good-natured smile, {{for even}} <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that <b>the</b> Irishman was {{poking fun at}} her; [...] "but how is air conveyed to him?" ...|$|R
25|$|Gasparotto and Moduco {{would not}} be the only victims of Montefalco's investigations, however, for during late 1581 he had heard of a widow living in Udine named Anna la Rossa. While she did not claim to be a benandante, she did claim that she could see and {{communicate}} with the spirits of the dead, and so Montefalco had her brought in for questioning on 1 January 1582. Initially denying that she had such an ability to the inquisitor, she eventually relented and told him of how she believed that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> dead, and how she sold their messages to members of the local community willing to pay, using the money in order to alleviate the poverty of her family. Although Montefalco intended to interrogate her again at a later date, the trial ultimately remained permanently unfinished.|$|E
25|$|Regina and Robin Hood {{go to the}} {{hospital}} ward to see Zelena. Zelena agrees to help if <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> wand, but needs something meaningful to Emma so the spell will work. She also cannot use her magic unless Regina removes the cuff that is restricting Zelena's magic, so she asks her to remove it. Regina refuses. Later, at Granny's, Hook and Henry formulate a plan to release Zelena. However, their plan backfires, and Zelena breaks free from the cell, after cutting off her hand to remove the magic cuff. Zelena takes Robin captive and trades him for the wand, which she intends to use to return to Oz. As Zelena opens a portal, which {{takes the form of a}} cyclone and substantially drains her powers, Regina takes advantage of Zelena's weakened state to put the cuff back on her wrist, as well as to redirect the portal to take them to the Enchanted Forest, using Emma's blanket to locate her. The cyclone immediately heads towards Granny's diner, and transports everyone in the establishment to the location of Emma's whereabouts.|$|E
25|$|Genie's {{father had}} an {{extremely}} low tolerance for noise, {{to the point}} of refusing to have a working television or radio in the house. He almost never allowed his wife or son to speak and viciously beat them if they did so without permission, particularly forbidding them to speak to or around Genie. Any conversation between them was therefore very quiet and out of Genie's earshot, preventing her from hearing any meaningful amount of language. Her father kept Genie's room extremely dark, and the only available stimuli were the crib, the chair, curtains on each of the windows, three pieces of furniture, and two plastic rain jackets hanging on the wall. On rare occasions her father allowed her to play with plastic food containers, old spools of thread, TV Guides with many of the illustrations cut out, and the raincoats. The room had two almost entirely blacked-out windows, one which her father left slightly open; although the house was well away from the street and other houses, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> side of a neighboring house and a few inches of sky, and occasionally heard environmental sounds or a neighboring child practicing the piano.|$|E
60|$|Then she {{suddenly}} found that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> nothing; <b>the</b> people below were blurred images. A rush of relief {{had come to}} her. She sank into the nearest chair and sobbed.|$|R
60|$|Through {{the open}} door between her room and Frances's <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that <b>the</b> latter's bed was empty. Then she saw a little note, {{addressed}} to her, pinned on the pillow.|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>the</b> {{startled and}} angry {{expression}} of Bince's {{face as he}} received this information. [...] "Torrance was there?" [...] he asked. [...] "How did that happen?" ...|$|R
500|$|The inquest into Davison's death {{took place}} at Epsom on 10 June; Jones was not well enough to attend. Davison's half-brother, Captain Henry Davison, gave {{evidence}} about his sister, saying that she was [...] "a woman of very strong reasoning faculties, and passionately devoted to the women's movement". The coroner decided that, {{in the absence of}} evidence to the contrary, Davison had not committed suicide. The coroner also decided that, although she had waited until <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> horses, [...] "from the evidence {{it was clear that the}} woman did not make for His Majesty's horse in particular". The verdict of the court was: ...|$|E
500|$|... "Spending All My Time" [...] {{received}} favorable {{reviews from}} most music critics. Shenmue {{wrote that the}} new mix for the album “fits the album's concept.” Selective Hearing's writer Nia felt <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> song alongside [...] "Enter the Sphere" [...] and [...] "Party Maker" [...] “blasting in a club, {{but there are also}} some surprisingly calm tracks on the album. It’s kind of like a series of crescendos and decrescendos”. Ian Martin, who had written their extended biography at Allmusic, had highlighted the song as an album standout and career standout. Patrick St. Michael, writing for The Japan Times, said the composition wasn't an “improvement” but commented that it was “simple, catchy pop”. A writer from CDJournal had favored the production and composition, comparing it to Western music.|$|E
500|$|In 1967, Michael Howard, a {{young man}} {{interested}} in witchcraft and the occult wrote to Montalban after reading one of her articles in Prediction; she invited him to visit her at her home. The two became friends, with Montalban believing that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> [...] "Mark of Cain" [...] in his aura. She invited {{him to become a}} student of the ONS, which he duly did. Over the coming year, he spent much of his time with her, and in 1968 they went on what she called a [...] "magical mystery tour" [...] to the West Country, visiting Stonehenge, Boscastle and Tintagel. In 1969, he was initiated into Gardnerian Wicca, something she disapproved of, and their friendship subsequently [...] "hit a stormy period" [...] with the pair going [...] " [...] own ways for several years." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{gave her}} leave,' said Emily. 'Rachel had ordered {{her not to}} climb; and she was crying because <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>the</b> nest that Wat Greenwood had found.' ...|$|R
60|$|Even then Jeanne was reluctant. They {{were on the}} top of the grass-grown dyke now, {{and below}} <b>she</b> <b>could</b> dimly <b>see</b> <b>the</b> dark, {{swelling}} water lapping against the gravel bottom.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>could</b> only <b>see</b> <b>the</b> {{outline of}} his head silhouetted against the wind-tossed sky; <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> his eyes, nor his lips, but she felt his nearness, and the {{happiness}} of that almost caused her to swoon.|$|R
500|$|Lennon {{then started}} taking LSD {{on a regular}} basis, {{as well as his}} daily use of cannabis. After much {{encouragement}} from him, Cynthia agreed to try LSD one more time, but the adverse effects were the same. Although she said at the time she would never take the drug again, she relented and took it for the last time a few weeks later, {{on the way to a}} party at Epstein's country house in Warbleton, East Sussex. Although she hated the psychological effects of the drug, from this point <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> change taking place in her husband: [...] "It was like living with someone who had just discovered religion ... Tensions, bigotry, and bad temper were replaced by understanding and love". In 1970, Lennon confessed he had probably taken LSD one thousand times since 1965, saying: [...] "I used to just eat it all the time". [...] In the decades ahead, Cynthia would always maintain that John's drug use was the beginning of the end for the couple.|$|E
2500|$|West Virginias crew sighted {{the island}} of Iwo Jima at a range of [...] {{on the morning of}} 19 February. When the {{distance}} closed, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> first landings on the island, with ships surrounding the island, shelling the island from all sides. Later on the morning, she received orders from a dispatch boat and within a half-hour she reached her post.|$|E
60|$|Even in the {{children}} before her <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> inherited results of fruitless labor, and, more pitiful yet, in the bent shoulders of the older ones <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> beginnings of deformity that would soon be permanent; and as these thoughts came to her, she clasped the wondering children to her side, with a convulsive wish to make life a little brighter for them.|$|E
60|$|Minnie's heart sank, for <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that <b>the</b> {{thing was}} a small brooch which {{she was in the}} habit of wearing in her neckerchief, and which must have been {{detached}} when Ruby carried her into the cave.|$|R
60|$|She durst look again, and {{saw that}} he had {{scrambled}} up to the boys' perch, and had lifted Adrian up, but there was white spray dashing round now. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>the</b> boat.|$|R
60|$|She {{was in a}} {{fever of}} {{ingenuity}} and painfully conscious, on behalf of her success, that her fever was visible. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> herself <b>see</b> <b>the</b> reflection of it glitter in Mrs. Gereth's sombre eyes.|$|R
60|$|He {{looked at}} her anxiously. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> hysterical little boy under the great, {{authoritative}} man.|$|E
60|$|He hesitated, {{and did not}} reply; but <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> {{admiration for}} her growing in his eyes.|$|E
60|$|He {{came back}} in a few moments so much amazed, that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> whites all round his eyes.|$|E
60|$|That night Mrs. Archibald {{lay awake}} on her straw mattress. Absolute {{darkness}} was about her, but through <b>the</b> open window <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see,</b> over <b>the</b> {{tops of the}} trees {{on the other side of}} the lake, one little star.|$|R
60|$|From this vantage-point, a {{favorite}} one with Lenore, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> all <b>the</b> alfalfa-fields, the hill crowned by the beautiful white-and-red house, the acres of garden, and the miles of orchards. The grazing and grain fields began behind her.|$|R
60|$|Mistress Martha, however, {{suffered}} from deafness. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> from <b>the</b> quick, angry {{turn of the}} head that her lodger was addressing her, but did not catch his words. She drew a little nearer, bending her ear to him.|$|R
60|$|Anne {{heard her}} {{companion}} give a gasp. Even {{in the dusk}} <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> amazement and admiration on his face.|$|E
60|$|Don Ippolito made no answer. He let {{his head}} fall so low upon his breast that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> sacerdotal tonsure.|$|E
60|$|The brook murmured {{below her}} and the birds sang. She heard the bees humming by. The air out here was clear of scent of fruit and hay, and it bore a drier odor, not so sweet. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> workmen, first those among the alfalfa, and then the men, and women, too, bending over on the vegetable-gardens. Likewise <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> gleam of peaches, apples, pears and plums--a {{colorful}} and mixed gleam, delightful to the eye.|$|E
60|$|How {{the time}} sped! It {{seemed as if}} she had only just left the hotel, and already surely not {{a quarter of a mile}} away <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> glimmering <b>the</b> lights of the Place Namur, the half-way point of her walk.|$|R
60|$|At {{this moment}} Sally, who sat where <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> from <b>the</b> window, gave a sudden start {{and a half}} scream, and rising from the table, darted first {{to the window and}} then to the door, whence she rushed out eagerly.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>the</b> {{look upon}} his face, but {{she heard the}} agony in his voice; and, moved with sudden pity, she bent out, threw her arms round his neck, {{and kissed him on}} both cheeks.|$|R
