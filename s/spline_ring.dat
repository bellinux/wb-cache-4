5000|$|The two bombs {{reportedly}} {{used the}} same basic fissile weapon design, but the Mark 11 had a much more modern external casing designed to penetrate further and more reliably into the ground. The Mark 8 had a flat nose, much like a torpedo. The Mark 11 nose was a pointed ogive shape.The MK-11 {{also known as the}} MK-91 had variable yields by changing the target rings. A major difference over the MK-8 was that the MK-91 had an electric operated actuator as a safety device that would rotate a <b>spline</b> <b>ring</b> to prevent the projectile from being fired into the target rings. The MK-8 had no safety devices. Upon release from the delivery aircraft detonation would occur after the black powder fuzes burned 90-110 seconds. The MK-91 was a deep penetrating weapon in many surface materials. A [...] "PHOEBE" [...] polonium initiator increased the nuclear detonation efficiency.|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} second order smooth filling of an n-valent Catmull-Clark <b>spline</b> <b>ring</b> with n biseptic patches. While an underdetermined biseptic {{solution}} to this problem has appeared previously, we make several advances in this paper. Most notably, we cast the problem as a constrained minimization and introduce a novel quadratic energy functional whose absolute minimum of zero is achieved for bicubic polynomials. This means that for the regular 4 -valent case, we reproduce the bicubic B-splines. In other cases, the resulting surfaces are aesthetically well behaved. We extend our constrained minimization framework to handle the case of input mesh with boundary.

40|$|AbstractThe {{structure}} of bivariate spline space over arbitrary triangulation is complicated because {{the dimension of}} a multivariate spline space depends {{not only on the}} topological property of the triangulation but also on its geometric property. A new vertex coding method to a triangulation is introduced in this paper to further study {{structure of}} the spline spaces. The upper bound of the dimension of spline spaces over triangulation given by L. L. Schumaker is slightly improved via the new vertex coding method. The structure of multivariate spline spaces S 21 (▵) and S 31 (▵) over arbitrary triangulation are studied via the method of smoothness cofactor and the structure matrix of multivariate <b>spline</b> <b>ring</b> by Luo and Wang. A kind of sufficient conditions on judging non-singularity of the S 21 (▵) and S 31 (▵) spaces over arbitrary triangulation is given, which only depends on the topological property of the triangulation. From the sufficient conditions, a triangulation strategy is presented {{at the end of the}} paper. The strategy ensures that the constructed triangulation is non-singular (or generic) for S 21 and S 31...|$|E
40|$|We {{introduce}} a non-uniform subdivision algorithm that partitions {{the neighborhood of}} an extraordinary point in the ratio σ: 1 − σ, where σ ∈ (0, 1). We call σ {{the speed of the}} non-uniform subdivision and verify C 1 continuity of the limit surface. For σ = 1 / 2, the Catmull-Clark limit surface is recovered. Other speeds are useful to vary the relative width of the polynomial <b>spline</b> <b>rings</b> generated from extraordinary nodes...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{research}} is to perform the analysis of geometrical form of internal and external teeth of gear rings where external teeth are involute <b>splines.</b> These gear <b>rings</b> are applied in aircraft engineering in planetary gear trains. The authors present a general manufacturing process of gear rings and the measurement results of form deviations. The analysis of manufacturing errors of gear rings is presented - starting with first manufacturing operations and ending with the final product. The influence of these errors on design features of the manufactured product is also shown...|$|R
40|$|Given a graph whose {{edges are}} labeled by ideals in a <b>ring,</b> a {{generalized}} <b>spline</b> is a labeling of each vertex by a ring element so that adjacent vertices differ by {{an element of}} the ideal associated to the edge. We study <b>splines</b> over the <b>ring</b> Z/mZ. Previous work considered splines over domains, in which very different phenomena occur. For instance when the ring is the integers, the elements of bases for spline modules are indexed by the vertices of the graph. However we prove that over Z/mZ spline modules can essentially have any rank between 1 and n. Using the classification of finite Z-modules, we begin the work of classifying splines over Z/mZ and produce minimum generating sets for splines on cycles over Z/mZ. We close with many open questions. Comment: 31 page...|$|R
