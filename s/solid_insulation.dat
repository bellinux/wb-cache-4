50|$|Thermal faults are {{detected}} {{by the presence}} of by-products of <b>solid</b> <b>insulation</b> decomposition. The <b>solid</b> <b>insulation</b> is commonly constructed of cellulose material. The <b>solid</b> <b>insulation</b> breaks down naturally but the rate increases as the temperature of the insulation increases. When an electrical fault occurs it releases energy which breaks the chemical bonds of the insulating fluid. Once the bonds are broken these elements quickly reform the fault gases. The energies and rates at which the gases are formed are different for each of the gases which allows the gas data to be examined to determine the kind of faulting activity taking place within the electrical equipment.|$|E

However much of the existing European building stock has poorly insulated fabric leading to low energy efficiency and high carbon emissions. In the UK we have a particular problem with homes built prior to 1930 with un-insulated solid walls. This paper briefly reviews the multiple barriers to retrofitting <b>solid</b> wall <b>insulation</b> in the UK. It then quantifies the whole life (operational and embodied) carbon of a solid-walled dwelling, first in its original state and then retrofitted with one of four <b>solid</b> wall <b>insulation</b> products. The results show that all of the products modelled repay their cradle to grave embodied energy and carbon costs within 13 months of installation through the operational savings achieved.

40|$|The {{authors would}} like to thank Region Rhones Alpes (France) for {{supporting}} the research stay of Mr N'Cho in CanadaInternational audiencePetroleum based oils, the so-called mineral oils, are used for impregnating <b>solid</b> <b>insulations</b> or filling products of very large number of electric materials： transformers, reactors, cables, bushings, circuit breakers, tap changers, etc. In these equipments, oil is exposed to electrical stress and may experience electrical discharges under certain circumstances. Since the electrical stress is unavoidable in power equipments, the ability of oil to resist decomposition under electrical stress is of great importance for the safety of these devices. Electrical stress together with heat and moisture, in the presence of oxygen, oxidises the oil producing free radicals, acids and sludge that are deleterious to the transformer. In this paper, the effect of electrical discharges on oil properties is reported. The results indicate that quality of oil is considerably affected with increasing voltage stress. Comparing oil properties before and after voltage application allows assessing the outcome of random secondary chemical reactions between large oil born free radicals...|$|R

40|$|Improving {{the thermal}} {{performance}} of existing domestic buildings can have multiple benefits: reducing greenhouse gas emissions, reducing {{the cost of}} heating and therefore fuel poverty, improving comfort and health. Solid wall buildings constitute around 30 % of UK housing stock, and are among the least efficient. However, the installation of <b>solid</b> wall <b>insulation,</b> while improving thermal performance can significantly affect the moisture balance of the building. This can result in mould growth, which can cause structural damage and lead to health problems for the occupants. This thesis explores the use of Natural Fibre Insulation (NFI) materials for internal <b>solid</b> wall <b>insulation.</b> The hygrothermal properties {{of a range of}} NFI materials are characterised in order to assess their potential for retrofit applications. This is followed by large-scale testing, which compares three <b>solid</b> wall <b>insulation</b> systems in controlled conditions, the results of which are used to validate a heat and moisture transfer model to further assess performance. Experimental results showed that the risk of interstitial condensation is significantly reduced by the application of natural fibre insulation in comparison to a conventional rigid foam system. Simulation of a solid wall exposed to climatic conditions for the UK revealed that the relative humidity at the interface between the masonry and insulation layers remained at 69 % when internally insulated with hemp-lime and 96 % with rigid foam insulation, while average moisture content of the masonry was 48 % lower when hemp-lime was used. Field tests were also conducted to determine the thermal performance of two solid walls internally insulated with 80 mm of hemp-lime when exposed to real weather conditions. The thermal conductivity of the hemp-lime was found to be 30 % higher than when measured in dry stead-state laboratory conditions due to the high moisture content of the masonry. However, its application still resulted in 66 % and 68 % reductions in the U-value compared to the uninsulated wall from 2. 73 and 2. 65 W/m 2 K to 0. 93 and 0. 86 W/m 2 K...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Partial {{discharge}} (PD) diagnosis {{for large}} power transformers {{as one of}} the most powerful tools to evaluate insulating quality and characteristics should be carried out as permanent monitoring or onsite measurements with adequate sensitivity. This allows conditioned based maintenance strategies, serves asset appraisements and permits continuous risk assessment. Online/onsite electric PD measuring procedures according to the IEC 60270 standard so far show a limited reachable sensitivity e. g. caused by corona. Since PD also appear as source of mechanical waves in the ultra-sonic range and electromagnetic waves up to the UHF (ultra high frequencies) range additional acoustic or electromagnetic measurements are possible and helpful in online/onsite measurements. Comparative investigations with the acoustic and the UHF method revealed a very moderate damping of the UHF signals in oil and in the <b>solid</b> <b>insulations</b> in contrast to resulting attenuation of the acoustic signals. Thus a significantly higher sensitivity especially for hidden PD defects could be reached with the UHF method. Sensitive electromagnetic UHF PD measurements help to identify and localize faults which are not detectable with acoustic single impulses by simple averaging of the acoustic signals. Furthermore broad-band investigations of UHF spectra revealed cavity resonances which possibly make up the basis for advantageous narrow-band measurements...|$|R
