5000|$|In mathematics, a paracompact <b>space</b> <b>is</b> a topological <b>space</b> {{in which}} every open cover has an open {{refinement}} that is locally finite. These <b>spaces</b> <b>were</b> introduced by [...] Every compact <b>space</b> <b>is</b> paracompact. Every paracompact Hausdorff <b>space</b> <b>is</b> normal, and a Hausdorff <b>space</b> <b>is</b> paracompact {{if and only if}} it admits partitions of unity subordinate to any open cover. Sometimes paracompact <b>spaces</b> <b>are</b> defined so as to always be Hausdorff.|$|R
5000|$|A Gδ <b>space</b> <b>is</b> a topological <b>space</b> {{in which}} every closed set is a Gδ set [...] A normal <b>space</b> which <b>is</b> also a Gδ <b>space</b> <b>is</b> {{perfectly}} normal. Every metrizable <b>space</b> <b>is</b> perfectly normal, and every perfectly normal <b>space</b> <b>is</b> completely normal: neither implication is reversible.|$|R
40|$|Bi-Alexandroff <b>spaces</b> <b>are</b> {{defined as}} {{extensions}} of Alexandroff spaces [1]. Urysohn’s lemma for bi-Alexandroff <b>spaces</b> <b>is</b> used {{to show that}} upper and lower cozero sets of bitopological <b>spaces</b> <b>are</b> bi-Alexandroff <b>spaces.</b> An adjunction between bi-Alexandroff spaces and pairwise completely regular bitopological <b>spaces</b> <b>is</b> established...|$|R
5|$|North American air <b>space</b> <b>was</b> {{closed for}} several days after the attacks and air travel {{decreased}} upon its reopening, leading to a nearly 20% cutback in air travel capacity, and exacerbating financial problems in the struggling U.S. airline industry.|$|E
5|$|On February 11, 2010, a Warhawk {{personal}} <b>space</b> <b>was</b> {{released in}} Home. It includes the Sand Table {{featured in the}} Game Space {{as well as a}} mutliplayer turret mini-game.|$|E
5|$|The company ran {{the complex}} at full {{capacity}} {{until after the}} Second World War; however, in the 1950s, Bass installed new and more efficient pneumatic malting systems at their original Burton-on-Trent plant, making the Sleaford complex redundant and {{paving the way for}} its closure in 1959. Vacant <b>space</b> <b>was</b> let to businesses, but the enormous complex was only ever partially occupied after Bass left. Vulnerable to damage and poorly maintained, fires started in 1969 and 1976, the latter resulting major damage to three of the malthouses. Some of the <b>space</b> <b>was</b> used for chicken-rearing by G. W. Padley (Property) Ltd. from 1973 into the 1990s.|$|E
50|$|Y′CbCr color <b>spaces</b> <b>are</b> {{defined by}} a {{mathematical}} coordinate transformation from an associated RGB color space. If the underlying RGB color <b>space</b> <b>is</b> absolute, the Y′CbCr color <b>space</b> <b>is</b> an absolute color space as well; conversely, if the RGB <b>space</b> <b>is</b> ill-defined, so is Y′CbCr.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe holomorphically ultrabornological <b>spaces</b> <b>are</b> introduced.

5|$|The mid-air {{collision}} involving United Airlines Flight 736, {{and a second}} one a month later over Maryland, between a Capital Airlines airliner and another military jet, accelerated efforts in the United States {{to change the way}} air <b>space</b> <b>was</b> allocated to commercial and military flights.|$|E
5|$|Accommodations {{were even}} more cramped and poorly {{ventilated}} than earlier ships because the ammunition hoists passed through the crew spaces, a problem for ships intended for long-endurance sorties into the North Atlantic. The lack of room in the hull forced a number of workshops and offices into the superstructure which added more weight high in the ship. There were three deckhouses abaft the break in the forecastle with intervals between them to permit the beam torpedo tubes to rotate, but these were no larger than in earlier ships which meant that <b>space</b> <b>was</b> at a premium.|$|E
5|$|As {{the tunnels}} were constructed, they were {{generally}} supported by wooden beams and posts. Once the mine had been finished, the internal <b>space</b> <b>was</b> filled with combustibles, such as brushwood, firewood, resin, and other incendiary substances; once ignited, these would burn the supporting props, causing the mine to collapse, bringing down {{with it the}} structures lying above. From the 15th century, gunpowder was also used, although the aim remained to burn the props.|$|E
25|$|A metric <b>space</b> <b>is</b> {{said to be}} locally compact {{if every}} point has a compact neighborhood. Euclidean <b>spaces</b> <b>are</b> locally compact, but infinite-dimensional Banach <b>spaces</b> <b>are</b> not.|$|R
50|$|Every real (or complex) affine or {{projective}} <b>space</b> <b>is</b> also a topological space. An affine <b>space</b> <b>is</b> a non-compact manifold; a projective <b>space</b> <b>is</b> {{a compact}} manifold.|$|R
50|$|A Riemannian {{manifold}}, or Riemann <b>space,</b> <b>is</b> {{a smooth}} manifold whose tangent <b>spaces</b> <b>are</b> endowed with inner product (satisfying some conditions). Euclidean <b>spaces</b> <b>are</b> also Riemann <b>spaces.</b> Smooth surfaces in Euclidean <b>spaces</b> <b>are</b> Riemann <b>spaces.</b> A hyperbolic non-Euclidean <b>space</b> <b>is</b> also a Riemann space. A curve in a Riemann space has the length. A Riemann <b>space</b> <b>is</b> both a smooth manifold and a metric space; {{the length of}} the shortest curve is the distance. The angle between two curves intersecting at a point is the angle between their tangent lines.|$|R
5|$|By 1944, <b>space</b> <b>was</b> running short, and Monsanto began {{negotiations}} {{to acquire the}} Runnymede Playhouse in the wealthy residential Dayton suburb of Oakwood. Built in 1927, the Playhouse was a leisure facility that included an outdoor swimming pool, a ballroom, a squash court, a tennis court with a cork floor and a stage for community theater. It had showers with Italian marble and a -story garage. The estate was owned by the Talbott Realty Company, which was controlled by Thomas's wife's family. The Talbotts were among the heirs of the Delco company, which was by then a part of General Motors.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} that the Normans conquered England in 1066, the town of Southampton {{occupied}} a rectangular area overlooking the mouth of the River Test, an important medieval waterway. It was protected by water on most sides and by protective ditches and banks to the north and east. Southampton at this time was a relatively large town, but not as significant as in the later medieval period. The Normans built a castle within the town on the site of a probable large English hall, and considerable damage was caused to the surrounding local buildings as <b>space</b> <b>was</b> opened up for the new fortification.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{investment}} in the project by the bank, the developers successfully sought modification of the original planning approval by the Perth City Council to allow {{the use of the}} Palace Hotel as a bank, rather than remaining as a public hotel. With this permission, construction of the development by Multiplex proceeded, and floor <b>space</b> <b>was</b> leased rapidly; by October 1985 only four floors of the building remained for lease and it was expected to be fully let before completion.|$|E
5000|$|... (BCT1) Every {{complete}} metric <b>space</b> <b>is</b> a Baire <b>space.</b> More generally, every topological <b>space</b> which <b>is</b> homeomorphic {{to an open}} {{subset of}} a complete pseudometric <b>space</b> <b>is</b> a Baire <b>space.</b> In particular, every completely metrizable <b>space</b> <b>is</b> a Baire <b>space.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Every paracompact <b>space</b> <b>is</b> metacompact. This {{implies that}} every compact <b>space</b> <b>is</b> metacompact, and every metric <b>space</b> <b>is</b> metacompact. The {{converse}} does not hold: a counter-example is the Dieudonné plank.|$|R
40|$|The {{class of}} θ-compact <b>spaces</b> <b>is</b> {{introduced}} which properly contains {{the class of}} almost compact (generalized absolutely closed) <b>spaces</b> and <b>is</b> strictly contained {{in the class of}} quasicompact spaces. In the realm of almost regular spaces, the class of θ-compact spaces coincides with the class of nearly compact spaces. Moreover, an almost regular θ-compact <b>space</b> <b>is</b> mildly normal (= K-normal). A θ-closed, θ-embedded subset of a θ-compact <b>space</b> <b>is</b> θ-compact and the product of two θ-compact <b>space</b> <b>is</b> θ-compact if one of them is compact. A (strongly) θ-continuous image of a θ-compact <b>space</b> <b>is</b> θ-compact (compact). A <b>space</b> <b>is</b> compact if and only if it is θ-compact and θ-point paracompact...|$|R
5|$|In April 1766 {{parts of}} the town were {{destroyed}} by a fire and the Linnean private collection was subsequently moved to a barn outside the town, and shortly afterwards to a single-room stone building close to his country house at Hammarby near Uppsala. This resulted in a physical separation between the two collections, the museum collection remained in the botanical garden of the university. Some material which needed special care (alcohol specimens) or ample storage <b>space</b> <b>was</b> moved from the private collection to the museum.|$|E
5|$|Inside the Embassy, the {{evacuees}} {{had found}} whatever <b>space</b> <b>was</b> available inside the Embassy compound and evacuees and some staff proceeded to take alcohol from the Embassy's stores. From the billowing incinerator on the Embassy roof floated intelligence documents and US currency, most charred; some not. An Embassy {{official said that}} more than five million dollars were being burned.|$|E
5|$|Inside, the Hatfield Library {{contains}} a 24-hour study area, private study rooms, a classroom, the university's archives, and listening rooms. On {{the main floor}} is the circulation desk, reference section, and work stations, among others. The building also holds a formal reception area, the Mark O. Hatfield Room, and the Hatfield archives that contain the former Senator's papers, both located on the second floor. Interior <b>space</b> <b>was</b> left mainly open to allow for flexibility with the evolving needs and technology of the library. Artist Dean Larson painted the portrait of Hatfield that hangs in the library.|$|E
50|$|A 0-manifold {{is just a}} {{discrete}} <b>space.</b> Such <b>spaces</b> <b>are</b> classified by their cardinality. Every discrete <b>space</b> <b>is</b> paracompact. A discrete <b>space</b> <b>is</b> second-countable {{if and only if}} it is countable.|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{construct}} a pseudocompact meta-Lindelöf <b>space</b> which <b>is</b> not compact. This {{contrasts with the}} results that pseudocompact metacompact <b>spaces</b> <b>are</b> compact (Scott, Forster, Watson) and that pseudocompact para-Lindelöf <b>spaces</b> <b>are</b> compact (Burke, Davis). The <b>space</b> <b>is</b> completely regular and has a point-countable base...|$|R

5|$|Office <b>space</b> <b>was</b> {{initially}} {{found in}} the Monsanto offices at 1515 Nicholas Rd, which became known as Unit I. Unit II was the Monsanto Rocket Propellant works off Betty Lane near Ohio State Route 741. While it was administered by Monsanto, it was not used by the Dayton Project. The site handled explosives including ammonium nitrate and ammonium picrate, but no radioactive materials were handled there. Work at Unit II ceased {{in the fall of}} 1945. Consideration was given to using it in December 1946, but this proposal was rejected in favor of erecting a Quonset hut at Unit III.|$|E
5|$|On September 16, 1999, Hurricane Floyd struck Pennsylvania. Upper Darby Township {{received}} seven {{inches of}} rainfall, causing massive flooding in Darby Creek. Forty-three homes were deemed uninhabitable in Darby and were {{purchased by the}} Borough. They were demolished in 2000 and the open <b>space</b> <b>was</b> converted into John Bartram Memorial Park {{in honor of the}} botanist and Darby native. In Springfield Township, Rolling Green Park was expanded when six homes were ravaged by the hurricane and had to be demolished.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began on}} March 21, 2011, lasted 82 days, {{and had an}} estimated $120–130 million budget. Filming began at Shepperton Studios and Pinewood Studios in England. Scott used eight sound stages for filming, including the 007 Stage. Studio <b>space</b> <b>was</b> limited and the crew had to make five stages work for approximately 16 sets, and increased {{the size of the}} 007 stage by over 30%.|$|E
