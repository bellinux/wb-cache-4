25|$|The {{government}} {{plans to}} reorganise its subsidy system, {{which is a}} heavy burden on government finances. In the short term these subsidies are helping to ease the burden but they cannot keep rising indefinitely, and <b>sooner</b> <b>or</b> <b>later</b> <b>the</b> load {{will have to be}} shared out. In the short term, national consumption per capita is expected to rise from the current level of 0.4 tonnes of oil equivalent (toe) to as much as 0.90 toe in 2030, a good indication of development, but a massive challenge as well. The input of renewable energy is a matter of particular importance.|$|E
25|$|However, {{during the}} 1947 Soviet Aviation Day display at Tushino Airport, a {{surprise}} appearance {{was put in}} by three Boeing B-29s, followed by a fourth four-engined long-range strategic bomber. It {{was an example of}} the Tupolev Tu-4, which was a bolt-for-bolt copy of the B-29 Superfortress, three examples of which were known to have been interned in the Soviet Union after having been forced to land there during bombing raids against Japan in WWII. Since the USSR was expected to have nuclear weapons <b>sooner</b> <b>or</b> <b>later,</b> <b>the</b> appearance of the Soviet Tu-4 was a shock to U.S. military planners, since it meant that the U.S. mainland might soon be vulnerable to a potential Soviet nuclear attack from the air.|$|E

If perjurers testified that a debtor owed a creditor 1,000 zuz due within 30 days, while the debtor says that the debt was due in 10 years, the assessment of the fine is {{made on the basis of}} how much one might be willing to offer for the difference between holding the sum of 1,000 zuz to be repaid in 30 days or in 10 years.|$|E

[...] while one Portuguese official said [...] "This attacking play, {{this is the real}} meaning of football. This is the true game.".

500|$|Instead, Gerry Cooney and Robert Goulet guest starred as themselves. Executive {{producer}} David Mirkin enjoyed directing Goulet {{because he}} was [...] "such a good sport" [...] and had [...] "a great sense of humor". Oakley thought it was nice that Goulet was willing {{to make fun of}} himself in the episode, which at the time was rare for guest stars on The Simpsons. This episode features the first appearances of Gunter and Ernst, the Siegfried and Roy-esque casino magicians who are attacked by their white tiger, Anastasia. Ten years after this episode first aired, Roy Horn was attacked by one of the duo's white tigers. The Simpsons production team dismissed the novelty of the prediction by saying that it was [...] "bound to happen" [...] <b>sooner</b> <b>or</b> <b>later.</b> <b>The</b> Rich Texan also makes his debut appearance in this episode, referred to as [...] "Senator" [...] by Homer.|$|E
500|$|A {{reviewer}} from The Hindu noted, [...] "The film {{takes off}} as a typical family drama. The {{first half of the}} film is intentionally slow-paced and shows to the audience the lighter moments in the family of Georgekutty. This half combines the elements of drama and comedy genres. The audience gets completely absorbed in the twist of events that begin to unfold {{from the end of the}} first half. The second half is more like a thriller and is about how the family, despite the vengeful villainy of a corrupt cop, stands its ground even as the law takes its course." [...] When asked whether this change in narrative style post-interval was intentional, Jeethu replied: [...] "I really don't understand when people say the first half lacked pace. A story or a film has its own way of progression and it does travel in a zig-zag away, capturing all the ups and downs of our lives. Right from the start if you accelerate the pace, <b>sooner</b> <b>or</b> <b>later,</b> <b>the</b> story-telling will lose its steam." ...|$|E

2500|$|Italy's {{participation}} in the war, governed by the Treaty of London, {{eventually led to the}} Agreement of Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne in April 1917; at this conference, Lloyd George had raised the question of a British protectorate of Palestine and the idea [...] "had been very coldly received" [...] by the French and the Italians. The War Cabinet, reviewing this conference on 25 April, [...] "inclined to the view that <b>sooner</b> <b>or</b> <b>later</b> <b>the</b> Sykesâ€“Picot Agreement might have to be reconsidered ...

2500|$|By 1915, Americans {{were paying}} much more {{attention}} to the war. The sinking of the Lusitania aroused furious denunciations of German brutality. By 1915, in Eastern cities a new [...] "Preparedness" [...] movement emerged. It argued that the United States needed to build up immediately strong naval and land forces for defensive purposes; an unspoken assumption was that America would fight <b>sooner</b> <b>or</b> <b>later.</b> <b>The</b> driving forces behind Preparedness were all Republicans, notably General Leonard Wood, ex-president Theodore Roosevelt, and former secretaries of war Elihu Root and Henry Stimson; they enlisted many of the nation's most prominent bankers, industrialists, lawyers and scions of prominent families. Indeed, there emerged an [...] "Atlanticist" [...] foreign policy establishment, a group of influential Americans drawn primarily from upper-class lawyers, bankers, academics, and politicians of the Northeast, committed to a strand of Anglophile internationalism.|$|E

In 1985 Nakasone {{appointed}} the former governor of the Bank of Japan, Haruo Maekawa, to head a commission on Japan's economic future. In 1986 the Commission recommended that Japan should grow not through exports (which were angering Japan's trading partners) but from within. Nakasone advised the Japanese public to purchase foreign imports; in a well publicised shopping trip, he bought an American tennis racket, an Italian tie and a French shirt. He said [...] "Japan is like a mah-jong player who always wins. <b>Sooner</b> <b>or</b> <b>later</b> <b>the</b> other players will decide that {{they do not want to}} play with him". The Japanese public were sceptical but the Commission created a good impression abroad, especially in America, where the Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs W. Allen Wallis called it a watershed in Japan's postwar economic policy.|$|E

2500|$|Many of Winnicott's {{writings}} {{show his}} efforts to understand what helps {{people to be able}} to play, and on the other hand what blocks some people from playing. Babies can be playful when they're cared for by people who respond to them warmly and playfully, like a mother who smiles and says, [...] "Peek-a-boo!" [...] when she sees her baby playfully peeking out from behind his hands. If the mother never responded playfully, <b>sooner</b> <b>or</b> <b>later</b> <b>the</b> baby would stop trying to elicit play from her. [...] Indeed, Winnicott came to consider that [...] "Playing takes place in the potential space between the baby and the mother-figure....he initiation of playing is associated with the life experience of the baby who has come to trust the mother figure". [...] "Potential space" [...] was Winnicott's term for a sense of an inviting and safe interpersonal field in which one can be spontaneously playful while at the same time connected to others (again a concept that has been extrapolated to the practice of analysis).|$|E
2500|$|Norton {{was given}} the motivational book Think and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill, which, as he states in his autobiography, Going the Distance, changed his life. Shortly before he died, Norton stated [...] "Think and Grow Rich changed my life dramatically. I was going to fight Muhammad Ali. I was a green fighter, but yet I won, all through reading this book." [...] Upon reading Think and Grow Rich, he went on a 14-fight winning streak, {{including}} the shocking victory noted above over Muhammad Ali in 1973 to win the North American Boxing Federation heavyweight champion title. To quote Norton from his autobiography noted above, [...] "These words (from Napoleon Hill's Think and Grow Rich) were the final inspiration in my victory over Ali: Life's battles don't always go to the stronger or faster man, but <b>sooner</b> <b>or</b> <b>later</b> <b>the</b> man who wins {{is the man who}} thinks he can."
