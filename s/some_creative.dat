500|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1968, Van Morrison became involved in a contract dispute with Bang Records that kept him away from any recording activity. [...] This occurred after {{the sudden death of}} the label's founder Bert Berns. Born with a congenital heart defect, Berns had a fatal heart attack and was discovered dead in a New York hotel room on 30 December 1967. Prior to Berns' death, he and Morrison had experienced <b>some</b> <b>creative</b> difficulties. Berns had been pushing Morrison towards a more pop-oriented direction, while Morrison wanted to explore newer musical terrain. As a result, Berns' widow, Ilene Berns, held Morrison and this conflict responsible for her husband's death. Years later she would downplay this scenario but Morrison's ex-wife Janet (Planet) Rigsbee Minto has gone on record describing her initial subsequent vindictiveness towards Morrison.|$|E
500|$|The writers {{say that}} {{they did not want to}} force modernity onto the story. There were <b>some</b> <b>creative</b> challenges, such as the {{decision}} to include the sign [...] "221B" [...] on Holmes' front door. Gatiss and Moffat reflect that in the modern world the door would only display the number of the house, and there would be doorbells for each flat. The full house number is so iconic that they felt unable to change it. The writers also decided that the lead characters would address each other by their first names, rather than the traditional Holmes and Watson. This was also reflected in the title of the series. Director Paul McGuigan came up with the idea of putting text messages on the screen instead of having cut-away shots of a hand holding the phone.|$|E
500|$|Before the volva opens, the fruiting body is egg-shaped {{to roughly}} spherical, up to [...] in diameter, with a {{gelatinous}} interior up to [...] thick. White to grayish in color, it is initially smooth, but develops {{a network of}} polygonal marks on the surface prior to opening as the internal structures expand and stretch the peridium taut. The fruit body, or receptacle, bursts the egg open as it expands (a process that can take {{as little as a}} few hours), and leaves the remains of the peridium as a cup or volva surrounding the base. The receptacle ranges in color from red to bright pink to pale orange, and it is often lighter in color approaching the base. The color appears to be dependent upon the temperature and humidity of the environment. The receptacle consists of a spongy network of [...] "arms" [...] interlaced to make meshes of unequal size. At the top of the receptacle, the arms are up to [...] thick, but they taper down to smaller widths near the base. A cross-section of the arm reveals it to be spongy, and made up of one wide inner tube and two indistinct rows of tubes towards the outside. The outer surface of the receptacle is ribbed or wrinkled. There are between 80 and 120 mesh holes in the receptacle. The unusual shape of the receptacle has inspired <b>some</b> <b>creative</b> comparisons: David Arora likened it to a whiffleball, while the German Mycological Society—who named C.ruber the 2011 [...] "Mushroom of the Year"—described it as [...] "like an alien from a science fiction horror film".|$|E

500|$|Mani Ratnam handled screenplays for a {{majority}} of his films. Lauded for his casting in each of his films, he claimed in an interview that [...] "I am not a director who performs and shows. I discuss the role, the scene with my actors and let them bring life to it". Right from the beginning of his career, his works were noted for their technical expertise in areas such as cinematography, art direction, editing and background score. For his debut film, he managed to handpick Balu Mahendra, Thotta Tharani, B. Lenin, and Ilaiyaraaja, leading craftsmen in their respective fields. As his career progressed, he worked with his childhood friend P. C. Sreeram and continued his collaborations with him until Geethanjali. In 1991 for his film Thalapathi, he chose Santosh Sivan and Suresh Urs—both newcomers to the Tamil film industry—to do cinematography and editing respectively. Both would later go onto become a part of his regular crew. While working on Raavan, Santosh Sivan noted [...] "any cameraman can hone his skills just working with [...] " [...] and described Mani Ratnam's films as difficult to film. From his debut project till Thalapathi, Ilaiyaraaja was his regular composer. The duo split due to <b>some</b> <b>creative</b> differences after the film. For his next film Roja (1992), he collaborated with debutant A. R. Rahman, who has been his regular composer for all his films till date. He has also worked with Rajiv Menon and Ravi K. Chandran, while switching between Sreeram and Santosh Sivan. Since Alaipayuthey, Sreekar Prasad has been his regular film editor.. Mani ratnam has always been very choosy when coming to casting actors for his films picking most of them from theatre background. All of his films are dubbed into telugu as most of them were well received. It’s a well known fact mani is reluctant to cast telugu actors in his films owing to their stereotypes in acting skills.|$|E
