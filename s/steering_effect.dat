Good handling needs good control on <b>steering</b> <b>effects.</b> These effects can both be unwanted like brake and bump steering or wanted like understeering. Methods used at Volvo have changed by time from simple geometry sketches and knowledge from test-driving studies to analysis on non-linear FE-models. The department for front suspension and steering at Volvo 3 P has developed a non-linear FE model for virtual testing of the front suspension and <b>steering.</b> <b>Steering</b> <b>effects</b> considered in this report are bump, brake and roll steering, with the main emphasis on the last mentioned that has not been previously modeled. The aim of this thesis is to enhance knowledge of <b>steering</b> <b>effects</b> phenomena at Volvo 3 P through in-dept studies of output from a complemented and improved modeling of the front suspension <b>steering</b> <b>effects,</b> and to map parameters influence on induced steer angle due to bump, brake and roll load cases. Our approach has been to develop and enhance the load cases of the considered <b>steering</b> <b>effects.</b> The load case representing roll has been broken down into separate parts {{in order to make the}} analysis easier. The in-dept analysis of the load cases then gave us a foundation to choose the parameters of the front suspension to be included in the parameter study. The parameter study was then executed with the help of several UNIX, Python and Matlab scripts. The outcome of the <b>steering</b> <b>effects</b> study showed some not well known phenomena, such as twist of the axle beam. The result from the parameter study confirmed the result from the study of <b>steering</b> <b>effects</b> and gave a good picture of the influence of parameter changes. Our conclusion is that modeling of load cases is crucial to get a trustworthy output and that an advanced FE model such as the present is necessary...|$|R

40|$|Ion <b>steering</b> <b>effects</b> in the {{interface}} of heterostructures can strongly influence the shape and position of angular channelling scans leading to considerable error in the determination of strain by ion channelling. As an example, this paper presents channelling measurements on a near-lattice-matched AlGaInN/GaN heterostructure which show no shift between the angular scans from the quaternary layer and the underlying GaN substrate although high resolution x-ray diffraction data confirm the presence of strain in the layer. Such ‘anomalous’ behaviour was studied by means of Monte Carlo simulations for nitride ternary and quaternary films in the whole composition range. The simulations show that the thickness, magnitude of the distortion of the strained lattice and energy of the probing beam are critical parameters controlling the impact of steering. Three composition/strain regions were established for a typical beam of 2 MeV alpha particles corresponding to different intensities of the steering potential and in which strain measurements by ion channelling are (a) correct, (b) possible but require corrections and (c) not possible due to <b>steering</b> <b>effects...</b>|$|R

The study, which had mostly method-testing aims, provided, anyway, valuable information about the collision kinetics of gas-phase molecular hydrogen. This was treated as an impacting projectile having different kinetic energy values. At lower kinetic energies, sticking was ruled by <b>steering</b> <b>effects</b> imputable to the Pd cluster that easily reoriented the incoming hydrogen molecule to the metallic surface sites, favoring fragmentation hence adsorption.

5000|$|The {{steering}} {{characteristics of}} jet boats (including personal watercraft) {{when they are}} [...] "off throttle" [...] seem to differ from conventional steering. All recreational planing boats steer with thrust. Jet boats (including PWCs) generate that thrust with a moveable nozzle connected to a jet pump; propeller boats generate thrust through a downward-placed, exposed propeller. The fact that the propeller is placed downward {{in the water and}} is exposed means that even when it is not generating thrust that some amount of <b>steering</b> <b>effect</b> is possible. Jet boats have no downward projection, and achieve no additional <b>steering</b> <b>effect</b> from the device. If the operator of a jet boat releases the throttle, steering effectiveness decreases roughly in proportion to thrust reduction.

5000|$|Conicity is a {{parameter}} {{based on}} lateral force behavior. It is the characteristic {{that describes the}} tire’s tendency to roll like a cone.

Conicity is calculated as one-half the difference of the values, {{keeping in mind that}} CW and CCW values have opposite signs. Conicity is an important parameter in production testing. In many high-performance cars, tires with equal conicity are mounted on left and right sides of the car in order that their conicity effects will cancel each other and generate a smoother ride performance, with little <b>steering</b> <b>effect.</b> This necessitates the tire maker measuring conicity and sorting tires into groups of like-values.|$|E

50|$|As a {{consequence}} of the radius arm forward attachments not being on the axis of the lower link arm inner pivots, it would appear at first glance that free movement of the suspension would be impossible without some components bending, or the trailing arm elastomeric bushes being compressed unduly. However, as described above, the crossbeam is rubber mounted to the body. The crossbeam and lower links maintain the correct toe angle of one wheel relative to the other, however due to the relative angles of the trailing radius arms, body roll results in the entire cross-beam and lower links pivoting slightly about the crossbeam's mounting points, thus inducing a small amount of passive rear wheel steering, which may result in significantly improved handling. When the Jaguar components are re-used in other vehicles, the differential is often rigidly mounted to the chassis, different radius arm configurations are used, and the passive rear wheel <b>steering</b> <b>effect</b> is lost.|$|E
50|$|The 2005 and 2006 system {{normally}} sends 70% {{of power}} to the front wheels and 30% to the rear under normal conditions but these ratios can reverse according to dynamic driving conditions. The 2007-2008 brochures specification sections indicate that this ratio changed to 80%-20%, and vice versa. The system can work because the clutches can slip under circumstances where the vehicle is turning, thus allowing the rear and front wheels to turn at different rates around a curve. As noted above, the SH-AWD can take 100% of the power shunted through the rear differentials and variably direct power to each wheel, up to 100% of that power to the outside rear wheel. Adding power to the outside rear wheel on a turn has a <b>steering</b> <b>effect</b> on the vehicle which can greatly improve vehicle handling dynamics through the reduction of oversteer and more balanced handling. In limited situations, the vehicle may exhibit power oversteer, characteristic of more sporty rear-wheel-drive vehicles.|$|E
50|$|When {{driving in}} a {{straight}} line the two engines were locked; turning the steering wheel gradually closed the throttle for the engine of one track and opened the throttle for the engine driving the other. The two engines were joined at their cross-shafts, from which the final drive to the tracks was by chains to sprockets on either side. When steering the clutches joining the cross-shafts were released, one engine sped up while the other slowed down, the turn being on the side opposite to that of the faster running engine. The <b>steering</b> <b>effect</b> could be increased by use of the brakes on one engine or another. This arrangement had the advantage over that of earlier tanks of being controlled by one man only, but called for great skill {{on the part of the}} driver, because one or both of the engines could be stalled if care was not exercised. Although in theory a simple solution to give gradual steering, in practice it proved impossible to control the speeds of the engines, causing the vehicle to take an unpredictable path. Drivers grew wary and stopped the vehicle and locked one track before every turn; this caused many track breaks, as the movement became too abrupt.|$|E

5000|$|The dynamic {{behaviour}} of the wagons was the problem, but the solution adopted was {{to reduce the}} permitted speed of the wagons to 45 mph, and to reduce the track gauge by one-eighth of an inch, to 4 ft 8⅜in (1432mm) for new installations of continuously welded track on concrete sleepers. Of course the long life cycle of the track meant that this conversion process would take 30 years or more to complete. However, {{the basis of the}} gauge narrowing was mistaken. The idea seems to have been to reduce the free space for lateral movement of the wagons, so that they would be [...] "contained" [...] to run in a straight line. In fact, railway vehicles are not contained by the flanges of the wheels except in very sharp curves, and in normal running the <b>steering</b> <b>effect</b> due to the conicity of the wheels is dominant. In reducing the track gauge, the effective conicity is increased - worsened - and the tendency of the wagons to yaw and roll was increased.

The RL can direct up to 70% of available torque to the rear wheels, and up to 100% of that available rear torque can be directed to just one wheel. In combination with a specially designed planetary gear set which can over-drive the rear wheels at up to 5% greater speed than the front wheels, the torque directed to one wheel, or torque vectoring, can have a <b>steering</b> <b>effect.</b> As the car speeds around a curve, torque vectored to the outside rear wheel will push the rear end around the curve faster, just as paddling the outside oar of a row boat faster than the inside oar will cause the row boat to turn, to minimize the understeer common in front-heavy vehicles.|$|E

We find three characteristic features of the surface morphology developed by grazing angle deposition: (1) enhanced surface roughness, (2) asymmetric mound, and (3) asymmetric slopes of mound sides. Regarding their dependence on both deposition angle and substrate temperature, a reasonable agreement of the simulated results with the previous experimental ones is found. The characteristic growth features by grazing angle deposition are mainly caused by the inhomogeneous deposition flux due to the <b>steering</b> and screening <b>effects,</b> where the <b>steering</b> <b>effects</b> play the major role rather than the screening effects. Newly observed in the present simulation is that the side of mound in each direction is composed of various facets instead of all being in one selected mound angle even if the slope selection is attained, and that the slope selection does not necessarily mean the facet selection.
