5|$|Fossil {{evidence}} indicates the <b>sea</b> <b>otter</b> (Enhydra) lineage became {{isolated in the}} North Pacific approximately two mya, giving rise to the now-extinct †Enhydra macrodonta and the modern <b>sea</b> <b>otter,</b> Enhydra lutris. The <b>sea</b> <b>otter</b> evolved initially in northern Hokkaidō and Russia, and then spread east to the Aleutian Islands, mainland Alaska, and down the North American coast. In comparison to cetaceans, sirenians, and pinnipeds, which entered the water approximately 50, 40, and 20 mya, respectively, the <b>sea</b> <b>otter</b> is a relative newcomer to marine life. In some respects though, the <b>sea</b> <b>otter</b> is more fully adapted to water than pinnipeds, which must haul out on land or ice to give birth.|$|E
5|$|The {{most recent}} {{sighting}} of a <b>sea</b> <b>otter</b> off the Oregon coast {{took place on}} 18 February 2009, in Depoe Bay, Oregon. The lone male <b>sea</b> <b>otter</b> could have traveled from either California or Washington.|$|E
5|$|For many {{maritime}} indigenous cultures {{throughout the}} North Pacific, especially the Ainu in the Kuril Islands, the Koryaks and Itelmen of Kamchatka, the Aleut in the Aleutian Islands, the Haida of Haida Gwaii {{and a host}} of tribes on the Pacific coast of North America, the <b>sea</b> <b>otter</b> has played an important role as a cultural, as well as material, resource. In these cultures, many of which have strongly animist traditions full of legends and stories in which many aspects of the natural world are associated with spirits, the <b>sea</b> <b>otter</b> was considered particularly kin to humans. The Nuu-chah-nulth, Haida, and other First Nations of coastal British Columbia used the warm and luxurious pelts as chiefs' regalia. <b>Sea</b> <b>otter</b> pelts were given in potlatches to mark coming-of-age ceremonies, weddings, and funerals. The Aleuts carved <b>sea</b> <b>otter</b> bones for use as ornaments and in games, and used powdered <b>sea</b> <b>otter</b> baculum as a medicine for fever.|$|E
50|$|The IUCN {{describes}} the significant threats to <b>sea</b> <b>otters</b> as oil pollution, predation by orcas, poaching, and conflicts with fisheries. <b>Sea</b> <b>otters</b> can drown if entangled in fishing gear. They {{can also be}} stressed by well-meaning human watchers who approach too closely. The most significant threat to <b>sea</b> <b>otters</b> is oil spills. <b>Sea</b> <b>otters</b> are particularly vulnerable, as they rely on their fur to keep warm. When their fur is soaked with oil, it loses its ability to retain air, and the animal quickly dies from hypothermia. The liver, kidneys, and lungs of <b>sea</b> <b>otters</b> also become damaged after they inhale oil or ingest it when grooming.|$|R
50|$|James, John's brother, {{stated in}} his class report that <b>sea</b> <b>otters</b> were fish. James got an F after his teacher pointed out why that {{statement}} was false. James {{did not know that}} <b>sea</b> <b>otters</b> were in fact mammals because he heard that <b>sea</b> <b>otters</b> were fish from his older brother John, a marine biologist.|$|R

5|$|Since the mid-1970s, {{the beauty}} and {{charisma}} of the species have gained wide appreciation, and the <b>sea</b> <b>otter</b> has become an icon of environmental conservation. The round, expressive face and soft, furry body of the <b>sea</b> <b>otter</b> are depicted {{in a wide variety}} of souvenirs, postcards, clothing, and stuffed toys.|$|E
5|$|The most {{profitable}} furs in the fur trade {{were those of}} sea otters, especially the northern <b>sea</b> <b>otter</b> which inhabited the coastal waters between the Columbia River {{to the south and}} Cook Inlet to the north. The fur of the Californian southern <b>sea</b> <b>otter</b> was less highly prized and thus less profitable. After the northern <b>sea</b> <b>otter</b> was hunted to local extinction, maritime fur traders shifted to California until the southern <b>sea</b> <b>otter</b> was likewise nearly extinct. The British and American maritime fur traders took their furs to the Chinese port of Guangzhou (Canton), where they worked within the established Canton System. Furs from Russian America were mostly sold to China via the Mongolian trading town of Kyakhta, which had been opened to Russian trade by the 1727 Treaty of Kyakhta.|$|E
5|$|The <b>sea</b> <b>otter</b> (Enhydra lutris) is {{a marine}} mammal {{native to the}} coasts of the {{northern}} and eastern North Pacific Ocean. Adult sea otters typically weigh between , making them the heaviest members of the weasel family, but among the smallest marine mammals. Unlike most marine mammals, the sea otter's primary form of insulation is an exceptionally thick coat of fur, the densest in the animal kingdom. Although it can walk on land, the <b>sea</b> <b>otter</b> lives mostly in the ocean.|$|E
5|$|Although each {{adult and}} {{independent}} juvenile forages alone, <b>sea</b> <b>otters</b> tend to rest together in single-sex groups called rafts. A raft typically contains 10 to 100 animals, with male rafts being larger than female ones. The largest raft ever seen contained over 2000 <b>sea</b> <b>otters.</b> To keep from drifting {{out to sea}} when resting and eating, <b>sea</b> <b>otters</b> may wrap themselves in kelp.|$|R
5|$|The {{historic}} {{population of}} California <b>sea</b> <b>otters</b> {{was estimated at}} 16,000 before the fur trade began. California's <b>sea</b> <b>otters</b> are the descendants of a single colony of about 50 southern <b>sea</b> <b>otters</b> discovered near Bixby Bridge in Big Sur in 1938. Their principal range has gradually expanded and extends from Pigeon Point in San Mateo County to Santa Barbara County.|$|R

5|$|Alaska is {{the heartland}} of the sea otter's range. In 1973, the {{population}} in Alaska was estimated at between 100,000 and 125,000 animals. By 2006, though, the Alaska population had fallen to an estimated 73,000 animals. A massive decline in <b>sea</b> <b>otter</b> populations in the Aleutian Islands accounts {{for most of the}} change; the cause of this decline is not known, although orca predation is suspected. The <b>sea</b> <b>otter</b> population in Prince William Sound was also hit hard by the Exxon Valdez oil spill, which killed thousands of sea otters in 1989.|$|E
5|$|Among the Ainu, the otter {{is portrayed}} as an {{occasional}} messenger between humans and the creator. The <b>sea</b> <b>otter</b> is a recurring figure in Ainu folklore. A major Ainu epic, the Kutune Shirka, tells the tale of wars and struggles over a golden <b>sea</b> <b>otter.</b> Versions of a widespread Aleut legend tell of lovers or despairing women who plunge into the sea and become otters. These links {{have been associated with}} the many human-like behavioral features of the <b>sea</b> <b>otter,</b> including apparent playfulness, strong mother-pup bonds and tool use, yielding to ready anthropomorphism. The beginning of commercial exploitation had a great impact on the human, as well as animal, populations the Ainu and Aleuts have been displaced or their numbers are dwindling, while the coastal tribes of North America, where the otter is in any case greatly depleted, no longer rely as intimately on sea mammals for survival.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, a lone male <b>sea</b> <b>otter</b> took up {{residence}} at Simpson Reef off of Cape Arago for six months. This male {{is thought to have}} originated from a colony in Washington, but disappeared after a coastal storm.|$|E

25|$|In Pacific kelp forests, <b>sea</b> <b>otters</b> feed on <b>sea</b> urchins. In {{areas where}} <b>sea</b> <b>otters</b> have been hunted to extinction, sea urchins {{increase}} in abundance and kelp populations are reduced.|$|R
5|$|In Washington, <b>sea</b> <b>otters</b> {{are found}} almost {{exclusively}} on the outer coasts. They can swim as close as six feet off shore along the Olympic coast. Reported sightings of <b>sea</b> <b>otters</b> in the San Juan Islands and Puget Sound almost always {{turn out to be}} North American river otters, which are commonly seen along the seashore. However, biologists have confirmed isolated sightings of <b>sea</b> <b>otters</b> in these areas since the mid-1990s.|$|R
5|$|In a few {{northern}} areas, {{fish are}} also eaten. In studies performed at Amchitka Island in the 1960s, where the <b>sea</b> <b>otter</b> population was at carrying capacity, 50% of food found in <b>sea</b> <b>otter</b> stomachs was fish. The fish species were usually bottom-dwelling and sedentary or sluggish forms, such as Hemilepidotus hemilepidotus and family Tetraodontidae. However, south of Alaska on the North American coast, fish are a negligible or extremely minor {{part of the}} sea otter's diet. Contrary to popular depictions, sea otters rarely eat starfish, and any kelp that is consumed apparently passes through the sea otter's system undigested.|$|E
5|$|Sea otters, whose {{numbers were}} once {{estimated}} at 150,000–300,000, were hunted extensively for their fur between 1741 and 1911, {{and the world}} population fell to 1,000–2,000 individuals living in a fraction of their historic range. A subsequent international ban on hunting, conservation efforts, and reintroduction programs into previously populated areas have contributed to numbers rebounding, and the species now occupies about two-thirds of its former range. The recovery of the <b>sea</b> <b>otter</b> is considered an important success in marine conservation, although populations in the Aleutian Islands and California have recently declined or have plateaued at depressed levels. For these reasons, the <b>sea</b> <b>otter</b> remains classified as an endangered species.|$|E
5|$|The <b>sea</b> <b>otter</b> hunts {{in short}} dives, often {{to the sea}} floor. Although it can hold its breath {{for up to five}} minutes, its dives {{typically}} last about one minute and no more than four. It is the only marine animal capable of lifting and turning over rocks, which it often does with its front paws when searching for prey. The <b>sea</b> <b>otter</b> may also pluck snails and other organisms from kelp and dig deep into underwater mud for clams. It is the only marine mammal that catches fish with its forepaws rather than with its teeth.|$|E
50|$|In 1911, {{when only}} one {{small group of}} 32 <b>sea</b> <b>otters</b> survived in a remote cove, an {{international}} treaty was signed to prevent further exploitation of the <b>sea</b> <b>otters.</b> Under heavy protection, the otters multiplied and repopulated the depleted areas, which slowly recovered. More recently, with declining numbers of fish stocks, again due to overexploitation, killer whales have experienced a food shortage and have been observed feeding on <b>sea</b> <b>otters,</b> again reducing their numbers.|$|R
5|$|There {{are several}} {{documented}} {{cases in which}} male <b>sea</b> <b>otters</b> have forcibly copulated with juvenile harbor seals, sometimes resulting in death. Similarly, forced copulation by <b>Sea</b> <b>Otters</b> involving animals other than Pacific Harbor Seals has occasionally been reported.|$|R
50|$|Predators of {{this species}} other than mankind are <b>sea</b> <b>otters,</b> <b>sea</b> stars, large fish, and octopus.|$|R
5|$|The <b>sea</b> <b>otter</b> is diurnal. It has {{a period}} of {{foraging}} and eating in the morning, starting {{about an hour before}} sunrise, then rests or sleeps in mid-day. Foraging resumes for a few hours in the afternoon and subsides before sunset, and a third foraging period may occur around midnight. Females with pups appear to be more inclined to feed at night. Observations of the amount of time a <b>sea</b> <b>otter</b> must spend each day foraging range from 24 to 60%, apparently depending on the availability of food in the area.|$|E
5|$|The small {{geographic}} {{ranges of}} the <b>sea</b> <b>otter</b> populations in California, Washington, and British Columbia mean a single major spill could be catastrophic for that state or province. Prevention of oil spills and preparation to rescue otters if one happens {{is a major}} focus for conservation efforts. Increasing the size and range of <b>sea</b> <b>otter</b> populations would also {{reduce the risk of}} an oil spill wiping out a population. However, because of the species' reputation for depleting shellfish resources, advocates for commercial, recreational, and subsistence shellfish harvesting have often opposed allowing the sea otter's range to increase, and there have even been instances of fishermen and others illegally killing them.|$|E

40|$|A recent {{series of}} studies on tagged <b>sea</b> <b>otters</b> (Enhydra lutris nereis) {{challenges}} the hypothesis that <b>sea</b> <b>otters</b> are sentinels of a dirty ocean, in particular, that pet cats are {{the main source of}} exposure to Toxoplasma gondii in central California. Counter to expectations, <b>sea</b> <b>otters</b> from unpopulated stretches of coastline are less healthy and more exposed to parasites than city-associated otters. Ironically, now it seems that spillover from wildlife, not pets, dominates spatial patterns of disease transmission...|$|R
5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, the USFWS {{relocated}} about 140 Californian <b>sea</b> <b>otters</b> to San Nicolas Island (SNI) in southern California, {{in the hope}} of establishing a reserve population should the mainland be struck by an oil spill. To the surprise of biologists, the San Nicolas <b>sea</b> <b>otters</b> mostly swam back to the mainland. By 2005, only 30 <b>sea</b> <b>otters</b> remained at San Nicolas, although they were slowly increasing as they thrived on the abundant prey around the island. The plan that authorized the translocation program had predicted the carrying capacity would be reached within five to 10 years. The spring 2016 SNI count was 104 <b>sea</b> <b>otters,</b> continuing a 5-year positive trend of over 12% per year.|$|R
5|$|Many {{facets of}} the {{interaction}} between <b>sea</b> <b>otters</b> and the human economy are not as immediately felt. <b>Sea</b> <b>otters</b> have been credited with contributing to the kelp harvesting industry via their well-known role in controlling sea urchin populations; kelp is used in the production of diverse food and pharmaceutical products. Although human divers harvest red sea urchins both for food and to protect the kelp, <b>sea</b> <b>otters</b> hunt more <b>sea</b> urchin species and are more consistently effective in controlling these populations. The health of the kelp forest ecosystem is significant in nurturing populations of fish, including commercially important fish species. In some areas, <b>sea</b> <b>otters</b> are popular tourist attractions, bringing visitors to local hotels, restaurants, and sea otter-watching expeditions.|$|R
5|$|Under each foreleg, the <b>sea</b> <b>otter</b> has a loose pouch of {{skin that}} extends across the chest. In this pouch (preferentially the left one), the animal stores {{collected}} food {{to bring to}} the surface. This pouch also holds a rock, unique to the otter, that is used to break open shellfish and clams. There, the <b>sea</b> <b>otter</b> eats while floating on its back, using its forepaws to tear food apart and bring it to its mouth. It can chew and swallow small mussels with their shells, whereas large mussel shells may be twisted apart. It uses its lower incisor teeth to access the meat in shellfish.|$|E
5|$|During the 20th century, <b>sea</b> <b>otter</b> numbers rebounded {{in about}} two-thirds of their {{historic}} range, a recovery {{considered one of the}} greatest successes in marine conservation. However, the IUCN still lists the <b>sea</b> <b>otter</b> as an endangered species, and describes the significant threats to sea otters as oil pollution, predation by orcas, poaching, and conflicts with fisheries– sea otters can drown if entangled in fishing gear. The hunting of sea otters is no longer legal except for limited harvests by indigenous peoples in the United States. Poaching was a serious concern in the Russian Far East immediately {{after the collapse of the}} Soviet Union in 1991; however, it has declined significantly with stricter law enforcement and better economic conditions.|$|E

40|$|Although <b>sea</b> <b>otters</b> (Enhydra lutris) {{have been}} a {{relatively}} insignificant resource in Alaska during the twentieth century, the situation is changing.
