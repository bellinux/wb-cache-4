25|$|The {{scientific}} and natural interest of this tiny group of islands {{lies in its}} marine biodiversity, its unique flora and many avian species that breed annually on its rock cliffs or use them on their stopover on normal migratory patterns. About 3% of the 9000 species of birds are marine species, the remaining are migratory species. The abundance of birds on the islands, at one time, made the islands an attractive hunting area for peoples of the region. At {{the end of the}} 19th century the German naturalist Ernst Schmitz noted that 20–22,000 Cory's shearwaters were hunted in September or October in the islands; the hunts continued until 1967. Madeiran expeditions to the islands were responsible for the killing of juvenile birds for food, while their down was used to stuff pillows and comforters. Presently the islands are home or stopover for: Cory's shearwaters (approximately 14,000), white-faced <b>storm-petrel</b> (12,000), Bulwer's petrel (500), North Atlantic little shearwater (500), Madeiran <b>storm-petrel</b> (1000), yellow-legged gull, the roseate tern and Berthelot's pipit; which are subjects of annual scientific expeditions. Many of theses species are vulnerable to local predators, primarily from populations of brown rat and predatory bird species, like the yellow-legged gull, which will consume both eggs and chicks (the white-faced <b>storm-petrel</b> and Bulwer's petrel are primarily susceptible). These islands also have many endemic fauna species, including local snails and the unique gecko Tarentola boettgeri bischoffi.|$|E
25|$|Predation {{levels on}} some burrow-nesting species {{can be quite}} high; on Alaska's Wooded Islands, for example, river otters munched their way through some 23 percent of the island's fork-tailed <b>storm-petrel</b> {{population}} during a single breeding season in 1977. There {{is some evidence that}} increased vulnerability may lead some burrow-nesting species to form colonies, or to nest closer to rival pairs in areas of high predation than they might otherwise do.|$|E

25|$|Some crevice-nesting species, {{including}} ashy <b>storm-petrel,</b> pigeon guillemot, Eurasian eagle-owl and Hume's tawny owl, {{lay their}} eggs in the relative shelter of a crevice in the rocks or a gap between boulders, but provide no additional nest material. Potoos lay their single egg directly atop a broken stump, or into a shallow depression on a branch—typically where an upward-pointing branch died and fell off, leaving a small scar or knot-hole. Brood parasites, such as the New World cowbirds, the honeyguides, {{and many of the}} Old World and Australasian cuckoos, {{lay their eggs}} in the active nests of other species.|$|E

Birds {{found on}} the islands include Atlantic puffin, <b>storm-petrel,</b> red-throated diver, northern gannet and great skua (locally called the [...] "bonxie"). Numerous rarities have also been recorded including black-browed albatross and snow goose, and {{a single pair of}} snowy owls bred on Fetlar from 1967 to 1975. The Shetland wren, Fair Isle wren and Shetland starling are subspecies endemic to Shetland. There are also populations of various moorland birds such as curlew, snipe and golden plover.|$|E
40|$|Nitrogen {{and carbon}} stable {{isotopes}} provide tools to investigate ecological segregation, prey choice and spatial distribution in seabirds. However, {{the interpretation of}} stable isotopes is frequently hampered {{by a lack of}} isotopic baseline data. In this study, two techniques proposed to overcome such shortages were tested: compound-specific isotope analyses of amino acids (AA-CSIA) and the analysis of hydrogen stable isotope ratios (HSIA). Feathers of two sympatric <b>storm-petrels</b> were compared. The two species, Black-bellied <b>storm-petrels</b> Fregetta tropicaand Wilson’s <b>storm-petrels</b> Oceanites oceanicus, moult in oceanic waters and differ in diet composition. For HSIA, a range of species with broad diet and non-breeding distribution was also investigated. Differences in carbon isotope values suggested differences in the spatial distribution and thus, in isotopic baseline values, during moult. Bulk nitrogen analyses of adult feathers did not detect species differences in trophic level. However, AA-CSIA detected clear differences in trophic levels in line with expectations: Black-bellied <b>storm-petrels</b> fed at a higher trophic level than Wilson‘s <b>storm-petrels.</b> Hydrogen values also differed between the species, but contrary to expectations were highly enriched in Black-bellied <b>storm-petrels,</b> but much less enriched in Wilson’s <b>storm-petrels.</b> Hydrogen data of seven petrel species challenge the suggestion that depleted δD values indicate a higher percentage of isosmotic fish. The present results suggest that the difference in hydrogen ratios may be explained by these petrels moulting in different ocean zones. Amino acid-specific stable isotope analyses were useful for estimating isotopic baselines and thus true trophic levels, whereas hydrogen isotopes were not.
