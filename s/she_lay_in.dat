5|$|By {{the end of}} that summer, the Honolulu Star-Bulletin {{reported}} that she was too frail to hold her birthday reception for the public, an annual tradition dating {{back to the days of}} the monarchy. As one of her last public appearances in September, she officially became a member of the American Red Cross. Following several months of deteriorating health that left her without the use of her lower limbs, as well as a diminished mental capacity rendering her incapable of recognizing her own house, her inner circle of friends and caregivers sat vigil for the last two weeks of her life knowing the end was near. In accordance with Hawaiian tradition, the royal kāhili fanned her as <b>she</b> <b>lay</b> <b>in</b> bed. On the morning of November 11, Liliʻuokalani died at the age of seventy-nine at her residence at Washington Place.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth grew camellias {{in every}} one of her gardens, and before her flag-draped coffin was taken from Windsor to lie in state at Westminster Hall, an {{arrangement}} of camellias from her own gardens was placed on top. An estimated 200,000 people over three days filed past as <b>she</b> <b>lay</b> <b>in</b> state in Westminster Hall at the Palace of Westminster. Members of the household cavalry and other branches of the armed forces stood guard at the four corners of the catafalque. At one point, her four grandsons Prince Charles, Prince Andrew, Prince Edward and Viscount Linley mounted the guard as a mark of respect—an honour similar to the Vigil of the Princes at the lying in state of King George V.|$|E
5|$|Marie died on 18 July 1938, at 5:38p.m., {{eight minutes}} after lapsing into a coma. Her two eldest children, Carol and Elisabeth, {{accompanied}} by Prince Michael, were at her deathbed. Two days later, on 20 July, Marie's body {{was brought to}} Bucharest, where <b>she</b> <b>lay</b> <b>in</b> state in the white drawing room at Cotroceni Palace. Her coffin was surrounded by flowers and glowing tapers and was guarded by officers of the Fourth Hussars. Thousands of people filed by Marie's bier during the three-day lying in state and, on the third day, the palace was opened for factory workers. Marie's funeral cortege {{made its way to}} the train station, passing under the Arch of Triumph. Her coffin was taken to Curtea de Argeș Monastery, where she was interred. Marie's heart, according to her own wishes, was placed in a small golden casket embellished with the emblems of the Romanian provinces and interred in her Stella Maris chapel in Balchik. In 1940, after Southern Dobrudja was ceded to Bulgaria during World War II, her heart was transferred to Bran Castle. There, Ileana built a chapel to house the heart, kept in two nested boxes placed inside a marble sarcophagus.|$|E
6000|$|... "Blanche {{is always}} the last," [...] said the boy, eating muffins; [...] "she's a regular dawdle, she is. When you're not here, <b>she</b> <b>lays</b> <b>in</b> bed till lunch-time." ...|$|R
60|$|I was {{standing}} in Helena's room, looking at her as <b>she</b> <b>lay</b> asleep <b>in</b> her bed.|$|R

25|$|Zakharov {{was struck}} by a car on the {{afternoon}} of 12 February 1995, while crossing St Kilda road after leaving the Midsumma gay and lesbian festival. <b>She</b> <b>lay</b> <b>in</b> a coma for more than a month, but did not regain consciousness. While she was in hospital, the Coalition arranged a pair, so as not to take advantage of Zakharov's injuries in a closely divided Senate. Having never regained consciousness, Zakharov died on 6March. No charges were laid regarding the accident. She was the first woman Senator to die in office.|$|E
25|$|According to legend, Hala Sultan {{died after}} falling off her mule and {{breaking}} her neck {{during the first}} Arab incursions into Cyprus around 647 A.D. The same night, a divine power supposedly placed three giant stones where <b>she</b> <b>lay.</b> <b>In</b> 1760, Hala Sultan's grave was discovered by Sheikh Hasan; he began spreading the word about her healing powers, and a tomb was built there. The complex – comprising a mosque, mausoleum, minaret, cemetery and living quarters {{for men and women}} – was constructed in its present form while the island was still under Ottoman rule, and completed in around 1816.|$|E
25|$|City {{officials}} in Montgomery and Detroit announced on October 27, 2005, that the front seats of their city buses would be reserved with black ribbons {{in honor of}} Parks until her funeral. Parks' coffin was flown to Montgomery and taken in a horse-drawn hearse to the St. Paul African Methodist Episcopal (AME) church, where <b>she</b> <b>lay</b> <b>in</b> repose at the altar on October 29, 2005, dressed in the uniform of a church deaconess. A memorial service was held there the following morning. One of the speakers, United States Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, said that {{if it had not}} been for Parks, she would probably have never become the Secretary of State. In the evening the casket was transported to Washington, D.C. and transported by a bus similar to the one in which she made her protest, to lie in honor in the rotunda of the U.S. Capitol.|$|E
60|$|June {{mastered}} her sobs, and squeezing {{his hand}} feverishly, <b>she</b> <b>lay</b> back <b>in</b> her corner, her face muffled in a shawl.|$|R
5000|$|The song, says Carey, is {{from the}} {{perspective}} of her Tennessee character Krystal, an aspiring singer. [...] "The song has its own arc," [...] Carey said. [...] "She begins by telling us where she started, like <b>she</b> <b>lays</b> <b>in</b> bed and wonders where she left herself. A lot of people go through that sort of thing. It's kind of about empowerment." ...|$|R

2500|$|Speke {{inspected}} the slave ship and bore witness {{in his writings}} regarding the appalling and inhumane conditions on board. When Speke boarded Manuela as <b>she</b> <b>lay</b> <b>in</b> Pomoni Harbor, he saw half-starved people below decks, mostly children, {{along with a few}} old women who lay dying in [...] "the most disgusting ferret box atmosphere." [...] Other slaves who had the strength were ripping open the ship’s hatches and scrambling for the salted fish packed beneath.|$|E
2500|$|Not {{only her}} Sisters are {{bereaved}} by her death, but {{all those who}} knew her excellence {{and the amount of}} good she did, join in lamenting that she should have been removed from the sphere of her usefulness. To judge from the celestial expression of her countenance as <b>she</b> <b>lay</b> <b>in</b> death, {{there is every reason to}} believe that she has already taken her abode among the Saints in Heaven, enjoying the munificence of God, who rewards His servants 'according to their works.' ...|$|E
2500|$|In The OMAC Project limited series, Booster Gold gathers the old Justice League International heroes to {{investigate}} Blue Beetle's disappearance. At the series' end, he is ruined physically and emotionally, having destroyed {{much of his}} gear {{in the fight against}} the OMACs. He has seen his friend Rocket Red die in battle. He discovered that another friend, Maxwell Lord, is responsible for killing Blue Beetle and that in fact, Lord always hated metahumans and superheroes. In a moment of self-reflection, he realizes that if only he had bothered to recall more of what was history in his native era, he {{might have been able to}} warn his friends. Giving a farewell kiss to the forehead of his wounded teammate Fire as <b>she</b> <b>lay</b> <b>in</b> a hospital bed, he drops his trademark goggles on the floor and leaves, saying only that he has decided to [...] "go home", implying a return to the 25th century.|$|E
60|$|With that <b>she</b> <b>lay</b> down <b>in</b> the bed by his side, and her misery was {{so extreme}} that {{she fell in}} a deep slumber instantly.|$|R

2500|$|The {{ship was}} renamed once more—this {{time as the}} SS Montlaurier. She was [...] rebuilt to carry cabin-class and 3rd-class passengers. [...] On May 4, 1923, she sailed from Liverpool for Quebec; but {{she was forced to}} return to England because of boiler trouble. [...] After repairs were completed, she left port again on June 29, 1923. [...] Her last voyage from Liverpool to Saint John, New Brunswick began on January 24, 1925. [...] What was {{expected}} to have been a return voyage was cut short in February when she encountered steering gear trouble near Fastnet Rock off the southern coast of Ireland. [...] The mechanical malfunction forced the ship to return to Queenstown (now known as Cobh). [...] She was then towed to Liverpool. On April 14, 1925, she was damaged by fire as <b>she</b> <b>lay</b> <b>in</b> port under repair by Cammell, Laird & Co., but the fire-damage was not so extensive that she couldn't be restored.|$|E
2500|$|Upon their marriage, Thomas {{moved into}} his wife’s house, at Chelsea Manor in London, {{where she lived}} with her step-daughter, the 14-year-old Elizabeth. Thomas was the uncle of Elizabeth's half-brother, and the newly wed husband of her step-mother, and their family roles {{regarding}} each other were, perhaps, unclear. Now, living {{under the same roof}} as Elizabeth, Thomas became more than a little familiar, if not intimate, with Elizabeth, indulging in daily romps with her, tickling her, and slapping her on her behind as <b>she</b> <b>lay</b> <b>in</b> her bed, or coming into her room in his nightclothes. Her governess, Kat Ashley, thought this scandalous, and reported it to Catherine. [...] Indignant, Thomas retorted, 'By God's precious soul, I mean no evil, and I will not leave it!' [...] At first, Catherine dismissed the behaviour as just innocent fun, and even joined in the romps on a few occasions. Elizabeth's feelings regarding this behaviour are unknown, but it was said that she bore Thomas some degree of affection. And though her governess, Kat Ashley, [...] "bade him go away in shame," [...] she found him more amusing than dangerous. When Catherine was pregnant in the spring of 1548, she had become concerned enough about her husband’s flirtatious relationship with Elizabeth that she sent Elizabeth away to live with Anthony Denny and his wife, Joan Champernowne (Kat Ashley's sister), in Hertfordshire. In June 1548, Catherine and Thomas Seymour moved their household from London to Sudeley Castle, the property granted to Seymour when he became Baron Seymour of Sudeley. In September 1548, Catherine gave birth to a daughter, Mary Seymour. In the following days, she became uncharacteristically hostile and delusional. Thomas lay in bed with her to quiet her, but she did not get better, and died of complications due to childbirth, just before Elizabeth’s 15th birthday. Upon her death, Catherine bequeathed all of her possessions to Thomas, making him one of the richest men in England. He said he was [...] "amazed" [...] at her death; yet it opened up new opportunities to him, as his eye returned to Elizabeth. From fear or shrewdness, she avoided him, returning, with her governess, Kat Ashley, to her childhood home, Hatfield House.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>lay</b> <b>in</b> my arms, and I {{thought for}} a moment she had fainted.|$|E
60|$|In {{this way}} Tina wore out {{the long hours}} of the windy moon-light, till at last, with weary aching limbs, <b>she</b> <b>lay</b> down <b>in</b> bed again, and slept from mere exhaustion.|$|R
60|$|As <b>she</b> <b>lay</b> more quietly <b>in</b> {{his arms}} Tarzan {{slightly}} relaxed his grip upon her.|$|R
60|$|There was frost in the air, and Billy {{brought the}} Morris chair {{in by the}} kitchen stove. <b>She</b> <b>lay</b> cuddled <b>in</b> his arms, {{her head on his}} shoulder, his cheek against her hair.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>lay</b> <b>in</b> her friend's arms; {{she looked}} up in her friend's face; she went back wildly to her fear for her child.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I am too {{fine for}} this world!' said she as <b>she</b> <b>lay</b> <b>in</b> the gutter; 'but I know who I am, {{and that is}} always a little satisfaction!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What's {{the matter}} with him?" [...] asked Ellen, with a voice in sympathy with the slow {{movement}} of her large eyes as <b>she</b> <b>lay</b> <b>in</b> her berth, staring at Lottie.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I know that," [...] she admitted, and <b>she</b> <b>lay</b> back <b>in</b> her chair, looking dreamily {{into the}} fire. After {{a while she}} asked, abruptly: [...] "Will you give it up if I will?" ...|$|R
60|$|Then <b>she</b> <b>lay</b> down <b>in</b> her cosey crib {{with the}} pink cover and the lace curtains, and fell fast asleep, {{glad to have}} clean sheets, soft blankets, and her own little pillow once more.|$|R
60|$|A gloom {{seemed to}} have fallen on her. <b>She</b> <b>lay</b> back <b>in</b> her corner, silent and {{apparently}} exhausted. Mary, {{in spite of her}} own preoccupation, was struck by her pallor and her attitude of dejection.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Then your end will {{be hanging}} {{at the bridge}} of Dublin,' said she. But there was no sleep for her that night, for <b>she</b> <b>lay</b> <b>in</b> the dark {{thinking}} about her son.|$|E
60|$|She was {{so close}} to him that his embrace, sudden and passionate though it was, came about almost naturally. <b>She</b> <b>lay</b> <b>in</b> his arms with perfect content and raised her lips to his.|$|E
60|$|How long <b>she</b> <b>lay</b> <b>in</b> {{the faint}} {{she did not}} know. When she {{recovered}} the limousine was still rattling forward at a brisk gait but bumping over ruts {{in a manner that}} indicated a country road.|$|E
50|$|When the Napoleonic Wars Imperieuse {{was renamed}} Unite and eturned to {{service in the}} Mediterranean.

50|$|The cruiser {{returned}} to San Francisco on 3 December and remained there at anchor until placed in ordinary at Mare Island on 24 May 1867. <b>She</b> <b>lay</b> there, <b>in</b> ordinary, until sold on 1 April 1873 to Howe & Company of San Francisco.|$|R
60|$|The {{next moment}} <b>she</b> <b>lay</b> clasped <b>in</b> his arms. All was still around them, {{save for the}} gentle patter-patter of the rain on the trees of the ramparts: and from very far away the echo of {{laughter}} and music from the distant revellers.|$|R
