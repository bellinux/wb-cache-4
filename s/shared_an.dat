5|$|Berge and Brundtland were {{introduced}} to each other through a mutual friend in Tromsø, Norway. They enjoyed the same films and music, and <b>shared</b> <b>an</b> interest in electronics. The two experimented with various forms of electronic music, and bought a drum machine together during the Tromsø techno scene before going their separate ways. Several years later, the two met up again and formed Röyksopp during the Bergen Wave.

5|$|During the 1900 English cricket season, Ollivierre {{travelled}} to England with a West Indian team. Invited to tour England by Lord Hawke {{following the}} success of English tours to the Caribbean, the team was the first from the West Indies to visit England, and matches were not first-class. The team improved steadily throughout, {{and by the end}} of the tour were judged to be playing well. Although predominantly made up from white players, the team contained several black cricketers; at the time, the dominant teams in the West Indies were exclusively white. Ollivierre was the most consistent and successful batsman in the team, scoring 883 runs at a batting average of 32. His highest score, and only century, came against Leicestershire, when he scored 159 runs and <b>shared</b> <b>an</b> opening partnership of 238 with Pelham Warner. He also <b>shared</b> <b>an</b> opening partnership of 208 with Percy Cox against Surrey. He bowled occasionally in the early part of the tour, although with little success, but did not bowl at all in his last eight games.|$|E

Besides speed skating and cycling, she also played volleyball and performed gymnastics {{when she was a}} child. Van Dijk left Harmelen for her study to Amsterdam in 2006, where she still lives. During the first years in Amsterdam she shared her apartment with Mariëlle Kerste, her best friend and also a Dutch cyclist. Kerste moved out a few years later and Van Dijk has since <b>shared</b> <b>an</b> apartment with the Dutch cyclist Hannah Walter. In December 2014 Van Dijk moved to Woerden.|$|E

5|$|However, both Clinton and Larson {{present the}} {{possibility}} that Margaret was in fact Tubman's daughter. Larson {{points out that the}} two <b>shared</b> <b>an</b> unusually strong bond, and argues that Tubman – knowing the pain of a child separated from her mother – would never have intentionally caused a free family to be split apart. Clinton presents evidence of strong physical similarities, which Alice herself acknowledged. Both historians agree that no concrete evidence exists for such a possibility, and the mystery of Tubman's relationship with young Margaret remains to this day.|$|E
5|$|In 1888 Ravel met {{the young}} pianist Ricardo Viñes, who became {{not only a}} lifelong friend, but {{also one of the}} {{foremost}} interpreters of his works, and an important link between Ravel and Spanish music. The two <b>shared</b> <b>an</b> appreciation of Wagner, Russian music, and the writings of Poe, Baudelaire, and Mallarmé. At the Exposition Universelle in Paris in 1889, Ravel was much struck by the new Russian works conducted by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov. This music had a lasting effect on both Ravel and his older contemporary Claude Debussy, as did the exotic sound of the Javanese gamelan, also heard during the Exposition.|$|E
5|$|Research by Chandler, Griffin, and Sorensen into a {{link between}} letter names and {{donations}} has been widely accepted. They analyzed the records of disaster relief donations after seven hurricanes (among others, Katrina, Rita and Mitch). They {{found that people who}} <b>shared</b> <b>an</b> initial with the hurricane were overrepresented as donors. They concluded that people want to overcome some of the negative feelings associated with the shared name and thus donate.Simonsohn suggested that implicit egotism only applies to cases where people are nearly indifferent between options, and therefore it would not apply to major decisions such as career choices, but would to low-stakes decisions such as choosing a charity.|$|E
40|$|A {{dissertation}} {{submitted to}} the Department of Management of Technology for the MBA in Management of TechnologyThis research provides empirical evidence on the readiness of the banking industry of Srilanka towards <b>shared</b> <b>A</b> TM networks. Drawing from a contingency theory, the research posits that the credibility of <b>shared</b> <b>A</b> TM network depends on the IT, marketing departments planning and operational department's operational procedures of respective banks. Study also reveals that the credibility of <b>shared</b> <b>A</b> TM network and its formulation process, in turn. determine {{the effectiveness of the}} implementation of the <b>shared</b> <b>A</b> TM network in achieving the desired performance. The causal relationships amongst these variables were then analyzed by structural equation model using LISREL 8. 80 program. ///The primary data for this study were collected through structured interviews with the mangers or higher positions of all 31 operating Srilankan banks. Study confirms the belief of the importance of an innovative culture in implementing strategic marketing planning and IT requirements of the <b>shared</b> <b>A</b> TM network. The study also identifies that all IT, marketing and operational departments play equally important roles in planning and implementing the <b>shared</b> <b>A</b> TM networks between two banks. Top management support will also be a significant factor in moving to <b>shared</b> <b>A</b> TM networks as they are the decision makers. These findings not only support the view that it is inappropriate to separate <b>shared</b> <b>A</b> TM planning from its implementation aspects, but also corroborate the importance of the fit between shared ATM network and the factors supports the <b>shared</b> <b>A</b> TM network operation. Finally, study reveals that, though resources and other factors are available within the Srilankan banks to <b>share</b> their <b>A</b> TM networks, lack of visionary leadership within the industry or within the country has delayed the emergence of <b>shared</b> <b>A</b> TM network...|$|R

The two <b>shared</b> <b>an</b> interest in collecting vintage musical gear and studying historic recording techniques, which they had applied in recording The Way I See It. However, for Stone Rollin, they sought to eschew its predecessor's Motown aesthetic for a more eclectic style, in keeping with Saadiq's other musical projects.|$|E
5|$|Since {{before the}} start of the American Revolution, Boston and New York City have <b>shared</b> <b>an</b> intense rivalry as cities. For more than a century after its founding, Boston was arguably the educational, cultural, artistic, and {{economic}} power in the United States. Boston's location as the closest American port to Europe and its concentration of elite schools and manufacturing hubs helped maintain this position for several decades. During this time period, New York was often looked down upon as the upstart, over-populated, dirty cousin to aristocratic and clean Boston.|$|E

Henry Mancini in particular found plenty of work for him; the two <b>shared</b> <b>an</b> interest in experimenting with tone colors, and Mancini came to rely on Manne to shape the percussive effects in his music. Breakfast at Tiffany's (1961), Hatari! (1962) and The Pink Panther (1963) {{are only a few}} of Mancini's films where Manne's drums and special percussive effects could be heard.|$|E

5|$|This {{claim was}} {{rejected}} by Appian, who maintained that Octavian <b>shared</b> <b>an</b> equal interest with Lepidus and Antony in eradicating his enemies. Suetonius said that Octavian was reluctant to proscribe officials, but did pursue his enemies with more rigor than the other triumvirs. Plutarch described the proscriptions as a ruthless and cutthroat swapping {{of friends and family}} among Antony, Lepidus, and Octavian. For example, Octavian allowed the proscription of his ally Cicero, Antony the proscription of his maternal uncle Lucius Julius Caesar (the consul of 64 BC), and Lepidus his brother Paullus.|$|E
5|$|Vanilla Ice took an {{interest}} in the musical style found on Hard to Swallow while performing {{as a member of a}} Miami grunge band, and was able to develop this sound through a friendship with producer Ross Robinson, with whom he <b>shared</b> <b>an</b> interest in motocross racing. Robinson produced the album after being advised against working with Vanilla Ice. The album's darker lyrical subject matter developed from conversations, in which Robinson encouraged him to write about his past. Subjects included Vanilla Ice's abusive childhood, drug addiction and struggles with fame. While the album revived Vanilla Ice's career, it received largely negative reviews and did not chart.|$|E
5|$|Wyatt Earp and Cochise County sheriff Johnny Behan were {{interested}} in the same sheriff's position and also may have <b>shared</b> <b>an</b> interest in the same woman, Josephine Marcus, known as Sadie. Citizens of Tombstone believed that Behan and Marcus were married, but Behan was a known womanizer and had sex with prostitutes and other women. Marcus ended the relationship after she came home and found Behan in bed with the wife of a friend and kicked him out, although she used the Behan surname through the end of that summer. She rented her home sometime before April 1881 to a doctor, George Goodfellow.|$|E

5|$|An {{advertisement}} in The Guardian led Rowling {{to move to}} Porto, Portugal, {{to teach}} English as a foreign language. She taught at night and began writing in the day while listening to Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto. After 18 months in Porto, she met Portuguese television journalist Jorge Arantes in a bar and found they <b>shared</b> <b>an</b> interest in Jane Austen. They married on 16 October 1992 and their child, Jessica Isabel Rowling Arantes (named after Jessica Mitford), was born on 27 July 1993 in Portugal. Rowling had previously suffered a miscarriage. The couple separated on 17 November 1993. Biographers have suggested that Rowling suffered domestic abuse during her marriage, although the extent is unknown. In December 1993, Rowling and her then-infant daughter moved to Edinburgh, Scotland, to be near Rowling's sister with three chapters of what would become Harry Potter in her suitcase.|$|E
5|$|Ashlynn Yennie as Jenny, {{the rear}} {{section of the}} centipede. As with Williams, The Human Centipede was Yennie's first major film role. Yennie {{was one of several}} actresses to {{audition}} for the role, as the producers searched for an actress who would have good on-screen chemistry with Williams. Yennie was able to further develop her relationship with Williams when the pair <b>shared</b> <b>an</b> apartment in the Netherlands during filming. Yennie auditioned to Ilona Six, sister of Tom Six and the film's producer, and did not meet Tom Six, who had viewed tapes of her reading, until fitting for the centipede special effects in the Netherlands. Yennie was drawn to the role by the humanity throughout the story, referring to how the three victims of Heiter are unwillingly forced into their situation. She also said the story was so realistic it scared her.|$|E
5|$|C. Rudhraiya, whose former {{name was}} Aarumugam, was {{introduced}} to Kamal Haasan by writer and director Ananthu. The three <b>shared</b> <b>an</b> interest {{in the works of}} Robert Bresson, Jean-Luc Godard, Roman Polanski, and Roberto Rossellini. Godard and Bresson were part of the French New Wave, which focused on films based on social ideas, some of which were iconoclastic in nature. Rudhraiya, Haasan, and Ananthu wanted to experiment with their ideas in Tamil. This was Rudhraiya's first film as director; quite radical in his approach, he wanted to change the conventions of Tamil cinema at that time. K. Rajeshwar was writing a script dealing with women's liberation at that time, and it was decided that his script would be used for the film; the result was Aval Appadithan. The initial script by Rajeshwar consisted of two pages.|$|E
