She looked at us. <b>She</b> <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> <b>and</b> she set sail.” Following her death, the marquee on the Apollo Theater read “A TRUE APOLLO LEGEND RUBY DEE 1922-2014".|$|E
2500|$|Case 1. A {{girl had}} 2 {{seizures}} in sleep at 6 years of age. In the first fit {{she was found}} vomiting vigorously, eyes turned to one side, pale, and unresponsive. Her condition remained unchanged for 3 hours before she developed generalized tonic-clonic convulsions. She gradually improved, and {{by the next morning}} was normal. The second seizure occurred 4 months later. She awoke and told her mother that she wanted to vomit, and then vomited. Within minutes her eyes turned to the right. Her mother, who was on her left, asked, [...] "Where am I?" [...] "There, there," [...] the child replied, indicating to the right. Ten minutes later <b>she</b> <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> became unresponsive. Generalized convulsions occurred 1 hour from onset. Thereafter she recovered quickly. Her EEGs showed occipital paroxysms, but this normalized by the age of 10 years. [...] The patient had in childhood infrequent vasovagal syncopes and/or syncope-like epileptic seizures. [...] At last communication with her, she was 29 years of age and following a successful professional career.|$|E
60|$|A sudden {{illuminating}} {{flash of}} horror {{told her the}} truth. <b>She</b> <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> tried to run from the room.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> in token {{that the}} brief {{audience}} was over.|$|R
60|$|It {{was of no}} use lecturing <b>her</b> again, for <b>she</b> <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|R
60|$|Then <b>she</b> <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> again, {{and went}} on talking incoherently to herself.|$|R
60|$|Dora said no more, but {{sank down}} on the couch. Then an idea came to her mind, and lying back <b>she</b> <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> pretended to go to sleep.|$|E
60|$|Then <b>she</b> <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> {{waited for}} the end. No slender shafts pierced her tender side. She raised her lids to see what stayed the hand of her executioners.|$|E
60|$|So she {{sat down}} {{in a corner of the}} coop, leaned her back against the slats, nodded at the {{friendly}} stars before <b>she</b> <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> <b>and</b> was asleep in half a minute.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>closes</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> so that <b>she</b> may see {{the revelations}} more clearly. So does Ginevra.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> {{ignoring}} his remark. They turned presently into a narrower thoroughfare. She leaned towards him.|$|R
60|$|And {{throwing}} <b>her</b> neck back, <b>she</b> <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> again. The sunlight streamed {{in on her}} {{between the}} half-drawn curtains.|$|R
60|$|Sophy gave a {{very faint}} smile of {{pleasure}} and recognition, and then taking a little medicine, which the doctor had prepared in readiness for her waking, <b>she</b> <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> <b>and</b> was soon again asleep.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> Tavernake sat quite {{still on}} the end of her couch, his elbow upon his knee, his head resting upon his hand. Presently, the rush of {{customers}} having ceased, the chemist came in.|$|E
6000|$|She trembled. Coming for her! There was no escape, no peace, no hope. She looked round despairingly. Suddenly {{the whole}} shadowy coast, the blurred islets, the heaven itself, swayed about twice, then {{came to a}} rest. <b>She</b> <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> shouted-- ...|$|E
50|$|Athena {{smiles at}} him then starts to feel sleepy. When <b>she</b> <b>closes</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> <b>she</b> ends up dying in his arms.|$|R
50|$|Peter finally {{starts to}} walk, and Shari goes {{to visit her}} actual mother; when she gets tucked in, <b>she</b> <b>closes</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes...</b> forever.|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> as {{with the}} shudder of hearing such words. [...] "Not, surely, by any monstrous chance! Fancy dear, proud Theign------!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Dis way," [...] said Carry, {{curling up}} into position, {{with one arm}} around Mrs. Tretherick's neck and her cheek resting on her bosom--"dis way--dere." [...] After a little preparatory nestling, not unlike some small animal, <b>she</b> <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> <b>and</b> went to sleep.|$|E
60|$|The moment Joan {{was seated}} on the {{platform}} <b>she</b> <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> allowed her chin to fall; and so sat, with her hands nestling in her lap, indifferent to everything, caring for nothing but rest. And she was so white again--white as alabaster.|$|E
60|$|He {{glanced at}} his watch, relit his pipe, and relapsed once more into sombre silence. Julia's {{thoughts}} went flitting away. <b>She</b> <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> leaned back. She had only one fear now. Would he find out! He was thick enough, in his way, but he was no fool, and he was already coarsely jealous.|$|E
60|$|Involuntarily <b>she</b> <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> as Billy's thumb-ends {{pressed into}} them. She {{could feel the}} fore-running ache of a dull and terrible hurt.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> tightly. Gavin {{was in a}} quandary. I {{suppose he}} had looked at <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> too long to know much about them.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, stay, my {{only true}} love, stay," [...] The {{constant}} Marg'ret cry'd; Wan grew <b>her</b> cheeks, <b>she</b> <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> [...] Stretched <b>her</b> soft limbs, and dy'd.|$|R
60|$|As {{the train}} plodded through the gray prairie, on a windless {{day with the}} smoke from the engine {{clinging}} to the fields in giant cotton-rolls, in a low and writhing wall which shut off the snowy fields, she did not look out of the window. <b>She</b> <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> hummed, and did not know that she was humming.|$|E
60|$|A soft patter of {{rain on the}} {{tarpaulin}} warned Helen {{to remember}} Dale's directions, and, pulling up the heavy covering, she arranged it hoodlike over the saddle. Then, with Bo close and warm beside her, <b>she</b> <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> <b>and</b> {{the sense of the}} black forest and the wind and rain faded. Last of all sensations was the smell of smoke that blew under the tarpaulin.|$|E
60|$|Nothing {{had changed}} there. <b>She</b> <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> saw the little dining room {{in all the}} dignity of Sunday dinner, the big silver soup tureen {{catching}} the sun, the flowered china with the gilt edges, and even a glimpse of lace paper when the closet door opened; Aunt Mary and Uncle Tom, with Peter between them. And these, strangely, were the only tangible things and immutable.|$|E
60|$|A little tremor {{seemed to}} pass through her whole frame. For a moment <b>she</b> <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b> Then <b>she</b> sprang {{to her feet and}} stood quivering before him.|$|R
60|$|The {{twilight}} {{was falling}} slate-blue at the window. <b>She</b> <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> <b>closed</b> away the monotonous level of dead wonder, and opened them {{again to the}} every-day world.|$|R
60|$|Having {{launched}} this dart, <b>she</b> <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> {{again with}} something more like content {{than she had}} yet shown: it had an aim of which she could always be sure.|$|R
60|$|Dressed {{as she was}} in riding {{breeches}} with no entangling skirts {{to hinder}} or catch upon passing shrubbery, she soon found that she could cling tightly {{to the back of}} the mighty bull and when a moment later he took to the lower branches of the trees, <b>she</b> <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> clung to him in terror lest she be precipitated to the ground below.|$|E
6000|$|She {{tried to}} rid herself of the ache at her heart by {{thinking}} of Wales. <b>She</b> <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> <b>and</b> found that that {{helped her to}} remember. With her eyes shut, she could bring it all back--that rainy day, the graceful, supple figure {{that had come to}} her out of the mist, those walks over the hills [...] . If only Geoffrey would come! It was the sight of him that she needed.|$|E
60|$|Tears {{gathered}} in her eyes. At other times {{she would have}} scorned the weakness, now she welcomed it, for it seemed to lift the load of oppression from her heart. The glare of that vivid blue sky above weighed down her lids. <b>She</b> <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> for {{the space of a}} few seconds she seemed to forget everything; the world, and its treachery, the palace of Versailles, the fugitives in Scotland.|$|E
50|$|Whenever <b>she</b> <b>closes</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> all Sanjana sees are {{a variety}} of ghosts staring at her in various states of blood and gore. When she awakens she can see them lying by her side.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, no. It {{seems to}} me {{as though it were}} no time since we were being hustled into those boats. I can see it all now." [...] <b>She</b> <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> with a shudder.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> {{for several}} moments. For some reason or other, this last {{reflection}} seemed {{to bring her}} no particular relief. When she opened them again, her decision was written in her face.|$|R
