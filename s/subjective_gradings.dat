40|$|Ordering {{information}} {{is a difficult}} but important task for applications generating naturallanguage texts such as multi-document summarization, question answering, and conceptto-text generation. In multi-document summarization, {{information is}} selected from a set of source documents. However, improper ordering of information in a summary can confuse the reader and deteriorate the readability of the summary. Therefore, {{it is vital to}} properly order the information in multi-document summarization. We present a bottom-up approach to arrange sentences extracted for multi-document summarization. To capture the association and order of two textual segments (e. g. sentences), we define four criteria: chronology, topical-closeness, precedence, and succession. These criteria are integrated into a criterion by a supervised learning approach. We repeatedly concatenate two textual segments into one segment based on the criterion, until we obtain the overall segment with all sentences arranged. We evaluate the sentence orderings produced by the proposed method and numerous baselines using <b>subjective</b> <b>gradings</b> as well as automatic evaluation measures. We introduce the average continuity, an automatic evaluation measure of sentence ordering in a summary, and investigate its appropriateness for this task.

40|$|Purpose: To {{introduce}} {{and describe}} two methods of grading {{the severity of}} infantile cataracts, and thereby propose a useful clinical guide for early surgical intervention. Methods: Thirty-three subjects, aged 1 week to 8 years, participated in the study. Twenty-two were evaluated soon after birth (1 week), and 11 in childhood (3 – 8 years). All had isolated infantile cataracts, of which 16 were bilateral and 17 unilateral. Nine cataract types were examined; nuclear (n = 9), lamellar (n = 9), posterior lenticonus (n = 4), persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous (n = 4), posterior polar (n = 3) and single cases of total, cortical, sutural and anterior polar. Grading the infantile cataracts was performed subjectively based on the cataract morphology, density and position using an 11 -point (0 – 10) ordinal scale. Objective measures of the cataracts were performed by scanning and then digitising photo-slit lamp images to provide cataract intensity profiles. Subjects without cataracts acted as controls. Results: <b>Subjective</b> <b>gradings</b> of 0 and 10 {{were assigned to the}} clear, cataract-free lens and the total cataract, respectively. Fixed grades of 1 (anterior polar, sutural) and 6 (posterior polar) were assigned to the three remaining cataracts with static morphologies. The five cataracts which were all progressive were given grading ranges, reflecting the initial and likely final morphological states. Objective measures were found to be valuable in indicating the exact position and relative density of the cataract, as well as accurately defining boundaries. Conclusions: The magnitude and severity of infantile cataracts can be usefully characterised by an 11 -point ordinal subjective grading scale. Although subjective grading alone is satisfactory, it can be greatly assisted by objective measures, particularly in the documentation of cataract progression. Cataracts assigned grades 1 – 4 were considered minor obstructions to vision and therefore not candidates for early surgery. Cataracts graded 5 and above were considered major visual defects, and ideally should be removed early in life...|$|E
40|$|There {{is a lack}} of {{scientific}} evidence for objective evaluation of neck and back musculoskeletal sensitivity in horses, although pressure algometry has been described as an objective tool to quantify musculoskeletal responses by mechanical nociceptive threshold (MNT) values. This study aimed to evaluate the use of pressure algometry for objectively quantifying the effect of diagnostic palpation applied by physiotherapists on the musculoskeletal function of the equine neck and back. The inter-examiner repeatability of animal physiotherapists was tested, and their subjective clinical scores for the vertebral column area were objectively compared with MNT values measured at the same locations to investigate the potential clinical implementation of the pressure algometer in daily equine rehabilitation practice. Six adult Dutch Warmblood riding school mares were randomly assigned to an experimental or a control group. The MNT of all horses was measured on 35 pre-defined sites on the vertebral column in the morning and in the evening of the same day. In the experimental group (n = 3), neck and back surface "temperature", "pain", "muscle tone", and passive "mobility" were scored through palpation by three certified physiotherapists and related to MNT measurements at the same vertebral column locations. Agreement between the physiotherapists was determined from Spearman's rank correlation coefficients (P<. 05). These correlation coefficients showed a significant agreement between the scores of individual physiotherapists and with objective MNT measurements. The three physiotherapists agreed best in their <b>subjective</b> <b>gradings</b> of "pain", but less for "temperature" and "muscle tone", and least for "mobility". There was also a significant difference in MNT between individual horses. The physiotherapeutic diagnostic intervention did not significantly alter the MNT of the experimental group compared with the control group. There was a significant difference, however, between morning (7. 4 kg/cm(2)) and evening (6. 9 kg/cm(2)) MNT-measurements within the combined group (n = 6, P<. 05). In conclusion, a pressure algometer proved to be a useful tool to objectively monitor the palpation of individual Warmbloods by individual physiotherapists. The correlation of their scores to the objective MNT measurements elucidated that there were differences on which scale ("pain", "temperature", "muscle tone", "mobility") they merely relied upon in their palpation. Significant effects of physiotherapeutic diagnostic palpation on MNT, however, were not found. The lower MNT of the horses at the second trial in the evening could be a sensitization of the measurement location because of bruising, a learning effect of the horses, or a diurnal fluctuation. The use of pressure algometry has both a potential to quantify clinical neck and back musculoskeletal sensitivity in horses possibly leading to dysfunction, as veil as to objectively evaluate treatment results. Repeated measurements on the same day and on the same location along the vertebral column may influence absolute MNT values. The algometer can be used with success provided that the operator has proper and frequent training...|$|E
30|$|Statistical {{analysis}} was performed by a statistician with use of R software (version 3.1. 1.; R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). Differences between the MR sequences {{were considered to be}} statistically significant if p[*]<[*] 0.05. The Friedman test and pairwise Wilcoxon tests with Bonferroni-Holm correction for multiple testing were used to compare the performance and <b>subjective</b> image quality <b>gradings</b> of all sequences [19]. Interreader agreement was determined using the weighted kappa (к) statistic with к value[*]≥[*] 0.8 indicating excellent agreement. To increase statistical power for the performance analysis, calculations were made for all articular surfaces, all grades of severity, and both readers combined. Therefore, a bootstrapping procedure with 1000 samples {{at the level of the}} patients was used to calculate standard errors. Finally, the proportion of definite MR diagnoses (i.e. definitely normal or definitely abnormal) was calculated for each sequence.|$|R
40|$|Cataract {{surgery is}} one of the most common {{surgical}} procedures performed worldwide. Posterior capsul opacification (PCO) remains the most common postoperative complication that can deteriorate vision. Development of glistenings in the artificial intraocular lens (IOL) after cataract surgery is a phenomenon with the potential to reduce the outcome of an otherwise excellent final surgical result. Phacoemulsification has been the most common surgical technique performed to remove cataracts during the previous 25 years. The settings controlling the fluidics in the eye intraoperatively can affect the postoperative convalescence. Since many people undergo cataract surgery annually and all of the previously mentioned issues can affect the final outcome, a better understanding and more studies comparing different IOLs and phacoemulsification settings will help surgeons choose better IOLs and surgical techniques and decrease postoperative complications. In study I, we compared the development of PCO and glistenings associated with two hydrophobic acrylic IOLs, the Sensar AR 40 e (Abbott Medical Optics) and AcrySof SA 60 AT (Alcon), 5 to 7 years after cataract surgery. Both IOLs had a sharp posterior edge design. We also evaluated if there were correlations between the amount of glistenings and corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) or contrast sensitivity and if <b>subjective</b> <b>gradings</b> of glistenings were correlated with the objective quantification of glistenings with Scheimpflug images. Eighty patients were included in this prospective randomized study. Fifty-six patients completed the follow-up visit from 5 to 7 years postoperatively. Glistenings were graded at the slit-lamp microscope and the amount of glistenings was quantified objectively using Scheimpflug images with subsequent processing in computer software. There were no significant differences in PCO area and severity or neodymium:yttrium-aluminium-garnet (Nd:YAG) capsulotomy rates between the IOLs. Significantly more glistenings were found in the AcrySof hydrophobic IOLs 5 to 7 years postoperatively. The glistenings were not correlated with the CDVA or contrast sensitivity. In study II, we evaluated in a prospective randomized trial if there were any correlations between the amount of glistenings and CDVA or contrast sensitivity and compared the development of glistenings in two acrylic IOLs, a hydrophilic IOL (BL 27, Bausch & Lomb) and a hydrophobic IOL (AcrySof SA 60 AT), 9 years after cataract surgery. One hundred and twenty patients were recruited, 78 completed the 9 -year follow-up visit. The amount of glistenings was quantified objectively using Scheimpflug images with subsequent processing in computer software. Glistenings were also subjectively graded at the slit-lamp microscope. The hydrophobic IOL had significantly more glistenings at the 9 -year follow-up visit. The glistenings were not correlated with the CDVA or contrast sensitivity. In study III, we compared the PCO area, severity, and survival time without Nd:YAG capsulotomy between a hydrophilic (BL 27) and a hydrophobic (AcrySof SA 60 AT) acrylic IOLs 9 years after cataract surgery. One hundred and twenty patients were recruited, 78 completed the 9 -year follow-up visit. The PCO area and severity were higher in the hydrophilic IOL. The survival time without Nd:YAG capsulotomy was longer in the hydrophobic IOL. In study IV, we compared low and standard fluidics settings during phacoemulsification cataract surgery and evaluated the impact on the eye postoperatively by measuring parameters indicating surgical trauma. Forty-three patients were recruited and randomized into two groups, i. e., those that underwent phacoemulsification with low or standard fluidics settings. The central corneal thickness, macular thickness, and intraocular pressure were measured preoperatively, 1 day, 3 weeks, and 3 months postoperatively. The CDVA was measured preoperatively, 3 weeks and 3 months after surgery. Anterior chamber flare was measured preoperatively, 1 day and 3 weeks postoperatively. Endothelial cell density was measured preoperatively and 3 months postoperatively. The low-settings group had a significantly longer surgical time and higher amount of ultrasound energy used intraoperatively, but there were no significant differences in the outcome parameters between the two groups...|$|E
