5|$|Sloped, {{vertical}} or upside-down welding {{requires more}} operator <b>skill,</b> <b>and</b> often necessitates {{the use of}} an electrode that solidifies quickly to prevent the molten metal from flowing out of the weld pool. However, this generally means that the electrode melts less quickly, thus increasing the time required to lay the weld.|$|E
5|$|The actual welding {{technique}} utilized {{depends on the}} electrode, {{the composition of the}} workpiece, and the position of the joint being welded. The choice of electrode and welding position also determine the welding speed. Flat welds require the least operator <b>skill,</b> <b>and</b> can be done with electrodes that melt quickly but solidify slowly. This permits higher welding speeds.|$|E

Sports historian Richard Witzig recommends that footballers attempt executing a bicycle kick with a focused and determined state of mind. Due to the action's complexity, a successfully executed bicycle kick is notable and, according to sports journalist Elliott Turner, prone to awe audiences.

Available in ten language versions (CZ, DE, EN, ES, FR, HU, IT, LT, SE, SK), DISCO is meant to support transnational comparability of competences acquired in an educational or work context throughout Europe.|$|R

Another key practice was to overwhelm visitors by sumptuous displays.
