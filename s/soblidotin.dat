40|$|Abstract. Background: TZT- 1027 (<b>Soblidotin),</b> a microtubule-depolymerizing agent, has antivascular {{activity}} which disrupts {{newly formed}} tumor vasculature. In this study, it was investigated whether TZT- 1027 has also antiangiogenic activity preventing neovascularization. Materials and Methods: Antiangiogenic activities were evaluated in vivo in a chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay and in vitro in a tube formation assay on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). RT-PCR and skimmed milk zymography {{analyses were performed}} to clarify the involvement of angiogenesis-related proteolytic enzymes and transcription factors. Results: TZT- 1027 at doses of 0. 01 and 0. 06 Ìg/egg showed potent antiangiogenic activities in the CAM assay (80 % and 100 % inhibition, respectively), with no lethal toxicity to the chick embryo. TZT- 1027 at doses of 0. 01 - 10 ng/mL prevente...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Background: TZT- 1027 (<b>Soblidotin),</b> an anti-microtubule drug, {{has shown}} potent {{antitumor}} efficacy in various antitumor models, and has entered into phase I clinical trials. To determine those anticancer drugs {{to be combined}} with TZT- 1027 in clinical trials, the combination effects of TZT- 1027 with other anticancer drugs were examined. Materials and Methods: Two in vivo antitumor models, the murine P 388 leukemia ascites tumor model and the human {{non-small cell lung cancer}} A 549 solid tumor model, were used and cisplatin (CDDP), gemcitabine (GEM), irinotecan hydrochloride (CPT- 11), fluorouracil (5 -FU), paclitaxel (PTX) and docetaxel (DTX) were selected to be combined with TZT- 1027. Regarding the schedule of combination administration, simultaneous administration and sequential administration (TZT- 1027 first and combined drugs administered 24 h later, and vice versa) were employed.

40|$|The tubulin vinca domain is {{the target}} of widely {{different}} microtubule inhibitors that interfere with the binding of vinblastine. Although all these ligands inhibit the hydrolysis of GTP, they affect nucleotide exchange to variable extents. The structures of two vinca domain antimitotic peptides—phomopsin A and <b>soblidotin</b> (a dolastatin 10 analogue) —bound to tubulin in a complex with a stathmin-like domain show that their sites partly overlap with that of vinblastine and extend {{the definition of the}} vinca domain. The structural data, together with the biochemical results from the ligands we studied, highlight two main contributors in nucleotide exchange: the flexibility of the tubulin subunits' arrangement at their interfaces and the residues in the carboxy-terminal part of the β-tubulin H 6 –H 7 loop. The structures also highlight common features of the mechanisms by which vinca domain ligands favour curved tubulin assemblies and destabilize microtubules...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{years of}} research, {{little is known}} about the {{specific}} cause of Parkinson's disease (PD), though genetic and environmental factors have been implicated. Evidence suggests that microtubule disruption may be involved; however this mechanism is not yet fully elucidated, and factors implicated in PD have not been conclusively related to microtubule function. This is the framework of this thesis. We have expanded on a suggested PD cascade involving microtubule disruption triggering oxidization of dopamine, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), aggregation of alpha-synuclein, and death of neuronal cells. We have provided computational and relational evidence demonstrating how factors implicated in PD may relate to microtubule disruption and reactive oxygen species (ROS). We selected 6 potentially PD-related compounds: rotenone, MPTP/MPP+, toluene, saccharin, and aspartame, and compared them to 4 tubulin inhibitors: colchicine, vinblastine, <b>soblidotin,</b> and taxol; identifying ~ 62 % chemical similarity between rotenone and colchicine and ~ 78 % similarity between aspartame and <b>soblidotin.</b> We performed molecular docking calculations for the potentially PD-related compounds at the binding sites of the tubulin inhibitors on tubulin dimers and found that all potentially PD-related molecules demonstrated lowest (strongest) binding affinities on the colchicine site of tubulin. Rotenone and aspartame demonstrated significant binding affinities of 10. 7 and - 8. 7 kcal/mole, comparable to affinities of compounds on their known receptors (- 15. 0 to - 9. 2 kcal/mole). As compounds would need to enter the bloodstream and cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) to enact damage that could trigger PD, we illustrated that all potentially PD-related compounds evaluated meet criteria for potential to cross the BBB, and that all but one (aspartame) have been proven to enter the bloodstream. We hypothesized that aspartame, believed to not enter the bloodstream after digestion, may potentially be absorbed sublingually. We compared aspartame to known sublingual drugs and noted comparable logP and molecular weight values. Lastly, we demonstrated via molecular docking probable methods of aggregation of alpha synuclein (á-syn) fibrils and probable mechanisms of two á-syn aggregation inhibitors, curcumin and geldanamycin. We have thus provided a collective body of evidence to help substantiate the hypothesis that PD may be triggered by tubulin inhibition leading to excessive ROS production, triggering a PD cascade...|$|E
40|$|Microtubules are {{dynamic and}} {{structural}} cellular components involved in several cell functions, including cell shape, motility, and intracellular trafficking. In proliferating cells, they are essential {{components in the}} division process through {{the formation of the}} mitotic spindle. As a result of these functions, tubulin and microtubules are targets for anticancer agents. Microtubule-targeting agents can be divided into two groups: microtubule-stabilizing, and microtubule-destabilizing agents. The former bind to the tubulin polymer and stabilize microtubules, while the latter bind to the tubulin dimers and destabilize microtubules. Alteration of tubulin-microtubule equilibrium determines the disruption of the mitotic spindle, halting the cell cycle at the metaphase-anaphase transition and, eventually, resulting in cell death. Clinical application of earlier microtubule inhibitors, however, unfortunately showed several limits, such as neurological and bone marrow toxicity and the emergence of drug-resistant tumor cells. Here we review several natural and synthetic microtubule-targeting agents, which showed antitumor activity and increased efficacy in comparison to traditional drugs in various preclinical and clinical studies. Cryptophycins, combretastatins, ombrabulin, <b>soblidotin,</b> D- 24851, epothilones and discodermolide were used in clinical trials. Some of them showed antiangiogenic and antivascular activity and others showed the ability to overcome multidrug resistance, supporting their possible use in chemotherapy...|$|E
40|$|Marine {{cyanobacteria}} are prolific {{producers of}} structurally intriguing and biologically important secondary metabolites, {{many of which}} are of mixed NRPS/PKS biosynthetic origins, and have a broad range of biological activity, including ion channel modulation, cancer cell toxicity, anti-parasitic, anti-bacterial, anti- inflammatory, brine shrimp toxicity, and molluscicidal. Presently, there is one clinically approved drug that is an analog of the cyanobacterial natural product, dolastatin 10, while there are several agents in clinical trial, including <b>soblidotin</b> and synthadotin, which are analogs of dolastatin 15 and 10, respectively. Additionally, others are currently undergoing preclinical evaluation as anti-cancer agents, including apratoxin F, curacin A, desmethoxymajusculamide C (DMMC) and somacystinamide. The primary research objective of the research herein was to isolate and elucidate the structures of biologically active secondary metabolites from tropical marine cyanobacteria. In total, fifteen novel compounds from either Oscillatoria or Moorea were isolated and characterized. These include thirteen highly modified peptides (veraguamides A-C and H-L, precarriebowmide, tasiamides C-E, and lyngbyabellin N) and two alkyl amides (parguerene and mooreamide). The planar structure elucidation of each of these metabolites involved the use of 2 D NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry techniques, including a mass spectrometry based dereplication algorithm to deduce the planar structure of several of the modified peptides. Absolute stereochemical analysis involved many techniques, such as Marfey's analysis, semi-synthesis, ³J coupling constant analysis, circular dichroism, ¹³C NMR comparisions, NOE correlations, and chiral GCMS analysis. Many of these compounds were biologically evaluated with veraguamide A and lyngbyabellin N exhibiting cancer cell cytotoxicity [IC₅₀ = 141 nM (H- 460) and IC₅₀ = 40. 9 (HCT- 116), respectively], and mooreamide exhibiting cannabinoid receptor binding activity (Ki = 0. 47 [mu]M). A secondary research objective has been the structure-activity relationship (SAR) study to investigate the active pharmacophore in the lyngbyamide family of compounds, which consist of a cyclopropyl fatty acid (tail) and an amide head group. In total, 50 analogs were synythesized, designed to probe the importance of several structural characteristics of the lyngbyamides. These compounds were tested in a wide array of biological assays, and a subset were found to possess strong activity in the stabilization of cathepsin L-mediated proteolysis, brine shrimp toxicity, and surface tension suppressio...|$|E
