Chris also appears in the 2017 {{computer}} animated film , set in the same continuity as the video games, {{as one of the}} co-protagonists. The character has been well received by critics, being {{considered one of the most}} important characters in the franchise, and recognized for his <b>sex</b> <b>appeal.</b> His redesign in Resident Evil 5 has been the source of both praise and criticism from critics and fans alike.|$|E
5|$|Cortana's {{original}} design {{was based on}} the Egyptian queen Nefertiti; the character's holographic representation always {{takes the form of a}} woman. Bungie first introduced Cortana—and Halo—through the Cortana Letters, emails sent during Combat Evolveds production in 1999. Since then, the character has been used extensively to advertise the series. Cortana has been recognized for her believability and character depth, and her holographic representation has been noted for its <b>sex</b> <b>appeal.</b> The character was the inspiration for Microsoft's intelligent personal assistant.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to determining the overall creative strategy, the advertiser {{also needs to}} consider the creative execution - which refers to {{the way that the}} message is presented. Examples of creative execution include: problem-solution formats, fear <b>appeals,</b> <b>sex</b> <b>appeals,</b> humour, parody, slogans or jingles, mnemonics, slice-of-life, guarantee, celebrity endorsement, testimonial, news style, scientific appeals, dramatisation and product demonstration.|$|R

It {{was the fifth}} largest {{television}} audience of all the sports at the 2000 Games. Much of the interest {{was because of the}} <b>sex</b> <b>appeal</b> of bikini-clad players along with their athletic ability. Bikini-clad dancers and cheerleaders entertain the audience during match breaks in many beach volleyball tournaments, including the Olympics. Even indoor volleyball costumes followed suit to become smaller and tighter.|$|E

40|$|The use {{of words}} and images which {{explicitly}} or implicitly convey sexual meanings in selling messages has been commonplace in {{the recent history of}} the advertising industry. Many brands, such as Calvin Klein, Guess, and Victoria’s Secret, have set a high bar for provocative nudity and sexual fire (Reichert, 2003). The manner in which <b>sex</b> <b>appeals</b> are presented in television advertising has received some attention (Downs & Harrison, 1985; Lovdal, 1989; Lin, 1998). This thesis will investigate the use of sexual themes in television advertising in Britain and China. Sexual themes have featured as an important aspect of advertising since the earliest days of media advertising in the 19 th century (Reichert, 2003). These themes have continued to be used and their use in advertising has expanded and diversified. Whilst sexual themes in television advertising have been studied in Britain previously, there is little research of this kind in China. The use of sexual themes in Chinese advertising has risen along with economic growth; however, no systematic research has yet been carried out into the ways these themes are deployed in advertising in China. This thesis attempts to gain a comprehensive understanding of what ‘sex’ in advertising is, how it is represented in Chinese advertising, and how it works to affect audiences or even the whole Chinese society. This thesis also contributes {{to an understanding of the}} differences and similarities in how <b>sex</b> <b>appeals</b> are presented in China and Britain. [Taken from the Introduction...|$|R
40|$|Anecdotal {{evidence}} suggests that the use of sexual appeals in alcohol advertising is increasing. It has been shown that the use of <b>sex</b> <b>appeals</b> may result in a more negative attitude towards the brand, particularly among female consumers. This study investigates the proposition that this is the effect of feminist ideology rather than, or in addition to, biological gender. The results show that female respondents have more negative attitudes towards alcohol advertisements utilizing overt (or demeaning) sexual appeals than males and more positive attitudes towards alcohol advertisements utilizing feminist (empowering) appeals than males; and that there is no consistent independent effect of self-reported feminism...|$|R
40|$|There is {{considerable}} ongoing debate in Australia, {{as in other}} countries, about the ethicality of current advertising practices. In recent {{years there has been}} an increase in the public focus on offensive or unacceptable advertising – such as overt <b>sex</b> <b>appeals,</b> racial vilification, and promotion of unsafe use of consumer products – arguing that many of these advertisements (ads) are contrary to community standards. The industry, on the other hand, argues that it produces ads that are designed to meet and appeal to community standards. There is no comprehensive data on the nature of community standards in relation to advertising, and the purpose of the current study was to assess community attitudes towards current standards of advertising...|$|R
5|$|Larter defined Clear {{as a girl}} who's {{suffered}} numerous {{losses in}} her life, has fallen into herself, and has made a life within that. She broadened her description as an estranged artist who's holding to her grip for what the world has given her. In the original screenplay of James Wong and Glen Morgan, she is described as the loner in the group who wears dark colors to hide her <b>sex</b> <b>appeal,</b> something she's insecure about. Larter dyed her hair brunette {{for the majority of}} the film to suit Clear's gothic outlook. Despite this, Larter reverted to her original blonde hair colour for the film's ending.|$|E
5|$|Cooper's <b>sex</b> <b>appeal</b> {{has been}} noted by several media outlets {{including}} People magazine which named him Sexiest Man Alive in 2011. He was initially uncomfortable with the accolade, but later found it funny. Also in 2011, he was dubbed International Man of the Year by GQ and appeared in AskMen's 49 most influential men. He ranked tenth on Empire list of the 100 Sexiest Movie Stars in 2013. He {{was one of the}} highest-paid actors in the world from 2013 to 2015, earning $28 million, $46 million, and $41.5 million, respectively. Forbes ranked him first on their Celebrity 100: Ones To Watch list in 2013. In 2014 and 2015, he featured on Celebrity 100, a list based on the income and popularity of celebrities, as selected annually by Forbes. Time magazine named him one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2015.|$|E
5|$|Hoshino enjoyed drawing Lenalee's hair, despite {{finding her}} D.Gray-man {{character}} Yu Kanda's hair impossible to top. She enjoyed drawing Lenalee {{because of her}} personality, and her relationship with other series' characters such as Komui and Reever Wenhamm. Because her hair grew longer as the series went on, the author gave her different hairstyles. When the manga moved to Jump Square, a magazine for older readers, Hoshino decided to increase Lenalee's <b>sex</b> <b>appeal</b> by having her skirt shorter {{even though she is}} also wearing shorts beneath it. After Allen Walker became a fugitive from the Order, Hoshino wanted to have Lenalee chase after him, {{to the point where they}} would clash. When asked about Allen's farewell hug with Lenalee as he leaves the Order, Hoshino joked that she was happy with how Lenalee had matured, and at the same time become taller than Allen, in contrast to the beginning of the series when they were both the same height.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} investigates {{differences in}} men’s and women’s attitudes toward ads featuring product-relevant <b>sex</b> <b>appeals.</b> It is found that women, but not men, were more negative toward an ad featuring an attractive opposite-sex model when their commitment thoughts were heightened. Women {{were also more}} negative toward an ad with an attractive same-sex model {{in the presence of}} commitment thoughts, but only when they scored high on sociosexuality. Men appeared unaffected, regardless of their level of sociosexuality. Commitment thoughts were manipulated by two types of prime, a parenting prime (study 1) and a romantic prime (study 2). Results are explained by differences in how men and women react to sexual material and by differences in men’s and women’s evolved mating preferences...|$|R

40|$|Limited {{empirical}} research has investigated {{the impact of}} varying intensity levels of sexual-stimuli in print advertising on consumer behaviour together with the influence of sexual self-schema (SSS). Therefore, an exploratory experimental {{study was conducted with}} Australian women that examined the influence of explicit (high) versus mild (low) sexual stimuli intensity in print advertisements, and positive (high) versus negative (low) sexual self-schema levels on their reactions toward <b>sex</b> <b>appeals.</b> The results suggest that mild sexual-stimuli intensity has a more positive influence on women's attitudes and intended purchase behaviours, and that SSS has a limited influence. Further analysis suggests that the dimensionality of the SSS construct has shown divergent findings to prior U. S. centric research, calling for further studies to scrutinise the construct beyond this advertising context. Practitioner implications and future research directions are discussed...|$|R
5|$|Zeta-Jones {{initially}} established {{herself in}} Hollywood with roles that highlighted her <b>sex</b> <b>appeal</b> {{such as in}} the action film The Mask of Zorro (1998) and the heist film Entrapment (1999). Critics praised her portrayal of a vengeful pregnant woman in Traffic (2000) and a murderous singer in the musical Chicago (2002). The latter won her Academy and BAFTA Awards for Best Supporting Actress, among other accolades. She starred in high-profile films for much of the decade, including the black comedy Intolerable Cruelty (2003), the heist film Ocean's Twelve (2004), the comedy The Terminal (2004), and the romantic comedy No Reservations (2007). Parts in smaller-scale features were followed by a decrease in workload, during which she returned to stage and portrayed an ageing actress in A Little Night Music (2009), winning a Tony Award. Zeta-Jones continued to work intermittently in the 2010s, starring in the psychological thriller Side Effects (2013) and the action film Red 2 (2013).|$|E
5|$|As soon as late 1961, United Artists {{started a}} {{marketing}} campaign to make James Bond a well-known name in North America. Newspapers received a box set of Bond's books, {{as well as}} a booklet detailing the Bond character and a picture of Ursula Andress. Eon and United Artists made licensing deals revolving around the character's tastes, having merchandising tie-ins with drink, tobacco, men's clothing and car companies. The campaign also focused on Ian Fleming's name due to the minor success of the books. After Dr. No had a successful run in Europe, Sean Connery and Terence Young did a cross-country tour in March 1963, which featured screening previews for the film and press conferences. It culminated in a well-publicised premiere in Kingston, where most of the film is set. Some of the campaign emphasised the <b>sex</b> <b>appeal</b> of the film, with the poster artwork, by Mitchell Hooks, depicting Sean Connery and four scantily clad women. The campaign also included the 007 logo designed by Joseph Caroff with a pistol as part of the seven.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} investigates {{differences and}} similarities {{between men and}} women in their spontaneous reactions to gratuitous sexual appeals in advertising. Earlier research suggests that both males and females will react negatively to such ads because of perceptions of unethicality, manipulativeness, etc. However, we hypothesize and find that, under the sort of constrained processing conditions that allow the elicitation of spontaneous, gut-level reactions, men on average will exhibit a more positive attitudinal response to gratuitous <b>sex</b> <b>appeals</b> than women (Experiments 1 and 2). Experiment 3 then provides support for the underlying process - and also demonstrates intragender variation-by showing that women with more liberal attitudes to sex per se react in a manner very similar to men; namely, they report more liking for a sexual ad than a nonsexual ad.

A preference for taller men's larger penis size was notable.|$|E
50|$|Dalelv's {{boss was}} jailed for 13 months for alcohol {{consumption}} and having consensual <b>sex.</b> Dalelv <b>appealed</b> the conviction {{and had a}} hearing scheduled for September 2013, but she was pardoned on 22 July, {{a few days after}} Norwegian media reported the news and after it had drawn extensive international media attention, which caused an uproar on both social media and traditional Western media outlets. Human rights activists and politicians expressed strong criticism of the Dubai justice system's handling of the incident. In Norway the criticism, as first expressed by professor in religious studies, Dag Øistein Endsjø, was mainly against the initial lack of official Norwegian reaction against what was considered a human rights violation against a Norwegian citizen.

40|$|Mimicry Deception Theory (MDT) is a {{theoretical}} framework used to analyze deception in terms of long- vs. short-term strategies employed by the deceiver. Grooming behaviors used by sex offenders to access child victims and to prolong the abuse while minimizing detection are a specific form of deception. We conducted two studies, coding 121 and 164 court reports of <b>sex</b> abuse <b>appeal</b> cases with child victims. Grooming that was more complex in nature was associated with abuse that lasted longer and was more difficult to detect. Further, victim vulnerabilities contributed {{to a sense of}} confusion in the victim, and a decreased likelihood of disclosure. Thus, initial support emerged for finding the five components of MDT (victim selection, community integration, complexity of deception, resource extraction, and detectability) among victim grooming patterns in cases of sexually abused children. Recommendations for prevention efforts are discussed. ...|$|R

25|$|Before Loving v. Virginia, {{there had}} been several cases {{on the subject of}} interracial sexual relations. Within the state of Virginia, on Oct. 3, 1878, in Kinney v. The Commonwealth, the Supreme Court of Virginia ruled that the {{marriage}} legalized in Washington, D.C. between Andrew Kinney, a black man, and Mahala Miller, a white woman, was “invalid” in Virginia. In the national case of Pace v. Alabama (1883), the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that the conviction of an Alabama couple for interracial <b>sex,</b> affirmed on <b>appeal</b> by the Alabama Supreme Court, did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment. Interracial marital sex was deemed a felony, whereas extramarital sex ("adultery or fornication") was only a misdemeanor. On appeal, the United States Supreme Court ruled that the criminalization of interracial sex was not a violation of the equal protection clause because whites and non-whites were punished in equal measure for the offense of engaging in interracial sex. The court did not need to affirm the constitutionality of the ban on interracial marriage that was also part of Alabama's anti-miscegenation law, since the plaintiff, Mr. Pace, had chosen not to appeal that section of the law. After Pace v. Alabama, the constitutionality of anti-miscegenation laws banning marriage and sex between whites and non-whites remained unchallenged until the 1920s.|$|R
