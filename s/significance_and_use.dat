5000|$|A highly {{developed}} Information Culture leads {{the organization to}} success and work as a strategic goal that positively associated with organizational practices and performance. Choo et al. looked at Information Culture as the socially shared patterns of behaviors, norms and values that define the <b>significance</b> <b>and</b> <b>use</b> of information in an organization. Also, scholars like Manuel Castells posits that the Information Culture transcends the confines of organizations and government participation through policies is relevant for achieving the norms and values. Norms are standards and values are beliefs and together they mold the information behavior as normal that are expected by the people in organization. In so far, information behavior is the reflection of cultural norms and values. Marchand, Kettinger and Rollins identifies six information behaviors and values to profile an organization's Information Culture: ...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Starch gel {{electrophoresis}} {{was employed to}} generate Isozyme gene markers In Persian walnut, Juglans regia, and Northern California black walnut, J. hindsii. Two en-zyme systems, glucose phosphate isomerase (GPI) and aspartate amlno transferase (AAT), were useful for identification of these two species. Isozymes of these two enzyme systems in callus tissues and leaves from both juvenile and adult trees showed no differ-ences. Genetic analysis revealed one GPI (Qpl- 2) and two AAT loci (Aat- 1 and Aat- 2) that were simply inherited. Tests for linkage Indicated independent assortment for both GPI and AAT loci in these walnut species. The <b>significance</b> <b>and</b> <b>use</b> of these enzyme loci in genetic improvement of walnut species Is discussed...|$|E

40|$|Summary: Statistical {{parametric}} maps (SPMs) {{are potentially}} powerful ways of localizing differences in regional cerebral activity. This potential {{is limited by}} uncertainties in assessing {{the significance of these}} maps. In this report, we describe an approach that may partially resolve this issue. A distinction is made between using SPMs as images of change <b>significance</b> <b>and</b> <b>using</b> them to identify foci of significant change. In the first case, the SPM can be reported nonselectively as a single mathematical object with its omnibus significance. Alternatively, the SPM constitutes a large number of repeated measures over the brain. To reject the null hypothesis, that no change has occurred at a specific location, a threshold adjustment must be made that accounts for the large number of comparisons made. This adjustment is shown to depend o...|$|R
