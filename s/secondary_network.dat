40|$|In {{cognitive}} radio networks, cooperation between {{primary and secondary}} users can enhance the spectrum leasing and eventually improve each network's performance. In this paper, {{we focus on the}} cooperation between primary <b>network</b> and multiple <b>secondary</b> <b>networks.</b> We propose a cooperative communication-aware spectrum leasing framework, in which the primary <b>network</b> leverages <b>secondary</b> APs as cooperative relays, and decides the optimal strategy on the relay selection and the price for spectrum leasing. Based on primary <b>network's</b> strategy, <b>secondary</b> <b>networks</b> determine the length of spectrum access time they purchase from the primary network. The above sequential decision procedure is formulated as a Stackelberg game, with primary network acting as the leader and <b>secondary</b> <b>networks</b> as the followers, and a unique Nash Equilibrium (NE) point is achieved through backward induction analysis. At this NE point, all networks maximize their utilities in terms of transmission rate and revenue/payment.

5000|$|If {{there is}} a fault on the primary feeder, the {{substation}} circuit-breaker is meant to open, disconnecting the primary feeder from one side. The problem is that this primary cable is also connected to a network transformer, which is interconnected to other network transformers on its secondary side. The <b>secondary</b> <b>network</b> will energize the primary feeder through the network transformer. This can be very dangerous, because a fault {{will continue to be}} 'fed' from the <b>secondary</b> <b>network</b> side of transformer. Even without a fault, if the electric utility wants to perform maintenance on that primary cable, they must have a way to fully disconnect that primary cable, without worrying about the cable being energized by the <b>secondary</b> <b>network</b> through the network transformer.

40|$|Abstract—The {{dominant}} {{spectrum sharing}} paradigm of {{today is the}} interweave paradigm. This paper advocates a new and alternative paradigm called United network of Primary and <b>Secondary</b> <b>networks</b> (UPS). UPS allows a complete cooperation between primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>networks</b> at the node level to relay each other’s traffic, in addition to existing dynamic spectrum access (DSA) in time, space, and frequency domains. Such cooperation allows the primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>networks</b> to access a much richer network resources from the combined network. As a case study, we consider {{a problem with the}} goal of supporting the rate requirement of the primary network traffic while maximizing the minimum throughput of the secondary sessions. For this problem, we develop an optimization model and formulate a combinatorial optimization problem. Although this problem {{is in the form of}} mixed integer linear program (MILP), we can use CPLEX to solve it efficiently. Simulation results show that the UPS paradigm offers much better throughput performance than the interweave DSA paradigm. I...|$|R

30|$|Meanwhile, the {{recently}} proposed cognitive radio (CR) technology {{is able to}} address the spectrum scarcity problem by allowing the secondary users who have no licensed spectrum band to share the spectrum bands licensed to the primary users [2]. In {{order to protect the}} licensed primary users, the activities of the secondary users cannot affect the QoS of the primary users. Various problems in CR networks have been studied, such as resource allocation [3 – 8] and security issues [9, 10]. Generally, if the primary users cannot benefit from allowing the secondary users to transmit using their licensed spectrum bands, the primary users have no incentive to do so. Therefore, in the situation where the primary networks are overloaded and the <b>secondary</b> <b>networks</b> are light loaded, some primary users can direct their data traffic to the <b>secondary</b> <b>networks</b> for better service experience, and as a reward for the <b>secondary</b> <b>networks,</b> they can access the licensed spectrum bands as long as the QoS of the primary users is satisfied.

40|$|Abstract—Spectrum sensing is an {{essential}} functionality of cognitive radio networks. However, the effect of errors in the spectrum sensing process {{on the performance of}} the multiple access layer of both primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>networks</b> has not gained much attention. This paper aims at bridging the gap between the study of spectrum sensing and the multiple access of cognitive radio networks. To achieve this goal we pose and answer the question how the spectrum sensing errors affects the performance of cognitive radio networks from a multiple access protocol design point of view. The negative effects of the spectrum sensing errors on the throughput of both primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>networks</b> are characterized through queuing theory analysis of both networks. To alleviate these negative effects a novel joint design of the spectrum sensing and channel access mechanisms is proposed. This design is based on the observation that, in a binary hypothesis testing problem, the value of the test statistics {{could be used as a}} confidence measure for the test outcome. Therefore, this value will be used to define different channel access probabilities for secondary users. Results reveal asignificant performance improvement in the maximum stable throughput of both primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>networks</b> by virtue of the proposed technique.
