5000|$|The [...]44 Remington Magnum 96/44 feeds from a four-round rotary magazine. It {{does not}} share {{magazines}} with the Ruger 77/44. The action of the 96/44 does not anchor itself directly to the stock with an action screw as almost all rifles do. There is a block {{on the underside of}} the barrel that is threaded for the action <b>screw.</b> The <b>stock</b> is attached to the barrel, and the barrel to the action. The rifled barrel has a twist rate of 1 turn in 20", allowing heavy hunting bullets to stabilize. This is relatively rare for [...]44 Magnum firearms, which usually are rifled at a rate of 1 turn in 38 inches. The 1:20" [...] twist enables the use of 325gr ammunition for hunting large game.|$|R

50|$|There {{were few}} {{variations}} of the Model 1861 Navy Colt. Approximately 100 of the first guns made had fluted cylinders with no cylinder scene. Another 100, made between the serial ranges of 11,000 and 14,000 were cut for a shoulder stock - the lower portion of the recoil shield was milled away and a fourth <b>screw</b> for the <b>stock</b> {{was added to the}} frame. With the exception of the first fifty or so of this model, all guns had a capping groove. A brass trigger guard and back strap, silver-plated, were standard. The cylinders of the Navy 1851 and 1861 Navy Colt revolvers are engraved with a scene of the victory of the Second Texas Navy at the Battle of Campeche on May 16, 1843. The engraving was provided by Waterman Ormsby.|$|R
50|$|The striker of the Model 69 was cocked by {{the closing}} {{motion of the}} bolt, and the safety was {{actuated}} by grasping the cocking piece {{at the rear of}} the bolt, drawing it back, and rotating it, an arrangement similar to the Mosin-Nagant. The Model 69 used the same standard 5-round box magazine as the Models 52, 56, 57 and 75, allowing optional 10-round magazines and single-shot adapters to be shared. The magazine was released by depressing a spring-loaded button on the left-hand side of the stock, which was made of plain uncheckered walnut and had a pronounced pistol grip. The rifle was a takedown design; the barreled action was easily removed by turning a <b>screw</b> under the <b>stock</b> using a penny. A removable sheetmetal hood for the front sight was available. Rear sight choices included a barrel-mounted buckhorn sight that was drift-adjustable for windage and a more sophisticated receiver-mounted peep sight. A composition buttplate was used on all models.|$|R
5000|$|Winchester {{had already}} {{embarked}} on a program to reduce the production costs of the entry-level Model 60, resulting in the new Model 67, and {{the design of a}} similar lower-priced target rifle was a logical next step. As with the Model 60 from which they were derived, the cocking piece {{at the rear of the}} bolt had to be manually drawn rearwards to cock the action after closing the bolt, but the new rifles featured a wing-style safety with more easily visible [...] "SAFE" [...] and [...] "FIRE" [...] indications. The front sight of the Model 68 was a Model 97A with a removable sheetmetal hood and the rear sight was a Model 96A, featuring a removable disc, which had a smaller aperture better suited for target shooting. With the insert removed, the sight was less accurate but offered more light—making it better for small game hunting and informal plinking. Both rifles featured a stock made of plain uncheckered walnut with a pistol grip and finger grooves, and both were takedown designs; the barreled action was easily removed by turning a <b>screw</b> under the <b>stock</b> using a penny.|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE. This study {{examined}} the effects of the abutment types and dynamic loading on the stability of implant prostheses with three types of implant abutments prepared using different fabrication methods by measuring removal torque both before and after dynamic loading. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Three groups of abutments were produced using different types of fabrication methods; stock abutment, gold cast abutment, and CAD/CAM custom abutment. A customized jig was fabricated to apply the load at 30 ° to the long axis. The implant fixtures were fixed to the jig, and connected to the abutments with a 30 Ncm tightening torque. A sine curved dynamic load was applied for 105 cycles between 25 and 250 N at 14 Hz. Removal torque before loading and after loading were evaluated. The SPSS was used for statistical analysis of the results. A Kruskal-Wallis test was performed to compare screw loosening between the abutment systems. A Wilcoxon signed-rank test was performed to compare screw loosening between before and after loading in each group (α= 0. 05). RESULTS. Removal torque value before loading and after loading was the highest in stock abutment, which was then followed by gold cast abutment and CAD/CAM custom abutment, but there were no significant differences. CONCLUSION. The abutment types did not have a significant influence on short term screw loosening. On the other hand, after 105 cycles dynamic loading, CAD/CAM custom abutment affected the initial <b>screw</b> loosening, but <b>stock</b> abutment and gold cast abutment did not.
