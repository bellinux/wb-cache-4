25|$|In a {{rectangular}} jet, the instability can show as asymmetric cell distortions. The asymmetry sends waves {{back to the}} nozzle which sets up a Class III feedback loop and a strong periodic dipole sound field; it is called screech tone. Powell first described the phenomenon and because of application to military aircraft and potential structural fatigue, much subsequent work has been done. The sound field is sufficiently intense for it to appear on a <b>shadowgraph</b> {{as shown in the}} figure on the right (from M.G. Davies) for {{a rectangular}} supersonic jet. The dipole nature of the source is clear by the phase reversal {{on either side of the}} jet. There is lateral motion of the shock cells that gives the dipole its axis.|$|E

The computations are validated by comparing experimental <b>shadowgraphs</b> with <b>shadowgraphs</b> created from the computed flowfields and by comparing the experimentally measured instability frequencies with computed frequencies. The numerical simulations use a logarithmic transformation of the species conservation equations {{as a way to}} reduce the grid requirements for computing shock-induced combustion. The transformation is applied to the Euler equations coupled to a detailed hydrogen-air chemical reaction mechanism with 13 species and 33 reactions. The resulting differential equations are solved using a finite volume formulation and a two-step predictor-corrector scheme to advance the solution in time. Results are presented and compared for both a flux-vector splitting scheme and an upwind TVD scheme. The computations add insight to the physical processes observed in the experiments and the numerical methods needed to simulate them. The usefulness of the ballistic-range experiments for the validation of numerical techniques and chemical kinetic models is also demonstrated...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present paper is to study, both {{experimentally}} and numerically, the interaction of a normal shock wave with a rectangular trench. The experimental part consists of a series of <b>shadowgraphs</b> taken {{in the course of a}} single shot at 20 µs time intervals. These <b>shadowgraphs</b> have clearly captured the main discontinuities which are present in the flow field, i. e., the shock wave penetration into the trench, its reflection from the various trench walls and the inception and evolution in time of contact surfaces and a vortex in the trench region. The experiments were conducted with two different incident shock wave Mach numbers: Ms. 1. 300 and 2. 085. The second part of the present paper contains a two-dimensional numerical solution performed by solving the hydrodynamic conservation laws -Euler equations- in plane-symmetric 2 -D space and time, using the GRP method at the experimental initial and boundary conditions.

40|$|International audienceUnderstanding and {{modeling}} {{the behavior of}} glass is an issue for certain aeronautical, military and civil applications. For example, parts of satellites and shuttles are made of glasses. During their lifetime, they are subjected to potentially damaging high velocity impacts. To determine the behavior of these structures during and after impact we used instrumented laser driven shock loading performed on high power intensity laser facilities. Transverse <b>shadowgraphs</b> of the front wave propagating inside the transparent material are collected at different times. These <b>shadowgraphs</b> provide information regarding the shock wave velocity. PDV or VISAR measurements provide time-resolved free surface velocity to determine material velocity when the shock wave breakout occurs. For some laser shots, shock wave corresponds to elastic wave then Hugoniot elastic limit may be determined. Under high pressure conditions glass permanently densifies and traces of such a plastic deformation are looked for {{on the path of}} the shock wave. Those experimental data are necessary to characterize the material behavior under such conditions and to model the mechanical behavior of glass structures. In this presentation we will present experimental results obtained for soda-lime silica glass samples loaded by laser induced shock...|$|R

40|$|Hypersonic wake flows {{behind the}} Aeroassist Flight Experiment (AFE) {{geometry}} are analyzed using two Navier-Stokes flow solvers. Many of the AFE wake features observed in ballistic-range <b>shadowgraphs</b> are simulated using a simple, two-dimensional semicylinder geometry at moderate angles of attack. At free-stream conditions corresponding to a Hypersonic Free Flight Facility (HFFF) AFE experiment, the three-dimensional base flow for the AFE geometry is computed using an ideal-gas, Navier-Stokes solver. The computed results agree reasonably {{well with the}} <b>shadowgraphs</b> taken at the HFFF. An ideal-gas and a nonequilibrium Navier-Stokes solver have been coupled and applied to the complete flow around the AFE vehicle at the free-stream conditions corresponding to a nomial trajectory point. Limitations of the coupled ideal-gas and nonequilibrium solution are discussed. The nonequilibrium base flow solution is analyzed for the wake radiation and the radiation profiles along various lines of sight are compared. Finally, the wake unsteadiness is predicted using experimental correlations and the numerical solutions. An adaptive grid code, SAGE, {{has been used in}} all the simulations to enhance the solution accuracy. The grid adaptation is found to be necessary in obtaining base flow solutions with accurate flow features...|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} two {{important}} characteristics of high density and high temperature plasmas formed in axial discharges are studied. In {{the first part}} an experimental investigation of the structure and {{the dynamics of the}} current sheath and its effects on targets in a 3. 3 kJ plasma focus are presented. <b>Shadowgraphs</b> are recorded {{in the presence of a}} flat disc target placed downstream of the anode. These <b>shadowgraphs</b> reveal that the disc target does not affect the dynamics of the focus when it is at the distance of 10 mm (the radius of the anode in our case) from the anode end. However, the <b>shadowgraphs</b> recorded with the disc target at a distance of 7 mm exhibit the sequential focusing phenomenon, i. e., the current sheath moves over the disc and forms a pinch beyond it, with the disc acting as a new anode. This sequential focusing is also confirmed by recording the voltage probe signal, neutron pulses and neutron flux. The <b>shadowgraphs</b> are also recorded in the presence of a wire target (1 -mm diameter) inserted along the pinch axis. The strong focusing of the current sheath onto the I-mm wire indicates that this small plasma focus machine can be used for focus-fiber experiments. In the second part the dynamics of a collapsing plasma column and the properties of micropinches formed in the collapsed plasma column in a low-inductance vacuum-spark discharge are studied. Time integrated single shot x-ray spectra of He-like and H-like ions and their corresponding n = 2, Li-like and He-like satellites of elements (S, Cl, Ca, Cr, and Fe) are recorded. The experimental spectra are compared with simulated spectra (using the code FL V), and the electron density and the temperature of the micropinch plasma are estimated. The dependence of electron density and temperature of the micropinch plasma on atomic number Z shows a fair agreement with the available data in the literature obtained using different diagnostic techniques. The electron temperature estimated from the spectra of H-like ions is higher than that from He-like ions which indicates that the plasma is ionizing. Vacuum ultraviolet spectroscopy of elements (Ti, Fe, and Mo) indicates that the transitions from the ionization stages (Ti XI, Ti XII, Fe XV, Fe XVI, Mo XIV, Mo XV, Mo XVI) are prominent. However, in the Ti spectrum strong transitions from lower ionization stages (Ti VII, Ti VIII) emerge when the spectrum is recorded in the presence of a small superposed axial magnetic field. The presence of this external magnetic field reduces the compression...|$|R

40|$|Introduction The ABG I {{acetabular}} insert is an ultra {{high molecular}} weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) component used in primary hip arthroplasty. Studies have shown early osteolysis and aseptic loosening of the ABG I uncemented cup compared with other implants. Theories advocate that loosening is initiated by the biological response to insert wear debris; wear volume and the distribution of particle size are considered to be important parameters. This study analysed explanted plastic inserts to identify any mechanical properties that may have contributed to early failure. Materials and Methods 21 ABG I acetabular components were revised due to aseptic loosening over a 16 month period. Silicone casts of the insert sockets were made and volumetric analysis performed using a <b>shadowgraphing</b> technique and a coordinate measuring machine (CMM). The UHMWPE inserts were divided into uniform pieces with a diamond-tipped microsaw and analysed for hardness, wear, stress and strain properties using a microhardness tool, pin-on-plate analysis and small punch testing. We performed identical tests on explanted inserts from other manufacturers. Results We present the findings of the above tests and provide suggestions as to why these particular implants are more prone to early failure when compared with other common implants. We also discuss the results of volumetric analysis by <b>shadowgraphing</b> compared with CMM...|$|R
