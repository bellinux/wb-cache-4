5|$|Consequently, {{when the}} Sisters of Death arrived in Mega-City One, they found Kraken there instead of Dredd. Finding Kraken to be {{vulnerable}} to manipulation by their psychic powers, as he was still torn by latent subconscious loyalty to his late master Judd, {{they were able to}} use him as their agent to free Judge Death from captivity and begin their conquest of the city. Had Dredd not resigned, they might not have found their task <b>so</b> <b>easy.</b> Dredd eventually returned to the city and defeated them.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} envisioned {{to take full}} {{advantage}} of the hardware, without the imposition of porting to older platforms like the PlayStation 3. The hardware let developers improve the particle system that lights Delsin's face up while he draws neon power from billboards and add detailed reflections to the game world. The increased memory bandwidth let the team render characters with higher fidelity. They found the PS4's simplified architecture <b>so</b> <b>easy</b> to work with that they were able to reach very high graphical quality even though the hardware was new.|$|E
5|$|Micro Machines was {{completed}} in September 1990. The game did not go through quality assurance, and as a result, a major bug that caused the game to crash was discovered near completion. The bug occurred when the player tried to reverse on the first race, and escaped notice because none of the testers thought to do so as {{they thought it was}} <b>so</b> <b>easy.</b> It was determined that just one binary bit was wrong, and a device that functioned like a miniature Game Genie was installed on the cartridges to correct it, as by the time the bug was discovered, there were plenty of ROM chips containing the bugged version. Micro Machines was released for the NES by Camerica in 1991. Nintendo wanted development halted because Codemasters did not have a licence from them, and sued Galoob over the sales of the Game Genie. Courts ruled in Galoob's favour (Nintendo appealed, but the ruling was upheld), but the legal issues meant that sales of the NES version were not as good as hoped.|$|E

5|$|The run starts by {{introducing}} two main antagonists, an aging politician, who {{is using a}} strange portal to enter other people's minds and commit crimes, and Mako, a cannibalistic mage who devours other magicians {{in order to obtain}} their power. Constantine's attempt to play them off one another only succeeds in making them join forces in a further plot. Constantine then traps them both with considerable ease, and questions how this has been <b>so</b> <b>easy.</b> It then becomes apparent that he has been manipulated by the 'Golden Child', his twin who did not survive childbirth, and has been manipulating events for the whole of the series, including his battle with cancer and many other events. He declines his twin's offer to merge souls, suspicious that his twin has been weakening his will in past years to make him accept this offer, choosing instead to take control of his own destiny.|$|E

25|$|At {{the fifteenth}} attempt {{since the war}} we won at Melbourne...It was then that I felt that the great Australian team was just {{beginning}} to deteriorate. The quality of the Test sides usually runs in cycles. A number of the batsmen who scored heavily on previous occasions found that Don Bradman had not spent hours at the wicket softening the bowling, and run-scoring against bowlers who were not tired was not <b>so</b> <b>easy.</b>|$|E
25|$|Other {{disadvantages}} {{of the system}} were not <b>so</b> <b>easy</b> to address. For example, the gull-wing design makes creating a convertible version of the car harder, as the hinges would be removed with the roof, and standard doors would be needed for the convertible. Mercedes did so when replacing the gullwing coupe altogether with the 300SL roadster in 1958. It was never a concern for DeLorean since no convertible version was ever planned.|$|E

25|$|Having played {{football}} for Cambridge against Oxford in the Varsity Match of 1890, Gosling {{was awarded a}} total of five England caps between 1892 and 1895, and showed himself – according to his contemporary G.O.

25|$|Because {{of safety}} issues, {{phosgene}} is often produced and consumed {{within the same}} plant, and extraordinary measures are made to contain it. It is listed on schedule 3 of the Chemical Weapons Convention: All production sites manufacturing more than 30 tonnes per year must be declared to the OPCW. Although less dangerous than many other chemical weapons, such as sarin, phosgene is still regarded as a viable chemical warfare agent because it is <b>so</b> <b>easy</b> to manufacture {{when compared to the}} production requirements of more technically advanced chemical weapons such as the first-generation nerve agent tabun.|$|E
25|$|In {{one extreme}} {{instance}} of self-censorship, the team explored an urban legend stating that a widely available material {{could be used}} to create an explosive. To their surprise, the seemingly unlikely legend proved true, but the material was <b>so</b> <b>easy</b> to obtain, and the resulting explosion so powerful, that the production team decided it would be irresponsible to allow such information to reach the general public, instead electing to destroy all footage of the experiment and agreeing never to speak of the incident. Only several years later, when DARPA solicited advice from the public regarding potentially unknown bomb risks, did Savage contact them about their discovery.|$|E

25|$|In {{the first}} year, 400 beer houses opened and within eight years there were 46,000 across the country, far outnumbering the {{combined}} total of long-established taverns, pubs, inns and hotels. Because it was <b>so</b> <b>easy</b> to obtain permission and the profits could be huge {{compared to the}} low cost of gaining permission, the number of beer houses was continuing to rise and in some towns nearly every other house in a street could be a beer house. Finally in 1869 the growth had to be checked by magisterial control and new licensing laws were introduced. Only then was it made harder to get a licence, and the licensing laws which operate today were formulated.|$|E
25|$|In 1353, Kantakouzenos {{was still}} hopeful that peace would be maintained, {{but in that}} year, John V {{launched}} a military attack on Matthew, thereby re-igniting the civil war. John V was demoted and exiled to the island of Tenedos, {{one of the few}} islands in the Aegean still under Byzantine control, while Kantakouzenos made his son Matthew co-emperor. John V would not give up <b>so</b> <b>easy</b> however, and in 1354 Ottoman troops began crossing over into Thrace in his support. The citizens of Constantinople became gripped with fear and in November of that same year, John V launched a successful coup with Genoan aid. Kantakouzenos now abdicated and retired to a monastery, where he would write his memoirs and thoughts until his death in 1383.|$|E
25|$|In this {{approach}} the so-called earlier 'rhythmic' manuscripts of unheightened neumes that carry {{a wealth of}} melo-rhythmic information but not of exact pitches, are compared in large tables of comparison with relevant later 'melodic' manuscripts' that are written on lines or use double alphabetic and neumes notation over the text, but as a rule have less rhythmic refinement compared to the earlier group. However, the comparison {{between the two groups}} has made it possible to correct what are obvious mistakes. In other instances it is not <b>so</b> <b>easy</b> to find a consensus. In 1984 Chris Hakkennes published his own transcription of the Graduale Triplex. He devised a new graphic adaptation of square notation 'simplex' in which he integrated the rhythmic indications of the two most relevant sources, that of Laon and Skt. Gallen.|$|E

25|$|Immanuel Kant {{regarded}} masturbation as {{a violation}} of the moral law. In the Metaphysics of Morals (1797) he made the a posteriori argument that 'such an unnatural use of one's sexual attributes' strikes 'everyone upon his thinking of it' as 'a violation of one's duty to himself', and suggested that it was regarded as immoral even to give it its proper name (unlike the case of the similarly undutiful act of suicide). He went on, however, to acknowledge that 'it is not <b>so</b> <b>easy</b> to produce a rational demonstration of the inadmissibility of that unnatural use', but ultimately concluded that its immorality lay in the fact that 'a man gives up his personality … when he uses himself merely as a means for the gratification of an animal drive'.|$|E
25|$|After World War II, Panufnik {{moved to}} Kraków {{where he found}} work {{composing}} film music for the Army Film Unit. Some of this inevitably was for propaganda films; Panufnik later recounted how for one film, The Electrification of the Villages, the director {{was unable to find}} a house without a supply of electricity, and had to demolish pylons and remove infrastructure in order to film it being built. Panufnik accepted the post of Principal Conductor with the Kraków Philharmonic Orchestra. He reconstructed some of his music that had been lost, starting with the Tragic Overture which was still fresh in his mind. Encouraged by this he also reconstructed his Piano Trio and Polish Peasant Songs. However, his first symphony did not prove <b>so</b> <b>easy</b> and, disappointed with the result, Panufnik decided that he would thereafter concentrate on composing new works.|$|E
25|$|Set goals: Groups {{that set}} clear, {{challenging}} goals outperform groups whose members have {{lost sight of}} their objectives. The group's goals should be relatively challenging, instead of being too easily accomplished. The advantages of working in a group are often lost when a task is <b>so</b> <b>easy</b> {{that it can be}} accomplished even when members of the group socially loaf. Thus, groups should ensure to set their standards high, but not so high that the goals are unattainable. Latham and Baldes (1975) assessed the practical significance of Locke's theory of goal setting by conducting an experiment with truck drivers who hauled logs from the woods to the mill. When the men were initially told to do their best when loading the logs, they carried only about 60% of the weight that they could legally haul. When the same drivers were later encouraged to reach a goal of hauling 94% of the legal limit, they increased their efficiency and met this specific goal. Thus, {{the results of this study}} show that performance improved immediately upon the assignment of a specific, challenging goal. Company cost accounting procedures indicated that this same increase in performance without goal setting would have required an expenditure of a quarter of a million dollars on the purchase of additional trucks alone. So this method of goal setting is extremely effective. Other research has found that clear goals can stimulate a number of other performance-enhancing processes, including increases in effort, better planning, more accurate monitoring of the quality of the groups work, and even an increased commitment to the group.|$|E
