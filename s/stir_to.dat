25|$|Dr. David M. Maurice (1922-2002), an eye {{specialist}} and semi-retired adjunct professor at Columbia University, proposed that REM sleep {{was associated with}} oxygen supply to the cornea, and that aqueous humor, the liquid between cornea and iris, was stagnant if not stirred. Among the supportive evidences, he calculated that if aqueous humor was stagnant, oxygen from iris had to reach cornea by diffusion through aqueous humor, which was not sufficient. According to the theory, when the animal is awake, eye movement (or cool environmental temperature) enables the aqueous humor to circulate. When the animal is sleeping, REM provides the much-needed <b>stir</b> <b>to</b> aqueous humor. This theory {{is consistent with the}} observation that fetuses, as well as eye-sealed newborn animals, spend much time in REM sleep, and that during a normal sleep, a person's REM sleep episodes become progressively longer deeper into the night. However, owls have REM sleep, but do not move their head more than in non-REM sleep and is well known that owls' eyes are nearly immobile.|$|E

In addition, the local parish priest, Don Fiorino Marengo, founded Produttori del Barbaresco cooperative cellar, the successor to Cavazza's original vision to make outstanding wine and stop the exodus of young farmers who were abandoning the countryside.|$|E

60|$|Faint cheers {{rose from}} {{scattered}} {{parts of the}} grand-stand, and here and there shouts and yells. The audience appeared to <b>stir,</b> <b>to</b> become animated, and the Herne players settled down to more sober action on the field.|$|E

60|$|When {{the table}} was set--such as it was--Brogard {{surveyed}} it with evident satisfaction. He then dusted {{one of the chairs}} with the corner of his blouse, gave a <b>stir</b> <b>to</b> the stock-pot, threw a fresh bundle of faggots on to the fire, and slouched out of the room.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, if your part's marked out I congratulate you, mademoiselle!"--and the old actress {{underlined}} {{the words}} as she had often underlined others on the stage.

6000|$|... 'Where!' cried Affery, goaded {{into another}} {{inspection}} of the keyhole. 'Where but here in this house?

60|$|Gale rushed {{from his}} cover to {{intercept}} the other raiders {{before they could}} reach the house and their weapons.
