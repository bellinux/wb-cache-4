The series uses the ISDN concepts as developed by the ITU-T and is also within the framework of standards for open systems interconnection as defined by ISO. It has been produced under ITSTC work items M-IT- 05 4. 3. 1. 1 and 4. 4 for Bon de commande 75 D. 5. This particular Standard defines the signalling protocol for use at the <b>S</b> <b>reference</b> <b>point</b> in support of basic circuit mode services. It is intended to be supported by a suitable layer 2 protocol, for example Standard ECMA- 105, in the D-channel of a basic access interface or a primary rate access interface. The 1 st Edition of Standard ECMA- 106 was published by ECMA in 1985. A 2 nd Edition was published by ECMA in June 1991, to extend the scope to include the connection of all types of Terminal Equipment to Private Telecommunication Networks, instead of just the connection of Data Processing Equipment to Private Circuit-Switching Networks, and to reflect work undeway in ETSI on the corresponding standard for public ISDNs in Europe. The protocol defined in this 3 rd Edition of Standard ECMA- 106 is based upon that now specified in ETS 300 102 - 1.

All linear dimensions were correlated with the CRL by bivariate allometry (1 n y = 1 n a+b 1 n x) : they all grew with positive allometry, except GO-GN with isometry. The mandibular ramus grew relatively faster than the body, both in length and height, and the greatest growth rate was found for ramus height. The relation between mandibular shape and the craniofacial structures was investigated using scale drawings obtained from photographs of fetal skulls in lateral view.

40|$|One of {{the main}} tools for {{including}} decision maker (DM) preferences in the multiobjective optimization (MO) literature {{is the use of}} <b>reference</b> <b>points</b> and achievement scalarizing functions [A. P. Wierzbicki, The use of reference objectives in multiobjective optimization, in: G. Fandel, T. Gal (Eds.), Multiple-Criteria Decision Making Theory and Application, Springer-Verlag, New York, 1980, pp. 469 - 486. ]. The core idea in these approaches is converting the original MO problem into a single-objective optimization problem {{through the use of a}} scalarizing function based on a <b>reference</b> <b>point.</b> As a result, a single efficient point adapted to the DM's preferences is obtained. However, a single solution can be less interesting than an approximation of the efficient set around this area, as stated for example by Deb in [K. Deb, J. Sundar, N. Udaya Bhaskara Rao, <b>S.</b> Chaudhuri, <b>Reference</b> <b>point</b> based multiobjective optimization using evolutionary algorithms, International Journal of Computational Intelligence Research, 2 (3) (2006) 273 - 286].

This concept will let us approximate the efficient set around the area of the most preferred point without using any scalarizing function.

40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three self contained, though interrelated chapters. In the first two chapters, I apply the behavioural model of reference dependence to two different games of incomplete information; auctions and bargaining. The main contribution of the models is that they pin down the reference point by endogenising it as the expected price of a good in equilibrium. Modelling games where the utility of a player depends on her beliefs over endogenous variables, introduces mathematical complexity. Indeed, such games lack an existence result, and in the final chapter, I extend methods available in the literature to provide sufficient conditions {{for the existence of}} monotone equilibrium in games with endogenous beliefs. In the first chapter, I model auctions where bidders have reference dependent preferences and may be loss averse. The reference point is defined either as the ex-ante or interim expected price of the good, depending on whether bidders are naive or sophisticated. Equilibrium with consistent reference points are shown to exist and are fully characterised. The model predicts that in equilibrium, bidders both overbid and underbid in comparison to the standard risk neutral Nash equilibrium. The second chapter extends the model a two player k-double auction, where players are assumed to have preferences that exhibit reference dependence. The expected price of the good is modelled as a player 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>reference</b> <b>point.</b> In equilibrium the endogenous reference point is said to be consistent if behaviour given the reference point, yields an expected price equal to the reference point itself. Bias is introduced as an exogenous deviation of the reference point from the expected price of the good. We study the effects of reference dependence and bias on the ex-post efficiency of the auction. In the absence of bias, reference dependence does not alter the efficiency of the model, however we find that efficiency is decreasing in the level of bias. In the final chapter, I consider a class of Bayesian games where an individual 2 ̆ 7 s payoff depends on her beliefs over the actions of her opponents. I model this feedback effect as endogenous (rational) beliefs over equilibrium outcomes, which are influenced by the actions of all players. A consistent Bayesian equilibrium is defined, where behaviour given equilibrium beliefs, yields the same beliefs on the equilibrium outcome. Sufficient conditions for equilibrium existence are listed; I use lattice theoretic techniques and exploit monotonicity of equilibrium strategies to show existence. Also provided are comparative static results with respect to the primitive type distributions. The model is then applied to two distinct sub-fields in economics; reference dependent preferences with endogenous reference points and Cournot markets with network effects...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{technical}} capabilities for monitoring deforestation from a pan-tropical perspective {{in response to}} the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) process, which is studying the technical issues surrounding the ability to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation in developing countries. The successful implementation of such policies requires effective forest monitoring systems that are reproducible, provide consistent results, meet standards for mapping accuracy, and can be implemented from national to pan-tropical levels. Remotely sensed data, supported by ground observations, are crucial to such efforts. Recent developments in global to regional monitoring of forests can contribute to reducing the uncertainties in estimates of emissions from deforestation. Monitoring systems at national levels in developing countries can also benefit from pan-tropical and regional observations, mainly by identifying hot spots of change and prioritizing areas for monitoring at finer spatial scales. A pan-tropical perspective is also required to ensure consistency between different national monitoring systems. Data sources already exist to determine baseline periods in the 1990 <b>s</b> as historical <b>reference</b> <b>points.</b> Key requirements for implementing such monitoring programs, both at pan-tropical and at national scales, are international commitment of resources to increase capacity, coordination of observations to ensure pan-tropical coverage, access to free or low-cost data, and standardized, consensus protocols for data interpretation and analysis.
