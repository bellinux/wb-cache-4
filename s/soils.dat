5|$|Abundant and widespread, A.obovatus {{occurs on}} a wide range of <b>soils,</b> favouring <b>soils</b> in the acidic pH range 3.9–5.4.

It also occurs on gravelly quartz sand derived from rock outcrops, such as on the rocky hillslopes of the Stirling Range. It is rarely found on gravelly lateritic <b>soils.</b> It is also one of the few Adenanthos species to grow well in moist environments; it will not tolerate seasonal waterlogging—that niche is filled by A.detmoldii—but thrives in damp <b>soils</b> not subject to waterlogging.|$|E

40|$|<b>Soil</b> {{respiration}} {{rates were}} measured along {{different parts of}} a slope in (a) an evergreen forest with common brown forest <b>soil</b> and (b) a deciduous forest with immature <b>soil.</b> The effects of <b>soil</b> temperature, <b>soil</b> moisture and <b>soil</b> properties were estimated individually, and the magnitudes of these effects in the deciduous and evergreen forests were compared. In the evergreen forest with common brown forest <b>soil,</b> <b>soil</b> properties had the greatest effect on <b>soil</b> respiration rates, followed by <b>soil</b> moisture and <b>soil</b> temperature. These results {{may be explained by}} the fact that different <b>soil</b> properties matured within different environments. It can be argued that the low <b>soil</b> respiration rates in the low parts of the slope in the evergreen forest resulted from <b>soil</b> properties and not from wet <b>soil</b> conditions. In the deciduous forest, <b>soil</b> respiration rates were more strongly affected by <b>soil</b> moisture and <b>soil</b> temperature than by <b>soil</b> properties.

(iii) <b>Soil</b> {{temperature}} and <b>soil</b> water content On the temporal scale, <b>soil</b> respiration rates {{were found to}} be driven by the seasonality of <b>soil</b> {{temperature and}} <b>soil</b> water content. The <b>soil</b> respiration rates were higher in the hot and humid season than in the cold and dry season. The combined <b>soil</b> temperature and <b>soil</b> water content model indicated that <b>soil</b> temperature positively contributed to the <b>soil</b> respiration rate. In addition, a bidirectional relationship was observed between <b>soil</b> respiration and <b>soil</b> water content. At the lowland plantations, higher <b>soil</b> water content led to higher <b>soil</b> respiration, whereas excessive amounts of water at the mid-elevation plantation limited the oxygen supply, yielding lower <b>soil</b> respiration.|$|R

5|$|Banksia serrata has {{a central}} taproot and few lateral roots. Clusters of fine {{branched}} proteoid roots up to 15cm (6in) long arise from larger roots.

5|$|Banksia serrata {{has shown}} a {{variable}} susceptibility to dieback from the pathogen Phytophthora cinnamomi, the plants in sandier <b>soils</b> showing more resistance than those in heavier <b>soils.</b> Plants from Wilsons Promontory were sensitive.

5|$|Banksia spinulosa var.spinulosa was {{introduced}} into cultivation in the United Kingdom in 1788 by Joseph Banks who supplied seed to Kew, Cambridge Botanic Gardens and Woburn Abbey among others; var.collina followed in 1800 and var.cunninghamii in 1822. It has proven a highly ornamental and bird-attracting plant in cultivation. Southern and montane provenance forms are frost hardy. In general, all forms prefer sandy, well-drained <b>soils</b> with sunny aspect, though some local forms hailing from Wianamatta shales may tolerate heavier <b>soils.</b> It is resistant to dieback, like most eastern banksias. As it grows naturally on acid <b>soils,</b> Banksia spinulosa is particularly sensitive to iron deficiency. Known as chlorosis, it manifests as yellowing of new leaves with preservation of green veins, and {{occurs when the}} plant is grown in <b>soils</b> of higher pH.

5|$|In the 1990s, Sauvignon blanc {{wines from}} the {{maritime}} climatic regions of New Zealand, particularly the South Island, became popular on the wine market. In the Marlborough Region, sandy <b>soils</b> over slate shingles {{have become the}} most desirable locations for plantings due to the good drainage of the soil and poor fertility that encourages the vine to concentrate its flavors in lower yields. In the flood plain of the Wairau River Valley, the soil runs in east-west bands across the area. This can create a wide diversity of flavors for vineyards that are planted north-south with the heavier <b>soils</b> producing more herbaceous wines from grapes that ripen late and vines planted in stonier <b>soils</b> ripening earlier and imparting more lush and tropical flavors.

5|$|Like most Proteaceae, T.truncata has fine proteoid {{roots that}} arise from larger roots. These are roots with dense {{clusters}} of short lateral rootlets that form a mat in the soil just below the leaf litter. They are particularly efficient at absorbing nutrients from nutrient-poor <b>soils,</b> including the phosphorus-deficient native <b>soils</b> of Australia. Waratah seeds are often eaten—and destroyed—by animals and do not travel far (just several metres) from the parent plants.|$|E
5|$|Like {{most other}} Proteaceae, B.ericifolia has proteoid roots—roots with dense {{clusters}} of short lateral rootlets that form a mat {{in the soil}} just below the leaf litter.

40|$|<b>Soil</b> {{electrical}} conductivity (ECa) is a <b>soil</b> quality indicator associated to attributes interesting to site-specific <b>soil</b> management such as <b>soil</b> moisture and texture. <b>Soil</b> ECa provides information that helps guide <b>soil</b> management decisions, so we performed spatial evaluation of <b>soil</b> moisture in two experimental fields in two consecutive years and modeled {{its influence on}} <b>soil</b> ECa. <b>Soil</b> ECa, moisture and clay content were evaluated by statistical, geostatistical and regression analyses. Semivariogram models, adjusted for <b>soil</b> moisture, had strong spatial dependence, but the relationship between <b>soil</b> moisture and <b>soil</b> ECa was obtained only {{in one of the}} experimental fields, where <b>soil</b> moisture and clay content range was higher. In this same field, coefficients of determinations between <b>soil</b> moisture and clay content were above 0. 70. In the second field, the low <b>soil</b> moisture and clay content range explain the absence of a relationship between <b>soil</b> ECa and <b>soil</b> moisture.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{quantify}} the effects of high <b>soil</b> water content and <b>soil</b> temperature on <b>soil</b> respiration. With an automatic system, <b>soil</b> respiration, <b>soil</b> water content, and <b>soil</b> temperature at 5 -cm depth were measured at 10 -min intervals for 22 days. The measurements were carried out at three locations with high <b>soil</b> water content and <b>soil</b> temperature. Results showed that <b>soil</b> respiration and <b>soil</b> water content were negatively correlated (P < 0. 01); rainfall did not stimulate any obvious pulse of <b>soil</b> respiration. There was an obvious hysteresis effect between <b>soil</b> respiration and <b>soil</b> temperature. Without considering the hysteresis effect, the temperature dependence parameter (q(10)) of <b>soil</b> respiration on <b>soil</b> temperature was underestimated. With the consideration of the hysteresis effect between <b>soil</b> temperature and <b>soil</b> respiration, the estimated q(10) values were in the range of 1. 2 to 2. 1, and the estimated basal respiration values were in the range of 0. 5 to 2. 5 mu mol m(- 2) sec(- 1) for the three measurement points. Based on more than 2, 200 data points, reasonable relationships in the diurnal scale were established between <b>soil</b> respiration and <b>soil</b> water content, as well as <b>soil</b> temperature.
