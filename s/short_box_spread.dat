40|$|<b>Box</b> <b>spread</b> is {{a trading}} {{strategy}} {{in which one}} simultaneously buys and sells options having the same underlying asset and time to expiration, but different exercise prices. This study examined the efficiency of European style S&P CNX Nifty Index options of National Stock Exchange, (NSE) India by making use of high-frequency data on put and call options written on Nifty (Time-stamped transactions data) for the time period between 1 st January 2002 and 31 st December 2005 using box-spread arbitrage strategy. The advantages of box-spreads include reduced joint hypothesis problem {{since there is no}} consideration of pricing model or market equilibrium, no consideration of inter-market non-synchronicity since trading <b>box</b> <b>spreads</b> involve only one market, computational simplicity with less chances of mis-specification error, estimation error and the fact that buying and selling <b>box</b> <b>spreads</b> more or less replicates risk-free lending and borrowing. One thousand three hundreds and fifty eight exercisable box-spreads were found for the time period considered of which 78 <b>Box</b> <b>spreads</b> were found to be profitable after incorporating transaction costs (32 profitable <b>box</b> <b>spreads</b> were identified for the year 2002, 19 in 2003, 14 in 2004 and 13 in 2005) The results of our study suggest that internal option market efficiency has improved over the years for S&P CNX Nifty Index options of NSE India...|$|R

5000|$|In futures trading, a <b>box</b> <b>spread</b> is {{a spread}} {{constructed}} from two consecutive butterfly spreads (also {{known as a}} [...] "double butterfly"), summing to +1 -3 +3 -1 in consecutive, or at least equally spaced, contracts. The term also has an alternative meaning {{within the context of}} inter-commodity spreads whereby it refers to either an inter-commodity spread within one month offset by the same inter-commodity spread but in another month (or alternatively a calendar spread for each respective instrument). Often presumed not to move much (as in theory they are practically non directional) they typically, but not always, trade in a range. The <b>box</b> <b>spread,</b> like normal butterfly and calendar spreads, derives it's hedging construction from characteristics of Pascal's Triangle.|$|R
5000|$|As another example, [...] "buying the Cal 13-12, SP-NP box spread", {{would be}} buying power at CAISO hub SP versus selling power at CAISO hub NP for 2013, while also doing the {{opposite}} (so, selling at SP and buying at NP) for 2012. (In some markets, a leg that is purchased is mentioned before a leg that is sold and commonly {{the more expensive}} leg is also mentioned first (to avoid using a negative spread price). Therefore, {{the way that the}} CAISO <b>box</b> <b>spread</b> is referred to suggests that SP is trading over NP, and SP-minus-NP is wider in 2013 than in 2012). Another pair of contracts that commonly trade <b>box</b> <b>spreads</b> are WTI and Brent crude oil, either in the form of intra-commodity calendar spreads for WTI and Brent using the same calendar expirations for each or different expiration WTI/Brent inter-commodity spreads. One motivation for trading a box would be to roll an existing two-leg spread position to another (typically later) time period. E.g., to roll one's existing 2012 SP-NP spread position out to 2013 (i.e., close 2012 and replace with 2013), or to trade the <b>box</b> <b>spread</b> itself by taking a view {{that there will be a}} widening or narrowing of the <b>spread</b> within the <b>box</b> itself.|$|R
50|$|By 1935 a {{fire brigade}} and {{ambulances}} {{were available to}} protect the town during emergencies. The Gamewell system of fire alarms was used and consisted of 16 alarm <b>boxes</b> <b>spread</b> throughout the district. Three motor ambulances and a motorised utility van were kept at the fire station, operated by permanent staff.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>box</b> <b>spread</b> {{position}} has a constant payoff at exercise {{equal to the}} difference in strike values. Thus, the 40-50 box example above is worth 10 at exercise. For this reason, a box is sometimes considered a [...] "pure interest rate play" [...] because buying one basically constitutes lending some money to the counterparty until exercise.|$|R

40|$|Este estudo avalia a atratividade, no mercado financeiro brasileiro, do <b>Box</b> <b>Spread,</b> uma estratégia envolvendo compra e venda de quatro opções que, em seu conjunto, possuem retorno certo e conhecido. Por suas características, a operação pode ser considerada um título de renda fixa sintético. Comparou-se simulações teóricas da estratégia com instrumentos tradicionais de renda fixa e chegou-se a conclusão que o box pode oferecer rentabilidade extraordinária, sem que isso seja justificado por risco ou falta de liquidez. Esse resultado contraria a hipótese do mercado eficiente, que afirma que os preços de mercado refletem todas as informações disponíveis e, portanto, que não existem oportunidades de ganho com arbitragem. A pesquisa, no entanto, enfrentou dificuldades metodológicas – em {{particular}} a impossibilidade de se garantir que os preços utilizados ocorreram simultaneamente - que podem ter impactado os resultados. Recomenda-se que futuros estudos revisitem o tema com o auxílio de recursos metodológicos mais sofisticados. This study {{assesses the}} attractiveness of the <b>Box</b> <b>Spread</b> in the Brazilian financial market. <b>Box</b> <b>Spread</b> is a strategy involving the purchase and sale of four options, which when put together have known and certain profitability. Due to its characteristics, the operation {{can be considered a}} synthetic bond. Theoretical simulations of the strategy were compared to traditional fixed income instruments. The study concludes that the box can offer extraordinary profitability that cannot be explained or justified by risk or illiquidity. This result contradicts the efficient market hypothesis, which states that market prices reflect all available information and therefore there are no arbitrage gain opportunities. The study, however, faced methodological difficulties, specially the impossibility of assuring the prices used in the simulation occurred simultaneously, which might have affected the results. It is recommended that future studies revisit the topic with the aid of more sophisticated methodological resources...|$|R
