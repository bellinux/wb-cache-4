Three new antibiotic drugs were introduced to the cure for tuberculosis in 1947: Streptomycin, Para-amino Salicylic Acid, and isoniazid. Tuberculosis was quick to become antibiotic-resistant, so rest and nutrition remained on the treatment plan. The average stay at Firland had been cut in half by 1954, and mortality rates dropped from 31% in 1948 to 6% in 1954. National officials called Firland [...] "one of the most outstanding sanatoria in the country". [...] Patients at Firland began to behave with less docility than in the past due to the high recovery rates and changing social expectations after World War II. Ward rules were relaxed, such as the extreme <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> <b>sexes.</b> Patient needs were addressed by newly hired social workers, psychologists, and psychiatrists.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{qualitative}} analyses that explore and present the representations of gender; however, feminists challenge these dominant ideologies concerning gender roles and biological sex. One's biological sex is directly tied to specific social roles and the expectations. Judith Butler considers {{the concept of}} being a woman to have more challenges, owing not only to society's viewing women as a social category {{but also as a}} felt sense of self, a culturally conditioned or constructed subjective identity. Social identity refers to the common identification with a collectivity or social category that creates a common culture among participants concerned. According to social identity theory, {{an important component of the}} self-concept is derived from memberships in social groups and categories; this is demonstrated by group processes and how inter-group relationships impact significantly on individuals' self perception and behaviors. The groups people belong to therefore provide members with the definition of who they are and how they should behave within their social sphere.Categorizing males and females into social roles creates a problem, because individuals feel they have to be at one end of a linear spectrum and must identify themselves as man or woman, rather than being allowed to choose a section in between. [...] Globally, communities interpret biological differences between men and women to create a set of social expectations that define the behaviors that are [...] "appropriate" [...] for men and women and determine women’s and men’s different access to rights, resources, power in society and health behaviors. Although the specific nature and degree of these differences vary from one society to the next, they still tend to typically favor men, creating an imbalance in power and gender inequalities within most societies. Many cultures have different systems of norms and beliefs based on gender, but there is no universal standard to a masculine or feminine role across all cultures. Social roles of men and women in relation to each other is based on the cultural norms of that society, which lead to the creation of gender systems. The gender system is the basis of social patterns in many societies, which include the <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> <b>sexes,</b> and the primacy of masculine norms.|$|E

Reproductive rights, that is rights relating to sexual reproduction and reproductive health, were first discussed as a subset of human rights at the United Nation's 1968 International Conference on Human Rights.|$|R

40|$|Managing {{reproduction}} for Canidae {{species is}} a challenge for zoological institutions and wildlife sanctuaries. There are four basic options for contraception: <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> <b>sexes,</b> surgical procedures, immunological and hormonal methods. Animal managers face potential challenges for each option, and advantages and disadvantages {{should be taken into}} consideration when making a decision. This paper evaluates four common Canidae species with results from hormonal monitoring: Gray wolves Canis lupus/Mexican gray wolves Canis lupus baileyi, Maned wolves Chrysocyon brachyurus, Fennec fox Vulpes zerda and African wild dogs Lycaon pictus. Special focus is given to individuals treated with the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist, Suprelorin®. To date there are considerably more data for African wild dogs than other canids, as extensive field observations are available for this species. Therefore, African wild dogs are more extensively covered in this paper. GnRH agonists have been designated the safest reversible method of contraception for carnivores and so continued studies are important. Results outlined below demonstrate individual dosing differences that occur not only across species but also between similar individuals. Although dosing and duration of efficacy still need further investigating, GnRH agonists are still considered to be the safest and most appropriate method available. As evident in this paper, contraception is a much-needed tool for reproductive management...|$|E

40|$|In two experiments, one {{carried in}} South Africa {{and the other}} in Western Australia, the {{duration}} of sperm storage and the fertile period following <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> <b>sexes</b> were investigated by egg break-out and by counting the sperm in the perivitelline membrane (spermOPVL) above the germinal disc (GD) region. Fertilisation status was determined by the appearance of the GD. The perivitelline membrane above the GD was collected to count sperm under fluorescence following staining with 4 ′, 6 ′-diamidino- 2 -phenyindole (DAPI). In both experiments, after the males were removed, the rate of lay declined by about 50 % within a week. Following separation, spermOPVL were detected for up to four weeks and fertilised eggs were laid for nearly the same duration. The loss of sperm followed an approximately logarithmic function and sperm numbers declined at rates {{similar to that of the}} turkey. Since the duration of sperm storage was longer than indicated by clutch duration, ostrich clutch size might be larger than reported or female ostriches might store sperm for up to two clutches. Fertilisation rate in ostrich eggs is high because most eggs contain excessive numbers of sperm and very low numbers of sperm appear sufficient to achieve fertilisation. Articl...|$|E
40|$|Mosses {{display a}} number of {{hallmark}} life history traits that influence their ecology at the population and community level. The long lived <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> <b>sexes</b> observed in the haploid gametophyte (dioicy) is one such feature of particular importance, as it is observed {{in the majority of}} bryophytes and creates intraspecific specialization of male and female individuals. The prevalence of sexually dimorphic mosses raises the possibility of sex-specific interactions with fungi as observed in some vascular plants. Here I investigated how moss sex shapes fungal communities associated with gametophytic tissues of the ubiquitous moss, Ceratodon purpureus. Using greenhouse populations of C. purpureus grown in a common garden, I examined fungal community structure and overall abundance of fungal biomass associated with male and female individuals from multiple populations. I hypothesized that individual mosses would harbor unique fungal communities based on their sex, and that overall fungal biomass associated with host tissues would differ significantly due to differences in morphological and physiological characteristics between the sexes. I found that fungal community composition and overall abundance (i. e. biomass) differ between male and female individuals of C. purpureus, and that sex-specific patterns are retained across individuals from three different populations. This work provides a first glance at how genetically based sexual systems in early land plants influence affiliated fungal community composition...|$|E

Cycads are a group of primitive dioecious plants that offers an extraordinary opportunity to study the emergence of dioecism in plant species.
