5|$|Czolgosz {{had lost}} his job during the {{economic}} Panic of 1893 and turned to anarchism, a political philosophy adhered to by recent killers of foreign leaders. Regarding McKinley {{as a symbol of}} oppression, Czolgosz was convinced that it was his duty as an anarchist to kill him. Unable to get near the President during the presidential visit earlier, Czolgosz shot McKinley twice as the President reached to <b>shake</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> in the reception line at the temple. One bullet grazed McKinley; the other entered his abdomen and was never found.|$|E
5|$|On June 6, the {{two major}} party campaigns crossed paths in Woodstock, Ontario. Speaking in the afternoon, St. Laurent drew a crowd of 200. To the shock of St. Laurent staffers, who {{remained}} for the Diefenbaker appearance, the PC leader drew an overflow crowd of over a thousand that evening, {{even though he was}} an hour late, with announcements made to the excited crowd that he was slowed by voters who wanted only to see him or <b>shake</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand.</b>|$|E
5|$|Historian Richard Rhodes {{said that}} in his opinion it was already a foregone {{conclusion}} that Oppenheimer would have his security clearance revoked by then AEC chairman Lewis Strauss, regardless of Teller's testimony. However, as Teller's testimony was the most damning, he was singled out and blamed for the hearing's ruling, losing friends due to it, such as Robert Christy, who refused to <b>shake</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> in one infamous incident. This was emblematic of his later treatment which resulted in his being forced {{into the role of}} an outcast of the physics community, thus leaving him little choice but to align himself with industrialists.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} the game, feeling insulted, Tregubov {{refused to}} <b>shake</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand.</b> Two days after the game, Tregubov and his team would {{complain}} to arbiters about his suspect strong play, and his frequent toilet breaks. On the second day, Bindrich had the black pieces against Sebastian Siebrecht and on move 10, he took a second toilet break. Siebrecht, having played such cheaters as Christoph Natsidis in the past, suspected that he was using an analysis program on his smartphone. On Bindrich's return an arbiter asked to search him and that he give over his smartphone, which under tournament rules, the refereee is allowed to do. Bindrich refused to hand it over, saying that there was private information on the phone, and he was forfeited the game.|$|E
5|$|On {{his trip}} to Israel in October 1985, Weizsäcker was greeted on arrival by his Israeli counterpart, President Chaim Herzog. The {{president}} was given a full honor-guard welcome at Ben-Gurion Airport; among Cabinet ministers who lined up to <b>shake</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> were right-wingers of the Herut party, the main faction of Foreign Minister Yitzhak Shamir's Likud party, who had previously refused to greet German leaders. Weizsäcker's visit was the first by a head of state, but not the first by a West German leader, as Chancellor Willy Brandt had {{paid a visit to}} Israel in June 1973. During a four-day state visit to the United Kingdom in July 1986, Weizsäcker addressed a joint session of the Houses of Parliament, the first German to be accorded that honor.|$|E
5|$|In WSC's debut {{season of}} 1977–78, Chappell hit the first Supertest century and {{finished}} fifth in overall averages. The prevalence of short-pitched fast bowling {{and a serious}} injury to Australian David Hookes led to the innovation of batting helmets; Chappell {{was one of the}} many batsmen to use one. Following their 1975–76 tour of Australia, the West Indies adopted a four-man fast bowling attack, while the World XI contained fast bowlers of the calibre of Imran Khan, Mike Procter, Garth Le Roux, Clive Rice and Sarfraz Nawaz. The constant diet of pace bowling undermined the confidence of some batsmen during WSC. Chappell's form fell away during the second season and he scored only 181 runs at 25.85 in four Supertests. During the last six days of the season, the WSC Australians lost the finals of both the limited-overs competition (to the West Indies XI) and the Supertest series (to the World XI), thus forfeiting the winner-takes-all prize money. After the latter match, Chappell vented his frustrations on World XI captain Tony Greig by refusing to <b>shake</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> and criticising Greig's inconsequential contribution to his team's victory. The final act of the competition was a series between the WSC Australians and the WSC West Indies played in the Caribbean in the spring of 1979. After the Australians suffered a heavy defeat in the first Supertest at Jamaica, Chappell rallied his team to draw the five match series one-all. His best effort were scores of 61 and 86 at Barbados.|$|E

25|$|Seel {{found himself}} {{repeatedly}} under {{attack in the}} 1980s and 1990s, even receiving death threats. After he appeared on French television, he was attacked and beaten by young men shouting homophobic epithets. Catherine Trautmann, then the Mayor of Strasbourg and later a Socialist Party culture minister, once refused to <b>shake</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> during a commemorative ceremony.|$|E
25|$|Later on, Martin Bormann {{interrupts}} {{a meeting}} between Hitler, Goebbels, and Walther Hewel to read a message from Luftwaffe chief Hermann Göring requesting permission to assume command and become head-of-state. Hitler responds by stripping Göring of his rank, ordering his arrest, and naming Robert Ritter von Greim as his replacement. Hitler then receives further upsetting news when Speer informs him that he has defied Hitler's scorched earth policy orders. Hitler does not punish Speer, {{but he does not}} <b>shake</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> as Speer leaves.|$|E
25|$|Implicit {{memory is}} the non-declarative, or unspoken, aspects of memory. Priming, motor memory and {{classical}} conditioning are all examples of implicit memory. An example of implicit memory's {{effect on our}} social interactions has been illustrated by the pin-in-hand phenomenon. This phenomenon was first observed by Claparède while dealing with an amnesiac patient. Normally, he would shake the patient's hand and introduce himself, as the patient thought it was their first time meeting. However, on one occasion he hid a pin and pricked the patient with it when she reached to <b>shake</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand.</b> Later, when he offered his hand, she drew away and refused to shake, {{in spite of the}} fact she could not explicitly recall the pinprick itself. The patient was unable to provide a reason for her hesitation.|$|E

25|$|One of Clay's clients was his father-in-law, Colonel Thomas Hart, {{an early}} settler of Kentucky and a {{prominent}} businessman. Hart {{proved to be}} an important business connection for Clay, as he helped Clay gain new clients and grow in professional stature. Clay's most notable client was Aaron Burr in 1806, after the US District Attorney Joseph Hamilton Daveiss indicted him for allegedly planning an expedition into Spanish Territory west of the Mississippi River. Clay and his law partner John Allen successfully defended Burr. Some years later Thomas Jefferson convinced Clay that Daveiss had been right in his charges. Clay was so upset that many years later, when he met Burr again, Clay refused to <b>shake</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand.</b> Clay's legal career would continue long after his election to Congress, and in the 1823 Supreme Court case, Green v. Biddle, Clay submitted the Supreme Court's first amicus curiae.|$|E
25|$|De Gaulle {{arrived at}} Bordeaux on 14 June, {{and was given}} a new mission to go to London to discuss the {{potential}} evacuation to North Africa. He had a brief meeting with Admiral Darlan about the potential role of the French Navy. That evening, by coincidence, he dined in the same restaurant as Pétain: {{he went over to}} <b>shake</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> in silence, the last time they ever met. Next morning no aircraft could be found so he had to drive to Brittany, where he visited his wife and daughters, and his aged mother (whom he never saw again, as she died in July), before taking a boat to Plymouth (he asked the skipper if {{he would be willing to}} carry on the war under British flag), where he arrived on 16 June. He ordered the boat Pasteur, with a cargo of munitions, to be diverted to a British port, which caused some members of the French Government to call for him to be put on trial.|$|E
500|$|Armand Vaillancourt {{flew from}} Quebec to California after the incident, {{and spoke in}} favor of Bono's actions at U2's Oakland {{performance}} several days later.

[...] The sculptor spray-painted a slogan of his own on the band's stage, [...] "Stop the Madness".|$|E

500|$|In December 2011, actor Christian Bale {{attempted}} to visit Chen {{along with a}} CNN crew, but was punched, shoved, and denied access by Chinese security guards. Bale later stated that he had wanted [...] "to meet the man, <b>shake</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> and say what an inspiration he is." [...] Video footage also showed Bale and the CNN crew having stones thrown at them, and being pursued in their minivan for more than 40 minutes.|$|E
500|$|Accompanied by {{his brother}} Peter, Hodgson {{walked out of the}} Royal Courts of Justice a free and {{innocent}} man after 27years of wrongful imprisonment. Hodgson's barrister at the 1982 trial, Robin Grey QC, was there to <b>shake</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> as he was released. Grey said: [...] "As a human being I feel glad that we no longer have capital punishment. As a defence barrister I didn't get him off, and I have bitter feelings of guilt about that." ...|$|E
500|$|McMahon made an {{appearance}} {{as a guest}} speaker at the WrestleMania XXVII Press Conference. Several months later, she appeared in a backstage segment at SummerSlam to wish CM Punk luck in his match. Upon offering to <b>shake</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand,</b> Punk declined and insulted her: [...] "I would, but... I know where that hand's been." [...] The following night on Raw, McMahon appeared backstage with CM Punk and threatened him: [...] "...in the end, people always get what they deserve." ...|$|E

500|$|Next, the {{resistance}} plans {{to kill the}} President of the Colonies, Gaius Baltar (James Callis), who is unwillingly collaborating with the Cylons. They learn he is to attend a graduation ceremony for the New Caprica Police, an unpopular masked police force {{set up by the}} Cylons to allow the humans to police the city and do the Cylons' bidding. Tucker [...] "Duck" [...] Clellan (Christian Tessier), who has access to the ceremony and whose wife had been killed by the Cylons, agrees to suicide bomb the ceremony. Towards the end of the episode it is revealed that Baltar's aide, Felix Gaeta (Alessandro Juliani) is the informant. He learns that Baltar will not be attending the ceremony, but cannot alert {{the resistance}} in time. Duck attends the ceremony, and when Number Three (Lucy Lawless) comes to <b>shake</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand,</b> Duck detonates the bomb, killing everybody in the room.|$|E
500|$|Reports of the {{assassination}} spread quickly; in his history of the times, Arthur Bryant records the crude delight with which the news was received by hungry workers who had received nothing but woe from Perceval's government. In his prison cell, Cobbett understood their feelings; the shooting had [...] "ridded them of one whom they looked upon as the leader among those whom they thought totally bent on the destruction of their liberties". The scenes outside the Palace of Westminster as [...] Bellingham was taken out for transfer to Newgate were consistent with this mood; Samuel Romilly, the law reformer and MP for Wareham, heard from the assembled crowd [...] "the most savage expressions of joy and exultation... accompanied with regret that others, and particularly the attorney general, had not shared the same fate". The throng surged around the hackney coach carrying Bellingham; many tried to <b>shake</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand,</b> others mounted the coach-box {{and had to be}} beaten off with whips. He was hustled back into the building, and kept there until the disorder had died down sufficiently for him to be moved, with a full military escort.|$|E
