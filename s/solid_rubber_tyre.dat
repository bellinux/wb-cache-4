40|$|This {{article was}} {{accepted}} for publication in the journal, Applied Acoustics [© Elsevier] and the definitive version is available from: www. elsevier. com/locate/apacoustThere are four main air-related noise generation mechanisms at the tyre/road interface, which were all categorised more than 20 years ago. The first one is the so-called ‘air pumping’ mechanism. Two other air-related phenomena that occur when there are air movements near the contact patch of the tyre are ‘air resonant radiation’ and ‘pipe resonances’ which appear at the footprint of the tyre. In addition to these, there is a forth effect, which is mentioned in the literature, that is occurring due to turbulence effects of the air surrounding the spinning tyre. There has been less focus on the air related mechanisms than on other types of tyre noise generation mechanisms. This paper attempts to add some detail to current understanding of the air-related noise generation at the tyre road interface and gives some further {{information on how to}} identify the differences due to these mechanisms. Specifically in the present paper, a <b>solid</b> <b>rubber</b> <b>tyre</b> running on a vehicle chassis dynamometer is used to study the first two mechanisms. This is done with emphasis on the time history of the recorded signal and not on the frequency spectrum, as is more commonly used. A comparison with existing theoretical models of these mechanisms reveals some of the strength and weaknesses of the current understanding of these phenomena...|$|E

50|$|The type 1525 Truck, first {{produced}} in 1917, featured a 4-cylinder 4,712 cc engine with a claimed maximum power output of 22 hp. The maximum speed was given as 30 km/h (19 mph). The front-mounted engine drove {{the rear wheels}} via a four-speed gear box and a rotating steel drive-shaft.

50|$|The {{most obvious}} {{difference}} {{is in the}} wheels. Traction engines were generally built with large fabricated spoked steel wheels with wide rims. Those intended for road use would have continuous <b>solid</b> <b>rubber</b> <b>tyres</b> bolted around the rims, to improve traction on tarmac. Engines intended for agricultural use would {{have a series of}} strakes bolted diagonally across the rims, like the tread on a modern pneumatic tractor tyre, and the wheels were typically wider to spread the load more evenly.|$|R

Thirty breakdown trucks remained on the road at all times with repair crews stationed besides them. Any disabled vehicle was immediately moved to the roadside so as not to interrupt the flow of traffic. Automobile repair shops in Bar-le-Duc and Troyes worked ceaselessly as did hydraulic presses that renewed the truck's <b>solid</b> <b>rubber</b> <b>tyres.</b>|$|R

50|$|Thomas Humber built {{himself a}} {{velocipede}} {{based on a}} picture in a letter about the Paris-developed machine that {{was published in the}} English Mechanic magazine in late 1868.

50|$|Dutton {{argued that}} a <b>rubber</b> <b>tyre</b> in contact with a hard road would be better at {{transferring}} tractive power than a steel wheel on steel rail. He claimed that the tractive effort to be obtained by using rubber-tyred driving wheels running on roads was 1330 lb per long ton of adhesive weight, compared to the 334 lb per long ton which could be obtained by using steel wheels running on rails. His proposed system would use railway trucks on rails, hauled by a rail-and-road-borne tractor which would be guided by a four-wheeled bogie on the rails, but with driving wheels fitted with <b>solid</b> <b>rubber</b> <b>tyres</b> which would run on well-prepared strips of road {{on each side of}} the rail track.|$|R
25|$|The {{characteristic}} {{features of}} these engines are very large rear driving wheels fitted with <b>solid</b> <b>rubber</b> <b>tyres,</b> three-speed gearing (most traction engine types {{have only two}} gears), rear suspension, and belly tanks to provide a greater range between the stops needed to replenish water. All these features are to improve the ride and performance of the engine, which were used for journeys of hundreds of miles. Most road locomotives are fitted with a winch drum on the back axle. This {{can be used by}} removing the driving pins from the rear wheels, allowing the drive train to power the winch drum instead of the wheels.|$|R
50|$|The Peerless lorry was a {{relatively}} slow and heavy vehicle but was reckoned to be tough, with <b>solid</b> <b>rubber</b> <b>tyres</b> and rear-wheel chain drive. The armour for the vehicle produced by the Austin company {{was based on an}} earlier design created for the Russian Army, which had been used in very limited numbers {{at the end of the}} war in France. The original Austin design, however, was shorter than the Peerless and the resulting combination was awkward and difficult to steer in confined spaces. In order to reduce the problem, a duplicate set of driving controls was installed at the rear of the vehicle.|$|R
