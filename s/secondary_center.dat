5|$|As Jerry {{entered the}} eastern Caribbean Sea early on October 8 after {{bypassing}} St. Vincent, its forward speed increased to 25 mph (40km/h), and reconnaissance aircraft observations indicated a broad circulation with several small rotations but an ill-defined low-level center. Later, satellite observations {{indicated that the}} storm was poorly organized, with an elongated cloud mass and displaced <b>secondary</b> <b>center</b> to the northwest. Moderate vertical wind shear from the northwest developed, disrupting Jerry's upper-level outflow. Jerry continued to deteriorate, and later on October 8, aircraft data indicated the system had weakened into a broad {{area of low pressure}} with scattered squalls mainly to the east of the remnant center. Jerry then dissipated shortly afterward approximately 230miles south of Puerto Rico, with the remnants moving westward.|$|E

40|$|The {{study of}} <b>secondary</b> <b>centers</b> {{is crucial to}} {{understanding}} how a state functions as they are important points of interaction between state authorities and ordinary households. In this dissertation I focus {{on the nature of}} political organization of lower-level centers of the Early Classic Period (A. D. 200 – 500) in the Mixteca Alta, Oaxaca, Mexico. ^ A previous comparative analysis of architectural arrangements at <b>secondary</b> <b>centers</b> between the Valley of Oaxaca and the Mixteca Alta indicated that single plaza groups were the major form of public architecture. I interpreted these enclosed plaza groups as the residences of elite governing households suggesting dominance of <b>secondary</b> <b>centers</b> by single households in the Mixteca Alta. Conversely, in the Valley of Oaxaca <b>secondary</b> <b>centers</b> show a pattern of multiple enclosed plaza groups, indicating that multiple households shared administrative functions. The main question I ask are Mixteca Alta centers, characterized by a single plaza pattern, imply less political centralization or a broader span of control at the secondary level? or alternatively, do these single plaza groups suggest that the state vested power in single households? ^ To answer these questions, I focused my research on four <b>secondary</b> <b>centers</b> of the Mixteca Alta. Using intensive site survey and systematic random collection as my main methods of data recovery, I collected artifacts over whole site areas in relation to public buildings. By comparing the distribution of various artifact categories within the site limits, including costly goods, in relation to zones of the site containing public architecture, I evaluated the degree of political centralization. Although the results varied from site to site, the overall conclusions are that political actors did not entirely control material or symbolic resources to negotiate their status. These centers appear to have been only moderately stratified. This implies a form of systemic power, perhaps a bureaucratic system, in which individual power holders were not required to engage in status negotiation. ...|$|R

25|$|Wyoming Area <b>Secondary</b> <b>Center</b> {{offers a}} dual {{enrollment}} program. This state-funded program permits {{high school students}} to take courses, at local higher education institutions, to earn college credits. Students remain enrolled at their high school. The courses count towards high school graduation requirements and towards earning a college degree. Students can enroll at Kings College and Wilkes University. All students in their junior or senior year who rank in the top ten percent of the class are eligible as are other students who have a teacher recommendation. The students continue to have full access to activities at their high school. The college credits are offered at a deeply discounted rate. The state offers a small grant to assist students in costs for tuition, fees and books. Under the Pennsylvania Transfer and Articulation Agreement, many Pennsylvania colleges and universities accept these credits for students who transfer to their institutions. The Pennsylvania College Credit Transfer System reported in 2009, that students saved nearly $35.4 million by having their transferred credits count towards a degree under the new system. For the 2009-10 funding year, the school district received a state grant of 4,737 for its dual enrollment program.|$|E
500|$|Early on September2, the {{depression}} acquired gale-force winds {{and became the}} fourth tropical storm of the 2014season; accordingly, it was assigned the name Dolly at this time. A tight pressure gradient between Dolly and a ridge over the Gulf of Mexico created a large area of tropical storm winds along {{the east side of}} the cyclone. Data Hurricane Hunters investigating the system indicate that Dolly achieved its peak winds of 50mph (85km/h) around 12:00UTC. Winds up to 70mph (110km/h) were found within the deep convection to the storm's east but considered to be inflated by heavy rains and thus not representative of [...] its actual strength. Slight weakening took place shortly thereafter as the center relocated to the south. During this relocation, multiple circulations were observed rotating around a mean position with yet another vortex located well to the southeast. Around 01:00UTC on September3, Dolly's pressure fell to 1000mbar (hPa; 29.53inHg) marking the storm's peak intensity. Maintaining a due west course, Dolly made landfall just south of Tampico at 04:00UTC with winds of 45mph (75km/h). Radar observations depicted a <b>secondary</b> <b>center</b> to the north that moved ashore near Altamira an hour later. Once onshore, Dolly's circulation separated from all remaining convection and the storm degenerated into a remnant low later that day. The system subsequently dissipated early on September4.|$|E

40|$|Eggplant (Solanum melongena L.) was domesticated in the Indo-Birmanian region, {{which is}} also the primary center of {{diversity}} for this crop. From there eggplant spread to other regions, and diversity accumulated in several <b>secondary</b> <b>centers</b> of diversity. We have assessed the diversity and relationships of 52 accessions of eggplant from three geographically distant <b>secondary</b> <b>centers</b> of diversity (China, Spain, and Sri Lanka) using 28 morphological descriptors and 12 highly polymorphic genomic SSRs. A wide variation was found for most morphological traits, and significant differences among the three centers of diversity were detected for 22 of these traits. The PCA analysis showed that eggplants from the three origins were morphologically differentiated, and accessions from each of the three <b>secondary</b> <b>centers</b> of diversity presented a typical combination of morphological characteristics. In this respect, discriminant analysis showed that accessions could be correctly classified to their origin using only six traits. The SSR characterization identified 110 alleles and allowed obtaining a unique genetic fingerprint for each accession. Many alleles were found to be private to each origin, but no universal alleles were found for any of the origins. The PCA analysis showed that the genetic differentiation among origins was less clear than for morphological traits, although the analysis of the population structure shows that accessions mostly group according to the origin, but also provides evidence of migration among the three <b>secondary</b> <b>centers</b> of diversity. The genetic diversity (H(T)) within each origin was high, ranging between H(T)  =  0. 5400 (Sri Lanka) and H(T)  =  0. 4943 (China), while the standardized genetic differentiation (G'(ST)) among origins was moderate (G'(ST)  =  0. 2657). The correlation between morphological and SSR distances was non-significant (r =  0. 044), indicating that both data are complementary for the conservation of germplasm and breeding of eggplant. These results are relevant for the management of genetic resources, breeding programmes, and evolutionary studies of eggplant...|$|R

40|$|Background: Many {{radiographic}} indices {{that are}} used to assess adolescents for femoroacetabular impingement rely on an ossified posterior acetabular wall. A recent study identified a <b>secondary</b> ossification <b>center</b> in the posterior rim of the acetabulum, the ossification of which may affect perceived acetabular coverage. The {{purpose of this study was}} to characterize ossification of the posterior rim of the acetabulum with use of a longitudinal radiographic study and quantify its impact on the radiographic assessment of femoroacetabular impingement. Methods: In this study, we utilized a historical collection of annual radiographs made in a population of healthy ado-lescents. Six hundred and twelve anteroposterior radiographs of the left hip of ninety-eight patients were reviewed to identify the appearance, duration, and fusion of the <b>secondary</b> ossification <b>center</b> in the posterior rim of the acetabulum.
