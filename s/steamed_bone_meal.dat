The experimental design was a 9 x 5 x 3 factorial, with five rates (0, 50, 100, 150, 200 mg P kg 1 soil) of nine P sources, including monobasic calcium phosphate. All macro- and micronutrients were added in sufficient amount, with P as a variable. After 40 days, corn top was harvested, whereas ryegrass was harvested every 30 days for a total of five cuttings.

There were six pens of barrows and seven pens of gilts per treatment. Pigs were blocked by initial weight and sex, and then allotted to one of six dietary treatments. The dietary treatments were based on corn-soybean meal, were formulated on a true-ileal-digestible (TID) lysine basis, and were fed in three phases.

Expenditures for operating costs during the year were 180. 00 for office space and 1671. 29 for carrying on the program. Mr. Jake Stasch of Nenzel, Mr. A. J. Galloway of Kilgore, and Mr. O. J. Dau of Cody were appointed members of the finance committee. They directed the canvass for subscriptions {{with the help of the}} precinct solicitors. The program of work directed special emphasis to the Nebraska Pasture-Forage-Livestock program, to pasture improvement, to herdquality improvement and to livestock marketing. The 4 -H agricultural clubs specialized in herd quality. The home economics program for both 4 -H clubs and adult women gave attention to foods, clothing and home management. Demonstrational variety and type plats of wheat, oats and sorghums were planted in the county. Komar wheat yielded 17. 5 bushels per acre as compared to 16. 3 bushels of Ceres, and 14. 3 bushels of Reward. Dry weather, grasshoppers and wind destroyed the oats tests. Most of the sorghum plats were destroyed by hail and heavy rain in June. Leoti Red sorgo produced two and three-fourths ton of cured fodder per acre compared to 2. 4 tons of atlas, 2 tons of Cheyenne, and an estimated 3 / 4 ton of corn fodder. The acreage of grain sorghums was more than doubled this year and totaled 4, 274 acres. The forage sorghums increased from 11, 960 acres in 1938 to 13, 625 acres in 1939. In the early 19302 ̆ 7 s, the sandhills were carrying maximum numbers of livestock. The drouth has accumulated since 1930 to a total deficiency of 38 inches of rainfall. Cattlemen here had to cut down their herds and get more range in their ranching units. The range program, pasture improvement program of the county extension service and the pasture-forage-livestock program have made the ranchers conscious of the need for conserving grasslands. 429, 948 acres of Cherry County pastures were rested in 1939 in addition to those regularly left tor winter pasture. 195 additional wells were installed in 1938 and 242 more during 1939. The average acreage served by one well has been reduced from 1111 acres to 1028. Landscaping, yard beautification and garden information was given at the time of farm and home visits, by office interviews, by news items, and by a beautiful flower and vegetable exhibit at the county fair. 41 ranchers and farmers planted 19, 700 Clarke-McNary seedlings. Blueprints and bills of material service was given for the construction of a horse barn, a 2 -car garage, a grain elevator, 2 livestock feeders and a sale barn. Turkey growers were given monthly service bulletins. Feeding, management, and breed improvement information was extended to all growers whose name was available. Turkey production in the county was greatly increased. Quality improvement program for beef cattle was conducted by means of 4 -H clubs, cooperation with the breeders association and calf shows held in connection with association sales, at a special event in Mullen and at the county fair. Protein supplements and mineral supplements as a balance to the needs of range cattlemen was discussed at two series of community meetings and as a port of the pasture-forage-livestock program. Cottonseed cake and soybean cake have been proved to be more economical than other sources of proteins. <b>Steamed</b> <b>bone</b> <b>meal,</b> by furnishing a good source of phosphorus is an important mineral source. Control of calf scours, calf diphtheria, and the latest information concerning Bang 2 ̆ 7 s disease were the subjects of discussion at community meetings and during the progress of pasture-forage-livestock visits. Bot control and sleeping sickness control in horses was continued. The latter malady has been almost entirely eradicated during the 1939 year. With an A. C. P. depleting goal of 102, 976 acres for the county the summary of performance showed that 73, 464 acres were planted to depleting crops. 3, 096 acres of wheat were planted as compared to a wheat allotment of 3, 565. 429, 948 acres of range were deferred or rested between May 15 and October 1. 242 wells were installed. 76 ranchers and farmers cooperated with the Nebraska Pasture-Forage-Livestock program. 98 visits were made to 61 different ranches and farms. District finish-up clinics and recognition meetings were conducted at Valentine and at Mullen. 8 Cherry County ranchers were awarded recognition by the sponsoring business firm organizations at these district meetings. Two were awarded honorable mention at the Omaha state meet. The Land-Use committee assisted to coordinate the credit facilities of FSA, FCA, and the land bank. Thelr policies were outlined and discussed with representatives of the production credit association and the local banking agencies. Collections are reported much greater than new amounts loaned for the current year. FCA reports collection of total amount on their books tor the county as being more than 60 percent. A livestock brand directory With 1800 brands of herds maintained in the county was published as a 6 -page supplement to the 1938 Cherry County atlas. Cooperated with and assisted the various livestock agencies with promotion of livestock sales services. Sales from Cherry County members of the new feeder cattle association are estimated to exceed 39, 000 head. Added to the purebred sales, the valuation of livestock sold by members at organizations assisted is estimated to exceed 2, 000, 000. 00. 28 clubs enrolled 405 ladies tor the home demonstration program.

Three different sorts of <b>bone</b> <b>meal</b> were examined; they were calcium phosphate (CAP <b>meal),</b> meat and <b>bone</b> <b>meal</b> (MBM) and decanter cake (DC). All the meal-types had in common that they reduce heavy metals very well. Generally cadmium and lead are reduced better at around 99 percent, while the reduction for mercury and chromium is somewhat lower, between 90 and 99 percent. The reduction is of course dependent on how the test is carried out and which <b>bone</b> <b>meal</b> is used. The binding is best explained by three mechanisms depending on which metal that is bound. The binding can occur though an ion-exchange mechanism, an adsorption mechanism or through binding to the proteins in the <b>bone</b> <b>meal.</b> Most likely the binding of the different metals occurs through a combination of all these mechanisms. All the types of <b>bone</b> <b>meal</b> that were examined would work perfectly as a product for purifying for example sewage water.

40|$|Phosphate {{fertilizer}} {{has been}} recognized as the most limiting element in agriculture production. Its natural resource, unfortunately, is also limited. The recycle of animal <b>bone</b> <b>meal</b> will be increased its importance for most country prohibiting it used as animal feed. The aim of this thesis was to screen microorganisms which can directly dissolve phosphate from the raw <b>bone</b> <b>meal</b> with no fat removal. The fat contained in raw <b>bone</b> <b>meal</b> {{is assumed to be}} the carbon source for the phosphate solubilizing microorganism. Aspergillus niger is evaluated as the only microorganism which meets the requiring that the microorganism can directly release the phosphorus from the raw <b>bone</b> <b>meal</b> of pig and goat, after screened 62 calcium phosphate solubilizing microorganisms from different resources. The main mechanism of A. niger dissolves the raw <b>bone</b> <b>meal</b> is the release of oxalic acid. In liquid media, A. niger dissolved more phosphate from the goat bone than from pig bone. The addition of extra nitrogen to lower the C/N ratio can improve the release of phosphate from goat bone, but no significant increase from pig bone. In pot experiment, although, the inoculation of A. niger increased soil available phosphate concentration of addition of all <b>bone</b> <b>meal</b> treatments, no positive effect of maize dry weight and phosphate uptake in maize shoot. These results are due to the high C/N ratio of both raw <b>bone</b> <b>meals</b> and there was no fertilizers applied except the addition of <b>bone</b> <b>meals.</b> The lower ammonium and nitrate concentrations of the <b>bone</b> <b>meal</b> addition treatments evidenced the assumption. 隨著農業的發展，肥料的用量也逐年提升。尤其是磷肥，不像氮肥能夠從大氣中直接獲得，只能靠磷礦石的開採提煉而得。但是世界上的磷礦石存量大約只夠我們再使用 90 年，故尋求可用的替代品以讓農業能夠永續經營是當務之急。骨頭為常見的農業及食品加工業廢棄物，其成分主要為磷酸三鈣Ca 3 (PO 4) 2 與氫氧基磷灰石Ca 10 (PO 4) 6 (OH) 2 ，具有與過磷酸鈣Ca(H 2 PO 4) 含量相當的磷，但骨頭於自然環境中的溶解度極低，因此不易當作肥料使用。因此若能找出將骨頭中所含的磷利用於農業生產上的方法，將能夠為農業省下可觀的成本，也使農業能夠永續發展。本研究乃利用骨粉作為養分來源以培養出能夠利用並溶解骨粉的微生物，並從中篩選出可能能夠溶出骨粉磷的菌株共 62 株。經過骨粉孵育及溶骨粉磷能力測定後得到菌株Aspergillus niger為環境中最常見之黑麴菌，常被用來進行工業發酵以取得檸檬酸，對於人體與植物的致病力皆不強，其對於磷的溶出有很強的能力，在純化環境中A. niger對於骨粉磷比起其他篩選所得到菌株也有最強的溶出能力。而在液體培養基環境中能看出A. niger對羊骨粉與豬骨粉之溶磷情形不同，羊骨粉由於具有較高的碳氮比，使得磷的溶出量在初期較快速，但隨著孵育時間變長卻有減慢的情形；而豬骨粉碳氮比較低，磷溶出量緩慢上升，但經過C/N的調整試驗後發現羊骨粉磷的溶出速度在較低碳氮比時會有較大的溶出量，但豬骨則幾乎不受影響。最後將A. niger與骨粉同時或孵育後施用於盆栽中，發現無論是何種處理對於盆栽植體的磷含量影響皆不大，但會稍微提高土壤的有效性磷含量，添加羊骨粉的處理則會造成土壤裡的氮含量下降。 A. niger在土壤中雖然能夠將骨粉裡的磷溶出，但也會與植物競爭土壤裡的養分(如氮肌餓) ，造成植物對於土壤養分吸收上的阻礙。目錄 摘要	I 英文摘要	III 目錄	V 表次	VIII 圖次	IX 附錄	XII 壹、前言	 1 貳、前人研究	 3 一、磷肥	 3 二、磷礦石的存量	 4 三、動物骨粉	 4 四、土壤微生物	 5 五、土壤真菌	 7 六、Aspergillus niger	 8 七、微生物的生物代謝作用	 9 參、材料與方法	 12 一、骨粉製備	 12 二、骨粉與標準磷化合物構造鑑別	 12 三、骨粉化學成分測定	 12 四、溶骨磷菌之分離	 13 (一) 	豬油分解菌的馴養	 13 (二) 豬油分解菌的加強培養 (enrichment) 	 13 (三) 骨粉分解菌之馴養及加強培養 (enrichment) 	 14 (四) 骨粉分解菌之篩選	 14 (五) 溶磷菌之篩選	 14 五、溶骨磷菌溶磷能力之篩選	 15 (一) 分離菌株對於骨粉磷的溶出試驗	 15 (二) 篩選所得菌株	 16 六、骨粉溶磷菌之能力測定	 19 (一) 菌株於液態環境下對骨粉磷的溶出能力	 19 (二) 菌株於固態環境下對骨磷的溶出能力	 19 (三) 菌株於代謝時有機酸產出情形	 20 七、骨粉溶磷菌的盆栽試驗	 20 八、盆栽植體性質分析項目及方法	 21 九、盆栽土壤性質分析項目及方法	 22 肆、結果與討論	 26 一、	骨粉基本性質	 26 二、	菌株篩選試驗	 32 (一) 	菌株篩選	 32 (二) 	分離菌株在液體環境中對骨粉的溶解情形	 38 (三) 	孵育過程中有機酸的產出	 45 (四) 	分離菌株在固體環境中對骨粉的溶解	 54 三、	菌株之實際盆栽試驗	 59 四、	添加氮源對菌株溶磷能力的影響	 70 伍、結論	 73 陸、參考文獻	 74 柒、附錄	 8...|$|R
