At his death, he owned 12 starostwo districts, with over 300 settlements, including dozens of towns, giving him yearly revenues of over 500,000 złoty. His holdings of land and serfs in western Ukraine were considerable; he owned 18,548 households in Bratslav. Koniecpolski invested much of his wealth in developing his Ukrainian estates, and supported settlement of underpopulated regions. He founded and sponsored the development of many towns and cities, including the town of Brody, which flourished with his investments, and became an important local commercial center. Koniecpolski fortified the town with a citadel and bastions in 1633 and set up workshops for producing Persian-type <b>samite</b> fabrics, carpets and rugs. He also constructed a fortified palace in Pidhirtsi (Podhorce) with beautiful Italian gardens. Like most magnates, Koniecpolski was a patron of the arts, sponsoring painters, sculptors, writers. He also founded many churches and sought to upgrade Brody's school to an academy. He sponsored {{the construction of the}} Koniecpolski Palace (now the Presidential Palace) in Warsaw, and military fortifications in Bar and Kudak.|$|E

25|$|During the 13th century, gloves {{began to}} be worn by ladies as a fashion ornament. They were made of linen and silk, and {{sometimes}} reached to the elbow. Such worldly accoutrements were not for holy women, according to the early 13thcentury Ancrene Wisse, written for their guidance. Sumptuary laws were promulgated to restrain this vanity: against <b>samite</b> gloves in Bologna, 1294, against perfumed gloves in Rome, 1560.|$|E

2500|$|Of {{the five}} basic weaves used in Byzantium and the Islamic weaving {{centers of the}} Mediterranean – tabby, twill, damask, lampas and {{tapestry}} – the most important product was the weft-faced compound twill called <b>samite.</b> The word is derived from Old French samit, from medieval Latin samitum, examitum deriving from the Byzantine Greek [...] ἑξάμιτον hexamiton [...] "six threads", usually interpreted as indicating the use of six yarns in the warp. In <b>samite,</b> the main warp threads are hidden {{on both sides of}} the fabric by the ground and patterning wefts, with only the binding warps that hold the wefts in place visible.|$|E

2500|$|The American actor William Marshall {{performed}} {{the title role}} in at least six productions. His Othello was called by Harold Hobson of the London Sunday Times [...] "the best Othello of our time," [...] continuing: [...] "nobler than Tearle, more martial than Gielgud, more poetic than Valk. From his first entry, slender and magnificently tall, framed in a high Byzantine arch, clad in white <b>samite,</b> mystic, wonderful, a figure of Arabian romance and grace, to his last plunging oif the knife into his stomach, Mr Marshall rode without faltering the play's enormous rhetoric, {{and at the end}} the house rose to him." [...] Marshall also played Othello in a jazz musical version, Catch My Soul, with Jerry Lee Lewis as Iago, in Los Angeles in 1968. His Othello was captured on record in 1964 with Jay Robinson as Iago and on video in 1981 with Ron Moody as Iago. The 1982 Broadway staging starred James Earl Jones as Othello and Christopher Plummer as Iago.|$|E
60|$|After that Sir Lavaine gave {{command that}} the barge should be hung and draped all with white <b>samite</b> {{embroidered}} with silver {{and he gave}} command that a couch of white <b>samite</b> should be established upon the barge, and the covering of the couch was also embroidered with silver. So when all was in readiness there came forth a procession from the chapel, bearing that still and silent figure, and they {{brought it to the}} barge and laid it upon the couch of white <b>samite</b> that had been prepared for it. Thereafter Sir Lavaine entered the barge and took his station in the bow of the boat and the deaf and dumb man took his station in the stern thereof.|$|E

6000|$|Then the Lady Layonnesse said, [...] "Sir Knight, I take thee for my champion."

60|$|So the damsel and {{the dwarf}} {{led the way}} for {{somewhat}} of a distance, though not for so very far, until they came of a sudden to where was an open meadow in the forest, hedged all around with the trees of the woodland. And here the King and his knights were aware of a great bustle of many people, some working very busily in setting up several pavilions of white <b>samite,</b> and others preparing a table as for a feast, and others upon this business and others upon that; and there were various sumpter-mules and pack-horses and palfreys all about, as though belonging to a party of considerable estate.|$|E

"Well, I'll be Elaine," [...] said Anne, {{yielding}} reluctantly, for, {{although she}} would have been delighted to play the principal character, yet her artistic sense demanded fitness for it and this, she felt, her limitations made impossible.

60|$|The rococo margraves and margravines used {{of course}} to worship in St. Johannis Church.

6000|$|... [Sidenote: King Arthur and {{his companions}} find a strange damsel and a dwarf] Now this time, being the Eve of Saint John, fairies and those folk who are fay come forth, as is very well known, into the world from which they dwell apart at other times. So when King Arthur and those two knights and their several foresters and huntsmen came to a certain {{outlying}} part of the forest, they were suddenly aware of a damsel and a dwarf waiting where the road upon which they were travelling crossed another road, and they perceived, from her very remarkable appearance, that the damsel was very likely Fay. For both she and her dwarf sat each upon a milk-white horse, very strangely still, close to where was a shrine by a hedge of hawthorne; and the damsel was so wonderfully fair of face {{that it was a}} marvel to behold her. Moreover, she was clad all in white <b>samite</b> from top to toe and her garments were embroidered with silver; and the trappings and garniture of her horse were of white <b>samite</b> studded with bright silver bosses, wherefore, because of this silver, she glistered with a sudden lustre whensoever she moved a little. When King Arthur and the two knights who were with him drew nigh this damsel, much marvelling at her appearance, she hailed him in a voice that was both high and clear, crying: [...] "Welcome, King Arthur! Welcome, King Arthur! Welcome, King Arthur!" [...] saying three words three times; and [...] "Welcome, Sir Ewain!" [...] "Welcome, Sir Ector de Maris!" [...] addressing each of those lords by his name.|$|E
6000|$|... "There lay she all her {{length and}} kiss'd his feet, As if in deepest reverence and in love. A twist of gold was round her hair; a robe Of <b>samite</b> without price, that more exprest Than hid her, clung about her lissome limbs, In colour like the satin-shining palm On sallows in the windy gleams of March: And while she kiss'd them, crying, 'Trample me, Dear feet, that I have follow'd thro' the world, And I will pay you worship; tread me down And I will kiss you for it'; he was mute: So dark a forethought roll'd about his brain, As on a dull day in an Ocean cave The blind wave feeling round his long sea-hall In silence." ...|$|E
60|$|Then {{after seven}} days of this rejoicing, Sir Ewaine was wedded with great pomp of {{circumstance}} to the Lady of the Fountain. And of that wedding {{it is to be}} recorded in the history of these things that Sir Ewaine and the Lady Lesolie rode to the minster upon milk-white horses, and that they were all clad in white <b>samite</b> embroidered with silver and inset with so many precious stones of all sorts and kinds that they glistened in the sunlight as though they were two figures of living fire. And it is recorded that tenscore damsels of wonderful beauty, clad all in white, preceded them upon the way, and spread the way with flowers, chaunting the while in voices of great rejoicing.|$|E
6000|$|Then quickly rose Sir Bedivere, and ran, [...] And, leaping {{down the}} ridges lightly, plunged [...] Among the bulrush beds, and {{clutched}} the sword, [...] And strongly wheeled and threw it. The great brand [...] Made lightnings in the splendour of the moon, [...] And flashing round and round, and whirled in an arch, [...] Shot like a streamer {{of the northern}} morn, [...] Seen where the moving isles of winter shock [...] By night, with noises of the Northern Sea. [...] So flashed and fell the brand Excalibur: [...] But ere he dipt the surface, rose an arm [...] Clothed in white <b>samite,</b> mystic, wonderful, [...] And caught him by the hilt, and brandished him [...] Three times, and drew him under in the mere. [...] And lightly went {{the other to the}} King.|$|E
6000|$|For a {{few minutes}} Anne, {{drifting}} slowly down, enjoyed the romance of her situation to the full. Then something happened not at all romantic. The flat began to leak. In a very few moments {{it was necessary for}} Elaine to scramble to her feet, pick up her cloth of gold coverlet and pall of blackest <b>samite</b> and gaze blankly at a big crack in the bottom of her barge through which the water was literally pouring. That sharp stake at the landing had torn off the strip of batting nailed on the flat. Anne did not know this, but it did not take her long to realize that she was in a dangerous plight. At this rate the flat would fill and sink long before it could drift to the lower headland. Where were the oars? Left behind at the landing! ...|$|E
6000|$|So spake Lavaine, {{and when}} they reached the lists [...] By Camelot in the meadow, let his eyes [...] Run through the peopled gallery which half round [...] Lay like a rainbow fallen upon the grass, [...] Until they found the clear-faced King, who sat [...] Robed in red <b>samite,</b> easily to be known, [...] Since to his crown the golden dragon clung, [...] And down his robe the dragon writhed in gold, [...] And from the carven-work behind him crept [...] Two dragons gilded, sloping down to make [...] Arms for his chair, while all the rest of them [...] Through knots and loops and folds innumerable [...] Fled ever through the woodwork, till they found [...] The new design wherein they lost themselves, [...] Yet with all ease, so tender was the work: [...] And, in the costly canopy o'er him set, [...] Blazed the last diamond of the nameless king.|$|E
