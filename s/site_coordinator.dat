40|$|Leadership Policy and Organizations Department {{capstone}} projectThis report {{examines the}} role of GEAR UP <b>site</b> <b>coordinators</b> and school counselors {{in the development and}} implementation of GEAR UP Tennessee. The GEAR UP Tennessee program is an ambitious effort that offers a myriad of interventions to support academic preparation and college access in rural communities across the state. Though supported by a network of local and state partners, the program gives the nine participating districts discretion in the design and implementation of initiatives at the local level. <b>Site</b> <b>coordinators</b> are the primary agents charged with the responsibility of district-level implementation. Within the school context, school counselors are the individuals with the organizational proximity necessary for meaningful interactions with students concerning educational advancement. While GEAR UP Tennessee has collected data relative to the program's effects on schools, teachers, and parents, the work of <b>site</b> <b>coordinators</b> and school counselors has been largely overlooked. Therefore, in response to a request for assistance from the Tennessee Higher Education Commission (THEC), we developed the following research questions: How does the program structure and district context shape site 1) coordinators' implementation of GEAR UP? 2) What factors affect school counselors' implementation of GEAR UP initiatives? We conducted 63 semi-structured interviews with GEAR UP <b>site</b> <b>coordinators,</b> district leaders, school principals, school counselors and THEC officials. Interviews were designed to gather information on the district's performance in preparing students for post-secondary education; the respondent's knowledge of and role within GEAR UP; district and school supports and barriers affecting implementation, which include issues around individual and institutional capacity and will; the coherence of program messages and the sense-making in which respondents engaged to make decisions about their participation in the program and its implementation; and respondents' perceptions of program effects. Our data reveal that: Participating school districts were pressured by, and as a result largely focused on, No Child Left Behind (NCLB) compliance. The presence of NCLB largely detracted from the district's ability to fully embrace GEAR UP and integrate it into their district improvement plan. District and school leaders possessed little knowledge about GEAR UP, its intended implementation, and the appropriate role structure of <b>site</b> <b>coordinators,</b> district personnel, and school personnel. Most <b>site</b> <b>coordinators</b> did not perceive GEAR UP as a potential lever for systemic change. <b>Site</b> <b>coordinators</b> and school counselors received little substantive support from state and local leadership relative to implementation of GEAR UP college access interventions. The content of site coordinators' work focused predominantly on activity planning, resource distribution, and grant compliance. The community culture, specifically the "welfare state of mind," was perceived by all respondents as a barrier to advancing students' educational attainment. Training and professional development activities have been provided for <b>site</b> <b>coordinators</b> with a primary focus on grant compliance and reporting mechanisms. <b>Site</b> <b>coordinators</b> reported few opportunities to deepen their knowledge of how to increase students' academic preparation and college access, which has significant effects on implementation outcomes, program sustainability, and systemic change. Training for district and school personnel has been lacking and, in many cases, nonexistent. The work of school counselors is influenced by the lack of a coherent counseling curriculum, time constraints, and role ambiguity. Consequently, counselors provide sporadic support and leadership in GEAR UP implementation. As a result of these findings, we offer the following recommendations to ensure full program implementation and the attainment of program goals: 1) Improve the visibility and effectiveness of <b>site</b> <b>coordinators</b> by developing communication networks among coordinators and school and district personnel; creating comprehensive training manuals for coordinators; and implementing a series of trainings which address the factors influencing students' academic preparation and college access, as well as program implementation strategies supportive of GEAR UP goals. 2) Educate and involve district and school leadership by developing a GEAR UP TN Leaders Guide in tandem with GEAR UP TN leadership trainings. Trainings will create the forum to collaboratively plan with <b>site</b> <b>coordinators</b> in order to align GEAR UP TN interventions to both the district and school improvement plans. 3) Educate and involve the school counselor by developing a GEAR UP TN School Counselors Guide in tandem with GEAR UP TN counseling trainings. Trainings will help counselors implement college preparation curricula, improve collaborative planning with <b>site</b> <b>coordinators,</b> and develop communication networks among counselors. 4) Collectively develop a comprehensive sustainability plan which determines how to effectively disseminate data; galvanize support of the school counselor as well as district and school leadership within GEAR UP TN; and effect state-level policy change to enhance the core goals of GEAR UP TN.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to determine: (a) {{the nature and extent of}} programmatic changes that occurred in the nine Indiana "High Schools That Work" pilot sites, (b) how the implementation of these changes has impacted administrative roles and responsibilities, and (c) whether the principal's role is different in program implementation when another educator is directly responsible for a specific school-improvement initiative. Questionnaires were mailed to principals and site coordinators at each pilot site, and personal interviews were subsequently conducted with each of them. Findings and conclusions were: 1. All pilot sites used some form of integrated, non-linear planning. Integrated, non-linear planning helped pilot-site principals and site coordinators gain support for their programs and implement a greater number of changes than the researcher expected to find. 2. Communication and finding time to plan were the two most significant planning problems. When there was a breakdown in communication among constituent groups, the level of support for various initiatives diminished. Releasing teachers from classroom activities to plan this initiative provided help in the planning process. 3. Administrators at each school incorporated programmatic changes to reflect changes in philosophy, curriculum, and instruction. These changes included: (a) raising academic expectations, (b) eliminating the general track, (c) revising curriculum and instructional techniques, (d) integrating subject areas across academic disciplines and between academic and vocational subjects, (e) restructuring guidance programs, (f) collaborating with business communities, (g) modifying student assessment methods, and (h) changing the structure of the school day. Changes made through the "High Schools That Work" initiative have impacted all constituent groups affiliated with the pilot-site schools. 4. Educators in dual roles of principal and <b>site</b> <b>coordinator</b> maintained direct control of their projects, and their time commitments were significantly greater than those of principals at schools with separate site coordinators. In situations where a <b>site</b> <b>coordinator</b> was present, the principal primarily assumed the role of supporter.

40|$|In {{distributed}} {{data base}} systems (DDBSs), a transaction blocks during two-phase commit (2 PC) processing if the <b>coordinator</b> <b>site</b> fails {{and at the}} same time some participant site has declared itself ready to commit the transaction. The blocking phenomena reduces availability of the system since the blocked transactions keep all the resources until they receive the final command from the coordinator after its recovery. To remove the blocking problem in 2 PC protocol, three phase commit (3 PC) protocol was proposed. Although 3 PC protocol eliminates the blocking problem, it involves an extra round of message transmission, which further degrades the performance of DDBSs. In this paper, we propose a backup commit (BC) protocol by including backup phase to 2 PC protocol. In this, one backup site is attached to each <b>coordinator</b> <b>site.</b> After receiving responses from all participants in the first phase, the coordinator communicates its decision only to its backup site in the backup phase. Afterwards, it sends final decision to participants. When blocking occurs due to the failure of the <b>coordinator</b> <b>site,</b> the participant <b>sites</b> consult <b>coordinator's</b> backup <b>site</b> and follow termination protocols. In this way, BC protocol achieves non-blocking property in most of the <b>coordinator</b> <b>site</b> failures. However, in the worst case, the blocking can occur in BC protocol when both the coordinator and its backup site fail simultaneously. If such a rare case occurs, the participants wait until the recovery of either the <b>coordinator</b> <b>site</b> or the backup site. BC protocol suits best for DDBS environments in which sites fail frequently and messages take longer delivery time.
