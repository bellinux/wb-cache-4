She was going to approach Noël Coward next, but happened to meet Dorothy Hammerstein (Oscar's wife) in Manhattan. Holtzmann told Dorothy Hammerstein that she wanted Rodgers and Hammerstein to create a show for Lawrence, {{and asked her to}} <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> husband read a book that Holtzmann would send over. In fact, both Dorothy Rodgers and Dorothy Hammerstein had read the novel in 1944 and had urged their husbands to consider it as a possible subject for a musical. Dorothy Hammerstein had known Gertrude Lawrence since 1925, when they had both appeared in André Charlot's London Revue of 1924 on Broadway and on tour in North America.|$|E

500|$|In 1827, the Duke of York died, {{making the}} Duke of Clarence heir apparent, and Victoria the heir {{presumptive}} second-in-line to the throne. Conroy {{complained that the}} princess should not be surrounded with commoners, leading George IV to award them both titles; Lehzen became a baroness of the Kingdom of Hanover. George IV himself died in 1830, and was duly succeeded by his brother the Duke of Clarence, who became King William IV. William formally recognised Victoria as his heir presumptive. According to Lehzen, around this time the famous scene took place, in which Lehzen slipped {{a copy of the}} genealogy of the House of Hanover into one of the princess's lesson books. After perusing it for some time, Victoria came to <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> father had been next in line after the king, and that Queen Adelaide had no surviving children. This was the first time Victoria came to realise the destiny that had been assumed by many since her birth; that she would be the next British monarch. After a pause, Victoria is reported to have said [...] "I will be good." [...] This story entered into folk legend for future English generations.|$|E
2500|$|Dr. Bertinot {{checked on}} Joan at 12:30a.m. on March 19. [...] While {{she had not}} improved, she {{appeared}} to have stabilized. Her blood pressure had elevated slightly and she was responding to the peritoneal dialysis. [...] Bertinot felt he could now leave the hospital to get some rest, but Dr. Lanza said he would stay a while longer and would call Dr. Bertinot if anything should change. John Hill also felt he could get some sleep and retired to a couch in a hospital records room. [...] By 1:30a.m., both Dr. Lanza and Dr. Hicks had left the hospital. Joan, who had been heavily sedated, was coherent at times. [...] When Hill told her he would be down the hall if needed, she asked the nurse attending her to <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> husband was made comfortable there.|$|E
2500|$|Her friend's {{attitude}} immediately {{takes on}} a more threatening quality as a sudden lunar eclipse happens above them but before he can do anything he is confronted by Timbaland and SoShy's characters. [...] He tells them that this time he's brought a couple of friends, and the vampire and the cat man appear to back him up only for {{the three of them}} to be frightened away by much larger crowd that Timbaland summons. [...] The woman caught between the two sides looks down to <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> circular birthmark is glowing and looks like the eclipse, and the necklace worn by the vampire who was staring at her in the club. [...] She quickly wakes up from the dream, only to see that the television is playing what it was {{at the start of the}} dream and the phone is ringing with her mother on the other end as the black cat comes in through the window.|$|E

The voyage to find the kingdom results in a shipwreck on an island, which is later discovered to be Yamatai, however the island is [...] also home to savage bandits, who were victims of previous wrecks. Lara's attempts to find a way off the island lead her to discover that the island itself is stopping them from leaving, which she discovered is linked to the still living soul of the Sun Queen, Himiko.

60|$|Julia's voice grew {{still more}} gentle, {{and it was}} easy enough to <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> {{feelings}} were enlisted in the subject.|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, to {{tell the}} truth, I saw then the first signs that I had ever <b>seen</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> temper {{was just a little}} sharp. The {{incident}} however, was too trivial to relate and can have no possible bearing upon the case." ...|$|R
