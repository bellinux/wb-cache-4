25|$|Rico {{appears as}} the main villain and {{antagonist}} in the 1995 Judge Dredd movie, in which Joe was played by Sylvester Stallone and Rico by Armand Assante. In this version, although they were cloned from identical DNA, they did not look the same. Rico was portrayed as a straightforward psychopath, having {{reached a point where}} he killed the innocent {{on the grounds that the}} division between guilt and innocence was merely a matter of timing and everyone would commit a crime in time. His deviant behavior was attributed to <b>something</b> <b>going</b> wrong in his creation which made him the perfect criminal. They were both friends in school (Joe was unaware of their true kinship, but it is unclear when Rico learned about their connection), but when he became a murderer, Joe judged him and sentenced him to execution, and his death was faked to reassure the public and prevent the truth of the clone program coming to light.|$|E
25|$|Another highly {{classified}} U.S. {{study was}} conducted by the CIA's Office of Scientific Investigation (OS/I) {{in the latter half}} of 1952 in response to orders from the National Security Council (NSC). This study concluded UFOs were real physical objects of potential threat to national security. One OS/I memo to the CIA Director (DCI) in December read: the reports of incidents convince us that there is <b>something</b> <b>going</b> on that must have immediate attention... Sightings of unexplained objects at great altitudes and traveling at high speeds in the vicinity of major U.S. defense installations are of such a nature that they are not attributable to natural phenomena or any known types of aerial vehicles. The matter was considered so urgent that OS/I drafted a memorandum from the DCI to the NSC proposing that the NSC establish an investigation of UFOs as a priority project throughout the intelligence and the defense research and development community. It also urged the DCI to establish an external research project of top-level scientists, now known as the Robertson Panel to analyze the problem of UFOs. The OS/I investigation was called off after the Robertson Panel's negative conclusions in January 1953.|$|E

25|$|The Eagles' drive {{carried over}} from the {{previous}} quarter. A completed pass and a run moved the Eagles to the 12-yard line. But on third down, Vick was sacked for a 4-yard loss by DT Rocky Bernard, forcing Philadelphia {{to settle for a}} 34-yard field goal from K David Akers. The Giants received the ball and started at their own 21-yard line, whereupon they put together an 8-play, 79-yard drive. RB Ahmad Bradshaw ran three times for 24 yards. The drive ended on Manning's second touchdown pass to Manningham, this one for 33 yards putting the Giants in the driver's seat, 14–3. The Giants once again stopped the Eagles on their next drive and received the ball. Two passes to Hagan for 27 yards and 11-yard run by Bradshaw helped the Giants get to the Eagles 7-yard line. The Giants were unable to score on third down because of an incomplete pass to TE Kevin Boss. The Giants settled for a 25-yard field goal from K Lawrence Tynes to make the score 17–3. The Eagles tried to get <b>something</b> <b>going</b> on the next drive and it appeared they did when Vick found WR Jeremy Maclin, but the ball came loose before he hit the ground. S Kenny Phillips recovered it and ran it to the Philadelphia 8-yard line. The Eagles called a timeout {{to try to get the}} replay assistant to take a look at the play since it was now under two minutes in the half, but the play was reviewed and it was determined to be a fumble. The Giants took advantage of this and on the next play, Manning found WR Hakeem Nicks for an 8-yard touchdown pass putting the Giants in total control at halftime 24–3.|$|E

Nimoy has stated in multiple interviews that his Fringe role will be the last project in his acting career.|$|E
500|$|The {{windmill}} was a 60-foot-tall forced-perspective exterior (visible to highway travellers miles away), a {{base and}} rooftop set and a quarter-scale miniature. The {{interior of the}} mill, which was about 30-feet high and 25-feet wide, featured wooden gears equipped with mechanisms for grinding flour. A wider view of the windmill was rendered on a Leavesden soundstage set with a quarter-scale windmill, complete with rotating vanes, painted sky backdrop and special-effects fire. [...] "It was scary for the actors who were having burning wood explode at them," [...] Heinrichs recalled. [...] "There were controls in place and people standing by with hoses, of course, but there's always a chance of <b>something</b> <b>going</b> wrong." [...] For the final shot of the burning mill exploding, the quarter-scale windmill and painted backdrop were erected against the outside wall of the [...] "flight shed", a spacious hangar {{on the far side}} of Leavesden Studios. The hangar's interior walls were knocked down to create a 450-foot run, with a 40-foot width still allowing for coach and cameras.

Andrew and Summer are rescued separately, and Natasha has no idea of the reason why Andrew was in the house - he was cheating on her with Summer!" [...] After the rescue, Natasha has to come to terms with the fact she will be scarred from a burn she sustains on her neck. Novakovic said that it is a [...] "big deal" [...] for Natasha, as she aspires to be a model and this could ruin her chances. Novakovic also opines that Summer wants nothing more than to be with Andrew, but how can she take him when Natasha tried to save her? Novakovic believed Natasha was blasé to their feelings adding [...] "Deep down, I think Natasha knows that there's <b>something</b> <b>going</b> on, but she doesn't want to admit it to herself.

Roger Ebert stated that V for Vendetta [...] "almost always has <b>something</b> <b>going</b> {{on that is}} {{actually}} interesting, inviting us to decode the character and plot and apply the message where we will". Margaret Pomeranz and David Stratton from At the Movies stated that despite the problem of never seeing Weaving's face, there was good acting and an interesting plot, adding that the film is also disturbing, with scenes reminiscent of Nazi Germany. Jonathan Ross from the BBC blasted the film, calling it a [...] "woeful, depressing failure" [...] and stating that the [...] "cast of notable and familiar talents such as John Hurt and Stephen Rea stand little chance amid {{the wreckage of the}} Wachowski siblings' dismal script and its particularly poor dialogue." [...] Sean Burns of Philadelphia Weekly gave the film a 'D', criticizing the film's treatment of its political message as being [...] "fairly dim, adolescent stuff," [...] as well as expressing dislike for the [...] "barely decorated sets with television-standard overlit shadow-free cinematography by the late Adrian Biddle. The film is a visual insult." [...] On Alan Moore removing his name from the project, Burns says [...] "it's not hard to see why," [...] as well as criticising Portman's performance: [...] "Portman still seems to believe that standing around with your mouth hanging open constitutes a performance." [...] Harry Guerin from the Irish TV network RTÉ states the film [...] "works as a political thriller, adventure and social commentary and it deserves to be seen by audiences who would otherwise avoid any/all of the three". He added that the film will become [...] "a cult favourite whose reputation will only be enhanced with age." [...] Andy Jacobs for the BBC gave the film two stars out of five, remarking that it is [...] "a bit of a mess... it rarely thrills or engages as a story." ...|$|E

He gave the main event 2 3/4 stars and {{discussed}} {{the amount of time}} it was given, stating it was [...] "just enough time for a suitable main event" [...] but that it did not [...] "leave much flex time for things to run past the bare minimum for a PPV main event title match in a cage much less do whatever they're going to do with Sting and Nash." [...] Keller also disapproved of unprotected use of weapons in the bout, commenting that TNA management needed to start fining [...] "wrestlers for taking unprotected chairshots to the skull" [...] because it was [...] "just not worth the long-term cumulative risks associated with blunt trauma to the skull over years of wrestling." [...] He gave the Last Man Standing bout 4 stars and said it was a [...] "superb match" [...] with a [...] "scaring finish" [...] since the [...] "potential for <b>something</b> <b>going</b> wrong given Angle's legit neck problems was substantial" [...] even if [...] "everything was planned" [...] to work out that way. Keller rated the Street Fight 1 1/2 stars and stated it [...] "was pretty clunky late and early on the crowd brawling got a little repetitive" [...] and that it felt [...] "like yet another weapons match." [...] "The match was okay, but nothing more. The tuxedos and chain served as more of a circus-like distraction than a valuable prop for the match", said Keller in his coverage of the Black Tie Brawl and Chain match, which he gave 1 1/4 stars. Keller gave the World Tag Team Championship match 2 stars, but did not give his opinion outside the rating on the contest. He did comment on the X Division Championship match, saying it was a [...] "very good match" [...] and gave it 3 stars.|$|E
