40|$|The prior {{motivation}} {{of this research}} study {{is to determine the}} ideal condition for dyeing process of <b>spun</b> <b>silk</b> <b>yarn</b> with natural dye extracted from dragon fruit peel using a central composite design. The peel of dragon fruit is contained betacyanin pigment can be utilized to be a natural dye which normally the peel of dragon fruit was discarded as a waste. As the betacyanin pigment was considered to be a newest red dye color in textile application, it is necessary to determine the optimal value for its specific dyeing process. In this experiment, natural dye was extracted from dragon fruit peel using water extraction with the acidified water as a medium. The natural dye was then applied onto the <b>spun</b> <b>silk</b> <b>yarn</b> at different dyeing time (60 – 90 min), pH (3 – 5) and dye concentration (100 – 120 g/L). The dye-uptake of natural dye was measured using UV-Vis spectrophotometer. The result of dye-uptake percentage was employed using analysis of variance (ANOVA). By ANOVA, the dyeing condition was determined as pH of 2, dyeing time of 95 min and the dye concentration of 110 g/L which is generated from the mathematical model.

40|$|Background: Dragon {{fruit is}} one of the plant that can be {{extracted}} to be a natural dye. This fruit is contained a betacyanin pigment which can be dyed on to the textile fibers. The natural dye was extracted using water extraction. The betacyanin pigment was applied onto the <b>spun</b> <b>silk</b> and acrylic <b>yarn.</b> Two kinetic models, the pseudo first order model and pseudo-second order model were selected to follow the adsorption process. Kinetic parameters such as rate constant, equilibrium capacities and correlation coefficients for each kinetic equation were calculated and discussed. Objective: The main objective {{of this study is to}} evaluate the adsorption and kinetic parameters of dyeing betacyanin pigment extract from dragon fruit skin onto <b>spun</b> <b>silk</b> and acrylic <b>yarn.</b> Result: It was shown that the adsorption betacyanin pigment onto <b>spun</b> <b>silk</b> and acrylic <b>yarn</b> could be described by the pseudo-second order. The rate of constant was increased as temperature increased. The activation energy calculated was 55. 7 kJ/mol for <b>spun</b> <b>silk</b> and 44. 5 kJ/mol indicated that the adsorption process was controlled by chemisorption. The thermodynamic parameters such as ΔG°, ΔH° and ΔS° were also calculated. The negative values of ΔG° and ΔH° obtained indicated that the process of adsorption of betacyanin pigment adsorbed onto <b>spun</b> <b>silk</b> and acrylic <b>yarn</b> were spontaneous and exothermic. The values of ΔS° is negative indicated that the randomness of dye molecule distribution was increased as temperature increased. Conclusion: It is concluded that the adsorption of betacyanin pigment onto <b>spun</b> <b>silk</b> and acrylic <b>yarn</b> were favorable and controlled by chemisorption process based on the kinetic and thermodynamic parameters that had been determined...|$|R

The industry had burgeoned after the Civil War: only four of the thirty four silk exhibitors (representing America 2 ̆ 7 s two hundred twenty four silk manufacturers and dealers) could trace their origins to the 2 ̆ 2 times which tried the souls of the silk producers and manufacturers. 2 ̆ 2 The Nonotuck Silk Company, the unlikely descendant of the 18302 ̆ 7 s moth-to-cloth Northampton Silk Company, was one that could and did. After falling twice from the rickety carousel of early nineteenth century enterprises, it seized the brass ring and held on. The key to its success was its manufacture of the first usable 2 ̆ 2 machine twist, 2 ̆ 2 a silk thread strong and smooth enough to withstand the unprecedented demands of the newly invented sewing machine. Nonotuck became one of the nation 2 ̆ 7 s leading silk thread manufactures and Northampton 2 ̆ 7 s largest employer for decades. Yet the details of this key invention have never been spelled out. This paper attempts to fill that gap. The sericulture years: 1830 - 1850. The story begins, not in 1838 as the trade card suggests, but eight years earlier, when Samuel Whitmarsh, a 30 -year-old Boston native, bought a large estate near the center of Northampton with the proceeds of a successful tailoring business in New York and built cocoonery for two million silkworms and two greenhouses for mulberry shoots next to his mansion. Raising silkworm was a popular spring pastime in Northampton in the 18202 ̆ 7 s; Whitmarsh tugged the silkworm from cottage to factory, from hobby to industry. A former linseed oil mill three miles three miles to the north along the Mill River served as his first factory. A few years later, backed by a group of New York and Connecticut financiers, Whitmarsh built a four-story brick one nearby. The new 7 factory hummed with up-to-the-minute machinery. Tourists flocked to see his power loom churn out silk ribbons and vesting. The Northampton Silk Company was incorporated in 1838. But some whispered that the manufacture was mostly a show to persuade the gullible to invest in mulberry trees, whose price increased tenfold in a few short years. The Northampton Silk Company burst with the mulberry bubble. Bankrupt, Whitmarsh withdrew in 1840. Out but not down, he tried, again unsuccessfully, to establish a silk industry in Jamaica a few years later. At the time of his death, in Northampton in 1875, he was planning to raise silk in California...|$|R
