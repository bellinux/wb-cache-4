5|$|The Convair F2Y Sea Dart was an American <b>seaplane</b> fighter {{aircraft}} that rode on twin hydro-skis for takeoff. It flew {{only as a}} prototype, and never entered mass production. It is the only <b>seaplane</b> to have exceeded the speed of sound.|$|E
5|$|Europa was a <b>seaplane</b> {{carrier of}} the Italian Regia Marina (Royal Navy). Originally laid {{down as the}} {{merchant}} ship Manila, she was renamed Salacia in 1898, and then sold to German and then Italian shipping companies in 1911 and 1913, respectively. She became Quarto in 1913, and in February 1915 she was purchased by the Italian fleet, renamed Europa, and converted into a <b>seaplane</b> carrier with a capacity of eight seaplanes. She served as a <b>seaplane</b> base in Valona during World War I and supported the Allied response during the Battle of the Strait of Otranto in 1917. She was quickly sold for scrap in 1920 after the war ended.|$|E
5|$|The German-built <b>seaplane</b> tender Zmaj was {{commissioned}} into the KJRM in 1930, but was {{converted to a}} minelayer in 1937. Captured by the Germans in April 1941, she saw service in the <b>seaplane</b> tender, aircraft rescue and troop transport roles as Drache. In late 1942, she was re-commissioned as a minelayer, and was used for shipboard trials with helicopters in 1943 before being sunk in September 1944.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Seaplanes,</b> {{several types}} (20) - Three SM.55 bombers and three M.41 fighters in August 1936; ten single-engined CANT Z.501 <b>seaplanes</b> in April 1937; four heavy three-engined CANT Z.506 <b>seaplanes</b> in July 1938.|$|R

25|$|It was {{the home}} of the Aeromarine Plane and Motor Company which {{operated}} from 1914 to 1930 and built <b>seaplanes</b> for the United States Navy during World War I. Its planes were mostly military <b>seaplanes</b> and flying boats, including aircraft that offered some of the first scheduled air service using <b>seaplanes.</b>|$|R
5|$|Training as a <b>seaplane</b> {{pilot in}} Hampshire, De La Rue was posted to Wales in February 1917. Later that year, he claimed an {{unconfirmed}} sinking of a German submarine while on coastal patrol. Promoted flight lieutenant in January 1918, De La Rue became an honorary {{captain in the}} Royal Air Force (RAF) that April, following the merger of the RNAS and the Royal Flying Corps. He was posted to No.223 Squadron in Otranto, Italy, later taking command of the unit. While piloting a Short <b>seaplane</b> escorting Allied bombers on a raid against {{the port city of}} Durrës, Albania, he rescued the crew of another <b>seaplane</b> that had been forced down in the Austrian-held harbour. He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for his actions, as well as the Italian Silver Medal of Military Valor.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} the {{decision}} was made, French shipyards were heavily committed to producing vessels for the French Navy. So, despite its intention to develop a French concept, the KSCS engaged Yarrow Shipbuilders in Glasgow, Scotland, to build the ships. Unlike the French, who preferred to install guns of their own manufacture, Yarrow was happy to order the guns from the Czechoslovak firm Škoda. The initial Yarrow design {{was based on an}} enlarged version of the British Shakespeare class, with five Skoda 14 cm/56 naval guns. Excessive top weight resulted in the deletion of one of the guns, to be replaced with a <b>seaplane</b> mounting. The final version replaced the <b>seaplane</b> mounting with improved anti-aircraft armament.|$|E
5|$|Ausonia {{began her}} {{existence}} as a turbine-powered passenger steamer, ordered by Italian Sitmar in 1914. The ship {{was built in}} the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg, under construction number 236. At the time, the only German <b>seaplane</b> carrier was the armored cruiser , which carried two planes. The leadership of the German Navy believed that zeppelins were much more effective than seaplanes, both for reconnaissance and attack. Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz, the architect of the German Navy, was particularly unimpressed by the performance of fixed-wing aircraft. Nevertheless, the Navy developed several naval aircraft before and during the war, including a pair of <b>seaplane</b> fighters, the W.12 and the W.29, both built by Hansa-Brandenburg. Twin-engined torpedo-floatplanes were also designed.|$|E
50|$|Pacific Island <b>Seaplanes</b> was {{established}} in 1999 by Larry 'Dusty' Simon. The air charter company initially operated two de Havilland Canada DHC-2 Beavers and a Britten-Norman Islander aircraft. Pacific Island <b>Seaplanes</b> was acquired by the Christchurch, New Zealand based GCH Aviation in 2013. GCH merged their existing Helicopters (Fiji) operation with Pacific Island <b>Seaplanes</b> to form Pacific Island Air (PIA).|$|R
50|$|In the {{beginning}} of the twentieth century, the island of Kastellorizo was linked by <b>seaplanes</b> to destinations mainly in northeast Africa. The <b>seaplanes</b> used the natural horse-shoe sized harbour of the island.|$|R
50|$|Giuseppe Miraglia {{could carry}} some 17 <b>seaplanes</b> (originally Macchi M.18, later IMAM Ro.43), and was {{equipped}} with two catapults. <b>Seaplanes</b> could be retrieved by means of large doors and cranes {{at the sides of}} the hangar.|$|R
5|$|During World War I, several 14-pounder and 9-pounder {{anti-aircraft}} guns were added, {{with the older}} 9-pounder guns being removed to keep displacement down. In 1930, she was modified to carry a reconnaissance <b>seaplane.</b>|$|E
5|$|Regardless of the {{preference}} toward airships, several small merchant vessels were converted into <b>seaplane</b> carriers during World War I. They carried only {{two to four}} aircraft each, however, and were too slow to operate with the High Seas Fleet. The light cruiser , which was fast enough to steam with the Fleet, was converted into a <b>seaplane</b> carrier in 1918. She too, though, only carried two seaplanes. It was decided to convert the liner Ausonia into a flight-deck carrier for wheeled aircraft as well as floatplanes. The plan for the conversion was drawn up by Leutnant zur See Jürgen Reimpell in 1918, {{an officer of the}} 1st Aviation Detachment.|$|E
5|$|The KJRM {{included}} several miscellaneous vessels {{that were not}} allocated to a particular division. They included the gunnery training ship Dalmacija, the gunboat Beli Orao and the converted <b>seaplane</b> tender/minelayer Zmaj.|$|E

50|$|Corson tended <b>seaplanes</b> at San Diego {{until her}} next {{tour of duty}} in the Western Pacific, which lasted from 8 December 1952 to 4 August 1953. During this tour, she tended <b>seaplanes</b> in Japan, at Okinawa, and in the Pescadores.|$|R
5|$|The NASA Constellation Program {{announced}} Altair as {{the name}} of the Lunar Surface Access Module (LSAM) on December 13, 2007. The Russian-made Beriev Be-200 Altair <b>seaplane</b> is also named after the star.|$|E
5|$|The ship's crew {{compartments}} {{were arranged}} {{such that the}} officers were accommodated in the forecastle. This arrangement {{was found to be}} unsatisfactory, and not repeated in later classes. Von der Tann was designed to be fitted with a lattice mast, but the ship received standard masts instead. In 1914, spotting posts were attached to the masts in order to observe the fall of artillery fire. In 1915, <b>seaplane</b> trials were conducted on Von der Tann, and a crane was attached on the aft deck to lift the <b>seaplane</b> aboard the ship. Von der Tann had originally been equipped with anti-torpedo nets, but these were removed towards the end of 1916.|$|E
5|$|Allingham {{also worked}} in Bacton, Norfolk, further up the coast, where night-flying was {{conducted}} {{and was later}} involved in supporting anti-submarine patrols. A typical patrol would {{last two or three}} days and would involve the manual labour of hoisting a <b>seaplane</b> {{in and out of the}} water by means of a deck-mounted derrick.|$|E
50|$|<b>Seaplanes</b> {{are more}} {{environment}} friendly {{than most other}} aircraft and emit no oil discharge into the water. As the propeller, engine and exhaust are above the water no disturbances are caused to marine life. <b>Seaplanes</b> also have low external noise and an excellent safety record.|$|R
50|$|<b>Seaplanes,</b> {{instead of}} using runways, use water.|$|R

5|$|Assigned {{the serial}} number 1440, the XSO2U-1 flew for the first time, as a landplane, in July 1939; its first flight as a <b>seaplane</b> took place that December. Flight testing of the SO2U showed that the {{aircraft}} lacked directional stability; {{the addition of a}} large ventral fin, connecting the rear of the float to the tail, helped to cure the problem.|$|E
5|$|Bond {{also shows}} his taste for aircraft: a gyrocopter—Little Nellie—features in You Only Live Twice, a Cessna 185 <b>Seaplane</b> in Licence to Kill, an Acrostar Jet in Octopussy, the Space Shuttle in Moonraker and an Aero L-39 Albatros in Tomorrow Never Dies.|$|E
5|$|Picking up Goodnight's {{tracking}} signal, Bond flies a <b>seaplane</b> into Red Chinese {{waters and}} lands at Scaramanga's island. Scaramanga welcomes and shows Bond the {{solar power plant}} operation that he has taken over, the technology for which he intends to sell to the highest bidder. While demonstrating the equipment, Scaramanga uses a powerful energy beam to destroy Bond's plane.|$|E

The alliance considered constructing an airport at Søndre Herøy in Herøy, an archipelago near Sandnesssjøen, but funding was never allocated to the project.|$|E
5|$|The I-351-class {{submarines}} {{were ordered}} under the 5th Fleet Replenishment Program of 1942 to support IJN flying boats {{in areas where}} there were no shore facilities and <b>seaplane</b> tenders could not operate.
