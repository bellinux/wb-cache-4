40|$|The {{effect of}} the <b>seaweed</b> <b>concentrate</b> Kelpak on the growth of {{seedlings}} of three species of Eucalyptus was investigated. A preliminary experiment showed that foliar sprays of Kelpak significantly increased the growth of seedlings of E. nitens and E. macarthurii. The main experiment was carried out on E. grandis, and studied the best method of applying the <b>seaweed</b> <b>concentrate</b> and {{the best time of}} application, Results showed that both foliar sprays and root flushes increased root and shoot growth. For both methods of application, a single dose early {{in the life of the}} seedling was optimal. There was little benefit in applying Kelpak after transplantation.

40|$|The {{effect of}} foliar {{applications}} of a commercially available <b>seaweed</b> <b>concentrate</b> (Kelpak 66) {{on the growth}} and cytokinin content of Phaseolus vulgaris L. plants was investigated. Kelpak 66 at a dilution of 1 : 500 improved the growth of bean plants significantly irrespective of whether it was applied on its own as a foliar spray, or together with soil applications of a chemical fertilizer. Significant differences were also detected in the levels of endogenous cytokinins present in such treated plants. The cytokinin-like activity present in plants treated with <b>seaweed</b> <b>concentrate</b> was {{higher than in the}} control plants. Cytokinin glucosides were detected only in the fruits. The levels of these compounds were greatest in the fruits of plants which received both <b>seaweed</b> <b>concentrate</b> and fertilizer applications.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} particle size (PS) of Rhizoclonium protein concentrate (RPC) on apparent digestibility coefficients (ADC) {{as well as on}} growth and feed efficiency of Pacific white shrimp (Penaeus vannamei) for a period of 30 days. Results showed that white shrimp could effectively digest Rhizoclonium protein concentrate in their diet. Average ADC values for dry matter (ADMD), crude protein (ADCP), and crude lipid (ADCL) were 71. 1 %, 84. 4 %, and 94. 6 %, respectively. A significant inverse relationship (p< 0. 05) was estimated between PS and ADMD (r=- 0. 66, p= 0. 02). Particle size of 150 µm resulted in the highest final body weight (FBW), weight gain (WG), specific growth rate (SGR), feed conversion efficiency (FCE) and protein efficiency ratio (PER). All response parameters exhibited significant inverse correlations with particle size (p< 0. 05). In conclusion, digestibility of <b>seaweed</b> protein <b>concentrate</b> and its nutritive value could be improved by grinding it to an optimum size of 150 µm before dietary inclusion...|$|R
40|$|Improving {{sustainability}} {{in agriculture}} and aquaculture production systems is paramount to global food security and maintaining healthy, diverse ecosystems. One {{way to reduce}} pressure on terrestrial food production systems is looking towards the ocean for food production. With its extensive coastline and intensive salmon aquaculture, Norway is experimenting with macroalgae as a new feedstock for a circular bio-economy. The PROMAC research project was launched in 2015 to assess the Norwegian capacity to produce efficiently macroalgal food and feed commodities. This thesis {{is a part of}} the environmental analysis performed in PROMAC, and contributes by comparing the environmental performances of two similar aquafeed ingredients: Brazilian Soy Protein Concentrate (SPC) and Norwegian <b>Seaweed</b> Protein <b>Concentrate</b> (SWPC). The efficiency and sustainability of these two production systems is assessed using a comparative Material and Substance Flow Analysis accounting for the transfers of primary energy and phosphorus. While a life cycle assessment study is used to model the cultivation of soybeans in Brazil, cultivation data from a single Norwegian seaweed farm is the primary data input to the seaweed cultivation model. Both systems were modelled with sets of assumptions and generic datasets. To compare commodities with similar protein contents, the primary energy and phosphorus footprints of one ton of SPC is compared to two tons SWPC. The primary energy footprint of SWPC (172, 133 MJ) is 11. 68 times larger than for SPC (14, 733 MJ). However, the SWPC footprint can be reduced to 34, 010 MJ by utilizing secondary heat from a waste incineration plant during the late spring harvest. The SWPC system outperformed the SPC system in terms of fossil P footprinting, since one ton of SPC requires 25. 75 kg fossil P while two tons of SWPC require as little as 0. 008 kg fossil P input. Furthermore, results indicate that, while soybean co-products reduce SPC environmental impacts, SWPC co-product biofertilizers can replace the production of mineral fertilizers at a ratio of nearly 1 : 1 and reduces the SWPC fossil P -into negative values, - 26. 36 kg. The overall conclusion of this study is that SWPC holds a competitive advantage based on P management performances, however, replacing SPC will be difficult and require serious innovation and optimization to become energy competitive...|$|R
40|$|Thesis {{submitted}} in fulfilment of {{the requirements}} for the degree Master of Technology: Horticulture in the Faculty of Applied Sciences at the Cape Peninsula University of TechnologyThe effects of liquid Kelpak® and Kelpak® Plantit® disk growth regulator on the growth responses of three selected fynbos species were evaluated in this study. The experiment was arranged using a block design, consisting of 270 plant samples. The experiment consisted of three fynbos species, Coleonema album, Erica verticillata and Leucospermum cordifolium. Each species was subjected to three treatments, the control with no applications, liquid Kelpak® and Kelpak® Plantit® disks (hereafter referred to as disks). The control consisted of 10 plants samples, {{for each of the}} three species, arranged is numerical order 1 - 10. The liquid Kelpak® consisted of 40 plant samples. These 40 plants were divided into 4 groups, containing 10 plants and each group having a different treatment with group 1; 300 ml, group 2; 200 ml, group 3; 100 ml and group 4; 50 ml. The disks consisted of 40 plant samples. These 40 plants were divided into 4 groups, containing 10 plants each and each group having a different treatment with group 1, 2 disks, group 2, 1 disk, group 3, ½ disk and group 4 ¼ disk. The objectives of this study were to assess the desired application of Kelpak® by analysing the physiological improvements or growth responses on of Coleonema album, Erica verticillata and Leucospermum cordifolium. Prior to planting, pre-trial measurements were recorded of each individual cutting. A standard ruler was used to measure the root length and shoot length of each plant, measurements were taken in millimetres. The weight of each plant was measured with a Radwag AS 220 /C/ 2 analytical scale in grams. Plant growth, in terms of plant height was measured on a weekly basis. Plant height was measured with a standard ruler, from the surface of the medium to the tip of the tallest leaf. Watering during the trial period was conducted, using a hand held hose with a rosehead sprayer twice a week and during the third month of the trial once a week. Each container received an average of 250 ml of water. The final week of the trial final readings of the plants was conducted. Plants were carefully harvested and their roots were rinsed with tap water. A standard ruler was used to measure the root length and shoot length of each plant. The roots and shoots were then separated with a secateurs from each other. The fresh weight of each root and shoot weighed and recorded. The combined total weight in grams was captured. The roots and shoots were placed in a manila brown paper bag and placed in a laboratory oven at 55 °C for 48 hours. The plants were then removed from the oven and the dry weight of each root and shoot weighed. The combined total was also recorded. The results indicated that liquid Kelpak® and Kelpak® Plantit® disk had an effect on the growth of fynbos species at different application rates. Liquid Kelpak® and Kelpak® Plantit® disks had significantly increased the shoot, root growth and total weight of plants in C. album grown in 15 cm pots over an 18 week period. The liquid Kelpak® indicated higher growth rates in the initial growing stages of C. album as the liquid was immediately available to the plant. The Kelpak ® Plantit® disks had better influence on the growth over a longer period as the disk dissolved at a slower rate which eventually became available to the plant. The liquid Kelpak® and Kelpak® Plantit® disks had significantly increased the dry root weight and post-harvest root length of E. verticillata grown in 15 cm pots over a period. The Kelpak® Plantit® disks indicated higher growth rates in the dry root weight of E. verticillata but both the liquid and the disk had a positive effect on the post-harvest root length. The results also indicated that the successful rooting of E. verticillata was attributed to rooting hormone Seradix 2 under greenhouse heating environment. Liquid Kelpak® and Kelpak® Plantit® disks had significantly increased the wet and dry shoot weights, dry root weights and post-harvest wet and dry total plant weights of L. cordifolium grown in 15 cm pots over the growth period. The Kelpak® Plantit® disks indicated higher growth rates in the dry shoot weights of L. cordifolium but both the liquid and the disk had a significant effect on the wet shoot weight. The liquid and the disks were also responsible for the improved dry root weight. The liquid application indicated the best post-harvest wet weight but the disks improved the post-harvest dry weights. It can therefore be confirmed that organic <b>seaweed</b> <b>concentrates</b> such as Kelpak® is effective on the growth development of L. cordifolium...|$|R

40|$|To {{evaluate}} the biological value of incorporating the sea lettuce Ulva lactuca meal {{in the diet}} of the black tiger shrimp (Penaeus monodon), 3 diets were fed to groups of shrimps containing two levels (15 % and 30 % replacement of soybean meal) of the sea lettuce for 90 days. Biological parameters were determined either periodically or at the termination of the experiment. Specific growth rate (SGR) of shrimp fed the control diet and those fed with the diet containing 15 % replacement {{were not significantly different}} from each other while that of shrimp fed 30 % soybean replacement was slightly but significantly inferior. All other parameters such as survival rate, feed intake, food conversion efficiency, protein efficiency ratio protein and lipid deposited and body composition were all statistically similar between the experimental groups of shrimp. Thus, the 30 % replacement level or 10. 5 % inclusion level could be used in the diet of the shrimp P. monodon. When performances were compared with the best result in incorporating U. lactuca protein concentrate from a previous study and that in the present study (both were 30 % replacement or 10. 5 inclusion level), they were statistically similar. Thus, the raw U. lactuca meal is recommended because it did not require additional processing to produce the <b>concentrated</b> <b>seaweed.</b> The authors wish to express their gratitude to the Philippine Department of Science and Technology (DOST), Philippine Council for Agriculture, Aquatic, and Natural Resources Development (PCAARD) for the funding and scholarship provided.

Adsorption properties of dried Ecklonia maxima (Osbeck) Papenf., Laminaria pallida ex. J. Ag. and Kelpak waste, the waste product from the manufacture of a commercial <b>seaweed</b> <b>concentrate</b> made from E. maxima, were investigated. The ratio of algal biomass to the initial ion concentration affects ion adsorption. At low ion concentrations, small amounts of sorbent gave the best results.

Smaller sized sorbent particles showed more rapid adsorbance. However, the final ion concentration taken up after 24 hours was not affected by particle size. It is necessary to agitate the sorbent for maximum adsorbance to occur but the rate and method (stirring versus shaking) of agitation had no effect...|$|E

This study investigated the effect of applying a commercial <b>seaweed</b> <b>concentrate</b> (kelpak) on rhizobia growth (Bradyrhizobium strain CB 756 and Bradyrhizobium japonicum strain CB 1809) and nitrogen fixation in cowpea (Vigna ungulata L. Walp.) and soybean (Glycine ma. x L. Merr.) plants. Two concentrations of Kelpak (1 : 100 v/v and 1 : 500 v/v <b>seaweed</b> <b>concentrate</b> dilutions) were applied to pots with seeds or seedlings at sowing and after every 14 days (1 :l 00 A; 1 : 500 A), at sowing and after every 7 days (1 : 100 B; 1 : 500 B) or after germination and after every 14 days (1 : l 00 C; 1 : 500 C). From the first experiment, cowpea plants in the various treatments showed no change in shoot biomass. The root biomass was significantly inhibited in treatment 1 : 100 B relative to the control. The nodule dry matter of cowpea was reduced in 1 : 100 A, 1 : 100 B and 1 : 100 C Kelpak concentrations compared to control, with a significant increase only in 1 : 100 B Kelpak concentration. As a result, cowpea plants showed the highest total biomass in 1 : 500 B treatment. Although shoot N in cowpea plants remained unchanged under the various kelpak treatments, root N was significantly reduced. Soybean plants showed a significant decrease in shoot and root biomass compared to the control. Nodule dry matter was lowest for soybean plants in Kelpak treatments 1 : 500 B, 1 : 100 B and 1 : 100 C. As a result, there was a decrease in soybean total growth in treatment 1 : 500 B compared to the control. Total N in shoots and roots was highest in soybean plants growing in 1 : 500 A relative to the control. Culturing cells of Bradyrhizobium strain CB 756 with Kelpak showed a significant increase in growth at 1 : 100 and 1 : 500 dilutions compared to the control. However, over the 93 h period with sterile Kelpak culture there was an inhibition in growth of strain CB 756 relative to the control. Beyond the 93 h there was a significant increase in growth of Bradyrhizobium japonicum strain CB 1809 in all Kelpak treatments. The 1 : 100 concentration showed the highest bacterial growth compared to the control and the other treatments. These data suggests the presence of an active molecule in Kelpak that stimulates rhizobial growth and its symbiotic interaction with legumes...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAn {{efficient}} and reliable protocol for the in vitro propagation of Dierama luteoalbidum, an endangered and horticulturally important plant is described. D. luteoalbidum seeds were germinated in vitro on full-strength solid (Murashige and Skoog, 1962) medium following decontamination. Hypocotyl explants {{obtained from the}} seedlings formed multiple shoots on MS medium supplemented with 0. 5  mg L− 1 BA (4 shoots being initiated per explant) while {{an increase in the}} BA concentration (1 – 2  m gL− 1) and addition of NAA (1  mg L− 1) increased the incidence of callus. After 6 – 8  weeks, shoots were reduced to meristemoids when transferred to a liquid-shake MS medium supplemented with 0. 5  mg L− 1 BA for mass propagation. These formed secondary shoots after 3 – 4  weeks on solid MS medium containing 0. 5  mg L− 1 BA. Rooting of the plantlets occurred readily but was significantly promoted by adding 6 – 8 % sucrose. Shoots left undisturbed on the same medium for 6  months responded by forming corms. The addition of paclobutrazol (5 – 10  mg L− 1) reduced the corm induction period to 3  months.

Existing industrial techniques for the purification of waste water are expensive. A cheaper alternative may be 'bioremoval', that is, the accumulation and concentration of pollutants from aqueous solutions using biological material. The adsorption of copper, zinc and cadmium using two dried seaweeds Ecklonia maxima and Laminaria pallida (order Laminariales) and Kelpak waste (also made from Ecklonia maxima), a byproduct from the manufacture of the <b>seaweed</b> <b>concentrate</b> Kelpak, were investigated under laboratory conditions, to determine some factors affecting heavy metal adsorption. Ion adsorption from single and mixed metal ion solutions of 10 mgl− 1 and 100 mgl− 1 containing copper, zinc and cadmium were tested at various temperatures and pH. Optimum adsorption occurred at pH 3 and pH 7 and Kelpak waste had equal or superior adsorption ability to dried Ecklonia maxima and Laminaria pallida, particularly for copper. Optimum adsorption occurred at temperatures of 20 °C and 30 °C. Heavy metal adsorption trends by the individual seaweed biosorbent remained constant regardless of the species of anion present. Drying of the experimental material (fan air and oven drying at 85 °C) prior to adsorption cycles resulted in more efficient ion uptake, particularly after additional rehydration.

The effect of pH (pH 4. 5, 6. 5 and 8. 5) and water hardness (200 mg/L and 400 mg/L Ca 2 +) on the growth-promoting ability of Kelpak was assessed using the mungbean rooting bioassay and in a pot trial with Swiss chard. Kelpak promoted rooting in all the treatments in the mungbean bioassay with maximum rooting generally achieved with 20 % Kelpak. With 20 % Kelpak, the addition of 200 mg/L and 400 mg/L Ca 2 + decreased rooting at pH 4. 5, increased rooting at pH 6. 5 and did not affect rooting at pH 8. 5. A similar trend was observed in the pot trial with Swiss chard: leaf and root (fresh weight) and pigment content (chl a, chl b and carotenoids) improved with the addition of 200 mg/L Ca 2 + + 5 % Kelpak at pH 6. 5 or pH 8. 5, while Kelpak was able to partially mask the negative effect of 200 mg/L Ca 2 + at pH 4. 5.
