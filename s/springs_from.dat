5|$|In the 1930 {{state highway}} renumbering, NY5 was {{truncated}} even further {{to begin in}} downtown Buffalo. The portion between Buffalo and Athol Springs was assigned as part of NY62. Southwest of Buffalo, Southwestern Boulevard, an alternate route of US20 between Irving and Big Tree (east of Athol Springs) became NY20B. Further southwest, another alternate route of US20 between the Pennsylvania line and Silver Creek, running along the shore of Lake Erie, was designated as NY20A. The NY20A and NY20B designations proved to be short-lived. US62 was extended into New York , causing NY62 to be renumbered. Around the same time, US20 was realigned to follow NY20B from Irving to Big Tree. NY5 was extended along part of old NY62 to Athol <b>Springs,</b> <b>from</b> where it continued to the Pennsylvania state line by way of US20's old routing to Irving and all of NY20A.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} feature of Western Chalukya roof art {{is the use of}} domical ceilings (not {{to be confused with the}} European types that are built of voussoirs with radiating joints) and square ceilings. Both types of ceilings originate from the square formed in the ceiling by the four beams that rest on four pillars. The dome above the four central pillars is normally the most attractive. The dome is constructed of ring upon ring of stones, each horizontally bedded ring smaller than the one below. The top is closed by a single stone slab. The rings are not cemented but held in place by the immense weight of the roofing material above them pressing down on the haunches of the dome. The triangular spaces created when the dome <b>springs</b> <b>from</b> the centre of the square are filled with arabesques. In the case of square ceilings, the ceiling is divided into compartments with images of lotus rosettes or other images from Hindu mythology.|$|E
5|$|Sources {{report that}} Bela Lugosi and Claude Rains were considered, {{with varying degrees}} of seriousness, for the role of Frankenstein's mentor, Pretorius; others report that the role was created {{specifically}} for Ernest Thesiger. Because of Mae Clarke's ill health, Valerie Hobson replaced her as Henry Frankenstein's love interest, Elizabeth. Early in production, Whale decided that the same actress cast to play the Bride should also play Mary Shelley in the film's prologue, to represent how the story— and horror in general— <b>springs</b> <b>from</b> {{the dark side of the}} imagination. He considered Brigitte Helm and Phyllis Brooks before deciding on Elsa Lanchester. Lanchester, who had accompanied husband Charles Laughton to Hollywood, had met with only moderate success while Laughton had made a strong impact with several films including The Private Life of Henry VIII (for which he had won an Oscar) and Whale's own The Old Dark House. Lanchester had returned alone to London when Whale contacted her to offer her the dual role. Lanchester modeled the Bride's hissing on the hissing of swans. She gave herself a sore throat while filming the hissing sequence, which Whale shot from multiple angles.|$|E

5|$|The Parkway begins where US20 expands to {{a divided}} highway {{southeast}} of Elkhart. To the east in Indiana the freeway feeds into an undivided segment of US20 at County Road 17 (CR17). From there it runs westward {{along the south}} sides of Elkhart and Mishawaka. South of South Bend, US31 joins the Parkway, and then the Parkway turns northward along {{the west side of}} South Bend. Along this segment, US20 turns back west and leaves the Parkway. The Parkway meets the Indiana Toll Road which carries I-80/I-90 before crossing the state line into Michigan. West of Niles, the Parkway meets US12 and continues northwesterly running west of Berrien <b>Springs.</b> <b>From</b> there it runs northward to end at Napier Avenue east of St. Joseph. The St. Joseph Valley Parkway ends at Napier Avenue, but US31 continues as a five-lane highway west along Napier to connect with I-94 {{and the rest of the}} US31 routing north of there on I-196.|$|E

25|$|The double {{chamfered}} pointed tower arch <b>springs</b> <b>from</b> double octagonal respondshalf-piers {{attached to}} walls supporting an arch with octagonal capitals.

The tower interior is unrendered, and within it, at the south-west, is a pointed arch doorway with oak door leading to the upper stages.|$|E

25|$|Still Life <b>springs</b> <b>from</b> a {{meditation}} upon {{the myth of}} Sisyphus, who was sentenced to a weird kind of immortality: he would roll a huge rock {{up to the top}} of a mountain, only for the rock to roll back down. He would then walk down in order to roll the rock up again. Over and over, eternally. Sisyphus is like a working class hero.|$|E
25|$|Egoism <b>springs</b> <b>from</b> a blind instinct; individualism from wrong-headed {{thinking}} {{rather than}} from depraved feelings. It originates as much from defects of intelligence as from {{the mistakes of the}} heart. Egoism blights the seeds of every virtue; individualism at first dries up only the source of public virtue. In the longer term it attacks and destroys all the others and will finally merge with egoism.|$|E
25|$|Embodied mind {{theories}} {{hold that}} mathematical thought {{is a natural}} outgrowth of the human cognitive apparatus which finds itself in our physical universe.

It is held that mathematics is not universal and {{does not exist in}} any real sense, other than in human brains. Humans construct, but do not discover, mathematics.|$|E

25|$|The antiquity of the Hausa origins {{account is}} {{believed}} to be attested by the role which water plays in the story. In the ancient world shrines were built along rivers and at wells or <b>springs</b> <b>from</b> West Central Africa to the Indus River Valley. Serpents inhabited these places and were both venerated and feared. In Sanskrit serpent is naaga, in Hebrew nahash, and in Hausa the serpent is naja.|$|E

25|$|While Ashkenazi cuisine as it {{is known}} today is largely based within the context of American-Jewish and Ashkenazi-Israeli food, much of the culinary {{tradition}} of Ashkenazi Jews <b>springs</b> <b>from</b> Central and Eastern Europe. After having been expelled from Western Europe in the Middle Ages, Jews were forced to live in poverty and thus were limited in terms of ingredients. Dishes were made with fewer components; they weren't heavily spiced and ingredients that were more flavorful had to be used sparingly. This is often why some dishes in Ashkenazic cuisine are known for being blander than dishes in Sephardic or Mizrahi cuisine.|$|E
25|$|The {{degree to}} which social origin affects these {{preferences}} surpasses both educational and economic capital. Demonstrably, at equivalent levels of educational capital, social origin remains an influential factor in determining these dispositions. How one describes one’s social environment relates closely to social origin because the instinctive narrative <b>springs</b> <b>from</b> early stages of development. Also, across the divisions of labor, “economic constraints tend to relax without any {{fundamental change in the}} pattern of spending.” This observation reinforces the idea that social origin, more than economic capital, produces aesthetic preferences because regardless of economic capability, consumption patterns remain stable.|$|E
