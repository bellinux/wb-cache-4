50|$|The {{failure of}} a firm of De Neufville’s size - almost half {{as large as the}} Bank of Amsterdam itself - shocked the markets. The {{immediate}} victims were a group of firms known as “cashiers.” The cashiers were about 30-40 financial intermediaries whose activities formed a bridge between the large banks and merchants. Traditionally, the cashiers had served as brokers in the market for bank funds. By {{the last half of the}} eighteenth century, their activities had expanded to include <b>settlement</b> <b>of</b> <b>bills</b> denominated in current guilders, deposit taking, and even the issue of cashier’s receipts that circulated locally as bank notes. The cashiers were run hard during the first days of the crisis, as panicked holders of cashier’s receipts demanded coin from the issuers. The contraction of the bill market put the Amsterdam merchant bankers under heavy pressure, as their ability to roll over funding was several constricted.|$|E

60|$|Yes, George Hotspur was married: and, {{as far as}} any love {{went with}} him, had married the woman he liked best.

After the copying of the letter and the <b>settlement</b> <b>of</b> the <b>bills,</b> Mrs. Morton had found no difficulty in arranging matters as she pleased. She had known the man perhaps better than any one else had known him; and yet she thought it best to marry him. We must not inquire into her motives, though we may pity her fate.|$|R

50|$|By convention, {{succession}} in Barbados is {{deferred to}} the laws of the United Kingdom; whoever is monarch of the UK is automatically also monarch of Barbados. Succession in Britain is, for those born before 28 October 2011, by male-preference primogeniture and, for people born after 28 October 2011, by absolute primogeniture, governed by common law, the Act <b>of</b> <b>Settlement</b> 1701, <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> Rights 1689, and Succession to the Crown Act 2013. This legislation limits the succession to the natural (i.e. non-adopted), legitimate descendants of Sophia, Electress of Hanover, and stipulates that the monarch cannot be a Roman Catholic and must be in communion with the Church of England upon ascending the throne. Though these laws still lie within the control of the British parliament, the United Kingdom agreed, via adopting the Statute of Westminster, not to change the rules of succession without the unanimous consent of the other realms, unless explicitly leaving the shared monarchy relationship. This situation that applies symmetrically in all the other realms and has been likened to a treaty among these countries. Barbados last indicated its consent to alteration to the line of succession in 2015, when the Governor-General-in-Council brought into force the Succession to the Throne Act, 2013, which signified the legislature's acquiescence to the British Succession to the Crown Bill 2013.|$|R

The purchase of these things, and the <b>settlement</b> <b>of</b> their <b>bill</b> at the National, reduced their finances to so low an ebb, that if the captain had delayed his departure any longer, they would have been in almost as bad a plight as the unfortunate poorer emigrants, who (seduced on board by solemn advertisement) had been living on the lower deck a whole week, and exhausting their miserable stock of provisions before the voyage commenced. There they were, all huddled together with the engine and the fires. Farmers who had never seen a plough; woodmen who had never used an axe; builders who couldn't make a box; cast out of their own land, with not a hand to aid them: newly come into an unknown world, children in helplessness, but men in wants--with younger children at their backs, to live or die as it might happen! ...|$|R
50|$|Succession is, {{for persons}} born before 28 October 2011, governed by male-preference cognatic primogeniture and, for those born after 28 October 2011, by {{absolute}} primogeniture—wherein succession passes to an individual's children according to birth order, regardless of gender. The succession {{is governed by}} the Act <b>of</b> <b>Settlement</b> 1701, <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> Rights 1689, and Royal Succession Act 2013, legislation that also limits the succession to the natural (i.e. non-adopted), legitimate descendants of Sophia, Electress of Hanover, and stipulates that the monarch cannot be a Roman Catholic and must be in communion with the Church of England upon ascending the throne. Though, via adopting the Statute of Westminster (later repealed in New Zealand) and the Imperial Laws Application Act 1988, these constitutional documents as they apply to New Zealand now lie within the full control of the New Zealand Parliament, New Zealand also agreed not to change its rules of succession without the unanimous consent of the other realms, unless explicitly leaving the shared monarchy relationship; a situation that applies symmetrically in all the other realms, including the United Kingdom, and has been likened to a treaty amongst these countries. Thus, New Zealand's line of succession remains identical {{to that of the}} United Kingdom. As such, the rules for succession are not fixed, but may be changed by a constitutional amendment. The Constitution Act 1986 specifies that should a regent be installed in the United Kingdom, that individual will carry out the functions of the monarch of New Zealand.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} {{recipe for}} HP Sauce was invented and developed by Frederick Gibson Garton, a grocer from Nottingham. [...] He registered the name H.P. Sauce in 1895. Garton called the sauce HP {{because he had}} heard that a restaurant in the Houses of Parliament had begun serving it. For many years the bottle labels have carried {{a picture of the}} Houses of Parliament. Garton sold the recipe and HP brand to Edwin Samson Moore for the sum of £150 and the <b>settlement</b> <b>of</b> some unpaid <b>bills.</b> Moore, the founder of the Midlands Vinegar Company (the forerunner of HP Foods), subsequently launched HP Sauce in 1903. In 2013, nearly 140 years since it was established, the Midland Vinegar Company Limited returned to the originators family, with Nigel Britton, great great grandson of the founders, now being the owner.|$|R

2500|$|Legal tender is {{a narrow}} {{technical}} concept for the <b>settlement</b> <b>of</b> debt, {{and it has}} little practical meaning for many everyday transactions such as buying goods in shops. But it does apply, for example, to the <b>settlement</b> <b>of</b> a restaurant <b>bill,</b> where the food has been eaten prior to demand for payment and so a debt exists. Essentially, any two parties can agree to any item of value as a medium for exchange when making a purchase (in that sense, all money is ultimately an extended form of barter). If a debt exists that is legally enforceable and the debtor party offers to pay with some item that is not [...] "legal tender", the creditor may refuse such payment and declare that the debtor is in default of payment; if the debtor offers payment in legal tender, the creditor is required to accept it or else the creditor is in breach of contract. Thus, if in England party A owes party B 1,000 pounds sterling and offers to pay in Northern Irish banknotes, party B may refuse and sue party A for non-payment; if party A provides Bank of England notes, party B must acknowledge the debt as legally paid even if party B would prefer some other form of payment.|$|R
