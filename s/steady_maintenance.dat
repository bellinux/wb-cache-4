60|$|New England, {{owing to}} its famous college, Harvard, and its <b>steady</b> <b>maintenance</b> of the {{literary}} and learned tradition among the clergy, was, naturally, {{the home of the}} earliest great American school of writers. These men--Longfellow, Lowell, Ticknor, Prescott, Hawthorne, and so many others--had all received the same sort of education as Europeans of letters used to receive. They had not started as printers' devils, or newspaper reporters, or playwrights for the stage, but were academic. It does not matter much how a genius begins--as a rural butcher, or an apothecary, or a clerk of a Writer to the Signet. Still, the New Englanders were academic and classical. New England has, by this time, established a tradition of its literary origin and character. Her children are sons of the Puritans, with their independence, their narrowness, their appreciation of comfort, their hardiness in doing without it, their singular scruples of conscience, their sense of the awfulness of sin, their accessibility to superstition. We can read of the later New Englanders in the making, among the works of Cotton Mather, his father Increase Mather, and the witch-burning, periwig-hating, doctrinal Judge Sewall, who so manfully confessed and atoned for his mistake about the Salem witches. These men, or many of them, were deeply- learned Calvinists, according to the standard of their day, a day lasting from, say, the Restoration to 1730. Cotton Mather, in particular, is erudite, literary--nay, full of literary vanity--mystical, visionary, credulous to an amusing degree.|$|E
60|$|The {{horror of}} this barbarous action, {{increased}} by the sacredness {{of the person}} who suffered and of the place where it was committed, diffused itself on all sides with incredible rapidity. The clergy, in whose cause he fell, equalled him to the most holy martyrs; compassion for his fate made all men forget his faults; and the report of frequent miracles at his tomb sanctified his cause and character, and threw a general odium on the king. What became of the murderers is uncertain: they were neither protected by the king nor punished by the laws, for the reason we have not long since mentioned. The king with infinite difficulty extricated himself from the consequences of this murder, which threatened, under the Papal banners, to arm all Europe against him; nor was he absolved, but by renouncing the most material parts of the Constitutions of Clarendon, by purging himself upon oath of the murder of Becket, by doing a very humiliating penance at his tomb to expiate the rash words which had given occasion to his death, and by engaging to furnish a large sum of money for the relief of the Holy Land, and taking the cross himself as soon as his affairs should admit it. The king probably thought his freedom from the haughtiness of Becket cheaply purchased by these condescensions: and without question, though Becket might have been justifiable, perhaps even laudable, for his <b>steady</b> <b>maintenance</b> of the privileges which his Church and his order had acquired by the care of his predecessors, and of which he by his place was the depository, yet the principles upon which he supported these privileges, subversive of all good government, his extravagant ideas of Church power, the schemes he meditated, even to his death, to extend it yet further, his violent and unreserved attachment to the Papacy, and that inflexible spirit which all his virtues rendered but the more dangerous, made his death as advantageous, at that time, as the means by which it was effected were sacrilegious and detestable.|$|E
40|$|All mammals have 50 – 100 μm mannose {{in their}} blood. However, {{the source of}} the dynamic pool of mannose in blood is unknown. Most of it is thought to be derived from glucose in the cells. We studied mannose uptake and release by various cell types. Interestingly, our results show that mannose taken up by the cells through {{transporters}} is handled differently from the mannose released within the cells due to glycan processing of protein-bound oligosaccharides. Although more than 95 % of incoming mannose is catabolized, most of the mannose released by intracellular processing is expelled from the cells as free mannose predominantly via a nocodazole-sensitive sugar transporter. Under physiological conditions, incoming mannose is more accessible to hexokinase, whereas mannose released within the cells is protected from HK and therefore has a different fate. Our data also suggest that generation of free mannose due to the processing of glycoconjugates composed of glucose-derived mannose and its efflux from the cells can account for most of the mannose found in blood and its <b>steady</b> state <b>maintenance...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{establish}} the existence of Na/H exchange in cardiac muscle and to evaluate the contribution of Na/H exchange to pHi regulation. The kinetics of pHi changes in cultured chick heart cells were monitored microfluorometrically with 6 - carboxyfluorescein and correlated with Nai content changes analyzed by atomic absorption spectrophotometry; transmembrane H+ movements were evaluated under pH stat conditions. After induction of an intracellular acid load by pretreatment with NH 4 Cl, a regulatory cytoplasmic alkalinization occurred with a t 1 / 2 of 2. 9 min. pHi regulation required external Na+ and was concomitant with transmembrane H+ extrusion as well as a rapid rise in Nai content in an Na/H ratio of 1 : 1. Microelectrode recordings of membrane potential demonstrated directly the electroneutral character of pHi regulation. Acid-induced net Na+ uptake could be either stimulated by further decreasing pHi or inhibited by decreasing pHo; Na+ uptake was unaffected by tetrodotoxin (10 micrograms/ml), quinidine (10 (- 3) M), DIDS (10 (- 4) M), Clo-free solution, or HCO 3 -free solution. Amiloride (10 (- 3) M) maximally inhibited both pHi regulation and Na+ uptake; the ID 50 for amiloride inhibition of Na+ uptake was 3 microM. Nao-dependent H+ extrusion showed half-maximal activation at 15 mM Nao; Li+, but not K+ or choline+, could substitute for Na+ to support H+ extrusion. Cao-free solution also stimulated acid-induced Na+ uptake. We conclude that pHi regulation following an acid load in cardiac muscle cells is by an amiloride-sensitive, electroneutral Na/H exchange. Stimulation of Na/H exchange up to 54 pmol/cm 2 X s indicates the rapidity of this exchange across cardiac cell membranes. Na/H exchange may also participate in <b>steady</b> state <b>maintenance</b> of pHi...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} two planning problems {{motivated by}} the operations of PSOD air transportation: scheduled maintenance planning, and base location and fleet allocation. In {{the first part of}} the thesis, we study tactical planning for scheduled maintenance which determines the daily maintenance capacities for two operating conditions: a growth phase and the steady state. We model tactical maintenance capacity planning during the growth phase as an integer program and develop an optimization-based local search to solve the problem. Tactical planning of <b>steady</b> state <b>maintenance</b> capacity concerns a special case for which we determine the optimal and the long run capacities with a pseudo-polynomial time algorithm. In the second part of the thesis, we address operational planning for scheduled maintenance which is concerned with assigning itineraries to jets and determining the specific jets to be scheduled for maintenance on a daily basis given a certain maintenance capacity. We present a solution methodology that employs a look-ahead approach to consider the impact of our current decisions on the future and decomposes the problem exploiting the differences between jets with respect to the proximity to their next maintenance. We further develop an integrated framework in order to capture the interaction between operational level maintenance decisions and flight scheduling. In the third and final part of the thesis, we present the tactical level base location and fleet allocation problem. As PSOD air transportation experiences changes in travel demand and fleet size, decisions regarding where to open new bases and how to allocate the number of jets among the bases are made. We first present a solution approach in which high level information about flight scheduling is used in a traditional facility location problem. We next develop a model that works directly with transportation requests and integrates a simplified version of flight scheduling with the base location and fleet allocation decisions in order to capture more detail.

5000|$|Postural {{control has}} been defined as the control of the body’s {{position}} in space for the purposes of balance and orientation. The postural control system adjusts its goal under different circumstances to maintain a <b>steady,</b> erect stance, <b>maintenance</b> of balance, and conservation of energy. There are various methods to identify the dynamics of human balance control. Perturbed standing and Unperturbed standing are usually studied for quantifying balance control. Center of mass (CoM), center of pressure (CoP) and electromyogram (EMG), joint moments, joint angles and angular velocities measures are commonly used to quantify human balance control. Any external or internal perturbation that changes the projection of the CoM to the limits of the base of support, and the alignment between CoM and CoP, may lead to postural challenge. Balance mechanisms are anticipatory postural adjustments (APA), triggered by feedforward mechanisms prior to the perturbation [...] and Compensatory postural adjustments (CPA) that are initiated by sensory feedback signals. In one of the methods, the sensitivity of the CoP, EMG, CoM to external perturbations or to sensory perturbations have been quantified by estimated frequency response functions (FRFs). By combining sensory and mechanical perturbations and measuring both EMG and CoM responses the dynamics of the musculo-skeletal system and the gain and phase characteristics of reflexive feedback pathways are identified separately.|$|R

40|$|Soil {{structure}} of fragile ecosystems should be monitored frequently for soil pore rigidity and aggregate stability. We studied four soil profiles in Eastern Nigeria that are loose, porous, highly weathered and deep {{in order to}} characterize their aggregate water stability upon drying and wetting and their relationship with soil properties. Mean-weight diameter of dry aggregates (MWDd) was largely determined by dry-stable aggregates (DSA) between 1 - 0. 25 mm while the mean-weight diameter of water-stable aggregates (MWDw) was dominated by water-stable aggregates (WSA) between 0. 5 to < 0. 25 mm. The permeability rates for the soils indicated that most horizons were within the moderately rapid to very rapid class. The MWDd correlated significantly with saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks) (r = 0. 68). The MWDw correlated negatively with bulk density (r= - 0. 65). The potential structural deformation index (PSDI) for the soils indicates that soil moisture contents, particle size distribution, soil organic matter (SOM), Ks, bulk density and CEC were soil factors that influenced it.

40|$|In this article, {{we report}} {{the use of}} a variety of {{analytical}} methods, in particular, solid-state 1 H-NMR and 13 C-NMR to characterize the relationship between the condensed-phase chemistry and burning behavior as determined by a series of combustion tests for two commercially derived flexible polyurethane foams, one combustion-modified. The combustion tests showed that the foams met several regulatory requirements in terms of their fire performance, {{whether or not they were}} combustion-modified. Both foams passed the MV SS 302 and CAL 117 small-flame tests. The nonmodified foam failed the Crib 5 test, but this test had a much larger ignition source. The particular problem with the nonmodified foam was melt drip into the flame zone. This led to a <b>steady</b> <b>maintenance</b> of the fuel feed and a rapid escalation of the fire. In contrast, the combustion-modified foam showed little melt drip and self-extinguished. Thermal analysis data for the two foams showed that melamine acted in part as an endothermic heat sink. This alone did not account for the much reduced melt flow and drip of the combustion-modified foam, but the solid-state 1 H-NMR data clearly showed that the molecular mobility of the combustion char from combustion-modified foam was lower than the unmodified foam char, which indicated that the flame-retardant formulation in the combustion-modified foam acted by a condensed-phase mechanism...|$|E
40|$|Large {{numbers of}} blood cells {{need to be}} {{continuously}} replaced in order to sustain the crucial functions of the immune system, oxygen transport and blood clotting. The large diversity of cell types required to maintain {{the integrity of the}} blood system are all produced from blood forming or hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). HSCs have the unique property of self renewal, ensuring life-long replenishment of all the blood cell types. Hematopoietic growth factors, so called cytokines, have previously been demonstrated to be important for the survival and proliferation of committed progenitor cells and development of different blood cell lineages. However, their potential role in regulating HSCs remains to a large degree unresolved. Herein, we provide data that establish the adaptor protein LNK as an important negative regulator of postnatal HSC expansion, acting as an inhibitor of the cytokine Thrombopoietin, known to be important for HSC maintenance and/or expansion. Furthermore, whereas previous studies demonstrated that another cytokine, fms-like tyrosine kinase receptor 3 (FLT 3) ligand (FL), is an important regulator of B cell progenitors but has a redundant role in <b>steady</b> state <b>maintenance</b> of mature B cells, we here demonstrate that FL plays {{a crucial role in the}} regeneration of not only B cell progenitors but also mature B cells after bone marrow (BM) transplantation and chemotherapy. In addition, through studies of FL-deficient mice we show that FL plays an important role in maintaining conventional B cells with age, but is redundant in maintaining a normal compartment of fetally/postnatally derived B 1 and marginal zone B cells. It has been disputed whether FL also is important in HSC regulation. Our present findings establish that FL is not important for regulating HSC maintenance or expansion neither during fetal development or in adult steady state hematopoiesis, nor following BM transplantation or chemotherapy-induced BM ablation. Finally, through identification of a multipotent progenitor in adult BM, with sustained granulocyte-monocyte and lymphocyte potential, but little or no megakaryocyte and erythroid potential, we provide evidence for a strict separation of myelopoiesis and lymphopoiesis, not being the first lineage commitment step of HSCs...|$|R
40|$|As a {{consequence}} of the performance of a randomized controlled clinical trial on perioperative histamine release and cardiovascular and respiratory disturbances, several types of increases in plasma histamine had to be distinguished instead of only two which existed {{at the beginning of the}} study: drug-induced allergic and pseudoallergic reactions. First of all, the new classification by aetiology (clinical epidemiology) was derived from a meta-analysis (secondary analysis) of the most recent literature. According to that histamine release in the perioperative period has several, different causes and is involved in several, different disease manifestations. A clear distinction (classification), however, is necessary if histamine release as an unwanted (adverse) effect has to be recognized, value judged according to its clinical relevance and therefore also prevented by histamine antagonists. Histamine release by neuro-endocrine and neuro-inflammatory mechanisms, cytotoxic histamine release and local, cytokine induced histamine release have been distinguished from pseudoallergic histamine release, but its functions are not yet clear. It has been analysed in prospective trials which used special clinical situations as models: patients on a normal ward or before and during upper GI endoscopy without premedication, but also in specific phases of laparoscopic cholecystectomy (trocar phase and dissection phase). Their existence in the clinical reality is now very likely, but new trials must investigate the pathophysiological effects such as in metabolism, coagulation, pulmonary haemodynamics (shunt volume) and gastric acid secretion. Histamine release by pseudoallergic mechanisms, however, was identified in the very vulnerable post-induction phase of anaesthesia up to skin incision. Its incidence was much higher than ever expected and its clinical relevance was demonstrated by the severity of reactions and the intervention strategies of the anaesthetists who were blinded concerning the type of the plasma substitute given and the prophylaxis with antihistamines. Pseudoallergic histamine release was clearly unwanted (adverse). Its occurrence in the other phases of anaesthesia has to be further evaluated in the tedious procedure of data analysis of the Mainz-Marburg-trial. The overall incidence of histamine release in the trial was so incredible high (72 % of all patients, some of them with up to 4 episodes of histamine release) that a distinction between pseudoallergic (unwanted) and other types of histamine release (possibly less unwanted or even beneficial) is urgently needed. In the phase of <b>steady</b> state (<b>maintenance)</b> of anaesthesia the H 1 -(+) H 2 -prophylaxis was highly effective. Further analysis must show whether this is also the case during the phases of induction of anesthesia. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS...|$|R

Prepublished June 14, 2011; DOI 10. 1182 /blood- 2011 - 03 - 344739. Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are rare residents of the bone marrow responsible for the lifelong production of blood cells. Regulation of the balance between HSC self renewal and differentiation is central to hematopoiesis, allowing precisely regulated generation of mature blood cells at steady-state and expanded production at times of rapid need, as well as maintaining ongoing stem cell capacity. Erg, {{a member of the}} Ets family of transcription factors, is deregulated in cancers and while Erg is known to be required for regulation of adult HSCs, its precise role has not been defined. We show here that although heterozygosity for functional Erg is sufficient for adequate <b>steady</b> state HSC <b>maintenance,</b> Erg+/Mld 2 mutant mice exhibit impaired HSC self-renewal following bone marrow transplantation or during recovery from myelotoxic stress. Moreover, while mice functionally compromised for either Erg or Mpl, the receptor for TPO, a key regulator of HSC quiescence, maintained sufficient HSC activity to sustain hematopoiesis, Mpl-/- Erg+/Mld 2 compound mutant mice displayed exacerbated stem cell deficiencies and bone marrow failure. Thus, Erg is a critical regulator of adult HSCs, essential for maintaining self renewal at times of high HSC cycling.

Periods of steady position holding were interposed between movements. The discharge trains from pairs of motor units were analysed statistically {{in the time}} and frequency domains. During extension movements, when the muscle recorded from was the agonist, coherence between motor units was significant below 12 Hz, with a peak at 6 – 12 Hz in 30 of 36 pairs (83 %). The magnitude of coherence decreased during position holding compared to movements in 26 pairs, while the difference in average firing rate was small. During movements, but not during position holding, coherence estimates between single motor units and acceleration showed a significant peak at 6 – 12 Hz in 56 out of 62 motor units, suggesting that a modulation of motor unit discharge contributed to angular acceleration at these frequencies. Common motor unit modulation was present at 3 Hz as well, although the coupling between motor unit activity was weaker than at 6 – 12 Hz. It is concluded that a 6 – 12 Hz common modulation of agonist motor units is a distinguishing feature of slow voluntary wrist movements, extending the previously established notion of an 8 – 10 Hz rhythmic organization of slow finger movements to more proximal limb segments. It is suggested that the 6 – 12 Hz input is specific for movements and is normally absent or much weaker during <b>steady</b> <b>maintenance</b> of position or force...|$|E
40|$|The {{detrimental}} effects of submergence on physiological performances of some rice varieties with special references to carbohydrate metabolisms and their allied enzymes during post-flowering stages {{have been documented}} and clarified in the present investigation. It was found that photosynthetic rate and concomitant translocation of sugars into the panicles were both related to the yield. The {{detrimental effects}} of the complete submergence were recorded in generation of sucrose, starch, sucrose phosphate synthase and phosphorylase activity in the developing panicles of the plants as compared to those under normal or control (i. e. non-submerged) condition. The accumulation of starch was significantly lower in plants under submergence and that was correlated with ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase activity. Photosynthetic rate was most affected under submergence in varying days of post-flowering and was also related to the down regulation of Ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase activity. However, under normal or control condition, there recorded a <b>steady</b> <b>maintenance</b> of photosynthetic rate at the post-flowering stages and significantly higher values of Ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase activity. Still, photosynthetic rate of the plants under both control and submerged conditions had hardly any significant correlation with sugar accumulation and other enzymes of carbohydrate metabolism like invertase with grain yield. Finally, plants under submergence suffered significant loss of yield by poor grain filling which was related to impeded carbohydrate metabolism in the tissues. It is evident that loss of yield under submergence is attributed both by lower sink size or sink capacity (number of panicles, in this case) as well as subdued carbohydrate metabolism in plants and its subsequent partitioning into the grains...|$|E
40|$|Abridged) A {{simple and}} general {{description}} {{of the dynamics of}} a narrow eccentric ring is presented. We view an eccentric ring which precesses uniformly at a slow rate as exhibiting a global m= 1 mode originating from a standing wave superposed on an axisymmetric background. We adopt a continuum description using the language of fluid dynamics which gives equivalent results for the secular dynamics of thin rings as the the well known description using discrete elliptical streamlines formulated by Goldreich and Tremaine (1979). We use this to discuss the non linear mode interactions that appear through the excitation of higher m modes due to the coupling of the m= 1 mode with an external satellite potential, showing that they can lead to the excitation of the m= 1 mode through a feedback process. Two conditions for the maintainance of a steady m= 1 mode are obtained. One,being the condition for the normal mode pattern to precess uniformly requires a balance between the differential precession induced by the oblateness of the central planet,self-gravity and collisional effects and is the continuum form of that obtained from the N streamline model of Goldreich and Tremaine (1979). The other condition is for the <b>steady</b> <b>maintenance</b> of the non-zero radial action of the ring on account of the normal mode. This requires a balance between input due to eccentric resonances due to external satellites and additional collisional damping associated with the presence of the m= 1 mode We estimate that such a balance can occur in the ϵ-ring of Uranus,given its currently observed physical and orbital parameters.

40|$|Many systems degrade as {{functions}} of their operation and require maintenance {{to extend their}} productivity. When operating under <b>steady</b> conditions, prescheduled <b>maintenance</b> {{can be used to}} ensure such systems meet their required levels of productivity at lowest cost. However, using pre-scheduled maintenance on systems that degrade as {{functions of}} their operation under uncertain, varying conditions will not guarantee that they meet their productivity at lowest cost. They require maintenance schedules that accommodate changes in their operating conditions and degradation. This research develops a prognostic maintenance methodology that ensures a system degrading with its operation under variable, uncertain operating conditions meets its desired productivity at the lowest cost. An example of a degrading system under variable, uncertain operating conditions is a photovoltaic-powered reverse osmosis (PVRO) desalination system. PVRO desalination can provide drinking water to remote communities in sunny areas with saline water sources. Such systems produce clean water and degrade as functions of their operating conditions, including solar radiation, water chemistry and community demand. These conditions are not constant, but vary stochastically. Maintenance (system flushing and cleaning) will extend a PVRO system's productivity, but requires time, chemicals and use of the clean product water. Hence, it has a substantial impact on the total cost of water production and should be adjusted in response to variations in operation. The community members who generally operate and maintain PVRO systems do not have the training or experience to determine the best type and timing of maintenance to ensure their water demand is met at lowest cost, and require a method to do so. Here, prognostic maintenance methodology is developed and applied to community-scale PVRO desalination. Degradation (fouling) and remediation (cleaning) of the RO membrane have the largest impact on the system productivity and water cost, and hence are the focus of this study. Fouling and cleaning are complex functions of water chemistry and system operation. Physics-based mathematical models of fouling and cleaning rely on two critical unknown parameters: fouling rate and cleaning effectiveness. They can be determined using system identification methods in real time, using measurements of the PVRO feed water pressure and clean water production rates. The identified fouling and cleaning models are combined with statistical models of the expected future PV power and community water demand to predict the type and timing of future maintenance procedures. The maintenance protocols are adjusted in real time in response to changes in identified fouling. The prognostic algorithm developed here is suitable for implementation on a PVRO system's embedded microcontroller. Case studies presented here show that the prognostic maintenance methodology provides non-expert operators with near optimal maintenance protocols when compared with conventional periodic scheduling, especially under varying degradation, solar radiation and demand. In this example study, annual maintenance happens to be nearly optimal, so the prognostic maintenance algorithm produces a nearly annual cleaning schedule that minimizes maintenance costs. Since the statistical nature of this example prevents demand from being met 100 % of the time, the prognostic maintenance method is used to minimize cost and water loss. On average, following the prognostic maintenance protocol results in less than 4 % loss of water over a 5 -year period at lowest cost. Although developed in the domain of PVRO, the prognostic maintenance methodology developed here is anticipated to be applicable to other systems that degrade as functions of their operation, including machine systems, vehicle fleets and transportation networks. by Leah C.

Es gibt allerdings zahlreiche der zumeist alten Patienten, die einer solchen Therapieform nicht zugeführt werden können (Inoperabilität, Ablehnung der Operation). Für diese Patienten stellt die palliative, endoskopische Lasertherapie nach wie vor eine effiziente Alternative dar. Im Rahmen einer prospektiven Untersuchung von 61 Patienten wurde über einen 3 jährigen Beobachtungszeitraum der Einfluß der palliativen Therapie mit dem Neodym:YAG-Laser auf die Symptomatologie fortgeschrittener rektosigmoidaler Tumore analysiert. Die Ergebnisse bestätigten den auch in anderen Studiengruppen beschriebenen Kurzzeiteffekt (Behandlungsdauer bis zu 3 Monaten), wonach die tumorbedingte Darmokklusion durch den Laser beherrscht werden kann und damit die Anlage eines Anus praeter vermieden wird. Besonderes Augenmerk wurde auf 32 Patienten gelegt, die längerfristig behandelt wurden, da bezüglich eines Langzeiteffekts in der Literatur kaum Angaben zu finden sind. Behandlungs-dauer: min. 3, 5, max. 16, 8 Monate. Tumorlokalisation: Rektum und rektosigmoidaler Übergang. Die Ergebnisse der ersten 3 Behandlungsmonate (statistisch signifikanter Rückgang für abdominale Beschwerden und peranale Blutungen) lassen sich nicht fortsetzen, aber es wird eine Art "steady state" erreicht. Die wichtigste Zielgröße der Therapie, die Sicherung der Darmpassage, konnte bei dieser Patientengruppe in 87, 5 % erreicht werden. Die methodenbedingte Komplikationsrate liegt bei 6, 3 %; die therapiebedingte Letalität beträgt 0 %. Problematisch ist der Anteil von Patienten mit Stuhlinkontinenz, der im Verlauf der Therapie von 6, 2 % auf 40, 6 % drastisch anstieg. Dennoch sahen nahezu 90 % der Patienten ihre Lebensqualität erhalten, da es sich meist um Inkontinenz I. oder II. Grades handelt, was von der Mehrzahl der Patienten angesichts ihrer Lebenssituation toleriert wird. Somit stellt die endoskopische Lasertherapie auch unter dem Aspekt der Langzeitpalliation die Behandlung der Wahl dar. Im Vergleich mit der palliativen Anlage eines Anus praeter besitzt der Laser trotz Wieder-holungsbehandlungen deutliche Vorteile: die Therapie ist ambulant durchführbar, kostengünstiger, komplikationsärmer und führt zur besseren Symptombeeinflussung.

Special attention was given to 32 patients treated for a longer duration, since reference in the medical literature relating to long-term effects of lasertherapy are rarely to be found. Duration of treatment: 3, 5 to 16, 8 months. Tumour location: rectum and rectosigmoid. The results of lasertherapy during the first 3 months (statistically significant reduction of abdominal symptoms and bleeding) cannot continue but it can be achieve a <b>steady</b> state. The <b>maintenance</b> of luminal patency as the most important aim of therapy in these group of patients was achieved in 87, 5 %. The rate of method-related complication was 6, 3 %; the treatment-related mortality was 0 %. Problematic is the increase in fecal incontinence from 6, 2 % to 40, 6 % seen in the patient group during the therapy. However nearly 90 % of the patients did not report significant reduction in life quality, since most fecal incontinence can be classified as first or second degree, which is tolerated by the patients in their current life situation. Consequently, the endoscopical laser-therapy is the treatment of choice also under the aspect of long-term palliation. The laser has clear advantages in comparison with the palliative colostomy in spite of the need for repeated applications: possibility of outpatient treatment, cost-effectiveness, low complication rate and better influence on symptomatology...|$|R
40|$|The rate of {{anaerobic}} digestion (AD) often {{depends on the}} rate-limiting hydrolysis step that makes organics available to microorganisms. To achieve efficient conversion of particulates to soluble materials and finally methane, the biomass in the digester must be provided with optimal operational conditions that will allow for biomass retention and substrate metabolism. Two approaches were employed in this study to improve the ultimate biodegradability of waste activated sludge (WAS) - Pre-treatment (PT) and operation using an Anaerobic Membrane Bioreactor (AnMBR). PT of WAS {{is one way of}} speeding up hydrolysis. It has been proposed that PT leads to the lysis of cells, which in turn causes the release and solubilisation, and thus availability of intracellular matter to microorganisms for microbial growth and metabolic activities. This study compared the effect of thermal, sonication, and sonication + hydrogen peroxide PT on chemical oxygen demand (COD) solubilisation of WAS. Based on the soluble COD (SCOD) release, it was concluded that combined chemi-sonic treatment resulted in better WAS degradation rather than individual ultrasonic pre-treatment and thermal PT. The highest solubilisation rate was observed at a chemi-sonic PT of 50 gH 2 O 2 /kgTS and sonication duration of 60 minutes. At this PT, a COD solubilisation of 40 % was observed which was significantly different than PT involving only sonication and no pre-treatment (0. 88 %) at 95 % confidence. Therefore a peroxide-sonic PT was chosen to treat WAS in this study as it was expected to result in the greatest improvement in WAS biodegradability. In addition to PT, biodegradability of WAS can also be improved by coupling PT with an AnMBR. AnMBRs prevent biomass washout by decoupling the solids retention time (SRT) from the hydraulic retention time (HRT). Thus, a long SRT can be used to provide sufficient duration for biological activities without increasing the volume of the reactor. In this study, a 4. 5 L AnMBR with an HRT and SRT of 3 and 20 days, respectively was used to treat raw and PT WAS. In order to compare the biodegradability of PT and raw WAS, the AnMBR was operated in three phases. Phase 1 was operated with raw WAS, Phase 2 was operated with WAS pre-treated with 50 gH 2 O 2 /kgTS and 20 minutes ultrasound (US), and Phase 3 was operated with WAS pre-treated with 50 gH 2 O 2 /kgTS and 60 minutes US. The anaerobic biodegradability of WAS following a combination of ultrasonic pre-treatment and H 2 O 2 addition was significantly improved, with Phase 3 resulting in the greatest improvement. The COD destruction for phases 1, 2, and 3 were 49 %, 58 %, and 63 %, respectively whereas the volatile suspended solids (VSS) destruction for phases 1, 2, and 3 were 46 %, 71 %, and 77 % respectively. Organic Nitrogen (Org-N) destruction increased from 44 % to 52 % for phases 1 and 2 respectively. A further increase of 18 % in Org-N destruction was observed in phase 3. This improvement in biodegradability of WAS was attributed to the high solubilisations of COD, VSS, and ON and conversion of non-biodegradable materials to biodegradable fractions. In order to determine the effect of PT of WAS on membrane performance, the transmembrane pressure (TMP) and fouling rate were monitored throughout the operation of the AnMBR. Negligible variation in membrane performance was observed over all three phases. At a constant low flux of 2. 75 litres/m 2 /hour (LMH), the TMP and the fouling rate remained low over the course of operation. In order to maintain the performance of the membrane, maintenance cleaning with 50 ml of 2 g/L critic acid solution followed by 50 ml of 0. 2 g/L sodium hypochlorite was performed three times a week. In addition, a gas sparing rate of 2 L/minute and a permeation cycle of 10 minutes with 8 minutes of operation followed by 2 minutes of relaxation was employed. During phase 2 of this study, a new membrane was installed due to a faulty gas sparging pump. A slight decrease of TMP was observed with the installation of the new membrane; however the decrease was minimal. In addition critical flux for phases 2 and 3 were determined to be in the range of 6 to 12 LMH. In conclusion, the incorporation of H 2 O 2 -US PT with AD could allow treatment plants to substantially reduce the mass flow of solids and organics and thus result in a decrease in requirements for downstream sludge processing. With sufficient <b>maintenance,</b> <b>steady</b> operation could be achieved for a hollow fibre AnMBR with a total solids concentration range of 20 - 25 g/L, an HRT of 3 days, and an SRT of 20 days. It was found that PT could be successfully integrated with AnMBR to substantially reduce the HRT required for digestion when compared to conventional designs...|$|R
40|$|As {{discussed}} in last year`s Activity Report, a fairly complete analysis of SPEAR problems {{was performed in}} concert with SLAC, and a major maintenance/improvement process was initiated {{in the spring of}} 1989. This run made it apparent that SPEAR will remain a very useful and impressive synchrotron radiation storage ring for at least a decade, given a <b>steady</b> <b>maintenance</b> and improvement program. More details about SPEAR functioning during the run, as well as SPEAR improvements, are contained in Chapter I. The formal SPEAR injector construction project was completed in November, 1990, on-time and on-budget. Although DOE was not able to provide anticipated FY 90 commissioning funds, preliminary commissioning was performed and 2. 3 GeV injection to SPEAR was demonstrated. A discussion of the Injector project is contained in Chapter II. Commissioning of the injector and the injector/SPEAR complex is continuing in 1991 with Users participating during the May-September period. This user participation allowed normal experimentation, so that systems could be tested critically, but with the commissioning process having higher priority than data acquisition. Another major event in 1990 was the full dedication of SPEAR to the synchrotron radiation program. Previously SPEAR was considered a high energy physics machine that was partially dedicated to synchrotron radiation. The full dedication means that the accelerator can be modified and improved for synchrotron radiation research. Despite the heavy emphasis on completing the Injector, many beam line improvements were achieved, as described in Chapter IV. Among these was the optimization of stations 6 - 2 and 10 - 2, the provision of a considerably larger hutch for Station 1 - 5, which contains the area detector diffractometer, and the introduction of white light capability on 10 - 2. The provision of good beam during the month of April made an appreciable amount of experimentation possible. These and other runs are described in Chapter VI...|$|E
40|$|Human {{skeletal}} muscles possess thixotropic, i. e. history-dependent mechanical properties. This {{means that}} the degree of passive muscle stiffness and resting tension is dependent on the immediately preceding history of contractions and length changes. Athletes, for instance, reduce passive muscle stiffness by various types of ‘limbering-up’ procedures, whereas muscle stiffness gradually increases during inactivity. Passive resistance of antagonistic muscles may significantly add to the total load during voluntary muscle contractions. This resistance may vary from one moment to another, depending on immediately preceding events. This research was conducted to determine whether history-dependent variations in passive muscular forces influence motor control of voluntary joint movements and <b>steady</b> <b>maintenance</b> of joint positions in healthy subjects. In study I, the EMG signal revealed motor compensations for history-dependent variations in passive stiffness of the antagonists during slow voluntary wrist joint movements. Studies II and III demonstrated that the voluntary muscle activity required to maintain a certain wrist joint position was highly influenced by previous changes in forearm muscle length and contractions. Study IV showed that rapid voluntary movements varied in speed and onset time depending on the prevailing degree of muscle resistance, and in addition that the central nervous reaction time required to execute rapid movements was highly influenced by immediately preceding muscle-conditioning procedures. History-dependent variations in passive muscular forces seem to be effectively compensated by the motor control system. Presumably, voluntary motor commands to the muscles are automatically adjusted in strength to history-dependent changes in passive muscular forces. Such adjustments occur within the central nervous system, which receives information about the mechanical state of the muscles. Several issues in connection with muscle thixotropy remain unaddressed. For instance, do alterations in the normal thixotropic mechanical behaviour of the muscles impose a particular problem in patients with certain neuromuscular diseases...|$|E
40|$|This paper, part of {{a larger}} project on {{governance}} and growth in Russia. It deals with the problems and priorities of the future development of primary producer regions of Russia. We design a regional strategy for socioeconomic development to 2025 - 2030. The analysis concerns growth and diversification of the economy of regions, where raw materials are abundant, in order to scale back the exploitation of mineral resources and diversify the economy. Almost all strategies involve a gradual change of the vector in the direction of modernization and diversification of the economy. We emphasize that the important role here is for a new regional policy. The paper examines regional financial resilience in Russia in the period following the global financial crisis. The level of risk is rising, as government emergency finance is withdrawn and regions face rising debt to cover even operational expenses, but "resource" regions seem securely well off, despite having been most affected by the financial crisis. This paper examines one region, Khanty-Mansiysk autonomous okrug (KhMAO), the largest "donor" to the federal budget, against the background of other mineral resource abundant regions. It traces developments since the dramatic budget reforms (late 1990 s through 2005), including centralization of revenues and rationalized program expenditure (Alexeev and Weber 2013). It assesses regional budget and debt management in response to pressures from increased federal required expenditures, post-crisis withdrawal of subsidies, and the roll-out of new debt guidelines. It describes and explains KhMAO's stability and relative autonomy in these crisis conditions. The key questions are: Why are these "donor" regions, more affected by the crisis than others, also more resilient? Is Russia's growth core of regions financially stable because of federal intervention? How vulnerable is the resource region to future oil price shocks? Our findings are tenative, since there remain questions about transparency and soft budget constraints (Plekhanov 2006). We show federalism at its most cooperative: among other factors, regional collaborative action fosters flexible budgeting. In the longer run, the resilience of resource regions, such as KhMAO, with their overall steady growth, despite volatility in oil prices, arguably is due geopolitical factors, which attract energy producers and industrial giants other than in the oil sector, and the business environemnt, including <b>steady</b> <b>maintenance</b> of a higher standard of living and skills attracted in new clusters, which are supported by innovation-oriented budgets. The findings here, however, also include, even more fundamentally, an evolvinig cooperative federalist agenda, with groups of regions acting together to secure negotiated decisions on tax allocations and spending requirements. Supportive of the conclusion in Chebankova (2008), the term adaptive federalism applies to finance, and compels a rethinking of the concept of fiscal rigidity as applied to the Russian Federation...|$|E
40|$|The rapid {{increase}} {{followed by a}} <b>steady</b> <b>maintenance</b> of elevated levels of obesity in the United States is alarming and necessitates action. While behavioral treatment of obesity is showing moderate success of initial weight loss, maintenance of lost weight is more common than traditional calorie restrictive dieting approaches. This is particularly relevant {{during the holiday season}} where people can gain 1 - 5 % of their total body weight during this short period of time. Therefore, it is critical that we explore additional ways to help individuals maintain their lost weight, particularly during a challenging time of year.    The {{purpose of the study was}} to examine the impact of using Direct Behavior Ratings via the Internet to help individuals successfully maintain their weight immediately following completion of a treatment program over a 6 -week period during the holidays. The pilot study operated within a behavioral framework to deliver evidenced based formative assessment through the use DBR as a progress monitoring and self-monitoring tool delivered via the Internet through bi-weekly emails. Additionally, tailored quantitative and qualitative feedback was integrated through reports issued bi-weekly that contained graphical representations of the data in addition to therapeutic statements regarding individual progress.    The pilot study consisted of a two-phase design wherein Phase I (non-experimental) was the initial treatment and Phase II (experimental) was the follow-up treatment. Phase I treatment consisted of the ASPIRE Small Changes Program utilizing cognitive behavioral therapy with the Traffic Light Diet and pedometers for physical activity. Initially, 16 participants were recruited from the ASPIRE Small Changes Program at East Carolina University's Psychological Assessment and Specialty Services (PASS) clinic; 14 participants were included in the final analysis.    At the conclusion of treatment, group level weight maintenance was achieved. In addition, strong relationships were noted between the variables of red foods and green foods and compliance indicating participants who reported higher levels of success in meeting red and green food goals were also more likely to complete and return ratings as hypothesized. A strong relationship between weight change in Phase I and ratings of success in meeting red, green, and step count goals was evident.    The weight maintenance achieved in our pilot sample provides promise for future utilization of DBR as a follow-up treatment delivered via the Internet. Based on our preliminary data there is reason to believe success in Phase I of treatment can encourage long term maintenance of dietary balance with minimal intervention. The findings of our pilot sample offer additional insight into the treatment of obesity and overweight with particular relevance to achieving follow-up weight maintenance. Subsequent research should continue to explore the utility of DBR for self-monitoring of healthy weight behaviors and the modality of the Internet for treatment delivery.   M. A...|$|E
