50|$|Charlie {{eventually}} began harassing Shelley {{at every}} opportunity. At one point, {{he tried to}} make her choose between him and her mother, Bev (Susie Blake). On one occasion he ripped out Shelley’s earrings in a fit of rage. When he asked his colleague Jason Grimshaw (Ryan Thomas) for a <b>sealent</b> gun, Betty Williams (Betty Driver) overheard their conversation on the phone and thought Charlie wanted a genuine firearm. She phoned the police and he was arrested. When he was released, however, he became less violent. He accidentally opened a door which hit Shelley in the face. This caused him to lock her in her bedroom to stop people seeing her face as he knew people would think he was abusing her. Charlie later began to abuse Shelley mentally rather than physically, which caused her to develop agoraphobia. However, she received treatment and Charlie proposed to her, but she jilted him on their wedding day. Despite begging for forgiveness, Shelley refused reconciliation.|$|E
40|$|The Aims of this {{research}} was to know the differenrence of fluor content in saliva and plaque after was fissured <b>sealent</b> with Fuji VII. Research approach was experimental with Post test only group design. Research subject were twenty two children at 9 - 10 years old. Fluoride counted on subject at before fissured <b>sealent</b> at 1 days and after fissured <b>sealent</b> at 7, 14, 40 days. Every observated time, The data 2 ̆ 7 s of fluor was measured using Spektrofotometri DR 2000. Then data 2 ̆ 7 s were analyzed by using Two Way repeated Anova test. The result showed there was a difference of fluor amount at saliva and plaque after fissured <b>sealent</b> at every time observation (Two Way repeated Anova significanve). There was highest realesed fluor amount at 7 days after fissured <b>sealent</b> and there was lower realesed fluor amount toward at 14, 40 days. The Highest amount of fluor at saliva compared to plaque...|$|E
30|$|Similarly, {{stripping}} of the cyst wall {{also appears}} to have a detrimental effect on ovarian reserve due to inadvertent removal of ovarian tissue [12]. Using histological data, Roman et al. demonstrated that normal ovarian tissue was removed in 97  % specimens of surgically removed endometriomata [13]. Furthermore, it appears that ovarian cortex containing endometrioma appears to have significantly reduced density compared to normal ovarian cortex, and therefore, loss of oocyte containing normal ovarian cortex may be unavoidable in cystectomy for endometrioma [14]. Matsuzaki et al. conducted a histological assessment of cystectomy specimens and found that normal ovarian tissue adjacent to cyst wall was found in 58  % (71 / 121) of patients with endometrioma, whereas normal ovarian tissue was excised in 5.4  % (3 / 56) following cystectomy for other benign cysts [15]. Donnez et al. reported the use of combined stripping and vaporization technique was safe with regard to protecting an ovarian reserve [16]. More recently, Ata et al. reported that mean decline of AMH levels was less in suturing and haemostatic <b>sealent</b> technique compared to bipolar desiccation suggesting energy sources may have more detrimental effect on ovarian reserve [17].|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} {{role and}} benefit of fibrin glue over tackers for mesh fixation in laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair. Backgroud: Mesh fixation by tackers {{may lead to}} many complications peroperatively like bleeding, increased hospital stay and overall more cost and later on chronic groin pain. Material and Methods: 60 inguinal hernia with age more than 18 years were taken and were divided in two groups; 30 patient group who underwent TAPP and 30 patient group who underwent TEPP. In 15 patients in both groups tackers were used and in other half fibrin glue was used for fixation of mesh using a 3 mm catheter (Duplotip: Baxter Healthcare), which fits the Tisseel syringe. Results: The use of fibrin <b>sealent</b> has a distinct advantage in laparoscopic treatment of inguinal hernias compared with use of tackers {{as a method of}} mesh fixation. The use of fibrin sealant reduces the risk of post- and intraoperative complications, such as bleeding, seroma, chronic pain, has a lower incidence of postoperative neuralgia and provides an early faster return to social life. The recurrence rates do not vary much, but the operative time is slightly longer if the preparation time of the fibrin sealant is taken into consideration. In our study, we found a marginal difference in the cost of the two groups, fibrin sealant and stapled tackers. [Cukurova Med J 2015; 40 (3. 000) : 457 - 465...|$|E
