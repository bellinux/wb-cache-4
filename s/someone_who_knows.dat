25|$|Ireland had no regular central {{authority}} {{capable of making}} new law and hence the Brehon laws were entirely {{in the hands of}} the jurists. As such some early scholars felt that the legal system was essentially unchanging and archaic. However, more recently scholars have noticed that some methods of change were laid out within the Brehon laws. In particular, Cóic Conara Fugill mentions five bases on which a judge must base judgment, and at least three offer some room for change: fásach (legal maxim), cosmailius (legal analogy), and aicned (natural law) (the other two are roscad, a type of legal verse jurists were trained to create to mark a statement made by <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>knows</b> the law and teistimin (scriptural testimony)). However, it has not yet been studied in detail how exactly these three innovative methods were used.|$|E
25|$|As for the ultra-orthodox Cubists such as M. Gleizes, {{they are}} {{becoming}} very tiresome. <b>Someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>knows</b> M. Eugène Figuière assured me that he saw a strong resemblance in M. Gleizes's portrait of that eminent publisher, who must, in that case, be made of gun-metal or some similar substance. It may be my stupidity, but I cannot understand what {{this sort of thing}} means or what the artist is driving at. There are a few other paintings which may, presumably, be called Cubist in default of any better name, which are merely patterns in bright colours, such as M. Picabia's and M. Metzinger's. One of M. Metzinger's pictures is a puzzle made up of a leg, an arm, a hat, a parasol, and various other objects, and is called En Canot. These patterns have certain decorative qualities and might do for a carpet or a hanging, but they are absurd in frames, and it is a mere affectation to give them titles.|$|E
25|$|In {{his famous}} work, Adhyatmopanisatprakarana {{he argued that}} no body of ‘theory’ (sastra), whether Jain or non-Jain, is to be {{accepted}} merely {{on the basis of}} sectarian interest. Instead, the theory should be subject to testing, just as the purity of a sample of gold is determined by tests involving rubbing, cutting and heating (1.17) In one of the ethical works, the Jnanasara, Yashovijaya describes 32 moral and intellectual virtues that constitute a virtuous character. Out of these, two are distinctive: neutrality (madhyasthata) and groundedness in all view-points (sarvanayasraya). Neutrality is explained in terms of the dispassionate use of reason: a person who embodies this virtue follows wherever reason leads, rather than using reason only to defend prior opinions (16.2). Yashovijaya stresses that neutrality is not an end in itself, but a means to another end. We adopt a neutral attitude, he says, in the hope it leads to well-being (hita), just as <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>knows</b> that one among a group of herbs is restorative but does not know which one it is, acts reasonably if they swallow the entire lot (16.8).|$|E

500|$|Cott was a protege of John Graham Kerr who had quarrelled with Norman Wilkinson in the First World War about dazzle {{camouflage}} for ships. Wilkinson remained {{influential in}} 1939 as an inspector of camouflage, so a political argument developed. Cott {{was invited to}} camouflage a 12-inch rail-mounted gun, alongside a similar gun camouflaged conventionally. Cott carefully combined disruptive contrast {{to break up the}} gun barrel's outlines with countershading to flatten out its appearance as a solid cylinder. The guns were then photographed from the air from various angles, and in Peter Forbes's view [...] "the results were remarkable." [...] Cott's gun is [...] "invisible except to the most minute scrutiny by <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>knows</b> exactly where to look and what to look for. The other gun is always highly visible." [...] The authorities hesitated, appearing to be embarrassed by the evidence that Cott was right, and argued that countershading would be too difficult to use as an expert zoologist would be needed to supervise every installation. Cott was posted to the Middle East, and Kerr unsuccessfully intervened, pleading for guns to be painted Cott's way and Cott to be brought home.|$|E
500|$|In July 2010, Minogue {{released}} her eleventh studio album, Aphrodite. The album featured new songwriters and producers including Stuart Price as executive producer. Price {{also contributed to}} song writing along with Minogue, Calvin Harris, Jake Shears, Nerina Pallot, Pascal Gabriel, Lucas Secon, Keane's Tim Rice-Oxley and Kish Mauve. The album received favourable reviews from most music critics; Rob Sheffield from Rolling Stone labelled the album Minogue's [...] "finest work since 1997's underrated Impossible Princess" [...] and Tim Sendra from Allmusic commended Minogue's choice of collaborators and producers, commenting that the album is the [...] "work of <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>knows</b> exactly what her skills are and who to hire to help showcase them to perfection". Aphrodite debuted at number-one in the United Kingdom, exactly twenty two years after her first number one hit in the United Kingdom. The album's lead single, [...] "All the Lovers," [...] was a success and became her thirty-third top ten single in the United Kingdom, though subsequent singles from the album, [...] "Get Outta My Way", [...] "Better than Today", and [...] "Put Your Hands Up", failed {{to reach the top}} ten of the UK Singles Chart. However, all the singles released from the album have topped the US Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs chart.|$|E
500|$|Taraborrelli {{commented that}} [...] "in the end, the events {{surrounding}} 'Like a Prayer' only served to enhance Madonna's reputation as a shrewd businesswoman, <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>knows</b> how to sell a concept." [...] Before Madonna's deal with Pepsi, pop stars in general were not given much artistic freedom by sponsors. However, Madonna {{made it a point}} to have the commercial be dictated by her. While she said that it was never her intention for Pepsi to get entangled in the controversy of the music video, Taraborrelli observed that Madonna stayed true to herself. Although the commercial intended to promote Pepsi the soft drink, she did not bother to hold even a can of the product, leading the author to comment that [...] "Madonna the pop star was going to do it her way, no matter what Madonna the businesswoman had agreed to do". She maintained all along that the Pepsi commercial and the music video were two different commodities and she was right to stand her ground. Taraborrelli noted that after [...] "Like a Prayer", the recruitment of pop stars and athletes to sell soft drinks became commonplace. However, none of them generated the level of excitement on par with Pepsi's failed deal with Madonna.|$|E

500|$|The {{official}} The Office website {{included three}} cut scenes from [...] "Golden Ticket". One 72-second clip includes Michael eavesdropping from the men's bathroom on Angela, Oscar, Kelly and Meredith, who discuss how unfair Michael is treating Dwight in making him take the fall over the failed golden ticket promotion. Kelly {{also makes the}} remark, [...] "I hope Dwight gets fired and they get a hot new guy to replace him," [...] to which Oscar replies, [...] "Seriously." [...] In another 52-second scene, Michael asks Dwight {{to go on a}} stroll, but Dwight suggests turning it into a [...] "power stroll", which he prepares Michael for by applying sunscreen to his face. And in a follow-up to the scene where workers discuss that Michael should be fired, a visibly angry and upset Michael confronts the office. When he says [...] "Can any of you imagine this office without me?" [...] everyone gleefully raises their hands, but Michael then asks them if they've thought about what kind of terrible person they could get to replace him; he then pointedly says that they could get <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>knows</b> they don't actually need three accountants (Oscar, Kevin, and Angela look visibly ashamed that Michael knew this going back to Season 2's Halloween episode but has never taken any action about it) or someone who doesn't approve of romantic relationships and would transfer one or both people having one to separate branches (Jim and Pam in turn get this message and look thoughtful), and tells the office that they should mind what they're saying about him [...] "when I'm hiding in the bathroom pretending to be pooping." ...|$|E
500|$|In [...] "Goodbye Stranger", Castiel {{has been}} {{completely}} brainwashed by Naomi and has killed thousands of copies of Dean ruthlessly. Castiel is sent to find the angel tablet and tortures and kills the demons also looking for it, drawing Sam and Dean's attention. Sam and Dean track down <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>knows</b> the location of one of Lucifer's Crypts where the angel tablet is and in ensuing scuffle, Sam ends up in trouble. Castiel saves Sam and captures one of the demons, claiming under Naomi's orders that he is searching {{for the second half}} of the demon tablet and that the demons are searching for a parchment that will allow them to translate it without a Prophet. Castiel tortures the demon who tells them where to find Meg, but kills her before she can reveal the truth to Sam and Dean. Castiel heads off alone and rescues Meg who explains what the demons really want. While Naomi initially wants her killed to prevent that, Castiel is able to make a case to keep her alive. The group then go to the warehouse where the crypt is and before heading inside with Dean, Castiel reveals that Sam is damaged by his trials on a level that even Castiel can't fix. Castiel and Dean locate the angel tablet and Castiel has to have Dean get it as it is warded against angels. However, Naomi orders Castiel to kill Dean and though he fights it, he has no control over his actions. As he is about to kill him, Dean manages to break through to Castiel's heart and he breaks free of Naomi's influence. He picks up the angel tablet which completely severs Naomi's connection to and control over him. Castiel heals Dean and explains what happened, but senses that he must now protect the tablet from everyone, even Dean. Castiel is later seen traveling on a bus to an unknown destination with the tablet. Despite losing the tablet, Naomi is somewhat satisfied as according to her, Castiel is doing what he is supposed to be doing. Naomi later comes to Dean. [...] In an attempt to gain his trust, presumably because she knows Castiel is one of his weak spots, she lies to Dean about Castiel and claims that he misinterpreted everything she has done and is still insane. Dean, of course, doesn't believe her. Despite this, Castiel is eventually captured by Naomi's forces, but the angel tablet is claimed by Crowley after one of Naomi's angels betrays their location, although this gives Castiel time to escape and reunite with the Winchesters after killing the angel guarding him.|$|E
500|$|The album {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, Aphrodite received an average score of 67 based on 21 reviews, indicating [...] "generally favorable reviews". Ben Norman from About.com appreciated Price's production, noting Aphrodite {{to be more}} consistent than X. Although the critic mentioned that the songs do not provide the [...] "immediate appeal", like those in X did, he labelled Aphrodite [...] "another knockout hit album" [...] from Minogue and the [...] "Do Not Miss album of 2010". Tim Sendra from AllMusic commended Minogue's choice of collaborators and producers, commenting that the album is the [...] "work of <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>knows</b> exactly what her skills are and who to hire to help showcase them to perfection". He also appreciated the album's cohesion and commercial prospect, and named it [...] "one of her best". The Billboard review of the album complimented Price's [...] "ability to create consistent sound without sacrificing each track's individuality", and termed Aphrodite a [...] "journey cohesive, fun and fitting for a goddess". Ian Wade from BBC Music gave the album an extremely positive review and {{found it to be}} an [...] "astonishing return to form" [...] for Minogue. Wade commended her for returning to her roots and becoming the [...] "Kylie of Fever and Light Years"; he concluded the review by calling Aphrodite an [...] "all-killer, flags-aloft amazing triumph" [...] and that [...] "not liking this (album) would be like not being keen on breathing". Nick Levine from Digital Spy felt that it was her best album since Fever and admitted that while Aphrodite isn't [...] "deep", it [...] "sure ain't dumb either", opining that it is meant to be heard for relaxation and enjoyment. Mikael Wood praised the tracks' danceability and concluded that [...] "The diminutive Australian diva is still delivering disco thunder from Down Under". Priya Elan from NME felt that Price was the [...] "perfect choice of musical partner" [...] and complimented him for producing Minogue's [...] "most unified work in ages". Christel Loar from PopMatters found the album similar to Light Years and Fever and commended the production, opining that while [...] "dance pop with this much gloss and unabashed glee is relegated to the realms of guilty pleasure", Aphrodite is [...] "that rare representation of perfect production that is just pleasure, pure and simple". Rob Sheffield from Rolling Stone labelled the album Minogue's [...] "finest work since 1997's underrated Impossible Princess". Neil McCormick from The Daily Telegraph complimented Price for enlisting a [...] "top notch" [...] team of collaborators and termed Aphrodite a [...] "mainstream pop blast". Barry Walters from Spin commended Minogue for returning to her original style of music, saying [...] "Finally even the suits realize that no one wants ersatz hip-hop or Americanized AOR from Australia's ultimate pop tart".|$|E
