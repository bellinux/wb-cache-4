It has been widely accepted that the analysis on structural and seepage stability plays a very important role, and {{it is necessary to}} take into account while designing the earth-rock dam. In performing the analysis of structural and seepage stability, many remarkable methods are available at current stage. However, there are still some important issues remaining unsolved, including: (1) Finite element methods (FEMs) is a means of solutions to analysis seepage process, but it is often a difficult task to determine the so-called <b>seepage</b> <b>coefficient,</b> because the common-used water injection test is limited in the practical work due to the high cost and complex procedure. (2) It has long been discussed that the key parameters for structural stability analysis show a significant spatial and temporal variations. It may be partly explained by the inhomogeneous dam-filling during construction work and the developing seepage process. The consequence is that one constant value of the parameter cannot represent the above variations. In this context, we solve the above issues and introduce the solution with a practical earth-rock dam project. For determining the <b>seepage</b> <b>coefficient,</b> the data from the piezo metric tube is used to calculate the potential value, based on which the <b>seepage</b> <b>coefficient</b> can be back-analysed. Then the seepage field, as well as the seepage stability are numerically analysed using the FEM-based SEEP/W program. As to the structural safety, we take into account the spatial and temporal variations of the key parameters, and incorporate the Monte-Carlo simulation method into the commonly used M-P method to calculate the frequency distribution of the obtained structural safety factor. In this way, the structural and seepage safety can be well analysed. This study is also beneficial to provide a mature method and a theoretical insight into the earth-rock dam design. The earth-rock dam of Xiquanyan Reservoir near Harbin city in China is also selected as case study to illustrate the described method...|$|E

But the void clogging lessens its durable function. So in this paper appropriate clogging agent was choose, and <b>seepage</b> <b>coefficients</b> were tested by using asphalt mixture pavement surface permeameter to simulation multi-cycle drainage clogging test. The influence of asphalt mixture design parameter such as the porosity, the maximum sizes of the aggregate, gradation and asphalt on the drainage and counter-clogging ability of porous asphalts was researched. The tests indicated that the porosity has an obvious influence on both porous asphalts’ permeable ability and counter-clogging ability. Comparing the specimen of 21 % void to the ones of 16 % void, the drain ability is improved 49. 8 %, the counter-clogging ability is improved 55. 0 %. The maximum sizes of the aggregate has an obvious influence on porous asphalts’ counter-clogging ability, but no an obvious influence on the drain ability. Comparing the specimen of 16 mm to the 13 mm, the counterclogging ability is proved 48 %. PAC with the coarser graduation has a better performance on drain and counter-clogging ability.

In this study, the effect of material deformation due to external loads (consolidation) and variation of head in the consolidation process are considered. For the first case, formulation of kx and ky can be defined by a second order binominal equation {{in order to take}} into account the material changes due to volume changes. For the second case, kx and ky can be defined as a function of unknown total head. The solution of the resulting non-linear differential equation is found using the Least Square Finite Element formulation. In order to increase the accuracy of the solution, eight nodal (isoperimetric) elements were obtained. This method was used satisfactorily to solve several seepage problems and to examine the accuracy and convergence of the results. The effect of a variable coefficient of permeability may not be significant on small dams, but as the height of the dam increases, the effect becomes more considerable.

The variations of <b>seepage</b> velocity, permeability <b>coefficient,</b> critical sample height, and non-Darcy flow factor for samples against slenderness ratios were investigated. A servo-controlled flow testing system that {{was developed by the}} authors was adopted to conduct the flow test. Cylindrical bimsoil samples (50 mm diameter and various heights) with staggered rock block percentages (RBPs) (30, 40, 50, and 60 %, by mass) were prepared by compaction tests to roughly insure the same porosity of the soil matrix. The testing results show that flow the distance has a strong influence on the flow characteristics of bimsoil, and the relationship between the permeability coefficient and slenderness ratio is proposed. In addition, the critical sample height to eliminate the slenderness effect was determined, and the relationship between the critical sample height and RBP was established. Moreover, the responses of non-Darcy flow were studied by using an index of non-Darcy βfactor, which reveals the internal mechanism of the effect of flow distance on groundwater flow characteristics.

The pore structure characteristics of coal rock mass in low permeability coal seam were analyzed quantitatively using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) through the methods of statistics and digital image analysis. Based on the pore structure parameters and the distribution function of the coal rock mass, a three-dimensional porous cylinder model with different porosity was reconstructed by FLAC 3 D. The numerical simulation study of reconstructed pore model shows that (1) the porosity and the compressive strength have obvious nonlinear relation and satisfy the negative exponential relation; (2) the porosity significantly affects the stress distribution; {{with the increase of}} micro porosity, the stress distribution becomes nonuniform; (3) the compressive failures of different models are mainly shear failures, and the shape of fracture section is related to porosity; (4) the variation of <b>seepage</b> <b>coefficient</b> of the pore reconstruction model is consistent with the development of micro cracks.

40|$|Abstract: The use of {{concrete}} for hydraulic structures has special requirements {{for water and}} its penetration through the concrete, {{and the effect of}} different aggressive agents on the concrete and its components. The requirements are much higher on permeability and durability than in the case of mechanical properties. While in the case of mechanical effects, stress concentrations are greater in region of higher quality concretes (rigidity and strength), the water flow line follow the weaker planes of increased permeability. This paper reviews typical values of design <b>seepage</b> <b>coefficient</b> from literature and also uses the experimental results of a laboratory study done for clay-cement concrete material. The clay-cement concrete studied was designed to be a low-strength material and its properties fall between those of soil and concrete. The material may be used as anti-seepage material in the foundation and diaphragm wall in earth dams, and canal lining in channel constructions. The three main design criteria considered for anti-seepage requirements, i. e. permeability, deformity, and long-term performance are used in the dam analysis with emphasis on water permeability. Water flow effect in hypothetical earth dam cases were assessed using a finite element-based software program to determine the influence of the design water permeability of cut-off wall based on the seepage regime that develops {{as a result of the}} barrier construction. It was found that construction of an anti-seepage barrier is effective in reducing the hydraulic gradient, even if the permeability coefficient of the barrier is several orders of magnitude high. Results also indicate that clay-cement concrete anti-seepage effect potentially gives high performance. This study may contribute a better understanding of the fluid flow characteristics in dams having a cut-off wall for improved practices and anti-seepage materials...|$|E

However, condition in the field expressed that dig situated under sea-water, therefore, if soil layer in the represented area is such of high permeability, sea water will seep and the penstock will be drained. The most effective method to prevent this is by grouting method. The purpose {{of this research is}} to know well the influence of grouting related to sea-water seepage seen by change of lugeon unit value, <b>coefficient</b> permeability, and <b>seepage</b> rate before and after grouting, and also its effectiveness after grouting. Methodologies have to do is descriptively and analysis.

After grouting, lugeon unit value (LU) is showing a smaller number than before grouting is performed, it is less than 3 (LU< 3) which means that execution of grouting can lessen ability of soil to conduct water at lugeon unit less than 3 (LU< 3). The coefficient permeability value after grouting is showing a smaller number than before grouting, which means soil condition to be impermeable progressively. Seepage rate value after grouting is showing a smaller than before grouting, which means sea water seepage decreases after grouting. Effectiveness of grouting in average is 66, 37...|$|R
40|$|The Savannah River Site (SRS) conducts {{performance}} assessment (PA) calculations {{to determine}} the appropriate amount of low-level radiological waste that can be safely disposed on site. Parameters are included in these calculations that account for {{the interaction between the}} immobile solid phase and the mobile aqueous phase. These parameters are either the distribution coefficient (K{sub d} value) or the apparent solubility value (K{sub sp}). These parameters are readily found in the literature and are used throughout the DOE complex. One shortcoming of K{sub d} values is that they are only applicable to a given set of solid and aqueous phase conditions. Therefore, a given radionuclide may have several K{sub d} values as it moves between formations and comes into contact with different solids and different aqueous phases. It is expected that the K{sub d} construct will be appropriate to use for a majority of the PA and for a majority of the radionuclides. However, semi-mechanistic models would be more representative in isolated cases where the chemistry is especially transitory or the radionuclide chemistry is especially complex, bringing to bear multiple species of varying sorption tendencies to the sediment. Semi-mechanistic models explicitly accommodate the dependency of K{sub d} values, or other sorption parameters, on contaminant concentration, competing ion concentrations, pH-dependent surface charge on the adsorbent, and solute species distribution. Incorporating semi-mechanistic concepts into geochemical models is desirable to make the models more robust and technically defensible. Furthermore, these alternative models could be used to augment or validate a Kd?based DOE Order 435. 1 Performance Assessment. The objectives of this study were to: 1) develop a quantitative thermodynamically-based model for neptunium sorption to SRS sediments, and 2) determine a sorption constant from an SRS 11 -year lysimeter study. The modeling studies were conducted with existing data sets. The first data set used laboratory generated Np sorption data as a function of concentration (three orders of magnitude) and as a function of pH (four orders of magnitude of proton concentration). In this modeling exercise, a very simple solution was identified by assuming that all sorption occurred only to the iron oxides in the sediment and that all the added NpO{sub 4 }{sup -} remained in the oxidized state and was not reduced to the Np(IV) state (as occurs rapidly with Pu(V)). With rather limited input data, very good agreement between experimental and modeling results was observed. This modeling approach would be easy to add to the PA with little additional data requirements. This model would be useful in a system where pH is expected to change greatly, such as directly beneath a grout or concrete structure. The second model discussed in the report was to derive strontium K{sub d} values from data collected in an 11 -year-old field transport study. In this controlled lysimeter study, a sensitivity analysis was conducted of hydrological and chemical processes that influence contaminant transport, including diffusion <b>coefficients,</b> <b>seepage</b> velocity, and K{sub d} value. The best overall K{sub d} derived from the model fit to the data was 32 L kg{sup - 1 }, which was the same value that was previously measured in traditional laboratory batch sorption studies. This was an unexpected result given the differences in experimental conditions between the batch test and the lysimeter flow through test, in particular the differences between strontium adsorption and desorption processes occurring in the latter test and not in the former. There were some trends in the lysimeter strontium data that were not predicted by the K{sub d} model, which suggest that other geochemical processes are likely also controlling strontium transport. Strontium release and cation exchange are being evaluated. These results suggest that future modeling efforts (e. g., PAs) could be improved by employing a more robust semi-empirical modeling approach to transient or complex conditions...|$|R
