40|$|Freeze-drying is a {{relatively}} expensive process requiring long processing time, and hence {{one of the key}} objectives during freeze-drying process development is to minimize the primary drying time, which is the longest of the three steps in freeze-drying. However, increasing the shelf temperature into secondary drying before all of the ice is removed from the product will likely cause collapse or eutectic melt. Thus, from product quality as well as process economics standpoint, it is very critical to detect the end of primary drying. Experiments were conducted with 5 % mannitol and 5 % sucrose as model systems. The apparent end point of primary drying was determined by comparative pressure measurement (i. e., Pirani vs. MKS Baratron), dew point, Lyotrack (gas plasma spectroscopy), water concentration from tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy, condenser pressure, pressure rise test (manometric temperature measurement or variations of this method), and product thermocouples. Vials were pulled out from the drying chamber using a <b>sample</b> <b>thief</b> during late primary and early secondary drying to determine percent residual moisture either gravimetrically or by Karl Fischer, and the cake structure was determined visually for melt-back, collapse, and retention of cake structure at the apparent end point of primary drying (i. e., onset, midpoint, and offset). By far, the Pirani is the best choice of the methods tested for evaluation of the end point of primary drying. Also, it is a batch technique, which is cheap, steam sterilizable, and easy to install without requiring any modification to the existing dryer...|$|E
50|$|Thief hatch, {{also known}} as a gauge hatch, is a term given to a close-able {{aperture}} on a tank or vessel used in the oil and gas industry. These hatches are placed in atmospheric or low pressure tanks in order to allow for level or sample measurements and to provide vacuum relief to the vessel. Thief hatches are also used in gauge tanks and in transport vehicles where they must be opened to the atmosphere to take measurements and samples. Flash gas is readily leaked whenever these hatches are opened and therefore they can pose a problem in terms of emissions. There have also been reports of fatalities caused by manual tank gauging and <b>sampling</b> via <b>thief</b> hatches.|$|R
40|$|Background: Pharmaceutical {{manufacturing}} {{is moving}} towards real-time {{release of the}} products. This objective can only be achieved by clearly understanding the process and by implementing suitable technologies for manufacturing and for process control. Near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy is one technology that has attracted lot of attention from the pharmaceutical industry since it can analyze bulk solids without any pretreatment, therefore reducing or eliminating wet chemistry analysis. NIR spectroscopy is {{a powerful tool for}} the monitoring unit operations were bulk material is involved i. e. blending of powders. Blending of powders is a complex and poorly understood unit operation. In the pharmaceutical industry blending has been performed batchwise and controlled by <b>thief</b> <b>sampling.</b> <b>Thief</b> <b>sampling</b> is an invasive process which is tedious and tends to introduce bias; therefore an alternative sampling method was highly needed. Here is where NIR found a perfect match with blend uniformity monitoring, thus NIR implementation offers several advantages: <b>thief</b> <b>sampling</b> is avoided, the process is continuously monitored, detection of blend-end point, and fast identification of process deviations. NIR spectral data need to be correlated with the parameter of interest (physical or chemical). These computations are done by multivariate data analysis (MVDA). MVDA and NIR are a powerful combination for in-process control and their use has been promoted by the health authorities through the Process Analytical technology (PAT) initiative by the FDA. Purpose: This thesis is focused on the study of powder blending, which is an essential unit operation for the manufacture of solid dosage forms. The aim was to develop two quantitative methods for the monitoring of the active ingredient concentration. One method was developed for blend uniformity monitoring of a batch mixing process, and a second method for a continuous mixing process. This study also tackles the relevance of the physical presentation of the powder on the final blend quality, by studying the influence of the particle size and the effect of the previous manufacturing steps on the NIR spectral data. Methods: Particle size was studied by NIR in diffuse reflectance mode, using Kubelka-Munk function and the transformation of reflectance of absorbance values, in order to focus the analysis on the physical properties. Furthermore, an off-line NIR model was developed for the quantification of the mean particle size. Segregation tendencies due to particle size incompatibilities were studied. Blend uniformity monitoring of a batch pharmaceutical mixing was achieved through a NIR off- line calibration method, which was used for the in-line drug quantification of a production scale mixing process. NIR in diffuse reflectance mode was used in the study of a continuous blending system. The effect of the process parameters, i. e. flow rate and stirring rate, was analyzed. Moreover, a NIR method for the in-line drug quantification was developed. NIR was implemented in a powder stream, in which the mass of powder measured by NIR was estimated. Results and discussion: Regarding particle size, incompatibilities due to different particle size ranges between the formulation ingredients lead to severe segregation. Particle size and cohesion determined the quality of the powder blend; slight cohesion and broader particle size distribution improved the robustness of the final blend. NIR showed high sensitivity to particle size variations, thus it was possible to develop a quantitative model for the mean particle size determination with a prediction error of 16 micrometers. Concerning batch mixing, an off-line calibration was generated for the quantification of two active ingredients contained in the formulation. The prediction errors varied from 0. 4 to 2. 3...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{standard}} operating procedure (SOP) is to provide technical guidance {{for the implementation of}} sampling protocols for tanks and other confined spaces from outside the vessel. These are standard (i. e., typically applicable) operating procedures which may be varied or changed as required, dependent on site conditions, equipment limitations or limitations imposed by the procedure or other procedure limitations. In all instances, the ultimate procedures employed should be documented and associated with the final report. Mention of trade names or commercial products does not constitute U. S. EPA endorsement or recommendation for use. 2. 0 METHOD SUMMARY The safe collection of a representative sample should be the criteria for selecting sample locations. A representative sample can be collected using techniques or equipment that are designed for obtaining liquids or sludges from various depths. The structure and characteristics of storage tanks present problems with collection of samples from more than one location; therefore, the selection of sampling devices is an important consideration. Depending on the type of vessel and characteristics of the material to be sampled, one can choose a bacon bomb sampler, sludge judge, subsurface grab <b>sampler,</b> glass <b>thief,</b> bailer or Composite Liquid Waste Sampler (COLIWASA) to collect the sample. A sludge judge, bacon bomb or COLIWASA can be used to determine if the tank contents are stratified. Various other custom-made samplers may be used depending on the specific application. All sample locations should be surveyed for air quality prior to sampling. At no time should sampling continue with an LEL reading greater than 25 %...|$|R
50|$|Before a PSD can be determined, it {{is vital}} that a {{representative}} sample is obtained. In the case where the material to be analysed is flowing, the sample must be withdrawn from the stream {{in such a way that}} the sample has the same proportions of particle sizes as the stream. The best way to do this is to take many samples of the whole stream over a period, instead of taking a portion of the stream for the whole time.p. 6 In the case where the material is in a heap, scoop or <b>thief</b> <b>sampling</b> needs to be done, which is inaccurate: the sample should ideally have been taken while the powder was flowing towards the heap.p. 10 After sampling, the sample volume typically needs to be reduced. The material to be analysed must be carefully blended, and the sample withdrawn using techniques that avoid size segregation, for example using a rotary dividerp. 5. Particular attention must be paid to avoidance of loss of fines during manipulation of the sample.|$|R
40|$|In-situ {{measurements}} of the specific conductance and temperature of ground water in the Snake River Plain aquifer were collected in observation well USGS- 59 near the Idaho Chemical Processing Plant at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory. These parameters were monitored at various depths in the aquifer from October 1994 to August 1995. The specific conductance of ground water in well USGS- 59, as measured in the borehole, ranged from about 450 to 900 {micro}S/cm at standard temperature (25 C). The pumping cycle of the production wells at the Idaho Chemical Processing Plant causes changes in borehole circulation patterns, {{and as a result}} the specific conductance of ground water at some depths in the well varies by up to 50 % over a period of about 14 hours. However, these variations were not observed at all depths, or during each pumping cycle. The temperature of ground water in the well was typically between 12. 8 and 13. 8 C. The results {{of this study indicate that}} temporal variations in specific conductance of the ground water at this location are caused by an external stress on the aquifer [...] pumping of a production well approximately 4, 000 feet away. These variations are believed to result from vertical stratification of water quality in the aquifer and a subsequent change in intrawell flow related to pumping. When sampling techniques that do not induce a stress on the aquifer (i. e., <b>thief</b> <b>sampling)</b> are used, knowledge of external stresses on the system at the time of sampling may aid in the interpretation of geochemical data...|$|R
40|$|A joint {{research}} effort was {{undertaken by the}} Water Resources Research Center and the Honolulu Board of Water Supply to investigate the physical and chemical characteristics of irrigation return water in Pearl Harbor-Waipahu, Oahu, which is an area used for tropical agriculture. The project was started in 1967 and was expanded in 1968 to include Kahuku, Oahu and Central and West Maui. Well samples and profile samples were obtained with a <b>thief</b> <b>sampler</b> in the Pearl Harbor-Waipahu area and composite samples were obtained mainly from pumping wells in other areas. In addition, both spring and stream waters in the Pearl Harbor-Waipahu area were analyzed {{for a number of}} inorganic constituents including bicarbonate, calcium, magnesium, phosphate, silica, boron, chloride, nitrate, sodium, potassium, bromide, fluoride, iodine, sulfate, and total hardness. Stream waters in the main study area were observed to contain appreciable quantities of nitrate, phosphate, bromide, bicarbonate, and fluoride. Similar trends were observed with the spring samples including increases of calcium, magnesium, silica, sulfate, and nitrate. Waters from Waiau and Waiawa Springs were found to be closer to sea water in cation composition than that from Kalauao Springs. Well waters from the main study area were evaluated according to Visher and Mink's index constituents, silica, sulfate, and nitrate, and other significant ionic compositions. Well T- 241 generally showed higher content of index ions compared to basal water indicating the possibility of its penetrating a caprock aquifer. The waters of T- 75 gave evidence of its being in the transition zone between sea water and basal water. T- 52 was thought to be in "virgin" basal water. Wells T- 202 - 2 C and T- 118 are in pumping well fields and show evidence of some freshening due to the draft for municipal use. Well T- 191 - 3 A and T- 191 - 3 B yielded an erratic pattern that was difficult to analyze, {{complicated by the fact that}} the two shafts are about 100 ft apart. General analysis of major constituents evidenced a cyclical trend in concentration, either related to seasonal rainfall and irrigation practices, or both.
