From this point on, however, he created instead individual pictures that combined in different ways elements such as flowers, animals, ornaments, but also comics and advertisements from the 1950s. Again and again script appeared as {{an element of the}} pictures. Keining used several slides projected one after another onto the canvas for the composition of the pictures. Some portions of the pictures are characterized by sprayed paint, others by brushed <b>paint.</b> The overlay <b>of</b> the portions leads to the impression of two or more visual levels in the pictures; e.g., the sharp silhouette <b>of</b> <b>painted</b> script stands out in front of a sprayed blurred ornament in the background. As the <b>sprayed</b> <b>application</b> <b>of</b> <b>paint</b> already blurs the contours more or less, the overlay of portions of the pictures increases the blur. This approach elicits great ambiguity undermining definitive interpretations. [...] The art historian Daniel Spanke about Keinings works: “But this diversity of possibilities of paintings, which Keining has worked for during the years, {{is by no means a}} juxtaposition of arbitrary, seemingly incompatible styles, but is based on a development that went through different styles <b>of</b> <b>painting</b> and pictures, in order to trace the essence of the picture. Thereby the interest of the observer is directed to an important fundamental question of human culture: How is the world transformed to a picture and what happens during this transformation.”2 ...|$|R

Both the cultivars viz Selection No- 14 and Riana responded favourably to retardant treatments. A height reduction of 31. 5 per cent in the first flush was recorded with Alar (1500 ppm) spray whereas a combination drench and <b>spray</b> <b>application</b> <b>of</b> Alar (1500 ppm) resulted in 28 per cent height reduction in the second flush.

Significant reduction in days to bud formation was recorded with PP 333 (50 ppm) drench and spray in the first flush. A marked positive effect of PP 333 (50 ppm) drench and spray along with Alar (1500 ppm) drench and spray was observed on number of cymes per inflorescence in the first flush whereas in the second flush, Cycocel (1500 ppm) drench and spray resulted in maximum number of cymes per inflorescence.

Phosphite applied as trunk injection resulted in relatively higher detection of phosphonic acid levels in the plant tissues compared to other methods <b>of</b> <b>application,</b> and the phytotoxic effect was also more severe than foliar <b>spray</b> <b>application.</b> Foliar and trunk <b>spray</b> <b>application</b> <b>of</b> phosphite or soil drench with metalaxyl-M resulted in consistent (R- 2 > 0. 98) rejuvenation of diseased trees over 3 years compared to untreated control trees that continued to decline (y = 1 + 0. 22 ln(x); R- 2 = 0. 96). Phytotoxicity of phosphite on macadamia leaves occurred at relatively lower rates than indicated for other tree crops.
