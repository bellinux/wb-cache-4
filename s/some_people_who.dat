5|$|Slowly {{stopping}} medications may {{be reasonable}} in <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> {{do not have}} a seizure for two to four years; however, around a third of people have a recurrence, most often during the first six months. Stopping is possible in about 70% of children and 60% of adults.|$|E
5|$|According to surveys, the {{addition}} to a prescribed SSRI is a common strategy when people {{do not respond to}} the SSRI, even though this is not an officially approved indication. The addition of bupropion to an SSRI (most commonly fluoxetine or sertraline) may result in an improvement in <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> have an incomplete response to the first-line antidepressant.|$|E

5|$|The {{short and}} unworthy reigns of Radu V’s successors only {{increased}} {{the crisis of}} Wallachia. Starting with Mircea the Shepherd (15451559), the first prince placed on the throne by the sultan, the crown became negotiable, according to the largest tribute offered. Even Michael the Brave who in time would turn against the Ottomans ascended the throne {{with the support of}} <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> had influence with the Sublime Porte, among them Sir Edward Barton, the English ambassador to Istanbul.|$|E
5|$|Vertebral artery {{dissection}} {{has also}} been reported in association with some forms of neck manipulation. There is significant controversy {{about the level of}} risk of stroke from neck manipulation. It may be that manipulation can cause dissection, or {{it may be that the}} dissection is already present in <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> seek manipulative treatment. At this time, conclusive evidence does not exist to support either a strong association between neck manipulation and stroke, or no association.|$|E
5|$|Turbinellus floccosus is {{poisonous}} to <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> eat it, but {{has been}} consumed without incident by others. Nausea, vomiting and diarrhea may occur, though are sometimes delayed by up to 8–14 hours. A tricarboxylic acid known as α-tetradecylcitric acid {{may be responsible for}} the extreme gastrointestinal symptoms. Laboratory experiments showed it increased tone of guinea pig smooth muscle of the small bowel (ileum), and that when given to rats, it led to mydriasis, skeletal muscle weakness, and central nervous system depression. Turbinellus floccosus contains more than double the amount of this acid than the related T. kauffmanii.|$|E

5|$|During {{a severe}} local {{recession}} in 1985 the 36-year-old hotel, still {{the second largest}} in Houston but by then in need of extensive refurbishing and refitting, was in effect donated to the Texas Medical Center. In March 1986 a protest rally was held by historic preservationists including McCarthy and the hotel opened its last annual St Patrick's Day party to the public. That evening, <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> {{had been at the}} opening night party in 1949 reportedly attended a semi-formal event in the hotel's Emerald room. A few employees had been with the hotel since its first year of operation. The building was demolished 1 June 1987 (McCarthy died 18 months later) and the land was paved over as a surface parking lot. The Institute of Biosciences and Technology, a component of the Texas A Health Science Center has since been built on the site and ironically, along with fountains and some landscaping on the northeast grounds, the hotel's multi-story parking garage was retained.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Longley, the Archbishop of Canterbury, {{married the}} couple on 10 March 1863 at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle. The choice of venue was criticised widely. As the {{ceremony}} took place outside London, the press complained that large public crowds {{would not be}} able to view the spectacle. Prospective guests thought it awkward to get to and, as the venue was small, <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> had expected invitations were disappointed. The Danes were dismayed because only Alexandra's closest relations were invited. The British court was still in mourning for Prince Albert, so ladies were restricted to wearing grey, lilac or mauve. As the couple left Windsor for their honeymoon at Osborne House on the Isle of Wight, they were cheered by the schoolboys of neighbouring Eton College, including Lord Randolph Churchill.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} Spears {{appearing}} bored in class at a Catholic high school. Her assistant Felicia Culotta {{played the role}} of Spears's teacher. When the bell rings, Spears runs out into the hall and begins a choreographed dance in the corridor. After this, Spears is outside, now adorned in an pink athletic outfit, and seen in a car. Along with a couple of other students, she performs a number of gymnastic moves before heading back inside. She is then sitting on the bleachers in the gymnasium watching a basketball game, and she dances in the gymnasium. Her love interest is revealed sitting close to her, played by her real-life cousin Chad. After this short segment, Spears begins her final dance routine and the video ends shortly afterwards, and the bell rings and Spears leaves the gymnasium, revealing that the whole thing had actually just been Spears's daydream. During the very beginning, Spears is seen with her sleeves down. <b>Some</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> see the music video may not recognize this, but when the bell rings, the sleeves of exactly the same gray-and-white shirt she is wearing are rolled up, even when she gets into singing.|$|E

25|$|The varicoceles {{might be}} noticed as soft lumps, usually above the {{testicle}} and {{mostly on the}} left side of the scrotum. Right-sided and bilateral varicoceles do also occur. <b>Some</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> have them feel pain or heaviness in their scrotum.

25|$|In {{recent decades}} {{it has become}} {{possible}} to reassign sex surgically. <b>Some</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> experience gender dysphoria seek such medical intervention to have their physiological sex match their gender identity; others retain the genitalia they were born with (see transsexual {{for some of the}} possible reasons) but adopt a gender role that is consistent with their gender identity.|$|E
25|$|Betanin is commercially used as {{a natural}} food dye. It can cause beeturia (red urine) and red feces in <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> are unable to break it down.
