5|$|Carancahua Bay is {{protected}} by the State of Texas and locally by the 300-member Carancahua Bay Protection Association. It is a nursery bay for shrimp, and is a habitat for shellfish including oysters. Finfish such as the redfish and black drum are commonly caught from the bay by recreational fishermen. Birds common to the bay include the wood ibis, roseate spoonbill, snowy egret, great-tailed grackle, Louisiana heron, willet, black-necked <b>stilt,</b> caracara and the black vulture.|$|E

5|$|A {{more recent}} {{tradition}} (started in 1987) is Dunster by Candlelight {{which takes place}} every year on the first Friday and Saturday in December when this remarkably preserved medieval village turns its back on the present and lights its streets with candles. To {{mark the beginning of}} the festival on Friday at 5 pm, there is the Lantern Lighting Procession that starts on the Steep and continues through the village until all the lanterns in the streets have been lit. The procession of children and their families is accompanied by colourful <b>stilt</b> walkers in costumes who put up the lanterns.|$|E
5|$|The city {{is divided}} into two {{distinctive}} geographic regions: the dry eastern side which includes majority of the urban area {{of the city and the}} western region which borders the Nilgiris, Anaimalai and Munnar ranges. Palghat Gap, a mountain pass which connects the neighbouring state of Kerala to Tamil Nadu, lies to the west of the city. Because of its location in the biodiversity hotspot of the Western Ghats, it is rich in fauna and flora. The Coimbatore urban wetlands harbours around 116 species of birds, of which 66 are resident, 17 are migratory and 33 are local migrants. The spot-billed pelican, painted stork, openbill stork, ibis, spot-billed duck, teal and black-winged <b>stilt</b> visit the Coimbatore wetlands on their migration. Apart from the species common to the plains, various threatened and endangered species such as Indian elephants, wild boars, leopards, Bengal tigers, gaurs, Nilgiri tahr, sloth bear and black-headed oriole are found in the region.|$|E
5|$|The high {{salinity}} {{in parts}} of the lake makes them uninhabitable for all but a few species, including brine shrimp, brine flies, and several forms of algae. The brine flies have an estimated population of over one hundred billion and serve as the main source of food for many of the birds which migrate to the lake. However, the fresh- and salt-water wetlands along the eastern and northern edges of the Great Salt Lake provide critical habitat for millions of migratory shorebirds and waterfowl in western North America. These marshes account for approximately 75% of the wetlands in Utah. Some of the birds that depend on these marshes include: Wilson's phalarope, red-necked phalarope, American avocet, black-necked <b>stilt,</b> marbled godwit, snowy plover, western sandpiper, long-billed dowitcher, tundra swan, American white pelican, white-faced ibis, California gull, eared grebe, peregrine falcon, bald eagle, plus large populations of various ducks and geese.|$|E

25|$|The black-necked <b>stilt</b> is {{distinguished}} from non-breeding vagrants of the Old World black-winged <b>stilt</b> {{by the white}} spot above the eye. Vagrants of the northern American form in turn {{is hard to tell}} apart from the resident Hawaiian <b>stilt,</b> in which only the eye-spot is markedly smaller. But though many <b>stilt</b> populations are long-distance migrants and during their movements can be found hundreds of miles offshore, actual trans-oceanic vagrants are nonetheless a rare occurrence.|$|E
25|$|It {{is often}} {{treated as a}} {{subspecies}} of the common or black-winged <b>stilt,</b> using the trinomial name Himantopus himantopus mexicanus. However, the AOS has always considered it a species in its own right, and the scientific name Himantopus mexicanus is often seen. Matters are more complicated though; sometimes all five distinct lineages of the Common <b>Stilt</b> are treated as different species. But the white-backed <b>stilt</b> from southern South America (H. melanurus when the species is recognized), parapatric and intergrading to some extent with its northern relative where their ranges meet, would warrant inclusion with the Black-necked <b>stilt</b> when this is separated specifically, becoming Himantopus mexicanus melanurus. Similarly, the Hawaiian <b>stilt,</b> H. m. knudseni, is likely {{to belong to the}} American species when this is considered separate; while some treat it as another distinct species, the AOS, BirdLife International and the IUCN do not.|$|E
25|$|Particularly the North American {{populations of}} the black-necked <b>stilt</b> have {{somewhat}} declined in the 20th century, mainly due to conversion of habitat for human use and pollution affecting both the birds directly {{as well as their}} food stocks. But altogether, the population is healthy and occurs over a large range. This <b>stilt</b> is therefore classified as a Species of Least Concern by the IUCN. The Hawaiian <b>stilt,</b> separated with the black-necked <b>stilt</b> in a distinct species by some (including the IUCN), is very rare however and numbers less than 2,000 individuals. Predation by the small Indian mongoose (Herpestes javanicus auropunctatus), introduced to hunt rats, is suspected to have contributed to its decline.|$|E
