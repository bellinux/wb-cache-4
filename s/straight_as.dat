5|$|Dollo's {{specimens}} {{allowed him}} to show that Owen's prehistoric pachyderms were not correct for Iguanodon. He instead modelled the skeletal mounts after the cassowary and wallaby, and put the spike {{that had been on}} the nose firmly on the thumb. He was not completely correct, but he also had the disadvantage of being faced with some of the first complete dinosaur remains. A problem that was later recognised was the bend he introduced into the tail. This organ was more or less <b>straight,</b> <b>as</b> shown by the skeletons he was excavating, and the presence of ossified tendons. In fact, to get the bend in the tail for a more wallaby or kangaroo-like posture, the tail would have had to be broken. With its correct, straight tail and back, the animal would have walked with its body held horizontal to the ground, arms in place to support the body if needed.|$|E
5|$|Porter ran Orme {{in a trial}} {{four days}} before the Eclipse Stakes at Sandown Park as preparation. He raced against his five-year-old {{half-brother}} Blue Green and the six-year-old Ormuz. Despite conceding weight to both of them, he won by the trial by two lengths from Ormuz. In the Eclipse he faced six rivals and started the 5/4 favourite, with Sussex Stakes winner Orvieto next in the betting at 11/4. During the race Orme was ridden {{in the middle of the}} field. As they turned into the finishing straight, Orme and Orvieto were close behind the two leaders; the two then took over the lead in the <b>straight.</b> <b>As</b> they neared the finish, Orvieto had a slight advantage, but as Barrett asked Orme for an effort, he responded and got in front to win by a neck from Orvieto, with St. Damien finishing only three quarters of a length behind Orvieto. The race was worth over £9000. Twelve days later Orme lined up as the 1/5 favourite for the Sussex Stakes. In the last few furlongs he battled with Watercress, and it was not until 50 yards from the finish that he came out on top, going on to win by a head from Watercress.|$|E
5|$|The safety {{cars were}} {{deployed}} {{to slow the}} race as marshals worked for twenty-two minutes to dry the spilled oil along the Mulsanne <b>Straight.</b> <b>As</b> the safety cars were recalled, Lotterer in the No. 7 Audi used slower traffic to pass both Porsche drivers {{in front of him}} and take over the race lead, just as Nico Hülkenberg moved to fourth place by passing the remaining Audi cars. In the LMP2 category the safety car had split the field up, leaving the TDS Racing and KCMG Oreca-Nissan cars forty seconds ahead of their class rivals. Richard Bradley for KCMG was able to fight with TDS Racing's Tristan Gommendy on the restart and eventually retake the class lead it had lost at the race start. Lotterer was later forced to give up the race lead as a puncture on one of the No. 7's tyres required an extra pit stop, allowing Hartley's No. 17 Porsche to the front of the race. Duval was caught on an approach to a slow zone (which was enforced to allow a marshal to retrieve debris at Indianapolis) by a group of slowed LMGTE cars and took avoiding action by steering right into the grass off track. The No. 8 Audi clipped the No. 51 AF Corse Ferrari's right-hand section and was thrown back sideways across the track, impacting the outside barriers head on heavily driving into Indianapolis corner and ripping the car's front bodywork off. Safety cars were required once again as the barriers needed lengthy repairs, while Duval was able to drive the damaged Audi back to the garage. Repairs took less than five minutes and the car resumed in eighth place.|$|E

25|$|For fast bowlers at {{the point}} of release the back of hand will be facing in the {{opposite}} direction of the batsmen facing the pending delivery. The front of the upright wrist and tips of the index and middle fingers all point to the target. For spin bowlers the wrist may well be at various angles at release point.

Jenson's teammate Barrichello struggled to take eleventh almost one second slower than Vettel. Although Webber crashed out with one hour remaining in the session he managed to sixth.|$|E

25|$|The Laws of the Twelve Tables, {{dated to}} about 450 BC, {{specified}} that a road shall be 8Roman feet (perhaps about 2.37 m) wide where straight and twice that width where curved. Actual practices varied from this standard. The Tables command Romans to build roads and give wayfarers {{the right to}} pass over private land where the road is in disrepair. Building roads that would not need frequent repair therefore became an ideological objective, as well as building them as <b>straight</b> <b>as</b> possible {{in order to build}} the narrowest roads possible, and thus save on material.|$|E
25|$|A flick shot is a straight-batted shot {{played on}} the leg side by {{flicking}} a full-length delivery using the wrists. It is often also called the clip off the legs. The shot is playing with the bat coming through <b>straight</b> <b>as</b> for the on drive, but the bat face is angled towards the leg side. It can be played both off the front foot or the back foot, either off the toes or from the hips. The shot is played between the mid on and square leg region. Typically played along the ground, the flick can also be played by lofting the ball over the infield.|$|E
25|$|The correct {{position}} for this discipline, {{as in all}} forms of riding, is a balanced seat. This is seen when a bystander can run an imaginary straight line that passes through the rider's ear, shoulder, hip, and heel. This means the rider's feet and legs must hang directly in balance so that the heel hits this line, with heels down. The rider should also be sitting as <b>straight</b> <b>as</b> possible, but with their hips under their body, sitting firmly on their seat bones, not sitting on one's crotch with an arched back. The rider should have their weight sunk into their seat and distributed through their legs. The rider's shoulders should be rolled back and their chin up {{to show that they}} are looking forward.|$|E

25|$|A proper lubricant, {{typically}} graphite powder, is essential. Wheel alignment {{is important}} both to minimize wheel {{contact with the}} axle head and body {{as well as to}} limit the contact between the wheels and guide rail as the car travels down the track. There are 32 friction causing surfaces on a pinewood derby car. These include the surfaces of all four wheels which touch either the axle, the body or the track and the surfaces of all four axles which touch the wheel. Neglecting to polish and lubricate any of these 32 surfaces will result in degraded performance. The center of mass of a typical car is low and slightly ahead of the rear axle, which helps the car track <b>straight</b> <b>as</b> well as providing a slight advantage due to the additional gravitational potential energy.|$|E
25|$|In 1987, Brooklands Museum Trust {{was formed}} with Sir Peter G Masefield as Chairman, {{and began to}} record, research, {{preserving}} and interpret all aspects the site's heritage.

25|$|The {{adults are}} black with a silvery-gray coat on the thorax and abdomen. They are 6 to 7mm long, with clear wings and {{yellowish}} calypters. The knob of the haltere is yellow while the stalk is brownish yellow. The dorsal abdomen has a dark median stripe {{that produces a}} series of triangular markings with the segmentally arranged transverse bands. The thorax of the adult has three longitudinal stripes. They are darker than F. canicularis. The tibia on the mesothoraic leg has a distinct process, and the coxae have two setae at the apex. The fourth vein on the wing of this species is <b>straight,</b> <b>as</b> compared to it being curved in the house fly. There is a great variance between the sexes of this species, and more {{is known about the}} male. For instance; their mid femur does not have blunt spines, the ventral tubercle of the mid tibia is indistinct, and the abdomen has no spots or stripes and is short and broad.|$|E
25|$|He didn't {{run again}} until September, when he contested the Champagne Stakes at Doncaster and started as the odds-on favourite. Fordham held {{him up at}} the rear of the field, but had to start riding him before they had turned into the {{finishing}} <b>straight.</b> <b>As</b> the six-runner field entered the final furlong Lord Clifden had almost caught leaders Armagnac and Early Purl. He then overtook them inside the last furlong and won by half a length from Armagnac, with Early Purl a further three lengths back in third place. Two days later Lord Clifden raced in a sweepstakes of £10 each with £100 added. He got off to a bad start, losing several lengths to the rest of the field as Volturno went into the lead. Lord Clifden closed up on the field as they turned into the straight. At the one-furlong pole Fordham asked him for an effort and stride by stride he caught Bohemia, who was then leading, and just overtook him at the line to win by a head. Queen Bertha finished third, three lengths behind the front two.|$|E
25|$|MD 182 {{begins at}} an acute {{intersection}} with MD 97 (Georgia Avenue) in Glenmont. The highway heads north as Layhill Road, a six-lane divided highway that passes the Glenmont {{station at the}} eastern terminus of the Washington Metro's Red Line. MD 182 reduces to four lanes north of Glenallen Avenue. The highway crosses Bel Pre Creek and intersects Bel Pre Road and Bonifant Road at the hamlet of Layhill; Bonifant Road leads to the National Capital Trolley Museum. North of Layhill, MD 182 meets MD 200 (Intercounty Connector) at a diamond interchange and reduces to two lanes just south of its bridge across Buckhorn Branch of the Northwest Branch Anacostia River, which parallels the highway to the east. The highway temporarily expands to a four-lane divided highway at its intersection with Norbeck Road, which heads west as MD 28. MD 182 continues to the hamlet of Norwood, where the highway intersects Norwood Road. The road continues <b>straight</b> <b>as</b> Ednor Road and MD 182 turns north onto Norwood Road. North of the Sandy Spring Friends School, Norwood Road veers north as a county highway toward Sandy Spring. MD 182 continues along Dr. Bird Road, which carries the state highway northwest to its northern terminus at MD 108 (Olney Sandy Spring Road) opposite the Olney Theatre Center for the Arts on {{the eastern edge of}} Olney.|$|E
