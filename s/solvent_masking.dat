40|$|This work {{outlines}} {{the development of}} a gas chromatographic mass spectrometric (GCMS) method for the analysis of hydrocarbon residues such as those encountered in the examination of fire debris. The work compares favourably against an existing ASTM E- 1618 - 06 method for ignitable liquid analysis currently used {{for the development of the}} National Centre for Forensic Science (NCFS) ignitable liquid database. A test mixture comprising fourteen hydrocarbons as recommended by the ASTM- 1618 - 06 method was used to evaluate and validate the separation conditions together with a matrix matched ignitable liquid mixture diluted to 2 mu L mL(- 1) in dichloromethane. Optimised conditions were as follows: injection volume of 1 mu L with split ratio 50 to 1 at inlet temperature 280 degrees C, carrier gas flow rate was set as 1. 0 mL min(- 1), the column temperature was maintained at 40 degrees C for 3 minutes, then increased at a rate of 12. 5 degrees C min(- 1) to 290 degrees C, and held for 4 minutes. Undiluted ignitable liquid samples (50 % gasoline : diesel) were also analysed with a high split ratio (300 : 1) and low injection volume (0. 2 mu L) to avoid column overloading and to eliminate any difficulties associated with <b>solvent</b> <b>masking.</b> This method provided improved separation and sensitivity compared to the ASTM method. Excellent precision both intra-day and inter-day (< 3 % RSD for peak area) was also obtained. The stability of ignitable liquid storage was also investigated over a two week period for various types of vials and septa...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{estimation}} of the bulk-solvent contribution to the diffraction of a macromolecular crystal makes use of a <b>solvent</b> <b>mask</b> which delimits the bulk-solvent regions in the crystal. It is shown that the way this mask is usually defined in CNS contains a bias {{which can lead to}} absurd results in the case of very large structures, where the calculations can only be made on relatively coarse grids. A modified procedure is described and applied to 70 S ribosome data at 5. 5 A resolution. The B factor affecting the bulk solvent is also discussed. Even in this case of very high and widely variable atomic B factors, it seems sufficient to consider a constant and isotropic B factor for the bulk solvent. This is initially set to the average value of the atomic B factor, but can be refined...|$|R
40|$|The bulk solvent plays a {{key role}} in the direct phasing at low resolution. The connectivity-based phasing method has been tested for the crystal of the tRNAAsp-aspartyl-tRNA {{synthetase}} complex. The neutron diffraction data have been measured for different <b>solvent</b> contrast <b>masking</b> different components of the crystal. The obtained low resolution images are perfectly correlated with the solvent level. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{content of}} copper {{in the soil}} of two {{allotment}} gardens in Lodz and a forest area near Lodz were determined. Copper was determined by an adapted extraction- spectrophotometric method {{in the form of}} a complex with sodium(I) diethyldithiocarbamate. The influence of the extraction <b>solvent,</b> a <b>masking</b> agent and interfering elements (Fe(III) and Cr(IH)) on determination of copper by this method was examined. Possibilities of elimination of the extraction stage by using a protective colloid for spectrophotometric determination of copper in soil were investigated...|$|R
30|$|The basic {{chemistry}} of the solder masks was an epoxy acrylate dual cure system (bisphenol-A based epoxy and methyl methacrylate) with typical photoimageable solder mask formulations, including photoinitiators, thermal curing agents, silica-filler, pigment and several organic <b>solvents.</b> Solder <b>mask</b> type A was cured with an anhydride and solder mask type B was cured with an amine. Additionally, both solder mask formulations contained additives, like PDMS-based anti-foaming and wetting agents, which {{are introduced to}} impact specific properties of the solder masks. Anti-foaming agents contribute to the solder mask performance in a curtain coating application process [1].|$|R

Employees used a negative pressure filtering respirators with a full face mask; concentration of <b>solvents</b> under the <b>mask</b> was measured using a diffusion monitors. The author said that the high humidity of expired air were not interfere with the measurements.|$|R
40|$|AbstractAn attempt {{has been}} made to {{fabricate}} both fuel and air electrodes for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) by utilizing the green-tape laser sintering (GTLS) method. We prepared two types of green pastes with a mixture of samarium strontium cobaltite (SSC) powders for the cathode, NiO/SDC (sub-micrometer-sized samarium-doped ceria) cermet powders for the anode, polystyrene particles as sacrifice material, polymer binder and <b>solvent.</b> The <b>mask</b> printing method was formed an electrode film on the SDC substrate. The printed paste was dried at 433 K for 60 min in an electric furnace, before a pulsed Nd:YAG laser was irradiated in a row on the pattered sample. The GTLS parameters were set at 1. 06 Î¼m in wavelength, 80 Hz in pulse frequency, 0. 6 - 3. 0 ms in pulse width, 0. 1 - 0. 5 mJ in pulse energy, about 0. 4 mm in diameter of beam spot, and 3. 3 - 16. 7 mm/s in scan speed. A porosity of 22 % in the SSC film has been attained although porous microstructures are influenced by pulse energy, pulse width, the defocus amount of laser beam, and substrate temperature during irradiation. The samarium-based electrode structure is less porous than conventional YSZ-based one. Adhesion between the electrolyte and the electrodes was insufficient...|$|R
30|$|We {{illustrated}} {{a simple}} and inexpensive nanofabrication method that can produce oxide or pure graphitic nanofeatures by means of SPL, employing almost any commercial AFM, avoiding subtractive fabrication methods including electron beam lithography and focused ion beam. Secondly, choosing a proper organic precursor, we show that the technique is accessible to most AFM users with no need of dedicated setups in ambient environment. The reaction leading to carbon deposition {{is likely to happen}} in both polarities, but when the tip is biased negatively, the competing oxidation <b>masks</b> <b>solvent</b> decomposition. The method, combined with dry etching allows the fast prototyping of Si masters ideal for replica molding/nanoimprinting. As a possible prototype, we realized several Si masters with satisfactory aspect ratio and we showed how to hybridize microlithography with SPL, connecting Al micropatterns with nanopatterns.|$|R
