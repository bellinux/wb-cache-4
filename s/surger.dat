It sends ultrasonic waves through a Guinness-filled pint glass to recreate the beer's [...] "surge and settle" [...] effect. The device {{works in conjunction with}} special cans of surger-ready Guinness. Guinness tried out a primitive version of this system in 1977 in New York. The idea was abandoned until 2003, when it began testing the <b>surger</b> in Japanese bars, most of which are too small to accommodate traditional keg-and-tap systems. Since then, the <b>surger</b> has been introduced to bars in Paris. Surgers are also in use in Australia, Singapore and Greece. The <b>surger</b> for the US market was announced on 14 November 2007; plans were to make the unit available to bars only.|$|E

5000|$|On August 13, 1878, {{more than}} 60 warriors rode into the Malheur Indian Agency and were arrested after they {{surrendered}} to American troops. Among the warriors were Cheegibah (Leggins), son of Natchez (Boy) and grandson of Chief Winnemucca the Younger; Otiz (Left Hand), grandson of Owitze (Twisted Hand) and Ochiho (Red Willow), son of Chochoco (Has No Horse). [...] Under intense interrogation, Leggins identified the ranking war chiefs: Oytes (Left Hand), Bannock Joe Pohave (Racehorse), Captain Bearskin (Honalelo (Little Bearskin Dick)), Big John Ponce (Three Coyotes), Eagle Eye Wahweveh (Black Eagle), Charley Chongyo (Pipe), D.E. Johnson, Beads, and <b>Surger</b> Wahi (Fox). [...] Most {{of the leaders}} whom Leggins named were shot in 1878. [...] Lieutenant Colonel James Forsyth reported that his troops had killed Wahweveh (Black Eagle) on July 31, 1878; however, in spring 1879 Wahweveh and medicine chief Tamanmo (Black Spirit), with a few Snake dog soldiers, raided a mining camp on the Oregon-Idaho border and killed several Chinese laborers.

40|$|Abstract. Recently, Hodgson and Kerckhoff {{found a small}} bound on Dehn <b>surgered</b> 3 -manifolds from {{hyperbolic}} knots not admitting hyperbolic structures using deformations of hyperbolic cone-manifolds. They {{asked whether}} the area normalized meridian length squared of maximal tubular neighborhoods of the singular locus of the cone-manifold is decreasing and that summed with the cone angle squared is increasing as we deform the cone-angles. We confirm this near 0 cone-angles for an infinite family of hyperbolic conemanifolds obtained by Dehn surgeries along the Whitehead link complements. The basic method is based on explicit holonomy computations using the A-polynomials and finding the maximal tubes. One of the key tool is the Taylor expression of a geometric component of the zero set of the A-polynomial {{in terms of the}} cone-angles. We also show a sequence of Taylor expressions for Dehn <b>surgered</b> manifolds converges to one for the limit hyperbolic manifold. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{establish}} a tight inequality relating the knot genus g(K) and the surgery slope p {{under the assumption}} that p-framed Dehn surgery along K is an L-space that bounds a sharp 4 -manifold. This inequality applies in particular when the <b>surgered</b> manifold is a lens space or a connected sum thereof. Combined with work of Gordon-Luecke, Hoffman, and Matignon-Sayari, it follows that if surgery along a knot produces a connected sum of lens spaces, then the knot is either a torus knot or a cable thereof, confirming the cabling conjecture in this case. 1...|$|R
