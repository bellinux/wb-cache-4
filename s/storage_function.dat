The construction of the <b>storage</b> <b>function,</b> as the analogue of a Lyapunov function is called, led {{to the study of the}} linear matrix inequality (LMI) in control theory. Applied to linear-quadratic-Gaussian control, the construction of the <b>storage</b> <b>function</b> leads to the Kalman-Yakubovich-Popov lemma. In the 1980s Willems worked on the geometric theory of linear systems, where he introduced {{the notion of a}}lmost invariant subspace. Since the 1990s, he has devoted his interest to the development of the behavioral approach to systems theory and control. In the behavioral approach a dynamical system is simply viewed as a family of trajectories. This approach avoids having to separate the system variables into inputs and outputs.|$|E
