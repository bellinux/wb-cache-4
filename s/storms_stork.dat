5000|$|This {{species is}} very similar and {{closely related to the}} woolly-necked stork [...] whose range {{partially}} overlaps with that of the <b>Storm's</b> <b>Stork.</b> Although the <b>Storm's</b> <b>stork</b> has long been considered a separate species, it has also been previously treated as a subspecies of the woolly-necked stork in the more recent past. However, <b>Storm's</b> <b>stork</b> is characterised by a yellowish-orange facial skin patch around the eye that is absent in the woolly-necked stork; and the neck is black and white, whereas it is completely white in the woolly-necked stork. However, the specific distinguishing features of <b>Storm's</b> <b>stork</b> have been poorly known in the past, which in the field has frequently led to confusion with the woolly-necked stork.|$|R
50|$|These {{two species}} are also ecologically segregated, with the <b>Storm's</b> <b>stork</b> keeping to dense forests and the woolly-necked stork mainly inhabiting open swamp, rice paddy, {{grassland}} and dry cultivated areas. There {{is evidence of}} sympatry of these two species in Sumatra, where both of these habitats are present. Further, phylogenetic analyses of the Ciconiidae based on a portion of cytochrome oxidase b gene have suggested with strong support that the <b>Storm's</b> <b>stork</b> and the woolly-necked stork are sister species.|$|R
50|$|Bird species include: great argus, little green-pigeon, white-rumped shama, white-bellied woodpecker, crested serpent-eagle, Hill myna, helmeted hornbill, {{wrinkled}} hornbill, white-winged wood duck, <b>Storm's</b> <b>stork,</b> garnet pitta and grey-breasted babbler.|$|R
50|$|Vulnerable {{bird species}} include the large green pigeon (Treron capellei) and {{possibly}} <b>Storm's</b> <b>stork</b> (Ciconia stormi) and lesser adjutant (Leptoptilus javanicus). Efforts are underway to establish long-term ecological monitoring in the forest.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Storm's</b> <b>stork</b> is {{possibly}} not strongly {{directly affected by}} habitat fragmentation through deforestation. It may actually be somewhat tolerant of fragmentation because it could fly great distances in search of new habitat and be relatively unaffected by the open land matrix which it overflies. However, this is probably not a favourable situation for the species, and the exact maximum distances it will travel to reach new habitat are currently unknown. A larger impact of deforestation on the <b>Storm's</b> <b>stork</b> {{is more likely to}} be the decrease in freshwater faunal prey abundance and diversity resulting from increased sedimentation, nutrient loads and water temperatures after logging. This loss of freshwater taxa would in turn decrease food availability for this stork at its foraging sites. Road building through the forests to access logging areas creates similar problems by contributing to soil erosion, thereby also decreasing freshwater prey diversity. The large canopy gaps created through logging also lead to drier abiotic conditions in the cleared areas than under dense canopy, which would render these areas unsuitable for food taxa of the <b>Storm's</b> <b>stork</b> such as amphibians and invertebrates that require wet substrates to live on. This is another likely contributor to the decrease in food taxa abundance after forest clearing.|$|R
50|$|The {{wildlife}} sanctuary {{is named after}} the river (Khlong) Saeng, {{a tributary of the}} Phum Duang River. Most of the lowland areas in the Khlong Saeng valley were flooded with the building of the Chiao Lan reservour. This now flooded area was also the only location within Thailand where <b>Storm's</b> <b>stork</b> (Ciconia stormi) was confirmed to breed in 1986.|$|R
5000|$|This {{species has}} been shown to be {{somewhat}} tolerant of logged forests; however, these areas’ actual value as a breeding habitat for this species is disputed. Danielsen and Heegaard [...] have considered <b>Storm's</b> <b>stork</b> incapable of breeding in logged forests despite apparent short term survival. In any case, current records have been too short to demonstrate long-term value of logged forests to this stork species. The acceptance of logged forests by <b>Storm's</b> <b>stork</b> may also entail some caveats; for example, that there must invariably be easy access within logged forest to freshwater margins, and that at least 20 years of forest regeneration should be allowed to elapse before real habitat value is re-established. A local mosaic of primary and logged forest may also explain this species’ apparent persistence in logged forest, because it may rely on the undisturbed forest patches as a refuge to sustain itself in the logged forest patches.|$|R
50|$|The {{terrestrial}} fauna of {{the park}} include 24 recorded species of mammals, including as gibbons, banded langurs and long-tailed macaque. 185 species of birds have been recorded in the park, including hornbills and migratory water birds like <b>Storm's</b> <b>stork.</b> A noteworthy reptile found here is the saltwater crocodile. Dolphins {{are found in the}} sea off the park's coast. Occasionally, green turtles come ashore to lay their eggs.|$|R
50|$|Maludam National Park {{also has}} one of only about five viable populations of {{proboscis}} monkey (Nasalis larvatus) in Sarawak. There is also a significant population of silvery lutung (Trachypithecus cristata). Diversity of other mammals is low, but there are numerous birds in the park, including black, Oriental pied and rhinoceros hornbills, blue-eared and stork-billed kingfishers, green imperial pigeon, slender-billed crow, greater racket-tailed drongo and, occasionally, the rare <b>Storm's</b> <b>stork.</b>|$|R
50|$|Within {{the park}} is the largest {{breeding}} colony of milky storks in the world, {{and one of the}} largest colonies of lesser adjutant. Other threatened birds in the park include the <b>Storm's</b> <b>stork,</b> white-winged duck, Nordmann's greenshank and Far Eastern curlew. The total bird population of the park has been estimated to be up to one million, while during winter up to 100,000 migratory birds stop over for rest.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Storm's</b> <b>stork</b> (Ciconia stormi) is a {{medium-sized}} stork species that occurs primarily in lowland tropical forests of Indonesia, Malaysia and southern Thailand. It {{is considered to}} be the rarest of all storks, and is estimated to number less than 500 wild individuals throughout its geographic range. The population has long been in decline and the primary cause is widely considered to be deforestation of its native habitat.|$|R
50|$|Danau Sentarum National Park has a rich {{fish fauna}} with around 240 {{recorded}} species, including the Asian arowana and clown loach botia. There have been 237 bird species recorded including the <b>Storm's</b> <b>stork</b> and great argus. Of the 143 mammal species 23 are endemic to Borneo including the proboscis monkey. There {{is a relatively}} large population of the endangered orangutans present in the park. The 26 reptile species include the false gharial and estuarine crocodile.|$|R
50|$|About half of {{the bird}} species are inhabiting the coastal swamps, {{including}} mangroves, riverine forest, freshwater and peat swamp forest, and the marshes of the area. The park {{is one of the}} last strongholds of the white-winged wood duck, with a population between 24-38 birds left, the largest in Sumatra. Among the other 405 species of bird recorded in the park, are the <b>Storm's</b> <b>stork,</b> woolly-necked stork, lesser adjutant, crested fireback, great argus and Oriental darter.|$|R
50|$|Another minor {{threat is}} {{the capture of}} {{individuals}} for the international zoo trade, which increased markedly in the late 1980s. Although captivity of <b>Storm's</b> <b>storks</b> may be a solution to support the global population, these birds may be unsuitable to reintroduce to their natural habitat because they have become too tame. In Singapore, the price of this species on bird markets doubled ($300 to $600) in the early 1990s. However, {{there is no evidence}} that they have international trade value.|$|R
50|$|This stork is {{sometimes}} hunted for food, either by native forest dwellers or non-natives {{who have been}} attracted to the area by large-scale land exploitation projects. Although there is a relatively low human population density in areas of undisturbed forest habitat of this species, these people concentrate on gleaning forest products and poaching wildlife. During these activities, <b>Storm's</b> <b>storks</b> are occasionally caught for food either directly by people who extract latex from the jelutong tree, or in baited traps for the monitor lizard Varanus serator.|$|R
50|$|Less typical {{habitats}} {{include the}} dense temperate forests used by European black storks, or the rainforest habitat sought by <b>Storm's</b> <b>stork</b> in South East Asia. They generally avoid marine habitats, {{with the exception}} of the lesser adjutant, milky stork and wood stork, all of which forage in mangroves, lagoons and estuarine mudflats. A number of species have adapted to highly-modified human habitats, either for foraging or breeding. In the absence of persecution several species breed close to people, and species such as the marabou and white stork will feed at landfill sites.|$|R
50|$|Animals {{include a}} herd of the {{critically}} endangered Sumatran elephant. Several hundred elephants from surrounding areas that were being deforested or converted for agriculture were driven into the Padang-Sugihan.Other animals recorded in the park include leopard cat, fishing cat, Malayan sun bear, hairy-nosed otter, small-clawed otter, masked palm civet, otter civet, agile gibbon, southern pig-tailed macaque, crab-eating macaque, silvered leaf monkey, greater mouse deer, lesser mouse deer, wild boar, Bornean bearded pig, sambar deer, and previously the critically endangered Sumatran tiger. The reserve {{is also an important}} wetland for a number of bird species, including <b>Storm's</b> <b>stork,</b> white-winged duck and the great hornbill.|$|R
50|$|Other {{species are}} found {{isolated}} on mountains, such as golden-naped barbets, spot-necked bulbuls and mountain serpent-eagles. Bulbuls, starlings and house swifts {{can be found}} in urban areas. Crested serpent-eagles and kingfishers can be found. There are nine species of hornbill in Malaysia, the most common of which is the Oriental pied hornbill. At 1.5 m from head to tail is the largest hornbill, the great hornbill, followed closely in size by the rhinoceros hornbill of Borneo. The fish eagle and brahminy kite are the most common birds of prey. <b>Storm's</b> <b>stork</b> and the Oriental darter {{can be found in}} wetlands.|$|R
5000|$|Although <b>Storm's</b> <b>stork</b> accepts both lowland {{riverine}} forest and peat swamp forest, {{it is currently}} unknown which of these habitats provide optimal living conditions for the species. However, peat-swamp forest {{does appear to be}} an underestimated, ecologically important habitat for this stork across much of its range. In the wake of continued anthropogenic loss of lowland {{riverine forest}}, peat-swamp forest possibly provides an important refuge for the species [...] and an extensive area of peat swamp forest occurs in West Kalimantan. However, this forest habitat is also under threat through conversion to palm oil plantations, logging and forest fires, so that increased conservation efforts should be directed on protecting peat-swamp forest.|$|R
50|$|In 1986, {{the first}} nest {{of this species}} ever known to science was {{discovered}} in Southern Thailand. However, {{the construction of the}} Chiew Larn Dam in the same year led to destruction of much of this stork's lowland forest habitat through extensive flooding. Following the flooding, <b>Storm's</b> <b>stork</b> was therefore believed to no longer breed there and since then was previously considered extinct in Thailand. However, this stork was re-sighted in Southern Thailand in 2004 with infrared camera traps; but continues to be exceptionally uncommon given that usually only one individual has been sighted at a time despite the high intensity of camera trapping. Nevertheless, its persistence in Southern Thailand does suggest the presence of a small breeding population.|$|R
5000|$|This stork {{typically}} forages stealthily with slow, deliberate {{movements and}} a retracted neck [...] along muddy banks of rivers and creeks within dense primary forest; keeping {{primarily to the}} shaded areas. Individuals with chicks usually forage 2-3 km from the nest. It will also use other freshwater bodies as foraging localities with high densities of fish and freshwater invertebrates. These include small pools, trackside puddles, swamps and oxbow lakes; and the <b>Storm's</b> <b>stork</b> {{may be able to}} use these features optimally where they occur in a patchwork arrangement on riparian floodplains. It can also use boggy clearings created by ungulates such as gaur that trample vegetation to access mineral licks. In contrast, deep, fast-flowing rivers and waterways are avoided by this species due to reduced prey availability and its inability to stand in these waters.|$|R

40|$|We provide {{results of}} a second survey of the hutan adat (forest {{traditionally}} exploited {{on a small scale}} by local people) situated in the Gunung Lumut Protection Forest, East Kalimantan, conducted in 2007 and closely following the first survey in 2005 (Wielstra & Pieterse 2009. Kukila 14 : 1 - 15). An additional 29 species were observed, bringing the total number of species observed in GLPF to 217. These include two globally threatened (Vulnerable) species, 16 “Sundaic Lowland Forest” biomerestricted species and one “Sundaic montane forest” biome-restricted species. We confirmed the presence of over 1 % of the biogeographic population of the congregatory waterbird <b>Storm’s</b> <b>Stork</b> Ciconia stormi. The findings provide further support for our previous suggestion to recognize Gunung Lumut Protection Forest as an Important Bird Area. We also provide some remarks on the potential conservation value of hutanadat and raise issues to be addressed in further studies...|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Storm's</b> <b>stork</b> feeds {{primarily}} on small fish, frogs, aquatic insect larvae, and sometimes earthworms. These {{are also the}} food items brought by both parents back for their young at the nest; with the fish measuring 5-7 cm long and weighing 10-30g, and the worms measuring 10-15 cm long. The parents regurgitate the food {{into the bottom of}} the nest, whereupon it is picked up and swallowed by the chicks. During a series of nest observations in south Sumatra in 1989, adults were found to return to the nest with food for the chicks every 2-4 hours in June,; but in July, food was brought to the nest less often and significantly more frequently in the late afternoons. In Sabah, they have also been reported to feed on grasshoppers and possibly crabs. Hence, other food taxa may be similar to those of the woollynecked stork, but more data are required to fully confirm this, [...]|$|R
5000|$|Hutan Kahaylan (...) is a peat swamp {{forest of}} about 150,000 {{hectares}} between the Kastingen and Kahayan rivers {{that so far}} has suffered least from the Mega Rice Project, {{although it has been}} badly damaged. Because it is close to the regional capital Palangkaraya it is still at risk. Vulnerable bird species include the large green pigeon (Treron capellei) and possibly <b>Storm's</b> <b>stork</b> (Ciconia stormi) and lesser adjutant (Leptoptilus javanicus). The Sabangau Forest is centered on the blackwater Sabangau River. There is no longer any continuous forest cover where orangutans may cross this river. The forest has been badly damaged by legal and illegal forestry, but the western part is now protected as either National Park or National Laboratory Research Area. With a relatively small human population, there is some hope that this area of the forest may recover. The more badly damaged eastern part, between the Sabangau and the Kayahan, is still officially designated for agriculture, although no further efforts are being made to make it suitable for this purpose.|$|R
5000|$|The nest {{is usually}} located 19-30m above ground above riverbanks, {{often in the}} forks of trees of Dipterocarpus species. At south Sumatra, a <b>Storm's</b> <b>stork</b> nest was studied that lay 8.3m above ground in an 18m-tall Rhizosphora mucronata tree. In captivity, both {{the male and female}} have been {{observed}} to carry out nest-building activities. The nest has an external outer diameter measuring between 30 and 50 cm; with a depth of 10-15 cm, and is typically composed of twigs and sticks mainly belonging to tree species in the Rhizosphora genus, but also from species in the families Loranthaceae, Dipterocarpaceae, and Rubinaceae. These sticks measure 15- 60 cm in length [...] and 0.5-1.5 cm in diameter. The nest interior is lined with soft material such as grass and down. 2-4 cm long leaflets from Xylocarpus species have also been identified as nest material, and these plants have been found growing in the area surrounding the nest. [...] The same nest is often used by a pair over consecutive years; whereby both mates add more material to the nest each year.|$|R
25|$|The current Aquatic Bird House {{opened on}} September 24, 1964, on the {{foundation}} of the original house, which was opened on November 8, 1899, {{with the rest of the}} zoo. The building features a multitude of mostly open-fronted enclosures mainly focusing on coastal and wetland habitats and the species that rely on them. Scarlet ibises, roseate spoonbills, a Madagascar crested ibis, giant wood rail, pied avocets, Baer's pochards, common terns, African spoonbills, silver teals and Forster's terns are among the residents here. The exhibit also features an outdoor pond home to a flock of American flamingos and Orinoco geese, and a large aviary home to lesser adjutant storks. The zoo is one of only three zoos in North America working with the endangered storks and has bred them several times, including the hatching of two chicks on June 27 and August 15, 2015. The Aquatic Bird House is also home to another endangered <b>stork</b> species: the <b>Storm's</b> <b>stork.</b> The zoo is one of only two in the United States working with this species; the other being the San Diego Zoo. In May 2014, the zoo opened a new nocturnal enclosure for a North Island brown kiwi in the building, and in May 2015, a colony of little blue penguins from the Taronga Zoo were added.|$|R
