He was the Design Director at Knoll until 1971. After that time, he became an independent consultant, designing projects for Westinghouse, Domore, Stylex and Fixtures.|$|E

5000|$|Don Charles Albinson [...] (November 22, 1921 - November 17, 2008) was an American {{industrial}} designer who made many {{contributions to the}} world of furniture. He worked with Charles and Ray Eames for 13 years, helping develop many of the seminal Herman Miller furniture pieces from the mid century - the bent plywood chair, the fiberglass shell chair, the aluminum group set, and the Eames Lounge chair, to name a few. He later developed the Knoll <b>Stack</b> <b>chair,</b> the Westinghouse office line, an update to the DoMore Series 7 landscape system named Neo 7, the Albi <b>stack</b> <b>chair</b> for Fixtures, and the Bounce chair for Stylex.|$|R
5000|$|In 1974 Westinghouse {{introduced}} the ASD Group of office seating, which Albinson designed, and it remained {{a very successful}} line for many years. In 1984 Albinson redesigned the DoMore Series 7 landscape furniture system, rebranding it the Neo 7 System. The Albi <b>stack</b> <b>chair</b> [...] was introduced by Fixtures in 1987, and continued to be in production some 25 years later. The final contract furniture project was a <b>stack</b> <b>chair</b> for Stylex, the Bounce chair, introduced in 1997 and still in production through 2013. In 1977 the Allentown Art Museum (Pennsylvania) featured an exhibition of Albinson’s furniture designs.

2500|$|Although the railcars {{had already}} {{received}} high-density seating, overcrowding of the [...] push–pull trains {{was such that}} the transverse seats were replaced by longitudinal ones to give more standing room. [...] Notoriously, the seating provided was similar to contemporaneous plastic <b>stacking</b> <b>chairs</b> in dingy shades of green and orange. In 1980, the driving trailers and connector cars typically had 58 seats, the standard intermediates 70 and the former powered intermediates 66; however, there were minor variations among the individual cars. Yet another modification took place in early 1984, when some cars intended for retention after electrification received [...] "more comfortable seating." [...] This consisted of the then standard class high backed bench seats, seating three and two passengers respectively. [...] The seats were upholstered in blue moquette with a vinyl headrest running {{along the top of}} the bench.|$|R

The project investigates how reflective design articulated directly through artefacts may be used rhetorically to bring sustainable issues and a revaluing what we already have into critical focus. It comprised of 6 chair re-construction studies using a standard, injection moulded, plastic, shell chair mounted on steel frame. A common and universally familiar chair type found everywhere. Using an experimental method analogous to archaeology, common chair forms metaphorically lost from awareness because of their anonymous ubiquity were subject to a kind of anatomical dissection, deconstruction in order to visually rediscover them. The resulting inventory of parts formed the basis of speculative modification and reassembly. Speculations were rigorously situated within the examined object’s specific nature and function. This strategy generated new, highly visible chair constructs embodying clearly validated, authentic visual narratives. Cross-section cuts and reassemblies re-present in visual narrative, the elegant utility of the generic stacking and linking function...|$|R

50|$|Off and on {{for eight}} years, Rowland worked on and perfected a design for a revolutionary new <b>stacking</b> <b>chair</b> with a wire frame and sculpted seat and back. Forty {{of them could be}} stacked just 4 feet high on a {{specially}} designed dolly. It not only stacked with ease, but could be ganged together to form rows in a matter of seconds. The slim slender profile of the design completely belies the comfort it offers, an attribute achieved only after long testing to find the contour that would best fit the greatest number of human shapes.|$|E
50|$|Although Day {{was never}} {{formally}} employed by Hille, preferring {{to act as}} a design consultant, he became their chief designer in effect. The partnership proved so successful that, for the next 20 years, he created most of Hille’s designs. Right from the start, his primary aim was the marriage between functionalism and technology. The utilitarian Hillestak Chair (1951), a <b>stacking</b> <b>chair</b> with a beech plywood seat and a solid beech frame, was his first mass-produced design. His Hilleplan (1953) and Interplan Units (1955) marked a logical progression from the storage systems created for the Festival of Britain. Both were modular, so that multiple units could be combined in coordinated groups. Like many of his designs, they were both handsome and practical, making them equally suitable for domestic or contract use.|$|E
50|$|In 1966 the Bofinger Chair {{made its}} debut at the {{furniture}} fair in Cologne. The same year it received the ‘Rosenthal-Studio’ Award {{in the presence of}} Chancellor Ludwig Erhard, Philipp Rosenthal und Walter Gropius. The Bofinger Chair became a design icon of its time. In 1971 on the occasion of an art happening in Berlin twelve well-known artists - among those Joseph Beuys, Sigmar Polke, Günther Uecker, Wolf Vostell, and Stefan Wewerka - transformed the Bofinger <b>stacking</b> <b>chair</b> into an art object. Museums, such as the Victoria & Albert Museum in London, the Centre Pompidou in Paris and the Vitra Design Museum in Weil am Rhein, included the Bofinger Chair in their collection.

5000|$|David Lincoln Rowland (February 12, 1924 [...] - [...] August 13, 2010) was an American {{industrial}} designer {{famous for his}} 40/4 chair, so named because it <b>stacks</b> 40 <b>chairs</b> in 4 ft high. The chair was the first compactly stackable chair invented, and {{is regarded as the}} gold standard of stackable chairs, not only for its stackability, but for its comfort, durability, timelessness, and grace. Referring to the 40/4, modern critics have noted that “It is unsurpassed to this day in engineering sophistication and production”. In continuous production since its introduction, the chair has sold in the millions around the world over 5 decades and is found in many prestigious locations, including St. Paul’s Cathedral in London and the Museum of Modern Art in New York City.|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} {{for differences in}} subjective ratings of discomfort and comfort (Numerical Rating Scale) and objective measures of hamstring (Sit-Reach test), lumbar (Schöber's test) and neck (Cervical Range of Motion) flexibility in healthy young subjects (n = 24) following 4 h of sitting on <b>stacking</b> <b>chairs</b> with or without limited legroom. When comparing the limited and unlimited legroom groups for differences in subjective and objective measures over 4 h, no significant findings were seen at the 5 % level of confidence. However, differences in buttock, neck, shoulder and average discomfort were significantly negatively correlated to differences between post-warm up Sit-Reach scores (Correlation Co-efficients: - 763, - 434, - 408, and - 445; p values of. 004,. 034,. 048, and. 029, respectively). The difference in buttock discomfort was significantly negatively correlated {{to the difference between}} pre-warm up Sit-Reach scores (Correlation Coefficient: - 750; p = 0. 005), post-sitting/pre-warm up and pre-sitting/post-warm up Sit-Reach scores (Correlation Coefficient: - 756; p = 0. 004), and Schöber's tests (Correlation Coefficient: - 578; p = 0. 049). Although the above results suggest a relationship between a loss in flexibility and an increase in discomfort, the mechanism influencing this relationship is not clear from this study. What does appear clear is that the limiting of legroom to the parameters used in this study does not seem to exacerbate change in flexibility and discomfort which are a consequence of prolonged sitting. Relevance to industry: Many forms of public transport provide limited legroom for their passengers, which may have an adverse affect on the user's flexibility or experience of discomfort. Determining which objectively measurable parameters are associated with the subjective level of discomfort during sitting should allow for a greater appreciation of the changes that underpin such subjective perceptions...|$|R
