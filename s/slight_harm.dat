However, if a bishop may lawfully crack a man's head, as an eggshell, I see not that blame can attach to me, a humble and most unworthy son of the church, if some <b>slight</b> <b>harm</b> should come to any man, from the use of so peaceful an instrument as a staff.

50|$|A {{group of}} {{soldiers}} under Don Lope of Figueroa stops {{in the town of}} Zalamea, where the captain of the troop, Don Alvaro, is housed by the wealthy farmer Pedro Crespo. Hearing about the military's plans, Pedro Crespo decides to hide his daughter and niece in the attic, knowing that when the military comes around, honors are often ruined. However, Don Alvaro arrives with the intention of seeing Isabel, for he has heard the rumors of her beauty. Housed by Pedro Crespo, Don Alvaro devises a plan to fake a fight with Rebolledo and have him run away into the attic in order to catch a glimpse at Isabel and ascertain for himself whether the rumors about her beauty are true. The plan works, although the ruckus brings the attention of the general, Don Lope of Figueroa. Don Lope decides to stay at Pedro's house, and they develop an instant dislike for each other. Don Lope brashly declares that he would hang anyone who might bring any <b>slight</b> <b>harm</b> to his men. Pedro makes the same vow for anyone who would besmirch his honor, stating that honor is the connection to the soul and thus to God. They part ways, each thinking the other overtly stubborn.|$|E

In 1869 Aitken responded to Dr J Morgan, who was {{investigating}} {{the health effects of}} rowing. Your letter reached me at a most opportune time, as I was in company with my old friend Mr J.

Kelly complained, among other things, that Arriba's search engine used thumbnails to deep link to images on his Web page. The court found that Arriba's use was highly transformative, in that it made available to Internet users a functionality not previously available, and that was not otherwise readily provided — an improved way to search for images (by using visual cues instead of verbal cues). This factor, combined with the relatively <b>slight</b> economic <b>harm</b> to Kelly, tipped the fair use balance decisively in Arriba's favor.|$|R
5000|$|... ==Ramdasji’s miraculous feats== Several miracles {{have been}} {{attributed}} to Swami Ramdasji among which the incident of his miraculous escape from a burning pyre built around him when he was in a meditative trance is particularly significant, once he was being accompanied by a younger ascetic who actually was a criminal minded lowlife and was jealous of Ramdasji’s prowess, in order {{to get rid of him}} forever he hatched a clever plan, when Ramdasji was in a deep meditative trance this guy piled up a huge quantity of firewood which he had obtained through coercive tactics from the nearby village. He set fire to this huge pyre and fled from the spot thinking that Ramdasji would be turned to ashes within no time. But Ramdasji’s yogic powers didn’t allow even the <b>slightest</b> <b>harm</b> to his body. In fact, after he had arisen he saw that he was sitting in the midst of a pile of ash and some villagers were running towards him, they too had thought that Ramdasji would surely die within no time and had rushed to save him as soon as they got to know of it but were astounded to see the miraculous yogic powers of the great saint. Later on he narrated this incident to one of his disciples and said that that was a proof of his successful yogic practice because one who hasn’t accomplished the capability to withstand the effect of fire without suffering even the slightetst harm has not attained success in yoga completely.|$|R
40|$|Background: Lower-respiratory-tract {{infection}} {{is one of}} the most common acute illnesses managed in primary care. Few placebo-controlled studies of antibiotics have been done, and overall effectiveness (particularly in subgroups such as older people) is debated. We aimed to compare the benefits and harms of amoxicillin for acute lower-respiratory-tract infection with those of placebo both overall and in patients aged 60 years or older. Methods: Patients older than 18 years with acute lower-respiratory-tract infections (cough of ? 28 days' duration) in whom pneumonia was not suspected were randomly assigned (1 : 1) to either amoxicillin (1 g three times daily for 7 days) or placebo by computer-generated random numbers. Our primary outcome was duration of symptoms rated “moderately bad” or worse. Secondary outcomes were symptom severity in days 2 — 4 and new or worsening symptoms. Investigators and patients were masked to treatment allocation. This trial is registered with EudraCT (2007 - 001586 - 15), UKCRN Portfolio (ID 4175), ISRCTN (52261229), and FWO (G. 0274. 08 N). Findings: 1038 patients were assigned to the amoxicillin group and 1023 to the placebo group. Neither duration of symptoms rated “moderately bad” or worse (hazard ratio 1 · 06, 95 % CI 0 · 96 — 1 · 18; p= 0 · 229) nor mean symptom severity (1 · 69 with placebo vs 1 · 62 with amoxicillin; difference ? 0 · 07 [95 % CI ? 0 · 15 to 0 · 007]; p= 0 · 074) differed significantly between groups. New or worsening symptoms were significantly less common in the amoxicillin group than in the placebo group (162 [15 · 9 %] of 1021 patients vs 194 [19 · 3 %] of 1006; p= 0 · 043; number needed to treat 30). Cases of nausea, rash, or diarrhoea were significantly more common in the amoxicillin group than in the placebo group (number needed to harm 21, 95 % CI 11 — 174; p= 0 · 025), and one case of anaphylaxis was noted with amoxicillin. Two patients in the placebo group and one in the amoxicillin group needed to be admitted to hospital; no study-related deaths were noted. We noted no evidence of selective benefit in patients aged 60 years or older (n= 595). Interpretation: When pneumonia is not suspected clinically, amoxicillin provides little benefit for acute lower-respiratory-tract infection in primary care both overall and in patients aged 60 years or more, and causes <b>slight</b> <b>harms.</b> Funding European Commission Framework Programme 6, UK National Institute for Health Research, Barcelona Ciberde Enfermedades Respiratorias, and Research Foundation Flanders...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your little cousin," [...] said he, [...] "is a most charming young creature, and on {{interested}} motives I should oppose your {{going to}} your aunt's house, {{were it not for}} the fact that she is married, and, therefore, of no danger to you. I was very glad to find her there. Her influence over your aunt will, I think, be highly advantageous, and the first fruit of it is that the old lady will now welcome you with open arms. Would you believe it! she has already announced that she wishes to make a match between you and this little cousin; and in order to do so, has actually engaged me to endeavor to bring about a divorce between the young lady and her absent husband. The widow Keswick has as many cranks and crotchets in her head as there are seeds in a tobacco pod; but this is the queerest and the wildest of them all. The couple seem very much attached to each other, and nothing can be said against the husband except that he did not accompany his wife on her visit to her relatives; and if he knew anything about the old lady I don't blame him a bit. Now your course, my dear boy, is perfectly plain. Let your aunt talk as much as she pleases about this divorce, and your union with the little Annie. It won't hurt anybody, and she must talk herself out in time. In the mean time take advantage of the present circumstances to mollify and tone down, so to speak, the good old lady. Make her understand that we are all her friends, and that there is no one in the connection who would wish to do her the <b>slightest</b> <b>harm.</b> This would be our Christian duty at any time, but it is more particularly our duty now. I would like you to bring your cousin over to see us before Roberta goes away. I invited her to come, and told her that my niece would first call upon her {{were it not for the}} peculiar circumstances. But if the families can be in a measure brought together--and I shall make it a point to ride over there occasionally--if your aunt can be made to understand the kindly feelings we really have toward her, and can be induced to set aside, even in a slight degree, the violent prejudice she now holds against us, all may yet turn out well. Now go, my boy, and may the best of success go with you. Don't trouble yourself about sending back the horse. Keep him as long as you want him." ...|$|R

Of course, I {{do not want to}} leave you all here, but there is no help for it, and I don't believe you need have the <b>slightest</b> fear of <b>harm.</b> Later, we will plan {{what is to be done}} by you and by me, and get everything clear and straight. The first thing is to get the boat ready, and I shall go to work on that to-day. I will also take some of the negroes down to the Rackbirds' camp, and bring away more stores." ...|$|R
6000|$|Now {{all this}} {{schooling}} need not {{take more than}} twenty hours a week for its backbone or hard-work portion, its English, mathematics, science, and exact drawing, and twelve hours a week for its easier, more individual employments of sketching, painting, and reading, and this leaves a large margin of time for military drill and for physical exercises. If we are {{to get the best}} result from the child's individuality, we must leave a large portion of that margin at the child's own disposal, it must be free to go for walks, to [...] "muck about," [...] as schoolboys say, to play games, and (within limits) to consort with companions of its own choosing--to follow its interests in short. It is in this direction that British middle-class education fails most signally at the present time. The English schoolboy and schoolgirl are positively hunted through their days. They do not play--using the word to indicate a spontaneous employment into which imagination enters--at all. They have games, but they are so regulated that the imagination is eliminated; they have exercises of various stereotyped sorts. They are taken to and fro to these things in the care of persons one would call ushers unhesitatingly were it not that they also pretended to teach. The rest of their waking time is preparation or supervised reading or walking under supervision. Their friendships are watched. They are never, never left alone. The avowed ideal of many boarding schoolmasters is to [...] "send them to bed tired out." [...] Largely this is due to a natural dread of accidents and scrapes, that will make trouble for the school, but there is also another cause. If I may speak frankly and entirely as an unauthoritative observer, I would say it is a regrettable thing that so large a proportion of British secondary schoolmasters and mistresses are unmarried. The normal condition of a healthy adult is marriage, and for all those who are not defective upon this side (and that means an incapacity to understand many things) celibacy is a state of unstable equilibrium and too often a quite unwholesome condition. Wherever there are celibate teachers I am inclined to suspect a fussiness, an unreasonable watchfulness, a disposition to pry, an exaggeration of what are called [...] "Dangers," [...] a painful idealization of [...] "Purity." [...] It {{is a part of the}} normal development of the human being to observe with some particularity certain phenomena, to entertain certain curiosities, to talk of them to trusted equals--never, be it noted, except by perversion to parents or teachers--and there is not the <b>slightest</b> <b>harm</b> in these quite natural things, unless they are forced back into an abashed solitude or associated by suggestion with conceptions of shame and disgust. That is what happens in too many of our girls' schools and preparatory schools to-day, and it is to that end mainly that youthful intimacies are discouraged, youthful freedom is restricted, and imagination and individuality warped and crippled. It is astonishing how much of their adolescence grown-up people will contrive to forget.|$|R
40|$|The 				principle that {{religious}} accommodation is necessary {{should not be}} debatable. 				Recognition of same-sex marriage, whatever technical form legal arguments made 				on its behalf take, exemplifies a 2 ̆ 2 {{live and let live}} 2 ̆ 2 policy. That same policy 				should apply equally to religious believers who oppose same-sex marriagethey 				should not be required to act directly in opposition to their religious 				beliefs, that is, in ways that appear to confer their personal blessing on such 				marriages. That recognizing same-sex marriage will, for the while, put many 				people with 2 ̆ 2 traditional 2 ̆ 2 religious beliefs in a vise between their religious 				commitments and the law is really not open to serious question. Just as 				traditional believers too often <b>slight</b> the <b>harm</b> done to gays when they are 				denied access to marriage and its benefits, so too do advocates of same-sex 				marriage slight the interference with religious practice that the recognition 				of same-sex marriage will inevitably bring about. Proponents 				of same-sex marriage deny that recognizing same-sex marriage will impose any 				costs on religious liberty because religious leaders and institutions would not 				be required to perform or host same-sex marriage ceremonies, a proposition 				echoed by both the California and Iowa decisions recognizing same-sex 				marriage. Some even deny that a conflict exists between religious liberty and 				recognition of same-sex marriage. This denial is particularly irritating given 				the increasing number of cases arising from the clash between same-sex marriage 				(or civil unions) and traditional religious practices here and abroad. This 				Article discusses the case for religious exemptions to same-sex marriage laws 				through analysis of equality and liberty arguments. Though this analysis, this 				Article shows that there is no legal justification for a religious exemption if 				the right to same-sex marriage is based in equality. At the same time, there 				are various and compelling non-legal arguments for the appreciation of 				religious liberty. In the end, the debate on religious exemptions to same-sex 				marriage laws falls on deciding whether equality must make room for liberty 				(and liberty for equality). The take-no-prisoners approach to politics that 				categorizes so much of the contemporary debate makes it unlikely that any 				middle ground will emergeand, in fact, this is how the debate is proceeding. 				This is unfortunate, as a qualified religious exemption may preserve religious 				liberty without placing too large a burden on the equality of same-sex couples...|$|R
40|$|Ghostwriters {{are hired}} by politicians, celebrities, {{professionals}} and even established authors {{to do the}} work of writing for significant monetary compensation. Although ghostwriters receive no professional credit for their authorship, publishers who employ ghostwriters enjoy the financial windfall of marketing a book by a well-known person. While the economic harm of purchasing a relatively inexpensive book from what the consumer thought was a best-selling author is relatively <b>slight,</b> the serious <b>harm</b> of ghostwriting is the message received by the consumer who thinks that the ideas and message of the book come from the purported author. Despite the inherently deceptive nature of ghostwriting, it remains unimpeded by consumer protection laws. In Dastar Corporation v. Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation, the United States Supreme Court found that section 43 (a) of the Lanham Act prohibiting 2 ̆ 2 false designations of origin 2 ̆ 2 applies only to the physical object itself and not to the ideas contained within a work. This decision effectively renders enforcement of false designation of origin claims based on deceptive marketing of written works impossible. This note argues that, because the goal of ghostwriting is consumer deception, it should be subject to restriction as a form of false advertising. The note begins by exploring the background of ghostwriting. Next, the note explores the problems inherent in ghostwriting, including societal harms inflicted by ghostwriting. Finally, the note proposes a statutory solution to the ghostwriting problem which attempts to balance the interests and rights of authors and publishers with consumer protection...|$|R
