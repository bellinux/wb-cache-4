2500|$|In the {{ethic of}} care model, {{the aim of}} {{education}} is centered around happiness. [...] Incorporating this component into education involves not only helping our <b>students</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> components of happiness by allowing teachers and students to interact as a whole community [...] In regard {{to the education of}} the whole child, Noddings (2005) stated that, “We will not find the solution to problems of violence, alienation, ignorance, and unhappiness in increasing our security, imposing more tests, punishing schools for their failure to produce 100 percent proficiency, or demanding that teachers be knowledgeable in the subjects they teach. Instead, we must allow teachers and students to interact as whole persons, and we must develop policies that treat the school as a whole community.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Feminist historians see mainly two {{specific}} histories. The {{first is}} the public, singular history. It is composed of political events and newspapers. The second {{is made up of}} women’s history and analyzed primary sources. The integration of these two histories helps historians to look at the past with a more feminist lens, the way feminist historians do. Professor Peter G. Filene of the University of North Carolina recounted in his paper Integrating Women’s History and Regular History that “ purpose is to help <b>students</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> values and behavior of people who are unlike themselves. Through history we enter other lives, analyze the forces that shaped those lives, and ultimately understand patterns of culture." [...] In fact, when Filene was asked to teach a course on the history of American women, the revelations of past women allowed him to recognize that he wasn’t learning heroine history, or herstory, but a compensatory history. However, this thought limited his studies. He found himself thinking of women’s contributions to what men had already written down. Rather than having the histories of the ‘public’ and the ‘domestic’ sphere, one should know that this line between the two is imaginary.|$|E
2500|$|Kittredge's {{administrative}} power, vast erudition, prestige, and the histrionic attitude {{he assumed}} with undergraduates provoked resentment. A notable critic was his colleague, Irving Babbitt (a professor of French) and Babbitt's former student, Stuart Sherman, who together founded so-called [...] "New Humanist" [...] school of literary appreciation. In a famous article in [...] The Nation of 1913, Sherman accused Kittredge of pedantry and of squeezing {{the life out}} of his subject. Deep ideological disagreements lay at the bottom of these attacks. The New Humanists were social and cultural conservatives who conceived of literary studies as leading to moral improvement by providing a guide to conduct and [...] "humane insight" [...] through an appreciation of and reflection on of the timeless beauties of prescribed [...] "great works." [...] Babbitt bitterly opposed the introduction of elective courses for undergraduates. Deeply suspicious of democracy, he envisioned the goal of a university education as the formation of a superior individual in whom the [...] "will to restraint" [...] would counter what he saw as the degenerate modernism he traced back to pernicious ideas of social progress initiated by Rousseau and his followers. Kittredge and his students, on the other hand, situated the study of languages and literatures in their historical contexts, seeking to capture [...] "the spirit of an age" [...] and often ranging far afield of the traditional Western canon. For Kittredge, reading Chaucer illuminated the world of the Middle Ages, which Kittredge often stated had points in common with our own age and thus helped <b>students</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> world in which we live. Often he guided his students into newly opening fields that he had not had time to investigate, such as Finnish and Celtic studies. According to David Bynum: ...|$|E
