Wreckage and <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> {{habitation}} were discovered on Bikar in 1901, suggesting that the ship had come to grief there, and that the survivors had pushed off in lifeboats shortly before the discovery.

5000|$|HMS Scorpion, a British {{submarine}} {{that had}} gone missing in the Baltic Sea during the Second World War, surfaces {{in the path of}} a Russian freighter in 1981. The vessel is returned to British custody. Naval Intelligence is interested in the case because it seems that, for the first time, a ship has returned from [...] "the Devils Triangle of the North".

Falmouth Coastguard contacted the ship two hours before she went aground and made repeated calls as the ship appeared to ignore shipping lanes. The Sennen Lifeboat was {{first on the scene}} followed by a helicopter from RNAS Culdrose, both reported no <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> any <b>crew</b> on deck. Representatives of the Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIR) met with the crew after docking at Rotterdam. The ship also ran aground two years previously in the Baltic off Denmark.|$|R

Contact is lost with the sub and a search sub is sent out to investigate the silence while one <b>of</b> the labs <b>crew</b> works on exterior repairs in a diving suit. The search sub discovers the relief sub is now derelict and the hatch blown with no <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> the <b>crew</b> and is promptly attacked by large stingray-like creatures.

50|$|With {{the help}} <b>of</b> the <b>Crew</b> Management System software, <b>sign</b> on/sign off <b>of</b> <b>crew</b> members has become {{extremely}} easy. At the lobby, they {{are provided with}} Kiosks, where they use their thumb impression to sign on/sign off.This has removed the need <b>of</b> their <b>signing</b> in registers or remembering passwords. It is very user friendly and easily adaptable by the crew. Also, it has increased security and authentication as it eliminates the possibility of Proxy reporting.It is legally binding.

Herein, the crew blows from his mouth into the device, and if there is any alcohol content found,a thorough check is done.|$|R
500|$|Searches {{continued}} until the ships were laid {{up for the}} long Arctic winter. During this enforced rest there were lectures and classes for the crew, and various theatrical diversions in which Markham was able to display his [...] "great histrionic talent". He did much reading, mainly Arctic history and classical literature, and thought about a possible return visit to Peru, a country which had captivated him during the Collingwood voyage. When spring returned, a series of sledging expeditions was launched to search for further <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> the missing <b>crews.</b> Markham played a full part in these activities, which produced no further evidence of Franklin, but led to the mapping of {{hundreds of miles of}} previously uncharted coast. The expedition returned to England in early October 1851.|$|R

[...] During this exercise, she helped the foreign warships to practice convoy-screening operations and to learn US naval tactics.

40|$|Airport {{guidance}} {{signs are}} a visual information system. It can be equated to a street sign arrangement for conveying runway and taxiway assistance.

When combining simple colors, symbols, letters, and numbers, these elements form an elaborate organization of meaning. The cognitive mental process that takes place is complex. This diversity is complicated even more with the many exceptions to the rule that apply. One must filter through the different scenarios to grasp the sign's message...|$|R

5000|$|Event0 {{is set in}} an {{alternate}} timeline where humanity achieved interplanetary space travel {{as early as the}} 1980s. The game takes place in this timeline's 2012, where the player's character is selected by International Transport Spacelines (ITS) {{to be part of a}} mission to Jupiter's moon Europa, from Earth. En route, the ship suffers a catastropic failure and the player-character appears to be the only member <b>of</b> its <b>crew</b> to escape into a lifepod. The pod drifts for several weeks until it comes across the Nautilus, a leisure ship built in the 1980s. The player-character docks with the ship, and discovers that while the Nautilus is still functional, it has fallen into disrepair, with no <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> its human <b>crew.</b> The only conversations on the ship are through the ship's artificial intelligence (AI) named Kaizen-85 (from the Japanese word kaizen meaning [...] "continuous improvement"), who communicates with the player-character through keyboard terminals throughout the ship. Kaizen-85 instructs the player-character to destroy the Nautiluss [...] "Singularity Drive", the engine that powers the ship, as it claims this will enable it to return them both back to Earth. However, as the player explores the station more, they discover that many of the doors and systems have been locked down apparently by the previous human crew, and must work with Kaizen-85 to access these systems.|$|R

2500|$|One {{major factor}} that limited the ship's secret {{departure}} date {{was that there}} were only two spring tides that year that would see the water level high enough for Queen Elizabeth to leave the Clydebank shipyard, and German intelligence were aware of this fact. A minimal <b>crew</b> <b>of</b> four hundred were assigned for the trip; most were transferred from [...] for a short coastal voyage to Southampton. Parts were shipped to Southampton, and preparations were made to move the ship into the King George V graving dock when she arrived. The names of Brown's shipyard employees were booked to local hotels in Southampton to give a false trail of information and Captain John Townley was appointed as her first master. Townley had previously commanded the Aquitania on one voyage, and several of Cunard's smaller vessels before that. Townley and his hastily <b>signed</b> on <b>crew</b> <b>of</b> four hundred Cunard personnel were told by a company representative before they left to pack for a voyage where they could be away from home for up to six months.|$|R

50|$|Columbus tricks many crewmen {{by telling}} them that the voyage would only last seven weeks. He goes to {{confession}} at the monastery to absolve his sins, and the monk reluctantly gives him absolution, as {{he is unable to}} inform the crewmen without breaking his oath. The next morning, three ships leave for the trip to Asia, with the flagship being the Santa Maria. During the voyage at night, Captain M√©ndez notices him navigating by the stars, a skill previously known only to the Moors. Columbus then happily teaches how to use the quadrant to find the North Star and that the 28th parallel must be followed to find land. Nine weeks go by and still no <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> land. The <b>crew</b> becomes restless and the other captain turns against Columbus. He tries to reinvigorate them, to let them see the dream that he wishes to share. While some of the crewmen were still not convinced, the main sail suddenly catches the wind, which the crewmen see as a small act of God's willingness. At night, Columbus notices mosquitoes on the deck, indicating that land is not far off. Some days later, Columbus and the crew spot an albatross flying around the ship, before disappearing. Suddenly, out of the mist they see Guanahani ("San Salvador") with lush vegetation and sandy beaches, their first glimpse of the New World.|$|R
