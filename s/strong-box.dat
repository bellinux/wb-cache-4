Conway was a {{journalist}} from Geelong, Victoria while Gregory and Gibbes were both Sydney-based accountants working for the New South Wales Public Service. These three cricket enthusiasts were {{the architects of the}} venture. They and the players each contributed the sum of £50 to finance the expedition and later shared equally in the handsome profits that their enterprise generated, having carted the match takings around with them in a closely guarded <b>strong-box</b> all the time that they were away.|$|E

60|$|Do {{you believe}} that the patriots of Amsterdam, when they read the preparatory decree which gave France an {{execution}} on their goods,--do {{you believe that}} those patriots would not have liked better to have remained under the government of the Stadtholder, who took from them no more than a fixed portion of their property, than to pass under that of a revolutionary power, which would make a complete revolution in their bureaus and <b>strong-boxes,</b> and reduce them to wretchedness and rags?[13] Robbery and anarchy, instead of encouraging, will always stifle revolutions.|$|R

You have seen my big <b>strong-boxes</b> in my office, and doubtless thought I keep all my little wares there. Well, so does every thief in London, for they have searched them twice and gained some store of pewter; I {{remember}} {{that some of}} it was discovered again in the King's household.

60|$|Out on all {{furniture}} fashions {{but those}} that are past! Give me my grandfather's old arm-chair, planted upon four carved frogs, as the Hindoos fabled {{the world to be}} supported upon four tortoises; give me his cane, with the gold-loaded top--a cane that, like the musket of General Washington's father and the broadsword of William Wallace, would break down the back of the switch-carrying dandies of these spindle-shank days; give me his broad-breasted vest, coming bravely down over the hips, and furnished with two <b>strong-boxes</b> of pockets to keep guineas in; toss this toppling cylinder of a beaver overboard, and give me my grandfather's gallant, gable-ended, cocked hat.|$|R

60|$|Then {{came the}} sun, {{the first time}} since my stay on the island, and I spread most of my {{garments}} to dry. Of water I drank my careful fill, and I calculated there was ten days' supply if carefully husbanded. It was amazing how rich I felt with this vast wealth of brackish water. And no great merchant, with all his ships returned from prosperous voyages, his warehouses filled to the rafters, his <b>strong-boxes</b> overflowing, could have felt as wealthy as did I when I discovered, cast up on the rocks, the body of a seal that had been dead for many days. Nor did I fail, first, to thank God on my knees for this manifestation of His ever-unfailing kindness. The thing was clear to me: God had not intended I should die. From the very first He had not so intended.|$|R
5000|$|Around noon on 17 August, {{the strands}} again reunite. At Saigon airport, a Mitsubishi Ki-21 heavy bomber, {{of the type}} code named Sally by the Allies, was waiting for Bose and his party. In {{addition}} to Bose, the INA group comprised Colonel Habibur Rahman, his secretary; S. A. Ayer, {{a member of his}} cabinet; Major Abid Hasan, his old associate who had made the hazardous submarine journey from Germany to Sumatra in 1943; and three others. To their dismay, they learned upon arrival that there was room for only one INA passenger. Bose complained, and the beleaguered General Isoda gave in and hurriedly arranged for a second seat. Bose chose Habibur Rahman to accompany him. It was understood that the others in the INA party would follow him on later flights. There was further delay at Saigon airport. According to historian Joyce Chapman Lebra, [...] "a gift of treasure contributed by local Indians was presented to Bose {{as he was about to}} board the plane. The two heavy <b>strong-boxes</b> added overweight to the plane's full load." [...] Sometime between noon and 2 PM, the twin-engine plane took off with 12 or 13 people aboard: a crew of three or four, a group of Japanese army and air force officers, including Lieutenant-General Tsunamasa Shidei, the Vice Chief of Staff of the Japanese Kwantung Army, which although fast retreating in Manchuria still held the Manchurian peninsula, and Bose and Rahman. Bose was sitting a little to the rear of the portside wing; the bomber, under normal circumstances, carried a crew of five.|$|R
50|$|In 1913 Agathon Fabergé, son of Peter Carl Fabergé of House of Fabergé, {{the crown}} jewellers, {{recommended}} that the Imperial regalia be re-catalogued and overhauled. The tsar gave his approval and by July 1914 work on the Imperial orb and sceptre had been completed, and work was about to commence on the crowns. Rising tensions, and {{the outbreak of the}} First World War put a stop to further work, and the regalia were loaded into nine <b>strong-boxes</b> and sent from St Petersburg to Moscow for safekeeping. They were stored in the Kremlin Armoury. The crown remained there {{with the rest of the}} regalia during and after the February and October Revolutions in 1917. In 1922 they were re-catalogued and transferred to the State Treasury. The crown and other pieces of jewellery and regalia were collected into the State Depository of Treasures, later the Diamond Fund, and discussions were carried out with French and British experts as to the possibility of selling off some of the crown jewels to raise foreign currency. The experts advised against selling such pieces as the crown, orb and sceptre, arguing that they were unlikely to attract their historic worth. Nevertheless, the crown jewels were exhibited in 1922 for two journalists of the New York Times, who later wrote: 'Here', says Begasheff of the jewellery commission, opening the box with hands that tremble ever so little despite his air of unconcern, 'is the crown of the Emperor, 32,800 carats of diamonds.''Is it heavy?''No', said one of the workmen, '5 pounds at most - try it,' and placed it straight away on my head.|$|R

6000|$|Another {{thing we}} will not again specify, yet again beseech the Reader to imagine: the reign of Fraternity and Perfection. Imagine, we say, O Reader, that the Millennium were {{struggling}} on the threshold, and yet {{not so much as}} groceries could be had,--owing to traitors. With what impetus would a man strike traitors, in that case? Ah, thou canst not imagine it: thou hast thy groceries safe in the shops, and little or no hope of a Millennium ever coming!--But, indeed, as to the temper there was in men and women, does not this one fact say enough: the height SUSPICION had risen to? Preternatural we often called it; seemingly in the language of exaggeration: but listen to the cold deposition of witnesses. Not a musical Patriot can blow himself a snatch of melody from the French Horn, sitting mildly pensive on the housetop, but Mercier will recognise it to be a signal which one Plotting Committee is making to another. Distraction has possessed Harmony herself; lurks in the sound of Marseillese and ca-ira. (Mercier, Nouveau Paris, vi. 63.) Louvet, who can see as deep into a millstone as the most, discerns that we shall be invited back to our old Hall of the Manege, by a Deputation; and then the Anarchists will massacre Twenty-two of us, as we walk over. It is Pitt and Cobourg; the gold of Pitt.--Poor Pitt! They little know what work he has with his own Friends of the People; getting them bespied, beheaded, their habeas-corpuses suspended, and his own Social Order and <b>strong-boxes</b> kept tight,--to fancy him raising mobs among his neighbours! ...|$|R
6000|$|But Mrs. Glegg carried {{something}} else up-stairs with her, which, {{together with the}} [...] "Saints' Rest" [...] and the gruel, may have had some influence in gradually calming her feelings, and {{making it possible for}} her to endure existence on the ground-floor, shortly before tea-time. This was, partly, Mr. Glegg's suggestion that she would do well to let her five hundred lie still until a good investment turned up; and, further, his parenthetic hint at his handsome provision for her in case of his death. Mr. Glegg, like all men of his stamp, was extremely reticent about his will; and Mrs. Glegg, in her gloomier moments, had forebodings that, like other husbands of whom she had heard, he might cherish the mean project of heightening her grief at his death by leaving her poorly off, in which case she was firmly resolved that she would have scarcely any weeper on her bonnet, and would cry no more than if he had been a second husband. But if he had really shown her any testamentary tenderness, it would be affecting to think of him, poor man, when he was gone; and even his foolish fuss about the flowers and garden-stuff, and his insistence on the subject of snails, would be touching when it was once fairly at an end. To survive Mr. Glegg, and talk eulogistically of him as a man who might have his weaknesses, but who had done the right thing by her, not-withstanding his numerous poor relations; to have sums of interest coming in more frequently, and secrete it in various corners, baffling to the most ingenious of thieves (for, to Mrs. Glegg's mind, banks and <b>strong-boxes</b> would have nullified the pleasure of property; she might as well have taken her food in capsules); finally, to be looked up to by her own family and the neighborhood, so as no woman can ever hope to be who has not the præterite and present dignity comprised in being a [...] "widow well left,"--all this made a flattering and conciliatory view of the future. So that when good Mr. Glegg, restored to good humor by much hoeing, and moved by the sight of his wife's empty chair, with her knitting rolled up in the corner, went up-stairs to her, and observed that the bell had been tolling for poor Mr. Morton, Mrs. Glegg answered magnanimously, quite {{as if she had been}} an uninjured woman: [...] "Ah! then, there'll be a good business for somebody to take to." ...|$|R
60|$|Theft is {{practically}} the sole crime. Originally petty pilferers, {{the men of}} Tai-o-hae now begin to force locks and attack <b>strong-boxes.</b> Hundreds of dollars have been taken at a time; though, with that redeeming moderation so common in Polynesian theft, the Marquesan burglar will always take a part and leave a part, sharing (so to speak) with the proprietor. If it be Chilian coin--the island currency--he will escape; if the sum is in gold, French silver, or bank-notes, the police wait until the money begins to come in circulation, and then easily pick out their man. And now comes the shameful part. In plain English, the prisoner is tortured until he confesses and (if that be possible) restores the money. To keep him alone, day and night, in the black hole, is to inflict on the Marquesan torture inexpressible. Even his robberies are carried on in the plain daylight, under the open sky, with the stimulus of enterprise, and the countenance of an accomplice; his terror of the dark is still insurmountable; conceive, then, what he endures in his solitary dungeon; conceive how he longs to confess, become a full-fledged convict, and be allowed to sleep beside his comrades. While we were in Tai-o-hae a thief was under prevention. He had entered a house about eight in the morning, forced a trunk, and stolen eleven hundred francs; and now, under the horrors of darkness, solitude, and a bedevilled cannibal imagination, he was reluctantly confessing and giving up his spoil. From one cache, which he had already pointed out, three hundred francs had been recovered, and {{it was expected that}} he would presently disgorge the rest. This would be ugly enough if it were all; but I am bound to say, because it is a matter the French should set at rest, that worse is continually hinted. I heard that one man was kept six days with his arms bound backward round a barrel; and it is the universal report that every gendarme in the South Seas is equipped with something in the nature of a thumb-screw. I do not know this. I never had the face to ask any of the gendarmes--pleasant, intelligent, and kindly fellows--with whom I have been intimate, and whose hospitality I have enjoyed; and perhaps the tale reposes (as I hope it does) on a misconstruction of that ingenious cat's-cradle with which the French agent of police so readily secures a prisoner. But whether physical or moral, torture is certainly employed; and by a barbarous injustice, the state of accusation (in which a man may very well be innocently placed) is positively painful; the state of conviction (in which all are supposed guilty) is comparatively free, and positively pleasant. Perhaps worse still,--not only the accused, but sometimes his wife, his mistress, or his friend, is subjected to the same hardships. I was admiring, in the tapu system, the ingenuity of native methods of detection; there is not much to admire in those of the French, and to lock up a timid child in a dark room, and, if he prove obstinate, lock up his sister in the next, is neither novel nor humane.|$|R
6000|$|... 'As of old,' said Saxon. 'More blows than thalers, {{and greater}} {{need of a}} surgeon than of a <b>strong-box.</b> When did I see you last, friend? Was it not at the onfall at Nurnberg, when I led the right and you the left wing of the heavy horse?' ...|$|E

60|$|Our visitor {{staggered}} to {{his feet}} and clutched the mantelpiece with his right hand.

6000|$|... "Nay, father, I do not {{encourage}} the lad to be a spendthrift," [...] says Grafton, taking the pistole himself. [...] "I will place this token of your appreciation in his <b>strong-box.</b> You {{know we have}} a prodigal strain in the family, sir." [...] And my uncle looks at me significantly.|$|E
6000|$|... "Precisely so," [...] said Mr. Acton. [...] "There {{can be no}} {{possible}} doubt as to their intentions. I have the clearest claim upon half of their present estate, and {{if they could have}} found a single paper--which, fortunately, was in the <b>strong-box</b> of my solicitors--they would undoubtedly have crippled our case." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am not sure," [...] he said. [...] "I {{know that}} he has a small iron <b>strong-box</b> screwed into the inside of his roll-top desk, and of course there is a safe in the outer office; but I don't see how we're going to find out whether the paper we want is there." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “In {{a locker}} of the Sub-Rosa I found a {{water-tight}} <b>strong-box.</b> It contained papers.” Vasco paused with dramatic effect and {{searched for a}} moment in the inner breast-pocket of his coat.

6000|$|... "Wait, I can fix that," [...] said Sam, and {{reaching}} for a droplight that hung over the desk, the youngest Rover commenced to unfasten the wire by which it was held in position. By this means {{he was able to}} shift the light so that it hung directly over the opening of the <b>strong-box.</b>|$|E
6000|$|She {{replaced}} the covering, and, without a tear, a sigh, or an additional word of any kind, renewed her efforts, until they conveyed the <b>strong-box</b> betwixt them into Lord Glenvarloch's sleeping apartment.

60|$|Left to themselves, the Rovers {{once more}} {{went over the}} details of the robbery so far as they knew them. Dick opened the safe, showing his {{brothers}} how the combination lock was worked; then the boys looked inside the <b>strong-box,</b> and into the private compartment which, so Dick told them, had contained the missing box of bonds.|$|E
6000|$|... "Here are {{the figures}} for the combination," [...] said Dick, and he turned them over to his brothers. But even with the figures before them, they found it no easy task to open the heavy door of the <b>strong-box.</b> This door was {{provided}} with several bolts, so that to get it open without either working the combination or else blowing the door open, {{was out of the}} question.|$|E
60|$|She {{was only}} {{at a loss for}} plate, which she gave me a whisper of; and I made Amy fetch a large <b>strong-box,</b> which I had lodged in a safe hand, in which was all the fine plate which I had {{provided}} on a worse occasion, as is mentioned before; and I put it into the Quaker's hand, obliging her not to use it as mine, but as her own, for a reason I shall mention presently.|$|E
60|$|He {{introduced}} me to a broker, who took me into a back office, opened a <b>strong-box,</b> took out a small packet, and, untying it, poured out a tumblerful of diamonds! They ranged from {{the size of a}} pin-head to that of a bean, and were varied in shade, from pure crystal to straw-colour. The broker then opened one or two separate parcels, each of which contained a specially large or fine diamond, varying in size from a pea to a hazelnut.|$|E
60|$|It was {{difficult}} to imagine that he was drawing information from them, so bantering and frivolous was his manner; more difficult still to conceive that he had obtained any. Yet you will observe {{that he had been}} placed in possession of two facts: that the plans of the lines of Torres Vedras were kept locked up in Sir Terence's own room--in the <b>strong-box,</b> no doubt--and that Sir Terence always carried the key on a gold chain worn round his neck.|$|E
60|$|And the fore-top {{being just}} over the open {{forecastle}} scuttle, the dame could look right down upon us; hence our proceedings were plainly revealed by the lights that we carried. Upon our breaking open her <b>strong-box,</b> her indignation almost completely overmastered her fears. Unhooking a top-block, down it came into the forecastle, charitably commissioned with the demolition of Jarl's cocoa-nut, then more exposed to the view of an aerial observer than my own. But of it turned out, no harm was done to our porcelain.|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear Sir Charles Tregellis," [...] it ran, [...] "it {{will ever}} be a subject of regret {{to me that the}} force of {{circumstances}} should have compelled me to leave your service in so abrupt a fashion, but something occurred during our journey from Friar's Oak to Brighton which left me without any possible alternative. I trust, however, that my absence may prove to be but a temporary one. The isinglass recipe for the shirt-fronts is in the <b>strong-box</b> at Drummond's Bank.--Yours obediently, AMBROSE." ...|$|E
60|$|As it chanced {{she found}} the holy father in a very ill humour. It {{appeared}} that Morella also was in a bad humour with Henriques, having heard that {{it was he who}} had possessed himself of the jewels in his <b>strong-box</b> on the San Antonio. Now he insisted upon his surrendering everything, and swore, moreover, that he would hold him responsible for all that his people had stolen from the ship, and this because he said that it was his fault that Peter Brome had escaped the sea and come on to Granada.|$|E
60|$|But, upon Nigel insisting {{upon his}} {{commands}} being obeyed, and adding, {{that it was}} for the purpose of putting the lady ashore, the waterman declared that he would rather have her room than her company, and put the wherry alongside the wharf accordingly. Here two of the porters, who ply in such places, were easily induced to undertake the charge of the ponderous <b>strong-box,</b> {{and at the same time}} to guide the owner to the well-known mansion of John Christie, with whom all who lived in that neighbourhood were perfectly acquainted.|$|E
