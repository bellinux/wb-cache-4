40|$|Abstract: Individual tree mapping in {{the forest}} is usually done by several {{techniques}} such as the sequential target and point origin mapping. Generally, the estimation of <b>standing</b> timber <b>volume</b> operation is considered a difficult task as ground survey is expensive. Most of this task is being done {{on the ground and}} {{takes a lot of time}} to be accomplished. However, the use of airborne remote sensing such as the UPM-APSB’s Airborne Imaging Spectrometers for Applications (AISA) that plays its part in Global Positioning System (GPS) could change the way on how tree mapping and <b>standing</b> timber <b>volume</b> estimation are done. The general objective of this study is to map the individual wild A. mangium trees and estimate their <b>standing</b> timber <b>volume</b> using the airborne hyperspectral imaging technique. The specific objectives were to assess the capability of UPM-APSB’s AISA airborne hyperspectral data in mapping A. mangium plantation and estimate its <b>standing</b> timber <b>volume</b> by delineating the individual trees crown areas. The hyperspectral image of A. mangium plan-tation in Lebuh Silikon, UPM in ENVI (. img) format taken on February 2004 was enhanced using the ENVI software. The age of the A. mangium stand was about 30 years old. Results indicated the presence of 29 canopies of A. mangium trees over a 0. 8 ha plot. A single crown or canopy represented a single tree. A set of simple linear regression model for predicting volume from the crown area was developed using the 29 samples of tree crown. The value for r was 0. 801 for this fit of the model, which showed 80. 1 % erratum data could be evaded. The equation developed in this study was V = 0. 1045 + 0. 0111 (CA) where it provided a mean for predicting volume from the crown size measurement using the air...|$|R

In Diepholz, coming from a low level, all management paths result in an increase of <b>standing</b> <b>volume</b> over time with the reference and biodiversity runs almost identical. In Uelzen, the biodiversity strategy yields a steady increase in <b>standing</b> <b>volume.</b> Under the reference path, volume increases until 2030 and afterwards shows a reduction below the initial value in 2070. <b>Standing</b> <b>volume</b> under the climate protection strategy drops continuously to an overall minimum of 173 m 3 ∙ha− 1 in 2055. In the Oder-Spree region under the reference management strategy, the <b>standing</b> <b>volume</b> is almost constant until 2030 and decreases steadily afterwards. The climate protection path reduces <b>standing</b> <b>volume</b> considerably at the beginning and volume accumulates from 2055 on to reach almost the same value as under the reference path in 2070.

Additionally, field experiments at two sites were used. The influence of overstorey density on height growth was established using one of the sites that measured height increments of seedlings, saplings, and small trees in the plots.

40|$|The {{assessment}} of the current annual increment of forest <b>standing</b> <b>volume</b> (CAI) is a fundamental tool to support forest management and planning. A suitable approach to such an end is to rely on growth and yield models. However, this kind of models are often not available for many countries and/or locations and/or species. Furthermore, they may become obsolete due to potential changes in the environmental and silvicultural conditions. Such shortcomings may be distinctively detrimental {{in the context of}} forest inventories. Several methods have been proposed to inventory CAI on one single occasion, i. e., when repeated measurements of <b>standing</b> <b>volume</b> are not available. A wellknown family of methods, still largely exploited in Alpine and Eastern European countries, derives from the estimation of the percentage current annual increment of forest <b>standing</b> <b>volume</b> by the current annual increments of stem diameter and tree height (Δh). In this study an experimental comparison of Δh assessment by three different approaches is presented with reference to a properly designed case study: (i) Δh is measured on felled trees; (ii) Δh is estimated by dynamic height curve (i. e., diameter-height-age model); (iii) Δh is estimated by conventional height curve (i. e., diameter-height model). Under the examined experimental conditions (a pure forest of silver fir on highly fertile soils in southern Italy, aged around 60 years), both simplified approaches (ii) and (iii) have proven to underestimate height increments, with a larger underestimation by the approach based on the conventional height curve. However, the consequent error in the estimation of percentage current annual increment of forest <b>standing</b> <b>volume</b> has proved to be quite limited (4 % for the approach based on the dynamic height curve and around 9 % for the approach based on the conventional height curve). Hence, such simplified approaches may be rather safely considered for estimating percentage current annual increment of forest <b>standing</b> <b>volume</b> when neither Δh is directly detectable on standing trees nor sample trees can be felled, nor an appropriate model to predict Δh is available. The Δh estimation on the conventional height curve should turn out to be even more suitable in the case of uneven-aged stands, where the position of the height curve remains stationary over time.

40|$|Grand fir (Abies grandis (Douglas ex D. Don) Lindley) {{is widely}} {{distributed}} in the moist forests of the Inland Northwest. It has high potential productivity, its growth being nearly equal to western white pine, the most productive species in the region. There are large <b>standing</b> <b>volumes</b> of grand fir in the region. Nutritionally, the species has higher foliage cation concentrations than associated conifers, especially potassium (K) and calcium (Ca). In contrast, it has lower nitrogen (N) foliage concentrations, which creates favorable nutrient balance on N-limited sites. Despite concentration differences, grand fir stores proportionally more nutrients per tree than associated species because of greater crown biomass. Although few fertilization trials have examined grand fir specifically, its response is inferred from its occurrence in many monitored mixed conifer stands. Fertilization trials including grand fir either as a major or minor component show {{that it has a}} strong diameter and height growth response ranging from 15 % to 50 % depending in part on site moisture availability and soil geology.
