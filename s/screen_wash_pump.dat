40|$|The paleoecology and depositional {{history of}} an early Eocene {{vertebrate}} assemblage dominated by small mammals is analyzed at a richly fossiliferous locality in the Willwood Formation, northwestern Wyoming. Systematic surface sampling using a quadrat net, <b>screen</b> <b>washing,</b> and quarrying of fresh sediment show that all vertebrate material in these fluvial deposits is contained in dark gray mudstones representing the A horizons of paleosols. Seven such paleosols occur in 22 m of stratigraphic section. The fauna includes 34 species of mammals, and also birds, reptiles, amphibians, fishes and gastropods. All vertebrate fossil material is fragmented, but it shows no evidence of transportation or current sorting. Surface weathering and possibly carnivore activity {{are responsible for the}} fragmentation and for an overabundance of dense and compact skeletal elements. Detailed surface collections were made to obtain multiple samples from the different bone beds (paleosols). Principle component analysis shows that differences in the type and abundance of fossils from the various collecting areas are related to differences between contained bone beds, not differences along single bone beds. One paleosol has a red B horizon and six have an orange B horizon. The gray-over-red colored paleosol is faunally distinct from gray-over-orange paleosols. It contains the only specimens of two large, archaic mammals, and no very small mammalian taxa. Cluster analysis on the occurrence of vertebrate taxa is used to define subsets of the fauna that may represent animals living in different habitats. Separate clusters are formed by a group of the most common terrestrial herbivorous mammals and the crocodilian Allognathosuchus, and by a group of small, possibly arboreal herbivores and carnivores. The relative abundance of each mammalian species was initially calculated from a sample representing a minimum of 300 individual animals collected from the surface. The surface sample is dominated by mammals that are medium-sized for the fauna. <b>Screen</b> <b>washing</b> yields a greater relative abundance of very small mammals than was found on the surface. This indicates that the surface sample is biased against small forms. Corrected relative abundances based on both surface and washing samples show that the fauna is dominated numerically by very small mammals (one multituberculate species and several insectivores). <b>Screen</b> <b>washing</b> of fresh matrix is the best means of sampling a locality for paleoecological purposes...|$|R

40|$|Medium {{consumption}} {{is a significant}} component {{of the cost of}} operating a dense medium plant. This study aimed to identify and quantify many of the factors contributing to overall consumption, through extensive surveys of four widely differing dense medium mineral separation plants, and associated laboratory experiments. Particular attention was given to the effect of operating density on medium loss. It was concluded that quite modest increases in operating density significantly increased loss from all sources. Density should therefore be minimised, commensurate with process requirements. There is also unequivocal evidence that consumption increases significantly with plant downtime, probably due to housekeeping wastage and overloading of regeneration circuits during the return of dumped medium to circuit. Other conclusions related to the effects of feedrate, ore porosity, medium viscosity, <b>screen</b> <b>washing</b> configuration, <b>screen</b> drainage efficiency and medium size on medium loss.

40|$|The {{impact to}} the fishery of Navigation Pool No. 9 of the Mississippi River from {{impingement}} and entrainment processes by two Dairyland Power Cooperative power stations in Genoa, Wisconsin, was determined. Impingement samples were taken once each {{week for a}} 24 hour period from 8 August 1978 through 30 June 1980 at both plants. Sampling devices, comprised of galvanized hardware cloth, were used to strain <b>screen</b> <b>wash</b> water to determine impingement rates. Entrainment sampling was conducted once each week for a 24 hour period from 26 February 1979 through 10 September 1979 and 6 February 1980 through 30 June 1980. Entrainment rates were determined by straining water from tapped intake pipes with plankton nets. Impingement survival tests, stress tests, and ichthyoplankton surveys were also taken to further define the impact of entrainment and impingement. An estimated 8, 390 (127. 1 kg) and 54, 349 (2915. 7 kg) fish were impinged during this study at La Crosse Boiling Water Reactor. (LACBWR) and Genoa # 3 (G- 3), respectively. The two power stations collectively impinged representatives of 53 species and 19 families of fish. The most frequently impinged species of fish were bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus), freshwater drum (Aplodinotus grunniens)., gizzard shad(Dorosoma cepedianum) and channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus). Young-of-the-year fish density, behavioral responses of some species of fish and intake structure design were determined {{to be the most}} influential factors causing impingement at these plants. The impact to the Pool 9 fishery from impingement by these two power stations was judged insignificant. Greater than 11 x 106 larval fish were entrained by G- 3 during this study. Freshwater drum and Morone sp. larvae were the most frequently entrained species of fish. Other larval fish taxa entrained were Dorosoma sp., Hiodon sp., Pomoxis sp., cyprinids and catostomids. The impact to the Pool 9 fishery from entrainment was probably insignificant {{with the possible exception of}} freshwater drum. Recommendations for modification of <b>screen</b> <b>washing</b> procedures and intake structures at the present plants were offered to the power company to reduce the impact of entrainment and impingement.

40|$|The {{fossil record}} of Cenozoic {{floodplain}} fishes increases from few {{species in the}} Paleocene and Eocene to about 5 - 15 species per locality in the Pliocene and Pleistocene. Modern floodplain habitats usually have more than 5 - 10 times this many species. The trend {{could be interpreted as}} an evolutionary increase, except that there seem to be no ecological or evolutionary reasons to expect ancient floodplains to have fewer species than modern floodplains. The alternate hypothesis is that ecological and fluvial processes destroy most fish bones before they are finally buried. Although floodplain depositional environments trap many fishes, these are subjected to extensive predation and scavenging, thereby reducing the opportunities for bones of small fishes, which make up most of the diversity, to be preserved in the fossil record. Abrasion in bedload probably destroys most small bones that are reworked. Surface collecting methods exaggerate the bias further because fish bones from fluvial rocks are fragmentary, difficult to discover, and difficult to identify. <b>Screen</b> <b>washing</b> for fossils from fine-grained sedimentary lenses should increase the known diversity from floodplain deposits...|$|R

This report extends some of these modelling ideas to include component distributions. For example, the fiber fraction can be treated as a distribution based on fiber length and possibly fiber coarseness and composition. The contaminant concentration is expressed as a function of both particle size and density of the contaminant. Finally, the separation efficiency of the processing steps also becomes a function of fiber and contaminant distributions. Ultimately, these models are used to determine the efficiency of various stock preparation systems with differing configurations of the cleaners, <b>screens,</b> <b>washing,</b> and other operations.
