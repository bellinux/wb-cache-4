40|$|The {{characteristics}} of unsteady flow in a dual-flowpath inlet, {{which was designed}} for a Turbine Based Combined Cycle (TBCC) propulsion system, and the control methods of unsteady flow were investigated experimentally and numerically. It was characterized by large-amplitude pressure oscillations and traveling shock waves. As the inlet operated in supercritical condition, namely the terminal shock located in the throat, the shock oscillated, and the period of oscillation was about 50 â¯ms, while the amplitude was 6 â¯mm. The <b>shock</b> <b>oscillation</b> was caused by separation in the diffuser. This <b>shock</b> <b>oscillation</b> can be controlled by extending the length of diffuser which reduces pressure gradient along the flowpath. As the inlet operated in critical condition, namely the terminal shock located at {{the shoulder of the}} third compression ramp, the shock oscillated, and the period of oscillation was about 7. 5 â¯ms, while the amplitude was 12 â¯mm. At this condition, the <b>shock</b> <b>oscillation</b> was caused by an incompatible backpressure in the bleed region. It can be controlled by increasing the backpressure of the bleed region.

40|$|We {{simulate}} shock-free {{and shocked}} viscous accretion flow onto {{a black hole}} in a two dimensional cylindrical geometry, where initial conditions were chosen from analytical solutions. The simulation code used the Lagrangian Total Variation Diminishing (LTVD) and remap routine, which enabled us to attain high accuracy in capturing shocks and to handle the angular momentum distribution correctly. Inviscid shock-free accretion disk solution produced a thick disk structure, while the viscous shock-free solution attained a Bondi-like structure, but in either case, no jet activity nor any QPO-like activity developed. The steady state shocked solution in the inviscid, as well as, in the viscous regime, matched theoretical predictions well. However, increasing viscosity renders the accretion shock unstable. Large amplitude <b>shock</b> <b>oscillation</b> is accompanied by intermittent, transient inner multiple shocks. Such oscillation of the inner part of disk is interpreted {{as the source of}} QPO in hard X-rays observed in micro-quasars. Strong <b>shock</b> <b>oscillation</b> induces strong episodic jet emission. The jets also showed existence of shocks, which are produced as one shell hits the preceding one. The periodicity of jets and <b>shock</b> <b>oscillation</b> were similar. The jets for higher viscosity parameter are evidently stronger and faster. Comment: 24 pages, 18 figures.

The phasing of the oscillations is such that the interior oscillatory field within the magnetospheric “core” region (magnetic shells with equatorial crossing distances less than ∼ 15 Saturn radii) is rotated ∼ 130 °– 160 ° counterclockwise (as viewed from the north) of the instantaneous location of outward boundary excursion maxima.
