40|$|This report {{documents}} a {{new study}} of public opinion about <b>self-driving</b> <b>vehicles</b> in China, India, and Japan. The survey yielded completed responses from 610 respondents in China, 527 respondents in India, and 585 respondents in Japan. For comparison, the report also includes recently released findings from the same survey in the U. S., the U. K., and Australia. The main findings (applicable {{to each of the}} six countries) are as follows: The majority of respondents had previously heard of autonomous or <b>self-driving</b> <b>vehicles,</b> had a positive initial opinion of the technology (or neutral in the case of Japan), and had high expectations about the benefits of the technology. However, the majority of respondents expressed high levels of concern about riding in selfdriving vehicles, safety issues related to equipment or system failure, and <b>self-driving</b> <b>vehicles</b> not performing as well as human drivers. Respondents also expressed high levels of concern about vehicles without driver controls; selfdriving vehicles moving while unoccupied; and <b>self-driving</b> commercial <b>vehicles,</b> buses, and taxis. The majority of respondents expressed a desire to have this technology in their vehicles. However, a majority was also unwilling to pay extra for the technology (except for respondents in China and India). In comparison to the respondents in the U. S., the U. K., and Australia, respondents in China and India had more positive initial opinions of <b>self-driving</b> <b>vehicles,</b> expressed greater interest in having such technology on their personal vehicles, and were willing to pay the most for it. Japanese respondents, on the other hand, generally had more neutral initial opinions about self-driving technology and were willing to pay the least for it. The main implications of these results are that the respondents in the six countries surveyed, while expressing high levels of concern about riding in vehicles equipped with this technology, mostly feel positive about <b>self-driving</b> <b>vehicles,</b> have optimistic expectations of the benefits, and generally desire self-driving-vehicle technology (though a majority in four out of the six countries surveyed are not willing to pay extra for such technology at this time) ...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the past}} several decades, {{research}} efforts {{in the development of}} <b>self-driving</b> <b>vehicles</b> have drastically improved accompanying technologies. Since the challenges held by Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, the autonomous driving industry has increased significantly, and almost all the automotive companies have started to develop the technologies to deploy autonomous driving vehicles in the real world. Even though a lot of companies have been making efforts to achieve fully automated vehicles, the current technologies are not mature enough to be deployed in the real world yet, because <b>self-driving</b> <b>vehicles</b> need to respond to uncontrolled environments, such as moving objects, pedestrians, traffic lights, and unexpected work-zones. Among these uncontrolled environments, this thesis focuses on understanding road information and estimating states of traffic lights. Given that all of the traffic control devices are regularized in colors, color {{is one of the most}} significant features to be recognized. In order to accomplish such necessary a vision task, <b>self-driving</b> <b>vehicles</b> must incorporate cameras. Despite the fact that traffic control devices have their own regularized color and cameras can see those devices, they are still difficult to detect and recognize by autonomous vehicles. One of the biggest problems is that the color of those devices can be captured differently based on illumination. In this thesis, we investigate the problem of recognizing static objects using a monocular camera to assist <b>self-driving</b> <b>vehicles</b> in perceiving traffic control devices. The perception system, specifically a camera, should recognize the objects robustly regardless of the environment. Throughout this thesis, we exploit different color spaces and apply machine learning to reduce color variance. Also, we develop algorithms which compensate for illumination changes by considering the Sun position, to further improve the road sign recognition. Furthermore, we improve a traffic light state estimation which performs robustly under various illumination conditions. We deploy and demonstrate all of the algorithms in an autonomous vehicle...|$|R
40|$|Advancements in computing, {{electronics}} and mechanical systems {{have resulted in}} the creation of a new class of vehicles called autonomous vehicles. These vehicles function using sensory input with an on-board computation system. <b>Self-driving</b> <b>vehicles</b> use an ad hoc vehicular network called VANET. The network has ad hoc infrastructure with mobile vehicles that communicate through open wireless channels. This thesis studies the design and implementation of a novel intelligent intrusion detection system which secures the external communication of <b>self-driving</b> <b>vehicles.</b> This thesis makes the following four contributions: It proposes a hybrid intrusion detection system to protect the external communication in <b>self-driving</b> <b>vehicles</b> from potential attacks. This has been achieved using fuzzification and artificial intelligence. The second contribution is the incorporation of the Integrated Circuit Metrics (ICMetrics) for improved security and privacy. By using the ICMetrics, specific device features have been used to create a unique identity for vehicles. Our work is based on using the bias in on board sensory systems to create ICMetrics for <b>self-driving</b> <b>vehicles.</b> The incorporation of fuzzy petri net in autonomous vehicles is the third contribution of the thesis. Simulation results show that the scheme can successfully detect denial-of-service attacks. The design of a clustering based hierarchical detection system has also been presented to detect worm hole and Sybil attacks. The final contribution of this research is an integrated intrusion detection system which detects various attacks by using a central database in BusNet. The proposed schemes have been simulated using the data extracted from trace files. Simulation results have been compared and studied for high levels of detection capability and performance. Analysis shows that the proposed schemes provide high detection rate with a low rate of false alarm. The system can detect various attacks in an optimised way owing to a reduction in the number of features, fuzzification...|$|R

40|$|The {{concept of}} the <b>self-driving</b> <b>vehicle</b> has been elusively {{speaking}} to our imaginations for the past decades through advertisements and popular culture. After always being seemingly at the horizon of a utopian near future, the technology suddenly became very real with Google’s blogpost {{on the morning of}} October 9 2010. Since then, just about every automotive designer such as Mercedes, Hyundai, and Tesla Motors have jumped on the technological bandwagon of developing its own self-driving vehicles. For this research on the representation of human-technological relations in <b>self-driving</b> <b>vehicle</b> advertisements, I have established a theoretical framework consisting of the works of the philosophers Martin Heidegger, Don Ihde, and Peter-Paul Verbeek under the ontological notion of postphenomenology, which have allowed me to interpret how the relations between humans and self-driving vehicles are constructed. In order to analyze how these relations are represented and conveyed to the viewer of the advertisements, through linguistics and intertextual relations, I have drawn upon parts of Norman Fairclough’s CDA model. I have focused on the framework’s dimensions of textual analysis by analyzing the corpus’ use of interactional control, interdiscursivity, cohesion, wording, and metaphors. Self-driving or driver-assisted technologies are represented as having the capability of being of great value in everyday life and traffic in terms of safety and mobility, with the added bonus of creating time for the driver to spend on other things. Currently, in a somewhat symbiotic relationship, the acting capability is represented as being capable of switching back and forth between human and technology as, during the drive, the human driver can prompt technology to take command, prompt technology to return to manual driving, or technology can prompt the human driver to take over the wheel during technical difficulties or when nearing the end of the destination. In a more distant future, the <b>self-driving</b> <b>vehicle</b> is represented as capable of delegating and interpreting all human actions in traffic, thus being able to replace the human driver entirely (and taking human driver error out of the equation). Generally speaking, the <b>self-driving</b> <b>vehicle</b> is represented as a tool for transportation to be used by human drivers for their convenience whenever they see fit during a journey. This usefulness is lost when the human driver is no longer inside the vehicle. However, unlike a traditional car, the <b>self-driving</b> <b>vehicle</b> will be able to be prompted to find itself a parking space and be hailed to a person’s current location, saving additional time. Automotive designers frame autonomous driving technologies by projecting ‘utopian’ connotations of increased safety, mobility, and freedom onto them in their advertisements. With their financial stake in mind, their biased advertisements – which only show optimal conditions for showcasing the technologies...|$|E
40|$|<b>Self-driving</b> <b>vehicles</b> have {{attracted}} {{a lot of}} interest due to their potential to significantly reduce traffic fatalities and transform people's lives. The reducing costs of advanced sensing technologies and the increasing capabilities of embedded computing hardware have enabled the commercialization of highly automated driving features. However, the reliable operation of autonomous vehicles is still a challenge and a major barrier in the large scale acceptance and deployment of the technology. This dissertation focuses on the challenges of designing safe control strategies for <b>self-driving</b> <b>vehicles</b> due to the presence of uncertainty arising from the non-deterministic forecasts of the driving scene. The overall goal is to unify elements from the fields of vehicle dynamics modeling, machine learning, real-time optimization and control design under uncertainty to enable the safe operation of <b>self-driving</b> <b>vehicles.</b> We propose a systematic framework based on Model Predictive Control (MPC) for the controller design, the effectiveness of which is demonstrated via applications such as lateral stability control, autonomous cruise control and autonomous overtaking on highways. Data collected from our experimental vehicles is used to build predictive models of the vehicle and the environment, and characterize the uncertainty therein. Several approaches for the control design are presented based on a worst-case or probabilistic view of the uncertain forecasts, depending on the application. The proposed control methodologies are validated by experiments performed on prototype passenger vehicles and are executed in real-time on embedded hardware with limited computational power. The experiments show the ability of the proposed framework to handle a variety of driving scenarios including aggressive maneuvers on low-friction surfaces such as snow and navigation in the presence of multiple vehicles...|$|R

40|$|Vehicles are {{increasingly}} equipped with systems that take over (elements of) the driving task. Eventually, this {{is expected to}} result in fully <b>self-driving</b> <b>vehicles.</b> The human role will shift from driver to supervisor, and ultimately to passenger. These systems are assumed {{to reduce the risk}} of human error and consequently to increase safety. At the same time, human factors will still influence the systems. After all, in the role of supervisor, human intervention is still necessary when the system requires it or in the case of system failure. Furthermore, it is still unclear how other road users will react to new systems. To stimulate innovations concerning <b>self-driving</b> <b>vehicles,</b> the Netherlands facilitates the testing of <b>self-driving</b> <b>vehicles</b> on public roads. As road safety is the main prerequisite, the Ministry of Infrastructure and the Environment asked SWOV Institute for Road Safety Research for advice on how to carry out field trials with <b>self-driving</b> <b>vehicles</b> in the safest possible way. The Ministry of Infrastructure and the Environment has drawn up the Procedure for testing <b>self-driving</b> <b>vehicles</b> on public roads in the Netherlands. This procedure is used as a guideline when filing a request for an exemption to allow field trials on public roads. The procedure (Figure 1) consists of three closely interrelated components: vehicle, road and human (behaviour). RDW, the Dutch Vehicle Authority, coordinates the permission for a field trial. RDW is also responsible for the vehicle component. The road authorities or CROW Taskforce Dutch Roads are responsible for the road component, and SWOV is responsible for the (human) behaviour component. The test procedure has been designed in such a way that improvements can be made based on the experience gained in each trial. The test procedure is therefore continuously being developed. To structure the safety advice on human behaviour, SWOV has developed a ‘Risk matrix’, describing potential risks of a field trial with (partially) <b>self-driving</b> <b>vehicles.</b> The Risk matrix is based on literature and expert knowledge. 1 It identifies potential risks involved in field trials and how they can be — or already have been — mitigated. The Risk matrix is presented on the following pages. Its first dimension maps a number of risks in the following categories: 1. Risks due to the interaction with the system/vehicle; 2. Risks due to the interaction with other road users; 3. Risks due to the location and moment of the trial; the route and the place on the road are important considerations; 4. General risks due to project management. The risks are (co-) determined by the level of automation of the system and the role (still) played by the driver. The second dimension of the matrix thus distinguishes three levels of automation: a. Partial automation — driver is active At this level, the system temporarily takes over (elements of) the driving task — either steering or accelerating/braking. The driver performs all other dynamic driving tasks, such as monitoring the driving environment and the system. The driver functions as a fall back and needs to detect when action is necessary. b. Conditional automation — driver is important The driving task is performed by the system. The driver performs the other dynamic driving tasks: monitoring the driving environment and acting as a fall back if this is indicated by the system. The driver now performs the role of supervisor. c. Full automation — driver is not important The system takes over all driving tasks, monitors the driving environment as well as the system itself. The system detects if it is necessary to take action. The driver plays no active role in this vehicle and has now become a passenger. In some cases a remote operator will monitor the vehicle and the environment...|$|R
