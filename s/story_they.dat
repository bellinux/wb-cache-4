5|$|Cagney made a rare TV {{appearance}} in the lead role of the movie Terrible Joe Moran in 1984. This was his last role. Cagney's health was fragile and more strokes had confined him to a wheelchair, but the producers worked his real-life mobility problem into the <b>story.</b> <b>They</b> also decided to dub his impaired speech, using the impersonator Rich Little. The film made use of fight clips from Cagney's boxing movie Winner Take All (1932), {{despite the fact that}} the TV movie is about an entirely different character.|$|E
5|$|Development {{began in}} 2010, soon after id Software gave MachineGames the {{rights for the}} franchise. The {{development}} team envisioned Wolfenstein: The New Order as a first-person action-adventure game, taking inspiration from previous games in the series and particularly focusing on the combat and adventure elements. The game attempts to delve into character development of Blazkowicz, unlike its predecessors—a choice from the developers to interest players in the <b>story.</b> <b>They</b> also aimed to portray him in a heroic fashion.|$|E
5|$|In 1980, Michael Howell and Peter Ford {{published}} The True History of the Elephant Man, {{presenting the}} fruits of their detailed archival research. Howell and Ford brought to light a large amount of new information about Merrick. In addition to proving that his name was Joseph, not John, they were able to describe in more detail his life <b>story.</b> <b>They</b> refuted some of the inaccuracies in Treves's account, showing that Merrick's mother did not abandon him, and that Merrick deliberately chose to exhibit himself to make a living.|$|E

5|$|Though the {{producers}} decided that Friday the 13th {{would not be}} an origin <b>story,</b> <b>they</b> said that they wanted to work out a logical origin story for Jason that would provide a sense of history as the film progressed. Form and Fuller explained that the audience gets to see how Jason attains his famous hockey mask, and is given a reason for why he puts it on. Jason would transition from wearing a bag over his head—similar to the one seen in Friday the 13th Part 2—to finding and wearing his hockey mask, whereas in Friday the 13th Part III he obtains the mask off-screen and comes out of a barn already wearing it.|$|E
5|$|When {{thinking}} {{of how to}} end the first season, two things were clear to Alfred Gough and Miles Millar: the final episode would have the school prom, {{and there would be}} tornadoes. Although Jeph Loeb's Superman For All Seasons, which inspired Gough and Millar when they created the show, contains an event where a tornado hits Smallville, the pair insist that the tornado idea came from a <b>story</b> <b>they</b> overheard on the radio about a tornado that hit a high school during their prom night. The episode would mark the departure of Eric Johnson as series star Whitney Fordman, though he would return as a special guest in seasons two and four.|$|E

5|$|Birds roam {{from the}} forest floor to the canopy, but {{particularly}} favour the middle <b>story.</b> <b>They</b> mostly operate alone, in pairs or groups of three, and {{can also be found}} mixing with long-billed bernierias. Larger flocks do not occur. The nelicourvi weaver is an agile, active species that generally makes a lot of noise. It searches for insects on leaves, and branches, while hanging from vines and twigs. It looks for animals in rolled leaves such as wild ginger Aframomum and along leaf litter, probing crevices, and opening dead stems. It also dismembers flowers to reach the nectar. Mostly, arthropods (beetles, bugs, butterflies, caterpillars, dragonflies, flies, grasshoppers, leafhoppers, stick insects, millipedes and spiders) are consumed, sometimes small vertebrates (lizards and chameleons), next to some nectar, fruit and probably seeds.|$|E
5|$|For the {{hand-held}} camera footage, Soderbergh used Panavision Millennium XLs {{that were}} smaller and lighter than previous cameras and {{allowed him to}} move freely. In order to tell the three stories apart, he adopted a distinctive look for each. For Robert Wakefield's story, Soderbergh used tungsten film with no filter for a cold, monochrome blue feel. For Helena Ayala's story, Soderbergh used diffusion filters, flashing the film, overexposing it for a warmer feel. For Javier Rodriguez's story, the director used tobacco filters and a 45-degree shutter angle whenever possible to produce a strobe-like sharp feel. Then, he took the entire film through an Ektachrome step, which increased the contrast and grain significantly. He wanted to have different looks for each story because the audience had {{to keep track of}} many characters and absorb a lot of information and he did not want them to have to figure out which <b>story</b> <b>they</b> were watching.|$|E
5|$|In Japan, A Town Where You Live manga volumes {{frequently}} {{appeared on}} weekly sales charts during their week of release. Jason Thompson praised A Town Where You Lives serious, mature tone and {{wrote that the}} audiences will either like the series for its realism or criticize it as slow and mundane. Manga-News praised the series' introduction for being more realistic than the author's previous work, Suzuka, and the plot which was described as eventful. In later volumes, Manga-News criticized the plot for being predictable, encompassing cliché aspects of the genre, and for dragging its <b>story.</b> <b>They</b> also panned the characters' behavior, calling it implausible and inconsistent. Manga-News returned to positive reviews during the volumes involving Kyousuke Kazama; they praised the story arc for introducing a new setting, for breaking away from the usual classicism, and for surprising the readers {{for the first time}} in the series. Following this, Manga-News returned to negative reviews, echoing their previous points. AnimeLand had similar reactions. Initially, they were positive, praising the realistic protagonist, but further reviews repeated Manga-News' criticisms.|$|E

5|$|Studio Ghibli's Yoshiyuki Momose {{served as}} the {{director}} of animation, drawing character designs and storyboards. Hino wished Dominion of the Dark Djinn and Wrath of the White Witch to have a heartwarming feel; the artwork and character movements was greatly inspired by Studio Ghibli's work, particularly due to their attention to detail, as well as their talent in creating storyboards and utilizing camera control. The development team constantly watched Studio Ghibli's films during development. The team wanted the theme of the game to resonate with children; they initially considered the idea of expressing adventure and dreams. They later explored the concept of a child's greatest influence, their mother, and the possibility of losing them. The game's main playable character, Oliver, is a 13-year-old boy. The team decided to make him a child as they wished to showcase a coming of age <b>story.</b> <b>They</b> wanted children to empathize with Oliver's development, and adults to relive the excitement of their adolescence.|$|E
5|$|The Mountain Eagle is {{the only}} feature film {{directed}} by Hitchcock that is considered a lost film, meaning that no prints of the film are known to exist. Six surviving stills are reproduced in François Truffaut's book. More stills have recently been found to exist, {{many of which are}} reproduced in Dan Auiler's book. A lobby card for the film was found in a box of broken frames at a flea market in Rowley, Massachusetts. In 2012, a set of 24 still photographs were found in an archive of one of Hitchcock's close friends. Although these images gave clues to the film and its <b>story,</b> <b>they</b> were taken on the set rather than being stills from the film itself. They were auctioned off in Los Angeles for $6,000 (£3,700). Hitchcock's notebooks were also found, documenting his journey to Obergurgl, by train, horse and cart, and by foot.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea for}} Atlantis: The Lost Empire was {{conceived}} in October 1996 when Don Hahn, Gary Trousdale, Kirk Wise, and Tab Murphy lunched at a Mexican restaurant in Burbank, California. Having recently completed The Hunchback of Notre Dame the producer and directors {{wanted to keep}} the Hunchback crew together for another film with an Adventureland setting. Drawing inspiration from Jules Verne's A Journey to the Center of the Earth (1864), they set out to make a film which would fully explore Atlantis (compared to the brief visit depicted in Verne's novel). While primarily utilizing the Internet to research the mythology of Atlantis, the filmmakers became interested in the clairvoyant readings of Edgar Cayce and decided to incorporate some of his ideas—notably that of a mother-crystal which provides power, healing, and longevity to the Atlanteans—into the <b>story.</b> <b>They</b> also visited museums and old army installations to study the technology of the early 20th century (the film's time period), and traveled 800feet underground in New Mexico's Carlsbad Caverns to view the subterranean trails which would {{serve as a model for}} the approach to Atlantis in the film.|$|E
