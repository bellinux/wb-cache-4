5|$|In {{more general}} usage, noise is any {{unwanted}} sound or signal. In this sense, even sounds {{that would be}} perceived as musically ordinary in another context become noise if they interfere with the reception of a message desired by the receiver. Prevention and reduction of unwanted sound, from tape hiss to <b>squeaking</b> bass drum pedals, is important in many musical pursuits, but noise is also used creatively in many ways, and in some way in nearly all genres.|$|E
5|$|The blue-faced honeyeater {{produces}} {{a variety of}} calls, including a piping call around {{half an hour before}} dawn, variously described as ki-owt, woik, queet, peet, or weet. Through the day, it makes <b>squeaking</b> noises while flying, and harsh squawks when mobbing. Its calls have been likened to those of the yellow-throated miner (Manorina flavigula), but are deeper. Blue-faced honeyeaters make a soft chirping around nestlings and family members.|$|E

50|$|The second issue, <b>Squeak</b> the Mouse 2, {{begins with}} a duck who revives <b>Squeak</b> {{from the pages of}} the first <b>Squeak</b> the Mouse comic book. <b>Squeak</b> {{proceeds}} to read his own comic, and is horrified by his own murder, and decides to track down the cat and murder him. However, when <b>Squeak</b> confronts the cat at a screening of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2, the cat tricks <b>Squeak</b> into feeling sympathy for him, which allows the cat to briefly escape before being murdered by the mouse. As <b>Squeak</b> boards a plane heading to a tropical island, the cat returns as a zombie and crashes the plane, killing all of the passengers except <b>Squeak,</b> who escapes, and swims to the nearest island, where a pair of women awaken him by performing oral sex on <b>Squeak,</b> leading to another orgy sequence. The cat turns up on the island and slaughters the women, and <b>Squeak</b> destroys the cat, leaving only its separated bones, which are found by a horror film-loving child, who brings the remains home and reassembles them. The skeleton cat slaughters the child and his family, and once again goes after <b>Squeak,</b> who finally gets rid of the cat for good, but decides to antagonize another cat.|$|R

5|$|Following {{the final}} orchestral crescendo, the song ends {{with one of}} the most famous final chords in music history. Overdubbed in place of the vocal {{experiment}} from 10 February, this chord was added during a session at EMI's Studio Two on 22 February. Lennon, McCartney, Starr and Evans shared three different pianos, with Martin on a harmonium, and all played an E-major chord simultaneously. The chord was made to ring out for over forty seconds by increasing the recording sound level as the vibration faded out. Towards the end of the chord the recording level was so high that listeners can hear the sounds of the studio, including rustling papers and a <b>squeaking</b> chair.|$|E
5|$|In the wild, {{little brown}} bats {{can be very}} active during {{the day in the}} spring months, where they can be heard loudly <b>squeaking,</b> {{shuffling}} position and seen hanging out the bottom of the bat house during all hours of the daytime. The average sleep time of a little brown bat in captivity is said to be 19.9 hours per day. This long period of sleep is thought to be a way of conserving energy, by only hunting for a few hours each night when their insect prey are available.|$|E
5|$|Some species use {{vibrations}} {{for communicating}} within {{members of the}} same species, such as to attract mates as in the songs of the shield bug Nezara viridula. Vibrations {{can also be used to}} communicate between entirely different species; lycaenid (gossamer-winged butterfly) caterpillars, which are myrmecophilous (living in a mutualistic association with ants) communicate with ants in this way. The Madagascar hissing cockroach has the ability to press air through its spiracles to make a hissing noise as a sign of aggression; the death's-head hawkmoth makes a <b>squeaking</b> noise by forcing air out of their pharynx when agitated, which may also reduce aggressive worker honey bee behavior when the two are in close proximity.|$|E

5|$|Unlike {{that of the}} pied currawong, {{the grey}} currawong's call does not sound like its name. It {{is best known for}} making a sound {{variously}} transcribed as p'rink, clink, cling, ker-link or tullock, either in flight or when gathered in any numbers. The call has been described as very loud and ringing in the Tasmanian and Kangaroo Island subspecies; Edwin Ashby wrote that in Tasmania it was akin to the <b>squeaking</b> of a wheelbarrow and Gregory Mathews that it was like the kling of an anvil. Elsewhere, their call has been likened to the screech of ungreased metal grinding in Victoria and South Australia (races versicolor and melanoptera are noted as similar to each other), and as a harsh squeak in Western Australia. The clinking call resembles that of the superb lyrebird, which imitates the currawong call at times.|$|E
5|$|The male's song {{is a rich}} musical warbling, often {{ending in}} a loud high-pitched crescendo, which is given in bursts of up to 30seconds. The song is {{repeated}} for about two-and-a-half minutes, with a short pause before each repetition. In some geographically isolated areas, such as islands, peninsulas and valleys in the Alps, a simplified fluting song occurs, named the Leiern (drawling) song by the German ornithologists who first described it. The song's introduction is like that of other blackcaps, but the final warbling part is a simple alternation between two notes, as in a great tit's call but more fluting. The main song is confusable {{with that of the}} garden warbler, but it is slightly higher pitched than in that species, more broken into discrete song segments, and less mellow. Both species have a quiet subsong, a muted version of the full song, which is even more difficult to separate. The blackcap occasionally mimics the song of other birds, the most frequently copied including the garden warbler and the common nightingale. The main call is a hard tac-tac, like stones knocking together, and other vocalisations include a <b>squeaking</b> sweet alarm, and a low-pitched trill similar to that of a garden warbler.|$|E

25|$|Depictions of rats {{in fiction}} are {{historically}} inaccurate and negative. The most common falsehood is the <b>squeaking</b> almost always heard in otherwise realistic portrayals (i.e. nonanthropomorphic). While the recordings {{may be of}} actual <b>squeaking</b> rats, the noise is uncommon – they may do so only if distressed, hurt, or annoyed. Normal vocalizations are very high-pitched, well outside the range of human hearing. Rats are also often cast in vicious and aggressive roles when in fact, their shyness helps keep them undiscovered for so long in an infested home.|$|E

40|$|<b>Squeak</b> {{is a new}} {{programming}} language that is particularly appropriate for learning computer science. It offers an excellent infrastructure for interesting projects (e. g., multimedia, Web browsing and serving), and all source code is included (and written in <b>Squeak)</b> from the virtual machine, windowing, on up. <b>Squeak</b> is being used in a course on Objects and Design (focusing {{on the development of}} user interfaces), both to enhance the infrastructure for a course on, and to change how user interfaces are taught. Rather than teach a toolkit, the focus is now on teaching students how to build toolkits. This paper presents a pilot study suggesting benefits of our new approach. 1 <b>Squeak’s</b> Beginnings <b>Squeak</b> is a new {{programming language}} based on Smalltalk- 80, but interestingly, skipping some 15 years of development [3]. <b>Squeak</b> is highly cross-platform, running on Windows, Macintosh, Linux, BeOS, and Windows CE devices (among others) bit-identically. It has been updated with modern features, such as web browsing and serving, 3 -D graphics engine, and powerful sound synthesis. <b>Squeak</b> is an excellent pedagogical platform because it doesn’t presume a windowing operating system. Instead, <b>Squeak</b> implements all of the windowing, multimedia, and other software in itself (including its own virtual machine), providing both a rich set of examples and a bare substrate on which one can explore and build user interfaces from scratch.

25|$|Hamsters become fertile at {{different}} ages {{depending on their}} species. Both Syrian and Russian hamsters mature quickly and can begin reproducing {{at a young age}} (4–5 weeks), whereas Chinese hamsters will usually begin reproducing at two to three months of age, and Roborovskis at three to four months of age. The female's reproductive life lasts about 18 months, but male hamsters remain fertile much longer.

In the quarterfinals, she beat Polish teenager Agnieszka Radwańska, who had defeated second-seeded Svetlana Kuznetsova and Nadia Petrova in earlier rounds. Hantuchová then lost to Ana Ivanovic in the semifinals, 6–0, 3–6, 4–6, despite Hantuchová's leading the second set 2–0. After the match, Hantuchová claimed that Ivanovic had been distracting her by <b>squeaking</b> her shoes on the court before serving, a claim Ivanovic disputed.

25|$|Many {{long-term}} {{problems with}} hip replacements {{are the result}} of osteolysis. This is the loss of bone caused by the body's reaction to polyethylene wear debris, fine bits of plastic that come off the cup liner over time. An inflammatory process causes bone resorption that may lead to subsequent loosening of the hip implants and even fractures in the bone around the implants. In an attempt to eliminate the generation of wear particles, ceramic bearing surfaces are being used in the hope that they will have less wear and less osteolysis with better long-term results. Metal cup liners joined with metal heads (metal-on-metal hip arthroplasty) were also developed for similar reasons. In the lab these show excellent wear characteristics and benefit from a different mode of lubrication. At the same time that these two bearing surfaces were being developed, highly cross linked polyethylene plastic liners were also developed. The greater cross linking significantly reduces the amount of plastic wear debris given off over time. The newer ceramic and metal prostheses do not always have the long-term track record of established metal on poly bearings. Ceramic pieces can break leading to catastrophic failure. This occurs in about 2% of the implants placed. They may also cause an audible, high pitched <b>squeaking</b> noise with activity. Metal-on-metal arthroplasty releases metal debris into the body raising concerns about the potential dangers of these accumulating over time. Highly cross linked polyethylene is not as strong as regular polyethylene. These plastic liners can crack or break free of the metal shell that holds them.|$|E

25|$|The blacking-warehouse was {{the last}} house on the {{left-hand}} side of the way, at old Hungerford Stairs.

Its wainscoted rooms, and its rotten floors and staircase, and the old grey rats swarming down in the cellars, {{and the sound of}} their <b>squeaking</b> and scuffling coming up the stairs at all times, and the dirt and decay of the place, rise up visibly before me, as if I were there again. The counting-house was on the first floor, looking over the coal-barges and the river. There was a recess in it, in which I was to sit and work. My work was to cover the pots of paste-blacking; first with a piece of oil-paper, and then with a piece of blue paper; to tie them round with a string; and then to clip the paper close and neat, all round, until it looked as smart as a pot of ointment from an apothecary's shop. When a certain number of grosses of pots had attained this pitch of perfection, I was to paste on each a printed label, and then go on again with more pots. Two or three other boys were kept at similar duty down-stairs on similar wages. One of them came up, in a ragged apron and a paper cap, on the first Monday morning, to show me the trick of using the string and tying the knot. His name was Bob Fagin; and I took the liberty of using his name, long afterwards, in Oliver Twist.|$|E
