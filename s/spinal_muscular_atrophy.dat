5|$|Another {{potential}} health problem is <b>spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy</b> (SMA), another genetically inherited disease which causes {{the loss of}} the spinal-cord neurons which activate the skeletal muscles of the trunk and limbs.

5|$|Lucy {{returns and}} Chris rejects her offer of being father to her child when Nate confesses {{he does not}} want children; however, Chris changes his mind when Nate {{supports}} him. Nate later helps Chris and Lucy see that they need to think the idea through more thoroughly, and they draw up a contract detailing how their child will be raised. When they learn that they are both carriers of <b>spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy,</b> Chris tells Lucy that she should find another donor. But when Chris sees how down Lucy is, he changes his mind and they go ahead with the insemination. A couple of weeks later, Lucy calls Chris to tell him that she is pregnant. Chris plans to visit New York for the scan, but Nate confesses he is banned from the States for overstaying his visa there previously. Toadfish Rebecchi (Ryan Moloney) agrees to help lift the ban, but Nate misses a meeting and Chris accuses him of not taking it seriously. Lucy returns for a visit and Chris decides he wants to split his time between Erinsborough and New York when the baby comes, although Nate is against this idea. Nate realises that they want different things, and they break-up. Chris then decides to move to New York with Lucy and leaves after a farewell party at The Waterhole. A few months later, Amber contacts Chris and Lucy via video call after learning that they have had a daughter. Chris and Lucy introduce her to Anne, and Chris asks Amber to say hello to Nate for him.|$|E

50|$|In all <b>spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophies,</b> {{the primary}} feature is muscle {{weakness}} accompanied by atrophy of muscle.

25|$|Secondary {{scoliosis}} due to neuropathic and myopathic {{conditions can}} lead to a loss of muscular support for the spinal column so that the spinal column is pulled in abnormal directions. Some conditions which may cause secondary scoliosis include muscular dystrophy, <b>spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy,</b> poliomyelitis, cerebral palsy, spinal cord trauma, and myotonia. Scoliosis often presents itself, or worsens, during an adolescent's growth spurt and is more often diagnosed in females than males.|$|E
25|$|Literally, a {{myopathy}} is {{a disease}} of the muscle tissue itself. Myo derives from the word muscle and pathos means disease. There are dozens of different myopathies, and myopathies {{are not the only}} conditions that can cause muscle weakness. Other diseases can cause weakness such as medical conditions affecting sites outside of the muscle itself, including problems in the brain (such as stroke, cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis), or problems in the spinal cord and/or nerve (such as polio and <b>spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy).</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{clinical}} features of {{two brothers and}} one nephew with X-linked recessive bulbo-spinal neuronopathy are described. The neurophysiological investigations and sural nerve biopsy, previously unreported, confirmed that both motor and sensory nerves are affected.

50|$|<b>Spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophies</b> (SMAs) are {{a genetically}} and {{clinically}} heterogeneous group of rare debilitating disorders characterised by the degeneration of {{lower motor neurons}} (neuronal cells situated in the anterior horn of the spinal cord) and subsequent atrophy (wasting) of various muscle groups in the body. While some SMAs lead to early infant death, other types permit normal adult life with only mild weakness.|$|R
25|$|PGD is {{available}} for {{a large number of}} monogenic disorders—that is, disorders due to a single gene only (autosomal recessive, autosomal dominant or X-linked)—or of chromosomal structural aberrations (such as a balanced translocation). PGD helps these couples identify embryos carrying a genetic disease or a chromosome abnormality, thus avoiding diseased offspring. The most frequently diagnosed autosomal recessive disorders are cystic fibrosis, Beta-thalassemia, sickle cell disease and <b>spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy</b> type 1. The most common dominant diseases are myotonic dystrophy, Huntington's disease and Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease; {{and in the case of}} the X-linked diseases, most of the cycles are performed for fragile X syndrome, haemophilia A and Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Though it is quite infrequent, some centers report PGD for mitochondrial disorders or two indications simultaneously.|$|E
25|$|Severe {{monogenic}} diseases {{for which}} prenatal diagnosis is more commonly applied to include cystic fibrosis, beta-thalassemia, sickle cell anemia, <b>spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy,</b> myotonic dystrophy, fragile-X syndrome, Duchenne muscular dystrophy and Hemophilia. Both autosomal dominant and recessive disorders {{have been detected}} noninvasively by analyzing paternally inherited DNA. Limitations to single gene disorders are autosomal recessive mutation or when the fetal autosomal dominant mutation is maternally inherited. There are also large sequence mutations that include duplication, expansion, insertion of DNA sequences. cffDNA is fragmented with 200-300bp in length, thus these are harder to detect. One example is achondroplasia, a common autosomal dominant form of dwarfism, caused by FGFR3 gene point mutations. Two pregnancies were examined in this study, one fetus {{was found to have}} the paternally inherited G1138A mutation and the other with a G1138A de novo mutation. Another example is the Huntington's disease. It is currently diagnosed at 10–13 weeks at gestation with chronic villus sampling for polymorphic repeats. With qRT-PCR, there has been detection of CAG repeats at 17, 20 and 24, all normal levels.|$|E

5000|$|While MND {{refers to}} a {{specific}} subset of similar diseases, there are numerous other diseases of motor neurons that are referred to collectively as [...] "motor neuron disorders", for instance disease belonging to <b>spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophies.</b> However, they are not classified as [...] "motor neuron diseases" [...] by the tenth International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10), which is the definition followed in this article.|$|R
50|$|A {{motor neuron}} disease (MND) is any of several {{neurological}} disorders that selectively affect motor neurons, the cells that control voluntary muscles of the body.

2500|$|Two {{copies of}} the gene must be mutated {{for a person to}} be {{affected}} by an autosomal recessive disorder. An affected person usually has unaffected parents who each carry a single copy of the mutated gene (and are referred to as carriers). Two unaffected people who each carry one copy of the mutated gene have a 25% risk with each pregnancy of having a child affected by the disorder. Examples of this type of disorder are Albinism, Medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency, cystic fibrosis, sickle-cell disease, Tay-Sachs disease, Niemann-Pick disease, <b>spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy,</b> and Roberts syndrome. [...] Certain other phenotypes, such as wet versus dry earwax, are also determined in an autosomal recessive fashion.|$|E
40|$|A {{case of the}} Vulpian Bernhardt type of <b>spinal</b> {{progressive}} <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy</b> was reported.

50|$|RAN is an {{androgen}} receptor (AR) coactivator (ARA24) that binds differentially with different lengths of polyglutamine within the {{androgen receptor}}.
