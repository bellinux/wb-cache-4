5|$|In 1801, Guinness West India Porter, {{the direct}} {{predecessor}} of Foreign Extra Stout, was first exported from the St. James's Gate brewery in Dublin. The product was formulated for Irish immigrant {{workers in the}} Caribbean. The beer was only brewed between October and April, which reduced acidification, and was matured in large wooden vats {{for up to two}} years, which gave the finished product greater <b>stability.</b> <b>To</b> survive the long journey overseas, which was then taken by ship, it was brewed with extra hops and a higher alcohol content, which acted as natural preservatives for the beer. Exported in barrels, the product was then bottled locally, which helped to reduce costs.|$|E
5|$|In 1998 a new two-tier Anfield Road end was opened. The stand has {{encountered}} {{a number of}} problems since its redevelopment; {{at the beginning of the}} 1999–2000 season, a series of support poles and stanchions had to be brought in to give extra <b>stability</b> <b>to</b> the top tier of the stand. During Ronnie Moran's testimonial match against Celtic, many fans complained of movement of the top tier. At the same time that the stanchions were inserted, the executive seating area was expanded by two rows in the main stand, lowering the seating capacity in the paddock.|$|E

5|$|In 2011, Kooijman, et al., {{published}} an article in Science showing that neither gyroscopic effects nor so-called caster effects due to trail are necessary for a bike to balance itself. They designed a two-mass-skate bicycle that the equations of motion predict is self-stable even with negative trail, the front wheel contacts {{the ground in front}} of the steering axis, and with counter-rotating wheels to cancel any gyroscopic effects. Then they constructed a physical model to validate that prediction. This may require some of the details provided below about steering geometry or <b>stability</b> <b>to</b> be re-evaluated.

5|$|Macrinus was proclaimed {{emperor of}} Rome by 11 April 217 {{while in the}} eastern provinces of the empire and was {{subsequently}} confirmed as such by the Senate; however, {{for the duration of}} his reign, he never had the opportunity to return to Rome. His predecessor's policies had left Rome's coffers empty and the empire at war with several kingdoms, including Parthia, Armenia and Dacia. As emperor, Macrinus first attempted to enact reform to bring economic and diplomatic <b>stability</b> <b>to</b> Rome. While Macrinus' diplomatic actions brought about peace with each of the individual kingdoms, the additional monetary costs and subsequent fiscal reforms generated unrest in the Roman military.|$|E
5|$|The Amylostereaceae {{possess a}} dimitic trama, meaning {{that there are}} in its mycelia two kinds of hyphae. The first type is {{brownish}} skeletal hyphae, which provide <b>stability</b> <b>to</b> the fruit body. These hyphae run parallel to the bark and often have hairpin-like turns, so that the loops form thick-walled, cystidium-like structures, the so-called pseudocystidia. The second type is generative hyphae. They are translucent (hyaline) and serve to promote {{the growth of the}} fungus. Genuine cystidia arise in the hymenium and the layer directly below, the subhymenium. Both pseudocystidia and cystidia are encrusted, meaning that they feature crystal-like structures on the top.|$|E

5|$|The Flavians, {{although}} a relatively short-lived dynasty, helped restore <b>stability</b> <b>to</b> an empire on its knees. Although all three have been criticised, especially {{based on their}} more centralised style of rule, they issued reforms that created a stable enough empire to last well into the 3rd century. However, their background as a military dynasty led to further marginalisation of the senate, and a conclusive move away from princeps, or first citizen, and toward imperator, or emperor.|$|E
5|$|There {{were two}} {{extraordinary}} magistrates: the dictator and the magister equitum (literally: master of horse).

The magister equitum, was then appointed by the dictator as his lieutenant. The dictatorship was only used in the early and middle Republic, before falling out of fashion {{after the end of the}} Second Punic War, before being revived during the time of Sulla as an extraconstitutional measure, not to defeat some foe or quell unrest, but rather, to bring <b>stability</b> <b>to</b> the political order.|$|E
5|$|Thorium dioxide is a {{refractory}} material {{with the highest}} melting point among any known oxide (3390°C). Adding 0.8–1% ThO2 to tungsten stabilizes its structure, so the doped filaments have better mechanical <b>stability</b> <b>to</b> vibrations. To dissolve ThO2 in acids, it is heated to 500–600°C; heating above 600°C produces a very resistant to acids and other reagents form of ThO2.

Predicted slip tendency in shallow Moebetsu formations is much lower than that in deep overpressured Takinoue formations, and estimated effects of the planned injection are relatively limited in both formations. Another point is that poro-elastic stress development leads to changes in fault <b>stability</b> compared <b>to</b> that calculated based on pressure buildup alone and the initial stress state.

Normal settlements, {{with the exception of}} a few fortifications and cult venues, were limited to lowland areas below 350 meters above the sea level. Most villages built without artificial defensive structures were located within valley areas of natural bodies of water.

5|$|Anfield could {{accommodate}} {{more than}} 60,000 supporters at its peak, {{and had a}} capacity of 55,000 until the 1990s. The Taylor Report and Premier League regulations obliged Liverpool to convert Anfield to an all-seater stadium {{in time for the}} 1993–94 season, reducing the capacity to 45,276. The findings of the Taylor Report precipitated the redevelopment of the Kemlyn Road Stand, which was rebuilt in 1992, coinciding with the centenary of the club, and was known as the Centenary Stand until 2017 when it was renamed the Kenny Dalglish Stand. An extra tier was added to the Anfield Road end in 1998, which further increased the capacity of the ground but gave rise to problems when it was opened. A series of support poles and stanchions were inserted to give extra <b>stability</b> <b>to</b> the top tier of the stand after movement of the tier was reported {{at the start of the}} 1999–2000 season.|$|E

5|$|In 1930, Hart {{applied for}} and was {{appointed}} to the position of Administrator of Western Samoa, which was controlled by New Zealand under a mandate from the League of Nations. This was a difficult period for the colony as many of its citizens wanted independence. The Mau movement in particular was agitating for self-determination and employed tactics of civil disobedience as a means of opposing the New Zealand administration. After some heavy-handed management of protestors by his predecessor had resulted in several deaths amongst the movement, Hart made progress in improving relationships with the Mau when he took up his position in 1931. He also returned some financial <b>stability</b> <b>to</b> the colony which had struggled during the Great Depression.
