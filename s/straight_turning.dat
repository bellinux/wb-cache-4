40|$|We {{present a}} novel {{multimodule}} micro transportation system (MTS), which can drive micro containers in straight, curved, and T-junction paths based on electrostatic comb-drive actuator and ratchet mechanism. The transported objects are micro containers, which have {{two pairs of}} driving wings and anti-reverse wings attached to a body. Their movement is like a water strider, i. e., its driving wings rotate backward to generate reaction force to push the containers forward, while the anti-reverse wings act as a ratchet mechanism to prevent the container from moving backward. By developing three basic modules, i. e., <b>straight,</b> <b>turning,</b> and T-junction modules, the different configurations of the MTS can be built from these modules conveniently. Each module consists of ratchet racks driven by electrostatic comb-drive actuators. Containers having length, width, and thickness of 500, 250, and 30 孬 respectively, were driven to move with a changeable velocity up to 1000 孯sec in <b>straight,</b> <b>turning,</b> and T-junction modules. The velocity of the container was proportional to the frequency of driving voltage. By utilizing silicon micromachining technology, a prototype of MTS was fabricated from silicon-on-insulator wafer with only one mask. No Full Tex...|$|E
40|$|AbstractMachining process {{models can}} be used to predict cutting force/power and further {{optimize}} the process parameters. In this work, a mechanistic cutting force model for turning processes is developed. In order to accurately predict cutting forces, the cutting tool edge is discretized and an approach for calculating the chip load corresponding to each discretized edge segment is developed. Approach for calculating effective tool angles is also developed considering effects of the tool corner radius and the change of feed direction. By using the yield shear stress of the work material, the friction angle between work and tool material, the chip load and the effective tool angles for each tool edge segment, the distributions of the turning forces and force intensity along the tool edge can be predicted. Turning cases of <b>straight</b> <b>turning,</b> contour turning, taper turning and facing are tested and the model outputs include the distributions of the instantaneous effective tool angles, chip load, cutting force coefficients and force intensity. Test results for <b>straight</b> <b>turning</b> and contour turning operations are analyzed to demonstrate the model capability. The distributions of force and force intensity on tool edge provide useful information for prediction of turning forces/power and potential further prediction of tool wear/life...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to design a {{navigation}} system composed of a human-controlled leader vehicle and a follower vehicle. The follower vehicle automatically tracks the leader vehicle. With such a system, a human driver can control two vehicles efficiently in agricultural operations. The tracking system was developed for the leader and the follower vehicle, and control of the follower was performed using a camera vision system. A stable and accurate monocular vision-based sensing system was designed, consisting of a camera and rectangular markers. Noise in the data acquisition was reduced by using the least-squares method. A feedback control algorithm was used to allow the follower vehicle to track the trajectory of the leader vehicle. A proportional–integral–derivative (PID) controller was introduced to maintain the required distance between the leader and the follower vehicle. Field experiments were conducted to evaluate the sensing and tracking performances of the leader-follower system while the leader vehicle was driven at an average speed of 0. 3 m/s. In the case of linear trajectory tracking, the RMS errors were 6. 5 cm, 8. 9 cm and 16. 4 cm for <b>straight,</b> <b>turning</b> and zigzag paths, respectively. Again, for parallel trajectory tracking, the root mean square (RMS) errors were found to be 7. 1 cm, 14. 6 cm and 14. 0 cm for <b>straight,</b> <b>turning</b> and zigzag paths, respectively. The navigation performances indicated that the autonomous follower vehicle was able to follow the leader vehicle, and the tracking accuracy was found to be satisfactory. Therefore, the developed leader-follower system can be implemented for the harvesting of grains, using a combine as the leader and an unloader as the autonomous follower vehicle...|$|E

The use of MTP to create segmented chips requires a different approach for threading operations than for normal MTP turning operations, although the fundamental principal is the same. The primary difference between MTP for threading and for <b>straight</b> <b>turning</b> is that the part surface that the tool repeatedly engages and disengages, during the modulation process, is the thread root rather than the cut face.

40|$|AbstractFor the {{increasing}} of {{the cutting tool}} efficiency is possible to use two main methods. One of them builds the thin coating {{on the surface and}} the surface volume increase. They are standard methods like as PVD or CVD deposition and their modifications. The second one principle is based on the influence of the cutting tool surface by chemical elements which create special surface properties into the material depth. The influences depth is depend on the methods and could be made from microns to millimetres. In our case the fluidization methods were used specifically carbonitriding and carburizing.

40|$|Abstract — In {{machining}} operations, achieving desired {{surface quality}} {{features of the}} machined product, is really a challenging job. Because, these quality features are highly correlated {{and are expected to}} be influenced directly or indirectly by the direct effect of process parameters or their interactive effects (i. e. on process environment). However, the extents of significant influence of the process parameters are different for different responses. Therefore, optimization of surface roughness is a multi-factor, multi-objective optimization problem. Therefore, to solve such a multi-objective optimization problem, it is felt necessary to identify the optimal parametric combination, following which all objectives could be optimized simultaneously.

40|$|Present work {{highlights}} {{application of}} utility theory combined with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Taguchi’s robust design for simultaneous optimization of correlated multiple surface quality characteristics of mild steel machined product prepared by <b>straight</b> <b>turning</b> operation. The study aims at evaluating {{the most favorable}} process environment followed by an optimal parametric combination for achieving high surface quality. Traditional Taguchi based hybrid optimization approaches rely {{on the assumption that}} quality indices are uncorrelated or independent.

To overcome this limitation of Taguchi approach, the present study proposes application of PCA to convert correlated responses into uncorrelated quality indices called principal components. Finally based on utility theory, Taguchi method has been applied to solve this optimization problem. The study demonstrates detailed methodology and concludes robustness and flexibility of the proposed optimization technique and validates its effectiveness through a case study in which correlated multiple response characteristics of turning operation have been optimized...|$|E
