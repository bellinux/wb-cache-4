40|$|The {{effects of}} {{different}} soil management practices and irrigation on plant water relations, physiological response and productivity of chestnut stands in Northeastern Portugal were assessed during four growing seasons (2003 to 2006). Treatments were: conventional soil tillage up to 15 – 20 cm depth with a tine cultivator thrice a year (CT); no tillage with spontaneous herbaceous vegetation (NV); no tillage with rainfed <b>seeded</b> <b>pasture</b> (NP); and no tillage with irrigated <b>seeded</b> <b>pasture</b> (NIP). Results suggest that soil water availability {{was the most}} critical parameter for chestnut productivity over the study period. In all treatments, high predawn leaf water potentials (- 0. 40 to - 0. 55 MPa) were observed during the dry seasons of 2003, 2004 and 2006, showing no critical conditions for plant productivity, which is ascribed to water availability in deep soil layers. In contrast, in 2005, an extremely dry year, water potentials decreased and varied from - 1. 46 to - 1. 72 MPa in late summer, showing unfavourable conditions for nut production. Maintenance of spontaneous herbaceous vegetation without irrigation enhanced productivity of chestnut stands {{as compared with the}} conventional tillage system and the no tillage system with <b>seeded</b> <b>pasture.</b> Productivity in the soil watering system (NIP treatment) was not significantly different from that observed in the NV treatment.

40|$|Current {{approaches}} to estimate freshwater use in livestock production systems generally fail {{to consider the}} competition for water resources with alternative uses, such as production of food crops food or other ecosystem services. This article presents a new method {{to account for the}} competition for freshwater use between food crops and animal feed, while assessing freshwater use in livestock production systems. The developed water use ratio (WUR) is defined as the maximum amount of human digestible protein (HDP) derived from food crops from the consumptive water use (CWU) appropriated to produce 1 kg of animal-source food (ASF) over the amount of HDP in that 1 kg of ASF. The CWU for livestock production is first categorized according to the land over which it is consumed, based on the suitability of that land to produce food crops. Then, the method assesses food-feed competition by determining the amount of HDP that could have been produced from food crops, using the same CWU currently used to produce ASF. The method enables identification of livestock production systems that contribute to global food supply without competing significantly over water resources with food production, based on their CWU. Three beef production systems in Uruguay are used to illustrate the method. During the backgrounding and the finishing stages, which are analyzed in this study, cattle can be kept on natural pasture (NP), <b>seeded</b> <b>pasture</b> (SP) or in feedlots (FL). The following three systems were analysed: i) NP-NP, ii) SP-SP and iii) SP-FL. Results show that the NP-NP system uses the largest amount of water per kg of beef output. However, results also show that the SP-SP and SP-FL systems can potentially produce more HDP by growing food crops than by producing beef. Based on the traditional measure for water productivity, i. e. the quantity of CWU per kilo of beef produced, we would conclude that the NP-NP system is least efficient, whereas based on the WUR the NP-NP system is the only system producing HDP more efficiently than food crops. Sustainable intensification not only implies improving agriculture and livestock productivity per unit of resource used, but also improving the number of human beings nourished. Results from this study illustrate the importance of considering competition and trade-offs with other uses when evaluating water use efficiency of livestock systems to promote sustainable intensification.

40|$|Land-use {{change is}} {{prevalent}} across the Prairie Pothole Region (PPR) because of widespread agricultural expansion {{over the last}} century. Different land-use histories will affect the distributions of native vegetation and soil biogeochemistry of PPR wetlands. Furthermore, because native vegetation is partially required for wetland classification, supplementary methods are needed for proper wetland delineation. Accurate estimates of GHG emissions are required for correct climate change models; therefore proper investigation of contrasting land-use histories on GHG emissions is essential. This study focused on determining the effect that different land-use histories had on the expression of soil hydric features and magnetic susceptibility as well as examining interacting effects among contrasting land-use histories and biogeochemical controls of GHG emissions of PPR wetlands. To determine the differing effects of land-use histories on hydric soil indicators and magnetic susceptibility, fifteen ephemeral wetlands under differing land-uses (annually cultivated, restored grassland, <b>seeded</b> <b>pasture</b> and native grassland) were sampled {{to a depth of}} 1 m with samples collected every 10 cm. An upland pit was correspondingly sampled for each wetland. Soils were then analyzed for organic C, inorganic C, dithionite extractable Fe, particle size distributions, wet stable aggregate distributions and magnetic susceptibility at four different temperature treatments (room temperature, 100 °C, 300 °C and 500 °C). While some variables had observable difference among the land-uses (i. e. organic C, dithionite extractable Fe and magnetic susceptibility), the most pronounced differences were between the different pit positions (i. e. wetland pits vs. upland pits). The data was holistically analyzed through non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) and position based differences were easily identified through this approach; however, only slight differences were present with respect to contrasting land-use histories. The controls of GHG emissions and their interactions were evaluated through two laboratory incubations (i. e. CH 4 incubation and N 2 O incubation), with a factorial design using land-use history treatments as well as biogeochemical controls specific to each GHG (i. e. CH 4 : SO 4 - additions; N 2 O: water filled pore space [WFPS] treatments and NO 3 - additions). Both incubations had the presence of interacting factors among the differing land-use histories. During the CH 4 incubation, each land-use history responded oppositely to sulfate additions. During the N 2 O incubations, both WFPS treatments and NO 3 - additions had additive effects on the emissions of N 2 O. Moreover, the presence of the interactions satisfied the objective of the incubation study. Overall it was determined that while land-use history significantly altered the response of GHG controls with respect to GHG emissions, it did not have strong effects in influencing hydric soil indicators and magnetic susceptibility values...|$|E

Native perennial forage species were selected from three functional groups (C 3, C 4 grasses and legumes) and seeded in 2010 and 2014 in monocultures and mixtures, including: western wheatgrass (WWG) (Pascopyrum smithii (Rydb.) Barkworth & D. R. Dewey), bluebunch wheatgrass (BBW) (Pseudoroegneria spicata (Pursh) Á. Löve), nodding brome (NOB) (Bromus porteri (J. M. Coult.) Nash), little blue stem (LBS) (Schizachyrium scoparium (Michx.) Nash), side-oats grama (SOG) (Bouteloua curtipendula (Michx.) Torr.), purple prairie clover (PPC) (Dalea purpurea Vent.) and white prairie clover (WPC) (Dalea candida Willd.). Objectives of this thesis were to: 1) evaluate the long-term forage yield and quality of these forage species in monocultures and mixtures; 2) determine the weed seedbank density and aboveground weed populations in stands of these species; and 3) evaluate the allelopathic effect of these species on three problematic weeds: dandelion (Taraxacum officinale F. H. Wigg.), scentless chamomile (Matricaria perforata Mérat) and foxtail barley (Hordeum jubatum L.). Forage mixtures produced greater dry matter than monocultures at all harvesting times. Mixtures of which WWG was a component produced higher forage yield, and a mixture of WWG, BBW, LBS and legumes can provide sustainable forage yield and quality and can be suitable options for <b>seeded</b> <b>pastures.</b> In this study, the forage stands experienced one of the driest and wettest years {{in the history of}} the region. We observed no significant differences in forage production of each species from dry to wet year supporting the idea of high stability and productivity of native species during varying climate conditions. Mixtures of forage species also promoted lower weed densities in the seedbank and in the swards aboveground compared to monocultures. Among mixtures, those containing WWG had a significant lower abundance of weeds in the seedbank and aboveground weed populations compared to other forage species. The weed seedbank varied seasonally with the minimum number of weed seeds in early spring and maximum in late summer. The most abundant weeds in the seedbank were the least abundant weeds in aboveground population and vice versa. WWG showed promising results as a native forage species by demonstrating the potential to suppress weeds and reduce weed seed size when seeded in monocultures and mixtures. In the greenhouse, root leachate from WWG, LBS and SOG reduced the aboveground and belowground growth of weeds up to 90 %. These findings suggest that the use of allelopathic species may provide weed control and management benefits in <b>seeded</b> <b>pastures</b> and native prairie restorations. In conclusion, forage mixtures produced greater dry matter and promoted lower weed densities in the seedbank and aboveground populations compared to monocultures. This demonstrates that increasing forage mixture diversity can increase forage yield and be an effective ecological and non-chemical weed control tactic in <b>seeded</b> <b>pastures...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abandoned {{pastures}} and secondary forests are increasingly prominent features of tropical landscapes. Forest regrowth on abandoned pastures is generally slow and virtually limited to regeneration from seeds from external sources, since agricultural activities alter site conditions. We hypothesize that seed availability {{is a major}} limiting factor in forest recovery on abandoned pastures. This hypothesis was tested by studying the seed bank, seed rain, and seed predation in a small pasture (1 ha) situated in a forest-pasture mosaic in northwestern Costa Rica. The tree seed density in the <b>pasture</b> <b>seed</b> bank was much lower (21 /m 2) than the density in the seed bank of a neighboring secondary forest (402 /m 2). Within a period of five weeks, 23 tree <b>seeds</b> entered the <b>pasture</b> by <b>seed</b> rain. This number is low compared to densities found in closed forests but higher than densities reported in other studies where virtually no seeds were found beyond 20 m from the forest edge. Possibly {{the small size of}} the <b>pasture</b> with <b>seed</b> sources nearby and the small-scale landscape mosaic enhance seed dispersal. Predation limits the <b>seed</b> density in <b>pastures,</b> with 42 % of the woody species consumed by predators. The low seed density in the seed bank, and hampered recruitment combined with significant losses, pose severe restrictions to forest recovery on abandoned pastures.
