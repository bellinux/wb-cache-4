5|$|Tensions began rising between Lhermitte and her husband. Moqadem {{would spend}} long {{hours away from}} home, {{becoming}} a regular at a bar and a spa. In addition, he would take several trips each year to visit his family in Marrakesh, with the length of each trip ranging from a week to a month. Lhermitte's first son and fifth child, Mehdi, was born on August 9, 2003. The following year, Schaar recommended that Lhermitte <b>should</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> psychiatrist and she began consulting the psychiatrist Dr. Diderick Veldekens in 2005.|$|E

25|$|Diagnosis of {{a balance}} {{disorder}} is complicated {{because there are}} many kinds of balance disorders and because other medical conditions—including ear infections, blood pressure changes, and some vision problems—and some medications may contribute to a balance disorder. A person experiencing dizziness <b>should</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> physiotherapist or physician for an evaluation. A physician can assess for a medical disorder, such as a stroke or infection, if indicated. A physiotherapist can assess balance or a dizziness disorder and provide specific treatment.|$|E

50|$|Temporary {{binocular}} diplopia {{can be caused}} by alcohol intoxication or head injuries, such as concussion (if temporary double vision does not resolve quickly, one <b>should</b> <b>see</b> <b>an</b> optometrist or ophthalmologist immediately). It can also be a side effect of benzodiazepines or opioids, particularly if used in larger doses for recreation, the anti-epileptic drugs Phenytoin and Zonisamide, and the anti-convulsant drug Lamotrigine, as well as the hypnotic drug Zolpidem and the dissociative drugs Ketamine and Dextromethorphan. Temporary diplopia can also be caused by tired and/or strained eye muscles or voluntarily. If diplopia appears with other symptoms such as fatigue and acute or chronic pain, the patient <b>should</b> <b>see</b> <b>an</b> ophthalmologist immediately.|$|R

25|$|The main antithyroid {{drugs are}} {{carbimazole}} (in the UK), methimazole (in the US), and propylthiouracil/PTU. These drugs block the binding of iodine and coupling of iodotyrosines. The most dangerous side effect is agranulocytosis (1/250, more in PTU). Others include granulocytopenia (dose-dependent, which improves on cessation of the drug) and aplastic anemia. Patients on these medications <b>should</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> doctor if they develop sore throat or fever. The most common side effects are rash and peripheral neuritis. These drugs also cross the placenta and are secreted in breast milk. Lugol's iodine {{may be used}} to block hormone synthesis before surgery.|$|E
25|$|The AND (Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, {{previously}} ADA) {{recommends a}} minimum of 20–35 g/day for a healthy adult depending on calorie intake (e.g., a 2000 Cal/8400 kJ diet should include 25 g of fiber per day). The AND's recommendation for children is that intake should equal age in years plus 5 g/day (e.g., a 4 year old should consume 9 g/day). No guidelines have yet been established for the elderly or very ill. Patients with current constipation, vomiting, and abdominal pain <b>should</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> physician. Certain bulking agents are not commonly recommended with the prescription of opioids because the slow transit time mixed with larger stools may lead to severe constipation, pain, or obstruction.|$|E
25|$|Sore nipples (nipple pain, or thelalgia) are {{probably}} the most common complaint after the birth. They are generally reported by the second day after delivery but improve within 5 days. Pain beyond the first week, severe pain, cracking, fissures or localized swelling is not normal. The mother <b>should</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> doctor for further evaluation. Sore nipples, a common cause of pain, often come from the baby not latching on properly. Factors include too much pressure on the nipple when not enough of the areola is latched onto and an improper release of suction {{at the end of the}} feeding. Improper use of breast pumps or topical remedies can also contribute. Nipple pain can also be a sign of infection. When the baby bites the nipple it can also be painful.|$|E

25|$|How the {{infinite}} variety {{of plant leaves}} is generated is a subject of intense research. Some common themes have emerged. One {{of the most significant}} is the involvement of KNOX genes in generating compound leaves, as in tomato (see above). But this again is not universal. For example, pea uses a different mechanism for doing the same thing. Mutations in genes affecting leaf curvature can also change leaf form, by changing the leaf from flat, to a crinky shape, like the shape of cabbage leaves. There also exist different morphogen gradients in a developing leaf which define the leaf's axis. Changes in these morphogen gradients may also affect the leaf form. Another very important class of regulators of leaf development are the microRNAs, whose role in this process has just begun to be documented. The coming years <b>should</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> rapid development in comparative studies on leaf development, with many EST sequences involved in the process coming online.|$|E
500|$|According to a belief, {{the power}} of dragon boys was {{greatest}} {{at the time of}} their birth; the younger they were, the greater power they had. In a folk tale from eastern Serbia, a group of dragons surrounded an ala, which broke away and flew into a watermill. There was a woman in the mill with her baby, who was a dragon boy; he grabbed a stone and killed the ala with it. It was recorded in the region of Niš that a winged dragon boy, in his fights with ale, [...] "takes a plough beam and immediately stops the ala, and hail ceases." [...] The mother of a dragon boy wanted to make him an ordinary child by cutting off the winglets beneath his armpits, but that section resulted in the boy's death. As was thought in the Župa basin and nearby areas, no one but the mother <b>should</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> dragon boy during the first seventeen days of his life; otherwise the child would die. If he survived, he would protect his village from hail, and at the age of seven he would fly away from home. It was also believed in Župa that the dragon men lived alone, without contacts with other humans.|$|E
