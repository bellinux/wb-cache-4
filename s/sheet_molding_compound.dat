50|$|Compression molding {{was first}} {{developed}} to manufacture composite parts for metal replacement applications, compression molding is typically {{used to make}} larger flat or moderately curved parts. This method of molding is greatly used in manufacturing automotive parts such as hoods, fenders, scoops, spoilers, as well as smaller more intricate parts. The material to be molded is positioned in the mold cavity and the heated platens are closed by a hydraulic ram. Bulk molding compound (BMC) or <b>sheet</b> <b>molding</b> <b>compound</b> (SMC), are conformed to the mold form by the applied pressure and heated until the curing reaction occurs.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Current <b>sheet</b> <b>molding</b> <b>compound</b> (SMC) panels, when {{coated with}} powder primer, show primer popping in the bake oven {{due to the}} {{degassing}} of the substrate moisture. In the absence of moisture, however, {{it was found that}} some SMCs showed severe popping, while other SMC materials did not. These results suggested that, contrary to general opinion, the moisture content in SMC might not be the only cause for popping. This report covers the results of a systematic study that was carried out to identify the factors that contribute to powder primer popping. Several potential variables that could affect popping, such as volatiles in the substrate, thermal conductivity of the substrate, static charges, and powder bake profile were studied. The experiments showed that the poly(vinyl acetate) in the low profile additive (LPA) is the main cause. More specifically, the micro void formation of this low profile additive that eliminates SMC shrinkage, and enables a smooth surface finish, also causes primer popping. Based on the experimental results, it was concluded that the air permeation into these micro voids is the reason behind the popping of the moisture free SMC substrates. This understanding of the failure mechanism, paves the way for the development of low moisture absorbing SMC materials that can be powder primed in our assembly plants, and could remove the barriers for the usage of SMC on GM vehicles.

40|$|AbstractThe use of <b>sheet</b> <b>molding</b> <b>compounds</b> (SMC) {{in diverse}} {{applications}} requires different specific material properties {{for each type}} of finished parts. These material properties have to be assured by a reliable quality control, which does not only have to be performed for the prefabricated SMC itself but also during the production process of the semi-finished material. This is of high importance because quality fluctuations and defects can already occur during the production of the semi-finished SMC. This results in high scrap rates as well as machine failure and can additionally cause further problems in the following process steps. Hence, an inline quality control can help to establish objective quality criteria for semi-finished SMC and can enable controlled and stable production processes. Therefore, this paper deals with quality assurance in the production process of semi-finished <b>sheet</b> <b>molding</b> <b>compounds.</b> Air entrapping and fiber distribution are identified as two parameters that influence the quality of the semi-finished product significantly. In addition, the early detection of a pending carrier foil failure can help to establish a stable process. The focus of this paper lies on how various, individually adapted metrology systems can be used for the detection of the respective characteristics and integrated into the production process of the semi-finished SMC. In particular, optical systems, such as area scan cameras and laser stripe sensors as well as thermographic sensors are discussed and possibilities for application-related sensor data evaluation are shown. This helps to reduce the scrap rates of parts and to establish a further automated production process...|$|R

40|$|The use of polymer {{composite}} materials for large body panels in automobiles {{has created an}} environmental problem; these materials are not degradable nor are they recyclable. The objective of this project is to change this kind of material into an admixture to concrete that would enhance {{the properties of the}} concrete, {{and at the same time}} solve an environmental problem. Experimental results show that adding pyrolysed <b>sheet</b> <b>molding</b> <b>compound</b> (PSMC) residue to cement mortar can lead to an increase in the compressive strength of mortar. The improvement in strength is more significant in later ages than in early ages. Scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction studies reveal that PSMC has changed the microstructure of mortar and interfered with the cement hydration processes. The improvement of strength is believed to be due to both the physical nature and the pozzolanic properties of PSMC. Compared with other pozzolans used in concrete such as fly ash and condensed silica fume, it is concluded that PSMC has similar physical and chemical characteristics, and so there is a strong potential to develop a new pozzolanic admixture for concrete by pyrolysis of <b>sheet</b> <b>molding</b> <b>compound.</b> This may represent an economic solution to the disposal of large polymer automotive panels made from SMC.

40|$|ABSTRACT: During {{compression}} <b>molding</b> of <b>sheet</b> <b>molding</b> <b>compounds</b> {{air bubbles}} are formed that can deteriorate several {{properties of the}} final composite. The story of such bubbles is directly set by the local pressure distribution during pressing.

Polyester resins are the most common matrix material for a major class of these composites known as <b>sheet</b> <b>molding</b> <b>compounds</b> (SMC's). However, polyesters are inherently brittle.

This study investigated a system of unsaturated polyester and epoxy modified with an amine terminated poly (butadiene-co-acrylonitrile) (ATBN) liquid rubber. At less than 9 % ATBN, the morphology of this molecular network system (MNS) consisted of a continuous polyester-rich matrix with discrete rubber-rich domains, and produced only small increases in toughness properties. On the other hand, at higher rubber contents, the morphology changed to a continuous rubber-rich phase with discrete brittle polyester-rich domains.

Compression molding will reduce manufacturing costs of composites by: (1) minimizing the conventional machining required after fabrication due to the use of full 360 deg matched tooling, (2) reducing fabrication time by minimizing the intensive hand lay-up operations associated with individual ply fabrication techniques, such as ply orientation and ply count and (3) possibly reducing component mold time by advanced B-staging prior to molding.

Allison is aggressively pursuing this next generation of engines, with both commercial and military applications, by reducing the overall weight of the engine through the incorporation of advanced, lightweight, high temperature materials, such as polymer matrix composites. This infusion of new materials into the engine is also a major factor in reducing engine cost because it permits the use of physically smaller structural components to achieve the same thrust levels as the generation that it replaced.
