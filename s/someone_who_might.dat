5|$|Charged {{with the}} crime of heresy, based on her claim of visions and signs from God, she is tried in an ecclesiastical court proceeding, which is forced by the English {{occupation}} government. The English wish to quickly condemn and execute Joan since English soldiers are afraid to fight while she remains alive, based on their belief that she could supernaturally affect battles even while in prison. Bishop Cauchon expresses his fear of wrongfully executing <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>might</b> have received visions from God. About to be burned for heresy, Joan is distraught {{that she will be}} executed without making a final confession. The Bishop tells her she must recant her visions before he can hear her confession. Joan signs the recantation. The relieved Bishop shows the paper to the English, saying that Joan can no longer be burned as a heretic. Whilst in her cell, Joan is confronted by an unnamed cloaked man (Dustin Hoffman), who is implied to be Joan's conscience. The man makes Joan question whether she was actually receiving messages from God.|$|E

Hoping to meet <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>might</b> be able to see both viewpoints, Dawkins interviews Yousef al-Khattab, formerly Joseph Cohen, an American-born Jew who came to Israel as a settler before converting to Islam. After offering Dawkins a cheerful welcome, al-Khattab explains his views relating to the decadence of Western values.|$|E
25|$|Little {{happened}} at the BBC regarding new Doctor Who production until the following year, when producer Mal Young arrived at the Corporation's in-house production arm as Head of Continuing Drama Series. Young was keen on reviving the programme, and this interest was shared by the then controller of BBC One, Peter Salmon. Tony Wood, a producer in Young's department, who previously worked at Granada Television, recalled his former colleague Russell T Davies' enthusiasm for the programme and recommended him to Young as <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>might</b> make a good writer of a new version. Davies had recently written for the Granada dramas The Grand and Touching Evil for the ITV network, and earlier in the decade {{had worked for the}} BBC, writing the well-received children's science fiction serials Century Falls and Dark Season, which itself contained many Doctor Who-influenced themes.|$|E

50|$|With {{the advent}} of the American Civil War in 1861, the Southern Maryland slave system and the economy that it {{supported}} rapidly began to collapse. In 1863, the Union Army established Camp Stanton, just 10 mi from the Mudd farm to enlist black freedmen and runaway slaves. Six regiments totaling over 8,700 black soldiers, many from Southern Maryland, were trained there. In 1864, Maryland, which was exempt from Lincoln's 1863 Emancipation Proclamation, abolished slavery, making it difficult for growers like Mudd to operate their plantations. As a result, Mudd considered selling his farm and depending on his medical practice. As Mudd pondered his alternatives, he was introduced to <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> said he <b>might</b> be interested in buying his property, a 26-year-old actor, John Wilkes Booth.|$|R
25|$|In 1976 also, O'Brien {{attempted}} to extend censorship to newspaper {{coverage of the}} 'Troubles', targeting in particular The Irish Press; In an interview with Washington Post reporter Bernard Nossiter, O'Brien identified Press Editor, Tim Pat Coogan, as <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>might</b> be prosecuted under a proposed amendment to the Offences Against the State Act. O'Brien cited pro-republican Letters to the Editor as coming {{under the terms of}} the legislation, for which the editor could be made legally liable. Coogan, who was immediately warned of O'Brien's intentions by Nossiter, then published the Nossiter-O'Brien interview (as also did the Irish Times). Due to public opposition the proposed provisions were amended to remove the perceived threat to newspapers. The 1973-77 Fine Gael/Labour Coalition Government also tried to prosecute the Irish Press for its coverage of the maltreatment of republican prisoners by the Garda Heavy Gang, with the paper winning the case.|$|E

Power also encouraged the writings of Langston Hughes, an African American poet and author, and assisted him by reviewing his work and suggesting changes.

40|$|In 1967, {{the social}} {{psychologist}} Stanley Milgram reported a fascinating observation. For {{a study on}} social connectivity, he randomly picked several individuals in Wichita, Kansas, {{and asked them to}} get a message delivered to a particular target person in Cambridge, Massachusetts—a distance of more than 1, 300 miles. There were two catches. First, Milgram provided no address but only the name and some basic information about the target person, such as the area where he lived and his profession (the target person was the same for everybody). Second, people could only forward the message to someone they knew on a first-name basis. That is, the task for each person in the chain was to pass on the message to someone she thought would be most likely to know the target person or know <b>someone</b> else <b>who</b> <b>might</b> know him. The astonishing result was not only that many of the messages reached the target, but also that the number of intermediaries needed turned out to be rather small, ranging between 2 and 10 (with a median of 5). 1 Milgram’s (1967) findings became known as the small-world phenomenon or six-degrees of separation because it takes six separate journeys to get from the sender to the target via five intermediaries. His results suggest that the social world possesses regularities tha...|$|R

5000|$|... "That Still Small Voice" [...] was {{the first}} Once Upon a Time episode written by {{consulting}} producer Jane Espenson.

[...] The episode was directed by Lost veteran Paul Edwards.
