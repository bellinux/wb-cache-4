The {{inventories}} performed within this project, were completed on an estate in Selesjö, northern Östergötland. This property {{is used to}} demonstrate wildlife management. The methods {{used in this study}} were originally developed for areas larger than individual properties. Three inventories were completed in the study. These included the recording of the number <b>of</b> <b>droppings</b> and the amount of eaten pasturage, as well as the level of damage on young trees. The inventory <b>of</b> <b>droppings</b> was used to approximate the size of the wildlife population and its recent development. The level of damage on young trees is a measure used by foresters to quantify the harmful impact of wildlife on forests intended for wood production. Low levels <b>of</b> <b>droppings</b> were found for all wild species investigated. The estimated population density for the different species varied from one to five animals per 1000 ha. These numbers were lower than expected. The amount of eaten pasturage was considered normal compared to other studies.

From the dilution of 10 - 4 of dropping sample, 0. 1 mL aliquot was transferred aseptically onto nutrient agar plates, spread and incubated at 370 C for 24 hours. Biochemical tests were carried out on pure isolates after subsequent sub cultures.

40|$|In recent decades, {{notably in}} {{large parts of}} the Western World, many {{waterfowl}} populations have increased because of increased food availability. Not uncommonly, eutrophication in these areas may occur perhaps not only because of increased dropping loads but also because nutrients are more readily released from droppings than from fresh and decomposing plant material. We conducted an experiment to study this effect comparing the decay rate and nutrient release of fresh grass leaves with that <b>of</b> <b>droppings</b> in water at 10, 20 and 30 °C. Using a two-component exponential decay model, allowing distinguishing between an easily decomposable (labile) and recalcitrant fraction of the material, we found that the labile carbon (C) fraction <b>of</b> <b>droppings</b> decomposed faster than that of grass leaves, whereas the recalcitrant C decomposition rate was similar to that of grass leaves. Higher temperature increased C decomposition rates of the labile fractions. No temperature dependence was observed for the recalcitrant fractions. Surprisingly, grass leaves and droppings did not differ in the amounts of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) released in the first 90 [*]days, i. e. more than 60 % of N and 40 % of P were released into the water column. Continuous mineralization of N and P predominated during decomposition of grass leaves, whereas a massive initial leaching was followed by immobilization and later mineralization during decomposition <b>of</b> <b>droppings.</b> All differences during decomposition of the litter types were attributed to the stoichiometric requirement of decomposers and their temperature sensitivity...|$|R

40|$|WET LITTER in poultry houses is {{a problem}} of {{considerable}} economic and pathological importance. Charles et al. (1942) reported that water can become a problem in poultry litter management. Eley and Hoffman (1949) suggested that the level of dietary protein may affect the amount of moisture in the droppings which should in turn directly affect the moisture content of the litter. James and Wheeler (1949) and Wheeler and James (1950) showed the amount of water consumed as well as the amount <b>of</b> <b>droppings</b> produced varied almost directly with the percent of protein in the diet. The direct association of the dietary protein content and the amount of water consumed are probably related to the well known fact that greater amounts of water are required for the metabolism of pro-tein than for carbohydrates or fats. A par-tial explanation for the relationship of pro-tein content of the diet to the amount <b>of</b> <b>droppings</b> produced may be that some of the extra weight <b>of</b> the <b>droppings</b> is due to increased elimination of nitrogen as uric acid.

40|$|Abstract: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the effect of the partial or total replacement of the inorganic Cu and Fe salts by organic forms of these elements on broiler performance and on the elimination of minerals through broiler droppings. A study was conducted for 42 days on 240 broiler chicks treated with trace elements chelates with amino acids: B-TRAXIMRTEC Cu-I 30; B-TRAXIMRTEC Fe- 120. The broiler chicks were housed in cages (10 chicks per cage, 6 cages per group) and assigned to 4 groups (C, E 1, E 3 and E 3) fed on the same corn-soybean meal-based diet. Phased-feeding was used according to the developmental stages of the broilers (starter, grower and finisher). Feed intake and the amount <b>of</b> <b>droppings</b> were recorded daily.
