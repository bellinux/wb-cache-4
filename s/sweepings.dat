40|$|Background: <b>Sweeping</b> is an {{important}} cleaning practice that is done either in standing or in recumbent position, but no empirical data exists {{on the scale of}} cardiovascular responses in these <b>sweeping</b> positions. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the cardiovascular responses and rated perceive exertion following <b>sweeping</b> in recumbent and standing positions. Methods: One hundred healthy volunteers (Mean age 25. 07 + 2. 24) performed <b>sweeping</b> in recumbent or standing positions at their self-selected pace using the natural fibre broom or plastic broom for a duration of five minutes each. Cardiovascular responses were monitored at rest and immediately after <b>sweeping</b> in each position. Results: This study showed significant increase in rated perceived exertion score following recumbent compared to standing and higher values of systolic blood pressure and heart rate following recumbent <b>sweeping</b> compared to the values in standing position. No significant difference in diastolic blood pressure at rest and following <b>sweeping</b> in recumbent and standing position was however observed. Conclusion: From ergonomic standpoint, <b>sweeping</b> in standing position could be preferable to <b>sweeping</b> in recumbent position...|$|R

500|$|By the 1890s, over 70,000long tons of {{excrement}} annually {{were being}} disposed {{of on the}} moss. [...] The land was a useful {{source of income for}} Manchester; for the year ending 31March 1900 the estate made a profit of £777 5s 2d (by comparison, the larger Chat Moss made £2,591 13s 4d). [...] Its success helped persuade Manchester Corporation to purchase 2,583acres of nearby Chat Moss in 1895. [...] By 1897, 37,082long tons of nightsoil, 587long tons of <b>sweepings</b> and litter and 11,673long tons of cinders were being sent to Carrington. [...] Various crops were grown on the land, including wheat, oats, potatoes and carrots. [...] A variety of ornamental shrubs, including rhododendrons, were grown in a nursery and used in the parks and gardens of Manchester.|$|E
500|$|Some pails were {{supplied}} with deodorants such as iron sulphate. [...] Manchester Corporation attempted {{to remove the}} smell of putrefaction by attaching cinder-sifters to their closets so that fine ash could be poured {{on top of the}} excrement. [...] The Goux system, invented in the 1860s by Pierre Nicholas Goux, a landowner near Paris, and widely used in France, overcame some of the more common problems associated with pail closets by lining the pail with an absorbent material. [...] The Rochdale Corporation experimented with Goux's design for several months but settled instead on a system which used smaller pails. [...] Goux's system did, however, find a home in Halifax, where it was used in more than 3,000closets after 1870. [...] The wooden pails used in Halifax were oval in cross-section (about 24 by 19inches) and 16inches deep. [...] Each was lined at the sides and bottom with a mixture of refuse, such as straw, grass, street <b>sweepings,</b> wool, hair, and even seaweed. [...] This lining, which was formed by a special mould and to which sulphate of lime was added, was designed to help remove the smell of urine, slow putrefaction and keep the excreta dry. [...] Pails were collected between 7am and 5:30pm. [...] Members of the public occasionally complained about the smell, which usually occurred when a pail was left to overflow, such as in winter 1875 when severe weather conditions prevented the horse-pulled collection wagons from reaching the closets.|$|E

2500|$|Around 1907, {{contractor}} Michael Degnon, whose firm {{constructed the}} Williamsburg Bridge, the Cape Cod Canal, and the Steinway subway tunnel (used by today's [...] ), purchased {{large tracts of}} marsh near Flushing Creek. At the time, the land was considered [...] "all but worthless". Degnon envisioned using the site to create a large industrial port around Flushing Bay, similar to a terminal he developed in Long Island City. By 1911, Degnon had created a plan along with the United States Department of War and the Queens Topographical Bureau. The plan envisioned widening Flushing River and creating docks for ships, with numerous factories and freight facilities. Meanwhile, the residential areas of Corona were expected to become the primary residence for factory workers.To create the port, beginning in 1910 Degnon proceeded to fill the land using household coal refuse ashes and street <b>sweepings</b> from Brooklyn. Degnon set up two companies of his own, {{one of which was}} contracted with the New York City Department of Sanitation. He also contracted the Brooklyn Ash Removal Company, owned {{by a member of the}} corrupt Tammany Hall political machine. Residential ash was collected via trolleys of the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company, and loaded onto freight trains which traveled via the Long Island Rail Road branches, or other trolleys, which hauled the refuse to Corona. The operation was referred to as a citywide refuse [...] "conveyor belt", while the trains were nicknamed the [...] "Talcum Powder Express" [...] because they often ran uncovered and deposited soot onto the surroundings. The northern end of the site was filled via now-conventional means, using dirt pumped from Flushing Bay which was being dredged to a lower depth. Material from the bay was extracted by an offshore hydraulic machine, and funneled through a [...] pipe across Northern Boulevard, before being deposited onto the wetlands. The filling for the north meadow was complete in 1916.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} the recursive <b>sweeping</b> preconditioner for the numerical {{solution of the}} Helmholtz equation in 3 D. This {{is based on the}} earlier work of the <b>sweeping</b> preconditioner with the moving perfectly matched layers (PMLs). The key idea is to apply the <b>sweeping</b> preconditioner recursively to the quasi- 2 D auxiliary problems introduced in the 3 D <b>sweeping</b> preconditioner. Compared to the non-recursive 3 D <b>sweeping</b> preconditioner, the setup cost of this new approach drops from O(N 4 / 3) to O(N), the application cost per iteration drops from O(N logN) to O(N), and the iteration count only increases mildly when combined with the standard GMRES solver. Several numerical examples are tested and the results are com-pared with the non-recursive <b>sweeping</b> preconditioner to demonstrate the efficiency of the new approach...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} the spin tunnelling of spin- 1 Bose-Einstein condensates in a linearly <b>sweeping</b> magnetic {{field with a}} mean-field treatment. We focus on the two typical alkali Bose atoms $^{ 87 }Rb$ and $^{ 23 }Na$ condensates and study their tunnelling dynamics according to different <b>sweeping</b> rates of external magnetic fields. In the adiabatic (i. e., slowly <b>sweeping)</b> and sudden (i. e., fast <b>sweeping)</b> limits, no tunnelling is observed. For the case of moderate <b>sweeping</b> rates, the tunnelling dynamics {{is found to be}} very sensitive on the <b>sweeping</b> rates with showing a chaotic-like tunnelling regime. With magnifying the regime, however, we find interestedly that the plottings become resolvable under a resolution of $ 10 ^{- 4 }$ G/s where the tunnelling probability with respect to the <b>sweeping</b> rate shows a regular periodic-like pattern. Moreover, a conserved quantity standing for the magnetization in experiments is found can dramatically affect the above picture of the spin tunnelling. Theoretically we have given a reasonable interpretation to the above findings and hope our studies would bring more attention to spin tunnelling experimentally. Comment: 8 pages, 15 figure...|$|R
40|$|Longitudinal {{velocity}} measurements above {{a uniform}} dry lakebed {{were carried out}} to investigate {{the applicability of the}} random <b>sweeping</b> decorrelation hypothesis to thermally stratified turbulent flow. The higher order velocity structure functions of order m were measured and modeled using the <b>sweeping</b> decorrelation hypothesis. In order to reduce the influence of Taylor's frozen hypothesis on the assessment of the <b>sweeping</b> decorrelation hypothesis, two dimensionless quantities, developed by Praskovsky et al. (1993), were used. Based on these dimensionless quantities, the <b>sweeping</b> decorrelation hypothesis predictions agreed well with the higher order structure function measurements. Assumptions inherent in the <b>sweeping</b> decorrelation hypothesis were also considered. It was found that strong interaction existed between the energy containing scales and the inertial subrange scales, indicating that the <b>sweeping</b> action alone does not fully describe the higher order structure function. Also, local temperature-velocity interactions were measured and found to be significant thus weakening the validity of the <b>sweeping</b> decorrelation hypothesis. However, these two interaction mechanisms appeared to be opposite in sign and counteracted each other...|$|R
