We {{investigated}} {{the reliability of}} a <b>slide</b> <b>test</b> in determining the presence of acute bacterial infections {{in a group of}} older adults to determine the usefulness of this test at the point of care.

We examined the white blood cell count (WBCC), the erythrocyte sedimentation, fibrinogen concentration, and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), in addition to the <b>slide</b> <b>test</b> that reveals the number of leukocytes and degree of erythrocyte aggregation. Results. There were 144 patients and 144 controls at a respective mean 6 standard deviation age of 71. 3 6 20. 7 and 70. 6 6 20. 2 years. A highly significant difference was noted between patients and controls in all laboratory markers, both conventional and those obtained by the <b>slide</b> <b>test.</b> By using hs-CRP, we correctly predicted the individual group as control or bacterial infection.

A positive latex test was obtained in 11 infants with verified septicaemia (positive blood culture), two infants with clinically evident infection but without bacteriological confirmation, one infant with recurrent chest infection due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and one infant who showed signs of birth asphyxia with meconium aspiration, but was not infected. Positive latex test results correlated with raised concentrations of C reactive protein, measured by immunoassay. In some instances, however, concentrations of C reactive protein in excess of 12 mg/ 100 ml gave weaker agglutination results in the <b>slide</b> <b>test,</b> which {{could be interpreted as}} negative results. In a sequential study of the infected infants, 6. 3 % of the values recorded on a <b>slide</b> <b>test</b> were false negatives.

30|$|The {{objective}} of this work is to investigate the influence of contact pressure and sliding speed on the coefficient of friction and wear of an activated carbon-epoxy composite derived from palm kernel under dry sliding conditions. A wear mode map approach was employed to identify the transitions from mild to severe wear of the composite. The dry <b>sliding</b> <b>test</b> was executed by utilizing a ball-on-disc tribometer at different contact pressures and sliding speeds with a constant sliding distance and operating temperature. The results showed that, regardless of the sliding speed, the friction coefficient and wear rate of the composite increased drastically when a critical limit of contact pressure is exceeded. As for the sliding speed, both the friction coefficient and wear rate increased first and thereafter decreased at a higher speed of 500 rpm. A wear mode map is proposed to classify the boundary from mild to severe wear regimes. The predominant wear failures identified include micro-crack, fine grooves, debonding, delamination, debris, broken carbon, and fracture.|$|E
