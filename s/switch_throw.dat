50|$|Pole {{refers to}} the number of common {{terminals}} within a given <b>switch.</b> <b>Throw</b> {{refers to the}} number of positions in which the switch may be placed to create a signal path or connection. Figure lA illustrates a single-pole, single-throw normally open switch (SPST NO). Figure 1B shows a single-pole, double-throw (SPDT) switch. One terminal is normally-open (NO) and the other is normally-closed (NC). Depending {{on the state of the}} switch, one or the other position is connected to the common terminal (COM). One signal path is broken before the other is connected, so this is referred to as a break-before-make configuration.|$|E

40|$|A {{modification}} to heterodimensional {{field effect}} transistors (HDFET) is introduced and demonstrated to provide novel switching capabilities.

If the device is fabricated on silicon germanium substrates, compatibility of the structure with conventional CMOS processing is achievable, allowing for new applications in digital, mixed signal, and high voltage switching...|$|R
