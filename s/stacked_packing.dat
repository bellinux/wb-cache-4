40|$|The heat-transfer {{behaviour}} of a counter-current gas-solid {{trickle flow}} contactor is studied, using coarse sand particles as the solids phase. Experimental {{data on the}} overall heat-transfer rate constant between the gas flow and the solid particle flow were obtained in a 0. 15 m square cross-section column packed with regularly <b>stacked</b> <b>packing</b> ele-men ts specially developed for dilute counter-current gas-solid contactors. Pressure drop over these packings is low, while counter-current heat-transfer properties are remark-able; for 0. 5 m of packing, the number of transfer units may amount to about 2 to 4, depending on the gas and solids mass flow rates and the packing construction used. Therefore, the present contactor might be attractive for application as a heat exchanger. The pressure drop caused by the solids flow and the heat-transfer rate constant show very similar behaviour and at low solids mass fluxes their values agree with the data ob-tained from,the single-particle flow model described in a previous paper [l]. Heat-transfer behaviour is described reasonably well by a model based on single-particle flow and by incorporating the effect of particle agglomeration at higher solids fluxes...|$|E
40|$|The {{hydrodynamic}} {{properties of}} counter-current gas-solid flow over a regularly <b>stacked</b> <b>packing</b> at trickle flow conditions have been studied. The flow {{properties of the}} solids phase were examined, using five types of solid particles with a mean particle diameter ranging from 70 to 880 pm and a particle density from 800 to 7800 kg mW 3. Data on the solids hold-up and the pressure drop caused by the solids flow were obtained from experiments in a test column of 0. 10 m square cross-section. A particle flow model has been developed based on the momentum equation of a single particle. In this model, particles are assumed to collide regularly with the packing and the mean particle velocity has been derived by taking account of the acceler-ation due to gravity and the drag forces exerted by the upward gas flow. The experi-mental data are described reasonably well by this model {{in the case of}} trickle flow of coarse particles. On the other hand, the flow behaviour of small particles is substantially influenced by particle shielding and solids agglomeration phenomena, resulting in slip velocities well above the single-particle terminal velocity. Generally, the dmg force exerted by the particles on the gas flow is smaller than the net gravitational force for both small and large particles, although for different reasons. As a consequence, the pressure drop caused by the solids flow is generally below the value to be expected for fully suspended particles...|$|E

50|$|The column can {{be filled}} with random dumped packing (creating a random packed column) or with {{structured}} packing sections, which are arranged or stacked (creating a <b>stacked</b> <b>packed</b> column). In the column, liquids tend to wet {{the surface of the}} packing and the vapors pass across this wetted surface, where mass transfer takes place. Packing material can be used instead of trays to improve separation in distillation columns. Packing offers the advantage of a lower pressure drop across the column (when compared to plates or trays), which is beneficial while operating under vacuum. Differently shaped packing materials have different surface areas and void space between the packing. Both of these factors affect packing performance.|$|R

A typical commuter return journey between Stratford Upon Avon and Birmingham is investigated. The fuel cell <b>stack</b> and battery <b>pack</b> behaviour is assessed for different stack sizes, battery sizes and control strategies to evaluate the performance of the overall system with the aim of understanding the optimum component configuration.

40|$|ABSTRACT: A set of subsites in barnase {{has been}} {{proposed}} from kinetic studies. A specific substrate analog, the tetradeoxynucleotide, CGAC, has been designed from this information. We report the crystal structure of its complex with barnase a t 1. 76 -A resolution. The structure was solved by molecular replacement from a model of free barnase and refined to a crystallographic R factor of 19. 0 %. The stoichiometry of the asymmetric unit dimeric complex is [barnase:d(CGAC) ]z, with 2 -fold noncrystallographic symmetry. Each barnase molecule binds one oligonucleotide, whereby the recognition site is occupied by guanine, and all three phosphate groups of the nucleotide make electrostatic interactions with basic residues in a strongly electropositive region a t {{the bottom of the}} active site. The active-site His 102 packs against the adenine base of the nucleotide in an almost identical manner to the guanine base in the barnased(GpC) complex and defines a possible subsite in the Michaelis complex. The overall protein structure is unchanged on forming the complex with d(CGAC), but there are small differences in the active site and in crystal packing regions. The protein coordinates will be useful for theoretical calculations since some disorder induced by packing constraints in the crystals of the free enzyme are absent in the crystals of the complex. The interface of the dimer is formed by a Hisl 02 -adenine-adenine-His 102 face-to-face ring stack directly on the 2 -fold axis.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{provided}} a novel maximised {{approach to the}} generation of accurate, comprehensive, consensus sequences of the expressed human genome, we have developed and produced a system for a novel-representation, broad gene coverage, consensus database of expressed human gene fragments (ESTs). To perform clustering of ESTs, we have developed and employed D 2 -cluster, an algorithm based on the d 2 -search algorithm (Hide et al. 1994) speci cally for EST clustering. D 2 -cluster does not require alignment in order to perform clustering (Burke, Davison and Hide, in prep). We have incorporated d 2 -cluster into a portable and novel system to perform clustering, alignment and automated error analysis of publicly available expressed sequence tags (<b>STACK</b> <b>PACK).</b> The system includes a statistically robust algorithm that can detect and compensate for error within an aligned cluster of ESTs. We have manufactured a database of partial human consensus sequences from 552 013 ESTs from dbEST 040896 and TIGR. The database is termed Sequence Tag Alignment and Consensus Knowledgebase (STACK). STACK 1. 0 contains 18 divisions based on tissue annotation identifying 204 431 unique sequences and generating 76 131 consensi which represent 321 134 ESTs. The consensus sequences have an average length of 497 bases, a 39 % increase over the 357 base average length of the input data set. Clone Ids are used to join 92 759 unique sequences and 48 858 consensi into 61 632 linked sequences, averaging 900 bases each. The distribution of clusters compares favourably with UniGene, re ecting the di erence in methodology of clustering and the higher input number of sequences into STACK. SANIGENE high accuracy database is also generated, consisting of sequences which agree inatleast two ESTs. STACK is a distributable, core information resource upon which a comprehensive knowledgebase can be built. ...|$|R
