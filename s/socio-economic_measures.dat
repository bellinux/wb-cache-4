However, the paucity of local {{information}} on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) does not allow us to address this public health challenge. In order to rectify this deficiency and complement international research, we undertook a study with 281 Type 2 Black diabetic patients and 437 controls, with no self-reported chronic conditions, to ascertain HRQOL. We used the SF- 20 to measure functioning, general health, wellbeing and bodily pain (HRQOL). It was hypothesised that diabetes mellitus significantly affects functioning, general health and well-being. Multiple analyses of covariance controlled for age, schooling, marital status, employment status and commodity ownership (a <b>socio-economic</b> <b>measure).</b> Patients were significantly more likely to report poorer role functioning, poorer general health and more pain than controls, providing partial support for the hypothesis. Reliability (internal consistency) coefficients on the four multi-item SF- 20 sub-scales ranged between 0. 79 (well-being), 0. 81 (general health), 0. 83 (physical functioning) and 0. 94 (role functioning) for patients; for controls these coefficients ranged between 0. 70 (well-being), 0. 78 (general health), 0. 80 (physical functioning) and 0. 90 (role functioning). Inter-correlations among the sub-scales were significant for patients and controls (p = 0. 01).

40|$|Abstract Background There are {{well-established}} socio-economic {{differences in}} the prevalence of smoking in the UK, but conventional <b>socio-economic</b> <b>measures</b> may not capture the range and degree of these associations. We have used a commercial geodemographic profiling system, Mosaic, to explore associations with smoking prevalence in a large primary care dataset and to establish whether this tool provides new insights into socio-economic determinants of smoking. Methods We analysed anonymised data on over 2 million patients from The Health Improvement Network (THIN) database, linked via patients' postcodes to Mosaic classifications (11 groups and 61 types) and quintiles of Townsend Index of Multiple Deprivation. Patients' current smoking status was identified using Read Codes, and logistic regression was used to explore the associations between the available measures of socioeconomic status and smoking prevalence. Results As anticipated, smoking prevalence increased with increasing deprivation according to the Townsend Index (age and sex adjusted OR for highest vs lowest quintile 2. 96, 95 % CI 2. 92 - 2. 99). There were more marked differences in prevalence across Mosaic groups (OR for group G vs group A 4. 41, 95 % CI 4. 33 - 4. 49). Across the 61 Mosaic types, smoking prevalence varied from 8. 6 % to 42. 7 %. Mosaic types with high smoking prevalence were characterised by relative deprivation, but also more specifically by single-parent households living in public rented accommodation in areas with little community support, having no access to a car, few qualifications and high TV viewing behaviour. Conclusion Conventional <b>socio-economic</b> <b>measures</b> may underplay social disparities in smoking prevalence. Newer classification systems, such as Mosaic, encompass {{a wider range of}} demographic, lifestyle and behaviour data, and are valuable in identifying characteristics of groups of heavy smokers which might be used to tailor cessation interventions. </p...|$|E

40|$|Social {{factors have}} been linked to {{patterns}} of alcohol use amongst women. However, conflicting evidence on the ways in which socio-economic circumstances are linked to women’s alcohol use impedes our understanding. Interest in women’s alcohol use has moved up the policy agenda in recent years. Nevertheless, an examination of the literature revealed a dearth of contemporary UK specific research and few qualitative or mixed/multi-methods studies. Furthermore, the existing literature framed women’s alcohol use as a public health issue focused on a small minority of ‘risky’ drinkers and fails to attend to differences amongst groups of women according to their social circumstances, including {{whether or not they were}} mothers. Using a multi-method approach, this thesis aims to enhance our understanding of everyday patterns and perceptions of alcohol use amongst mothers with pre-school aged children by including the majority of mothers who drink moderate amounts of alcohol infrequently, as well as the minority who engage in ‘risky’ alcohol use. The research is UK focused thus enabling us to contextualise the findings and increase our understanding of alcohol use amongst mothers with pre-school aged children in the UK. Alcohol use varied depending on the <b>socio-economic</b> <b>measure</b> used. Social gradients were evident for drinking frequency, quantity, and ‘risky’ alcohol use amongst mothers with pre-school aged children. Qualitative data obtained from focus group discussions with advantaged and disadvantaged mothers helped explain to some extent the social patterning of alcohol use evident in the quantitative analysis of the MCS (Millennium Cohort Study) and, provided a unique portrayal of the ways in which alcohol was integrated into the daily lives of women with children. ...|$|R

40|$|Examining the {{geographical}} pattern of temporal changes in infant mortality rates illustrates the methodological problems of documenting and understanding temporal changes in any spatial pattern of disease. Early research on geographical differences in infant mortality rates showed strong ecological correlations with socio-economic {{factors such as}} poverty rates. More recent research established relationships between individual-level socio-economic values and probabilities of death. With geographic information available {{at the level of}} individuals, it is possible to estimate the probabilities of death on a person-by-person basis from knowledge of the relationships between individual factors and <b>socio-economic</b> <b>measures.</b> These estimated probabilities provide an expected geographic pattern of deaths. The difference between the observed spatial pattern and the expected pattern is the remaining spatial variation adjusted for this knowledge. For the study area, individual factors and some <b>socio-economic</b> <b>measures</b> were available for each year of the study period. Using data from the Iowa Birth Defects Registry and the Iowa Department of Public Health (USA), I tested the stability and continuity of these cross-sectional relationships and investigated whether any temporal lags in these variables relate to the unexplained spatial variations in infant mortality rates that remain. I accounted for the 'Change of Support Problem' [Gotway C. A. & Young L. J. (2002). Combining incompatible spatial data. Journal of the American Statistical Association, 97458, 632 - 648] inherent in frame-based geographical analysis. The analysis involved a generalized linear model (GLM) to estimate individual risks and a Monte Carlo simulation model to generate the non-linear probability density functions for disease rates whose densities are theoretically intractable. Results show the temporal changes in the observed spatial pattern and the expected spatial pattern differ by geographic location. In conclusion such differences are the result of a combination of unexplained place-based risk and unmeasured individual risks.

Since family functioning is primarily defined by broadband variables like cohesion or support, which represent family functioning as a whole, {{it is necessary to}} carry out a more fine-grained analysis of the family variables that are involved in the development of depressive symptoms at these ages. This study examined the relations between the family variables included in the MacMaster Model of Family Functioning (MMFF) and adolescents’ depressive symptoms, as well as the moderating effects of socio-demographic characteristics. Participants were 643 adolescents aged 12 to 18 years (49 % male) drawn from secondary schools in Málaga (Spain). They completed the Family Assessment Device, which assesses the MMFF variables: problem solving, communication, roles, affective responsiveness, affective involvement and behavior control; the Beck Depression Inventory; the Beck Hopelessness Scale; and a <b>socio-economic</b> <b>measure.</b> The analytic strategy used was regression analysis, testing moderation and mediation effects. Results showed that both family functioning as a whole and each MMFF variable, as well as socio-economic status (SES), predicted adolescents’ depressive symptoms. In addition, gender moderated the relation of family behavior control and roles with depressive symptoms. Moreover, age moderated the relation between family affective involvement and depressive symptoms. Also, SES moderated the relation of family behavior control, roles, communication and affective responsiveness with depressive symptoms. Finally, both family functioning and SES contributed to hopelessness, which partially mediated the effect of family functioning on depressive symptoms, and totally mediated the effect of SES on depressive symptoms. These results point to the importance of identifying the family variables that are relevant for the design of interventions to prevent affective disturbances in adolescents with different socio-demographic characteristics. The effect of low family SES on adolescents’ depressive symptoms through the development of hopelessness should also be targeted. Universidad de Málaga.
