40|$|One {{method of}} {{measuring}} {{the prices of}} deposit and loan services is to view the differentials between actual loan and deposit interest rates and appropriate “reference rates ” as the “indirectly measured prices of deposit and loan services. ” In fact, the ONS in the UK and the BLS in the US are considering the adoption {{of this type of}} estimation method for their measurements of deposit and loan <b>services</b> <b>prices.</b> This paper reviews the prior research at the ONS and BLS, identifies the problem points, and examines the feasibility of using published interest rate data “of a constant quality ” to indirectly measure deposit and loan <b>services</b> <b>prices</b> in Japan. The conclusions show: (1) published interest rate data that is indicative and “of a constant quality ” is not available for certain lending rates; and (2) there are logical inconsistencies between the published-interest-rate-data-based method for measuring deposit and loan <b>service</b> <b>prices</b> which is examined in this paper and the input-output tables, which are presently utilized to determine the weights of individual <b>service</b> <b>prices</b> in the Corporate <b>Service</b> <b>Price</b> Index (CSPI).

40|$|Graduation date: 1993 In {{explaining}} why <b>service</b> <b>prices</b> differ across countries (both {{developed and developing}} countries), most studies have {{paid attention to the}} role of structural variables such as population, trade balance, resource abundance etc., by using a full employment assumption. Due to the existence of high urban unemployment in developing countries, the assumption of full employment is not suitable. The objective {{of this study is to}} build general equilibrium models that can be used to explain the <b>service</b> <b>price</b> differences across developing countries by incorporating rural-urban migration and urban unemployment. Internal migration from rural to urban areas is allowed because of distortions in labor market. The current work includes structural variables that are used in the literature, such as agricultural land, mineral resources, labor endowment, trade deficit, population, and tourism, along with 2 new variables, manufacturing capital and services capital. This study also considers the effects of macroeconomic policies (fiscal and monetary policies) on <b>service</b> <b>prices</b> which are neglected in the literature. The theoretical models suggest that, ceteris paribus, larger land area, mineral resources, higher trade deficits, tourist receipts, and money supply increase <b>service</b> <b>prices,</b> but larger populations reduce <b>service</b> <b>prices.</b> The effects of services capital, labor force, the terms of trade, and government spending are ambiguous from the theoretical models. An empirical study is performed to test the theoretical implications. The empirical results suggest that larger endowments of land, mineral resources, manufacturing capital, labor force, and services capital, as well as higher trade deficits, tourist receipts, government spending, and money supply increase the <b>service</b> <b>prices.</b> Conversely, larger populations reduce <b>service</b> <b>prices</b> as predicted...|$|R

In the coming months and years, there will be no need to have both a computer and a TV set for interactive television as the interactive content will be built into the system via the next generation of set-top boxes.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study is to {{investigate}} first, the relationship between the customer satisfaction and brand switching intention into the Saudi Arabian mobile-service market, and second, the association of service quality, customer service, <b>service</b> <b>pricing,</b> and value-added services with the customer satisfaction. Because of the difficulty of having a frame for the mobile-service customers from their providers, a convenience sample of 350 online respondents with the proper surveying techniques was used in data analysis and testing of the research hypotheses. The findings of the study confirm a significant negative relationship between customer satisfaction and brand switching intention. A 4 % percent of the change in brand switching intention could be explained by the change in the customer satisfaction. Only three variables; customer service, <b>service</b> <b>pricing,</b> and service quality are critical determinants for mobile-service customer satisfaction. Customer service explained about 22 %, whereas <b>service</b> <b>pricing</b> and service quality explained about 5 % and 1 % of the change in customer satisfaction respectively. The practical value of this study could be enabling the mobile-service providers in Saudi Arabia to well understand the determinants of the customer satisfaction and its negative relationship with brand switching intention. They may take these findings into account when setting marketing strategies to differentiate their brands to satisfy the customer needs and wants, to retain the existing customers and to attract new customers. These strategies {{have a positive effect on}} the company’s customer satisfaction that deter brand switching intention, hence increase the company’s competitiveness, market share and profitability...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In QoS-aware service selection, {{a service}} {{requester}} seeks to maximize its utility by selecting a service provider that charges the lowest <b>service</b> <b>price</b> while meeting the requester’s QoS requirements. In existing selection approaches, a service requester focuses on finding providers {{based on their}} QoS and thereby ignores their <b>service</b> <b>prices</b> that could change with their QoS. High QoS may provide more benefits, but may require a high <b>service</b> <b>price.</b> As a result, the highest QoS may not produce the maximum utility. A service requester and candidate service providers have a conflicting interest over <b>service</b> <b>prices.</b> Since a provider would not reveal its minimum acceptable price, {{it is important for}} a requester to predict the minimum <b>price</b> for a <b>service</b> that meets its QoS requirements. We propose a collaborative approach to predicting a provider’s minimum price for a desired QoS based on prior usage experience. The experimental results show our approach can find the optimal service providers efficiently and effectively. I...|$|R
40|$|Because of {{the need}} to develop {{specific}} measurement scales for different services industries, this study aimed to empirically develop a reliable and valid model specifically for measuring mobile telecommunication service quality. A multidimensional measurement model (MS-Qual) has been proposed based on an extensive literature review and then, to assess the model validity, convergent and discriminant validity have been established based on the survey data gathered from 363 of Iranian mobile phone subscribers. Findings of this study showed that customers form their service quality perceptions based on their evaluations of seven primary dimensions including: network quality, value-added <b>service,</b> <b>pricing</b> plans, employees ‟ competency, billing system, customer services, and service convenience. This study has several practical implications. First, practitioners could use developed MS-Qual scale for measuring and managing service quality in the mobile telecommunication sector. Second, this study showed that customers ‟ evaluation of value-added <b>service,</b> <b>pricing</b> plans and service convenience are most important factors in their overall perceived service quality.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the pricing of offerings {{in an industrial}} context. The purpose of this thesis is to give {{suggestions on how to}} develop the pricing of products and services in the case company. The main research question is: What changes and upgrades are needed towards successful product and <b>service</b> <b>pricing</b> in the case company? The objective is to identify the elements relevant to the pricing of offerings, to estimate how suc-cessfully the elements are implemented in the case company, and to give suggestions for the case company on how to develop their product and <b>service</b> <b>pricing</b> as part of sales. In this research, a constructive research approach was used where the empirical data were collected through semi-structured interviews and observations. The theoretical part of the study {{examines the}} relevant elements in the pricing literature. Based on the litera-ture review an initial framework for <b>service</b> <b>pricing</b> was built to direct the analysis of the empirical data. The empirical part of the research studied the pricing elements de-rived from both the case company’s pricing practices and from previous literature. The main findings of the research were that the case company is considering all of the pricing elements identified in the literature. There were also three new pricing elements found in the empirical research which emerged from interviews and observation rounds. The most important pricing elements proposed for development due to their current weak implementation were: the IT systems, pricing guidelines, and cost estimation. Al-so other improvement needs were identified concerning the other pricing elements and, therefore, a three step process is suggested, to cover the promotion of all the pricing elements needing development in the future. Possible future research topics could study the use of the newly identified elements in the pricing of offerings...|$|E
