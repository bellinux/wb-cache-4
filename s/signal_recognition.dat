This work is divided over three major areas, the CRISPR system, RNA interference, and translational control via MicroRNAs.|$|E
25|$|In prokaryotes {{translation}} generally {{occurs at}} the point of transcription (co-transcriptionally), often using a messenger RNA that is {{still in the process of}} being created. In eukaryotes translation can occur in a variety of regions of the cell depending on where the protein being written is supposed to be. Major locations are the cytoplasm for soluble cytoplasmic proteins and the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum for proteins that are for export from the cell or insertion into a cell membrane. Proteins that are supposed to be expressed at the endoplasmic reticulum are recognised part-way through the translation process. This is governed by the <b>signal</b> <b>recognition</b> particle—a protein that binds to the ribosome and directs it to the endoplasmic reticulum when it finds a signal peptide on the growing (nascent) amino acid chain.|$|E
25|$|SHH {{undergoes}} {{a series of}} processing steps before it is secreted from the cell. Newly synthesised SHH weighs 45kDa and {{is referred to as}} the preproprotein. As a secreted protein it contains a short signal sequence at its N-terminus, which is recognised by the <b>signal</b> <b>recognition</b> particle during the translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the first step in protein secretion. Once translocation is complete, the signal sequence is removed by signal peptidase in the ER. There SHH {{undergoes a}}utoprocessing to generate a 20kDa N-terminal signaling domain (SHH-N) and a 25kDa C-terminal domain with no known signaling role. The cleavage is catalysed by a protease within the C-terminal domain. During the reaction, a cholesterol molecule is added to the N-terminus of SHH-N. Thus the C-terminal domain acts as an intein and a cholesterol transferase. Another hydrophobic moiety, a palmitate, is added to the alpha-amine of N-terminal cysteine of SHH-N. This modification is required for efficient signaling, resulting in a 30-fold increase in potency over the non-palmitylated form, and is carried out by a member of the membrane-bound O-acyltransferase family, Protein-cysteine N-palmitoyltransferase, HHAT.|$|E

25|$|Thylakoid {{proteins}} {{are targeted}} to their destination via signal peptides and prokaryotic-type secretory pathways inside the chloroplast. Most thylakoid proteins encoded by a plant's nuclear genome need two targeting signals for proper localization: An N-terminal chloroplast targeting peptide (shown in yellow in the figure), {{followed by a}} thylakoid targeting peptide (shown in blue). Proteins are imported through the translocon of outer and inner membrane (Toc and Tic) complexes. After entering the chloroplast, the first targeting peptide is cleaved off by a protease processing imported proteins. This unmasks the second targeting signal and the protein is exported from the stroma into the thylakoid in a second targeting step. This second step requires the action of protein translocation components of the thylakoids and is energy-dependent. Proteins are inserted into the membrane via the SRP-dependent pathway (1), the Tat-dependent pathway (2), or spontaneously via their transmembrane domains (not shown in figure). Lumenal proteins are exported across the thylakoid membrane into the lumen by either the Tat-dependent pathway (2) or the Sec-dependent pathway (3) and released by cleavage from the thylakoid targeting signal. The different pathways utilize different signals and energy sources. The Sec (secretory) pathway requires ATP as energy source and consists of SecA, which binds to the imported protein and a Sec membrane complex to shuttle the protein across. Proteins with a twin arginine motif in their thylakoid signal peptide are shuttled through the Tat (twin arginine translocation) pathway, which requires a membrane-bound Tat complex and the pH gradient as an energy source. Some other proteins are inserted into the membrane via the SRP (<b>signal</b> <b>recognition</b> particle) pathway. The chloroplast SRP can interact with its target proteins either post-translationally or co-translationally, thus transporting imported proteins {{as well as those}} that are translated inside the chloroplast. The SRP pathway requires GTP and the pH gradient as energy sources. Some transmembrane proteins may also spontaneously insert into the membrane from the stromal side without energy requirement.|$|E
500|$|In {{the house}} mouse, the major MUP gene cluster {{provides}} a highly polymorphic scent signal of genetic identity. [...] Wild mice breeding freely in semi-natural enclosures showed inbreeding avoidance. [...] This avoidance {{resulted from a}} strong deficit in successful matings between mice sharing both MUP haplotypes (complete match). In another study, using white-footed mice, {{it was found that}} when mice derived from wild populations were inbred there was reduced survival when such mice were reintroduced into a natural habitat. [...] These findings suggest that inbreeding reduces fitness, and that scent <b>signal</b> <b>recognition</b> has evolved in mice as a means of avoiding inbreeding depression.|$|E
2500|$|The {{surface of}} the rough {{endoplasmic}} reticulum (often abbreviated RER or Rough ER) (also called granular endoplasmic reticulum) is studded with protein-manufacturing ribosomes giving it a [...] "rough" [...] appearance (hence its name). The binding site of the ribosome on the rough endoplasmic reticulum is the translocon. However, the ribosomes are not a stable part of this organelle's structure as they are constantly being bound and released from the membrane. A ribosome only binds to the RER once a specific protein-nucleic acid complex forms in the cytosol. [...] This special complex forms when a free ribosome begins translating the mRNA of a protein destined for the secretory pathway. The first 5–30 amino acids polymerized encode a signal peptide, a molecular message that is recognized and bound by a <b>signal</b> <b>recognition</b> particle (SRP). Translation pauses and the ribosome complex binds to the RER translocon where translation continues with the nascent (new) protein forming into the RER lumen and/or membrane. The protein is processed in the ER lumen by an enzyme (a signal peptidase), which removes the signal peptide. Ribosomes at this point may be released back into the cytosol; however, non-translating ribosomes are also known to stay associated with translocons.|$|E

As a speech signal separated from a mixture of speech signals includes the leakage from other speech <b>signals,</b> <b>recognition</b> performance of the separated speech degrades. An important problem is estimating the leakage in time-frequency components. Once the leakage is estimated, we can generate missing feature masks (MFM) automatically by using our method.
