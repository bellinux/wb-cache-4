5000|$|A benefit {{dependency}} network (BDN) is a <b>structured</b> <b>diagram</b> that visualizes multiple cause-effect relationships between capabilities, changes and benefits. It {{can be considered}} a business-oriented method of what engineers would call goal modeling and is usually read from right to left to provide a one page overview, starting with the high level drivers for change, such as found with Digital Initiatives or cross-organizational ERP management. First proposed by Cranfield School of Management as part of a Benefits Management approach [...] the original approach has expanded to encompass all the domains required for Benefits Management [...] namely Why, What, Who and How. Recent developments have added weights to the connections to create a weighted graph so that causal analysis, sometimes referred to as causality, is possible on the represented value chains. These chains provide a way to construct a compelling story or message that shows how the benefits proposed can be realized from the changes being considered.|$|E

The framework uses grammar to describe the context, i. e., the positional relationship between handwritten strokes and other objects, {{which can be used}} to interpret ambiguous results of pattern matching, and to describe the syntax of the target diagrams.

40|$|AbstractWe {{present a}} general homotopical {{analysis}} of <b>structured</b> <b>diagram</b> spaces {{and discuss the}} relation to symmetric spectra.

We show that the category of I-spaces provides a convenient model for the homotopy category of spaces in which every E∞ space can be rectified to a strictly commutative monoid. Similarly, the commutative monoids {{in the category of}} J-spaces model graded E∞ spaces. Using the theory of J-spaces we introduce the graded units of a symmetric ring spectrum.

40|$|In {{chemical}}/biological research, {{the chemical}} structure database {{is widely used}} to find the detailed information of molecules of interest. However, current chemical structure database does not provide link to the relevant literature which may contain more up-to-date information. Hence, by annotating each molecule in the database {{with one or more}} relevant links to the scientific literature, the database would be a more useful resource to bio/chemical research scientists [1]. In general, the chemical <b>structure</b> <b>diagram</b> in a scientific article can be considered as keywords representing the main content of the article.

40|$|Purpose. This review {{gives an}} {{overview}} of the current state of research regarding the effectiveness of mirror therapy in upper extremity function. Method. A systematic literature search was performed to identify studies concerning mirror therapy in upper extremity. The included journal articles were reviewed according to a <b>structured</b> <b>diagram</b> and the methodological quality was assessed. Results. Fifteen studies were identified and reviewed. Five different patient categories were studied: two studies focussed on mirror therapy after an amputation of the upper limb, five studies focussed on mirror therapy after stroke, five studies focussed on mirror therapy with complex regional pain syndrome type 1 (CRPS 1) patients, one study on mirror therapy with complex regional pain syndrome type 2 (CRPS 2) and two studies focussed on mirror therapy after hand surgery other than amputation. Conclusions. Most of the evidence for mirror therapy is from studies with weak methodological quality. The present review showed a trend that mirror therapy is effective in upper limb treatment of stroke patients and patients with CRPS, whereas the effectiveness in other patient groups has yet to be determined...|$|E
40|$|Ensuring {{resilient}} {{operation and}} control of smart grids is fundamental for empowering their deployment, but challenging at the same time. Accordingly, this study proposes a novel methodology for evaluating resilience of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) systems for smart distribution grids. Analysing how the system behaves under changing operating conditions a power system perspective allows to understand how resilient the smart distribution grid is, but the resilience of the ICT system in charge of its operation affects the overall performance {{of the system and}} does, therefore, condition its resilience. With the aim of systematising the evaluation of ICT systems’ resilience, this study proposes to combine a standardized modelling of Smart Grids, the Smart Grid Architecture Model (SGAM), with a data <b>structured</b> <b>diagram,</b> the Entity Relationship Model (ERM). The architecture of smart distribution grids is analysed through SGAM. Then, their technical characteristics and functionalities are defined and represented in a ERM diagram. Finally, the attributes or properties of the system components are used to formulate resilience indicators against different types of disturbances. This methodology is then applied to analyse the resilience of a ICT platform being developed in EMPOWER H 2020 project. Postprint (published version...|$|E
40|$|A {{growing concern}} to be tackled {{today is the}} {{potential}} {{contamination of water resources}} by chemicals-including pharmaceuticals entering food chains and causing adverse effects in animals and humans. In this paper 75 publications from the years 2000 - 2004 are analysed concerning their information on 12 chosen pharmaceuticals. These pharmaceuticals are recognised as potential pollutants to the media water and soil. A 12 x 75 data-matrix is the basis for a mathematical evaluation (ranking) approach using the Method of Evaluation by Order Theory (METEOR). The original data-matrix of 12 objects and 75 attributes is subject to several logical aggregation steps applying the Hasse Diagram Technique. It can be demonstrated that the aggregation to get three super indicators concerning different kinds of journals leads to a highly <b>structured</b> <b>diagram</b> with more comparabilities than incomparabilities. The aggregation steps with different weights, normalisation to 1 lead to linear order diagrams. These diagrams all show that the following ranking of the objects EES>IBU>BEZ>ROX>MET>FEN is given in all the linear order diagrams. All partial order diagrams and linear order diagrams demonstrate that the pharmaceutical EES: Estinyl Estradiol is always in a maximal position whereas FEN: Fenofibrate is always a minimal object. 1 Contamination of Water and Soil with Pharmaceutical...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a new tool (P-Coder) that {{can assist in}} the teaching of Object – Oriented (O-O) programming concepts to novices. It builds on a pseudocode model that focuses on the most basic computational principles of sequence, iteration, selection and recursion. These are developed within an O-O framework that provides several views of the model: a Design View where the user interacts with the model to design the program (algorithms and structure); a Class View where the class structure can be visualised; a Code View where the generated code can be inspected, compiled and executed; and an Object View where objects can be instantiated from the defined classes. P-Coder provides a complete environment to demonstrate and implement many O-O concepts for novice users. There is a focus on developing an understanding of basic principles through a graphic/text based pseudocode notation representing the key program elements in a tree <b>structured</b> <b>diagram.</b> Users are able to design and build complete programs, compile and execute them in the normal way. Interactive object instantiation is also supported, allowing users to create, inspect and manipulate objects in their runtime state. This provides a useful perspective in teaching where the distinctions between Classes and Objects are often left confused...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The hypothesis of the research is "conceptual graphs are a suitable knowledge-base decision support tool for use by managemenat ccountants in strategic planning", explained as follows. Knowledge-based approaches can help accountants apply their skills {{in the direction of}} strategic management problems. Such problem domains cannot be modelled effectively by computer alone, hence we are only interested in those advanced knowledge-based methodologies that can be adequately reviewed by strategic management accountants in the light of their own continually changing tacit and implicit knowledge. <b>Structured</b> <b>diagram</b> techniques, such as flowcharting, are well known by accountants and are a clearly understandable yet important aid in problem review. Apart from being founded on a logically complete reasoning system, the knowledge-based methodology of conceptual graphs was formulated to be an enhancement of these other methods. Furthermore the graphical form of conceptual graphs enjoy an apparent similarity to the 'negating' brackets in the accountant's traditional bookkeeping model. After conducting a comparative study with two similar methodologies in current use showing the technical advantages of conceptual graphs, the Conceptual Analysis and Review Environment computer software was devised and implemented. CARE was used to test the - accepted graphical form of conceptual graphs through a series of user evaluation sessions. The evaluations started out with subjects from the conceptual graphs community itself, then key business school staff, and culminated in a session with senior practising accountants. In addition, CARE was enhanced iteratively in accordance with the results of each evaluation session. Despite their strong prima facie attractiveness and positive response from the conceptual graphs community session, as the user evaluations progressed it became increasingly evident that the inherent complexity of conceptual graphs fundamentally undern-tined them as a viable tool, other than for very trivial problems well below the level needed to be viable for strategic management accountancy. Therefore the original contribution of this research is that its hypothesis turns out to be false...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. UML-RT is an {{extension}} of UML for modelling embedded re-active and real-time software systems. Its particular focus lies on system descriptions on the architectural level, dening the overall system structure. In this paper we propose to use UML-RT <b>structure</b> <b>diagrams</b> together with the formal method CSP-OZ combining CSP and Object-Z. While CSP-OZ is used for specifying the system components themselves (by CSP-OZ classes), UML-RT diagrams provide the architecture description. Thus the usual ar-chitecture specication in terms of the CSP operators parallel composition, renaming and hiding is replaced by a graphical description. To preserve the formal semantics of CSP-OZ specications, we develop a translation from UML-RT <b>structure</b> <b>diagrams</b> to CSP. Besides achieving a more easily ac-cessible, graphical architecture modelling for CSP-OZ, we thus also give a semantics to UML-RT <b>structure</b> <b>diagrams.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. An {{overall goal}} of the INCOSE MBSE {{initiative}} is to provide SysML with a formal semantics and to integrate reasoning services as part of system engineering. UML class diagrams have been encoded as Knowledge Bases (KB) within the Description Logic (DL), ALCQI. The encoding provides a formal semantics for class diagrams which accords with the informal semantics. The encoding applies to SysML which is a profile of UML.
