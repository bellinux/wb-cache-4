50|$|Baltimore has a {{rotative}} duplex donkey pump, duplex feed pump, duplex <b>sanitary</b> <b>pump</b> and a centrifugal circulating pump. The {{pump system}} provides a moderate fire fighting capability through two hose standpipes {{on top of}} the pilothouse. Piping runs to each compartment allow water to be forced out through air pressure in the event of flooding.|$|E
5000|$|Fresh {{water is}} {{produced}} by either an evaporator or a reverse osmosis unit. The primary use for fresh water is to provide feedwater for the reactor and steam propulsion plants. It is also available for showers, sinks, cooking and cleaning once propulsion plant needs have been met. Seawater is used to flush toilets, and the resulting [...] "black water" [...] is stored in a sanitary tank until it is blown overboard using pressurized air or pumped overboard by using a special <b>sanitary</b> <b>pump.</b> The blackwater-discharge system is difficult to operate, and the German Type VIIC boat [...] was lost with casualties because of human error while using this system. Water from showers and sinks is stored separately in [...] "grey water" [...] tanks and discharged overboard using drain pumps.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the usual feed and bilge pumping engines, the machinery department was fitted with oil lubricating pumps which serviced the turbine bearings, <b>sanitary</b> <b>pumps,</b> water heater, ash hoist and fresh water pumps.|$|R
50|$|Dixon SanitaryManufacturer of {{stainless}} steel <b>sanitary</b> fittings, <b>pumps</b> and valves used in food processing, dairy, beverage, cosmetic, pharmaceutical and select industrial markets. Dixon Sanitary also provides custom in-house automation of sanitary ball, butterfly, single seat rising stem and mix proof rising stem valves. All product meet the 3A standard for sanitary processing along {{with a number of}} the products meeting the EHDGE European Hygienic standard.|$|R
50|$|Several {{types of}} non {{centralized}} sanitation systems {{are served by}} vacuum trucks. They are used to empty septage from cesspits, septic tanks, pit latrines and communal latrines, for street cleanup, for sewer clean out, and for individual septic systems. The trucks {{are used in the}} cleaning of <b>sanitary</b> sewer <b>pumping</b> stations. Vacuum trucks are used to empty portable toilets. In commercial aviation, vacuum trucks are used to collect waste from airplane toilets.|$|R
40|$|Outlined Yellow on Schedule "A " Attached Sifton Properties Limited is {{interested}} in participating {{in the development of}} the above captioned land. We ask that this Letter of Intent be accepted as a general basis to form a joint venture agreement between yourselves as the Land Owners and Sifton Properties Limited as the Land Developer ("Developer"). We are knowledgeable of the Lands and we provide the following observations:- The Land is wholly contained within the RiverBend Community Planning Area; The Lands are all within the Urban Growth Area of the City of London; The Lands are in the Oxford Sanitary Sewerage Shed and will be serviced by gravity sanitary sewers outletting into a <b>sanitary</b> <b>pumping</b> station currently being built by Sifton east of Westdel Bourne Road and North of Shore Road and on the South Side of the "new " Kains Road; facility to be constructed by Sifton in their RiverBend Phase 2 subdivision north of the new Kains Road and immediately east of Westdel Bourne Road. constructed by the City of London from the new water pumping station on the- Storm water will be directed to the regional storm water management (SWM) - Water servicing to the Lands is by a High Pressure Watermain planned to be E a d cido of Wiokoraon Road.

2500|$|The {{wastewater}} treatment plant and distribution system of water mains, pumping stations and storage facilities provide water to approximately 62,000 customers in the city. There is also a {{wastewater treatment}} plant located on the south bank of the James River. This plant can treat up to 70 {{million gallons of water}} per day of sanitary sewage and stormwater before returning it to the river. The wastewater utility also operates and maintains [...] of <b>sanitary</b> sewer and <b>pumping</b> stations, [...] of intercepting sewer lines, and the Shockoe Retention Basin, a 44-million-gallon stormwater reservoir used during heavy rains.|$|R
40|$|Because of {{high prices}} of energy, we are {{upgrading}} our heating systems with newer, more fuel efficient heating devices. Each new device {{has its own}} control system, which operates independently from other devices in a heating system. With a relatively low investment costs in automation, we can group devices in one central control system and increase the energy efficiency of a heating system. In this project, we show how to connect an oil furnace, a <b>sanitary</b> heat <b>pump,</b> solar panels and a heat pump in to a single control system. To improve energy efficiency, the heating system must choose the most efficient device, depending on the external conditions. The main device in the heating system is the heat pump. It operates efficiently in relevant external conditions. If the external conditions do not match required criteria, another more efficient heating device is used. For management of entire heating system we have prepared an online visualization system, that can be accessed via global internet. We expect that improved heating automation will reduced heating costs by 20...|$|R
