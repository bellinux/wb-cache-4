These workers were probably employed at normal day labour rates, the main employment method used on the project.

30|$|There {{are many}} labeled images and unlabeled videos in real world. To achieve good {{performance}} for video semantic recognition, we propose a new feature selection framework, which can borrow the knowledge transferred from images {{to achieve its}} performance improvements. Meanwhile, it can utilize both labeled and unlabeled videos to enhance <b>the</b> performance <b>of</b> semantic recognition in videos. Extensive experiments validate that the knowledge transferred from images and {{the information contained in}} unlabeled videos can be used indeed to select more discriminative features, leading to <b>the</b> enhancement <b>of</b> recognition accuracies of semantics inside videos. In comparison with <b>the</b> existing <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>arts,</b> <b>the</b> experimental results show that the proposed JCAEL has better performances in video semantics recognition. Even under the circumstance that only a few labeled training videos are available, our proposed JCAEL still performs competitive among all <b>the</b> compared existing <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>arts,</b> leading to a high level of flexibility for its applications in real world.|$|R
