6000|$|Now, in that Japanese sea, {{the days}} in summer are as freshets of effulgences.

Well that Ahab's quadrant was furnished with colored glasses, through which to take sight of that solar fire. So, swinging his seated form to the roll of the ship, and with his astrological-looking instrument placed to his eye, he remained in that posture for some moments to catch the precise instant when the sun should gain its precise meridian. Meantime while his whole attention was absorbed, the Parsee was kneeling beneath him on the ship's deck, and with face thrown up like Ahab's, was eyeing the same sun with him; only the lids of his eyes half hooded their orbs, and his wild face was subdued to an earthly passionlessness. At length the desired observation was taken; and with his pencil upon his ivory leg, Ahab soon calculated what his latitude must be at that precise instant. Then falling into a moment's revery, he again looked up towards the sun and murmured to himself: [...] "Thou <b>seamark!</b> thou high and mighty Pilot! thou tellest me truly where I am--but canst thou cast the least hint where I shall be? Or canst thou tell where some other thing besides me is this moment living? Where is Moby Dick? This instant thou must be eyeing him.

40|$|International audienceEven {{if their}} spatial {{reasoning}} capabilities remain {{quite similar to}} those of sighted people, blind people encounter difficulties in getting distant information from their surroundings. Thus, whole body displacements, tactile map consultations, or auditory solutions are needed to establish physical contacts with their environment. Therefore, the accuracy of nonvisual spatial representations heavily relies upon the efficiency of exploration strategies and the ability to coordinate egocentric and allocentric spatial frames of reference. This study aims to better understand the mechanisms of this coordination without vision by analyzing cartographic exploration strategies and assessing their influence on mental spatial representations. Six blind sailors were immersed within a virtual haptic and auditory maritime environment. They were required to learn the layout of the map. Their movements were recorded and we identified some exploration strategies. Then they had to estimate the directions of six particular <b>seamarks</b> in aligned and misaligned situations. Better accuracy and coordination were obtained when participants used the “central point of reference” strategy. Our discussion relative to the articulation between geometric enduring representations and salient transient perceptions provides implications on map reading techniques and on mobility and orientation programs for blind people...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an overview of}} the most important requirements and recommendations of international organizations for the area of LNG terminal under construction in ĝwinoujĞcie. These recommendations should be considered when planning safe traffic and manoeuvring of ships in port approaches to the Port of ĝwinoujĞcie and to the Outer Port of ĝwinoujĞcie. The approach area to the new terminal is located on shallow waters. Up to the present moment the fairway, anchorages and <b>seamarks</b> have been used by vessels of smaller size. After the construction of the new port with an LNG terminal it will handle the greatest LNG carriers. To ensure their safe entrance to the port, the fairway should be prepared with sufficient width and depth, with navigational aids. It is also necessary to prepare appropriate emergency anchorages and places where the vessels can return in case further voyage is dangerous. Additionally LNG cargo is very dangerous, because of this there is a compulsory to introduce of the highest safety standards, both {{in the design of the}} approach area and the application procedures for ships traffic. In particular, fairways and port canals, Under Keel Allowance, air draft, turning basin, vessel traffic services (VTS), traffic separation schemes (TSS), moving safety zone, and required speed limit are presented in the paper...|$|R

40|$|With recent {{advancement}} in underwater robotics and acoustic communications, {{the concept of}} mobile underwater acoustic networks (MUANs) has gradually become feasible. The advantage of MUANs lies in their mobility which allows them to adjust the topology easily and therefore adapt to environment changes. Many promising applications are made possible with this class of networks, for example, a network of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) {{can be used in}} fishery to herd fish or in the oil industry to monitor undersea pipelines. However, designing a mobile network in an uncertain environment, such as the ocean, is a challenging task. In this dissertation, we investigate three topics in in MUANs. The first piece of work presents a deployment framework for a typical scenario in Lagrangian oceanography measurement in which uses mobile sensors to collect data. The sensors are redeployed if drifted out of the area. Our proposed framework aims to provide guidance to network designers. For example, with the constructed models for coverage and connectivity, they are able to determine the number of nodes needed to guarantee coverage of 80 % or connectivity of at most 4 components with probability of 0. 5, for instance. The second piece of work proposes a MAC protocol, named PMAC, which has real applications in monitoring oil pipelines. The protocol is scheduling-based and is specifically designed for string networks to achieve high performance. Real sea test data shows that the protocol had much higher goodput than an RTS/CTS scheme tested in the same experiment, up to three times more efficient. On top of this, the end-to-end delay is also shorter. In this work, we also point out an important issue yet usually ignored by a majority of studies: the modem processing delay. With this delay, short packets can have adverse effects on network performance if they are not scheduled carefully. Additionally, we derive a closed form formula, considering real modems’ characteristics, for choosing the optimal packet size which can serve as the upper bound on the optimal packet size. The third piece of work is on a novel underwater navigation method designed for mobile vehicle. Our scheme has many potential applications, for example fish herding or undersea surveillance, because it does not require a vehicle to surface. In our approach, we deploy <b>seamarks,</b> which serve as landmarks at sea, to assist vehicles’ inertial navigation systems. <b>Seamarks</b> are lightweight undersea nodes whose main functionality is to help a vehicle measure round-trip distances. Based on this data, a vehicle executes our estimation algorithm to correct its velocity and position. Simulation results shows that our algorithm is simple enough to implement in practice and requires a reasonable number of measurements...|$|R
6000|$|Kennedy is {{a country}} doctor, and lives in Colebrook, {{on the shores of}} Eastbay. The high ground rising {{abruptly}} behind the red roofs of the little town crowds the quaint High Street against the wall which defends it from the sea. Beyond the sea-wall there curves for miles in a vast and regular sweep the barren beach of shingle, with the village of Brenzett standing out darkly across the water, a spire in a clump of trees; and still further out the perpendicular column of a lighthouse, looking in the distance no bigger than a lead pencil, marks the vanishing-point of the land. The country at the back of Brenzett is low and flat, but the bay is fairly well sheltered from the seas, and occasionally a big ship, windbound or through stress of weather, makes use of the anchoring ground {{a mile and a half}} due north from you as you stand at the back door of the [...] "Ship Inn" [...] in Brenzett.

30|$|On a boat, the {{understanding}} of the position is vital when approaching sensitive environments such as coasts, open sea reefs, high-density navigation zones, or harbor channels. These situations are true not only for small sailing or motorboats but also for large vessels where the navigation crew is limited with respect to boat sizes. In this kind of large ships, it is also recommended to combine visual checking, based on real environment observations, and instrument piloting. Current methods consist of going back and forth between map analysis and visual observations. However, matching map indications with a real environment can be tricky and error prone. It also represents a loss of time that can be precious in case of emergency. Finally, this matching can be simply impossible when the visibility is very bad. This is a relevant case study since a ship is a very unstable system. All the continuing motions have various parameters depending on boat speed, user moves, and ocean oscillations. Swell periods can vary between 0.05 and 0.1 Hz. However, this is also a domain where a lot of data are available. The first category includes static <b>seamarks</b> objects. The second one is dynamic but can be estimated, and in this category, we find for instance the ocean streams and the tide-dependent shallow areas. The third one is provided by the automatic identification system (AIS) that broadcasts the positions, the heading, and the ID of boats or any maritime objects in the surroundings. All these data can be added to the user fields of vision according to position and attitude estimations. Then, we have boat-positioning data, which include global positioning system (GPS) measurements, speed, trim, heel, and heading. All these data, which can be encrypted in sensitive or military applications, can be obtained through a wireless network that does not require high bandwidth capacities. However, these data are useful but not sufficient since it is necessary to know the user attitude, which is defined with the head angular positions. These data have to be provided by embedded sensors that must be integral with the glasses. Redundancy between boat and user data can also be usefully combined to improve accuracy. For instance, the on-glasses accelerometers can be combined with the ship GPS to estimate local moves on a long vessel.|$|R

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Studies on ancient navigation have traditionally derived their information from ancient geographers and the authors of various periploi ("sailings around"), a type of coast-pilot written in and after the fifth century B. C. The resultant paradigm portrays a scene in which ships voyage from headland to headland, never traversing the open sea, and rarely, if ever, sail intentionally past sunset. The investigation presented here, however, offers a different scenario, one which characterizes ancient seafarers as both naturalists and pragmatists, devoted to accurate wayfinding not only on coasting voyages, but also on the open sea. To this end they became students of their maritime environment, making a science of winds (dividing and subdividing them into a wind "compass") and wind prediction, and compiling a body of weather lore that still rings true today. At times, contrary to ancient conventions and modern interpretation of the sailing season, their confidence emboldened them to extend their activity into the winter months. They acquired wayfinding clues by observing the behavior of shore-sighting birds and birds in their natural environment. They also invented aids to navigation: the crow's nest, a Late Bronze Age innovation, extended the viewer's horizon by several miles and helped ships avoid dangerous reefs on approaches to land; the sounding lead indicated depth and type of bottom; man-made <b>seamarks</b> and landmarks (temples, shrines, funeral mounds, towers, and lighthouses) offered invaluable position-finding information. Sailing past sunset, a very-well documented practice in antiquity, presented a host of additional challenges and hazards. Their response, quite logically, was {{to make sense of the}} night sky. Systems of celestial navigation eventually evolved, facilitated by the Mediterranean's clear summer skies: the circumpolar constellations offered a convenient orientation; their height above the horizon provided rough positions north or south of predetermined reference points; and evidence suggests that ancient seafarers utilized guide-stars and "star paths" (a Polynesian practice) to point them in the direction of their destination. In addition to presenting the subject, there is also a case to be made that ancient seafarers invented wayfinding instruments and practices that allowed them to sail safely upon the open sea, day or night...|$|R
