Each had mixed feelings about whether {{there would be a}} series commission after the poor reception of the pilot; Ripley did not <b>stop</b> <b>thinking</b> about it, in contrast to Bathurst, who viewed it as just another failed pilot he had done.|$|E
5|$|Sterling {{agrees to}} this, {{which results in}} a hectic car chase that frightens Sterling some, despite Burt's expert driving {{that allows him to}} achieve many Hollywood driving stunts. During this, Burt tells Sterling that he needs to <b>stop</b> <b>thinking</b> of Malory as just his mother and rather think of her as a person with {{emotional}} (and sexual) needs and that he should think about her happiness and not his. This seems to sway Sterling and at that point, Burt has been able to catch up to the ISIS agents and the Cubans and saves the ISIS agents. The then group drives back to a heartbroken Malory. Sterling apologizes for writing the phony letter and Burt takes Malory on their date to the movie premiere.|$|E

The women see Belvile, Blunt, and Frederick approach, but the fact that Willmore is not with them causes the women to hide and to eavesdrop on the men. Belvile, Blunt and Frederick have come to retrieve Willmore from Angellica because he has been inside with her for two hours. Willmore comes out and brags about having enjoyed Angellica's charms for free. A servant of Lucetta's enters and takes Blunt back with him to Lucetta's lodgings.|$|E
25|$|Following a brief courtship, Elyot and Sybil are honeymooning at an {{hotel in}} Deauville, {{although}} her curiosity about {{his first marriage}} is not helping his romantic mood. In the adjoining suite, Amanda and Victor are starting their new life together, although he cannot <b>stop</b> <b>thinking</b> of the cruelty Amanda's ex-husband displayed towards her. Elyot and Amanda, following a volatile three-year-long marriage, have been divorced {{for the past five}} years, but they now discover that they are sharing a terrace while on their honeymoons with their new and younger spouses. Elyot and Amanda separately beg their new spouses to leave the hotel with them immediately, but both new spouses refuse to co-operate and each storms off to dine alone. Realising they still love each other and regretting having divorced, Elyot and Amanda abandon their spouses and run off together to Amanda's flat in Paris.|$|E
25|$|While {{reading the}} book Paul gave her, Connie finds his phone number inside. Connie calls Paul from Grand Central Station for his address, but he invites her over for coffee instead. Paul reads Connie a book in Braille amidst mild flirting. Connie, despite her {{feelings}} of attraction, leaves. Connie is unable to <b>stop</b> <b>thinking</b> about Paul, and decides to visit him {{with a bag of}} muffins. After Connie and Paul have a dance, she stops, saying she can't continue, and leaves. When she returns to retrieve her coat, Paul literally sweeps her off her feet and into his bed. While on the train ride home via the Metro-North Railroad, Connie, in tears, recalls their sexual encounter in flashbacks. She is thrilled by the sexual attention she is receiving from a younger man, but feels guilty at the same time. Connie uses her work for a charity event as an excuse to go into the city to visit Paul more frequently. Edward almost immediately senses something and sees subtle changes in her, which is confirmed by an inconsistency in an excuse she uses to visit the city one day. One morning he notices that Connie is fixing herself up to go into the city, with brand new shoes and lingerie draped over a chair, and he tells Connie he will wait for her so they can go into the city together. She urges him to go without her, that she won't be ready for quite a while, so he tries to get her to agree to meet him for lunch, but she says she has a salon appointment and won't be able to meet him. Later on, at the office, suspecting Connie is lying, Edward calls the salon she mentioned and it is confirmed that she doesn't have an appointment that day.|$|E

500|$|Wheeler had a {{personal}} reason for working on the Manhattan Project. His brother Joe, fighting in Italy, sent him a postcard with a simple message: [...] "Hurry up". It was already too late: Joe was killed in October 1944. [...] "Here we were," [...] Wheeler later wrote, [...] "so close to creating a nuclear weapon to end the war. I couldn't <b>stop</b> <b>thinking</b> then, and haven't stopped thinking since, that the war could have been over in October 1944." [...] Joe left a widow and baby daughter, Mary Jo, who later married physicist James Hartle.|$|E
500|$|Harrison {{had begun}} writing [...] "World of Stone", [...] "Grey Cloudy Lies" [...] and the soul-pop love song [...] "Can't <b>Stop</b> <b>Thinking</b> About You" [...] in 1973. He started [...] "This Guitar (Can't Keep from Crying)" [...] in Hawaii over Christmas 1974, while holidaying {{with his new}} girlfriend (later his wife), Olivia Arias, a {{secretary}} at Dark Horse's LA office. The song is a sequel to Harrison's popular Beatles track [...] "While My Guitar Gently Weeps", and the lyrics serve as a rebuttal to his critics, particularly Rolling Stone, whose savaging of the tour he would never forgive.|$|E

500|$|Thompson {{initially}} {{hoped that}} Doran would cast sisters Natasha and Joely Richardson as Elinor and Marianne Dashwood. Lee and Columbia wanted Thompson herself, now a [...] "big-deal movie star" [...] after her critically successful {{role in the}} 1992 film Howards End, to play Elinor. The actress replied that {{at the age of}} thirty-five, she was too old for the nineteen-year-old character. Lee suggested Elinor's age be changed to twenty-seven, which would also have made the difficult reality of spinsterhood easier for modern audiences to understand. Thompson agreed, later stating that she was [...] "desperate to get into a corset and act it and <b>stop</b> <b>thinking</b> about it as a script." ...|$|E

[...] Aguilera later commented that she found the parody disappointing and that she [...] "could have made a funnier script out of it." [...] The song was covered by British singer Ed Sheeran for a Live Lounge session of BBC Radio 1 in February 2015. Sheeran's performance was instrumented by guitar and incorporated soul elements. [...] "Dirrty" [...] was performed and lip-synced by Stephen Merchant on the show Lip Sync Battle in May 2015.|$|E
500|$|In 2009, Aronofsky {{reflected}} on the reception of The Fountain, [...] "There {{are a lot of}} Fountain-haters out [...] The film's about the fact that it's OK that we die, and we should come to terms with it. But many, many people don't want to think about that, so why pay money for a meditation on losing someone you love? Everything about western culture denies that." [...] He also believed the film was released at the wrong time, [...] "It was pre-Obama, {{smack in the middle of}} Paris Hilton time. But there has been a serious turn now, people are starting to realise that the party's over, finally. So we can <b>stop</b> <b>thinking</b> about the culture of superficiality, start to remember there are other things going on." ...|$|E

500|$|Mercedes began a {{relationship}} with Malachy Fisher (Glen Wallace). He proposed marriage to her, but she refused.

But afterwards she still can't <b>stop</b> <b>thinking</b> about Malachy, so she decides {{to go and see}} him to work out how she feels". Mercedes subsequently accepted Malachy's proposal and they marry. Mercedes found that she did not contract HIV from Malachy, but a Hollyoaks source described the news as [...] "bitter sweet" [...] because it was possible that her husband could die and leave her on her own. The source expanded on this, saying that if Mercedes had contracted HIV then the pair [...] "would be going through everything together".|$|E

When Franco was at a point in his life where he wanted to give back but was unsure how, he asked his Spider-Man co-star Kirsten Dunst for advice. At the suggestion of Dunst, he started volunteering at the charity Art of Elysium, where she also volunteers, which helps children with serious medical conditions. He said the experience helped save his life. In January 2011, at the Art of Elysium Heaven Gala in Los Angeles, Franco was honored for his work at the hospital, receiving the Spirit of Elysium accolade.|$|E

500|$|The song {{served as}} both the opener for Extra Texture as well as, {{in the form of}} a 45-second {{instrumental}} portion titled [...] "A Bit More of You", the first track on side two of the original LP. Harrison biographer Dale Allison dismisses this reprise with the words [...] "It's filler", while Leng suggests its purpose was to [...] "fashion a soul mood" [...] for the song that follows, the pop-soul ballad [...] "Can't <b>Stop</b> <b>Thinking</b> About You".
