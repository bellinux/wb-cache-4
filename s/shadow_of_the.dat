5|$|In 1903 Synge left Paris {{and moved}} to London. He had written two one-act plays, Riders to the Sea and The <b>Shadow</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Glen, the {{previous}} year. These met with Lady Gregory's approval and The <b>Shadow</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Glen was performed at the Molesworth Hall in October 1903. Riders to the Sea was performed at the same venue in February the following year. The <b>Shadow</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Glen, under the title In the <b>Shadow</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Glen, formed part of the bill for the opening run of the Abbey Theatre from 27 December 1904 to 3 January 1905. Both plays were based on stories that Synge had collected in the Aran Islands, and Synge relied on props from the Aran Islands to help {{set the stage for}} each of them. He also relied on Hiberno-English, the English dialect of Ireland, to reinforce its usefulness as a literary language, partly because he believed that the Irish language could not survive.|$|E

An HD remastered version developed by Bluepoint Games, that collects both games was released as The Ico & <b>Shadow</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Colossus Collection (ICO & <b>Shadow</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Colossus Classics HD in the PAL region) for the PlayStation 3 in September 2011; it features high-definition (HD) graphics, content previously missing from the North American version, PlayStation Network Trophies, and 3D support.

5|$|Cited as an {{influential}} {{title in the}} video game industry {{and one of the}} best games of all time, <b>Shadow</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Colossus is often regarded as an important example of video game as art due to its minimalist landscape designs, immersive gameplay and emotional journey. It received wide critical acclaim by the media and was met with strong sales compared to Ico, due in part to a larger marketing campaign. The soundtrack was also widely praised. The game won several awards for its audio, design, and overall quality. <b>Shadow</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Colossus is also referenced numerous times in debates regarding the art quality and emotional perspectives of video games. A remake of the game with ultra-high definition art assets is currently in development and scheduled for release on the PlayStation 4 in 2018.|$|E
