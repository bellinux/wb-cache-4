40|$|AbstractWe have {{previously}} identified the binding region {{of a new}} Ca 2 + antagonist <b>semotiadil</b> in the skeletal muscle Ca 2 + channel. To the same <b>semotiadil</b> derivatives, the cardiac counterpart showed distinct and different binding characteristics: <b>semotiadil</b> and its photoaffinity analog D 51 - 4700 inhibited [3 H]PN 200 - 110 binding to cardiac membrane preparations with IC 50 values of 13 – 20 μM, which are 10 times higher than those in skeletal muscle. Hill slopes of the binding inhibition were 0. 94 – 1. 0 for the cardiac channels compared to 0. 63 – 0. 67 for the skeletal muscle channels. A {{possible explanation for the}} difference is that the <b>semotiadil</b> binding site is differently conferred in cardiac and skeletal muscle Ca 2 + channels. To reveal this within the primary structure, photoaffinity labeling of cardiac membranes was employed. [3 H]D 51 - 4700 was photoincorporated in several polypeptides but only the α 1 subunit of the Ca 2 + channel was photolabeled in a specific manner. Antibody mapping of the [3 H]D 51 - 4700 -labeled α 1 subunit with several anti-peptide antibodies revealed that the labeled site was located solely in a peptide fragment between Cys 1461 and Lys 1529. This region encompasses the labeled site of skeletal muscle, but contains several non-identical amino acid residues, which may participate in expressing different binding characteristics between the two muscle type Ca 2 + channels...|$|E
40|$|To {{identify}} photoaffinity-labelled {{amino acid}} residue(s), we devised an effective method utilizing immunoaffinity purification of photolabelled fragments, followed by matrix-assisted laser-desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) MS and nanoelectrospray ionization tandem MS (nano-ESI-MS/MS) analysis. Human serum albumin (HSA) was photolabelled with an azidophenyl derivative of <b>semotiadil,</b> FNAK [(+) -(R) - 3, 4 -dihydro- 2 -[5 -methoxy- 2 -[3 -[N-methyl-N-[2 -(3 -azidophenoxy) -ethyl]amino]propoxyl]phenyl]- 4 -methyl- 2 H- 1, 4 -benzothiazin- 3 -(4 H) -one], since HSA {{is a major}} binding protein for <b>semotiadil</b> in serum. After lysyl endopeptidase digestion, photolabelled HSA fragments were adsorbed selectively on to Sepharose beads on which an anti-semotiadil antibody was immobilized, and fractions were eluted quantitatively by 50 % acetonitrile/ 10 mM HCl. MALDI-TOF MS analysis of the eluted fraction showed that it contained two photolabelled fragments of m/z 2557. 54 (major) and 1322. 44 (minor), corresponding to Lys- 414 -Lys- 432 and Ala- 539 -Lys- 545, respectively. Further nano-ESI-MS/MS analysis revealed that Lys- 414 was the photolabelled amino acid residue in fragment 414 - 432 and Lys- 541 was a likely candidate in fragment 539 - 545. Based on the photolabelling results, we constructed a three-dimensional model of the FNAK-HSA complex, revealing that FNAK resides in a pocket that overlaps considerably with myristate (Myr) -binding sites, Myr- 3 and - 4, by comparison with crystallographic data of HSA-Myr complexes described in Curry, Mandelkow, Brick and Franks (1998) Nat. Struct. Biol. 5, 827 - 835. Moreover, addition of Myr increased photo-incorporation into Lys- 414, whereas incorporation into Lys- 541 decreased under conditions of [Myr]/[HSA]< 1. Further addition of Myr, however, uniformly decreased photo-incorporation into both Lys residues. These results indicate that FNAK labelling {{can also be used}} to monitor Myr binding in domain III. An interpretation for the concomitant local conformational change of HSA is provided...|$|E
