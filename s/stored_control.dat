3000|$|One {{cycle of}} latency is {{achieved}} when pipelining the CU in normal instructions. Vector instructions are executed on a time multiplexing manner on the CU {{with a maximum}} vector length of 256 elements. Among different supported operations, the controlled accumulation (CACC) operation needs {{the largest number of}} simultaneous complex input signals. CACC operation adds or subtracts four complex words every cycle. This puts a constraint on the memory system to supply the unit with a maximum of four words every cycle. However in this mode, no write operations can be executed. To work in CACC mode, hardware configuration of the CU with respect to the control vector is done. M 1, M 2, and M 3 multipliers of Figure 4 are bypassed while a running configuration of the Add/Sub operations (A 1 [...]... A 8) are controlled via a <b>stored</b> <b>control</b> sequence.|$|E
40|$|Fingerprint and Iris are {{significant}} biometric tools used for authentication. This paper proposes a novel methodology {{by which the}} biometric patterns can be visualized {{as a set of}} Bezier curves and hence represented by the corresponding Bezier points, resulting in considerable reduction in the file size. This scheme utilizes the Bezier curve representations for effective compression of all those images. Initially, the ridges and furrows present in the fingerprint and iris image are extracted along with their coordinate values. The control points are determined for all the ridges and furrows. The control points of all the ridges determined are stored and are used to represent the fingerprint and iris image. When needed, those can be reconstructed from the <b>stored</b> <b>control</b> points using Bezier curves. The quality of the reconstructed fingerprint and iris is also maintained. Thus the proposed scheme achieves considerable memory reduction in storing the biometric patterns...|$|E
40|$|Naturally, {{with the}} {{mounting}} application of biometric systems, there arises a difficulty in storing and handling those acquired biometric data. Fingerprint recognition {{has been recognized}} as one of the most mature and established technique among all the biometrics systems. In recent times, with fingerprint recognition receiving increasingly more attention the amount of fingerprints collected has been constantly creating enormous problems in storage and transmission. Henceforth, the compression of fingerprints has emerged as an indispensable step in automated fingerprint recognition systems. Several researchers have presented approaches for fingerprint image compression. In this paper, we propose a novel and efficient scheme for fingerprint image compression. The presented scheme utilizes the Bezier curve representations for effective compression of fingerprint images. Initially, the ridges present in the fingerprint image are extracted along with their coordinate values using the approach presented. Subsequently, the control points are determined for all the ridges by visualizing each ridge as a Bezier curve. The control points of all the ridges determined are stored and are used to represent the fingerprint image. When needed, the fingerprint image is reconstructed from the <b>stored</b> <b>control</b> points using Bezier curves. The quality of the reconstructed fingerprint is determined by a formal evaluation. The proposed scheme achieves considerable memory reduction in storing the fingerprint.

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the color stability of composite resin types designed for esthetic anterior restorations when continuously exposed to various staining agents. Method and Materials: Thirty-six disk-shaped specimens {{were made of}} each of 12 composite materials (1 microfilled and 11 hybrid composites). After dry storage at 37 °C for 24 hours in an incubator (INP- 500, Memmert), the initial color of each specimen was assessed by a calibrated reflectance spectrophotometer (SpectroShade). Specimens were immersed in five staining solutions or dry <b>stored</b> (<b>control).</b> All specimens were kept in an incubator at 37 °C for 99 days. Test solutions were changed every 14 th day to avoid bacteria or yeast contamination. After 99 days of storage, spectrophotometric measurements were again performed and L*a*b* scores once more recorded to determine the color changes. Results: Wine proved to have the highest staining potential followed by coffee, tea, orange juice, and cola, which had the lowest staining potential. The highest color change measured against a white background was observed for Durafill (Heraeus Kulzer) in wine (ΔE = 62. 3), while the least staining was found for Enamel HFO (Micerium) in cola (ΔE = 3. 5). The highest color change measured against a black background was observed for EsthetX (Dentsply) in wine (ΔE = 46. 0), while the least staining was observed for Enamel HFO in cola (ΔE = 2. 5). Conclusion: Composite staining susceptibility proved to vary among composite structure and brands. Potential discoloration might be limited by dietary restriction based on such in vitro evaluation...|$|E
40|$|Lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) seeds have poor {{shelf life}} and exhibit thermoinhibition (fail to germinate) above ∼ 25 °C. Seed priming (controlled {{hydration}} followed by drying) alleviates thermoinhibition {{by increasing the}} maximum germination temperature, but reduces lettuce seed longevity. Controlled deterioration (CD) or accelerated ageing storage conditions (i. e. elevated temperature and relative humidity) are used to study seed longevity and to predict potential seed lifetimes under conventional storage conditions. Seeds produced in 2002 and 2006 of a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population derived from a cross between L. sativa cv. Salinas×L. serriola accession UC 96 US 23 were utilized to identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with seed longevity under CD and conventional storage conditions. Multiple longevity-associated QTLs were identified under both conventional and CD storage conditions for control (non-primed) and primed seeds. However, seed longevity was poorly correlated between the two storage conditions, suggesting that deterioration processes under CD conditions are not predictive of ageing in conventional storage conditions. Additionally, the same QTLs were not identified when RIL populations were grown in different years, indicating that lettuce seed longevity is strongly affected by production environment. Nonetheless, a major QTL on chromosome 4 [Seed longevity 4. 1 (Slg 4. 1) ] was responsible for almost 23 % of the phenotypic variation in viability of the conventionally <b>stored</b> <b>control</b> seeds of the 2006 RIL population, with improved longevity conferred by the Salinas allele. QTL analyses may enable identification of mechanisms responsible for the sensitivity of primed seeds to CD conditions and breeding for improved seed longevity...|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (page 69) A microprogrammable adaptable architecture greatly {{enhances the}} flexibility and usefulness of an experimental microcomputer. The static architecture {{approach has been}} the traditional one as evidenced in most popular computer architectures, particularily in educational and experimental machines. With the advances in LSI and VLSI technologies, however, the developing trend seems to be leaning toward more flexible adaptable computer architectures which attempt to maximize the usage of internal and external resources by tailoring configurations and instruction sets to the specific computing task at hand. This is accomplished at three levels: microprogrammable, (software initiated system resource) reconfigurable and dynamic (in which computational elements are reconfigured under control of special instructions) adaptability. Microprogrammable adaptable architectures can be categorized into two classes - static and dynamic. The scope of this project deals with two variations of static microprogrammable adaptability. First, the modification of (writable) <b>control</b> <b>store</b> by loading one or more variable length blocks of microinstructions (1 - n microsequences) and second, the modification of <b>control</b> <b>store</b> microsequences from <b>control</b> panel inputs.

AIX for the RT was IBM's second foray into UNIX. (After PC/IX in September 1984.)The lack of software packages and IBM's sometimes lackluster support of AIX, plus the sometimes unusual changes from traditional UNIX operating system de facto standards caused most software suppliers to be slow to embrace the RT and AIX. The RT found its home mostly in the CAD/CAM and CATIA areas, with some inroads into the scientific and educational areas, especially after the announcement of AOS and substantial discounts for the educational community.
