His calling the police [...] "rogue cops" [...] and [...] "goons" [...] and the operation a [...] "panty raid" [...] was criticized, and the officers alleged what was only a <b>standard</b> <b>liquor</b> inspection hurt their careers and reputations. A jury eventually decided that the seven officers were defamed and ordered Rae to pay $170,000.

5000|$|Phillips Distilling Company (est. 1912) is a Minneapolis, Minnesota-based {{distillery}} {{and house}} brand of liquors {{known for its}} omnipresence in the bars, taverns, and private shelves of the Great Plains. Brands such as UV Vodka and Prairie Vodka are becoming popular across the nation. Phillips produces a variety of liquors such as Vodka, Gin, Rum, Canadian whisky, Brandy and many flavors of Schnapps. In recent years, Phillips has branched out beyond <b>standard</b> <b>liquors</b> {{with a variety of}} specialty drinks, such as Revel Stoke Spiced Whisky (the original spiced whisky), Gin-Ka (a combination of gin and vodka), Phillips Union Whiskey, the 100 proof series of Schnapps (Hot, Blue, and Root Beer), and vodka such as UV Vodka and the handcrafted and organic Prairie Vodka. Phillips also produced an herbal liqueur, aptly named [...] "Black 100" [...] for its 50% alcohol by volume content and opaque black color, similar in texture and flavor to Schwartzhog or Jakob Steiner.|$|R
5000|$|While Liberia produces, imports, and consumes some <b>standard</b> {{beers and}} <b>liquors,</b> the {{traditional}} palm wine made from fermenting palm tree sap is popular. Palm wine can be drunk as-is, {{used as a}} yeast substitute in bread, or used as vinegar after it has soured. A local rum is also made from sugarcane, and called [...] "cane juice" [...] or [...] "gang gang".|$|R
5000|$|Much of {{the profile}} of aged liquor comes from ethanol {{interacting}} with wood which produces vanillins and other co-generated compounds. [...] In singani, all of the aromatic profile must come from the grape itself as it interacts with yeast during the fermentation process. A grape richer in desirable aromatics is therefore preferable to thin, acidic varieties as {{may be used for}} cognac. Producers who have experimentally aged singani have reported that singani’s distinctive character becomes diminished, and the resultant brown liquor tastes more like other brown liquors than singani. Given current national <b>standards,</b> such a <b>liquor</b> could not rightfully be called singani.|$|R

40|$|Manure {{additive}} {{products can}} be used to reduce odour emissions (OE) from livestock farms. The standardised evaluation of these manure additive products under specific farm conditions is important. In this study, the efficacy of a manure additive (WonderTreat(TM), CKLS, Inc., Hong-Kong) was assessed under Australian conditions utilising a combination of laboratory and field-scale evaluation techniques. As a first step, the efficacy of the manure additive was assessed in a laboratory-scale trial using a series of uniformly managed digesters and <b>standard</b> odour, <b>liquor</b> ammonia and hydrogen sulphide concentration measurement procedures. This showed that the addition of WonderTreat(TM) at the 'low dose rate' (LDR) (102. 6 g m- 2) used during the trial significantly, but only marginally (30 %; P = 0. 02) reduced the OE rate (mean 13. 9 OU m- 2 s- 1) of anaerobic pig liquor relative to an untreated control (UC) (19. 9 OU m- 2 s- 1). However, the 'high dose rate' (HDR) (205. 3 g m- 2) also assessed during the trial preformed similarly (19. 7 OU m- 2 s- 1) to the UC. No statistically significant difference in the concentrations of a range of measured water quality variables at the 5 % level was observed between the treatments or controls digesters. As a second step, a field-scale assessment of the manure additive was undertaken at a commercial piggery. Two piggery manure lagoons (each with approximately 2500 m 2 surface area) were included in the study; one was treated with WonderTreat(TM) while the other was used as control. The efficacy of the treatment was assessed using olfactometric evaluation of odour samples collected {{from the surface of the}} pond using a dynamic wind tunnel and ancillary equipment. No statistically significant reduction in OE rate could be demonstrated (P = 0. 35), partially due to the limited number of samples taken during the assessment. However, there was a numerical reduction in the average OE rate of the treatment pond (29 OU m- 2 s- 1 at 1 m s- 1) compared to the control lagoon (38 OU m- 2 s- 1 at 1 m s- 1) ...|$|R
40|$|Industrialized {{countries}} are currently experiencing {{an epidemic of}} high blood pressure (HBP) extending to people living with HIV (PLWH). Given the prevalence of hazardous alcohol use (HAU), this study examines the relationship between alcohol consumption and hypertension in PLWH. Including a gender analysis is critical, given the high rates of HAU and HIV among females. We followed PLWH including both HAU and non-HAU (200 each). Participants were assessed twice for body weight, blood pressure, alcohol consumption, and other BP-associated lifestyle factors. High blood pressure (defined as systolic/diastolic blood pressure above 140 / 90 mmHg and/or treatment of HBP) was the primary outcome. Overall prevalence of hypertension was 38 % and higher among HAU compared to non-HAU (42 % vs. 34 %, p =  0. 02). Less than half with HBP (42 %) were receiving treatment for hypertension. Overall, males had a 50 % higher risk of HBP than women (odds ratio: 1. 5, 95 % CI: 1 - 2. 6, p =  0. 05). However among HAU, females were twice as likely to suffer HBP as their male counterparts (95 % CI: 1 - 3. 9, p =  0. 02). Those HAU who preferred liquor, versus wine, had higher adjusted mean BP (132. 6 ± 18 vs. 122. 3 ± 14 mm Hg, p =  0. 05). Additional analyses indicated that consumption of > 1 <b>standard</b> drink of <b>liquor</b> or beer/day was associated with HBP. Risk of hypertension was noted in those with daily consumption of > 3 glasses of wine. For those reporting < 1 drink per day, the odds ratio of having HBP was 0. 97 (CI: 0. 6 - 0. 99, p =  0. 05). Factors associated with hypertension in the multivariate model included increased age, gender, BMI, HAU particularly of liquor, and smoking. Excessive hypertension burden in this population and its association with HAU and sub-optimal care indicate the need for preventive and educational intervention in PLWH. Analyses highlight the necessity of gender and type-of-beverage specific approaches...|$|R
