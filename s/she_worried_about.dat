25|$|In late 1898, {{physicians}} diagnosed the Empress Dowager with inoperable breast cancer, {{forcing her}} to stay in bed for long periods. The cancer spread to her spine by the autumn of 1900, and as <b>she</b> <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> her personal letters (in which she detailed her concern over Germany's future under her son) falling {{into the hands of}} the Emperor, she requested that the letters be brought back to Great Britain in a cloak-and-dagger operation by her godson Frederick Ponsonby, the private secretary of her brother King Edward VII, who was making his final visit to his terminally ill sister in Kronberg on 23 February 1901. These letters were later edited by Ponsonby and put into context by his background commentary to form the book that was published in 1928.|$|E
500|$|Miss Rosa {{undertakes}} chemotherapy {{to treat}} her cancer which leaves her bald. Rosenblat did not shave her head for the role because <b>she</b> <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> other roles. She had to wear a silicone [...] "appliance" [...] {{on her head and}} neck. Each morning on set makeup artist Josh Turri made up the appliance onto her. The process would take approximately three hours and Turri added false beauty marks, eyebrows and small veins to complete Miss Rosa's look. Rosenblat described him as [...] "utterly brilliant and a perfectionist ... so you got this entirely organic sense that I was utterly bald and suffering [...] cancer." [...] While on set fellow actors and crew members incorrectly assumed she had shaved her head. The weather during filming also affected Miss Rosa's costumer. During warm weather crew shielded Rosenblat from the sun with umbrellas because the heat would cause the make up to crack. Other breaches were caused by perspiration and Turri would drain water from underneath the prosthetics prior to repairing it. At the end of each shoot it took Rosenblat 45 minutes to remove the appliance.|$|E
2500|$|Soon {{after her}} arrest in 1968, Jacobs moved to Toronto, {{eventually}} settling at 69 Albany Avenue in The Annex from 1971 {{until her death}} in 2006. She {{decided to leave the}} U.S. in part because she opposed the Vietnam War, <b>she</b> <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> the fate of her two draft-age sons, and {{she did not want to}} continue fighting the NYC government. She and her husband chose Toronto because it was pleasant and offered employment opportunities, and they moved to an area of the Toronto that included so many Americans avoiding the draft it was called the [...] "American ghetto".|$|E

2500|$|A devout Catholic who did {{not want}} to have children, <b>she</b> <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> pregnancy. Some historians believe nothing further {{developed}} besides correspondence. Since Jefferson was very discreet, no one knows for certain the extent of their relationship. Jefferson eventually stopped writing her until some time later when she contacted him; their renewed correspondence continued until his death. Historians such as Andrew Burstein have suggested the relationship was romantic mostly on Jefferson's side, and that Cosway was his opposite, more artistic than rational. Their correspondence survives. Before Jefferson left Paris, he wrote her, [...] "I am going to America and you are going to Italy. One of us is going the wrong way, for the way will ever be wrong that leads us further apart." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2009, a quiet {{relationship}} between Hilton and the tabloids led entertainment writers {{to suggest that}} her popularity had waned. In a CNN story, [...] "Why has Paris Hilton disappeared?", editor Samantha Yanks of Gotham and Hamptons magazines said: [...] "Phase one was the ascension, seemingly out of nowhere. That came with a media frenzy, the antics, the partying, the music, the babe-like status and of course, the fashion label. Phase two, she disappears". Hilton's absence from the news was an apparent response {{to a new generation}} of tabloid consumers uninterested in her. This suspicion was reinforced in June 2011 when her reality show, The World According to Paris, had low ratings and Hilton walked out during an interview with Good Morning America when asked if <b>she</b> <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> her moment having passed.|$|E
2500|$|Hurston {{opposed the}} Supreme Court ruling in the Brown v. Board of Education case of 1954. She {{felt that if}} {{separate}} schools were truly equal (and she {{believed that they were}} rapidly becoming so), educating black students in physical proximity to white students would not result in better education. In addition, <b>she</b> <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> the demise of black schools and black teachers as a way to pass on cultural tradition to future generations of African Americans. She voiced this opposition in a letter, [...] "Court Order Can't Make the Races Mix", that was published in the Orlando Sentinel in August 1955. Hurston had not reversed her long-time opposition to segregation. Rather, she feared that the Court's ruling could become a precedent for an all-powerful federal government to undermine individual liberty on a broad range of issues in the future. Hurston also opposed preferential treatment for African-Americans, saying: ...|$|E

50|$|She {{admits to}} some romantic {{attraction}} to Harry as well, but {{is unwilling to}} act on it for several reasons. Firstly, <b>she</b> <b>worries</b> <b>about</b> complicating or ruining their friendship and working relationship. <b>She</b> also <b>worries</b> <b>about</b> their difference in lifespans: as a wizard, Harry will live for centuries, and she wants someone who can grow old with her and raise a family.|$|R

2500|$|Their fans include Pixie Lott and Robbie Williams. Taoiseach Brian Cowen also {{backed the}} singers, while Leona Lewis said that <b>she</b> <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> them. Two leading British {{political}} parties, Labour and the Conservatives, each released campaign posters parodying the twins. Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown {{came under fire}} in November 2009 for describing Jedward as [...] "not very good" [...] and later apologised for doing so. Following this, Walsh stated [...] "So Gordon Brown and Simon Cowell both have something in common: neither of them know what the public want." [...] Former Prime Minister David Cameron admitted that he enjoyed watching The X Factor and that Jedward were his favourite act. Cameron also bought a T-shirt with their faces on it. The Irish Independent called Jedward [...] "tone-deaf twins", even though the pair were voted more popular than The Beatles in a teenage poll. Comedian Oliver Callan has parodied them on his RTÉ 2 show Nob Nation.|$|E
2500|$|Following the January 1968 Tet {{offensive}} in Vietnam {{that resulted in}} a drop in President Johnson's poll numbers, Robert Kennedy's advisors urged him to enter the presidential race. When asked by Art Buchwald if he intended to run, Robert replied, [...] "That depends on what Jackie wants me to do". She met with him around this time, encouraging him to run after previously advising him to not follow his brother, but to [...] "be yourself". Privately, <b>she</b> <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> his safety, believing he was more disliked than her husband had been and that there was [...] "so much hatred" [...] in the United States. She confided in him about these feelings, but by her own account, he was [...] "fatalistic" [...] like her. Despite her concerns, Jacqueline campaigned for her brother-in-law and supported him, and at one point even showed outright optimism that through his victory, members of the Kennedy family would once again occupy the White House.|$|E
2500|$|In 2004, she {{ran for the}} 14th District seat in the Ohio Senate {{to replace}} Senate President Doug White, who was retiring. The Senate seat {{included}} Clermont, Brown, Adams and Scioto counties and part of Lawrence County. Her opponent for the Republican nomination was Tom Niehaus, a fellow member of the Ohio House from New Richmond whose 88th District represented the half of Clermont County outside her district plus Brown and Adams Counties to the east. Schmidt told the Enquirer [...] "The fear {{from many of the}} people I meet is that because the next senator will come from Clermont County, they will be underrepresented. But if you know anything about me, I don't under-represent anybody." [...] She also said <b>she</b> <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> the state budget: [...] "We do have a history of overspending in Ohio. But it's not just recent history. It's a 40-year-old habit." [...] The Enquirer was dismayed by advertisements from the Ohio Taxpayers Association [...] "twisting the two candidates' voting records to Schmidt's advantage" [...] and endorsed Niehaus.|$|E

60|$|So {{would she}} worry {{as she left}} the office. In the evening she wouldn't so much criticize herself as {{suddenly}} and without reason remember office settings and incidents--startle at a picture of the T-square at which she had stared while Mr. Wilkins was telephoning.... She wasn't weary because she worried; she worried because she was weary from the airless, unnatural, straining life. <b>She</b> <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> everything available, from her soul to her finger-nails; but the office offered the largest number of good opportunities.|$|E
60|$|Olive's eyes lingered {{a little}} on her own; then they turned away, vaguely, blindly, out of the carriage-window, and Verena made the {{reflexion}} that she looked strangely little like {{a person who was}} going to dine at Delmonico's. How terribly <b>she</b> <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> everything, and how tragical was her nature; how anxious, suspicious, exposed to subtle influences! In their long intimacy Verena had come to revere most of her friend's peculiarities; they were a proof of her depth and devotion, and were so bound up with what was noble in her that she was rarely provoked to criticise them separately. But at present, suddenly, Olive's earnestness began to appear as inharmonious with the scheme of the universe {{as if it had been}} a broken saw; and she was positively glad she had not told her about Basil Ransom's appearance in Monadnoc Place. If she worried so about what she knew, how much would she not have worried about the rest! Verena had by this time made up her mind that her acquaintance with Mr. Ransom was the most episodical, most superficial, most unimportant of all possible relations.|$|E

5000|$|As a {{representative}} of Paris city hall, in 2001 she attended the Universités d’été euroméditerranéennes des homosexualités, where <b>she</b> <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> possible discrimination towards militant bisexuals in the associations within the homosexual world, a [...] "biphobia".|$|E
50|$|She was {{economically}} prosperous, {{something which}} bothered her as <b>she</b> <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> exploiting the poor for art.

5000|$|Welty's debut novel, The Robber Bridegroom (1942), {{deviated}} from her previous psychologically-inclined works, presenting static, fairy-tale characters. Some critics suggest that <b>she</b> <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> [...] "encroaching on the turf {{of the male}} literary giant {{to the north of}} her in Oxford, Mississippi-William Faulkner", and therefore wrote in a fairy-tale style instead of a historical one. Most critics and readers saw it as a modern Southern fairy-tale and noted that it employs themes and characters reminiscent of the Grimm Brothers' works.|$|E

She stated, [...] "It's important {{for young people to}} see people who look like them being successful.

5000|$|During {{the press}} conference for the 2011 series, Can't Lose, co-starring Yoon Sang-hyun, {{featuring}} a lawyer couple facing their own divorce suit, she was asked if <b>she</b> <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> shedding her pure and innocent image. Choi said, [...] "I've had the same image for 15 years. Isn't it {{time for me to}} break out? I was a melodrama queen and now I want the title of romantic comedy queen." [...] She added that she had gained more fans after showing her cheerful, easygoing side as a guest on the reality show 2 Days & 1 Night.|$|E
