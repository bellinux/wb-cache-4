50|$|When distant {{stars at}} the TRGB are {{measured}} in the I-band (in the infrared), their luminosity is <b>somewhat</b> <b>insensitive</b> to their composition of elements heavier than helium (metallicity) or their mass; they are a standard candle with an I-band absolute magnitude of -4.0±0.1. This makes the technique especially useful as a distance indicator. The TRGB indicator uses stars in the old stellar populations (Population II).|$|R

30|$|In the figures, the {{separated}} wavelet spectrogram {{shows that}} only the harmonic partials have been recovered. When the inharmonic partials carry important (non noisy) information, the synthetic signal can <b>sound</b> <b>somewhat</b> different (as happened with the possible envelope errors in the high-frequency partials).|$|R
5000|$|Tremolo, in electronics, is the {{variation}} in amplitude of sound achieved through electronic means, sometimes mistakenly called vibrato, and producing a <b>sound</b> <b>somewhat</b> reminiscent of flanging, referred to as an [...] "underwater effect".

5000|$|Most, if not all, metals can be sintered. This applies {{especially}} to pure metals produced in vacuum which suffer no surface contamination. Sintering under atmospheric pressure requires {{the use of}} a protective gas, quite often endothermic gas. Sintering, with subsequent reworking, can produce a great range of material properties. Changes in density, alloying, or heat treatments can alter the physical characteristics of various products. For instance, the Young's Modulus En of sintered iron powders remains <b>somewhat</b> <b>insensitive</b> to sintering time, alloying, or particle size in the original powder for lower sintering temperatures, but depends upon the density of the final product: ...|$|R

2500|$|Johnny Loftus of Allmusic {{gave the}} album a mixed review, saying [...] "their cool professionalism makes Live in Texas <b>sound</b> <b>somewhat</b> sterile," [...] {{as well as}} saying the band [...] "seems lost inside its own sound."

60|$|This may <b>sound</b> <b>somewhat</b> sly, but French children, before Rousseau {{had made}} them the fashion, were kept in the background, and were reduced to picking up {{intelligence}} {{as best they could}} without any sense of its being dishonourable to do so; and, indeed, it was more neglect than desire of concealment that left their uninformed.|$|R
