40|$|Abstract Background Protein and mRNA {{levels for}} several selenoproteins, such as {{glutathione}} peroxidase- 1 (Gpx 1), are down-regulated dramatically by selenium (Se) deficiency. These levels in rats increase sigmoidally with increasing dietary Se and reach defined plateaus at the <b>Se</b> requirement, making <b>them</b> sensitive biomarkers for Se deficiency. These levels, however, do not further increase with super-nutritional or toxic <b>Se</b> status, making <b>them</b> ineffective for detection of high Se status. Biomarkers for high Se status are needed as super-nutritional Se intakes {{are associated with}} beneficial as well as adverse health outcomes. To characterize Se regulation of the transcriptome, we conducted 3 microarray experiments in weanling mice and rats fed Se-deficient diets supplemented with up to 5 μg Se/g diet. Results There was no effect of Se status on growth of mice fed 0 to 0. 2 μg Se/g diet or rats fed 0 to 2 μg Se/g diet, but rats fed 5 μg Se/g diet showed a 23 % decrease in growth and elevated plasma alanine aminotransferase activity, indicating Se toxicity. Rats fed 5 μg Se/g diet had significantly altered expression of 1193 liver transcripts, whereas mice or rats fed ≤ 2 μg Se/g diet had Conclusion This study shows that Se toxicity (5 μg Se/g diet) in rats vastly alters the liver transcriptome whereas Se-deficiency or high but non-toxic Se intake elicits relatively few changes. This is the first evidence that a vastly expanded number of transcriptional changes itself can be a biomarker of Se toxicity, and that identified transcripts {{can be used to}} develop molecular biomarker panels that accurately predict super-nutritional and toxic Se status. </p...|$|R

Because {{of their}} {{emphasis}} on bounded rationality and on technology as a very special kind of good, many economists dealing with the economics of technical change and the broader field of evolutionary economics tend to apply a form of theorising that deemphasise formal abstraction and the related modelling criteria of rigour, consistency and robustness (see e. g.

Concerning transmission, Nyquist wavelength-division multiplexing (NWDM) -that confines the bandwidth within the Nyquist frequency of the signal-recently gained a momentum {{as one of the}} most suitable solutions for transmission over backbone networks and commercial solutions are available by now. Besides NWDM, other transmission techniques have been proposed to approach or overcome the Nyquist limit, thus further increasing the spectral efficiency (<b>SE).</b> Among <b>them,</b> time-frequency packing (TFP) is one candidate. This method builds a superchannel, whose subcarriers significantly overlap in frequency or time or both.

In this paper, we experimentally compare, for the first time, NWDM and TFP when employing the same identical test-bed. The experiment considered the two different terabit superchannels: a polarization multiplexed (PM) - 16 quadrature amplitude modulation for the case of NWDM case, and a PM-quadrature phase-shift keying for TFP.

A cross-sectional survey is conducted using a random sample of 230 nurses across Ontario in acute care settings.

40|$|In the {{discussion}} about the rationale for spine registries, two basic questions have to be answered. The first one deals with the value of orthopaedic registries per <b>se,</b> considering <b>them</b> as observational studies and comparing the evidence they generate with that of randomised controlled trials. The second question asks if the need for registries in spine surgery {{is similar to that}} in the arthroplasty sector. The widely held view that randomised controlled trials are the 'gold standard' for evaluation and that observational methods have little or no value ignores the limitations of randomised trials. They may prove unnecessary, inappropriate, impossible, or inadequate. In addition, the external validity and hence the ability to make generalisations about the results of randomised trials is often low. Therefore, the false conflict between those who advocate randomised trials in all situations and those who believe observational data provide sufficient evidence needs to be replaced with mutual recognition of their complementary roles. The fact that many surgical techniques or technologies were introduced into the field of spine surgery without randomised trials or prospective cohort comparisons makes obvious an even increased need for spine registries compared to joint arthroplasty. An essential methodological prerequisite for a registry is a common terminology for reporting results and a sophisticated technology that networks all participants so that one central data pool is created and accessed. Recognising this need, the Spine Society of Europe has researched and developed Spine Tango, the first European spine registry, which can be accessed under www. eurospine. org...|$|R

First, novelty can transiently enhance perception. This effect is proposed to be mediated by novel stimuli activating the amygdala and enhancing early sensory processing. Second, novel stimuli can increase arousal, leading to short-lived effects on action in the first hundreds of milliseconds after presentation.

Crystalline samples with a concentration of Ti several orders of magnitude above the solubility limit have been already grown. Formation energy calculations agree with the experiment in showing mainly interstitial implantation. Calculated electronic structure presents an IB, which is in agreement with electrical measurements and models, and is expected to cause an increase of the absorption coefficient across the solar spectrum. Chalcogen-implanted Si is an efficient IR absorber when implantation is carried out at ultra-high concentrations. Substitutional implantation produces a filled band inside Si band-gap and our calculations predict that plausible co-doping with IIIA atoms (as Al, B) would allow to obtain an IB fulfilling all the needed requirements...|$|R

The CuGa/In precursors are selenized during {{rapid thermal annealing}} (RTA), by the deposition of a <b>Se</b> layer on <b>them.</b> This work investigates {{the effect of the}} Cu content in precursors on the structural and electrical properties of the absorber. Using X-ray diffraction, field emission scanning electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and Hall effect measurement, it is found that the CIGS thin films produced exhibit facetted grains and a single chalcopyrite phase with a preferred orientation along the (1 1 2) plane. A Cu-poor precursor with a Cu/() ratio of 0. 75 demonstrates a higher resistance, due to an increase in the grain boundary scattering and a reduced carrier lifetime. A Cu-rich precursor with a Cu/() ratio of 1. 15 exhibits an inappropriate second phase () in the absorber. However, the precursor with a Cu/() ratio of 0. 95 exhibits larger grains and lower resistance, which is suitable for its application to solar cells. The deposition of this precursor on Mo-coated soda lime glass substrate and further RTA causes the formation of a MoSe 2 layer at the interface of the Mo and CIGS...|$|R
5000|$|Kerry's Colm Cooper was {{originally}} described as [...] "very doubtful" [...] for the final. However, he, alongside Paul Galvin, were later declared fit, with Kerry officials dismissing claims about Cooper's fitness {{as one of}} several [...] "false stories" [...] to {{have come out of}} the county in 2009. Kieran Donaghy, who had recovered from a foot injury, was expected to appear amongst the substitutes. Donaghy criticised the media for what he termed the [...] "pandemonium" [...] that was created surrounding Cooper throughout the campaign following a drinking session with Tomás Ó <b>Sé</b> which saw <b>them</b> both removed from the team for a time. Tadhg Kennelly also had to deny he would rejoin the Sydney Swans in the AFL. Kerry made one change from the semi-final line-up; Donnacha Walsh was replaced by Tommy Walsh. Prior to the match, speculation surrounded Kennelly and Walsh over whether they would return to play in Australia if they won their first All-Ireland medals. Kennelly later signed a two-year contract with Sydney Swans, [...] as did Walsh; who signed a two-year deal with St Kilda Football Club around 2 months after the All Ireland Final ...|$|R
