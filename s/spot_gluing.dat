40|$|In {{an effort}} {{to aid in the}} work of the Cryogenic Underground Observatory of Rare Events (CUORE) in moving towards {{confirming}} the existence of Neutrinoless Double Beta Decay, a six week trip was made to Assergi, Italy to work as an Onsite Shifter for the previous generation of the experiment, CUORE- 0, as well as to aid in construction of the full CUORE detector. Furthermore, to help in understanding possible sources of experimental error, work was done analyzing images taken of the <b>glue</b> <b>spots</b> on the faces of each Tellurium Oxide detector crystals (also containing the source of the decay, Tellurium- 130). This work catalogued the pixel-areas of a number of the <b>glue</b> <b>spots</b> in the images, and generated histogram plots showing the variance across the <b>glue</b> <b>spots...</b>|$|R

50|$|Larger defects that {{interfere}} with wood finishing include dent, gouges, splits and <b>glue</b> <b>spots</b> and smears. These defects should also be removed before finishing, otherwise they will {{affect the quality of}} the finished furniture or object.

40|$|Laser fusion is a {{technology}} under development that {{will use the}} fusion of hydrogen isotopes as a power source. It uses laser energy to irradiate a small, cryogenic target containing deuterium ice, causing the deuterium in the target to compress to extreme densities and fuse. In the process of freezing the deuterium, defects can form. This work focused on defects, which are localized nonuniformities in the ice that can hinder fusion reactions. Defects {{in a variety of}} targets were catalogued using shadowgraphy, a type of imaging. Categorization was based on the defect's size, shape, depth in the ice layer, and light intensity pattern. Principal defect categories include bumps, cracks, double defects, and ghost rings. The locations of the defects were analyzed to determine whether environmental factors in the layering sphere (the spherical chamber in which the ice layer is formed) were causing the defects. This analysis showed that 1) many bumps and closed cracks occur in diametrically opposite pairs, and 2) the defects known as ghost rings occur in a specific location relative to <b>glue</b> <b>spots</b> (which are used to mount the targets) {{on one side of the}} layering sphere, suggesting that the <b>glue</b> <b>spots</b> cause these defects. The <b>glue</b> <b>spots</b> are most likely heated by nearby bright spots in the layering sphere because the defects only occur in a certain region...|$|R

5000|$|As the College of Charleston made {{improvements}} to the Sottile Theatre in early 2011, it discovered two large-scale murals hiding beneath acoustic tiles. Painted on canvas by Italian artists from New York City during the theatre's construction in the 1920s, one scene depicts a centaur and nymphs before a forested and mountainous background. The other shows Classical figures celebrating music and drama before a blue-green sea. The murals were unveiled in 1927 during the theatre's grand opening.  The College of Charleston has started to restore these masterpieces, already removing one mural for safekeeping and repair. The other mural has been uncovered and left hanging, its blemishes, damage and deterioration on display to theatre patrons, including the audiences of Spoleto Festival USA. Much of the restoration work will involve remediation of the many <b>spots</b> of <b>glue</b> used to attach acoustic tiles to the murals decades ago.|$|R

40|$|The {{object of}} this study was to verify the pain {{reducing}} effect of the “Crystal Plaster”. This is a specific plaster made from dermatological proved material with a central circular <b>spot</b> of <b>glue</b> with fine quartz crystals embedded on the dermal side. A quantity of 93 patients with chronic pain at the vertebral column could be recruited for this study. The pain sensation of the patients was registered as a value between zero and ten on the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). In all phases of the study, the pain at rest was regarded separately from the pain felt in motion. No correlation of these different pain assessments was found. In general patients reported relief of pain, but single persons told about one step increase of the VAS value after the Crystal Plaster application. Side effects by application and wearing the Crystal Plaster were slightly and did not exclude a use over several months. After one day of application of plaster the elevated average was 70 % of the pain at rest as well as in motion indicated at the beginning of the study. After three month of Crystal Plaster application the VAS values communicated by the patients refer to about 50 % and after doubling these times to near 40 % of the average of initial pain intensity. This finding counts with only minor difference for pain at rest and in motion. To gain evidence for a special contribution of the quartz crystals, Crystal Plaster were compared to similar constructed plaster with spheres of glass in the <b>spot</b> of <b>glue</b> (Placebo Plaster) : A detailed examination revealed, that the Crystal Plaster have a significantly stronger pain reducing effect on non-degenerative forms of rheumatism along the backbone. In addition, the ease of pain at rest is correlated to that of pain in motion regarding the individual patient wearing Crystal Plaster for one day. The appropriate effect of the Placebo Plaster appears more randomly. For the long-time application of Crystal Plaster, no data of a control plasters are available. Nevertheless, the continuous effect during six months by reducing the pain sensation by 60 % of the initial value, and the clear effect reported by 55 % of the users, exclude, that these findings with Crystal Plaster can be rated solely as a Placebo Effect. The degree of pain relief by Crystal Plaster is even in the range of proven pharmaceutical pain treatments. A partial explanation for the pain releasing effect of Crystal Plaster is surely the role of plaster as strong mediators of self-healing mechanisms: This Placebo Effect is involved in every kind of treatment. To explain the physiology of any kind of peripheral pain control, the Gate Control Theory is discussed.   The pronounced effect of Crystal Plaster may be enhanced by the specific plaster design in combination with its selective placement at the neuralgic sites, which is supervised by experienced osteopaths. ...|$|R
40|$|Cleaning mural {{paintings}} using microemulsions {{were applied}} {{by means of}} export poultice technique (50 : 50) mixture of Arbocel BC 1000 and Arbocel BC 200 (type of pure cellulous fibers). The cleaning fluid is added to pure cellulose until the saturation of pulp is converted into compress which apply to the cleaned surface. In current study, three global successful microemulsions were chosen {{to be used in}} cleaning models of fresco paintings from the monastery of saint Jeremiah using three kinds of available local low cost pulps (paper pulps – cotton fiber – wood mulch (sawdust)) instead of the Arbocel. The results are supported by optical microscope, and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra for the poultices after treatment to define the sol-ubilizing spots in the compresses after treatment.

40|$|Timing cues are {{important}} in many aspects of speech processing, fromidentifying segments to locating word and phrase boundaries. They vary across accents, yet representation and processing of this variation are poorly understood. We investigated whether an accent difference in vowel duration affects lexical segmentation and access. In Glasgow English (GE), /i u e o/ are shorter than in Leeds English (LE), especially for /i u/ before voiced stops and nasals. In a word-spotting experiment, GE and LE participants heard nonsense sequences (e. g. pobegloomezh) containing embedded words (gloom, glue), with segmental qualities intermediate between GE and LE. Critical vowel durations were manipulated according to accent (GE-appropriate vowels shorter than LE-appropriate ones) and phonological context (vowels shortest before voiceless stops < voiced stops/nasals < voiced fricatives). GE participants generally spotted words like gloom more accurately with GE-appropriate than LE-appropriate vowels. LE participants were less accurate than GE participants to spot words like gloom with GE-appropriate vowels, but more likely to <b>spot</b> embeddings like <b>glue.</b> These results were broadly as predicted based on the accent differences, but depended less than expected on the accent-specific phonological constraints. We discuss theoretical implications regarding the representation of duration and {{the time course of}} lexical access...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{previously}} published papers by the authors, the specific heat energy loss per cycle (the Q parameter) {{was used to}} rationalize about 120 experimental results generated from constant amplitude, push-pull, stress- or strain-controlled fatigue tests on plain and notched hot rolled AISI 304 L stainless steel specimens {{as well as from}} cold drawn un-notched bars of the same steel, tested under fully-reversed axial or torsional fatigue loadings. It has been shown that Q can be estimated starting from the cooling gradient measured at the critical point immediately after the fatigue test has been stopped. Concerning notched specimens, it was noted that a 3 mm notch tip radius was close to the limitation of applicability of the adopted temperature sensor, consisting in 0. 127 -mm-diameter thermocouples, because of the 1. 5 -to- 2 mm diameter <b>spot</b> of the <b>glue</b> which prevented to measure the maximum temperature level. In this paper, the fatigue-damage-index effectiveness of Q parameter was investigated, carrying out fully reversed axial fatigue tests on 4 -mm-thick AISI 304 L specimens, having 3, 1 and 0. 5 mm notch tip radii. The cooling gradients were measured by using an infrared camera, characterized by a 20 μm/pixels spatial resolution. As a result, all new fatigue data could be rationalized using the same scatter band published previously by the authors...|$|R

5000|$|Sanding {{is carried}} out before {{finishing}} to remove defects from the wood surface that will affect the appearance and performance of finishes that are subsequently applied to the wood. These defects include cutter marks and burns, scratches and indentations, small <b>glue</b> <b>spots</b> and raised grain. Sanding {{should not be used}} to eliminate larger defects such as gouges, and various forms of discolouration. Other techniques are used to remove these defects (see below). The key to preparing a defect free surface is to develop a sanding schedule that will quickly eliminate defects and leave the surface smooth enough so that tiny scratches produced by sanding cannot be seen when the wood is finished. A sanding schedule usually begins with sandpaper that is coarse enough to remove larger defects (typically 80 or 100 grit, but sometimes higher if the surface is already quite smooth), and progresses through a series of sandpaper grades that gradually remove the sanding scratches created by the previous sanding steps. A typical sanding schedule prior to wood finishing might involve sanding wood along the grain with the following grades of sandpaper, 80, 100, 120, 150 and finishing with 180 and sometimes 220 grit. The precise sanding schedule is a matter of trial and error because the appearance of a sanded surface depends on the wood you are sanding and the finish that will subsequently be applied to the wood. According to Nagyszalanczy, coarse grained woods with large pores such as oak hide sanding scratches better than fine grained wood and hence with such species {{it may be possible to}} use 180 or even 150 grit sandpaper as the final step in the sanding schedule. Conversely, sanding scratches are more easily seen in finer grained, harder woods and also end-grain, and hence, they require finer sandpaper (220 grit) during the final sanding stage. The sandpaper selected for the final sanding stage affects the colour of stained wood, and therefore when staining is part of finishing avoid sanding the wood to a very smooth finish. On the other hand, according to Nagyszalanczy if you are using an oil-based finish, it is desirable to sand the wood using higher grit sandpaper (400 grit) because oil tends to highlight sanding scratches. Sanding is very good at removing defects at wood surfaces, but it creates a surface that contains minute scratches in the form of microscopic valleys and ridges, and also slivers of wood cell wall material that are attached to the underlying wood. These sanding ridges and slivers of wood swell and spring-up, respectively, when sanded wood is finished with water-based finishes, creating a rough fuzzy surface. This defect is known as grain raising. It can be eliminated by wetting the surface with water, leaving the wood to dry and then lightly sanding the wood to remove the ‘raised grain’.|$|R
