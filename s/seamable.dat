40|$|NASA anticipates {{launching}} the Next Generation Space Telescope (NGST) mission [...] whose {{purpose is to}} examine the origins of our universe by making measurements in the infrared portion of the spectrum [...] in 2009. So that the telescope can operate at very low temperatures (less than 100 K), a halo orbit about the second Lagrangian point (L 2) is being considered because it is far from Earth and its reflected sunlight. The Sun-Earth L 2 point is located 1. 53 10 (exp 6) km from the Earth in the direction away from the Sun. This mission presents new challenges in many areas of technology, including the development of a multilayer insulation sunshield for the telescope. This sunshield is required to be large (proposed dimensions of approximately 33 by 14 m), storable, deployable, and lightweight. In addition, its polymer film layers must be <b>seamable,</b> foldable, and resistant to tearing and creep, with low outgassing. The sunshield must maintain its structural integrity and its Sun-facing side must maintain a low solar absorptance to thermal emittance ratio (alpha/epsilon) over the planned 10 -yr mission duration including over 80, 000 hr facing constant sunlight...|$|E
