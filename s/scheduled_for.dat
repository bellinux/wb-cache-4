40|$|Conserving {{the energy}} for motion is an {{important}} yet notwell-addressed problem in mobile sensor networks. In this paper, we study the problem of optimizing sensor movement for energy efficiency. We adopt a complete energy model to characterize the entire energy consumption in movement. Based on the model, we propose an optimal velocity <b>schedule</b> <b>for</b> minimizing energy consumption when the road condition is uniform; and a near optimal velocity <b>schedule</b> <b>for</b> the variable road condition by using continuous-state dynamic programming. Considering the variety in motion hardware, we also design one velocity <b>schedule</b> <b>for</b> simple microcontrollers, and one velocity <b>schedule</b> <b>for</b> relatively complex microcontrollers, respectively. Simulation results show that our velocity planning may have significant impact on energy conservation...|$|R

40|$|Basic Match <b>Schedules</b> are {{important}} <b>for</b> constructing sports timetables. Firstly these schedules guarantee {{the fairness of}} the sports competitions and secondly they reduce the complexity of the problem. This paper presents an approach to the problem of finding Basic Match <b>Schedules</b> <b>for</b> sports competitions. The approach is clarified by applying it to the Dutch volleyball competition. By using graph representation and theory this approach has the potential to classify sports competitions and to build libraries with Basic Match <b>Schedules</b> <b>for</b> each class of sports competitions. As an example we present an overview of some Basic Match <b>Schedules</b> <b>for</b> the volleyball competition...|$|R
