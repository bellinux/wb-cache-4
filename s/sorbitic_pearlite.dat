40|$|Recently, {{high carbon}} steel tends to be widely used for machine and {{construction}} parts. The structure of these {{high carbon steel}}s is pearlite when used as rolled or as forged. However, it is usually used as tough sorbite or <b>sorbitic</b> <b>pearlite</b> structures made by heat treatment. The welding of high carbon steel is less useful because of its high carbon equivalent, but is sometimes needed in actual cases. In this paper, {{the relationship between the}} impact property and the structure of high carbon steel was first investigated using two materials. The first one is S 58 C whose structures are pearlite and sorbite. Heat treatment is a usual one as the high temperature heat treatment simulating heat affected zone. The second is the parts of welded rail joints, whose structures are also pearlite and sorbite. Secondly, the effect of structure on fatigue property was studied with respect to the above-mentioned sobite structure of S 58 C and two structures of the welded rail joint. The main results obtained are as follows. (1) In both properties, the sorbite structure made by heat treatment or welding is superior to the pearlite structure, and in each of the two structures the finer structure shows better properties. (2) In case of being changed into pearlite structure after heat treatment or welding, both properties of sorbite structure before heat treatment or welding are better than those of pearlite structure before heat treatment or welding. (3) In the case of heat treatments from 1373 K to 1573 K corresponding to the simulating high temperature heat affected zone, the grain size in the bond and its neighborhood of welding ioints is made coarser, and consequently both properties are deteriorated. (4) Finally, the impact property increases as the grain size becomes finer and the hardness lowers: On the other hand, the fatigue property does not depend largely on the grain size but depend on the hardness...|$|E
