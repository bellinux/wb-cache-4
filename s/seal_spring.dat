5|$|Two days later, the {{starboard}} propshaft <b>seal</b> <b>sprung</b> a major leak in the after engine room. A makeshift locking clamp was jury-rigged {{to contain the}} leak. On 12 March, the trouble-plagued fathometer ceased operation when its transducer header flooded, grounding out the entire system. Since the transducer head was located outside the boat's pressure hull, {{it could not be}} repaired except in drydock. Without an operational fathometer, Triton could be vulnerable to grounding or collision with uncharted submerged formations. It was subsequently determined that the cabling to the Tritons fathometer head, located in the bulbous forefoot of her bow, had not been properly insulated, and the constant buffeting from Tritons high speed caused these cables to rupture, rendering the fathometer inoperable.|$|R

25|$|Cold water kits {{can be used}} {{to reduce}} the risk of {{freezing}} inside the regulator. Some regulators come with this as standard, and some others can be retrofitted. Environmental sealing of the diaphragm main spring chamber using a soft secondary diaphragm and hydrostatic transmitter or a silicone, alcohol or glycol/water mixture antifreeze liquid in the <b>sealed</b> <b>spring</b> compartment can be used for a diaphragm regulator. Silicone grease in the spring chamber can be used on a piston first stage. The Poseidon Xstream first stage insulates the external spring and spring housing from the rest of the regulator, so that it is less chilled by the expanding air, and provides large slots in the housing so that the spring can be warmed by the water, thus avoiding the problem of freezing up the external spring.|$|R

5000|$|The most {{well-known}} {{aspect of his}} managing career is the early development of Joe DiMaggio's career. Vince DiMaggio was signed by the team in 1932 and {{towards the end of}} the season Augie Galan, the starting shortstop, requested to be able to miss the final four games of the season to vacation in Hawaii. The team would be left without a shortstop, so Vince suggested to Caveney that his little brother, playing semi-pro ball at the time, could fill in for a few games, and Caveney agreed. [...] Although he did not play great in the few games, he was invited to the <b>Seals</b> <b>spring</b> training the next season, when he made the opening day team. Joe DiMaggio's defensive play at shortstop was plagued by errors, both fielding errors and overthrowing first base, which persisted into the regular season in 1933. Frustrated by play, Caveney moved Joe into the outfield in the fourth game of the season which became his position for the remainder of the season and his career.|$|R

25|$|The engine has {{a single}} rotor with a {{capacity}} of 497cc. The rotor spins on an eccentric shaft in a peritrochoid (Mazda uses an epitrochoid) chamber, giving three rotations of the crankshaft for every 360° of rotor travel. Compression ratio is 9.4:1. The eccentric shaft runs on plain bearings, which were better than rollers for heat dissipation. Combustion sealing utilised Apex, corner and side seals. At the three rotor apexes, tip sealing was accomplished with a three-piece seal tensioned by a blade <b>spring.</b> Apex <b>seals</b> were made of a special material known as Ferro Tic, which {{was a combination of}} sintered ferrous alloy and titanium carbide. The surface of the trochoid chamber which the apex seals rubbed along was coated with a CEM (composite electrochemical material) consisting of nickel silicon carbide. Side sealing used one blade-like <b>seal</b> and <b>spring</b> for each rotor face on each side (six side seals in total). Corner <b>seals</b> and <b>springs</b> finished the isolation of combustion. Blow-by gases are recirculated into the combustion process. The rotor spins backward in relation to the motorcycle. Primary power transfer to the clutch and transmission is by duplex chain.|$|R
40|$|A dynamic {{analysis}} of a free piston Vuilleumier cycle heat pump was performed by a time-stepping integration method. The nonlinear relationship between displacement and force for pistons was taken into account for the motion of reciprocating components, {{in addition to the}} pressure change of working gas, nonlinear viscous dissipative force due to an oscillating flow and discontinuous damping force caused by solid friction. The displacement of pistons and pressure changes in the Vuilleumier cycle heat pump were integrated by an ideal isothermal thermodynamic relationship. It was assumed that the flow friction was proportional to the kinematic pressure of working gas, and that the solid friction at the seals was due to the functions of the working gas pressure and the tension of <b>seal</b> <b>springs.</b> In order to investigate the dependence of the characteristics of a machine on various dynamical parameters, some calculations were performed for a proposed case study machine and discussed. The roles of working gas pressure, the displacer piston rod and dissipative force due to flow and solid friction were clarified, and the proposed method was found to be very effective in predicting dynamic behavior of free piston Vuilleumier cycle heat pumps and in designing the machine components...|$|R

With the melting of the island's snow pack, local greens and berries not picked during the previous fall's harvest, begin to appear and were added to the local diet. Depending on the time the ice pack began to break up, Cup'ig families would leave their winter villages and move to <b>spring</b> <b>seal</b> camps.
