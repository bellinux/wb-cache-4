25|$|Voicemail is the {{managing}} of telephone messages from a centralized data <b>storing</b> <b>system.</b> Voicemail is stored on hard disk drives, media generally used by computers {{in order to}} store other forms of data. Messages are recorded in digitized natural human voice similar to how music is stored on a compact disc. To retrieve and to play back messages, a user calls the system from any phone, {{and his or her}} messages can be retrieved immediately. The first voicemail system, known as the Speech Filing System (SFS), was invented by Stephen J. Boies in 1973. What started as a research project at the IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center, the first working prototype became available to telephone users in 1975.|$|E

The design {{and implementation of the}} physical store are in the style of C++ standard template library.

The physical <b>store</b> <b>system</b> is part of the Know-It-All database project, under way at Concordia University. The contents of the physical <b>store</b> <b>system</b> are described using SQL data definition language. The main tasks of the physical <b>store</b> <b>system</b> are the bulk-loading of data, the support for the bulk creation of indexes, and data retrieval. The design hides the use of the secondary store. The problems with the existing physical stores are a lack of type checking and type safety. Our design and implementation draw upon advanced uses of C++ templates, as typified by the standard template library, type lists, the tuple library from boost. org, and dynamic loading.

Surakarta: Industrial Engineering Department, Faculty of Engineering, Sebelas Maret University, December 2010. Prosthetic {{has been}} {{developed}} through the utilization of energy <b>storing</b> <b>system</b> in reducing energy consumption not only in normal walking but also in fast walking. Fast walking is one of parameter to measure the performance of prosthetic. A two bar mechanism endoskeletal above knee prosthetic with energy <b>storing</b> <b>system</b> is already equipped with energy <b>storing</b> <b>system</b> which used a gas spring installed in its knee joint. This research objectives is to observe and calculate the ability of this prosthetic. This study has include both laboratory observation and mathematically model of dynamic cycle gait. Modelling dynamic cycle gait using the lagrangian equation of motion to determine the external work and its components, the torque and the exerted force. The parameter was gained from the capture of amputee walking cycle on fast walking activity The result {{of this research is}} eight phase mathematical model of dynamic gait with their value of dynamic parameter. Based on data processing can be conclude that the new developed prosthetic design can accommodate all the phases except the seventh phase (mid swing phase) which was caused by inappropriate spring response.

40|$|Abstract — The {{total energy}} demand and per capita energy demand are {{increasing}} day by day. So the dependency on {{renewable energy sources}} like wind and solar is also increasing. The wind speed variations causes serious power quality problems during integration of wind turbine with the grid. The power control block consisting of rotor side controller block and grid side control block helps to overcome these problems. The DFIG is capable of producing power in above and below synchronous speed. The power supplied to the grid through stator and rotor. In this paper, a battery energy <b>storing</b> <b>system</b> (BESS) is introduced in between the inverter and converters section.

In this paper we compare fully structured, semi-structured and unstructured data and present their typical appliance. Moreover, we discuss how all data structures can be combined and stored for one application and consider three synchronization design alternatives to keep the distributed data storages consistent. Furthermore, we present the semantic wiki KiWi, which uses an RDF triplestore in combination with a relational database as basis for the persistence of data, and discuss its concrete implementation and design decisions. ...|$|E
