40|$|Four grazing {{experiments}} {{were conducted with}} red deer stags, three with weaner stags (start 6 months old; end 12 months old) and one with yearling stags (start 15 months old; end 21 months old). In New Zealand (NZ) the calving season for red deer is during late spring/early summer (November/December) and the calves are normally weaned in late February/early March. The price schedule for venison is highest during August to November, in response to Northern Hemisphere export market demand and is greater for carcasses of 50 kg or above. However, there is no well defined system for meat production from deer. The objective of these studies was to evaluate different systems of growing red deer stags to a <b>slaughter</b> <b>liveweight</b> (LW) of 92 kg (> 50 kg carcass weight (CW)) by one year of age or less, {{by the end of}} November. Thus an attempt was made to define a system of meat production from deer that was most profitable to NZ venison producers. [ [...] . full abstract in file 01 _front...|$|E
40|$|A {{summary of}} four {{experiments}} which used Holstein/Friesian bulls and a fifth which used continental cross bulls {{to determine the}} effect of feeding ad libitum concentrates on animal prefomance. • The Barley soyabean meal ration provided consistent liveweight gain (1. 25 kg/day) and similar cold carcass weight (237 kg) in all four experiments using Holstein and Friesian Bulls. • The Low energy treatment group (Experiment 1) had a liveweight gain of 1. 14 kg/day and a cold carcass of 220 kg, i. e. 21 kg lower than that achieved on the High energy treatment group which had a liveweight gain of 1. 26 kg/day and a cold carcass of 241 kg. • Providing animals with a summer period outdoors at pasture compared with a continuous period indoors, in general had the effect of improving daily liveweight gain and feed conversion efficiency when animals were offered ad libitum concentrate diet. The effect was greatest when autumn-born calves spent the final 180 days prior to slaughter at pasture. • Restricting the concentrate allowance at pasture brought about a 1. 5 unit improvement in FCR carcass, however, at a similar slaughter age this treatment group produced carcasses that were 22 and 21 kg lighter than the control in two respective experiments. • The current economic climate for beef production does not permit the production of red veal in Ireland. However, when markets develop in the Mediterranean countries there will be opportunities to produce red veal carcasses for those markets using male bulls from the Holstein/Friesian herds. • Weaned continental cross suckler bulls slaughtered off an ad libitum concentrate diet at 550 kg liveweight had a feed conversion efficiency of 8. 2 kg concentrate DM per kg carcass produced. The corresponding value at 650 kg <b>slaughter,</b> <b>liveweight</b> was 9. 5 kg. End of Project ReportEuropean Union Structural Funds (EAGGF...|$|E
40|$|Forty four weaner {{red deer}} (Cervus elaphus) fawns (26 stags; 18 hinds) {{were used to}} {{investigate}} the effects of grazing pure red clover (Trifolium pratense) or perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) /white clover (Trifolium repens) pastures and immunisation against melatonin upon growth and venison production, {{with the objective of}} the stags attaining a minimum target <b>slaughter</b> <b>liveweight</b> (92 kg LW;> 50 kg carcass) by 12 month of age. The experiment was conducted at the Deer Unit Massey University, NZ, during 1991. The animals were randomly allocated into eight treatment groups (starting on 13 March 1991), with the combination of pasture types ((pure red clover (RC) or perennial ryegrass/white clover (PRG/WC), sex (male or female) and immunisation (against melatonin or placebo only). The deer were rotationally grazed on either RC or PRG/WC pasture (feed allowances 6, 7 kg DM/h/day, respectively) during autumn and spring. During winter, all animals were combined and grazed together on PRG/WC pasture (6 kg DM/h/day feed allowance), at a pasture residual DM of 1100 kg DM/ha. The subcutaneous anti-melatonin injections were administered to the immunisation groups at birth and at weaning. Pre-grazing herbage mass for RC or PRG/WC were respectively 3568, 3706 kg DM/ha in autumn; 2726, 2150 kg DM/ha in spring; 1736 kg DM/ha in winter. Post-grazing herbage mass for RC or PRG/WC averaged at 1822, 1882, in autumn; 1705, 1334, in spring; and 1170 kg DM/ha in winter, respectively. Total nitrogen (N) and organic matter digestibility (OMD) concentration of both feed on offer (FO) and diet selected (DS) were higher in RC than PRG/WC (FO total N: 3. 4 vs 3. 4 % DM in autumn, 4. 1 vs 2. 6 % DM in spring; FO OMD: 77. 3 vs 78. 6 % OM in autumn, 84. 5 vs 80. 3 % OM in spring; DS total N: 4. 2 vs 3. 9 % DM in autumn, 4. 7 vs 3. 3 % DM in spring; DS OMD: 84. 2 vs 83. 2 % OM in autumn, 87. 7 vs 82. 4 % OM in spring). Liveweight gain (LWG) of RC stags and hinds was significantly higher than PRG/WC animals in autumn (237 vs 207; 197 vs 159 g/d; P 0. 05). Weaner stags and hinds grazing RC forage had significantly higher voluntary feed intake (VFI) than the comparable animals grazing PRG/WC pasture in either autumn (P 92 kg LW; 50 kg carcass) by 12 -month of age at the end of November, compared to 90 % of PRG/WC stags. Carcass weights (kg) and dressing percentage (%) of RC stags were significantly higher than PRG/WC stags (58. 9 vs 53. 3 kg, P 0. 05) either after or before being adjusted to equal carcass weight. The immunisation treatment did not provide any significant responses (P> 0. 05) in LWG and did not affect plasma prolactin concentrations. The immunisation against melatonin treatment did not give any significant effects (P> 0. 05) on all measurements of carcass production. In conclusion, these studies show that early venison production from grazed PRG/WC pastures is possible, and that this can be further improved by inputs of RC. Weaner red deer grazing red clover forage during autumn and spring grew and produced venison better than animals grazing conventional PRG/WC pastures. The immunisation against melatonin did not provide any significant effects on growth and venison production from weaner red deer grazing either RC or PRG/WC forages. RC offers very good potential as a special purpose forage for venison production...|$|E

Effects of {{supplementary}} {{concentrates on}} growth and partitioning of nutrients between different body components in steers fed on grass silage at similar levels of metabolisable energy intake. Journal of Agricultural Science, 141, 103 - 112. A comparative slaughter experiment {{was carried out}} {{to examine the effects}} of feeding either grass silage alone or a mixed diet of silage and concentrate on animal performance and the partitioning of nutrients between lean and fat deposition in steers. Eighteen Hereford?Friesian steers were randomly assigned to two dietary treatments; grass silage only (S) or a mixture of grass silage and a barley/soya bean meal concentrate (80 [ratio] 20 on fresh basis) in the ratio of 60 [ratio] 40 (on a metabolizable energy basis; SC), and to one of three target <b>slaughter</b> <b>liveweights,</b> 250, 350 or 500 kg. Metabolizable energy (ME) intake was maintained at 800 kJ ME per kg metabolic liveweight (kg 0 ? 75) per day.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the quality of fresh and cooked meat, and the nutritive value of this meat from 62 male Australian feral goats. The goats were slaughtered at 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 and 70 kg liveweights. Half of the goats were castrated and half were left as intact animals. The quality profiles of meat (e. g. pH, colour, pigment concentrations, cooking loss, shear force value and eating quality of cooked meat) from both castrated and intact feral goats started to decrease when animals were <b>slaughtered</b> at heavier <b>liveweights</b> (e. g. above 40 kg). The nutritive value of the meat (chemical compositions, fatty acids and total cholesterol concentrations) changed when animals were castrated and had heavier slaughter weights. Overall, we recommend that 40 kg liveweight is the heaviest slaughter weight, since the quality characteristics of meat will be lower when feral goats were slaughtered above 40 kg liveweight...|$|R
40|$|Data for a {{total of}} {{approximately}} 1100 lambs tested in 12 trials from 1992 to 1995 in commercial lamb test stations in Quebec were used to determine the effect of sex, sire breed and genetic type on growth performance and carcass characteristics. Lambs were housed two to a pen and fed commercial diets. Maximum test length was 112 d. Lambs were <b>slaughtered</b> when their <b>liveweight</b> was approximately 47 +/- 5 kg for the males and 43 +/- 4 kg for the females. Feed intake and growth rate were measured during the test, and carcass measurements were taken at slaughter and at 24 h following slaughter. Feed intake was the average for the pen, while the growth and carcass measurements were taken individually. Males ate more per day, had better gain and were younger at slaughter than females. Females had more body fat and better carcass conformation scores than males. However, males did not have a greater loin muscle thickness compared to females. Lambs sired by Hampshire or Suffolk rams had superior growth performance and leaner carcasses than lambs sired by Dorset rams. However, Hampshire and Suffolk-sired lambs did not have a greater loin muscle thickness compared to Dorset-sired lambs. Analysis of different genetic types did not demonstrate a pronounced effect on lamb performance. No specific genetic composition was clearly superior to the others for the various variables studied.

40|$|Avaliou-se o efeito do tratamento materno e dieta de terminação, sobre o diâmetro, frequências dos tipos de fibras musculares vermelhas (SO - Slow Oxidative), brancas (FG - Fast Glycolytic) e intermediárias (FOG - Fast Oxidative Glycolytic), o ganho de peso, força de cisalhamento e perdas de peso por cozimento do músculo semitendinosus e longissimus lumborum de cordeiros. Foram utilizadas oitenta ovelhas Santa Inês, cobertas com reprodutores Dorper, alimentadas com diferentes teores em proteína bruta no terço inicial de gestação. As dietas de terminação dos cordeiros foram sem grão de girassol (16, 18 % de PB e 79, 64 % NDT) e com grão de girassol (15, 03 % de PB e 78, 96 % de NDT). Os cordeiros foram abatidos com 32, 31 ± 1, 75 de peso vivo e amostras do M. semitendinosus e longissimus lumborum, da meia carcaça esquerda, foram retiradas para mensuração do diâmetro e frequência dos tipos de fibras musculares e análise das características físicas da carne. Cordeiros filhos de ovelhas alimentadas no terço inicial da gestação com dietas à base de 8, 80 %; 11, 06 %; 12, 27 % e 15, 03 % de proteína bruta não apresentaram diferença para diâmetro das fibras musculares. O ganho de peso dos cordeiros apresentou correlação positiva com o aumento do diâmetro dos três tipos de fibras musculares no M. longissimus lumborum. Tipos de partos tiveram efeito para área de olho de lombo (simples = 12, 37 e duplo = 11, 26 cm 2). O músculo M. longissimus lumborum apresentou maior maciez que o M. semitendinosus, independente da dieta de terminação e tipo de parto. Para força de cisalhamento e perda de peso por cozimento, os cordeiros poderão ser terminados com dietas com ou sem grãos de girassol. It were {{evaluated}} {{the effects of}} maternal feeding and finishing diets on the physical characteristics of carcasses, diameter and frequencies of muscle fibers SO (Slow Oxidative), FG (Fast Glycolytic) and FOG (Fast Oxidative Glycolytic), the liveweight gain, shearing forces and weight losses under cooking of the M. semitendinosus and longissimus lumborum muscles of offsprings from eighty Santa Ines ewes which were mated with Dorper ram and fed with 8. 80, 11. 06, 12, 27 and 15. 03 % of crude protein at the first third period of the pregnancy. The finishing diets were prepared with no sunflower grains (16. 18 % CP and 79. 64 % TDN) and with sunflower grains (15. 03 % CP and 78. 96 % TDN). The lambs were <b>slaughtered</b> at the <b>liveweight</b> of 32. 31 ± 1. 75 kg. Postmortem samples were taken at {{the left side of}} half carcasses. There was no difference of the maternal feeding in the diameter of muscular fibers. The liveweight gain was positively correlated to the diameter of the three types of muscular fibers in the M. longissimus lumborum. The type of birth had influence in the loin eye area (simple = 12. 37 and double = 11. 26 cm 2). There were significant effects of the feedlot diet in the diameter of SO fibers in M. longissimus lumborum and in FG fibers in the M. semitendinosus. The M. longissimus lumborum presented higher tenderness than the M. semitendinosus under both finishing diets and type of birth.
