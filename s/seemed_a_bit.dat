25|$|Following {{deposition}} of Rodezno Arellano continued as {{a rising star}} in the movement; despite his status of Rodezno's companion, he remained on good terms with the Carlist leader Fal Conde. As part of re-modeling of the party command structures, in 1934 Arellano was appointed jefe of the newly created Youth Section; initially he controlled Juventud Tradicionalista, student AET and paramilitary Requeté organizations, though there was another separate section soon created for the militia later on. At that time he <b>seemed</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of a pivotal figure, in-between possibilist Rodezno's strategy and the intransigence of Fal. He continued within Bloque Nacional until Fal ordered termination of the alliance. By some scholars he is quoted as a speaker endorsing violent subversive anti-Republican strategy and contributing to belligerent spirit; others consider him representative of the new Carlist generation, already inclined towards authoritarism. In 1936 he was re-elected to the Cortes from the same Navarrese constituency.|$|E
500|$|The anime film of Hotarubi no Mori e {{was well}} {{received}} by its reviewers, and likened to {{the works of}} Hayao Miyazaki of Studio Ghibli and Makoto Shinkai. UK Anime Network's Andy Hanley, who attended a screening at the Scotland Loves Animation festival, said it is [...] "beautiful in its simplicity", though noting that the climax <b>seemed</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> rushed and sudden, leaving the audience to struggle with their emotions.|$|E
500|$|Filming {{commenced}} on 20 August 1968 after {{a summer}} of pre-production. Director Ken Turner, who headed the location unit, recalled that The Secret Service became a complex series to shoot because it incorporated three design elements (studio puppet filming, studio special effects filming and live-action location filming). In a reversal to the practice used on earlier Supermarionation productions, location filming needed to be completed first before work could start at the Century 21 Studios. In Turner's words, [...] "We felt that somebody {{had to take the}} location stuff by the balls, get it shot and then hand it over to the director to fit his puppet stuff in. I suppose that <b>seemed</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> back to front but with that programme it was what worked out best." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Dangerously in Love 2" [...] {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Natalie Nichols of Los Angeles Times {{stated that the}} song {{is just one of}} many wailing ballads designed to demonstrate [...] "the soulful bleating of Beyonce, the centerpiece of R star trio Destiny's Child." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine gave a mixed review of the song, stating that it <b>seemed</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> dated and that it was [...] "a near-carbon copy of Survivor’s melodramatic 'Dangerously in Love' [...] is completely superfluous." [...] While covering the 2004 reunion of Destiny's Child, Jet Magazine considered the song a major hit of Beyoncé's debut album. In an article from Teen Ink, the song was noted as one of the top [...] "lush ballads" [...] of the album. [...] "Dangerously in Love 2" [...] won in the category Best Female R Vocal Performance at the 46th Grammy Awards on February 8, 2004.|$|E
500|$|Tony Bennett and Lady Gaga: Cheek to Cheek Live! {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics. Kathryn Shattuck of The New York Times {{said that is}} difficult to recognize Lady Gaga [...] "out of her usual get-ups: the meat dresses, seashell bikinis, towering stilettos and skyscraper hair" [...] and praised Bennett's vocals [...] "his voice still strong at 88, take on the Great American Songbook and prove again that the classics can bridge many divides." [...] Soraya Nadia McDonald of The Washington Post wrote [...] "It's become practically cliché to note what an odd couple they make, so we'll just remind you they're actually both divine live performers and they've got great chemistry." [...] Jeff Pfeiffer from Channel Guide said that although Bennett and Gaga [...] "engage in some playfulness and camaraderie which is generally fun, though Lady Gaga may be trying too hard at times". He added that [...] "The artists and the terrific orchestra are in fine form, and though the editing between numbers <b>seemed</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> rapid on occasion, the production and directing is effective to capture the performances".|$|E
500|$|When Smallville first began, Lana was in {{a romantic}} {{relationship}} with Whitney Fordman, the star quarterback of the football team. Kreuk believes that Lana truly {{was in love with}} Whitney when they first started dating, {{but by the time the}} audience first sees her in the pilot she is no longer in that same state of mind. Kreuk believes that by the time of the pilot Lana had grown “comfortable” with Whitney, and that was where their relationship ended. Though Lana had growing feelings for Clark, Kreuk feels that the producers rushed the coupling of Clark and Lana at the end of the second season. She believes that with everything that had happened throughout the season between the two characters, it <b>seemed</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of a stretch for Lana to just quickly fall into Clark's arms. The next season began to develop more of the relationship between Lex and Lana. Kreuk believes that Lana cares for Lex as a friend, and that she recognizes the [...] "undertones" [...] that Lex may be placing on their relationship, but that Lana tends to ignore them. Kreuk recognizes that Lex is a big part of Lana's life, and that Lana tries to pay more attention to the good that Lex does and focus less on the darker aspects of his life.|$|E

500|$|Although Canning {{wrote that}} [...] "the writers did {{a fine job}} of {{incorporating}} the tenure, Will's terrible Spanish and the songs into the storylines", Will's lack of Spanish skills was questioned by other reviewers. Entertainment Weekly Joseph Brannigan Lynch said this did not [...] "seem to gel with the passionate Will Schuester I remember from season 1", and Slezak expressed surprise that [...] "he hadn't even mastered the basics of the language!", as did Chaney. Slezak also said Will, as evidenced by his [...] "La Cucaracha" [...] rendition for his class, was [...] "suddenly dumb as the cardboard box that Finn winningly turned into a robot head", and Chaney commented, [...] "Mr. Schuester always <b>seemed</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> more sensitive than this." [...] VanDerWerff wrote of [...] "the weird, dark despair {{at the heart of}} Will's plight: He's a high school Spanish teacher, and he mostly is that because he doesn't know what else to do." [...] He added, [...] "I think this was probably the best episode for the character since early season one." [...] Canning stated that [...] "the tension between Will and Emma was a welcome change", and Votta commented on the episode's less dramatic ending with Will's apology and [...] "celebrating Emma's new-found tenure with a dinner" [...] with the conclusion, [...] "sometimes you don't need a big bang to get oomph out of an episode". Chaney, however, was puzzled as to why Emma was given teaching tenure [...] "when she's been working at McKinley as a guidance counselor and handing out absolutely horrifying self-made pamphlets".|$|E
2500|$|However, a {{transverse}} wave apparently required the propagating medium {{to behave as}} a solid, {{as opposed to a}} gas or fluid. The idea of a solid that did not interact with other matter <b>seemed</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> odd, and Augustin-Louis Cauchy suggested that perhaps {{there was some sort of}} [...] "dragging", or [...] "entrainment", but this made the aberration measurements difficult to understand. He also suggested that the absence of longitudinal waves suggested that the aether had negative compressibility. George Green pointed out that such a fluid would be unstable. George Gabriel Stokes became a champion of the entrainment interpretation, developing a model in which the aether might be (by analogy with pine pitch) rigid at very high frequencies and fluid at lower speeds. Thus the Earth could move through it fairly freely, but it would be rigid enough to support light.|$|E
2500|$|This {{time it is}} {{daughter}} and mom who switch bodies, following the successful intervention of the somewhat wacky and eccentric scientist grandpa, whose constant desire to improve the world resembles the enthusiasm of Christopher Lloyd's character (Dr. Emmett Brown - 'Doc') from the movie [...] "Back to the Future." [...] The confusion that ensues creates a funny and exciting novel. About the book, [...] Nogradi said, [...] "The idea of mom and daughter swapping bodies was an idea raised by children {{at one of the}} book signings. At first I was hesitant to write the book, because writing a story about the inner feelings and thoughts of a small girl and her mother <b>seemed</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> scary, but it {{became one of the most}} cherished books I ever wrote." [...] The book was made into a comedy and was premiered in theaters in Hungary.|$|E

2500|$|Overall, {{the tour}} {{received}} positive reviews throughout its run. Many critics praised McEntire's {{ability to adapt}} her country roots into a rock and roll atmosphere. Although McEntire was given the highest praise, many admired Clarkson's ability to stand her ground amongst one of music's biggest legends. However, one critic noted Clarkson's awe of McEntire, writing that at times she <b>seemed</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> star struck. The critic went on to state: [...] "McEntire exhibited a honed mastery of the material – be it Clarkson's or her own – and a professional command of the stage. Clarkson will undoubtedly learn {{a lot in the}} coming month." [...] Brian Dukes of the Fayetteville Observer wrote: [...] "When the pair teamed up on Clarkson's [...] "Beautiful Disaster", there was no question why McEntire and Clarkson had toured together. A better question would be: [...] "Why did they wait so long?", while Craig Shelbrune from CMT wrote, [...] "...2 Worlds, 2 Voices is likely to go down as one of McEntire's most memorable tours." ...|$|E
