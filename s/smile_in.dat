25|$|After {{destroying}} the entire Pandava camp, Ashwatthama proceeds towards Duryodana with the cut-off {{heads of the}} Upapandavas. He told Duryodhana that he only managed to kill the Pandava's children as the Pandavas were not there, and this makes Duryodhana happy, as that means the Pandava lineage would die out. Duryodhana then, having heard the news that was so agreeable to his heart, regained his senses and praised Ashwatthama for achieving what Bhishma, Drona, and Karna had failed to accomplish. Duryodhana died happily with a <b>smile</b> <b>in</b> his face. At the same time, Sanjaya loses his divine sight, {{which he had been}} using to update Duryodhana's father Dhritarashtra.|$|E
25|$|When Lee {{produced}} a photo booklet titled 'Young Lovers' in June 1975, {{he decided to}} promote it using posters {{on the sides of}} London buses. Intrigued by his novel use of the unconventional space and keen to demonstrate the creative opportunities available, the London Transport Board gave Lee a hundred bus-sides for a year to use for advertising campaigns. Starting with a dramatic poster for Nikon, featuring Lee's own distinctive gold toothed <b>smile</b> <b>in</b> close up, he used the space to display prominently signed shots for clients including Austin Reed, British Rail and Pringle of Scotland; making headlines when he put a full frontal nude {{on the side of the}} Number 19 buses for French Connection, much to the consternation of campaigners such as Mary Whitehouse.|$|E

According to the two agents, the Gulf Cartel sicarios outnumbered and outgunned them. Their only way out was to talk their way out. Cárdenas arrived seconds later in a white Jeep Cherokee, approaching the two agents. In his waistband, he wore a Colt pistol with a gold grip; in his hands, a gold-plated AK-47. Cárdenas pounded the Ford Bronco and calmly asked for the informant. Fuentes flashed his FBI badge, giving Cárdenas a <b>smile.</b> <b>In</b> an ongoing discourse, Cárdenas told the agents that he would shoot them {{if they did not}} surrender. The two agents refused to do so, saying they were dead either way. He gave them another choice: to hand over the informant. Again, they refused.|$|E
25|$|In late 1985, Roth {{assembled}} a virtuoso solo band, consisting of guitarist Steve Vai (previously of Frank Zappa's band), bassist Billy Sheehan (previously of Talas), and drummer Gregg Bissonette (previously of Maynard Ferguson's big band). With veteran Van Halen producer Ted Templeman producing, Roth released his debut solo LP, Eat 'Em and <b>Smile</b> <b>in</b> July 1986. The album saw Roth return to hard rock music, but also incorporated {{some of his}} more eclectic musical tastes, ranging from jazz to speed metal. Eat 'Em and Smile met with widespread commercial and critical success, charting at No. 4 on the Billboard Top 200, and selling over 2 million copies in the U.S. alone. Roth and his band toured arenas extensively in support of Eat 'Em and Smile (see Eat 'Em and Smile Tour), {{before returning to the}} studio in 1987 to record a follow-up.|$|E

25|$|The mystery man {{fails to}} return by {{the eve of}} Chinese New Year as promised. Six months later, the villagers finally run out of {{patience}} and resolve to kill the prisoners. The task falls on Ma after a drawing of lots. Not daring to commit murder, Ma instead hides the prisoners in a watchtower along the Great Wall, where he visits them regularly to bring them food and water. However, an unsuccessful escape attempt by the prisoners reveals Ma's secret {{to the rest of}} the village. A bitter argument ensues and the village decides to hire an assassin from town to carry out the deed. Ma enlists the help of an old man known as One Stroke Liu (Chen Qiang), a former Imperial executioner. He is told that being beheaded by Liu feels like a passing breeze, and that the severed head will roll nine times on the ground, blink three times, and <b>smile</b> <b>in</b> a gesture of gratitude for such a painless death. However, Liu fails to harm either prisoner with one stroke. Claiming that it is the will of Heaven, Liu leaves with the prisoners uninjured.|$|E
25|$|An {{unintended}} {{consequence of the}} attack on Melo was that Paraguay declared war on Brazil in late 1864. The Paraguayans invaded the provinces of Mato Grosso (present-day Mato Grosso do Sul) and Rio Grande do Sul. José Luís served in the Siege of Uruguaiana which resulted, in September 1865, in the surrender of an entire Paraguayan army which had taken the Brazilian town of Uruguaiana. On 22 March 1866, José Luís was given command of the 2nd cavalry division, a part of the 1st army corps. He fought in the Battle of Estero Bellaco on 2 May and in the First Battle of Tuyutí on 24 May. At Tuyutí José Luís was shot in the face with the bullet's trajectory entering one cheek and exiting through the other. He was left with hideous scars that made him look like he had a grim <b>smile</b> <b>in</b> his face. Tall and lean, José Luís seemed unpleasant at first glance, an impression that the disfigurement only worsened. He was actually a kind and warm person, according to historian Gustavo Barroso, who as commander knew how to impose a strict discipline without hurting the pride of his subordinates.|$|E

500|$|The {{incident}} between Ace Bailey and Eddie Shore {{occurred in}} the Boston Garden during the second period of a regular league game between the Toronto Maple Leafs and Boston Bruins on December 12, 1933. [...] Having taken two penalties in quick succession, the Maple Leafs were playing short handed, and sent Bailey, Red Horner and King Clancy out to defend against Boston's power play. During that sequence, Clancy upended Shore with a hard check as the later player rushed up the ice. [...] Angry, dazed, and thinking he was going after Clancy, Shore rushed at Bailey intent on revenge. He hit Bailey hard from the side, sending the stricken player flying through the air. [...] Bailey struck the ice head first and lapsed into convulsions. [...] Furious, Horner asked Shore what he was doing, and when met with only a <b>smile</b> <b>in</b> response, knocked Shore out cold with one punch.|$|E
500|$|The third single [...] "Fine Print" [...] was {{released}} in July 2009. Ali announced that the single preceded the release of her debut solo album Embers. The single peaked at No. 4 on Billboard's Hot Dance Club Play Chart. Embers {{was released}} in September 2009. Co-produced by Sultan & Shepard, Alex Sayz and Scott Fritz, Ali self-released the album on her own label, <b>Smile</b> <b>in</b> Bed Records. Embers generally received positive reviews, Chase Gran from About.com called it a [...] "well rounded, gourmet album with impressive songs". Gail Navarro from Racket magazine complimented Ali on her songwriting saying, [...] "It wasn’t just her sultry sound mixed in together with that enchanting singing voice; her songwriting got me hook, line and sinker". Speaking about the self-release of the album, she has cited her creative independence and the pressure of deadlines as the main reasons why she created her own record label.|$|E

500|$|In 2003, she co-starred with Julia Roberts in Mona Lisa <b>Smile</b> <b>in</b> {{the role}} of Giselle. In an {{interview}} with The Daily Telegraph, she revealed the reason for accepting the role was [...] "to play somebody who feels confident in herself as a sexy, beautiful woman". The film generated mostly critical reviews, with Manohla Dargis of the Los Angeles Times describing it as [...] "smug and reductive". Her next roles were in smaller independent films: Casa de los Babys (2003), a story about six American women impatiently waiting out their lengthy residency requirements in an unidentified South American country before picking up their adoptive babies, and Criminal (2004), a remake of the Argentinian film Nine Queens, with John C. Reilly and Diego Luna. Gyllenhaal plays an honest hotel manager forced to help her crooked brother (Reilly) by seducing one of his victims. Gyllenhaal was {{invited to join the}} Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in 2004. She starred in the HBO film Strip Search (2004), where she portrayed an American student in China suspected of terrorism.|$|E
500|$|She later {{described}} {{this period of}} her life to Essence saying [...] "People {{need to understand that}} the Lauryn Hill they were exposed to in the beginning was all that was allowed in that arena at that time… I had to step away when I realized that {{for the sake of the}} machine, I was being way too compromised. I felt uncomfortable about having to <b>smile</b> <b>in</b> someone's face when I really didn't like them or even know them well enough to like them." [...] She also spoke about her emotional crisis, saying, [...] "For two or three years I was away from all social interaction. It was a very introspective time because I had to confront my fears and master every demonic thought about inferiority, about insecurity or the fear of being black, young and gifted in this western culture." [...] She went on to say that she had to fight to retain her identity, and was forced [...] "to deal with folks who weren't happy about that." ...|$|E
500|$|In April 1970 Mercury joined guitarist Brian May {{and drummer}} Roger Taylor who had {{previously}} been in a band called <b>Smile.</b> <b>In</b> 1971 {{they were joined by}} bassist John Deacon. Despite reservations of the other members and Trident Studios, the band's initial management, Mercury chose the name [...] "Queen" [...] for the new band. He later said, [...] "It's very regal obviously, and it sounds splendid. It's a strong name, very universal and immediate. I was certainly aware of the gay connotations, but that was just one facet of it." [...] At about the same time, he changed his surname, Bulsara, to Mercury. Mercury designed Queen's logo, called the Queen crest, shortly before the release of the band's first album. The logo combines the zodiac signs of all four members: two lions for Leo (Deacon and Taylor), a crab for Cancer (May), and two fairies for Virgo (Mercury). The lions embrace a stylised letter Q, the crab rests atop the letter with flames rising directly above it, and the fairies are each sheltering below a lion. There is also a crown inside the Q and the whole logo is over-shadowed by an enormous phoenix. The whole symbol bears a passing resemblance to the Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom, particularly with the lion supporters.|$|E
