5|$|Germanicus' {{divisions}} met {{up to the}} north, and ravaged {{the countryside}} between the Ems and the Lippe, and penetrated to the Teutoburg Forest, a mountain forest in Western Germany situated between these two rivers. There, Germanicus {{and some of his}} men visited the site of the disastrous Battle of the Teutoburg Forest, and began burying the remains of the Roman soldiers that had been left in the open. After half a day of the work, he called off the burial of bones so that they could continue their war against the Germans. He made his way into the heartland of the Cherusci. At a location Tacitus calls the pontes longi ("long causeways"), in boggy lowlands <b>somewhere</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> Ems, Arminius' troops attacked the Romans. Arminius initially caught Germanicus' cavalry in a trap, inflicting minor casualties, but the Roman infantry reinforced the rout and checked them. The fighting lasted for two days, with neither side achieving a decisive victory. Germanicus' forces withdrew and returned to the Rhine.|$|E
5|$|There are {{no direct}} sources {{describing}} {{the conquest of}} the Chajoma by the Spanish but {{it appears to have}} been a drawn-out campaign rather than a rapid victory. The only description of the conquest of the Chajoma is a secondary account appearing in the work of Francisco Antonio de Fuentes y Guzmán in the 17th century, long after the event. After the conquest, the inhabitants of the eastern part of the kingdom were relocated by the conquerors to San Pedro Sacatepéquez, including some of the inhabitants of the archaeological site now known as Mixco Viejo (Jilotepeque Viejo). The rest of the population of Mixco Viejo, together with the inhabitants of the western part of the kingdom, were moved to San Martín Jilotepeque. The Chajoma rebelled against the Spanish in 1526, fighting a battle at Ukub'il, an unidentified site <b>somewhere</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> modern towns of San Juan Sacatepéquez and San Pedro Sacatepéquez.|$|E

5|$|Gil González Dávila set {{out from}} the Caribbean island of Hispaniola early in 1524, with the {{intention}} of exploring the Caribbean coast of Nicaragua. His course took him to the north coast of Honduras. After founding Puerto de Caballos, Gil Gónzalez sailed west along the coast to the Amatique Bay, and founded a Spanish settlement <b>somewhere</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> Dulce River, within modern-day Guatemala, which he named San Gil de Buena Vista. He launched a campaign of conquest in the mountainous region dividing Honduras from Guatemala. González left some of his men under the command of Francisco Riquelme at San Gil de Buena Vista, and sailed back east along the coast to Honduras. The colonists at San Gil did not prosper, and soon set out in search of a more hospitable location. They resettled in the important indigenous town of Nito, near the mouth of the Dulce River. Although they were in a desperate state, and near-starving, they were still there when Cortés passed through en route to Honduras, and were absorbed into his expedition.|$|E

25|$|According to tradition, the Cazonci, leading an army, marched towards Yuriria-Púndaro {{to fight}} certain tribes that were attacking the place and, after {{defeating}} them, the victorious army while returning home via the Cuitzeo Lake, stopped <b>somewhere</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> lake shores, {{to participate in}} festivities that celebrated the victory.

25|$|In October 871 Louis the German sent Bavarian and Franconian troops {{against the}} Bohemians (Czechs).

The Moravians were returning to their homeland with {{the daughter of a}} Bohemian dux ("duke"), presumably to marry an unidentified Moravian magnate. Although the Moravians managed to reach the safety of the fort, they had to abandon 644 fully equipped horses in the narrows. The marriage of a Bohemian leader's daughter to a Moravian magnate implies that Svatopluk was planning to form an alliance with the Bohemians.|$|E
25|$|Russia's February Revolution caught Pântea entrenched {{with his}} men <b>somewhere</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> town of Roman. The news, he later wrote, was {{a wake-up call}} for the Bessarabian Romanians in foreign lands, since it offered the {{prospect}} of self-determination at home. As the Provisional Government took hold of military matters, Pântea became President of the Ninth Army's Soviet, and also helped organize the Bessarabian soldiers into a single political body. Similar actions were being taken by other nationally minded Bessarabian officers. Some—Catelli, Anton Crihan, Constantin Osoianu, Ion Păscăluță, Andrei Scobioală—were active on Bessarabia's borders, while others addressed Bessarabian units in places such as Novorossiya (Elefterie Sinicliu) or Crimea (Grigore Turcuman).|$|E
25|$|Candidate {{destinations}} included Guiana, {{where the}} Dutch had already established Essequibo, or <b>somewhere</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> existing Virginia settlements. Virginia was an attractive destination because {{the presence of}} the older colony might offer better security and trade opportunities. It was thought, however, that they should not settle too near, since that might too closely duplicate the political environment back in England. The London Company administered a territory of considerable size in the region. The intended settlement location was {{at the mouth of the}} Hudson River. This made it possible to settle at a distance which allayed concerns of social, political, and religious conflicts, but still provided the military and economic benefits of relative closeness to an established colony.|$|E

50|$|While some {{microbes}} may be purely mutualistic or parasitic, many may behave {{one way or}} {{the other}} depending on the host species with which it is associated, environmental conditions, and host health. A host’s immune response controls symbiont infection and growth rates. If a host’s immune response is not able to control a particular microbial species, or if host immunity is compromised, the microbe-plant relationship will likely reside <b>somewhere</b> <b>nearer</b> <b>the</b> parasitic side of the mutualist-parasite continuum. Similarly, high nutrients can push some microbes into parasitic behavior, encouraging unchecked growth at a time when symbionts are no longer needed to aid with nutrient acquisition.|$|R
25|$|On {{the evening}} of 23 June 1949 a fire {{broke out in the}} tenth coach of an express {{passenger}} train from Edinburgh to King's Cross, {{about two and a half}} miles beyond Cockburnspath. The train stopped <b>somewhere</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> tunnel, within one and a quarter minutes of the fire starting, but the fire spread rapidly and with such ferocity that, within seconds, the brake-composite carriage was engulfed and the fire had spread to the coach in front. Most passengers escaped by running to the guard's compartment or forwards along the corridor, but some were compelled to break the windows and jump down onto the track. One lady was seriously injured by doing this.|$|E
25|$|The {{historical}} {{range of}} the subspecies extended from well into Quebec, the Maritimes, and Eastern Ontario south to include all of New England finally ending in the very northeastern tip of Pennsylvania in the west, cutting off <b>somewhere</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> mouth of the Hudson River in the east. The moose has been extinct {{in much of the}} eastern U.S. for as long as 150 years, due to colonial era overhunting and destruction of its habitat: Dutch, French, and British colonial sources all attest to its presence in the mid 17th century from Maine south to areas within a hundred miles of present-day Manhattan. However, by the 1870s, only a handful of moose existed in this entire region in very remote pockets of forest; less than 20% of suitable habitat remained.|$|E
25|$|Philippine Rise is a {{submerged}} extinct volcanic ridge {{located at}} 16 degrees 30 minutes N, 124 degrees 45 minutes E {{off the coast}} of Luzon, with the size of about 250km in diameter and rises over 2,000 meters (2km.) above the sea floor, from below 5,000 meters (5km.) below sea level to above 3,000 meters (3km.) below sea level. Its area is close to the Benham Seamount, located at 15 degrees 48 minutes N, 124 degrees 15 minutes E. The precise location is <b>somewhere</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> east of the Philippine Trench and near the south of the East Luzon Trench, both of which absorb the subducting force of the Philippine Sea Plate under the Philippine Mobile Belt, a collage of large blocks of that crust that amalgamated prior to the collision of the Philippine Sea Plate with the Eurasian Plate.|$|E

25|$|The Franks {{gained control}} of Pannonia and Dalmatia in the 790s and {{the first decade of}} the ninth century. In 788 Charlemagne, after conquering Lombardy, turned further east and subjugated Istria. In the 790s Duke Vojnomir of Pannonia {{accepted}} the Frankish overlordship, whose land the Franks placed under the March of Friuli and tried to extend their rule over the Croatians of Dalmatia. In 799 the Franks under the leadership of Eric of Friuli were defeated in the Battle of Trsat in Liburnia. However, from 803 Frankish rule was recognized in most of northern Dalmatia. The Franks also waged wars with the Byzantine Empire until a peace treaty, known as the Pax Nicephori, was signed in 812. By that treaty the Byzantines retained control of the coastal cities and islands in Dalmatia, while acknowledging Frankish rule over Istria and the Dalmatian hinterland. From c. 810 Borna, who resided in Nin, ruled most of northern Dalmatia and was a vassal of the Carolingian Empire. Borna was Duke of the Guduscani, a Croatian tribe that lived along the river Guduča near Bribir in northern Dalmatia, later the center of the Croatian state. His rule was marked by the rebellion of Ljudevit Posavski against the Franks, who defeated Borna in 819 <b>somewhere</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> River Kupa and began to ravage Dalmatia, but harsh conditions and constant attacks from Borna's men forced Ljudevit to retreat. In 821 Borna died and was succeeded by his nephew Vladislav.|$|E

500|$|Another {{possible}} {{location is}} <b>somewhere</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> village of Newchurch in Pendle. Douglas claims there is [...] "persuasive" [...] evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) {{was the site}} of Malkin Tower; there were numerous reports of alleged witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial such as Greenhead, Barley and Roughlee. Others involved in the trials were known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, and John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at the neighbouring Bull Hole Farm. Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. But neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.|$|E
