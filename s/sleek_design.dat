25|$|In August of 2000, the R34 {{received}} a facelift which changed the front bumper to a new, <b>sleek</b> <b>design</b> and Xenon headlights were optional {{across the entire}} range. For the interior, pedals were changed from rubber to aluminium and {{the steering wheel and}} gear shift knob were now made of genuine leather. The center console and dials now had an iridium-silver appearance.|$|E
25|$|The {{single storey}} {{building}} acts {{the main entrance}} to the fort, and offers information to visitors and tourists. Originally, the Visitor Centre operated as the museum before exhibits and archives were relocated to the Hough House. Rectangular in shape, the structure was designed to follow {{the theme of the}} Colonial Revival style of the other buildings located within the fort, and exhibits a <b>sleek</b> <b>design</b> of limestone exterior, incorporated with stone chimneys, multi-pane windows, and primmed rear and frontal gardens.|$|E
25|$|In July 1948, Major Townsend {{started as}} the lead {{military}} pilot for the Air Force evaluation of the Boeing B-47 jet bomber. A result of B-47's <b>sleek</b> <b>design,</b> the aircraft required a high landing speed and an excessively long distance to stop. Townsend suggested {{the addition of a}} parachute, deployed shortly before touch-down, to shorten the landing distance. Equally dangerous, landing at a reduced engine power setting left the pilot unable to quickly command additional thrust due to the slow acceleration characteristics of early jet engines. A fellow B-47 test pilot, Major Russell E. Schleeh, proposed a second parachute, deployed while in the landing pattern, to permit a higher engine power setting during the approach.|$|E
50|$|August 30, 1944 <b>sleeker</b> <b>design.</b> Also a v-tailed single-seat jet fighter {{with a more}} pointed {{nose and}} wings swept back at 40 degrees. It had a {{wingspan}} of 8.16 m and a length of 9.37 m.|$|R
50|$|Hal Rubenstein of InStyle noted upswept hairstyles and <b>sleek</b> <b>designs</b> {{in bright}} colours, {{appropriate}} for the hot day, and a relative lack of over-indulgence and excess extravagance, while Lawrence Zarian of TV Guide Network commented on the popularity of outsize jewelry and sparkling embellishment.|$|R
5000|$|On October 29, 2012, the new Santana was {{introduced}} in Wolfsburg, Germany. It was built to fulfil the Chinese market demand. The new Santana {{is based on the}} [...] "New AO5+" [...] (PQ25) platform and has been redesigned for more power and a <b>sleeker</b> <b>design.</b>|$|R
25|$|The maximum rpm of a {{propeller}} (at about 2800 {{depending on}} its diameter) {{is about half}} that at the maximum torque/power rpm of about 5500rpm for a car engine and these engines therefore need to be fitted with a drive reduction unit. Such units absorb about 20% of the engine power and therefore the normally aspirated Isuzu unit delivers the same maximum power as the Jabiru 5100. Recent developments of the Jabiru engine range by Rotec have produced replacement water-cooled cylinder heads for the 5100. This has removed the overheating problems and also allowed the nose cowling of the Mk26 to be reshaped to remove the air intake and considerably reduce the frontal area to be {{in keeping with the}} original <b>sleek</b> <b>design</b> of the Spitfire. First flights of a Mk26 with the redeveloped water-cooled Jabiru 5100 are expected in 2016.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the decade, digital watches with metal bands were the dominant fashion. They remained popular but lost some of their status in later years. Newer digital watches with built-in calculators and primitive data organizers were strictly for gadget geeks. Adult professionals returned to dial watches by mid-decade. Leather straps returned as an option. By the late 1980s, some watch faces had returned to Roman numerals. In contrast, one ultramodern status symbol was the Movado museum watch. It featured a <b>sleek</b> <b>design</b> with a single large dot at twelve o'clock. The Tank watch by Cartier was a fashion icon that was revived and frequently seen on Cartier advertisements in print. Rolex watches were prominently seen on the television show Miami Vice. Teen culture preferred vibrant plastic Swatch watches. These first appeared in Europe, and reached North America by the mid-1980s. Young people would often wear two or three of these watches on the same arm.|$|E
500|$|Hudson {{produced}} automobiles for 49 years, until 1957. [...] Hudson {{cars were}} {{very popular in}} NASCAR in the early 1950s, in particular the Hudson Hornet, now known as well for its prominence in the 2006 Pixar animated movie, Cars. [...] Its early popularity was due to its <b>sleek</b> <b>design,</b> low center of gravity and excellent handling, but it failed {{to keep up with}} rest of the industry by mid-decade. [...] The 1955 Hudson was actually a rebadged Nash auto with different trim. [...] It were offered with a V8 in 1955, but it was too little to save the brand, which was discontinued two years later.|$|E
2500|$|... 'Wind Tunnel Waldo' had slicked back {{hair that}} {{appeared}} to be constantly wind blown. He represented Oldsmobile's wind tunnel testing, that produced some of the <b>sleekest</b> <b>designs</b> of the day. Another character included 'Hy Spy' who had his ear to the ground as he checked out the competition.|$|R
25|$|Although {{there had}} been some {{experiments}} with stretch fabrics in Europe before the war, Pucci's <b>sleek</b> <b>designs</b> caused a sensation, and he received several offers from American manufacturers to produce them. Instead, he left the Air Force and set up an haute couture house in the fashionable resort of Canzone del Mare on the Isle of Capri.|$|R
50|$|Chevrolet's {{first major}} {{redesign}} post-World War II, the Advance-Design series {{was billed as}} a bigger, stronger, and <b>sleeker</b> <b>design</b> {{in comparison to the}} earlier AK Series. First available on Saturday June 28, 1947, these trucks were sold with various minor changes over the years until March 25, 1955, when the Task Force Series trucks replaced the aging Advance-Design model.|$|R
500|$|Speed2 was {{produced}} by De Bont's production company, Blue Tulip, {{and he was one}} the film's three co-producers along with Steve Perry and Michaer Peyser. While Speed {{was produced}} for $30 million, the sequel was green-lit at [...] "just under $100 million" [...] due to the larger production and higher cast salaries. The director began working on pre-production prior to the release of his previous film, Twister (1996). He started location scouting in the Caribbean in May 1996, and chose Saint Martin as the primary filming location because he felt it was least likely to be subjected to a hurricane. For the cruise ship on which the film would be set, De Bont visited ships from various cruise lines and ultimately chose Seabourn Legend for its luxurious amenities and <b>sleek</b> <b>design.</b>|$|E
500|$|Although mostly {{occupied}} with Thunderbird 6 and Doppelgänger, Derek Meddings briefly reprised {{his role as}} head of special effects to construct Professor McClaine's Jet Air Car. The design concept was a disappointment to Anderson, who commented: [...] "The car looked like no other piece of hardware we had had previously but I was wary of canning it as I feared I might be becoming stereotyped. Maybe {{the whole thing was}} becoming a bit narrow; all the ideas were becoming similar." [...] Stephen La Rivière, writer of Filmed in Supermarionation: A History of the Future, views the Jet Air Car as an update of Supercar, the vehicle that appeared in Anderson's 1961 series of the same name, but agrees that while the Jet Air Car is the [...] "star vehicle" [...] of Joe 90, it is visually unappealing in comparison to the [...] "beautiful, <b>sleek</b> <b>design</b> of its predecessor." ...|$|E
500|$|Lorraine Calvert {{joined the}} series as costume {{designer}} for the season. On adapting Elektra's costume for the season, {{which in the}} comics usually consists of impractically [...] "strappy" [...] red cloth, Calvert decided to make it utilitarian and appealing, while still being faithful to the comics. Originally starting out opposite of the eventual <b>sleek</b> <b>design</b> for both her fighting and daytime attire, Calvert said, [...] "Ideas were tossed around about how she was possibly bohemian, [...] she was a free spirit who traveled {{all over the world}} with as much money as she possibly could." [...] This eventually led to the final, sleeker design, because Elektra [...] "really needs a very simple, elegant line because too much cloth is overwhelming." [...] The costume consisted of [...] "black moto pants, a one-piece zippered body suit, a sleeveless vest, and red cloth to provide the highlights and the hood covering Elektra’s face." [...] The shade of the red used for Elektra throughout the season was chosen so it would not clash with the red in Daredevil's costume, as well as to match the darker tone of the series.|$|E
5000|$|Electones {{became more}} digital here. It used more {{integrated}} circuit technology to make components smaller, and hence {{allowed for a}} <b>sleeker</b> <b>design.</b> The HX/HS series {{was the first to}} use AWM (Advance Wave Memory) [...] "sampling" [...] technology for both voices and rhythms, and also featured 16-operator FM voices. AWM Voice expansion is also possible via sound packs.|$|R
5000|$|Beginning {{in summer}} 2010, a {{secondary}} type of Mountain Dew bottles began appearing on some U.S. shelves. Designed by 4sight, a design and innovation firm, these bottles featured a <b>sleeker</b> <b>design,</b> smaller packaging labels, and a built-in grip. The bottles were dubbed [...] "Sidekick bottles" [...] and {{were tested in}} North Carolina, South Carolina, and Indiana markets.|$|R
50|$|In 1947, {{the ship}} was {{returned}} to Italy and underwent refit and modernization at a shipyard in Monfalcone in 1948. Structural changes saw her bow replaced with a <b>sleeker</b> <b>design,</b> {{as well as an}} increase in length overall. Interior changes included more passenger accommodations, increasing her capacity to 252 first-class passengers, 455 in cabin class, and 893 in economy class.|$|R
2500|$|Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic {{praised the}} songwriting and the [...] "clean and uncluttered" [...] {{production}} on the project. He eventually commended on Aguilera's vocals, writing that [...] "she {{not only has}} charisma, she can actually sing, bringing conviction to these love and heartbreak songs." [...] Although calling it [...] "a frustratingly erratic album", Beth Johnson wrote that [...] "Christina still makes a credible bid to be the late-summer soundtrack to romantic rebound." [...] Sputnikmusic editor Amanda Murray wrote that Christina Aguilera [...] "is an album that is highly representative of the better aspects of the teen pop movement of the late 90s." [...] A reviewer writing for Q said the album [...] "shows off her pretty, but powerful vocals to surprisingly impressive effect." [...] Ann Powers on behalf of The New York Times agreed, writing [...] "Beyond its <b>sleek</b> <b>design,</b> this album hints at a real singer's emergence. She has striking vocal power and range, if not a clue about expressing individuality." ...|$|E
2500|$|Provisioned and {{manned by}} July, the vessel was {{returned}} to the English Channel to assist in safe convoy for a fleet of West Indiamen, and then in company with Tartar to hunt privateers. She had her first and only victory within weeks of leaving port, capturing the French vessel La Marquise de Chateaunois on 17 July. [...] Despite this victory Tartars Prize was experiencing considerable difficulty with her long, <b>sleek</b> <b>design,</b> which increased her speed but made her unwieldy and liable to roll in heavy weather. In August Baillie was forced to make port in Spanish Corunna {{so that he could}} restow the cargo and take on ballast to stabilise the ship. He returned Tartars Prize to sea in September, where she promptly sprang a leak and started taking on 18 inches of water each hour. Forced back into port for repairs, Baillie wrote to Admiralty requesting stronger decking and timbers so that the hull would not keep opening up at the seams.|$|E

50|$|On January 23, 2007, Champ Car {{unveiled}} its new logo for the Champ Car World Series and the Atlantic Series. According to its website, it is a <b>sleeker</b> <b>design</b> {{with the}} new Panoz DP01 chassis on the right {{with an emphasis on}} a chicane-style layout, representing the street track racing that dominates Champ Car. There were no oval tracks on the calendar, with Milwaukee removed after the 2006 race.|$|R
50|$|The fourth period {{began in}} the early 1930s, and is {{characterized}} by the Streamline Moderne influence on the styling of the cases. Many of these watches featured a new 207 movement, 12/0-size with 17 jewels (of which only 40,000 were made) and included such <b>sleek</b> <b>designs</b> as the Futura, Chesterfield, Wentworth, Andover, and the 14kt Rockliffe. Many of these are very similar to watches made at the time by the Hamilton Watch Company.|$|R

50|$|The company grew {{through the}} 1970s and 1980s. Mr. Kunczynski {{was known for}} dining with {{prospective}} clients (après-ski) instead of just simple negotiating, and would sketch plans out on paper napkins. Another attractive feature to buyers was the price. Mr. Kunczynski sold his lifts at prices well below those of larger manufacturers. Mr. Kunczynski is also credited with being the first manufacturer of ski lifts to incorporate aesthetics into the design of his equipment, creating <b>sleek</b> <b>designs</b> that were popular with ski resorts.|$|R
5000|$|The Batwing {{also appears}} in Batman: The Animated Series, {{shaped like a}} stylized bat with very long wings that jut out past the [...] "head" [...] of the plane. The Batplane in The New Batman Adventures takes on a smaller, <b>sleeker</b> <b>design</b> shaped like a rocket with a curved wing on each side which also {{appeared}} in Justice League and Justice League Unlimited. In Batman Beyond, flying cars are commonplace and thus the Batmobile used by Terry McGinnis doubles as a plane.|$|R
50|$|During the 1930s and 1940s Heywood-Wakefield began {{producing}} furniture using <b>sleek</b> <b>designs</b> {{based on}} French Art Deco. Long-haul bus companies began focusing on passenger {{comfort in the}} 1920s. Their bucket seats proved successful and rail companies began to follow suit. The Association of American Railroads' Mechanical Division and Heywood-Wakefield {{became involved in the}} quest for more luxurious seat design. Through a grant from Heywood-Wakefield, the Association employed a Harvard professor of anthropology, E. A. Hooton, to research rail passenger seat preferences in 1945. Heywood-Wakefield's resulting Sleepy Hollow seat came into wide use.|$|R

50|$|Currently, {{there are}} 2 {{series of the}} full height {{platform}} screen doors in use. The first series, installed at several underground stations along the North South Line and the East West Line (except Changi Airport Station, Bishan station and Marina South Pier Station), have been in use since 1987. These cost about an additional S$1 million per platform. The latest series of platform screen doors, featuring a <b>sleeker</b> <b>design</b> and incorporating more glass surfaces, are installed at all underground stations along the two driverless MRT lines, North East Line and Circle Line.|$|R
50|$|During {{the inaugural}} flight of Sikorsky's {{previous}} flying boat, the S-40, on November 19, 1931, {{the pilot and}} Pan American Airways consultant, Charles Lindbergh, who considered the S-40 a monstrosity, engaged designer Igor Sikorsky in a conversation about what he thought the next airplane should look like. The conversation continued {{that night at the}} hotel in Jamaica. Sikorsky argued that design development should be incremental and that the safe approach would be a larger S-40. Lindbergh argued that a <b>sleeker</b> <b>design,</b> with a range in still air of 2,500 miles, was needed.|$|R
50|$|The Moog Source, {{which began}} {{production}} in 1981, featured internal workings {{very similar to}} the Prodigy in a much <b>sleeker</b> physical <b>design</b> that featured programmability, arpeggiator / sequencer and white noise.|$|R
