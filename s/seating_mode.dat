40|$|Abstract. A new {{integrated}} {{child safety}} seat {{is presented in}} this paper. The seat is a two-mode seat for a motor vehicle cooperable with an adult seat belt assembly to provide two modes operation including an adult <b>seat</b> <b>mode</b> and a child <b>seat</b> <b>mode.</b> The <b>seat</b> locates {{in the center of}} the rear seat. The structure of the seat was designed in detail. The height of the booster of the seat can be adjusted continuously according to the seated shoulder height of the child passenger. The depth of booster cushion also can be changed according to the size of the passenger. The sled test with the seat was conducted. The seat simulation models with different booster heights were developed using MADYMO software and validated. Then, these models were used to study the performance of the seat in frontal impact. Some key parameters of the seat were studied in simulation test. The results of the test and simulation show that the seat can provide effective protection for the children aged from 3 to 10 years in frontal impact...|$|R

40|$|The ISO 2631 - 1 (1997) {{provides}} methodologies {{for assessment}} of the seated human body comfort in response to vibrations. The standard covers various conditions such as frequency content, direction and location of the transmission of the vibration to the human body. However, the effects of <b>seat</b> structural dynamics <b>mode</b> shapes and corresponding resonances have not been discussed. This study provides important knowledge {{about the effects of}} vehicle <b>seat</b> structural vibration <b>modes</b> on discomfort assessment. The occupied seat resonant frequencies and corresponding vibration modes were measured and comfort test was carried out based on the paired comparison test method. The results show that the ISO 2631 - 1 (1997) method significantly underestimates the vibration discomfort level around the occupied seat twisting resonant frequencies. This underestimation is mainly due to the ISO suggested location of the accelerometer pad on the seatback. The centre of the seatback is a nodal point at the <b>seat</b> twisting <b>mode.</b> Therefore, it underestimates the total vibration transferred to the occupant body from the seatback...|$|R

40|$|Predicting the {{responses}} of the combined human body-seat structure to vibration excitation is still a challenging task. This is mainly due to the complex dynamics behaviour of the seated human body in response to the vibration. Nevertheless, several applications, such as optimizing the vehicle seat structure or reducing the transmission of the vibration to the seat occupant, do not necessarily require complex modelling of the human body. It is however essential to characterize and predict the critical frequencies and the corresponding vibration patterns of the combined seat with human occupant. This study aims to predict the resonant frequencies and corresponding vibration mode shapes of the vehicle seat with occupant from the unoccupied seat. An experiment is designed to measure the frequency responses, resonant frequencies, and corresponding mode shapes of a selected vehicle seat when mounted on the test rig. Seventeen young male volunteers have participated in the experiments. The results indicate that that the vehicle unoccupied seat have three similar main seatback lateral, seatback fore-aft, and seat twisting resonant frequencies below 80 Hz. Adding the human occupant to the seat gave the same three seatback lateral, seatback fore-aft, and <b>seat</b> twisting <b>mode</b> shapes but with different resonant frequencies from their corresponding unoccupied seat. The changes of the resonant frequencies from unoccupied seat to the occupied seat for the all seventeen volunteers were consistent in accordance to their weights. Seated human occupant is not adding any new resonant frequency or mode shapes to the seat. Similar changes of the resonant frequencies between the six volunteers for the three different seats allow us to predict the key attributes of the seat with occupant (occupied <b>seat)</b> <b>modes</b> from their corresponding unoccupied seat. Results from this study are expected to reduce the need for complex modeling of the human body in upfront analysis in design of vehicle seats...|$|R

40|$|Self-directed {{mobility}} is {{a fundamental}} human right. Typically developing children engage in mobility {{for a majority of}} their day, but children with disabilities {{do not have the same}} opportunities. Children with disabilities are at a disadvantage and have a greater risk for developmental delays in physical and cognitive skills, along with decreases in social interactions with peers and adults (Feldner, Logan, & Galloway, 2015). Powered mobility devices, such as motorized wheelchairs, can promote self-directed mobility experiences for children with disabilities. Lynch, Agrawal, and Galloway (2009) validated that powered mobility devices can help children with disabilities as young as six months improve communication, cognitive abilities, as well as motor skills. Unfortunately, there are no commercially available powered mobility devices for children under the age of three (Logan et al., 2014). Yet, research over the past thirty years has shown direct benefits of use of powered mobility devices (Butler, 1983; Feldner et al,, 2015). Ride-on toy cars (ROC) were mentioned as a potential powered mobility device as early as 1988. However, only recently have modified ROCs emerged as an alternative to standard powered mobility devices. Previous research has demonstrated the benefits of use of modified ROCs for children with disabilities to increase independent exploration as well as physical and cognitive development (Logan et al., 2014). An innovative sit-to-stand version was developed and requires a child to stand up in order to activate the switch to encourage the physical skills of pulling from sit-to-stand, weight bearing, and balance (Feldner et al., 2015). The purpose of this case study is to examine modified ROC use by an infant with Down syndrome (DS) to encourage sitting and standing. One infant with DS participated in this study. During baseline, Child A was provide bi-weekly driving sessions that lasted 10 minutes and were video recorded. During the intervention, Child A was provided 20 minutes of driving at least five days per week and a researcher recorded bi-weekly 10 minute driving sessions. Child A initially drove the car in the <b>seated</b> <b>mode,</b> but transitioned over time to the standing mode. From baseline to intervention, the frequency of positive and negative facial expressions increased and decreased respectively. Modified ROCs are an affordable and fun option for children with DS. They provide opportunities in social and physical growth and may help close the developmental gap between children with DS and typically developing children...|$|R

40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{stability}} of g-modes in variable white dwarfs with hydrogen envelopes. In these stars, the radiative layer contributes to mode damping because its opacity decreases upon compression and the amplitude of the Lagrangian pressure perturbation increases outward. The overlying convective envelope is the <b>seat</b> of <b>mode</b> excitation because it acts as an insulating blanket {{with respect to the}} perturbed flux that enters it from below. A crucial point is that the convective motions respond to the instantaneous pulsational state. Driving exceeds damping by as much as a factor of two provided evaluated {{at the base of the}} convective envelope. As a white dwarf cools, its convection zone deepens, and modes of lower frequency become overstable. However, the deeper convection zone impedes the passage of flux perturbations from the base of the convection zone to the photosphere. Thus the photometric variation of a mode with constant velocity amplitude decreases. These factors account for the observed trend that longer period modes are found in cooler DAVs. The linear growth time, ranging from hours for the longest period observed modes (P≈ 20 minutes) to thousands of years for those of shortest period (P≈ 2 minutes), probably sets the time-scale for variations of mode amplitude and phase. This is consistent with observations showing that longer period modes are more variable than shorter period ones. Our investigation confirms many results obtained by Brickhill in his pioneering studies of ZZ Cetis...|$|R

40|$|Tribus b. v. is {{a company}} in Utrecht that {{converts}} minibuses for multifunctional public transportation. This means that with the same bus both ambulant people and wheelchair occupants can be transported. The multifunctionality lies in {{the combination of a}} flexible floor layout and (tip) seats. The floor system is based on separate aluminium profiles that are assembled to form any desired floor layout. Tribus' tip seat FlexusPRO meets the highest quality and safety requirements. Because of its integrated three point safety belt, the seat can be positioned anywhere in the vehicle. A common seat layout is the 4 x 4 tip seats, where four FlexusPRO seats are positioned {{on the right side of}} the vehicle and four on the left. By folding the seat pan to the backrest and subsequently rotating the seat package to the side, a wheelchair environment is created without removing or repositioning the seat. This transformation from passenger <b>seat</b> (<b>mode</b> 1) to wheelchair space (mode 2) is an easy and fast operation that enables the transporter to do a combined transportation of ambulant people and wheelchair occupants with the same vehicle. Besides the benefits of Tribus' FlexusPRO, the tip seat also has some main drawbacks with respect to the production costs, weight, the available wheelchair space after seat transformation and the hindered view outside for the wheelchair occupant as a result of the <b>seat</b> dimensions in <b>mode</b> 2. The goal is to overcome these drawbacks, in order for Tribus to be able to launch a new tip seat that exceeds seats of competitors on price, weight, operation and functionality. The goal of this graduation project focuses on the improvements of the <b>seat</b> position in <b>mode</b> 2. This means an improvement of the transformation device, where the overall goal is to reduce the production costs and weight by at least 30 % and increase the view outside for the wheelchair occupant by at least 20 % in combination with an increased lateral wheelchair space of at least 10 %. However, in order to obtain a good design, a complete concept of the new tip seat needs to be proposed, where every aspect of the seat is able to fulfil the design requirements. A morphological approach resulted in three tip seat concepts that are rated with respect to usage and manufacturing aspects. The final concept led to a tip seat with a rotation device and a tilting backrest, that increases the lateral wheelchair space in mode 2. The improvement of the lateral wheelchair space is however dependent on the entire seat design, where the base frame of the seat will be leading. Because the base frame of the seat is not part of this project, a specific percentage of the improvement is not yet known, but an improvement of at least 10 % can be realized. The separate headrest of the seat is moved down during the transformation to mode 2, which improves the view outside for the wheelchair passenger. The entire seat design is also not part of this project, but research on commercial vehicles showed that a vertical adjustment of the headrest of 210 mm is possible, which would improve the view outside by approximately 33 %. The new seat concept is used as a guideline for the design of the two mechanisms that are needed for the transformation from mode 1 to mode 2. The tilting motion of the backrest resulted in a mechanism that provides a simultaneous movement of both backrest and seat pan. The benefit is that the additional (tilting) functionality of the seat had no effect on the amount of operations needed for the transformation. The mechanism is based on the over-centre principle of a toggle clamp. The system uses four pivot points that connects the backrest to both seat pan and seat frame. This innovative solution resulted in the fact that no additional locking devices where necessary to prevent the angular movement of the backrest in mode 1. The loads on the three point belt in the backrest, as a result of a frontal impact, are transferred into the mechanism which is only locked by the geometry of the backrest and seat pan. This mechanism prevents additional costs and weight as a result of the additional tilting functionality. Finally a new rotation device is designed. The use of a morphological approach resulted in four concepts. The best concept is elaborated, resulting in a new steel swivel of 3 kg, which is a weight reduction of 38 %. Because of the minimal amount of components, no welding operations and an easy and fast assembly, the cost price of the swivel is reduced by 47 %. Both tilting mechanism and swivel have been prototyped and they underlined the benefits that are mentioned in this report. The swivel has even been tested by a physical pull test and passed this test successfully. The goal of reducing the production costs and weight by at least 30 % has been exceeded on both aspects. The view outside for the wheelchair occupant could be improved by 33 %, which also exceeds the required 20 %. The required improvement of the lateral wheelchair space by 10 % can still be realized and will exceed this 10 % especially around the arms of the wheelchair occupant. The project has been a success and Tribus decided to continue the development of both mechanisms for series production.

Two singing modes were studied: (1) "soloistic" singing, in which choristers attempted to maintain normal solo vocal production; and (2) "blended" singing, in which choristers tried to maximize homogeneity of ensemble sound. Seating arrangements examined were: (1) random sectional seating, and (2) sectional seating according to "acoustic matching" of voices Crossing the 2 factors produced 4 experimental conditions. An ad hoc choir, composed of 22 university voice majors, was recorded singing 4 choral pieces under each experimental condition. Thirty-seven choral conductors, 33 voice teachers and 32 nonvocal musicians rated the performances according to 7 standard evaluative criteria, and wrote comments. Eight of the choristers were recorded individually during the performances. These choristers was also recorded singing their parts as solo songs. Twelve voice teachers evaluated the vocal production of these a choristers. They ranked the 5 performances of each piece (4 choral and solo) by each chorister, and wrote comments. All choristers rated the 4 choral experimental conditions for each piece on a 5 -point scale, according to vocal comfort and choral sound, and wrote comments. Analysis of choral performance ratings revealed a significant seating arrangement effect in favor of acoustic seating over random <b>seating.</b> Singing <b>mode</b> {{had a significant effect}} in favor of blended singing over soloistic singing on choral conductors' ratings for all seven criteria.

40|$|The {{development}} {{and application of}} the vehicle advanced CAE (computer aided engineering) allowed the vehicle designers to considerably reduce the weight and improve the structural performance of the body. However, the current advanced CAE model can only {{be available in the}} late design phase of the vehicle when only minor changes of the structure is feasible. Despite the detailed CAE model, which requires all detailed design, the concept CAE model can be created with less need for the detailed CAD data and it can be created in the early (concept) design phase. The members and panels of the automotive body in white (BIW) are modeled and approximated using beam and shell elements. The joints properties are then obtained from the original detailed CAE model using Guyan reduction method. The automotive seat concept model is also created and added to the concept BIW model. The developed models show good correlation with corresponding advanced CAE models as well as corresponding modal tests results in low frequency range. The interaction of the <b>seat</b> and BIW <b>modes,</b> which can be the cause of a poor seat vibration, is considered as a problem for structural optimization. Optimization of the BIW and the seat structure to prevent this mode interaction is only feasible in the early design phase.

40|$|The NVH {{optimization}} of the BIW {{and seat}} {{structure in the}} advanced phase of the design demands too much time and cost. On the other hand, developing a reliable NVH concept model in the earliest stage of the design to improve dynamic behaviour of the structure and avoid conflicting designs might be an effective approach. To this end, a practical method for CAE-NVH concept modelling is developed. The developed model utilizes beam elements with standard and arbitrary cross sections for the main load carrying components (namely beam-like structures) of the BIW and seat structure. Also, major joints are approximated from the detailed CAE model by taking static model reduction method into account. Due to the indisputable effects of some panels (e. g., roof) on the BIW structural dynamics characteristics, shell element with rough meshing are exploited to model these components. The developed concept models are verified by comparing their resonant frequencies and mode shapes with counterpart advanced CAE models in low frequency range. Having been validated by dynamic domain indicators, the developed concept model is used to improve the NVH performance of the automotive. In one case, modes interaction between BIW and seat structure is characterized. Then, by examining {{the influence of the}} beams properties (both BIW and <b>seat)</b> in conflicting <b>modes,</b> the problem is managed. Having been separated the identified interacting modes, the amplitude of the vibration on the seat-back is suppressed about 10 db around corresponding frequency. As a result, by taking advantages of the proposed method in similar cases, the CAE-NVH concept model can be successfully used to lead the right first time design...|$|R
