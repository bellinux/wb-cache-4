25|$|For {{those lines}} {{constructed}} {{to a lower}} <b>standard,</b> <b>speed</b> can be increased via numerous methods including realigning rail lines to increase the minimum curve radius, {{reducing the number of}} intersections, or introducing tilting trains to improve the speed of trains running on those lines.|$|E

Multilingual 'no stopping' signs exist in several locations on the M25.|$|E

5000|$|Small Computer System Interface (SCSI), {{rarely used}} {{since the early}} 21st century, {{supported}} only by computers with a SCSI interface, either on a card or built-in.

25|$|UHS-I and UHS-II cards can use UHS Speed Class rating {{with two}} {{possible}} grades: class 1 for minimum read/write performance {{of at least}} 10MB/s ('U1' symbol featuring number 1 inside 'U') and class 3 for minimum write performance of 30MB/s ('U3' symbol featuring 3 inside 'U'), targeted at recording 4K video. Before November 2013, the rating was branded UHS Speed Grade and contained grades 0 (no symbol) and 1 ('U1' symbol). Manufacturers can also display <b>standard</b> <b>speed</b> class symbols (C2, C4, C6, and C10) alongside, or in place of UHS speed class.|$|E
25|$|To be {{eligible}} {{to appear on the}} Power Lap Times board, a vehicle must be a road-legal production car and must have sufficient ride height to clear a <b>standard</b> <b>speed</b> bump (referred to by the presenters as a sleeping policeman), although occasionally vehicles that cannot appear on the list are still timed. Whenever a non-qualifying vehicle is raced, the time is compared to the official Power Laps but then removed from the board, for example - the Ferrari FXX owned by Michael Schumacher (1:10.7) was taken off the board after because it both failed to meet road legal standards and used slick tyres.|$|E
25|$|Dual carriageways of {{this class}} differ from {{motorways}} {{in a number}} of ways. The hard shoulder is demarcated with a dashed yellow line (as opposed to an unbroken yellow line on motorways). The <b>standard</b> <b>speed</b> limit of 100km/h (62mph) for national routes usually applies (by default the limit is 80km/h (50mph) for non-national roads, even if dual carriageway). Local authorities have the power to apply a limit of up to 120km/h (75mph) as used on most motorways (The High Quality Dual Carriageway section of the N1 between the end of the M1 and the border with Northern Ireland and the N25/N22 Ballincollig Bypass in Cork are the only route sections with such special limits).|$|E

Ungerboeck's theories demonstrated that there was considerable untapped potential in the system, and by applying the concept to new modem <b>standards,</b> <b>speed</b> rapidly increased to 14.4, 28.8 and ultimately 33.6 kbit/s.|$|R

5000|$|Nevada's energy wasting fine {{was enacted}} on April 15, 1981, when signed by Governor Robert List.

2500|$|Though {{not common}} in the United States, a speed limit may be defined in {{kilometers}} per hour (km/h) as well as miles per hour (mph). The Federal Highway Administration's Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices, which provides guidelines for speed limit signage, states that [...] "speed limits shown shall be in multiples of 10km/h or 5mph." [...] If a speed limit sign indicates km/h, the number is circumscribed and [...] "km/h" [...] is written below. Prior to 2003, metric speed limits were designated using the <b>standard</b> <b>speed</b> limit sign, usually with yellow supplemental [...] "METRIC" [...] and [...] "km/h" [...] plaques above it and below it, respectively.|$|E
2500|$|All Oldsmobiles {{featured}} the [...] "speed bar" [...] speedometer. [...] Introduced in 1959, the speedometer used a rolling black cylinder with sections painted brilliant green, yellow and bright red. [...] As the car {{went from a}} standing stop forward in speed, the cylinder rolled, first exposing the green in a window that matched the numeric speed on stationary speed dial for low speeds, yellow at moderate speeds, and finally red at highway speeds. [...] Drivers who topped the car over 100mph moved the cylinder into an area where only the black base color was visible. [...] For 1963, Oldsmobile would revert to a <b>standard</b> <b>speed</b> needle sweeping over a calibrated set of speeds instead.|$|E
2500|$|The {{effect from}} {{impurities}} can be significant when making high-precision measurements. Chemical desiccants {{can be used}} to dry the air, but will in turn contaminate the sample. The air can be dried cryogenically, but this has the effect of removing the carbon dioxide as well; therefore many high-precision measurements are performed with air free of carbon dioxide rather than with natural air. A 2002 review found that a 1963 measurement by Smith and Harlow using a cylindrical resonator gave [...] "the most probable value of the <b>standard</b> <b>speed</b> of sound to date." [...] The experiment was done with air from which the carbon dioxide had been removed, but the result was then corrected for this effect so as to be applicable to real air.
