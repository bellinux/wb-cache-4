40|$|Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are {{increasingly}} present in our everyday life. Further operational needs are emerging, mainly in urban environments. In these obstructed environments, the signal emitted by the satellite is severely degraded {{due to the}} many obstacles. Consequently, the data demodulation and the user position calculation are difficult. GNSS signals being initially designed in an open environment context, their demodulation performance is thus generally studied in the associated AWGN propagation channel model. But nowadays, GNSS signals are also used in degraded environments. It is thus essential to provide and study their demodulation performance in urban propagation channel models. It is {{in this context that}} this PhD thesis is related, the final goal being to improve GNSS <b>signals</b> <b>demodulation</b> performance in urban areas, proposing a new signal. In {{order to be able to}} provide and study GNSS <b>signals</b> <b>demodulation</b> performance in urban environments, a simulation tool has been developed in this PhD thesis context: SiGMeP for ‘Simulator for GNSS Message Performance'. It allows simulating the entire emission/reception GNSS signal chain in urban environment. Existing and modernized <b>signals</b> <b>demodulation</b> performance has thus been computed with SiGMeP in urban environments. In order to represent this demodulation performance faithfully to reality, a new methodology adapted to urban channels is proposed in this dissertation. Then, to improve GNSS <b>signals</b> <b>demodulation</b> performance in urban environments, the research axis of this thesis has focused on the ‘Channel Coding' aspect. In order to decode the transmitted useful information, the receiver computes a detection function at the decoder input. But the detection function used in classic receivers corresponds to an AWGN propagation channel. This dissertation thus proposes an advanced detection function which is adapting to the propagation channel where the user is moving. This advanced detection function computation considerably improves demodulation performance, just in modifying the receiver part of the system. Finally, in order to design a new <b>signal</b> with better <b>demodulation</b> performance in urban environments than one of existing and future signals, a new LDPC channel code has been optimized for a CSK modulation. Indeed, the CSK modulation is a promising modulation in the spread spectrum signals world, which permits to free from limitation sin terms of data rate implied by current GNSS signals modulations...|$|R

50|$|Bit banging is a {{technique}} for serial communications using software instead of dedicated hardware. Software directly sets and samples the state of pins on the microcontroller, and is responsible for all parameters of the signal: timing, levels, synchronization, etc. In contrast to bit banging, dedicated hardware (such as a modem, UART, or shift register) handles these parameters and provides a (buffered) data interface in other systems, so software {{is not required to}} perform <b>signal</b> <b>demodulation.</b> Bit banging can be implemented at very low cost, and is used in, for example, embedded systems.|$|E
50|$|IQ {{imbalance}} is a performance-limiting {{issue in}} the design of direct conversion receivers, also known as zero intermediate frequency (IF) or homodyne receivers. Such a design translates the received radio frequency (RF, or passband) signal directly from the carrier frequency (fc) to baseband using only one mixing stage. The traditional heterodyne receiver structure needs an intermediate-frequency (IF) stage between the RF and baseband signals. The direct conversion receiver structure does not have an IF stage, and does not need an image rejection filter. Due to the lower component count, it is easier to integrate. However, a direct-conversion RF front-end suffers from two major drawbacks: one is IQ imbalance and the other is DC offset. When designing a homodyne receiver, control of IQ imbalance is necessary to limit <b>signal</b> <b>demodulation</b> error.|$|E

This advanced detection function takes into account takes into account some a priori information on the available Channel State Information (CSI). If no CSI is available, one has to blindly adapt the detection function in order to operate close to the perfect CSI case. This will lead to avoid mismatched decoding due to, for example, the consideration by default of the Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channel for the derivation of soft input...|$|R
