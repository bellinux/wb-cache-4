25|$|In 2000, Murakami {{published}} his “Superflat” {{theory in the}} catalogue for a group exhibition {{of the same name}} that he curated for the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles. The theory posits that there is a legacy of flat, 2-dimensional imagery from Japanese art history in manga and anime. This style differentiates itself from the western approach in its emphasis on surface and use of flat planes of color. <b>Superflat</b> also served as a commentary on post-war Japanese society in which, Murakami argues, differences in social class and popular taste have ‘flattened,’ producing a culture with little distinction between ‘high’ and ‘low’. The theory provided the context for his work and he elaborated on it with the exhibitions “Coloriage” (2002, Fondation Cartier pour l’art contemporain, Paris) and “Little Boy: The Arts of Japan’s Exploding Subculture” (2005, Japan Society, New York). These helped introduce Japan’s lesser-known creative culture overseas and such curatorial projects would {{become an integral part of}} Murakami’s multifaceted artistic practice.|$|E

Often called [...] "the Warhol of Japan", Murakami's surrealistic visual art is characterized by cartoonish creatures that appear friendly and cheerful at first glance, but possess dark, twisted undertones. The collaboration between the two came about when West visited Murakami's Kaikai Kiki studio in Roppongi Hills during a brief trip to Tokyo, Japan {{in the midst of}} touring the year before. The album's artwork expresses colorful, pastel imagery influenced by Murakami's affiliation with <b>superflat,</b> a post-modern art movement influenced by manga and anime. Its production process took place {{over the course of several}} weeks, with West constantly visualizing new images and emailing the ideas to Murakami and his team. Bringing the educational theme expressed by West's previous albums to a close, the visual plotline of the images contained within the liner notes lead up to a graduation ceremony that takes places within a fictional college institution situated within a futuristic metropolis called Universe City.

The <b>Superflat</b> movement, popularized by Murakami himself, is about emphasizing the two dimensionality of figures, which is influenced by Japanese manga and anime, while dually exposing the fetishes of Japanese consumerism.

Many of the artists involved in SoFlo <b>Superflat</b> art believe that the culture in SoFlo is not three-dimensional; therefore, it can be better interpreted in very flat brightly colored two-dimensional images. SoFlo <b>Superflat</b> {{was born out of}} the compression of genres which is shown through the pop-inflected work of younger artists. The artists in this genre have very specific styles that can be best described as a consistent pictorial language. Repetition of images and pattern is used create a signature look.

Takashi Murakami also coins the term <b>superflat</b> to chronicle the two-dimensional aspect of manga (comics) and anime (animated television and cinema). He argues how this international boom in pop media culture influenced Japanese fine art in relation to the social implications of <b>superflat</b> regarding the true impact of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945 on Japanese art and culture.
