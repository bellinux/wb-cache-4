25|$|Emin's two self-portraits taken {{inside her}} beach hut, The Last Thing I <b>Said</b> <b>To</b> <b>You</b> Is Don't Leave Me Here I (2000) and The Last Thing I <b>Said</b> <b>To</b> <b>You</b> Is Don't Leave Me Here II (2000) are a diptych {{although}} they are often exhibited and sold separately. They depict a naked Emin on her knees inside her beach hut which she and friend Sarah Lucas had bought in Whitstable, Kent in 1992.|$|E
25|$|The couple {{spent time}} by the sea in Whitstable together, using a beach hut that she uprooted and turned into art in 1999 with the title The Last Thing I <b>Said</b> <b>to</b> <b>You</b> is Don't Leave Me Here, and that was {{destroyed}} in the 2004 Momart warehouse fire.|$|E
25|$|The hut itself {{later became}} the {{sculpture}} The Last Thing I <b>Said</b> <b>To</b> <b>You</b> Is Don't Leave Me Here (The Hut) (1999). They are part of museum collections including Tate Modern, the Saatchi Gallery and the National Portrait Gallery and have been mass produced as postcards sold in museum shops around the world.|$|E

25|$|Emin {{has often}} {{made use of}} found objects in her work from the early use of a {{cigarette}} box found {{in a car crash}} in which her uncle died. The most well known example is My Bed, where she displayed her bed. Another instance is the removal of her beach hut from Whitstable to be displayed in a gallery. This work was titled The Last Thing I <b>Said</b> <b>To</b> <b>You</b> Is Don't Leave Me Here (The Hut) (1999).|$|E
500|$|Kim Newman and Alan Jones {{suggest that}} the mysteries of Arthur Conan Doyle, Rex Stout and Agatha Christie were all obvious {{influences}} on Tenebrae, {{and there are many}} references to these authors throughout the film. One example is the use of a quote from Sherlock Holmes in Conan Doyle's novel The Sign of Four (1890): [...] "How often have I <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> that when you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth?" [...] A variation of this quote is delivered many times in Tenebrae. Another reference is the dog attack: as something of a non sequitur, the scene is thought by Newman to be a likely nod to Conan Doyle's The Hound of the Baskervilles (1901–1902). Neal is seen to be reading this novel in an early scene. The imagery in the beach flashback references the American mystery film Suddenly, Last Summer (1959), especially the scene of Eva Robin's wearing white while kneeling in the sand, which is a direct reference to Elizabeth Taylor in that film.|$|E

It's easier to do if you're still reaching for the stars, it's a lot tougher if you're already a star, if you've already {{reached the top of the}} mountain." ...|$|E

2500|$|As my Predecessors have <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> {{on various}} occasions, the Church needs you, relies {{on you and}} {{continues}} to turn to you with trust, particularly to reach those physical and spiritual places which others do not reach or have difficulty in reaching. Paul VI's words remain engraved on your hearts: [...] "Wherever in the Church, {{even in the most}} difficult and extreme fields, at the crossroads of ideologies, in the social trenches, there has been and there is confrontation between the burning exigencies of man and the perennial message of the Gospel, here also there have been, and there are, Jesuits" [...] (Address to the 32nd General Congregation of the Jesuits,'3 December 1974;ORE,12 December, n. 2, p. 4.) ...|$|E
2500|$|On 24 May 2004, {{a fire in}} a Momart storage {{warehouse}} in East London destroyed many works from the Saatchi collection, including Emin's famous tent with appliquéd letters, Everyone I Have Ever Slept With 1963–1995 ("The Tent") (1995) and The Last Thing I <b>Said</b> <b>To</b> <b>You</b> Is Don't Leave Me Here ("The Hut") (1999), Emin's blue wooden beach hut that she bought with fellow artist Sarah Lucas and shared with her boyfriend of the time, the gallerist Carl Freedman. Emin spoke out angrily against what she perceived as a general public lack of sympathy, and even amusement, {{at the loss of}} the artworks in the fire. She commented, [...] "I'm also upset about those people whose wedding got bombed last week , and people being dug out from under 400ft of mud in the Dominican Republic." ...|$|E
