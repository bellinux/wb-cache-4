When investigations revealed large gaps in the collection, Malden turned her inquiries to the National Film and Television Archive – which promptly returned three full Second Doctor serials– The Dominators, The Krotons, and The War Games, adding seven more episodes and completing two of those serials. These all were standard 16mm film telerecordings with the exception of The Dominators Episode 3, which was a 35mm print.|$|E

30|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the problems and}} explores potential solutions for providing long term <b>storage</b> <b>and</b> access to research outputs, focusing mainly on research data. The ready availability of cloud <b>storage</b> <b>and</b> compute services provides a potentially attractive option for curation <b>and</b> <b>preservation</b> of research information. In contrast to deploying infrastructure within an organisation, which normally requires long lead times and upfront capital investment, cloud infrastructure is available on demand and is highly scalable. However, use of commercial cloud services in particular raises issues of governance, cost-effectiveness, trust and quality of service. We describe a set of in-depth case studies conducted with researchers across the sciences and humanities performing data-intensive research, which demonstrate the issues {{that need to be}} considered when preserving data in the cloud. We then describe the design of a repository framework that addresses these requirements. The framework uses hybrid cloud, combining internal institutional <b>storage,</b> cloud <b>storage</b> <b>and</b> cloud-based <b>preservation</b> services into a single integrated repository infrastructure. Allocation of content to storage providers is performed using on a rules-based approach. The results of an evaluation of the proof-of-concept system are described.|$|R
