25|$|This is {{a process}} which either offers a “choc” event and then stops, or just stops. In other words, if we treat the {{abstraction}} as an external view of the system (e.g., <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> see the decision reached by the person), nondeterminism has been introduced.|$|E
25|$|Most {{societies}} {{consider it}} a serious crime to force someone to engage in sexual acts or to engage in sexual activity with <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> consent. This is called sexual assault, and if sexual penetration occurs it is called rape, the most serious kind of sexual assault. The details of this distinction may vary among different legal jurisdictions. Also, what constitutes effective consent in sexual matters varies from culture to culture and is frequently debated. Laws regulating the minimum age at which a person can consent to have sex (age of consent) are frequently the subject of debate, as is adolescent sexual behavior in general. Some societies have forced marriage, where consent may not be required.|$|E

500|$|Journalist Jake Steelhammer {{believes}} the American urban myth of cow tipping {{originated in the}} 1970s. It [...] "stampeded into the '80s", he says, [...] "when movies like Tommy Boy and Heathers featured cow tipping expeditions." [...] Stories about cow tipping tend to be second-hand, he says, told by <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> claim to have tipped a cow but who knows someone else who says he or she did.|$|E
500|$|The Church {{requires}} {{those who}} have damaged the reputation of another to [...] "make reparation for the untruth they have communicated." [...] However, {{it does not require}} a person to reveal a truth to <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> have a right to know, and teaches respect for a right to privacy. Priests are prohibited from violating the seal of confession no matter how grave the sin or its impact on society.|$|E
500|$|Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson), still {{upset over}} being demoted by Jo, stops {{taking care of}} himself and openly looks through want ads in the office. His {{attitude}} changes when he speaks with applicant Robert California (James Spader), who disparages the position and the office. Merv Bronte (Ray Romano) ruins his interview, and Dwight becomes incensed that the position might go to <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> take it seriously. He demands to be interviewed, and while Jim balks, after Dwight's persistent efforts to acquire an interview, Jo instructs Jim to grant him one, as she likes [...] "a little bit of crazy."

500|$|After {{development}} was finished, the team reflected {{that the fundamental}} part of a Super Mario game {{was to make the}} player think about how [...] "fun" [...] it was to play the game itself, rather than simply finishing it. To accomplish this, Koizumi made sure that there were certain areas of the game which could be enjoyed by all types of people, including children. Shimizu added that Super Mario Galaxys ulterior motive was to have everybody [...] "gather around the TV", as he felt that a game starring Mario was not necessarily something which could be enjoyed by playing alone. The game was made to support six different save files – Shimizu liked the idea of one player looking at the progress of another player and seeing how they compared against their own. Iwata stated that when the first Super Mario game was released, there used to be [...] "many more" [...] people gathering around the television who would enjoy watching the gameplay experience. Iwata asserted that well-made video games were more enjoyable to spectate, and hoped that Super Mario Galaxys co-operative mode would tempt <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> usually play video games to join.|$|E
500|$|Joy Kim of Manga Life also {{praised the}} art style saying the {{characters}} were distinctive. She criticized {{the relationship of}} the lead couple, Si-Joon Lee and Mu-Yeon Park, saying that Mu-Yeon should not be so sweet and protective of <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> return her feelings. Kim praised the character Ji-Oh Yun as the most interesting character in the series and that his relationship with Mu-Hwa Park is interesting. Melinda Beasi of Manga Bookshelf reviewed the first volume and concluded that despite being [...] "somewhat muddled, the visual storytelling is not. The art is clean, lovely, and easy to follow, with a nicely restrained use of elaborate backgrounds and imaginative panel layouts. The character designs are pretty, distinct, and occasionally even creepy, as with Mu-Yeon's eternally smiling mask. The overall look is undeniably [...] "manhwa" [...] – a draw for some and a turn-off for others." [...] Erin Jones of Mania.com noted the distinct and typical romance story in the first volume, but found the first volume enjoyable and noted that the interactions of the [...] "Pig Girl" [...] are what will drive the series despite the volume ending without strong development of the characters. A review of volume two by Pop Culture Shock gave it a [...] "B+" [...] despite confusion caused by the plot and [...] "vagueness on the villain front, Pig Bride is still a very entertaining tale." ...|$|E
500|$|Evra {{returned}} to the team in November 2006 for the team's friendly match against Greece. He appeared as a half-time substitute for Abidal as France won the match 1–0. After going another year without representing France, Evra began appearing as a regular under Domenech in 2007. On 28 May 2008, he {{was included in the}} squad to participate in UEFA Euro 2008. He was initially placed onto the squad to serve as back-up to Abidal, however after failing to appear in the team's opening 0–0 draw with Romania, there were calls from the French media urging Domenech to insert Evra into the starting line-up at the behest of Abidal. Domenech relented and started Evra in the team's next match against the Netherlands, which ended in a 4–1 defeat. In the must-win final group stage match against Italy, Evra started his second consecutive match, but France lost 2–0 and were eliminated from the competition in the first round. Following the match, cameras witnessed Evra and teammates Patrick Vieira and Abidal getting into an altercation in the tunnel. Vieira later stated the video was shot after he got into an argument with a set of French supporters. A day after the team's elimination, Evra admitted his frustration to L'Équipe, stating, [...] "I am <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> like losing but I'm not going to make excuses. We had three games in this Euro, we have not won one. It's even hard to believe, to say it's over now." ...|$|E

5000|$|In 1974, Pascau {{was chosen}} to co-host Canada AM. According to co-host Helen Hutchinson, Pascau was [...] "all wrong" [...] for the job because as <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> {{grow up in the}} country, he [...] "couldn't ad-lib all sorts of facts about Canada to keep the {{conversation}} going". He was replaced by Norm Perry in 1975.|$|R
2500|$|Le Pen {{is often}} nicknamed the [...] "Menhir", {{due to his}} [...] "granitic nature" [...] as he is {{perceived}} as <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> give way to pressure or who cannot be easily knocked down. It also connects him to France's Celtic origins. Le Pen {{is often described as}} one of the most flamboyant and charismatic orators in Europe, whose speech blends folksy humour, crude attacks and rhetorical finesse.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{the right}} to the {{communication}} of the truth is not unconditional in Catholic teaching. Everyone must conform his life to the Gospel precept of fraternal love. In concrete situations one should judge whether {{it is appropriate to}} reveal the truth to someone who asks for it. Charity and respect for the truth should dictate the response to every request for information or communication. The good and safety of others, respect for privacy, and the common good are sufficient reasons for being silent about what ought not be known or for making use of a discreet language. The duty to avoid scandal often commands strict discretion. No one is bound to reveal the truth to <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> have {{the right to}} know it. [...] The golden rule helps one discern, in concrete situations, whether it would be appropriate to reveal the truth to someone who asks for it. The sacrament of confession is inviolable.|$|E
2500|$|The leap {{of faith}} is his {{conception}} of how an individual would believe in God or how a person would act in love. Faith is not a decision based on evidence that, say, certain beliefs about God are true or a certain person is worthy of love. No such evidence could ever be enough to completely justify the kind of total commitment involved in true religious faith or romantic love. Faith involves making that commitment anyway. Kierkegaard thought that to have faith {{is at the same}} time to have doubt. So, for example, for one to truly have faith in God, one would also have to doubt one's beliefs about God; the doubt is the rational part of a person's thought involved in weighing evidence, without which the faith would have no real substance. <b>Someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> realize that Christian doctrine is inherently doubtful and that there can be no objective certainty about its truth does not have faith but is merely credulous. For example, it takes no faith to believe that a pencil or a table exists, when one is looking at it and touching it. In the same way, to believe or have faith in God is to know that one has no perceptual or any other access to God, and yet still has faith in God. Kierkegaard writes, [...] "doubt is conquered by faith, just as it is faith which has brought doubt into the world".|$|E

5000|$|The re-released {{version has}} an {{incorrect}} track listing, {{due to the}} use of artwork from the original LP version. Cleopatra Records reissued the album after [...] "purchasing" [...] the rights from <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> legally own them.

2500|$|Part of {{the reason}} for voter decline in the recent 2016 {{election}} is likely because of restrictive voting laws around the country. Brennan Center for Justice reported that in 2016 fourteen states passed restrictive voting laws. Examples of these laws are photo ID mandates, narrow times for early voter, and limitations on voter registration. Barbour and Wright also believe that one of the causes is restrictive voting laws but they call this system of laws regulating the electorate. The Constitution gives states the power to make decisions regarding restrictive voting laws. In 2008 the Supreme Court made a crucial decision regarding Indiana’s voter ID law in saying that it does not violate the constitution. Since then almost half of the states have passed restrictive voting laws. These laws contribute to Barbour and Wrights idea of the rational nonvoter. This is <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> vote because the benefits of them not voting outweighs the cost to vote. These laws add to the “cost” of voting, or reason that make it more difficult and to vote. In the United States programs such as MTV's [...] "Rock the Vote" [...] and the [...] "Vote or Die" [...] initiatives have been introduced to increase turnouts of those between the ages of 18 and 25. A number of governments and electoral commissions have also launched efforts to boost turnout. For instance Elections Canada has launched mass media campaigns to encourage voting prior to elections, as have bodies in Taiwan and the United Kingdom.|$|E

5|$|Gandhi's {{experiment}} with abstinence went beyond sex, and extended to food. He consulted the Jain scholar Rajchandra, whom he fondly called Raychandbhai.
