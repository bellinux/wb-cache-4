25|$|A surface {{marker buoy}} (SMB) {{tethered}} to a diver is usually towed on {{a thin line}} attached to a reel, spool or other device which allows the diver to control the line length, so that excessive <b>slack</b> <b>line</b> can be avoided.|$|E
2500|$|Modern fly reels {{typically}} have more sophisticated disc-type drag systems made of composite materials that feature increased adjustment range, consistency, {{and resistance to}} high temperatures from drag friction. [...] Most of these fly reels also feature large-arbor spools designed to reduce line memory, maintain consistent drag and assist the quick retrieval of <b>slack</b> <b>line</b> in the event a hooked fish makes a sudden run towards the angler. [...] Most modern fly reels are ambidextrous, allowing the angler to place the crank handle of the reel on either the right or the left side as desired.|$|E
2500|$|Though {{spinning}} reels do {{not suffer}} from backlash, line can occasionally be trapped underneath {{itself on the}} spool or even detach from the reel in loose loops of line. [...] Some of these issues {{can be traced to}} overfilling the spool with line, while others are due {{to the way in which}} the line is wound onto the spool by the rotating bail or pickup. [...] Various oscillating spool mechanisms have been introduced over the years in an effort to solve this problem. [...] Spinning reels also tend to have more issues with twisting of the fishing line. [...] Line twist in spinning reels can occur from the spin of an attached lure, the action of the wire bail against the line when engaged by the crank handle, or even retrieval of line that is under load (spinning reel users normally pump the rod up and down, then retrieve the <b>slack</b> <b>line</b> to avoid line twist and stress on internal components). [...] In order to minimize line twist, many anglers who use a spinning reel manually reposition the bail after each cast with the pickup nearest the rod in order to minimize line twist.|$|E

50|$|During 2012, {{a version}} of this rig called the flying chod rig was made popular by Jim Shelley. Whereas on a normal chod rig the short hook length is held in place by a stop on the line, a flying chod does not use any form of stop: when a fish picks up the bait it can run freely. Jim Shelley used this {{technique}} in conjunction with <b>slack</b> <b>lines</b> and putting his rod tops in the air.|$|R

60|$|He {{pressed down}} his {{telegraph}} and a curious silence followed the clang of the gong when the engines stopped. The Shasta lurched on more {{slowly into the}} fog, and when Jimmy swung up his hand {{a man on the}} half-seen forecastle loosed the deep-sea lead, while another, perched in the mainmast shrouds, stood intent with a coil of <b>slack</b> <b>line</b> in his hand. There was a splash, the line ran out, and when a sing-song cry came up Jimmy made a little impatient gesture as he turned to the chart.|$|E

At that moment Tom Lokins uttered a cry of mingled anger and disappointment. We all turned round and saw our shipmate standing with the <b>slack</b> <b>line</b> in his hand, and such an expression on his weather-beaten face, that I could scarce help laughing. The harpoon had not been well fixed; it had lost its hold, and the fish was now free! ...|$|E

50|$|Emergency furling is {{fast and}} simple. When {{the sheets and}} halyard are let go, the sail will blow down wind, drop into the cradle of the topping lifts, while being steadied by the full battens. While this is fast and easy, it will also make a mess of the halyards, boom hauling parrel, yard hauling parrel, and downhauls. They {{will have to be}} put in order before raising the sail again. For non-emergency furling, it is {{preferable}} to drop the sail with two crew so that the slackening lines can be hauled in and maintained in order. Alternatively, a single-handed sailor can lower the sail in stages and attend to the <b>slack</b> <b>lines.</b>|$|R
60|$|In the {{meantime}} other ropes were passed {{down to the}} squire. One he placed round his own waist; two others he fastened {{one on each side}} of the horse's girth. Then his friend lowered the bridle, and he managed to put it on the horse and attached a rope to it. The fishermen took the lines, and, paying out as they went so as to leave plenty of <b>slack</b> <b>line,</b> got on the rocks just above the little beach whereon, sheltered though it was, the seas broke heavily. There they waited, ready to pull the horse through the surf when he should have come close enough.|$|E
60|$|Scarcely had I {{said that}} when a smashing break in the water {{on the other side}} of the boat alarmed and further excited me. I did not see the fish. But I jumped up and bent over the stern to shove my rod deep into the water back of the propeller. I did this despite the {{certainty}} that the fish had broken loose. It was a wise move, for the rod was nearly pulled out of my hands. I lifted it, bent double, and began to wind furiously. So intent was I on the job of getting up the <b>slack</b> <b>line</b> that I scarcely looked up from the reel.|$|E
6000|$|Then we {{ran away}} from the fish, {{circling}} and letting out <b>slack</b> <b>line.</b> When {{we came to the}} end of the line we turned back a little, and with a big slack we took the risk of cutting the line and tying it on the other reel. We had just got this done when the line straightened tight! I wound in about twelve hundred feet of line and was tired and wet when I had gotten in all I could pull. This brought us to within a couple of hundred feet of our quarry. Also it brought us to five o'clock. Five hours!... I began to have queer sensations--aches, pains, tremblings, saggings. Likewise misgivings! ...|$|E
60|$|Benjy {{promised to}} {{manipulate}} the check-string with care. The struggling natives were ordered to let the kite straighten the <b>slack</b> of the <b>line</b> gradually.|$|R
60|$|The {{cause of}} this exclamation of {{surprise}} was the <b>slacking</b> of the <b>line</b> so suddenly that Maximus was induced to believe the fish had escaped.|$|R
60|$|All at once, just as Dan {{yelled to}} hook him, the reel ceased to turn, the <b>line</b> <b>slacked.</b> I began to jerk hard and wind in, all breathless with {{excitement}} and frenzy of hope. Not {{for half a}} dozen pumps and windings did I feel him. Then heavy and strong came the weight. I jerked and reeled. But I {{did not get a}} powerful strike on that fish. Suddenly the <b>line</b> <b>slacked</b> and my heart contracted. He had shaken the hook. I reeled in. Bait gone! He had doubled on me and run as swiftly toward the boat as he had at first run from it.|$|R
60|$|When I strolled {{around the}} pond in misty weather I was {{sometimes}} {{amused by the}} primitive mode which some ruder fisherman had adopted. He would perhaps have placed alder branches over the narrow holes in the ice, which were four or five rods apart and an equal distance from the shore, and having fastened {{the end of the}} line to a stick to prevent its being pulled through, have passed the <b>slack</b> <b>line</b> over a twig of the alder, a foot or more above the ice, and tied a dry oak leaf to it, which, being pulled down, would show when he had a bite. These alders loomed through the mist at regular intervals as you walked half way round the pond.|$|E
60|$|Then we waded up-shore {{farther and}} began to fish. In just five minutes I had {{the same kind of}} strike, slight, almost imperceptible, vibrating, and I hooked a fish exactly as I had the first one. He was light of weight, but swift as a flash. I played him from where I stood. This time I essayed with all skill to keep a taut line. It was impossible. Now I felt his weight and again only a <b>slack</b> <b>line.</b> This fish, too, ran right to my feet, then in a boiling splash sheered away. But he could not go far. I reeled him back and led him to the canoe. He was small, and the {{smallness}} of him was such a surprise in contrast to what his fight had led me to imagine he was.|$|E
60|$|That {{might well}} have been, but, as I expected, he was not. He broke water on a <b>slack</b> <b>line</b> and showed us all his dripping, {{colorful}} body nearer than a hundred feet. R. C. thereupon performed with incredible speed at the reel and quickly had a tight line. Mr. Sailfish did not like that. He slid out, wrathfully wagging his bill, and left a seamy, foamy track behind him, finally to end that play with a splendid long leap. He was headed away from us now, with two hundred yards of line out, going hard and fast, {{and we had to}} follow him. We had a fine straightaway run to recover the line. This was a thrilling chase, and one, I think, we never would have had if R. C. had been using heavy tackle. The sailfish led us out half a mile before he sounded.|$|E
500|$|... "New Guys" [...] {{featured}} one of {{the final}} few performances of Mindy Kaling as Kelly Kapoor, who left the series to star in her own comedy television series The Mindy Project, which was created for the Fox Broadcasting Company.

The episode features both Clark Duke and Jake Lacy as two new Dunder Mifflin employees who have been hired to [...] "go through the back log of over 4,000 unanswered customer complaints that" [...] Kelly has ignored the past few years.

The voice of the documentarian that responds to Jim is that of series director David Rogers. Rogers also voiced the same character in the penultimate episode opener [...] "A.A.R.M.".

5000|$|Drop {{shotting}} {{is a high}} finesse {{technique for}} fishing plastic baits like Senko's, and consist of a small thin-wire hook with a weight attached to the tag {{end of the line}} about 12-18". This is in contrast to the more traditional Texas Rig, where the weight slides inline, resting on the nose of the bait, or the Carolina Rig, where the weight is fixed above the bait. The drop shot rig provides the ability to <b>slack</b> the <b>line</b> and twitch the rod, giving it an enticing wiggle on the way down. This simple, but versatile technique has endless combinations with the different hooks, soft plastics and weights that can be used.|$|R
60|$|Now {{that all}} spars were gone, {{it was no}} easy job to get her launched. Some of the {{necessary}} cargo was first stowed on board: the specie, in particular, being packed in a strong chest and secured with lashings to the after-thwart {{in case of a}} capsize. Then a piece of the bulwarks was razed {{to the level of the}} deck, and the boat swung thwart-ship, made fast with a <b>slack</b> <b>line</b> to either stump, and successfully run out. For a voyage of forty miles to hospitable quarters, not much food or water was required but they took both in superfluity. Amalu and Mac, both ingrained sailor-men, had chests which were the headquarters of their lives; two more chests with handbags, oilskins, and blankets supplied the others; Hadden, amid general applause, added the last case of the brown sherry; the captain brought the log, instruments, and chronometer; nor did Hemstead forget the banjo or a pinned handkerchief of Butaritari shells.|$|E
60|$|Despite my intense excitement, I {{was calm}} enough to follow directions. But when I struck I felt no weight at all--no {{strain on the}} line. Frantically I wound and jerked--again and again! I never felt him at all. Suddenly my line rose--and then, bewilderingly near the boat, when I was looking far off, the water split with a roar and out shot a huge, gleaming, white-and-purple fish. He blurred in my sight. Down he went with a crash. I wound the reel like a madman, but I never even half got up the <b>slack</b> <b>line.</b> The {{swordfish}} had run straight toward the boat. He leaped again, in a place I did not expect, and going down, instantly came up in another direction. His speed, his savageness, stunned me. I could not judge of his strength, for I never felt his weight. The next leap I saw him sling the hook. It was a great performance. Then that swordfish, finding himself free, leaped for the open sea, and every few yards he {{came out in a}} clean jump. I watched him, too fascinated to count the times he broke water, but he kept it up till he was out of sight on the horizon.|$|E
6000|$|... "That'll {{never come}} off!" [...] he exclaimed. We circled old Xiphius, and when about fifty yards distant he lifted himself clear out--a most terrifying and {{magnificent}} fish. He would have weighed four hundred. His colors shone--blazed--purple blue, pale green, iridescent copper, and flaming silver. Then {{he made a}} long, low lunge away from us. I bade him good-by, but let the barracuda drift back. We {{waited a long time}} while the line slowly bagged, drifting toward us. Suddenly I felt a quick, strong pull. It electrified me. I yelled to Dan. He said, excitedly, [...] "Feed it to him!" [...] but the line ceased to play out. I waited, slowly losing hope, with my pulses going back to normal. After we drifted for five minutes I wound in the line. The barracuda was gone and the leader had been rolled up. This astounded us. That swordfish had taken my bait. I felt his first pull. Then he had come toward the boat, crushing the bait off the hook, without making even a twitch on the <b>slack</b> <b>line.</b> It was heartbreaking. But we could not have done any different. Dan decided the fish had come after the teasers. This experience taught us exceeding respect for the broadbill.|$|E
60|$|Down it went, {{carrying}} out the line {{at a rate that}} caused the chocks through which it passed to smoke. In a few minutes the line ceased to run out, and the whale returned to the surface. It had scarcely showed its nose, when the <b>slack</b> of the <b>line</b> was hauled in, and a second harpoon was fixed in its body.|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{conventional}} knowledge {{for as long}} as ships have existed that the catenary effect of an anchor line augments the efficiency of an anchoring system. This is achieved by making the anchor line as heavy as possible thus lowering the effective angle of pull on the anchor. This notion has, however, come under criticism in recent times. Many small boat owners have shifted to lighter tauter lines for anchoring. The argument in favor of this new method is the cost savings associated with lighter anchoring and the tension relief that comes with using lighter and more elastic anchor lines. The {{purpose of this study is}} to therefore compare the performance of long <b>slack</b> <b>lines</b> that form catenary shapes with that of shorter taut lines. An analysis is presented that describes the surge motion of a small anchored boat exposed to an input forcing function and various retarding forces and effects. The anchoring system used in the analytical model results in a non-linear but symmetrical restoring force, which resists the force-induced motion of the boat. Two main types of anchor lines are considered: uniform-material and two-material anchor lines. Each anchor line is evaluated both in catenary configuration and taut configuration in terms of its ability to minimize the motions of the boat and tension force in the anchor line due to wind disturbances. by Jessy Mbagara Mwarage.

60|$|Now {{upon the}} second lowering, the boat paddled upon the whale; {{and as the}} fish {{received}} the darted iron, it gave its customary rap, which happened, in this instance, to be right under poor Pip's seat. The involuntary consternation of the moment caused him to leap, paddle in hand, out of the boat; and in such a way, {{that part of the}} <b>slack</b> whale <b>line</b> coming against his chest, he breasted it overboard with him, so as to become entangled in it, when at last plumping into the water. That instant the stricken whale started on a fierce run, the line swiftly straightened; and presto! poor Pip came all foaming up to the chocks of the boat, remorselessly dragged there by the line, which had taken several turns around his chest and neck.|$|R
6000|$|No {{doubt the}} {{swordfish}} associated the thing fast in his jaw with the boat, for he suddenly awoke. He lifted himself, wagging his sword, showing his great silvery side. Then {{he began to}} thresh. I never felt a quarter of such power {{at the end of}} a line. He went swift as a flash. Then he leaped sheer ahead, like a porpoise, only infinitely more active. We all yelled. He was of great size, over three hundred, broad, heavy, long, and the most violent and savage fish I ever had a look at. Then he rose half--two-thirds out of the water, shaking his massive head, jaws open, sword sweeping, and seemed to move across the water in a growing, boiling maelstrom of foam. This was the famous [...] "walking on his tail" [...] I had heard so much about. It was an incredible feat. He must have covered fifty yards. Then he plunged down, and turned swiftly in a curve toward the boat. He looked threatening to me. I could not manage the <b>slack</b> <b>line.</b> One more leap and he threw the hook. I found the point of the hook bent. It had never been embedded in his jaw. And also I found that his violent exercise had lasted just one minute. I wondered how long I would have lasted had the hook been deep-set.|$|E
60|$|We went on fishing. Sailfish {{would jump}} around {{us for a}} while and then they would stop. We would not see one for several minutes. It is always very {{exciting}} to be among them this way. Presently I had one take hold to run off slowly and steadily, and I let him go for fifty feet, and when I struck I tore the hook away from him. Quickly I let <b>slack</b> <b>line</b> run back to him ten or fifteen feet at a time, until I felt him take it once more. He took it rather suspiciously, I felt, and I honestly believe that I could tell that he was mouthing or chewing the bait, which made me careful to let the line run off easily to him. Suddenly he rushed off, making the reel smoke. I let him run one hundred and fifty feet and then stood up, throwing on the drag, and when the line straightened tight I tried to jerk at him as hard as the tackle would stand. As a matter of fact, however, he was going so fast and hard that he hooked himself. It is indeed seldom that I miss one when he runs like this. This fellow came up two hundred yards from the boat and slid along the water with half of his body raised, much like one of those coasting-boards I have seen bathers use, towed behind a motor-launch. He went down and came up in a magnificent sheer leap, with his broad sail shining in the sun. Very angry he was, and he reminded me of a Marlin swordfish. Next he went down, and came up again bent in a curve, with the big sail stretched again. He skittered over the water, going down and coming up, until he had leaped seven times. This was a big, heavy fish, and on the light six-ounce tip and nine-thread line I had my work cut out for me. We had to run the boat toward him so I could get back my line. Here was the advantage of having a fast boat with a big rudder. Otherwise I would have lost my fish. After some steady deep plugging he came up again and set my heart aflutter by a long surface play in which he took off one hundred yards of line and then turned, leaping straight for the boat. Fortunately the line was slack and I could throw off the drag and let him run. <b>Slack</b> <b>line</b> never bothers me when I really get one of these fish well hooked. If he is not well hooked he is going to get away, anyhow. After that he went down into deep water and I had one long hour of hard work in bringing him to the boat. Six hours later he weighed fifty-eight and a half pounds, and as he had lost a good deal of blood and dried out considerably, he would have gone over sixty pounds, which, so far, is the largest sailfish I know of caught on light tackle.|$|E
60|$|The {{following}} day {{we went up}} to Twin Lakes and {{found them to be}} beautiful little green gems surrounded by spruce. I saw some big trout in the large lake, but they were wary. We tried every way to get a strike. No use! In the little lake matters were worse. It was full of trout up to two pounds. They would run at the fly, only to refuse it. Exasperating work! We gave up and returned to Big Fish. After supper we went out to try again. The lake was smooth and quiet. All at once, as if by concert, the trout began to rise everywhere. In a little bay we began to get strikes. I could see the fish rise to the fly. The small ones were too swift and the large ones too slow, it seemed. We caught one, and then had bad luck. We snarled our lines, drifted wrong, broke leaders, snapped off flies, hooked too quick and too slow, and did everything that was clumsy. I lost two big fish because they followed the fly as I drew it toward me across the water to imitate a swimming fly. Of course this made a large <b>slack</b> <b>line</b> which I could not get up. Finally I caught one big fish, and altogether we got seven. All in that little bay, where the water was shallow! In other places we could not catch a fish. I had one vicious strike. The fish appeared to be feeding on a tiny black gnat, which we could not imitate. This was the most trying experience of all. We ought to have caught a basketful.|$|E
