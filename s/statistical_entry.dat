Surgical students from across Ireland were invited to upload learning points daily while paired with their peers in a peer-reviewing process. This study was designed to assess content accuracy and evaluate the benefit of the review process. Method: A reflective content sample was selected from the database representing all gastrointestinal (GI) surgical entries. All questions and answers were double corrected by four examiners, blinded to the “review” status of the <b>entries.</b> <b>Statistical</b> analysis was performed to compare accuracy between “reviewed” and “non-reviewed” entries. Results: There were 15, 569 individual entries from 2009 – 2013, 2977 were GI surgery entries; 678 (23 %) were peer reviewed. Marked out of 5, accuracy in the reviewed group was 4. 24 and 4. 14 in the non-reviewed group. This was not statistically different (p = 0. 11).

40|$|Background: Radical {{cystectomy}} is {{the standard}} treatment for patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer. Three to four cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy is widely used in patients with pT 3 -pT 4 a and/or pN+ MO disease {{in an effort to}} delay recurrence and prolong survival. Although a number of clinical trials have been carried out, this paper questions whether the use of adjuvant combination chemotherapy is actually justified. Patients and methods: A review of published randomized trials of adjuvant cisplatin-containing combination chemotherapy in locally advanced bladder cancer was undertaken. Four trials including a total of 278 randomized patients were identified. Results: Although these trials appear to show a significant difference in favor of adjuvant chemotherapy, serious methodological flaws were found. They have major deficiencies in terms of sample size, early stopping of patient <b>entry,</b> <b>statistical</b> analyses, reporting of results and drawing conclusions. Conclusions: These trials provide insufficient evidence to support the routine use of adjuvant chemotherapy in clinical practice due to small sample sizes, confusing analyses and terminology, and the reporting of questionable conclusions. Analyses of the duration of survival were either not done or were inconclusive and quality of life has not been considered. New large scale, multicenter trials are imperative in order to provide convincing results...|$|R

Its upper and lower halves clearly belong to different <b>statistical</b> groups, the <b>entries</b> in the former being almost uniformly larger {{than those in the}} latter, in the proportion of 54° to 37°, say 3 to 2, which roughly represents in numerical terms the nearer relationship between digits of the same name, as compared to that between digits of different names. It seems also that of the 6 couplets of digits bearing different names, the relationship is closest between the middle finger and the two adjacent ones (60° and 52°, as against 24°, 27°, 39° and 23°). It is further seen in every pair of entries that whorls are related together more closely than loops. I note this, but cannot explain it. So far as my statistical inquiries into heredity have hitherto gone, all peculiarities were found to follow the same law of transmission, none being more surely inherited than others. If there were a tendency in any one out of many alternative characters to be more heritable than the rest, that character would become universally prevalent, in the absence of restraining influences. But it does not follow that there are no peculiar restraining influences here, nor that what is true for heredity, should be true, in all its details, as regards the relationships between the different digits.|$|R

METHODS: After informed consent, the translated and adapted version of the SPAI Portuguese was tested and re-tested at a 14 -day interval {{in a sample of}} 225 university students, both genders, from 4 different undergraduate courses. After double data <b>entry,</b> <b>statistical</b> analysis included Cronbach's alphas, Pearson and intra-class correlation coefficients. RESULTS: The studied sample consisted of 213 students from 4 sub-samples: 95 law students, 31 social communication students, 54 civil engineering students and 33 dental medicine students. The mean age was 23 (± 6) years and 110 (51. 6 %) were female. The Cronbach' alpha was 0. 96, no difference for both genders. The differential (total) score of the SPAI Portuguese showed Pearson coefficient 0. 83 (95 % CI 0. 78 - 0. 87) and Intra-class coefficient 0. 83 (95 % CI 0. 78 - 0. 86). There was no statistical difference in Pearson coefficients between genders (p = 0. 121) and the 4 sub-samples (p = 0. 258). CONCLUSION: The results do not ensure validity, however, the SPAI Portuguese version presented a good content homogeneity with satisfactory level of internal consistency. The temporal stability evaluated was substantial.

40|$|Abstract Background Abnormal uterine {{bleeding}} {{is often}} investigated in clinical studies and critical to identify during gynecological consultation. The current standard for quantification of {{menstrual blood loss}} is the alkaline-hematin-method. However, this method is expensive and inconvenient for patients. Bleeding diaries, although widely used, provide only qualitative information on menstrual blood loss. Other methods have been developed, but still do not provide reliable quantitative data. Methods We estimated blood loss volume using data from two clinical studies in women suffering abnormal menstrual bleeding. These estimations were derived from mixed linear models based on diary data, hematological parameters and age. To validate the models, we applied our results to data from a third study with a similar patient population. Results The resulting best fitting model uses diary entries on bleeding intensity at a particular day, information on occurrence and frequency of single bleeding intensities in defined time windows, hemoglobin and ferritin values and age of the patient all as predictors of menstrual blood loss volume. Sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of excessive bleeding were 87 % and 70 %, respectively. Our model-based estimates reflect the subjective assessment by physicians and patients {{in the same way}} as the measured values do. When applying the model to an independent study, we found a correlation of 0. 73 between estimated and measured values for the blood loss in a single day. Further models with reduced number of parameters (simplified for easier practical use) still showed correlation values between 0. 69 and 0. 73. Conclusions We present a method for estimating menstrual blood loss volume in women suffering from prolonged or excessive menstrual bleeding. Our <b>statistical</b> model includes <b>entries</b> from bleeding diaries, laboratory parameters and age and produces results which correlate well with data derived by the alkaline-hematin-method. Therefore, this model may be used to estimate menstrual blood loss volume in both routine gynecological counseling and clinical studies. </p...|$|R
40|$|Representation of Immigrants in New Zealand Print Media: A Critical Discourse Analysis New Zealand {{is often}} {{perceived}} {{as one of}} the most diverse countries in terms of its population, with “more ethnicities in New Zealand than there are countries in the world” (Statistics New Zealand, 2013). According to the 2013 census, 39 % of people who live in Auckland, New Zealand’s most immigrant-populated city, were born overseas. In such a setting, the issue of social harmony becomes important. Media institutions hold power and therefore their representations play a significant role in how immigrants are perceived and whether they are embraced and welcomed or resisted. It is for this reason that media discourse deserves attention. Research in this area in the context of New Zealand has been limited and furthermore has leaned towards content analysis or a purely qualitative analysis of a specific diaspora. Addressing these issues, my research aims to gain a better understanding of how immigrants are discursively constructed in the New Zealand Herald newspaper during the years 2007 and 2008. Given that the Global Financial Crisis began to make its presence felt in 2008, this study also sought to investigate expected discrepancies in the representation of immigrants during economically challenging times. Grounded within a critical approach, this study adopts methodic triangulation; that is, the data is analysed using two complementary analytical frameworks, namely that of corpus-assisted discourse analysis (Baker, KhosraviNik, Krzyzanowski, McEnery, & Wodak, 2008) and the Discourse-Historical Approach (Reisigl & Wodak, 2009). Using these two frameworks, I use <b>statistical</b> information as <b>entry</b> points into the data and explore significant collocations which contribute to the construction of dominant representations. This analysis is followed by an in-depth analysis of systematically sampled news articles with the aim of identifying the ii various discursive and argumentation strategies commonly employed in print media. The findings from both analyses point to a rather ambivalent representation of immigrants. On the one hand, immigrants are constructed as being qualified and playing an important role in filling skill shortages in New Zealand. This positive construction depicts immigrants as an economic resource which ought to be capitalized. In addition, liquid metaphors, previously argued to dehumanize immigrants and construct them as uncontrollable (KhosraviNik, 2009) are surprisingly used in my data to construct the immigration of large numbers of immigrants to New Zealand as essential. On the other hand, immigrants are also constructed as threateningly Other or passive victims. Therefore, immigrants are not only constructed as beneficial to New Zealand society but are also represented as being problematic. This study identifies a unique representation of immigrants in the New Zealand Herald which could perhaps be explained by the unique socio-political and geographical context of the country. The triangulation and methodic rigour of this study also ensure that the findings are generalizable to the whole dataset and contribute to current understandings of immigrant representation and approaches to the study of discourse and representation...|$|R
40|$|MCom (Business Management), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 The globalised {{world of}} {{business}} {{is driven by}} a complex mix of communication technology, consumerism and social, economic and political change. In pursuit of the latest technologies, processes and systems, managers often tend to neglect their business’s organisational culture. Traditional assets and strategies can easily be copied. A business’s organisational culture {{is much more difficult}} to reproduce and can be a competitive differentiator. Businesses which deliberately manage their organisational cultures, outperform similar businesses that do not. The performance culture in a business depends largely on the effectiveness of managers to establish an attitude of performance among employees. To achieve high performance, managers need different competencies to engage workers’ hearts and minds, as well as take advantage (in a positive way) of their physical labour. Managers who are able to create and sustain a performance culture and react to rapid change in markets and technologies, can maintain exceptional service and product quality levels despite of unpredictable business environments. Some managerial competencies are more conducive and prone to managerial effectiveness and the subsequent enhancement of a business's performance culture. Only a few businesses worldwide are managed by the notion that a performance culture equates outstanding profits and little research exists pertaining to managerial competencies that allow managers to motivate employees, win their commitment, and ultimately enhance the business’s performance culture. The primary objective {{of this study is to}} investigate the role of managers in enhancing performance culture. Knowledge and current perceptions of first-line managers and middle-level managers regarding the business’s performance culture (in terms of the associated business practices and employee characteristics), as well as certain related managerial competencies (such as communication, planning and administration, teamwork and emotional intelligence) were obtained. With regard to research methodology, the study used descriptive research in the form of quantitative, self-administered questionnaires. Two questionnaires were developed and uploaded on the Survey Monkey website. Subsequently, all first-line managers and middle-level managers (employed at Amalgamated Beverage Industries (ABI), the soft drink division of The South African Breweries (Pty) Ltd) were informed of the survey via an e-mail containing a cover letter as well as the hyperlink to the relevant questionnaires. The target population in this study was obtained by means of a census. Of the 438 respondents identified for the census, 186 viable questionnaires, comprising of 73 middle-level manager and 113 first-line manager respondents, were used for <b>statistical</b> analysis. Data <b>entry,</b> tabulation and <b>statistical</b> analysis were done by the Statistical Consultation Services of the North-West University (Potchefstroom Campus). The results of this study indicate that organisational culture places considerable pressure on employee behaviour and influences businesses in several ways. Every business has a unique organisational culture and an organisational culture that is not conducive to the performance culture of the business, needs to be addressed. In their efforts to enhance performance culture, managers need to display certain managerial competencies. It is recommended that, in order to assess a business’s performance culture and the degree to which managers display the associated managerial competencies, employees’ perceptions are taken into consideration, as practically significant differences pertaining to gender, qualification, age as well as managerial levels exist between different groups of respondents. The creation of a performance culture should be viewed as a continuous effort and it is suggested that managers investigate certain best practices in this regard in order to differentiate their businesses from competitors. In addition, managers may gain from training or coaching in order to develop and/or improve managerial skills related to the communication, planning and administration, teamwork and emotional intelligence managerial competencies, and subsequently practicing these in order to enhance the business’s performance culture.
