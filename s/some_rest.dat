However, the Ice King feels that something is awry and tries to warn Finn, but Finn angrily scolds him and tells {{him to leave the}} kingdom.

Finn leaves to acquire items that Bubblegum requests—which includes weapons-grade plutonium, ammonium, and gasoline among other items—and Jake tries to cheer Bubblegum up with a song.|$|E
5|$|During the Gallipoli Campaign, Burgess, now a major, {{commanded}} the 9th (Tasmanian) Battery. However, the guns of his battery were not landed until early May 1915. He {{and his men}} took over the guns of 7th Battery, allowing its personnel <b>some</b> <b>rest.</b> On 5 May, while reporting the location of Turkish artillery positions to his commander, Colonel Charles Rosenthal, he was wounded by shelling. His injuries required hospital treatment but {{he returned to the}} front on 17 May. Eventually poor health led to his evacuation from Gallipoli in October 1915. For his services during the campaign, he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order. Promoted to lieutenant colonel in March 1916 and given command of the 3rd Australian Field Artillery Brigade, he served on the Western Front.|$|E

5|$|During {{the two-week}} hiatus between games four and five, the Canadians visited Sweden and played two {{exhibition}} games versus the Swedish national team. The Team Canada management {{had arranged for}} the visit to Sweden {{to get used to}} the bigger ice surfaces in Europe, and stopping in Sweden would provide <b>some</b> <b>rest</b> for Team Canada before resuming the series in Moscow. The games took place on September 16 and September 17 at the Johanneshovs Isstadion arena in Stockholm. Canada won game one 4–1; the second game was a 4–4 tie. The first exhibition game introduced Canada to the two West German referees, Josef Kompalla and Franz Baader. These two referees would figure prominently in games six and eight of the Canada-Russia series.|$|E
5|$|The Spartan {{council of}} Elders, the gerousia, {{suggested}} that the Spartan women be sent to Crete for their protection. They were dissuaded from doing so by Arachidamia, the former queen and grandmother of the Eurypontid King Eudamidas II who convinced them that the women could assist in the city's defence. In order to guarantee the fighting men <b>some</b> <b>rest,</b> the women and the elderly began bolstering defences. Aware that Pyrrhus had elephants with him, the defenders dug a large trench and sunk wagons into the ground at its flanks in order to hinder the Epiriote advance. Moreover, messengers were sent both to summon Areus back and to request aid from Antigonus, despite the fact the Sparta and Macedon had traditionally been hostile. Pausanias, the Greek geographer, claims that Sparta received some aid from Messene and the pro-Spartan faction at Argos.|$|E
5|$|The color {{sequence}} of Rublev's icons begins with showing only selected details, climaxing in Rublev's most famous icon, The Trinity. One reason for including this color final was, according to Tarkovsky, {{to give the}} viewer <b>some</b> <b>rest</b> and {{to allow him to}} detach himself from Rublev's life and to reflect. The film finally ends with the image of horses at river in the rain. To Tarkovsky horses symbolized life, and including horses in the final scene (and in many other scenes in the film) meant that life was the source of all of Rublev's art.|$|E

The 45th Division would be under Major General Ernest J. Dawley's U.S. VI Corps, within the U.S. Fifth Army commanded by Lieutenant General Mark W. Clark. The plan called for the landing of the Allied forces in the vicinity of Salerno, Italy, about 200 miles north of Sicily.|$|E

5|$|The Earp party rode {{north to}} the Percy Ranch, but were not welcomed by Hugh and Jim Percy, who feared the Cowboys; after a meal and <b>some</b> <b>rest,</b> they left around 3:00 {{in the morning of}} March 27. The Earp party slipped into the area near Tombstone and met with supporters, {{including}} Hairlip Charlie Smith and Warren Earp. On March 27, the posse arrived at the Sierra Bonita Ranch owned by Henry Hooker, a wealthy and prominent rancher. That night, Dan Tipton caught the first stage out of Tombstone and headed for Benson, carrying $1,000 from mining owner and Earp supporter E. B. Gage for the posse. Hooker congratulated Earp on the killing of Curly Bill. Hooker fed them and Wyatt told him he wanted to buy new mounts. Hooker was known for his purebred stallions and ran over 500 brood mares that produced horses that became known for their speed, beauty, and temperament. He provided Wyatt and his posse with new mounts, but refused to take Wyatt's money. When Behan's posse was observed in the distance, Hooker suggested Wyatt make his stand there, but Wyatt moved into the hills about three miles (5km) distant near Reilly Hill.|$|E
5|$|Back at UNITY's headquarters, Cate is congratulated for {{a mission}} well done, and {{everybody}} leaves to grab <b>some</b> <b>rest.</b> Cate {{arrives at a}} graveyard where Bruno was buried to pay her respects. She is then confronted by the supposedly long-dead Tom Goodman, who reveals {{that he is the}} real traitor within UNITY, and a final gun duel ensues. Cate manages to injure Tom and arrest him, but Smith shoots Tom, causing him to fall into a freshly dug grave. Smith then tries to shoot Cate as well, but Jones shoots Smith and reveals that Bruno is still alive. Smith attempts his one last effort to shoot Cate, but Cate kills Smith just in time. With Tom and Smith shot dead, Jones and Bruno decide to tell Cate the truth; Bruno falsified his death so that Cate and the rest of UNITY could find the real traitor. Seven years ago, Smith was taken out of the field by UNITY due to his inadequate fieldwork. In order to sabotage UNITY as a way to avenge himself, Smith joins H.A.R.M. to kill the real Tom Goodman, and replace him with an impostor. When Cate's investigation initially foiled H.A.R.M.'s plan, both Smith and his mole were forced to reveal their true intentions. Cate reacts in shock upon finding out the truth.|$|E

At Tembim the 4th Sikh Infantry rear battalion, took <b>some</b> <b>rest</b> in a cattle shed on the small dock, and sprawled on the ground and in the balcony of a house adjacent to the dock, drank some water, retrieved their tankers and then proceeded to Margão—the administrative centre of Southern Goa—by 12:00.

En route to this target, the column encountered fierce resistance from a 500-strong Portuguese unit at the village of Verna, where the Indian column was joined by the 2nd Bihar. The Portuguese unit surrendered at 15:30 after fierce fighting, and the 4th Sikh then proceeded to Mormugão and Dabolim Airport, where the main body of the Portuguese Army awaited the Indians.|$|E

25|$|The first launch {{attempt was}} delayed by 24 hours due to weather concerns, {{including}} multiple weather violations in NASA's launch rules beginning over 2 {{hours before the}} scheduled launch. During the second attempt on Wednesday morning, {{a problem with a}} LH2 fill-and-drain fuel valve inside Discoverys aft compartment led to another scrubbing. The problem arose when sensors did not detect the closure of the valve when commanded to do so. The issue was thought to be with the sensors rather than the valve itself. After inerting the orbiter's tank, which involved draining it, tests were conducted on the valves. Despite the valves working normally, another delay was called for to have more confidence in the system, and to give the console operators who performed the test <b>some</b> <b>rest.</b> The launch team evaluated the issue, passing on a possible launch window on 27 August 2009 at 01:10 EDT. The launch was delayed until 23:59 EDT, 28 August 2009, to allow the engineers to be fully satisfied with the vehicle. Later the mission was cleared for launch which involved a flight rule waiver for cycling the valve and a discussion to analyze the test failure of an Ares-1 booster that was similar to the SRBs used for the mission. NASA feared another delay when storms formed near the Kennedy Space Center on 28 August 2009, but the weather cleared in time for a successful launch of Discovery at 23:59 EDT.|$|E
