40|$|SCA Obbola AB is a {{kraft pulp}} mill that {{produces}} and sells packaging paper. The steam demand {{is covered by}} a recovery boiler and a <b>solid</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>boiler</b> (consists of two parallel solid fuel furnaces and a boiler). Adjustments in steam production are foremost made by the <b>solid</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>boiler.</b> Previously made energy-reducing measures at the mill has lowered the steam demand which forces the <b>solid</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>boiler</b> to low steam production. The <b>solid</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>boiler</b> produces over 25 GWH/year and is therefor bound by the Swedish nitrous oxide charge, but is also restricted to a monthly mean value of 70 mg/MJ. This mean value was exceeded in July 2016, which {{is thought to be}} a result of forced limitation in steam production. NOx emissions are reduced secondarily by an urea-based SNCR-system where its efficiency depends on several parameters, foremost sufficiently high flue gas temperatures. This work has identified parameters that effects foremost hydrogen-based combustion emission from the <b>solid</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>boiler.</b> This was achieved by evaluating historical data and by conducting tests during operation of the <b>solid</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>boiler,</b> which was planned and evaluated using a software called MODDE. Emission reducing measures and recommended ways to operate the boiler was then presented from the collected data. Practical measures including down-winding supply machinery of secondary air and replacement of urea injection showed no tendencies in reducing NOx emissions. However, complete shut down of one the furnaces produced at least 100 °C higher flue gas temperatures produced from the active furnace. Low NOx emissions was noted when secondary air was supplied from machinery with original speed. therefor, during stretched periods with low steam production, it's recommended that: Only one furnace should be active as steam producer, urea should be injected at its original placement in the flue gas chamber close the furnace and that secondary air should be supplied by machinery with original speed. Comparison test made in this work showed that this way of operating the <b>solid</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>boiler</b> could reduce NOx emissions with 45 % compared to mean NOx emissions at low steam production in July 2016...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a change in}} the Scottish forestry policy from the exogenous to the endogenous development approach, and feasibility of heat entrepreneurship based on locally produced woodfuels in the Highlands of Scotland. The cost structure and heat pricing {{in the case of an}} 800  kW <b>solid</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>boiler</b> is presented, and the profitability of local heat entrepreneurship is analysed with scenarios of different investment costs and fuel prices. The results indicate that a district heating (DH) system, using locally produced woodchips, could produce heat at a lower price than single-house heating systems using light fuel oil. The profitability of replacing existing heating units by investing in a new district heating (DH) scheme is very dependent on the available investment support, price level of woodchips and substituted light fuel oil, and the amount of sold energy. In the case of an 800  kW DH scheme, and woodchip prices of 14 and 22  €/MWh, investments should remain under break-even points of 280 and 420  €/kW of heating power (230, 000 - 335, 000 €). ...|$|E
30|$|There {{are a few}} {{considerations}} that might cause lower efficiency in the dust collection system on boilers. One {{of the reasons is}} the deterioration of a dust collection system. Even properly designed systems from reputable suppliers may show a decrease in performance characteristics due to wear and poor maintenance. In principle, the dust collector is like any other equipment, requiring regular maintenance, servicing, evaluation and testing to ensure its operation is efficient and optimal. Poor awareness among the millers who only focus on maximizing mill productivity and who try to minimize the cost of production, instead of investing in high-efficiency pollution control system and good maintenance practice to protect the environment, is a major concern. The reason might be that there is no return or profit from the investment; it is merely a requirement of the Clean Air Regulation of 1978. Because of this, many mills simply use low-cost dust collectors just to fulfil the basic requirement of having a <b>solid</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>boiler.</b> Furthermore, improper design of dust collection systems, including poor quality control of material, can shorten the lifespan or increase the deterioration rate of a dust collection system, or it might even escalate the problem. For example, putting a wet scrubber instead of dry mechanical cyclone after a biomass boiler might create further problem since wastewater needs an extra wastewater treatment system to prevent water pollution problems.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, the {{influence}} on the system performance of different biomass pretreatment methods before gasification and subsequent production of Fischer-Tropsch crude is considered. Entrained flow gasification at high pressure is a well proven technology for coal as feedstock {{with the benefit of}} producing a practically tar free raw gas with a close to complete carbon conversion. The short residence time in this type of gasifier requires a fuel, which is relatively dry and has a small particle size, to be pressurized from ambient conditions up to 20 - 50 bar. The small particle size can be acquired by grinding but this is highly energy intensive and feeding is challenging. Torrefaction is a thermal pretreatment method carried out at around 300 °C which makes the biomass easier to grind, thus requiring less electricity, and makes the material less fibrous, while on the other hand requiring heat for the process. Pyrolysis is a process carried out at around 500 °C which lets the biomass decompose into a gaseous, a liquid and a solid part. The solid part can be grinded and fed into the gasifier together with the liquid and gaseous phases. This will further facilitate the feeding but with a further increased heat demand compared to torrefaction. The different pretreatment methods and their impact on the overall biorefinery energy system have been studied and evaluated using process integration methodology. The results show that the excess heat from an FT process with a biomass input of 300 MW(HHV) can replace the <b>solid</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>boiler</b> in a large chemical pulp and paper mill. With the preconditions given for this study, thermal pretreatment of the biomass can be beneficial in terms of system thermal efficiency...|$|E
40|$|The {{project is}} made in {{cooperation}} with Lolland municipality, which has set a series of ambitious goals in relation to reducing the CO 2 emissions in the municipality. One of the challenges faced by the municipality in this connection is to achieve a cleaner heat supply. The collective heat supply is almost 100 % CO 2 -neutral, as the district heating plants primarily use CO 2 -neutral fuel. However, {{there are a great}} number of households outside the collective heat supply, which are heated by means of an oil-fired boiler. It is precisely these households that are subject matter for this project. Overall, the project encompasses two levels, namely a technological level and an implementation level. At the technological level, seven different heating technologies that can function as a supplement or an alternative to an oil-fired boiler, which is presupposed to be from 1985, have been selected. Following heating technologies have been selected: Air-to-water heat pump, water-to-water heat pump, <b>solid</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>boiler,</b> wood pellet boiler, solar heating system, biofuel boiler and a new oil-fired boiler. The criteria for the selection have been that these technologies emit less greenhouse gases than an oil-fired boiler from 1985, they are compatible with the systems of heat emission of the houses and they are cost competitive to the current oil-fired boiler. Financial calculations have been carried out for all the heating technologies {{on the basis of the}} annuity principle, as well as calculations of the energy efficiency of the technologies, and calculations of the technologies’ annual emissions of greenhouse gases. These calculations show that the annual costs are lowest when using the air-to-water pump, followed by the <b>solid</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>boiler,</b> solar heat combined with the existing oil-fired boiler, water-to-water pump, wood pellet boiler, the current oil-fired boiler alone, solar heat combined with wood pellet boiler, a new oil-fired boiler and the current oil-fired boiler with a new biofuel boiler. The greenhouse gas emissions are lowest when using the biofuel plants, followed by the air-to-water pump, water-to-water pump, solar heat combined with the existing oil-fired boiler, a new oil-fired boiler and highest when using the current oil-fired boiler alone. On the level of implementation, it will be examined how Lolland municipality can, through strategic communication, optimise their chances in encouraging as many citizens as possible of the individual heat supply to adopt a heating technology that reduces greenhouse gases. Seven individual qualitative interviews have been carried out with citizens of Lolland municipality, which at present warm up their houses by means of an oil-fired boiler. The interviews seek to uncover at which level citizens have set up barriers in relation to an implementation of a cleaner way of heating, but also where there might be any possible incentives. The questions for the interview have been designed on the basis of the classical communication theory “diffusion of Innovations” and a theoretical campaign model, which springs from theory and empirical results from behaviourism and social psychology. The interviews enable a segmentation of the target group and a specification of the factors, which hinder the target group from choosing to implement a heating technology that reduces greenhouse gases. The analysis shows especially that there is a significant lack of knowledge of the existing alternative options to the oil-fired boiler. Furthermore, the citizens do not know where to obtain guidance concerning alternative heating options. The analysis also shows that the target groups place great emphasis on the fact that a heating technology must not be demanding and it must be cheap in relation to the current oil-fired pump. The identified barriers and incentives for the choice of alternative heating technologies of the target groups, as well as their weighting of which heating technologies seem to be attractive, are incorporated in the communication planning, so that the barriers are minimised and incentives maximised. It is recommended that the communication product focuses on implementation of the heating technologies that can contribute in meeting the environmental objectives of the municipality in the best way possible. At the same time, they have to be attractive for the citizens and there will be given instructions on how the municipality should address to the citizens efficiently with this information. In the project’s final recommendations to Lolland municipality, it will be considered how the further work with the communication planning should proceed in order to achieve the best results possible...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to demonstrate an ecological and economic recovery process, which was developed and implemented at Stora Enso Oyj Fine Paper Oulu mill during the period 2000 to 2002. The ECO plant recovers the material called ECO pigment from the effluent treatment sludge and it can be used as a filler in multicoated fine paper production for art printing purposes. The ECO plant process consists of the following process stages. First, there is a separating phase for the recoverable material from fibres and other rejects, which is done with a wire washer. Then the fractionating of the recoverable material is performed with two-stage centrifugal cleaners. Chemical treatment with peracetic acid is used as a preservative and to increase the brightness of the ECO pigment a little. Then the recoverable material is stored in the pigment storage area and dosed to the paper machines as a filler. The rejects from the ECO plant are thickened in belt filter presses and then transferred to the bark storage area, where they are mixed with bark and combusted in a <b>solid</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>boiler.</b> The majority of the particles of the recovered ECO pigment were less than 45 μm; this size of particle accounted for 96. 4 % (on average) according to the studies made between June and December 2002. The use of ECO pigment is not found to cause more web defect problems on the base paper than before, according to the studies of the number of total web defects with the achieved particle size distribution and because the microbe content has been controlled. There are three sources from which the ash content of the base paper is composed after the start-up of the ECO plant, i. e. the broke, the virgin filler and ECO pigment. Therefore the use of ECO pigment partly decreases the need to use virgin filler. The ECO pigment was tested in the coating colour in pilot tests, and based on these results it could be used in the coating colour. The dry solid content of the ECO pigment has to be increased from the present level for the coating application...|$|E
