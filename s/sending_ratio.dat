40|$|AbstractDue to shared {{nature of}} {{wireless}} communication any malicious user can easily monitored communication between two devices and emits false message to block communication. Nowadays {{increased use of}} software defined radio (SDR) technology makes any types of jammer device using same hardware with little modification in software. A jammer transmits radio signal to block legitimate communication either overlapping signal with more power or reducing {{signal to noise ratio}}. In this paper we have survey different jammer detection methods for efficient detection of jammers presence in system. Existing jammer detection methods like packet delivery <b>ratio</b> (PDR), packet <b>send</b> <b>ratio</b> (PSR), bad packet ratio (BPR) and signal to noise ratio (SNR) can effectively detects jammer, here we have proposed novel method for jammer detection using communication parameter used in SDR like synchronization indicator, iteration and adaptive signal to jammer plus noise ratio (ASNJR). This system uses that parameter which is readily available in system so computation has been reduced and ASNJR also has been adaptively updated with and without presence of jammer. Experimental result show that this system based on SDR effectively detects presence of jammer...|$|R
30|$|The {{proposed}} framework uses CH centric (network centric) {{approach for}} detecting jamming in the cluster-based sensor network. In this approach, the CH estimates the metrics PDR and RSSI to make decision about “jammed situation” or “non-jammed situation”. The metrics PDR and RSSI for each node {{under a single}} cluster is implicitly known to the CH, and it is explicitly not necessary for the CH to collect metrics from the CMs. Due to this, processing and decision-making are {{carried out by the}} CH itself without help from the members unlike the existing system. In the existing system, packet <b>send</b> <b>ratio</b> (PSR), PDR, bad packet ratio (BPR), and bit error rate (BER) are termed as jamming induction metrics (JIM), and they are gathered from respective nodes as well as neighbor nodes and are based on the collected JIM where the decision on the presence of jamming is determined. In the proposed system, the identified JIM metrics are PDR and RSSI. PDR and RSSI of CMs are available within the CH itself, and it is not required to collect this metrics elsewhere from the CMs. Therefore, it can be claimed that the CM is not burdened (is not loaded heavily) in the proposed approach.|$|R

30|$|The {{detection}} of jamming {{in the existing}} approaches is node centric or BS centric [7 – 10] where the individual nodes involve in collecting and processing the respective node’s metric and neighbor nodes’ metric such as packet <b>send</b> <b>ratio</b> (PSR) [7], packet delivery ratio (PDR) [7], signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) [8], bad packet ratio (BPR) [8, 9], energy consumption amount (ECA) [9], and bit error rate (BER) [10]. These metrics are used either individually or collectively {{to make the decision}} about “jammed situation” or “non-jammed situation”. Collectively, the metrics PSR, PDR, BPR, and BER are termed as jamming induction metrics (JIM). In the proposed system, the metrics PDR and RSSI are combinely considered to be the JIM metrics. The overhead in the existing approaches are (i) the complete processing and decision-making are done at the node level causing elevated time and space complexity (because collecting, storing, and processing JIM induce additional overhead); (ii) the presence of jamming is not detected precisely, if the node has no neighbor (because node would not have sufficient knowledge of neighbor nodes JIM, to determine the presence of jamming); and (iii) communication overhead (because JIM has to be collected from the neighbor nodes which injects additional traffic into the system). Therefore, a novel jammer detection framework with a nominal overhead and an acceptable detection rate is in need to be devised. This paper addresses this research gap by introducing a three-step novel jammer detection framework. In addition to jammer intrusion detection, jamming detection is also carried out in this paper.|$|R
40|$|Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is a wireless-oriented form of {{communication}} largely used for outdoor applications, such as environmental monitoring and military surveillance. Therefore, a jamming attack {{is one of the}} denial of service attacks (DOS) that may take place by jamming the communication channel, making communication between genuine sensor nodes difficult or even impossible. Several studies have been carried out to develop countermeasures against jamming attacks, utilising parameters such as Packet Delivery <b>Ratio</b> (PDR), Packet <b>Send</b> <b>Ratio</b> (PSR), Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI) and Clear Channel Assessment (CCA). The accuracy of the parameters used is very important for developing successful countermeasures against jamming attacks. Consequently, the focus in this study is to examine the effect of a jamming attack that was generated by one or more wireless sensor network nodes on PDR, PSR and RSSI, and look at the enhancements that can be made on Packet Delivery Ratio by altering the value of CCA on sender nodes. The experiment was performed using XBee RF and K-mote devices configured as jammers by disabling the CSMA protocol. It was performed in a non-isolated room in order to emulate a real-life environment. Two scenarios were carried out in this study. The first scenario aimed to study RSSI, PSR and PDR values with a fixed CCA value, and the second scenario studied the effect of CCA on PDR value. The experiment showed that the RSSI value measured by XBee RF inflated in the presence of noise. This fact has to be considered when RSSI is utilised in jamming attack counter measures. Further, it has been observed that the PDR value is distressed by jamming because genuine packets collide with jammers??? packets and increase the power of the sent packets without considering that the distance will not be enough to enhance the PDR value. This study demonstrates that changing the CCA threshold value on the XBee RF module influences the Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) value in the presence of jamming...|$|R

30|$|In {{battery-powered}} sensor networks, {{the most}} valuable resource is the limited energy available to each sensor. In a scenario where {{the absence of the}} target (null hypothesis) is much more likely than its presence (target hypothesis), an alternative formulation of the decentralized detection problem would allow the sensors to not communicate all the time to the fusion center, and thereby conserve energy. In such a case, the sensors are said to censor their observations by not sending observations that fall within a certain criterion. Rago et al. [2] considered a censoring scheme in which sensors either send or do not send some real-valued function of their observation to a fusion center based on a communication-rate constraint. The work in [2] shows that in the censoring scenario with independent sensors' observations, it is optimal (in both the Bayesian and the Neyman-Pearson (NP) sense) for the sensors to not <b>send</b> their likelihood <b>ratios</b> if they fall in a particular interval and that the optimal censoring region is a single interval of the likelihood ratio.|$|R
