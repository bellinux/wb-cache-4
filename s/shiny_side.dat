25|$|Reverse swing is a {{phenomenon}} that makes the ball swing {{in the opposite direction}} to that usually produced by the orientation of the shiny and rough sides of the ball. When the ball is reverse swinging, the ball will swing towards the <b>shiny</b> <b>side.</b> Balls that reverse swing move much later and much more sharply than those swinging conventionally, both factors increasing the difficulty the batsman will have in trying to hit the ball. At speeds of over 90mph a ball will always exhibit reverse swing, but as roughness increases on the leading side, the speed at which reverse swing occurs decreases. This means that an older ball {{is more likely to be}} delivered with reverse swing as its surface will have been roughened through use.|$|E

50|$|Aluminium foil has a <b>shiny</b> <b>side</b> and a matte side. The <b>shiny</b> <b>side</b> is {{produced}} when the aluminium is rolled {{during the final}} pass. It is difficult to produce rollers with a gap fine enough {{to cope with the}} foil gauge, therefore, for the final pass, two sheets are rolled at the same time, doubling the thickness of the gauge at entry to the rollers. When the sheets are later separated, the inside surface is dull, and the outside surface is shiny. This difference in the finish has led to the perception that favouring a side has an effect when cooking. While many believe (wrongly) that the different properties keep heat out when wrapped with the shiny finish facing out, and keep heat in with the shiny finish facing inwards, the actual difference is imperceptible without instrumentation. Increased reflectivity decreases both absorption and emission of radiation. Foil may have a non-stick coating on only one side. The reflectivity of bright aluminium foil is 88% while dull embossed foil is about 80%.|$|E

50|$|An outswinger is bowled {{by holding}} the cricket ball with the seam {{at an angle}} and the first two fingers running along {{either side of the}} seam.

Once the ball has worn on one side the <b>shiny</b> <b>side</b> should face the leg side and the seam towards first or second slip for swing. The difference of pressure caused by movement of air over the rough and smooth surfaces tends to push the ball to the left. The result is that the ball curves, or swings to the left. In case of a new ball point the seam to the direction of swing. The difference of the separation of air by the seam the ball moves away from the batsman.|$|E
50|$|Crookes {{incorrectly}} {{suggested that}} the force {{was due to the}} pressure of light. This theory was originally supported by James Clerk Maxwell, who had predicted this force. This explanation is still often seen in leaflets packaged with the device. The first experiment to test this theory was done by Arthur Schuster in 1876, who observed that there was a force on the glass bulb of the Crookes radiometer that was in the opposite direction to the rotation of the vanes. This showed that the force turning the vanes was generated inside the radiometer. If light pressure were the cause of the rotation, then the better the vacuum in the bulb, the less air resistance to movement, and the faster the vanes should spin. In 1901, with a better vacuum pump, Pyotr Lebedev showed that in fact, the radiometer only works when there is low pressure gas in the bulb, and the vanes stay motionless in a hard vacuum. Finally, if light pressure were the motive force, the radiometer would spin in the opposite direction, as the photons on the <b>shiny</b> <b>side</b> being reflected would deposit more momentum than on the black side where the photons are absorbed. The actual pressure exerted by light is far too small to move these vanes, but can be measured with devices such as the Nichols radiometer.|$|E
50|$|When {{the ball}} is older {{and there is an}} {{asymmetry}} in roughness the seam no longer causes the pressure difference, and can actually reduce the swing of the ball. Air turbulence is no longer used to create separation point differences and therefore the lift and pressure differences. On the rough side of the ball there are scratches and pits in the ball's surface. These irregularities act {{in the same manner as}} the dimples of a golf ball: they trap the air, creating a layer of trapped air next to the rough side of the ball, which moves with the surface of the ball. The smooth side does not trap a layer of air. The next layer of air outward from the ball will have a greater velocity over the rough side, due to its contact with a layer of trapped air, rather than solid ball. This lowers the static pressure relative to the <b>shiny</b> <b>side,</b> which swings the ball. If the scratches and tears completely cover the rough side of the ball, the separation point on the rough side will move to the back of the ball, further than that of the turbulent air, thereby creating more lift and faster air flow.

If the seam is used to create the turbulent air on the rough side, the tears will not fill as quickly as they would with laminar flow, dampening the lift and pressure differences.|$|E
40|$|Exchange bias in Fe-Nb-B ribbons is investigated. The as-quenched ribbon {{exhibits}} partial crystallinity on both surfaces {{while the}} bulk of ribbon is amorphous. The coexistence of amorphous phase and crystalline alpha-Fe on the ribbon surfaces is confirmed by X-ray diffraction, conversion electron Mossbauer spectroscopy (CEMS), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The crystalline phase can be removed by a short etching in a diluted nitric acid. The properties of the two surfaces are different. A high concentration of the crystallites in a very thin layer at the surface is typical for the wheel side. On the <b>shiny</b> <b>side</b> the crystallites are spread, with the volume fraction about 5 %, in a layer about 1. 5 mu m thick. Whereas the amorphous phase is magnetically soft (Hc ap 3. 5 A/m), the coercive fields of the surface layers, measured by magneto-optic Kerr effect (MOKE), are 0. 8 and 3. 2 kA/m for the wheel and <b>shiny</b> <b>side,</b> respectively. Bulk hysteresis loops of strained ribbons (straight or toroids) are usually asymmetric and shifted with respect to zero magnetic field. It is shown that mainly the surface layer on the <b>shiny</b> <b>side</b> is responsible for this bias effect.

Using molecular weight estimates in the literature for the T 4 and related T 2 chromosomes, and the lengths obtained in the radioautographs, the T 4 chromosome was estimated to have between 1. 9 and 3. 6 nucleotides/ 3. 4 A. On the basis of these values alone, the E. coli and T 4 chromosomes could be either one Watson-Crick helix in a form about equal to or more condensed than the B form, or two helices more stretched out than the B form.
