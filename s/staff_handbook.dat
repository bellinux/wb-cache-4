2500|$|Employees have a {{right to}} {{reasonable}} notice before having their contracts terminated under s.86. At present this means everyone should get a minimum of 1 week's notice before being dismissed if they have worked for the employer for more than a month. After 2 years, the minimum is 2 weeks' notice. [...] After 3 years, 3 weeks' notice, and so on, up to a maximum of twelve weeks' notice. Many employees will have higher notice periods in their contracts, or under the protection of collective agreements established by the workplace union. It {{is important to note that}} these minimum periods are reciprocal - there is a [...] "mutuality of obligation" [...] - and so employees are also required to give such reasonable notice. However nothing prevents employers giving pay in lieu of notice if it is expressly provided for in the employee's contract of employment, <b>staff</b> <b>handbook,</b> or other relevant documents. Both parties can also agree within that period to waive their rights.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The study {{sought to}} explore banking {{employee}} perceptions regarding the promotion of women into top positions {{and the extent to}} which diversity in terms of gender is accommodated and celebrated within the banking sector in Masvingo urban. The study got inspired by the ever changing workforce demographics within banks caused by various legislation on gender mainstreaming and empowerment, resulting in more women venturing into areas often considered sacrosanct and a preserve for men. However, policies and practices remain basically rigid to accommodate such trends. The study focuses primarily on both employee and management perceptions on issues that have to do with gender diversity. The study adopted both qualitative and quantitative research methodologies. Three banks were purposively sampled from a total of eleven. Semi-structured interviews were carried out with seven employees in management while questionnaires were administered to a further twenty six systematically selected clerical and non-clerical employees. Secondary sources like <b>staff</b> <b>handbooks</b> and ethical codes were also reviewed. The study found out that most employees and a part of management mistook diversity management with equal employment opportunities and affirmative action. It also established that while individual differences in terms of gender were not celebrated in most banks, prejudices against women were not exposed and challenged by way of workshops and training. It is recommended that bank policies be reviewed to accommodate the interests of women...|$|R

40|$|The {{integration}} of instruction about academic skills into subject curricula has become widely recognised {{as an effective}} means of teaching students about discipline-specific academic skills; however, integration can achieve much more than this. It can involve the learning developers and discipline teaching team in collaborations that lead to such things as a rethinking of assessment types and assignment tasks, staging of assignment tasks, revision of assignment questions, redevelopment of marking criteria, provision of marking workshops for the teaching team, the development of <b>staff</b> marking <b>handbooks</b> and more specific instruction focussed on learning strategies. When integration involves this amount of redevelopment, increased student learning about disciplinary writing {{is only one of many}} positive outcomes. This paper will report on this kind of collaborative integration at the University of Wollongong, through a number of case studies.

As you are aware, legislation, charters, guidelines, rules and regulations increasingly affect our professional activities. For that reason, we have included in the Handbook policies, regulations and other information that we believe you will find useful.

All appointments to the faculty and unclassified staff are governed by these policies and procedures, in addition to other applicable policies and procedures, rules and regulations of the University and the Kansas Board of Regents. In order to address significant changes in our administrative structure and changes in both internal and external policies, a series of faculty and staff committees have reviewed the handbook and developed this updated Handbook for Faculty and Unclassified Staff which reflects these changes as of October, 2005. This handbook revision was submitted to the Faculty Assembly Steering Committee in the fall of 2005 and was approved by vote of the full faculty on October 24, 2005 and is now in force as of that date.

As aggressive behavior declines, shelter staff perceive higher levels of effectiveness in their work with child residents...|$|R
50|$|The Supreme Court held (Lord Hope, Lady Hale, Lord Wilson and Lord Carnworth in the majority) that Mr Geys's {{contract}} was not automatically terminated with Société Générale's wrongful repudiation. The contract would only end {{if the other}} party elected to accept such a repudiation. If it automatically terminated, this would potentially reward the party who wrongfully repudiated the contract on the termination date it chose. In many cases, provisions of a unilaterally repudiated contract would survive and be enforceable, such as covenants against competition or disciplinary procedure clauses. The <b>staff</b> <b>handbook,</b> s.8.3, made no difference {{to the fact that}} an employee had to be notified of termination. Société Générale had not given clear notice to Geys about the payment. It was only on 6 January, when Geys received Société Générale's letter of 4 January, that the contractual right to terminate under the pay in lieu of notice method was validly exercised. Only then did Gey's employment with Société Générale come to an end.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the readiness of three higher educational institutions in Nigeria {{in their attempt to}} introduce and maintain technology-driven services to students, faculty, and support staff. The prerequisites for participation in the digital, networked economy were investigated. The sample consisted of 74 faculty members, 55 students, and 24 support staff from the three state universities. Self-administered and close-ended questionnaire was developed, pretested and after revision was used to collect primary data. Secondary data were collected from university catalogues, faculty and <b>staff</b> <b>handbook,</b> national and university-based newspapers. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, factor analysis and percentages. The findings reveal that three universities are active in seeking speedy adoption of digital technology and use of Information Communication Technology (ICT). The speed of adoption is slow because of some of the pre-conditions for digital technology are yet to be established. Furthermore, there are no national agency providing well-articulated strategies, financial distress and lack of national technological policy initiative or leadership.

40|$|This study {{seeks to}} {{investigate}} the establishment of efficient and effective written communication in secondary schools and the role that information technology may play in this. In order {{to do this in}} such a wide field the study has focussed on three main types of written communication: the staff noticeboard, the <b>staff</b> <b>handbook</b> and the staff bulletin. As a piece of small-scale research the method chosen for the investigation was that of a double case study using observation and interviews. The results of the investigation point to a tendency for secondary schools to be drawing closer in their communication systems. Whilst the results tend to confirm those of previous studies the research points to correct presentation of the information being crucial to the effectiveness of the communication. Information technology now plays a vital role in the production of written communication but it's potential in being able to instantly transmit written messages to terminals elsewhere and handle data lies untouched. Views established through research into the take-up of information technology in school classrooms and office administration {{do not seem to be}} wholly applicable in schools' written communication. Teachers appear willing to use and adapt to the new technology. The research found that reluctant 'users' circumvented the problem by delegating the productioü of material to others and this explains to an extent the reason for the lack of further development of information technology in this area. The research also clearly pointed to the availability of hardware and expertise to advise in its use as being ultimately more important in information technology than the in-service courses externally provided...|$|E
40|$|Line End is an 11 - 16 {{day school}} for pupils {{categorised}} as having emotional and behavioural difficulties (EBD). It is maintained by Farside Local Education Authority, and provides secondary education for pupils who are statemented as having emotional and behavioural difficulties. Some have additional learning difficulties, this assessment being based on reading ages that are considerably lower than their chronological ages, and scores in KS 2 SATs that are below National averages. All referrals {{come through the}} local authority’s special educational needs department; invariably, the pupils who are placed at Line End either transfer from the EBD primary unit, or {{are those who have}} been excluded from mainstream secondary schools within the borough. The aim of the study is to establish the extent to which Line End is felt to be effective by its various stakeholders; and in establishing this position, it is first important to elicit the criteria by which the various stakeholders judge the school to be effective. The first phase of the study, therefore, is aimed at eliciting these stakeholder criteria, whilst the second phase focuses {{on the extent to which}} the school is perceived to be effective in its various areas of provision, based on these very criteria. A subsequent analysis of findings seeks to examine stakeholder perspectives, and the extent to which there is congruence and/or divergence of perspective amongst and between stakeholders might create conflict or tensions between and amongst stakeholders. Findings from the first phase of the study suggest that there is broad agreement amongst stakeholders about what should constitute effective provision for Line End pupils: addressing both academic and emotional/behavioural needs effectively, providing a safe and positive environment in which to make such provision, and providing opportunities for the reintegration of pupils to mainstream where appropriate and practicable. These three areas reflect the three major aims of the school as outlined in the <b>staff</b> <b>handbook,</b> and alongside these as key indicators of quality, stakeholders included relationships between home and school, and the management/organisation of the school -the extent to which it was strategically or ‘crisis’ managed. Findings from the second phase of the research suggested that the school was perceived to be effective by virtually all of its stakeholders - in some areas for some of the time. There were differences of perspective within stakeholder groups, and sometimes differences of emphasis between stakeholder groups. These differences did not necessarily lead to tension, as it was possible for differing perspectives to co-exist; the tensions became evident when perspectives conflicted rather than co-existed, as the group or individual who held the greatest power would invariably have its way in translating its perspective into policy and practic...|$|E
