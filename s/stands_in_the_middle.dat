5|$|At Vauxhall, Sir Samuel Morland built a fine room, anno 1667, {{the inside}} all of looking-glass, and fountains very {{pleasant}} to behold, {{which is much}} visited by strangers: it <b>stands</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of the garden, covered with Cornish slate, {{on the point of}} which he placed a punchinello, very well carved, which held a dial, but the winds have demolished it.|$|E

5|$|Under Elijah's influence, David {{develops}} what {{he thought}} was an unusual insight into human behavior into an extrasensory perception that enables him to glimpse criminal acts committed by the people who make contact with him. At Elijah's suggestion, David <b>stands</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of a crowd in Philadelphia's 30th Street Station. As various people bump into him, he senses the crimes they perpetrated, such as theft and rape, and finds one he can act on: a sadistic janitor who invades a family home, kills the father, and holds the wife and their two children captive.|$|E

50|$|Racing punters tend to <b>stand</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of <b>the</b> punt, {{because it}} is more {{efficient}} to do so. Indeed, many racing punts have cross braces with canvas covers both fore and aft, so it is only possible to <b>stand</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle.</b> Pleasure punters may like to try punting from <b>the</b> <b>middle,</b> but it is probably advisable to remove the seats and the passengers first.|$|R

5|$|The Duke pursues {{the group}} onto the bridge, setting off mines {{as he tries}} to catch up. With Brain {{navigating}} through the minefield, Snake manages to avoid most of the explosives, but the cab hits a mine and is blown in half, killing Cabbie. As the group flees on foot, Brain is killed when he steps on another mine. Maggie refuses to leave him, and <b>stands</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of the road, shooting at the Duke's car until he runs her down, killing her. Snake and the President reach the perimeter wall and the guards raise the President on a rope. The Duke opens fire on the wall, killing the guards and forcing Snake to dive for cover, but the President shoots the Duke dead. Snake is lifted to safety, and the micro-explosives in his neck are neutralized.|$|E
5|$|Gwyneth <b>stands</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of an {{arch and}} opens the rift, {{allowing}} the Gelth to cross over. The number of Gelth {{is much greater than}} anticipated, and their true motive is revealed: they intend to kill the living to give themselves more hosts and take over the planet. One of the animated bodies strangles Sneed to death, allowing another Gelth to possess his body. Dickens flees the parlour, and Rose and the Doctor are trapped {{in a part of the}} basement. Outside, Dickens realises that the beings are affected by gas and returns to the house. He extinguishes the gaslights and turns the gas on full, pulling the Gelth out of the bodies. The Doctor tells Gwyneth to send the Gelth back and close the rift, but she cannot close it or leave. Instead she takes out a box of matches, intending to ignite the gas and kill the Gelth along with herself. The Doctor determines that Gwyneth is already dead, and that by opening the rift, she had doomed herself. The Doctor, Rose, and Dickens flee the parlour just before it explodes and burns, killing Gwyneth and the Gelth.|$|E
5|$|Praça da República (Republic Square) is {{a public}} square in the centre of town. The plaza, popularly known as Praça da Fruta (Fruit Square), hosts Portugal's only daily outdoor farmers' market. The square is {{surrounded}} by buildings, most containing shops, banks, and cafés on the ground floor. Built 1747–1750 on the northern side of the square, the baroque former city hall (paços do concelho), now used by the junta de freguesia (civil parish council) of the União das Freguesias de Caldas da Rainha — Nossa Senhora do Pópulo, Coto e São Gregório, was declared a property of public interest in 1984. Praça 5 de Outubro (5 October Square), also known as Antiga Praça do Peixe (Old Fish Square), formerly hosted the city's open-air fish market, which has since moved to an indoor location (Mercado do Peixe). The plaza is now used for outdoor café seating and free cultural events. A statue of Queen Leonor <b>stands</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of the roundabout at Largo Conde de Fontalva (Count of Fontalva Square), popularly called Largo da Rainha (Queen's Square).|$|E

25|$|A 19th-century legend {{states that}} while the Bronze Horseman <b>stands</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of Saint Petersburg, enemy forces {{will not be able}} to conquer the city. During the 900-day Siege of Leningrad by the invading Germans during the Second World War (Leningrad being the city's name from 1924–1991), the statue was covered with sandbags and a wooden shelter. Thus {{protected}} it survived 900 days of bombing and artillery virtually untouched. True to the legend, Leningrad was never taken.|$|E
25|$|Sher Shah {{was killed}} on 22 May 1545 during the siege of the Kalinjar fort of Rajputs. When all tactics to subdue this fort failed, Sher Shah ordered {{the walls of the}} fort to be blown up with gunpowder, but he himself was seriously wounded {{as a result of the}} {{explosion}} of a mine. He was succeeded by his son, Jalal Khan, who took the title of Islam Shah Suri. His mausoleum, the Sher Shah Suri Tomb (122ft high), <b>stands</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of an artificial lake at Sasaram, a town on the Grand Trunk Road.|$|E
25|$|In {{spite of}} the tax {{increases}} due to inflation, Kfarsghab seemed to witness a decrease in its population between 1519 and 1571 of -3 per mil / year. This decrease is attributed to the economic difficulties of the 16th century in the Middle East, {{but also to the}} struggle between Maronites and Jacobites. Kfarsghab <b>stands</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of four historical centers of Jacobites in the region: Bqoufa, Bane, Hadshit and Bsharri. It is supposed that some Jacobites lived in Kfarsghab and had to flee the region after they lost the support of Bsharri's Muqaddams around 1550. Both censuses show that Kfarsghab was inhabited by Christians - but with no distinction between Jacobites and Maronites.|$|E

25|$|Between 1962 and 1998 Mayagüez {{was a major}} tuna canning and {{processing}} center. At one time, 80% of all tuna products consumed in the United States were packed in Mayagüez (the biggest employer, StarKist, had 11,000 employees working three daily shifts in the local plant's heyday). Mayagüez was also a major textile industry hub; {{almost a quarter of}} all drill uniforms used by the United States Army were sewn in the city. Today, Mayagüez is the fifth-largest city and {{is considered one of the}} most important cities in the island. The city is centered on the impressive Spanish-style Plaza Colón, a tribute to Christopher Columbus, whose stature <b>stands</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of the square, surrounded by 16 bronze statues.|$|E
25|$|The {{other side}} of the Grosvenor Bridge is the Roodee, Chester's race course and the oldest course in the country. This used to be the site of Chester's Roman harbour until, aided by the {{building}} of the weir, the River Dee silted up to become the size it is today. The only curiously remaining reminder of this site's maritime past is a stone cross which <b>stands</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of the Roodee which exhibits the marks of water ripples. To the end of the Roodee the river is crossed by Chester's fourth bridge which carries the North Wales Coast railway line, before leaving Chester. This was the scene of one of the first serious railway accidents in the country, the Dee bridge disaster.|$|E
25|$|Existing {{already in}} the 18th century, the Ljubljana central square, the Prešeren Square's modern {{appearance}} has developed {{since the end of}} the 19th century. After the 1895 earthquake, Max Fabiani designed the square as the hub of four streets and four banks, and in the 1980s, Edvard Ravnikar proposed the circular design and the granite block pavement. A statue of the Slovene national poet France Prešeren with a muse <b>stands</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of the square. The Prešeren Monument was created by Ivan Zajec in 1905, whereas the pedestal was designed by Max Fabiani. The square and surroundings have been closed to traffic since 1 September 2007. Only a tourist train leaves Prešeren Square every day, transporting tourists to Ljubljana Castle.|$|E
