5|$|Australia fell to {{successive}} defeats in {{the opening}} two Tests, Bradman making two ducks in his four innings, and it <b>seemed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> captaincy was affecting his form. The selectors made another four changes to the team for the Third Test at Melbourne.|$|E
5|$|In early 1926, {{the general}} was again named Premier, and {{approached}} the PNR and its close ally, the Peasants' Party, proposing a merger around his leadership. This met with a stiff refusal, as it <b>seemed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> two were about to win the elections with additional support, but the king, suspicious of the left-wing credentials of the Peasants' Party, used his Royal Prerogative and nominated Averescu as premier (with PNL support).|$|E
5|$|Klaipėda (German: Memel), an {{important}} seaport in East Prussia, was detached from Germany by Article 28 of the Treaty of Versailles and was {{governed by the}} Allies according to Article 99. France assumed administration of the region while Lithuania continued to lobby for its control, claiming that it should belong to Lithuania as it had a significant Lithuanian population (see Lithuania Minor) and was that country's only access to the Baltic Sea. Poland also laid claim to the territory. As the Allies were hesitant {{to make a decision}} and it <b>seemed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> region would remain a free state much like the Free City of Danzig, Lithuania took the initiative and organized the Klaipėda Revolt in January 1923. Soviet Russia and Germany supported the action. The region, as an autonomous territory with its own parliament (Klaipėda Parliament), was attached to Lithuania. The region covered about 2,400km² and had a population of approximately 140,000.|$|E

5|$|Reviewers {{praised the}} co-op mode highly but many disliked the single-player mode. Danielle Riendeau (Polygon) liked Monacos {{gameplay}} stating {{that it was}} fun with other people, but it <b>seemed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> single-player mode needed work. James Murff (GameFront) said the co-op was ridiculously fun and has good replayability. Marty Sliva (IGN) said that Monaco provided {{one of the best}} co-op experiences he'd had in a while. He stated that due to the gameplay and mechanics, {{it was one of the}} most unique and addictive games released in 2013. Scott Nichols (Digital Spy) said that the game contains lots to discover, but is best done cooperatively. Jeff Grubb (VentureBeat) praised the fact that the game works as both an arcade and a strategic game but said to skip it if the user wasn't planning on playing it cooperatively. Roger Hargreaves (Metro) liked the multiplayer mode more, but also praised the single-player mode calling it surprisingly compelling.|$|E
5|$|The 1974 {{series in}} the West Indies was of five Tests. The West Indian team were {{regarded}} as the better side, and for them to only draw the series was a surprise. After they won the first Test it had <b>seemed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> series would become a one-sided contest. This Test was notable for a controversial Alvin Kallicharran run out that triggered protests. England managed to secure draws {{in the next three}} Tests, thanks to Dennis Amiss' 262 in the second Test and Keith Fletcher's 129 in the third, while rain prevented a result in the fourth Test. The last match at Queen's Park Oval was a close game, with England winning by 26 runs, primarily due to Tony Greig taking 13 wickets bowling off-spin and Boycott scoring 212 runs in the match. England thereby levelled the series, which finished 1–1.|$|E
5|$|As late as 13:35 the German 352nd {{division}} was {{reporting that the}} assault had been hurled back into the sea. From the German vantage point at Pointe de la Percée, overlooking the whole beach from the western end, it <b>seemed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> assault had been stopped at the beach. An officer there noted that troops were seeking cover behind obstacles, and counted ten tanks burning. By 07:35, the third battalion of the 726th Grenadier Regiment, defending Draw F-1 on Fox Green beach, was reporting that 100–200 American troops had penetrated the front, with troops inside the wire at WN-62 and WN-61 attacking the Germans from the rear. Casualties among the defenders were mounting. While the 916th regiment, defending {{the center of the}} 352nd zone, was reporting that the landings had been frustrated, it was also requesting reinforcements. The request could not be met, because the situation elsewhere in Normandy was becoming more urgent for the defenders. The reserve regiment, the 915th of the 352nd division, which had earlier been ordered against the American airborne landings to the west of Omaha, was diverted to the Gold zone east of Omaha, the defenses there having crumbled.|$|E

5|$|During {{the day the}} Fusiliers again {{assaulted}} Hill 217 {{from the}} south, and attempted {{to work their way}} around the eastern and western flanks of the feature. Despite preparation by the divisional artillery and the 3 RAR Machine Gun Platoon firing their Vickers medium machine-guns in support from Maryang San, the Fusiliers were unable to make progress due to Chinese machine-guns located in bunkers {{at the top of their}} objective. Meanwhile, their flanking movements were also blocked by Chinese small arms and grenades. 1 RNF had now taken over 100 casualties during two days of fighting and by the afternoon they were a spent force. Sensing the Fusiliers' weakness, the Chinese then launched their own assault, forcing them to withdraw in contact. Previous plans for an assault on the Hinge had not occurred due to issues with resupply and the dangerous approach march that would have been required. Again, despite their efforts, the Fusiliers had failed to capture their objective. It <b>seemed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> only way to finally secure Hill 217 was along the ridge from Hill 317, via the Hinge, and as such the Australians would be tasked with capturing the Hinge the following day. B Company was subsequently allocated the attack. In preparation, they ascended Hill 317 late in the afternoon of 6 October, finally securing the crest, and at last light joined 9 Platoon on the knoll northwest of the summit where they would form up the next day to conduct the assault.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} hours of 7 October the allied {{artillery}} and mortar bombardment began, targeting Chinese positions on the Hinge. Hassett moved the 3 RAR tactical headquarters on to Hill 317 just before the assaulting troops stepped off the line of departure, allowing him to direct the battle from a forward position and to co-ordinate fire support. Waiting for the fog to lift so that the artillery could fire until the last safe moment, the attack finally began at 08:00. B Company moved off down the ridgeline, with two-up and one-in-depth, using the trees and long grass for concealment. Initially it <b>seemed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Chinese had withdrawn during the night, when suddenly the lead Australian platoons were engulfed by small arms fire from their rear. A series of intense fire-fights ensued as the Australians fought back and by 09:20 the Hinge finally fell, with the Australians losing two killed and 20 wounded. Chinese casualties included more than 20 killed. As a result of the fighting Captain Henry Nicholls and Lieutenant Jim Hughes were awarded the Military Cross, while Corporal J. Park and Corporal E.F. Bosworth were awarded the Military Medal. Yet even as the surviving Chinese withdrew, artillery and mortar fire began to fall on the Hinge. B Company moved quickly to consolidate the position, but were hampered by the shelling, while they now faced a pressing shortage of ammunition and difficulties evacuating their casualties.|$|E
5|$|When {{seeking to}} explain this change in the {{complexity}} and style of castles, antiquarians found their answer in the Crusades. It <b>seemed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Crusaders had learned much about fortification from their conflicts with the Saracens and exposure to Byzantine architecture. There were legends {{such as that of}} Lalys– an architect from Palestine who reputedly went to Wales after the Crusades and greatly enhanced the castles in the south of the country– and it was assumed that great architects such as James of Saint George originated in the East. In the mid-20thcentury this view was cast into doubt. Legends were discredited, {{and in the case of}} James of Saint George it was proven that he came from Saint-Georges-d'Espéranche, in France. If the innovations in fortification had derived from the East, it would have been expected for their influence to be seen from 1100 onwards, immediately after the Christians were victorious in the First Crusade (1096–1099), rather than nearly 100years later. Remains of Roman structures in Western Europe were still standing in many places, some of which had flanking round-towers and entrances between two flanking towers.|$|E
