40|$|Abstract. This work {{examines}} <b>circulatory</b> <b>patterns</b> of {{air pollutants}} {{in the area}} of Barcelona (Spain), a region with strong coastal and orographic influences. This was achieved through exploitation of elastic-backscatter lidar data and by numerical simulation of the atmosphere with a meteorological mesoscale model (MEMO). Lidar data were acquired in July 1992 during a collaborative campaign between Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) and the Polytechnic University of Catalonia (UPC). The lidar provided information about the distribution of aerosols and the prevailing winds, determined by application of a maximum cross-correlation algorithm to elastic-backscatter lidar data. Lidar winds are used to evaluate high altitude winds simulated by the model. This study showed that <b>circulatory</b> <b>patterns</b> in Barcelona are correlated with daytime convective vertical mixing, sea-breeze circulations, and vertical forcing caused by mountain thermal and mechanical effects...|$|R

According to standards {{given by the}} American Veterinary Medical Association there are no current methods of euthanizing lobsters, nor are there effective methods of quick release anesthesia. The objective of this research demonstrated that eugenol by direct injection is a safe, efficient and reliable method for euthanizing or anesthetizing crustaceans. Anesthetic levels were determined by behavior responses, death was determined {{by a lack of}} response to stimuli.

5|$|Water vapor {{generated}} through {{surface evaporation}} is transported by <b>circulatory</b> <b>patterns</b> in the atmosphere. When atmospheric conditions permit an uplift of warm, humid air, this water condenses and {{falls to the}} surface as precipitation. Most of the water is then transported to lower elevations by river systems and usually returned to the oceans or deposited into lakes. This water cycle is a vital mechanism for supporting life on land and is a primary factor in the erosion of surface features over geological periods. Precipitation patterns vary widely, ranging from several meters of water per year to less than a millimeter. Atmospheric circulation, topographic features, and temperature differences determine the average precipitation that falls in each region.|$|R

40|$|Crustaceans, indeed {{arthropods}} generally, {{have an open}} {{circulatory system}} that can be loosely defined as a blood vascular {{system in which the}} circulating fluid (hæmolymph) passes, at some point, through tissues directly, i. e. in passages unbounded by endothelial walls. Within this definition, however, we find a very wide range of <b>circulatory</b> <b>patterns</b> ranging from exceedingly simple, i. e. no vessels present, as in some copepods or in the naupliar larval stages of the Decapoda (McMahon et al., 1995) to the extremely complex distribution systems seen in adult decapod crustaceans (Fig. 1). This review considers the unifying factors that control the flow of hæmolymph through blood vascular systems and the roles that these factors have played in the evolution of crustacean blood vascular systems. The review will focus on the control of blood flow through the vascular syste...|$|R
40|$|Ex vivo hemoperfused pancreaticoduodenal {{preparations}} from {{dogs have}} been used to study intraluminal and <b>circulatory</b> <b>patterns</b> of release of immunoreactive gastrin under basal conditions and after secretin stimulation. Bidirectional release of immunoreactive gastrin was maximal at 3 U/min secretin infusion, and release into pancreatic and duodenal juice exceeded that into portal venous blood. Molecular sieving chromatography of peptides with gastrin-like immunoreactivity recovered from duodenal and pancreatic juice indicated a single species of a molecular size equivalent to CCK 8 and smaller than minigastrin (G- 14). The exact identity has not been defined. This study demonstrates that secretin stimulates release of gastrin-like peptides into blood and lumen of extra-antral gastrin-producing tissues in the dog. Unidirectional gastrin release patterns from gastrinoma tissue may explain the paradoxical increase in plasma gastrin levels in response to secretin in patients with gastrinomas (Zollinger-Ellison syndrome) ...|$|R
40|$|Seventeen {{patients}} with hemodynamic instability from acute cerebrovascular accidents were evaluated shortly after {{arrival at the}} emergency department of a university-run county hospital with both invasive Swan-Ganz pulmonary artery catheter placement and a new, noninvasive, thoracic electrical bioimpedance device. Values were recorded and temporal patterns of survivors and nonsurvivors were described. Cardiac indices obtained simultaneously by the 2 techniques were compared. Of the 17 patients, 11 (65 %) died. Survivors had higher values than nonsurvivors for mean arterial pressure, cardiac index, and oxygen saturation, delivery, and consumption at comparable times. Cardiac index values, as measured by invasive and noninvasive methods, were correlated. We concluded that hemodynamic monitoring in an acute care setting may recognize temporal <b>circulatory</b> <b>patterns</b> associated with outcome. Noninvasive electrical bioimpedance technology offers a new method for early hemodynamic evaluation. Further {{research in this area}} is warranted...|$|R

40|$|Oceanographic fronts are {{the sites}} of {{enhanced}} physical and biological activity, including locally con-centrated feeding by marine birds. Two general hypotheses relating marine birds to fronts have been developed. The first is that enhanced primary production at fronts increases prey supply through increased animal growth, reproduction, or immigration. The second is that prey patches develop at fronts either through behavioural responses of prey to thermal or salinity gradients, or through interaction between prey behaviour and <b>circulatory</b> <b>patterns.</b> Several recent studies support the second hypothesis. The first hypothesis, that birds benefit from enhanced primary production at fronts, {{has yet to be}} evaluated. We need a better understanding of trophic mechanisms at fronts in order to determine (1) the proportion of daily energy requirements extracted by predators at fronts; (2) the proportion of natural mortality of prey populations at fronts; and (3) the probability of contact between seabirds and point source pollutants...|$|R
40|$|The {{behavior}} {{of white and}} red blood cells, platelets, and circulating injected particles {{is one of the}} most studied areas of physiology. Most methods used to analyze the <b>circulatory</b> <b>patterns</b> of cells are time consuming. We describe a system named CellTrack, designed for fully automated tracking of circulating cells and micro-particles and retrieval of their behavioral characteristics. The task of automated blood cell tracking in vessels from in vivo video is particularly challenging because of the blood cells’ nonrigid shapes, the instability inherent in in vivo videos, the abundance of moving objects and their frequent superposition. To tackle this, the CellTrack system operates on two levels: first, a global processing module extracts vessel borders and center lines based on color and temporal patterns. This enables the computation of the approximate direction of the blood flow in each vessel. Second, a local processing module extracts the location...|$|R
40|$|Satellite imagery {{from two}} EREP passes over the Rappahannock Estuary of the Chesapeake region is {{analyzed}} to chart colored water types, to delineate color boundaries and define <b>circulatory</b> <b>patterns.</b> Surface observations from boats and helicopters concurrent with Skylab overpass define the distributions of suspended sediment, transparency, temperature, salinity, phytoplankton, color of suspended material and optical ratio. Important features {{recorded by the}} imagery are a large-scale turbidity maximum and massive red tide blooms. Water movement is revealed by small-scale mixing patterns and tidal plumes of apparent sediment-laden water.

Analyses of red, green and natural color photos by microdensitometry demonstrate the utility of charting water color types of potential use for managing estuarine water quality.

Thymic lobules showed a "through circulation" [...] capillaries penetrating the cortex from within outwards and draining into surface veins, comparable with the circulation in liver lobules. By contrast, lymph nodes and Peyer's patches showed a looped capillary distribution. The outer thymic cortex and primary follicles in lymph nodes contained the maximum capillary density, correlating with the highest mitotic index of thymocytes and lymphocytes in the respective tissues. The lowest vascular density in the thymus was in the medulla, particularly in Hassall's corpuscles, in secondary follicles of lympho nodes and Peyer's patches, which correlates with the storage capacity of antigens and antibodies at those sites. Postcapillary venules in lymph nodes and Peyer's patches showed a characteristic pattern with Indian ink. These venules were absent from the thymus...|$|R
40|$|Objective Fetal liver {{blood supply}} is an {{important}} determinant of fetal growth and adaptation. Most fetal liver blood supply is from the umbilical vein, but the portal vein contributes 14 - 20 % and studies of low-risk pregnancies suggest the splanchnic arteries are also involved in the homeostasis of fetal liver perfusion. Here we determine the <b>circulatory</b> <b>pattern</b> of the fetal liver in intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). Design. Cross-sectional study. Population. Thirty-one IUGR fetuses (estimated fetal weight 97. 5 centile and 13 showed a middle cerebral artery brain-sparing pattern (PI Z-score < - 2). In IUGR, umbilical venous flow was lower and less umbilical blood was distributed to the right liver lobe, while the umbilico-caval pressure gradient was kept normal. The hepatic and splenic arteries, but not the superior mesenteric artery, had low PI compared with the reference population. Conclusions IUGR fetuses with increased or normal umbilical artery PI maintained venous perfusion pressure to the liver while distributing less umbilical blood to the right liver lobe. They showed regional splanchnic arterial redistribution with low splenic and hepatic artery PI, implying increased portal venous flow and direct arterial contribution to hepatic perfusion, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Naples is a {{large city}} located between two active {{volcanic}} areas: Campi Flegrei to theWand Vesuvius to the SE. The Solfatara crater, inside the caldera of the Campi Flegrei and nearest to the western quarters of the city, is a prodigious source of natural CO 2 with a mean emission rate of 1067 ton/d, i. e. seven times {{higher than that of}} Vesuvius(151 ton/d). This study shows that the area around the Solfatara and part of the urban area of Naples are affected by the volcanic plume when atmospheric <b>circulatory</b> <b>patterns</b> are dominated by the locally frequent sea breezes. Under these conditions the CO 2 content in the air increases above normal values, reaching more than 1000 ppm in proximity to the Solfatara crater to a few tens of ppm several kilometres from the source. Although these values do not indicate a health risk even under the most unfavourable atmospheric conditions, the volcanic source contributes to the total CO 2 burden from all urban emissions and hence to overall air quality. An emission rate ten times higher than the present one would lead to an air CO 2 concentration in excess of recommended health protection thresholds...|$|R
40|$|Immunoglobulins {{are first}} {{synthesized}} as antigen receptors {{integrated into the}} plasma membrane of resting B cells, and, subsequently, as soluble receptors secreted by mature plasma cells. Although these forms, when derived from a single B cell clone, share variable (V) regions (1, 2), their heavy-chain constant (CH) regions are otherwise functionally and topologically distinct. Recent investigations in both the human and murine systems have demonstrated that the heavy chain of membrane IgM ~m) and the heavy chain of secretory IgM (,us) are distinct from one another by a divergence in primary structure at the C terminus (3 - 7). The predominance of IgA in external glandular secretions (8) has focused previous attention to the secretory heavy chain of this class. Two distinct human subclasses have been identified (9). The major serum form (IgA 1) has been shown by amino acid-sequence analysis to have a hinge region not found in any other Ig class, including IgA 2 (10). As dimers in a complex with J chain (11), both subclasses interact with secretory component (12), and are thereby transported across glandular epithelia (13).

40|$|The {{findings}} of research work showed that animals with hyperluteinized ovaries (HL) obtained after mechanical lesions in the posterior hypothalamus, the <b>circulatory</b> <b>patterns</b> of pituitary and ovarian steroid hormones were disturbed. In these animals the pre-ovulatory surge of luteinizing hormone (LH) was lower and prolactin (Prl) was higher, while in early proestrus estradiol was higher, and progesterone in late proestrus was lower {{when compared to}} the intact controls. It is recognized that there is a close relationship between ovarian function and thyroid hormones, measured the serum content of total tri-iodothyronine (T 3) and thyroxine (T 4) in animals with hyperluteinized ovaries obtained after mechanical lesions in the posterior hypothalamus. There were no a significant differences in the circulatory concentrations of these hormones between rats with HL and intact controls. Histological analysis also showed that {{there were no significant differences}} in structure of thyroids between the two groups of animals, although the weights of the thyroid glands in the lesioned animals were significantly heavier than in intact controls. These results showed that lesions in the posterior hypothalamus, which result in a disturbance of the hypothalamo-pituitary-ovarian axis inducing HL, did not bring about changes in the hypothalamo-pituitary-thyroid axis...|$|R
50|$|The Anatolian Plate, {{together}} with the Aegean-Peloponnesus block, is located near the centre of a very wide region, including the Arabian Plate with the adjacent Zagros Mountains and central Iran, that moves in a <b>circulatory</b> <b>pattern</b> at a relatively fast rate of 20 mm/yr. The rate of this counter-clockwise motion increases near the Hellenic Trench system south of Turkey and decreases away from it (i.e. the Eurasian and African plates move {{at a rate of}} 5 mm/yr), resulting in internal deformations in several areas, including central and eastern Anatolia, south-western Aegean-Peloponnesus, Lesser Caucasus, and central Iran. The dominant process in the region is the subduction of the African Plate beneath the Hellenic Trench, and the deformation in the entire African-Arabian-Eurasian collision zone is most likely driven by the slab roll-back of the subducting African Plate in the East Mediterranean. This process is further fuelled by slab-pull forces in the Makran Trench in the Gulf of Oman where the Arabian Plate is subducting under Eurasia. A response to this tectonic maelstrom is the rifting in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden which will separate Arabia from Africa.|$|R
40|$|The {{analysis}} of dune-like morphologies on the Gulf of Cadiz continental shelf, using high-resolution seismic reflection profiles and sediment samples, reveals a well-defined distribution pattern {{controlled by the}} area’s hydrodynamics. These bedforms {{are considered to be}} modern features from the Holocene, and therefore they provide information about the bottom <b>circulatory</b> <b>patterns</b> established over the continental shelf. Most of the submarine dunes have been identified over a shallow physiographic feature named the Barbate High. The current flows that generate the bedform fields can be attributed to a complex interaction of several hydrodynamic agents, in which the process of current direction reversal related to the tidal cycle in the Straits of Gibraltar seems to be involved. Eastward-oriented submarine dunes located on the onshore zones of the inner shelf are generated by the Atlantic inflow, which over these shallow zones is mainly orientated towards the east during high-tide conditions in the Straits of Gibraltar. Bedforms oriented westwards and west–northwestwards in the offshore zones indicate that a previously undescribed flow occurs on the Gulf of Cadiz continental shelf. This flow is attributed to the influence of ebb tidal currents, which move preferentially towards the west over these zones. As a result of this complex bottom flo...|$|R

To investigate the cerebral hemodynamic changes associated with brain herniation syndrome due to traumatic brain swelling. Methods. Nineteen head-injured patients {{with evidence of}} refractory intracranial hypertension and transtentorial herniation were prospectively studied. Cerebral hemodynamic assessment by transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasonography was performed prior to decompressive craniectomy.

40|$|AbstractThis {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to examine the}} relationship between circulating matrix metalloproteinase (MMP- 9) and tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase (TIMP- 1) in our patients with either advanced small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) or non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) prior to treatment. Thirty-one male and female patients with either stage III or IV NSCLC and 17 with either stage III or IV SCLC were compared to 117 age matched non-smoking controls of both sexes. Prior to any treatment of the patient, a baseline serum sample was obtained from each of the patients for the determination of circulating MMP- 9 and TIMP- 1 by ELISA. The results indicate that both MMP- 9 and TIMP- 1 are elevated in the serum of lung cancer patients when compared to the controls. This observation was true for both SCLC and NSCLC. However, the mean values for both MMP- 9 and TIMP- 1 in the two tumors were not different from each other. The natural physiological relationship between MMP- 9 and the inhibitor TIMP- 1 was lost in both SCLC and NSCLC, indicative of abnormal alterations by the tumor. The data from this study suggests that advanced lung cancer does alter the normal <b>circulatory</b> <b>pattern</b> of MMP- 9 and TIMP- 1.

40|$|The <b>circulatory</b> <b>pattern</b> in the gastric mucosa {{of the rat}} and {{relationships}} of mucosal capillaries to gastric gland cells were investigated. Techniques used included the vascular corrosion cast/scanning electron microscope method, scanning electron microscopy of acid-digested tissues, conventional transmission electron microscopy and in vivo light microscopy. Arterial break-up into capillaries invariably occurs {{around the base of}} the gastric glands. The mucosal capillaries are fenestrated and vesiculated, and pass in close proximity to the abluminal aspects of the cells of the gastric glands, particularly the parietal cells. At the apices of the glands, the capillaries form a honeycomb network closely applied to the abluminal aspect of the surface epithelial cells, before draining into infrequent venules which are embedded in a substantial connective tissue sheath. No capillary drainage occurs into these venules deeper in the mucosa. No evidence of either mucosal or submucosal arteriovenous anastomoses was found. Because of the close proximity of the fenestrated mucosal capillaries to the parietal cells and surface epithelial cells and the direction of capillary blood flow, the alkaline tide of the actively secreting parietal cell must be transferred to the abluminal aspect of the surface epithelial cells. The capacity of these cells to secrete HCO 3 - or to neutralize back diffusing H+ ions would thereby be increased...|$|R

A head-up tilt test (HUTT) was performed before and after HDBR. Our data revealed that, in all nonfainters, there was a progressive increase in heart rate over the course of HDBR, which remained higher until 12 days of recovery.

40|$|Reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus) {{inhabit the}} Arctic and have evolved adaptions {{to meet the}} climatic {{challenges}} in this region. Peripheral heterothermia, which is a heat conserving mechanism in homeotherms during cold exposure, is well documented in the reindeer and manifests itself in tissue temperatures in the extremities well below 10 °C. It is, however, unknown whether peripheral heteothermia in reindeer requires efficient vascular counter-current heat exchange, or is simply a result of reduced {{blood flow to the}} extremities. Vascular corrosion casts, x-ray pictures, dissections and electron microscopy did not reveal any counter-current rete in the front legs, but the vascular anatomy, with arteria brachialis and vena brachialis running in intimate contact with each other for the full length of the leg, still seems to allow quite efficient counter-current heat exchange. Recordings of brachial blood flow and subcutaneous temperature (Tsc) in the front legs of winter insulated reindeer subjected to ambient temperatures (Ta) of 20 °C, - 10 °C and - 30 ° suggest that the initial drop in Tsc seen in reindeer when exposed to moderate cold (- 10 °C) is primarily the result of use of a <b>circulatory</b> <b>pattern</b> enabling counter-current heat exchange, while decreasing blood flow appears to be a secondary mechanism when Ta falls further towards - 30 °C...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} a cloned T-cell line on the in vivo growth of syngeneic {{lymphoma}} cells was studied. 1 E 4 is an H- 2 -restricted cytotoxic T-cell clone that efficiently kills Abelson virus-induced lymphoma target cells (L 1 - 2) at low effector/target ratios, as measured by in vitro cytotoxicity assays. In addition, it is long lived in vitro {{in the absence of}} stimulation and survives for more than 1 wk in vivo in the absence of exogenous antigen or growth factors. Mice injected intraperitoneally with lethal doses of L 1 - 2 and then treated with 1 E 4 survived longer than animals treated with saline or with a control T-cell clone. Multiple weekly injections of effector cells, or a single injection in animals given a low dose of tumor cells, resulted in 50 - 80 % long-term survivors. The observation that intravenous injection of killer cells was less effective than intraperitoneal treatment, coupled with the previous demonstration of markedly abnormal <b>circulatory</b> <b>patterns</b> for T-cell clones, suggests that those animals succumbing to progressively growing neoplasm die because the effector cells are unable to home into peripheral sites of tumor deposition.

40|$|BACKGROUND How {{much of the}} {{hypotension}} occurring during postural syncope is cardiac output-mediated and {{how much}} can be ascribed to a fall in systemic vascular resistance are unknown. The contribution of both determinants {{may be influenced by}} the use of vasoactive drugs. OBJECTIVE The {{purpose of this study was}} to assess the determinants of hypotension during drug-free and nitroglycerine (NTG) -induced vasovagal presyncope in routine tilt table testing. METHODS In this retrospective study, a total of 56 patients (37 female; age 36 +/- 19 years) with suspected vasovagal syncope and a positive tilt test at two clinical centers were selected. In 29 patients, presyncope was provoked by 0. 4 mg sublingual NTG, administered in the 60 degrees head-up tilt position. In the other 27 patients, presyncope was provoked by passive tilt alone. Finger arterial pressure was monitored continuously, and left ventricular stroke volume was computed from pressure pulsations. RESULTS After NTG administration, heart rate rose, and peak heart rate was similar in all patients. Use of NTG did not affect <b>circulatory</b> <b>patterns</b> precipitating a vasovagal response. On average in all patients, marked hypotension was mediated by an approximately 50 % fall in cardiac output, whereas systemic vascular resistance was well maintained until presyncope. CONCLUSION Hypotension during routine tilt testing is cardiac output-mediated, and the mechanism appears independent of the use of 0. 4 mg sublingual NTG. The study data challenge the conventional idea of systemic vasodilation as the overriding cause of hypotension during postural syncop...|$|R

In addition to land-use changes, climate warming may threat this ecosystem by altering their health, favoring the recruitment over the treeline where is not adapted, and affecting its dynamics, growth rates, and ecological relationships with associated species. Given the dendrochronological potential of hartwegii pine to produce centuries-long time series useful to analyze high and low frequency climate variability, and influence of atmospheric <b>circulatory</b> <b>patterns,</b> {{the objective of this}} study was to develop a network of treering chronologies for central and northeastern Mexico, analyze its potential for dendroclimatic reconstructions and to determine the potential impact and teleconnections of atmospheric <b>circulatory</b> <b>patterns.</b> Nine ring-width series of hartwegii pine were developed for the upper conifer forest of some of the main volcanic peaks in the Valley of Mexico and two more series were produced from trees located at the highest peaks in the Sierra Madre Oriental. A Principal Component Analysis of the chronologies defined two eigenvectors with the highest climate variability, the first component integrated several chronologies from central Mexico, e. g., Nevado de Colima, Pico de Orizaba, Iztaccihuatl, and la Malinche, and the second component from northeastern Mexico included Cerro Potosí, N. L. and Cerro La Viga, Coahuila. The chronologies with a common climate response were integrated into representative regional ring-width series, one of them was the chronology for the Transmexican Volcanic Belt with 320 years length (1690 - 2009), whereas the one for the northeastern region covered the last 590 years (1420 - 2009). The regional chronology for central Mexico indicated below normal growth (3 ̆c 1. 0) as related to droughts for the periods 1698 - 1702, 1716 - 1720, 1746 - 1760, 1806 - 1813, 1841 - 1859, 1890 - 1894, 1935 - 1940, 1970 - 1979, and 2000 - 2004. Similarly, below normal growth for the northeastern ring-width series took place in periods 1450 - 1460, 1508 - 1538, 1565 - 1576, 1661 - 1673, 1696 - 1705, 1757 - 1765, 1784 - 1790, 1804 - 1808, 1844 - 1849, 1866 - 1894, 1915 - 1933, and 1998 - 2003. Wet episodes (3 ̆e 1. 0) were common in both representative series for the periods 1726 to 1728, 1753 to 1755, 1791 to 1797, 1831 to 1837, 1895 to 1914, 1923 to 1926, 1940 to 1941, 1957 to 1958, 1965 to 1969, 1985 to 1987, and 2001 to 2005. Verification of some of the detected droughts was done by comparisons with historical records of grain yields, colonial rogation ceremony records, dendroclimatic reconstructions, instrumental climate data, and climatic indices (Palmer Drought Severity Index, Southern Oscillation Index, Tropical Rainfall Index). Contrasting the regional ring-width indices for the common period (1690 - 2009) did not show a significant association (r= 0. 087, p 3 ̆c 0. 05), however, both regional dendrochronological series responded to dry and wet episodes for particular years and showed opposite conditions (dipole) for some other years (i. e., wet in the center, dry in the north, and vice versa). This finding indicates that the chronologies responded mostly to local or regional climatic conditions but in certain periods may have been impacted by <b>circulatory</b> <b>patterns</b> affecting larger areas in northern and central Mexico. ENSO is the most important phenomena determining climatic differences between regions. In this study, the Niña conditions (cold phase) was characterized by producing dry conditions in the north and wet conditions in central Mexico (periods 1869 to 1874, 1886 to 1887, 1915 to 1917, 1955 to 1956, 1970 to 1975, and 1988 to 1999); however, other Niña events produced droughts in both regions as in years 1892, 1893, 1922, 1942, and 1998; but others did not have any significant impact such, i. e., 1903, 1908 - 1910, 1924, 1949, 1954, 1964, and 2007. On the other hand, the El Niño (warm phase) produced dry conditions in both regions, but only during intense ENSO events, that is 1880, 1888, 1899, 1905, 1913, 1918, 1929 - 1930, 1940, 1963, 1970, 1972, 1976, 1983, 1991, and 1997. A comparison between the ring-with indices of the regional chronology representative of the Transmexican Volcanic Belt and a seasonal (January-September) mean precipitation for the region indicated a significant association (r= 0. 8, p 3 ̆c 0. 000) between both variables. It was not found a significant association with temperature. Even though temperature at high elevations may limit physiological processes for the species, precipitation seems to be the most limiting factor for growth. The wide distribution range of hartwegii pine from Mexico to Guatemala provides an excellent opportunity to expand the current network of treeline chronologies to better understand climate variability and impacts of climate change...|$|R
40|$|A new genus {{and species}} of notharctine primate, Hesperolemur actius, is {{described}} from Uintan (middle Eocene) aged rocks of San Diego County, California. Hesperolemur differs from all previously described adapiforms in having the anterior third of the ectotympanic anulus fused to the internal lateral wall of the auditory bulla. In this feature Hesperolemur superficially resembles extant cheirogaleids. Hesperolemur also differs from previously known adapiforms in lacking bony canals that transmit the internal carotid artery through the tympanic cavity. Hesperolemur, like the later occurring North American cercamoniine Mahgarita stevensi, appears to have lacked a stapedial artery. Evidence from newly discovered skulls of Notharctus and Smilodectes, along with Hesperolemur, Mahgarita, and Adapis, indicates that the tympanic arterial <b>circulatory</b> <b>pattern</b> of these adapiforms is characterized by stapedial arteries that are smaller than promontory arteries, a feature shared with extant tarsiers and anthropoids {{and one of the}} characteristics often used to support the existence of a haplorhine-strepsirhine dichotomy among extant primates. The existence of such a dichotomy among Eocene primates is not supported by any compelling evidence. Hesperolemur is the latest occurring notharctine primate known from North America and is the only notharctine represented among a relatively diverse primate fauna from southern California. The coastal lowlands of southern California presumably served as a refuge area for primates during the middle and later Eocene as climates deteriorated in the continental interior. Hesperolemur probably was an immigrant taxon that entered California from either the northern (Wyoming/Utah) or southern (New Mexico) western interior during the middle Eocene © 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|R
