50|$|The Engineering Division {{establishes}} {{observation and}} analysis requirements for CO-OPS {{based on the}} assessment of user/customer needs. The Division also manages the Ocean Systems Test and Evaluation Program (OSTEP) and its associated test facilities. The Division develops new oceanographic measurement systems and techniques to improve the safety of marine navigation. The Division: develops and issues <b>standard</b> operating <b>procedures,</b> project <b>instructions,</b> and manuals, to guide the operation and maintenance of CO-OPS oceanographic and meteorological measurement systems; prepares measurement requirements (based on tidal zoning) for hydrographic or photogrammetric field surveys, and to support other NOS requirements needs for water level and current information; prepares and monitors interagency agreements, technology transfer agreements and work plans; prepares and administers contracts; provides technical assistance and guidance to other countries, agencies, and {{the public in the}} establishment and operation of water level and current measurement stations; and develops/integrates measurement and telemetry systems needed to support CO-OPS activities.|$|R

40|$|Semarang is {{the capital}} of Central Java province. As a big city, {{investment}} is required for regional development. One way to increase investment in Semarang is with innovations in investment licensing. The purpose {{of this research is}} to find BPPT innovations in investment licensing, how the process of innovation in the BPPT and to identify any obstacles in the innovation of investment services. This study used qualitative research methods to explore and understand the meaning that comes from social problems. The results of this research indicate that there are some innovations in investment service applied in BPPT, process of implementing the innovation of investment services and obstacles in the innovation of investment services. Investment service innovations consisting of process innovation, service innovation and system innovation. For the process of innovation implementing is based on <b>standard</b> operating <b>procedures</b> and <b>instructions</b> from the central government. Furthermore there are four obstacles in the innovation of investment services. Advice given to BPPT institution is the need for monitoring and evaluation of the innovation investment, studying the obstacles that occur in the process of investment licensing service and continue to develop new innovations, especially in the investment service...|$|R
