This study aimed to identify {{the economic impact of}} chronic adult HIV morbidity, specifically to estimate cost of care from households’ perspective. Median out of pocket health expenditure per patient per year is RM 1 080 representing 14. 7 % of patient’s median income. (Note 1) Productivity loss due to absenteeism and <b>stoppage</b> <b>of</b> <b>works</b> were RM 900 and RM 10 800 respectively.

An important policy implication is to ensure proper resource allocation to manage and control HIV/AIDS, more investment on training and to ensure that households can support themselves and meet their medical care needs without jeopardizing the wellbeing and future of other household members. </p...|$|R

The torque and moment of internal friction (the diesel engine without load and governor) cross {{in the field}} of the engine's destruction (the speed limit was exceeded). Hence, the diesel engine is equipped with a speed governor. The main task of the governor is to counteract exceeding of the speed limit. We did a research on the engine with an injection pump wherein the conventional centrifugal governor was replaced by the microprocessor controller. This is because using a large number of electronic elements microcontroller has smaller reliability in comparison with mechanical governors.

Although it was previously redesigned in 1968, it was still the site of about 180 accidents per year—over six times the statewide average for accident frequency. The junction was to be rebuilt with three lanes in each direction for the Northern State {{in the middle of}} exit 31A, a direct ramp between the westbound Northern State Parkway and the southbound Meadowbrook, connections from Glen Cove Road to both parkways, and the relocation of exit and entrance ramps within the interchange. Construction began in May 1988, and the project was expected to be completed on October 31, 1991. It was proceeding on schedule until the village of Westbury filed a suit against NYSDOT in February 1989. The lawsuit claimed that NYSDOT did not follow proper environmental guidelines while designing the project because their environmental impact report failed to consider the impacts of a nearby future widening project on the Northern State Parkway.
