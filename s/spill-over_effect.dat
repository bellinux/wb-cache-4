40|$|This study adds to Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) by {{providing}} an additional measure to market beta in constructing {{a more efficient}} investment portfolio. The additional measure analyses the volatility <b>spill-over</b> <b>effects</b> among stocks within the same portfolio. Using intraday stock returns from five top- 40 listed stocks on the JSE between July 2008 and April 2010, volatility <b>spill-over</b> <b>effects</b> were estimated with a residual- based test (aggregate shock [AS] model) framework. It is shown that when a particular stock attracted fewer volatility <b>spill-over</b> <b>effects</b> from the other stocks in the portfolio, the overall portfolio volatility decreased as well. In most cases market beta showcased similar results. Therefore, in order to construct a more efficient risk- adjusted portfolio, one requires both a portfolio that has a unit correlation with the market (beta-based), and stocks that showcase {{the least amount of}} volatility <b>spill-over</b> <b>effects</b> amongst one another.

In 1980, the Iranian revolution under Ayatollah Khomeini evoked a strong reaction throughout the Muslim world. The <b>spill-over</b> <b>effect</b> of the revolution worried the Arab world, as well the military government of President General Zia-ul-Haq. Considering this issue, the religiously influenced military government of Zia-ul-Haq then provided a rare opportunity and the political change in Pakistan and the Islamic Revolution in Iran suited well to one another and, therefore, no diplomatic and political rift occurred between them. Responding swiftly to this great revolutionary change, Foreign Minister of Pakistan Agha Shahi immediately paid a state visit to Tehran who met the Iranian counterpart Karim Sanjabi on March 10, 1979. Both expressed confidence by stating that Iran and Pakistan were going to march together to a brighter future. The next day, Agha Shahi held talks with the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, in which developments in the region were discussed. On 11 April 1979, Zia famously declared that, [...] "Khomeini is a symbol of Islamic insurgence". Reciprocating President Zia's sentiments, Imam Khomeini, in his letter, called for Muslim unity. He declared, [...] "Ties with Pakistan are based on Islam."

EricksonÂ´s theory on identity, the image of oneself integrates its own personality with the surrounding world, which can in this case be successful sublimations, active protective mechanisms, preferable potentials and so on. There is also the famous understanding that only language enables a person to see himself in his imaginations as an object. The identity issue here comes into forefront as ethnicity plays an important role, as this makes the base for objective characteristics features like place of birth, languages, economy, race type etc. According to the study done on the ethnic-linguistic identification of repatriates in modern Kazakhstan, they have identified that the repatriates {{between the ages of}} 17-25 have undergone the problem of identity crises, as this for instance poses an important question for them: Who am I?. Along with this identity issue, the repatriates also undergo problems in receiving secondary education in their own mother tongue. Most of the time it is either a bilingual secondary taught program or neither, which of course also cause a <b>spill-over</b> <b>effect</b> on the education system of other states and so cause huge strains in adaptational programs for repatriates. Of course other factors influence this identity issue along with the ethnic-linguistic identification. These other factors which could influence were for instance the level of proficiency in their language, socio-economic situation as well residence of their stay. All that indicates that the ida of identity loss and in general about the ethnic-linguistic crisis is dependent on many factors and so individual-specific as well.|$|E
5000|$|The Ottoman Empire {{left behind}} their religion, their language, and their people in Kosovo(dating {{back to the}} 14th century). All three mark {{important}} facts of the Kosovar culture today. Kosovo has 2 official languages, Albanian and Serbian.

According to the Kosovo Ministry of Education, each student must master and demonstrate their mother tongue during primary and secondary schooling in whichever language they choose (although most students take up the Albanian mother tongue). In addition the first foreign language that every student must demonstrate proficiency, is English. The influence of the Ottomans had a <b>spill-over</b> <b>effect</b> of cultural and religious identity which resulted in the construction of many religious monuments and artifacts in Kosovo. Over 90% of Kosovar-Albanians are of Islamic religion primarily due to the occupation of the Ottoman Empire. Aside from Turkish-religious-structural influences, the current Kosovar culture was also influenced by other ethnic minorities within the region constituting, but not limited to: Roma, Serb, Bosnian, Ashkali, Gorani, etc. Thus, instruments like the Kemenche and traditional dances such as Hora from the Turkish culture become a symbol of Kosovar ethnic identity. Similarly, the instrument knows as the Cifteli, is also a widely used instrument in Kosovo with origins from the Turkish culture that dates back to the early Ottoman Empire. Likewise, the Serbians adopted music known as [...] "tallava", a fast-paced folk music type, which has had a great influence in the recent years in Kosovo culture.Folklore and Oral tradition have been present throughout the history of Kosovo, where these two elements {{played a crucial role in}} communicating important information, history and events among communities and generations. A low literacy rate and dynamics of life style in rural areas limited the ability to document important developments in written formats. Consequently, communities transmitted important national events and collective memories to younger generations through oral traditions, including legends, songs, proverbs and stories.|$|E

Concretely, we hypothesize that audit quality is influenced by location and by the existence of spill-over effects generated by two factors: (1) the specialization and reputation of auditing firms and (2) the economic and institutional development of the audit firm's location. We developed an empirical research to test the existence of such spatial effects (location and spill-over) on a representative sample of the Spanish audit market.

40|$|MCom (Risk Management), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2013 The {{modelling}} of volatility {{has long}} been seminal to finance and risk management in general, as it provides information on the spread of portfolio returns. In {{order to reduce the}} overall volatility of a stock portfolio, modern portfolio theory (MPT), within an efficient market hypothesis (EMH) framework, dictates that a well-diversified portfolio should have a market beta of one (thereafter adjusted for risk preference), and thus move in sync with a benchmark market portfolio. Such a stock portfolio is highly correlated with the market, and considered to be entirely hedged against unsystematic risk. However, the risks within and between stocks present in a portfolio still impact on each other. In particular, risk present in a particular stock may spill over and affect the risk profile of another stock included within a portfolio - a phenomenon known as volatility <b>spill-over</b> <b>effects.</b> In developing economies such as South Africa, portfolio managers are limited in their choices of stocks. This increases the difficulty of fully diversifying a stock portfolio given the volatility <b>spill-over</b> <b>effects</b> that may be present between stocks listed on the same exchange. In addition, stock portfolios are not static, and therefore require constant rebalancing according to the mandate of the managing fund. The process of constant rebalancing of a stock portfolio (for instance, to follow the market) becomes more complex and difficult during times of financial distress. Considering all these conditions, portfolio managers need all the relevant information (more than MPT would provide) available to them in order to select and rebalance a portfolio of stocks that are as mean-variance efficient as possible. This study provides an additional measure to market beta in order to construct a more efficient portfolio. The additional measure analyse the volatility <b>spill-over</b> <b>effects</b> between stocks within the same portfolio. Using intraday stock returns and a residual based test (aggregate shock [AS] model), volatility <b>spill-over</b> <b>effects</b> are estimated between stocks. It is shown that when a particular stock attracts fewer <b>spill-over</b> <b>effects</b> from the other stocks in the portfolio, the overall portfolio volatility would decrease as well. In most cases market beta showcased similar results; this change is however not linear in the case of market beta. Therefore, in order to construct a more efficient portfolio, one requires both a portfolio that has a unit correlation with the market, but also includes stocks with the least amount of volatility <b>spill-over</b> <b>effects</b> among each other.

40|$|A {{key feature}} of {{globalisation}} is the increasingly {{important role of}} Multinational Enterprises (MNEs) as vehicles for Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). Economic Theory recognises that MNEs can benefit from economic growth in developing countries through generating positive externalities (so-called <b>spill-over</b> <b>effects).</b> These <b>spill-over</b> <b>effects</b> occur predominantly through the R&D and innovation of MNEs, their outsourcing to local firms, their training of local labour and the payment of higher wages by MNEs to retain good labourers. All of these benefits can be important for Africa, the world's poorest continent, in order to accelerate groth. However, {{the extent to which}} African countries benefit from <b>spill-over</b> <b>effects</b> of MNEs remains to be empirically investigated.

30|$|The strong {{resistance}} of the nation-states prevented a constitutional federal system and âthe Community began life as an international organisation founded on a Treaty [the Rome Treaty] between sovereign Statesâ (Mancini and Keeling, 1994 : p. 176); therefore, the Community as a term referred to the community of member states but not European people (Caporaso, 2000, p. 16). Here, the main problem of the federalists was âsovereigntyâ as the key concept legitimizing {{the existence of the}} nation state (Slanter, 1994), and they needed to develop an alternative concept to legitimize a supranational European Union. In this regard, âsolidarityâ emerged as an alternative concept and Monnet had an influential functionalist idea for achieving a de facto solidarity among European nations through providing wealth to âEuropean peopleâ (De Sousa and Moury, 2009). According to the new functionalist understanding, an economic community would initially be created, and then it would gradually evolve into a political community. Developing economic interdependence among the members would result in a <b>spill-over</b> <b>effect</b> and the economic community would be easily deepened. In the second phase of this functionalist process, interdependence and the <b>spill-over</b> <b>effect</b> would start to cover political issues and this would strengthen âsolidarityâ among the European people (Niemann and Schmitter, 2009).|$|E
30|$|A gradual {{transformation}} of the international system, on the other hand, {{is the type of}} integration advocated by neo-functionalists and unlike the previous one, it starts from below. Just as federalists, proponents of gradual approaches to integration would find support in Kantâs Perpetual Peace suggesting that integration âfrom a State of Nations [,] would be ever increasing and finally embrace all peoples of the earthâ [10, p. 136]. Gradual integration can occur through the interrelated spill-over and socialization effects. The socialization effect derives its logic from social constructivism suggesting for the mutually dependent and equal relationship between the agent and the structure just described in the preceding paragraph. Socialization is intertwined with the <b>spill-over</b> <b>effect,</b> as both parallel effects have to be active in order to generate integration. The <b>spill-over</b> <b>effect</b> implies a gradual delegation of functions from the national to the supranational level taking place {{as a result of the}} functional spill-over creating integrative pressures in one policy area through integration in another, and the political spill-over shifting the level of attention from the national to the supranational level. As Ernest Haas puts it, âintegration brings loyalties, expectations and political activities towards a new centre, whose institutions possess or demand jurisdiction over the pre-existing national statesâ [12, p. 139].|$|E
