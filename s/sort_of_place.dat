5|$|As a child, Morrissey {{was greatly}} {{interested}} in film, television and Gene Kelly musicals. After seeing a broadcast of Kes on television, {{he decided to}} become an actor. At his primary school, St Margaret Mary's School, he was encouraged by a teacher named Miss Keller, who cast him as the Scarecrow in a school production adapted from The Wonderful Wizard of Oz when he was 11 years old. Keller left the school soon after, leaving Morrissey without encouragement. His secondary school, De La Salle School, had no drama classes and was the <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>place</b> where Morrissey thought the fear of bullying dissuaded pupils from participating in lessons. On {{the advice of a}} cousin, Morrissey joined the Everyman Youth Theatre. For the first couple of weeks, he was quite shy and did not join in the workshops. When he eventually participated, he appeared in the youth theatre's production of Fighting Chance, a play about the riots in Liverpool. He went to the theatre on Tuesday and Wednesday nights.|$|E
500|$|Todd VanDerWerff from The A.V. Club {{named the}} episode {{one of the}} [...] "10 must-see episodes" [...] of The X-Files, and wrote that it [...] "abruptly makes the series’ alien-conspiracy storyline {{relevant}} again." [...] His review concludes, [...] "t's {{a fine example of}} a show past its glory days, nevertheless finding a way to make itself relevant again." [...] VanDerWerff later awarded the episode an [...] "A–" [...] and praised—in addition to its refreshing take on the alien mythology—the episode's location, noting that the oil rig's [...] "isolation and man-made island status, was definitely the <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>place</b> that would look and feel different from just about every other episode of the show." [...] He also applauded the dynamic between Mulder and Doggett, and wrote that the episode successfully was a way for [...] "David Duchovny and Fox Mulder to pass the torch to Robert Patrick and John Doggett." ...|$|E
500|$|Filming {{happened}} {{mostly in}} Los Angeles, including location shooting at Sunset Strip, Silver Lake, Pacific Palisades, the Hollywood Hills and the Biltmore Hotel. Id Club, the nightclub {{featured in the}} film, was built within Hollywood's Pantages Theater, while the hills above Dodger Stadium near Elysian Park {{were used for the}} car chase and crash where Sil fakes her death. For the opening scenes in Utah, the Tooele Army Depot dubbed as the outside of the research facility—the interiors were shot at the Rockwell International Corporation laboratory in California—and a Victorian-era train station in Brigham City was part of Sil's escape. Other locations included the [...] Santa Monica Pier and the Arecibo telescope in Puerto Rico. The most complex sets involved the sewer complex and a tar-filled granite cavern where the ending occurs. Donaldson wanted a maze quality for the sewers, which had traces of realism (such as tree roots breaking through from the ceiling) and artistic licenses. Production designer John Muto intentionally designed the sewers wider and taller than real ones, as well as with walkways, but nevertheless aiming for a claustrophobic and realistic atmosphere. The underground tunnels were built out of structural steel, metal rod, plaster and concrete to endure the fire effects, and had its design based on the La Brea Tar Pits, with Muto describing them as [...] "just the <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>place</b> in which a creature from another planet might feel at home." ...|$|E

2500|$|Despite {{the hardships}} {{created by the}} nature of the Nullarbor, European {{settlers}} were determined to cross the plain. Although Edward John Eyre described the Plain as [...] "a hideous anomaly, a blot on the face of Nature, the <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>place</b> one gets into in bad dreams", he became the first European to successfully make the crossing in 1841. Eyre departed Fowler's Bay on 17 November 1840 with John Baxter and a party of three Aboriginal men. When three of his horses died of dehydration, he returned to Fowler's Bay. He departed with a second expedition on 25 February 1841. By 29 April, the party had reached Caiguna. Lack of supplies and water led to a mutiny. Two of the Aborigines killed Baxter and took the party's supplies. Eyre and the third Aborigine, Wylie, continued on their journey, surviving through bushcraft and some fortuitous circumstances, such as receiving some supplies from a French whaling vessel anchored at Rossiter Bay. They completed their crossing in June 1841.|$|E
2500|$|On August 27, 2008, Mediabistro wrote a {{piece about}} the Big Three network newscasts, praising Couric's Evening News for {{extensive}} reporting that had, in its opinion, content better than its rivals. Another critic from MarketWatch praised Couric's work and said that people should watch out for her in 2009. Washington Post writer Tom Shales praised Couric as a warmer, more benevolent presence than her two competitors, something that she brought to the program nearly 16 years of goodwill from doing [...] "Today" [...] and becoming America's sweetheart, or else very close to it, and he claimed that this goodwill remained. Shales added that viewers [...] "may find bad news less discomforting and sleep-depriving if Couric gives it to them". He also added {{that she does not}} try to [...] "sugarcoat" [...] or [...] "prettify" [...] grim realities. According to Shales, the Evening News may be a more hospitable, welcoming <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>place</b> than its competitors. He concluded by stating that [...] "it's naive to think that viewers choose their news anchor based solely on strict journalistic credentials, though Couric's do seem to be in order, despite her critics' claims".|$|E
