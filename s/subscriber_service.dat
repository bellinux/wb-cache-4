50|$|The {{development}} of the modern telephone keypad is attributed to research in the 1950s by Richard Deininger under the directorship of John Karlin at the Human Factors Engineering Department of Bell Labs. The contemporary keypad is {{laid out in a}} rectangular array of twelve push buttons arranged as four rows and three columns of keys. For military applications, a fourth, right-most column of keys was added for priority signaling in the Autovon system in the 1960s. Initially, between 1963 and 1968, the keypads for civilian <b>subscriber</b> <b>service</b> had keys installed in only ten positions, omitting the lower left and lower right keys that commonly are assigned to the star (✻) and number sign (#) signals, respectively. These keys were added to provide signals for anticipated data entry purposes in business applications, but found use in Custom Calling Services (CLASS) features installed in electronic switching systems.|$|E

40|$|This work {{looks into}} the {{monopoly}} associated with some telecommunication regulatory agencies inability to mandate the implementation of Mobile Number Portability (MNP) {{and its effects on}} subscribers who cannot retain their directory numbers when switching over to another service provider for reason best known to them. Many operators have claimed that Mobile Number Portability (MNP) is unnecessary and is an unwarranted expense, using assertions that the sector is highly competitive. Some mobile operators have gone to considerable trouble to make MNP difficult and have discouraged customers from exercising this right. They have suggested alternatives such as personal numbering and Universal Personal Telephony (UPT). However, these are not substitutes for MNP, but are expensive, value-added services. MNP should therefore strongly be encouraged by governments and Regulatory Agencies to recognize that Mobile Number Portability (MNP) {{is an essential part of}} the competitive framework and should be made legally binding on all operators and service providers.

30|$|In the USA, the CALEA {{requires}} that LEAs {{need to be}} able to access IRI records and CC data with no degradation and interference to the <b>subscriber</b> <b>service</b> while protecting the privacy and security of subscribers and the respective intercepted material [24]. The Wiretap Act including the Title III of the OCCSSA and the ECPA prohibits unauthorized, nonconsensual interception of wire, oral, or electronic communications by government agencies for target identities that are US citizens. The FISA covers the use of LI and LALS for intelligence purposes where the target identity could not be a US citizen, working as an agent on behalf of a foreign country. The invocation of LI and LALS under FISA requires prior authorization by the FISC federal court. The Title II of US Patriot Act allows LEAs to obtain authorization for LI or LALS by demonstrating that the IRI and CC records are relevant for an investigation, rather than the stricter FISA requirement to demonstrate that the target identity is explicitly involved in unauthorized activities and terrorism.|$|E
40|$|Social regulation, {{as applied}} {{specifically}} to the telecommunications sector, is a new phenomenon in most countries. It {{was only in the}} 1960 s, with the establishment of regulatory agencies, that social regulation became important. The regulators are mandated by their country’s legislative and regulatory frameworks to meet social objectives. This study examined the extent to which ICASA protects consumers as it is mandated to do by the Electronic Communications Act 36 of 2005. The study found that ICASA has adopted mechanisms of protecting consumers, namely by conducting awareness campaigns, road shows and workshops in all the nine provinces of South Africa in order to educate and inform consumers about the procedures of lodging complaints and to make them aware of their rights. However, despite ICASA’s endeavours to ensure consumer protection, most consumers are neither aware of their rights and how to efficiently exercise them nor the procedures of lodging complaints.
