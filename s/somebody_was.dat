25|$|One of {{the most}} widely practised Dongba rituals, Zzerq Ciul Zhuaq (literally, to repay the debts of a tree), has been {{described}} in the village of Shuming. The ritual was conducted if <b>somebody</b> <b>was</b> stricken with illness or bad luck, when a Dongba priest would be consulted. On many occasions, the result would show that the person had carried out logging or washing of dirty things in the forest, and the family or person concerned would have to ask the Dongba priest to hold the ritual near where the activity had taken place, and apologise to the nature god Shu.|$|E
25|$|In {{his first}} meeting with Genie, James Kent {{initially}} observed no reactions from her but eventually drew a small amount of nonverbal and verbal responsiveness with a small puppet. Playing with this and similar puppets quickly became her favorite activity and, apart from her tantrums, accounted for most of the few times she expressed any emotion during the early part of her stay. Within a few days she started learning to dress herself and began voluntarily using the toilet, but she continued to suffer from nighttime and daytime incontinence which only slowly improved. Kent quickly realized there would be {{a large number of people}} working with Genie, and was concerned that she would not learn to form a normal relationship unless <b>somebody</b> <b>was</b> a steady presence in her life, so he decided to accompany her on walks and to all of her appointments.|$|E

500|$|The {{montage of}} Stewie and Brian visiting several U.S. states (all {{of which are}} states where there's nothing but cornfields) was a DVD {{exclusive}} scene, removed from television for timing purposes. This scene was partially based on series creator Seth MacFarlane traveling the United States after the September 11, 2001 attacks and realizing there is lots of corn throughout the U.S. A deleted scene directly after the helicopter crash had shown Stewie saying [...] "come here, puss" [...] for a second time, but this was replaced with another.

500|$|Shortly {{after the}} murder, later-disbarred American {{attorney}} Jack Thompson, who has campaigned against violence in video games, {{claimed that he}} had written to Rockstar after the game was released, warning them {{that the nature of}} the game could inspire copycat killings; [...] "I wrote warning them that <b>somebody</b> <b>was</b> going to copycat the Manhunt game and kill somebody. We have had dozens of killings in the U.S. by children who had played these types of games. This is not an isolated incident. These types of games are basically murder simulators.

Soon thereafter, the Pakeerah family hired Thompson with the aim of suing Sony and Rockstar for £50 million in a wrongful death claim.|$|E

Koepp explained he would e-mail it to him, and he would give a section of the script that was relating to whatever <b>somebody</b> <b>was</b> doing. Miranda Otto thought of not even discussing the story with her family and friends. Otto said, [...] "I know some people who always say, 'Oh, everything's so secret.' I think it's good.

500|$|Lacking a {{contract}} {{prior to the}} 1995–96 season, Fleury staged a brief hold-out during training camp before signing a five-year, $12million deal with the Flames. He agreed to take less money than he could have received {{on the open market}} out of loyalty to the franchise that had given him his NHL opportunity. He missed much of the pre-season with a stomach ailment, but joined the team for the season opener. Although he felt like <b>somebody</b> <b>was</b> [...] "stabbing a knife in [...] gut every five minutes", Fleury had played every game for the Flames when he revealed in December 1995 that he had been diagnosed with Crohn's Disease and doctors had finally found the correct medication to control it. Despite the ailment, Fleury led the team in goals, assists and points, and played in his third All-Star Game, serving as Calgary's only representative.|$|E
500|$|Abraham {{created a}} light-control system {{in an attempt}} to keep the {{overhead}} from being unflattering. However, after unsuccessfully attempting to implement the necessary wiring to control each light, the production team established controlling rows of light. Pat O'Mara, the key grip during production, installed several 2x1 and 2x2 blackout panels and frames that were retrofitted with small albeit strong magnets. During a scene when and actor or actresses stood under a fluorescent light, a panel or a frame was placed over the fixture, subsequently diffusing light onto their faces. [...] "If <b>somebody</b> <b>was</b> walking through the office in a wide shot, I just turned the overhead lights on. But if Don was talking to someone at his desk and the office was the backdrop, I turned all the lights on and then selectively removed some; then, I brought the key around with Kino Flo Image 80s through 4-by-8 frames of 250 or 216, or sourced my key with a larger Fresnel through the window." ...|$|E
500|$|During the {{aftermath}} of the murder of Stefan Pakeerah, by his friend Warren Leblanc in Leicestershire, England, the game Manhunt was linked after the media wrongfully claimed police found a copy in Leblanc's room. The police officially denied any link, citing drug-related robbery as the motive and revealing that the game had been found in Pakeerah's bedroom, not Leblanc's. Thompson, who had heard of the murder, claimed that he had written to Rockstar after the game was released, warning them that the nature of the game could inspire copycat killings: [...] "I wrote warning them that <b>somebody</b> <b>was</b> going to copycat the Manhunt game and kill somebody.

500|$|At the 2009 NHL General Managers' Meeting, it was {{discussed}} whether the rule should be eliminated {{as a solution}} to the increasing number of injuries on defenseman who were being hit hard by forechecking forwards. The forecheckers were no longer impeded by defencemen holding them up because of the crackdown on interference, which created situations where defencemen were being hit at high speeds. Brodeur believed that revoking the trapezoid could result in more scoring and more exciting games. He explained, [...] "If you give the liberty to the goalies to play the puck, they'll mess up more than they're successful." [...] He also expressed his concern for defencemen, [...] "It's a no-brainer if they want to start to eliminate these huge hits for the defencemen... Whenever my defencemen or <b>somebody</b> <b>was</b> getting a big hit, I felt guilty that I let that guy get hit like that. Now, I've got to sit and watch all the time... You've got to try to find something because so many guys are getting hurt."

The surprise twist in the episode, in which forensics technician Ryan O'Halloran is killed by fellow technician Dale Stuckey, was conceived by Neal Baer, the series executive producer and showrunner. Baer said the decision to kill the character in the story [...] "just came to [...] one day" [...] and thought that [...] "this may be a really interesting way to bring [...] cast together and deal with this story point". In particular, Baer {{said he wanted to}} kill a long-recurring character so the show could [...] "explore characters' reactions to a death in an interesting way". Mike Doyle, the actor who played O'Halloran, was notified about the decision by Baer in a phone call {{a few weeks before the}} episode was filmed in May 2009. Baer said Doyle and the rest of the cast took the news well because, in his words, [...] "I think everybody knew that <b>somebody</b> <b>was</b> going, so they weren't shocked." [...] During a May 2009 interview, Baer hinted at the twist by telling media outlets that the season finale would include a surprise ending: [...] "One of our own is murdered." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to escape attempts, prisoners {{also tried to}} make the life of their guards more miserable by resorting to [...] "goon-baiting", making nuisances of themselves by harassing the guards.

British Flight Lieutenant Pete Tunstall especially tried to cause havoc by disturbing the roll call even if nobody was trying to escape, so that the guards would not become suspicious when <b>somebody</b> <b>was.</b> He went through a total of five courts-martial and suffered a total of 415 days in solitary confinement.|$|E

He thought it was [...] "extraordinary if <b>somebody</b> <b>was</b> stabbed in the head and still be alive for a while".

[...] Boyer told other versions about the origins of Ted Ten Eyck, saying he had received a new manuscript from Earp family members, that the story was based on the unpublished memoir of a newspaper journalist who was present in Tombstone while the Earps were lawmen, and that he had used Ten Eyck as a literary device and the book was {{in the form of a}} [...] "non-fiction novel." [...] In a 1977 interview he altered his description of the newspaperman once again. He said, [...] "I am Ten Eyck.
