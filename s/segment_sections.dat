40|$|Objective: To measure intra-operative {{blood loss}} at {{elective}} lower <b>segment</b> caesarean <b>section</b> and to compare estimated wtih measured blood loss. Design: Prospective observational study. Blood loss {{was measured in}} patients who underwent lower <b>segment</b> caesarean <b>section</b> {{in the course of}} routine hospital activity. Setting: Tsan Yuk Hospital (Hong Kong), which is affiliated to the University of Hong Kong, 1990 - 1991. Subjects: Forty women (mean age 29 years) with singleton pregnancies (mean gestation 38 weeks) delivered by elective lower <b>segment</b> caesarean <b>section</b> under general anaesthesia (mean birth weight 3177 g). Main ontcome measure: Intra-operative blood loss measured by the alkaline haematin method (intra-assay co-efficient of variation 2. 2 %). Results: The mean measured blood loss was 487 ml (SE 40, range 164 - 1438). The mean estimated blood loss was 425 ml (SE 31) range 100 - 1300; mode 400). Observer error in estimating blood loss was higher if measured blood loss > 600 ml. One patient received a blood transfusion and another had a post-operative haemoglobin level < 10. 0 g/dl. Conclusion: Blood loss at elective lower <b>segment</b> caesarean <b>section</b> was usually < 500 ml and was estimated with reasonable accuracy. However, there was a tendency to under-estimate blood loss when the measured loss exceeded 600 ml. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
50|$|The modern {{emphasis}} {{on the value of}} fiber in the diet began with Cleave. A strong case was made by Neil Painter and Adam Smith that a deficiency of dietary fiber is the cause of diverticular disease. They argued that the colonic muscles needed to contract strongly in order to transmit and expel the small stool associated with a fiber deficient diet. The increased pressure within the <b>segmented</b> <b>section</b> of bowel over years gave rise to herniation at the vulnerable point where blood vessels enter the colonic wall.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES To {{study the}} {{efficacy}} of Tranexamic acid in reducing blood loss {{during and after the}} lower <b>segment</b> caesarean <b>section</b> in Multigravida parturients. METHODOLOGY A case controlled prospective study was conducted in 50 multigravida parturient women undergoing elective lower <b>segment</b> caesarean <b>section</b> in our hospital after getting Institutional Ethical Committee approval, over a period of two months. 25 of them were given Tranexamic acid 15 mg/kg immediately before caesarean section. Blood loss was collected and measured during two periods. The first period was from placental delivery to end of LSCS and the second from the end LSCS to 2 hours postpartum. RESULTS Tranexamic acid significantly reduces the quantity of blood loss from the end of LSCS to 2 hours post-partum in multigravida parturients. No complications or side effects are noted in both the groups. CONCLUSION Tranexamic acid significantly reduces the amount of blood loss during and after the lower <b>segment</b> caesarean <b>section</b> in multigravida parturients and its use was not associated with any side effects or complications...|$|R

40|$|An {{analytical}} method is {{proposed for the}} thermal behavior of a reinforced concrete flexural member subjected to fire. The analysis procedure can be subdivided into two different steps; sectional analysis and member solution. A segmentation scheme is employed in the analysis for a section. It implicates uniform sectional properties and temperature distribution through the longitudinal axis of the member. The mechanical changes at the <b>segmented</b> <b>section</b> such as strain changes and corresponding stresses due to temperature increase are integrated into the member behavior at the member solution step. According to the analysis results, there exist very severe nonlinear strain changes with the depth measured from the fire-exposed surface, which are caused by a nonlinear temperature distribution at the section. Self-equilibrating stresses are manifested during heating just to let the section remain plane after deformation...|$|R

50|$|A {{specialized}} type of HRSG without boiler drums is the once-through steam generator. In this design, {{the inlet}} feedwater follows a continuous path without <b>segmented</b> <b>sections</b> for economizers, evaporators, and superheaters. This provides {{a high degree}} of flexibility as the sections are allowed to grow or contract based on the heat load being received from the gas turbine. The absence of drums allows for quick changes in steam production and fewer variables to control, and is ideal for cycling and base load operation. With proper material selection, an OTSG can be run dry, meaning the hot exhaust gases can pass over the tubes with no water flowing inside the tubes. This eliminates the need for a bypass stack and exhaust gas diverter system which is required to operate a combustion turbine with a drum-type HRSG out of service.|$|R
