5|$|Grameen Bank is {{best known}} for its system of {{solidarity}} lending. The Bank also incorporates a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>values</b> embodied in Bangladesh by the Sixteen Decisions. At every branch of Grameen Bank, the borrowers recite these Decisions and vow to follow them. As a result of the Sixteen Decisions, Grameen borrowers have been encouraged to adopt positive social habits. One such habit includes educating children by sending them to school. Since the Grameen Bank embraced the Sixteen Decisions, almost all Grameen borrowers have their school-age children enrolled in regular classes. This in turn helps bring about social change, and educate the next generation.|$|E

40|$|Many of {{standard}} practical techniques of solving constraint satisfaction problems use various decomposition methods {{to represent a}} problem as a combination of smaller ones. We study a general method of decomposing constraint satisfaction problems in which every constraint is represented as a disjunction {{of two or more}} simpler constraints defined, possibly, on smaller <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>values.</b> We call a problem an amalgam if it can be decomposed in this way. Some particular cases of this construction have been considered in [Cohen et a/., 1997; 2000 b; 2000 al including amalgams of problems with disjoint <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>values,</b> and amalgams <b>of</b> independent problems. In this paper, we concentrate on constraint classes determined by relational clones, and study amalgams of such classes in the general case <b>of</b> arbitrary finite <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>values.</b> We completely characterise amalgams of this form solvable in polynomial time and provide efficient algorithms. ...|$|R
