40|$|Since {{independent}} {{regulatory agencies}} (IRAs) became key actors in European regulatory governance in the 1990 s, a significant share of policy-making {{has been carried}} out by organizations that are neither democratically elected nor directly accountable to elected politicians. In this context, public communication plays an important role. On the one hand, regulatory agencies might try to use communication to raise their accountability and thereby to mitigate their democratic deficit. On the other hand, communication may be used with the intent to steer the behavior of the regulated industry when more coercive regulatory means are unfeasible or undesirable. However, empirical research focusing directly on how regulators communicate is virtually non-existent. To fill this gap, this paper examines the public communication of IRAs in four countries (the United Kingdom, Germany, Ireland, and Switzerland) and three sectors (financial services, telecommunications, and broadcasting). The empirical analysis, based on qualitative interviews and a quantitative content analysis, indicates that the organization of the communication function follows a national pattern approach while a policy sector approach is helpful for understanding the use of communication as a <b>soft</b> <b>tool</b> of regulation...|$|E

The interesting point making {{the design of the}} oil pan so special is its laminated steel material. Beside its material, due to the deep-drawing production method, to determine the natural frequencies of the structure with Computer Aided Engineering (CAE) methodology is a problem for the design engineer. Especially when the highly nonlinear character of the oil pan and regions at different thicknesses sum up with the hardness of liquid modelling, free vibration modal analysis of the design at virtual environment becomes extremely challenging. Therefore, instead of refining the material characteristics in virtual design, first a primary 3 D dummy design is generated. Afterwards, a production method and material intent sample is produced with <b>soft</b> <b>tool.</b> Hammer test is applied on this sample filled with oil, therefore modal shapes and frequencies are gained. As a result, CAE modal analysis is generated and correlated by hammer test results; hence the first challenge of modelling the liquid is overcome.

After instrumenting the pan with optimum number of accelerometers and strain-gages from these critical locations, a durability test on a fired engine is run.

40|$|Visualizing the {{anatomical}} vessel networks plays {{a vital role}} in physiological or pathological investigations. However, identifying the fine structures of the smallest capillary vessels via conventional imaging ways remains a big challenge. Here, the room temperature liquid metal angiography was proposed {{for the first time to}} produce mega contrast X-ray images for multi-scale vasculature mapping. Gallium was used as the room temperature liquid metal contrast agent and perfused into the vessels of in vitro pig hearts and kidneys. We scanned the samples under X-ray and compared the angiograms with those obtained via conventional contrast agent [...] the iohexol. As quantitatively proved by the gray scale histograms, the contrast of the vessels to the surrounding tissues in the liquid metal angiograms is orders higher than that of the iohexol enhanced images. And the resolution of the angiograms has reached 100 μm, which means the capillaries can be clearly distinguished in the liquid metal enhanced images. With tomography from the micro-CT, we also managed to reconstruct the 3 -dementional structures of the kidney vessels. Tremendous clarity and efficiency of the method over existing approaches were experimentally demonstrated. It was disclosed that the usually invisible capillary networks now become distinctively clear in the gallium angiograms.

40|$|Rubber forming is {{a common}} process for the {{fabrication}} of flanged metallic parts in the aerospace industry. The process enables cheap tooling, which is important since the product series are limited. In the process a rigid and a <b>soft</b> <b>tool</b> are combined to form a metal blank into the required shape. Most components made in this way are “flanged parts”, i. e. parts with a rather flat web plate and curved flanges at {{the periphery of the}} web plate. For flanged parts the determination of spring back of the flanges, straight or curved, is important, since the forming dies compensated with the spring back, should result in accurate products. Like all metal forming processes elastic and plastic deformations are combined in the same process cycle. The elastic deformations result in spring back and residual stresses, the ratio between these two depends on the shape of the product and the distribution of the plastic and elastic deformations. In this research an aluminium alloy was used. The low Young’s modulus of this alloy results in rather high elastic responses upon deformation. Other aspects that have been evaluated are the effect of processing parameters like friction and distribution of strains. For stretch flanges the strain is distributed evenly along the flange, but not for shrink flanges, where buckling plays a role. Experimental research shows that the spring back of the flanges depend on a number of variables like the thickness, flange geometry, and material parameters. The spring back of a flange is also a mixture of different contributions: spring back due to the bending over the bend line, spring back due to the curvature of the flange, and spring back due to in-plane deformations. The research performed focused on the different components of the spring back and their interaction. Analysis of the data resulted in a new parameter by which a number of variables could be captured. This improves the understanding of the spring back phenomena and a generalization of the results...|$|E

40|$|Abrasive micro-waterjet {{processing}} is a non-conventional machining {{method that}} can be used to manufacture complex shapes in difficult-to-cut materials. The constant development of new materials with enhanced properties has sparked the interest in alternative machining technologies. Among these non-conventional machining methods, Abrasive Waterjet Machining is regarded as a flexible technology with potential to cope with a wide range of materials and applications. The use of a <b>soft</b> <b>tool</b> (i. e. the jet) is very advantageous because it makes it possible to perform different operations without modifying the equipment. However, this advantage poses a significant challenge: the erosion power of the jet is controlled through a set of operating parameters, and it is therefore necessary to have a deep understanding of the relation between such parameters and the effect of the jet on the surface. The process itself is subject to strong random variations, and this makes it even more complex to develop a detailed understanding of the optimum strategies to control the jet. The main objective of this thesis is to develop mathematical frameworks that account for the stochastic nature of the process, and that have the capability to predict detailed statistical information of the eroded surfaces for different operating parameters. This is addressed with two modelling approaches: a finite element model where the system is regarded as a set of multiple particles hitting a workpiece at very high speed, and a geometrical model built on the idea of considering the abrasive waterjet as a generic energy beam and exploiting the geometrical properties of the system. In the Finite Element approach, a modelling framework with the capability of predicting the average shape of abrasive waterjet machined footprints and the variability along the trench has been developed for the first time. This is achieved by combining finite element analysis and Monte Carlo methods, and the model is validated at different feed speeds and tilt angles. The random nature of the system is included by considering the input parameters (i. e. size, relative orientation, or position within the jet of the abrasive particles) as random variables with associated probability distributions. The geometrical approach is a method to predict the variability of the jet footprint for different jet feed speeds. Since the objective is to incorporate the stochastic nature of the system in the model, a stochastic partial differential equation is used to describe the machined surface as the jet is moved over it. This framework is greatly advantageous because it can be used to make fast predictions of the variability of the trench profiles (to within < 8...|$|E
