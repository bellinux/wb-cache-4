500|$|HarperCollins asked Lisa Pulitzer to {{audition}} {{to act as}} a ghost writer for Wall. Pulitzer describes herself as [...] "the official cult gal" [...] as she enjoys writing escape stories and is able to make the subjects of her work more comfortable during the process. [...] "Elissa called three women mother," [...] she said. [...] "But I come from a blended family, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> complicated relations and loyalties." ...|$|E
500|$|FIFA's {{decision}} to choose [...] "Waka Waka (This Time for Africa)" [...] {{as the official}} song was negatively received by South African people, who felt Shakira was not the [...] "right person to represent the country's first World Cup," [...] arguing that an African artist should have been assigned the role. South African musicians were also displeased regarding the lack of native acts scheduled to perform at the FIFA World Cup Kick-Off Celebration Concert on 10 June 2010. They expressed anger towards the South African Football Association (SAFA) for letting international artists like Alicia Keys, the Black Eyed Peas, and Shakira to headline the event. Subsequently, the Creative Workers Union of South Africa planned a demonstration to be held on 15 April, but called it off after SAFA announced that the repertoire of performing acts would be finalised after [...] "consultation with fans and host cities." [...] Danny Jordaan, head of the South African World Cup Organising Committee and president of SAFA, released a statement assuring that [...] "the incredibly talented South African and African music industry will play a major part in the tournament's off-field success and character." [...] Freshlyground's violinist Kyla-Rose Smith defended FIFA's {{decision to}} select [...] "Waka Waka (This Time for Africa)" [...] as the official song, saying: [...] "I think that the World Cup is a global event but it’s also a business, a huge marketing exercise. FIFA requires a musician of a certain global reach to appeal to all {{the different kinds of}} people who are involved and witness and watch the World Cup. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> the choice of someone like Shakira." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{structure}} of the poem forms an interesting and logical argument and progression. [...] In the first stanza he is saying you're too good for me, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> {{if you want to}} get rid of me. [...] In the second stanza he is saying that I am nowhere close to good enough for you, but maybe you are not aware of it. [...] And in the third stanza he is saying you are too good for me, but maybe you didn't realize that before. [...] In the closing couplet, Shakespeare confesses that no matter what the cause of misjudgment, you're released by the mistake, and [...] "I'm left here to remember our time together" [...] when I felt like nobility.|$|E

2500|$|After its release, it was aired by MTV a {{total of}} three times, all of these after the 10pm watershed, due to its highly charged sexual content, before being {{permanently}} banned; this made it Madonna's second video to be banned from airing by the channel, after [...] "Justify My Love" [...] in 1990. MTV spokeswoman Linda Alexander said, [...] "The themes of the video are clearly aimed at a more adult audience. It is not appropriate for a general viewing audience". Madonna herself said she understood the channel's ban on the video; [...] "MTV plays to a huge audience {{and a lot of them}} are children, and a lot of themes I'm exploring in my videos aren't meant for children, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> that they say I can't show it [...] I accept it". Rolling Stones Anthony DeCurtis said that [...] "This is pretty much normal Madonna fare, [...] But how much longer can you continue mining sexuality? In checking off your list of taboos, how far can you take them? At what point does it just stop being interesting?". Similarly, David Browne from Entertainment Weekly, asked [...] "Haven’t we seen most of this stuff before? Can we be bored with the subject matter already? [...] no emotion is attached to the mechanics of these acts, so it’s difficult to identify with or care about the characters". The video was nominated for the 1993 Billie Awards in four categories: Consumer print, trade print (music) and consumer print (retail), the most for a single entry. It also was ranked at number 16 on VH1's [...] "50 Sexiest Video Moments". The video was made commercially available in 2009, when it was included, albeit in a censored version, on Madonna's [...] compilation; it had previously been excluded from 1999's [...]|$|E

60|$|At least, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand,</b> what {{afterwards}} {{we wondered}} at, that Emily never mentioned Hester; only saying, when, after some days she did write, that Lord Trevorsham was ill.|$|E

6000|$|... "Your pardon, Lady. It is true {{that evil}} {{threaten}}s this royal babe, or <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> from Jabez, who knows so much. But it is not I that threaten it, any more than I hate you, in whom I acknowledge a fellow of my craft, but one greater than myself that it is my duty to obey." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I felt that. But you see, Bertha, {{until you}} did accept him, I {{had no right}} to assume that you would do so.

6000|$|... "Money--an {{independent}} competence ... <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand.</b> But surely at your age, and--if {{you will}} pardon mine outspokenness--with your looks, sir, women or mayhap one woman must play some part {{in your dreams}} of the future." ...|$|E
60|$|During the {{one brief}} {{interview}} I had with him, {{for the purpose}} of further blackening her father's character (for <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> her insistence that I should see the young man), he seemed not only wholly unmoved by the facts, but was apparently sorry that poor Tedham had not done much worse things, and many more of them, that he might forgive him for her sake.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know that}} they were dead because they were dead, Baas. Their mouths and eyes were open and they lay upon their backs with their arms {{stretched}} out.

Who the Kaffirs were or why they came she did not say." ...|$|R

6000|$|... “Don’t make {{yourself}} out so hopeless,” {{she said in}} a spoilt-beauty tone. “You have your intuitions. At any rate you have a pair of eyes. You are everlastingly over there, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand.</b> Surely you have seen how far they are [...] .” ...|$|E
6000|$|She made {{a gesture}} of impatience, and went on.

You are alone in the world, without kith or kin. The only one you had--the one who {{represented}} all for you--lies buried there. Would you return thus, lonely and alone, to France?" ...|$|R
