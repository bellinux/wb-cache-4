500|$|Pleydell's {{political}} and personal life {{is marked by}} legal controversy. Almost always a defendant in court, known allegations include the forced expulsion of residents from a country manor, forcible entry into and <b>seizure</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> from a private property, unlawfully protecting convicts from justice, forging documents for his own benefit, and illegal hunting. He was alleged {{to be one of}} the ringleaders of a plot to exile Queen Mary of England, and is perhaps best known for his contentious claim of parliamentary privilege after he was found guilty of this offence in 1555, an action which caused serious disagreement between the House of Commons and the House of Lords. Legal accusations for most of his political career and imprisonment in Fleet Prison and the Tower of London helped [...] "confirm for Gabriel Pleydell a niche in parliamentary history", according to a modern historian. He died between 19 December 1590 and 3 February 1591.|$|E

50|$|Historically, English {{common law}} {{made use of}} a number of {{different}} types of legal writs to effect seizures for various reasons. For example, a writ of arrestandis bonis ne dissipentur provided for the <b>seizure</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> when it was found likely they would not be properly cared for during a court case to settle ownership. A writ of attachiamenta bonorum allowed for the seizure of personal property to recover a debt.|$|E

50|$|The court {{holds in}} the {{judgment}} that the test of whether an imported work infringes copyright is laid down in S.53 (this section allows <b>seizure</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> by the Registrar of Copyrights). The test is that whether the copy if made in India would infringe copyright? If so then it infringes upon copyright. This is because the essence of infringement is taking what is not yours. Copyright is a territorial right and has been regarded as something worth protecting in the ultimate public interest.|$|E

50|$|After Emancipation in 1829, an {{organized}} campaign {{of resistance to}} collection began. It was sufficiently successful to have a serious financial effect on the welfare of established church clergy. In 1831, the government compiled lists of defaulters and issued collection orders for the <b>seizure</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> and chattels (mostly stock). Spasmodic violence broke out {{in various parts of}} Ireland, particularly in counties Kilkenny, Tipperary and Wexford. The Irish Constabulary, which had been established in 1822, attempted to enforce the orders of seizures. At markets and fairs, the constabulary often seized stock and produce, which often resulted in violent resistance.|$|E
50|$|The United States imposes tariffs (customs duties) {{on imports}} of goods. The duty is levied {{at the time}} of import and is paid by the {{importer}} of record. Customs duties vary by country of origin and product. Goods from many countries are exempt from duty under various trade agreements. Certain types of goods are exempt from duty regardless of source. Customs rules differ from other import restrictions. Failure to properly comply with customs rules can result in <b>seizure</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> and criminal penalties against involved parties. The United States Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”) enforces customs rules.|$|E
50|$|The {{judges of}} the Court were the Barons of Exchequer who acted in both a {{judicial}} capacity, dealing with revenue cases, debts to the crown, <b>seizure</b> <b>of</b> smuggled <b>goods</b> and prosecutions for illicit brewing and distilling, {{and in an}} administrative capacity, mainly auditing accounts. The president of the Exchequer Court {{was known as the}} Chief Baron of Exchequer, and the initial president was the Lord High Treasurer. The 1707 Act limited the numbers of Barons to 5.|$|R

50|$|Historically the {{punishment}} for the usurpation of arms were severe. In Acts dated 1592 and 1672, the Court was given the full power to fine and imprison offenders. In 1669 the Court was given the power to issue letters of horning. As well as the full power: to erase unwarranted arms, to 'dash them furth of' stained-glass windows and to break unwarranted seals. Where the cases involve forfeiture, the Court could grant a warrant for the <b>seizure</b> <b>of</b> movable <b>goods</b> and gear where unwarranted arms are found.|$|R
5000|$|However, other {{countries}} have laws that enable the government to seize property with unlawful origins. Mexico and Colombia both have specific laws that define the participation in criminal organizations as a separate crime, and separate laws that allow the <b>seizure</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> related with these crimes. This latter provides a specific chapter titled [...] "International Cooperation", which instructs Mexican authorities to cooperate with foreign authorities with respect to organized crime assets within Mexico, and provides the framework by which Mexican authorities may politely request the cooperation of foreign authorities with respect to assets located outside of Mexico, in terms of any international instruments they may be party to.|$|E
50|$|He {{was one of}} {{the commissioners}} for the {{settlement}} of various claims relating to the Gunboat War dating as far back as 1807. In retaliation for the bombardment of Copenhagen, the Danish government had impounded British goods in warehouses, and merchant ships with their cargoes. Although the <b>seizure</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> on land had been settled soon afterwards, the ship-owners were still fruitlessly pursuing their claims for compensation from the British Government as late as 1861. However, with the fall of the Melbourne administration (1841) Helps' official experience closed for a period of nearly twenty years. He bought the Vernon Hill estate near Bishops Waltham, Hampshire, and a private income allowed him to turn to writing books and plays, which he dictated to an amanuensis.|$|E
50|$|After Camp Jackson was disbanded, Missouri {{was under}} martial law, and {{remained}} {{so for the}} entire Civil War. Dick served on the Board of Assessments which identified and fined Southern sympathizers. Through his participation in the <b>seizure</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> and banishment of Rebels and their families, he earned the hatred of many old St. Louisans, Conditional Unionists, and Rebels. On November 5, 1862, Dick became a lieutenant colonel and Provost Marshal General under Major General Samuel Curtis, the new Commander of the Department of Missouri. In this position, Franklin Dick had to keep order {{in the state and}} oversee the local provost marshals, enforce Curtis’s orders for the Confiscation Act, banish and assess disloyal persons, and supervise prisons and prisoners.|$|E
50|$|Lawrence was {{urged to}} apply to the Académie royale de peinture et de {{sculpture}} in Paris, but was unwilling to declare himself a Roman Catholic. To avoid, as a Protestant, <b>seizure</b> <b>of</b> his <b>goods</b> on his death, he sold his effects to Pierre Soubeyran a few days before he died, to settle his debts. He died in Paris on 8 July 1747, in the arms of Nicholas Blakey, and was buried in a timber-yard outside the Porte Saint-Antoine, then the usual place of interment for heretics. His copper plates were bought by Thomas Major and taken to England in 1753. Major left in manuscript a memoir of Lawrence, written in 1785.|$|R
25|$|Following the Israeli {{declaration}} of independence on 14 May 1948, the Permanent Boycott Committee ceased to function upon the outbreak of war between Israel and surrounding Arab States on 15 May 1948, and the Arab League repeated its calls for a ban on all financial and commercial transactions with Palestinian Jews, boycotting the newly formed State of Israel. The Arab League cut off postal, telegraphic, and radio communications with Israel, and Arab States began to impose a land, sea, and air blockade on the fledgling state. Israeli goods, shipped through Alexandria, Port Suez and Port Said, were confiscated by Egyptian inspectors. A prize court established in Alexandria in 1949 authorized the <b>seizure</b> <b>of</b> cargo ships destined for Israel. In 1950, regulations were promulgated to allow the search of ships and aircraft and the <b>seizure</b> <b>of</b> Israeli-bound <b>goods</b> found within.|$|R
50|$|The Exchequer Court (Scotland) Act 1707 {{established}} the Court of Exchequer in Scotland, with Barons of Exchequer who acted in both a judicial capacity, dealing with revenue cases, debts to the crown, <b>seizure</b> <b>of</b> smuggled <b>goods</b> and prosecutions for illicit brewing and distilling, {{and in an}} administrative capacity, mainly auditing accounts. The president of the Exchequer Court {{was known as the}} Chief Baron of Exchequer, and the initial president was the Lord High Treasurer. The 1707 Act limited the numbers of Barons to 5. A separate Exchequer Court was abolished by the Exchequer Court (Scotland) Act 1856, and all of its powers were transferred to the Court of Session. With its abolishment no further Barons of Exchequer were appointed.|$|R
5000|$|Constructive {{possession}} is also {{an important}} concept in cases of <b>seizure</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> by private or government authorities. Take, for example, a large piece of equipment. Should money be lent against the value of the equipment, and the loan goes into default, the creditor may find it difficult to actually remove the equipment in a timely manner. However, it may by notice to the borrower take constructive possession, which effectively prevents the borrower from further using the equipment pending its removal. Similarly, when a landlord exercises a contractual remedy of distraint of goods for unpaid rent, the landlord need not remove the goods from the premises, but may take constructive possession of the goods through a simple declaration. At that point, if the tenant attempted to remove them, the tenant would be guilty of theft.|$|E
5000|$|The Civil Service {{was created}} by the Provisional Government meeting on February 4, 1861, copying the same basic pattern as the {{previous}} United States federal government. The imbalance between the Union and the Confederation led to a [...] "total war" [...] setting for the Confederates, with all resources dedicated towards the war. This included conscription, radical taxation and the <b>seizure</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods,</b> and as such the Treasury and War departments were heavily expanded during the War to cope with the work. Of the 70,000-odd employees of the Confederate Civil Service {{over the course of the}} war, 57,124 worked for the Department of War. The Department employed large numbers of African-Americans, children and women, and without these they would have been unable to deal with the war work. The Civil Service ceased to exist in 1865, when the Confederacy was dissolved.|$|E
50|$|Officers {{from the}} {{department}} of Labour and Industry repeatedly fined Penhalluriack for his breaches of the law, and the whole issue gained considerable local media attention. When he refused to pay he volunteered himself to spend time in jail, and was arrested by the Caulfield Police, who transferred him to the Glenferrie Road Malvern cell behind the Police Station. The next day he was transferred to Pentridge, where he was classified as a nuisance, and returned to his freedom. He was re-arrested at his shop the following Sunday, and spent a further 19 days incarceration. in HM Prison Pentridge This was bad publicity for the State Government, who changed the law to give priority to the <b>seizure</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods.</b> When Penhalluriack refused to pay further fines the courts compelled the police to auction his stock to raise funds to pay the fine; the auction was a farce, with grateful shoppers paying many times the market price for the goods auctioned.|$|E
50|$|Fuentes v. Shevin, 407 U.S. 67 (1972), {{was a case}} {{decided by}} the Supreme Court of the United States wherein petitioners {{challenged}} {{the constitutionality of the}} Uniform Commercial Code provisions of two states, Florida and Pennsylvania, which allowed for the summary <b>seizure</b> <b>of</b> a person's <b>goods</b> or chattels under a writ of replevin. The statutes were challenged under the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court held that the statutes acted as deprivations of plaintiff's property without due process.|$|R
5000|$|John II Grimaldi, {{inducted}} into the fiefdom of Levens on 15 May 1543, took an oath of fealty to the Duke of Savoy Emmanuel Philibert, only to immediately betray him and fight with the Franco-Turkish troops during the siege of Nice. Convicted of treason, John II was condemned to banishment and <b>seizure</b> <b>of</b> his <b>goods.</b> By an act dated 22 October 1550, the inhabitants of Leventio purchased directly from their Savoyard overlord the flour mills and deficis (olive oil mills) for 1,200 gold Italian crowns. However, after a 14-year period of roaming and making amends, John II's title deeds were restored to him on 8 December 1557, provoking anger among the inhabitants and making the Grimaldi family unpopular for a while.|$|R
50|$|In England, {{conviction}} {{under the}} statute {{led to the}} confiscation of the convict's movable possessions. For those convicted of attempting to hide or aid convicted smugglers, the statute called {{for them to be}} tried as a felon within one year and for a minimum sentence of seven years, which was customary for most transportation sentences. Should that person attempt to return they would be subject to the death penalty without the benefit of clergy. Also stated in the act was that one hundred pounds would be awarded for every person killed in the course <b>of</b> <b>seizure</b> <b>of</b> illegal <b>goods,</b> wool, etc. If the felon did not report within the forty days, those who apprehended the felon were to be paid a sum of five hundred pounds within a month after the execution.|$|R
