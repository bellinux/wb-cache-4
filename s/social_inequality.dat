40|$|Despite growing {{interest}} in integrating people’s daily mobility into contextual studies of <b>social</b> <b>inequalities</b> in health, the links between daily mobility and health inequalities remain inadequately conceptualized. This conceptual proposal anchors the relationship between daily mobility and contextual influences on <b>social</b> <b>inequalities</b> in health into the concept of mobility potential, which encompasses the opportunities and places individuals can choose (or are constrained) to access. Mobility potential is realized as actual mobility through agency. Being shaped by sociallypatterned personal and geographic characteristics, mobility potential is unequally distributed across <b>social</b> groups. <b>Social</b> <b>inequalities</b> in realized mobility may thus result. We discuss pathways by which these may contribute to contextual influences on <b>social</b> <b>inequalities</b> in health.

The dominance of medicine in public health, through its often implicit assumptions about the biological determinants of human behaviour, is also identified as a barrier to teaching <b>social</b> <b>inequalities</b> in health. Educational elitism, which restricts higher education to members of the upper middle class, is identified as another barrier to teaching <b>social</b> <b>inequalities</b> in health. On the other hand, teachers in this field can benefit from a recent growth of empirical studies during the last decade aimed at understanding the social determinants of health inequalities. Finally, I suggest that familiarity with current critical scholarship within public health, as well as the use of techniques developed by sociologists to teach social stratification, can be valuable resources for teaching <b>social</b> <b>inequalities</b> in health...|$|R

The following year, it passed the Coinage Act of 1792, establishing the United States Mint, and the United States dollar, and regulating the coinage of the United States. Historian Samuel Morison points to Hamilton's Second Report as the event that precipitated Jefferson's change of attitude toward Hamilton and his policies.

40|$|<b>Social</b> <b>inequalities</b> {{in health}} remain a major social issue globally. One {{possible}} explanation of health inequality is health selection: {{in other words}} people with poor health move down the social hierarchy. This study started with the conceptual distinction between two types of health selection studies. Type I health selection study (the presence of health selection) examines the impact of poor health on the subsequent social mobility. On the contrary, type II study (the contribution of health selection to <b>social</b> <b>inequalities</b> in health) examines whether health selection changes <b>social</b> <b>inequalities</b> in health. The first 13 waves (1991 - 2003) of the British Household Panel Survey with 63599 observations from 8819 individuals were used. In accordance with the typology, two different approaches were applied to empirical and theoretical investigation. For type I study, a multilevel multinomial model to fit all possible transition from multiple origins {{was used to assess}} social mobility with regard to health status. For type II study, both empirical and hypothetical analyses are applied in order to address the relationship between social mobility, health selection, and <b>social</b> <b>inequalities</b> in health on the population-level framework. Findings from the type I study presented that health selection was negligible in mobility within employment indicated by class and income measures, although it was highly significant in the transition between employment and non-employment. In type II study, changes in <b>social</b> <b>inequalities</b> in health were associated with a set of elements extracted from a social mobility process. Varying levels of health selection and scales of social mobility result in different extents of change in <b>social</b> <b>inequalities</b> in health. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background: <b>Social</b> <b>inequalities</b> {{in health}} {{have over the}} last decades been {{documented}} in Europe and North America. These inequalities pose a major public health challenge. In Norway these inequalities are largest in the capital Oslo. Methods: A critical review of the current knowledge/existing literature on <b>social</b> <b>inequalities</b> in health in Norway’s capital Oslo. Included in the review are studies which use income, education or occupation as a socioeconomic variable. Included are also studies which look at contextual effects of place of residence on the <b>social</b> <b>inequalities</b> in health. The studies are discussed in relation to similar international studies. Results: The review shows that the <b>social</b> <b>inequalities</b> in health in Oslo are well documented {{and that they are}} large and in some respects expanding. The studies which have looked at possible explanations have mostly looked on the effects of exposure or socioeconomic class at different stages during the life course or at contextual effects. No studies which look at interventions were found. Conclusions: The <b>social</b> <b>inequalities</b> in health in Oslo are large. Despite higher research activity in the recent decade there is still a need for a larger effort to find the causal mechanisms and a more coordinated strategy to combat the inequalities. The establishment of an interdisciplinary center of expertise and topics to focus on in future research are suggested...|$|R
40|$|Diet is a {{major risk}} factor for non-communicable {{diseases}} (NCDs) and is also strongly patterned by socioeconomic factors. Whether interventions promoting healthy eating reduce <b>social</b> <b>inequalities</b> in diet in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) remains uncertain. This paper aims to summarize current evidence on interventions promoting healthy eating in LMICs, and to establish whether they reduce <b>social</b> <b>inequalities</b> in diet. Systematic review of cross-sectional or quasi-experimental studies (pre- and post-assessment of interventions) in Pubmed, Scielo and Google Scholar databases, including adults in LMICs, assessing at least one outcome of healthy eating and showing results stratified by socioeconomic status. Seven intervention studies including healthy eating promotion, conducted in seven LMICs (Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Iran, Panama, Trinidad and Tobago, and Tunisia), met our inclusion criteria. To promote healthy eating, all interventions used nutrition education and three of them combined nutrition education with improved acces to foods or social support. Interventions targeted mostly women and varied widely regarding communication tools and duration of the nutrition education sessions. Most interventions used printed material, media use or face-to-face training and lasted from 6  weeks to 5  years. Four interventions targeted disadvantaged populations, and three targeted the entire population. In {{three out of four}} interventions targeting disadvantaged populations, healthy eating outcomes were improved suggesting they were likely to reduce <b>social</b> <b>inequalities</b> in diet. All interventions directed to the entire population showed improved healthy eating outcomes in all social strata, and were considered as having no impact on <b>social</b> <b>inequalities</b> in diet. In LMICs, agentic interventions promoting healthy eating reduced <b>social</b> <b>inequalities</b> in diet when specifically targeting disadvantaged populations. Further research should assess the impact on <b>social</b> <b>inequalities</b> in diet of a combination of agentic and structural approaches in interventions promoting healthy eating...|$|R

40|$|There are <b>social</b> <b>inequalities</b> {{in health}} – poor and less educated adults experi- ence worse health and shorter life spans than richer and better educated adults. These inequalities are also {{observed}} in youth, where adolescents {{with a low}} so- cial position have fewer chances in life and inferior living conditions compared with adolescents with a high social position. Health-related behaviour is usually established during late childhood and adolescence, and risk behaviour might continue in adult life, so that social disparities in lifestyle manifest themselves later in life as <b>social</b> <b>inequalities</b> in morbidity and mortality rates. But how to decrease <b>social</b> <b>inequalities</b> in health remains relatively unexplored. Therefore, we find it highly relevant to investigate how <b>social</b> <b>inequalities</b> in adolescents’ health can be reduced. <b>Social</b> <b>inequalities</b> in health have long been recognised and during the last decades this has attracted keen attention in the Danish research and policy arenas; however, the attention has not led to greater equity in health. In this master thesis we focus on <b>social</b> <b>inequalities</b> in adolescent’s health and the possibilities of reducing the inequity by health-promoting interventions in school. The thesis consists of three sections. In the first section we begin by exploring the term social equity in health, {{the causes of the}} inequalities, and the political strategies. The second section deals with youth and health behaviour and it has a qualitative and quantitative approach. Through focus group interviews with adolescents in the 9 th grade, we got an insight into how adolescents experience their daily life and health. The aim of the quantitative analysis was to explore <b>social</b> <b>inequalities</b> in health among Danish adolescents and for that purpose we used data from the Danish Youth Cohort, a national representative study including more than 5000 students carried out in 2004 - 2007. In our analysis we used three different categories to measure social position: Fam- ily Affluent Scale (FAS), parents’ education and parents’ attachment to the labour market, and we included a broad range of health measures. The third section deals with health-promoting interventions in school and the potential of the interventions to diminish the <b>social</b> <b>inequalities</b> in health. This section is based on interviews with school principals and on a case study of two large healthpromoting interventions – “Tackling” and “The Health-Promoting School” – which have been carried out in a number of Danish schools. The thesis concludes that <b>social</b> <b>inequalities</b> in health among adolescents is a major problem that calls for action. It further concludes that health-promoting interventions in school can contribute to the reduction of <b>social</b> <b>inequalities</b> in health. The conclusion can be summarised into the following points: It is not always clear what is meant by the terms social, equity and health, and the picture of social variations in health that can be observed depends on the measurement of these terms. Therefore, the definition of social equity in health has important consequences for what inequities and political solutions that emerge. In this thesis we define social inequity in health as a systematic relation between <b>social</b> positions and <b>inequalities</b> in health. Our analysis show large <b>social</b> <b>inequalities</b> in health behaviour (smoking, diet and physical activity) and well-being (self-reported health, bullying and wellbeing at school) among Danish adolescents. The inequity is primarily manifested as a social gradient that runs right across society, so that even middleclass adolescents have poorer health behaviour and well-being than adolescents {{at the top of the}} social hierarchy. The school provides an important arena for preventing <b>social</b> <b>inequalities</b> in health, as the school reaches adolescents from all social groups of society. But to be an ideal field for prevention, more political will and financial support is needed. To tackle <b>social</b> <b>inequalities,</b> health-promoting interventions must have an inclusive approach to avoid stigmatisation and they should deal with health topics that will benefit those in poorer social circumstances the most. Furthermore, interventions have to be tailored to suit the Danish school system, which is charged with numerous responsibilities besides health concerns and suffers from a lack of resources. A range of social, environmental and cultural determinants contribute to the socially determined inequalities in health. Therefore a multisectoral and multifaceted approach is needed to tackle the problem. Health-promoting interventions in school can be a part of the solution...|$|R

40|$|Education {{is a major}} {{instrument}} for personal, social and institutional development. However, the different social allocation of educational opportunities may also maintain, or even worsen, <b>social</b> <b>inequalities.</b> Indeed, the differences in educational chances, particularly in terms of educational credentialism, especially when combined with gender issues, ethnical perspectives and effective opportunities of democratic participation, represent {{one of the main}} generative factors of contemporary hybrid “classless” inequality, leading to direct consequences on the general socioeconomic social stratification. The largely debated question is about whether educational system could effectively overcome <b>social</b> <b>inequalities,</b> or just merely reflect or even intensify them. Due to the multidimensional nature of contemporary inequality, the crucial questions remain whether, how and at to what extent society, institutions and organizations determine advantages and disadvantages in individual educational opportunities, reproducing <b>social</b> <b>inequalities.</b> This implies analyzing how societal conditions (like overall levels of inequality, welfare regime type, labor market features, demographics) represent incentives and opportunities or, on the contrary, limitations regarding educational attainment and, more in general, individual well-being and life satisfaction (considering, for example, educational career, entry into the labor market, occupational attainment, working conditions, family formation). Although structural constraints could {{play an important role in}} determining individual achievement (in education, in labor market, in his/her life), it is also important to consider the exercise of an individual’s agency to overcome barriers and difficulties that influence the opportunities to achieve his/her purposes. Within such setting, it is crucial to examine critically both the reasons and outcomes of education reforms, policy changes and transformations, as well to analyze the models of accountability, quality and school effectiveness to cope with problems of inequality. Considering the current global financial crisis and the shaping of new forms of <b>social</b> <b>inequalities,</b> it is important to re-elaborate the relationships between education and <b>social</b> <b>inequalities,</b> improving education as an opportunity for individuals to overcome <b>social</b> <b>inequalities,</b> enhancing their personal capabilities for employability and overall well-being. The aim of the special issue was to bring together scientists from different social sciences (including sociology, economics and education) to develop an interdisciplinary understanding on how characteristics of educational systems (primary, secondary and tertiary education) are related to various sorts of <b>social</b> <b>inequalities,</b> promoting the sharing of theoretical and empirical reflections...|$|R
