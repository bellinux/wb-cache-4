50|$|Viničko Kale is {{an ancient}} ruin located on the hill above the town of Vinica, Republic of Macedonia. It {{is located on the}} left side of the Grdečka River, on a hill about 400 meters above <b>sea</b> level. Viničko <b>Kale</b> was {{discovered}} in 1954. In 1978, 5 fragments of terra-cotta icons were discovered in Viničko Kale, which shows that it was inhabited from Neolithic times to the Middle Ages.|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this research}} were to determine the quantities of nitrate, nitrite and oxalate in two vegetables those are popular at Black <b>Sea</b> coast namely <b>kale</b> and sultana pea. The results were compared with the contents of spinach and chard. Simultaneous determination of nitrate, nitrite and oxalate was conducted with capillary electrophoresis by using an acidic run buffer to reverse the electroosmotic flow. Full factorial design with three variables was applied to decide the optimum capillary electrophoretic experimental conditions. The limit of detection was improved by large volume sample stacking. The average amount of nitrate in fresh kale leaves (2016 ± 519 mg kg‾ 1) was greater than spinach and lower than chard. The nitrite ion concentrations were much more in the leaves of kale (111 ± 4 mg kg‾ 1) than in stalks on the contrary of chard. Oxalate content was lower in kale (2970 ± 672 mg kg‾ 1) than in spinach and chard...|$|R

50|$|The shingle beach habitat {{contains}} some flora {{that has a}} very limited coverage within Cornwall, {{as well as the}} rest of the UK. Examples include Babington's orache (Atriplex glabriuscula), Ray’s knotgrass (Polygonum oxyspermum), sand couch (Elymus farctus), sea bindweed (Calystegia soldanella), <b>sea</b> <b>kale</b> (Crambe maritima), sea spurge (Euphorbia paralias) and sea sandwort (Honckenya peploides).|$|E
50|$|The shingle ridge {{supports}} a maritime plant community; species present here include <b>sea</b> <b>kale,</b> sea beet, sea campion, thrift and yellow horned poppy. Around {{the edges of}} the lagoon, saltmarsh plant communities are present, with species such as sea aster, sea purslane, Danish scurvygrass and saltmarsh oraches. Grey mullet are found in the lagoon.|$|E
50|$|Historically the site's {{status as}} a {{military}} base provided a degree of protection for the local flora. The large scale construction of car parks, beach-huts and the importation of topsoil has reduced the range of plants present. Crambe maritima (<b>sea</b> <b>kale)</b> still grows on the spit and in the 19th century it was apparently harvested for sale in Southampton.|$|E
50|$|The {{nature reserve}} covers a sandy {{peninsula}} in the Baltic Sea with beach meadows and a shallow coastline. It {{is an important}} habitat for migratory birds who rest here between July and September. The coastal meadows also provide a habitat for several unusual plants, including Gentianella uliginosa, sea thrift, Centaurium littorale, sea plantain and <b>sea</b> <b>kale</b> among others.|$|E
5000|$|Trévou-Tréguignec has two beaches, Royau and Trestel (Breton traezh, fine sand). Trestel, {{the nude}} beach, attracts many summer {{visitors}} and flew the European Blue flag (indicating environmental quality) from 1998 to 2004. There {{is also a}} Thalassotherapy center.

50|$|The {{village of}} West Bexington {{provides}} access to the Chesil Beach. The West Bexington nature reserve {{is one of the}} Dorset Wildlife Trust's few coastal reserves. It is internationally important because of the rare vegetated shingle habitat that thrives here (Rock Samphire, Sea Beet, Sea Campion, <b>Sea</b> <b>Kale,</b> Tree Mallow, Tufted Vetch, Wild Carrot, Wild Parsnip, Woody Nightshade, Yellow Horned Poppy and Yellow Iris).|$|E
50|$|A wash margin or wash fringe (Spülsaum) {{is an area}} of {{the shore}} on which {{material}} is deposited or washed up. It often runs along the margin of a waterbody and there can be several bands due to variations in water levels. As a result of the richness of nutrients that occur in such wash fringes, ruderal species frequently occur here, that, for example, on the Baltic Sea coast consist of grassleaf orache and <b>sea</b> <b>kale.</b>|$|E
50|$|Along {{the coast}} of England, where it is {{commonly}} found above high tide mark on shingle beaches, local people heaped loose shingle around the naturally occurring root crowns in springtime, thus blanching the emerging shoots. By the early eighteenth century, it had become established as a garden vegetable, but its height of popularity was {{the early nineteenth century}} when <b>sea</b> <b>kale</b> appeared in Thomas Jefferson's Garden Book of 1809. It was also served at the Royal Pavilion in Brighton, when Prince Regent George IV of the United Kingdom (1762-1830) used it as a seaside retreat.|$|E
50|$|In the United Kingdom, {{colonies of}} Helicobasidium purpureum {{have been found}} on the living stems of dog's mercury (Mercurialis perennis) and {{stinging}} nettle (Urtica dioica). The fungus is also associated as a saprobe with decaying wood and stumps of broad leaf trees. Its rhizoctonian anamorph infects the roots of carrot (Daucus carota), parsnip (Pastinaca sativa), swede (Brassica napus ssp rapifera), turnip (Brassica rapa), celery (Apium graveolens), asparagus (Asparagus officinalis), beetroot (Beta vulgaris), potato (Solanum tuberosum) and <b>sea</b> <b>kale</b> (Crambe maritima). Wild plants on which {{it has been found}} felting the roots with purple or brown mycelium include chickweed (Stellaria) spp., sow thistles (Sonchus) spp., nettles (Urtica) spp., shepherd's purse (Capsella bursa-pastoris) and yarrow (Achillea millefolium).|$|E
50|$|In {{the nature}} reserve, there are plant species like bladder campion, harebell, Armeria maritima, <b>sea</b> <b>kale,</b> Glaux, Seriphidium maritimum, sea sandwort, and Gentianella uliginosa. The shore meadows of Western Getterön {{were used for}} grazing until the mid-1960s. When the grazing stopped, the {{landscape}} didn't grow to, because of the thin soil. Since 1998, the area is used for grazing again. Western Getterön is also a birdwatching site, mostly for seabirds and migratory birds, even if Getterön Nature Reserve {{on the other side}} of Getterön is more well-known and situated closer to Varberg. Northern gannet, northern fulmar, auks, parasitic jaeger, and European storm-petrel are some species that have been observed at Western Getterön.|$|E
50|$|Vegetation such as Marram Grass is {{essential}} for dunes to work, dominating the stabilised parts of the dunes. Other grasses that grow there include Dune Fescue and Red Fescue. Dogs off leads can easily run around the dunes, and destroy the vegetation. Horses being ridden over the dunes will have a similar effect. The Climping dunes are an SSSI (Site of Special Scientific Interest). In 2006 {{the total number of}} full species at Climping Gap stood at 256. It supports important populations of wintering birds and the numbers of wintering Sanderling, in particular, are of European significance. Vegetated shingle beaches are a nationally uncommon habitat. The beach at Climping is broad in the west but narrows to the east. Plant communities include Yellow horned poppy, <b>Sea</b> <b>Kale,</b> Sea Beet, Curled Dock, Eryngium maritimum, Sand Catchfly, Viper’s Bugloss and Nottingham Catchfly.|$|E
5000|$|Wingletang Down is 28.9 ha of {{maritime}} heath, {{dune grassland}} and scrub reaching a maximum height of 20 m above sea-level {{and is considered}} by Plantlife to be an Important Plant Area. Due to exposure to salt-laden winds, wind-pruned or [...] "waved" [...] maritime heath has developed on the low nutrient, shallow soils on the higher land, whilst to the south on the deeper sandy soils close to sea-level dune grassland grows. At the southern promontory of Horse Point there is short maritime grass and a tumble of large granite boulders where shallow temporary brackish pools occur. Sea milkwort (Glaux maritima) is a rare plant in Scilly and grows here. Sand sedge (Carex arenaria) and sand couch (Elytrigia juncea) dominate the dune grassland between Wingletang Bay and Porth Askin whilst flowering plants include common storksbill (Erodium cicutarium), Portland spurge (Euphorbia portlandica) and hemlock water dropwort (Oenanthe crocata) which is unusual here as it usually grows in wet habitats. At Beady Pool, {{which is part of}} Wingletang Bay, <b>sea</b> <b>kale</b> (Crambe maritima) grows on the strandline along with yellow horned poppy (Glaucium flavum) and sea spurge (E paralias). There is a colony of Six-spot Burnet (Zygaena filipendulae) here and in the past Ringed Plover (Charadrius hiaticula) nested. The nationally scarce (but common on all the inhabited islands) early meadow grass (Poa infirma) grows in the short maritime grass west of Porth Askin.|$|E
40|$|Clubroot is a {{very serious}} disease of cabbage and closely related crops. The most {{susceptible}} crops include cabbage, Chinese cabbage, Brussels sprouts and some cultivars of turnip. Other related crops that may also be attacked include kohlrabi, kale, cauliflower, collards, broccoli, rutabaga, <b>sea</b> <b>kale,</b> all turnips, and radishes. Weeds in the mustard family may be infected and result in enhanced disease problems on the susceptible crops. The symptoms first noticed will be a decline of the plant including yellowing of leaves, and a tendency to wilt during hot days. Examination of the roots will reveal swollen, club-shaped roots instead of the normal fine network of roots (Fig. 1). In severe cases most roots will be affected (Fig. 2). The swollen roots will begin to decay and eventually disintegrate. Symptoms and Signs Figure 2 : Close-up of the club shaped roots. Clubroot is caused by the fungus Plasmodiophora brassicae. The important features of its life history include its longevity in soil, means of spread, and its reaction to soil pH. After the disease has occurred, the fungus can survive from seven to ten years without any susceptible plant ever being grown there. If any susceptible crops or weeds grow during this period, the fungus may become more prevalent...|$|E
