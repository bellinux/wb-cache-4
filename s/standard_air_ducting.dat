The distribution systems were retrofitted as part of this study and the impact of retrofitting on furnace performance is discussed. In addition to field measurements, this paper will discuss how forced-air furnace systems are treated in proposed ASHRAE Standard 152 P, and applies the resulting equations to the systems tested in the field. The distribution system calculations in Standard 152 P are compared to the current methods employed in the “Furnaces ” chapter of ASHRAE’s HVAC Systems and Equipment Handbook, showing how the distribution system efficiencies calculated using Standard 152 P can be incorporated into the handbook.

40|$|Background: High-voltage <b>air</b> <b>ducts</b> is the {{government}} program to supply electricity needs. However, in practice, obstacles {{have been identified in}} the form of rejection from the community due to the outstanding issues that high-voltage <b>air</b> <b>ducts</b> have an impact on health. Aim: This research aims to analysis the magnitude of electromagnetic wave radiation of high-voltage <b>air</b> <b>ducts</b> construction on health. Methods: The study was conducted by measuring electromagnetic wave radiation prior to high-voltage <b>air</b> <b>ducts</b> (150 kV) construction and predicting the amount of radiation generated after this operation and its impact on health. Result: The field measurement result showed that the highest strength of magnetic field in the absence of construction and operation activity of high-voltage <b>air</b> <b>ducts</b> 150 kV was 0. 00085 mT and the highest electric field was 0. 004241251 V/m. The results of the magnetic field strength analysis showed that the highest strength of magnetic field and electric field when the high-voltage <b>air</b> <b>ducts</b> is completed and operated was magnetic field of 0. 00415 mT and electric field of 38. 4 V/m. The value was far lower than the standard limits recommended by IRPA / INIRC, WHO 1990 and SNI 04 - 6950 - 2003. The allowed electric field strength is 5 kV / m and the allowed magnetic field strength is 0. 1 mT. Conclusion: Electromagnetic wave radiation of High-Voltage <b>Air</b> <b>Ducts</b> is not exceeded the allowed limit, so it will not cause a direct risk to health. ...|$|R

Despite of Turkish <b>standards</b> on <b>air</b> <b>duct</b> are present, studies on energy consumption associated with air leakage are very rare in Turkey, on the contrary to many developed countries. In this study, the subject of preventing energy losses related to the leakage, which causes inefficient working condition, has been investigated. Firstly, <b>air</b> <b>duct</b> system and quality requirements have been explained and the main standards have been analyzed for airtightness of air distribution systems, as well. Secondly, duct system measurements have been conducted by choosing two different approaches. One approach covers leakage calculation of a single duct by using European Standard called Eurovent, whereas the other one divides the system into single sections and uses the Power Law Model for calculation of leakage occurred in each section. Single duct leakage measurements were made on 300 mm and 1000 mm diameter circular ducts and 300 mm by 250 mm and 1000 mm by 500 mm flanged joint rectangular ducts for positive internal pressures. Test results showed that duct leakage depends on the method of duct fabrication, method of sealing, workmanship and static pressure differential. Furthermore, calculated leakage factors were under the allowable leakage limits in classification. C. for rectangular and circular ducts that were produced by Venco A. Ş. Comparing rectangular to circular ducts both had the same length of seam and surface area; the leakage from circular ducts was less than 80 % from rectangular <b>ducts.</b> The <b>air</b> leakage from all test ducts, with the same lock seam type, decreases, whereas the surface area increases. Branched duct leakage measurements were made on 300 mm and 630 mm diameter circular ducts and 300 mm by 200 mm and 500 mm by 300 mm rectangular <b>ducts</b> and also <b>air</b> distribution system for positive internal pressures. Test results showed that fittings in a system cause sudden changes in static pressure; therefore, duct leakage depends on fitting locations. The leakage rate in Spiro sealed system was less than 5 % Trelleborg sealed system. The leakage measured in {{this study showed that}} seam leakage accounts from 14 % to 20 % of the total in the two rectangular ducts and from 8 % to 13 % for the round ducts with Pittsburgh and Spiral lock seams. These data show that the joints are the major source of duct leakage. Improvement in duct construction leading to duct systems with less leakage will need to focus on better joints.

40|$|The {{underground}} <b>air</b> <b>ducts</b> along peripheral {{walls of}} a building are a remediation method, which principle is to enable an air flow along the moist building structure’s surface to allow a sufficient evaporation of moisture from the structure. This measure reduces the water transport (rising moisture) into the higher parts of the wall where the high water content in masonry is undesirable. Presently, underground <b>air</b> <b>ducts</b> are designed as masonry structures, which durability in contact with ground moisture is limited. The article describes a new design of an underground <b>air</b> <b>duct,</b> {{which is based on}} specially shaped concrete blocks (without wet processes, because the blocks are completely precast). The <b>air</b> <b>duct</b> from concrete blocks is situated completely below the ground surface (exterior) or below the floor (interior).

This paper discusses a simple analytical method for the calculation of the energy saving achievable by using ventilated facades in which the air flow inside the <b>air</b> <b>duct</b> is due to stack effect. Two particular cases of outstanding importance are investigated. The first in which the inner masonry wall is given, and the <b>air</b> <b>duct</b> and the outer facing have to be optimized.

The first case can occur in existing buildings renovation, while the second case can occur during the design process. Finally, {{the influence of the}} variation of some quantities necessary for calculation on the energy performance of ventilated facades is investigated.

40|$|This study explores {{a method}} of {{generating}} electricity while recovering waste heat through the integration of heat pipes and thermoelectric generators (i. e. HPTEG system). The simultaneous waste heat recovery and power generation processes are achieved {{without the use of}} any moving parts. The HPTEG system consists of bismuth telluride thermoelectric generators (TEG), which are sandwiched between two finned pipes to achieve a temperature gradient across the TEG for electricity generation. A counter-flow heat exchanger was built using two separate <b>air</b> <b>ducts.</b> The <b>air</b> <b>ducts</b> were thermally coupled using the HPTEG modules. The evaporator section of the heat pipe absorbed the waste heat in a hot <b>air</b> <b>duct.</b> The heat was then transferred across the TEG surfaces. The condenser section of the HPTEG collected the excess heat from the TEG cold side before releasing it to the cold <b>air</b> <b>duct.</b> A 2 -kW electrical heater was installed in the hot <b>air</b> <b>duct</b> to simulate the exhaust gas.
