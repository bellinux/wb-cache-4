5|$|At {{the end of}} the film, Arroway is {{put into}} a {{position}} that she had traditionally viewed with <b>skepticism</b> <b>and</b> contempt: that of believing something with complete certainty, despite being unable to prove it in the face of not only widespread incredulity and skepticism (which she admits that as a scientist she would normally share) but also evidence apparently to the contrary.|$|E

5|$|Early modern Europe saw the {{emergence}} {{for the first}} time of a distinctive elite culture: while the Reformation encouraged new <b>skepticism</b> <b>and</b> opposition to traditional beliefs, subsequent Romanticism encouraged the fetishisation of such beliefs by intellectual elites. The effects of this on writing about elves are most apparent in England and Germany, with developments in each country influencing the other. In Scandinavia, the Romantic movement was also prominent, and literary writing was the main context for continued use of the word elf, except in fossilised words for illnesses. However, oral traditions about beings like elves remained prominent in Scandinavia into the early twentieth century.|$|E

5|$|The Reformation brought {{changes in}} outlook and artistic {{expression}} as secular and landscape imagery overtook biblical scenes. Sacred imagery {{was shown in}} a didactic and moralistic manner, with religious figures becoming marginalized and relegated to the background. Pieter Bruegel the Elder, {{one of the few}} who followed Bosch's style, is an important bridge between the Early Netherlandish artists and their successors. His work retains many 15th-century conventions, but his perspective and subjects are distinctly modern. Sweeping landscapes came to the fore in paintings that were provisionally religious or mythological, and his genre scenes were complex, with overtones of religious <b>skepticism</b> <b>and</b> even hints of nationalism.|$|E
5|$|Article 20 {{provides}} {{protection from}} conviction for offences in certain respects, including the rights against {{ex post facto}} laws, double jeopardy and freedom from self-incrimination. Article 22 provides specific rights to arrested and detained persons, in particular the rights to be informed of the grounds of arrest, consult a lawyer of one's own choice, be produced before a magistrate within 24 hours of the arrest, and the freedom not to be detained beyond that period without an order of the magistrate. The Constitution also authorizes the State to make laws providing for preventive detention, subject to certain other safeguards present in Article 22. The provisions pertaining to preventive detention were discussed with <b>skepticism</b> <b>and</b> misgivings by the Constituent Assembly, and were reluctantly approved after a few amendments in 1949. Article 22 provides that {{when a person is}} detained under any law of preventive detention, the State can detain such person without trial for only three months, and any detention for a longer period must be authorised by an Advisory Board. The person being detained also has the right to be informed about the grounds of detention, and be permitted to make a representation against it, at the earliest opportunity.|$|E
