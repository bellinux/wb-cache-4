The third subsection of Section 6 discusses the control of the amount of signal clipping. After presenting the initial clipping solution, thanks to the <b>saturation</b> <b>control,</b> we propose a better solution for signal clipping control. It can be intuitively understood that when the <b>saturation</b> <b>control</b> is operating well, the clipping of the peak signal values can be more refined, making less annoying artifacts. The principle is based on balancing between the highest-dynamic range with the limited amount of clipping. These special modes in combination with multiple-exposure techniques will prepare the camera signal for the succeeding steps in the processing on tone mapping and enhancement functionalities, which are discussed in the remainder of this paper.|$|E

As a consequence, AB now becomes a feed-forward loop which is much more stable and easier to control. An additional benefit of having the AB control loop separated from the ET control loop is that no additional clipping of the signal is introduced due to the corresponding level rectification (compensation of lowered video level {{as a result of the}} AB control) by means of the gain control (or perhaps increased lens opening or longer exposure time). When <b>saturation</b> <b>control</b> is performed (as explained in Section 6), the lens opening will be close to optimal (without introducing additional clipping), and so compensation for the intensity level drop due to the AB control becomes obsolete.|$|E

The actuator and sensor of the device are allowed in the pivot and joints of the double pendulum. The nonlinear <b>saturation</b> <b>control</b> (NSC) is based in the order second differential equations and its action in the pivot/joint of the robotic arm is through of quadratic nonlinearities feedback signals. The optimal linear feedback control (OLFC) involves the application of two control signals, a nonlinear feedforward control to maintain the controlled system to a desired periodic orbit, and control a feedback control to bring the trajectory of the system to the desired orbit. Simulation results, including of uncertainties show the feasibility of the both methods, for chaos control of the considered system. ...|$|E

40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in the journal, Science China Information Sciences [© Science China Press and Springer-Verlag]. The definitive version is available at: [URL] this paper, the adaptive fuzzy tracking control is proposed for a class of multi-input and multioutput (MIMO) nonlinear systems in the presence of system uncertainties, unknown non-symmetric input saturation and external disturbances. Fuzzy logic systems (FLS) are used to approximate the system uncertainty of MIMO nonlinear systems. Then, the compound disturbance containing the approximation error and the time-varying external disturbance that cannot be directly measured are estimated via a disturbance observer. By appropriately choosing the gain matrix, the disturbance observer can approximate the compound disturbance well and the estimate error converges to a compact set. This control strategy is further extended to develop adaptive fuzzy tracking control for MIMO nonlinear systems by coping with practical issues in engineering applications, in particular unknown non-symmetric input <b>saturation</b> and <b>control</b> singularity. Within this setting, the disturbance observer technique is combined with the FLS approximation technique to compensate for the effects of unknown input <b>saturation</b> and <b>control</b> singularity.
