40|$|Most people {{judge the}} size of cities simply from their circumference. So that when one says that Megalopolis is fifty <b>stades</b> in contour and Sparta forty-eight, but that Sparta is {{twice as large as}} Megalopolis, what is said seems {{unbelievable}} to them. And when in order to puzzle them even more, one tells them that a city or camp with the circumference of forty <b>stades</b> may be twice as large as one of the circumference of which is one hundred <b>stades,</b> what is said seems to them absolutely astounding. The reason of this is that we have forgotten the lessons in geometry we learnt as children...|$|R
