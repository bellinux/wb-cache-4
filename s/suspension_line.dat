50|$|Due to the {{elongated}} {{shape of}} the city and the terrain conditions, the trolleybus network was planned along main streets. The network is powered with overhead lines because most of the network is located on wide, bi-directional streets.

From 1998, the overhead lines began to be overhauled with modern <b>suspension</b> <b>lines</b> produced by the Czech company Elektroline. Almost 80% of overhead line intersections and junctions were replaced with new parts. These new parts allow trolleybuses to use greater speeds.

5000|$|Robinson's Disengaging Gear {{was used}} in the Royal Navy through the 1970s in the Type 12 frigates, the Leander class frigates, and the County class guided missile destroyers.

[...] After that time the Royal Navy wanted to reduce the overall crew size on ships, and so switched to smaller seaboats, launched from a single wire crane.

50|$|The {{recovery}} sequence {{begins with}} {{the operation of the}} high-altitude baroswitch, which triggers the pyrotechnic nose cap thrusters.
