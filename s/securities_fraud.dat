40|$|This article {{analyses}} {{the representation}} of social <b>security</b> <b>fraud</b> in the UK's Department for Work and Pensions' (DWP) television advertising campaign between 2000 and 2004. The article discusses the campaign {{in the context of}} New Labour's concerns with social <b>security</b> <b>fraud</b> and observes that the ostensible aim of the television advertisements was to deter social <b>security</b> <b>fraud.</b> The article then moves on to discuss the difficulties of the advertising campaign in meeting this aim in the context of what is known about the nature of social <b>security</b> <b>fraud.</b> Since the 1970 s, the mass media in the UK has been fascinated by social <b>security</b> <b>fraud</b> (Golding and Middleton, 1982; Golding, 1999). However, since the year 2000 there has been a further media representation of social security fraud; the anti-fraud advertisement. Despite recent literature commenting on 'fraud in the public domain' (Sainsbury, 2003, pp 290 – 92) the anti-fraud advertisements have received no analytical attention. This article addresses this issue by focusing on the 'Targeting fraud' and the 'We're onto you' television advertisements. These advertisements were part of a campaign that also involved newspaper, poster and radio advertisements, but there is not enough space here to analyse these other types of advertisements. This article outlines the New Labour government's concerns with social <b>security</b> <b>fraud</b> and locates the television advertising campaign in relation to them. The article goes on to offer a textual analysis of the advertisements, focusing on the theme of deterring social <b>security</b> <b>fraud,</b> before critically engaging with the advertisements by focusing on their representation of social <b>security</b> <b>fraud</b> and the potential of the advertisements to deter fraudulent activity...|$|R

5|$|Lay and Skilling went {{on trial}} for their part in the Enron scandal in January 2006. The 53-count, 65-page {{indictment}} covers {{a broad range of}} financial crimes, including bank fraud, making false statements to banks and auditors, <b>securities</b> <b>fraud,</b> wire fraud, money laundering, conspiracy, and insider trading. United States District Judge Sim Lake had previously denied motions by the defendants to have separate trials and to relocate the case out of Houston, where the defendants argued the negative publicity concerning Enron's demise would make it impossible to get a fair trial. On May 25, 2006, the jury in the Lay and Skilling trial returned its verdicts. Skilling was convicted of 19 of 28 counts of <b>securities</b> <b>fraud</b> and wire fraud and acquitted on the remaining nine, including charges of insider trading. He was sentenced to 24 years and 4 months in prison. In 2013 the United States Department of Justice reached a deal with Skilling, which resulted in ten years being cut from his sentence.|$|E

40|$|This Comment will {{trace the}} history of Merck, {{culminating}} in the Supreme Court’s extension of {{the statute of limitations}} periods for private <b>security</b> <b>fraud</b> suits, and discuss the impact this holding will have on future <b>security</b> <b>fraud</b> litigation, both for investor-plaintiffs and issuer-defendants. Part I will examine the facts and procedural history of Merck, which began in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey and ultimately reached the Supreme Court of the United States. This procedural background will illuminate the various interpretations existing prior to Merck regarding the events that trigger the statute of limitations period. Part II identifies the core regulations decidedly interpreted by the Supreme Court in Merck, their application to <b>security</b> <b>fraud</b> suits, and the extent of the existing circuit split. Part III extricates the essential holdings of Merck, namely the discovery requirement of scienter as a fact constituting a violation, and the rejection of inquiry notice as “discovery” so as to trigger the statute of limitations. Finally, Part IV advances several potential implications for the decision, including increased numbers of private <b>security</b> <b>fraud</b> suits and difficulty for corporations in assessing risk for purposes of D 2 ̆ 6 O liability insurance...|$|R

It began production in 1994, and was the first product developed by Meretzky's company Boffo Games.

During development, Boffo discovered that Hodj 'n' Podj appealed to a wider demographic than Meretzky's past work, and Meretzky has since cited it as an early casual game.|$|E

In October 2011, he was arrested by the FBI on criminal charges of sharing insider information from these confidential board meetings with Rajaratnam.

5|$|The Attorney General of Virginia, Mary Sue Terry, prosecuted eight LaRouche {{organizations}} {{on charges}} of <b>securities</b> <b>fraud</b> relating to $30million in loans. The first trials were in Leesburg, but later trials moved to the larger city of Roanoke. In order for the prosecutions to proceed, {{a decision by the}} State Corporation Commission (SCC) was needed verifying that the loans solicited by LaRouche organizations were securities. Attorneys for the LaRouche organizations argued that a prohibition on raising funds through loans would violate their First Amendment rights. The SCC rejected that argument and decided, on March 4, 1987, that the promissory notes were securities. It ordered six LaRouche organizations—Fusion Energy Foundation Inc., Caucus Distributors Inc., Publication and General Management Inc., Campaigner Publications Inc., EIR News Service Inc. and Publication Equities Inc.—to stop their sale. Five other states had already issued injunctions, and 14 states eventually followed. At least one injunction, by the State of Minnesota against Independent Democrats for LaRouche, was appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which confirmed the lower court ruling.|$|E

The primary goal in social <b>security</b> <b>fraud</b> is to detect companies that intentionally fail to pay their contributions to the government. We aim to detect fraudulent companies by (1) propagating a time-dependent exposure score for each node based on its relationships to known fraud in the network; (2) deriving cliques of companies and resources, and labeling these cliques in terms of their fraud and bankruptcy involvement; and (3) characterizing each company using a combination of intrinsic and relational features and its membership in suspicious cliques. We show that clique-based features boost the performance of traditional relational models. status: publishe...|$|R
