50|$|The Parshall flume, an {{open channel}} flow {{metering}} device, was developed to measure the flow of <b>suface</b> waters and irrigation flows. The most recognized and commonly used flume today, the Parshall flume is a fixed hydraulic structure. It is used to measure volumetric flow rate in industrial discharges, municipal sewer lines, and influent/effluent flows in wastewater treatment plants. The Parshall flume accelerates flow through a contraction of both the parallel sidewalls and {{a drop in the}} floor at the flume throat. Under free-flow conditions the depth of water at specified location upstream of the flume throat can be converted to a rate of flow. Some states specify the use of Parshall flumes, by law, for certain situations (commonly water rights).|$|E

The 2011 UltraMar Festival was canceled at short notice after the organizers were unable to obtain the necessary permission from the local authorities and the Convention Center where the event was to be held. Tickets for the event were sold before a deal with the site had been reached, and were later reimbursed. UltraMar returned in 2012 and 2013, but faced more obstacles: the 2012 event was moved out of Cartagena to the beach of Manzanillo del Mar north of the city, and then in 2013 it was moved again at the last moment to Punta Canoa, another beach even further away, following complaints from residents about noise and delinquent behavior. The logisitical difficulties faced in putting on the 2013 festival and the competition from the rival Summerland (now Storyland) Festival resulted in the organizers deciding to discontinue UltraMar.|$|E

The formula proves the K-trivial case of a conjecture of M. Lehn from 1999. The relations determining the Segre classes fit into a much wider theory. By localizing the virtual classes of certain relative Quot schemes on surfaces, we obtain new systems of relations among tautological classes on moduli spaces of surfaces and their relative Hilbert schemes of points. For the moduli of K 3 <b>sufaces,</b> we produce relations intertwining the kappa classes and the Noether-Lefschetz loci. Conjectures are proposed...|$|R

40|$|On {{the basis}} of a {{previous}} theoretical approach to the plastic flow of highly refined materials, a physical explanation for diffusion bonding is essayed, which yields closed [...] form equations relating the bonding progress with time, temperature, applied pressure and the constants characterizing the material. Excellent agreement with experiment is attained, with no adjustable parameter. In the novel scheme, diffusion bonding is caused by the interpenetration of the two <b>sufaces</b> at the grain level. The process is driven by the strong tensile stress field induced in the plane of the interface by the plastic deformation in the normal direction. The grain boundaries of each joining surface yield to host grains of the other surface, releasing this way the internally generated tensile stresses.
