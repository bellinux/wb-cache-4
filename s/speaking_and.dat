5|$|In 1988, Madhavan {{gained a}} {{scholarship}} to represent India as a cultural ambassador from Rajaram College, Kolhapur and {{spent a year in}} Stettler, Alberta, Canada as part of an exchange programme. He returned to Kolhapur and completed his education, graduating with a degree in electronics. During his college years, Madhavan became actively involved in extra-curricular military training and at 22, he was recognised as amongst the leading NCC cadets in Maharashtra, which allowed him to make a trip with seven others as NCC cadets to England. As a result of this opportunity, he received training with the British Army, the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force, which he had, at a point, considered joining. However he missed the age cut-off by six months and was subsequently unable to join the programme. After he lost out on the place, he began teaching courses on public <b>speaking</b> <b>and</b> personality development skills in Kolhapur and the satisfaction he gained through teaching, prompted him to pursue a post-graduation in public speaking at Kishinchand Chellaram College in Mumbai. During the period, he also won the Indian Championship for Public <b>Speaking</b> <b>and</b> subsequently represented India at the Young Businessmen Conference in Tokyo, Japan in 1992.

5|$|A {{major feature}} in the early {{development}} of Modern English was the codification of explicit norms for standard usage, and their dissemination through official media such as public education and state sponsored publications. In 1755 Samuel Johnson published his A Dictionary of the English Language which introduced a standard set of spelling conventions and usage norms. In 1828, Noah Webster published the American Dictionary of the English language {{in an effort to}} establish a norm for <b>speaking</b> <b>and</b> writing American English that was independent from the British standard. Within Britain, non-standard or lower class dialect features were increasingly stigmatised, leading to the quick spread of the prestige varieties among the middle classes.|$|E
5|$|According to Twain, {{she became}} {{depressed}} and lost {{her desire to}} live after the divorce. As a distraction, she began to write a memoir, titled From This Moment On after the 1998 song of the same name. She then re-evaluated her life and noted a pattern of withholding emotions, which affected her voice for both <b>speaking</b> <b>and</b> singing. She explained {{the loss of her}} voice resulted from the cumulative stress of experiencing domestic violence in her childhood, the death of her parents, stress from her musical career, and the divorce. As a result, the singer developed dysphonia, an impairment in the ability to produce sound because of tightened muscles enveloping her voice box. In order to recover, Twain embarked on a documented journey with the series Why Not? with Shania Twain. Twain's wanted go outside her comfort zone and perform once again, while inspiring viewers to be proactive about their own problems.|$|E

5|$|Broadly <b>speaking,</b> <b>and</b> {{with some}} exceptions, lithophile heavy metals can be {{extracted}} from their ores by electrical or chemical treatments, while chalcophile heavy metals are obtained by roasting their sulphide ores to yield the corresponding oxides, and then heating these {{to obtain the}} raw metals. Radium occurs in quantities {{too small to be}} economically mined and is instead obtained from spent nuclear fuels. The chalcophile platinum group metals (PGM) mainly occur in small (mixed) quantities with other chalcophile ores. The ores involved need to be smelted, roasted, and then leached with sulfuric acid to produce a residue of PGM. This is chemically refined to obtain the individual metals in their pure forms. Compared to other metals, PGM are expensive due to their scarcity and high production costs.|$|E
