To {{assess the}} {{accuracy}} of different methods of combining published <b>survival</b> <b>curves</b> into a summary curve {{that can be used}} in disease models or to make treatment comparisons in meta-analysis. Methods. Five methods for combining <b>survival</b> <b>curves</b> were identified: (1) iterative generalized least-squares (IGLS, Dear 94), (2) meta-analysis (MA) of failure-time data with adjustment for covariates (MFD, Hunink 94), (3) non-linear regression (NLR, Shore 90), (4) log relative risk (LRR, Voest 89), and (5) weighted LRR (w-LRR). Published <b>survival</b> <b>curves</b> were scanned into a graphical package, coordinates along each curve were identified, and required data elements were extracted semi-automatically. Two separate analyses were done: (1) each method was used to combine the <b>survival</b> <b>curves</b> from eight single arm Phase II trials of chemotherapy in 918 patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); (2) each method was used to combine the <b>survival</b> <b>curves</b> from seven randomized trials in order to reproduce a MA of chemotherapy in advanced NSCLC.

The efficiency of repair by this process is indicated by the observation that a dose of MMC that allows survival of only 1 in 1,000 monocomplexes allows survival of about 70% of multicomplexes. Similar multicomplex survival curves (without shoulders) were also obtained for the DNA damaging agents P32 decay, psoralen plus near-UV irradiation (PUVA), N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG), methyl methane sulfonate (MMS) and nitrous acid.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to compare the {{antimicrobial}} efficiency of aminolevulinic acid- -based photosensitization (ALA-photo) and chlorophyllin-based photosensitization (CHL -photo) against Gram-positive Listeria monocytogenes and Gram-negative Salmonella enterica, to assess some quantitative inactivation parameters of their <b>survival</b> <b>curves</b> and to propose a strategy for their effective inactivation. Cells were incubated with CHL (7. 5 · 10 ^– 5 – 7. 5 · 10 ^– 8 M) or ALA (7. 5 mM) and then illuminated with visible light (λ= 400 nm). The analysis of bacterial <b>survival</b> <b>curves</b> indicates that Salmonella is more resistant to CHL-photo than to ALA-photo. The shoulder of the inactivation curve was longer and the population reduction suddenness was smaller than that after ALA-photo. Listeria was more sensitive to CHL-photo than to ALA-photo.

50|$|The linear {{quadratic}} model is now {{most often used}} to describe the cell <b>survival</b> <b>curve,</b> assuming that there are two mechanisms to cell death by radiation: A single lethal event or an accumulation of harmful but non-lethal events. Cell survival fractions are exponential functions with a dose-dependent term in the exponent due to the Poisson statistics underlying the stochastic process. Whereas single lethal events lead to an exponent that is linearly related to dose, the survival fraction function for a two-stage mechanism carries an exponent proportional to the square of dose. The coefficients must be inferred from measured data, such as the Hiroshima Leukemia data. With higher orders being of lesser importance and the total survival fraction being the product of the two functions, the model is aptly called linear-quadratic.|$|E

40|$|Objectives. Kaplan–Meier <b>survival</b> <b>curves</b> {{adjusted}} for confounders {{have been presented}} based {{on the use of}} inverse probability weights. However, in observational studies, some confounders may not be measured. In these situations, it is important to evaluate the potential impact of unmeasured confounding quantitatively. Here, we propose a simple method for sensitivity analysis of adjusted <b>survival</b> <b>curves</b> using the inverse probability weights. Methods. We derived inverse probability weights, in which confounding risk ratios used as sensitivity parameters for unmeasured confounding were included. Using the weights with some plausible values for sensitivity parameters, a sensitivity analysis was performed. Results. The proposed method of sensitivity analysis was applied to observational study data. The results demonstrate that this new method can be applied to adjusted <b>survival</b> <b>curves</b> without complex computer programming. Conclusions. The proposed sensitivity analysis has the disadvantage of using sensitivity parameters as measures of risk as opposed to focusing on time to event. Nevertheless, the method is simple to perform and will aid researchers in evaluating the potential impact of unmeasured confounding on the Kaplan–Meier <b>survival</b> <b>curves...</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{functional}} relationship determining the <b>survival</b> <b>curve</b> for reproductive cell death caused by low-LET radiation is derived {{on the basis}} of Lea's repair/interaction model.

The dependence of cell survival on the irradiation conditions can be interpreted in terms of the basic parameters of the model...|$|E
