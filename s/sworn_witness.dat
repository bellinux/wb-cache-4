The research took statement of problems: (1) how the position of crown witness in the revealing process of case in Indonesia’s criminal court law? (2) Why did the judge allowed the usage of crown witness as the evidence in criminal court system? The research used normative-juridical approach, data collection technique come from library study. Data research was analyzed in content analisys way. There could be concluded that the crown witness position in case revealing process in Indonesia’s criminal court system wasn’t arranged in Criminal Court Law since according to the Criminal Court Law, the legal evidence were witness explanation, expert explanation, letter, clue, and suspect explanation. While about crown witness, it wasn’t explained in Criminal Court Law.

This equality is intended for all aspects of life including equal before the law without discrimination, to receive protection and equal benefit of the law but the presence of persons with disabilities is not currently fully recognized. this is evident from the lack of fulfillment of the rights, protection and even discrimination. In the field of law, witnesses with disabilities are ignored because they are not capable of law and not in the category of full testimony, which is able to see, hear and experience. Proving criminal offenses involving persons with disabilities is hampered themselves and other with disabilities. Obstacles faced in handling criminal cases involving persons with disabilities,among others, the view that the testimony of persons with disabilities do not have the force of law, the existence of communication problems with disabilities, especially deaf persons who require a sign language interpreter to express his statement as a witness.

50|$|The DMV TVB is an {{administrative}} court {{that is not}} part of the judiciary, but an executive agency with different procedures regarding elements ranging from rules of evidence to threshold for conviction. The function of the judge is carried out by {{an administrative}} law judge, or ALJ.

After a guilty finding, the DMV ALJ may impose any penalty authorized by the Vehicle and Traffic Law, including suspension or revocation of a driver's license and/or motor vehicle registration, but not including imprisonment. There is no absolute right to a supporting deposition, and rules on admissibility of hearsay evidence are far more lax than in court.

60|$|Thus {{the dark}} ages do not, as might have been expected, provide us with most of this material. The last forty enlightened years give us more bogles than all the ages between St. Augustine and the Restoration. When {{the dark ages}} were over, when {{learning}} revived, the learned turned their minds to 'Psychical Research,' and Wier, Bodin, Le Loyer, Georgius Pictorius, Petrus Thyraeus, James VI., collected many instances of the phenomena still said to survive. Then, for want of better materials, the unhappy, tortured witches dragged into their confessions all the folklore which they knew. Second sight, the fairy world, ghosts, 'wraiths,' 'astral bodies' of witches whose bodies of flesh are elsewhere, volatile chairs and tables, all were spoken of by witches under torture, and by <b>sworn</b> <b>witnesses.</b> {31} Resisting the scepticism of the Restoration, Glanvil, More, Boyle, and the rest, fought the Sadducee with the usual ghost stories. Wodrow, later (1701-1731), compiled the marvels of his Analecta. In spite of the cold common-sense of the eighteenth century, sporadic outbreaks of rappings and feats of impulsive pots, pans, beds and chairs insisted on making themselves notorious. The Wesley case {{would never have been}} celebrated if the sons of Samuel Wesley had not become prominent.

Finally Modern Spiritualism arrived, and was, for the most part, an organised and fraudulent copy of the old popular phenomena, with a few cheap and vulgar variations on the theme.|$|R

6000|$|The battle {{began with}} an {{artillery}} duel, during which the clans lost heavily, while their few guns were useless, and their right flank was exposed by the breaking down of the protecting wall. After some unexplained and dangerous delay, Lord George gave the word to charge, in face of a blinding tempest of sleet, and himself went in, as did Lochiel, claymore in hand. But though the order was conveyed by Ker of Graden first to the Macdonalds on the left, as they had to charge over a wider space of ground, the Camerons, Clan Chattan, and Macleans came first to the shock. [...] "Nothing could be more desperate than their attack, or more properly received," [...] says Whitefoord. The assailants were enfiladed by Wolfe's regiment, which moved up and took position at right angles, like the fifty-second on the flank of the last charge of the French Guard at Waterloo. The Highland right broke through Barrel's regiment, swept over the guns, and died on the bayonets of the second line. They had thrown down their muskets after one fire, and, says Cumberland, stood [...] "and threw stones {{for at least a}} minute or two before their total rout began." [...] Probably the fall of Lochiel, who was wounded and carried out of action, determined the flight. Meanwhile the left, the Macdonalds, menaced on the flank by cavalry, were plied at a hundred yards by grape. They saw their leaders, the gallant Keppoch and Macdonnell of Scothouse, with many others, fall under the grape-shot: they saw the right wing broken, and they did not come to the shock. If we may believe four <b>sworn</b> <b>witnesses</b> in a court of justice (July 24, 1752), whose testimony was accepted as the basis of a judicial decreet (January 10, 1756), {290} Keppoch was wounded while giving his orders to some of his men not to outrun the line in advancing, and was shot dead as a friend was supporting him. When all retreated they passed the dead body of Keppoch.|$|R

50|$|The 'legend' of an Anglo-Saxon origin to {{the jury}} was first {{challenged}} seriously by Heinrich Brunner in 1872, who claimed that evidence of the jury was only seen {{for the first time}} during the reign of Henry II, some 200 {{years after the end of}} the Anglo-Saxon period, and that the practice had originated with the Franks, who in turn had influenced the Normans, who thence introduced it to England. Since Brunner's thesis, the origin of the English jury has been much disputed. Throughout the 20th century, legal historians disagreed about whether the practice was English in origin, or was introduced, directly or indirectly, from either Scandinavia or Francia. Recently, the legal historians Patrick Wormald and Michael Macnair have reasserted arguments in favour of finding in practices current during the Anglo-Saxon period traces of the Angevin practice of conducting inquests using bodies of <b>sworn,</b> private <b>witnesses.</b> Wormald has gone as far as to present evidence suggesting that the English practice outlined in Æthelred's Wantage code is at least as old as, if not older than, 975, and ultimately traces it back to a Carolingian model (something Brinner had done). However, no scholarly consensus has yet been reached.|$|R

50|$|This strict {{distinction}} remained {{despite the}} fact that by the 16th century, the role of juries was changed. Juries had become triers of fact and the practice of laying <b>sworn</b> testimony of <b>witnesses</b> had become general. The juries, however, still had to be drawn from the county in which the venue was laid. If the matter had arisen outside England (i.e. a foreign locality), the legal fictions employed in transitory actions were not applicable, and so jury could be summoned to try the facts in issue. The matter could not be heard. For example, in Skinner v East India Co 6 St Tr 710, the House of Lords in 1666, held that actions relating to ships and trespass to the person could be determined in courts in England because they were transitory in nature. But actions for dispossession of house and island, was not relievable in courts of England because they are local in nature.|$|R

The ship was manned by Moors and commanded by a Dutchman, and of course Kidd had no right to touch it, but the sharp-witted and business-like pirate selected one of the passengers and made him sign a paper declaring that he was a Frenchman, and that he commanded the ship. When this statement had been <b>sworn</b> to before <b>witnesses,</b> Kidd put the document in his pocket so that if he were called upon to explain the transaction he might be able to show that he had good reason to suppose that he had captured a French ship, which, of course, was all right and proper.|$|R
