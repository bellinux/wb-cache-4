40|$|Saudi {{educators}} are increasingly concerned over whether principal preparation programs in Saudi Arabia are accomplishing their goal of developing qualified {{leaders who are}} prepared {{to take on the}} tasks of school principals. Thus, <b>Saudi</b> <b>researchers</b> recommend that the school principal preparation programs undergo evaluation. This study examines American school principal preparation program components to determine their applicability to Saudi programs. Data analysis focused on Title 23 Illinois Administrative Code 30 and the Saudi School Principal Preparation Program Guidelines with a specific focus on their general program requirements, internship requirements, coursework requirements, and staffing requirements. This research uncovers several similarities and differences between the Saudi and Illinois principal preparation programs. Both programs establish regulations and instructor qualifications as well as requirements for a program coordinator, accreditation, and completion of a supervised internship. The differences between the two include the areas of program structure, course requirements, and educational standards. The study’s findings encourage future research in two areas to improve principal preparation programs in Saudi Arabia: principal performance before and after program participation and study replication using Gulf Region, Middle East, European, or Asian countries as comparable...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The Third International Genomic Medicine Conference (3 rd IGMC) was {{organised}} by the Centre of Excellence in Genomic Medicine Research (CEGMR) at the King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). This {{conference is}} a continuation of a series of meetings, which began with the first International Genomic Medicine Conference (1 st IGMC, 2011) followed by the second International Genomic Medicine Conference (2 nd IGMC, 2013). The 3 rd IGMC meeting presented as a timely opportunity to bring scientists from across the world to gather, discuss, and exchange recent advances in the field of genomics and genetics in general as well as practical information on using these new technologies in different basic and clinical applications. The meeting undoubtedly inspired young male and female <b>Saudi</b> <b>researchers,</b> who attended the conference in large numbers, as evidenced by the oversubscribed oral and poster presentations. The conference also witnessed the launch of the first content for npj Genomic Medicine, a high quality new journal was established in partnership by CEGMR with Springer Nature and published as part of the Nature Partner Journal series. Here, we present a brief summary report of the 2 -day meeting including highlights from the oral presentations, poster presentations, workshops, poster prize-winners and comments from the distinguished scientists...|$|E

Therefore, no {{country in the world}} can live in an environment isolated {{from the rest of the}} world. This paper aims to review some of the existing cultural factors, to identify their impact on the e-readiness process in the Developing Countries, and to discuss to what extent they can really fulfill their intention in acting and helping to build blocks of an e-readiness assessment framework as guiding tools in the successful introduction and implementation of eReadiness. Based on this discussion, the paper presents these blocks - categorized into eight factors which cover some important cultural issues that should be addressed when setting an appraisal framework of eReadiness success in Saudi Arabia as developing County. These factors ware designed to seek information related to the influence of Saudi culture on the adoption of ICT systems. Eight questions sought information related to business language, communication language, culture and ICT R&D, support of the Saudi Arabia government of production development, consistency of Internet with local culture, openness of the culture of the country to foreign influence, the impact of employees’ culture on their work, ICT and the protection of <b>Saudi</b> culture. <b>Researchers</b> are conducting survey and 30 interviews to collect data for this study.

40|$|Background There {{has been}} {{considerable}} publicity that the 1991 Gulf War {{may have caused}} {{a wide array of}} health problems in military personnel. Although post-war health outcomes have been studied in US, British, Canadian, Danish, and other deployed troops, this issue has not been previously evaluated in coalition forces native to the Gulf region. Methods A collaborative team of US and <b>Saudi</b> health <b>researchers</b> was assembled, data sources evaluated, and hospitalizations among Saudi Arabian National Guard (SANG) soldiers between 1991 and 1999 analysed. Multivariate modelling was used to evaluate differences between 8342 soldiers exposed to combat at Al Khafji and a comparison group of 7270 soldiers in the Riyadh area. Results Among 15 612 SANG soldiers, we identified 148 with at least one hospitalization over the 9 years following the war. The adjusted rate of hospitalization was higher in the combat-exposed group (risk ratio (RR) = 1. 80, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 25 – 2. 59). No unusual patterns of diagnoses were found and, because the overall number of hospitalizations was low, the absolute difference in risk was found to be very small. Conclusions This is the first reported epidemiological investigation of post-war hospitalizations among coalition forces native to the Gulf region that participated in the 1991 Gulf War. A very small increase in hospitalizations was identified in SANG soldiers exposed to combat at Al Khafji. However, because of data limitations, the clinical relevance of this finding should be interpreted with caution. Future collaborative studies to better understand the health effects of deployment should be encouraged...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The CAVE, {{a walk-in}} virtual reality {{environment}} typically consisting of 4 - 6 3 m-by- 3 m {{sides of a}} room made of rear-projected screens, was first conceived and built in 1991.

The limitation of the study is that the model is based on data collected from employees working in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia only, which could have been collected from other regions of the Middle East countries as well. According to this model, compensation to the employees should be paid attention to, which would result in enhanced job performance and conflict free work-family environment...|$|R
40|$|Islamic {{societies}} {{were part}} of the Islamic Golden Age from the mid- 8 th century to the mid- 13 th century when they adhered closely to the principles and ethics of Islam. However, after colonialism when Islamic societies became somewhat uncritical followers of Western civilization, they lost their intellectual leadership position in the world. If Islamic societies want to regain a high standing in the modern world, it is clear that they need to take the path of modern science and technology but, importantly, a science that is ‘beholden’ to Islamic principles and views. In this paper we shall demonstrate that a transformation of the postgraduate education system of Saudi Arabia can enhance Islamic values in the education system of Saudi Arabia and that the inclusion of critical auto/ethnographic research can make a major contribution to this process. Critical auto/ethnography is a methodology produced by combining three major research paradigms: interpretivism, criticalism and postmodernism. This powerful methodology enables researchers to engage deeply in educational issues with/in their own culture (Taylor, Taylor, & Luitel, in press/ 2012). Drawing on doctoral research conducted by the first author, a mathematics teacher educator from a Saudi Arabian university, we shall illustrate this innovative approach to educational research as a tool for <b>Saudi</b> mathematics <b>researchers</b> that enhances and elaborates them to transform their professional practice within their own culture. “Critical auto/ethnography enabled me [first author] to be immersed deeply and reflectively in excavating key moments of my academic and personal life, coming to understand them closely and critically and representing them in ways that resonate with the experiences of others…providing an avenue for doing something meaningful for myself as a teacher educator and for the professional world surrounding me”...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the {{awareness}} and use of professional standards in mathematics by elementary mathematics teachers in Tabuk City, <b>Saudi</b> Arabia. The <b>researcher</b> used a mixed-method (survey and focus group discussion), which consisted of three main questions for the survey and eleven questions for the focus group.

The research focused on eight professional standards in the study: lesson planning, teaching, learning environment, assessment, interaction, enrichment, innovation, and creativity. In addition, the researcher looked at 31 sub-standards of the general eight standards. The survey results showed that the elementary mathematics teachers in Tabuk City ranked quite low in all eight standards. In addition, the focus group discussions revealed that the elementary mathematics teachers lacked an awareness of the importance of using professional standards and that they did not use the standards in their teaching.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to investigate the effects of power relations on the implementation of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) in an organisation in <b>Saudi</b> Arabia. The <b>researcher</b> adopted a qualitative, interpretive research perspective using a single explanatory case study paradigm, which was generalised to a concept. As one of the objectives of {{this research}} was to analyse the case study by using Foucault’s analysis of power embedded within Actor Network Theory (ANT), the concept of ANT-Foucault was developed. This concept could provide valuable insights for the body of knowledge by proposing an alternative way of analysing IS and ERP implementation projects in organisations. Although, the outcome of the research was limited to deploying a single case of an ERP implementation project in an organisation in Saudi Arabia to investigate the effects of power relations on the ERP implementation project under study, the researcher believes that the ANT-Foucault concept is capable of being adopted into other ERP implementation projects provided that careful consideration of the context is taken. Future research could be aimed at further examining the application of such concept with a view of developing a new theoretical framework. Such framework would be capable of assisting IT project managers to follow and analyse the manoeuvres of power during the course of IS or ERP projects...|$|R
40|$|The {{speech act}} of thanking, in varied {{permutations}} and contexts, {{is probably one}} of the most common speech acts in the daily life of every culture. In the Hijazi dialect spoken in the western province of Saudi Arabia, thanking behavior has significant social value. This is why the failure to express or respond to gratitude expressions according to the social norms that are known among Hijazi speakers can affect the relationship between the interlocutors. In this study, I investigate the speech act of thanking and the strategies employed by Hijazi females in Saudi Arabia to express this. To explore these strategies, a corpus of naturally occurring thanking exchanges is analyzed. 400 exchanges were gathered based on an ethnographic approach that uses field observations to create a corpus. My investigation examined gratitude expressions produced by Hijazi females in three contexts: thanking for a favor, thanking for a meal, and thanking for a gift. To determine what strategies of expressing or responding to gratitude expression Hijazi female use, gratitude expressions and their responses were coded according to the model pioneered by Al-Zubaidi (2012). Results indicated that Hijazi females use various strategies in expressing and responding to thanking for a low imposition favor, such as, Thanking and Expressing Benediction. In expressing gratitude for a meal, Hijazi female speakers do not employ the wide variety of the thanking strategies posited in the literature. Rather, they prefer using Expressing Benediction to verbalize their thanking. On the other hand, thanking for a gift generally requires two turns. In the first turn, the beneficiary has to express her indebtedness. In response, the benefactor tries to minimize the debt. In the second turn, the beneficiaries express their willingness to offer repayment or just express thanking while the benefactor responds by acknowledging the thanking or by expressing blessings or prayers. Previous studies have investigated the speech act of thanking in certain Arabic dialects such as Jordanian, Iraqi and Egyptian Arabic. However, scholarly attention has yet to be paid to how thanking expressions are used and responded to in Saudi dialects. This study functions as a reference point for other researchers interested in the cross-cultural realization of the speech act of thanking. Also, since this paper focuses on Hijazi dialect at the western part of <b>Saudi</b> Arabia, <b>researchers</b> interested in the speech act of thanking in Saudi Arabic can use this study for comparison with other Saudi dialects.

40|$|Previous {{research}} {{reveals that}} the centralized, bureaucratic and rigid authority lines are the main features in the <b>Saudi</b> work environment. <b>Researchers</b> have studied several HRM topics in Saudi Arabia such as leadership, regulations {{and the impact of}} culture on employees. However, {{there seems to be a}} lack of attention to topics related to motivation, empowerment and organizational design. This paper aimed to explore the factors that motivate employees, investigate the relationship between organizational design and employee motivation and study the organization’s initiatives to improve employee motivation in the context of Saudi Arabia. The complex and subjective nature of the topic required the use of a qualitative approach. This researcher conducted fifteen semi-structured interviews with employees and managers holding different positions in various fields in Saudi Arabia. The study found that employees’ motivation was significantly influenced by factors at three levels, the national level (e. g. Wasta, Saudization and the country’s culture), the organizational level (e. g. manager’s attitude, centralization and the career progression clarity) and on the employee level (e. g. financial incentives, significance and autonomy of their tasks, self-motivation, and dynamic motivation). Although employees’ motivation boosted when they were delegated more authority (empowered), in most cases, for others authority meant being responsible on a larger scale (which made them fear making fatal mistakes) and they preferred to have less authority unless they were educated about their tasks. Though participants lacked awareness regarding their organizations’ initiatives to improve motivation, they provided plenty of information regarding the Ministry of Labour’s plans to protect employees and impede any practices violating employees’ rights. The study found that the Ministry of Labour has several insightful initiatives (e. g. training, women’s opportunities in the workplace and computerizing systems). However, improvements in the implementation of their programs are necessary for the country’s international business development and the welfare of employees...|$|R

The <b>researcher</b> has been professionally involved in English language instruction in Saudi Aramco for more than 25 years, and the study emerges from {{the assumption that the}} BEP does not provide enough opportunities for learners to build up a communicative competence that helps them to use language for real communication. The subjects in the study ware Saudi high school graduates with little background in English. Successful completion of the BEP program is a pre-requisite for their technical training in Saudi Aramco.;The study sets out to explore the types of L 2 learning activities, the teaching methods and strategies the teachers employ, as well as the learners' roles in the class and the organizational policies which control the Basic English Program. The data were collected through direct observation of thirty lessons using one part of the Communicative Orientation of Language Teaching (COLT) Observation Scheme. In addition, audio-recordings of several observed lessons were also made.;The analysis of the data from the COLT Scheme, and the transcribed lesson extracts reveal that the Saudi Aramco Basic English Program does not provide the learners with sufficient and appropriate practice opportunities and this is one reason why {{there is a lack of}} competence in the use of English in real communication.;The study concludes that classroom instruction in the Basic English Program limits the students' chances for spontaneous use of language and hence their ability to communicate in real situations. Among the recommendations made are that changes need to be introduced by the syllabus and teaching methods in order that learners are provided with the necessary language skills to enable them to use English to communicate inside and outside the classroom...|$|R

The paper focuses on the visual representation of privacy needs within the interior spaces of contemporary <b>Saudi</b> houses. The <b>researcher</b> approached the representation of the conceptual term privacy by tracing its existence in traditional houses and its status in contemporary houses. In the on-going research, as part of a qualitative methodology under the ethnography approach, interviews were conducted with Saudi females who occupy contemporary houses in the Eastern region of Saudi Arabia. Interview participants aged between 21 and 35 years with different cultural backgrounds but resided in the Eastern region, Dammam city. These interviews were to give insight into the current understanding that these participants had about privacy and the way they represented it in their houses. The selected contemporary house data was obtained from the interviews conducted with house owners (Saudi females) as part of on-going research. Two types of analysis were applied to the selected houses: axial analysis as part of the space syntax analysis approach; and privacy levels identification. These analysis tools helped display the representations of privacy in the selected contemporary house through its designs; spatial and architectural design elements are presented that help manage the social need of privacy that contemporary users require in their houses. This investigation led to displaying an updated understanding {{of the ways in which}} privacy needs are represented in conceptual houses within the context of the interiors of contemporary Saudi houses. This paper aids the on-going research, in the process of providing information that would help generate a design tool that would assist designers (who are interested in designing development housing projects) in their design process of contemporary houses that meet the social needs of the users, in particular privacy needs...|$|R
40|$|This study explores Saudi student teachers’ {{perceptions}} of formative assessment (FA). Recently, {{there has been}} a shift in Saudi Arabia towards a constructivist approach within education, which emphasises problem solving, analysis and research rather than memorisation and repetition. Despite these changes, FA, which is best utilised in a constructivist environment, has been overlooked. There are few studies on FA in the Arabian region, and there are no studies about student teachers’ {{perceptions of}} FA. 	Because FA is a new approach in <b>Saudi</b> Arabia, the <b>researcher</b> drew upon traditions of action research, in that FA was introduced by the researcher and discussed with the participants throughout the study. A purposive sample of eleven Saudi student teachers and their tutors participated in this study. Data was collected using a variety of instruments over a period of time. The process of data collection was in three stages: before, during and after school placement. Initial one-to-one semi-structured interviews were conducted with the student teachers before school placement. Thirty-three observations took place during school placement. After school placement, questionnaires and one-to-one semi-structured interviews were conducted with the student teachers, and interviews were also conducted with their tutors. 	Although the Saudi student teachers had been influenced by summative assessment, the main findings showed that they were enthusiastic about the idea of FA and they recommended implementing it in Saudi schools. The findings also indicated that the student teachers could learn about FA, and the researcher’s approach of connecting theory to practice through reflection seemed to be helpful in developing their knowledge about FA. The student teachers perceived that mixed abilities classrooms and time limitations — both time within lessons and the period of school placements — affected their practice of FA. The findings also suggested that in order to avoid what they seemed to identify as problematic FA techniques, the student teachers tended to focus on certain FA strategies. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{last decade}} has seen an exodus of South African nurses {{migrating}} to "greener pastures". As {{a result of}} this migration, the South African Healthcare Service has been drained of one of its most essential resources – nurses. Subsequently, the crippling flight of nurses has thrown the nursing profession into a state of crisis. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia {{is one of the more}} popular destinations for South African nurses, the main reason being the attractive financial rewards. One agency reports that they send an average of thirty nurses a month to various hospitals within the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia is an Islamic country. Due to the uniqueness of the enforcement of the Islamic faith and the Saudi culture, many restrictions are imposed, particularly on women. The challenges and problems facing the South African nurses were, therefore, unique compared to elsewhere in the world. This research study had a primary and a secondary objective: The primary objective of this study was to explore and describe the lived experiences of South African nurses related to living and working in Saudi Arabia; The secondary objective of this study was to develop orientation guidelines to support South African nurses working and living in <b>Saudi</b> Arabia. The <b>researcher</b> utilized a qualitative, explorative, descriptive and contextual design based on a phenomenological approach to inquiry, in an attempt to answer the question: "What are the professional and personal experiences of the South African registered nurses working and living in Saudi Arabia?" Eleven registered nurses were selected to participate by means of purposive sampling. These nurses had been living in Saudi Arabia between three and six months. Consent was obtained from participants and the ethics committee of both the Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University and King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre. The central theme emanating from the study was recognized as being 'Cultural Diversity'. The sub-themes identified related to the registered nurses’: - Religious/spiritual adaptation - Environmental adaptation - Emotional/psychological adaptation - Professional adaptation Based on the identified themes, guidelines were formulated to assist South African registered nurses when migrating to Saudi Arabia. Utilization of these should assist the South African registered nurse in assimilating into both the cultural and working environment.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundPicture {{archiving}} {{and communication}} system (PACS) are management information systems used for distributing, viewing and archiving digital images by integrating {{different types of}} modalities through communication networks. PACS have many advantages {{that can lead to}} improving health care quality. PACS has been widely used in hospitals in Saudi Arabia for the past 10 years. However, an extensive review of literature in the field of PACS, among physicians and radiologists in Saudi Arabia, showed lack of local studies of this costly and newly implemented technology. Therefore, this assessment is very important to provide an insightful study of PACS in Saudi Arabia to provide proper recommendations for the PACS projects implementation nationwide. ObjectivesThe objectives of this study are to, firstly, assess the perceived benefits of PACS among physicians and radiologists specifically in quality of care, secondly, assess the perceived challenges of PACS implementation and adoption inside and outside the radiology department, and thirdly, to compare between physicians’ and radiologists’ perceptions toward PACS. MethodsA cross-sectional descriptive study at three of Ministry of Health (MOH) Hospitals in the Riyadh region, <b>Saudi</b> Arabia. The <b>researchers</b> used two separate surveys questionnaires, for administration to the physicians and radiologists at the three hospitals. Apart from the questionnaire, included is feedback as responses to open-ended questions. Content analysis was used to analyze the feedback under two themes: benefits or challenges. ResultsThe response rate was 46 % (84 / 183) physicians and 88 % (15 / 17) radiologists have participated in this study. The result showed that 70 % physicians’ views affirms that PACS improved physicians’ efficiency. On the other hand, all radiologists who responded affirmed that PACS improved efficiency. For questions on the ability to make decisions, 69 % of views have affirmed that PACS improved physician's abilities to make decisions regarding patient care. Using PACS has led to a reduction in patients’ length of stay in hospital (LOS) question, 79 % of total views were positive. In contrast, only 18 % of physicians talked about PACS positively in summary views and 82 % talked about the challenges of PACS whereas 20 % of radiologists talked about PACS positively. ConclusionsThe results in the present study conclude that PACS was well perceived due to its numerous benefits among physicians and radiologists. However, radiologists showed more focus on the benefits of PACS than physicians. The main disadvantages are that PACS has resulted in difficulty in finding images, recurrent downtime and insufficient training...|$|R
40|$|In the {{changing}} and dynamic world, whilst companies endeavour {{to achieve their}} {{short and long term}} objectives in an efficient and effective manner, evaluating their human resources (HR) is regarded as an essential and fundamental process for achieving organisational objectives. However, the performance appraisal (PA) process is not only important for being the main provider of data in order to make HR related administrative decisions, but it also helps to provide information for identifying and influencing the development and satisfaction of the employees in carrying out their duties. This, in turn, contributes towards the achievement of the organisational objectives. The universities are knowledge-based organisations dependent entirely on the commitment and innovation of their teaching staff, and, therefore, they are different in terms of the organisational activity from other institutions. However, the management of universities, as educational institutions, is not that much different from other organisations. Therefore, all the management issues faced in other organisations are also relevant to universities, including HR management strategies drawn from PA systems (PASs). Hence, this study aims to evaluate the current PAS in Saudi Arabian public universities according to the perceptions of the teaching members who are subject to the PA process. It also aims to develop a new PAS based on the results developed from the research. In responding to the aim of the study, a questionnaire schedule was developed and conducted in four major public universities in <b>Saudi</b> Arabia. The <b>researcher</b> sent out 351 questionnaires, of which 197 were returned, giving a return rate of 56 %. The results of the empirical analysis demonstrate that the participants are not happy with the existing PAS. In addition, it reveals: communication, transparency and organisational problems related to both the ratees who are subject to the PAS and the raters who carry out the process; poorly designed forms are used in the process; and problems related to the procedures that regulate which may undermine the appraisal process. Thus, dissatisfaction with the existing PASs is established through various empirical analyses. According to the findings of the study and the in-depth of the discussion of the analysed data, the study proposes an integrated and dynamic model for conducting the PA process. This proposed model is constructed with six stages: (1) Planning for Performance Appraisal; (2) Performance Execution; (3) Assessment (Informal Appraisal); (4) Performance Assessment (Formal Appraisal); (5) Interview; and (6) Action. In each stage several issues have been emphasised to improve overall efficiency of the PAS. The study also provides certain assumptions and recommendations for the successful development and implementation of the proposed model, which top level management in each university has to take into consideration to ensure the efficiency and effectiveness of human resources.

The study concentrates mainly on three issues: maritime terrorism, illegal trade and illegal immigration. Terrorism has increased, especially after the events of 9 / 11, and terrorists are using new methods to attack civilians and governments all over the world. The study concentrates on the danger of terrorism in seaports and sets out a strategy to confront it. Illegal trade {{is considered one of the}} most dangerous international crimes and all countries of the world suffer from the trafficking of drugs and arms. KSA is no exception. It suffers from these crimes across its maritime and territorial borders. Thus, it is important to tackle this crime via a security strategy for protecting Saudi ports. KSA also suffers from a high level of illegal immigration across its maritime and territorial borders, mainly from neighbouring countries such as Yemen, Somalia and Iraq. Illegal migrants are usually searching for work and a better life. The study tries to find new methods to solve the problems of maritime terrorism, illegal trade and illegal immigration at large ports. Securing the coasts of KSA, which stretch 2000 km along both the Red Sea and the Arab Gulf, is an important matter, XIII especially nowadays with the spread of terrorist attacks due to international political and religious conflicts. The geographical location of KSA is considered a huge obstacle to the successful securing of its ports and coasts, as KSA is surrounded by 13 countries. Some of these countries are very poor in terms of their economy and security level. There are also several political conflicts surrounding KSA, and every year thousands of migrants try to enter KSA looking for work or trying to perform religious pilgrimage. In addition, many methods are used for the trade of drugs, explosives and arms. All these issues are tackled in the study with the aim of setting a strategy for the protection of <b>Saudi</b> ports. The <b>researcher</b> uses a questionnaire to obtain data from Saudi borders guards in order to recognize the role of these forces in protecting Saudi ports. At the end the researcher reaches conclusions and makes important recommendations for the KSA government to consider, for example: Saudi authorities may wish to approve the strategy suggested by the <b>researcher</b> to protect <b>Saudi</b> ports from maritime terrorism, illegal trade and illegal immigration using the latest technology. KSA must further develop and activate this security strategy. Saud Arabia should use advanced technology systems for monitoring and protecting ports, especially pilotless planes (UAVs) to monitor the coasts.
