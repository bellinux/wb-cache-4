5|$|Spencer {{seeks out}} the Beautiful Girl Across the Hall, but finds her with another man. Crushed, Spencer {{returns to his}} room, where the child is crying. He takes a pair of <b>scissors</b> <b>and</b> {{for the first time}} removes the child's swaddling. It is {{revealed}} that the child has no skin; the bandages held its internal organs together, and they spill apart after the rags are cut. The child gasps in pain, and Spencer cuts its organs with the scissors. The wounds gush a thick liquid, covering the child. The power in the room overloads; as the lights flicker on and off the child grows to huge proportions. When the lights burn out completely, the child's head is replaced by the planet. Spencer appears amidst a billowing cloud of eraser shavings. The side of the planet bursts apart, and inside, the Man in the Planet struggles with his levers, which are now emitting sparks. Spencer is embraced warmly by the Lady in the Radiator, as both white light and white noise crescendo.|$|E
