40|$|The crack {{initiation}} {{in the immediate}} vicinity of the <b>sharp</b> <b>edges</b> of dispers-ed inclusions {{plays an important role in}} the strength of dispersion composite materials. The purpose of this work is to duscuss the criteria for crack initia-tion {{in the immediate vicinity}} of the <b>sharp</b> <b>edges,</b> i. e. the maximum hoop stress criterion, the minimum strain-energy density criterion and the max-imum principal stress criterion. These criteria are based on the strength of stress singularity at the <b>sharp</b> <b>edges</b> of inclusions. Experiments are performed by using epoxy resin specimens containing a flat steel inclusion. From the ex-perimental results, it is found that the maximum principal stress criterion proposed by the authors is the best one for {{crack initiation}} in the immediate vicinity of the <b>sharp</b> <b>edges</b> of dispersed inclusions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Boundary element {{method in}} {{acoustics}} for Neumann boundary condition problems including <b>sharp</b> <b>edges</b> & corners is investigated. In previous acoustic boundary element method, acoustic pressure and normal velocity {{are the two}} variables at <b>sharp</b> <b>edges</b> & corners. However, the normal velocity at <b>sharp</b> <b>edges</b> & corners is discontinuous due to the indefinite normal vector. To avoid the indefinite normal vector and the discontinuous normal velocity at <b>sharp</b> <b>edges</b> & corners, normal vector of elemental node is defined and applied in the numerical implementation. Then the normal velocity is transformed to velocity which is unique even at <b>sharp</b> <b>edges</b> & corners. Such treatments {{make sure that all}} variables in the acoustic boundary element method are definite. Computational efficiency and accuracy of the new model are demonstrated by three cases of interior acoustic problems for which analytical solutions can be found and one classical exterior acoustic radiation problem. Curvilinear quadrilateral isoparametric elements are applied in the computation. It is found that the numerical results agree with corresponding analytical solutions quite well...|$|R

Special creep-resistant insulations such as Kynar (polyvinylidene fluoride) {{are used in}} wirewrap applications to resist cut-through due to the sharp corners of wire wrap terminals. Teflon insulation is resistant to elevated temperatures and has other desirable properties, but is notoriously vulnerable to cold-flow cut-through failures caused by creep.|$|E

25|$|Titanium is a {{metal that}} has a better strength-to-weight ratio, is more wear resistant, and more {{flexible}} than steel. Although less hard and unable to take as sharp an edge, carbides in the titanium alloy {{allow them to be}} heat-treated to a sufficient hardness. Ceramic blades are hard, brittle, and lightweight: they may maintain a <b>sharp</b> <b>edge</b> for years with no maintenance at all, but are as fragile as glass and will break if dropped on a hard surface. They are immune to common corrosion, and can only be sharpened on silicon carbide sandpaper and some grinding wheels. Plastic blades are not especially sharp and typically serrated. They are often disposable.|$|E

25|$|Dental {{findings}} are frequently used {{to differentiate between}} various theropods and to further inform cladistic phylogeny. Tooth morphology and dental evolutionary markers are prone to homoplasy and disappear or reappear throughout history. However, megalosaurids have several specific denture conditions that differentiate them from other basal theropods. One dental condition present in Megalosauridae is multiple enamel wrinkles near the carinae, the <b>sharp</b> <b>edge</b> or serration row of the tooth. Ornamented teeth and a well-marked enamel surface also characterize basal megalosaurids. The ornamentation and well-marked surface appears in early megalosaurids but disappears in derived megalosaurids, suggesting that the condition was lost over time as megalosaurids grew in size.|$|E

Most of Zakaria Tamer’s stories deal with people’s inhumanity to each other, the oppression of the poor by the rich and of the weak by the strong. The political and social problems of his own country, Syria, and of the Arab world, are reflected in the stories and sketches in the satirical style typical of his writing.|$|E
25|$|Traditional jian blades {{are usually}} of sanmei (three plate) construction, which {{involved}} sandwiching {{a core of}} hard steel between two plates of softer steel. The central plate protrudes slightly from its surrounding pieces, allowing for a <b>sharp</b> <b>edge,</b> while the softer spine protects the brittle core. Some blades had wumei or five plate construction, with two more soft plates being used at the central ridge. Bronze jian were often made in a somewhat similar manner: in this case an alloy with a high copper content {{would be used to}} make a resilient core and spine, while the edge would be made from a high-tin-content alloy for sharpness and welded onto the rest of the blade.|$|E

40|$|AbstractAnisotropic {{diffusion}} is {{used for}} both image enhancement and denoising. The Perona-Malik model makes use of anisotropic diffusion to filter out the noise. In Perona-Malik model the rate of diffusion is controlled by edge stopping function. The drawback of Perona-Malik model is that the <b>sharp</b> <b>edges</b> and fine details are not preserved well in the denoised image. But the <b>sharp</b> <b>edges</b> and fine details can be preserved well using appropriate edge stopping function. We have analysed the effect of different edge stopping functions in anisotropic diffusion {{in terms of how}} efficient they are in preserving edges. We have found that an edge stopping function which stops diffusion from low image gradient onwards well preserves the <b>sharp</b> <b>edges</b> and fine details. This property of an edge stopping function will also result in lower evolution in case of level set methods. But an edge stopping function which stops diffusion from high image gradient onwards will not preserve <b>sharp</b> <b>edges</b> and fine details, since they are blurred due to diffusion. We have also found that low values of gradient threshold parameter used in edge stopping function well preserves the <b>sharp</b> <b>edges</b> and fine details than high values of threshold parameter. By utilizing an edge stopping function which stops diffusion from low image gradient onwards or which has zero or insignificant value at low image gradient, we can well preserve the <b>sharp</b> <b>edges</b> and fine details in the denoised image...|$|R

As the arrangement is dragged forward, the <b>sharp</b> <b>edge</b> of the disc cuts the soil, and the concave surface of the rotating disc lifts and throws the soil to the side. It doesn't make as good a job as the mouldboard plough (but this is not considered a disadvantage, because it helps fight wind erosion), but it does lift and break up the soil (see disc harrow).|$|E
25|$|The {{pipe organ}} {{is another example}} of a {{potentially}} dipole sound source being driven as a monopole source. An air jet is directed at a <b>sharp</b> <b>edge</b> setting up flow oscillations as in the edge tone. The edge is part of a generally cylindrical tube of length L. An example is shown in the figure on the right. The unstable jet drives fluid alternately into the tube and out. The streamlines clearly are distorted from those of the free edge tone. There is a stagnation point opposite the source. The dashed lines, colored in red, are those most strongly modified. The red streamlines in the tube are now augmented by the oscillatory flow in the tube, a superposition of resistive and reactive dipole flow and resistive acoustic flow.|$|E
