5|$|A major {{contributor}} to the sedimentation of the Little Applegate River is McDonald Ditch, an irrigation ditch near McDonald Creek.

5|$|A new {{electoral system}} of two-round voting had been {{introduced}} for the 2004 regional elections, in part {{in an attempt to}} reduce the FN's influence in regional councils.

He appears to have had respect for Clarke, although he seems to have resented his influence at the Colonial Office, denying him an increase in salary or an official secretary. On Clarke's retirement, Milner wrote 'Personally I hardly think the office of Resident Commissioner any longer necessary'.|$|E

He was traded partway through the 1948 season to the Chicago White Sox, and a month after being traded became one of 18 MLB players to hit four home runs in one game.

5|$|Cavaliers can {{be subject}} to a genetic defect of the femur and knee called luxating patella. This {{condition}} is most often observed when a puppy is 4 to 6 months old. In the most serious cases, surgery may be indicated. The grading <b>system</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> patella runs from 1 (a tight knee), to 4 (a knee so loose that its cap is easily displaced). If a cavalier has a grade 1–2, physical rehabilitation therapy and exercise may reduce the grading and potentially avoid surgery. The grades 3–4 are most severe where surgery will most likely be needed to correct the problem to avoid the development of arthritis and lameness in the limb.|$|E
