5|$|Bell {{explained}} that he, Jed Whedon, and Tancharoen supervise {{all of the}} series' creative decisions, often consulting with Loeb. When the showrunners are writing the series, one person can write a script while the other two break stories, so that a <b>story</b> <b>can</b> be broken every few weeks. If the executive producers sign off on a story, {{a member of the}} series' writers room then produces an outline, gets notes on it from the showrunners, writes a full script, gets notes on it from ABC and the production crew, and then goes to set to produce the episode.|$|E
5|$|FreeSpace 2s {{story is}} brought out via {{narrative}} pre-rendered cutscenes, the pre- and post-mission briefings, {{as well as}} in-game chatter between non-player characters, and scripted mission events. The structure for the story is linear without any branching paths for alternate storylines, though there are optional covert missions which can further flesh out the story. The <b>story</b> <b>can</b> only be continued by clearing missions and progressing through the campaign. However, players are given the option to skip a mission if they have failed it five times in a row. This gives those {{who are interested in}} the story, but less skilled, the chance to continue on with the story without frustration.|$|E

5|$|The single reel drama, {{approximate}} 650 feet long, {{was released}} on June 17, 1910. Some trade publications list {{the length of the}} film as 1000 feet though. The United Kingdom release of the film may have had the name of the hero changed to Peter. A synopsis in The Bioscope on October 27, 1910 refers to the hero by the name Peter. This alternative name for the hero of the <b>story</b> <b>can</b> be found in the 1910 publication of Reader 1st-4th by D. Appleton and Company. A review in The Moving Picture World was neutral because it lacked specific praise or criticism of the production. The film had a wide release, advertisements for the showing in theaters include those in Pennsylvania, Oklahoma, Indiana, and Missouri. The film is presumed lost.|$|E
5|$|Zhou Tong's fictional life <b>story</b> <b>can</b> be pieced {{together}} from two sources: The Story of Yue Fei and Iron Arm, Golden Sabre. The Story of Yue Fei is a fictionalized retelling of Yue Fei's young life, military exploits, and execution. It {{was written by}} a native of Renhuo named Qian Cai (钱彩), who lived sometime between the reigns of the Kangxi and Qianlong emperors in the Qing dynasty. The preface dates the book's publication to 1684. It was deemed a threat by the Qing emperors and banned during the Qianlong era. In the novel, Zhou is portrayed as an elderly widower and Yue's only military arts tutor. The General's historical spear master Chen Guang is never mentioned. Zhou teaches Yue Fei and his sworn brothers military and literary arts from chapters two through five, before his death.|$|E

25|$|Essential {{elements}} of the genre include storytelling, exploration, and puzzle solving. Adventure games {{have been described as}} puzzles embedded in a narrative framework, where games involve narrative content that a player unlocks piece by piece over time. While the puzzles that players encounter through the <b>story</b> <b>can</b> be arbitrary, those that do not pull the player out of the narrative are considered examples of good design.|$|E
25|$|The Official <b>Story</b> <b>can</b> be {{considered}} alongside {{a group of}} other films that {{were the first to}} be made in Argentina after the downfall in 1983 of the last Argentine dictator, General Galtieri, and his autocratic regime. These films deal frankly with the repression, the torture, and the disappearances during Argentina's Dirty War in the 1970s and early 1980s; they include Funny Dirty Little War (1983) and Night of the Pencils (1986). A second group of films, which includes Verónico Cruz (1988) uses metaphor and hints at wider socio-political issues.|$|E
25|$|Genealogists {{have also}} disputed Haley's {{research}} and conclusions in Roots. The Gambian griot {{turned out not}} to be a real griot, and the story of Kunta Kinte appears to have been a case of circular reporting, in which Haley's own words were repeated back to him. None of the written records in Virginia and North Carolina line up with the Roots story until after the Civil War. Some elements of Haley's family <b>story</b> <b>can</b> be found in the written records, but the most likely genealogy would be different from the one described in Roots.|$|E

25|$|In some Native Hawaiian communities, {{there is}} a {{constant}} use of “talk story” which plays an essential role in promoting solidarity in the community by not overpowering or making the members of the community feel inadequate for not understanding something. Talk <b>story</b> <b>can</b> consist of recalled events, folktales, and joking. Joking can be used to tease and guide the children about how to do a chore better or to avoid serious trouble. Talk story relates to an Indigenous way of learning by providing conversations such as narratives and dramatizations with verbal and nonverbal communication between the elder and children.|$|E
25|$|The {{remainder}} of the <b>story</b> <b>can</b> be gleaned from inscriptions in south India and by inference. The Sinhala army {{is known to have}} scored a number of victories over the Chola army. However, the Pallavarayanpettai inscription indicates that Lankapura was defeated in 1171 and his head was nailed to the gates of Madurai by Rajadhiraja Chola II (1163–1178). Nevertheless the forces of Parākramabāhu appear to have remained in Pandya Nadu, scoring victories over Rajadhiraja II in 1176. It was not until 1181 when Virapandu III was defeated that the they withdrew from Pandya Nadu, retaining only the area around Rameswaram.|$|E
25|$|Another detail which casts {{doubt on}} the story is the fact that, {{according}} to Blair, {{there was never any}} Dr. Thorne in the employ of the Army or indeed of the Federal Government in the 1860s. According to Blair, the origin of this <b>story</b> <b>can</b> be traced to a doctor named Thorne who was in private practice in New Mexico in the 1860s. Thorne claimed that he was taken captive by Navajos in 1854, and that during his captivity he had discovered a rich gold vein. Thorne related his claims to three U.S. soldiers in about 1858. The three soldiers set out to find the gold, but without success. Over the decades, this tale was gradually absorbed into the Lost Dutchman's story.|$|E

25|$|Gameplay is linear, {{and each}} main quest must be {{completed}} in sequence before the <b>story</b> <b>can</b> proceed, {{although there are some}} optional side-quests, which {{do not have to be}} completed immediately. However, all side-quests must be completed within the act in which they are assigned. There are relatively few NPCs in the game, with whom only those who are part of a quest or side-quest may be interacted. Weapons, armor and items are only available for purchase from one location at a time, and become increasingly expensive and more powerful as the game progresses. The HUD features the option to use either a transparent map that covers most of the screen, or a mini-map, with the player also given the option to turn the map off entirely.|$|E
25|$|Reviews can {{be given}} by both {{anonymous}} and registered users of most sites, and sites are often programmed to notify the author of new feedback, making them a common way for readers and authors online to communicate directly. This system is intended for a type of bond between the reader and the writer, as well as helping the author improve his or her writing skills through constructive criticism, enabling {{him or her to}} produce a better work next time. Occasionally, unmoderated review systems are abused to send flames, spam, or trolling messages. As a result, the author of the <b>story</b> <b>can</b> either disable or enable anonymous reviews, depending on his/her preference. Internet fan fiction gives young writers a wider audience for their literary efforts than ever before, resulting in improved literacy.|$|E
25|$|The Sanskrit {{version of}} the Panchatantra text gives names to the animal characters, but these names are {{creative}} with double meanings. The names connote the character observable in nature but also map a human personality that a reader can readily identify. For example, the deer characters are presented {{as a metaphor for}} charming, innocent, peaceful and tranquil personality who is a target for those who seek a prey to exploit, while crocodiles are presented as a symbolism for those with dangerous intent hiding beneath welcoming ambiance (waters of a lotus flower-laden pond). Dozens of different types of wildlife found in India are thus named, and they constitute an array of symbolic characters in the Panchatantra. Thus, the names of the animals evoke layered meaning that resonates with the reader, and the same <b>story</b> <b>can</b> be read at different levels.|$|E

25|$|Storytelling is a {{means for}} sharing and {{interpreting}} experiences. Peter L. Berger says human life is narratively rooted, humans construct their lives and shape their world into homes in terms of these groundings and memories. Stories are universal in that they can bridge cultural, linguistic and age-related divides. Storytelling can be adaptive for all ages, leaving out the notion of age segregation. Storytelling {{can be used as}} a method to teach ethics, values and cultural norms and differences. Learning is most effective when it takes place in social environments that provide authentic social cues about how knowledge is to be applied. Stories function as a tool to pass on knowledge in a social context. So, every story has 3 parts. First, The setup (The Hero's world before the adventure starts). Second, The Confrontation (The hero's world turned upside down). Third, The Resolution (Hero conquer's villain, but it's not enough for Hero to survive. The Hero or World must be transformed). Any <b>story</b> <b>can</b> be framed in such format.|$|E
25|$|The fictional {{history of}} Westeros {{stretches}} back some twelve thousand years. The Ice and Fire <b>story</b> <b>can</b> {{be considered to}} be set in a post-magic world where people no longer believe in dragons and the Others. The characters understand only the natural aspects of their world, but the magical elements like the Others are not within their understanding. Coming from an impoverished family background of former wealth, Martin always felt attracted to stories of fallen civilizations and lost empires. The lost empire of Valyria in Ice and Fire was once a high civilization similar to Rome before the Dark Ages. These elements may give the story a poignant sadness. The Wall, which Martin believes to be unique in fantasy, was inspired by Martin's visit to Hadrian's Wall in the North of England close to the border with Scotland. Looking out over the hills, Martin wondered what a Roman centurion from the Mediterranean would feel, not knowing what threats might come from the north. The size, length and magical powers of the wall were adjusted for genre demands. Similarly the Titan, an extremely large statue in the city of Braavos, is comparable to the real life Colossus of Rhodes.|$|E
25|$|A feature {{not found}} in {{previous}} Souls games are Chalice Dungeons. Chalice Dungeons are randomly generated dungeons that vary in depth and difficulty, and can be reformed by performing a ritual with a Chalice and other certain materials in the Hunter's Dream. Chalice Dungeons are optional and provide additional content to the player. Gameplay {{is much the same}} as the main story in that it contains various areas and enemies that the player must overcome to complete the Dungeon. Each Chalice Dungeon contains multiple bosses that the player must defeat to progress through the Dungeon's levels. Special types of lootable chests that are {{not found in}} the main story are hidden throughout the Dungeons, providing the player with the materials to generate more Dungeons. One major difference between the main story and the Chalice Dungeons is the world design. In the main story world of Yharnam, the design is open ended, more spacious, and is a mixture of indoor and outdoor environments. Chalice Dungeons are only indoors, cramped, and contain many traits of a typical dungeon. The branching paths featured in the main story are still present in the Chalice Dungeons. Another important difference are the objectives. In the main story, players journey through many different locations with many different objectives. In the Chalice Dungeons, the player's basic objective is to locate a door, then find the lever to open the door, which is located elsewhere, and then battle the boss behind the door. After the boss is defeated, the player enters the next area, which will be completely different, and completes the same goal. The cycle repeats at least three times before the entire Chalice Dungeon is cleared. Chalice Dungeons, like the main <b>story,</b> <b>can</b> be played alone or cooperatively with other players.|$|E
