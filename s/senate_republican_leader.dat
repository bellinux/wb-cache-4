Believing the demographic and salary issues to be irrelevant, he accused CBS of bowing to the anti-establishment, anti-war faction {{at the height of}} the Vietnam War, saying his conservative political and social views caused the network to turn against him. He had invited prominent Republicans, including Vice President Spiro Agnew and <b>Senate</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Leader</b> Everett Dirksen, to appear on his program.|$|E
5|$|In 1906, Roosevelt {{backed the}} Hepburn Bill, {{imposing}} railroad regulation. Many Republicans initially {{wanted nothing to}} do with the bill, and <b>Senate</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>leader</b> Nelson Aldrich entrusted management of the bill to Tillman. Aldrich hoped the outspoken South Carolinian would cause the defeat of the bill. To Aldrich's surprise, Tillman soberly and competently conducted the bill through much of the legislative process. Tillman withdrew from the bill (though he voted for it) after Roosevelt got a provision for federal court review of agency decisions included, which Tillman opposed. The president and the southern senator ended on worse terms than before, but there was great public attention on the Hepburn Bill, and Tillman gained considerable respect for his role.|$|E

However, on February 12, 2009, citing [...] "irresolvable conflicts" [...] with the Obama administration on issues surrounding the United States census and American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, Gregg announced he was withdrawing his nomination for the position of Commerce Secretary and remaining in the Senate.|$|R

Lott had resigned his position as <b>Senate</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Leader</b> in 2002, following controversy surrounding his perceived support of Sen. Strom Thurmond's (R-SC) segregationist politics. After the party {{lost control of the}} Senate in November 2006, Republicans elected Lott to the post of Minority Whip (the second-highest Republican position in the Senate.) During the closed-door election, Sen. Judd Gregg (R-NH) nominated Lott for the position. Smith then seconded the nomination and delivered a supportive address before casting his vote.|$|E
25|$|In 1998, Senate Minority Whip Wendell Ford {{decided to}} retire after 24 {{years in the}} Senate—at the time, the longest term in Kentucky history (a record later surpassed by <b>Senate</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Leader</b> Mitch McConnell).

Bunning defeated Baesler by just over half a percentage point. The race was very close; Bunning only won by swamping Baesler in the 4th by a margin that Baesler couldn't make up {{in the rest of}} the state (Baesler barely won the 6th).|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} years of the 20th century, Republican spokesmen for big {{business}} in Congress included Speaker of the House Joe Cannon and <b>Senate</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Leader</b> Nelson Aldrich of Rhode Island. Aldrich introduced the Sixteenth Amendment, which allowed the federal government to collect an income tax; he also set in motion the design of the Federal Reserve System, which began in 1913. Pro-business conservatives supported many Progressive Era reforms, especially those opposed to corruption and inefficiency in government, and called for purification of politics. Conservative Senator John Sherman sponsored the nation's basic anti-trust law in 1890, and conservatives generally supported anti-trust in the name of opposing monopoly and opening up opportunities for small business. The Efficiency Movement attracted many Progressive Republicans, such as Nelson W. Aldrich and later President Herbert Hoover; with its pro-business, quasi-engineering approach to solve social and economic problems. The issues of prohibition and woman suffrage split the conservatives.|$|E
