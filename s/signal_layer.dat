A design guideline was found by observing the variation of link performance, depending on parameters such as channel length, baud rate, {{and the number of}} <b>signal</b> <b>layers.</b> The channel performance was investigated using a newly developed parametric simulation environment supported by a fast multilayered via transition modeling tool. The extensive parameter sweep simulations showed that an allowable channel reach has a lower and an upper bound limited by stub via effect and trace loss, respectively. Under a specified channel reach, the aggregate data bandwidths were estimated using a particle swarm optimization routine, and a tradeoff relation among the wiring capability and the maximum allowable data rate was observed.

40|$|Abstract: Multi-Chip Modules (MCM) {{for high}} speed digital {{applications}} use meshed planes between the <b>signal</b> <b>layers</b> for shielding and power supply. Both wave impedances {{of the signal}} lines and coupling behavior between different <b>signal</b> <b>layers</b> {{are influenced by the}} properties of these meshed planes. Together with the quick increase of operating frequency of high-speed integrated circuits (IC), this may cause problems such as dispersion, crosstalk, and packaging effects which must be investigated by means of simulations. The Partial Elements Equivalent Circuit (PEEC) method has proven to be suitable to deal with such systems, particularly to investigate ground bounce effects. For analysis of large interconnect and packaging structures, however, the computing time increases very rapidly with the system’s complexity. To reduce the costs of calculation, especially for inductance and capacitance calculation, a method is introduced that leads to both accurate and fast results. The validity of the modeling is verified with Sparameter calculations of blocking measures in a multilayer board and shall be used for investigations of multichip modules. 1...|$|R

Source: Volvo Penta’s Image Gallery. i The marine leisure boat industry comprises many different systems, with different protocols, that need to exchange information. This is enabled by interface nodes called gateway that translates signals in between. From a number of protocol specifications, including NMEA 2000 and NMEA 0183, a list of requirements are compiled and a software platform is developed based upon them. The software design is based on layers similar to the well-known Open System Interconnection (OSI) model which communicate with each other over well-defined interfaces. Typically the lower level protocol layer receives and transmits information onto the network and parses signals to and from the <b>signal</b> <b>layer</b> which handles signal validity and signal scaling.

40|$|Abstract—Although the {{discontinuity}} {{structures in}} the microstrip transmission lines such as a gap and bend have been largely studied, the three-dimensional edge effects, skin effects and metal losses have hardly been analyzed. In this paper, modeling of transmission line with bend and gap discontinuity with equation based process technology independent method are developed. The effect of the <b>signal</b> <b>layer</b> thickness is fully included in the model. Gap model is verified with EM simulation and implemented in BiCMOS technology on Silicon substrate. The bend is modeled with transmission line with effective length for the discontinuity area, and the equations have been generated. The bend model is compared with EM simulations, existing bend model generated with curve-fitted method and measured results. Gap and bend are enabled as library device in a 0. 13 µm SiGe BiCMOS process design kit. Both bend and gap device have a scalable layout pattern and a schematic symbol, which allows users to choose them with different dimensions and metal stacks. In addition, the models can be migrated into other process technologies with different metal options. Very good match have been achieved among model, EM simulation and measurements for different process technologies and metal stacks. 1...|$|E

Laminated {{thin films}} {{composed}} of V 2 O 5 and Pd (or Pt-Pd) layers were deposited on glass substrates {{and the end}} faces of multimode optical fibers, and the sensitive behaviors of the thin films to hydrogen gas were studied using a UV-visible spectrophotometer and an optical fiber sensor’s experimental setup. Both {{the thickness of the}} V 2 O 5 layer and that of the Pd layer have obvious influences on the sensitivity performance of the Pd/V 2 O 5 films. The Pd (30 nm) /V 2 O 5 (280 nm) film deposited on a glass substrate is sensitive to 0. 1 % hydrogen and the highest change in relative transmittance is about 25 % when exposed to 4 % hydrogen. Pd/V 2 O 5 films were coated onto the end faces of multimode fibers to form optical fiber sensors. The response time of the Pd (20 nm) /V 2 O 5 (280 nm) sensor is about 50 s and the change in relative reflected light intensity is about 18 % upon exposure to 4 % hydrogen.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the authentication {{and the data}} integrity services in two prominent emerging contexts such as Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) and the Internet of Things (IoT), analyzing various techniques proposed in the literature and proposing novel methods. GNSS, among which Global Positioning System (GPS) is the most widely used, provide affordable access to accurate positioning and timing with global coverage. There are several motivations to attack GNSS: from personal privacy reasons, to disrupting critical infrastructures for terrorist purposes. The generation and transmission of spoofing signals either for research purpose or for actually mounting attacks has become easier in recent years {{with the increase of}} the computational power and with the availability on the market of Software Defined Radios (SDRs), general purpose radio devices that can be programmed to both receive and transmit RF signals. In this thesis a security analysis of the main currently proposed data and signal level authentication mechanisms for GNSS is performed. A novel GNSS data level authentication scheme, SigAm, that combines the security of asymmetric cryptographic primitives with the performance of hash functions or symmetric key cryptographic primitives is proposed. Moreover, a generalization of GNSS <b>signal</b> <b>layer</b> security code estimation attacks and defenses is provided, improving their performance, and an autonomous anti-spoofing technique that exploits semi-codeless tracking techniques is introduced. Finally, physical layer authentication techniques for IoT are discussed, providing a trade-off between the performance of the authentication protocol and energy expenditure of the authentication process...|$|E

40|$|SummaryRepeated cocaine {{exposure}} triggers adaptations {{in layer}} 5 / 6 glutamatergic neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) that promote behavioral sensitization and drug-seeking behavior. While suppression of metabotropic inhibitory signaling has {{been implicated in}} these behaviors, underlying mechanisms are unknown. Here, we show that Girk/KIR 3 channels mediate most of the GABAB receptor (GABABR) -dependent inhibition of layer 5 / 6 pyramidal neurons in the mPFC and that repeated cocaine suppresses this pathway. This adaptation was selective for GABABR-dependent Girk <b>signaling</b> in <b>layer</b> 5 / 6 pyramidal neurons of the prelimbic cortex (PrLC) and involved a D 1 / 5 dopamine receptor- and phosphorylation-dependent internalization of GABABR and Girk channels.
