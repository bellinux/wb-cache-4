25|$|The {{long term}} {{plan of the}} Rees family, pursued by their son Howard, has been to build houses on the area of {{industrial}} activity, which would provide the capital required to both restore the house and estate buildings, and establish leisure and tourism facilities. These facilities would then aim to provide the longer term income stream needed to provide a <b>sustainable</b> <b>future</b> for the buildings and parkland. Plans were first submitted in 2012, and the Market activities moved elsewhere and site clearance begun. The extensive consultation with numerous interested parties caused, in late 2013, a temporary {{period in which the}} firm was placed in administration. However planning permission was granted in late 2014, {{on the grounds that the}} building of 46 houses on the 10 ha industrial site, along with 100 log cabins and a leisure complex, constituted an 'enabling development', which would provide the resources for restoration and a <b>sustainable</b> <b>future</b> for the house and estate.|$|E

25|$|Because {{of their}} remote nature, {{prognosis}} and health-monitoring systems on offshore wind turbines will {{become much more}} necessary. They would enable better planning just-in-time maintenance, thereby reducing the operations and maintenance costs. According to a report from a coalition of researchers from universities, industry, and government (supported by the Atkinson Center for a <b>Sustainable</b> <b>Future),</b> making field data from these turbines available would be invaluable in validating complex analysis codes used for turbine design.

25|$|Ehrlich {{has argued}} that {{humanity}} has simply deferred the disaster {{by the use of}} more intensive agricultural techniques, such as those introduced during the so-called Green Revolution. Ehrlich claims that increasing populations and affluence are increasingly stressing the global environment, due to such factors as loss of biodiversity, overfishing, global warming, urbanization, chemical pollution and competition for raw materials. He maintains that due to growing global incomes, reducing consumption and human population is critical to protecting the environment and maintaining living standards, and that current rates of growth are still too great for a <b>sustainable</b> <b>future.</b>|$|E
25|$|The U.S. Department of Energy’s 2008 report 20% Wind Energy by 2030 envisioned {{that wind}} power could supply 20% of all U.S. {{electric}} power, {{which included a}} contribution of 4% to the nation’s total electric power from offshore wind power. In order to achieve this, however, significant advances in cost, performance and reliability are needed, based on a 2011 report from a coalition of researchers from universities, industry, and government, supported by the Atkinson Center for a <b>Sustainable</b> <b>Future.</b> Obtaining 20% from wind requires about 305 GW of wind turbines, an increase of 16 GW/year after 2018, or an average increase of 14.6%/year, and transmission line improvements. Analysts estimate around 25 GW of added US wind power in 2016-18, depending on the Clean Power Plan and PTC extensions. After the current PTC phase-out in 2021, additional wind power capacity {{is expected to be}} around 5 GW per year.|$|E

25|$|Offshore wind {{resource}} characteristics span a {{range of}} spatial and temporal scales and field data on external conditions. For the North Sea, wind turbine energy is around 30kWh/m2 of sea area, per year, delivered to grid. The energy per sea area is roughly independent of turbine size. Necessary data includes water depth, currents, seabed, migration, and wave action, all of which drive mechanical and structural loading on potential turbine configurations. Other factors include marine growth, salinity, icing, and the geotechnical characteristics of the sea or lake bed. A number of things are {{necessary in order to}} attain the necessary information on these subjects. Existing hardware for these measurements includes Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR), Sonic Detection and Ranging (SODAR), radar, autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV), and remote satellite sensing, although these technologies should be assessed and refined, according to a report from a coalition of researchers from universities, industry, and government, supported by the Atkinson Center for a <b>Sustainable</b> <b>Future.</b>|$|E
