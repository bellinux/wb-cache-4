5|$|Pipes are {{arranged}} by timbre and pitch into ranks. A rank is a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>pipes</b> {{of the same}} timbre but multiple pitches (one for each note on the keyboard), which is mounted (usually vertically) onto a windchest. The stop mechanism admits air to each rank. For a given pipe to sound, the stop governing the pipe's rank must be engaged, and the key corresponding to its pitch must be depressed. Ranks of pipes are organized into groups called divisions. Each division generally is played from its own keyboard and conceptually comprises an individual instrument within the organ.|$|E

After they were installed, the expanded organ was rededicated with two recitals in 1992, both including the Toccata. An annual recital series was established that year as well, later with the help of a state grant.|$|E
25|$|Twin-turbo or {{bi-turbo}} designs {{have two}} separate turbochargers operating {{in either a}} sequence or in parallel. In a parallel configuration, both turbochargers are fed one-half of the engine’s exhaust. In a sequential setup one turbocharger runs at low speeds and the second turns on at a predetermined engine speed or load. Sequential turbochargers further reduce turbo lag, but require an intricate <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>pipes</b> to properly feed both turbochargers.|$|E
40|$|Pipe dreams {{represent}} permutations pictorially as {{a series}} <b>of</b> crossing <b>pipes.</b> Re-cent applications <b>of</b> <b>pipe</b> dreams include the calculation of Schubert polynomials, fillings of moon polyominoes, and in the combinatorics of antidiagonal simplicial complexes. These applications associate pipe dreams to words of elementary sym-metric transpositions via a canonical mapping. However, this canonical mapping {{is by no means}} the only way <b>of</b> mapping <b>pipe</b> dreams to permutation words. We define sensical mappings from pipe dreams to words and prove sensical mappings are in bijection with standard shifted tableaux of triangular shape. We characterize the <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>pipe</b> dreams associated to a given word (under any sensical map) using step ladder moves. These moves induce a partial order on the <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>pipe</b> dreams mapping to a given word, yielding a distributive lattice. ...|$|R

The pumps and water regulators of the hydraulis were replaced by an inflated leather bag in the 2nd century AD, and true bellows {{began to appear in}} the Eastern Roman Empire in the 6th or 7th century AD.

500|$|Carey {{performed}} [...] "Obsessed" [...] {{on several}} televised appearances since its release. On August 5, 2009, Carey performed the song {{live for the}} first time on the fourth season of the talent competition, America's Got Talent. Carey, appearing in jeans and a black top, was accompanied by several male dancers and three back-up singers. As she performed the song, the dancers hoisted her into the air several times, and carried her to several areas on the stage. During the performance, several white lights flashed, while monitors behind the dancers showed images of Carey and the video. Breanne Heldman from E! Entertainment Television criticized several aspects of the performance. She described the lighting as [...] "anxiety inducing", and wrote, [...] "That said, no one is doubting the singer's impressive <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>pipes,</b> but—frighteningly jarring lighting and quick edits aside—did she actually utilize them on 'America's Got Talent' last night?" [...] Aside from questioning the singers live vocals, she also felt Carey seemed [...] "robotic", and didn't show effort or interest in the performance. A reviewer from Idolator also was critical on the performance, asking if there was [...] "anything good about [...] ". He claimed Carey was lip-syncing, and described it as [...] "lackadaisical", and wrote, [...] "the backup dancers’ moves would have probably received a big red 'X' from at least one of the judges." ...|$|E
500|$|When Liszt {{started writing}} symphonic poems, [...] "he {{had very little}} {{experience}} in handling an orchestra ... {{his knowledge of the}} technique of instrumentation was defective and he had as yet composed hardly anything for the orchestra." [...] For these reasons he relied first on his assistants August Conradi and Joachim Raff to fill the gaps in his knowledge and find his [...] "orchestral voice". Raff, [...] "a gifted composer with an imaginative grasp of the orchestra", offered close assistance to Liszt. Also helpful were the virtuosi present at that time in the Weimarian Court orchestra, such as trombonist Moritz Nabich, harpist Jeanne Pohl, concertmaster Joseph Joachim and violinist Edmund Singer. [...] " [...] mixed daily with these musicians, and their discussions must have been filled with 'shop talk.'" [...] Both Singer and cellist Bernhard Cossmann were widely experienced orchestral players who probably knew the different instrumental effects a string section could produceknowledge that Liszt would have found invaluable, and about which he might have had many discussions with the two men. With such a range of talent from which to learn, Liszt may have actually mastered orchestration reasonably quickly. By 1853, he felt he no longer needed Raff's assistance and their professional association ended in 1856. Also, in 1854 Liszt received a specially designed instrument called a [...] "piano-organ" [...] from the firm of Alexandre and fils in Paris. This huge instrument, a combination of piano and organ, was basically a one-piece orchestra that contained three keyboards, eight registers, a pedal board and a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>pipes</b> that reproduced the sounds of all the wind instruments. With it, Liszt could try out various instrumental combinations at his leisure as a further aid for his orchestration.|$|E

2500|$|MTV praised Perry's vocals, though {{felt the}} lyrics were [...] "clunky". Slant Magazine {{stated that the}} song is [...] "not an {{actively}} painful listen. Sure, the would-be inspirational lyrics ('Baby you're a firework/Come on show them what you're worth') are nonsensical, ... but the chorus gains some momentum and the song would work well enough in a club setting that you could forgive its otherwise glaring weaknesses." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic chose [...] "Firework" [...] among the top tracks on the album, Nick Levine of Digital Spy gave the song five out of five stars, calling it [...] "a straight up self-empowerment anthem wrapped in a Coldplay-on-poppers club banger from the Stargate team." [...] PopMatters wrote that [...] "Firework" [...] is [...] "the record's last hurrah; though nothing particularly memorable.....'Firework' has at least a bit of staying power". The Washington Post described the song as [...] "too mushy". Al Fox of BBC Music said that the song [...] "displays a breezy maturity and serious <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>pipes,</b> a true demonstration of Perry's musicianship without contradicting the kittenish mischief of the bigger picture." [...] The song was nominated for Record of the Year at the 54th Grammy Awards.|$|E

2500|$|Critics also applauded Clarkson's vocal {{performance}} harmoniously interweaving {{with the}} song's arrangement. Mark Hogan of Spin wrote: [...] "American Idol’s most successful champion demonstrates just how {{she plans to}} keep up with the young guns on the triumphant midtempo song, which moderately incorporates the EDM builds recently in favor with everyone from Pink to Taylor Swift. Clarkson's always-powerful voice still sets her apart from the club-pop pack. If there's a whiff of lite-FM maturity, it feels earned." [...] Amy Sciarretto of Popcrush gave the song three and a half stars out of five, she wrote: [...] "It’s her voice and the undulating beat that make this song a toe-tapper from the opening note to the closing one. The organic tone of Clarkson’s voice is what prevents the song from sounding too [...] "synthy" [...] or studio-created, which is often an issue with pop songs. There is no trickery here; it's all Clarkson being a vocal diva." [...] Jenna Hally Rubenstein of MTV Buzzworthy remarked, [...] "As you might expect, [...] "Catch My Breath" [...] is a sunny, synth-laden pop jam that showcases Kelly's unreal <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>pipes,</b> and speaks to the difficulties that come with staying in the record industry." [...] Bené Viera of VH1 remarked, [...] "The song is celebratory in that it acknowledges she’s going to live her life the way that makes her happy. Her voice flows from a leveled alto to a high near-scream for the chorus." [...] On March 5, 2013, Billboard ranked the song #49 in its list of Top 100 American Idol Hits of All Time.|$|E
