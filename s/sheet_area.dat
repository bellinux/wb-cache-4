Utilizing a high-resolution coupled ice-shelf-ocean model, we aim at understanding the ocean circulation in Nares Strait and the mechanism of oceanic heat supply below the ice shelf as well as quantifying the basal mass loss. The numerical model {{is based on the}} Finite-Volume Community Ocean Model (FVCOM), taking advantage of its flexible spatial resolution that can follow the topography. A regional model domain has been set up, which spans the greater Nares Strait region and covers Petermann Fjord with 200 -m horizontal resolution and includes the Petermann Glacier geometry. As a first step, we focus on the role of tides for transporting ocean water into the ice-shelf cavity. Tidal simulations are validated with available observations, demonstrating the capability of FVCOM in reproducing the tidal current pattern in Nares Strait. Lagrangian particle trajectories are computed to explore the water exchange in Petermann Fjord. It is found that tidal oscillations in Nares Strait lead to a residual circulation in the fjord and inside the ice-shelf cavity.

The Ural Range study area, centrally located in the Cargelligo 1 : 100 000 map <b>sheet</b> <b>area,</b> was mapped at 1 : 10 000 scale. Seventeen principal volcanic facies were identified in the study area, dominated by felsic coherent facies (rhyolite and dacite) and associated monomictic breccia and siltstone-matrix monomictic breccia facies. Subordinate volcaniclastic facies include the pumice-rich breccia facies association, rhyolite - dacite -siltstone breccia facies and fiamme-siltstone breccia facies. The sedimentary facies association includes mixed-provenance and non-volcanic sandstone to conglomerate, black mudstone, micaceous quartz sandstone and foliated mudstone. The succession was derived from at least two intrabasinal volcanic centres. One, in the north, was largely effusive and intrusive, building a lava - sill complex.

40|$|Collective {{migration}} {{is a critical}} biological process that involves the coordinated migration {{of a group of}} cells connected via adherens junctions. These cell-cell adhesions are regulated by intracellular and extracellular calcium, and require controlled turnover {{in order to maintain the}} structural integrity of migrating cell sheets. In single fish keratocytes, intracellular calcium signaling via stretch-activated calcium channels facilitates migration by regulating cytoskeletal contractility and cell-substratum adhesion turnover. The role of calcium signaling in collectively migrating keratocyte sheets remains unknown. In this study, we investigate the effects of modulating the frequency of calcium transients in goldfish keratocyte sheets, using EGTA and Thapsigargin, on sheet morphology and cohesiveness. We also use varying serum concentrations and Gadolinium to investigate the role of serum and stretch-activated calcium channels, respectively, in the production of calcium transients and in the maintenance of sheet cohesiveness. We find that calcium transient frequencies diminish in the presence of EGTA, Thapsigargin, and Gadolinium, or in serum-free medium. These results suggest that, in keratocyte sheets, calcium transients occur via stretch-activated channels and require both extracellular calcium and intracellular calcium stores, as well as serum. <b>Sheet</b> <b>area</b> and cohesiveness decrease in Thapsigargin-treated cells, and sheet cohesion is reduced in cells treated with EGTA and serum-free medium.

40|$|This {{paper is}} devoted to analyze the special class of {{turbulent}} premixed flames that we call intermediate steady propagation (ISP) flames. These flames are common to industrial premixed combustion chambers which operate at intensive turbulence when velocity pulsations are {{significantly higher than the}} flamelet combustion velocity. They are characterized by a practically constant turbulent combustion velocity, controlled by turbulence, chemistry and molecular processes, and by an increasing flame width, controlled mainly by turbulent diffusion. The main content of this work is a description of physical backgrounds and outcome of the original asymptotical (i. e., valid at high Re and Da numbers) premixed combustion model, that, from a methodological point of view, is close to Kolmogorov analysis of developed turbulence at high Re numbers. Our analysis starts from the thickened and strongly wrinkled flamelets combustion mechanism. Quantitative results for this model are based on the Kolmogorov assumption of the equilibrium fine-scale turbulence and on additional assumption of the universal small-scale structure of the wrinkled flamelet sheet. From this background it is possible to deduce formulas for the thickened flamelets parameters and the flamelet <b>sheet</b> <b>area</b> and hence the turbulent combustion velocity of the premixed flame. These formulas are used for the closure of the combustion equation written in terms of a progress variable leading to the so called turbulent flame closure (TFC) model for the numerical simulation of ISP flames.
