Seven to twelve days later the animals were subjected to 30 min of reversible forebrain ischemia.

Simultaneous cutting of the 3 major afferent pathways significantly reduced CA 1 neuronal damage compared to the unlesioned side (P less than 0. 001) or to sham-lesioned controls (P less than 0. 001). Selective lesions of the fimbria/fornix but not the perforant or the <b>Schäffer</b> <b>collateral</b> <b>pathways</b> also protected against ischemic CA 1 damage.

Previous research in acute brain slices of transgenic animals expressing constitutively active CREB variants has revealed that enhancing CREB activity increases the intrinsic excitability of neurons and facilitates the late phase of long-term potentiation (LTP) in the <b>Schaffer</b> <b>collateral</b> <b>pathway.</b> Here, we report similar changes in plasticity at the <b>Schaffer</b> <b>collateral</b> <b>pathway</b> in alert behaving mice.

In addition, classical eyeblink conditioning intransgenic mice and control littermates showed larger conditioned responses in mutant mice that were associated to at ransient increase in the acquisition rate and in the concomitant learning-dependent change in synaptic strength. The sustained chronic activation of CREB activity, however, impaired the performance in this task. Our experiments demonstrate that the sustained enhancement of CREB function alters the physiology and plasticity of hippocampal circuits in behaving animals and that these changes have important consequences in associative learning. © 2012 the authors.

We have used an immunocytochemical method to visualize and quantify the pattern of autophosphorylation of CaMKII in hippocampal slices after tetanization of the <b>Schaffer</b> <b>collateral</b> <b>pathway.</b> Thirty minutes after tetanic stimulation, autophosphorylated CaM kinase II (P-CaMKII) is significantly increased in area CA 1 both in apical dendrites and in pyramidal cell somas. In apical dendrites, this increase is accompanied by an equally significant increase in staining for nonphosphorylated CaM kinase II. Thus, the increase in P-CaMKII appears to be secondary to an increase in the total amount of CaMKII. In neuronal somas, however, the increase in P-CaMKII is not accompanied by an increase in the total amount of CaMKII. We suggest that tetanic stimulation of the <b>Schaffer</b> <b>collateral</b> <b>pathway</b> may induce new synthesis of CaMKII molecules in the apical dendrites, which contain mRNA encoding its alpha-subunit. In neuronal somas, however, tetanic stimulation appears to result in long-lasting increases in P-CaMKII independent of an increase in the total amount of CaMKII. Our findings are consistent with a role for autophosphorylation of CaMKII in the induction and/or maintenance of long-term potentiation, but they indicate that the effects of tetanus on the kinase and its activity are not confined to synapses and may involve induction of new synthesis of kinase in dendrites as well as increases in the level of autophosphorylated kinase...|$|E

Two independent <b>Schaffer</b> <b>collateral</b> <b>pathways</b> were stimulated in hippocampal slices. The field EPSP (fEPSP) response evoked in one pathway (the weak pathway) was small, whereas a large response, usually 80 – 90 % of the maximum, was evoked in the strong pathway. After recording of the baseline fEPSP evoked at 0. 033 Hz, LTP of the weak pathway could be associatively induced by paired stimulation of the weak and strong pathways 100 times at 6 sec intervals, with stimulation of the weak pathway preceded 3 – 10 msec. However, pairing protocols with an interval between stimulation of the two pathways � 10 msec resulted in no LTP. The induced LTP was NMDA receptor dependent, because 50 �M D,L-APV blocked its induction. Bath application of 1 �M isoproterenol enhanced LTP by increasing the window of the stimulation interval up to 15 msec but did not affect the magnitude of the LTP induced by pairing protocols with intervals � 10 msec. Similar results were obtained when the experiments were repeated using whole-cell recording. These results suggest that activation of �-adrenergic receptors can enhance associative LTP by increasing the width of the time window rather than the magnitude of the LTP. Enhancement of LTP by �-adrenergic receptors was blocked in slices by pretreatment with inhibitors of protein kinase A or mitogen-activated protein kinase, suggesting that these signaling cascades are involved in this process.

Treatment of hippocampal slices with either chondroitinase ABC (Proteus vulgaris) or heparitinase (Flavobacterium heparinum) resulted in dose-dependent attenuation of LTP in correlation with loss of PN, thus supporting roles of perineuronal glycosaminoglycan moieties in maintaining LTP. Our finding of heparanase expression at the CA 1 hippocampal neurons further led us to hypothesize that heparanase functions as the mammalian counterpart of heparitinase in the regulation of synaptic plasticity. We approached this with hippocampal neurons in culture and found that only the pro-form of heparanase but not the mature form was secreted and retained in the peri-neuronal environment by neuronal surface HS moieties. The proheparanase was co-internalized with neuronal surface HS proteoglycans into lysosomes and only the internalized form showed HS-cleaving activity, indicating intracellular activation of the internalized proheparanase.

50|$|The <b>Schaffer</b> <b>collateral</b> {{is located}} between the CA3 region and CA1 {{region in the}} hippocampus. <b>Schaffer</b> <b>collaterals</b> are the axons of {{pyramidal}} cells that connect two neurons (CA3 and CA1) and transfer information from CA3 to CA1. The entorhinal cortex sends the main input to the dentate gyrus (perforant pathway). From the granule cells of the dentate gyrus, connections are made to the CA3 regions of the hippocampus via mossy fibers. CA3 sends the information signals to CA1 pyramidal cells via the <b>Schaffer</b> <b>collateral</b> and commissural fibers from the contralateral hippocampus as well.|$|R
40|$|SummaryExpression of VP 16 -CREB, a constitutively active form of CREB, in hippocampal neurons of the CA 1 region {{lowers the}} {{threshold}} for eliciting the late, persistent phase of long-term potentiation (L-LTP) in the <b>Schaffer</b> <b>collateral</b> <b>pathway.</b> This VP 16 -CREB-mediated L-LTP {{differs from the}} conventional late phase of LTP in not being dependent on new transcription. This finding suggests that in the transgenic mice the mRNA transcript(s) encoding the protein(s) necessary for this form of L-LTP might already be present in CA 1 neurons in the basal condition. We used high-density oligonucleotide arrays to identify the mRNAs differentially expressed in the hippocampus of transgenic and wild-type mice. We then explored {{the contribution of the}} most prominent candidate genes revealed by our screening, namely prodynorphin, BDNF, and MHC class I molecules, to the facilitated LTP of VP 16 -CREB mice. We found that the overexpression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor accounts for an important component of this phenotype...|$|E
40|$|SummaryMedial {{temporal}} lobe structures {{are responsible for}} recording the continuous stream of autobiographical memories that define our unique personal history. Remarkably, these areas can construct durable memories from brief exposures to the constantly changing activity patterns arriving from antecedent cortical areas. Using a computer model of the hippocampal <b>Schaffer</b> <b>collateral</b> <b>pathway</b> that incorporates evidence for dendritic spikes in CA 1 pyramidal neurons, we searched for biologically-plausible long-term potentiation (LTP) and homeostatic depression (HD) rules that maximize “online” learning capacity. We found memory utilization is most efficient when (1) very few synapses are modified to store each pattern, (2) LTP, the learning operation, is dendrite-specific and gated by distinct pre- and postsynaptic thresholds, (3) HD, the forgetting operation, co-occurs with LTP and targets least-recently potentiated synapses, and (4) both LTP and HD are all-or-none, leading de facto to binary-valued synaptic weights. In networks containing up to 40 million synapses, the learning scheme led to order-of-magnitude capacity increases compared to conventional plasticity rules...|$|E
40|$|Regulated {{expression}} of a constitutively active form of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), VP 16 -CREB, lowers the threshold for the late phase of long-term potentiation in the <b>Schaffer</b> <b>collateral</b> <b>pathway</b> in a de novo gene expression-independent manner, and increases the excitability and reduces afterhyperpolarization of neurons at the amygdala and the hippocampus. We explore the consequences of these changes on the consolidation of fear conditioning and find that the {{expression of}} VP 16 -CREB can bypass the requirement for de novo gene expression associated with long- term memory formation, suggesting that CREB-dependent gene expression is sufficient for fear memory consolidation. © 2009 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.

40|$|We have {{analytically}} and numerically {{solved the}} mutual information expression for a quantitative {{model of the}} <b>Schaffer</b> <b>collateral</b> projections from the CA 3 to the CA 1 pyramidal cells within the hippocampus. Here we discuss in particular results from the model {{on the effect of}} analogue coding levels in the <b>Schaffer</b> <b>collaterals,</b> and the fact that this depends upon the sparseness of firing rate distributions in the hippocampus. 1 Introduction Recent advances in techniques for the formal analysis of neural networks [1, 2, 3, 4] have introduced the possibility of detailed quantitative analyses of real brain circuitry. This approach is particularly appropriate for regions such as the hippocampus, which show distinct structure and for which the microanatomy is relatively simple and well known [5]. The <b>Schaffer</b> <b>collateral</b> model describes, in a simplified form, the connections from the N CA 3 pyramidal cells to the M CA 1 pyramidal cells.

50|$|The <b>Schaffer</b> <b>collateral</b> is {{involved}} in activity-dependent plasticity and the information processes that always are processed through the hippocampus all the time. The <b>Schaffer</b> <b>collateral</b> clearly affects whether the target cells fire action potentials or not. However, at the same time, it is triggering the process that takes much longer whereby some synapses get stronger and some get weaker, and overall the patterns of synaptic strength of the network all evolve over time.|$|R
