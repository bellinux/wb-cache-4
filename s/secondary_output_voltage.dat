The filament power supplies for the above t&odes uses simplified 3 phase SCR control circuits to slowly ramp up the output voltage. Failure of SCR’s during ramping and also during power bumps {{has been a source}} of rf downtime. A new SCR control scheme has been developed and tested which relies on the fact that the <b>secondary</b> <b>output</b> <b>voltage</b> from a 3 phase transformer will be 57. 7 % of it’s rated output voltage if only two phases of Lhe primary are connected.

40|$|The scalar and vector {{potentials}} {{were introduced}} into electromagnetic physics {{in the second}} half of the nineteenth century. The chief aim was to use them as auxiliary mathematical quantities in order to solve certain practical problems. Nevertheless the discovery of the Aharonov-Bohm effect (1959) in quantum mechanics has suggested that vector potential rather than magnetic field is the causal agent in such an effect. Recent research on the Maxwell-Lodge paradox [...] induction of voltage in the loop circling a long solenoid carrying alternating current [...] has confirmed that induction occurs in a region of space effectively free from magnetic field. This again reinforces the idea of vector potential as a physical entity rather than the auxiliary artificial quantity of classical electrodynamics. The present investigation is intended to provide some degree of corroboration of the previous result.

40|$|Space, {{the unknown}} place where {{satellites}} operate on our behalf. In space, {{the only known}} renewable energy comes from the sun, where the energy is captured by solar cells that supply all electronics on-board the satellite via rechargeable batteries. With an environment surrounded by vacuum and radiation, electronics need to be protected and constructed to manage the harsh conditions. Today, a DC/DC converter unit is available at RUAG Space to supply electronics with different voltages and power requirements. It consists of a galvanically isolated flyback topology with a feedback path and is currently operational in space, but there exists potential for improvements of the feedback path and therefore this thesis has been created. The current feedback (the IC-unit UC 1901) use amplitude modulation to transfer a voltage error back to a PWM-circuit that adjust the pulse width and thereby regulate the <b>secondary</b> <b>output</b> <b>voltages.</b> A {{state of the art}} technology study was performed to investigate other potential feedback solutions on the market. It concluded in some radiation qualified digital solutions, but these were rejected due to high costs. A few commercial products were found too, which might have potential in future development. No directly new concept guaranteed a radiation tolerance alternative except in one case, where the costs were too high, so a decision of improving the original feedback was made. Three new alternative solutions were evaluated in the form of simulations with a base of synchronization: a load design, an improved UC 1901 design and a delta sigma design, where the two first alternatives were planned to be constructed on a PCB. But due to high manufacturing cost of the PCB, consequence led to that only the load alternative was constructed on a stripboard. The load feedback uses a three winding transformer, where one winding is pulsed with a square carrier signal. The secondary side act as a load which includes the voltage error in the carrier and couple the signal to the PWM-circuit via the other primary winding. Implementation of the load feedback to the original converter was made and resulted in a stable operation as in the original feedback. Due to some issues with the optimization of the load feedback, the thesis resulted in an operational load feedback with limited performance. A major advantage with the new load feedback compared to the original is the use of simple radiation hardened components. In addition, an alternative symmetric load variant was simulated and showed promising result for further development. Future work would be a closer analysis and optimization of the load alternatives after a PCB implementation, but also evaluation and testing of the other alternatives...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} electrical {{design and}} operational {{characteristics of a}} zero-voltage-switching 20 kHz polyphase bridge, boost converter/modulator for klystron pulse application. The DC-DC converter derives the buss voltages from a standard 13. 8 kV to 2300 Y substation cast-core transformer. Energy storage and filtering is provided by self-clearing metallized hazy polypropylene traction capacitors. Three "H-Bridge" IGBT switching networks are used to generate the polyphase 20 kHz transformers primary drive waveforms. The 20 kHz drive waveforms are chirped the appropriate duration to generate the desired klystron pulse width. PWM (pulse width modulation) of the individual 20 kHz pulses is utilized to provide regulated output waveforms with adaptive feedforward and feedback techniques. The boost transformer design utilizes amorphous nanocrystalline material that provides the required low core loss at design flux levels and switching frequencies. Resonant shunt peaking is used on the transformer <b>secondary</b> to boost <b>output</b> <b>voltage</b> and resonate transformer leakage inductance.

40|$|Part I: Novel soft-switching {{converters}} {{combine the}} functions of loss-less soft-switching for all switches and <b>secondary</b> side <b>output</b> <b>voltage</b> regulation at constant switching frequency. This {{was made possible by}} using magnetic amplifiers in series with the rectifier diodes in the symmetrical topologies. The primary side switches are driven at constant frequency and near 50 % duty ratio with small dead-time and the <b>output</b> <b>voltage</b> is regulated by pulse width modulation (PWM) control on the secondary side. All three soft-switching topologies, half-bridge, full-bridge and push-pull, are analyzed. It was found that the multiple-output extension of these converter do not have some serious adverse effects inherent to their parent PWM converters with magnetic amplifier post-regulators. Experimental results obtained on two different prototypes confirm the key advantages of the proposed soft-switching converters. Part II: Two classes of automatic current shapers are analyzed, with external and internal capacitive energy storage. The Cuk converter with Integrated Magnetics when operated in DICM with external energy storage exhibits advantages over other automatic current shaper topologies. Unity power factor is provided automatically and by using "ripple steering" mechanism essentially zero input and output current ripples are obtained for all operating conditions. Consequently, the size of the magnetics can be significantly reduced even at very modest switching frequencies. The requirement for fast output regulation implies that low-frequency energy is stored internally in the input current shaper. A new AC-to-DC converter which combines {{the functions of}} automatic current shaping, fast <b>output</b> <b>voltage</b> regulation, and loss-less soft-switching in a single converter is proposed. This was made possible through internal energy storage and discovery of the new modes of operation, which together, effectively decoupled the input boost-like part of the Cuk converter from its buck-like output. In order to keep the voltage stress on the switches low, the variable frequency control is required in addition to PWM control. Another novel class of single stage AC-to-DC converters with unity power factor and fast output regulation is also proposed. These converters use a magnetic amplifier for the input current shaping, while the active switch is used for fast output regulation. By using core material for magnetic amplifiers with high saturated permeability, and operating the input stage of the converter in DICM, the linear input inductance can be replaced by the saturated inductance of the magnetic amplifier. Thus, the magnetic amplifier combines the functions of a controllable switch and a linear inductor into a single device. The proposed method of current shaping with magnetic amplifiers is extended to the full-bridge topologies with their input, boost-like stage operated in continuous conduction mode. Experimental results obtained on different prototypes confirm advantages of the proposed topologies...|$|R
