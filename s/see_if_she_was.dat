25|$|Jacobin {{leaders had}} her body autopsied {{immediately}} {{after her death}} to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> a virgin. They believed {{there was a man}} sharing her bed and the assassination plans. To their dismay, she was found to be virgo intacta (a virgin).|$|E
25|$|In 1968, she was {{contacted}} by Learjet to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> {{interested in getting}} a type rating {{in one of their}} jets with the intent to set record flights for them. She earned the rating and even flew some charters (having by that time acquired a commercial pilot certificate in single and multiengine land airplanes), but did not fly any record flights in their jets.|$|E

60|$|Torfrida {{looked at}} her {{mistress}} to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> mad. But the Countess-Queen was serene and sane. Then Torfrida's southern heat and northern courage burst forth.|$|R
6000|$|As soon as {{she could}} speak, she said, [...] "We will go to Lucy, Tom; we'll go and <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> safe, {{and then we can}} help the rest." ...|$|R
25|$|By February 19, {{not having}} {{heard from her}} {{daughter}} herself, Nelson asked her parents, who lived near Ashburn, to drive by and <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> there. Bethany's Hyundai was still out front, but it was parked at an unusual angle, with one tire flat, and noticeably dusty. This was not the condition {{it had been in}} one week earlier, when the grandparents had last driven by. No one answered when they knocked on the door.|$|E
25|$|On 13 November 2001, Charlotte {{visited her}} family where they watched a film together. Her father later stated {{that she had}} been in great spirits, because of her new flat in Holloway, north London, which she had decorated, and there was a {{possibility}} of a career upturn after a few years of a career stall. Later that evening, she complained of feeling unwell, but went home to her flat against her parents' advice. The next morning, Wednesday, 14 November 2001, her parents telephoned her to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> feeling better; but there was no reply. Concerned, her mother went to Charlotte's flat, to find her lying unconscious on the floor; her asthma inhaler was in a different room. She was taken by ambulance to Whittington Hospital in north London, where she was pronounced dead on arrival, from a massive attack of bronchial asthma.|$|E
500|$|Koch and Eide {{claimed that}} Cho had been {{involved}} in at least three stalking incidents, two of which resulted in verbal warnings by the Virginia Tech campus police. The first such alleged stalking incident occurred on November 27, 2005. After the incident, according to Koch, Cho claimed to have sent an instant message online to the female student by AOL Instant Messenger (AIM) and found out where she lived on the campus. Eide stated that Cho then visited her room to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> [...] "cool", adding that Cho remarked that he only found [...] "promiscuity in her eyes". Eide added that, when Cho visited the female student, Cho said, [...] "Hi, I'm Question Mark" [...] to her, [...] "which really freaked her out." [...] The female student called the campus police, complaining that Cho had sent her annoying messages and made an unannounced visit to her room. Two uniformed members of the campus police visited Cho's room at the dormitory later that evening and warned him not to contact the female student again. Cho made no further contact with the student.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{waiting for}} my friend Lady Carey," [...] Lucille answered. [...] "I {{understood}} that she had come down. Perhaps you will send and <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> in the reading-room." ...|$|R
60|$|You {{glance at}} her face to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> in earnest, for you can {{remember}} three breakfasts, four luncheons, two dinners, and sandwiches between; but evidently <b>she</b> <b>is</b> not jesting. Then you yield.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why {{do you do}} that?" [...] {{the girl}} asked, quickly, looking round to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> pursued. [...] "Oh, I see," [...] she said, as her eyes fell on the figure at the window.|$|R
500|$|She was {{captured}} on 17 March 1918 when Nikolaev {{was occupied by}} the Germans and Austrians, but they did nothing with her incomplete hull. On 25 January 1919 she was listed by the Directorate of Ukraine as planned to be completed and included into the navy list by 1920. On 27 January 1919 she was mentioned at Directorate Navy Ministry order at the list for renaming from 1920 [...] â€“ into Soborna Ukraina (: Union of Ukraine). However none of the short-lived Directorate orders were actually implemented. She remained at Nikolayev throughout the Russian Civil War, of no use to either side. The victorious Soviets finally inspected her in 1923 to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> worth completing. Her dilapidated state and obsolescent design caused them to conclude {{that it was not}} worth doing and she should be sold for scrap. Efforts were made to sell the hull abroad to raise hard currency, but when these came to nought she was towed to Sevastopol on 28 June 1927 to begin dismantling.|$|E
2500|$|Jobs only {{contacted}} Schieble after Clara {{died and}} after he received permission from his father, Paul. In addition, {{out of respect for}} Paul, he asked the media not to report on his search. Jobs stated that he was motivated to find his birth mother out of both curiosity and a need [...] "to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> okay and to thank her, because I'm glad I didn't end up as an abortion. She was twenty-three and she went through a lot to have me." [...] Schieble was emotional during their first meeting (though she wasn't familiar with the history of Apple or Jobs's role in it) and told him that she had been pressured into signing the adoption papers. She said that she regretted giving him up and repeatedly apologized to him for it. Jobs and Schieble would develop a friendly relationship throughout {{the rest of his life}} and would spend Christmas together. When Jobs died in 2011, Schieble was suffering from dementia and living in a nursing home. She was not told about his death.|$|E
60|$|Betsy-Jane said Fanny {{had gone}} into No. 3 staircase, on which Mrs. Bolton said she was {{probably}} in Strong's rooms, and bade the child go and <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> there.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, sir, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> closely masked. I {{could not}} even <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> young or old; and she spoke in the same disguised, {{squeaking}} sort of voice that all the others that had spoken to me used." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sure," [...] replied Byrne shortly; [...] "but we can't {{waste any}} time chinnin'. I heard that Miss Barbara was goin' to be swiped last night--I heard that <b>she</b> had <b>been.</b> Now hurry and <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> here." ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{looked at}} Jill to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> in earnest. When I saw that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> I said, [...] "I wouldn't {{take all the}} gems of Golconda and go and tell Dick that I'd been hoaxing him. You can do it yourself, Jill Gordon." ...|$|R
60|$|Another {{person was}} {{advancing}} from the hotel; an interruption, a trivial domestic interruption, presented itself. The nursemaid {{had missed the}} child, and {{had come into the}} garden to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> with her mother.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, darling, {{how long}} you have been asleep!" [...] said a voice close by; and {{starting}} up Nelly saw her mother stooping over her, while Baby was creeping nearer to laugh and crow as he peeped into her face to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> awake.|$|E
6000|$|The Swain (ignoring {{the reply}} and his {{previous}} attitude and becoming more direct). [...] "I was calkilatin' {{to say that}} with these yer hoss-thieves about, yer filly ain't safe in the pasture. I took a turn round there {{two or three times}} last evening to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> all right." ...|$|E
50|$|He then {{explains}} {{that was his}} story, as apparently he has been singing this song to a woman whom {{he is trying to}} seduce, and how he wants to look in her eyes to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> the reincarnation of the angel he found.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Just so. I'm {{afraid it}} is. Only, {{just let me}} <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> all right. Ay!' and then, after a gaze, a fond touch or two, an irrepressible sigh strangled in the midst, 'lock her up again! You ain't by any chance going home to-morrow?' ...|$|R
50|$|Akari: In the anime series, <b>she</b> <b>is</b> {{hardly an}} athlete who {{believes}} <b>she</b> shouldn't <b>be</b> an athlete {{like her mother}} Tomoe Midou and believes she should quit. In the manga, she wanted to improve herself to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> worthy of being a true athlete like her mom.|$|R
60|$|So {{a servant}} was {{dispatched}} {{to summon the}} Wicked Witch, who lived but a few leagues from King Krewl's castle. While they awaited her, the withered old courtier proposed that they {{pay a visit to}} Princess Gloria and <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> not now in a more complaisant mood. So the two started away together and searched the castle over without finding Gloria.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{have had}} very {{beautiful}} weather lately, Sir," [...] said Mrs. Sherwin, almost inaudibly; looking as she spoke, with anxious eyes towards her husband, to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> justified in uttering even those piteously common-place words. [...] "Very beautiful weather to be sure," [...] continued the poor woman, as timidly {{as if she}} had become a little child again, and had been ordered to say her first lesson in a stranger's presence.|$|E
60|$|Out in the street, {{climbing}} into his car, {{he looked up}} involuntarily to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> still there, but she had gone. As the car, gathering speed, hummed down the street. Sally was at the telephone listening to the sleepy voice of Ginger Kemp, which, as he became aware who it was that had woken him from his rest and {{what she had to}} say to him, magically lost its sleepiness and took on a note of riotous ecstasy.|$|E
6000|$|Clara {{had stood}} {{all the time}} like a statue on the stairs, waiting to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> wanted, and gazing intently, with her fingers clasped. When both <b>were</b> gone <b>she</b> drew a long breath, and nodded with her head, {{whispering}} to herself, in a grave and critical voice--'That is love!' ...|$|R
60|$|After breakfast, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> {{sent out}} with Mrs. Lacy for a walk. <b>If</b> <b>she</b> had {{a letter from}} home, she read it while Josephine dressed her as <b>if</b> <b>she</b> had <b>been</b> a doll; or else she had a story book in hand, and was usually lost in it when Mrs. Lacy looked into her room to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> ready.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Dolores, [...] "but {{that is all}} {{the more}} reason I want to go. There is a girl with them in whom we are very much interested. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> kidnapped from Rockquay at the time this circus was there. At least I am almost sure it is the same, and I must <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'On Monday afternoon, 15th, Mr. Codrington {{went for}} {{a ride to the}} other side of the island, and there espied the schooner, eight miles off. He rode home quickly, and soon the {{shouting}} and racing of the boys told us that the vessel had come. They were all at arrowroot- making. Never, I think, had the whole party, English and natives, seemed in higher spirits. Mr. Bice walked to the settlement, to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> far in enough to land that night; we asked him to call and tell us on his way home.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{she is a}} sweet child," [...] {{said the}} blue-bird, hopping to the wall to look along the lane to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> coming. [...] "She never throws pebbles in the water to disturb the minnows, nor breaks the ferns only to let them die, nor {{troubles}} us as we work and play as most children do. She leans there and watches us as if she loved us, and sings to herself {{as if she were}} half a bird. I like her, and I hope she {{will be the first to}} find the spring." ...|$|E
6000|$|The little servant {{had been}} enjoined to wear her Sunday clothes {{in case a}} visitor should come, and after a hasty glance to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> tidy, Miss Simcoe sat down in her little parlor, and tried to assume an {{appearance}} of calmness. The front door opened, and a man's voice inquired, [...] "Is Miss Simcoe in?" [...] Then the parlor door opened and the visitor entered, pushing past the girl, who had been instructed how to announce him in proper form, and exclaiming, [...] "My dear Aunt Martha," [...] fairly lifted the astonished old lady from her seat and kissed her.|$|E
60|$|Now Dickory Charter swore in his heart, {{although}} he was not accustomed to any sort of blasphemy; and as Miss Kate gazed eagerly through the open window, our young friend narrowly scrutinized her face to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> glad or not. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> glad, that was plain enough, and he went out sullenly to receive the arriving interloper.|$|R
60|$|Old Granny Fox asked Reddy how {{he would}} like to eat a dinner of Bowser the Hound's, Reddy looked at her sharply to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> joking or really meant what she said. Granny looked so sober and so much in earnest that Reddy decided <b>she</b> couldn't <b>be</b> joking, even though it did sound that way.|$|R
50|$|The {{bacteria}} quickly {{evolves into}} a hostile life-form capable of mimicking {{the form of}} its human victims, the now visible bacteria attacks and kills Dorothy while checking to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> infected. To make matters worse, the computer controls have been overrun by an unknown being, which results {{in the deaths of}} Dular and Walt.|$|R
