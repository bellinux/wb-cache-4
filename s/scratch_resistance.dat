50|$|Sunglass lenses {{are made}} of either glass, plastic, or SR-91. Plastic lenses are {{typically}} made from acrylic, polycarbonate, CR-39 or polyurethane.

Plastic lenses are lighter and shatter-resistant, but {{are more prone to}} scratching. Polycarbonate plastic lenses are the lightest, and are also almost shatterproof, making them good for impact protection.

SR-91 is a proprietary material that was introduced by Kaenon Polarized in 2001. Kaenon's lens formulation was the first non-polycarbonate material to pass the high-mass impact ANSI Z.87.1 testing.

40|$|Polycarbonate (PC) {{possesses}} many commercial applications. However, PC {{is still}} limited to non-abrasive and chemical-free environments {{due to its}} low hardness, low <b>scratching</b> <b>resistance</b> and high susceptibility to chemical attacks. To overcome this limitation, PC can be coated by hydrogenated amorphous carbon layers. The a-C:H layers have very attractive properties such as high hardness, infrared transparency, chemical inertness, low friction coefficients, and biocompatibility. Addition of nitrogen in the structure allows lowering internal stress and improve tribological properties of a-C:H layers. In this work, a-C:N:H layers were deposited from mixture CH 4 /N 2 gases by RF PECVD method. Effects of the nitrogen incorporation on structure and tribological properties of deposited layers were investigated. The structure of layers were characterized by Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The friction coefficient, wear resistance of a-C:H:N layers were estimated by tribometer in ball-on-disc configuration. The IR spectra of the obtained layers have demonstrated a presence of nitrogen bonded both to carbon and to hydrogen. A formation of the following bonds has been confirmed: -C≡N, -NH 2, -C−NH 2, >C=NH. They are all typical for a-C:N:H layers.

40|$|A {{microstructural}} characterization {{approach has}} been developed to study the mechanisms of near-surface deformation under surface scratches in injection-molded polypropylene blends with over 20 % rubber modifier (thermoplastic polyolefin or TPO). The near-surface microstructure of the material before and after scratching was characterized with different techniques such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), optical microscopy and X-ray diffraction. It was observed that the TPO material plastically deformed by forming shear band structure under surface scratches. Materials inside shear band dilated {{and the extent of}} dilation could be measured from the characteristic angles between the shearband boundary and rubber particles. At a higher applied normal load (> 200 g for the test in this study), evidence for surface fracture was observed. At even higher loads (> 400 g), significant amounts of sub-surface voiding were observed, due to the delamination between the rubber phases and the polypropylene matrix. The observation of both the dilation of materials inside shearbands and the subsurface voiding at high normal loads advanced the understanding of scratching whitening mechanism in this kind of important materials. It was observed that the talc additives had no obvious influence on shear band nucleation and propagation. Results obtained in this study suggest that a strong interfacial adhesion between rubber phase and PP matrix is crucial to improving the <b>scratching</b> <b>resistance</b> of rubber modified polypropylene blends...|$|R

40|$|Due to {{the lateral}} size {{reduction}} of stored bits {{on a hard}} disk, the head-to-med ia spacing has to be reduced {{as well as the}} thickness of the protecting carbon overcoats. In order to obtain a thickness in the 2 nm region a new process technology is needed. In the present paper, a high current pulsed arc (HCA) technique is presented as an innovative source for ultra thin carbon coating for industrial disk production. The hardness and <b>scratching</b> <b>resistance</b> of these films are remarkably higher than conventional magnetron sputtered films. With the HCA-Source we are able to produce pinhole-free carbon films with thicknesses down to 1. 7 nm. The thickness profile and uniformity on disk is adjustable by a magnetic field array. The deposition rate is 0. 070. 3 nm per pulse, therefore the coating time is below 2 s per disk. The magnetic layer is left undamaged during the HCA depo sition process. These aspects are very important for industrial disk production efficiency. Strong particle reduction due to a magnetic filter tube is confirmed by repeatable glide tests. Particles are confined in the magnetic filter tube and do not reach the substrate. In several important tests, we showed that the HC A source is capable of producing carbon layers within a realistic disk production environment with a yield of approximately 93 % which proved to be comparable to current magnetron sputtered overcoats...|$|R

Beside surface technology, this expert meeting presents the practical application of nanotechnology at plastics components and semifinished products. The first lecture describes the possibilities of nanotechnology with respect to examples such as the influence of reinforced materials in polymer matrices on tire performance. The development of products with increased request for barriere is illustrated by means of modified layered silicates in high density polyethylene. Nanocomposites minimize the present diffusion positions. In the automotive application polypropylene nanocomposites maximize the reinforcing effect, improve the dimensional stability and minimize the incremental cost of the nanofiller on the final formulation. In the packaging application nanoparticles increase the path lengths through the polypropylene and slow down the permeation of gases. Alumina nanoparticles in epoxy resin improve the stiffness, strength and impact energy of epoxy resins at low filler contents. The tribological behaviour of PEEK composites is influenced by graphite, Teflon, aramide and carbon fibre. Nanoparticle modified arylcoatings have many advantages such as increased <b>scratched</b> <b>resistance,</b> abrasion strength, tenacity and rigidity. Multi-wall and single wall carbon nanotubes are described {{with respect to their}} properties, synthesis, reaction behaviour and sidewall functionalization. Beside the in-situ method and solvent method, nanocomposites are produced by extruding a mixture of a polymer and a layered silicate. The 2 -component-polyurethane lacquer consisting of polyalcohole and a hyperbranched polyisocyanate is a new generation of lacquers with a high <b>scratch</b> resistancy, chemical <b>resistance,</b> high gloss and a high mechanical resistance. In the area of optical data storage, the historical development of nanotechnology from the simple compact discs for music till to nanostructured tera storage is described. Anorganic/organic hybrid polymers are used in dental restauration and prophylaxis. Further applications are glas ionomer concrete, hollow fibres for membrane and sensor applications, anorganic nanoporous hollow fibres and foils and flat membranes, all of them on the basis of ORMOCER technology. The nanotechnology is the bridge between materials and biosystems with a lot of possibilities for design of materials and active ingredients and for design processes for complex systems.
