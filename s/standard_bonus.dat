5000|$|A revised {{magic item}} upgrade system is included, which {{separates}} miscellaneous powers (such as continuous and charge or per-day spell effects) from <b>standard</b> <b>bonuses.</b> These bonuses are now quickly added to any appropriate item without the [...] "additional powers" [...] multiplier. This {{has a number}} of benefits: first of all, players typically get magic items at a rather low level and then upgrade them with ability bonuses. Any item looted during later levels, even one that is highly desirable, is often discarded because it would be too expensive to reproduce the level-appropriate bonuses on their existing item. Second, it allows players to invest in interesting non-bonus items without losing the bonuses that CR-appropriate encounters assume the players have. Thirdly, it allows the magic items listed to have more variety and be available at lower levels; dungeon masters can apply upgrade costs quickly to allow an item to appear in higher-level treasure hoards.|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe surface warfare community has recently increased bonus amounts {{in an attempt}} to reward quality performance and retain superior officers. Simultaneously, the community has started to offer alternative programs and incentives that might appeal to those officers who desire a flexible career. We used survey information to determine which of these were the most appealing to the community in a way that might provide cost savings to the military when provided in conjunction with an auction bonus system. Using the <b>standard</b> <b>bonus</b> system compared to the uniform price auction, the Quality Adjusted Discount (QUAD) auction, and Combinatorial Retention Auction Mechanism (CRAM), we determined which would be most effective for maintaining quality officers in the community while meeting retention objectives and providing cost savings. We found that a quality auction system could provide cost savings as much as $ 1, 850, 000 or could increase costs by as much as $ 2, 081, 250, depending on community retention levels, even with increased individual bonus amounts. Additionally, from survey responses we were able to discern additional non-monetary incentives that surface warfare officers desire, which could be used to improve retention of quality officers in the future.

50|$|All Leaders are different, {{and give}} a 25% bonus instead of the <b>standard</b> 10% <b>bonus</b> to certain {{statistics}} depending on their flagship and {{their role in the}} campaign. For example, Admiral Steele enters the campaign at around the same time the Terrans meet and form an alliance with the Celareons. Due to differing factions within the mechanical-energy race there becomes a hostile Celareon faction, and Admiral Steele's career garners him more experience in warfare against Celareons than any other Admiral. As a result, in skirmish or multiplayer games Steele has a special bonus to damage solely against Celareons. Likewise, Warlord Kertak, a Mantis rebel and ally, possesses a fighter carrier flagship; her fleets have special bonuses to carriers' fighters instead of larger ships, improving their agility, targeting, and damage.|$|R
