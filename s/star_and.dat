5|$|A dwarf {{planet is}} a planetary-mass object that {{is neither a}} planet nor a natural satellite.

50|$|In astronomy, the {{circumpolar}} constellations are a {{group of}} constellations of stars that never set below the horizon from the viewer's perspective. Because of {{the rotation of the}} Earth and its axial tilt with respect to the Sun, the <b>stars</b> <b>and</b> constellations can be divided into two groups. Some <b>stars</b> <b>and</b> constellations never rise nor set, and they are called circumpolar. All the rest are divided into seasonal <b>stars</b> <b>and</b> constellations.|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} initial {{results of a}} {{large-scale}} optical-near infrared survey to detect very low mass <b>stars</b> <b>and</b> brown dwarfs in the dispersed populations of the Orion star forming region. Using deep optical photometry, infrared photometry from 2 MASS survey and optical spectra from the Hectospec spectrograph, we con rmed 22 new members, 6 of which are bonna de brown dwarfs. Our ndings indicate that at ages of about 3 Myr the number of accretors in very low mass <b>stars</b> <b>and</b> brown dwarfs {{is similar to that}} derived for low-mass pre-main sequence <b>stars</b> <b>and</b> that the overall number of accretors, both in low-mass <b>stars</b> <b>and</b> among very low mass <b>stars</b> <b>and</b> brown dwarfs, falls o by a signi cant amount at ages - 8 - 10 Myr, supporting the idea of a common formation scenario for VLMS and BD...|$|R

50|$|After the 1983 loss, Dennis Conner found {{sponsors}} {{and built a}} syndicate to challenge for the America's Cup.

In addition, they commissioned the building of three new boats: <b>Stars</b> <b>and</b> Stripes 85 (US 54), <b>Stars</b> <b>and</b> Stripes 86 (US 56) <b>and</b> <b>Stars</b> <b>and</b> Stripes 87 (US 55).
