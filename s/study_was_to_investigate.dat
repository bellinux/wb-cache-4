50|$|In 2010 Scurr, White and Hedger {{conducted}} {{a study on the}} effect of breast support on the movement of the breast during the running gait cycle. The aim of this <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>investigate</b> the multi-directional breast displacement, velocity and acceleration with and without breast support during running and also to establish the correlation with breast comfort. 15 D cup participants were used and all regularly participated in exercise. Using treadmill running in three different bra conditions, (No bra, T-shirt bra and sports bra) they concluded that breast displacement and velocity were reduced as breast support increased and that no particular direction of breast movement showed a stronger relationship to breast pain. Further to this they found that breast discomfort was most closely correlated to breast velocity.|$|E

Upon discovery of the study, the study ended {{at the turn of the}} millennia and met extensive criticism for issues regarding the target population, a significant portion of which were African American children, and patient ethics such as consent regarding children and health risks when exposing subjects to cheaper but less effective health conditions. The backlash culminated in class action lawsuits against KKI by Ericka Grimes and Myron Higgins, two of the subjects representing on the order of a hundred affected children without adequate care.|$|E
