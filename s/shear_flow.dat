25|$|Acetaldehyde is a colorless, {{volatile}} substance with a fruity smell. Although it forms naturally in some fruit, {{it can cause}} an off-taste in bottled water. Acetaldehyde forms by degradation of PET through the mishandling of the material. High temperatures (PET decomposes above 300°C or 570°F), high pressures, extruder speeds (excessive <b>shear</b> <b>flow</b> raises temperature), and long barrel residence times all contribute {{to the production of}} acetaldehyde. When acetaldehyde is produced, some of it remains dissolved in the walls of a container and then diffuses into the product stored inside, altering the taste and aroma. This is not such a problem for non-consumables (such as shampoo), for fruit juices (which already contain acetaldehyde), or for strong-tasting drinks like soft drinks. For bottled water, however, low acetaldehyde content is quite important, because, if nothing masks the aroma, even extremely low concentrations (10–20 parts per billion in the water) of acetaldehyde can produce an off-taste.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>Shear</b> <b>flows</b> {{have been}} {{prescribed}} in numerical models of coronal mass ejections and flares for {{decades as a}} way of energizing magnetic fields to erupt.

This paper will discuss the discovery that such <b>shear</b> <b>flows</b> are readily explained {{as a response to the}} Lorentz force that naturally occurs as bipolar magnetic fields emerge and expand in a gravitationally stratified atmosphere. It will be shown that shearing motions transport axial flux, and magnetic energy from the submerged portion of the field to the expanding portion, strongly coupling the solar interior to the corona. This physical process explains active region <b>shear</b> <b>flows</b> and why the magnetic field is found to be nearly parallel to photospheric polarity inversion lines where prominences form. Finally, <b>shear</b> <b>flows</b> driven by the Lorentz force are shown to produce a loss of equilibrium and eruption in magnetic arcades and flux ropes offering a convincing explanation for CMEs and flares. 1...|$|R

The first few such <b>shear</b> <b>flows</b> resemble the gross features of the zonal winds in the atmosphere of the earth at different times and altitudes. The spatial structures of the neutral normal modes in these <b>shear</b> <b>flows</b> are spherical harmonics, and, as a consequence, these modes are also the exact solutions of the fully nonlinear equation because the nonlinear interaction term vanishes identically.
