40|$|ABSTRACT. Measurement {{of water}} flow in furrows from either {{irrigation}} or rainfall is difficult when significant soil erosion occurs. It {{can be accomplished}} with flumes that back up flow in the furrow, which for moderate to steeply sloping fields causes only small changes in furrow water depth and thus has little influence on the water flow measurement. However, the ponding of water upstream from a flume can {{have a significant impact}} on the movement of sediment down the furrow. In one research study, measured sediment transport through the flume was reduced 40 % over that measured in a furrow with only a non – constricting metal form that matched the furrow shape. A new furrow flume has been designed that overcomes the limitations of current v – shaped flumes or trapezoidal EEC flumes that cause significant backwater during furrow irrigation. This new flume has a trapezoidal shape with only a <b>side</b> <b>contraction.</b> It was designed to keep flow velocities high over the full range of flow conditions. This new flume is commercially available and has been working successfully in the field for three seasons...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Pivot weirs (sharp crested {{inclined}} weirs, Fig. 1 -a) {{is frequently}} used for discharge measurement, controlling water surface and flow diversion. Some typical features of pivot weirs are: (a) overshot design for better water level control, (b) Their application as head gates, turnout or check structure which requiring low head loss and high accuracy, (c) ease of removing sediment deposit behind the weir, and (d) {{ability to manage}} and monitor on-site or operating remotely when connected to a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) network. Kindsvater and Carter (8) derived a weir discharge equation based on energy and continuity equations. Hulsing (4) determined head-discharge relationship of inclined suppressed sharp crested weir with the slope of 3 : 3, 2 : 3 and 1 : 3 toward downstream and compared them with the equivalent normal sharp crested weir. In the USBR report on pivot weirs (regarding The Boulder Canyon Project, 1948) the head discharge data of the suppressed pivot weir were presented in a channel with 5. 5 m length, 2. 9 m depth and 0. 61 m width. Some field experiments were also {{carried out in the}} IID (Imperial Irrigation District) on a trapezoidal cross-section (0. 61 m bottom width) channel with pivot weir of 1. 7 m length, and two different widths of 1. 63 m. The flow rate (350 - 880 lit/s) was held constant and different angles (15 - 50 °) calibrated instead of holding the angle constant and varying the flow rate. Some other laboratory tests were performed with Wahlin and Replogle (1994) on two pivot weirs with 1. 2 m and 1. 14 m width for the 0. 61 m and 0. 46 m length of blade and contraction factor of 0. 925. RUBICON Company established an extensive operation on the application and automation of pivot weirs in irrigation channels in Australia (Www. rubicon. com). All previous studies concentrated on modifying the normal rectangular weir head-discharge equation {{so that it can be}} used for the pivot weirs. In this study, it is trying to derive a unique head-discharge equation for pivot weirs based on dimension analysis and critical discharge equation (implementing Ferro rule). This equation can be used for different inclined angles and side contractions. The obtained unique and simple discharge equation can be used in automation of this structure. Material and Method: In this research, experimental data consist of experiments carried out in hydraulic research institute of Tehran, Iran and experiments of USBR on Pivot weir with <b>side</b> <b>contraction</b> in 0. 925 in the canal with 1. 14 m width and 0. 46 m blade length (Wahlin and Replogle, 1994). Experiments of the water institute of Tehran were carried out in the concrete rectangular weir with 10. 30 m long, 1 m wide and 1 m depth (Fig. 2). Experimental model was consisted of canals, water supply system, dampers (avoided of turbulent flow upstream of pivot weir), pivot weirs, sluice gate at the end of the channel (make different tail waters). With respect to laboratory equipment’s, three pivot weirs with of 80 × 65, 60 × 55 and 40 × 40 (cm×cm) respectively length of the blade and the width was built and set 5. 5 m far from the first of the canal. Discharge was determined from the calibrated weir located at the upstream of pivot weir. A manual point gauge with ± 0. 01 mm sensitivity was used to measure water surface levels. Extraction of discharge equation: Dimensional Analysis based on Ferro rule (2000 and 2001) is used to determine the discharge formula of pivot weirs. Since the h-Q function is usually exponential, the relation between dimensionless parameters could be defined as Ferro rule. Results and Discussion: The rating curve of the pivot weirs with different side contractions is compared with the normal suppressed rectangular weir (equal weir height) in Fig. 3. The discharge of normal suppressed rectangular weir was calculated from the discharge equation of Kindsvater-Carter and discharge coefficient of Rehbock (1) for the equal weir height and head of pivot weirs. For a constant water head, the discharge of pivot weir with a <b>side</b> <b>contraction</b> of 0. 925 is more than the normal suppressed weir. When the weir plate is inclined to the bottom of the canal, because of the stagnation area behind the weir plate, the streamlines approach the weir blade smoothly and the energy dissipation is lower than for the normal weirs. The vortex behind the weir plate increases as the inclined angle increases and subsequently the discharge coefficient decreases. Reduction of discharge for a constant water head in contract weirs is simply justified by decreasing of the weir width. The α and β coefficients were obtained based on all experimental data. Discharge equation obtained based on critical depth-discharge equation. Conclusion: In this study, based on dimension analysis a unique head-discharge relation was obtained which could be used for different inclined angels and side contractions. This equation is more appropriate than previous formulas which are modifications to the normal weir head-discharge equation. The accuracy of this equation was evaluated by different data sets including different inclined angle, side contractions, weir heights and also a wide discharge range. This equation could be used in the automated irrigation network easily...|$|E

40|$|SummaryCytokinesis entails cell {{invagination}} by a contractile actomyosin ring. In epithelia, E-cadherin-mediated adhesion {{connects the}} cortices of contacting cells; thus, {{it is unclear}} how invagination occurs, how the new junction forms, and how tissue integrity is preserved. Investigations in Drosophila embryos first show that apicobasal cleavage is polarized: invagination is faster from the basal than from the apical <b>side.</b> Ring <b>contraction</b> but not its polarized constriction is controlled by septin filaments and Anillin. Polarized cleavage is due instead to mechanical anchorage of the ring to E-cadherin complexes. Formation of the new junction requires local adhesion disengagement in the cleavage furrow, followed by new E-cadherin complex formation at the new interface. E-cadherin disengagement depends on the tension exerted by the cytokinetic ring and by neighboring cells. We uncover intrinsic and extrinsic forces necessary for cytokinesis and present a framework for understanding how tissue cohesion is preserved during epithelial division...|$|R

The compressor consists mainly of (1) a compression head that includes hydraulic diaphragms, a gas-compression diaphragm, and check valves; and (2) oscillating linear drive that includes a linear motor and a drive spring, through which compression force is applied to the hydraulic diaphragms. The motor is driven at the resonance vibrational frequency of the motor/spring/compression-head system, the compression head acting as a damper that takes energy out of the oscillation. The net effect of the oscillation is to cause cyclic expansion and contraction of the gas-compression diaphragm, and, hence, of the volume bounded by this diaphragm. One-way check valves admit gas into this volume from the low-pressure side during expansion and allow the gas to flow out to the high-pressure <b>side</b> during <b>contraction.</b> Fatigue data and the results of diaphragm stress calculations have been interpreted as signifying that the compressor can be expected to have an operational life of greater than 30 years with a confidence level of 99. 9 percent...|$|R

An experimental study was led to check the good behaviour of the hydraulic structures during high return period floods. The present paper focuses on the gated spillway analyzing the flow behaviour from upstream towards downstream. The gated spillway is oriented at 45 ° from the axis of the valley, creating a non uniform approach flow in the left bay of the gated spillway, with apparition of longitudinal vortex close to the left guide wall. To avoid these bad entry conditions, a vertical inclination of the left side wall reveals efficient to distribute uniformly the flow. Furthermore, this inclination allows increasing the hydraulic capacity for high water levels. This effect can be computed by adjusting the left <b>side</b> wall <b>contraction</b> factor.

The goal of this retrospective, single-institution study was to analyze a case series after nipple reconstruction using a multimodal evaluation including 3 -dimensional (3 D) laser scanner analyses. Unilateral mastectomy patients after either expander-based or autologous breast reconstruction using the skate flap were included. NAC caliper measurement of nipple and areola size was performed. 3 D laser scanner analysis (Minolta Vivid 900) was used to calculate nipple volume, measurement of nipple, and areolar projection and diameter. Sensitivity was evaluated using the Semmes Weinstein test and patient satisfaction by a visual analog scale (VAS 1 - 10). A total of 10 patients were included in the expander group and 12 patients were included in the flap group. After a median follow-up period of 32 months in the expander group and 34 months in the flap group, non-contact 3 D laser surface scanning revealed a difference in projection of 55 to 60 % compared to the contralateral <b>side.</b> The <b>contraction</b> in all 3 dimensions led to a dramatic difference in nipple volume with 12 ± 8 % (flap reconstructions) and 12 ± 7 % (expander reconstructions). Sensitivity of the areola showed better values after expander-based reconstruction. Despite the significant discrepancy in nipple volume and projection as well as areolar diameter, overall patient satisfaction was acceptable (VAS 4. 1 ± 3. 5).

Participants: Seven hemiplegic adults after stroke with passive range of motion in the elbow from 10 ° to 90 ° and Modified Ashworth Scale score larger than 1 were recruited. Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: Ultrasonography {{was used to measure}} brachialis muscle pennation angle and fascicle length at the rest condition and during isometric contractions. Results: The measured pennation angles and fascicle lengths were found to be joint-angle-dependent in both the affected and unaffected groups at the rest condition. Further comparisons found that the pennation angles of the affected brachialis muscle were significantly larger (P 20 °). As the level of isometric voluntary contraction was increased incrementally from 20 % to 100 % of MVC, the results showed that pennation angle increased significantly (P<. 05) while fascicle length decreased significantly (P<. 01) in the unaffected muscle. However, the contraction level has a significant effect only on pennation angle (P<. 05) but not on fascicle length in the affected side. In addition, the measured fascicle lengths in the unaffected group were significantly shorter than those in the affected group for isometric contractions above 40 % MVC. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the architectural parameters of the brachialis muscle in people after stroke are elbow-joint-angle-dependent at the rest condition. In the affected side, pennation angle changed the most when the muscle was in an extension position and fascicle length changed the most in a flexed position when compared with the unaffected side. Immobilization and contracture might cause a shortening of the fascicle and an increase in pennation angle in the affected side. Smaller pennation angle and fascicle length changes in the affected <b>side</b> during isometric <b>contraction</b> might be due to weakness in the muscle after the onset of stroke.

40|$|A {{prospective}} randomized double-blind placebo-controlled {{trial was}} conducted in 13 subjects {{to find out whether}} mifepristone treatment could facilitate termination of second trimester pregnancy by sulprostone. The women received either 600 mg oral mifepristone or placebo tablets 36 hours before the administration of intramuscular sulprostone 0. 5 mg every 6 hours. The median interval between the administration of sulprostone and abortion in the mifepristone group (4. 6 hours) was significantly shorter than that in the placebo group (20 hours). The amount of sulprostone required was also significantly less in the mifepristone group. There {{was no significant difference in}} the incidence of side effects or analgesic requirement between the two groups. We conclude that oral mifepristone is useful in facilitating termination of second trimester pregnancies by sulprostone. | Termination of second trimester pregnancies has been related to side effects. ATtempts have been made to shorten the induction-abortion interval and to lower dosage of the prostaglandins in order to reduce the incidence of side effects. In this study, 13 second trimester patients 18 - 35 years of age were administered mifepristone before the procedure which called for administration of intramuscular sulprostone; the trial was prospective and randomized and called for double-blind placebo controls. The objective was to determine whether administration of mifepristone would facilitate termination of the pregnancy. 6 women received 600 mg oral mifepristone in an unmarked packet 36 hours before the administration of. 5 mg sulprostone intramuscularly every 6 hours until the patient felt strong uterine contractions. 7 women received a placebo in an unmarked packet at the same time as those receiving mifepristone followed by sulprostone. <b>Side</b> effects, uterine <b>contractions,</b> blood pressure, and pulse were recorded every 2 hours. There were no significant differences in mean age of patients or in weight and height. Women were excluded who had any significant past or present medical disorder, who were using prescription drugs regularly, who were nursing or using hormonal contraception during or just before conception, or who were using an intrauterine device. The statistically significant results showed that the induction-abortion interval was shorter and the amount of sulprostone lower in the mifepristone group. 3 patients in the placebo groups did not abort within 24 hours and required administration of oxytocin and further injections of sulprostone. 2 patients (28. 6 %) in the placebo group required uterine evacuation under general anesthesia, and 4 patients (66. 7 %) in the placebo group required uterine evacuation due to incomplete abortions, which was not a statistically significant difference. Temperature highs were similar in both groups, but the amount of vomiting or diarrhea and the analgesic requirement was greater in the placebo group, but not significantly so. There was early termination of the study because of unexpected cardiovascular complications in another study; intravenous injection of sulprostone is recommended. The advantages of mifepristone are that it requires no special skills and avoids the complications of the laminaria tent. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
