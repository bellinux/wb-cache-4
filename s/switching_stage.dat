40|$|Abstract- A large-capacity, multi-plane, {{multi-stage}} buffered packet switch, {{called the}} TrueWay switch [1], was previously proposed by us. It can achieve hundreds of terabits/sec capacity. A small-scale TrueWay switch was prototyped {{to demonstrate the}} concept and feasibility. Three different load balancing schemes were investigated to achieve high throughput and low average delay with a moderate speedup. In this paper, {{we focus on the}} study of one of the load balancing schemes, window-based re-sequencing scheme, without a speedup. It is the most promising one among the three in terms of performance. Buffered switch modules are used in different stages to eliminate the need of centralized scheduling. However, packet out-of-subsequence is inventible as packets are distributed to different paths that have various queuing delays. By applying flow control between the input and output ports and limiting the re-sequencing window size (similar to TCP/IP flow control), we are able to keep the implementation cost to an acceptable level while still providing high throughput. Link-level flow control between the <b>switch</b> <b>stages</b> is required to prevent the downstream queues from being overflowed. The interaction between link flow control at <b>switch</b> <b>stages</b> and end-to-end flow control at switch ports is an interesting problem.
