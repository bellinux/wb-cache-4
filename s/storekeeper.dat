5|$|Gan {{was later}} taken as an {{apprentice}} by Guthrie and Company. He was diligent and capable, and his ability won him the recognition and keen interest of Thomas Scott, one of the partners in the company.

Gan was subsequently promoted to the post of Assistant <b>Storekeeper</b> and then Chief <b>Storekeeper</b> of the company. In 1874, he became the company's Chief Compradore, a position which he held for the next 25 years. Scott later helped to finance some of Gan's early business ventures, one of which was to supply labour and transport to the Tanjong Pagar Dock Company which helped Gan make most of his personal fortunes.|$|E

After leaving Mornington School, {{he worked for the}} regional newspaper, the Otago Daily Times, and for the Otago Witness. He was a typesetter when he married Ada Taylor in 1912 but the following year took up farming near Balclutha. He was interested in the military and was a member of an engineers unit in the Volunteer Force, which was later re-organised into the Territorial Force (TF).|$|E
5|$|His {{business}} interests having collapsed, Baker abandoned his farm and relocated from New South Wales {{to the southern}} settlement of Hobart in Van Diemen's Land. In 1814 he is recorded as holding the office of government <b>storekeeper</b> in Hobart. A year later, at an approximate age of 54, he accepted a job as town crier for the newly created Deputy Judge Advocate's Court, calling witnesses and announcing verdicts on the roadside outside the courthouse. Any remaining business links with New South Wales were severed in 1819 with the sale of Baker's former farm to a colleague, Samuel Terry, who had recently visited him in Hobart. His wife, Elizabeth Baker, died in April 1824 and was buried in Hobart Cemetery.|$|E

5|$|Aslam and Khan confront {{one another}} as the police, having been alerted to Khan's {{location}} by a <b>storekeeper,</b> descend upon Dongri. Shoaib rains down blows and insults upon Aslam, urging him to defend {{himself in front of}} Jasmine. Nevertheless, Aslam, who still feels indebted and bound to Khan, does not fight back until Inspector Awant appears through the gathered crowd - even then, Aslam only pushes Khan away so that Khan is not shot by the officer. Reacting quickly, Khan draws a pistol of his own and shoots Awant before turning his weapon on Jasmine and Aslam. Jasmine, through tears and while holding a bleeding Aslam, tells Khan that he is truly evil and will never have her love. Khan seems to recognize the truth in her words as he drops his weapon and stares at the couple. Just then, more police officers arrive on the scene and open fire on Khan, who, now injured, is dragged away by one of his henchmen. He and Aslam, both alive but bloodied, lock eyes and reach out for another, having finally put aside their differences.|$|E
5|$|Benbow's {{experience}} led to {{him being}} promoted {{to a similar}} flotilla, this time to be deployed against Dunkirk {{under the command of}} Vice-Admiral Shovell. A number of converted merchant vessels, rigged like fireships but designed to explode rather than burn, were assigned to support the expedition. Benbow had a hand in preparing these vessels for the operation throughout 1694, and worked closely with the principal <b>storekeeper</b> of the ordnance, Willem Meesters. Benbow's attacking fleet was covered by Shovell's fleet on the Downs and the attack was planned for 12 and 13 September. However, the French were able to block the entrance to the port, preventing Benbow's squadron from entering, and a storm further disrupted operations. Benbow drew back from Dunkirk, and instead sailed around to Calais, where he carried out a further bombardment on 27 September. He returned to the Downs and then resumed his duties at Deptford Dockyard. He spent December organising a convoy for a fleet of merchant vessels due to sail to Cadiz.|$|E
5|$|Born on 13 August 1901 in Townsville, Queensland, Ellis Wackett was {{the third}} and {{youngest}} child of James, an English-born <b>storekeeper,</b> and Alice Wackett (née Lawrence). Following schooling in Townsville, he entered the Royal Australian Naval College at Jervis Bay, New South Wales, in 1914, aged thirteen. Graduating in 1918, {{he served as a}} midshipman aboard the Royal Navy battleship HMS Monarch and battlecruiser , and later the RAN light cruiser HMAS Brisbane and battlecruiser HMAS Australia. He was commissioned a sub-lieutenant in January 1921, and posted to England for study in July. Wackett was at the Royal Naval Engineering College, Keyham, when he applied to join the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) in 1922. Accepted by the Air Force the following year, he finished at Keyham in August and trained as a pilot on Salisbury Plain. He then took a one-year post-graduate course in aeronautics at the Imperial College of Science and Technology, London, before returning to Australia to take up his service as a flying officer with the RAAF.|$|E

5|$|In 1798 Baker {{received}} a third official appointment, as government <b>storekeeper</b> for the Hawkesbury region {{in addition to}} his equivalent duties in Parramatta. Despite his past experience, Baker was quickly found wanting in the management of the stores, specifically those for farmers near the settlement of Windsor. In 1798 the local grain harvest was too large to be receipted and stored in the Windsor storehouse, so Baker elected to fill that store solely with produce supplied by the region's three largest landholders. In consequence, smaller farmers at Windsor had no means of selling or storing their grain and were brought close to bankruptcy. Baker was deaf to their complaints, and Governor Hunter was forced to intervene in person to keep the peace. In a letter on 19 April, sent via the New South Wales Corps commander in Hawkesbury, Hunter directed Baker to return half of the harvest he had already stored, and instead fill the storehouse with goods from smaller farms.|$|E
5|$|John Calvin Coolidge Jr. {{was born}} in Plymouth Notch, Windsor County, Vermont, on July 4, 1872, the only U.S. {{president}} to be born on Independence Day. He was the elder of the two children of John Calvin Coolidge Sr. (1845–1926) and Victoria Josephine Moor (1846–85). Coolidge Senior engaged in many occupations, and developed a statewide reputation as a prosperous farmer, <b>storekeeper</b> and public servant. He held various local offices, including {{justice of the peace}} and tax collector and served in the Vermont House of Representatives as well as the Vermont Senate. Coolidge's mother was the daughter of a Plymouth Notch farmer. She was chronically ill and died, perhaps from tuberculosis, when Coolidge was twelve years old. His younger sister, Abigail Grace Coolidge (1875–1890), {{died at the age of}} fifteen, probably of appendicitis, when Coolidge was eighteen. Coolidge's father married a Plymouth schoolteacher in 1891, and lived to the age of eighty.|$|E
5|$|Weir {{was born}} in Norwood, South Australia, on 23 April 1866, a son of Alfred Weir and Susannah Mary (née Price). His father was a carpenter, who had emigrated to South Australia from Aberdeen, Scotland, in 1839, {{two years after the}} colony was founded. Weir {{attended}} Moore's School, the Norwood Public School, and Pulteney Street Grammar School. In 1879, at the age of 13, he joined the Surveyor General's Department as an office assistant. He assisted the surveyor who pegged out the land at the rear of Government House, Adelaide, for the Torrens Parade Ground, and was later promoted to clerk. On 14 May 1890, he married Rosa Wadham at the Christian Chapel, Norwood. He rose through the department to be appointed Survey <b>Storekeeper,</b> Custodian of Plans and Custodian of Government Motor Cars, on 1 July 1911.

Local leaders {{were reported to}} have sometimes dressed as women, i.e., as mothers begging for food for their children. The leader might approach a <b>storekeeper</b> and demand a donation of flour or groceries.
