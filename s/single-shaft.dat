25|$|In the mid-1970s, Canadian Marine Drilling (Canmar), the {{drilling}} subsidiary of Dome Petroleum, began {{drilling for oil}} in the Canadian part of the Beaufort Sea using ice-strengthened drillships and an extensive support fleet of icebreaking vessels. Aiming for year-round operations, the company also began developing its own experimental icebreaker concepts to support exploration drilling and, eventually, production-related operations. The first vessel of this research and development program was the 1979-built Canmar Kigoriak which represented {{a radical departure from}} conventional icebreaker designs with, among other features, a <b>single-shaft</b> mechanical propulsion system instead of a more commonly-used diesel-electric powertrain.|$|E
2500|$|The combined-cycle system {{includes}} <b>single-shaft</b> and multi-shaft configurations. The <b>single-shaft</b> system {{consists of}} one gas turbine, one steam turbine, one generator and one Heat Recovery Steam Generator (HRSG), with the gas turbine and steam turbine coupled {{to the single}} generator in a tandem arrangement on a single shaft. Key advantages of the <b>single-shaft</b> arrangement are operating simplicity, smaller footprint, and lower startup cost. [...] <b>Single-shaft</b> arrangements, however, will tend to have less flexibility and equivalent reliability than multi-shaft blocks. Additional operational flexibility is provided with a steam turbine which can be disconnected, using a synchro-self-shifting (SSS) Clutch, for start up or for simple cycle operation of the gas turbine.|$|E
2500|$|The {{series hybrid}} {{prototype}} had a {{gas turbine engine}} APU placed in the trunk. A single-stage, <b>single-shaft,</b> recuperated gas turbine unit with a high-speed permanent-magnet AC generator was provided by Williams International; it weighed , measured [...] in diameter by [...] long and was running between 100,000 and 140,000rpm. The turbine could run {{on a number of}} high-octane alternative fuels, from octane-boosted gasoline to compressed natural gas. The APU started automatically when the battery charge dropped below 40% and delivered [...] of electrical power, sufficient to simultaneously sustain the EV1's 80mph top speed whilst returning the car's 44 NiMH cells to (and maintain them at) a 50% charge level.|$|E
2500|$|The AI-20 is a <b>single-shaft</b> {{turboprop}} with a ten-stage {{axial compressor}} and a three-stage power turbine, {{and is designed}} to run at a constant speed. A big problem with early production engines was the poor reliability of the AI-20 engines, which had a time between overhauls (TBO) {{in the range of}} 600 to 750 hours. The AI-20K engine variant was finally introduced, with a TBO of 2,000 hours – unimpressive by modern standards, but a big improvement. One issue that was never addressed was noise; turboprops are relatively noisy and high noise levels were a [...] problem for the passengers. As mentioned, the overhaul life of the engine was initially poor compared with contemporary western engines, being reported as 600–750 hours in 1964, but was later improved by continuous development to 8,000 hours, with a service life of 22,000 hours in the AI-20D series 5M.|$|E
2500|$|The SNECMA M53 {{afterburning}} turbofan {{was developed}} for the ACF, and was available for the Mirage 2000 project. It is a <b>single-shaft</b> engine of modular construction that is relatively light and simple compared {{to those of the}} British or American designs. The M53 consists of three low-pressure turbine stages, five high-pressure stages and two turbine stages. With the development programme consisting of 20 engines, the M53 sans suffix was first bench tested in February 1970 and became airborne on a Caravelle testbed in July 1973. Dassault conducted flight tests of the M53-2 version using its Mirage F1E testbeds starting in December 1974; this version produced [...] in afterburner. The Mirage 2000 itself was powered by two versions of the M53 – the M53-5, which equipped initial operational aircraft, was rated at [...] of thrust with afterburner. The definitive version of the engine, the M53-P2, which equipped the majority of the type, is rated at [...] in dry thrust and [...] in afterburner.|$|E
2500|$|The J402-CA-400 was a <b>single-shaft</b> engine, {{with one}} axial {{compressor}} stage and one centrifugal compressor stage. The compressed air was combusted in an annular combustor, and then {{passed through a}} single high-pressure turbine stage before being exhausted. Because the engine was designed for a one-time use missile, its service life was only one hour. The primary challenge of the [...] "wooden round" [...] requirement was to design the engine to be as reliable as possible. To that end, significant {{efforts were made to}} reduce the number of individual parts throughout the engine. For example, the rotor system of the J402 had 16 parts, while the J69 (the parent engine) had 149 parts for the same system. Another simplifying measure was to eliminate the standard gearbox. All the engine accessories, like the fuel pump and electrical alternator, ran directly off the rotor shaft. Engine starting was another reliability-critical function of the engine, and to accomplish that requirement, the J402 utilizes pyrotechnic cartridges to start the engine. Finally, the engine was among the first to feature a fully electronic analog fuel controller.|$|E

50|$|Staged {{combustion}} designs can {{be either}} <b>single-shaft</b> or twin-shaft. In the <b>single-shaft</b> design, one set of preburner and turbine drives both propellant turbopumps. Examples include the Energomash RD-180 and the Blue Origin BE-4. In the twin-shaft design, the two propellant turbopumps are driven by separate turbines, which are in turn driven by the outflow of either one or separate preburners. Examples of twin-shaft designs include the Rocketdyne RS-25, the JAXA LE-7, and the Raptor. Relative to a <b>single-shaft</b> design, the twin-shaft design requires an additional set of preburner and turbine, but allows for individual control of the two turbopumps.|$|E
50|$|Although {{far from}} common, the <b>single-shaft</b> {{turbofan}} {{is probably the}} simplest configuration, comprising a fan and high-pressure compressor driven by a single turbine unit, {{all on the same}} shaft. The SNECMA M53, which powers Mirage fighter aircraft, {{is an example of a}} <b>single-shaft</b> turbofan. Despite the simplicity of the turbomachinery configuration, the M53 requires a variable area mixer to facilitate part-throttle operation.|$|E
