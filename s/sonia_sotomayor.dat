5|$|All Supreme Court justices {{were white}} and of European {{heritage}} until the appointment of Thurgood Marshall, the first African American Justice, in 1967. Since then, only two other non-white Justices have been appointed, Marshall's African-American successor, Clarence Thomas in 1991, and <b>Sonia</b> <b>Sotomayor</b> in 2009.|$|E
5|$|Chief Justice John Roberts, {{joined by}} Justice <b>Sonia</b> <b>Sotomayor,</b> dissented from the majority's ruling. It {{was the first}} time that Roberts and Sotomayor were the only two dissenters in a case; they had been on the court {{together}} since 2009.|$|E

According to the Smithsonian at the time, the painting was on loan to the museum for three years.|$|E
5|$|A {{cultural}} icon, Nancy Drew {{is cited}} as a formative influence {{by a number of}} women, from Supreme Court Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and <b>Sonia</b> <b>Sotomayor</b> to former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and former First Lady Laura Bush. Feminist literary critics have analyzed the character's enduring appeal, arguing variously that Nancy Drew is a mythic hero, an expression of wish fulfillment, or an embodiment of contradictory ideas about femininity.|$|E

5|$|In May 2009, President Barack Obama {{nominated}} a Catholic woman, <b>Sonia</b> <b>Sotomayor,</b> {{to replace}} retiring Justice David Souter. Her confirmation raised {{the number of}} Catholics on the Court to six, compared to three non-Catholics (all Jewish). With Antonin Scalia's death in February 2016, the number of Catholic Justices went back to five. Neil Gorsuch, appointed in 2017, was raised Catholic but attends an Episcopalian church; it is unclear if he considers himself a Catholic or a Protestant.|$|E
5|$|On August 6, 2009, Franken {{presided over}} the {{confirmation}} vote of <b>Sonia</b> <b>Sotomayor</b> to be an Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court.

His first piece of legislation, the Service Dogs for Veterans Act, which he wrote jointly with Republican Johnny Isakson, passed the Senate with unanimous consent, establishing a program with the United States Department of Veterans Affairs to pair disabled veterans with service dogs.|$|E
5|$|All but {{a handful}} of Supreme Court justices have been married. Frank Murphy, Benjamin Cardozo, and James McReynolds were all lifelong bachelors. In addition, retired justice David Souter and current justice Elena Kagan have never been married. William O. Douglas was the first Justice to divorce while on the Court, and also had the most marriages of any Justice, with four. Justice John Paul Stevens {{divorced}} his first wife in 1979, marrying his second wife later that year. <b>Sonia</b> <b>Sotomayor</b> was the first female justice to be appointed as an unmarried woman, having divorced in 1983, long before her nomination in 2009.|$|E
5000|$|On April 20, 2009, President Barack Obama {{nominated}} Sessions to be Chair of the United States Sentencing Commission.

5|$|Obama {{appointed}} {{two women}} {{to serve on}} the Supreme Court {{in the first two years}} of his Presidency. He nominated <b>Sonia</b> <b>Sotomayor</b> on May 26, 2009 to replace retiring Associate Justice David Souter; she was confirmed on August 6, 2009, becoming the first Supreme Court Justice of Hispanic descent. Obama nominated Elena Kagan on May 10, 2010 to replace retiring Associate Justice John Paul Stevens. She was confirmed on August 5, 2010, bringing the number of women sitting simultaneously on the Court to three justices for the first time in American history.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 20th century, a few Roman Catholics were appointed, but {{concerns}} about {{diversity of the}} Court were mainly in terms of geographic diversity, to represent all geographic regions of the country, as opposed to ethnic, religious, or gender diversity. The 20th century saw the first appointment of justices who were Jewish (Louis Brandeis, 1916), African-American (Thurgood Marshall, 1967), female (Sandra Day O'Connor, 1981), and Italian-American (Antonin Scalia, 1986). The 21st century saw the first appointment of a Hispanic justice (<b>Sonia</b> <b>Sotomayor,</b> 2009), if justice Benjamin Cardozo, who was a Sephardi Jew of Portuguese descent and appointed in 1932, is excluded.|$|E
5|$|Ruth Bader Ginsburg (born Joan Ruth Bader; March 15, 1933) is an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. Ginsburg was {{appointed}} by President Bill Clinton and took {{the oath of office}} on August 10, 1993. She is the second female justice to be confirmed to the Court (after Sandra Day O'Connor), and one of four female justices to be confirmed (with <b>Sonia</b> <b>Sotomayor</b> and Elena Kagan, who are still serving). Following Justice O'Connor's retirement, and prior to Justice Sotomayor joining the Court, Ginsburg was the only female justice on the Supreme Court. During that time, Ginsburg became more forceful with her dissents, noted by legal observers and in popular culture. She is generally viewed as belonging to the liberal wing of the Court. Notable majority opinions Ginsburg has authored include United States v. Virginia, Olmstead v. L.C., and Friends of the Earth Inc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Services, Inc.|$|E
40|$|Judge <b>Sonia</b> <b>Sotomayor’s</b> {{assertion}} that female judges might be “better” than male judges has generated accusations of sexism and potential bias. An equally controversial claim is that male judges {{are better than}} female judges because the latter have benefited from affirmative action. These claims are susceptible to empirical analysis. Primarily using a dataset of all the state high court judges in 1998 - 2000, we estimate three measures of judicial output: opinion production, outside state citations, and co-partisan disagreements. We find that {{the male and female}} judges perform at about the same level. Roughly similar findings show up in data from the U. S. Court of Appeals and the federal district courts...|$|R

5000|$|Chief Justice Roberts {{rejected}} Justice <b>Sonia</b> <b>Sotomayor’s</b> {{contention that}} the raisin reserve requirement is a mere condition on the privilege {{of being in the}} raisin market. Rather, Chief Justice Roberts held that selling produce [...] "is not a special government benefit that the Government may hold hostage." [...] To support this assertion, Chief Justice Roberts cited a footnote in Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp., which theorized forfeiting rent payments would not be a mere condition on the privilege of being a landlord. Chief Justice Roberts also refused to apply the Tucker Act because that question was already resolved in Horne I. Finally, Chief Justice Roberts refused to remand the case back to a lower court to decide the amount of compensation to which Horne would be entitled because just compensation for a physical takings is the market value of the property taken, and the Government had already calculated that value when it fined Horne.|$|R

40|$|In this essay, five {{business}} law professors with specialties in five different doctrinal areas analyze Justice <b>Sonia</b> <b>Sotomayor’s</b> jurisprudence {{in those areas}} and consider the implications of her appointment to the Supreme Court. Each of the areas, intellectual property, antitrust, securities, ERISA, and employment law, involves an area of federal law of significant importance to businesses. Although employment law also {{is a matter of}} state law, this essay focuses on the federal employment law statutes. Based on our analysis, we believe that Justice Sotomayor will approach business cases from a neutral perspective. Overall, we find support for the generally accepted view that Justice Sotomayor hews closely to precedent and uses a careful, methodical approach to her legal decisions and case drafting. We also find support, though, in a number of the doctrinal areas that Justice Sotomayor brings a strong sense of fairness and demand for appropriate process. At the same time, there are indications across multiple areas that she is quite deferential to governmental actors, including agency expertise. Finally, her approach to damages also reflects her sense of fairness with examples indicating a tendency to limit damage awards to the amount of loss by plaintiffs...|$|R
40|$|This Article {{does not}} address the medical debate {{surrounding}} the role of midazolam in executions; the problems associated with using the drug have been persuasively argued elsewhere. Nor does it question the soundness of the Glossip Court’s “alternative method of execution” requirement. Rather, this Article’s proposed reform is a constitutionally acceptable alternative that meets the Glossip Court’s standard, rendering moot—at least {{for the purposes of the}} following discussion—very real concerns regarding the validity of that dictate. Part I of this Article pinpoints several areas where the Glossip Court goes wrong in glaringly inaccurate or misleading ways, given the vast history and literature on execution methods and their changes from the nineteenth century through the start of the twenty-first century. Part II analyzes the Court’s “known and available alternative method of execution” standard as defined by both the majority opinion and Justice <b>Sonia</b> <b>Sotomayor’s</b> dissent. Part III proposes that the firing squad is the most viable “known and available alternative” that meets the delineations, however meager, outlined by the Court. Indeed, the firing squad is the only current form of execution involving trained professionals, and it delivers a swift and certain death...|$|R
40|$|In the August 3 {{issue of}} Tax Notes, Prof. Stephen Cohen {{wrote an article}} about Justice <b>Sonia</b> <b>Sotomayor’s</b> {{opinions}} in three tax cases. Of those three cases, only the opinion she wrote in William L. Rudkin Testamentary Trust v. Commissioner, 467 F. 3 d 149 (2 d Cir. 2006), Doc 2006 - 21522, 2006 TNT 203 - 4, is worthy of comment. Although the Second Circuit’s decision in that case was affirmed by the Supreme Court under the name Knight v. Commissioner, {{the construction of the}} critical statutory language that Justice Sotomayor adopted was rejected and criticized by Chief Justice Roberts, writing for a unanimous court. Cohen concluded that Justice Sotomayor’s construction of the statutory language is ‘‘at least as valid as, and probably preferable to, the construction adopted by the Supreme Court’’ and that Chief Justice Roberts’s criticism of Justice Sotomayor’s rationale is ‘‘logically flawed. ’’ Cohen also said that Chief Justice Roberts’s criticism of Justice Sotomayor’s opinion is ‘‘unpersuasive and overstated. ’’ In my view, the construction adopted by Justice Sotomayor was incorrect, and Chief Justice Roberts’s criticism was persuasive and accurately stated. Moreover, based on policy considerations, a plausible case can be made that the courts could have construed the statute differently, resulting in a decision for the taxpayer...|$|R
