5|$|Given the chaos, the {{governor}} of Yunnan ignored the imperial orders of evacuation. The Mongol army commanded by Prince Ye-sin Timour, a grandson of the emperor, marched <b>south</b> <b>toward</b> Pagan. According to mainstream traditional (British colonial era) scholarship, the Mongol army ignored the imperial orders to evacuate; fought its way down to Pagan {{with the loss of}} 7000 men; occupied the city; and sent out detachments to receive homage, one of which reached south of Prome. But not all colonial period scholars agreed with the assessment as none of the contemporary Mongol/Chinese records specifically mentioned the conquest of Pagan or the temporary completeness of the conquest.|$|E

5|$|In late 1775, Benjamin Church, the Director General, {{assigned}} McKnight to the Putnam House building, {{one of six}} hospitals of the army's Hospital Department in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He {{remained in}} that division, which supported Washington's army, until, {{during a period of}} great scarcity of medical and surgical supplies for the sick and wounded, McKnight went with other surgeons and physicians to North Castle, New York with Washington's army when the Battle of White Plains began in October 1776. The Continental Army lost the battle, and the British took Fort Washington and Fort Lee, which pushed Washington's ragged army <b>south</b> <b>toward</b> New Jersey in December 1776, which {{set the stage for the}} Battle of Trenton.|$|E
5|$|North of Bedford, M-37 meanders through rural Barry County. The road {{passes through}} mixed {{agricultural}} and forest lands near several small lakes in the area. On its path to Hastings, the trunkline runs through Dowling and meets the western terminus of M-79. The highway follows Hanover Street {{through the south}} side of Hastings into downtown, where it turns west on Green Street and north on Broadway Street. At the intersection of Broadway and State streets, M-37 meets and joins M-43. West of Hastings, M-43 separates and heads <b>south</b> <b>toward</b> Kalamazoo while M-37 turns northwesterly and runs parallel to the Thornapple River. The highway follows the river west and north to the community of Middleville through mixed farms and forests.|$|E
5|$|Waller mustered his men in Farnham Park near 10:30p.m., on 12 December. At around midnight, 5,000 of Waller's men marched {{west from}} Farnham toward Basing House. The Parliamentarians marched {{about two miles}} in this {{direction}} (in order to confuse Royalist scouts), until around 1:00a.m., before abruptly turning <b>south</b> <b>toward</b> Alton. The march was quick and quiet, owing to a long frost which had hardened the roads and Waller's judicious use of wooded areas. Also helpful in Waller's advance was his use of leather guns, here employed {{for the first time}} in the English Civil War. Unlike heavier artillery, a leather gun could be led by a single horse, transported efficiently over difficult terrain, and still be an effective tool for bombardment.|$|E

5|$|A new county-designated highway {{appeared}} on maps {{for the first}} time in 1983, H-16; it was marked as running between US2 and M-28 only. This designation was removed in the 1985 edition of the map. The H-16 label reappeared in 1992; this time it was shown continuing <b>south</b> <b>toward</b> the Wisconsin state line and north to M-38, along the routing of FFH-16. The roadway is part of the Forest Highway System that is funded and administered by the US Forest Service and the Federal Highway Administration; the system was created by the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1921. The highway has never been included in the CDH system as Iron, Houghton and Ontonagon counties do not participate in the system, and the Upper Peninsula east of US41 is the G zone, not the H zone.|$|E
5|$|After being named, Ivy quickly {{intensified}} {{after its}} convection was {{drawn into the}} circulation. Late on February 23, the JTWC upgraded Ivy to {{the equivalent of a}} Category1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale, and the FMS followed suit the following day by upgrading Ivy to a severe tropical cyclone as continued favorable conditions allowed for rapid deepening. On February 24 the cyclone began a turn to the southwest as it moved around the ridge, and the next day it turned to the <b>south</b> <b>toward</b> Vanuatu as an approaching shortwave trough passed to the south and created a weakness in the ridge. A nearby upper-level low temporarily cut off outflow, although once it moved further away the low enhanced ventilation. Strengthening continued and, late on February 25, the FMS reported that Ivy attained peak 10–minute sustained winds of 165km/h (105mph) over the Vanuatu archipelago; this made it a Category4 on the Australian Region Tropical Cyclone Intensity Scale. Around the same time, the JTWC estimated peak 1–minute sustained winds of 195km/h (120mph), after a 19km (12mi) eye developed.|$|E
5|$|As {{tensions}} mounted {{between the}} Indians in the Northwest Territory and settlers on the Kentucky frontier, President Washington began sanctioning joint operations between federal army troops and local frontier militia against the Indians. In April 1790, Scott raised {{a contingent of}} volunteers from Bourbon and Fayette counties to join Josiah Harmar in a raid against the Western Confederacy along the Scioto River in {{what would become the}} U.S. state of Ohio. The combined force of regulars and militia departed from Limestone on April 18, 1790, crossing the Ohio River and marching to the upper Scioto. From there, they headed <b>south,</b> <b>toward</b> the present-day city of Portsmouth, Ohio, and discovered an abandoned Indian camp. Fresh footprints, including those of a well-known Shawnee warrior– nicknamed Reel Foot because of his two club feet– led away from the camp site. Scott sent a small detachment to follow the tracks; ultimately, they discovered and killed four Shawnee, including Reel Foot. Other than this, the expedition accomplished nothing, and it disbanded on August 27, 1790.|$|E

5|$|At 09:50 on 23 August, a U.S. PBY Catalina {{flying boat}} (based at Ndeni in the Santa Cruz Islands) {{initially}} sighted Tanaka's convoy. By late afternoon, with no further sightings of Japanese ships, two aircraft strike forces from Saratoga and Henderson Field took off {{to attack the}} convoy. However, Tanaka, knowing that an attack would be forthcoming following the PBY sighting, reversed course once he had departed the area, and eluded the strike aircraft. After Tanaka reported to his superiors his loss of time by turning north to avoid the expected Allied airstrike, the landings of his troops on Guadalcanal was pushed back to 25 August. By 18:23 on 23 August, with no Japanese carriers sighted and no new intelligence reporting of {{their presence in the}} area, Fletcher detached Wasp (which was getting low on fuel) and the rest of TF18 for the two-day trip <b>south</b> <b>toward</b> Efate Island to refuel.

5|$|At Caspers Wilderness Park, the San Juan Canyon {{opens up}} into a fairly wide valley {{in the foothills of}} the Santa Ana Mountains.

It is joined by Bell Canyon from the right, from several residential communities that overlook, but do not border, it. and Verdugo Canyon Creek from the left. Trampas Canyon enters from the left and Cañada Gobernadora and Cañada Chiquita enter from the right. The creek flows through residential Rancho Mission Viejo, crosses under Interstate 5, and enters a concrete flood control channel, turning south and receiving El Horno Creek on the right. It receives its largest tributary, Trabuco Creek, from the right, then flows <b>south</b> <b>toward</b> the Pacific Ocean. The creek forms a fresh water lagoon at the northern end of Doheny State Beach, which overflows into Capistrano Bay during periods of high flow.|$|E
5|$|In 1908, the New York State Legislature created Route22, an {{unsigned}} legislative {{route that}} was initially {{split into two}} segments. The northern half of the route ran from Riparius to Rouses Point and mostly followed what is now US9 between the two locations. From Elizabethtown to Keeseville, however, Route22 followed a more westerly alignment via Keene, Jay, and Au Sable Forks. When {{the first set of}} posted routes in New York were assigned in 1924, all of legislative Route22 north of Riparius became part of NY6, which continued <b>south</b> <b>toward</b> Glens Falls on what is now US9. At the same time, the section of modern NY9N between Saratoga Springs and Lake George was designated as part of NY10. The portion between Ticonderoga and Westport became part of a realigned NY30 by the following year.|$|E

5|$|In its {{simplest}} {{form the}} star compass describes 32 points at which key stars rise {{on the eastern}} horizon and set on the western horizon. North latitude is fairly easy to determine because the North Pole has a zenith star easily seen with the naked eye, called Polaris (Wuliwulifasmughet). Polaris' height above the horizon indicates the viewer's southward displacement from Polaris' nadir, he North Pole. When one travels further north, Polaris appears higher in the sky. Only at the true north pole is Polaris directly overhead at nearly 90 degrees altitude. When one travels <b>south</b> <b>toward</b> the equator, Polaris appears to descend toward the northern horizon. At 45 degrees north latitude, Polaris is 45 degrees above the northern horizon. Near the equator, Polaris' altitude approaches zero degrees, but for the viewer just further south, Polaris will have disappeared below the northern horizon.|$|E
5|$|MD346 {{continues}} east as Old Ocean City Boulevard, {{passing along}} {{the southern edge of}} Whaleyville, where the highway intersects MD610 (Whaleyville Road).

MD346 turns southeast, paralleling US50 for a while before turning <b>south</b> <b>toward</b> the center of Berlin. Upon entering the town limits of Berlin, the state highway curves east to intersect MD818 (Main Street). MD346 has a grade crossing of the Maryland and Delaware Railroad's Snow Hill Line track, then intersects MD377 (Williams Street) immediately before an intersection with US113 (Worcester Highway). The state highway passes south of Atlantic General Hospital and veers northeast to its eastern terminus at a tangent intersection with US50.|$|E
5|$|Sailing <b>south</b> <b>toward</b> {{the island}} of Mindanao, López de Legazpi's fleet {{encountered}} highwinds forcing them to sail northward to {{the island of}} Bohol. There, he captured a vessel from Borneo whose Malay sailors informed the Spaniards that the natives inhabiting the region traded with people from Borneo and Indonesia. Arriving in Bohol, López de Legazpi noticed the hostility of the people. The Malayan servant explained that such hostility {{was due to the}} expeditions conducted by the Portuguese from the Moluccas islands. In 1563, Portuguese fleets arrived in Visayan waters and enslaved about 1,000 inhabitants. López de Legazpi, {{with the help of the}} Malayan sailor, explained to the tribes in Bohol that they were not Portuguese and that they had come to the islands to trade. Upon learning this, the chieftains and their tribes became friendlier and welcoming to the Spaniards.|$|E

5|$|The Reserve {{crossed the}} river at Kehl, swung <b>south</b> <b>toward</b> Freiburg im Breisgau, and crossed the {{mountains}} at Neustadt, to Loffingen, Bruhlingen and Hüfingen. At the Battle of Ostrach, the Reserve remained in the northern outskirts of Pfullendorf and {{did not participate in}} the battle except in small groups. When Jourdan decided to withdraw, d'Hautpoul's cavalry moved to the west first, to secure bridges and the east-west roads. At the battle of Stockach, the Reserve was slow to support of Ferino's I. Division, which had run out of ammunition; when a cavalry charged failed to materialize, the Austrians acquired the upper hand. Jourdan later charged d'Hautpoul with dereliction. After the Stockach engagement, most of the Reserve withdrew to {{the west side of the}} Black Forest, where the horses could find forage, but by late April, the Reserve had joined with the André Masséna's Army of Helvetia outside of Zürich; d'Hautpoul joined them in July after he was cleared by a Courts-martial in Strasbourg.|$|E
5|$|The Rhine Campaign of 1795 had {{concluded}} with an armistice. On 20 May 1796, the Austrians notified the French that the truce would end on 1 June. The minute it expired, Kléber led two divisions across the armistice line heading <b>south</b> <b>toward</b> Charles' right wing. The French beat the Duke of Württemberg in the Battle of Altenkirchen on 4 June, capturing 3,000 Austrians, four colors and 12 guns. By 6 June Kléber's wing {{was on the}} Lahn River and Archduke Charles began evacuating {{the west bank of}} the Rhine in order to concentrate against the French incursion. Kléber was joined within a few days by Jourdan and most of the Army of the Sambre-et-Meuse. At about this time, the Austrian high command began transferring Wurmser and 25,000 Austrians to Italy due to the successes of Napoleon Bonaparte. On 15 June, the archduke defeated the French in the Battle of Wetzlar. Subsequently, Jourdan recrossed to {{the west bank of the}} Rhine while Kléber retreated north toward Düsseldorf.|$|E
5|$|The failed Egyptian {{offensive}} {{gave the}} initiative to the Israelis, who immediately launched Operation Abiray-Lev, aiming to cross the canal between two Egyptian armies in order to encircle Egyptian forces on the east banks and cut their supply lines. Optimistically planned, the operation began smoothly, but quickly ran into problems. The Israelis faced difficulties in establishing a corridor to the canal due to unexpectedly determined resistance by Egyptian defenses, in {{what became known as}} the Battle of the Chinese Farm. After several days of heavy fighting, they were able to secure the roads to the canal, and by October 18 had two bridges laid down at Deversoir, at the northern end of the Great Bitter Lake. By the next day there were three Israeli armored divisions across the canal. Two advanced <b>south</b> <b>toward</b> Suez City, while the 143rd Armored Division under Major General Ariel Sharon advanced north to seize Ismailia, hoping to sever the supply lines to three Egyptian divisions of the Second Field Army across the canal.|$|E
