To obtain a more global and accurate view of the events leading to DNA sequence duplications, we have selected and characterized duplication occurrences in diploid S. cerevisiae cells. The molecular analysis showed that two other predominant ways lead to duplication in this context: formation of extra chimeric chromosomes and non-reciprocal translocation events.

The computation of the algorithmic complexity (Kolmogorov) <b>is</b> <b>a</b> recently introduced method of global analysis for DNA <b>sequences.</b> The complexity <b>is</b> not directly computable, but one can estimate it using the compressibility of the given sequence. Intuitively, the more compressible <b>a</b> <b>sequence</b> <b>is,</b> the less complex it is; <b>a</b> random <b>sequence</b> <b>is</b> virtually incompressible.

The method {{can also be used}} for detecting low complexity sequences, as well as homogeneous domain-like regions. This new procedure has also enabled the construction of phylogenetic trees.

40|$|Abstract Background Bisulfite <b>sequencing</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> {{technique}} to study DNA cytosine methylation. Bisulfite treatment followed by PCR amplification specifically converts unmethylated cytosines to thymine. Coupled with {{next generation sequencing}} technology, {{it is able to}} detect the methylation status of every cytosine in the genome. However, mapping high-throughput bisulfite reads to the reference genome remains a great challenge due to the increased searching space, reduced complexity of bisulfite sequence, asymmetric cytosine to thymine alignments, and multiple CpG heterogeneous methylation. Results We developed an efficient bisulfite reads mapping algorithm BSMAP to address the above issues. BSMAP combines genome hashing and bitwise masking to achieve fast and accurate bisulfite mapping. Compared with existing bisulfite mapping approaches, BSMAP is faster, more sensitive and more flexible. Conclusion BSMAP is the first general-purpose bisulfite mapping software.

Similarly, in other malignancies leukemia cells accumulate mutations during growth, forming heterogeneous cell populations that are subject to Darwinian selection and may respond differentially to treatment. There is therefore a clinical need to monitor changes in the subclonal composition of cancers during disease progression. Here, we use whole-genome sequencing to track subclonal heterogeneity in 3 chronic {{lymphocytic leukemia}} patients subjected to repeated cycles of therapy. We reveal different somatic mutation profiles in each patient and use these to establish probable hierarchical patterns of subclonal evolution, to identify subclones that decline or expand over time, and to detect founder mutations. We show that clonal evolution patterns are heterogeneous in individual patients. We conclude that genome <b>sequencing</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> and sensitive approach to monitor disease progression repeatedly at the molecular level.

Exploring available arthropod genomic <b>sequences</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> way to obtain the repertoire of peptidase inhibitors in every arthropod species and to understand the evolutionary mechanisms {{involved in the}} diversification {{of this kind of}} proteins. A genomic comparative analysis of peptidase inhibitors in species belonging to different arthropod taxonomic groups was performed. The results point out: i) species or clade-specific presence is shown for several families of peptidase inhibitors; ii) multidomain peptidase inhibitors are commonly found in many peptidase inhibitor families; iii) several families have a wide range of members in different arthropod species; iv) several peptidase inhibitor families show species-specific (or clade-specific) gene family expansions; v) functional divergence may be assumed for particular clades; vi) passive expansions may be used by natural selection to fix adaptations. In conclusion, conservation and divergence of duplicated genes and the potential recruitment as peptidase inhibitors of proteins from other families are the main mechanisms used by arthropods to fix diversity. This diversity would be associated to the control of target peptidases and, as consequence, to adapt to specific environments...|$|R
40|$|Future quantum {{technologies}} {{rely heavily}} on good protection of quantum entanglement against environment-induced decoherence. A recent study showed that an extension of Uhrig's dynamical decoupling (UDD) sequence can (in theory) lock an arbitrary but known two-qubit entangled state to the $N$th order using a sequence of $N$ control pulses [Mukhtar et al., Phys. Rev. A 81, 012331 (2010) ]. By nesting three layers of explicitly constructed UDD sequences, here we first consider the protection of unknown two-qubit states as superposition of two known basis states, without making assumptions of the system-environment coupling. It is found that the obtained decoherence suppression can be highly sensitive to the ordering of the three UDD layers and can be remarkably effective with the correct ordering. The detailed theoretical results are useful for general {{understanding of the nature}} of controlled quantum dynamics under nested UDD. As an extension of our three-layer UDD, it is finally pointed out that a completely unknown two-qubit state can be protected by nesting four layers of UDD sequences. This work indicates that when UDD is applicable (e. g., when environment has a sharp frequency cut-off and when control pulses can be taken as instantaneous pulses), dynamical decoupling using nested UDD <b>sequences</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> approach for entanglement protection.

One particularly useful application is the identification of mutations obtained by classical phenotypic screens in model species.

A number of software pipelines for mutation identification have been targeted to C. elegans, with particular emphasis on ease of use, incorporation of mapping strain data, subtraction of background variants, and similar criteria. Although success is predicated upon the sensitive and accurate detection of candidate alleles, relatively little effort has been invested in evaluating the underlying software components that are required for mutation identification. Therefore, we have benchmarked a number of commonly used tools for sequence alignment and variant calling, in all pair-wise combinations, against both simulated and actual datasets.

In some cases, patients are affected by neurological alterations. XP is caused by mutations in 8 distinct genes (XPA through XPG and XPV). The XP-V (variant) subtype of the disease results from mutations in a gene (XPV, also named POLH) which encodes for Polg, {{a member of the}} Y-DNA polymerase family. Although the presence and severity of skin and neurological dysfunctions differ between XP subtypes, there are overlapping clinical features among subtypes such that the sub-type cannot be deduced from the clinical features.

To compute sheaf cohomology, Leray introduced a computational technique now known as the Leray spectral sequence. This gave a relation between cohomology groups of a sheaf and cohomology groups of the pushforward of the sheaf. The relation involved an infinite process. Leray found that the cohomology groups of the pushforward formed a natural chain complex, so that he could take the cohomology of the cohomology. This was still not the cohomology of the original sheaf, but it was one step closer in a sense. The cohomology of the cohomology again formed a chain complex, and its cohomology formed a chain complex, and so on. The limit of this infinite process was essentially the same as the cohomology groups of the original sheaf.|$|R

Such analyses are data intensive, requiring {{the inclusion of}} genomic multiple sequence alignments, sequence annotations, and scores describing regional attributes of columns in the alignment. Visualization and browsing of results can be difficult, and there are currently limited software options for performing this task. Results The Application for Browsing Constraints (ABC) is interactive Java software for intuitive and efficient exploration of multiple sequence alignments and data typically associated with alignments. It is used to move quickly from a summary view of the entire alignment via arbitrary levels of resolution to individual alignment columns. It allows for the simultaneous display of quantitative data, (e. g., sequence similarity or evolutionary rates) and annotation data (e. g. the locations of genes, repeats, and constrained elements).
