40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new, simple and practical algorithm to avoid artifacts when switching between discrete levels of detail (LOD) by smoothly blending LOD representations in image space. We analyze the alternatives of conventional alpha-blending and so-called late-switching (the switching of LODs “far enough ” from the eyepoint), widely thought {{to solve the}} LOD <b>switching</b> <b>discontinuity</b> problem, and conclude that they either do not work in practice, or defeat the concept of LODs. In contrast we show that our algorithm produces visually pleasing blends for static and animated discrete LODs, for discrete LODs with different types of LOD representations (e. g. billboards and meshes) and even to some extent totally different objects with similar spatial extent, with a very small runtime overhead...|$|E
40|$|We analyze Axelrod's {{model of}} social {{interactions}} on coevolving complex networks. We introduce four extensions with different mechanisms of edge rewiring. The models {{are intended to}} catch two kinds of interactions - preferential attachment, which {{can be observed in}} scientists or actors collaborations, and local rewiring, which can be observed in friendship formation in everyday relations. Numerical simulations show that proposed dynamics can lead to the power-law distribution of nodes' degree and high value of the clustering coefficient, while still retaining the small-world effect in three models. All models are characterized by two phase transitions of a different nature. In case of local rewiring we obtain order-disorder discontinuous phase transition even in the thermodynamic limit, while in case of long-distance <b>switching</b> <b>discontinuity</b> disappears in the thermodynamic limit, leaving one continuous phase transition. In addition, we discover a new and universal characteristic of the second transition point - an abrupt increase of the clustering coefficient, due to formation of many small complete subgraphs inside the network...|$|E

40|$|Body {{flexibility}} is of ever-increasing importance in multibody simulation. The current state-of-the-art simulation techniques typically have difficulties with systems in which flexible bodies can be loaded in many {{degrees of freedom}} (DOFs). However, in many applications, loading is possible in many DOFs but only few are loaded simultaneously at any given moment, such that at any moment only a low-dimensional part of the reduced body flexibility description contributes to the solution. Modal Base Switching, the methodology proposed in this paper, exploits this by judiciously choosing the body flexibility mode set and at any moment only including those modes {{that contribute to the}} solution. Modal Base Switching does not improve simulation accuracy, however it can significantly reduce simulation times. In a numerical experiment, results using Modal Base Switching match results for a conventional model using the same mode set. The approximation errors are negligible compared the accuracy loss encountered when using a mode set without compensation for the quasi-static response of the high-frequency dynamics, while both simulation results are obtained at a comparable computational cost. Modal Base <b>Switching</b> numerically introduces <b>discontinuities</b> when removing a mode from the mode set. This is overcome by time integration schemes exhibiting high-frequency numerical damping. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|We use the Longitudinal Research Database (LRD) of the U. S. Census Bureau, {{which covers}} the entire {{universe}} of private and public U. S. manufacturing firms, to study several related questions regarding the efficiency gains generated by venture capital (VC) investment in private firms. First, do VCs indeed improve the efficiency (total factor productivity, TFP) of private firms, and if so, are certain kinds of VCs (high reputation vs. low reputation) better at generating such efficiency gains than others? Second, do VCs invest in more efficient firms to begin with (screening), or do they improve efficiency after investment (monitoring) ? Third, do efficiency improvements due to VC backing arise from increases in sales or reductions in costs? Fourth, do VC backing and the associated efficiency gains affect {{the probability of a}} successful exit (IPO or acquisition) ? Our analysis shows that the overall efficiency of VC-backed firms is higher than that of non-VC-backed firms at every point in time. This efficiency advantage of VC-backed firms arises from both screening and monitoring: The efficiency of VC-backed firms prior to receiving financing is higher than that of non-VC-backed firms, and further, the growth in efficiency subsequent to VC financing is greater for such firms. The above increases in efficiency of VC-backed firms are spread over the first two rounds of VC financing after which the TFP of such firms remains constant until exit. Additionally, we show that while the TFP of firms prior to receiving financing is lower for high-reputation VC-backed firms, the increase in TFP subsequent to financing is significantly greater for these firms, consistent with high-reputation VCs having greater monitoring ability. We disentangle the screening and monitoring effects of VC backing using three different methodologies: switching regression with endogenous <b>switching,</b> regression <b>discontinuity</b> analysis, and propensity score matching. We show that while overall efficiency gains generated by VC backing arise primarily from improvements in sales, the efficiency gains of high-reputation VC-backed firms arise also from lower increases in production costs. Finally, we show that VC backing and the associated efficiency gains positively affect the probability of a successful exit. The Author 2011.

40|$|In {{the recent}} years the {{extensions}} of standard rigid multibody theory to cope with flexible bodies is becoming of essential relevance in many application fields. This {{is due to the}} fact that current applications require high operational speed to be combined with light-weight properties in order to reach efficiency and energy saving during operation. The most common approach to represent flexibility is the Floating Frame of Reference (FFR). This approach, which is already implemented in several software packages, is identified by Wasfy and Noor [1] as the most efficient way to represent flexibility for bodies that undergo large gross motion but small elastic deformation. Inclusion of flexibility using the Finite Element (FE) approach within the FFR is possible but leads, for complex systems, to very high computational load due to the large number of Degrees of Freedom (DOF) included in the simulation. Standard model reduction techniques such as Component Mode Synthesis (CMS) can be used to reduce the number of DOFs by properly choosing a modal base that is able to model deformations within a certain frequency range [2]. Up to now, one of the main limitations of the model reduction techniques applied within a FFR, is the inability to efficiently represent systems that can be loaded in several DOFs during the simulation. For these types of systems the inclusion of static modes for each of the loaded DOFs is necessary for accurate results. In many applications, especially when sliding components or contacts are involved, (e. g. slider-cranks, gears, etc.) only few of the possibly loaded DOFs might be actually loaded during a specific time interval. The novel methodology analyzed in this paper proposes to reduce the computational cost by a proper choice of the static modal base, that is varied along the simulation. This methodology is referred to as Static Modes Switching [3] and although not improving the simulation accuracy, it can greatly reduce the computational time. The methodology is tested on a numerical experiment of limited complexity, though including most of the main numerical difficulties that are supposed to be encountered on more industrially relevant applications. Static Modes <b>Switching</b> numerically introduces <b>discontinuities</b> when varying the modal base during the simulation. This is overcome by time integration schemes exhibiting high-frequency numerical damping [4]. After a focus on the main results related to accuracy and computational efficiency, the peculiarities and limitations of the proposed approach are inspected and a full discussion on future investigations and possible solutions to open issues is adressed. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe present paper {{deals with}} indoor {{positioning}} {{based on a}} technique combining the characteristics of two systems: pseudolites and repeaters. This solution tries to combine the best of each method: for pseudolites, the {{ability to cope with}} carrier phase measurements to improve the accuracy and reduce the effect of multipath, and for repeater the simplicity of the infrastructure and the automatic synchronisation with the satellite constellation. A pseudolite is a long established and relatively well-known concept: it consists of ground based stations broadcasting GNSS-like signals. A receiver based on the ground can process this signal exactly {{as if it was a}} satellite signal and use it as satellite data in the computation of a navigation solution. Thus it is possible to deploy a ground based constellation of pseudo-satellites in order to compute a position inside buildings or any places where GNSS signals are too weak to be processed by classical or highly sensitive GNSS receivers. Since the signal has the same structure as the outdoor signal, precise measurements can be carried out like carrier phase measurements allowing the multipath error to be mitigated. However, there are limitations to this method. First is the synchronisation of the ground based constellation. As in any GNSS system, synchronisation is vital and it can be very expensive to have a stable clock on each pseudolite. Second is the potentiality of high interference between the pseudolites. As the distances of propagation are relatively small and the indoor environment has a propensity to raise obstacles in the signal trajectory, the difference of power between two signals can be high enough to lead to the disruption of the weakest by the strongest. (There is also potential interference with the GNSS signals but it does not concern the present discussion.) This phenomenon is called the Near-far problem. Thus, pseudolites are interesting but limited by the synchronisation and the Near-far problem. The repeater based technique has several declinations as shown in the section II. B of the paper, but the main principle remains. It consists of collecting GPS signals from an outdoor antenna and then forwarding them indoors in a sequential switching mode without any further treatment other than amplification. Each repeater, which consists of an antenna and a cable linked to the sequential switcher, transmits signals over a specific period while the others are switched off. Signal switching induces an offset of phase on the signal received by an indoor receiver. This offset corresponds to the difference of time of arrival between two successive repeaters. Four such Time of Difference Of Arrival measurements are then necessary to compute a position. With such a method, there is no interference between repeaters, thus no longer a Near-far problem. In addition, there is no need for expensive synchronisation of the constellation, but the <b>switching</b> induces signal <b>discontinuities</b> that limit the possibility of carrier phase measurements. Consequently, it increases the influence of multipaths on the computed solution. The proposed method, called the Repealite method, consists of transmitting a repeated signal as for the repeaters. But, instead of switching, the transmission on each antenna is delayed in such a way that the codes (Which are the same, though delayed, for all satellite signals received.) transmitted on each repealite do not interfere once they arrive at the receiver antenna. The principles of this method were presented in [1] and [2]. It is clear that the continuity of the signal allows carrier phase measurements and it is also clear that no synchronisation is required. However, the Near-far problem remains and can even be worse than in the case of pseudolites. The point we want to focus on this paper is the high level of interference than can occur because of simultaneous broadcasting of different satellite signals. This can induce severe interference that can disrupt the signal. This paper mainly focuses on methods developed in order to improve correlation mitigating the effect of the interference between repealites, interference that we call systemic interference. After the state of art of the GNSS based indoor positioning techniques in section II, the principles of the Repealite method are presented in section III which ends with a theoretical description of the received signal. Section IV provides simulations from a typical indoor positioning situation in standard conditions in order to illustrate the interference influences and to study solutions that could be carried out to mitigate them. Section V summarises the paper and describes future works...|$|R
