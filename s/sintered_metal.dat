50|$|One {{interesting}} {{use of the}} <b>sintered</b> <b>metal</b> rounds is in shotguns in hostage rescue situations; the <b>sintered</b> <b>metal</b> round is used at near-contact {{range to}} shoot the lock mechanism out of doors. The resulting metal powder will immediately disperse after knocking out the door lock, and cause little or no damage to occupants of the room. Frangible rounds are also used by armed security agents on aircraft. The concern is not depressurization (a bullet hole will not depressurise an airliner), but over penetration and damage to vital electrical or hydraulic lines, or injury to an innocent bystander by a bullet that travels through a target's body completely instead of stopping in the body.|$|E

Another form is a solid one-piece metal bushing with a [...] groove channel on the inner diameter that is filled with graphite. A similar bearing replaces the figure eight groove with holes plugged with graphite. This lubricates the bearing inside and out. The last form is a plastic bearing, which has the lubricant molded into the bearing. The lubricant is released as the bearing is run in.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} weld-line {{reduction}} {{by using the}} laser <b>metal</b> <b>sintered</b> mold {{and the effect of}} hot air supply on the mold surface just before the injection have been investigated. The depth of the weld-line groove in the laser <b>metal</b> <b>sintered</b> mold is smaller than that in the conventional steel mold. Mold pressure increase in the laser <b>metal</b> <b>sintered</b> mold is faster than that in the steel mold and the peak pressure in the laser <b>metal</b> <b>sintered</b> mold is higher than that in the steel mold. This must be due to the low thermal conductivity of the laser <b>metal</b> <b>sintered</b> mold. As a preheating effect of the mold surface before the injection, hot air has been supplied on the mold surface using an air jet bulb. The reduction of the weld-line groove has been promoted in the laser <b>metal</b> <b>sintered</b> mold whereas few effects appeared in the steel mold. Surface temperature increase by the hot air supply in the laser <b>metal</b> <b>sintered</b> mold is larger than that in the steel mold.

40|$|Suspension plasma {{spraying}} (SPS) of Pd nanoparticles was evaluated {{as a new}} method for coating of dense Pd films for H 2 separation on porous substrates. The substrates were prepared by coating porous <b>sinter</b> <b>metal</b> disks with a porous yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) layer acting as a barrier against intermetallic diffusion between the <b>sinter</b> <b>metal</b> and the Pd membrane (diffusion barrier layer, DBL). Before applying the Pd coating, the <b>sinter</b> <b>metal</b> substrates were characterized by N 2 permeance measurements. The maximum pore sizes before and after coating of the DBL were determined. For SPS of Pd, particles with diameters in the range between 250 nm and 550 nm were suspended in ethyl cellulose containing {{diethylene glycol monobutyl ether}} solution. A wide process parameter field was tested in the SPS. After Pd coating, the membrane morphology was characterized with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and electron probe microanalysis (EPMA), and the membrane performance was evaluated with N 2 and H 2 permeation measurements. The thickest Pd layer (9. 5 µm) showed an ideal H 2 /N 2 permselectivity of 60 at 350 °C and a H 2 permeability of 1. 2 × 10 − 7 exp(− 1392 /T) mol m− 1 s− 1 Pa− 0. 5. Yet rather thick Pd layers of around 10 µm were required to close the pores of the rough YSZ layers, but with further optimizations, SPS appears to be a promising new way for the fabrication of robust Pd coatings on porous substrates.

40|$|Nowadays in many {{attitude}} and orbital control systems a propellants based on hydrazine are used. Due {{to the high}} toxicity and the associated high costs for storage and transport, the German Aerospace Centre (DLR) in Lampoldshausen is conducting in new and less toxics fuels. The so called “Green Propellants” should offer a lower toxicity and a better performance than hydrazine. A promising variant represents a so called premixed propellant consisting of nitrous oxide and ethylene. In this case, the oxidizer and the fuel are premixed and liquefied stored in a tank. Due to the premixed condition of the propellant flashback into the tank during the engine operation is possible. Preventing flashback is the essential safety factor for an engine working with a premixed propellant. Porous materials such as <b>sintered</b> <b>metals</b> could be suitable to prevent flashback. The pressure drop of the flashback arrestor is similar to injectors a crucial element for the later mass flow, design and performance of the engine. The pressure drop of various porous <b>sintered</b> <b>metals</b> is investigated experimentally in this thesis. Following the experiments, the measurement data will {{be compared to the}} results of the classical pressure drop formulas for porous media from Forchheimer and Ergun. The test engine for nitrous oxide/ ethylene mixtures (HyNOx) of DLR is recently operating with gaseous propellant. Thus the investigation of the pressure drop across porous media is analysed by using several gases. Due to the compressibility and the high speeds of a gaseous flow differences between the theoretical predictions and the actual pressure drop measurement occur. Furthermore in this thesis the introduction of a design tool for porous materials will be made. With this design tool accurate prediction of the pressure drop will be possible. Finally, a check is made whether a flashback arrester of <b>sintered</b> <b>metals</b> can be generally used with the selected propellant combination to prevent flashback...|$|R

50|$|For {{the heat}} pipe to {{transfer}} heat, it must contain saturated liquid and its vapor (gas phase). The saturated liquid vaporizes and {{travels to the}} condenser, where it is cooled {{and turned back to}} a saturated liquid.

Wick structures used in heat pipes include <b>sintered</b> <b>metal</b> powder, screen, and grooved wicks, which have a series of grooves parallel to the pipe axis. When the condenser is located above the evaporator in a gravitational field, gravity can return the liquid. In this case, the heat pipe is a thermosyphon.

40|$|AbstractThe {{construction}} of hybrid parts: comprised {{of two different}} materials or obtained by two distinct technological processes {{is one of the}} main advantages of laser <b>sintering</b> <b>metal.</b> Various important aspects strongly affect the mechanical properties of <b>sintering</b> <b>metal</b> components: porosity, surface roughness, scan speed, layer thickness, and residual stresses. A major drawback is the occurrence of pores originating from initial powder contaminations, evaporation or local voids after powder-layer deposition, once these pores can act as stress concentrators leading to failure, especially under fatigue loading. The purpose of present work was to study the effect scan speed on the porosity and mechanical properties. Also the performance of two different material parts was studied. The sintering laser parts were manufactured in maraging steel AISI 18 Ni 300, while the substrates of hybrid specimens were produced alternatively in two materials: the steel for hot work tools AISI H 13 and the stainless steel AISI 420. The results showed that a very high scan speed (400 or 600 mm/s) causes the appearance of high porosity percentages and consequent drastic reduction of tensile strength and stiffness. Tensile properties of sintered specimens and two different material parts was similar. However, the fatigue strength of two different material parts tends to decrease, for long lives, when compared with single sintered specimens...|$|R
40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} coated metal powders and to dispersions of such powders in liquid vehicles forming screenable, sinterable pastes {{for use in}} forming electrodes on photovoltaic devices. The primary nickel or copper metal particles are provided with a carrier of lower melting <b>sintering</b> <b>metals</b> such as 1 - 20 % by weight, of a non-oxidizing metal such as lead or tin. The powdered metal systems operate {{on the basis of}} fusing together by way of eutectic alloying. As the paste is heated during firing the organic binder is first vaporized. An eutectic of the base metal (copper) and coating (tin) forms at the intersections of the base metal grains. This eutectic dissolves the grains and as the temperature is raised above the eutectic temperature, more of the base metal is dissolved. While the temperature is held at the higher value, the much smaller amount of <b>sintering</b> <b>metal</b> disappears as the eutectic dissolves and diffuses into the base metal until the composition of the eutectic is so enriched with base metal that it no longer has the eutectic properties and it solidifies.
