2500|$|In December 1997, NASA {{approved}} {{an extended}} mission for Galileo {{known as the}} Galileo Europa Mission, which ran for two years {{following the end of}} the primary mission. The focus of this extended mission was to follow up on the discoveries made at Europa with seven additional flybys to search for new evidence of a possible <b>sub-surface</b> <b>water</b> ocean. Starting in May 1999, Galileo used four flybys (20 to 23) with Callisto to lower its periapse, setting up a chance for it to fly by Io twice in late 1999. During Galileos 21st orbit, it acquired a [...] of the anti-Jovian hemisphere (the [...] "far" [...] side of Io), its highest resolution observations of Io to date. This mosaic complemented the coverage obtained by Voyager 1, whose highest resolution observations covered Io's sub-Jovian hemisphere. Galileos two flybys in late 1999, on October 11 and November 26, provided high-resolution images and spectra of various volcanoes and mountains on Io's anti-Jovian hemisphere. The camera suffered a problem with an image mode used extensively during the first encounter, causing the majority of images taken to be highly degraded (though a software algorithm was developed to partially recover some of these images). NIMS also had problems due to the high-radiation environment near Io, suffering a hardware failure that limited the number of near-infrared wavelengths it sampled. Finally, the imaging coverage was limited by the low-data rate playback (forcing Galileo to transmit data from each encounter days to weeks later on the apoapse leg of each orbit), and by an incident when radiation forced a reset of the spacecraft's computer putting it into safe mode during the November 1999 encounter. Even so, Galileo fortuitously imaged an outburst eruption at Tvashtar Paterae during the November flyby, observing a curtain of lava fountains [...] long and [...] high. An additional encounter was performed on February 22, 2000. With no new errors with Galileo's remote sensing instruments, no safing events, and more time after the flyby before the next satellite encounter, Galileo was able to acquire and send back more data. This included information on the lava flow rate at Prometheus, Amirani, and Tvashtar, very high resolution imaging of Chaac Patera and layered terrain in Bulicame Regio, and mapping of the mountains and topography around Camaxtli Patera, Zal Patera, and Shamshu Patera.|$|E

40|$|Nematalosa vlaminghi (Perth herring) is an endemic, semi-anadromous {{fish species}} in {{estuaries}} {{on the lower}} west coast of Australia. It is known to spawn in {{the upper reaches of}} estuaries, which are prone to changing salinity profiles, stratification levels and water temperature, that are being altered through human disturbances and climate change. The aim {{of this study was to}} describe the development of eggs and larvae of N. vlaminghi and determine their distributions in the Upper Swan Estuary in relation to salinity, temperature and salinity stratification during January-February 2013 and December 2013 -January 2014. Throughout both sampling periods, 240 samples from 40 sites were collected from within the Upper Swan Estuary, an area of ~ 16 km, 31 km upstream from the estuary mouth. N. vlaminghi eggs are pelagic, spherical, 0. 98 - 1. 58 mm in diameter, semi-opaque to transparent, with a moderate yolk and one to three indistinct oil globules. Egg development stages identified included eggs at fertilisation, gastrulation, neuralation and late organogenesis. The early stage N. vlaminghi larvae (1. 78 - 3. 87 mm) are very elongate with a large residual yolksac, possess unpigmented embryonic eyes and lack a functional mouth. Early N. vlaminghi larvae rapidly developed pigmented embryonic eyes and a functional mouth. A. caudavittata eggs are pelagic spherical, 0. 56 - 0. 86 mm in diameter, transparent, with moderate yolk and a moderate distinct oil globule. A. caudavittata eggs were only found at embryogenesis milestones. Early stage A. caudavittata larvae (1. 46 - 2. 49 mm) are elongate with a moderate residual yolksac, possessing slightly pigmented eyes and a partially-formed functional mouth. Diel and depth differences in the distributions of eggs suggested that eggs were released in <b>sub-surface</b> <b>waters</b> at night and then floated to the surface before sinking to <b>sub-surface</b> <b>waters</b> prior to hatching during the day. Larvae were found mainly in <b>sub-surface</b> <b>waters.</b> Eggs and larvae were collected from ~ 36 to ~ 46 km from the estuary mouth, which was linked with salinities between ~ 8 - 19 PSU and a stratification index less than 1. 5. The abundances of N. vlaminghi eggs and larvae were positively correlated with salinity and negatively correlated with stratification. The distribution of eggs was more restricted than that of the larvae, which was attributed to the development and morphology of the larvae. Historically, the downstream limit of N. vlaminghi larvae was 26 compared to 36 km from the estuary mouth. The 10 km reduction of the distribution range in the current study is likely to be attributed to changes to the riverine flow [9. 4 x 108 m 3 (1999) vs. 1. 15 x 108 m 3 (2006) ] and salinity levels in the Upper Swan Estuary. This may increase egg and larval densities in the region, which could increase in mortality levels of these early life history stages and reduce recruitment of N. vlaminghi into the adult population...|$|R
5|$|Tropical {{cyclones}} usually require {{very warm}} water to depth, generally above 26.5°C (80°F) extending {{to a depth}} of 50meters (160ft). However, the waters off California are cold even in summer. They rarely rise above 24°C (75°F) in near-shore southern California, and usually remain below 17°C (63°F) along {{most of the rest of}} the coast and outer coastal waters, although El Niño events may warm the waters somewhat. This is due primarily to the extensive upwelling of colder <b>sub-surface</b> <b>waters</b> caused by the prevailing northwesterly winds acting through the Ekman Effect. The winds drive surface water to the right of the wind flow, that is offshore, which draws water up from below to replace it.

40|$|International audienceIn {{this study}} we report the {{distributions}} of total dissolvable cadmium and particulate cadmium from 27 stations in southern Moroccan coastal waters (22 - 30 °N) {{which is part of}} the North-West African upwelling system. These distributions were predominantly controlled by upwelling of the North Atlantic Central Waters (NACW) and uptake by primary production. Atmospheric inputs and phosphogypsum slurry inputs from the phosphate industry at Jorf Lasfar (33 °N), recently estimated as an important source of dissolved cadmium (240 tCd year− 1), are at best of minor importance for the studied waters. Our study provides new insights into the mechanisms fractionating cadmium from phosphate. In the upper 30 m, the anomalies observed in terms of Cd:P ratios in both the particulate and total dissolvable fractions were related to an overall preferential uptake of phosphate. We show that the type of phytoplanktonic assemblage (diatoms vs dinoflagellates) is also a determinant of the fractionation intensity.

Hence, we examined nitrification and nitrate reduction along with hydrographic and environmental parameters off Trivandrum and Kochi, south-west-India in June 2010. Shoaling isolines of temperature, density, and nutrients revealed the onset of upwelling off Trivandrum. Shoaling of these signatures was absent in the northern transect off Kochi. The degree of nutrient consumption (DNC) was low emphasizing the presence of newly upwelled water off Trivandrum. A significant increase in NRA (df = 1, p < 0. 05) was observed off Trivandrum than at Kochi. Moreover, as hypothesized, NRA at Trivandrum was pronounced at the surface with a maximum rate of 0. 85 (± 0. 02) µmol L- 1 h- 1 nearshore which was ~ 29 x higher than at Kochi. Further, an inverse relationship between NRA and NO 3 - concentration (n = 34, r =- 0. 415, p < 0. 01) suggested transformation of the upwelled nutrient.

Marine aerosols that contain viruses can travel hundreds of kilometers from their source and remain in liquid form as long as the humidity is high enough (over 70%).
