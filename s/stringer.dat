5|$|<b>Stringer</b> also struggles, {{having been}} cut off by Avon's drug {{suppliers}} and left with increasingly poor-quality product. He again goes behind Avon's back, giving up half of Avon's most prized territory to a rival named Proposition Joe {{in exchange for a}} share of his supply. Avon, unaware of the arrangement, assumes that Joe and other dealers are moving into his territory simply because the Barksdale organization has too few enforcers. He contracts a feared assassin named Brother Mouzone. <b>Stringer</b> deals with this by tricking his old adversary Omar into believing that Mouzone was responsible for the vicious killing of his partner in their feud in season one. Seeking revenge, Omar shoots Mouzone but, realizing <b>Stringer</b> has lied to him, calls 9-1-1. Mouzone recovers and leaves Baltimore, and <b>Stringer</b> (now with Avon's consent) is able to continue his arrangement with Proposition Joe.|$|E
5|$|The Major Crimes Unit {{learns that}} <b>Stringer</b> has been buying {{real estate and}} {{developing}} it to fulfill his dream of being a successful legitimate businessman. Believing that the bloody turf war with Marlo is poised to destroy everything the Barksdale crew had worked for, <b>Stringer</b> gives Major Colvin information on Avon's weapons stash. Brother Mouzone returns to Baltimore and tracks down Omar to join forces. Mouzone tells Avon that his shooting must be avenged. Avon, remembering how <b>Stringer</b> disregarded his order which resulted in Stringer's attempt to have Brother Mouzone killed, furious over D'Angelo's murder to which <b>Stringer</b> had confessed, and fearing Mouzone's ability to harm his reputation outside of Baltimore, informs Mouzone of Stringer's upcoming visit to his construction site. Mouzone and Omar corner him and shoot him to death.|$|E

40|$|The {{invention}} disclosed here is {{a method}} for forming and curing an intricate structure of criss-crossing composite <b>stringers</b> and frames that are bonded to a skin panel. A structure constructed {{in accordance with the}} invention would be well-suited for use as a portion of an aircraft fuselage, a boat hull, or the like. The method is preferably practiced by applying uncured composite <b>stringers</b> to an uncured composite sheet panel. This is followed by placing cured frames crosswise over the <b>stringers.</b> The frames have openings at the locations where they intersect with the <b>stringers</b> which enables the frames to come into direct contact with the skin along most of their length. During the forming and curing process, the <b>stringers</b> are covered with a plurality of cauls, and the entire assembly of skin panel, <b>stringers,</b> frames and cauls is subjected to a vacuum bagging and curing process. The cauls serve to maintain both part shape and to control the flow of resin within the <b>stringers</b> as they are cured. Further, they probably eliminate the need for intermediate protective materials between the vacuum bag and the <b>stringers...</b>|$|R

40|$|In 1998, Transportation Technology Center, Inc. (TTCI), a {{subsidiary}} of the Association of American Railroads, collaborated with Texas A&M University on a program of testing timber railroad bridge <b>stringers</b> as part of the AAR’s Bridge Life Extension program. Included in this effort were static and dynamic tests on southern pine; Douglas fir, and glued-laminated <b>stringers.</b> Despite the current trend of replacing timber bridges with steel, concrete, or culvert and fill, they still comprise about one-third the inventory of Class 1 railroads. On average, these bridges are more than 40 years old, and many are currently subjected to heavy axle load operation. Replacement of these bridges is gradual, with various measures being employed to extend their useful service lives. Although other components can also determine load capacity of a timber bridge, <b>stringers</b> are the main elements that carry bending loads.
