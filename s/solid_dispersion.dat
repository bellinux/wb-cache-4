50|$|<b>Solid</b> <b>dispersion</b> {{redox flow}} battery is one {{specific}} type of redox flow battery using dispersed solid active materials as the energy storage media. The solid suspensions are stored in energy storage tanks and pumped through electrochemical cells while charging or discharging. In comparison with a conventional redox flow battery where active species are dissolved in aqueous or organic electrolyte, the active materials in a <b>solid</b> <b>dispersion</b> redox flow battery maintain the solid form and are suspended in the electrolyte. The solid active materials, especially with active materials from lithium-ion battery, can help the suspensions achieve much higher energy densities than conventional redox flow batteries. This concept is similar to semi-solid flow batteries in which slurries of active materials accompanied by conductive carbon additives to facilitate electrons conducting are stored in energy storage tanks and pumped through the electrochemical reaction cells.|$|E
5000|$|In a {{semi-solid}} flow cell, {{the positive}} and negative electrodes are composed of particles suspended in a carrier liquid. The positive and negative suspensions are stored in separate tanks and pumped through separate pipes into a stack of adjacent reaction chambers, where they are separated by a barrier such as a thin, porous membrane. The approach combines the basic structure of aqueous-flow batteries, which use electrode material suspended in a liquid electrolyte, with the chemistry of lithium-ion batteries in both carbon-free suspensions and slurries with conductive carbon network. The carbon free semi-solid redox flow battery is also sometimes referred to as <b>Solid</b> <b>Dispersion</b> Redox Flow Battery. Dissolving a material changes its chemical behavior significantly. However, suspending bits of solid material preserves the solid's characteristics. The result is a viscous suspension that flows like molasses.|$|E
5000|$|MeltDose {{works by}} {{incorporating}} a drug substance with low water solubility into a [...] "meltable" [...] vehicle. It is then sprayed on an inert particulate carrier using fluid bed equipment. The melt is solidified when deposed on a particle carrier, and thus captures the active drug in a <b>solid</b> <b>dispersion</b> {{either as a}} solid solution or in a nano-crystalline state. The particle size is then increased by controlling and optimizing the product temperature and feed rate of the melt. The granulate can be directly compressed into tablets without additional processing steps besides blending with a lubricant. In addition, the technology allows for customization of the release profile. Once in tablet form, the dissolution profile and the particle size of drugs manufactured using MeltDose® technology remain stable allowing for a long shelf-life.|$|E
40|$|The basic {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to prepare and characterize <b>solid</b> <b>dispersions</b> of poorly water-soluble drug etoricoxib using lipid carriers by spray drying technique. The properties of <b>solid</b> <b>dispersions</b> were studied by diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), hotstage microscopy (HSM), radiograph powder diffraction (XRPD), and dissolution studies. The absence of etoricoxib peaks in XRPD profiles of <b>solid</b> <b>dispersions</b> suggests the transformation of crystalline etoricoxib into an amorphous form. In the HSM examination of <b>solid</b> <b>dispersions,</b> the dissolution of drug in the lipid carriers was observed, which was also confirmed by the absence of etoricoxib peak in DSC curves of <b>solid</b> <b>dispersions.</b> The DRIFTS spectra revealed the presence of hydrogen bonding in <b>solid</b> <b>dispersions.</b> The in vitro dissolution rate of <b>solid</b> <b>dispersions</b> as compared with pure etoricoxib, spray-dried etoricoxib, and physical mixtures of drug with lipid carriers.

This would allow understanding the phase behavior of these <b>solid</b> <b>dispersions</b> upon {{application of a}} different kind of stress (other than humidity and temperature) and ultimately lead to mechanistic perception of the phase changes taking place. Methods Miconazole and PVP VA 64 were chosen as a model drug and polymer, respectively and <b>solid</b> <b>dispersions</b> were prepared by spray drying. Dried <b>solid</b> <b>dispersions</b> were compressed using different compression pressure but constant dwell time. MDSC and XRPD were used to characterize and study the effect of compression on the system. Results The <b>solid</b> <b>dispersions</b> showed a single Tg till 20 % drug loading after which two Tg’s were observed. Application of compression to the phase separated 30 and 40 % compositions induced mixing resulting in only a single Tg. This reduction in number of Tg’s upon compression is a result of mixing which can be attributed to polymer flow resulting in reduction of the domain size of different phases in the <b>solid</b> <b>dispersions.</b> Conclusions Application of compression can influence the phase behavior of Miconazole-PVP VA 64 <b>solid</b> <b>dispersions.</b> This observation may have drastic impact on the formulation development approach for <b>solid</b> <b>dispersions</b> to be administered as tablets.

40|$|Bioavailability and {{clinical}} {{effectiveness of a}} poorly soluble drug can be highly affected by its formulation design. In this respect, research on <b>solid</b> <b>dispersion</b> of hydrophilic carrier has commenced a decade ago to resolve the problem of poorly soluble drug. However, the availability of <b>solid</b> <b>dispersion</b> is commercially limited due {{to the concerns of}} its physical instability, unpredictability and inconsistency formulation performance. This is attributed to the lack of fundamental understanding on the processing method, physicochemical properties of the obtained <b>solid</b> <b>dispersion.</b> Therefore, better understanding on the processing methods and factors underlying the performance of <b>solid</b> <b>dispersion</b> may be required to maximize the use of <b>solid</b> <b>dispersion.</b> Hot melt extrusion (HME) method was introduced in formulating <b>solid</b> <b>dispersion.</b> The use of this production method offers many advantages such as environmental friendly, cost sparing and readily scalable production as compared to conventional methods. On the other hand, the hydrophilic polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) polymer with its good stabilising ability in the <b>solid</b> <b>dispersion</b> is less applied in HME process due to its possible degradation at high temperature. However, rejection on the use of PVP without thorough understanding of its potential might lead to underuse of this polymer in HME <b>solid</b> <b>dispersion.</b> This project explores the feasibility of using PVP and its derivative in HME manufacturing method.

Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) revealed partially amorphous structures of the drug in <b>solid</b> <b>dispersion</b> granules. The <b>solid</b> <b>dispersion</b> granules dissolved completely within 30 min, which was much faster than that of pure drug baclofen. The sustained release of baclofen from the <b>solid</b> <b>dispersion</b> containing tablet was achieved for 2 h in gastric fluid (pH 1. 2) and for up to 10 h in intestinal fluid (pH 6. 8).

40|$|The aim {{of present}} work was {{to improve the}} {{solubility}} of a poor water soluble drug, cinnarizine, by using <b>solid</b> <b>dispersion</b> technique. Cinnarizine is a H 1 -receptor antagonist and widely used {{in the treatment of}} motion sickness, vomiting and vertigo. In the present work <b>solid</b> <b>dispersion</b> of cinnarizine were prepared with a polyethylene glycol 4000 and polyvinyl pyrrolidone K 30 by using solvent evaporation and fusion method in the 1 : 1, 1 : 2 and 1 : 3 ratio of drug and carrier respectively. <b>Solid</b> <b>dispersion</b> of cinnarizine was evaluated for drug content, Infrared spectroscopy and In vitro dissolution study. The <b>solid</b> <b>dispersion</b> with PEG and PVP exhibited enhanced dissolution rate of cinnarizine. IR spectra revealed no chemical incompatibility between drug and carrier.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the physical stability of <b>solid</b> <b>dispersions</b> of UC- 781 with PEG 6000, Gelucire 44 / 14 and PVP K 30 {{prepared by the}} solvent and melting methods. The concentration of the drug in the <b>solid</b> <b>dispersions</b> ranged from 5 to 80 % w/w. The <b>solid</b> <b>dispersions</b> were stored at 4 - 8 and 25 degrees C (25 % RH), then their physicochemical properties were analysed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), X-ray powder diffraction and dissolution studies {{as a function of}} storage time. The DSC curves of <b>solid</b> <b>dispersions</b> of UC- 781 with PVP K 30 did not show any melting peaks corresponding to UC- 781 after storage, indicating no recrystallization of the drug. The DSC data obtained from PEG 6000 and Gelucire 44 / 14 showed some variations in melting peak temperatures and enthalpy of fusion of the carriers. It was shown that the enthalpy of fusion of PEG 6000 in the dispersions increased after storage; it was more pronounced for samples stored at 25 degrees C compared to those at 4 - 8 degrees C indicating the reorganization of the crystalline domains of the polymer. Similarly, the enthalpy of fusion of Gelucire 44 / 14 in the <b>solid</b> <b>dispersions</b> increased as a function of time. Dissolution of UC- 781 from all <b>solid</b> <b>dispersions</b> decreased as a function of storage time. While these observations concurred with the DSC data for all <b>solid</b> <b>dispersions,</b> they were not reflected by X-ray powder diffraction data. It was concluded that it is the change of the physical state of the carriers and not that of the drug, which is responsible for the decreased dissolution properties of the <b>solid</b> <b>dispersions</b> investigated. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The aim {{of present}} {{investigation}} was to design and evaluate <b>solid</b> <b>dispersions</b> of Atorvastatin and Fenofibrate combination, to enhance the solubility and bioavailability. When used in combination, these drugs show additive beneficial effect and comparatively fewer side effects, {{in the treatment of}} Hyperlipidemia. Being members of BCS Class-II, these drugs exhibit low aqueous solubility and high permeability. The solubility of the above drug combination is increased by means of <b>solid</b> <b>dispersions</b> with PEG 4000 and PEG 6000 in different concentrations, using solvent evaporation method. The In-vitro release profiles of prepared <b>solid</b> <b>dispersions</b> were found to exhibit better dissolution characteristics compared to that of a branded market formulation, Atocor-F.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to develop a new fast-disintegrating tablet {{formulation}} containing 1 mg tacrolimus for sublingual application. First, <b>solid</b> <b>dispersions</b> containing tacrolimus (2. 5 %, 5 % and 10 % w/w) incorporated in Ac-Di-Sol®and carriers (inulin 1. 8 kDa and 4 kDa, and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) K 30) were prepared by freeze drying. Subsequently, a tablet formulation composed of a mixture of the <b>solid</b> <b>dispersions,</b> Ac-Di-Sol®, mannitol, Avicel®PH- 101 and sodium stearyl fumarate was optimized concerning drug load in the <b>solid</b> <b>dispersions</b> and the type of carrier. Tablet weight was kept constant at 75 mg by adjusting the amount of Avicel®PH- 101. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) results indicated the absence of the drug in the crystalline state, which was confirmed by the scanning electron microscopy (SEM). These results suggest that tacrolimus incorporated in all of the <b>solid</b> <b>dispersions</b> was fully amorphous. Dissolution of the tablets containing <b>solid</b> <b>dispersions</b> with a low drug load highly depends on the type of carrier and increased in the order: PVP K 30 <inulin 4 kDa <inulin 1. 8 kDa. <b>Solid</b> <b>dispersions</b> with a drug load of 10 % w/w incorporated in the carriers yielded optimal formulations. In addition, the physicochemical characteristics and the dissolution behavior of the tablet formulation containing inulin 1. 8 kDa-based <b>solid</b> <b>dispersions</b> with a drug load of 10 % w/w did not change after storage at 20 °C/ 45 %RH for 6 months indicating excellent storage stability. © 2012 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc...|$|R
40|$|<b>Solid</b> <b>dispersion</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{promising}} strategies to improve oral bioavailability of poorly soluble API. However, there are inconsistent dissolution performances of <b>solid</b> <b>dispersion</b> reported which entails further investigation. In this study, solid dispersions of ketoprofen in three hydrophilic carriers, i. e. PVP K 30, PVPVA 6 : 4 and PVA were prepared and characterized. Physical characterization of the physical mixture of ketoprofen and carriers shows certain extent of amorphization of the API. This result is coinciding to evaluation of drug–polymer interaction using ATR-FTIR whereby higher amorphization was seen in samples with higher drug–polymer interaction. XRPD scanning confirms that fully amorphous <b>solid</b> <b>dispersion</b> was obtained for SD KTP PVP K 30 and PVPVA system whereas partially crystalline system was obtained for SD KTP PVA. Interestingly, dissolution profiles of the <b>solid</b> <b>dispersion</b> had shown that degree of amorphization of KTP was not directly proportional to the dissolution rate enhancement of the <b>solid</b> <b>dispersion</b> system. Thus, it is concluded that complete amorphization does not guarantee dissolution enhancement of an amorphous <b>solid</b> <b>dispersion</b> system...|$|E

The {{purpose of the}} investigation poly was to obtain <b>solid</b> <b>dispersion</b> of phenylbutazone in the vehicle polyvinylpyrrolidone K- 30 which has superior dissolution rate dissolution medium. The <b>solid</b> <b>dispersion</b> of phenylbutazone in polyvinylpyrrolidone K- 30 was prepared by solvent method with various ratio (1 : 1, 1 : 2, 1 : 3, 1 : 4, and 1 : 5). the solid mass formed was passed by 100 -mesh sieve and 200 mesh sieve. The evaluation of <b>solid</b> <b>dispersion</b> phenylbutazone-polyvinylpyrrolidone K- 30 included the test of interference of vehicle on the absorption of phenylbutazone, thin layer chromatography, and infrared spectroscopic methods. The dissolution tes of <b>solid</b> <b>dispersion</b> of phenylbutazone-polyvinylpyrrolidone K- 30 was done by dissolution apparatus tes of USP type in HCL 0, 1 Nat temperature 37 + 0, 5 C using basket stirrer with agitation rate 100 rpm. The rel;eases of phenylbutazone in certain times were measured by uv-vis spectrophotometry at 230 nm wavelength, and the concentration determined with standard curve.
