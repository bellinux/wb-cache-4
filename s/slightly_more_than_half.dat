He compiled the first French grammar in the Serbian language (1805). He wrote in the so-called Slavo-Serbian language, a variant very close to the language of the people. Many Serbs subscribed to his publications, and he was, together with novelist Milovan Vidaković, one of the most widely read Serbian authors of his time. As such, he exercised a considerable influence on the broadening of the reading public among the Serbs. He seems to have also been among the first Serbian writers of travel books, for he began to write his first travel account as early as 1803, while touring Italy. His more important books of this kind are Travels in Serbia (1828) and Travels in Hungary, Wallachia, and Russia (1845).

The green triangle in Fig. 3 represents a measurement with SEQ- 6 R dosimeter with a Pb-shield directed upward for omitting the scattered radiation and leakage radiation coming from the collimator system. Additional measurements using this Pb-shielding downward (directed to the scatter coming from the PMMA slabs) indicated that both directions contribute more or less equally with a dose of 58 μGy for one CC exposure with 30  kV and 100 mAs.

40|$|Approximately 40 % of {{the deaths}} {{attributed}} to Hurricane Katrina in 2005 were caused by drowning. Blacks in the New Orleans area accounted for <b>slightly</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> one <b>half</b> of all deaths. Some of the drowning deaths were preventable. Too many black Americans {{do not know how}} to swim. Up to seventy percent of all black children in the United States have no or low ability to swim. Thus it is unsurprising that black youth between 5 and 19 are more likely to drown than white youths of the same age. The Centers for Disease Control concludes that a major factor explaining the difference in black and white drowning rates is the lack of swimming facilities for black youth. From the beginning of the swimming pool movement in the early 20 th century blacks had unequal access to these facilities, but the situation worsened in the 1950 s and 1960 s when efforts to integrate public pools resulted in wide-spread pool closures throughout the United States. Litigants relied on a variety of legal theories to gain access to public pools but the courts, including the Supreme Court, consistently ruled that local governments could close pools rather than operate them on an integrated basis. This article explains why the civil rights approach to swimming pool equality failed and argues that, given the established health benefits of swimming as an exercise, and how the lack of exercise opportunities is related to the growing obesity problems for which black communities are disproportionately at risk, any effort to achieve swimming pool equality should adopt a public health rather than a civil rights approach to remedy this problem...|$|R
