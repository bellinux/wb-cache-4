5|$|Love Among the Walnuts: or How I <b>Saved</b> <b>My</b> Family from Being Poisoned is a farcical, satirical {{young adult}} novel with fairy tale {{elements}} written by Jean Ferris. The story revolves around a young man, Sandy, whose family is poisoned by his scheming uncles {{in a bid}} to gain the family fortune. He moves them to Walnut Manor, a neighboring convalescent home, where, {{with the help of the}} nurse Sunnie, he tries to save his family and benefit the manor's misunderstood residents.|$|E

Shortly after he took off, while {{on his way to the}} gunnery range, he developed engine trouble and had to crash-land near the Hindenburg-Kattowitz railroad. He was killed in the crash.|$|E
5|$|Roughly speaking, Mongolian {{has eight}} cases: {{nominative}} (unmarked), genitive, dative, accusative, ablative, instrumental, comitative and directional. If a direct object is definite, it {{must take the}} accusative, while it must take the nominative if it is unspecific. In addition to case, a number of postpositions exist that usually govern genitive, ablative, or comitative case or a form of the nominative that has sometimes -Vn either for lexical historical reasons or analogy (thus maybe becoming an attributive case suffix). Nouns can take reflexive-possessive clitics indicating that the marked noun is possessed by {{the subject of the}} sentence: bi najz(-)aa avarsan I friend- save- 'I <b>saved</b> <b>my</b> friend'. However, there are also somewhat noun-like adjectives to which case suffixes seemingly cannot be attached directly unless there is ellipsis. Plurality may be left unmarked, but there are overt plurality markers, some of which are restricted to humans. A noun that is modified by a numeral usually does not take any plural affix.|$|E

[...] Nixon preferred to call the address [...] "the Fund speech," [...] and made it required reading for his speechwriters. As time passed, the Checkers speech became denigrated, and Nixon biographer Earl Mazo suggested that much of the attitude of [...] "I don't like Nixon, but I don't know why," [...] which contributed to the failure of his 1960 presidential run, can be traced to the Checkers speech. Other commentators suggested that had he not made the Checkers speech, Nixon might have won in 1960. Nixon retorted that without the Checkers speech, he would not have been around to run in 1960.|$|E

Frank credited Judy with saving his life during his time spent there, [...] "She <b>saved</b> <b>my</b> life in so many ways. The greatest way of all was giving me a reason to live.

[...] A radarman named Tom Scott later wrote that Frank and Judy shared an unusual bond, with Frank able to send the dog into the jungle with a click and recall her with a whistle. On one occasion, Frank found Judy attempting to bury an elephant's leg bone.|$|E
500|$|Saban {{was named}} {{head coach of}} the Bills for a second time in late 1971. When he arrived, Buffalo was coming off a 1–13 season, {{although}} the team had players including running back O.J. Simpson, who had run for 742 yards and five touchdowns that year. While the Bills had a 4–9–1 record, Simpson led the NFL in rushing yards in 1972. Under Saban, Simpson continued to improve in 1973, setting a single-game rushing record with 250 yards in the season opener against the New England Patriots. He surpassed the single-season rushing record later in the year with more than 2,000 yards. Before Saban's arrival, Simpson had never rushed for more than 742 yards in a season. Simpson credited Saban with helping him reach his potential. [...] "He <b>saved</b> <b>my</b> career", Simpson said in 1973, when he was named the NFL's most valuable player. [...] "He promised me he'd give me the football and give me an offensive line, and he sure kept his word."

[...] "I Couldn't Keep It to Myself" [...] features lush strings and electric piano, which according to one writer [...] "create a jaunty atmosphere that harkens back to early Kool and the Gang and the Blackbyrds." [...] Its narrator wants to brag to his friends about his new girlfriend's sexual abilities. [...] "Gangsta Groove" [...] adapts hip hop's [...] "" [...] trope in a humane story, compared by one writer to a blaxploitation theme. It draws on the funk music of Parliament-Funkadelic, Cameo, and the Ohio Players. [...] "Tonyies! In the Wrong Key" [...] features a dreamy, dissonant soundscape, slurred vocals, swirling horns, and a James Brown sample. At its end, Raphael Wiggins sings the line [...] "last night a DJ <b>saved</b> <b>my</b> life", {{a reference to the}} 1982 song of the same name. Wiggins found his [...] "disinterested" [...] vocal style similar to Sly Stone's [...] "Family Affair" [...] (1971).|$|E
