Her health deteriorated after Stephen's birth, and she had a hysterectomy. Her aunt Phyl took care of the children while she recovered. In 1955, her husband, unable to reconcile his lifestyle with his homosexuality, returned to the United States, and she became a single mother. She returned to work, initially in a biscuit factory, and then in a series of clerical jobs.|$|E
5|$|They were {{obliged to}} record their first album at EMI's Abbey Road Studios in London, overseen by {{producer}} Norman Smith, a central figure in Pink Floyd's negotiations with EMI. Balance engineer Pete Bown, who had mentored Smith, helped ensure that the album had a unique sound, through his experimentation with equipment and recording techniques. Bown, assisted by <b>studio</b> <b>manager</b> David Harris, set up microphones {{an hour before the}} sessions began. Bown's microphone choices were mostly different from those used by Smith to record the Beatles' EMI sessions. Because of Barrett's quiet voice, he was placed in a vocal isolation booth to sing his parts. Automatic double tracking (ADT) was used to add layers of echo to the vocals and to some instruments. The album featured an unusually heavy use of echo and reverberation to give it its own unique sound. Much of the reverberation effect came from a set of Elektro-Mess-Technik plate reverberators– customised EMT 140s containing thin metal plates under tension– and the studio's tiled echo chamber built in 1931.|$|E

25|$|From {{inception}} {{for over}} 20 years, Radio 1 broadcast from an adjacent pair of continuity suites (originally Con A and Con B) {{in the main}} control room of Broadcasting House. These cons were configured to allow DJs to operate the equipment themselves and play their own records and jingle cartridges (called self-op). This was a departure from traditional BBC practice, where a <b>studio</b> <b>manager</b> would play in discs from the studio control cubicle. Due to needle time restrictions, much of the music was played from tapes of BBC session recordings. The DJs were assisted {{by one or more}} technical operators (TOs) who would set up tapes and control sound levels during broadcasts.|$|E

Charles Beale was a Civil Service Clerk at the time, but eventually became Mary's <b>studio</b> <b>manager</b> once she became a professional painter. At some point, Charles was working for the Board of Green Cloth where he mixed colour pigments. Throughout their marriage, Mary and Charles worked together as equals and as business partners, which was not often seen at the time. On 18 October 1654 Charles and Mary's first son, Bartholomew, was buried. Little else is known about their first son. Their second son was baptized on 14 February 1655/6 and also named Bartholomew.

500|$|Harrison began {{sessions}} for his Living in the Material World album in October 1972, at Apple Studio in London. As {{a result of}} the problems associated with the Bangladesh project, author Peter Doggett writes, [...] "verything connected with the physical world seemed to annoy him." [...] The <b>studio</b> <b>manager</b> at the time, former Beatles engineer Geoff Emerick, recalls Harrison wearing his Hindu prayer bag and [...] "mumbling away, chanting his mantra", often unable to reply to questions put to him. As for all the tracks on the album, the recording engineer on [...] "The Lord Loves the One (That Loves the Lord)" [...] was Phil McDonald, who had also worked in that capacity for the Beatles.|$|E
500|$|The song {{begins with}} [...] "a startling machine-gun fuzz guitar riff", with Lennon and Harrison's guitars {{prominent}} throughout the track. The distorted guitar sound {{was achieved by}} direct injection of the guitar signal into the mixing console. Emerick later explained that he routed the signal through two microphone preamplifiers in series while keeping the amount of overload just below the point of overheating the console. This was such a severe abuse of the studio equipment that Emerick thought, [...] "If I was the <b>studio</b> <b>manager</b> and saw this going on, I'd fire myself." [...] Lennon overdubbed the opening scream, and double-tracked {{some of the words}} [...] "so roughly that its careless spontaneity becomes a point in itself", according to author Ian MacDonald.|$|E

500|$|Phantasmagoria was Sierra's {{first game}} to use live actors {{integrated}} with computer-generated backgrounds. About 600 scenes were filmed for the game. The total filming took about four months, 12 hours a day, shooting {{six days a}} week. More than 200 people were ultimately involved {{in the making of}} the game. A total of $800,000 was originally budgeted for Phantasmagoria, but it ended up costing $4.5 million. The budget issues caused some friction between Roberta and Ken Williams. It was the first game made in a new filming studio built by Sierra in Oakhurst, California, the same location as Sierra's headquarters. It cost $1.5 million to build and was overseen by <b>studio</b> <b>manager</b> Bill Crow, who said, [...] "Phantasmagoria essentially started with the design and creation of the studio". Sierra also developed computerized tools specifically to manage the shooting process, including software to digitize the video into the computer. Some of the software was built as the game was being made and as the need for new tools were being identified.|$|E
500|$|Rare {{unveiled}} {{their work}} on Xbox Live avatars, [...] (the next instalment in the Viva Piñata [...] series), and [...] in 2008. Made by the core team that developed the first Banjo-Kazooie, [...] Nuts & Bolts received significant criticism from players due to its focus on vehicle construction rather than traditional platforming. Despite generally positive reviews, the company's titles for Microsoft sold poorly and Microsoft decided to restructure the studio {{at the end of}} the decade. In March 2010 Rare opened a new facility at Fazeley Studios in Digbeth, Birmingham. Later that year Microsoft confirmed that Scott Henson, a developer who had worked on the hardware and software designs of the Xbox 360 console and Kinect for Xbox 360, replaced Mark Betteridge as <b>studio</b> <b>manager</b> and announced a focus on Xbox Live avatars. Rare also shifted their focus to Kinect. According to Henson, [...] "Kinect will be the main focus for Rare going forwards as it's a very rich canvas. This is just the beginning of an experience that will touch millions of people". Rare's first Kinect project, Kinect Sports, was released in November 2010. Originally titled Sports Star, a more-complex sports simulation games, the game was streamlined into what Microsoft executive Don Mattrick hoped would be the Kinect equivalent of Wii Sports. According to a former Rare employee, the team was worried about the game during its development because of Kinect's limitations. Despite average reviews it was a commercial success, selling three million units by May 2011. Many non-Kinect teams at Rare and BigPark, another Microsoft studio, collaborated on the development of sequel [...] Combining with the sales of the first Kinect Sports, the game sold more than 8 million copies.|$|E

50|$|The precise {{nature of}} a <b>studio</b> <b>manager's</b> work will depend upon {{the nature of their}} deployment, but the core {{function}} is usually to ensure the programme is correctly 'balanced'.

Monty Python members Terry Jones and John Cleese also lent their voice to characters in the game. Jones, a longtime friend of Adams, provided the voice of the parrot, while Cleese (who is credited as [...] "Kim Bread") voiced the bomb. Actor Philip Pope was also involved, having voiced the Mâitre d'Bot. Adams himself also did voice acting for the game, voicing the Succ-U-Bus and Leovinus.|$|E
2500|$|Big Boi {{had already}} {{recorded}} some songs when André 3000 had contacted him, but after their conversation he decided his next project would be Speakerboxxx. Describing his {{approach in the}} studio, Big Boi later commented to XXL, [...] "the idea was just to keep it funky, keep it jamming, it's always bass-heavy. And lyricism, it's all about lyrics, taking pride in your pen and your pad." [...] His favorite song to record was [...] "Unhappy". He spent several days working on [...] "Unhappy"'s hook before driving to his mother's home and playing the song in her driveway, to which she responded enthusiastically. At {{some point in the}} recording, the project moved to OutKast's Stankonia Studios in downtown Atlanta, which had been used to record OutKast's previous release and namesake. John Frye, the <b>studio</b> <b>manager</b> and an engineer, would later recognise that much of the media attention surrounding the album's recording was concerned with André 3000 and Big Boi's working relationship and why they had chosen to record separately. He concedes that both enjoyed working solo and were doing so more frequently, but they continued to share and critique each other's music.|$|E
2500|$|The {{gameplay}} of Tomb Raider {{is primarily}} based around an action-adventure framework, with Lara navigating environments and solving mechanical and environmental puzzles, {{in addition to}} fighting enemies and avoiding traps. These puzzles, primarily set within ancient tombs and temples, can extend across multiple rooms and areas within a level. Lara could also swim through water, a rarity in games {{at the time that}} has continued through the series. According to original software engineer and later <b>studio</b> <b>manager</b> Gavin Rummery, the original set-up of interlinking rooms was inspired by Egyptian multi-roomed tombs, particularly the tomb of Tutankhamun. The feel of the gameplay was intended to evoke that of the 1989 video game Prince of Persia. In the original games, Lara utilised a [...] "tank" [...] control set-up, with two buttons pushing her forward and back and two buttons steering her left and right, and in combat Lara automatically locked onto enemies when they came within range. The camera automatically adjusts depending on Lara's action, but defaults to a third-person perspective in most instances. This basic formula remained unchanged through the first series of games. Angel of Darkness also added stealth elements.|$|E

Apple <b>Studio's</b> <b>manager,</b> Geoff Emerick, recalls of the extended sessions for the Van Eatons' debut album: [...] "their problem was that they couldn't match {{the feel of the}} demonstration tape that had gotten them their record deal in the first place. It's actually a common enough occurrence - in recording studio parlance, it's a phenomenon known as 'chasing the demo.'" [...] Thereafter John Mills took over as recording and mixing engineer.|$|R
