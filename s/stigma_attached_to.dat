5|$|In June 1945, Bradman faced a {{financial}} crisis when the firm of Harry Hodgetts collapsed due to fraud and embezzlement. Bradman moved quickly to set up his own business, utilising Hodgetts' client list and his old office in Grenfell Street, Adelaide. The fallout led to a prison term for Hodgetts, and left a <b>stigma</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> Bradman's name in the city's business community for many years.|$|E

The <b>stigma</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> the bay due to reports of pollution has discouraged fishing, enabling a healthy population to develop.|$|E
5|$|For many years, Adrian Boult {{had been}} {{a close friend of}} Wilson and his first wife Ann, née Bowles. When, in the late 1920s, Wilson began to mistreat his wife, Boult took her side. She {{divorced}} Wilson on grounds of cruelty in 1931, and married Boult two years later. The enmity provoked in Wilson was to have lasting repercussions. The <b>stigma</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> divorce in Britain in the 1930s affected Wilson's career: he was barred from performing in English cathedrals at the Three Choirs Festival for 25 years until 1957, when he narrated Honegger's King David in Worcester, by which time his singing career had ended.|$|E
50|$|Inflorescences (in {{the form}} of spikes) are terminal, {{opposite}} the leaves, or located in the axils. Flowers are bisexual, with no perianth, each flower is subtended by a peltate bract. Stamens are 2-6, and hypogynous, with 2-locular anthers. There are usually 3-4 <b>stigmas</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> a single pistil per flower, which is 1 or 3-4 carpellate. The ovary is 1 locular, and superior.|$|R

It attempts to reveal some of the social factors associated with avoidance reactions toward recuperat-ing patients, and to indicate some {{of the ways in which}} these reactions may affect post-hospital adjustment. Both lay and professional observers have pointed out that a lingering social <b>stigma</b> <b>attaches</b> <b>to</b> newly discharged patients, and that consequently their social relations often are characterized by social distance, distrust or denia...|$|R
5|$|For many years, Boult {{had been}} {{a close friend of}} the tenor Steuart Wilson and his wife Ann, née Bowles. When, in the late 1920s, Wilson began to mistreat his wife, Boult took her side. She {{divorced}} Wilson in 1931. In 1933, Boult astonished those who knew his notorious shyness with women by marrying her and becoming a much-loved stepfather to her four children; the marriage lasted {{for the rest of his}} life. The enmity it provoked in Wilson had repercussions in Boult's later career. The <b>stigma</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> divorce in Britain in the 1930s affected Wilson's career but not Boult's: Wilson was barred from performing in English cathedrals at the Three Choirs Festival but Boult was invited to conduct the orchestra at Westminster Abbey for the coronation of George VI in 1937.|$|E
5|$|Erin Ryan and {{her colleagues}} {{performed}} a 2009 study {{on the effect of}} the use of American Sign Language (ASL) in Blue's Clues episodes. They analyzed 16 episodes over two weeks for the content and frequency of the signs used and found a high incidence of ASL usage by various characters, but that it was inconsistent, especially in the connection between English words and their corresponding signs. The purpose of signed communication and its connection with ASL and the Deaf community was not clearly explained, either. The researchers speculated that hearing children with no previous ASL exposure would be familiarized with ASL and the deaf by these episodes, thus reducing the <b>stigma</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> deafness and hard of hearing individuals. Based on other research about the positive effects of teaching ASL to hearing children, the researchers also speculated that it could lead to an increase of vocabulary skills and IQ, as well as improve interpersonal communication. They surmised that deaf children would feel more included and less isolated and be provided with the opportunity to view positive models of ASL and deaf people.|$|E
5|$|Not {{only was}} there little social <b>stigma</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> {{smuggling}} in the colonies, but in port cities, where trade {{was the primary}} generator of wealth, smuggling enjoyed considerable community support, and it was even possible to obtain insurance against being caught. Colonial merchants developed an impressive repertoire of evasive maneuvers to conceal the origin, nationality, routes and content of their illicit cargoes. This included the frequent use of fraudulent paperwork to make the cargo appear legal and authorised. And much to the frustration of the British authorities, when seizures did happen local merchants were often able to use sympathetic provincial courts to reclaim confiscated goods and have their cases dismissed. For instance, Edward Randolph, the appointed head of customs in New England brought 36 seizures to trial from 1680 {{to the end of}} 1682 – and all but two of these were acquitted. Alternatively merchants sometimes took {{matters into their own hands}} and stole illicit goods back while impounded.|$|E
50|$|Children {{whose parents}} were not married {{at the time they}} were {{conceived}} or born were historically discriminated against in a range of ways. This, the court held, was particularly true of children whose lives were governed by common law. Although much of the <b>stigma</b> <b>attaching</b> <b>to</b> extra-marital children was social and religious rather than legal in origin, that stigma was nevertheless deeply harmful. For example, extra-marital sons had reduced rights of inheritance under customary law, being able to inherit only {{in the absence of any}} other male descendants.|$|R
50|$|Pinnock {{has always}} had a passion for poetry and has put {{together}} a book of poetry which includes pieces that raise awareness of the <b>stigmas</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> mental health and depression, drawing upon his own experiences of depression and his relationship with the mental health charity, Mind UK. The book is as yet untitled and is due for release next autumn, which will accompany a series of three poetry short films, directed by Pinnock and his co-director Gary Wallis, and currently in pre-production with his production company, Big Smile Pictures.|$|R
50|$|The New World Afro-diasporic {{religion}} of Vodou is also practiced. Vodou encompasses several different traditions, {{and consists of}} a mix encompassing African, European and indigenous Taíno religious elements. In this way, it {{is very similar to}} other Latin American syncretist movements, such as the Cuban Santería. It is more widespread in rural parts of the country, partly due <b>to</b> negative <b>stigmas</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> its practice. During the season of Lent, Vodou societies create parading musical bands for a festival called Rara, and fulfill religious obligations in local spaces such as streams, rivers, trees.|$|R

25|$|In {{common with}} many other Polynesian societies, Ancient Tonga also made room for the male transgender, fakafefine. These men wore female clothing, took on female roles, and had casual sexual {{liaisons}} with other men.

This paper utilizes a symbolic interaction theoretical perspective to outline communicative alternatives to polypharmacy. There is a growing interest in sociological interventions to untangle the “disordered discourses” associated {{with dementia}}. Such practices challenge common <b>stigmas</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> dementia as an “ongoing funeral” or “death certificate. ” Changing the expectations, attitudes and communication patterns of family care partners can positively impact them and the person living with dementia {{at the end of}} life.

40|$|This thesis aims {{to examine}} {{the extent to which}} the {{vocabulary}} of acting created by Konstantin Stanislavski is recognized in contemporary American practice as well as the associations with the Stanislavski ‘system’ held by modern actors in the United States. During the research, a two-part survey was conducted examining the actor’s processes while creating a role for the stage and their exposure to Stanislavski and his written works. A comparison of the data explores the contemporary American understanding of the elements of the ‘system’ as well as the disconnect between the use of these elements and the <b>stigmas</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> Stanislavski or his ‘system’ in light of misconceptions or prejudices toward either...|$|R
40|$|Shakespeare {{uses the}} idea of {{bankruptcy}} in several of his plays and poems. At the time, bankrupts were regarded with much suspicion, they were vilified and labelled frauds, and bankruptcy was possible for traders only. This article considers {{the relationship between the}} early English bankruptcy Acts and current Australian law and examines how Shakespeare used {{the idea of}} bankruptcy, including the <b>stigma</b> <b>attaching</b> <b>to</b> bankruptcy, to both reflect, and influence, contemporary perceptions, and how his influence in relation to the idea of bankruptcy is still observable today. Through imagery and metaphor he created a persona for bankruptcy removed from its statutory housing, freeing it to inform moods, emotions, longings and sympathies. 19 page(s...|$|R

Some traditionalists have embraced the labels reactionary and counterrevolutionary, defying the <b>stigma</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> these terms since the Enlightenment.|$|E

40|$|While stigma {{has often}} been implicated in the low take-up of benefits, its {{aetiology}} is not well understood. Drawing distinctions from earlier research, notably differentiating personal, social and institutional stigma, the article explores how each is {{related to each other}} and how each alone, and in concert, is framed by political and local culture. As case-studies, two of the world’s largest social assistance schemes, Dibao and Wubao, are compared in a village in south central China based on ethnographic work with recipients, village cadre charged with implementing both schemes, and non-recipients. In explaining the reasons for the very different level of <b>stigma</b> <b>attaching</b> <b>to</b> each scheme, the article unearths processes of salience to academics and policymakers...|$|R

In an article for Australian Folklore, Opala states [...] "Even though decommissioned, some institutions however {{continue to be a}} focus for 'myths and legends.' Among such Peel Island remains both source and object of its folklore". She expressed great empathy for the patients as she wrote about the impact of isolation on the island and the <b>stigmas</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> patients. Opala has suggested that the Queensland Health Department's decision to isolate patients in order to allay public anxiety, had an opposite effect as the perception was that Hansen's disease was far worse than it is.|$|R
