40|$|The {{concept of}} {{capacity}} {{and level of}} service {{are central to the}} analysis of intersections, as they are for all types of facilities. Both capacity and level of service must be fully considered to evaluate the overall operation of the intersections. The objectives of the present study include the analysis, evaluation level of <b>service</b> and <b>traffic</b> <b>operation</b> of Al- Abasse intersection in the CBD of Fallujah city. Al-Abbasi congested intersection which is located the CBD area of Fallujah are selected to achieve the objectives of the present study. The required traffic and geometrical data gathered manually to estimate the distribution of traffic in different directions. (HCS 2000) program are used for the requirements of traffic analysis process. It has concluded that the second proposal (construct flyover along New street toward Al – Kamaleat intersection) for the mentioned intersections is necessary to enhance the level of <b>service</b> and the <b>traffic</b> <b>operation</b> at Al – Abasse intersection in CBD of Fallujah city...|$|R

40|$|Rises in {{the number}} of transit buses, bus routes, and overall traffic volume in China’s cities, coupled with {{interference}} from other transport modes, such as taxis loading and unloading passengers nearby, have led to increasing traffic delays at bus stops, which {{is considered one of the}} factors degrading <b>service</b> levels and <b>traffic</b> <b>operations</b> on urban roadways. This paper studies traffic characteristics at bus stops, investigates variations in delay from different types or designs of bus stops, and analyzes the impact of it on traffic capacity, the purpose of which is to propose a solution to predicting the feasibility of an integrated design of bus stops and taxi stands with the help of mathematical models and based on the objectives of optimal <b>traffic</b> <b>operations</b> and passenger transfer...|$|R

Of the participating organizations only five (17 %) organizations provided <b>traffic</b> <b>services</b> including <b>traffic</b> control improvements, signal timing, and collection of traffic data.

40|$|With GPRS and UMTS {{networks}} lunched, wireless multimedia {{services are}} commercially becoming {{the most attractive}} applications next to voice. Because {{of the nature of}} bursty, packet-switched schemes and multiple data rates, the traditional Erlang approach and Poisson models for characterising voice-centric <b>services</b> <b>traffic</b> are not suitable for studying wireless multimedia <b>services</b> <b>traffic.</b> Therefore, research on the characterisation of wireless multimedia <b>services</b> <b>traffic</b> is very challenging. The typical reference for the study of wireless multimedia <b>services</b> <b>traffic</b> is wired Internet <b>services</b> <b>traffic.</b> However, because of the differences in network protocol, bandwidth, and QoS requirements between wired and wireless <b>services,</b> their <b>traffic</b> characterisations may not be similar. Wired network Internet traffic shows self-similarity, long-range dependence and its file sizes exhibit heavy-tailedness.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to inform traffic {{engineers}} about the power and flexibility that VISSIM offers in analyzing roundabouts. Typically, traffic engineers use “static ” analysis software (such as aaSIDRA) to analyze the expected <b>traffic</b> <b>operations</b> at roundabouts. There are certain projects, however, where traffic simulation should be considered to assess the <b>traffic</b> <b>operations</b> of roundabout alternatives. The “static ” software packages can only analyze individual intersections as independent entities and thus ignore the system impacts of roundabouts. Traffic simulation is increasingly being used to assess <b>traffic</b> <b>operations</b> along many different types of roadway networks. From highways to arterial streets, traffic simulation enables the engineer as well as the public to visualize <b>traffic</b> <b>operations.</b> Roundabouts, however, have unique operational characteristics that some existing simulation packages do not currently model very well. VISSIM has considerable flexibility and can simulate many of these characteristics. HDR recently used VISSIM to analyze <b>traffic</b> <b>operations</b> for two very different roundabout projects. The first project included the analysis of six proposed two-lane roundabouts alon...|$|R

40|$|With {{increasing}} emphasis {{being placed}} on optimising {{the operation of the}} existing road network and additional pressure on funding, transport agencies are moving towards system engineering and asset management techniques to make more informed and uniform decisions across their networks. Infrastructure capital and maintenance systems are relatively mature, but for new technology such as Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) and <b>traffic</b> <b>operation</b> <b>services,</b> information and procedures to make decisions are not as advanced. ITS and <b>traffic</b> <b>operation</b> <b>services</b> are deployed to enhance the operations of the road network and can include devices, communications, software, policies, guidelines and processes. In some instances ITS and <b>traffic</b> <b>operation</b> <b>services</b> can offer more cost effective solutions to transport and traffic problems than traditional infrastructure solutions, and therefore must be considered in into strategic decision-making. To ensure funding is directed to maximise community and agency objectives, a strategic, quantitative evaluation framework to prioritise <b>traffic</b> <b>operation</b> and ITS investment according to need and performance is necessary. The analytical framework must take into account traffic performance and customer and agency needs to inform realistic and affordable <b>traffic</b> <b>operations</b> and incident management intervention decisions.

By evaluating the following four indexes: link delay, queue length, link average speed and passing vehicles, the simulation results indicate that the improving effect of following control strategy is superior to the underutilizing control strategy. Implementing comprehensive waiting area and in conjunction with the following control strategy can improve <b>traffic</b> <b>operation</b> when <b>traffic</b> volume is larger than the surveyed situation volume while the improvement is more effectively when traffic volume continues to increase.
