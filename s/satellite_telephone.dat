5|$|Two days later, on 31 August, five of {{the eleven}} hostages were {{released}} {{in exchange for a}} <b>satellite</b> <b>telephone</b> and medical supplies. The West Side Boys had originally decided to release the married men, but changed their minds at the last minute and released the three rangers and two of the corporals. The West Side Boys told the British negotiators that the officers and other NCOs would not be released until the gang's remaining demands were met. The released soldiers were flown for debriefing to RFA Sir Percivale, of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary, off the coast.|$|E

25|$|N-STAR a was {{successfully}} launched aboard an Ariane 44P on August 29, 1995. Its twin, N-STAR b, launched on February 5, 1996, also aboard an Ariane 44P. The <b>satellite</b> <b>telephone</b> service was operational in March 1996. On March 2000, the packet communications service was introduced.

25|$|Data {{access to}} the station is {{provided}} by access via NASA's TDRS-4, 5, and 6 satellites, the DOD DSCS-3 satellite, and the commercial Iridium satellite constellation. For the 2007–2008 season, the TDRS relay (named South Pole TDRSS Relay or SPTR) was upgraded to support a data return rate of 50 Mbit/s, which comprises over 90% of the data return capability. The TDRS-1 satellite formerly provided services to the station, but it failed in October 2009 and was subsequently decommissioned. Marisat and LES9 were also formerly used. In July 2016, the GOES-3 satellite was decommissioned due to it {{nearing the end of}} its supply of propellant and was replaced by the use of the DSCS-3 satellite, a military communications satellite. DSCS-3 can provide a 30 MB/s data rate compared to GOES-3's 1.5 MB/s. DSCS-3 and TDRS-4, 5, and 6 are used together to provide the main communications capability for the station. These satellites provide the data uplink for the station's scientific data as well as provide broadband internet and telecommunications access. Only during the main satellite events is the station's telephone system able to dial out. The commercial Iridium satellite is used when the TDRS and DSCS satellites are all out of range to give the station limited communications capability during those times. During those times, telephone calls may only be made on several Iridium <b>satellite</b> <b>telephone</b> sets owned by the station. The station's IT system also has a limited data uplink over the Iridium network, which allows emails less than 100KB to be sent and received at all times and small critical data files to be transmitted. This uplink works by bonding the data stream over 12 voice channels.|$|E

50|$|Even though older {{communication}} methods like radio {{are still}} used, {{the revolution in}} communication technology over the past 10-15 years has dramatically changed how terrorist organizations communicate.
