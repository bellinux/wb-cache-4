50|$|The {{payload module}} also held a conical <b>sun</b> <b>shade,</b> to prevent stray light from {{reaching}} the telescope, and two large star trackers.

It consisted of Sun and Earth sensors, the before-mentioned star trackers, a quadrant star sensor on the telescope axis, gyroscopes and reaction wheels. A complementary reaction control system (RCS), using hydrazine propellant, was responsible for orbital direction and finetuning shortly after launch.
