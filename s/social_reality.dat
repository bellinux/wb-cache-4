5|$|Within {{attachment}} theory, Bowlby, in Attachment and Loss, volume one of Attachment (1969), {{makes it}} quite clear that infants become attached to carers who are sensitive and responsive in their social interactions with them and that this {{does not have to}} be the mother or indeed a female. As a matter of <b>social</b> <b>reality</b> mothers are more often the primary carers of children and therefore are more likely to be the primary attachment figure, but the process of attachment applies to any carer and infants develop a number of attachments according to who relates to them and the intensity of the engagement. However, attachment theory relates to the development of attachment behaviours and relationships after about 7 months of age and there are other theories and research relating to earlier carer–infant interactions.|$|E
5|$|The 19th {{century was}} a {{turbulent}} time for Spain. Those {{in favour of}} reforming Spain's government vied for political power with conservatives, who tried to prevent reforms from taking place. Some liberals, in a tradition that had started with the Spanish Constitution of 1812, sought to limit {{the power of the}} monarchy of Spain and to establish a liberal state. The reforms of 1812 did not last after King Ferdinand VII dissolved the Constitution and ended a short-lived liberal government with French royalist military assistance. Twelve successful coups were carried out between 1814 and 1874. There were several attempts to realign the political system to match <b>social</b> <b>reality.</b> Until the 1850s, the economy of Spain was primarily based on agriculture. There was little development of a bourgeois industrial or commercial class. The land-based oligarchy remained powerful; a small number of people held large estates (called latifundia) as well as all the important government positions. The landowners' power was challenged by the industrial and merchant sectors, largely unsuccessfully.|$|E

5|$|The bill's passage was {{met with}} concern by Catholic authorities, {{including}} Pope John Paul II — who warned of a weakening of family values — and his successor Pope Benedict XVI. Cardinal López Trujillo, president of the Pontifical Council for the Family, said the Church was making an urgent call for freedom of conscience for Catholics and appealing to them to resist the law. He said every profession linked with implementing same-sex marriages should oppose it, {{even if it meant}} losing their jobs. Gay rights supporters argued that while the Catholic Church also formally opposed opposite-sex, non-religious marriage, its opposition was not as vocal; for example, the Church did not object to the marriage of Prince Felipe to Letizia Ortiz, who had divorced from a previous civil marriage. The church was unable to gather enough support to derail the bill, even though 80% of Spaniards identify as members of the Catholic Faith. Sociologists believe {{this may be due to}} the significant increase of liberalism in the realm of individual rights in recent years, where the Church traditionally had most influence, especially on family issues. A poll showed that three quarters of Spaniards believe the church hierarchy is out of touch with <b>social</b> <b>reality.</b> A complementary explanation might be that the Church's influence on Spaniards declined after the death in 1975 of the dictator General Francisco Franco, whose regime was closely linked to the Church.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- The {{success of}} a film {{in recent years has}} been largely {{dependent}} on the marketing of the film. Since cinema has always had a profound influence on the lives of people, being a larger than life media, film makers go the extra mile to woo the audience. Be it sci-fi, love stories, action dramas or family sagas, the marketing of the package is very important. Keeping this in mind, over the years the ways of presenting themes in films have been varied and innovative. <b>Social</b> <b>realities</b> have been presented by film makers often in a serious tone creating a niche audience for the same, distancing such films from a mass audience. In recent times film makers have tried to portray <b>social</b> <b>realities</b> differently. In a first of its kind, Shyam Benegal has attempted to portray <b>social</b> <b>realities</b> through the tool of humour and satire. The present paper will attempt to study this practice of using <b>social</b> <b>realities</b> as a marketing tool by film makers, with special emphasis to Shyam Benegal’s ‘Welcome to Sajjanpur’...|$|R

25|$|The {{first school}} {{focuses on the}} ideological factors which are claimed to drive the caste system and holds that caste {{is rooted in the}} four varnas. This {{perspective}} was particularly common among scholars of the British colonial era and was articulated by Dumont, who concluded that the system was ideologically perfected several thousand years ago and has remained the primary <b>social</b> <b>reality</b> ever since. This school justifies its theory primarily by citing the ancient law book Manusmriti and disregards economic, political or historical evidence.|$|E
25|$|In general, {{allegedly}} overly unrealistic {{assumptions are}} one of the most common criticisms towards neoclassical economics. It is fair to say that many (but not all) of these criticisms can only be directed towards a subset of the neoclassical models (for example, there are many neoclassical models where unregulated markets fail to achieve Pareto-optimality and there has recently been an increased interest in modeling non-rational decision making). Its disregard for <b>social</b> <b>reality</b> and its alleged role in aiding the elites to widen the wealth gap and social inequality is also frequently criticized.|$|E

25|$|In {{what little}} Wieser wrote about methodology, {{he stated that}} {{economics}} {{is a kind of}} applied psychology for which the procedure is introspection, claiming similarity between Economics and sociology in that both attempt to achieve a more successful <b>social</b> <b>reality</b> of man, promoting the idea of utility that reports on each good and each individual. Aside from abandoning essentialism, both Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk and Wieser advocated objectively considering subjective factors, setting aside ideas that believe in the existence of an objective superhuman (essentialism) and theories of subjective elements that are incapable of objective measures (teleology of causality).|$|E

25|$|Brussels {{was limited}} to the current 19 municipalities. Many French-speakers complained that this did not {{correspond}} to the <b>social</b> <b>reality,</b> since the language border was {{based on the results of}} the 1947 language census and not that of 1960. French-speaking sources claim that in that year, French-speaking minorities had surpassed the 30% threshold in Alsemberg, Beersel, Sint-Pieters-Leeuw, Dilbeek, Strombeek-Bever, Sterrebeek, and Sint-Stevens-Woluwe, in which case French-language facilities should have been established under previous legislation. A political rift developed because French-speakers considered the language facilities as an essential right, while the Flemings saw the facilities as a temporary, transitional measure to allow the French-speaking minorities time to adapt to their Flemish surroundings.|$|E

Like the works of Ray and Ghatak, his cinema is known for its artistic depiction of <b>social</b> <b>reality.</b> Although the three directors shared a healthy rivalry, they were ardent admirers of each other's work, and in so doing, they charted the independent trajectory of parallel cinema, as a counterpoint to the mainstream fare of Hindi cinema in India. Mrinal Sen is an ardent follower of Marxist Philosophy.|$|E
25|$|The second {{school of}} thought focuses on {{socio-economic}} factors and claims that those factors drive the caste system. It believes caste to be rooted in the economic, political and material history of India. This school, which is common among scholars of the post-colonial era such as Berreman, Marriott, and Dirks, describes the caste system as an ever-evolving <b>social</b> <b>reality</b> {{that can only be}} properly understood by the study of historical evidence of actual practice and the examination of verifiable circumstances in the economic, political and material history of India. This school has focused on the historical evidence from ancient and medieval society in India, during the Muslim rule between the 12th and 18th centuries, and the policies of colonial British rule from 18th century to the mid-20th century.|$|E
25|$|The New Theatre {{movement}} {{started in}} America {{in the late}} 1920s.

They were also committed to developing the highest possible theatrical standards as well as to introduce it to the Australian people by infusing theatre into cultural groups in all industries, organisations and districts. Active participants in the groups were a mix of communists, members of the Labor Party and political unaligned who wanted to be actively involved in the group.|$|E
40|$|In the {{turbulent}} economy an organization must often reconstruct itself with self-reference {{to its own}} practices.

On another front there are the increasing interest and use of collective identity in the related social sciences recently. We argue that a vocabulary “collective identity ” can become a bridge between academic researches and the practitioners. Allowing the practitioners to look at multiple or alternative <b>social</b> <b>realities</b> among <b>social</b> forces rather than the single functional image of an organization, the vocabulary is expected to lead way to the possible use of existing approaches by the practitioners.
