50|$|While {{out in the}} country, Captain Cadbury informs {{them that}} the dogs are only half-trained {{and that they have}} not been taught how not to tear their victim to pieces. Walker then notices that the noise of the hounds is getting louder. They realise the dogs must have got out. Cadbury then realises that they must be {{tracking}} them, because Pike's uniform is covered in aniseed. Thus, the platoon make a run for it, carrying Godfrey aboard a <b>sheep</b> <b>hurdle.</b> Once they reach a stream, Mainwaring tells the platoon that dogs cannot follow a scent across water, so Pike is made to cross downstream. Mainwaring refuses to get his feet wet, and is carried across on the hurdle. Meanwhile, Pike falls in the river.|$|E

60|$|The {{people were}} {{scattered}} about in couples or parties of four, and either {{they were actually}} better acquainted, or the informal room made their manners easier. Through the open window came an uneven humming sound like that which rises from a flock of <b>sheep</b> pent within <b>hurdles</b> at dusk. The card-party occupied {{the centre of the}} foreground.|$|R

[...] "To begin with, we are {{not going}} to remain passive and allow {{ourselves}} to be driven like a flock of <b>sheep</b> into the <b>hurdles.</b> Did they bring against us only heavy armed troops we could laugh at them, for we can march two miles to their one, and move easily among the rocks where they could find no footing. It is only their light armed soldiers we have to fear, but even these must move at the same rate as the hoplites, for if they ventured far away from the protection of the spearmen we should make short work of them. We have over a thousand fighting men in these mountains, and each one of us in close conflict is a match for at least three of their light armed men. In the plains, of course, we should suffer greatly from their missiles before we came to a close conflict; but among these woods and precipices we could fall on them suddenly, and be in their midst before they have time to lay arrow to bow. Therefore, you see, the Romans can move but slowly among the hills, and we will soon teach them that they dare not scatter, and even twelve thousand men do not go for much among these mountains, extending some seventy miles from Cosenza to Rhegium, and from ten to twenty miles across.|$|R
60|$|To {{return to}} Watch. His hearing and {{eyesight}} failed {{as he grew}} older until he was practically blind and too deaf to hear any word given in the ordinary way. But he continued strong as ever on his legs, and his mind was not decayed, nor was he in the least tired. On the contrary, he was always eager to work, and as his blindness and deafness had made him sharper in other ways he {{was still able to}} make himself useful with the <b>sheep.</b> Whenever the <b>hurdles</b> were shifted to a fresh place and the sheep had to be kept {{in a corner of the}} enclosure until the new place was ready for them, it was old Watch's duty to keep them from breaking away. He could not see nor hear, but in some mysterious way he knew when they tried to get out, even if it was but one. Possibly the slight vibration of the ground informed him of the movement and the direction as well. He would make a dash and drive the sheep back, then run up and down before the flock until all was quiet again. But at last it became painful to witness his efforts, especially when the sheep were very restless, and incessantly trying to break away; and Watch finding them so hard to restrain would grow angry and rush at them with such fury that he would come violently against the hurdles at one side, then getting up, howling with pain, he would dash to the other side, when he would strike the hurdles there and cry out with pain once more.|$|R
