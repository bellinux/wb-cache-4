40|$|In {{this study}} we have {{investigated}} the image quality of lumbar spine radiographs taken after recording technical and physical parameters. Two technical parameters were altered, tube voltage (70 kV and 90 kV for the anteroposterior (AP) projection and 77 kV and 95 kV for the lateral projection) and sensitivity of the film-screen system (<b>sensitivity</b> <b>class</b> 400 and 600). In total, 85 images {{were included in the}} study. Entrance surface dose (ESD) was measured using thermoluminescent dosemeters. The mean value of ESD for the different technique groups varied between 1. 9 mGy (90 kV, <b>sensitivity</b> <b>class</b> 400) and 4. 6 mGy (70 kV, <b>sensitivity</b> <b>class</b> 400) for the AP projection, and between 6. 4 mGy (95 kV, <b>sensitivity</b> <b>class</b> 600) and 20. 4 mGy (70 kV, <b>sensitivity</b> <b>class</b> 400) for the lateral projection. Image criteria given in the "European Guidelines on Quality Criteria for Radiographic Images" were used to assess image quality. Two evaluation methods have been employed. A straightforward scoring of fulfilled image criteria, and visual grading analysis using the structures defined in the image criteria. The latter method provided a sharper distinction between groups of images taken using different radiographic techniques. The average number of fulfilled image criteria for the AP projections varied between 0. 74 (90 kV, <b>sensitivity</b> <b>class</b> 400) and 0. 87 (70 kV, <b>sensitivity</b> <b>class</b> 400). For the lateral projection this number varied between 0. 79 (95 kV, <b>sensitivity</b> <b>class</b> 600) and 0. 84 (77 kV, <b>sensitivity</b> <b>class</b> 600).

40|$|The Cosmology Large Angular Scale Surveyor (CLASS) is a four {{telescope}} array designed to characterize relic primordial gravitational waves from in ation and the optical depth to reionization through a {{measurement of the}} polarized cosmic microwave background (CMB) on the largest angular scales. The frequencies of the four CLASS telescopes, one at 38 GHz, two at 93 GHz, and one dichroic system at 145 / 217 GHz, are chosen to avoid spectral regions of high atmospheric emission and span the minimum of the polarized Galactic foregrounds: synchrotron emission at lower frequencies and dust emission at higher frequencies. Low-noise transition edge sensor detectors and a rapid front-end polarization modulator provide a unique combination of high sensitivity, stability, and control of systematics. The CLASS site, at 5200 m in the Chilean Atacama desert, allows for daily mapping of up to 70 % {{of the sky and}} enables the characterization of CMB polarization at the largest angular scales.

In supervised analysis of key 5 -FU pathways, expression of 91 genes {{was associated with}} 5 -FU sensitivity phenotype and segregated samples accordingly in hierarchical analysis.

Overexpression of thymidylate synthase and its adjacent gene, c-Yes, was detected in the resistant cell lines. The mRNA and protein overexpression of nuclear factor �B (NF�B) p 65 and related antiapoptotic c-Flip gene was detected in resistant cells. The 5 -FU– resistant cell lines also showed high NF�B DNA-binding activity. Cotransfection of NF�B p 50 and p 65 cDNA induced 5 -FU resistance in MCF- 7 cells. Both NF�B- and 5 -FU–induced resistant cell lines manifested reduced expression of genes governing G 1 -S and S-phase transition. Expression of genes involved in DNA replication was also down-regulated in resistant cell lines. These findings were highly consistent with the slower growth rate, higher proportion of G 1, and lower proportion of S-phase cells in the resistant cell lines.

A system-based approach, using a basic GIS, was used to compare three aspects of the coastal zone. Two existing planning documents (EMATEK/s Coastal Vegetation Importance Rating plan and CPA's Cape Coastal Conservation plan) were statistically compared - based primarily on the size and number of the landscape fragments (environmental criteria polygons). The resultant plan, an Intermediate <b>Sensitivity</b> <b>Class</b> map, was further integrated with the biophysical aspect of the coastal zone - coastal dunes. The final map is the product of these overlays to be used as a-working overlay for coastal zone decision-making. This is an Environmental Sensitivity map, which has no particular direct reference to any particular biophysical criteria, which categorizes the coastal zone according to the environmental sensitivity or conservation worthiness of the site. The categories are listed according to a sliding-scale of sensitivity or worthiness.

Endocrine cell models, that are most frequently used to study the mechanisms of regulated exocytosis, are pancreatic beta cells, adrenal chromaffin cells and pituitary cells. To reliably study the Ca 2 + sensitivity in endocrine cells, accurate and fast determination of Ca 2 + dependence in each tested cell is required.

40|$|Despite researchers' {{interest}} in adult stomatopod vision, {{only a handful}} of studies have investigated stomatopod larval visual ecology, the function of the larval compound eye, or its transition into the adult eye structures. In order to address this knowledge deficit, I tested several hypotheses surrounding larval eye physiology and ontogeny using microspectrophotometry (MSP) and electroretinography (ERG). MSP was used to investigate visual pigment diversity in the retinas of different species of stomatopod larvae. Together with data previously published, these data provide further support that larvae possess a single spectral class of photoreceptor. Surprisingly, the peak spectral absorbance varied significantly among sympatric species, with four species falling into a short-wavelength and the remainder into a long-wavelength <b>sensitivity</b> <b>class.</b> These results may be explained by differences in behavioral ecology or by different developmental stages of individual test subjects. To investigate ontogenetic changes in retinal function, ERG intensity responses were measured from different stage retinas of a single species, Squilla empusa. Initial MSP data from transitioning retinas found no evidence of visual pigment absorption in newly emerged adult retinas, implying a putative delay in photoreceptive function. Robust ERG responses to light stimuli, however, were observed from the earliest presence of emerging adult retinas, rejecting this hypothesis. These data also suggest an increase in the response dynamics of stomatopod retinas with ontogeny as well as an increase in irradiance sensitivity during the double-retina phase. To investigate the visual ecology of stomatopod larval light-reflecting structures, I characterized the function and structure of eyeshine overlying the retina. In situ photography of larvae eyeshine demonstrated its function as a contrast reducer, or camouflage. Calculations of eyeshine reflectance spectra in their natural setting revealed novel, spectral matching with the background environment. Eyeshine structures were characterized via transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and identified as amorphous, three-dimensional photonic crystal arrays of spherical vesicles that coherently scatter light. The photonic mechanism of eyeshine production was tested using a modified Bragg-theory model and dimensions from TEM micrographs. These eyeshine data as well as data regarding the physiology of stomatopod larval vision provide a strong foundation for future investigations into the ontogeny of vision in stomatopod crustaceans...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is the {{development}} of vapor detectors formed from composites of conductive carbon black and insulating organic multifunctional polymers having metal ions complexing ability. The new materials are tailored to produce increased <b>sensitivity</b> toward specific <b>classes</b> of analyte vapors. For comparison purpose, poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) with di(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate (DOP), a traditional low molecular weight plasticizer, is used as representative of the behavior of a traditional composite vapor detector...|$|R

Here, we extend the size spectra approach to phytoplankton ecological status assessment in transitional waters by developing, testing and validating a multi-metric index of size spectra sensitivity (ISS-phyto), which integrates size structure metrics with others such as phytoplankton diversity, biomass and <b>sensitivity</b> of size <b>classes</b> to anthropogenic disturbance. The ability of various theoretical models of size spectra sensitivity {{to discriminate between}} disturbed and undisturbed ecosystems and levels of anthropogenic stress was evaluated. We used data on phytoplankton samples collected in 14 Mediterranean and Black sea transitional water ecosystems (coastal lagoons) from Italy, Albania, Greece, Bulgaria and Romania, and compared the models’ efficiency by looking at their pressure–impact response along salinity and enrichment gradients, the latter quantified as variations in dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP). Data from a fifteenth Mediterranean lagoon was used for external validation purposes. Right asymmetric models of size <b>class</b> <b>sensitivity,</b> implying higher sensitivity of smaller cell size classes, were found {{to contribute to the}} ISS-phyto multimetric tool more effectively than symmetric and left asymmetric models, distinguishing disturbed from undisturbed lagoons and disturbed from undisturbed stations within the same lagoon. When based on right asymmetric sensitivity models, i. e., those that were most efficient in identifying anthropogenic impacts, ISS-phyto also showed the best fit of pressure–response relationships along the salinity and enrichment gradients; at low to high levels of impact ISS response was driven by size <b>class</b> <b>sensitivity</b> and at very high impacts by phytoplankton biomass. A scheme for the classification of Ecological Quality Status based on ISS-phyto is proposed and validated. The validation procedure found that ISS-phyto is an effective and sensitive monitoring tool, robust, easy to apply and to inter-calibrate among laboratories...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the domain of}} attraction and its <b>sensitivity</b> for a <b>class</b> of chaotic attractors generated by using second-order linear systems with hysteresis-series. It is found that the domain of attraction of the chaotic attractors is determined by an unstable limit cycle. The chaotic dynamical behaviors are demonstrated by using the Poincaré map. The sensitivity of the domain of attraction {{with respect to the}} system parameters is studied and some simulation results are presented. 1...|$|R
40|$|Systems of {{colour vision}} are {{normally}} identical in {{all members of}} a species, but a single design may not be adequate for species living in a diverse range of light environments. Here we show that in the mantis shrimp Haptosquilla trispinosa, which occupies a range of depths in the ocean, long-wavelength colour receptors are individually tuned to the local light environment. The spectral <b>sensitivity</b> of specific <b>classes</b> of photoreceptor is adjusted by filters that vary between individuals...|$|R
40|$|Imagery of the Atlantic {{shoreline}} {{zone of the}} Central Atlantic Regional Ecological Test Site (CARETS) {{was evaluated}} for classifying land use and land cover, employing the USGS Geographic Application Program's land use classification system. ERTS data can {{provide a basis for}} land cover and land use mapping within the shoreline zone, however because of the dynamic nature of this environment, two additional terms are considered: vulnerability of classes to storms and progressive erosion, and <b>sensitivity</b> of the <b>classes</b> to man's activities...|$|R
