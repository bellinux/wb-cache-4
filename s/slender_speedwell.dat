50|$|Veronica filiformis is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the genus Veronica. It is known by many common names, including <b>slender</b> <b>speedwell,</b> creeping speedwell, threadstalk speedwell and Whetzel weed. It is native to eastern Europe and western Asia, and it is known in many other regions as an introduced species and a common weed.|$|E
40|$|<b>Slender</b> <b>speedwell</b> (Veronica filiformis) is a {{non-native}} and {{invasive species}} of grassland. The {{aim of the}} study was to test the ability of the <b>Slender</b> <b>speedwell</b> growth in differently managed grasslands (mowing, mulching, grazing). After a two-year experiment, a statistically significant influence on the management application among growth of <b>Slender</b> <b>speedwell</b> was found (F = 14. 462, p < 0. 001). The best survival was found in one-year mulched vegetation (dominant Deschampsia caespitosa) in the Zhůří plot and in hay and pasture crops in the V. Chuchelec plot (dominant Festuca pratensis, Lolium perenne, Trisetum flavescens, Poa pratensis, Dactylis glomerata and Phleum pratense). <b>Slender</b> <b>speedwell</b> can be well applied in permanent grasslands higher, colder and wetter conditions with management as mowing, grazing or mulching...|$|E
40|$|The {{experiment}} {{was focused on}} clonal development of <b>Slender</b> <b>speedwell</b> (Veronica filiformis Sm.) from small cutting stems without using of stimulative agents. Short stems from four various part of aboveground body were cultivated: main terminal part, secondary terminal part, small nodes, and big nodes. All different vegetative parts were able to produce roots, take roots in soil substrate and in semi-natural meadow, survive winter, and make flower. The species was more successful in company with these meadow plants: Lotus corniculatus, Medicago lupulina, Achillea millefolium, Plantago lanceolata, Taraxacum sect. Ruderalia, Trifolium repens and Crepis biennis. The best growth was confirmed for both of main and lateral terminal parts. These terminal segments had {{the greatest number of}} survived individuals, flowering stem, and weigh of dried parts...|$|E
