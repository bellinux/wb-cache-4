5|$|A new jack swing album, The Revival {{features}} R {{music that}} draws on funk and older soul influences. Its songs incorporate eccentric <b>sounds</b> <b>and</b> stylistic elements from jazz and hip hop, including improvisational sounds, conversational vocals, and digital samples. The group's lyrics exhibit contemporary hip hop attitudes and traditional soul themes, with songs about unruly women, low-key ballads, and more danceable tracks.|$|E
5|$|Cockatoos {{often have}} {{pronounced}} responses to musical <b>sounds</b> <b>and</b> numerous videos exist showing the birds dancing to popular music. Research conducted in 2008 with an Eleonora cockatoo named Snowball had {{indicated that this}} particular individual is indeed capable of beat induction—perceiving human-created music and synchronizing his body movements to the beat.|$|E
5|$|Communication using surface-borne {{vibrational}} signals is {{more widespread}} among insects because of size constraints in producing air-borne sounds. Insects cannot effectively produce low-frequency <b>sounds,</b> <b>and</b> high-frequency sounds tend to disperse {{more in a}} dense environment (such as foliage), so insects living in such environments communicate primarily using substrate-borne vibrations. The mechanisms of production of vibrational signals are just as diverse as those for producing sound in insects.|$|E

5|$|Internationally, Hitchcock {{was forced}} to make {{minor changes to the}} film, mostly to the shower scene. In Britain, the BBFC {{requested}} cuts to stabbing <b>sounds</b> <b>and</b> visible nude shots, and in New Zealand the shot of Norman washing blood from his hands was objected to. In Singapore, though the shower scene was left untouched, the murder of Arbogast, and a shot of Norman's mother's corpse were removed.|$|E
5|$|Like other Hawaiian honeycreepers, the hookbill {{possessed a}} {{distinctive}} musty odor. The bird's only known vocalization was an inconspicuous chirp; however, all other Hawaiian honeycreepers are excellent vocalists that demonstrate {{an array of}} <b>sounds,</b> <b>and</b> therefore the hookbill likely had a broader, unrecorded repertoire.|$|E

5|$|Myst Online was {{generally}} well received by critics. The game has average critic scores of 77% and 83% at aggregate sites Metacritic and GameRankings, respectively.

The world that persistently changes depending on player actions was also lauded as more sophisticated than other MMOs.|$|E

5|$|Although {{generally}} {{quiet and}} non-vocal, giraffes {{have been heard}} to communicate using various sounds. During courtship, males emit loud coughs. Females call their young by bellowing. Calves will emit snorts, bleats, mooing and mewing sounds. Giraffes also snore, hiss, moan, grunt and make flute-like <b>sounds,</b> <b>and</b> possibly communicate over long distances using infrasound—though this is disputed. During nighttime, giraffes appear to hum to each other above the infrasound range for purposes which are unclear.|$|E

5|$|As in {{all other}} tetrapods, mammals have a larynx that can quickly open and close to produce <b>sounds,</b> <b>and</b> a supralaryngeal vocal tract which filters this sound. The lungs and {{surrounding}} musculature provide the air stream and pressure required to phonate. The larynx controls the pitch and volume of sound, but the strength the lungs exert to exhale also contributes to volume. More primitive mammals, such as the echidna, can only hiss, as sound is achieved solely through exhaling through a partially closed larynx. Other mammals phonate using vocal folds, {{as opposed to the}} vocal cords seen in birds and reptiles. The movement or tenseness of the vocal folds can result in many sounds such as purring and screaming. Mammals can change the position of the larynx, allowing them to breathe through the nose while swallowing through the mouth, and to form both oral and nasal sounds; nasal sounds, such as a dog whine, are generally soft <b>sounds,</b> <b>and</b> oral sounds, such as a dog bark, are generally loud.|$|E
5|$|At {{each stage}} {{mentioned}} above, children play with <b>sounds</b> <b>and</b> learn methods {{to help them}} learn words. There is a relationship between children's prelinguistic phonetic skills and their lexical progress at age two: failure to develop the required phonetic skills in their prelinguistic period results in children's delay in producing words. Environmental influences may affect children's phonological development, such as hearing loss {{as a result of}} ear infections. Deaf infants and children with hearing problems due to infections are usually delayed in the beginning of vocal babbling.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} 2003, running {{independently}} {{from the}} pioneering FWD night, an event called Filthy Dub, co promoted by Plastician, and partner David Carlisle started happening regularly. It was there that Skream, Benga, NType, Walsh, Chef, Loefah, and Cyrus made their debuts as DJs. South London collective Digital Mystikz (Mala and Coki), along with labelmates and collaborators Loefah and MC Sgt Pokes soon came into their own, bringing sound system thinking, dub values, and appreciation of jungle bass weight to the dubstep scene. Digital Mystikz brought an expanded palette of <b>sounds</b> <b>and</b> influences to the genre, most prominently reggae and dub, as well as orchestral melodies.|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe {{investigate}} whether a <b>sound</b> <b>and</b> complete formal system for join dependencies can be found. We present {{a system that}} is <b>sound</b> <b>and</b> complete for tuple generating dependencies and is strong enough to derive join dependencies from join dependencies using only generalized join dependencies in the derivation. We also present a system that <b>sound</b> <b>and</b> complete for tuple generating dependencies and is complete for extended join dependencies (which are a special case of generalized join dependencies). Finally, we construct a Gentzen-style system that is <b>sound</b> <b>and</b> complete for join dependencies. The last two systems have unbounded inference rules...|$|R
40|$|This paper proposes some {{theological}} {{perspectives on}} the phenomenon of sound (i. e. music), linking it to the gospel of salvation (i. e. well-being). Possible links between <b>sound</b> <b>and</b> music; <b>sound</b> <b>and</b> life; <b>sound</b> <b>and</b> silence; <b>and</b> <b>sound</b> <b>and</b> salvation are indicated. Some differences between the Western and African understandings of <b>sound,</b> music <b>and</b> life are highlighted; followed by suggestions concerning the connections between salvation, well-being, and the healing of life. A theological understanding of music {{as an expression of}} transcendence and anticipation is given, profiling it as a distinct form of hope. The paper concludes by comparing two iconic paintings that depict sound: The Scream by Edvard Munch and The Tortured Christ by Guido Rocha...|$|R

5|$|Following the {{dissolution}} of the plans for the new ballpark, and prior to the 2008 season, more than $1million in upgrades and repairs were made to Greer Stadium.

5|$|Frequent radio {{transmissions}} through the player's communications device also {{add to the}} atmosphere, by broadcasting certain <b>sounds</b> <b>and</b> messages from non-player characters meant to unsettle the player. Early in the game, during and directly after the event that plunges the base into chaos, the player often hears the sounds of fighting, screaming and dying through their radio transmitter. The ambient sound is extended to the base itself through such things as hissing pipes, footsteps, and occasional jarringly loud noises from machinery or other sources. Often ambient sounds can be heard that resemble deep breathing, unexplained voices and demonic taunting from the game's antagonists.|$|E
