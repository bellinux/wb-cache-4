25|$|Despite {{the depth}} and {{complexity}} of his writings, Fiore dei Liberi {{does not seem to}} have been a very influential master in the development of Italian fencing. That field was instead dominated by the tradition of his near-contemporary the Bolognese master Filippo di Bartolomeo Dardi. Even <b>so,</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> number of later treatises which bear strong resemblance to his work, including the writings of Philippo di Vadi and Ludwig VI von Eyb of Hartenstein. This may be due to the direct influence of Fiore or his writings, or it may instead indicate that the older tradition of Johane and Nicholai survived and spread outside of his direct line.|$|E
25|$|A pointed pseudotriangulation with v {{vertices}} {{must have}} exactly 2v − 3 edges. This follows {{by a simple}} double counting argument involving the Euler characteristic: as each face but the outer one is a pseudotriangle, with three convex angles, the pseudotriangulation must have 3f − 3 convex angles between adjacent edges. Each edge is the clockwise edge for two angles, <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> total of 2e angles, of which all but v are convex. Thus, 3f − 3 = 2e − v. Combining this with the Euler equation f − e + v = 2 and solving the resulting simultaneous linear equations gives e = 2v − 3.|$|E

25|$|After {{restoration}} in {{the mid-1990s}} {{it was discovered that}} the formerly assumed chronological sequence was in some cases incorrect. The installation was accordingly rearranged, but the original numbering of the 51 relief panels in the Pergamon Museum was retained. For example, the resorting led to moving what had formerly been regarded as the first panel to a location following panel 31. Not all panels survived, <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> few gaps in the presentation of the story. (Of the original 74 panels, only about 47 whole or partial panels survived. Panels 37 and 43 are not on display as part of the frieze for lack of space.) The following list reflects the sequence after reassembly in 1995.|$|E

[...] This is exemplified in the songs [...] "Reborn", [...] "Wake up", and [...] "Breathing New Life". [...] "Blunt Force Trauma" [...] is about when someone or something comes up behind you when you least expect it, [...] "it could be a situation in your life, it could be a person you know with a beer bottle".|$|E
500|$|The 2012–13 {{season was}} Wenger's first without Rice, {{who retired in}} late spring. Bould was named as his replacement, who {{specialised}} in defensive work. Arsenal struggled to find consistency {{in the league and}} were 12 points behind leaders Manchester United by November 2012. A month later, Wenger came under strong criticism following his side's exit in the League Cup to Bradford City, when a full-strength team lost on penalties to opposition three divisions below. Further cup defeats to Blackburn Rovers and Bayern Munich in the FA Cup and Champions League, respectively, ended Arsenal's trophy chances for an eighth consecutive season. Before the first leg, Wenger had criticised the media for reporting he was about to sign a contract extension, and said of the Blackburn game: [...] "We lost it in the last 20 minutes, <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> lot of superficial analyses that you cannot accept. Because one guy says something, everybody goes the same way".|$|E

2500|$|... or in words, the nth Fibonacci {{number is}} the sum of the {{previous}} two Fibonacci numbers, may be shown by dividing the F'n sums of 1s and 2s that add to n−1 into two non-overlapping groups. One group contains those sums whose first term is 1 and the other those sums whose first term is 2. In the first group the remaining terms add to n−2, so it has F'n-1 sums, and in the second group the remaining terms add to n−3, so there are F'n−2 sums. <b>So</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> total of F'n−1 + F'n−2 sums altogether, showing this is equal to F'n.|$|E

Tom might have done the like by him of course. But the same private man out of all the men alive, was in the mind of each at the same moment; was prominently connected though in a different manner, with the day's adventures of both; and formed, when they passed each other in the street, the one absorbing topic of their thoughts.|$|E
