40|$|Locally derived ice {{is often}} {{observed}} to fill through-cutting rifts and uneven fronts in ice shelves. That ice may nucleate as fast ice at the shelf front, by growth {{at the sea}} surface within rifts, or by basal accretion.

Much of the <b>shelf</b> <b>system</b> is severely rifted, with locally derived ice filling the space between rift walls and around ice rafts.

40|$|Grain-size distributions, total {{organic carbon}} (TOC) and total {{nitrogen}} (TN) concentrations, and TOC/TN ratios (C/N) were analysed for surface sediments from the Lower Yangtze River-East China Sea (ECS) <b>shelf</b> <b>system.</b> Hierarchical cluster analysis of grain-size parameters (mode, mean, sorting, skewness and kurtosis) has been employed to characterize grain-size compositions. The results suggest there are five grain-size compositional types (type-I–V) that fingerprint distinct depositional conditions. In areas with high sedimentation rates, hydrological sorting preferentially enriches the fraction coarser than 6. 4 ø (12 μm) in shallow seafloor sediments (water depth 30 m), and thus forms grain-size compositional type-I (shallow) and type-II (deep). In the open shelf, where modern sediment supply is very limited, grain-size types-III–V are identified according to different winnowing intensity. Overall TOC contents significantly correlate with mud proportions, suggesting muddy sediments are the primary control on OM accumulation. However, de-association of terrestrial OM from fine sediments in the Estuary and the occurrence of presumably relict OM in the open shelf exert additional controls on OM dispersal and carbon cycling in the ECS. By considering geography, oceanography, sediment source, and the relation between sedimentation conditions and sedimentary OM distributions, we define six depositional settings: the lower river, the estuary, the coast, the offshore upwelling area, the erosional area, and the open shelf. These settings describe the sediment dispersal and associated organic matter cycling in the Lower Yangtze River-ECS <b>shelf</b> <b>system...</b>|$|E

40|$|Continental <b>shelf</b> <b>systems</b> {{are highly}} dynamic {{sedimentary}} environments, where sediments from biogenic production {{as well as}} from terrigenous sources are redistributed in the <b>shelf</b> depositional <b>system,</b> and partly exported off the shelf to the slope and the deep sea. The Golfe d'Arguin (Mauritania, NW Africa) is dominated by such redistribution processes, involving clastic silt imported as dust from the Sahara desert and biogenic carbonates of marine origin. Indeed, surface-sediment grain size and mineralogy show a clear north-south partitioning of sediment type. Fine material is winnowed from {{the northern part of the}} gulf, and transported toward the southern part off the Banc d'Arguin, where coarse silt settles on the outer shelf and upper slope, at least down to 600 m water depth. Particles of the fine silt fraction, estimated in terms of eolian material collected aboard the research vessel, are thought to be exported further offshore as they correspond to grain sizes previously reported from adjacent deep-sea sediments. These findings suggest that the interpretation of dust records from the continental slope and rise off NW Africa must consider reworking and partitioning processes active on the Mauritanian shelf...|$|R
40|$|Quaternary {{sea level}} {{fluctuations}} have greatly affected the sediment budgets {{of the continental}} shelves. Previous studies suggested that this caused a considerable increase in the net loss of shelf sediments. Since sediment accumulation and erosion are {{closely tied to the}} formation and re-oxidation of pyrite, we use a high-resolution record of sulfur isotope ratios (34 S / 32 S) of marine sulfate to evaluate the implications of the so-called "shelf sediment offloading" on the global sulfur cycle. Modeling of our δ 34 S record suggests that erosion during sea level lowstands was only partly compensated by increased sedimentation during times of rising sea level and sea level highstands. Furthermore, our data suggests that <b>shelf</b> <b>systems</b> reached a new equilibrium state about 700 ka, which considerably slowed or terminated shelf sediment offloading...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Landforms and sediments in the Prince Charles Mountains {{record the}} timing and mag-nitude of Cenozoic palaeotopographic changes in the Lambert Glacier–Amery Ice <b>Shelf</b> <b>system.</b> A review of geomorphic and sedimentological {{evidence}} indicates that considerable (. 1 – 2 km) glacial incision into a pre-glacial palaeosurface occurred along the major outlet glaciers during the Cenozoic. This erosion was in turn the likely driver for uplift that averaged c. 50 m/Ma along the flank of the Amery Ice Shelf {{since at least the}} mid-Miocene Epoch. The volume of eroded material is an order of magnitude greater than the quantity of sediment presently preserved in Prydz Bay, suggesting considerable export of Cenozoic sediment off the continental shelf. The magnitude of erosion recorded in the Prince Charles Mountains is sufficient to have focussed Cenozoic ice-drainage patterns, but was too slow to have driven Quaternary changes in ice volume. Sediments preserved in Prydz Bay on the continen-tal shelf (Hambrey et al. 1991) and in the trough– mouth fan (Cooper & O’Brien 2004) provide an excellent record with which to interpret the glacial history of the Lambert Glacier–Amery Ice <b>Shelf</b> <b>System</b> during the Cenozoic (Fig. 1). Large-scale topographic changes may also have affected the dynamics of the ice sheet on this timescale (Taylor et al. 2004). Thus, landscape evolution in the Prince Charles Mountains must be taken into con-sideration when interpreting the Cenozoic glacial history of the region. Cenozoic landscape development in the Prince Charles Mountains has been investigated using many different techniques, including geomorphic analysis of the present landscape (Crohn 1959; Trai...|$|E
40|$|By {{incorporating}} recently available {{remote sensing}} data, we investigated the mass balance for all individual tributary glacial basins of the Lambert Glacier-Amery Ice <b>Shelf</b> <b>system,</b> East Antarctica. On {{the basis of}} the ice flow information derived from SAR interferometry and ICESat laser altimetry, we have determined the spatial configuration of eight tributary drainage basins of the Lambert-Amery glacial system. By combining the coherence information from SAR interferometry and the texture information from SAR and MODIS images, we have interpreted and refined the grounding line position. We calculated ice volume flux of each tributary glacial basin based on the ice velocity field derived from Radarsat three-pass interferometry together with ice thickness data interpolated from Australian and Russian airborne radio echo sounding (RES) surveys and inferred from ICESat laser altimetry data. Our analysis reveals that three tributary basins have a significant net positive imbalance, while five other subbasins are slightly positive or close to zero balance. Overall, in contrast to previous studies, we find that the grounded ice in Lambert Glacier-Amery Ice <b>Shelf</b> <b>system</b> has a positive mass imbalance of 22. 9 ± 4. 4 Gt/a. The net basal melting for the entire Amery Ice Shelf is estimated to be 27. 0 ± 7. 0 Gt/a. The melting rate decreases rapidly from the grounding zone to the ice shelf front. Significant basal refreezing is detected in the downstream section of the ice shelf.

Uncertainties in observation-based estimates of nitrogen and carbon fluxes mostly result from uncertainties in the shelf-open ocean exchange of organic and inorganic matter, which is hard to quantify based on observations alone, but can be inferred from biogeochemical models. Model-based nitrogen and carbon budgets are presented for the Northwestern North Atlantic continental shelf.

40|$|AbstractLandscape and {{seascape}} {{structures are}} typically complex and manifest as patch mosaics within characteristic biomes, bordering {{one another in}} gradual or abrupt ecotones. The underlying patch structure in coastal shelf ecosystems {{is driven by the}} interaction of tectonic, sedimentary, and sea level dynamic processes. Animals and plants occupy and interact within these mosaics. Terrestrial landscape ecological studies have shown that patch structure is important for ecological processes such as foraging, connectivity, predation, and species dynamics. The importance of patch structure for marine systems is less clear because far fewer pattern-process studies have been conducted in these systems. For many coastal <b>shelf</b> <b>systems,</b> there is a paucity of information on how species occupy shelf seascapes, particularly for seascapes imbued with complex patch structure and ecotones that are common globally due to tectonic activity. Here, we present the results of a study conducted along a myriameter-scale gradient of bottom and sub-bottom geological forcing altered by tectonic deformation, sea level transgression and sediment allocation. The resulting seascape is dominated by unconsolidated sediments throughout, but also exhibits increasing density and size of outcropping patches along a habitat patch gradient forced by the erosion of a sea level transgressive surface that has been deformed and tilted by tectonic forcing. A combination of sub-bottom profiling, multibeam bathymetry, and ROV surveys of the habitats and the demersal megafauna occupying the habitats indicate (1) significant beta diversity along this gradient, (2) biological diversity does not scale with habitat diversity, and (3) species occupy the patches disproportionately (non-linearly) with regard to the proportional availability of their preferred habitats. These results indicate that shelf habitat patch structure modulates species specific processes and interactions with other species. Further studies are needed to examine experimentally the mechanics of how patch structure modulates ecological processes in <b>shelf</b> <b>systems.</b> Our results also provide further support for including multiple spatial scales of patch structure for the application of remote habitat sensing as a surrogate for biological community structure...|$|R
