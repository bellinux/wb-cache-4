500|$|Pricing {{is similar}} to other {{restaurants}} owned by Ramsay, and {{it is intended to}} bring a fine dining experience out of specialist airport lounges and make it available to any traveller. Starters include a pea, leek and goat cheese tart, while mains include sea bass which is steamed and served alongside lemongrass and white asparagus. Chocolate fondue with marshmallows and waffles are among the options for dessert as well as a knickerbocker glory. Traditional fine dining dishes are also included on the menu, such as <b>Sevruga</b> caviar. Ramsay said in interviews around the launch of the restaurant that he aimed to keep [...] "it all very lean, lean, lean. No heavy sauces". He compared the menu to a cross between The Ivy, his own Boxwood Cafe and The Wolseley. A specific menu is offered for quick dining, called [...] "Plane Fast". This has multiple-course meals which aim to be served within 25 minutes.|$|E
5000|$|Because the Stellate {{sturgeon}} is {{the most}} common and reproduces more quickly, this makes <b>Sevruga</b> caviar the most commonly found of the sturgeon caviars, and the most inexpensive of the three main types of sturgeon caviar - Beluga, Osetra and <b>Sevruga.</b> [...] It’s calculated that about half the caviar production comes from <b>Sevruga.</b> <b>Sevruga</b> caviar eggs are a pearlescent grey, and smaller in size than other sturgeon. The flavor is more pronounced than other varieties, often described as saltier, but it can vary depending on the origin of the fish. The caviar is packaged and sold in red tins.|$|E
50|$|A rare type of caviar {{known as}} Imperial Caviar, from the Sterlet {{sturgeon}} (Acipenser ruthenus), a now nearly extinct species of sturgeon from the Caspian Sea, is sometimes incorrectly labeled as <b>Sevruga,</b> {{as well as}} the even rarer Golden Caviar from the albino Sterlet, the caviar being yellow in color. “Pressed <b>sevruga</b> caviar” can also be found, made of a blend of Osetra and <b>Sevruga</b> caviar that has been heated in a saline solution.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Sevruga</b> caviar {{is one of}} {{the highest}} priced {{varieties}} of caviar, eclipsed in cost only by the Beluga and Ossetra varieties. It is harvested from the <b>Sevruga</b> sturgeon (Acipenser stellatus) native to the Caspian Sea, and may be distinguished from its more expensive cousins {{by the size of the}} eggs, which are generally smaller.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Sevruga</b> is the {{smallest}} of the caviar-producing sturgeons. It can grow as far as 150 lbs. in weight and 7 feet in length. It is native to the Black, Azov, Caspian and Aegean Sea basins.|$|E
5000|$|The main {{types of}} caviar are Beluga, Sterlet, Kaluga hybrid, American osetra, Ossetra, Siberian {{sturgeon}} and <b>Sevruga.</b> The rarest and costliest is from beluga sturgeon that {{swim in the}} Caspian Sea, which is bordered by Iran, Kazakhstan, Russia, Turkmenistan, and Azerbaijan. Wild caviar production was suspended in Russia between 2008 and 2011 to allow wild stocks to replenish. Azerbaijan and Iran also allow the fishing of sturgeon off their coasts. Beluga caviar is prized for its soft, extremely large (pea-size) eggs. It can range in color from pale silver-gray to black. It {{is followed by the}} small golden sterlet caviar which is rare and was once reserved for Russian, Iranian and Austrian royalty. Next in quality is the medium-sized, light brown to rich brown Ossetra, also known as Russian caviar. Others in the quality ranking are the gray <b>sevruga</b> caviar, the Chinese Kaluga caviar, and the American osetra. The Siberian variety with black beads is similar to <b>sevruga</b> and is popular because of its reduced (5 years) harvest period, but it's more briny than other kinds. The Chinese Kaluga hybrid varies in color from dark gray to light golden green and is a close cousin of beluga caviar.|$|E
50|$|Traditionally, {{the term}} caviar refers only to roe from wild {{sturgeon}} in the Caspian Sea and Black Sea (Beluga, Ossetra and <b>Sevruga</b> caviars). Depending on the country, caviar {{may also be}} used to describe the roe of other fish such as salmon, steelhead, trout, lumpfish, whitefish, carp, and other species of sturgeon.|$|E
50|$|Opened in 2016, Unsalted Seas explores large lakes of {{the world}} and the animals that call them home. The exhibit {{features}} the largest sturgeon touchtank in North America with a primary focus on sturgeon from Russian and North Asian waters. Several species of those sturgeon including Beluga, <b>Sevruga,</b> Sterlet and Osetra came from Sturgeon Aquafarms in Florida.|$|E
50|$|The {{first version}} of the $100 Egg Roll was {{announced}} in August 2011. After being publicly criticised {{for the use of}} shark fin, Lee issued a public apology and revised his recipe to include Maine lobster tail and Alaskan king crab as a replacement. The egg roll was topped with <b>Sevruga</b> caviar and gold leaf, and paired with a fresh raspberry and Sauvignon Blanc reduction dipping sauce. The egg rolls were routinely served with Dom Perignon champagne.|$|E
50|$|Because of its epicurean nature, The Cheese Store of Beverly Hills {{has been}} known to carry hard-to-find and {{high-end}} ingredients, which over the years have included Austrian pumpkin seed oil, fresh truffles (in season), varieties of French butter, various kinds of Russian caviar (Golden Imperial Osetra and <b>Sevruga),</b> French and Spanish hams, Italian prosciutto, and 25 varieties of extra virgin olive oil. As part of the store’s environmental ethos customers are encouraged to bring their own bottles, which are then filled with olive oil.|$|E
50|$|The {{signature}} dish of {{the restaurant}} was scrambled duck egg, which was flambéed tableside with vodka. This was then topped with <b>Sevruga</b> caviar, and served with both buckwheat and plain blinis as well as chilled vodka. A second dish which Blunos became well known for at Lettonie was one which appeared to be boiled egg and toast soldiers. It was however, a hollowed out egg filled with vanilla cream and mango coulis. This was then served with shortbread that had been sprinkled with sugar and grated chocolate.|$|E
50|$|In Russian, {{there are}} {{different}} names for the species of sturgeon that live in various territories such as Beluga (Huso huso), <b>Sevruga</b> (Acipenser stellatus) and Sterlet (Acipenser ruthenus). The name Ossetra corresponds to the species Acipenser gueldenstaedtii, which is much smaller than Beluga sturgeon (Huso huso), and has a firmer texture. In {{the territory of the}} Russian Federation dwells another type of sturgeon, Siberian sturgeon (Acipenser Baerii), which is farmed all over the world because it can adapt to a wider range of habitats. It begins to produce caviar faster than Acipenser gueldenstaedtii.|$|E
5000|$|The starry {{sturgeon}} (Acipenser stellatus) {{also known as}} stellate sturgeon or <b>sevruga</b> (Drakul, اوزون برون , and Uzun Burun), is a species of sturgeon. It is native to the Black, Azov, Caspian and Aegean sea basins, {{but it has been}} extirpated from the last and it is predicted that the remaining natural population will follow soon due to overfishing. It is considered critically endangered by the IUCN and international trade in this species (including its caviar) is restricted by CITES. The {{starry sturgeon}} is an anadromous species, which migrates up rivers to spawn.|$|E

50|$|In September 2005, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service {{banned the}} import of Caspian Sea Beluga caviar to protect the {{endangered}} Beluga sturgeon; a month later, the ban was extended to include Beluga caviar from the entire Black Sea basin. In January 2006, the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna (CITES) supported an international embargo on caviar export. In January 2007, this ban was partly lifted, allowing the sale of 96 tons of caviar, 15% below the official 2005 level. In July 2010, Russia and some other CIS countries restarted the export of caviar. The 2010 quotas allow for the export of three tons of beluga, 17 tons of <b>sevruga</b> and 27 tons of osetra. In September 2010, Kazakhstan launched a state monopoly brand, Zhaik Balyk, from the Kazakh word for the Ural River. Under the CITES agreement, Kazakhstan was granted the right to produce 13 out of the 80 tons allowed up until 28 February 2011.|$|E
50|$|The Beluga {{sturgeon}} {{is currently}} {{considered to be}} critically endangered, causing the United States Fish and Wildlife Service to ban in 2005 the importation of Beluga caviar which originated in the Caspian Sea and Black Sea basin. In 2006, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) suspended all trade made with the traditional caviar-producing regions of the Caspian and Black Seas (Beluga, Ossetra and <b>Sevruga),</b> (Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, China, Iran, Kazakhstan, Romania, Russia, Serbia and Montenegro, Turkmenistan, and Ukraine) due to the producing countries' failure to apply international regulations and recommendations. Caviar from Iran is exempted from the ban. Iran is considered by CITES to practice effective conservation and policing of its fisheries. In January 2007, this ban was partly lifted, allowing the sale of 96 tons of caviar, 15 percent below the official 2005 level. CITES maintained the 2007 quotas for 2008, drawing criticism for doing little to protect the declining sturgeon population.|$|E

40|$|Deutscher Caviar, {{made from}} roe of {{lumpfish}} or capelin, gives species specific patterns in protein electrophoresis. The same techniques {{can be used}} to differentiate caviar from salmon and trout. The differentiation of sturgeon caviar (beluga, osietra, <b>sevruga)</b> is possible by isoelectric focusing, but not by SDS-PAGE. PCR-based methods of DNA-analysis for identification of the origin of sturgeon caviar are under development...|$|E
40|$|Addition {{of natural}} {{additives}} (prebiotics, probiotics, phytobiotics) in fish feed is a benefic method because {{it leads to}} improved growth performance of fish reared in intensive production systems. Sea buckthorn {{is one of the}} most commonly phytobiotics used in aquaculture because of its antioxidant, antimicrobial, immunostimulant, anti-stress, cytoprotective, liver and tissue regeneration properties. Sea buckthorn berries are rich in vitamins (B, C, E and K), flavonoids, carotenoids, tocopherols and many volatile compounds. In this context the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of dietary vitamin E (500 mg/kg diet) and sea buckthorn on growth performance and survival of the A. stellatus juveniles reared in a recirculating aquaculture system. The experiment took place in the recirculating pilot system of “Dunărea de Jos” University of Galați. In order to emphasize the influence of the above mentioned immunostimulants on <b>sevruga</b> fingerlings with different genetic background, four experimental groups from different genitors (V 1 : ♀ 2 Danube x ♂ 1 Aquaculture, V 2 : ♀ 1 Danube x ♂ 1 Danube, V 3 : ♀ 1 Danube x ♂ 2 Aquaculture and V 4 : ♀ 2 Danube x ♂ 2 Danube) have been used. At the end of the experiment no significant differences (p> 0. 05) were observed in terms of final mean weight, individual growth rate, SGR, FCR, PER, between the <b>sevruga</b> fingerlings obtained from wild genitors, comparing with those obtained from aquaculture genitors...|$|E
