50|$|In 1940 {{the down}} refuge siding was {{converted}} into a loop so that goods trains could run straight in without reversing, and three loop sidings were provided behind the platform. These were originally intended to help the flow of goods traffic during the Second World War, but later became a useful place to <b>stable</b> <b>empty</b> passenger trains on busy summer Saturdays.|$|E
50|$|Despite {{having a}} limited train service an {{additional}} platform was built {{south of the}} existing platform so that the level crossing {{at the south end}} of the original platform could remain open. In 1900 a goods yard was built between the Low and High Level stations accessible from the Lower Edmonton (Low Level) line and these six sidings were also used to <b>stable</b> <b>empty</b> coaching stock trains. A small signal box was located near the level crossing that separated the two platforms.|$|E
40|$|While {{wild type}} polio has been nearly {{eradicated}} {{there will be}} a need to continue immunisation programmes for some time because of the possibility of re-emergence and the existence of long term excreters of poliovirus. All vaccines in current use depend on growth of virus and most of the non-replicating (inactivated) vaccines involve wild type viruses known to cause poliomyelitis. The attenuated vaccine strains involved in the eradication programme have been used to develop new inactivated vaccines as production is thought safer. However it is known that the Sabin vaccine strains are genetically unstable and can revert to a virulent transmissible form. A possible solution to the need for virus growth would be to generate empty viral capsids by recombinant technology, but hitherto such particles are so unstable as to be unusable. We report here the genetic manipulation of the virus to generate <b>stable</b> <b>empty</b> capsids for all three serotypes. The particles are shown to be extremely stable and to generate high levels of protective antibodies in animal models...|$|E

40|$|Photoactivation of the retinal {{photoreceptor}} rhodopsin proceeds {{through a}} cascade of intermediates, resulting in protein–protein interactions catalyzing the activation of the G-protein transducin (Gt). Using stabilization and photoregeneration of the receptor’s signaling state and Gt activation assays, we provide evidence for a two-site sequential fit mechanism of Gt activation. We show that the C-terminal peptide from the Gt γ-subunit, Gtγ(50 – 71) farnesyl, can replace the holoprotein in stabilizing rhodopsin’s active intermediate metarhodopsin II (MII). However, the peptide cannot replace the Gtβγ complex in direct activation assays. Competition by Gtγ(50 – 71) farnesyl with Gt for the active receptor suggests a pivotal role for Gtβγ in signal transfer from MII to Gt. MII stabilization and competition is also found for the C-terminal peptide from the Gt α-subunit, Gtα(340 – 350), but the capacity of this peptide to interfere in MII-Gt interactions is paradoxically low compared with its activity to stabilize MII. Besides this disparity, the pH profiles of competition with Gt are characteristically different for the two peptides. We propose a two-site sequential fit model for signal transfer from the activated receptor, R*, to the G-protein. In {{the center of the}} model is specific recognition of conformationally distinct sites of R* by Gtα(340 – 350) and Gtγ(50 – 71) farnesyl. One matching pair of domains on the proteins would, on binding, lead to a conformational change in the G-protein and/or receptor, with subsequent binding of the second pair of domains. This process could be the structural basis for GDP release and the formation of a <b>stable</b> <b>empty</b> site complex that is ready to receive the activating cofactor, GTP...|$|E

50|$|The rebuilt station {{consisted}} of two through lines {{with the addition of}} a bay platform at the north end. A goods shed and yard were located to the west of the platforms. The main offices were located on the Up platform, consisting of a one and two storey ashlar building. The station was closed on 1 January 1968 and lay derelict for a number of years, though the double tracks into the bay platform remained and were used for <b>stabling</b> <b>empty</b> DMUs from time to time.|$|R

60|$|There was {{something}} in all this loneliness and wildness strangely pleasing to me. The great <b>stables,</b> <b>empty</b> and weather-broken, {{with the names of}} favorite horses over the vacant stalls; the windows bricked and boarded up; the broken roofs, garrisoned by rooks and jackdaws; all had a singularly forlorn appearance: one would have concluded the house to be totally uninhabited, were it not for a little thread of blue smoke, which now and then curled up like a corkscrew, from the centre of one of the wide chimneys, when my uncle's starveling meal was cooking.|$|R
25|$|This {{was part}} of the {{original}} proposal of 1911, and ran south from Eythorne before curving east to the colliery site on the edge of Waldershare deer park (the colliery was named after the owner of the park). Despite a full set of colliery buildings being provided and three shafts started, the whole colliery was abandoned by its French owners in 1922 before it produced any coal. A section of the branch near the junction was used for <b>stabling</b> <b>empty</b> wagons before the track was lifted in 1937, and this section was re-laid in the Second World War as a place for stabling the rail-guns.|$|R
5000|$|Currently, {{only the}} two through {{platforms}} are regularly used: the former Oldham bay platform is still available but is normally only for <b>stabling</b> <b>empty</b> stock or turning back late-running trains from the Todmorden direction. Terminating trains from Manchester and beyond use the stub of the former Oldham branch (which has {{been converted into a}} turnback siding) to reverse clear of the main line. Signalling at the station has also been modernised, with colour lights controlled from Castleton replacing the semaphores previously in use (the old signal box at Rochdale had to be demolished in 2011 as it stood in the alignment of the planned Metrolink flyover).|$|R

5|$|On {{the right}} of the {{entrance}} is the subway that links all the platforms, reached either by steps or lift; it houses the main public toilets, automated teller machines (ATM) and several catering outlets (there is catering on all platform islands except 13–15). A passenger information office and lounge are above the subway, the British Transport Police office and cycle racks are beyond, and at the western end is Platform 4, used by only a few trains. Alongside this is Platform 2, another bay platform but not signalled for passenger trains and used only for <b>stabling</b> <b>empty</b> trains, as is the former Motorail unloading bay alongside. At the far end of this track is the old Fish Dock, occasionally used for stabling engineers' on-track equipment. Beyond the end of the platform the tracks swing to the right (the west) and pass out of sight beneath Bath Road Bridge, a girder bridge that carries the A4 out of the city.|$|R

60|$|All the time, too, {{while he}} was {{injuring}} himself by this defect of temper, he was hurting his position by a silence, of which I scarce know whether {{to say it was}} the child of generosity or pride. The free-traders came again and again, bringing messengers from the Master, and none departed empty-handed. I never durst reason with Mr. Henry; he gave what was asked of him in a kind of noble rage. Perhaps because he knew he was by nature inclining to the parsimonious, he took a backforemost pleasure in the recklessness with which he supplied his brother's exigence. Perhaps the falsity of the position would have spurred a humbler man into the same excess. But the estate (if I may say so) groaned under it; our daily expenses were shorn lower and lower; the <b>stables</b> were <b>emptied,</b> all but four roadsters; servants were discharged, which raised a dreadful murmuring in the country, and heated up the old disfavour upon Mr. Henry; and at last the yearly visit to Edinburgh must be discontinued.|$|R
5000|$|The {{detective story}} arc begins when Penrod further immerses himself in fantasy by penning a hilarious bandit epic {{starring}} George B. Jashber, the [...] "notted detective." [...] In the first Penrod book, he was {{hard at work}} on this picaresque adventure novel, with heroic road agent Harold Ramorez menaced by corrupt police detectives. Over time, he comes to see detectives as more interesting, skews the novel toward the exploits of Jashber, and decides to become one. Imitating his movie heroes, he squints his eyes and talks {{out of the side of}} his mouth.

60|$|The {{next morning}} {{they set out}} again. George thought that fresh horses had been {{obtained}} in the night, because they drove at a rapid pace most of the day; and he was tired and sore with the jolting when they camped in another bluff at sunset. Two more days were spent {{in much the same}} way; and then late at night they stopped at a little building standing {{in the midst of an}} unbroken plain, and George was released and told to get out. One of the men lighted a lantern and led him into an <b>empty</b> <b>stable,</b> built of thick sods. It looked as if it had not been occupied for a long time, but part of it had been roughly boarded off, as if for a harness room or store.|$|R
60|$|Having {{seen the}} {{furniture}} sent off, Harry awaited {{the arrival of}} the Parliament bands, which he doubted not would be dispatched by the Puritans among the townspeople to the hall. The <b>stables</b> were already <b>empty</b> except for Rollo, Harry's own horse. This he had at once, the alarm being given, sent off to a farm a mile distant from the hall, and with it its saddle, bridle, and his arms, a brace of rare pistols, breast and back pieces, a steel cap with plumes, and his sword. It cost him an effort to part with the last, for he now carried it habitually. But he thought that it might be taken from him, and, moreover, he feared that he might be driven into drawing it, when the consequences might be serious, not only for himself, but for the mansion of which his father had left him in charge.|$|R
60|$|On the way {{the party}} overtook several of the cutters, and ten of them dashed up {{together}} in procession to the barn.

First of all the horses {{had to be put}} up in the <b>stables</b> and some <b>empty</b> barns, and when this was done the boys {{made their way to the}} place of assembly. Some forty young people were gathered there, all in the highest spirits. A great wood fire blazed at one end, and over it hung a huge cauldron of boiling water. Tables of boards and rough trestles were arranged down the side of the barn. They were covered with snowy table-cloths, on which were placed a great variety of eatables.|$|R
50|$|The {{station was}} built with yellow Crewe bricks and had four tracks running though the station. Two {{of the tracks}} which are not served by {{platforms}} were once used to stable Travelling Post Office carriages. There was also a twelve road engine shed, wagon repair shops, a coaling stage, a goods shed and a stable block, all built with local sandstone. In LMS days, a new turntable was installed behind the engine shed. In British Railways days the engine shed was rebuilt with a new roof and ferro-concrete coaling stage and an ash disposal plant was built near to the new turntable. The road approach to the station entrance was remodelled in BR days when the highways near to the station were upgraded. Immediately adjacent to the southbound platform are two carriage sidings, used for <b>stabling</b> & servicing <b>empty</b> DMU sets overnight and at weekends. There is also a train crew depot here.|$|R
40|$|A {{surface of}} {{constant}} mean curvature (CMC) equal to H in a sub-Riemannian 3 -manifold is strongly stable if it minimizes the functional area+ 2 H volume up to second order. In this paper we obtain some criteria ensuring strong stability of surfaces in Sasakian 3 -manifolds. We also produce new examples of C^ 1 complete CMC surfaces with empty singular {{set in the}} sub-Riemannian 3 -space forms by studying those ones containing a vertical line. As a consequence, {{we are able to}} find complete strongly stable non-vertical surfaces with empty singular set in the sub-Riemannian hyperbolic 3 -space M(- 1). In relation to the Bernstein problem in M(- 1) we discover strongly stable C^∞ entire minimal graphs in M(- 1) different from vertical planes. These examples are in clear contrast with the situation in the first Heisenberg group, where complete strongly <b>stable</b> surfaces with <b>empty</b> singular set are vertical planes. Finally, we analyze the strong stability of CMC surfaces of class C^ 2 and non-empty singular set in the sub-Riemannian 3 -space forms. When these surfaces have isolated singular points we deduce their strong stability even for variations moving the singular set. Comment: 24 page...|$|R
40|$|In the {{original}} stable marriage problem {{all the participants}} have to rank {{all members of the}} opposite party. Two variations for this problem allow for incomplete preference lists and ties in preferences. Most of the real-world matching problems allow for both types of relaxations. Finding a maximum cardinality solution for the stable matching problem with both ties and incomplete lists (SMTI) is NP-Complete and even the approximation is APX-hard. Finding an egalitarian solution for SMTI is also NP-Complete and APX-hard. If members from one side are allowed to form couples and submit combined preferences, then the set of stable matchings may be empty and determining if a market has any stable matchings is NP-Complete. Real-world applications of centralized matching need to provide a solution within a limited time. We propose a matching framework that always gives a solution. It is based on a genetic algorithm that uses intermediate or approximate solutions from other matching algorithms. We also give a broader definition for the core of marriage game, when the set of <b>stable</b> matchings is <b>empty</b> and it is necessary to use majority voting between matchings in a tournament. We use monotone systems based approach for tournament selection...|$|R
40|$|The {{structural}} {{properties of}} the uranium-encapsulated nano-cage U@Au 14 are predicted using density functional theory. The presence of the uranium atom makes the Au 14 structure more <b>stable</b> than the <b>empty</b> Au 14 -cage, with a triplet ground electronic state for U@Au 14. Analysis of the electronic structure shows that the two frontier single-occupied molecular orbital electrons of U@Au 14 mainly originate from the 5 f shell of the U atom after charge transfer. Meanwhile, the bonding orbitals have both the 5 f and 6 d components of the U atom, along with the 5 d and 6 s components of the Au atoms, indicating the covalent nature {{of the interaction between}} the U and Au atoms. Moreover, the charge population analysis shows that this nanostructure displays some unique electronic properties where the encapsulated atom gains electrons while the outer shell loses electrons. Therefore, this designed U@Au 14 nano-cage structure is stabilized by ionocovalent interactions. The current findings provide theoretical basis for future syntheses and further study of actinide doped gold nanoclusters, which might subsequently facilitate applications of such structure in radio-labeling, nanodrug carrier and other biomedical applications...|$|R
