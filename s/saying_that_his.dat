5|$|The San Francisco {{regulators}} {{finished their}} report in May 1987 and recommended that Lincoln be {{seized by the}} government due to unsound lending practices. Gray, whose time as chair was about to expire, deferred action on the report, <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> adversarial relationship with Keating would make any action he took seem vindictive, and that instead the incoming chair should take over the decision. Meanwhile, Keating {{filed a lawsuit against}} the FHLBB, saying it had leaked confidential information about Lincoln. The new FHLBB chair was M. Danny Wall, who was more sympathetic to Keating and took no action on the report, saying its evidence was insufficient. In September 1987, the Lincoln investigation was removed from the San Francisco group and in May 1988, the FHLBB signed an agreement with Lincoln that included not going ahead with a criminal referral to the Department of Justice.

5|$|In {{what was}} {{according}} to coach Lou Holtz a prearranged move, New York Jets rookie quarterback Richard Todd {{was replaced by}} Joe Namath {{late in the first}} quarter. Namath responded with a passing display that gave the Jets a 24–0 halftime lead. <b>Saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> players were “polite” to Namath, coach McKay compared the Buccaneers to a junior-high team, and said that the only thing they did better than the Jets was to be the first team on the field after halftime. Clark Gaines rushed for 103 yards for the Jets. The Buccaneers’ three quarterbacks combined for 171 yards passing, more than the Jets’ quarterbacks, but the Buccaneers failed to score for the fourth time in the season. As the score rose, the press box announcer began calling out records set during the game, which included the Jets’ first shutout in Shea Stadium. This was considered to be the Buccaneers’ last good chance to win a game, with the next four opponents all in playoff contention. The Jets’ 34 points were nearly a third of their season total of 110 after ten games, and a fifth of their season total of 169.|$|E
