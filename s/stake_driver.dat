He used his earnings from that summer and the following year to finance his college education, and {{he graduated from the}} University of California in 1881 with a mechanical engineering degree. He hired out with the Central Pacific Railroad and soon found himself working throughout Idaho, Utah and South Dakota as well as the California coast.|$|E
40|$|Theme EPrice {{influences}} the behaviour of people. It follows {{that the quality}} of a taxi service and the behaviour of the driver depends on the fare structure. This paper finds that the contribution approach to pricing as opposed to the cost plus pricing used universally can provide the ‘motivation handles’ to influence the behaviour of drivers, passengers and all stake holders. A real life example from Chennai, India is used to demonstrate a scientific fare structure. It is based on the four Ds of a fare mix: Distance, Duration, Drop and Discern. Such pricing granularity can be implemented with the advances in information and communication technology (ICT) of today. The transparency of the structure can balance the needs and costs of all the <b>stake</b> holders—passengers, <b>drivers,</b> other road users, owners, capital and society.

5000|$|The Driver is {{employed}} by James Brown, {{who goes to}} meet the Devil to re-negotiate the deal he made {{as a young man}} in 1954 to trade his soul for fame and fortune. He is worried about his ageing and the fact he can no longer do his moves like the splits, and says his lessened ability to perform means he cannot maintain his fame and fortune. He proposes a new wager, for the <b>stakes</b> of the <b>Driver's</b> soul against another 50 years for his career, betting on the Driver drag racing against the Devil's doorman/driver Bob on the Las Vegas Strip at dawn. The race ends with the Driver swerving to pass around a train while the Devil's car (a flamed Pontiac Firebird) crashes and explodes. Having won the race, the Driver leaves James Brown in the desert, but as he drives away he sees him as a young man again, who then does a handspring into the splits. The final scene shows Marilyn Manson who lives down the hall from the Devil, complaining that the noise is disturbing his Bible reading.|$|R
40|$|Ongoing {{change in}} both the {{university}} sector {{as a whole and}} within individual universities in relation to artistic research leads to continued uncertainty for the individual researcher as to where the hoop stands and what is involved in jumping through it. The incentive to frame arts practice as research is strong for academics in the creative arts where a research allocation and grants are at <b>stake.</b> However the <b>driver</b> for individual academics to maintain an arts practice can also be strongly linked to the need have currency, act as a role model and maintain “match fitness” in relation to undergraduate teaching. The distinction between art-practice-as-research and art-practice-in-itself (Borgdorff 2012) is manifest in the provision of the research statement for ERA, yet the guidelines for such statements are unclear. For example, what are effective measures of excellence when considering recorded music in an era where traditional distribution and marketing mechanisms are fast becoming redundant? In this paper, two academics working in a tertiary music program at a regional Australian university reflect on their experiences in navigating the shifting terrain of the notion of artistic research. The authors discuss their own creative practices and how these intersect with their teaching and research roles. They discuss how the university draws on artistic outputs and practices for marketing purposes. The authors suggest that the framing of art practice as research in every instance may be in part a response to the lack of recognition of the work involved in creating an “artistic output” within current university workload allocations. However there are implications here in terms of academics being funded to maintain professional practice that reach across many sectors (for example in education, health, business and law) that further complicate the issue...|$|R
