5000|$|In {{some years}} the <b>scarce</b> <b>swallowtail</b> is quite abundant. The <b>scarce</b> <b>swallowtail</b> is getting rarer as the {{blackthorn}} bushes are being cleared. The butterfly is now protected by {{law in the}} Czech Republic, Slovakia, Germany, Hungary, Luxembourg, Russia and Poland. It is considered rare and endangered and protected in some provinces of Austria and of indeterminate status throughout Europe. Though referred by some authorities to be of status [...] "vulnerable", it is however unlisted in the IUCN Red List.|$|E
50|$|The <b>scarce</b> <b>swallowtail</b> (Iphiclides podalirius) is a {{butterfly}} {{belonging to the}} family Papilionidae. It is also called the sail swallowtail or pear-tree swallowtail.|$|E
50|$|Iphiclides podalirius (Linnaeus, 1758), the <b>scarce</b> <b>swallowtail,</b> is a {{butterfly}} found in gardens, fields and open woodlands. It {{is found in}} places with sloe thickets and particularly orchards. It is widespread throughout Europe {{with the exception of}} the northern parts. Its range extends northwards to Saxony and central Poland and eastwards across Asia Minor and Transcaucasia as far as the Arabian Peninsula, India, and western China. The <b>scarce</b> <b>swallowtail</b> is getting rarer as due to loss of habitat and food plants. It is protected by law in some European countries. It is considered rare or endangered in some provinces of Austria and of indeterminate status throughout Europe.|$|E
50|$|Notable {{birds of}} the rock include the ortolan bunting, the scops-owl, the European nightjar, the short-toed snake eagle, the {{northern}} harrier and the woodlark. Notable insects include the <b>scarce</b> <b>swallowtail,</b> the praying mantis and the Mediterranean cricket.|$|E
50|$|Iphiclides podalirinus (Oberth√ºr, 1890), the Chinese <b>scarce</b> <b>swallowtail,</b> is {{a little-known}} species {{occurring}} in China, {{that was also}} previously considered a subspecies of I. podalirius. It is not known to be threatened but more data is required on this butterfly.|$|E
50|$|Approximately 1350 {{species of}} Micro- and Macrolepidoptera {{have been found}} in the Hundsheimer Berg nature reserve. Of these, 35 species have {{developed}} in or in the surroundings of the nature reserve. The remaining 1315 species represent almost 40% of the total butterfly and moth fauna of Lower Austria. In total 110 species have a high conservation value for Central Europe. Species include Ypsolopha sequella and <b>Scarce</b> <b>swallowtail.</b> Other notable animals are Saga pedo, European ground squirrel, Setina roscida and species of Megachile.|$|E
5000|$|Despite {{the common}} name ("scarce"), this species is quite common. The {{scarcity}} of UK migrants {{is responsible for}} the English common name. This species is widespread in the East Palearctic ecozone and in most of Europe {{with the exception of the}} northern parts. Its range extends northwards to Lower Lusatia and central Poland and eastwards across Asia Minor and Transcaucasia as far as the Arabian Peninsula, Pakistan, India and western China. [...] A few specimens of the <b>scarce</b> <b>swallowtail</b> have been reported from central Sweden and the UK but they were probably only strays and not migrants.|$|E
50|$|The {{caterpillars}} spin little pads on {{leaves and}} grip them firmly. The newly hatched caterpillar is dark in colour with two smaller and two bigger greenish patches on the dorsal side; later they are greenish with yellowish dorsal and side stripes. The summer chrysalids are green as a rule, the hibernating ones are brown. A number of hibernating chrysalids {{fall prey to}} various enemies. The caterpillars of the <b>scarce</b> <b>swallowtail</b> have been noted to leave silk trails from the permanent resting sites to feeding sites. This has been seen in both solitary and territorial larvae with larvae having the ability to discern their trails from those of others.|$|E
50|$|Mammals:The {{following}} {{descriptions of}} mammals of the Ammiq wetlands {{have all been}} recorded by A Rocha personnel in the Aammiq region from 1997 onwards. The region covered includes not just the valley floor wetlands but also the adjacent farmlands and the slopes of Mount Barouk. In addition to these, other mammal species are probably present but {{have not yet been}} positively identified. One mammal of interest is the European otter Lutra lutra which was reported in the Aammiq wetlands prior to 1975; its reappearance was confirmed in June 2003. Water buffalos were introduced to the swamp {{in order to maintain the}} health of the vegetation cover and the swamp itself, since buffalo graze wetlands in a more efficient way than other herbivores. The mammals recorded in the region include: southern white-breasted hedgehog (Erinaceus concolor), Cape hare (Lepus capensis), Caucasian squirrel (Sciurus anomalus), Indian porcupine (Hystrix indica), gray wolf (Canis lupus), red fox (Vulpes vulpes), European otter (Lutra lutra), European badger (Meles meles), striped hyena (Hyaena hyaena), mountain gazelle (Gazella gazella), wild boar (Sus scrofa). The area was probably also the home of some extinct mammals from Lebanon such as the Asiatic lion (Panthera leo persica), and the Asiatic cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus venaticus).Birds:Nearly 260 bird species have been recorded in the Aammiq region either by A Rocha personnel or people working with A Rocha from 1996 onwards. The Aammiq region includes not just the valley floor wetlands but also the adjacent farmlands and the sometimes wooded rocky slopes of Mount Barouk.The listing of these birds does not give any idea of their abundance or status. While some of the birds recorded below are residents, others are passage migrants. Some of these, such as the white stork and the lesser spotted eagle, may pass over Aammiq in flocks of hundreds at a time. Other migrants fly over in far smaller numbers. Species include: pygmy cormorant (Phalacrocorax pygmeus), white pelican (Pelecanus onocrotalus), greater flamingo (Phoenicopterus rubber), ferruginous duck (Aythya nyroca), osprey (Pandion haliaetus), Verreaux's eagle (Aquila verreauxii), peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus), common crane (Grus grus), rock pigeon (Columba livia).Amphibians and reptiles: The amphibians and reptiles listed below have been recorded in the Aammiq region either by A Rocha personnel or people working with A Rocha from 1996 onwards. As with the other species lists, the Aammiq region is here taken to include not just the valley floor wetlands, which are very rich in reptiles, but also the adjacent farmlands and the rocky slopes of Mount Barouk. Herpetology, the study of reptiles and amphibians, is a specialised field and as yet there has been no systematic A Rocha herpetological survey of this area. Far more species are known to exist in the area than the ones reported. Species include: European green toad (Bufo viridis), Levantine frog (Rana bedriagae), Levant green lizard (Lacerta media), European worm snake (Typhlops vermicularis), Levant viper (Macrovipera lebetina).Moths, butterflies, and dragonflies:As with many other groups, the moths of the Aammiq region are poorly known. The list below represents an incomplete and provisional list of species so far recorded, though the Aammiq region is rich in butterflies. A Rocha personnel recorded several new records of species since 1998 such as: Oriental marbled skipper (Carcharodus boeticus), swallowtail (Papilio machaon), <b>scarce</b> <b>swallowtail</b> (Iphiclides podalirius), false Apollo (Archon apollinus), large white (Pieris brassicae), plain tiger (Danaus chrysippus), long-tailed blue (Lampides boeticus). Also the Aammiq region has a surprising diversity of dragonflies which can be divided into two groups, the Zygoptera (damselflies) and the Anisoptera (the insects commonly referred to as dragonflies), species include: azure damselfly (Coenagrion puella), blue-tailed damselfly (Ischnura elegans), emperor dragonfly (Anax imperator), southern darter (Sympetrum meridionale), scarlet dragonfly (Crocothemis erythraea).|$|E
