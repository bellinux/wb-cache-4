40|$|Single {{filament}} testing protocols for polyacrylonitrile precursor and polyacrylonitrile-based {{carbon fibers}} {{have been developed}} to ensure reliable tensile results that can be compared to the standard testing protocols used by the industry. Accurate carbon fiber linear density measurement by vibroscope was quite sensitive to the pre-stress applied to the fiber. Gauge length dependence testing of the commercial carbon fibers exhibited that tensile strengths obtained at 25. 4 mm gauge length are comparable to those reported by the manufacturer using the standard <b>strand</b> <b>testing</b> results. On the other hand, experimental carbon fibers that have not been surface treated or sized, showed that single filament tensile strength values at 6 mm gauge length was comparable to the <b>strand</b> <b>testing</b> results. In addition, the compliance corrected tensile moduli of carbon fibers obtained by single filament tests were also comparable to the moduli obtained from the standard <b>strand</b> <b>testing</b> results. A modified Weibull analysis, which accounts for sample volume effects, has also been used to determine the Weibull modulus of both the commercial and experimental carbon fibers. close...|$|E
40|$|The study {{presented}} in this thesis investigated the flexural fatigue behaviour of non-corroded and corroded pretensioned beams and examined the use of externally bonded Carbon Fibre Reinforcement Polymer (CFRP) sheets as a repair technique aimed at restoring the loss in capacity due to corrosion. This was accomplished through an extensive experimental and analytical program. The experimental program was comprised of a material testing phase and a beam testing phase. The material testing phase consisted of testing seventy-two (72) material samples under monotonic and cyclic axial loading, full <b>strand</b> <b>testing,</b> and corrosion measurements of prestressing strands corroded while embedded in concrete prism. Material testing achieved multiple objectives: (a) it identified the rate of accelerated corrosion of the prestressing strands, (b) it quantified {{the distribution of the}} applied nominal tensile force among the seven wires within a single 7 -wire strand in a prestressed strand, (c) it determined the material fatigue properties, and the stress-strain behaviour of the strand wires, and (d) it quantified the stress concentration factor in the prestressing strand due to corrosion. The beam testing involved constructing thirty-seven (37) 3. 6 m long pretensioned T-beams and testing them in a four-point bending configuration. Twelve (12) beams were tested under monotonic loading, and twenty-five (25) beams were tested under cyclic loading. The main testing variables included: the corrosion level, the applied stress range, and a repair or the lack of it. Corrosion resulted in a significant deterioration of the monotonic and fatigue resistance of the beams in comparison to non-corroded beams, and repair using externally bonded CFRP sheet restored all or most of the monotonic and fatigue resistance lost due to corrosion. All beams failed by rupture of the prestressing strand. Inspection of the strand’s fracture surface showed signs of surface fretting. In addition, the fracture profile was similar to that reported by Toribio and Ovejero (2005) for hydrogen induced stress cracking of heavily cold drawn prestressing wires. Strands having corrosion levels of 5 % and 10 % by mass loss exhibited an overall section loss together with distinct deep corrosion pits. In the analysis phase, fatigue data measured from smooth axial samples taken from the centre wire of a prestrssing strand was used to model the fatigue behaviour of the outer wires of the 7 -wire prestressing strand for corroded and non-corroded pretensioned beams. Strain-based fracture mechanics was employed in all the analyses, which included the flexure fatigue behaviour of: non-corroded and corroded single prestressing wires-in-air, a full 7 -wire prestressing strand-in-air, and a non-corroded and corroded 7 -wire prestressing strand in a beam. The mode results correlated well with the observed experimental results. This thesis presents extensive experimental work, along with an in depth fatigue analysis that is based on material fatigue properties obtained from simple single wire cyclic testing. The resulting modelling approach offers a mechanistic explanation of 7 -wire prestressing strand failure under various conditions...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Objective Measurement of {{exercise}} capacity {{is essential in}} patients with non-specific chronic low back pain (CLBP). However, the conventional Å <b>strand</b> bicycle <b>test</b> is not feasible in patients with a very poor aerobic capacity. Therefore the Å <b>strand</b> bicycles <b>test</b> for non-spe-cific CLBP patients based on lean body mass (LBM) was developed as an alternative. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate reliability and validity of the LBM-based Å <b>strand</b> <b>test.</b> Subjects Twenty patients with non-specific CLBP and 20 healthy subjects were included for the reliability eval-uation, and 19 healthy subjects for the validity evaluation. Method Patients and healthy subjects were assessed twice. Intra class correlation (ICC), repeatability coefficient (RC) and the limits of agreement (LOA) were calculated as a measure of test re-tests reliability. An ICC C 0. 75 was considered acceptable. Validity was tested by calculating ICC between the LBM-based Å <b>strand</b> <b>test</b> and a maximal bicycle test. Results The LBM-based Å <b>strand</b> <b>test</b> shows good reliability, reflected by an ICC C 0. 91 and 95 % of the 20 patients could perform the test. However, differences with the estimated true value reflected by the RC and natural variation reflected by the LOA were substantial in patients. Validity was good, reflected by ICC C 0. 88. Conclusion The present study shows that the LBM-based Å <b>strand</b> <b>test</b> is a reliable, valid, and feasible method for patients with non-specific CLBP.

To ensure accurate and consistent measurement of the physical and superconducting properties of the composite <b>strand,</b> a <b>strand</b> <b>test</b> facility benchmarking effort was initiated in August 2008. The objectives of this effort are to assess and improve the superconducting <b>strand</b> <b>test</b> and sample preparation technologies at each DA and supplier, {{in preparation for the}} more than ten thousand samples that will be tested during ITER procurement. The present benchmarking includes tests for critical current (I-c), n-index, hysteresis loss (Q(hys)), residual resistivity ratio (RRR), strand diameter, Cu fraction, twist pitch, twist direction, and metal plating thickness (Cr or Ni). Nineteen participants from six parties (China, EU, Japan, South Korea, Russia, and the United States) have participated in the benchmarking. This round, conducted with a bronze-route Nb 3 Sn strand, involved samples prepared by a common laboratory (CERN) and sent out to the participants ("IO-prepared samples") and also samples prepared by each individual participant ("self-prepared samples"). I-c samples prepared and measured by CERN were found to have an average I-c of 188. 7 A and a standard deviation of 1. 8 A (1. 0 %), while those same set of samples measured by all the participating labs in round-robin fashion were found to have a standard deviation of 2. 1 A. Self-prepared samples had an average I-c of 188. 1 A, and showed a lab-to-lab standard deviation of 3. 5 A.

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of Civil EngineeringKyle A. RidingASTM {{recently}} {{adopted the}} Standard Test Method for Evaluating Bond of Seven-Wire Steel Prestressing Strand as ASTM A 1081, a pull-out test procedure developed for verifying {{the ability of}} steel strands to bond to cementitious materials prior to their use as tensile reinforcement in prestressed concrete sections. The required by ASTM International precision and bias statement has not been developed for this test method. In addition, a minimum threshold value that will ensure only adequately bonding strand sources will be accepted {{has not yet been}} applied to ASTM A 1081. The test method was developed after findings that prestressing steel strand sources of identical type and grade vary significantly as far as their bonding capacity. Bond is a crucial aspect of the prestressing force being transferred into the concrete, and insufficient bonding action can result in the prestressed concrete section lacking in capacity to sustain the loads that it was designed for. After an initial survey of the pull-out strength of North American Strand in mortar, three strands of differing pull-out strengths were selected for inclusion in further testing. A precision and bias statement for ASTM A 1081 was developed by first performing ruggedness testing to determine how the results are affected by allowable variations in methods and materials, and followed by an inter-laboratory study to determine the reproducibility of the test method. Once the precision and bias statement for the standard test method was developed, the same <b>strand</b> sources were <b>tested</b> for their performance in concrete beams.

PetermanAn {{experimental}} {{testing program}} {{was conducted at}} Kansas State University (KSU) to test the bond characteristics of various 5. 32 -mm-diameter steel wires and smaller diameter (less than 0. 5 in.) strands used in prestressed concrete railroad ties. A total of 13 wires and six strands produced by seven different steel manufacturers were used during this testing. Since no wire bond pullout test currently exists, one was developed and its validity tested. This un-tensioned pullout test {{could serve as a}} quality control test similar to the standard <b>test</b> for <b>strand</b> bond (ASTM A 1081) that has been developed for pretensioned <b>strands.</b> This <b>strand</b> <b>test</b> is currently not verified for strands less than 0. 5 -in. in diameter, so the procedure was also scrutinized using strands common in the concrete railroad tie industry. Some of the wires and strands contained surface indentations. It is generally accepted that indentations in the reinforcements improve the bond between the steel and concrete. To further complicate the issue, reinforcements with different surface conditions (rust, oils, lubricants) are allowed {{to be used in the}} concrete ties which further affects the bond quality of the reinforcements. However, no standardized indentation patterns (shape, size, depth of indent, etc.) or surface conditions (degree of rusting, amount of surface lubricants, etc.) are utilized by all wire and strand manufacturers. Thus, the corresponding bond behavior of these different reinforcements when placed in various concrete mixtures, in terms of average transfer lengths and typical variations, is essentially unknown. The purpose of this testing program was to develop (in the case of wires) or verify/develop (in the case of <b>strands)</b> a pullout <b>testing</b> procedure predictive of the reinforcement’s bond performance in a prestressed application.

A larger quench propagation velocity is preferable in order to prevent local temperature from being increased significantly. In a multi-strand cable whose strands are individually insulated, it has been reported that the quench propagation velocity increases by a current redistribution between strands. However, influences of current redistribution on a quench velocity for a cable made of non-insulated strands have not been studied. We examined the relations between the current redistribution and the quench propagation velocity in a Rutherford cable made of non-insulated strands. Measurements were performed in the cables with three contact conditions between strands, and it was found that the quench propagatin velocity and the current redistributions depended on the contact conditions between strands. A measurement was also performed in the cable without polyimide tape for the cable insulation, and we found that the polyimide tape also influenced on the quench propagation velocity. A numerical simulation of current redistribution using a simple model was performed. We made comparisons between the test and the numerical results, and there was good agreement each other. We analyzed the numerical results in detail, and we found that the current redistribution occurred around the quench front caused the incerase of the quench propagation velocity. Thesis (Ph.
