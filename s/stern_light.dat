5000|$|The Admiralty {{assigned}} the contract for Roebuck to Chatham Dockyard on 30 November 1769. Some {{seven years after}} the design was first produced, the Admiralty re-used {{it for a second}} batch of nineteen ships. The Admiralty ordered them to meet the particular requirements of the American War of Independence for vessels suitable for coastal warfare in the shallow seas off North America (where deeper two-deckers could not sail). The first five vessels of the class, and the later Guardian, had two rows of <b>stern</b> <b>lights</b> (windows), like larger two-deckers though actually there was just the single level of cabin behind. Most, if not all, of the other ships of the class - from Dolphin onwards - had a 'single level' frigate-type stern.|$|R

60|$|The first {{duty was}} {{to clear the}} decks of the dead. These were hastily sewn up in their own hammocks, {{with a couple of}} round shot at their feet, and then {{launched}} overboard. Those of the wounded able to walk were then mustered, and one of the French surgeons bandaged all the less serious wounds. After being supplied with a drink of wine and water, they were taken below, and placed with their companions in the hold. Then the wreck of the mizzen was cut away, and the frigate was taken in tow by the Agile, her own sails being left standing to relieve the strain on the hawsers. The two merchantmen were signalled to reduce sail, and to follow, and on no account to lose sight of the <b>stern</b> <b>light</b> of the frigate after it became dusk. Nat returned, with four of his crew, to the Agile, and four days later towed the Spartane into the anchorage off Bridgetown, the chief port of Barbados, the two West Indiamen following. The Isis, a fine fifty-gun frigate, was lying there. She had arrived on the previous day, having been despatched with the news of the outbreak of war. As her captain was evidently the senior officer on the station, Nat was rowed on board.|$|E

25|$|In April 1918, the airship NS-3 escorted {{a convoy}} for 55 hours, {{including}} patrols at night both {{with and without}} moonlight. In complete darkness the airship had to stay behind the ships and follow their <b>stern</b> <b>lights.</b> The only value in such patrols was in maximising useful daylight hours by having the airships already aloft at dawn. In July, the Antisubmarine Division and the Air Department of the Admiralty considered and rejected the use of searchlights during night, believing the airships would render themselves vulnerable to surfaced U-boats. Testing of searchlights on aircraft revealed that the bomb payload needed to be much reduced to accommodate searchlight systems. Parachute flares offered better illumination (and were less illuminating of the arships′ positions), but they weighed in at 80pounds each, making them too costly to drop unless the rough position of the enemy was already known. The Admiralty restricted the use of lights on airships for recognition, emergencies and under orders from senior naval officers only.|$|R
50|$|The yachts {{designed}} by Farr are primarily light-displacement, fractional rig, wide sterned, shallow hulled yachts.

His phlegm became him wonderfully. It made him look handsomer, he was so composed; it made his vicinage pleasant, it was so peace-restoring. You would not have thought, to look at him, that he was a poor, struggling man seated beside a rich woman; the calm of equality stilled his aspect; perhaps that calm, too, reigned in his soul. Now and then, from the way in which he looked down on Miss Keeldar as he addressed her, you would have fancied his station towered above hers as much as his stature did. Almost <b>stern</b> <b>lights</b> sometimes crossed his brow and gleamed in his eyes.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{document}} is to outline an approach to incorporating imperfect competition and increasing returns to scale into the SALTER model of global trade.

Mr. Griffeths advocated carrying the stem forward in a curved line, thereby lengthening the bow above water; he also introduced long, hollow water-lines and a general drawing out and sharpening of the forward body, bringing the greatest breadth further aft.
