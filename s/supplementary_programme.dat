40|$|The study {{set out to}} {{investigate}} the challenges faced by NGOs in carrying out <b>supplementary</b> feeding <b>programmes</b> in Zimbabwe’s rural areas. CARE and PLAN International in Zimbabwe were the two NGOs used as case studies and their operations in the Lower Gweru district of the Midlands Province Zimbabwe provided the empirical data for this study. This study was principally qualitative in nature as it sought to provide an in-depth analysis of the main challenges that NGOs face when carrying out <b>supplementary</b> feeding <b>programmes</b> {{in the rural areas}} of Zimbabwe. For the purpose of collecting data the study relied on Focus Group Discussions, in-depth interviews with key informants and document study. The key informants included Country Directors, Programme and Field officers at both CARE and PLAN International who had intimate knowledge of some of the challenges that their <b>supplementary</b> feeding <b>programmes</b> faced. Challenges that faced CARE and Plan International’s <b>supplementary</b> feeding <b>programmes</b> were categorized into two themes, internal and external organizational challenges. Internally the study revealed that the NGOs were unable to retain critical personnel such as nutritionists and programme officers. It also emerged from the study that field officers were involved in the thefts of food meant for the <b>supplementary</b> feeding <b>programmes.</b> The management of the <b>supplementary</b> feeding <b>programmes</b> was made difficult by lack of adequate information about the target beneficiaries. Further the study noted that there were contestations {{when it came to the}} selection of the beneficiaries of the programme. It was also found that during the rainy season it was difficult to 8 avail food timeously to the beneficiaries of the <b>supplementary</b> feeding <b>programmes.</b> It emerged from the study that <b>supplementary</b> feeding <b>programmes</b> were victims of political interference as the government and war veterans were suspicious that the programmes were being used to influence the voting behavior of the recipients. The global financial crisis also limited the capacity of the donors to continue availing substantial amounts of money for food procurement. As part of the broader strategy to increase the effectiveness of the NGOs in carrying <b>supplementary</b> feeding <b>programmes</b> this study recommended that NGOs should re-strategize on how they remunerate key personnel such as nutritionists. The NGOs through their mother body NANGO should constantly engage government so that there is a good working relationship supportive of poverty reduction through <b>supplementary</b> feeding <b>programme...</b>|$|R

40|$|A ’bokortanya’ is {{a special}} type of settlement, some {{examples}} of these can be found west of Nyíregyháza. At {{the beginning of the}} ’nought years’ we only saw mouldering ’bokors’, while today the situation is rather different. During this period the town development strategies, real infrastructural and other improvements and developments contributed to the actual social-economical revitalisation of the ’bokors’. During the past decades there have been changes. Significant differences emerged among the ’bokors’, the dying and outstanding settlements have started to become distinct. The functions of ’bokors’ have shifted, and the lifestyle of the inhabitants has changed, therefore these settlements have differentiated. Based on my research I have categorised them. Visiting ’bokors’ as a unique type of settlement can only be of interest for a small group of experts. It is not likely that ’bokors’ will appear as a tourist destination themselves; however, it is realistic to assume that they can provide a <b>supplementary</b> <b>programme</b> and accommodation for visits of other purposes. They can provide attraction and services that are a real experience for tourists. Tourism itself does not mean a complex solution for any of the ’bokors’at present; it may, however, provide a supplementary income source for the local population, and also make the landscape/settlements more attractive. They can make the opportunities in a town touristically developing more colourful and unique and Nyíregyháza can help improve them in this process...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the front part {{stiffness}} of modern vehicles, especially for the use {{in the field of}} forensic engineering in the traffic accident analysis. During the traffic accident analysis, an inquiry into the collision between vehicles is carried out which {{is an integral part of}} determining the energy loss of the vehicle at the impact, or more precisely the deformation energy expressed in the form of Energy Equivalent Speed (EES). In case of known stiffness of given part of the vehicle and based on the depth of deformation, it is possible to calculate the deformation energy, or more precisely EES corresponding with given damage of the vehicle. In the field of forensic engineering, the values of stiffness of individual vehicle components are not known and therefore, alternative methods are used to calculate the EES, they are outlined in the research part of this dissertation. However, the current methods of EES determination have some limitations when it comes to usability, and therefore, new EES calculation for the front part of the vehicle was designed in the research. It was based on the real crash test results using real stiffness characteristics of the front part of a vehicle. The front part of the vehicle is divided into individual areas and each of these parts is characterised by its own stiffness coefficient. The designed EES calculation can thus be also used for collisions with partial overlapping, taking into account the real stiffness of the damaged part of the vehicle, which was not possible with existing methods. In the research part of this dissertation, a computer programme to calculate deformation energy and EES was processed. It works with individual stiffness characteristics in given areas where the input data are entered by the user and include the depth of permanent front part deformation in individual areas, vehicle weight, the direction of an impact force and the friction coefficient on the contact surface. Considering the fact that the vehicle stiffness is also one of the control parameters at solving collisions in the PC-Crash simulation programme, which is used in forensic engineering practice for the analysis of a collision process, a supplementary computer programme was designed. Based on the above-mentioned input data, the <b>supplementary</b> <b>programme</b> can further calculate data for collision solving in the simulation programme, namely stiffness, restitution coefficient and the vehicle damage stated in the output report of the simulation programme. Based on these data, the expert thus has the opportunity to solve the collision of two vehicles in the simulation programme with as much preciseness as if it was a real collision...|$|E

40|$|International audienceOne of {{the most}} {{widespread}} tools in the conservation of scavenger species is the provision of supplementary food. However, scientific studies on its effectiveness have been rarely conducted. Here, we present the first results of an experimental specific <b>supplementary</b> feeding <b>programme</b> applied from hatching to 45 – 60  days, aimed at increasing the breeding success of an obligate brood reducer, the threatened bearded vulture. We tested its effectiveness in the Spanish Pyrenees, the locale {{of the most}} important population of this species in the European Union, in which a regressive trend in breeding parameters has been observed in recent years. We compared the breeding success in nests with supplementary food to non-supplemented control nests. Supplementary food did not significantly increase global breeding success (supplemented nests, 0. 793 [*]±[*] 0. 193 chicks per pair with eggs hatched vs non-supplemented nests, 0. 771 [*]±[*] 0. 185) or the individual breeding performance of the territories (supplemented period, 0. 712 [*]±[*] 0. 307 vs non-supplemented period, 0. 642 [*]±[*] 0. 311). The similar values obtained suggest that the specific <b>supplementary</b> feeding <b>programme</b> applied during the chick-rearing period is apparently ineffective at increasing breeding success. The results suggest that, at least in the study area, factors that provoke breeding failure after hatching continue to operate independently of the <b>supplementary</b> feeding <b>programme.</b> Although more research on this subject is required, these preliminary conclusions should be taken into account by managers in order to optimise the investment of economic resources and to better prioritise the future establishment of alternative conservation actions...|$|R
40|$|Background: Children with {{moderate}} acute malnutrition (MAM) {{have an increased}} risk of mortality, infections and impaired physical and cognitive development compared to well-nourished children. In parts of Ethiopia not considered chronically food insecure there are no <b>supplementary</b> feeding <b>programmes</b> (SFPs) for treating MAM.

Methods: We defined MAM as mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) of ≥ 11. 0 cm and < 12. 5 cm with no bilateral pitting oedema to include Ethiopian government and World Health Organisation cut-offs. We prospectively surveyed 884 children aged 6 – 59 months living with MAM in a rural area of Ethiopia not eligible for a <b>supplementary</b> feeding <b>programme.</b> Weekly home visits were made for seven months (28 weeks), covering the end of peak malnutrition through to the post-harvest period (the most food secure window), collecting anthropometric, socio-demographic and food security data.
