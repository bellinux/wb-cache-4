25|$|In {{order to}} secure his power, Díaz engaged in various forms of {{co-optation}} and coercion. He played his people like a board game – catering to the private desires of different interest groups and playing off one interest against another. In order to satisfy any competing forces, such as the Mestizos and wealthier indigenous people, he gave them political positions of power {{that they could not}} refuse. He did the <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> elite Creole society by not interfering with their wealth and haciendas. Covering both pro and anti-clerical elements, Díaz was both the head of the Freemasons in Mexico and an important advisor to the Catholic bishops. Díaz proved to be a different kind of liberal than those of the past. He neither assaulted the Church (like most liberals) nor protected the Church. As for the Native American population, who were historically repressed, they were almost completely depoliticized; neither put on a pedestal as the core of Mexican society nor suppressed, and were largely left to advance by their own means. In giving different groups with potential power a taste of what they wanted, Díaz created the illusion of democracy and quelled almost all competing forces.|$|E

And what happens to Neptune? He gets 'killed by ten million pounds of sludge from New York to New Jersey.' <b>Same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> [...] "creature in the sky," [...] who gets stuck up there in {{a hole in the}} ozone layer.

500|$|The single [...] "The Wire" [...] was {{released}} on July 29 and the album followed on September 30. The album reached {{number one in the}} UK and has since sold 200,000 copies there. To promote the album, the group performed [...] "The Wire" [...] on the BBC's The Andrew Marr Show, with Este dedicating the song to the British Prime Minister David Cameron, also a guest on the show. The move was criticised as being ill-judged by Johnny Marr, who stated that “It’s really simple: they made themselves look like idiots. It’s ridiculous. No-one put a gun to their head. The Conservatives tried to do the <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>with</b> <b>The</b> Smiths, to re-appropriate us in a false way, to be cool by association.” Haim did not respond.|$|E
2500|$|The film officially began {{principal}} {{photography in}} March 2010, {{but due to}} its large cast, producer/director Farrelly told Entertainment Weekly that [...] "This movie was made over four years, and they just {{had to wait for}} a year or two years for different actors.

50|$|In many {{languages}} nasalization of vowels {{would be}} a part of assimilation to the next consonant, but Omaha/Ponca is different because it is always assimilating. For example: iⁿdáthiⁿga, meaning mysterious, moves from a nasalized /i/ to an alveolar, stop. <b>Same</b> <b>thing</b> happens <b>with</b> <b>the</b> word iⁿshte, meaning, for example, has the nasalized /i/ which does not assimilate to another nasal.

50|$|In the {{orthorhombic}} system {{there is}} a second choice of crystal axes that results in a unit cell <b>with</b> <b>the</b> shape of a right rhombic prism, although this axis setting is very rarely used; this is because the rectangular two-dimensional base layers can also be described with rhombic axes.

50|$|The Shanghai Gesture is a 1941 American {{film noir}} {{directed}} by Josef von Sternberg and starring Gene Tierney, Walter Huston, Victor Mature, and Ona Munson.

"That {{is pretty}} nearly so," [...] Malcolm said; [...] "but at present the empress has bought off the Prussians, whose king {{joined in the}} affair solely for his own advantage, by giving him the {{province}} of Silesia, so that in fact at present it is England and Hanover, which is all the <b>same</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Dutch and Hessians, against France and Bavaria, for I don't think that at present Spain has sent any troops." ...|$|E

[...] "They run pretty nearly {{as fast as a}} horse can gallop, and they don't seem to fear death in the slightest, for they believe that if they are killed they go straight to heaven. It seems to me that savages must be braver than civilized soldiers.

25|$|The Tullahassee Mission {{continued}} to grow and do a job in educating {{the children of the}} Creek Nation until July 10, 1861, when it was suddenly closed due to the outbreak of the Civil War.

As the money passes from hand to hand, the same piece of money is laid out many times before all the things on sale at one time are purchased and finally removed from the market; and each pound or dollar must be counted for as many pounds or dollars as the number of times it changes hands in order to effect this object.|$|E
