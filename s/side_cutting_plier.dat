The borehole diameter {{was a little}} larger than the bit diameter due to side force. However, the reaming effect was not very apparent, whether drilling with an offset or conventional one-cone bit. The <b>side</b> <b>cutting</b> displacement increased gradually with increasing depth of drilling and side force. The <b>side</b> <b>cutting</b> displacement of offset one-cone bits was larger than that of conventional ones under the same conditions of weight-on-bit (WOB), rotary speed, side force and borehole depth.|$|R

Most in-situ cleavers use parallel cutting edges that are applied from two sides on the sample.

40|$|Abstract- The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the Single point cutting tool deflection due to cutting forces which were developed because of different parameters like feed, depth of cut, cutting speed and also because of geometrical parameters of <b>cutting</b> tool like <b>side</b> <b>cutting</b> edge angle and side rake angle and further comparing between side rake angle and <b>side</b> <b>cutting</b> edge angle. Firstly the cutting forces were measured using dynamometer which is taken from reference, then finite element method (FEM) was used to obtain the cutting tool deflection which is finite element analysis (FEA). The FEA results were then validated using cantilever beam model results. The predicted results from FEA were very close to the theoretical study.

40|$|For a {{solid carbide}} tapered end-mill, every flute {{includes}} a flute surface and a rake face along a helical <b>side</b> <b>cutting</b> edge, and the end-mill core {{is at the}} center and is tangent to all the flutes. The flutes significantly affect the tools cutting performance and life, and the core radius mainly affects the tools rigidity. Mainly, two methods are adopted in industry to grind the flutes; these are: the direct method and the inverse method. In the direct method, a flute is ground using a standard grinding-wheel moving in multi-axis machining to generate the rake face and the flute surface. However, the flute is the natural outcome of the grinding process without any control. On the other side, the inverse method employs the concept of inverse engineering to build a grinding-wheel that accurately grinds the end-mill flutes. This yields a free-form grinding-wheel profile that is used on a 2 -axis grinding machine; however, the flute shapes are only exact on one section of the end-mill; when the grinding-wheel moves along the <b>side</b> <b>cutting</b> edge to smaller sections; the deviation of the generated flute from the designed one will be increased. Thus, neither can this method grind the rake face with the prescribed normal rake angle, nor generate the <b>side</b> <b>cutting</b> edge in good agreement with its design. Moreover, the grinding-wheel profile is very difficult and expensive to make. To address these problems, a practical and optimal approach for five-axis grinding of prescribed end-mill flutes is proposed by; first, establishing a 5 -axis flute grinding theory describing the wheels locations and orientations during grinding the rake faces with constant normal rake angles; Second, introducing a simple grinding-wheel consisting of lines and circular arcs; and finally, applying an optimization algorithm to optimize the grinding-wheel shape and path. Overall, this approach significantly advances the CNC programming technique for the 5 -axis flute grinding, and can substantially increase the quality of the solid carbide end-mills and lays a good foundation for the CAD/CAE/CAM of end-mills. The advantages of this approach over the other approaches are verified using computer simulation...|$|R

30|$|These {{observations}} {{suggest that}} there are differences in hamstring and gastrocnemius muscle activities and in knee valgus angles between FFSs and RFSs. Therefore, we recommend that athletes practise the stop feint using FFS (toe contact). Authors investigating knee abduction torques during <b>side</b> <b>cutting</b> in handball players also recommended toe landings for prevention of ACL injuries [13]. Moreover, there were fewer toe landings associated with ACL ruptures. Toe landing improves the alignment of the leg and helps athletes avoid risky alignments that may lead to ACL injury [28]. The muscle activity results from the current study agree with those described for other related sports. Beyond developing quick and powerful hamstrings, the avoidance of heel strikes and incorporating toe-strike cutting is expected to reduce knee valgus angles and, in turn, prevent ACL injury.|$|R
