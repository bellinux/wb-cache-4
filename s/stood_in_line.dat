500|$|Following this hiatus {{the second}} phase of the battle began—if {{anything}} even more bloodily than the first. [...] The French only deployed a skirmish line against Abercrombie's brigade, so the weight of the renewed assault fell on Hoghton. Despite being joined by the sole survivors of Colborne's brigade (the 31st Foot), just 1,900 men <b>stood</b> <b>in</b> <b>line</b> to face the advancing corps. [...] Hoghton's three battalions (the 29th Regiment of Foot, 1/48th Regiment of Foot and 1/57th Regiment of Foot), suffered huge casualties, with 56 officers and 971 men killed or wounded from their complement of 95 officers and 1,556 men.|$|E

500|$|The Prussian {{infantry}} marched southward, remaining out of Austrian sight, {{behind a}} line of low hills. When {{the heads of the}} two superbly drilled Prussian columns—the distances between the marching platoons remaining exactly the width of each platoon's front—had passed the Austrian left flank, the columns veered left toward the enemy and continued their march until they had passed beyond the left Austrian flank. Then, on command, the platoons of the columns faced left at Lobetinz, and the whole Prussian army <b>stood</b> <b>in</b> <b>line</b> of battle, two to three men deep, at nearly a right angle to the weakest point of the Austrian left. Similarly, Hans Joachim von Zieten's cavalry had traversed the entire Austrian front, and positioned itself at a 45-degree angle to the Austrian flank. [...] The Prussian artillery perched the reverse slopes of the Butterberg, hidden from Austrian view but prepared to move to the crest to time their bombardment with the infantry's attack. The bulk of the repositioned Prussian army now faced the smallest component of the Austrian line. The one column of Prussian cavalry and the small reserve of infantry remaining at the Austrian far right continued to demonstrate in front of the Austrians, even moving further north, as if an attack would occur at that position.|$|E

In 1841, William Watson Waldron of Trinity College, Dublin, in Ireland, published Pocahontas, American Princess: and Other Poems, calling Pocahontas [...] "the beloved and only surviving daughter of the king". Indeed, Pocahontas was a favorite of her father's—his [...] "delight and darling", according to the colonist Captain Ralph Hamor—but she was not in line to inherit a position as a weroance, subchief, or mamanatowick (paramount chief).

On each saddle cloth, in similar positions, lay each man’s full equipment of about 25 separate items, all cleaned and polished up to the nines—saddles, stirrups and irons, bridles and bits, water bottles, feed bags, greatcoats, saddle bags, dixies, etc. etc." [...] On Friday 17 August, the Division moved back to El Fukhan.

[...] Stone was cast for a brief role in Allen's Stardust Memories (1980), and then had a speaking part a year later in the horror film Deadly Blessing (1981). French director Claude Lelouch cast her in Les Uns et les Autres (1982), starring James Caan. She was on screen for two minutes and did {{not appear in the}} credits. On December 4, 1982, she played a ditsy bimbo meter maid in the first season of the television series [...] Silver Spoons.

Editor Mel Toadvine asked her why she took so much time to sign autographs while more than 100 people <b>stood</b> <b>in</b> <b>line</b> {{all the way to the}} front of the Wicomico Youth and Civic Center. [...] "These people are my fans... I'll stay here until the very last one wants my autograph. Without these people, I am nobody. I love these people", she told Toadvine. In 1979, she became the spokesperson for Procter & Gamble's Crisco oil and did TV commercials and print ads for them for a decade, ending in 1989.

2500|$|The {{sacrificial}} service {{took place}} in the courtyard of the Temple at Jerusalem. Strictly speaking, slaughtering could be performed by a layman, but in practice was performed by priests. [...] The blood had to be collected by a priest, and rows of priests with gold or silver cups in their hands <b>stood</b> <b>in</b> <b>line</b> from the Temple court to the altar, where the blood was sprinkled. These cups were rounded on the bottom, so that they could not be set down; for in that case the blood might coagulate. The priest who caught the blood as it dropped from the animal then handed the cup to the priest next to him, receiving from him an empty one, and the full cup was passed along the line until it reached the last priest, who sprinkled its contents on the altar. The lamb was then hung upon special hooks or sticks and skinned; but if the eve of the Passover fell on a Sabbath, the skin was removed down to the breast only. The abdomen was then cut open, and the fatty portions intended for the altar were taken out, placed in a vessel, salted, and offered by the priest on the altar, while the remaining entrails likewise were taken out and cleansed.|$|E
