40|$|The paper {{studies the}} effect of the market's perceivedexchange rate {{volatility}} on bid-ask <b>spreads.</b> <b>The</b> anticipated volatility is extracted from currency options data. An increase in the perceived volatility is found to widen bid-ask <b>spreads.</b> <b>The</b> direction of the effect is consistent with an option model of <b>the</b> <b>spread,</b> but <b>the</b> magnitude is smaller. Anincrease in trading volume of spot exchange rates also widens <b>the</b> <b>spread.</b> <b>The</b> omission of the trading volume, however, does not bias the estimate of {{the effect of}} the volatility on <b>the</b> <b>spreads.</b> Althoughthe spread-volatility relation implied by the option model of <b>the</b> <b>spread</b> is close to linear, some foim of nonlinearity can still be detected from the data...|$|R

5|$|This {{increased}} severity {{has been}} attributed to the circumstances of the First World War. In civilian life, natural selection favours a mild strain. Those who get very ill stay home, and those mildly ill continue with their lives, preferentially <b>spreading</b> <b>the</b> mild strain. In the trenches, natural selection was reversed. Soldiers with a mild strain stayed where they were, while the severely ill were sent on crowded trains to crowded field hospitals, <b>spreading</b> <b>the</b> deadlier virus. The second wave began and the flu quickly spread around the world again. Consequently, during modern pandemics health officials pay attention when the virus reaches places with social upheaval (looking for deadlier strains of the virus).|$|E

5|$|A general {{hospital}} {{is located in}} {{the eastern side of the}} city. Modern health care facilities exist only in Bangui but are poor, providing only minimal care. Wealthier citizens make use of private clinics. The risk of catching HIV in the city is reportedly high, and many truck drivers stopping in the city for sexual services pose a major risk of <b>spreading</b> <b>the</b> disease to other parts of the country. The risk of catching malaria in Bangui and pygmy camps is also much higher than in the rest of the country.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the results}} of this {{experiment}} were accurate, Fricke misinterpreted the data to mean that the cell membrane is a single molecular layer. Prof. Dr. Evert Gorter (1881–1954) and F. Grendel of Leiden University approached the problem from a different perspective, <b>spreading</b> <b>the</b> erythrocyte lipids as a monolayer on a Langmuir-Blodgett trough. When they compared the area of the monolayer to the surface area of the cells, they found a ratio of two to one. Later analyses showed several errors and incorrect assumptions with this experiment but, serendipitously, these errors canceled out and from this flawed data Gorter and Grendel drew the correct conclusion- that the cell membrane is a lipid bilayer.|$|E
5|$|Aside from Rock Steady Crew, several {{breaking}} {{crews were}} active in the 1970s such as Mighty Zulu Kings, Dynamic Rockers, New York City Breakers, SalSoul, Air Force Crew, Crazy Commanders Crew, Starchild La Rock, and Rockwell Association. In the same way b-boy crews were active {{on the east coast}} of the United States spreading breaking throughout New York, funk crews were also active on the west coast <b>spreading</b> <b>the</b> funk styles throughout California. Aside from The Lockers and The Electric Boogaloos, other funk styles crews such as Medea Sirkas/Demons of the Mind, Black Messengers, The Robot Brothers, The Go-Go Brothers, Granny and Robotroid, and Chain Reaction were active during the 1970s performing on stage.|$|E
5|$|During {{the height}} of the typhoon at Cabras Island on Guam, a {{gasoline}} tank caught fire, believed to be from friction caused by extremely high winds running through its ventilation system. The tank exploded, sending its lid airborne and <b>spreading</b> <b>the</b> fire to other nearby tanks. The proximity of the tanks as well as low water pressure hampered firefighting efforts, and the fire was extinguished five days later; it resulted in three destroyed gasoline tanks with two more caught on fire. While the fire was burning, transportation of gasoline from the port to the rest of Guam was suspended resulting in a halt in gasoline sales for the general public.|$|E

The next year was much more successful, as in Moldavia in 1595 he was victorious in the Battle of Cecora, and helped hospodar Ieremia Movilă (Jeremi Mohyła) gain the throne. In 1600 he fought against Michael the Brave (Michał Waleczny, Mihai Viteazul), hospodar of Wallachia and the new Prince of Transylvania, who had conquered Moldavia a few months earlier. He defeated him on the Bukova (Bucovu) and restored Ieremia to the throne. He also helped his brother, Simion Movilă to become brief ruler of Wallachia, thus <b>spreading</b> <b>the</b> influence of the Commonwealth to the Central Danube.|$|E

5|$|In July 2009, {{the song}} was offered as a free {{download}} on Kesha's MySpace page for over a month before its official sale release. The song was later released to iTunes on August 7, 2009, and on August 25, 2009, in the United States. Barry Weiss of RCA/Jive Label Group relied on a similar marketing scheme to that of Britney Spears' in 1999 when choosing to give the song away for free. The song's marketing relied heavily on radio once she had achieved a strong online interest, but its radio release was delayed until October in order to capitalize on social media's interest in her.

40|$|ABSTRACT. <b>The</b> notion <b>the</b> <b>spread</b> of {{a matrix}} was first {{introduced}} fifty years ago in algebra. In this article, we define <b>the</b> <b>spread</b> of <b>the</b> shape operator by applying the same idea to submanifolds of Riemannian manifolds. We prove that <b>the</b> <b>spread</b> of shape operator is a conformal invariant for any submanifold in a Riemannian manifold. Then, we prove that, for a compact submanifold of a Riemannian manifold, <b>the</b> <b>spread</b> of <b>the</b> shape operator is bounded above by a geometric quantity proportional to the Willmore-Chen functional. For a complete non-compact submanifold, we establish a relationship between <b>the</b> <b>spread</b> of <b>the</b> shape operator and the Willmore-Chen functional. In the last section, we obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for a surface of rotation to have finite integral of <b>the</b> <b>spread</b> of <b>the</b> shape operator...|$|R
