40|$|Introduction: Regarding the {{numerous}} problems of solderers in electronic industries {{because of their}} exposure to Acids, bases and fumes of soldering,a study was carried out on 107 solderers and administrative personels of a factory producing electronic appliances in Tehran to inspect the long term effects of soldering on lung functions Inspection. Methods: At first, 47 solderers and 66 controls (totally 107 persons) were selected randomly. All the solderers were working in the manual soldering section and used the soldering wire made of an alloy (composed of plumbum, Stannum and special oil of soldering called flux). The persons controls worked in the administrative sections of the same factory and for the same hours as the solderers, {{but they did not}} have any soldering experience. After they filled the standard respiratory questionnaire, spirometry was done at least 3 times on each of them under the same conditions and according to the ACT criteria (No smokers included in the study) Results:The spirometry parameters of the two groups were compared. There was {{a significant difference in the}} average FEF 25 : 75 % (P= 0. 03). Also,there was a significant difference in the average FEV 1 /FVC P= 0. 026 and PEFR (P= 0. 04) between two groups. After controling the altering age factor. ameaningful relation between the years of work in soldering section and decrease in the spirometry parameters related to FED 25 - 75 % and FEV 1 /FVC was seem. Also. the frequency of the signs of nasal and eyes initation in the <b>solderer</b> group was more than the other group (p= 0. 007) Cough and Asthma related to ork had no meaningful difference in the two groups. Conclsion :It seem that in the above study, soldering is a factor decreasing the spirometry parameters with a blocking pattern, especilly in smal airways. This study was done in the direction of the former studies done in other countries and emphasizes on the need for necessary preventive action in this profession, uch as effective local ventilation and use of alternative substances...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Twenty-one high {{frequency}} <b>solderers,</b> {{who had been}} exposed to cadmium (Cd) from a solder for periods ranging from 1 month to 18 years (median 8 months; present time-weighted average 30 nmol/m 3; particle size below 1 μm) had Cd levels ranging from < 10 to 440 nmol/l in blood and from < 0 · 5 to 27 μmol/mol creatinine in urine. Individual workers showed considerable variations in blood Cd levels with time, but less variation in urine levels. There was a statistically significant (p < 0 · 001) increase of Cd in urine with increasing exposure time. Four gas <b>solderers,</b> who had been intermittently exposed for 8 - 20 years (median 17 years) had Cd levels ranging from 45 to 150 nmol/l and urine levels of from 2 to 20 μmol/mol creatinine. There was no correlation between Cd levels in blood and urine during exposure. After exposure had ceased there was a considerable decay of blood Cd in most subjects. The half-time in 11 people ranged from 25 to 146 days (median 41 days). After the decay blood levels reached a steady state. Concentrations in urine did not decrease, or did so only very slowly. There was a significant increase of levels in urine (p < 0 · 001) with increasing post-decay levels in blood. There was also a significant increase (0 · 01 < p < 0 · 05) of excretion of ß 2 -microglobulin in urine (range 1 · 1 - 18 mg/mol creatinine, median 4 · 7 mg/mol creatinine) measured 11 - 15 months after exposure had ceased, with increasing Cd levels in urine. This may indicate an effect on renal tubular function even at kidney Cd loads corresponding to Cd levels in urine of the order of as little as 10 μmol/mol creatinine...|$|R
40|$|Hand {{soldering}} is {{an essential}} operation in electronic component development at the Naval Weapons Center.

40|$|A {{total of}} 1611 women {{working in a}} large {{electronics}} company were interviewed using {{a modified version of}} the Medical Research Council's questionnaire on respiratory symptoms, and their lung function was tested using a Vitalograph dry wedge spirometer. When the prevalence of symptoms was compared using the chi 2 test among four occupational groups [...] namely, <b>solderers,</b> ex-solderers, non-solderers, and office workers [...] few significant differences were found. The group of ex-solderers tended to have a greater prevalence of symptoms than the other three groups. Forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) were measured, and when these were compared for smokers, the office workers were found to have a greater mean age adjusted FVC and FEV 1 than the three other groups. The pattern was less distinct for non-smokers. When duration of exposure to solder fumes was allowed for, differences in lung function were more suggestive of being related to smoking habit than occupational exposure to solder fumes...|$|R

40|$|Objectives Recent {{studies suggest}} {{adverse health effects}} after low {{exposure}} to cadmium (Cd). Brazing with Cd-containing solder exposes workers to Cd. The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess: (1) indicators of Cd exposure in blood (Cd-B) / urine (Cd-U); (2) the association between Cd-B, Cd-U and renal and oxidative stress biomarkers. Methods In this cross-sectional study Cd-B, Cd-U, renal (ie, N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase/urinary intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP) /microalbumin/beta- 2 -microglobulin/retinol binding protein and oxidative stress markers (ie, derivatives of reactive oxygen metabolites/glutathione peroxidase/superoxide dismutase (SOD) / advanced oxidation protein products/ 8 -hydroxy- 2 ′-deoxyguanosin/ 8 -isoprostanes) were determined in 36 <b>solderers.</b> Results Multiple linear regression analysis adjusting for age and pack-years of smoking show that IAP is statistically significantly associated with Cd-B (B= 0. 24; SE= 0. 11) and Cd-U (B= 0. 15; SE= 0. 07). Also SOD is statistically significantly associated with Cd-B (B= 62. 96; SE= 29. 62). The association between SOD and Cd-U is of borderline statistical significance (B= 37. 69; SE= 19. 59). Conclusions While there is still some debate as whether the Cd-induced tubular effects are reversible or not, IAP and SOD appear as sensitive and potentially useful early biomarkers for the health surveillance of workers exposed to low levels of Cd...|$|R
40|$|The cadmium body burden, {{blood and}} urine cadmium concentrations, and renal {{function}} were studied {{in a group}} of 53 cadmium <b>solderers.</b> The results showed raised blood and urine cadmium concentrations and raised cadmium body burden in all workers (31) with more than five years exposure, with 27 having urine cadmium concentrations in excess of the proposed biological threshold of 10 nmol/mmol creatinine. Renal tubular dysfunction was found in 17 of the subjects with more than five years exposure and in one this was associated with glomerular dysfunction. These data indicate that cadmium body burden and frequency of tubular dysfunction in end users of cadmium may be as high as those found in smelters or production workers. Subjects with tubular dysfunction did not show greatly increased urine cadmium concentrations compared with those without dysfunction, supporting a previous suggestion that tubular dysfunction occurs before the wash out of cadmium from the kidney. At the time of our study, cadmium exposure stopped as cadmium free soldering rods were introduced. Repeat urine samples from 19 subjects, one to two years after exposure ended indicated that there was no further increase in the level of excretion of low molecular weight proteins, perhaps indicating that the tubular proteinuria does not increase or more severe renal dysfunction develop without continuous exposure...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] to {{evaluate}} the degree of cadmium induced glomerular impairment and to assess the dose-response relation between cadmium dose and the prevalence of glomerular dysfunction. METHODS [...] A comparison of glomerular filtration rates (GFR) assessed by Cr-EDTA clearance was made in 42 <b>solderers</b> previously exposed to cadmium {{for at least five}} years. Blood and urine data were collected at health examinations in 1984, 1989, and 1993. Individual doses of cadmium were estimated by analysing cadmium in blood. RESULTS [...] Glomerular lesions induced by cadmium are irreversible and the GFR decreases with the degree of tubular damage. The GFR also decreases with cadmium dose and there is a dose-response relation between blood cadmium and prevalence of glomerular damage with 3. 4 % prevalence at blood cadmium concentrations below 50 nmol/l, 33 % at blood cadmium concentrations between 50 and 75 nmol/l and 100 % prevalence of glomerular damage when cadmium in blood exceeds 75 nmol/l. CONCLUSIONS [...] The kidney lesions induced by cadmium are irreversible and the prevalence of those lesions are dose dependent. There is also evidence of a dose related decrease in GFR even a long time after the end of exposure. Exposure to cadmium should therefore be minimised and workers exposed to cadmium should be examined regularly for many {{years after the end of}} exposure...|$|R
40|$|The zinc protoporphyrin/haemoglobin (ZPP/Hb) {{ratio was}} {{measured}} in the field with a haematofluorometer. A significant increase in ZPP/Hb ratio with advancing age was found in 1295 men who denied any excess exposure to lead. Ninety-seven per cent of the results were below 110 mumol ZPP/mol Hb(Fe) (4. 4 microgram ZPP/g Hb). The ZPP/Hb ratio was determined in a lead-exposed population of 2275 men, and in 305 a blood lead analysis was also performed. A blood lead limit of 2. 9 mumol/l (60 microgram/ 100 ml) corresponds to about 500 mumol ZPP/mol Hb(Fe) (20 microgram/g). This limit was exceeded in workers engaged in secondary lead smelting, storage battery manufacture, car radiator repair, crystal glass manufacture, storage battery repair, ship breaking, metal foundries, the ceramic industry, scrap metal handling, and PVC plastic manufacture. Other occupations caused lower lead exposures with ZPP/Hb ratios between 110 and 500 mumol ZPP/mol Hb(Fe) : such ratios were found in men from shooting ranges, in leaded pane manufacturers, gunsmiths, car paint sprayers, type setters, steel rolling mill workers, shipbuilders and welders, car mechanics, lead pigment handlers, and <b>solderers.</b> Increased ZPP/Hb ratios and blood lead levels in 210 workers were associated with a decrease in haemoglobin concentration in the blood. Thus, the haematofluorometer {{has proved to be}} very useful for screening purposes. A blood lead determination should be performed if the ZPP/Hb ratio exceeds 300 microgram ZPP/mol Hb(Fe) (12 microgram/g) ...|$|R
40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVE [...] To {{estimate}} {{the incidence of}} occupational asthma seen by respiratory and occupational physicians in the UK in 1989 and 1990. DESIGN [...] New cases of occupational asthma were taken from a national reporting scheme, the Surveillance of Work-related and Occupational Respiratory Disease Project (SWORD). Estimates of the working population from the Labour Force Survey were used to calculate reported incidence by age group, sex, occupation, and region. SETTING [...] The SWORD project is a scheme for the reporting of new cases of work-related respiratory disease by thoracic and occupational physicians from throughout the UK which began in 1989. PATIENTS [...] In 1989 and 1990, of 4229 cases reported, 1085 (26 %) were in patients with occupational asthma. MAIN RESULTS [...] Only half the reported cases were attributed to agents prescribed under the Industrial Injuries Scheme. There was considerable diversity in risk by occupation, with highest annual rates in welders, <b>solderers,</b> and electronic assemblers (175 /million), laboratory workers (188 /million), metal treaters (267 /million), bakers (334 /million), plastics workers (337 /million), chemical processors (364 /million), and spray painters (658 /million). Crude rates in men were higher than in women, but rates within occupations were similar in both sexes. Rates of disease rose with age; adjustment for occupation increased the gradient. Regional differences were only partly explained by diversity of industry and were probably mainly due to variation in levels of ascertainment and reporting. CONCLUSIONS [...] Asthma is the most commonly reported occupational lung disease in the UK. The incidence {{in the general population}} is unknown, but it was estimated that the incidence of new cases seen by respiratory and occupational physicians was about three times that reported. High relative risks were found in a number of occupations in which effective control of the work environment is urgently required...|$|R
