Davis stated that Wood was not present during the autopsy and did not consult him when she signed the autopsy.|$|E
25|$|According to al-Kindi, {{the goal}} of metaphysics is the {{knowledge}} of God. For this reason, he {{does not make a}} clear distinction between philosophy and theology, because he believes they are both concerned with the same subject. Later philosophers, particularly al-Farabi and Avicenna, would <b>strongly</b> <b>disagree</b> with him on this issue, by saying that metaphysics is actually concerned with being qua being, and as such, the nature of God is purely incidental.|$|E
500|$|Andreas Heldal-Lund, {{founder of}} the Scientology-critical website and {{non-profit}} organization Operation Clambake, released a statement criticizing the digital assault against Scientology. Heldal-Lund commented, [...] "People {{should be able to}} have easy access to both sides and make up their own opinions. Freedom of speech means we need to allow all to speak - including those we <b>strongly</b> <b>disagree</b> with. I am of the opinion that the Church of Scientology is a criminal organisation and a cult which is designed by its delusional founder to abuse people. I am still committed to fight for their right to speak their opinion." [...] He also stated that [...] "Attacking Scientology like that will just make them play the religious persecution card ... They will use it to defend their own counter actions when they try to shatter criticism and crush critics without mercy." ...|$|E

500|$|Following the {{approval}} of Sinclair's purchase of Allbritton, commissioner Ajit Pai further criticized the FCC's new policies and its endorsement of Sinclair's proposal to shut down stations to comply with them. Describing the three Allbritton stations as being [...] "victims" [...] of the [...] "crackdown" [...] against joint sales agreements, he stated regarding WCIV that [...] "apparently the Commission believes {{that it is better}} for that station to go out of business than for Howard Stirk Holdings to own the station and participate in a joint sales agreement with Sinclair. I <b>strongly</b> <b>disagree.</b> And so too, I'll bet, would consumers in Charleston." [...] In September 2014, Sinclair backtracked on its original plans, and reached deals to sell WCIV, WCFT and WJSU's license assets to Howard Stirk Holdings for $50,000 each and lease them studio space, pending FCC approval. Unlike Howard Stirk Holdings' other stations, they are operated and programmed independently, and Sinclair did not enter into any agreements to operate the stations on HSH's behalf.|$|E
500|$|Constantine began co-hosting What Not to Wear with Trinny Woodall in 2001, which {{required}} using her fashion advice and expertise {{in order to}} reform participants' appearances and fashion style. Constantine and Woodall hosted What Not to Wear until 2005 and became renowned for their tactile behaviour with the participants, direct advice, and frequently referring to breasts as tits which {{has become something of}} a trademark. Never one to hold back, a notorious moment arose when Constantine spontaneously pulled a female candidate's underwear down during filming as her knicker line was visible. Critics of What Not to Wear argued that the duo were too patronising to their subjects, a claim which they <b>strongly</b> <b>disagree</b> with. Constantine insists that their subjects [...] "see we have a genuine love of women. We love women and they can see that. Women just know." [...] She also stated [...] "Ultimately, what we're doing is giving people confidence. We're probably the only people who have an opinion, who care how ordinary people dress. No one at Vogue magazine gives a shit. They work with the designers, it's more creative and artistic – they are creating something beautiful. But they don't care about how their readers end up looking – whereas we do!" [...] The show made Constantine and Woodall household names and they are now known together as Trinny and Susannah. One reporter has simply referred to Constantine as [...] "the one with 'big tits'." [...] Constantine and Woodall have even considered taking insurance out on their partnership should something unforeseen happen, although Constantine was against the move.|$|E

[...] Obama said in response that, [...] "I strongly believe that African Americans and the LGBT community must stand together {{in the fight for}} equal rights.

2500|$|While {{both social}} anarchists and Marxists {{share the same}} final goal, the {{creation}} of a free, egalitarian society without social classes and government, they <b>strongly</b> <b>disagree</b> on how to achieve this goal. Anarchists believe that the classless, stateless society should be established by the direct action of the masses, culminating in social revolution, and refuse any intermediate stage such as the dictatorship of the proletariat, on the basis that such a dictatorship will become a self-perpetuating fundament. For Bakunin, the fundamental contradiction is that for the Marxists, [...] "anarchism or freedom is the aim, while the state and dictatorship is the means, and so, in order to free the masses, they have first to be enslaved." ...|$|E

Republican Representative Mike Pence urged Mourdock to apologize, {{and said in a}} statement, [...] "I <b>strongly</b> <b>disagree</b> with the statement made by Richard Mourdock during last night's Senate debate".

2500|$|The Connectedness to Nature Scale (CNS). This scale {{measures}} how emotionally {{connected people}} feel {{to the natural}} world, animals, and plants. It also assesses people's perceived equality between nature and themselves. An example of an item is [...] "I recognize and appreciate the intelligence of other living organisms." [...] These items are rated on a Likert scale from 1 (<b>strongly</b> <b>disagree)</b> to 5 (strongly agree) where higher scores demonstrate a higher connection to nature. This scale can be used both at the trait and state level. The state version is 13-items and shows acceptable reliability (α = [...]91,). The trait version is 14-items and also demonstrates good reliability (α = [...]82). This scale's validity is demonstrated by its positive associations with other environmental scales (such as the New Ecological Paradigm Scale) but is not associated with verbal ability or social desirability.
