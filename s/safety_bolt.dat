Finally, a three-position safety allowed the bolt to be operated while the gun was still on safe, making unloading of the rifle less hazardous. Ruger also eliminated the adjustable trigger that came stock on the original M77.|$|E

50|$|The Remington Model 51 uses an {{internal}} hammer and features a single-action trigger. A unique combination lever {{on the rear}} of the grip-frame acts as a <b>safety,</b> <b>bolt</b> hold-open device and bolt release. This is in addition to the grip safety, magazine safety disconnect, and relatively heavy trigger pull. The grips are held on with spring-tensioned studs rather than screws. Not a single screw is used in the entire pistol. Pedersen was greatly concerned with human engineering and developing a comfortable grip angle for his pistol while not sacrificing the slim profile. Field stripping the pistol is cumbersome but not overly complicated and is mastered with practice.|$|E

50|$|As {{standard}} the Mauser M 98 rifle {{features the}} traditional Mauser 98 three-position safety attached {{at the rear}} of the bolt which operating lever can be flicked from right (<b>safety</b> on, <b>bolt</b> locked) to middle (<b>safety</b> on, <b>bolt</b> can be opened for reloading), to left (ready to fire) but only when the rifle is cocked, otherwise the safety will not move. The safety secures the firing pin. The safety can only be released by firing the rifle with the safety set in the ready to fire position or by closing the cocked bolt with a previously pulled trigger that must be kept pulled back during the closing operation. Disengaging the safety by closing the bolt is only possible with the safety set in the ready to fire position. The safety catch lever is quite large, making it easy to operate but posing a problem for mounting telescopic sights very low above the receiver whilst retaining good operability of the safety catch leaver.The Mauser M 98 rifle series can also be ordered with an optional Mauser horizontal 3-position safety with locking lever to ensure good operability of the safety catch leaver with low mounted aiming optics.|$|R
50|$|After the Baker entered service, more {{modifications}} {{were made}} to the rifle and several different variations were produced. A lighter and shorter carbine version for the cavalry was introduced, and a number of volunteer associations procured their own models, including the Duke of Cumberland's Corps of Sharpshooters, which ordered models with a 33-inch barrel, in August 1803. A second pattern of Baker Rifle was fitted with a 'Newland' lock that had a flat-faced ring neck cock. In 1806, a third pattern was produced that included a 'pistol grip' style trigger guard and a smaller patchbox with a plain rounded front. The lock plate was smaller, flat, and had a steeped-down tail, a raised semi-waterproof pan, a flat ring neck cock, and a sliding <b>safety</b> <b>bolt.</b> With the introduction of a new pattern Short Land Pattern Flintlock Musket ('Brown Bess') in 1810, with its flat lock and ring-necked cock, the Baker's lock followed suit for what became the fourth pattern. It also featured a 'slit stock'—the stock had a slot cut in its underpart just over a quarter-inch wide. This was done after Ezekiel Baker had seen reports of the ramrod jamming in the stock after the build-up of residue in the ramrod channel, and when the wood warped after getting wet.|$|E

50|$|XP-100 pistols and Remington Model 600 rifles were {{recalled}} in 1979 {{because of a}} <b>safety</b> issue.

30|$|In {{addition}} {{to the results of}} experimental investigations, the results of analytical investigations to estimate the shear strengths of bolted joints were also discussed in this paper. Estimations of the yield strengths of bolted joints have been performed by numerous researchers; and in recent years, there has been an increase in studies to predict the load at failure. Studies on the shear strengths of bolted joints are often directly combined with design. The failure of a bolted joint is usually affected by the joint geometry, and has an effect on the safety of timber structures. To adequately predict the <b>safety</b> of <b>bolted</b> joints, experimental and analytical investigations of the failure of bolted timber joints are becoming increasingly important.|$|R
40|$|Structural health {{monitoring}} (SHM) is {{the set of}} non-intrusive techniques used for early damage detection and recognition in structures. Using advances from communication and sensing technology {{in the past two}} decades, various SHM systems have been developed to ensure infrastructure <b>safety.</b> <b>Bolted</b> joints in most aerospace structures are useful components that enable easy assembly and disassembly for maintenance purposes. However, human workmanship engaged in the process of assembly makes an integrity check of the bolted joints a necessary process. Robust monitoring of such bolted joints is a critical task for increasing reliability in aerospace structures. This dissertation investigates methods for SHM of L-shape bolted joints. These methods include using ultrasonic signals and thermal contact resistance metrics correlated to contact pressure to assess the joint’s integrity. Moreover, contact pressure distribution at the joint surface was examined using pressure sensitive films. Experimental measurements showed that there were areas on the joint interface with very low to no contact pressure. Such low pressure can result in local shear slip. Furthermore, it is experimentally and numerically demonstrated that thermal contact resistance across bolted joints, although difficult to measure, has the ability to monitor joint integrity. It is also demonstrated that ultrasonic signals are a sensitive, yet easy to use, technology for monitoring the integrity of bolted joints. The proposed ultrasonic based feature proved capable of describing the integrity of bolted joints at the time of assembly. Time-dependent effects of ultrasonic transmitted signals and the SHM feature were studied on the L-shape bolted joints. Experiments showed that time has a significant effect on the ultrasonic signals transmitted through the joint interface. EngineeringDoctoralUniversity of New Mexico.

50|$|MJTs are a {{relatively}} safe bolting method because only small hand or air tools {{are required for}} tightening. Other methods, including thermal tightening, crane wrenching, hydraulic wrenches and sledgehammers, can cause serious worker injuries due to heat, electricity, highly pressurized hydraulic fluid and brute force. Back and other injuries can also be avoided because no heavy tightening equipment needs to be lifted onto the <b>bolt.</b> <b>Safety</b> is also increased because MJTs prevent parts from becoming loose.|$|R
40|$|The U. S. Bureau of Mines {{conducted}} a human factors analysis of hazards associated with roofholting activities in underground coal mines. Emphasis {{was placed on}} hazards related to {{the movement of the}} drill-head boom or mast of a roof bolting machine. The objective was to identify hazards and recommend solutions. The data-collection effort consisted of analysis of U. S. Mine Safety and Health Ad-ministration accident data; visits to underground mines and interviews with experienced roof bolting machine operators; discussions with roof bolting machine manufacturers; interviews with workers injured while performing roof bolting tasks; and reviews of research on roof <b>bolting</b> <b>safety.</b> A set of recommendations to increase the <b>safety</b> of roof <b>bolting</b> operations was developed. In particular, the following list of recommendations was presented in ranking order: (1) use an interlock device to cut off power to controls when an operator is out of position, (2) place fixed barriers at pinch points, (3) provide appropriate control guarding, (4) reduce fast-feed speed, (5) use automatic cutoff switches at pinch points, (6) redesign control bank to conform to accepted ergonomic principles, and (7) use resin insertion tools and resin cartridge retainers...|$|R
50|$|The M 98 system {{consists}} of a receiver {{that serves as the}} systems shroud and a bolt group of which the bolt body has three locking lugs, two large main lugs at the bolt head and a third safety lug {{at the rear of the}} bolt which serves as a backup in case the primary locking lugs failed. This third lug is a distinctive feature and was not present on previous Mauser bolt action designs. The two main locking lugs display a locking surface of 56 mm², whilst the third safety lug normally plays no part in locking the action to avoid asymmetric and hence unbalanced bolt thrust forces. The diameter of the receiver was also enlarged compared to previous Mauser receivers for additional strength and <b>safety.</b> The <b>bolt</b> handle is permanently attached to the bolt and on the Mauser M 98 series is turned-down for use with optical sights.|$|R
50|$|As an {{additional}} security measure, the FMK-3 has a safety grip that {{acts in the}} following way: If the weapon is not correctly grasped, the <b>safety</b> locks the <b>bolt.</b> Thus, even if the gun is ready to fire, if not pressed, the bolt is blocked from closing and firing the weapon. In addition, as mentioned above, with the bolt at rest, empty chamber and the full magazine the grip safety prevents accidental discharge of the weapon drag. Therefore, {{it is a very}} safe weapon to carry in any condition.|$|R
