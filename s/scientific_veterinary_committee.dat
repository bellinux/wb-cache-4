5000|$|The <b>Scientific</b> <b>Veterinary</b> <b>Committee</b> of the European Commission {{stated that}} [...] "enriched cages and well {{designed}} non-cage systems {{have already been}} shown to have a number of welfare advantages over battery systems in their present form". Supporters of battery husbandry contend that alternative systems such as free range also have welfare problems, such as increases in cannibalism, feather pecking and vent pecking. A recent review of welfare in battery cages made the point that such welfare issues are problems of management, unlike the issues of behavioural deprivation, which are inherent in a system that keeps hens in such cramped and barren conditions. [...] Free range egg producers can limit or eliminate injurious pecking, particularly feather pecking, through such strategies as providing environmental enrichment, feeding mash instead of pellets, keeping roosters in with the hens, and arranging nest boxes so hens are not exposed to each other's vents; similar strategies are more restricted or impossible in battery cages.|$|E
40|$|Since the {{publication}} of Animal Machines (Harrison, 1964), there has been wide-spread public pressure in Europe—supported by European institutions—to “ban the battery cage. ” The European Union (EU) and national governments (particularly in Northern Europe) funded research on noncage systems for egg production and en-riched cages. In 1986, the EU passed a Directive specifying a minimum size for cages, but public opinion—again particularly in the North—continued to require more. A market sector emerged that would pay more for noncage eggs. Denmark, Sweden, and Switzerland passed more stringent legislation {{than the rest of}} Europe. A 1999 Direc-tive with details based on advice from the EU’s <b>Scientific</b> <b>Veterinary</b> <b>Committee</b> will phase out conventional laying cages but allow enriched cages. Implementation de-pends on various factors, including negotiations in the World Trade Organization. In the next 10 years, however, major changes to the housing of most laying hens in Eu-rope almost certainly will occur. Similar changes in other countries will follow. As in Europe, change probably will be piecemeal, affected both by public pressure and by all sectors of society: producers, retailers, consumers, legislators, and the media. On June 15, 1999, the new European Union (EU) Directive on welfare of laying hens was passed, which requires conventional laying cages to be phased out by 2012. Enriched laying cages will still be allowed. In this article, I outline how this came about and the scientific, social, economic, and political issues in-volved.

40|$|Introduction: Calcium-binding {{proteins}} such as calbindin (CB), parvalbumin (PV) and calretinin, widely {{present in}} the mammalian brain, are presumed to buffer elevated intracellular calcium levels associated with ischemia, epilepsy or excitation and acting as endogenous protective proteins. Our earlier study on chronic morphine effects on PV expression in developing mouse brain indicated alterations in the patterns of PV immunoreactivity (IR) in specific brain regions. Herein we have studied the influence of chronic maternal morphine on Calbindin D- 28 k expression in brain regions earlier observed to reveal alterations in PV-IR. Methods: Female Swiss Mice were daily administered saline or morphine (30 or expression 60 mg/kg body weight) for a period comprising 7 days before mating, during gestation and until 21 day post-partum. Their pups were sacrificed on postnatal day 18 and coronal sections of their brains were examined by histological staining of cresyl violet and for CB-immunoreactivity. Results: Histology revealed no {{significant changes in the}} cell number of the morphine-treated neonatal forebrain. However the number of CB-positive neurons decreased remarkably in the anterior cingulate cortex, in layers IIIV of the parietal cortex I and in CA 1 and CA 2 regions of the hippocampus; and increased in layers V-VI of the parietal cortex I and in the subicular region. Conclusions: These effects of morphine on calbindin-immunoreactivityin areas like the cingulate and parietal I cortices and the hippocampus of neonatal mouse confirm the key roles played by these structures in the behavioural patterns of the maternally addicted neonates, such as impaired somatosensory, cognitive, learning and memory performances. The molecular mechanisms of morphine action on CB in neonatal mouse brain are not evident, but alterations in the expression patterns of calcium binding proteins in specific regions of the developing brain might be one of the mechanisms by which addictive drugs modify the functionality of developing brain.

40|$|Title of the paper: Weifare {{assessment}} of segregated early weaning (SEW) in pigs – a review The technology of segregated early weaning (SEW) {{has been established}} primarily in large pig farm enterprises across North America. SEW is characterised by weaning piglets at days 7 to 21 of age (mostly between days 12 to 16) and isolated housing in nurseries and growing / finishing units (multi-site production with all-in all-out pig flow). The goal of this technology is to break the infection chain by utilising acquired maternal (passive) immunity from the dam before piglets develop their own active immunity in response to pathogens. A high Standard of feeding and hygiene management facilitates a superior health Status resulting in improved growth rates. The EU-Report on the welfare Status of intensively housed pigs (<b>SCIENTIFIC</b> <b>VETERINARY</b> <b>COMMITTEE,</b> 1997) suggests that the technology of SEW should be allowed {{only if it is}} demonstrated that any welfare advantages to sows and piglets outweigh the disadvantages. Recent research on the behaviour of piglets showed that piglets weaned before days 21 of age develop higher levels of nosing and chewing each other which persist into the grow/ftnish period. Longer-term consequences of SEW for the reproduetive Performance of sows are not yet sufficiently evaluated, although reduced nursing periods result into reduced litter sizes and piglet weights. That does, however, not exciude that the total number of litters/sow/year increases, resulting in greater number of piglets produced. Considering the EU legislation laying down a minimum weaning age of 21 days, it is recommended that SEW technology could be implemented by utilising the appropriate health management features (multi-site production, all-in all-out). The benefits of isolated housing on health Status and Performance of pigs seem to outweigh the additional advantages of weaning piglets {{at a very early age}} (< 21 days of age) ...|$|E
40|$|The SPCA is a not-for-profit {{organization}} {{established for}} the purpose of preventing cruelty to animals, whether these animals are farmed for the table, wild, or are kept as pets. The Animal Welfare (Pigs) Code of Welfare 2001 concerns farmed animals that are destined for the table. There are a number of farming practices currently permitted in the pork industry and also permitted in the Draft Code that constitute cruelty. This cruelty is not consistent with the Animal Welfare Act 1999 and for this reason the SPCA submits that a number of changes to the Draft Code are required {{in order to meet the}} spirit and letter of the Act. The SPCA welcomes the opportunity to make this submission. There are a number of pork industry management changes that are coming into force in the European Union that improve the welfare of farmed pigs in member states. The EU commissioned an independent <b>Scientific</b> <b>Veterinary</b> <b>Committee</b> (SVC 1997) to gather scientific information on pig welfare and write a report. Article 6 of the Council Directive 91 / 630 /EEC lays down the minimum standards for the protection of pigs for the EU and was recently amended following recommendations by the SVC. At the very least, the New Zealand minimum standard for pork farming practice should be consistent with the requirements of the Animal Welfare Act 1999. There is also opportunity for New Zealand to have a higher standard than what is required by the Act, particularly if we wish to be a world leader in agricultural practice. We note that the NZ dairy industry makes much of our free range cattle when marketing their product in countries where feedlots are the norm. The changes to the Draft Code submitted by the SPCA form an integrated whole and combine animal welfare requirements with improvements in environmental standards. In some cases the recommendations have a dual (or multiple) effect and purpose. For example, the requirement to provide bulk fibrous food in the diet (e. g. straw) serves the purpose of satisfying dietary requirements (satiation), which assists in improving behavioural conditions (providing for the foraging instinct), whilst providing for improved welfare (cushioning on joints and limbs for housed pigs), as well as lowering the emissions to air and water (producing an economic by-product in the form of nitrogen rich compost). The changes that are proposed by the SPCA will require modifications in the quality of husbandry for some pig farmers, as a minimum standard. While some of these changes may require more financial input for those farmers in comparison with the status quo, we submit that the status quo (for some farmers) is in breach of the Animal Welfare Act and therefore is not a sustainable or legitimate situation. The Animal Welfare Act (1999) is clear on a number of points that relate to the New Zealand pork industry. Section 4 of the Act requires animals to be able to display normal patterns of behaviour. This point is not under debate: it has been decided, the New Zealand public requires it, and now it needs to be enforced. Section 10 of the Act requires animals to be cared for in accordance with good practice and scientific knowledge. The following submission presents ample scientific evidence to support significant improvements in the husbandry of pigs...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Sheep from {{environmental}} dioxin contaminated areas show motor discoordination suggesting a pathophysiology in cerebellar function. Since Calcium binding proteins {{are known to}} play a role in the Ca 2 + homeostasis in neurons and during neurotransmission, we have investigated the role of these proteins in motor deficits in dioxin exposed adult and neonate sheep. We present herein the study of the expression patterns of Calcium binding proteins, Calbindin (CB) and Parvalbumin (PV) in cerebellum of adult and neonatal sheep chronically exposed to dioxin in comparison with those in cerebellum of sheep from uncontaminated area of the Campania Region. Methods: Sheep environmentally exposed to chronic dioxin were obtained from Acerra of Campania Region and the uncontaminated control sheep were from Chiusano S. Domenico of the same Region. Cerebella from control and dioxin-exposed adults and neonates were fixed in paraformaldehyde and processed for immunohistochemistry on paraffin sections, using polyclonal primary antibodies against PV and CB, biotin-avidin detection system using DAB as chromogen. Results: In control animals CB and PV showed specific and different staining patterns in adult and neonatal cerebellum but those in neonates were uniformly more intense than those in adults. Both CB and PV expressions decreased in dioxin exposed cerebellum of adult and neonatal sheep in most cerebellar subpopulations of both stages. Significantly, the fibres of white matter in adult and neonate showed uniformly increased CB and PV expression in animals from dioxin contaminated area. Conclusions: Present results confirm that CB and PV expressions are altered in majority of the cerebellar neurones in chronic environmental dioxin-exposed animals and dioxin is possibly responsible for the pathophysiology of their cerebellum. Thus modifications in the expression patterns of calcium binding proteins could be one of the mechanisms by which environmental dioxin alters the functional aspects of the cerebellar circuit inducing motor and ambulatory deficits.

40|$|Antimicrobial {{resistance}} is a daunting public health threat affecting {{both human and}} animal health {{and it is a}} cause for concern wherever antimicrobial agents are in use. The usage of antimicrobial drugs in food producing animals could result in a significant food safety issue - antimicrobial resistance among zoonotic bacteria in these animals. The resistant bacteria may then be transmitted to humans through the food supply and increase risk of treatment failures.
