In {{order to obtain}} better sensitivity, small dense probe, single <b>strand</b> <b>copper</b> probe, bifilar winding type probe and rectangular cross section type probe were designed. Through the experiments, the electrical resistance of four kinds of probe structure was determined. Test results show that conductivity of small dense probe is the worst, conductivity of single <b>strand</b> <b>copper</b> probe is better. Graphite content has great influence to probe resistance value, resistance and graphite content in the relationship is not linear...|$|R

50|$|Power cables use <b>stranded</b> <b>copper</b> or {{aluminum}} conductors, although {{small power}} cables may use solid conductors (For a detailed discussion on copper cables, see: Copper wire and cable.).|$|E
50|$|Although the {{construction}} of a portable cord varies depending on the type, a standard cord has at least two <b>stranded</b> <b>copper</b> conductors sized between #18 and #2 American wire gauge (AWG). The copper stranding, insulation, and outer jacket directly influence the physical properties of the cord and its permitted uses.|$|E
50|$|Patch cord cable {{differs from}} {{standard}} structured cabling cable in that patch cable is stranded for flexibility, whereas standard cable is solid copper. Because the patch cord is <b>stranded</b> <b>copper</b> construction the attenuation (signal loss) is higher on patch cords than solid cable so short lengths should be adhered to.|$|E
50|$|Each jumper is {{a twisted}} pair. Middle 20th century jumper wires in the USA were 24 AWG single <b>strand</b> <b>copper,</b> {{with a soft}} {{polyethylene}} inner jacket and a cotton wrapper, impregnated to make it slightly brittle and easy to remove neatly. Late 20th century ones had a single, thicker coating of polyethylene cross-linked to provide a suitable degree of brittleness.|$|R
50|$|There are two sub-types of plug, {{that differ}} {{only in the}} type of {{contacts}} used. One contact is suitable for solid (single <b>strand)</b> <b>copper</b> conductors and the other is suitable for stranded or tinsel wire copper conductors. The crimper may also permanently deform part of the plastic plug body {{in such a way that}} it grips the outer sheath of the cable. This helps to keep the plug securely fastened to the end of the cable, by providing strain relief.|$|R
50|$|Motion {{detectors}}The motion detectors {{installed in}} locations {{throughout the house}} were any intrusion into the home can be detected. The best way {{to think of this}} is, which are the rooms that have direct access from the outside, where can I place a detector to pick up any intrusion. One solution is to place a motion sensor in each room, as this can be expensive an alternative is place one immediately outside in the common corridor to all rooms. The cabling required is a 6 core multi <b>strand</b> <b>copper</b> cable.|$|R

50|$|Telecommunications {{power cable}} products, as {{described}} in Telcordia GR-347, consist of a <b>stranded</b> <b>copper</b> conductor used in AC/DC circuits up to 600 V that are insulated with non-halogen, limited smoke, polyolefin materials that are heat-resistant, moisture-resistant, and flame-retardant. These cables are provided as either Class B (standard) or Class I (flexible) products.|$|E
50|$|Based on {{availability}} of standard connectors, {{the number of}} conductors is usually restricted to a few values,These include 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20, 24, 25, 26, 34, 37, 40, 50, 60, 64 and 80.

50|$|A more simplistic {{application}} of safety wire, more {{commonly referred to}} as witness wiring, is the use of light gauge, single <b>strand,</b> <b>copper</b> wire to provide positive visual confirmation of the security or closure of specific equipment within the aerospace industry. Common applications include the security of safety equipment such as fire extinguishers, and safety equipment bags, but also as an assurance that critical system switch covers remain in place, such as those associated with the {{application of}} fire suppression, or ejection systems. This application of witness wires is widely varied, and may cover a broad range of types of equipment and numerous situations.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the most}} common {{physical}} medias used in networking is copper wire. Copper wire to carry signals to long distances using relatively low amounts of power. The unshielded twisted pair (UTP) is eight <b>strands</b> of <b>copper</b> wire, organized into four pairs.|$|R
50|$|Early speaker cable was {{typically}} <b>stranded</b> <b>copper</b> wire, insulated with cloth tape, waxed paper or rubber. For portable applications, common lampcord was used, twisted in pairs for mechanical reasons. Cables were often soldered {{in place at}} one end. Other terminations were binding posts, terminal strips, and spade lugs for crimp connections. Two-conductor ¼-inch tip-sleeve phone jacks came into use in the 1920s and '30s as convenient terminations.|$|E
50|$|Twin-lead {{cable is}} a two-conductor flat cable {{used as a}} {{balanced}} transmission line to carry radio frequency (RF) signals. It is constructed of two <b>stranded</b> <b>copper</b> or copper-clad steel wires, held a precise distance apart by a plastic (usually polyethylene) ribbon. The uniform spacing of the wires {{is the key to}} the cable's function as a transmission line; any abrupt changes in spacing would reflect some of the signal back toward the source. The plastic also covers and insulates the wires.|$|E
5000|$|The model car {{balsa wood}} body was in five {{sections}}. It had two center sections that were hollowed out {{to receive a}} pine chassis, the electric motor, and the drive mechanism. There were precision gears from the electric motor to the wheels. They had a 3 to 1 ratio, with the smallest gear on the motor and the larger gear on the drive mechanism that propelled the rear wheels. These gears were connected with a ladder-type chain connected to their sprockets. The rubber tires, obtained at a hobby shop, were {{one and a half}} inches in diameter. The rear axle was one-eighth inch in diameter. The wiring for the solar cells to the electric motor was by standard No. 20 insulated <b>stranded</b> <b>copper</b> wire.|$|E
25|$|Solid wire {{consists}} of one <b>strand</b> of <b>copper</b> metal wire, bare or {{surrounded by an}} insulator. Single-strand copper conductors are typically used as magnet wire in motors and transformers. They are relatively rigid, do not bend easily, and are typically installed in permanent, infrequently handled, and low flex applications.|$|R
50|$|High-voltage {{overhead}} conductors are {{not covered}} by insulation. The conductor material is nearly always an aluminum alloy, made into several strands and possibly reinforced with steel <b>strands.</b> <b>Copper</b> was sometimes used for overhead transmission, but aluminum is lighter, yields only marginally reduced performance and costs much less. Overhead conductors are a commodity supplied by several companies worldwide. Improved conductor material and shapes are regularly used to allow increased capacity and modernize transmission circuits. Conductor sizes range from 12 mm2 (#6 American wire gauge) to 750 mm2 (1,590,000 circular mils area), with varying resistance and current-carrying capacity. Thicker wires would lead to a relatively small increase in capacity due to the skin effect (which causes most of the current to flow close {{to the surface of the}} wire). Because of this current limitation, multiple parallel cables (called bundle conductors) are used when higher capacity is needed. Bundle conductors are also used at high voltages to reduce energy loss caused by corona discharge.|$|R
50|$|Industrial PRTs are {{designed}} to withstand industrial environments. They can be almost as durable as a thermocouple. Depending on the application, industrial PRTs can use thin-film or coil-wound elements. The internal lead wires can range from PTFE-insulated <b>stranded</b> nickel-plated <b>copper</b> to silver wire, depending on the sensor size and application. Sheath material is typically stainless steel; higher-temperature applications may demand Inconel. Other materials are used for specialized applications.|$|R
50|$|Coaxial cable conducts {{electrical}} signal using an inner conductor (usually a solid copper, <b>stranded</b> <b>copper</b> or copper plated steel wire) {{surrounded by an}} insulating layer and all enclosed by a shield, typically one to four layers of woven metallic braid and metallic tape. The cable is protected by an outer insulating jacket. Normally, the shield is kept at ground potential and a signal carrying voltage {{is applied to the}} center conductor. The advantage of coaxial design is that electric and magnetic fields are restricted to the dielectric with little leakage outside the shield. Conversely, electric and magnetic fields outside the cable are largely kept from interfering with signals inside the cable. Larger diameter cables and cables with multiple shields have less leakage. This property makes coaxial cable a good choice for carrying weak signals that cannot tolerate interference from the environment or for stronger {{electrical signal}}s that must not be allowed to radiate or couple into adjacent structures or circuits.|$|E
5000|$|One of {{the most}} {{frequently}} used method of detection is induction loops. Other methods include magnetometers, video, infrared, radar and microwave detection. A typical loop detector installation could be approximately six foot square or six feet wide by thirty feet long. Other shapes may also be used including circular and hexagonal loops. These are cut into, or buried {{below the surface of the}} roadway. The preferred wire is <b>stranded</b> <b>copper</b> with an insulating cover which is then loosely surrounded by a protection jacket. Electrically this is a 'flat' coil in the pavement structure that detects vehicles by changes in the magnetic inductance field of the coil when ferrous metal from a vehicle passes through the field. The electronic sensor in the controller cabinet senses the change in the magnetic field. The output from the sensor electronics is a 'switch' closure. This can be an electro-mechincial relay or solid-state. The 'switch' is normally closed (NC) in the de-engerized state but held open when power is applied to the circuit. This is called 'Fail-Call' so that if there is a failure in the sensor electronics the output will place a 'Call' to the controller as if a vehicle is present on the loop detector.|$|E

50|$|Early {{machines}} used brushes {{made from}} <b>strands</b> of <b>copper</b> wire {{to contact the}} surface of the commutator. However, these hard metal brushes tended to scratch and groove the smooth commutator segments, eventually requiring resurfacing of the commutator. As the copper brushes wore away, the dust and pieces of the brush could wedge between commutator segments, shorting them and reducing the efficiency of the device. Fine copper wire mesh or gauze provided better surface contact with less segment wear, but gauze brushes were more expensive than strip or wire copper brushes.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{experimental results}} on an innovative electric driveline employing a kinetic energy storage device as energy buffer. A conceptual division of {{losses in the}} system was created, separating the complete system into three parts according to their function. This conceptualization of the system yielded a meaningful definition {{of the concept of}} efficiency. Additionally, a thorough theoretical framework for the prediction of losses associated with energy storage and transfer in the system was developed. A large number of spin-down tests at varying pressure levels were performed. A separation of the measured data into the different physical processes responsible for power loss was achieved from the corresponding dependence on rotational velocity. This comparison yielded an estimate of the perpendicular resistivity of the <b>stranded</b> <b>copper</b> conductor of 2. 5 × 10 − 8 ± 3. 5 × 10 − 9 . Further, power and energy were measured system-wide during operation, and an analysis of the losses was performed.

50|$|A {{shielded}} cable is {{an electrical cable}} {{of one or more}} insulated conductors enclosed by a common conductive layer. The shield may be composed of braided <b>strands</b> of <b>copper</b> (or other metal, such as aluminium), a non-braided spiral winding of copper tape, or a layer of conducting polymer. Usually this shield is covered with a jacket. The shield acts as a Faraday cage to reduce electrical noise from affecting the signals, and to reduce electromagnetic radiation that may interfere with other devices. (For more, see electromagnetic interference). The shield minimizes capacitively coupled noise from other electrical sources. The shield must be applied across cable splices.|$|R
40|$|The strain {{state of}} the superconducting Nb 3 Sn strands in {{multi-stage}} twisted ITER Cable-In-Conduit Conductors (CICCs) strongly determines the transport properties. For an accurate prediction of the performance and a proper understanding of the underlying phenomena, {{a detailed analysis of}} the stress and strain distribution along all individual strands is imperative. Also during the cabling process, the axial stress of the individual strands must be well controlled to avoid kinks, in particular when mixing different strands, e. g., Nb 3 Sn and <b>copper</b> <b>strands.</b> A mechanical model for a superconducting cable (CORD) was developed, which can predict the strain and stress states of all single strands including interstrand contact force and the associated deformation.
