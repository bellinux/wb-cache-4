25|$|Children and {{adolescents}} often use the Internet (including social media) in ways which risk their privacy: {{a cause for}} growing concern among parents. Young people also may not realise that all their information and browsing can and may be tracked while visiting a particular site, {{and that it is}} up to them to protect their own privacy. They must be informed about all these risks. For example, on Twitter, threats include shortened links that lead one to potentially harmful places. In their e-mail inbox, threats include email scams and attachments that get them to install malware and disclose personal information. On Torrent sites, threats include malware hiding in video, music, and <b>software</b> <b>downloads.</b> Even when using a smartphone, threats include geolocation, meaning that one's phone can detect where they are and post it online for all to see. Users can protect themselves by updating virus protection, using security settings, downloading patches, installing a firewall, screening e-mail, shutting down spyware, controlling cookies, using encryption, fending off browser hijackers, and blocking pop-ups.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: <b>Downloading</b> <b>software</b> via Web {{is a major}} {{solution}} for publishers to deliver their software products. In this context, user interfaces for <b>software</b> <b>downloading</b> play a key role. Actually, they have to allow usable interactions as well as support users in taking conscious and coherent decisions about whether to accept to <b>download</b> a <b>software</b> product or not. This paper presents different design alternatives for <b>software</b> <b>download</b> interfaces, i. e. the interface that prompts the user if he wishes to actually complete its download, and evaluates their ability {{to improve the quality}} of user interactions while reducing errors in user decisions. More precisely, we compare Authenticode, the leading <b>software</b> <b>download</b> interface for Internet Explorer, to Question-&-Answer, a <b>software</b> <b>download</b> interface previously proposed by the authors [Dini et al., 2007]. Furthermore, we evaluate the effect of extending both interfaces by means of a reputation system similar to the eBay Feedback Forum. The results of the usability studies show that i) the pure Question-&-Answer interface is the most effective in minimizing users incoherent behaviors, and ii) the differences in reputation rankings significantly influence users. Overall results suggest guidelines to design the best interface depending on the context (brand reputation and product features) ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Software</b> <b>downloading</b> {{over the}} Internet {{is a major}} {{solution}} for publishers to deliver their software products. In this context, user interfaces for <b>software</b> <b>downloading</b> must be designed carefully. They should provide usable interactions and support users when deciding whether to accept the software product or not. This work proposes to enrich a common browser interface for <b>software</b> <b>downloading</b> with a reputation system - a mechanism for collecting and presenting user feedback. The reputation system is assessed with a usability study. The authors’ results show that positive user rankings are effective in increasing user download acceptances for well-known publishers and common name publishers, {{as well as in}} increasing acceptance motivations related to trust aspects. In addition, the presence of the reputation system reduces incoherent user behaviors...|$|R

40|$|Recently, several {{researchers}} {{have discovered the}} need for radios to use description techniques. Previous research describes information such as the current frequency band, waveform, and so on. However, this information is presented {{at a level that}} is not sufficient to determine software/hardware compatibility for over-the-air <b>software</b> <b>download.</b> For example, a device should not attempt to download a wideband waveform if its radio front-end is only narrowband, or if its baseband hardware cannot provide the required MIPS for the new waveform. Over-the-air <b>software</b> <b>download</b> {{is one of the most}} interesting features of software-defined radios. The compatibility between software and hardware prior to <b>software</b> <b>download</b> previously had to be verified manually. The approach that is described here removes the need for man-in-the-loop. It uses OWL-DL to describe the components of a software defined radio and the <b>software</b> to be <b>downloaded.</b> As a result, the problem of compatibility is reduced to that of checking a subsumption constraint in an OWL-DL ontology. We show the variability of our approach through examples...|$|R
