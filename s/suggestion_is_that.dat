5|$|Eadbald died in 640, and {{according}} to most versions of the Kentish Royal Legend was succeeded solely by his son Eorcenberht. However, an early text (Caligula A.xiv) refers to Eormenred as 'king', suggesting either he was a junior king under Eorcenberht, or had a shared kingship. One <b>suggestion</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the some other version {{of events in the}} 'legend', which give him no title, may have been an attempt to discredit royal claimants from Eormenred's line.|$|E
5|$|For presentation, one <b>suggestion</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the pilchards be {{arranged}} with their tails toward {{the centre of}} the pie and their heads poking up through the crust around the edge. As it includes potatoes and pastry, the pie can be served on its own or with crusty bread, sometimes with vegetables. Other suggested accompaniments are Cornish Yarg cheese, rhubarb chutney, poached eggs or a slice of lemon.|$|E

5|$|Many sources {{state the}} meaning of Rhondda as 'noisy', though this is a {{simplified}} translation without research. Sir Ifor Williams, in his work Enwau Lleoedd, suggests that the first syllable rhwadd {{is a form of}} the Welsh adrawdd or adrodd, as in 'recite, relate, recount', similar to the Old Irish rád; 'speech'. The <b>suggestion</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the river is speaking aloud, a comparison to the English expression 'a babbling brook'.|$|E
5|$|A 2015 {{study of}} the necks of Apatosaurus and Brontosaurus found many {{differences}} between them and other diplodocids, and that these variations may {{have shown that the}} necks of Apatosaurus and Brontosaurus were used for intraspecific combat. Various uses for the single claw on the forelimb of sauropods have been proposed. One <b>suggestion</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> they were used for defense, but their shape and size make this unlikely. It was also possible they were for feeding, but the most probable use for the claw was grasping objects such as tree trunks when rearing.|$|E
5|$|A further <b>suggestion</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Mari Lwyd {{derives from}} the English term Merry Lude, {{referring}} to a merry game. Peate opposed this idea, arguing that if the latter was converted into Welsh then {{the result would be}} merri-liwt or merri-liwd. Peate also dismissed the idea that had been suggested to him that the term Mari in this context had derived from Morris, a reference to Morris dance. Another reason to doubt this idea {{is that there is no}} known historical link between the Mari Lwyd, which was found in South Wales, and the Morris dance, which was concentrated in the north of the country.|$|E
50|$|Many {{theories}} {{have been put}} forward to how he received his name. In 1907, a reference was made to the 'bluelight' of his eloquence; another <b>suggestion</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> of his blue nose in winter, or that he sold blue-tipped matches.|$|R

5000|$|The {{term was}} coined in 2004 by King Abdullah II of Jordan {{at a time}} when Iran was {{reportedly}} interfering in Iraq {{in the run-up to the}} January 2005 parliamentary elections. [...] This was in the context of a threatened, later realised, boycott of the elections by Sunnis in Iraq potentially leading to a Shia-dominated government and the assumption that a Shia Iraq might fall under the influence of Shia Iran. The <b>suggestion</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the common religion gives good potential for cooperation between Iran, Iraq, Alawite-dominated Syria and the politically powerful Shia militia Hezbollah in Lebanon; as well, the <b>suggestion</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> these others would be proxies for Iran in a regional power play.|$|R
5|$|Herodotus {{suggests}} that the Allied ships were heavier and, by implication, less maneuverable. Their weight would further {{reduce the likelihood of}} the Allied ships employing the diekplous. The source of this heaviness is uncertain; possibly the Allied ships were bulkier in construction. Another <b>suggestion</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the heaviness was caused by the weight of fully armoured hoplite marines. The Allies may have had extra marines on board if their ships were less maneuverable, since boarding would then be the main tactic available to them (at the cost of making the ships even heavier). Indeed, Herodotus refers to the Greeks capturing ships, rather than sinking them.|$|E
5|$|This {{conflict}} has led historians {{to take a}} number of positions on political arrangements in the province. Some have argued that Josephus' greater knowledge of Jewish affairs justifies favouring his account. M. Aberbach believes {{that there was a}} division of power, but that Tacitus reversed the governors' areas of authority and that Cumanus actually governed the south and Felix the north; this fits better with Josephus, who describes Cumanus as active in Jerusalem and nearby. Another <b>suggestion</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> part of the province was transferred to Felix after disturbances under Cumanus' rule.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the {{straightforward}} {{narrative of}} the attacks on Dál Riata, a number of interpretations have been offered of the relations between Óengus, Eadberht and Æthelbald in the period from 740 to 750. One <b>suggestion</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Óengus and Æthelbald were allied against Eadberht, or even that they exercised a joint rulership of Britain, or bretwaldaship, Óengus collecting tribute north of the River Humber and Æthelbald south of the Humber. This rests largely on a confused passage in Symeon of Durham's Historia Regum Anglorum, and it has more recently been suggested that the interpretation offered by Frank Stenton—that {{it is based on}} a textual error and that Óengus and Æthelbald were not associated in any sort of joint overlordship—is the correct one.|$|E

5|$|Finally, in late 1229, Theodore began {{assembling}} {{his forces}} at Thessalonica—including {{a contingent of}} troops sent by Frederick II—for the projected final attack on Constantinople. As his troops marched east in spring 1230, he unexpectedly turned his army north and followed the Evros valley into Bulgaria. Theodore's motives for this sudden change are debated. Contemporary and later historians like Akropolites denounced this {{as a sign of}} Theodore's duplicity and treachery. A more likely <b>suggestion</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Theodore, hitherto undefeated in battle, desired to check Bulgarian power and avoid the possibility of the Bulgarians striking in his rear while he was engaged in besieging Constantinople. Although caught by surprise, John Asen reacted rapidly. Allegedly affixing the text of the broken treaty to one of his spears as a flag, he rallied his troops and met Theodore in battle in April 1230. The ensuing Battle of Klokotnitsa was a crushing victory for the Bulgarian ruler, who took Theodore and many of his officers captive.|$|E
5|$|Veronica {{watches a}} {{football}} practice before she expresses her frustration with Logan (Jason Dohring). Later, she meets Weevil (Francis Capra), {{who is working}} at a car wash. Veronica is called into the Dean O'Dell's office, and he threatens her with expulsion if she does not give up some names {{in relation to the}} sorority marijuana scandal. Piz calls Veronica in to help a football player, Kurt Fenstermacher, retrieve his playbook, with Kurt's girlfriend, Trish (Lindsey McKeon) paying for the investigation. Veronica's only <b>suggestion</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> he gets a new one. Veronica convinces her father, Keith Mars (Enrico Colantoni), to hire Weevil as his new assistant at Mars Investigations. In an attempt to print a playbook for Kurt, Veronica disguises herself as a cheerleader, but fails to print one. After being called back into the Dean's office, Veronica is in the room during a debate between fraternity boys and feminists. Veronica goes back to the football player, and she hypothesizes that his girlfriend’s ex-boyfriend stole it. Weevil helps Keith at detective work, succeeding beyond Keith's expectations.|$|E
5|$|Several {{causes for}} the decline and sudden {{disappearance}} of the hoopoe starling have been proposed, all connected to the activities of humans on Réunion, who it survived alongside for two centuries. An oft-repeated <b>suggestion</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{the introduction of the}} common myna (Acridotheres tristis) led to competition between these two starling species. The myna was introduced to Réunion in 1759 to combat locusts, and became a pest itself. However, the hoopoe starling coexisted with the myna for nearly 100years and they may not have shared habitat. The black rat (Rattus rattus) arrived on Reunion in the 1670s, and the brown rat (Rattus norvegicus) in 1735, multiplying rapidly and threatening agriculture and native species. Like the hoopoe starling, the rats inhabited tree cavities and would have preyed on eggs, juveniles, and nesting birds. During the mid-19th century the Réunion slit-eared skink (Gongylomorphus borbonicus) became extinct due to predation by the introduced wolf snake (Lycodon aulicum), which may have deprived the bird of a significant food source. Hoopoe starlings may have contracted diseases from introduced birds, a factor known to have triggered declines and extinctions in endemic Hawaiian birds. According to ecologist Anthony S. Cheke, this was the chief cause of the hoopoe starling's extinction; the species had survived for generations despite other threats.|$|E

5|$|The motte-and-bailey castle is a {{particularly}} northern European phenomenon, most numerous in Normandy and Britain, but also seen in Denmark, Germany, Southern Italy and occasionally beyond. European castles first emerged in the 9th and 10th centuries, {{after the fall of}} the Carolingian Empire resulted in its territory being divided among individual lords and princes and local territories became threatened by the Magyars and the Norse. Against this background, various explanations have been put forward to explain the origins and spread of the motte-and-bailey design across northern Europe; there is often a tension among the academic community between explanations that stress military and social reasons for the rise of this design. One <b>suggestion</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> these castles were built particularly in order to protect against external attack– the Angevins, it is argued, began to build them to protect against the Viking raids, and the design spread to deal with the attacks along the Slav and Hungarian frontiers. Another argument is that, given the links between this style of castle and the Normans, who were of Viking descent, it was in fact originally a Viking design, transported to Normandy and Angers. The motte-and-bailey castle was certainly effective against assault, although as historian André Debord suggests, the historical and archaeological record of the military operation of motte-and-bailey castles remains relatively limited.|$|E
25|$|Another <b>suggestion</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{the city}} was named after the Chenna Kesava Perumal Temple; the word chenni in Tamil means face, with the temple {{regarded}} as {{the face of the}} city.|$|E
25|$|A <b>suggestion</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Mozart died as {{a result}} of his hypochondriasis and his predilection for taking patent {{medicines}} containing antimony. In his final days, this was compounded by further prescriptions of antimony to relieve the fever he clearly suffered.|$|E

25|$|Although parents {{treat their}} {{children}} differently, such differential treatment explains {{only a small}} amount of nonshared environmental influence.
