5|$|The King's Speech is a 2010 British {{historical}} drama film {{directed by}} Tom Hooper and written by David Seidler. Colin Firth plays the future King George VI who, {{to cope with}} a stammer, sees Lionel Logue, an Australian <b>speech</b> <b>and</b> <b>language</b> <b>therapist</b> played by Geoffrey Rush. The men become friends as they work together, and after his brother abdicates the throne, the new king relies on Logue to help him make his first wartime radio broadcast on Britain's declaration of war on Germany in 1939.|$|E
5|$|Dysphagia and dysarthria: {{dysphagia}} is {{a difficulty}} with eating and swallowing which may cause choking and aspiration of food or liquid into the lungs, while dysarthria is a neurological motor speech disorder characterized by poor {{control over the}} subsystems and muscles responsible for speech ("articulation"). A <b>speech</b> <b>and</b> <b>language</b> <b>therapist</b> may give advice on specific swallowing techniques, on adapting food consistencies and dietary intake, on techniques to improve and maintain speech production and clarity, and on alternative communication approaches. In the case of advanced dysphagia, food can be supplied by a nasogastric tube, which is a tube that goes through the nose directly to the stomach; or a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), which is a procedure for placing a tube into the stomach and therefore administering food directly to it. This second system, although more invasive, has better results {{in the long term}} than nasogastric intake.|$|E

40|$|Background: Research into recruitment, {{retention}} <b>and</b> {{return of}} <b>speech</b> <b>and</b> <b>language</b> <b>therapists</b> in the National Health Service (NHS) is relatively limited, particularly {{in respect of}} understanding the factors that drive employment choice decisions. Aims: To identify what factors influence <b>speech</b> <b>and</b> <b>language</b> <b>therapists</b> working in the NHS to stay, and consider leaving, but not do so. To identify what features of the NHS and alternative employers influence <b>speech</b> <b>and</b> <b>language</b> <b>therapists</b> to leave the NHS. To identify why some <b>speech</b> <b>and</b> <b>language</b> <b>therapists</b> return to the NHS after working elsewhere. Methods & Procedures: A total of 516 male <b>and</b> female <b>speech</b> <b>and</b> <b>language</b> <b>therapists,</b> in three distinct groups (NHS stayers, leavers and returners) completed a questionnaire and gave responses to open-ended questions regarding {{their perceptions of the}} NHS and other employers. Qualitative data analysis identified reasons why individuals stayed in, left or returned to the NHS employment, and what actions could be taken by management to facilitate retention and return. Outcomes & Results: Stayers value job and pension security; professional development opportunities; the work itself; and professional support. Leavers not involved in childcare left because of workload/pressure/stress; poor pay; {{and not being able to}} give good patient care. Returners returned because of flexible hours; work location; professional development; and pension provision. Stayers and returners primarily wish to see more staff in the NHS, whereas leavers would return if there were more flexibility in work arrangements. Returners were particularly hostile towards Agenda for Change. Conclusions & Implications: Whilst some preferences appear to require increased resources, others such as reducing bureaucracy and valuing professionals do not. The full impact of Agenda for Change has yet to be established. Predicted excess labour supply of allied health professionals and future structural changes present pressures but also possible opportunities for <b>speech</b> <b>and</b> <b>language</b> <b>therapists...</b>|$|R
40|$|There is {{a growing}} body of {{research}} which has investigated the experience of the migrant health worker. However, only one of these studies has included <b>speech</b> <b>and</b> <b>language</b> <b>therapists</b> thus far, <b>and</b> then only with extremely small numbers. The aim of this study was to explore the experiences and perspectives of migrant <b>speech</b> <b>and</b> <b>language</b> <b>therapists</b> living in the UK. Twenty-three overseas qualified <b>speech</b> <b>and</b> <b>language</b> <b>therapists</b> living in the UK completed an online survey consisting of 36 questions (31 closed question, 5 open-ended questions). The majority of participants came from Australia or the USA and moved to the UK early in their careers. Participants reported a range of benefits from working in another country and more specifically working in the UK. The findings were consistent with other research on migrant health workers regarding known pull factors of travel, finance, and career. This study suggests additional advantages to working in the UK were realised once participants had started working in the UK, such as the UK job lifestyle. Finally, the migrant <b>speech</b> <b>and</b> <b>language</b> <b>therapists</b> were similar in profile to other migrant health workers in terms of age and country of origin previously reported in the literature...|$|R

40|$|Successful {{collaboration}} between <b>speech</b> <b>and</b> <b>language</b> <b>therapists</b> <b>and</b> teachers {{has implications for}} the delivery of services for children with communication problems. This research {{is concerned with the}} ways in which <b>speech</b> <b>and</b> <b>language</b> <b>therapists</b> <b>and</b> teachers work together to help children up to the age of 11 years of age who have difficulties with communication. A survey was carried out among <b>speech</b> <b>and</b> <b>language</b> <b>therapists</b> working in England and Wales, who either worked in schools or Health Centres. A postal questionnaire was used to collect the information and the responses were analysed using quantitative and qualitative methodology. All the 443 respondents agreed that collaboration was important although this did not always happen. More school based therapists collaborated with teachers than clinic based <b>therapists.</b> The <b>speech</b> <b>and</b> <b>language</b> <b>therapists</b> in this survey assessed children with coimnunication problems, planned the therapy and then begin to work with the teachers. Therapists who were based in health centres saw this as a way of ensuring a continuation of therapy between clinic appointments. To try to understand the reasons for teachers and therapists collaborating a second set of data was collected using interviews. Twenty pairs of <b>speech</b> <b>and</b> <b>language</b> <b>therapists</b> <b>and</b> teachers who worked together, were interviewed. In ten pairs, the therapist was clinic based and visited the school and in the other ten pairs the therapist was based in the same school as the teacher. Reciprocity between collaborating dyads was much more common around their increase in knowledge as a result of working together than any other factor. The fact that cognitive gain was one of the chief benefits following collaboration raises interesting issues to be considered in future undergraduate professional education and in-service training. ...|$|R

40|$|Only {{two years}} after graduating themselves, <b>speech</b> <b>and</b> <b>language</b> <b>therapists</b> are asked to act as {{placement}} educators <b>and</b> supervise student <b>speech</b> <b>and</b> <b>language</b> <b>therapists.</b> The role of the placement educator is to supervise, teach, support and assess the student in the clinical environment and as such is a complex and demanding role. Some previous {{research has suggested that}} the training and support provided to developing placement educators does not adequately prepare them for the role. However, the development of <b>speech</b> <b>and</b> <b>language</b> <b>therapists</b> as placement educators is a relatively under-researched area in the UK. This interpretive study explores how ten <b>speech</b> <b>and</b> <b>language</b> <b>therapists</b> feel they develop the necessary skills to be successful as placement educators, through the stories they tell about their experiences. This exploration of clinical education and professional development is set within a social constructivist perspective on learning. The participants talked at length of their own early experiences as students and described these as the starting point for their own enactment of the placement educator role. They also emphasised the importance of continuing to learn and develop their skills as they gained experience in the placement educator role itself. The themes of talk, collaboration, reflective practice and experiential learning were central to the stories told by the participants and underpin how these <b>speech</b> <b>and</b> <b>language</b> <b>therapists</b> learnt to be placement educators. It is suggested that in describing how she felt she learnt to be a placement educator each participant created a unique and dynamic map of that learning. This study contributes to the on-going discussion about the role of critical reflection in understanding and challenging established practice and reinforces the place of reflective practice as integral to both the clinical and placement educator aspects of the SLTâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 s role. The findings highlight the importance of peer support and shared opportunities for critical reflection with colleagues in ensuring that placement educators do not feel isolated or disillusioned...|$|R
