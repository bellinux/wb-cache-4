50|$|Hewland Mk.III of 1962 {{became the}} first product for the public, which {{utilised}} the magnesium alloy case of the Beetle transaxle to house 5 pairs of bespoke straight-cut constant mesh spur gears with dog rings operated by custom-made brass shift forks. Gear <b>selector</b> <b>shaft</b> was located in the nose housing, unmodified as in the Beetle set up, facing rear-ward {{at the tail end}} of the box in the front-side-back position on a midship engine racing cars. The elimination of synchromesh parts provided the space for an additional pair of gears for the 5th speed.|$|E
