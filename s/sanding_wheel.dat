5000|$|Luigi D'Andrea {{punched the}} little disks out of {{celluloid}} by hand, {{with a heavy}} mallet {{and a variety of}} knife edged dies which he designed. The cut edges were then finished by hand with sand paper. He also made the traditional tortoise shell picks the same way. The real shell came from Europe in irregularly shaped [...] "plates" [...] which were then soaked in oil and pressed between heated stainless steel plates for days. The plates were regularly tightened with a hand wheel. The pick material was then taken off the press hot and cut by hand with a steel die and wooden mallet, to get as many good picks as possible from the irregular plate. They had to work quickly because if the shell cooled or dried out, it would shatter when cut. The edges of the plate made thin picks, further in was medium, and the center supplied the thick gauge. They were then either tumbled or finished by hand on a <b>sanding</b> <b>wheel.</b> Some would have to be re-pressed flat again {{at the end of this}} process, for the gauges were never uniform. By comparison, the celluloid process was slightly simpler because the 2'x5', sheets were flat and uniformly gauged. It was readily available in the U.S. until the late 1960s, and only from Italy and Japan.|$|E
40|$|The {{capability}} to provide localized, real-time monitoring of material regression rates in various applications {{has the potential}} to provide a new stream of data for development testing of various components and systems, as well as serving as a monitoring tool in flight applications. These applications include, but are not limited to, the regression of a combusting solid fuel surface, the ablation of the throat in a chemical rocket or the heat shield of an aeroshell, and the monitoring of erosion in long-life plasma thrusters. The rate of regression in the first application is very fast, while the second and third are increasingly slower. A recent fundamental sensor development effort has led to a novel regression, erosion, and ablation sensor technology (REAST). The REAST sensor allows for measurement of real-time surface erosion rates at a discrete surface location. The sensor is optical, using two different, co-located fiber-optics to perform the regression measurement. The disparate optical transmission properties of the two fiber-optics makes it possible to measure the regression rate by monitoring the relative light attenuation through the fibers. As the fibers regress along with the parent material in which they are embedded, the relative light intensities through the two fibers changes, providing a measure of the regression rate. The optical nature of the system makes it relatively easy to use in a variety of harsh, high temperature environments, and it is also unaffected by the presence of electric and magnetic fields. In addition, the sensor could be used to perform optical spectroscopy on the light emitted by a process and collected by fibers, giving localized measurements of various properties. The {{capability to}} perform an in-situ measurement of material regression rates is useful in addressing a variety of physical issues in various applications. An in-situ measurement allows for real-time data regarding the erosion rates, providing a quick method for empirically anchoring any analysis geared towards lifetime qualification. Erosion rate data over an operating envelope could also be useful in the modeling detailed physical processes. The sensor has been embedded in many regressing media for the purposes of proof-of-concept testing. A gross demonstration of its capabilities was performed using a <b>sanding</b> <b>wheel</b> to remove layers of metal. A longer-term demonstration measurement involved the placement of the sensor in a brake pad, monitoring the removal of pad material associated with the normal wear-and-tear of driving. It was used to measure the regression rates of the combustable media in small model rocket motors and road flares. Finally, a test was performed using a sand blaster to remove small amounts of material at a time. This test was aimed at demonstrating the unit's present resolution, and is compared with laser profilometry data obtained simultaneously. At the lowest resolution levels, this unit should be useful in locally quantifying the erosion rates of the channel walls in plasma thrusters. ...|$|E

Different wear modes (adhesive, two-body-abrasive, three-body-abrasive, under dry, lubricated, or slurry conditions) can be conducted on the same machine. Results of adhesive wear, friction and interface temperature of glass fibre reinforced polyester composite under wet/dry contact condition are reported at 50 N load for different sliding speeds (2. 8 - 7. 8 m/s) using the new machine. Weight loss and friction coefficient of the composite were substantially influenced by introducing water as lubricant.

For thermally sprayed coatings, it is already shown that the tribological properties get mainly determined by the carbide grain size fraction. Within the scope of this study, the tribological characteristics of iron based WC-W 2 C reinforced arc sprayed coatings deposited using cored wires consisting of different carbide grain size fractions were examined. Microstructural characteristics of the produced coatings were scrutinized using electron microscopy and x-ray diffraction analyses. Ball-on-disk test as well as Taber Abraser and dry <b>sand</b> rubber <b>wheel</b> test were employed to analyze both the dry sliding and the abrasive wear behavior. It was shown that a reduced carbide grain size fraction as filling leads to an enhanced wear resistance against sliding. In terms of the Taber Abraser test, it is also demonstrated that a fine carbide grain size fraction results in an improved wear resistant against abrasion. As opposed to that, a poorer wear resistance was found within the dry <b>sand</b> rubber <b>wheel</b> tests. The findings show that the operating mechanisms for both abrasion tests affect the stressed surface in a different way, leading either to microcutting or microploughing...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{discussed the}} effect of Ti content on the microstructure and wear behavior of Fe-based hard-facing alloys. A series of Fe-Cr-C-Si-Mn-xTi alloy fillers were deposited on SS 400 low carbon steel by {{gas tungsten arc welding}} (GTAW). Optical microscope, electron microscope and X-ray diffraction were used to investigate the microstructural characteristics. Wear resistance was estimated with <b>sand</b> <b>wheel</b> wear test, and the worn surfaces were observed by scanning electron microscope. The microstructure of Fe-based hard-facing alloy without of Ti content consisted of primary γ, eutectic [γ+(Fe,Cr) 3 C], eutectic [γ+(Fe,Cr) 2 C], and a few martensite. As the Ti content of the hard-facing alloy increased, the microstructure were composed of primary TiC carbide, γ phase, and eutectic [γ+(Fe,Cr,Ti) 3 C]. The amount and size of the TiC carbide in microstructure was a proportion to the Ti content in Fe-based hard-facing alloy. Nevertheless, the amount eutectic [γ+(Fe,Cr,Ti) 3 C] will decrease, as the Ti content increased. According to the results of hardness test and <b>sand</b> <b>wheel</b> test, the lowest hardness (HRC 54. 93) and the highest wear loss (0. 288 g) were obtained as the hard-facing alloy has no Ti content. The highest hardness of HRC 60. 29 and the lowest weight loss of 0. 041 g were produced, as Ti addition was 4. 87 wt%. The characteristics of worn surface showed that the wear mechanisms in the microstructure of primary austenite and small size TiC carbide were ploughing, micro-void, and fracturing of carbides. Finally, in the microstructure of big size TiC carbide, the wear mechanism was discontinuous ploughing. 本研究探討添加不同鈦含量對鐵基硬面合金顯微組織與磨耗行為之影響，利用鎢極惰性氣體遮護電弧銲接法(Gas Tungsten Arc Welding, GTAW) ，將預先配製的Fe-Cr-C-Si-Mn-xTi合金填料(x＝ 0. 00 ~ 7. 25 wt%) ，銲覆於SS 400 低碳鋼基材表面上。銲覆層之顯微結構藉由光學顯微鏡、電子顯微鏡及X-ray繞射分析進行探討，最後利用乾砂磨耗試驗分析其耐磨耗性質，並以掃瞄式電子顯微鏡(SEM) 觀察磨耗面探討其磨耗行為。 本研究在合金填料中添加六組不同配比之鈦金屬，經GTAW銲覆後，無添加鈦金屬組別顯微組織主要由沃斯田鐵相、少量麻田散鐵相、沃斯田鐵與(Fe,Cr) 3 C及沃斯田鐵與(Fe,Cr) 2 C之共晶組織所構成。隨鈦金屬添加量增加，顯微組織則由初晶TiC碳化物、沃斯田鐵相、沃斯田鐵與(Fe,Cr,Ti) 3 C共晶組織所組成。隨鈦含量增加銲覆層中之TiC碳化物數量與尺寸會增加，而沃斯田鐵與(Fe,Cr) 3 C共晶組織則會減少，並發現銲覆層之硬度與抗磨耗性隨TiC碳化物數量增多而呈上升趨勢。硬度測試與乾砂磨耗試驗之結果顯示，無添加鈦金屬之銲覆層抗磨耗性最差其硬度值為HRC 54. 93 ，磨耗量為 0. 288 g，隨鈦含量之增加，銲覆層之抗磨耗性質有上升的趨勢，當銲覆層鈦含量增加至 4. 87 wt%時，可得最高硬度值HRC 60. 29 ，其磨耗量下降至 0. 041 g，抗磨耗性最佳。 乾砂磨耗試驗磨耗面之觀察結果顯示，顯微組織中具初晶沃斯田鐵相及小尺寸TiC碳化物者，其磨耗機制以塑性犁溝、微坑洞及碳化物剝落為主，顯微結構中之初晶相為大尺寸TiC碳化物者，其磨耗機構為不連續犁溝為主。誌謝 I 摘要 II Abstract III 總目錄 IV 表目錄 VII 圖目錄 VIII 第一章 前言 1 第二章 文獻回顧 4 2 - 1 硬面處理介紹 4 2 - 1 - 1 硬面銲覆之方法 5 2 - 1 - 2 硬面合金之種類 8 2 - 1 - 3 Fe-Cr-C合金常見顯微組織 11 2 - 2 合金元素之影響	 13 2 - 2 - 1 碳元素 13 2 - 2 - 2 鈦元素 16 2 - 2 - 3 鉻元素 19 2 - 2 - 4 矽元素 22 2 - 2 - 5 錳元素 23 2 - 3 碳化物種類與性質 23 2 - 4 磨耗機構介紹 26 2 - 4 - 1 磨耗定義與影響變因 26 2 - 4 - 2 乾砂磨耗機構 29 第三章 實驗步驟與方法 32 3 - 1 實驗流程 32 3 - 2 試片製備 33 3 - 2 - 1 基材與銲覆合金成份設計 33 3 - 2 - 2 銲覆製程 34 3 - 3 銲覆層成份分析 36 3 - 4 顯微結構分析 37 3 - 4 - 1 光學顯微觀察 37 3 - 4 - 2 X光繞射分析	 37 3 - 4 - 3 FE-SEM顯微觀察與EDS半定量分析	 37 3 - 5 機械性質測試 39 3 - 5 - 1 銲覆層上表面硬度測試 39 3 - 5 - 2 銲覆層橫截面微硬度測試 39 3 - 5 - 3 乾砂磨耗試驗 40 第四章 結果與討論 43 4 - 1 銲覆層巨觀觀察	 43 4 - 2 銲覆層成份與顯微組織分析	 45 4 - 2 - 1 銲覆層成份分析 45 4 - 2 - 2 銲覆層顯微組織分析 48 4 - 3 銲覆層晶體結構分析 52 4 - 4 銲覆層顯微結構分析 54 4 - 5 銲覆層硬度分析	 67 4 - 5 - 1 上表面硬度 67 4 - 5 - 2 橫截面硬度分佈 69 4 - 6 銲覆層磨耗性質分析 70 4 - 6 - 1 磨耗量分析 70 4 - 6 - 2 磨耗面觀察 72 第五章 結論 81 第六章 參考文獻 8...|$|R

30|$|Before forging the gear, the {{oxidized}} {{layer and}} surface defects were removed using a hand <b>sand</b> <b>wheel</b> to effectively avoid the cracking phenomenon of forging residue.

After forging, the forging part must be normalized under more than 950  °C and tempered less than 600  °C to eliminate forging stress and improve cutting performance. After a rough-machining of the gear blank, each part underwent an ultrasonic defect check. A grinding undercut large radius hob {{was used for}} gear grinding to increase gear root fillet, and improve the impact resistance and bearing capacity of gears. In the carburizing and quenching heat treatment process, the carbon potential concentrations were strictly controlled at 0.8  %– 1.0  %.

All gears were ground in high precision grinding machine NILES, and some of the key components, such as planetary gear and sun gear, were under tip relief operation. At the same time, the accuracy of gear machining was one level higher than the specified level on the drawings to ensure a good meshing of the gears. The ground gears were treated by strengthened shot blast to eliminate the burns on the tooth surface and increase residual compressive stress, thereby enhancing the gear’s contact fatigue strength and bending fatigue strength.|$|R
