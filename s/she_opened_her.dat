25|$|There was {{a portion}} of the scale which {{differed}} from the rest in quality and remained to the last 'under a veil.'...out of these uncouth materials she had to compose her instrument and then to give it flexibility. Her studies to acquire execution must have been tremendous; but the volubility and brilliancy, when acquired, gained a character of their own... There were a breadth, an expressiveness in her roulades, an evenness and solidity in her shake, which imparted to every passage a significance totally beyond the reach of lighter and more spontaneous singers...

On one side stood Balaram Bose’s house, the ‘Calcutta Citadel’ of Sri Ramakrishna, where his disciples repaired for rest. On its north-east is the huge family mansion of Girish Chandra Ghosh. A little to its north was the Holy Mother’s house. All these houses were encircled by the Ramkanto Bose Street and Bosepara Lane, whose very dust was trod upon by Sri Ramakrishna.” <b>She</b> <b>opened</b> <b>her</b> school formally on 13 November 1898 at 16, Bosepara Lane, in the presence of Sarada Ma, Swami Vivekananda, Swami Brahmananda, Swami Saradanandane.

500|$|In the 1950 and 1951 general elections, Roberts was the Conservative {{candidate}} for the safe Labour seat of Dartford. The local party selected her as its candidate because, though not a dynamic public speaker, Roberts was well-prepared and fearless in her answers; prospective candidate Bill Deedes recalled that [...] "Once <b>she</b> <b>opened</b> <b>her</b> mouth, {{the rest of us}} began to look rather second-rate". She attracted media attention as the youngest and the only female candidate. She lost on both occasions to Norman Dodds, but reduced the Labour majority by 6,000, and then a further 1,000. During the campaigns, she was supported by her parents and by husband Denis Thatcher, whom she married in December 1951. Denis funded his wife's studies for the bar; she qualified as a barrister in 1953 and specialised in taxation. Later that same year their twins Carol and Mark were born, delivered prematurely by Caesarean section.|$|E

500|$|Green was awoken {{some time}} after midnight {{by the sound of}} the home's {{built-in}} fire alarm system. She initially assumed that the sound was a false alarm caused by her dogs triggering the burglar alarm, but when she tried to shut off the alarm at the control panel in her bedroom and it continued sounding, <b>she</b> <b>opened</b> <b>her</b> bedroom door and found smoke in the hallway. She exited the house using a deck that connected to her first-floor bedroom. While standing on the deck, she heard her son Tim on the home's intercom system, calling to ask her what he should do. [...] "He used to be my thirteen-year-old", Green explained to police, and said that she had told him to stay in the house and wait for firefighters to rescue him. She had then knocked on a neighbor's door to ask them to call 9-1-1. When she returned to the house, she found Kate, who had climbed through her second-floor bedroom window, {{on the roof of the}} home's garage. Green called to Kate to jump, and Kate landed safely on the ground in front of Green.|$|E

Madonna started singing the song. Two male backup dancers appeared behind her wearing horse reins around their heads to convey the feeling of oppression. The song continued in their choreographed performance, with Madonna sometimes pulling the harness around her dancers as if they were horses. During the intermediate musical interlude, Madonna moved {{to the front of the}} stage and lay down on the screen attached to it. As she continued singing the music increased and she started to twirl in the center of the stage. The performance continued with Madonna and her dancers moving to the back of the stage singing the words [...] "get together" [...] repeatedly. It ended with the music of the next song [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] starting.|$|E
500|$|Eric Stokes died {{unexpectedly}} in 1962, {{an experience}} which left Constance bereft; a long-time friend {{said that she}} never really recovered. Faced with a substantial mortgage to service, Stokes returned to work: painting. Two years later, <b>she</b> <b>opened</b> <b>her</b> first one-woman show in over thirty years. It comprised 43 works, with the 27 paintings priced dearly, at upwards of 150 guineas. The exhibition was a success both financially and critically: Stokes earned over 4000 guineas, and the exhibition attracted praise from art historian and critic Bernard William Smith. Throughout the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, she painted and held shows; this later phase of her work {{was based on a}} stronger, if lighter, colour palette and reflected the influence of the art of Henri Matisse, whom Stokes admired. There was also a change in her subject matter, from [...] "classically conceived" [...] still lifes, groups of figures and nudes, to more decorative themes. Stokes' works continued to be well received, having been included in the 1975 exhibition Australian women artists at the University of Melbourne, and the Regional Galleries Association of Victoria's 1977 touring exhibition The heroic years of Australian painting, 1940–1965. Stokes' last painting was Alice Tumbling Down the Rabbit Hole, painted around 1989; she died in Melbourne in 1991.|$|E
