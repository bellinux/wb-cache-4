5000|$|The Seattle-based bank {{holding company}} Washington Mutual {{declared}} bankruptcy on September 26, 2008. The 120-year-old company, {{one of the largest}} banking institutions in the US West, was driven into bankruptcy by the subprime crises. On the previous day, September 25, 2008, the United States Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) announced that it closed the holding company's primary operating subsidiary, Washington Mutual Savings Bank, and had placed it into the receivership of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). The FDIC sold the assets, all deposit accounts, and <b>secured</b> <b>liabilities</b> to JPMorgan Chase, but not unsecured debt or equity obligations. [...] Washington Mutual Savings Bank's closure and receivership is the largest U.S. bank failure in history. Kerry Killinger, the CEO from 1988 to August 2008, had been fired by the board of directors. Virtually all savings and checking account holders were not affected as the accounts were insured by the FDIC during the collapse, and subsequently transferred in whole to JPMorgan Chase.

40|$|I {{study the}} {{composition}} of international portfolios under collateral constraints and the implied cross-border transmission of shocks. I develop an international portfolio model with these features, in which leveraged investors seek diversification in both assets and <b>secured</b> <b>liabilities</b> and in which the pledgeable portion of assets adjusts {{to the state of}} the economy, reflecting borrowers' credit risk. The new analytical results are as follows. First, agents choose endogenously how much to borrow from each country. Second, the collateral constraint, being a contractual link between secured and unsecured financial instruments, permits to compute portfolios without an arbitrage condition between those classes of assets. Finally, haircuts adjust endogenously through the change in the collateral values. After estimating the parameters governing this adjustment, I find that both portfolios and international transmission mechanism are quite sensitive to leveraged investors' funding. As for portfolios, secured bonds have particularly effective hedging properties in managing the terms of trade risk. As for the international transmission, tightening haircuts affect the economic slowdown: initially severe contractions are followed by quick reversions to the long-term equilibrium. On a cumulative basis, these two effects compensate if haircuts adjust precisely to the economic state. But in case of uncertainty about this adjustment, collateral constraints are a source of risk which cannot be internationally diversified...|$|R

50|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} {{the introduction of the}} Pensions Act 1995, it was widely perceived that it was failing to offer the protection to pension scheme members that had been anticipated. The Occupational Pensions Regulatory Authority was perceived as being reactive, didactic and uncommercial. The minimum funding requirement had not prevented some pension schemes winding up with insufficient assets to <b>secure</b> their <b>liabilities,</b> amid considerable publicity. There was strong political pressure to establish a guarantee fund similar to the American Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. Much of the regulation was perceived to be unnecessarily restrictive. The Pensions Act 2004 was written to try to fix these deficiences. The Act introduced two new regulatory institutions: the Pensions Regulator, with the powers to require sponsoring companies to make contributions to ensure that scheme funding objectives are met; and the Pension Protection Fund, which would inherit the pension liabilities of a pension scheme in the event that a sponsoring company becomes insolvent.|$|R

40|$|Jurisdiction is the {{authority}} of a court to hear and decide a specific legal action. In resolving legal actions related to e-commerce which cross borders, there currently is no statutory solution to determine jurisdiction. Further, there is no uniform judicial rule within the United States. Thus, {{the answer to the}} question, where is internet jurisdiction, is determined on case by case through court action. E-commerce companies have expressed increasing concern about internet jurisdiction risk and are beginning to proactively respond to this risk by adapting their approach to e-commerce (Rice, 2004). This paper examines the questions of legal internet jurisdiction. The standards within the United States, as well as those applied in international disputes, are discussed and exemplified with legal cases. Finally, we recommend approaches for e-commerce companies to address internet jurisdiction risk, including a corporate strategy which incorporates an explicit internationalization policy, addresses both virtual and physical environments, and explicitly considers jurisdiction risk; a website policy; the use of technological mechanisms; compliance with international agreements, standards, and recommendations; and <b>securing</b> adequate <b>liability</b> insurance to reduce the financial exposure of internet liability...|$|R

40|$|The primary {{responsibility}} of the Chief Privacy Officer (CPO) is to protect online consumer privacy by developing an organization’s privacy policy and ensuring compliance with privacy laws and regulations. However, the explosive growth of internet use for business has brought about an escalation of concerns including reduced consumer confidence in internet-related business activities, risk of financial loss, and legal liability from sources categorized as external and internal to the organization. Does the new CPO position provide adequate consideration of the increasing risks? This paper discusses the far-reaching types of misconduct and risks organizations face. The paper concludes by recommending an expanded role for the CPO. In addition to overseeing internet privacy issues, the new role of Chief Privacy and Integrity Officer (CPIO) would encompass internet integrity. This entails formulating or reformulating an expressed internet use policy, undertaking on-going training and other means to maintain awareness of issues, monitoring internal sources, implementing defenses against external sources, and <b>securing</b> adequate <b>liability</b> insurance. The effectiveness of this new role, in overseeing these responsibilities, would be determined by assessing current operations, implementing proactive measures to reduce potential misuse, and continuously keeping abreast of technological advances, legislative and regulatory initiatives, and new areas of vulnerability. 1...|$|R
60|$|Whether {{it would}} not be good policy for the general {{government}} to assume all the wild lands in the rebellious States, and to devote the proceeds of their sale to actual settlers to the payment of the national debt, is worth consideration. Texas alone, on whose public lands our assumption of her indebtedness gives us an equitable claim, would suffice to <b>secure</b> our <b>liabilities</b> and to lighten our taxation, and in all cases of land granted to freedmen no title should vest till a fair price had been paid,--a principle no less essential to their true interests than our own. That these people, who are to be the peasantry of the future Southern States, should be made landholders, is the main condition of a healthy regeneration of that part of the country, and the one warranty of our rightful repossession of it. The wealth that makes a nation really strong, and not merely rich, is the opportunity for industry, intelligence, and well-being of its laboring population. This is the real country of poor men, as the great majority must always be. No glories of war or art, no luxurious refinement of the few, can give them a sense of nationality where this is wanting. If we free the slave without giving him a right in the soil, and the inducement to industry which this offers, we reproduce only a more specious form of all the old abuses. We leave all political {{power in the hands of}} the wealthy landholders, where it was before. We leave the poorer whites unemancipated, for we leave labor still at the mercy of capital, and with its old stigma of degradation. Blind to the lessons of all experience, we deliberately make the South what Ireland was when Arthur Young travelled there, the country richest in the world by nature, reduced to irredeemable poverty and hopeless weakness by an upper class who would not, and a lower class who could not, improve. We have no right to purchase dominion, no right to purchase even abolition, at such a price as that. No uti possidetis conveys any legitimate title, except on the condition of wise administration and mutual benefit.|$|R
40|$|American law {{has long}} afforded {{the state and}} its subdivisions of {{government}} an immunity from liability for tort. The Federal Government, the state, municipal corporations, and quasi-municipal corporations of various types, are exempted from tort accountability for their wrongful acts. In the past, the subdivisions which are the recipients of this immunity have not been reluctant to accept it. But criticism of this immunity, both as to the social merit of casting the entire burden of injuries caused by the activities of government on the individuals harmed rather than spreading the loss among the public for whose benefit the activities are carried on, and as to the theoretical and factual validity of the reasons which have been advanced for the existence of the rule, has been increasing in recent years. Because of this widespread dissatisfaction, the Federal Government and several states have by statute abrogated or limited in score the immunities to which they are otherwise entitled, and have in many areas permitted themselves to be sued for tort {{in the same manner as}} private individuals. Responsive to the same feeling of moral responsibility to citizens injured through their activities which has motivated more autonomous units of government to waive their immunity by statute, officials of a number of subdivisions have attempted to provide protection for injured persons by <b>securing</b> policies of <b>liability</b> insurance. The right of the person injured by the activities of such an insured subdivision to recover for his damage, for which damage the subdivision would not in the absence of insurance be accountable, is the matter here in question...|$|R
40|$|The rise {{of limited}} {{liability}} companies (LLCs) classified as partnerships for federal income tax purposes challenges traditional assumptions concerning the treatment of recourse and nonrecourse liabilities under Subchapter K. The complex rules of sections 704 (b) and 752 give little attention to liabilities that are recourse to the entity under section 1001 but for which no member bears the economic risk of loss under section 752. In comparison to traditional general or limited partnerships, however, LLCs {{are much more likely}} to incur such 2 ̆ 2 exculpatory 2 ̆ 2 liabilities because of the limited liability shield under state law. Although exculpatory liabilities are functionally quite similar to traditional nonrecourse <b>liabilities</b> <b>secured</b> by all of an LLC 2 ̆ 7 s assets, literal application of the section 704 (b) / 752 regulations with respect to such liabilities is fraught with difficulties. This article seeks to disentangle the treatment of exculpatory liabilities under the nonrecourse allocation rules and suggests several needed reforms. Although the conceptual model underlying the section 704 (b) / 752 regulations is derived from section 1001 and Tufts v. Commissioner, the drafters failed to clearly articulate and rationalize the manner in which the nonrecourse allocation rules deviate from the section 1001 standard. Consequently, uncertainty persists concerning the precise boundaries between the nonrecourse definitions of sections 704 (b), 752, and 1001. Ultimately, such uncertainty can be dispelled only if the section 704 (b) / 752 regulations construct a theory of nonrecourse allocations that is explicitly independent of the section 1001 standard...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} is to analyse the connections between agreements under Company law and the study of legal consequences of such bonds. The research is organized in three main sections. The first part is dedicated to reconstruct the theories of linked contracts and economic operations. It emerges the tendency of the legislator to legislate hypothesis of linked contracts in Business Law in order to achieve more certainty in business transactions. The second section is concentrated over hypothesis of linked contracts in Company Law provided by the legislature. It is therefore analysed the relationship between Company’s Agreements and Shareholders' Agreements, the relationship between Cooperative’s Agreement and Agreements with its own shareholders, the leveraged buy-out operations, the regulation of funding in relation to a specific transaction and the payment for share capital <b>secured</b> in Limited <b>Liability</b> Partnerships (In Italian Company's Law defined as «società a responsabilità limitata»). The third part concentrates on the analysis of a series of court judgements regarding hypothesis of linked contracts created pursuant to the power of autonomy of the parties: the connection between a Company’s Agreement and the agreement to sell a property to the same company; the connection between a Company’s Agreement and a contract between the company and his own shareholder; the connection between a Company’s Agreement and the stipulation of a shared property agreement with a shareholder. The analysis proceeds by focusing on three situations in which the connection is set up in a way to circumvent the law: in the first it is violated the rule to protect the integrity of the share capital, in the second the proper fulfilment of taxes and in the third one the pre-emption clause. The conclusions point out the characteristics of linked contracts in Company Law...|$|R
40|$|The {{issue of}} cost and {{availability}} of insurance, particularly for tourism operators, has become a common issue for the tourism industry across European Union. It has been particularly problematic in those jurisdictions that have {{a high number of}} adventure and eco-tourism operators. The main challenge appears to be in relation to <b>securing</b> commercial general <b>liability</b> coverage and/or obtaining such coverage on a cost effective basis. One of the problems is that the tourism industry does not understand the insurance industry, and vice versa. In response to this situation, the EU institutions had created a series of publications dealing with risk management and insurance. Another important thing is how to make comparative analysis of threats in tourism and the adaptation of tourist products in tourism (accidents, treatment and medical transport costs, compensation duties with regard to the civil liability). Many insurance companies created general conditions of this kind of insurance. There are different types of the insurance in tourism, voluntary and compulsory insurance, individual or group insurance contract. The terms and conditions of this type of insurance are defined in the insurance contract. Also the entities and the insurance event are specified in the contract. In that document, we can also find the duties of the insurer and the insurance company. Most insurance companies in EU have similar treatment of the costs abroad, also the transport to the native country, the stay of the closest person, rescue and search operation costs in the European Union and non- European countries. The question is how the assistance insurance in travel functions practically. Also the question is of the exclusion of insurance protection and the insurance of civil liability. Another important thing is the practice of the insurance of the property, transport insurance in travel, insurance of the organizer and a tourist middleman and costs of resigning from the participation in the trip and an earlier return and the...|$|R
