5|$|Boron {{is rare in}} the Universe {{and solar}} system due to trace {{formation}} in the Big Bang and in stars. It is formed in minor amounts in cosmic ray <b>spallation</b> nucleosynthesis and may be found uncombined in cosmic dust and meteoroid materials.|$|E
5|$|Isotopes such as lithium-6, {{as well as}} some {{beryllium}} and boron {{are generated}} in space through cosmic ray <b>spallation.</b> This occurs when a high-energy proton strikes an atomic nucleus, causing large numbers of nucleons to be ejected.|$|E
5|$|The {{most stable}} {{chlorine}} radioisotope is 36Cl. The primary decay mode of isotopes lighter than 35Cl is electron capture to isotopes of sulfur; that of isotopes heavier than 37Cl is beta decay to isotopes of argon; and 36Cl may decay by either mode to stable 36S or 36Ar. 36Cl occurs in trace quantities in {{nature as a}} cosmogenic nuclide in a ratio of about (7–10)×10−13 to 1 with stable chlorine isotopes: it is produced in the atmosphere by <b>spallation</b> of 36Ar by interactions with cosmic ray protons. In the top meter of the lithosphere, 36Cl is generated primarily by thermal neutron activation of 35Cl and <b>spallation</b> of 39K and 40Ca. In the subsurface environment, muon capture by 40Ca becomes more important {{as a way to}} generate 36Cl.|$|E
5|$|In addition, isotopic {{analysis}} of exposed terrestrial rocks has demonstrated the cosmogenic (cosmic ray) production of 21Ne. This isotope {{is generated by}} <b>spallation</b> reactions on magnesium, sodium, silicon, and aluminium. By analyzing all three isotopes, the cosmogenic component can be resolved from magmatic neon and nucleogenic neon. This suggests that neon will be a useful tool in determining cosmic exposure ages of surface rocks and meteorites.|$|E
5|$|Beryllium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Be and atomic number 4. It {{is a relatively}} rare element in the universe, usually occurring {{as a product of}} the <b>spallation</b> of larger atomic nuclei that have collided with cosmic rays. Within the cores of stars beryllium is depleted as it is fused and creates larger elements. It is a divalent element which occurs naturally only in combination with other elements in minerals. Notable gemstones which contain beryllium include beryl (aquamarine, emerald) and chrysoberyl. As a free element it is a steel-gray, strong, lightweight and brittle alkaline earth metal.|$|E
5|$|Boron is a {{chemical}} element with symbolB and atomic number5. Produced entirely by cosmic ray <b>spallation</b> and supernovae {{and not by}} stellar nucleosynthesis, it is a low-abundance element in the Solar system and in the Earth's crust. Boron is concentrated on Earth by the water-solubility of its more common naturally occurring compounds, the borate minerals. These are mined industrially as evaporites, such as borax and kernite. The largest known boron deposits are in Turkey, the largest producer of boron minerals.|$|E
5|$|Neutron {{diffraction}} is {{an excellent}} method for structure determination, {{although it has been}} difficult to obtain intense, monochromatic beams of neutrons in sufficient quantities. Traditionally, nuclear reactors have been used, although sources producing neutrons by <b>spallation</b> are becoming increasingly available. Being uncharged, neutrons scatter much more readily from the atomic nuclei rather than from the electrons. Therefore, neutron scattering is very useful for observing the positions of light atoms with few electrons, especially hydrogen, which is essentially invisible in the X-ray diffraction. Neutron scattering also has the remarkable property that the solvent can be made invisible by adjusting the ratio of normal water, H2O, and heavy water, D2O.|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} nuclear reactions which generate nucleogenic neon isotopes {{start from}} 24Mg and 25Mg, which produce 21Ne and 22Ne, respectively, after neutron capture and immediate emission of an alpha particle. The neutrons that produce the reactions are mostly produced by secondary <b>spallation</b> reactions from alpha particles, in turn derived from uranium-series decay chains. The net result yields a trend towards lower 20Ne/22Ne and higher 21Ne/22Ne ratios observed in uranium-rich rocks such as granites. 21Ne {{may also be}} produced in a nucleogenic reaction, when 20Ne absorbs a neutron from various natural terrestrial neutron sources.|$|E
5|$|In future manned interplanetary spacecraft, 10B has a {{theoretical}} role as structural material (as boron fibers or BN nanotube material) which would also serve a special {{role in the}} radiation shield. One of the difficulties in dealing with cosmic rays, which are mostly high energy protons, is that some secondary radiation from interaction of cosmic rays and spacecraft materials is high energy <b>spallation</b> neutrons. Such neutrons can be moderated by materials high in light elements such as polyethylene, but the moderated neutrons {{continue to be a}} radiation hazard unless actively absorbed in the shielding. Among light elements that absorb thermal neutrons, 6Li and 10B appear as potential spacecraft structural materials which serve both for mechanical reinforcement and radiation protection.|$|E
5|$|Niche uses {{of heavy}} metals with high atomic numbers occur in {{diagnostic}} imaging, electron microscopy, and nuclear science. In diagnostic imaging, heavy metals such as cobalt or tungsten {{make up the}} anode materials found in x-ray tubes. In electron microscopy, heavy metals such as lead, gold, palladium, platinum, or uranium are used to make conductive coatings and to introduce electron density into biological specimens by staining, negative staining, or vacuum deposition. In nuclear science, nuclei of heavy metals such as chromium, iron, or zinc are sometimes fired at other heavy metal targets to produce superheavy elements; heavy metals are also employed as <b>spallation</b> targets {{for the production of}} neutrons or radioisotopes such as astatine (using lead, bismuth, thorium, or uranium in the latter case).|$|E
5|$|Radioactive cosmogenic 10Be is {{produced}} in {{the atmosphere of the}} Earth by the cosmic ray <b>spallation</b> of oxygen. 10Be accumulates at the soil surface, where its relatively long half-life (1.36 million years) permits a long residence time before decaying to boron-10. Thus, 10Be and its daughter products are used to examine natural soil erosion, soil formation and the development of lateritic soils, and as a proxy for measurement of the variations in solar activity and the age of ice cores. The production of 10Be is inversely proportional to solar activity, because increased solar wind during periods of high solar activity decreases the flux of galactic cosmic rays that reach the Earth. Nuclear explosions also form 10Be by the reaction of fast neutrons with 13C in the carbon dioxide in air. This is one of the indicators of past activity at nuclear weapon test sites.|$|E
5|$|Because xenon is a tracer for two parent isotopes, xenon isotope ratios in meteorites are a {{powerful}} tool for studying the formation of the Solar System. The iodine–xenon method of dating gives the time elapsed between nucleosynthesis and the condensation of a solid object from the solar nebula. In 1960, physicist John H. Reynolds discovered that certain meteorites contained an isotopic anomaly {{in the form of an}} overabundance of xenon-129. He inferred that this was a decay product of radioactive iodine-129. This isotope is produced slowly by cosmic ray <b>spallation</b> and nuclear fission, but is produced in quantity only in supernova explosions. Because the half-life of 129I is comparatively short on a cosmological time scale (16 million years), this demonstrated that only a short time had passed between the supernova and the time the meteorites had solidified and trapped the 129I. These two events (supernova and solidification of gas cloud) were inferred to have happened during the early history of the Solar System, because the 129I isotope was likely generated shortly before the Solar System was formed, seeding the solar gas cloud with isotopes from a second source. This supernova source may also have caused collapse of the solar gas cloud.|$|E
5|$|In 1934, Willard Libby {{reported}} that he had found weak beta activity in pure neodymium, which was attributed to a half-life over 1012years. Almost 20 years later, it was claimed that the element occurs in natural neodymium in equilibrium in quantities below 10−20 grams of promethium per one gram of neodymium. However, these observations were disproved by newer investigations, because for all seven naturally occurring neodymium isotopes, any single beta decays (which can produce promethium isotopes) are forbidden by energy conservation. In particular, careful measurements of atomic masses show that the mass difference 150Nd-150Pm is negative (−87keV), which absolutely prevents the single beta decay of 150Nd to 150Pm. In 1965 O. Erämetsä separated out traces of 145Pm from a rare earth concentrate purified from and apatite, resulting in an upper limit of 10−21 for the abundance of promethium in nature; this may have been produced by the natural nuclear fission of uranium, or by cosmic ray <b>spallation</b> of 146Nd.|$|E
5|$|The longest-lived of the {{radioactive}} isotopes of iodine is iodine-129, {{which has a}} half-life of 15.7millionyears, decaying via beta decay to stable xenon-129. Some iodine-129 was formed along with iodine-127 before {{the formation of the}} Solar System, but it has by now completely decayed away, making it an extinct radionuclide that is nevertheless still useful in dating the history of the early Solar System or very old groundwaters, due to its mobility in the environment. Its former presence may be determined from an excess of its daughter xenon-129. Traces of iodine-129 still exist today, as it is also a cosmogenic nuclide, formed from cosmic ray <b>spallation</b> of atmospheric xenon: these traces make up 10−14 to 10−10 of all natural iodine. It also occurs from open-air nuclear testing, and is not hazardous because of its incredibly long half-life, the longest of all fission products. At the peak of thermonuclear testing in the 1960s and 1970s, iodine-129 still made up only about 10−7 of all natural iodine. Excited states of iodine-127 and iodine-129 are often used in Mössbauer spectroscopy.|$|E
25|$|This {{abundance}} {{difference is}} a result of the way secondary cosmic rays are formed. Carbon and oxygen nuclei collide with interstellar matter to form lithium, beryllium and boron in a process termed cosmic ray <b>spallation.</b> <b>Spallation</b> is also responsible for the abundances of scandium, titanium, vanadium, and manganese ions in cosmic rays produced by collisions of iron and nickel nuclei with interstellar matter.|$|E
25|$|<b>Spallation</b> — {{a nucleus}} is {{hit by a}} {{particle}} with sufficient energy and momentum to knock out several small fragments or smash it into many fragments.|$|E
25|$|Cosmic ray <b>spallation,</b> caused when {{cosmic rays}} impact the {{interstellar}} medium and fragment larger atomic species, is {{a significant source of}} the lighter nuclei, particularly 3He, 9Be and 10,11B, that are not created by stellar nucleosynthesis.|$|E
25|$|Two major {{facilities}} for materials research are in Lund University: MAX IV, {{which is a}} world-leading synchrotron radiation laboratory – inaugurated in June 2016, and European <b>Spallation</b> Source (ESS), a new European facility that will provide up to 100 times brighter neutron beams than existing facilities today, to be opened in 2023.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Spallation</b> Neutron Source (SNS) is a {{particle}} accelerator {{that has the}} highest intensity neutron pulses of any man-made neutron source. SNS was made operational in 2006 and has since been upgraded to 1megawatts with plans to continue up to 3megawatts. High power neutron pulses permit clearer images of the targets meaning smaller samples can be analysed and accurate results require fewer pulses.|$|E
25|$|The {{laboratory}} is home {{to several}} of the world's top supercomputers including the world's fourth most powerful supercomputer ranked by the TOP500, Titan, and is a leading neutron science and nuclear energy research facility that includes the <b>Spallation</b> Neutron Source and High Flux Isotope Reactor. ORNL hosts the Center for Nanophase Materials Sciences, the BioEnergy Science Center, and the Consortium for Advanced Simulation of Light-Water Reactors.|$|E
25|$|In 2009 S.A. Karamian et al. {{published}} {{the results of}} a four nation team's experimental measurements at Dubna for the production of quantities of 178m2Hf by <b>spallation</b> at energies as low as 80 MeV.Hf) and (p+natHf) reactions|doi=10.1016/j.nima.2008.12.001 |bibcode = 2009NIMPA.600..488K |display-authors=etal}} Besides significantly lowering the projected cost of production, this experimental result proved the accessibility to sources of 178m2Hf to be within the capabilities of the several idle cyclotron devices scattered around the world.|$|E
25|$|Producing {{deuterium}} by fission is also difficult. The {{problem here}} again is that deuterium is very unlikely due to nuclear processes, and that collisions between atomic nuclei are likely to result either in the fusion of the nuclei, or in the release of free neutrons or alpha particles. During the 1970s, cosmic ray <b>spallation</b> was proposed {{as a source of}} deuterium. That theory failed to account for the abundance of deuterium, but led to explanations of the source of other light elements.|$|E
25|$|This was {{followed}} by similar experiments on Perhapsatron and Columbus, demonstrating the same problems. When instabilities developed, areas of enormous electrical potential developed, rapidly accelerating protons in the area. These sometimes collided with neutrons in the plasma or the container walls, ejecting them through neutron <b>spallation.</b> These were the same sorts of instabilities seen in earlier machines, and precisely the problem Cockcroft had mentioned during the press releases, but in ZETA they were much more powerful and the neutrons appeared to be fusion related until further work demonstrated their nature. The promise of stabilised pinch disappeared.|$|E
25|$|There {{are three}} neutron sources at ORNL; the High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR), the Oak Ridge Electron Linear Accelerator (ORELA) and the <b>Spallation</b> Neutron Source. HFIR {{provides}} neutrons {{in a stable}} beam resulting from a constant nuclear reaction whereas ORELA and SNS produce pulses of neutrons as they are particle accelerators. HFIR went critical in 1965 and {{has been used for}} materials research and as a major source of medical radioisotopes since. As of 2013, HFIR provides the world's highest constant neutron flux as a result of various upgrades. As part of a US non-proliferation effort the HFIR is scheduled to switch from highly enriched uranium (>90%, weapons grade) to low-enriched (3–4%) in 2020; the last reactor in the US to do so. Berkelium used to produce the world's first sample of tennessine was produced in the High Flux Isotope Reactor as part of an international effort. HFIR is likely to operate until approximately 2060 before the reactor vessel is considered unsafe for continued use.|$|E
25|$|Radioactive {{beams of}} {{specific}} isotopes {{are widely used}} {{in the fields of}} experimental physics, biology and materials science. The production and formation of these radioactive atoms into an ionic beam for study is an entire field of research carried out at many laboratories throughout the world. The first isotope separator was developed at the Copenhagen Cyclotron by Bohr and coworkers using the principle of electromagnetic separation. Today, there are many laboratories around the world that supply beams of radioactive ions for use. Arguably the principal Isotope Separator On Line (ISOL) is ISOLDE at CERN, which is a joint European facility spread across the Franco-Swiss border near the city of Geneva. This laboratory uses mainly proton <b>spallation</b> of uranium carbide targets to produce a wide range of radioactive fission fragments that are not found naturally on earth. During <b>spallation</b> (bombardment with high energy protons), a uranium carbide target is heated to several thousand degrees so that radioactive atoms produced in the nuclear reaction are released. Once out of the target, the vapour of radioactive atoms travels to an ionizer cavity. This ionizer cavity is a thin tube made of a refractory metal with a high work function allowing for collisions with the walls to liberate a single electron from a free atom (surface ionization effect). Once ionized, the radioactive species are accelerated by an electrostatic field and injected into an electromagnetic separator. As ions entering the separator are of approximately equal energy, those ions with a smaller mass will be deflected by the magnetic field by a greater amount than those with a heavier mass. This differing radius of curvature allows for isobaric purification to take place. Once purified isobarically, the ion beam is then sent to the individual experiments. In order to increase the purity of the isobaric beam, laser ionization can take place inside the ionizer cavity to selectively ionize a single element chain of interest. At CERN, this device is called the Resonance Ionization Laser Ion Source (RILIS). Currently over 60% of all experiments opt to use the RILIS to increase the purity of radioactive beams.|$|E
25|$|Big Bang {{nucleosynthesis}} {{occurred within}} the first three minutes {{of the beginning of}} the universe and is responsible for much of the abundance of 1H (protium), 2H (D, deuterium), 3He (helium-3), and 4He (helium-4). Although 4He continues to be produced by stellar fusion and alpha decays and trace amounts of 1H continue to be produced by <b>spallation</b> and certain types of radioactive decay, most of the mass of the isotopes in the universe are thought to have been produced in the Big Bang. The nuclei of these elements, along with some 7Li and 7Be are considered to have been formed between 100 and 300 seconds after the Big Bang when the primordial quark–gluon plasma froze out to form protons and neutrons. Because of the very short period in which nucleosynthesis occurred before it was stopped by expansion and cooling (about 20 minutes), no elements heavier than beryllium (or possibly boron) could be formed. Elements formed during this time were in the plasma state, and did not cool to the state of neutral atoms until much later.|$|E
500|$|Trace {{amounts of}} the {{neptunium}} isotopes neptunium-237 and -239 are found naturally as decay products from [...] transmutation reactions in uranium ores. In particular, 239Np and 237Np {{are the most common}} of these isotopes; they are directly formed from neutron capture by uranium-238 atoms. These neutrons come from the spontaneous fission of uranium-238, naturally neutron-induced fission of uranium-235, cosmic ray <b>spallation</b> of nuclei, and light elements absorbing alpha particles and emitting a neutron. The half-life of 239Np is very short, although the detection of its much longer-lived daughter 239Pu in nature in 1951 definitively established its natural occurrence. In 1952, 237Np was identified and isolated from concentrates of uranium ore from the Belgian Congo: in these minerals, the ratio of neptunium-237 to uranium is {{less than or equal to}} about 10−12 to 1.|$|E
2500|$|... 3He is {{produced}} on Earth from three sources: lithium <b>spallation,</b> cosmic rays, and beta decay of tritium (3H). The contribution from cosmic rays is negligible within all except the oldest regolith materials, and lithium <b>spallation</b> reactions are a lesser contributor than {{the production of}} 4He by alpha particle emissions.|$|E
2500|$|Helium-3 {{is created}} by cosmic ray bombardment, and by lithium <b>spallation</b> {{reactions}} which generally occur in the crust. Lithium <b>spallation</b> is {{the process by which}} a high-energy neutron bombards a lithium atom, creating a 3He [...] and a 4He ion. This requires significant lithium to adversely affect the 3He/4He ratio.|$|E
2500|$|Cosmic ray <b>spallation</b> process {{reduces the}} atomic weight of {{interstellar}} matter {{by the impact}} with cosmic rays, to produce some of the lightest elements present in the universe (though not {{a significant amount of}} deuterium). Most notably <b>spallation</b> is believed to be responsible for the generation of almost all of 3He and the elements lithium, beryllium, and boron, although some [...] and [...] are thought to have been produced in the Big Bang. The <b>spallation</b> process results from the impact of cosmic rays (mostly fast protons) against the interstellar medium. These impacts fragment carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen nuclei present. The process results in the light elements beryllium, boron, and lithium in the cosmos at much greater abundances than they are found within solar atmospheres. The quantities of the light elements 1H and 4He produced by <b>spallation</b> are negligible relative to their primordial abundance.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>spallation</b> of China {{in various}} regions and kingdoms {{led to a}} {{diversification}} of Chan factions {{as reflected in the}} Five Houses of Chán. The Fayan school was especially influential in the Southern Tang (937-975) and Wuyue (907-978). It propagated jiaochan yizhi, [...] "harmony between Chan and the Teaching", in opposition to jiaowai biechuan, [...] "a special transmission outside the teaching", the latter eventually becoming one of the defining slogans of Chan.|$|E
2500|$|The federal {{government}} projects at Oak Ridge are reduced {{in size and}} scope, but are still the city's principal economic activity {{and one of the}} biggest employers in the Knoxville metropolitan area. The Department of Energy owns the federal sites and maintains a major office in the city. Oak Ridge National Laboratory is the largest multipurpose lab in the Department of Energy's National Laboratory system. It is home to the <b>Spallation</b> Neutron Source, a 1.4 billion dollar project completed in 2006, and [...] "Titan", one of the world's most powerful scientific supercomputers, which has peak performance of more than one quadrillion operations per second.|$|E

50|$|<b>Spallation</b> is {{a process}} in which {{fragments}} of material (spall) are ejected from a body due to impact or stress. In the context of impact mechanics it describes ejection or vaporization of material from a target during impact by a projectile. In planetary physics, <b>spallation</b> describes meteoritic impacts on a planetary surface and the effects of a stellar wind on a planetary atmosphere. In the context of mining or geology, <b>spallation</b> can refer to pieces of rock breaking off a rock face due to the internal stresses in the rock; it commonly occurs on mine shaft walls. In the context of anthropology, <b>spallation</b> {{is a process}} used to make stone tools such as arrowheads by knapping. In nuclear physics, <b>spallation</b> is the process in which a heavy nucleus emits a large number of nucleons as a result of being hit by a high-energy particle, thus greatly reducing its atomic weight.|$|E
