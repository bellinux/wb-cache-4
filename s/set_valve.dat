40|$|Layflat tubing, or {{flexible}} pipe, is {{used for}} both distribution and conveyance of irrigation water and has many {{of the advantages of}} rigid surface irrigation pipe. The tubing described in this article is uniquely constructed with an interior membrane so as to form a dual-conduit tube. This permits the tube to be used both for water conveyance and distribution. Manual, semi-automatic, and fully automatic diverter valves were developed to direct water flow either {{to one side of the}} membrane for distribution through outlets in the side of the tube, or to the opposite side of the membrane for water conveyance to the next irrigation set(s). In the conveyance mode, the membrane covers the distribution outlets or gates in the side of the tube. To change irrigation sets manually, the irrigator either pulls or pushes a handle on a diverter valve to change the tube's operating mode. This eliminates manually opening individual gates for the next succeeding set and closing all of the gates of the previous <b>set.</b> <b>Valve</b> and coupler fittings were designed to be easily assembled and disassembled. The tubing system was satisfactorily tested and evaluated on three farms. The tubing was also tested for surge irrigation by controlling an automatic diverter valve with a surge controller. KEYWORDS.

40|$|A rocket {{test stand}} and {{associated}} subsystems are complex devices whose operation requires that certain preparatory calculations {{be carried out}} before a test. In addition, real-time control calculations must be performed during the test, and further calculations are carried out after a test is completed. The latter may be {{required in order to}} evaluate if a particular test conformed to specifications. These calculations are used to <b>set</b> <b>valve</b> positions, pressure setpoints, control gains and other operating parameters so that a desired system behavior is obtained and the test can be successfully carried out. Currently, calculations are made in an ad-hoc fashion and involve trial-and-error procedures that may involve activating the system with the sole purpose of finding the correct parameter settings. The goals of this project are to develop mathematical models, control methodologies and associated simulation environments to provide a systematic and comprehensive prediction and real-time control capability. The models and controller designs are expected to be useful in two respects: 1) As a design tool, a model {{is the only way to}} determine the effects of design choices without building a prototype, which is, in the context of rocket test stands, impracticable; 2) As a prediction and tuning tool, a good model allows to set system parameters off-line, so that the expected system response conforms to specifications. This includes the setting of physical parameters, such as valve positions, and the configuration and tuning of any feedback controllers in the loop...|$|E

50|$|This type {{of engine}} still has tappet noise even after adjustment. This noise is said {{to come from the}} cams due to {{incorrect}} <b>valve</b> setup (when <b>setting</b> <b>valve</b> clearance each cylinder must be set to TDC) or from age and use of incorrect oil grade. The correct oil grade is 5W-30 semi synthetic oil. Another reason is the large tappet clearance on the exhaust valve. This could of course be reduced to lower the noise level but the engine would then suffer from a rough idle and usually stalled.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the reasons}} for the success of the Apollo program was the {{redundancy}} of critical systems - in the case of the SPS, there were two independent valve systems for the engine. The short in the switch only affected one of these <b>sets</b> of <b>valves</b> and as such it was still possible to fire the engine. But instead of having both <b>sets</b> of <b>valves</b> open at the start of each ignition, only the trouble-free valves would be used. For long burns, the valves affected by the short would be opened only after ten seconds, and closed before the end of the burn.|$|R
