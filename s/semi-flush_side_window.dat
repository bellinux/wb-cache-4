50|$|There were {{numerous}} differences between 6170 {{and the other}} rebuilt Scots. 6170's boiler was longer {{and it had a}} new cab with <b>side</b> <b>windows,</b> whereas the other rebuilt Scots retained their old cut-out cabs (the rebuilt Jubilees retained their original <b>side</b> <b>window</b> cabs and the rebuilt Patriots gained new <b>side</b> <b>window</b> cabs). It was the only rebuilt Scot built with a single chimney. Changes during its lifetime saw the fitting of a double chimney and smoke deflectors.|$|R
40|$|Flow {{over an open}} <b>side</b> <b>window</b> in a car {{exhibits}} similar {{characteristics as}} the flow over an open cavity. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation over a cavity was done as a benchmark. The unsteady flow simulation was carried out using Scale Adaptive Simulation (SAS) turbulence model. The benchmark results, frequency and sound pressure levels of feedback and resonance modes, all well matched with the experimental data. Then, with the right rear window, for example, the mechanism of the <b>side</b> <b>window</b> buffeting was investigated. The simulation results show that <b>side</b> <b>window</b> buffeting noise is generated by large scale vortices and in low frequency. Furthermore, buffeting noise characteristics under several patterns of <b>side</b> <b>windows</b> opening were also numerically investigated. As a result, rear window buffeting noise is more severe than that of front window when one window open, and combination pattern of <b>side</b> <b>windows</b> open can reduce buffeting noise. To decrease the interior noise and improve car ride comfort, four suppression measures through adding a <b>side</b> <b>window</b> weather deflector at the A-pillars, constructing a cavity at the B-pillars, combination of {{the front and rear}} windows and installing a row of square cylinder deflector at the B-pillars were also studied, respectively. In conclusion, certain noise reduction can be achieved through four passive control methods...|$|R
