500|$|Two dies {{are used}} in die casting; one is called the [...] "cover die half" [...] and the other the [...] "ejector die half". Where they meet is called the parting line. The cover die {{contains}} the sprue (for hot-chamber machines) or <b>shot</b> <b>hole</b> (for cold-chamber machines), which allows the molten metal to flow into the dies; this feature matches up with the injector nozzle on the hot-chamber machines or the shot chamber in the cold-chamber machines. The ejector die contains the ejector pins and usually the runner, which is the path from the sprue or <b>shot</b> <b>hole</b> to the mold cavity. The cover die is secured to the stationary, or front, platen of the casting machine, while the ejector die {{is attached to the}} movable platen. The mold cavity is cut into two cavity inserts, which are separate pieces that can be replaced relatively easily and bolt into the die halves.|$|E

They were both {{furnaces}} of glowing fire. Though they {{had come from the}} harbour to certain battle, not a wooden bulkhead, nor a partition in the quarters either of officers or men had been taken out, nor had trunks and chests been sent ashore. Neither had the wooden decks nor any other wooden fixtures been prepared to resist fire. Apparently the crew had not even wet down the decks.|$|E
40|$|Over {{the next}} several weeks, non-Bt cornfields should be scouted for European corn borers. If populations do exceed the {{economic}} threshold, treatment is warranted to prevent substantial yield loss. Scouting should start in the tallest cornfields because adults (moths) are often attracted to these fields in larger numbers. Look for <b>shot</b> <b>holes</b> in the leaves after corn reaches 17 to 21 inches in extended leaf height. When <b>shot</b> <b>holes</b> or larvae {{are found in the}} taller corn, scout fields with smaller corn. There is very little reason to scout a field for larvae if no <b>shot</b> <b>holes</b> are detected in the leaves...|$|R
5000|$|The present {{structure}} was designed on the [...] "L" [...] plan, {{with a round}} tower at the north-east angle. The main building rose to five stories and the tower to six stories in height. The main building measured 55 by 32 ft. The hall, on the first floor, measured 44 by 20 feet. The main entrance was in the north wall of the wing of the castle. There are <b>shot</b> <b>holes</b> used to guard the main door {{and there are also}} <b>shot</b> <b>holes</b> under the staircases and in the walls of the tower.|$|R

[...] "I got the news from a feller, that said he'd got it from a feller, that saw a feller, who said he'd heard a feller tell another feller, that he saw a black feller in the bush, somewhere or other 'tween this and the other end o' the island, with a <b>shot</b> <b>hole</b> in his right arm, running like a cogolampus, with ten pirates in full chase. Ah! oh! have mercy, Henry; really my {{constitution}} will break down if you--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "After {{some little}} delay {{a boy of}} about fifteen years of age {{appeared}}, [...] whose left arm was {{wrapped up in a}} dirty rag. Removing this, I found [...] the left hand had been hacked off by the wrist, and that a <b>shot</b> <b>hole</b> [...] appeared in the fleshy part of the forearm. The boy, who gave his name [...] as I I, in answer to my inquiry, said that a sentry of the La Lulanga [...] Company now in the town had cut off his hand. I proceeded to look for [...] this man, who at first could not be found, the natives to a [...] considerable number gathering behind me as I walked through the town. [...] After some delay the sentry appeared, carrying a cap-gun. The boy, [...] whom I placed before him, then accused him to his face of having [...] mutilated him. The men of the town, who were questioned in [...] succession, corroborated the boy's statement. The sentry, who gave his [...] name as K K, could make no answer to the charge. He met it by vaguely [...] saying some other sentry of the Company had mutilated I I; his [...] predecessor, he said, had cut off several hands, and probably this was [...] one of the victims. The natives around said that there were two other [...] sentries at present in the town, who were not so bad as K K, but that [...] he was a villain. As the evidence against him was perfectly clear, man [...] after man standing out and declaring he had seen the act committed, I [...] informed him and the people present that I should appeal to the local [...] authorities for his immediate arrest and trial." ...|$|E
60|$|Besides the courts, {{there are}} {{installed}} {{under the same}} roof no less than three libraries: two of no mean order; confused and semi-subterranean, full of stairs and galleries; where you may see the most studious-looking wigs fishing out novels by lantern light, in the very place where the old Privy Council tortured Covenanters. As the Parliament House is built upon a slope, although it presents only one story to the north, it measures half-a-dozen at least upon the south; and range after range of vaults extend below the libraries. Few places are more characteristic of this hilly capital. You descend one stone stair after another, and wander, by the flicker of a match, in a labyrinth of stone cellars. Now, you pass below the Outer Hall and hear overhead, brisk but ghostly, the interminable pattering of legal feet. Now, you come upon a strong door with a wicket: on the other side are the cells of the police office and the trap-stair that gives admittance to the dock in the Justiciary Court. Many a foot that has gone up there lightly enough, has been dead-heavy in the descent. Many a man's life has been argued away from him during long hours in the court above. But just now that tragic stage is empty and silent like a church on a week-day, with the bench all sheeted up and nothing moving but the sunbeams on the wall. A little farther and you strike upon a room, not empty like the rest, but crowded with productions from bygone criminal cases: a grim lumber: lethal weapons, poisoned organs in a jar, a door with a <b>shot</b> <b>hole</b> through the panel, behind which a man fell dead. I cannot fancy why they should preserve them, unless it were against the Judgment Day. At length, as you continue to descend, you see a peep of yellow gaslight and hear a jostling, whispering noise ahead; next moment you turn a corner, and there, in a whitewashed passage, is a machinery belt industriously turning on its wheels. You would think the engine had grown there of its own accord, like a cellar fungus, and would soon spin itself out and fill the vaults from end to end with its mysterious labours. In truth, it is only some gear of the steam ventilator; and you will find the engineers at hand, and may step out of their door into the sunlight. For all this while, you have not been descending towards the earth's centre, but only {{to the bottom of the}} hill and the foundations of the Parliament House; low down, to be sure, but still under the open heaven and in a field of grass. The daylight shines garishly on the back windows of the Irish quarter; on broken shutters, wry gables, old palsied houses on the brink of ruin, a crumbling human pig-sty fit for human pigs. There are few signs of life, besides a scanty washing or a face at a window: the dwellers are abroad, but they will return at night and stagger to their pallets.|$|E
50|$|The {{rectangular}} {{tower and}} measures about 27 ft by 22 ft, with walls of about 4 ft thick. The external {{walls of the}} castle survive intact, although the tower is roofless. The inside of the tower is entirely ruined, but {{the remains of a}} vaulted basement, used as a kitchen, and a spiral turnpike staircase can still be seen. At the top of the stair is a gabled cap house. An unusual feature at Knock are the defensive <b>shot</b> <b>holes</b> for pistols, of which three are located under each of the numerous windows. The <b>shot</b> <b>holes</b> are all angled to the ground, with the centre one pointing forward and the two outer holes pointing slightly askew.|$|R
5000|$|Chambers {{were usually}} driven from the bottom, {{by means of}} a [...] "roofing shaft" [...] which was then {{continued}} across the width of the chamber: the chamber would then be worked downwards. Slate was freed from the rockface by blasting in <b>shot</b> <b>holes</b> hammered (and later drilled) into the rock.|$|R
50|$|On 16 August 1972, as Hassan was {{returning}} to Morocco from a personal visit to France, four air force pilots, flying Northrop F-5 fighter jets, attacked the Boeing 727. The planes <b>shot</b> <b>holes</b> through the fuselage, killing some passengers. One plane broke off, strafing a nearby airfield and killing many on the ground.|$|R
50|$|<b>Shot</b> <b>hole</b> {{disease is}} a major concern of the stone fruit industry. It is {{estimated}} that 80% of the California almond crop may be infested with <b>shot</b> <b>hole</b> disease, resulting in a potential yield loss of 50-75%. In the 1930s, it was found that applications of Bordeaux mixture reduces <b>shot</b> <b>hole</b> disease on peaches from 80% to 9%.|$|E
50|$|<b>Shot</b> <b>hole</b> disease (also called Coryneum blight) is {{a serious}} fungal disease that creates BB-sized holes in leaves, rough areas on fruit, and {{concentric}} lesions on branches. The pathogen that causes <b>shot</b> <b>hole</b> disease is Wilsonomyces carpophilus.|$|E

25|$|The tee <b>shots</b> on <b>Holes</b> 1, 3, 8, 15 and 17 are blind, {{and there}} are several blind {{approach}} <b>shots</b> on <b>Holes</b> 2, 6 and 14. The second and third <b>shots</b> at <b>Hole</b> 9 are blind, depending on length. There also are several holes that are semi-blind; the surface of the green cannot be seen when playing approach <b>shots</b> on <b>Holes</b> 5, 10, 18, and on 15 (for the long hitter). These blind shots are only blind once. Still, they do make Wykagyl difficult to play for a golfer who has never seen it before. Wykagyl is unique in its mix of par threes, par fours and par fives. Most 18-hole courses have four par threes, four par fives and ten par fours, but Wykagyl has five par fives, five par threes and eight par fours.|$|R
5000|$|The {{schooner}} subsequently supported {{operations on}} the Mississippi River especially against Vicksburg {{and served in}} the Gulf of Mexico. Sailing north for repairs, she nearly foundered from leaks through old <b>shot</b> <b>holes</b> but was saved by assistance from Vicksburg and steamed to Beaufort, North Carolina. She later decommissioned at New York City 14 June.|$|R
50|$|The seam was 4 foot 9 inch thick, and colliers drilled <b>shot</b> <b>holes</b> 18 {{inches from}} the roof at intervals. These <b>shot</b> <b>holes</b> were charged and fired by a deputy. The day shift deputy, George Paley, had fired 8 shots before he reached the working place known as number 8. Each shot used 6 ounces of {{explosive}}, and Paley had started with 5 pounds of explosive in his canister. Paley fired his ninth shot at one side of No.8’s gate without incident. The explosion occurred when Paley fired his tenth shot 6 yards {{to the right of}} the centre of No.8’s gate, five minutes after his ninth shot. A large accumulation of firedamp in explosive proportions had accumulated in the workings at the moment the shot was fired. The resulting explosion was slightly exacerbated by coal dust, which increased the flame of the explosion.|$|R
5000|$|Stigmina carpophila is a fungal plant {{pathogen}} causing <b>shot</b> <b>hole</b> disease in stone fruits (Prunus spp.). It is newly named as Wilsonomyces carpophilus.|$|E
50|$|The first clade proposed, E. fornicatus {{sensu stricto}} (commonly called the tea <b>shot</b> <b>hole</b> borer), is {{original}} from southern Southeast Asia and was introduced into Hawaii and Florida. A second clade, the Kuroshio <b>shot</b> <b>hole</b> borer, {{is believed to}} have originated in the Pacific islands and has since been introduced into San Diego county, California. The third clade is thought to originate from a more northern range in Southeast Asia and to have since been introduced into Los Angeles, California and Israel. This last clade has been given the common name Polyphagous <b>shot</b> <b>hole</b> borer in reference to the very broad host range. It has been severely affecting avocado trees in association with several Fusarium species. Multiple populations of the E. fornicatus complex have been introduced throughout the world, causing different damage in each region where they have been recently introduced.|$|E
50|$|<b>Shot</b> <b>hole</b> affects almonds by disrupting {{both the}} leaves and {{the fruit of the}} plant. It can result in {{premature}} nut ripening and plant defoliation. In some occasions, especially when rain persists in the springtime, complete defoliation and tree weakening can occur. Estimates have shown that approximately 80% of California's almond acres are infected with this fungus. A four-year research project by the Almond Board of California determined that production losses from <b>shot</b> <b>hole</b> could range from 50 to 75%. Captan in one to three applications has been used as the primary fungicide to combat this disease. It has been shown to reduce lesions per fruit by 96%.|$|E

50|$|The castle {{is built}} in the Z-plan form, {{comprising}} a rectangular main block with towers at opposite corners. A courtyard {{was added to the}} south in the 17th century. The castle is notable for its defensive architecture, unusual for the period, including a large number of <b>shot</b> <b>holes.</b> The large staircase has been compared to the stair at Fyvie Castle in Aberdeenshire.|$|R
50|$|There is a {{circular}} <b>shot</b> <b>hole</b> {{cut into the}} stairs {{between the first and}} second floors. The roof houses a chemin de ronde around the gables, a high rectangular chimney crowned with twin lozenge-shaped flues and corbels which once supported a corner bartizan.|$|E
50|$|A spot {{refers to}} a {{well-defined}} area of gray or brown necrotic tissue. Spots are very common on leaves and fruits and {{are probably the most}} familiar necrotic symptom. Sometimes the necrotic tissue within a leaf spot may crack and fall off from the surrounding green tissue leaving an empty space. Such a symptom is known as a <b>shot</b> <b>hole.</b>|$|E

50|$|Euwallacea fornicatus, {{commonly}} known as the tea <b>shot</b> <b>hole</b> borer, is an invasive ambrosia beetle (Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Scolytinae: Xyleborini) that causes economic losses when introduced into a new region. As the rest of the ambrosia beetles, E. fornicatus larvae and adults feed on a symbiotic fungus carried in a specific structure called mycangium. In E. fornicatus, the mycangium is located in the mandible. The combination of massive numbers of beetles with the symbiotic fungus kill trees, even though the fungus alone is a weak pathogen.|$|E
50|$|The inquiry then {{considered}} how {{the coal}} dust {{might have been}} ignited. Four possibilities were considered: Open lights (lamps or matches), shot firing, sparking from friction and electricity. No evidence of faulty lights or contraband was found (though there remains {{the question of the}} Howart's Patent Deflector reported at the 1933 inquiry). All shots were accounted for and every <b>shot</b> <b>hole</b> inspected; none was fired at the time or shortly before the explosion. Friction from tubs (coal wagons) against the rails or following a derailment was considered and dismissed.|$|E
50|$|Although {{the disease}} {{is caused by a}} {{relatively}} new symbiosis, it has already spread to a number of different counties, and is completely wiping out oak trees. As mentioned before, this is partially due to disease symptoms that are similar to other diseases leading to a misdiagnosis, it most resembles bacterial wetwood, polyphagous <b>shot</b> <b>hole</b> borer (PSHB), and fusarium dieback. With the recent outbreak and growth in population of the western bark beetle, there is concern that the pathogen's range will expand. Oak trees are important for wildlife diversity and for the ecological services they provide like habitat, shelter and food.|$|E
