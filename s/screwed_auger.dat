For each DEM corn shape approximation, virtual Design Of Experiments (DOE) with four DEM material interaction coefficients as independent parameters and reproducing AOR test initial conditions were developed in EDEM to simulate AOR grain flow behavior. AOR values from quasi-static corn flow on flat plate were measured in lab and compared with the DOE DEM simulation. The DEM corn with 2 -sphere and the material interaction coefficients showed good prediction to the experimental corn AOR test with minimum corn height test and DEM prediction difference of Mean Square Error (MSE) (5. 31 mm 2) compared to 1 -sphere, 5 -sphere and 13 -spheres.

5000|$|Henry was an {{intellectual}} who helped found Lancaster’s Juliana Library-Company in 1759, which during the Revolution and after was housed in his residence, {{and he held}} membership in the American Philosophical Society in Philadelphia, whose first Transactions (1771) printed Henry's account of his invention of a [...] "Description of a Self-Moving or Sentinel Register" [...] to regulate the flue of a furnace. Henry invented a <b>screw</b> <b>auger,</b> manufactured and sold exclusively at his Lancaster store, and some credit him with inventing the steamboat: the twelve-year-old Robert Fulton, a Lancaster neighbor, visited Henry in 1777, who had been experimenting since 1763 on boats with steam engines on the Conestoga River (Fulton's own experiments began only in 1786 in England). Henry {{and his family were}} members of the Moravian Congregation at Lancaster.

50|$|In {{agriculture}} and manufacturing, an elevator/lift is {{any type of}} conveyor device used to lift materials in a continuous stream into bins or silos. Several types exist, such as the chain and bucket elevator, grain <b>auger</b> <b>screw</b> conveyor using the principle of Archimedes' screw, or the chain and paddles or forks of hay elevators.|$|R
50|$|Various other {{applications}} of the <b>screw</b> or <b>auger</b> conveyor include its use in snowblowers, to move snow towards an impeller, where it is thrown into the discharge chute. Combine harvesters use both enclosed and open augers to move the unthreshed crop into the threshing mechanism and to move the grain {{into and out of}} the machine's hopper. Ice resurfacers use augers to remove loose ice particles from the surface of the ice. An auger is also a central component of an injection molding machine. An auger is used in some rubbish compactors to push the rubbish into a lowered plate at one end for compaction.|$|R

2500|$|The {{benefits}} of continuous presses is the [...] "continuous" [...] sequence that allows {{large volumes of}} grapes to be pressed with minimum labor involvement.

The throughput is limited by the capacity of the tank and the diameter of the screw or width of the belts. Many models of continuous screw presses can process from 50 to upwards of a 100 metric tonnes an hour. This can be a significant advantage for a high volume winery compared to batch presses that often only process 1 to 5 tonnes an hour.|$|R
40|$|A {{pelletizing}} {{machine for}} the production of fish feed was designed and developed. It consists of a hopper, barrel which houses the <b>screw</b> conveyor (<b>auger),</b> the cutting knife and the die orifice. The machine is driven by a 2 kW, 1420 rpm single phase electric motor. The performance evaluation of the machine was carried out. The aim was to investigate the effects of moisture contents and the speed of operation on the performance of the machine. It was observed that the pelletizing efficiency, throughput capacity and the percentage recovery of the machine increased with the increase in moisture content and the speed of the machine. The machine showed higher throughput capacity of 19. 7 kg/h with maximum pelletizing efficiency of 87. 6 %. Moisture content constituted a greater portion of variability in efficiency than speed. A unit increase in moisture content resulted in an increase of about 20 % in pelleting efficiency whereas a corresponding unit increase in speed only increased the pelletizing efficiency by 3 %. The machine does not make use of steam thereby making it easier to operate. The adoption of the pelletizing machine by small and medium scale farmers {{would go a long way}} in helping them to produce their own feed with local contents thereby alleviating the problems associated with the sourcing of imported feeds...|$|R
40|$|Some {{methods of}} {{polymeric}} materials waste recycling have been analyzed {{in this paper}} and the prospects of the theory development as well as extrusion technology and co-extruding processes have been shown. The purpose of this work was an analytical research of the backpressure in different sectors of the extruder when the pressed bulk moves through it and improvement of the working conditions of the device to fit the technology of plastics waste processing. The recommendations as to the calculation of the required design parameters of the screw, as the main structural element of the extruder, have been developed {{as a result of}} research, which makes it possible to achieve better processing of the pressed bulk under specified temperature and rate conditions due to the levelling of the backpressure and pumping effect in all sections of the device. The proposed upgrading provides productivity levelling in all sections of the extruder, which excludes intermittent work, breaks and thickness unevenness of the manufactured products.

30|$|Bio-oils were {{produced}} from cedar wood meal at 450, 480, 500, and 550  °C using the bench-scale auger reactor shown in Fig.  1. The wood meal was fed at 5.23 – 6.35  g/min for 90  min along with 2 L/min nitrogen into the cylindrical reactor (inside diameter: 40  mm, length: 789  mm) with an internal auger lying along the reactor’s axis. The {{distance between the}} <b>screws</b> of the <b>auger</b> was approximately 28  mm, and the auger speed was 20  rpm. The heating zone for pyrolysis was 305  mm long along the reactor axis. In the heating zone, N 2 velocity calculated from the reactor inside diameter and N 2 flow is more than 2.65  cm/s, which indicates that the vapor residence time in that zone can be shorter than 11.5  s. After pyrolysis, the char was moved to a vapor-char separation zone and dropped into a char collector. The vapor-char separation zone was lower than the chip supply zone in the reactor, which was inclined at an angle of 11 °. To separate the non-condensable gases and bio-oil, two cyclones (Cyclone- 1 and Cyclone- 2) were cooled with two water cooling circulation systems at 20 and 4  °C, respectively. The non-condensable gases were washed with a wet scrubber and collected in gas bags at 5 L/min. The collected gas was analyzed using a GC/thermal conductivity detector (TCD) GC- 7000 (J-science lab) as previously reported (Kojima et al. 2014). Ultimate analysis of the char was provided by Shimadzu techno-research.|$|R
40|$|This study {{identifies}} {{the cause of}} unstable vibrations that sporadically occur in decanting centrifuges as being caused {{by a combination of}} internal bearing clearance, conveyor unbalance and low bearing loads. These centrifuges are different from other rotating equipment common in industry (pumps, fans, compressors, electric motors) in that they are dual rotor systems – one rotor inside the other. Unbalance in either rotor can produce severe vibration of the whole machine when the running speed is close to a mode of vibration – that is, running at or near a critical speed. The external rotor, called the bowl, is subjected to an internal pressure generated by the centrifugal force of the product being separated. The internal rotor is supported from the bowl and {{is in the form of}} an <b>auger</b> <b>screw.</b> The main supporting bearings are subjected to forces from both the bowl and the auger - the liquid end bearing also supports the gearbox. Being able to predict critical speeds through numerical or computational analysis is a necessary step in the design process or for troubleshooting vibration problems. As part of the study, the main rolling element bearings were replaced by oil-film journal bearings to assess the viability of their use. Journal bearings are simpler, of lower cost and generate less noise than their rolling element counterparts. However, instability in running above the first critical speed can result due to oil film forces and internal hysteresis of the rotor assembly. The auger is asymmetric so instability in running is possible at around half the first critical speed. This study was undertaken to understand the dynamics of decanting type centrifuges and develop a methodology for identifying their critical speeds and cause of unstable vibration. In the longer term this will assist in the generation of new designs that are quieter, use less energy and have better separation efficiencies...|$|R
40|$|From {{the point}} of view of the {{effectiveness}} of the top cutting unit, the helix angle in the end portion of the screw is the most important and characteristic parameter, as it determines the pressure of the meat material in the zone of interaction of a knife and grate. The importance of solving the problem of mathematical modeling of geometry is due to the need to address the problem of minimizing the reverse flow of the food material when injecting into the cutting zone, as the specified effect of "locking" significantly reduces the performance of the transfer process, increases energy consumption of the equipment and entails the deterioration of the quality of the raw materials output. The problem of determining the length of the helix variable pitch for screw chopper food materials has been formulated and solved by methods of differential geometry. The task of correct description of the law of changing the angle of helix inclination along its length has been defined in this case as a key to provide the required dependence of this angle tangent on the angle of the radius-vector of the circle. It has been taken into account that the reduction in the pitch of the screw in the direction of the product delivery should occur at a decreasing rate. The parametric equation of the helix has been written in the form of three functional dependencies of the corresponding cylindrical coordinates. Based on the wide range analysis and significant number of models of tops from different manufacturers the boundaries of possible changes in the angles of inclination of the helical line of the first and last turns of the screw have been identified. The <b>auger</b> <b>screw</b> length is determined mathematically in the form of an analytical relationship and both as a function of the variable angle of its rise, and as a function of the rotation angle of the radius-vector of the circle generatrix, which makes it possible to expand the design possibilities of this node. Along with this the mathematical expression has been obtained for calculating the length of the auger body necessary in the study and calculation of energy costs for the product movement processes. The developed theoretical materials are in good agreement with the experimental data available in the literature on the investigation of press and extrusion mechanisms, this will make it possible to apply them effectively in the design practice...|$|R
40|$|Lakeland Steel Limited {{developed}} a pilot plant for biomass pyrolysis based on sawdust. The pilot plant {{was based on}} an <b>auger</b> <b>screw</b> design which was indirectly heated using a double pipe heat exchange configuration to prevent oxidation (combustion) of the feedstock. This thesis covers the preliminary assessment of sawdust pyrolysis for R. H Tregoweth sawmills on behalf of Lakeland Steel Limited. Proximate and ultimate analyses were deployed on the sawdust to determine its composition. Proximate analysis results gave a moisture content of 60 %. The dry solids had an organic matter content of 99. 22 % with ash making the balance. Ultimate analysis was used to determine content levels of elemental carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen sulphur and oxygen. The results on a dry basis were 47. 2 %, 6. 5 %, 0. 3 %, 0. 3 %, and 44. 9 % respectively. Drying models were also used to analyse the sawdust drying characteristics. Drying curves were obtained experimentally and four models: Newton; Page; Henderson and Pabis; and Simpson and Tschernitz, were fitted to the data and their accuracy of fit was determined using residual squared sum of errors. Page’s model was used to describe the sawdust behaviour in the dryer design as it had the highest accuracy. The sawdust reaction kinetics were determined using data from thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and analysed using distributed action energy model. The kinetics were observed at three heating rates of 10, 20 and 30 °C/min with a maximum temperature of 900 °C under an argon atmosphere. Sawdust was modelled as a mixture of water, hemicellulose, cellulose and lignin. Good agreement between Gaussian distribution functions for each component and experimental data were observed. Pilot plant trials were performed using a three factor-three level design of experiment. The factors under investigation were; feedstock moisture content with levels at 15, 30 and 60; reaction temperature with levels at 400, 450 and 500 °C; and reactor auger speed with levels at 15, 20 and 25 rpm. Experiments at 60 % moisture could not be performed to completion as the auger blocked repeatedly. The other two moisture contents showed that moisture content enhanced heat exchange properties of the feedstock and this generally increased the amount of volatile organic matter released. It was observed that for 15 % moisture sawdust increase of temperature did not consistently exhibit an increase in degree of devolatilisation of organic matter. However, the 30 % moisture sawdust showed an increase in devolatilisation with increase in temperature. The effects of increasing reactor auger speed had the most consistent trend with which an increase in speed showed a decrease in degree of devolatilisation thus increasing char yield. The empirical data collected from lab scale and pilot plant experiments were used to create mass and energy balances. These were the basis of the large scale mobile pyrolysis plant which was designed to process 3. 45 tonnes per hour. Due to size restrictions the large scale dryer was not fitted in the container. It was then determined that the feedstock would either be dried using an onsite kiln or the reactor would process green sawdust. A preliminary economic feasibility assessment was performed for the base case scenario which processed pre-dried sawdust of 15 % moisture content at 400 °C and a retention time of 45 minutes. A sensitivity analysis based on predicted optimistic and pessimistic conditions showed that automation of the plant had the potential to increase the economic viability of the large scale process...|$|R
