Only {{a few studies have}} systematically measured the effects of sign language on the vocal responses of its users. This study employed a multiple baseline design to evaluate the effects of sign language on the vocal responses of a four-year-old boy with autism. Results indicate that a reinforcement contingency placed only on <b>sign</b> <b>responses</b> is inadequate for maintaining vocal responses. When a reinforcement contingency is placed on <b>sign</b> <b>responses</b> as well as vocal responses that the user is capable of emitting in verbal imitation, both <b>sign</b> and vocal <b>responses</b> are maintained. Results are discussed in terms of the need for a reinforcement contingency placed on vocal and <b>sign</b> <b>responses,</b> the effects of teaching procedures on response variability, and the need for future research to examine procedures utilized to teach sign language to persons within the developmental disabilities population...|$|R

First, the legislation makes schools responsible for how students with disabilities score—emphasizing [...] "...student outcomes instead of placement." [...] It also puts the public’s eye on how outside programs can be utilized to improve outcomes for this underserved population, and has thus prompted more research on the effectiveness of certain in- and out-of-school interventions.

This paper proposes a low complexity sybil attack detection scheme, that is, based on <b>signed</b> <b>response</b> (SRES) authentication mechanism developed for Global System for Mobile (GSM) communications. A probabilistic model is presented which analyzes the proposed authentication mechanism for its probability of sybil attack.

It is observed that the proposed sybil detection scheme exhibits lesser computational cost and power consumption as compared to the existing schemes for the same sybil detection performance...|$|E
40|$|In many of {{the single}} sign-on (SSO) {{specifications}} that support multitiered authentication, it is not mandatory to include the authentication context in a <b>signed</b> <b>response.</b> This can be exploited by the adversaries to launch {{a new kind of}} attack specific to SSO systems. In this paper, we propose the Weakest Link Attack, which is a kind of parallel session attack feasible in the above settings. Our attack enables adversaries to succeed at all levels of authentication associate to the victim user by breaking only at the weakest one. We present a detailed case study of our attack on web SSO as specified in Security Assertions Markup Language (SAML) V 2. 0, an OASIS standard released in March, 2005.

40|$|Despite the {{importance}} of both response probability and response time for testing models of choice there is a dearth of chronometric studies examining systematic asymmetries that occur over time- and space-orders in the method of paired comparisons. In this study, systematic asymmetries in discriminating the magnitude of paired visual stimuli are examined by way of log-odds ratios of binary responses {{as well as by}} <b>signed</b> <b>response</b> speed. Hierarchical Bayesian modeling is used to map response probabilities and response speed onto constituent psychological process, and processing capacity is also assessed using response time distribution hazard functions. The findings include characteristic order effects that change systematically in magnitude and direction with changes in the magnitude and separation of the stimuli. After Hellström (1979, 2000), Sensation Weighting (SW) model analyses show that such order effects are reflected in the weighted accumulation of noisy information about the difference between stimulus values over time, and interindividual differences in weightings asymmetries are related to the relative processing capacity of participants. An account of sensation weighting based on the use of reference level information and maximization of signal-to-noise ratios is posited, which finds support from theoretically driven analyses of behavioral data...|$|E

Comparison of the response patterns of signers and non-signers revealed a one-way implication between signer agreement clusters and non-signer agreement clusters.

40|$|Positron {{emission}} tomography {{was used to}} investigate whether signed languages exhibit the same neural organization for lexical retrieval within classical and non-classical language areas as has been described for spoken English. Ten deaf native American sign language (ASL) signers were shown pictures of unique entities (famous persons) and non-unique entities (animals) {{and were asked to}} name each stimulus with an overt <b>signed</b> <b>response.</b> Proper name signed responses to famous people were fingerspelled, and common noun responses to animals were both fingerspelled and signed with native ASL signs. In general, retrieving ASL signs activated neural sites similar to those activated by hearing subjects retrieving English words. Naming famous persons activated the left temporal pole (TP), whereas naming animals (whether fingerspelled or signed) activated left inferotemporal (IT) cortex. The retrieval of fingerspelled and native signs generally engaged the same cortical regions, but fingerspelled signs in addition activated a premotor region, perhaps due to the increased motor planning and sequencing demanded by fingerspelling. Native signs activated portions of the left supramarginal gyrus (SMG), an area previously implicated in the retrieval of phonological features of ASL signs. Overall, the findings indicate that similar neuroanatomical areas are involved in lexical retrieval for both signs and words...|$|E
40|$|Random-walk and {{diffusion}} {{models for}} two-choice comparison of paired successive or simultaneous stimuli focus on response time (RT), modeled {{as the time}} needed to reach one or the other barrier, and its relation to the response probabilities. Logit P 1 = ln[P 1 /(1 -P 1) ], where P 1 is the probability of responding ”first greater, ” {{can be seen as a}} measure of subjective stimulus difference, d. <b>Signed</b> <b>response</b> speed (SRS), ± 1 /RT with the sign of the response, yields another d measure. The two measures are highly correlated and, importantly, the intercept in the regression of logit P 1 on mean SRS estimates the asymmetry of the starting point relative to the barriers, that is, the bias. New analyses of data from Patching, Englund, and Hellström (2011) show that this bias helps explain the variability of the time-and space order errors. Possible connections of the bias with the parameters in Hellström’s (2003) sensation-weighting (SW) model are explored. What are the processes that lead to the response in a two-choice situation, such as forced-choice comparison of paired successive or simultaneous stimuli?

It is suggested that both motor imitation and matching skills be examined to teach manual signs to children with autism.

Four mentally retarded adults served as subjects.

The results showed that <b>signed</b> <b>responses</b> were acquired more readily than pointing responses as measured by the acquisition of tacts and intraverbals, and the formation of equivalence classes.
