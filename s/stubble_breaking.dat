40|$|Abstract-The <b>Stubble</b> <b>breaking</b> {{device is}} one of the most {{important}} components of the no-tillage planter. It directly influences the stubble breading effect, and even the performance of the complete machine. By the 3 D parametric modeling software Pro/Engineer, 3 D solid modeling of the <b>stubble</b> <b>breaking</b> device’s parts was carried out. And the parts were assembled into the assembly with pro/E. Then finite element analysis of the strain and stress on the key part (the ripple disc sickle) has been carried out. The result expresses that the intensity and stiffness of the ripple disc can satisfy the design specification, which provides a theory basis for the design and optimization of the <b>stubble</b> <b>breaking</b> device.

40|$|In {{addition}} to its, evident, food supply function, agriculture {{is subjected to}} various pressures and has to respond to many challenges like reducing its CO 2 emissions, maintaining or improving the soil quality, maintaining productivity, sequestrating of the carbon stock in soil [...] . Cultivation practices are known to induce a modification of soil organic matter quantity, quality and spatial distribution, which may impact dry matter decomposition kinetics. In order to bring answers to these questions, a multidisciplinary project (SOLRESIDUS) {{was set up by}} the University of Liege, Gembloux Agro-Bio Tech in collaboration with Walloon Agricultural Research Centre (CRA-W). The aim was to investigate the impact of cultivation practices (tillage and residue restitution) on crop growth, yield and environment, as well as on soil properties and on activities. In the present study, we focused on the impacts on soil CO 2 fluxes. The experimental site is situated in Gembloux, in the Belgian loamy region. The plot is divided into 4 latin squares where two tillage modalities (plough after 2 <b>stubble</b> <b>breaking</b> vs only 2 <b>stubble</b> <b>breaking)</b> and two straw management practices (restitution vs. exportation) were compared. For 3 years, soil respiration was measured with automatic and manual dynamic soil chambers. Moreover, soil respiration was measured as well in cropping zone (total respiration) as in root exclusion zones created with root exclusion cylinders (heterotrophic respiration). As first results, we observed: -a significantly higher flux in plots with residue restitution, which is clearly explained by the larger amount of organic carbon prone to decomposition; -a decrease of standardized heterotrophic respiration (linked with residue decomposition) during growing seasons; -no significant differences in soil respiration between tillage modalities after 3 growing seasons. The experiment is still in progress, more years being necessary in order to evaluate the long-term impacts of cultivation practices on soil respiration...|$|E
40|$|Perennial weed {{creeping}} thistle and couch-grass were controlled for tree year period in Prepychy village (Rychnov nad Kneznou district). <b>Stubble</b> <b>breaking</b> had cardinal effect on regeneration of hypogenous vegetative organs both wedd and endorsed their appearance. Following ploughing and ground reproduction before seeding didn´t control these weed. In chemical control section was tested an effectiveness of 22 herbicides. Creeping thistle showed the highest sensitivity against {{the majority of}} herbicides in growth phase F 4 (stalk height 20 cm). Results of experiments showed an importance of application a. i. glyphosate in perennial weed control system. In winter wheat vegetation showed herbicides Husar and Lontrel 300 the highest effect against {{creeping thistle}}. Broad-leaved crops give a possibility to use graminicides against couch-grass.

40|$|A {{total of}} 740 Mycosphaerella graminicola strains were {{isolated}} between 2000 and 2002 from winter wheat F 1 or F 2 leaves showing Septoria leaf blotch lesions (SLB) collected mainly at the soft dough stage in fungicide trials, analysing at 12 locations in Belgium the possibilities and {{risks associated with}} the use of epoxiconazole and azoxystrobin at various doses, mixtures and application dates. Fungicide sensitivity tests were performed in microtitre plates on potato dextrose broth amended with various concentrations of azoxystrobin. A wide range of sensitivity to azoxystrobin was observed, with EC 50 values ranging for 735 strains between 0. 002 to 0. 7 microg/ml, the highest frequency gradually shifting from EC 50 classes 0. 01 and 0. 02 microg/ml azoxystrobin in 2000 to EC 50 classes 0. 02 and 0. 04 microg/ml in 2002. No clear selection effect of particular fungicide use strategies was observed. Among the 382 strains isolated in 2002, five originating from 2 locations, showed azoxystrobin EC 50 values > 1 microg/ml. On medium amended with 100 microg/ml salicylhydroxamic acid (SHAM), 58 % of the 2002 strains were strongly inhibited, which affected adequate azoxystrobin ED 50 determination. This suggests widespread occurrence of M. graminicola strains relying in vitro on the alternative respiration pathway. In the presence of SHAM, strains 339 and 880 showed azoxystrobin EC 50 values of 3 and > 30 microg/ml, respectively. This high level of resistance to a QoI fungicide was confirmed by analysing mycelium growth inhibition on PDA. Cross-resistance to trifloxystrobin and kresoxim-methyl was demonstrated. Greenhouse assays on wheat plants revealed that control of QoI resistant strains by azoxystrobin is decreased, compared to control of sensitive ones. This highlights the risk of resistance to QoI fungicides also in M. graminicola populations, although up to now no decrease in field performance was noticed. It is recommended to delay build up of QoI resistance by an integrated approach, combining optimised fungicide use with the choice of SLB resistant cultivars and the application of farming practices promoting <b>stubbles</b> <b>break</b> down and so the reduction of the teleomorph stage...|$|R
40|$|Controlled traffic {{farming is}} a {{technology}} used to avoid soil compaction introduced by field machinery load and traffic. The benefits in improved soil conditions and yield increase were shown in Australia, the US and {{some parts of}} Europe. The use of permanent tramlines for every field operation was considered {{as a barrier to}} implementation in some parts of Europe. This was mainly due to fear from tillage quality in terms of crop residues distribution. The paper reports the results of the two-year assessment of the technology compared to traditional random traffic treatments in field scale experiments. The spring barley and oilseed rape crops were grown. Measurements were taken after the <b>stubble</b> <b>breaking</b> tillage operation with the Lemken disc harrows. Image analysis was used to calculate the distribution of crop residues. Results showed that the use of permanent tramlines has no negative influence on crop residues distribution...|$|E

Several {{kinds of}} main stalk and stubble processing technologies and corresponding machines used in Liaoning Province are researched in this paper. The key parameters influenced stubble chopping are analyzed {{on the basis}} of understanding the principles of “ 2 BISJ- 2110 precision planter”. In order to solve the shortcoming of disturbing much soil and more power loss of“ 2 BISJ- 2110 precision planter ” and achieve saving materials, reduce the cost and the water massive disappearing due to the agitation of the soil, entire stubble chopping is changed to seed line stubble chopping. Using the computer VB language to study the parameters of stalks and stubbles according to mathematical model about coulter ends and the path.
