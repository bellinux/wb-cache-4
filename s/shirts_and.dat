5|$|Liverpool's {{first season}} was successful, as the club {{narrowly}} won the Lancashire League title on goal average, over Blackpool. They {{also won the}} Liverpool District Cup by defeating Everton. The subsequent theft of the league and cup trophies cost the club £130 to replace them. Following their success, Liverpool reapplied to the Football League. This application was successful, {{mainly because of the}} resignations of Accrington and Bootle from the Second Division. Liverpool's original strip had been blue and white chequered <b>shirts</b> <b>and</b> white shorts, similar to those of their neighbours Everton. From 1894 they changed to red <b>shirts</b> <b>and</b> white shorts.|$|E

5|$|The club colours {{have not}} always been sky blue. The {{predecessor}} club BK Idrott wore blue and white striped <b>shirts</b> <b>and</b> white shorts, and this kit was still used {{for the first six months}} of 1910 after Malmö FF was founded. This was later changed to red and white striped <b>shirts</b> <b>and</b> black shorts to show that Malmö FF was a new, independent club. This colour combination has on occasion been used in modern times as the away kit. The present sky-blue kit was introduced in 1920. Since 2010 a small Scanian flag is featured on the back of the shirt just below the neck.|$|E

5|$|The club is {{associated}} with two very different colour schemes—white and black (first permanently adopted in 1920), and orange, navy and white (first used in 1973, and worn by the team as of the 2015–16 season). Luton mainly wore a combination of light blue and white before 1920, when white <b>shirts</b> <b>and</b> black shorts were first adopted. These colours were retained for over half a century, with the colour of the socks varying between white and black, until Luton changed to orange, navy and white {{at the start of}} the 1973–74 season. Luton began playing in white shirts, shorts and socks in 1979, with the orange and navy motif reduced to trim; navy shorts were adopted in 1984. This palette was retained until the 1999–2000 season, when the team played in orange <b>shirts</b> <b>and</b> blue shorts. From 2000 to 2008, Luton returned to white <b>shirts</b> <b>and</b> black shorts; orange was included as trim until 2007. The white, navy and orange palette favoured in the 1980s was brought back in 2008, following the results of a club poll, but a year later the colours were changed yet again, this time to a predominantly orange strip with white shorts. Navy shorts were readopted in 2011. Luton are wearing orange shirts, navy shorts and white socks during the 2015–16 season.|$|E

5|$|United's away colours {{have changed}} {{a number of}} times over the years. They played in white <b>shirts</b> <b>and</b> black shorts from 1914 until 1961, and then white shorts until 1966. They then played in yellow <b>shirts</b> <b>and</b> blue shorts for the 1967–68 season, but from 1969 to 1974 played in all red with an all blue third kit. In 1974, they {{returned}} to a yellow shirt, which they played with various coloured shorts until 1983. They played in all grey from 1983 to 1988, before once again returning to the yellow kit until 1993.

He wore her leather pants and jackets, collarless jackets, {{oversized}} <b>shirts,</b> <b>and</b> long scarves.

5|$|Kit changes {{had been}} {{introduced}} in the late 1930s. The 1937 season saw Palace field a shirt of claret and blue stripes, before adopting white <b>shirts</b> <b>and</b> black shorts for the following eleven seasons. The club reverted to claret and blue in 1948, but any attempt at changing the kit to change their luck backfired as the club had their worst season to date, finishing bottom and celebrating twenty-five years in League Football by applying for re-election for the first time. Palace kept their place, changed the kit back to white <b>shirts</b> <b>and</b> black shorts, and finished seventh the following season. They followed this up with another bottom place and re-election in 1951, with the unwanted record of scoring the lowest number of goals in a Division Three South season. Palace would remain in {{the bottom half of}} the table until the League was restructured in 1958, requiring re-election a third and final time in 1956, with only Swindon keeping them from bottom spot that season.|$|E
5|$|Most of Olympic's home matches {{took place}} at the Hole-i'-th-Wall stadium, named after an {{adjacent}} public house. From 1880 onwards, the club's first-choice colours consisted of light blue <b>shirts</b> <b>and</b> white shorts. One Olympic player, James Ward, was selected for the England team and six other former or future England internationals played for the club, including Jack Hunter, who was the club's coach at the time of Olympic's FA Cup win.|$|E
