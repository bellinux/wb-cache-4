40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this article is}} to outline what a hotel <b>management</b> <b>contract</b> is, the main challenges arising, and why it is a particularly rich research context. The separation between ownership and management through a hotel <b>management</b> <b>contract</b> has become relatively widespread [1] and is seen as one of the driving mechanisms for the rapid internationalization of the hotel industry [2]. A hotel <b>management</b> <b>contract</b> enables a hotel owner to retain legal ownership of the hotel site, building, plant and equipment, furnishings and inventories, while the operator is responsible for the day to day business of the hotel [3]. The owner assumes full economic risk associated with ownership of the commercial asset, whereas, the operator is only responsible for the operation of the hotel [4]. Much of the reason for the popularity of <b>management</b> <b>contracts</b> is that the expertise required to operate a large hotel is more readily available under such an arrangement [5]. It enables a hotel owne...|$|R

[...] University of Wisconsin-Green Bay, 2014. Resource <b>management</b> <b>contracts</b> define scopes and service levels, identify compensation methods, and establish cost and performance benchmarks for the avoidance, collection, re-use, recycling, and/or disposal of municipal solid waste (including garbage/trash and recyclable materials). As universities seek ways to become more sustainable, some have identified resource <b>management</b> <b>contracts</b> as an area with high potential for improved environmental performance and cost savings. This thesis documents a case study at the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay, which explored "greener" options for resource management on campus through the contracting process. During this project, the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay evaluated the current refuse and recycling removal and trash compacting services contract based on environmental and economic considerations, studied other institutions' waste management and resource <b>management</b> <b>contracts</b> and practices, issued a request for information to potential contractors, issued bid and contract documents intended to reduce environmental impacts while maintaining economic efficiency, and contracted for waste and recyclable material management services. This project faced many challenges, which are important learning opportunities for the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay, {{as well as for}} other universities and institutions. As other higher education institutions look for new approaches to resource <b>management</b> <b>contracting,</b> this case study will serve as a reference for analyzing resource <b>management</b> <b>contracts,</b> developing and using requests for information, drafting "greener" request for bids or request for proposals documents, and awarding and administering resource <b>management</b> <b>contracts...</b>|$|R
