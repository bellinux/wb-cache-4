5|$|The dromedary's diet {{consists}} {{mostly of}} foliage, dry grasses and desert vegetation mostly thorny plants. A <b>study</b> <b>said</b> the typical diet of the dromedary is dwarf shrubs (47.5%), trees (29.9%), grasses (11.2%), other herbs (0.2%) and vines (11%). The dromedary {{is primarily a}} browser; forbs and shrubs comprise 70% of its diet in summer and 90% of its diet in winter. The dromedary may also graze on tall, young, succulent grasses.|$|E
5|$|March 2009 {{recommendations}} from the USPSTF {{on the use}} of aspirin for the primary prevention of coronary heart disease encourage men aged 45–79 and women aged 55–79 to use aspirin when the potential benefit of a reduction in MI for men or stroke for women outweighs the potential harm of an increase in gastrointestinal hemorrhage. The WHI <b>study</b> <b>said</b> regular low dose (75 or 81mg) aspirin female users had a 25% lower risk of death from cardiovascular disease and a 14% lower risk of death from any cause. Low-dose aspirin use was also associated with a trend toward lower risk of cardiovascular events, and lower aspirin doses (75 or 81mg/day) may optimize efficacy and safety for people requiring aspirin for long-term prevention.|$|E

A 2005 <b>study</b> <b>said</b> {{estimates of the}} duration of infection-acquired immunity range from 7 to 20 years and the different results could {{be the result of}} differences in levels of circulating B. pertussis, surveillance systems, and case definitions used. The <b>study</b> <b>said</b> protective immunity after vaccination wanes after 4–12 years. Vaccination exemption laws appear to increase cases.|$|E

In fact, many children in the 2004 <b>study</b> <b>said</b> {{that one of the}} reasons they ran away from home is because they did not want to be forced to work and unable to attend school. Obviously, however, the demands of living alone make it very unlikely that they will be able to obtain education through leaving.|$|E
25|$|Tasers were {{introduced}} as non-lethal weapons for police {{to use to}} subdue fleeing, belligerent, or potentially dangerous people, who would have otherwise been subjected to more lethal weapons such as firearms. A 2009 Police Executive Research Forum <b>study</b> <b>said</b> that officer injuries drop by 76% when a Taser is used. Taser International has stated that police surveys show that the device has saved 75,000 lives through 2011, there have been instances where Tasers have contributed to serious injury or death.|$|E
25|$|In {{a survey}} by the local and central governments {{conducted}} on 1,080 children aged 0 to 15 in Iwaki, Kawamata and Iitate on 26–30 March, almost 45 percent of these children had experienced thyroid exposure to radiation with radioactive iodine, although in all cases the amounts of radiation did not warrant further examination, according to the Nuclear Safety Commission on Tuesday 5 July. In October 2011, hormonal irregularies in 10 evacuated children were reported. However, the organization responsible for the <b>study</b> <b>said</b> that no link had been established between the children's condition and exposure to radiation.|$|E

25|$|A study {{conducted}} by the HUGO Pan-Asian SNP Consortium in 2009 used principal components analysis, which makes no prior population assumptions, on genetic data sampled from a large number of points across Asia. They said that East Asian and South-East Asian populations clustered together, and suggested a common origin for these populations. At the same time they observed a broad discontinuity between this cluster and South Asia, commenting most of the Indian populations showed evidence of shared ancestry with European populations. The <b>study</b> <b>said</b> that genetic ancestry is strongly correlated with linguistic affiliations as well as geography.|$|E

[...] A 2007 disarmament and repatriation <b>study</b> <b>said</b> [...] "army units that have not yet gone through the process of brassage are usually much smaller than what they ought to be. Some non-integrated brigades have only 500 men (and are thus nothing more than a small battalion) whereas some battalions may not even have the size of a normal company (over a 100 men)." ...|$|E
500|$|Studies in 2004 and 2006 {{attempted}} {{to test the}} urban heat island theory, by comparing temperature readings taken on calm nights with those taken on windy nights. [...] If the urban heat island theory is correct then instruments should have recorded a bigger temperature rise for calm nights than for windy ones, because wind blows excess heat away from cities {{and away from the}} measuring instruments. There was no difference between the calm and windy nights, and one <b>study</b> <b>said</b> that [...] "we show that, globally, temperatures over land have risen as much on windy nights as on calm nights, indicating that the observed overall warming is not a consequence of urban development." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "In a {{telephone}} interview, Jon Pedersen, research {{director for the}} 2004 [...] <b>study,</b> <b>said</b> several factors probably account for researchers' different findings.

Pedersen noted that the Lancet study {{is based on a}} pre-invasion mortality rate of 5.5 deaths per thousand people [...] The U.N., he said, used the figure of 9 deaths per thousand. Extrapolating from the lower pre-invasion mortality rate would yield a greater increase in post-invasion deaths, he noted." ...|$|E
