5|$|As a {{character}} in the games, Mewtwo's physical appearance is not its only stark divergence from Mew. While the alterations to the genetic source material it was cloned resulted in its abilities surpassing Mew's, it also resulted in Mewtwo developing a vicious personality that is primarily interested in proving its own strength. The franchise's non-video game media, particularly the anime, has expanded upon the character.

Additionally, adds Abhaya Sutta, the Tathagata, only <b>speaks</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> sense of proper time even when what he speaks is the factual, the true, the agreeable, the endearing and what is beneficial to his goals.|$|E
25|$|Episodes {{focusing}} on Howard and Harold were pulled from Nickelodeon's African channel. Other episodes {{in which the}} characters are featured or mentioned briefly are edited so that the McBride parents are not included. This decision was criticized by fans from South Africa, where gay marriage has been legal since 2006. Viacom stated that, since the feed reaches other African markets where homosexuality is banned, they would risk losing their broadcasting license by showing Howard and Harold. Their introductory episode was made available on the South African DStv's video on demand service following the controversy. The Arabic dub of the series never aired episodes with the McBride parents, but, however, modifies dialogue so that Howard <b>speaks</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> female voice and {{is referred to as}} Clyde's mother. The McBrides are the second pair of children's characters whose same-sex relationship has been censored for foreign markets; the first was Ruby and Sapphire of Steven Universe.|$|E
