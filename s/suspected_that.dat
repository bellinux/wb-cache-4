5|$|Initially, it {{has been}} <b>suspected</b> <b>that</b> {{immunoglobulins}} in general and autoantibodies in particular do not enter the nucleus. Now there is a body of evidence that under pathological conditions (e.g. lupus erythematosus) IgG can enter the nucleus.|$|E
5|$|Isaac Newton {{described}} comets as {{compact and}} durable solid bodies moving in oblique orbit and their tails as thin streams of vapor emitted by their nuclei, ignited or heated by the Sun.

30|$|It is {{well know}} that bone pain {{could be due}} to bone {{metastasis}} of various kinds of malignant diseases. Especially, lung cancer, breast cancer and melanoma often bring out bone metastasis. However, she had no symptoms and no findings in CT and PET-CT with which we should <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> she had lung cancer. In addition, she had no symptom in breast and there was no specific observation with which we should <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> she had breast cancer. There was no specific findings in peripheral blood test with which we should <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> she had some hematological disease, although we did not perform bone puncture. Furthermore, there was no specific findings in her skin in the whole body with which we should <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> she had some disease such as melanoma.|$|R

5|$|It is <b>suspected</b> <b>that</b> comet impacts have, {{over long}} timescales, also {{delivered}} significant quantities {{of water to}} the Earth's Moon, {{some of which may}} have survived as lunar ice. Comet and meteoroid impacts are also thought to be responsible for the existence of tektites and australites.|$|E

5|$|As the Khmer Rouge had no {{air force}} and only limited {{anti-aircraft}} capability, no fleet air cover was necessary, but the evacuation was supported by USAF aircraft based in Thailand. It was <b>suspected</b> <b>that</b> the Khmer Rouge might possess SA-7 shoulder-launched surface to air missiles and so the evacuation helicopters were painted with infra-red low-reflective paint and equipped with ALE-29 flare dispensers.|$|E
5|$|Before the flyby of Voyager 2, astronomers <b>suspected</b> <b>that</b> Triton {{might have}} liquid {{nitrogen}} seas and a nitrogen/methane atmosphere with a density {{as much as}} 30% that of Earth. Like the famous overestimates of the atmospheric density of Mars, this proved incorrect. As with Mars, a denser atmosphere is postulated for its early history.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{numerous}} studies demonstrating {{the central role}} of ammonia, ammonia levels do not always correlate with the severity of the encephalopathy; it is <b>suspected</b> <b>that</b> this means that more ammonia has already been absorbed into the brain in those with severe symptoms whose serum levels are relatively low. Other waste products implicated in hepatic encephalopathy include mercaptans (substances containing a thiol group), short-chain fatty acids, and phenol.|$|E
5|$|Finds from sites outside England, {{especially}} in France, {{have in the}} nineteenth and twentieth century been referred to M. bucklandii. In 2010 Benson considered these as either clearly different or too fragmentary to establish an identity.

5|$|In 1687, Sir Isaac Newton {{published}} his Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica, {{in which he}} outlined his laws of gravity and motion. His work on comets was decidedly incomplete. Although he had <b>suspected</b> <b>that</b> two comets that had appeared in succession in 1680 and 1681 were the same comet before and after passing behind the Sun (he was later found to be correct; see Newton's Comet), {{he was unable to}} completely reconcile comets into his model.|$|E

5|$|In April 2016, Kirchner's {{secretary}} and confidant Daniel Muñoz (who died early that year) was {{identified in the}} Panama Papers as owner of real-estate investment firm Gold Black Limited. Company director Sergio Todisco was investigated by prosecutors who <b>suspected</b> <b>that</b> the company was used for money laundering.

5|$|In mid-2001, Universal Music Group {{was criticized}} for airing {{commercials}} promoting the album during episodes of Total Request Live.

This legislation proposed to ban the entertainment-industry from marketing suspected violent or explicit material to minors.|$|E
5|$|In the fallout, Bo {{was removed}} {{as the party}} chief of Chongqing and lost his seat on the Politburo. Bo's {{dismissal}} exposed disunity within Communist Party ranks shortly before a major leadership transition, and some observers <b>suspected</b> <b>that</b> {{it was because he}} threatened Xi Jinping's future grip on power. He was later stripped of all his positions, lost his seat at the National People's Congress, and was eventually expelled from the party.|$|E

5|$|Kirchner {{did not run}} for a {{reelection in}} the 2007 presidential elections. His wife, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, ran instead. Media {{observers}} <b>suspected</b> <b>that</b> Kirchner stepped down as president to circumvent the term limit, swapping roles with his wife. Cristina Kirchner was elected, and Néstor Kirchner became First Gentleman. He remained highly influential during his wife's term, supervising the economy and leading the PJ. Their marriage has been {{compared with those of}} Juan and Eva Perón and Bill and Hillary Clinton.|$|E
