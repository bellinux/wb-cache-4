Knight hired two Suffolk Punch horses and a plough from a farmer and painted them outdoors in a cherry orchard on Averills' farm in Worcestershire.

40|$|In {{a series}} of major {{expansions}} starting in 1987, {{the earned income tax}} credit (EITC) has become a central part of the federal government's anti-poverty strategy. In this paper, we examine the impact of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (TRA 86), which included an expansion of the EITC, on labor force participation and hours of work. The expansion of the credit affected an easily identifiable group, <b>single</b> <b>women</b> with children, but is predicted to have had no effect on another group, <b>single</b> <b>women</b> without children. Other features of TRA 86, such as the increase in the value of dependent exemptions and the large increase in the standard deduction for head of household filers, are predicted by economic theory to have reinforced the impact of the EITC on the relative labor supply outcomes of <b>single</b> <b>women</b> with and without children. We therefore compare the change in labor supply of <b>single</b> <b>women</b> with children to the change in labor supply of <b>single</b> <b>women</b> without children. We find that between 1984 - 1986 and 1988 - 1989 <b>single</b> <b>women</b> with children increased their labor force participation by 1. 4 percentage points (from a base of 73. 1 percent) relative to <b>single</b> <b>women</b> without children. We explore a number of possible explanations for this finding and conclude that the 1987 expansion of the EITC and the other provisions of TRA 86 are the most likely explanations. We find no effect of the EITC expansion on the hours of work of <b>single</b> <b>women</b> with children who were already in the labor force. Compared to other elements of the welfare system, the EITC appears to produce little distortion of work incentives. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{examined}} {{the association between}} parenting young children and smoking among US <b>single</b> <b>women</b> compared with married women, and whether this effect is moderated by socioeconomic status and race/ethnicity. Our main finding is that having children reduces smoking except among <b>single</b> white <b>women,</b> and women with low income. We used the Tobacco Use Supplement of the Current Population Survey, a nationally representative dataset (1995 - 96, n= 70, 019). Log-binomial regression {{analysis was used to}} estimate the association between parenting responsibility (i. e., presence of children aged 0 - 4 and 5 - 17) and daily smoking status, after taking into consideration marital status, income, and race/ethnicity. <b>Single</b> <b>women</b> faced a higher risk of smoking than married women. Parenting was protective against smoking among married women but not among <b>single</b> <b>women.</b> Additionally, among <b>single</b> <b>women,</b> the associations between parenting and smoking varied by income and race/ethnicity. Parenting increased the risk of smoking among <b>single</b> <b>women</b> in the lowest income quartile. Single black and Hispanic women with children had a risk of smoking similar to that of their childless counterparts. However, <b>single</b> white <b>women</b> with children were more likely to smoke than their childless counterparts. Smoking cessation interventions and programs to reduce environmental tobacco smoke should recognize that the co-occurrence of single motherhood, parenting responsibility and low-income may increase the risk of smoking. This is particularly significant given the rapid growth of the <b>single</b> <b>women</b> population, and their concentration in poverty in the USA. The finding that parenting is protective against smoking among <b>single</b> minority <b>women,</b> who presumably experience significant stressors, calls for a more thorough investigation of smoking behavior among minority women, and suggests the importance of stress buffers such as social support.
