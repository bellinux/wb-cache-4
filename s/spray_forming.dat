5000|$|Professor Singer at the Swansea University first {{developed}} {{the idea of}} gas atomised <b>spray</b> <b>forming</b> in the 1970s in which a high pressure gas jet impinges on a stable melt stream to cause atomisation. The resulting droplets are then collected on a target, which can be manipulated within the spray and used to form a near-dense billet of near-net shape. <b>Spray</b> <b>forming</b> has found applications in specialist industries such as: stainless steel cladding of incinerator tubes; nickel superalloy discs and rings for aerospace-engines; aluminium-titanium, aluminium-neodymium and aluminium-silver sputter targets; aluminium-silicon alloys for cylinder liners; and high speed steels.

50|$|In {{spite of}} the {{problems}} associated with the <b>spray</b> <b>forming</b> process there has been sustained industrial interest in <b>spray</b> <b>forming</b> over the last 35 years. Sandvik-Osprey (former Osprey Metals Ltd) of Neath, South Wales holds the patents on the process and have licensed the technology to a range of industries. There are currently approximately 25 licensees operating around the world, ranging from small research and development plants to full-scale commercial operations. Main applications are prematerial for low temperature Nb3Sn super conductors (CuSn), oil drilling equipment (high strength material CuMnNi) and for forming tools (CuAlFe with high Al-content). In all of these applications, research concerns the reconciliation of the cost disadvantages and complexity of <b>spray</b> <b>forming</b> with the demand for high performance alloys in niche applications.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the major}} attractions of <b>spray</b> <b>forming</b> is the {{potential}} economic benefit {{to be gained from}} reducing the number of process steps between melt and finished product. <b>Spray</b> <b>forming</b> can be used to produce strip, tube, ring, clad bar / roll and cylindrical extrusion feed stock products, in each case with a relatively fine-scale microstructure even in large cross-sections. The benefits of GASF over powder metallurgy accrue from the reduced number of process steps where powder sieving, pressing, de-gassing and handling steps and their attendant safety and contamination issues may be removed.|$|E

50|$|Atomising gas used in <b>spray</b> <b>forming</b> is {{generally}} either N2 {{and can be}} either protective or reactive depending on the alloy system, or Ar which {{is generally}} entirely inert but more expensive than N2. Reactive gasses can be introduced in small quantities to the atomising gas to create dispersion strengthened alloys e.g. 0.5-10% O2 in N2 used to generate oxide dispersion strengthened (ODS) Al alloys. Comparisons of N2 and Ar based <b>spray</b> <b>forming</b> showed that with all other factors remaining constant, the billet top temperature was lower with N2 than with Ar, because {{of the differences in}} thermal diffusivity of the two atomising gases: Ar has a thermal conductivity of 0.0179 W/mK which is approximately a third less than N2 with a thermal conductivity of 0.026 W/mK.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Spray</b> <b>forming,</b> {{also known}} as spray casting, spray {{deposition}} and in-situ compaction, is a method of casting near net shape metal components with [...] microstructures via the deposition of semi-solid sprayed droplets onto a shaped substrate. In <b>spray</b> <b>forming</b> an alloy is melted, normally in an induction furnace, then the molten metal is slowly poured through a conical tundish into a small-bore ceramic nozzle. The molten metal exits the furnace as a thin free-falling stream and is broken up into droplets by an annular array of gas jets, and these droplets then proceed downwards, accelerated by the gas jets to impact onto a substrate. The process is arranged such that the droplets strike the substrate whilst in the semi-solid condition, this provides sufficient liquid fraction to 'stick' the solid fraction together. Deposition continues, gradually building up a spray formed billet of metal on the substrate.|$|E
5000|$|The {{earliest}} <b>spray</b> <b>forming</b> {{work was}} based on a resistively heated electric holding furnace. The melt then passed through a 3 mm diameter Al2O3 nozzle. However the low flow rate made a high superheat necessary to prevent solidification in the nozzle. The next generation melting procedures in <b>spray</b> <b>forming</b> applications were bottom pour induction units, which offer many benefits. In this system, the melting crucible is directly above the atomiser head with a ceramic nozzle feeding directly from the furnace to the atomiser. A stopper rod runs through the melt {{to the top of the}} pouring nozzle, the rod is withdrawn when the melt reaches the designated temperature for spraying, typically 50 to 150 C above the alloy's liquidus. Alternatively a pre-prepared plug of alloy to block the nozzle is used, and at a specified superheat this plug melts allowing the contents of the furnace to drain through the nozzle. Another problem associated with bottom pour furnaces is the change in flow rate associated with the reducing metalo-static head in the crucible. In some cases, introducing an inert gas overpressure during pouring can compensate for this effect.|$|E

The antihistamine cyproheptadine is also effective, probably due to its antiserotonergic effects.|$|R
5000|$|There are {{two major}} {{disadvantages}} to the gas atomisation <b>spray</b> <b>forming</b> process. The most significant disadvantage is the relatively low process yield with typical losses of ~30%. Losses occur because of overspray (droplets missing the emerging billet), splashing of material from the billet surface, and material ‘bouncing’ off the semi-solid top surface. Many operators of the <b>spray</b> <b>forming</b> process now use a particle injector system to re-inject the overspray powder, and thus recycle material {{that would otherwise be}} lost, or sell the overspray powder as a product in its own right. The second major disadvantage is one of process control. As it is essentially a free-forming process with many interdependent variables, it has proved difficult to predict the shape, porosity or deposition rate for a given alloy. Much of the control is based on operator experience and empirical relationships. It is partly the process complexity and lack of robust process control that has prevented the widespread commercialisation of this process. Some developments using feed-back control have proved successful in improving the variations in billet diameter and improving yield in specific systems but these have yet to find widespread implementation.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{one of the}} {{benefits}} of <b>spray</b> <b>forming</b> is purportedly the ability to produce bulk material with fine scale microsegregation and little or no macrosegregation work on Al-Mg-Li-Cu alloys showed that as a consequence of the interconnected liquid in the billet there was significant macrosegregation in large spray formed wrought Al billets. The distribution of Cu, Mg and Li in, for example, Al alloy 8091 showed surprisingly pronounced macrosegregation with the variation of Cu(wt%) in a spray formed 8091 billet, ranging from approximately 1.4 at the billet centre to 1.92 at the billet periphery. These macrosegregation patterns were explained in terms of inverse segregation in which solute rich liquid from the billet centre is sucked back through the primary Al-rich network to feed solidification shrinkage at the billet periphery. This effect was suggested to be exacerbated by centrifugal effects from the billet rotation.|$|E
50|$|Porosity {{resulting}} from gas entrapment and solidification shrinkage {{is a significant}} problem in spray formed materials. A typical spray formed billet will contain 1-2% porosity with a pore size dependent on alloy freezing range and various process parameters. Hot isostatic pressing (HIPing) or thermo-mechanical processing can heal these pores if they are small (less than 30 µm). Despite these disadvantages, <b>spray</b> <b>forming</b> remains an economic process {{for the production of}} difficult to manufacture, niche alloys. Large-scale porosity is more difficult to heal effectively and must be minimised by careful process control. In some cases, porosity is controlled by alloy additions which react with dissolved and entrapped gas to form a solid phase e.g. titanium added to copper billets to form titanium nitride with dissolved and entrapped nitrogen gas. Porosity, even after consolidation, can limit the applications of spray formed material, for example rotating gas turbine components must have zero porosity because of the detrimental effect on high-cycle fatigue (HCF).|$|E

5000|$|<b>Spray</b> <b>forming</b> offers certain {{advantages}} over both conventional ingot metallurgy and more specialized {{techniques such as}} powder metallurgy. Firstly, it is a flexible process {{and can be used}} to manufacture a wide range of materials, some of which are difficult to produce by other methods, e.g. Al-5wt% Li alloys or Al-SiC, Al-Al2O3 metal matrix composites (MMCs). The atomisation of the melt stream into droplets of 10-500 µm diameter, some of which, depending on diameter, cool quickly to the solid and semi-solid state provide a large number of nucleants for the residual liquid fraction of the spray formed material on the billet top surface. The combination of rapid cooling in the spray and the generation of a large population of solid nucleants in the impacting spray leads to a fine equiaxed microstructure, typically in the range 10-100 µm, with low levels and short length scales of internal solute partitioning. These microstructural aspects offer advantages in material strength because of fine grain size, refined distribution of dispersoid and/or secondary precipitate phases, as well as tolerance to impurity ‘tramp’ elements. This fine structure in the ‘as sprayed’ condition means homogenising heat treatments can often be avoided. Because of the complex solidification path (i.e. the rapid transition from superheated melt to solid, liquid or semi-solid droplet to temperature equilibration at semi-solid billet top and final slow cooling to fully solid) of the spray formed material, extended solubility of alloying elements and the formation of metastable and quasi-crystalline phases has also been reported.|$|E
50|$|During {{spraying}} it {{is essential}} to maintain a constant top surface temperature and hence maintain steady-state conditions if a billet with consistent microstructure is to be produced. At the billet surface, during spraying an enthalpy balance must be maintained where the rate of enthalpy lost (Hout) from the billet by conduction to the atomising gas and through the substrate, convection and radiation must be balanced with the rate of enthalpy input (Hin) from the droplets in the spray. There are a variety of factors that can be adjusted in order to maintain these conditions: spray height, atomiser gas pressure, melt flow rate, melt superheat and atomiser configuration, being those parameters most readily adjusted. Typically equipment such as closed circuit cameras and optical pyrometry can be used to monitor billet size/position and top surface temperature. If Hout is much greater Hin then a steady temperature is maintained at the billet top surface. The top surface should be in a mushy condition in order to promote sticking of incoming droplets and partial re-melting of solid particles. The necessary partial re-melting of solid droplets explains the absence of dendritic remnants from pre-solidified droplets in the final microstructure. If Hin is insufficient to cause significant re-melting, a ‘splat’ microstructure of layered droplets will form, typical of thermal spray processes such as vacuum plasma spraying (VPS), arc spraying and high velocity oxy-fuel. Processing maps have been produced for plasma spraying and <b>spray</b> <b>forming</b> using a steady-state heat balance in terms of the interlayer time (time between deposition events) against average deposition rate per unit area. These maps show the boundaries between banded un-fused microstructure and an equiaxed homogeneous structure.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the effect of heat treatment on the structure and morphology of <b>spray</b> <b>formed</b> structurally amorphous steel, several small samples were cut from one <b>spray</b> <b>formed</b> amorphous steel ingot (DAR – 35). The samples were heat treated at 700 o C in a tube furnace under a constant flow of 99. 9 % argon for up to 120 hours. The samples were furnace cooled to 300 o C. Later they were quenched in water. The structure was investigated using x-ray diffraction and the morphology of the polished and lightly etched samples was examined under both optical and scanning electron microscopes. The {{results indicate that the}} <b>spray</b> <b>formed</b> steels were amorphous. However, their microstructure is not homogeneous. The microstructure is composed of three distinctively different phase contrasts (viz. light gray, dark gray and bright white contrasts). The bright white phase contained maximum amount of tungsten and molybdenum, it had the least amount of iron. Both light and dark gray phases contained nearly the compositionally expected amount of iron, and more chromium than compositionally expected. The effect of heat treatment at 700 o C had no effect on the three different phase contrasts. However, the heat treatment at 700 o C showed some effect on the crystallization of the structure. The heat treatment for up to 24 hours has very little effect on the structure and morphology of the amorphous steel samples. However, if the samples were heat treated at 700 o C for more than 24 and below 72 hours, it appears that a partial crystallization of the steel occurs. Significant crystallization of the <b>spray</b> <b>formed</b> amorphous steel occurs due to prolonged heat treatment above 72 hours...|$|R
