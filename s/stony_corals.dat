5|$|<b>Stony</b> <b>corals</b> first {{appeared}} in the Middle Triassic, but their relationship to the tabulate and rugose corals of the Paleozoic is currently unresolved. In modern times <b>stony</b> <b>corals</b> numbers are expected to decline due to the effects of global warming and ocean acidification.|$|E
5|$|Most <b>stony</b> <b>corals</b> {{extend their}} tentacles {{to feed on}} zooplankton, but those with larger polyps take {{correspondingly}} larger prey, including various invertebrates and even small fish. In addition to capturing prey in this way, many <b>stony</b> <b>corals</b> also produce mucus films they can move over their bodies using cilia; these trap small organic particles which are then pulled towards and into the mouth. In a few <b>stony</b> <b>corals,</b> this is the primary method of feeding, and the tentacles are reduced or absent, an example being Acropora acuminata. Caribbean <b>stony</b> <b>corals</b> are generally nocturnal, with the polyps retracting into their skeletons during the day, thus maximising the exposure of the zooxanthallae to the light, but in the Indo-Pacific region, many species feed by day and night.|$|E
5|$|Corals {{predominantly}} reproduce sexually. About 25% of hermatypic corals (<b>stony</b> <b>corals)</b> form single sex (gonochoristic) colonies, {{while the}} rest are hermaphroditic.|$|E

5|$|Hexacorallia {{includes}} {{coral reef}} builders: the <b>stony</b> <b>corals</b> (Scleractinia), sea anemones (Actiniaria), and zoanthids (Zoantharia). Genetic studies of ribosomal DNA has shown Ceriantharia to be a monophyletic {{group and the}} oldest, or basal, order among them.|$|E
5|$|The polyps of <b>stony</b> <b>corals</b> have {{six-fold}} symmetry {{while those}} of soft corals have eight. The mouth of each polyp {{is surrounded by}} a ring of tentacles. In <b>stony</b> <b>corals</b> these are cylindrical and taper to a point, but in soft corals they are pinnate with side branches known as pinnules. In some tropical species these are reduced to mere stubs and in some they are fused to give a paddle-like appearance. In most corals, the tentacles are retracted by day and spread out at night to catch plankton and other small organisms. Shallow water species of both stony and soft corals can be zooxanthellate, the corals supplementing their plankton diet with the products of photosynthesis produced by these symbionts. The polyps interconnect by a complex and well-developed system of gastrovascular canals, allowing significant sharing of nutrients and symbionts.|$|E
5|$|In some colonial polyps, a chitinous {{periderm}} gives {{support and}} some protection to the connecting sections {{and to the}} lower parts of individual polyps. <b>Stony</b> <b>corals</b> secrete massive calcium carbonate exoskeletons. A few polyps collect materials such as sand grains and shell fragments, which they attach to their outsides. Some colonial sea anemones stiffen the mesoglea with sediment particles.|$|E

5|$|Anthozoa is {{included}} within the phylum Cnidaria, {{which also includes}} the jellyfish, box jellies and parasitic Myxozoa and Polypodiozoa. The two main subclasses of Anthozoa are the Hexacorallia, members of which have six-fold symmetry and includes the <b>stony</b> <b>corals,</b> sea anemones, tube anemones and zoanthids; and the Octocorallia, which have eight-fold symmetry and includes the soft corals and gorgonians (sea pens, sea fans and sea whips), and sea pansies. The smaller subclass, Ceriantharia, consists of the tube-dwelling anemones.|$|E
5|$|Corals are {{classified}} in the class Anthozoa of the phylum Cnidaria. They are divided into three subclasses, Hexacorallia, Octocorallia, and Ceriantharia. The Hexacorallia include the <b>stony</b> <b>corals,</b> the sea anemones and the zoanthids. These groups have polyps that generally have 6-fold symmetry. The Octocorallia include blue coral, soft corals, sea pens, and gorgonians (sea fans and sea whips). These groups have polyps with 8-fold symmetry, each polyp having eight tentacles and eight mesenteries. Ceriantharia are the tube-dwelling anemones.|$|E
5|$|Most {{anthozoans}} are unisexual {{but some}} <b>stony</b> <b>corals</b> are hermaphrodite. The germ cells {{originate in the}} endoderm {{and move to the}} gastrodermis where they differentiate. When mature, they are liberated into the coelenteron and thence to the open sea, with fertilisation being external. To make fertilisation more likely, corals emit vast numbers of gametes, and many species synchronise their release in relation to the time of day and the phase of the moon.|$|E

5|$|The Australian {{zoologist}} John Veron and {{his co-workers}} analyzed ribosomal RNA in 1996 to obtain similar results to Romano and Palumbi, again concluding that the traditional families were plausible but that the suborders were incorrect. They also established that <b>stony</b> <b>corals</b> are monophyletic, including all the descendants of a common ancestor, but that they are divided into two groups, the robust and complex clades. Veron suggested that both morphological and molecular systems be used in future classification schemes.|$|E
5|$|The {{phylogeny}} of Anthozoans is {{not clearly}} understood {{and a number}} of different models have been proposed. Within the Hexacorallia, the sea anemones, coral anemones and <b>stony</b> <b>corals</b> may constitute a monophyletic grouping united by their six-fold symmetry and cnidocyte trait. The Octocorallia appears to be monophyletic, and primitive members of this group may have been stolonate. The cladogram presented here comes from a 2014 study by Stampar et al. which was based on the divergence of mitochondrial DNA within the group and on nuclear markers.|$|E
5|$|Anthozoa is a {{class of}} marine {{invertebrates}} which includes the sea anemones, <b>stony</b> <b>corals,</b> soft corals and gorgonians. Adult anthozoans are almost all attached to the seabed, while their larvae can disperse {{as part of the}} plankton. The basic unit of the adult is the polyp; this consists of a cylindrical column topped by a disc with a central mouth surrounded by tentacles. Sea anemones are mostly solitary, but the majority of corals are colonial, being formed by the budding of new polyps from an original, founding individual. Colonies are strengthened by calcium carbonate and other materials and take various massive, plate-like, bushy or leafy forms.|$|E

50|$|Balanophyllia europea, called also Scarlet coral or pig-tooth coral, {{is a small}} {{species of}} <b>stony</b> <b>coral</b> in the family Dendrophylliidae.|$|R
5|$|Many {{anthozoans}} are {{colonial and}} consist of multiple polyps {{with a common}} origin joined together by living material. The simplest arrangement is where a stolon runs along the substrate in a two dimensional lattice with polyps budding off at intervals. Alternatively, polyps may bud off from a sheet of living tissue, the coenosarc, which joins the polyps and anchors the colony to the substrate. The coenosarc may consist of a thin membrane from which the polyps project, as in most <b>stony</b> <b>corals,</b> or a thick fleshy mass in which the polyps are immersed apart from their oral discs, as in the soft corals.|$|E
5|$|Millepora alcicornis {{is not a}} true coral {{in class}} Anthozoa but is in class Hydrozoa, and is {{more closely related to}} {{jellyfish}} than <b>stony</b> <b>corals.</b> Because of the variability in growth habit that this coral exhibits, it {{has been the subject of}} much confusion as to its taxonomy, being described under a number of different names from different localities. In 1898, Hickson decided that the variations in morphology were due to environmental factors and that Millepora alcicornis was the valid name for all these species. This conclusion has since been questioned.|$|E
5|$|<b>Stony</b> <b>corals</b> {{have a great}} {{range of}} {{reproductive}} strategies and can reproduce both sexually and asexually. Many species have separate sexes, the whole colony being either male or female, but others are hermaphroditic, with individual polyps having {{both male and female}} gonads. Some species brood their eggs but in most species, sexual reproduction results in the production of a free-swimming planula larva that eventually settles on the seabed to undergo metamorphosis into a polyp. In colonial species, this initial polyp then repeatedly divides asexually, to give rise to the entire colony.|$|E

5|$|The 1952 {{classification}} by French zoologist J. Alloiteau {{was built}} on these earlier systems but included more microstructural observations and did not involve the anatomical characters of the polyp. Alloiteau recognized eight suborders. In 1942, W.H. Bryan and D. Hill {{stressed the importance of}} microstructural observations by proposing that <b>stony</b> <b>corals</b> begin skeletal growth by configuring calcification centers, which are genetically derived. Therefore, diverse patterns of calcification centers are vital to classification. Alloiteau later showed that established morphological classifications were unbalanced and that there were many examples of convergent evolution between fossils and recent taxa.|$|E
5|$|Anthozoans are {{exclusively}} marine, {{and include}} sea anemones, <b>stony</b> <b>corals,</b> soft corals, sea pens, sea fans and sea pansies. Anthozoa {{is the largest}} taxon of cnidarians; over six thousand solitary and colonial species have been described. They {{range in size from}} small individuals less than half a centimetre across to large colonies a metre or more in diameter. They include species {{with a wide range of}} colours and forms that build and enhance reef systems. Although reefs and shallow water environments exhibit a great array of species, there are in fact more species of coral living in deep water than in shallow, and many taxa have shifted during their evolutionary history from shallow to deep water and vice versa.|$|E
5|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{relationships among}} <b>stony</b> <b>corals</b> were first {{examined in the}} 19th and early 20th centuries. The two most advanced 19th century classifications both used complex skeletal characters; The 1857 classification of the French zoologists Henri Milne-Edwards and Jules Haime’s was based on macroscopic skeletal characters, while Francis Grant Ogilvie's 1897 scheme was developed using observations of skeletal microstructures, with {{particular attention to the}} structure and pattern of the septal trabeculae. In 1943, the American zoologists Thomas Wayland Vaughan and John West Wells, and Wells again in 1956, used the patterns of the septal trabeculae to divide the group into five suborders. In addition, they considered polypoid features such as the growth of the tentacles. They also distinguished families by wall type and type of budding.|$|E
