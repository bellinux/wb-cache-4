40|$|Exploiting a quasi-natural {{experiment}} in civic involvement projects, {{we show that}} female aspirations for <b>supervisor</b> <b>positions</b> increase by four fold if the student has worked with a female supervisor in the past. CIP (Civic Involvement Project) is a required non-credit course at Sabanci University in which first-year {{students are required to}} choose a theme on which they will work for a year. Then students are put in small groups and randomly assigned to a supervisor. These random supervisor-student matches present a natural experiment we can use to test the effect of female role models. In a sample of 1066 CIP completers, we observe that those female students who were supervised by a female supervisor were four times more likely to become candidates for <b>supervisor</b> <b>positions</b> in the following year compared to those who were supervised by male supervisors. There was no sex effect on male student aspirations for <b>supervisor</b> <b>positions...</b>|$|R
