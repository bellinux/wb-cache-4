50|$|Emile Garcke, and John Manger Fells (1912/1922) {{explained}} the most regular system {{of dealing with}} machine rates in those days.It {{has been suggested that}} the time rate for each machine should be {{based on the assumption that}} it is being worked continuously to its full capacity. Thereby the advantage, or the disadvantage, of the use of the particular machine relatively to manual labour or other machines, the effect of insufficiency of orders to keep the plant fully employed, will be more manifest, and the extent to which economies in production could be carried under other circumstances more clearly shown. As machinery is often not continuously employed to its maximum extent the adoption of this procedure would generally entail less than the actual lessened value of the machinery being written off to the various Stock or other orders during any given period. The further suggestion has therefore been made that the balance remaining on each plant account, being the difference between the amounts charged off on the before mentioned assumption, and the actual lessened value should be charged off by means of a supplementary rate to an Idle Capacity account, as representing a loss, or more correctly, a non-realised gain, consequent upon the non-utilisation of the plant to its full capacity. The information thus obtained would be of great value to the manufacturer in considering how he can, having regard to market and other conditions, realise from his plant the maximum economic advantage. The importance of this consideration cannot be too strongly emphasised, for whilst in the case of labour the number of employees directly engaged in production can be regulated from time to time by the volume of trade, such readjustment is not possible in the case of machines whose maintenance, <b>standing</b> <b>charges,</b> and depreciation have to be provided for, whether idle or employed. Sequentially they {{explained the}} system proposed by Whitmore and perfected by Church:Another mode of dealing with machine rates is to fix a normal rate per hour for the use of any particular machine, and charge the stock or other order accordingly, and to adjust these results from time to time by means of an additional rate which would be based on the fluctuations of trade, and the abnormal use or otherwise of the machine. If the results of the additional rates are charged off to the Stock or other orders, without being specially noted, it would seem that so good a measure of the idle capacity of the plant would not be obtained as by the procedure before described.* It is desirable that separate rates should be fixed for the Productive Hour and the Idle Hour.|$|E

As Ontario Hydro received a regulated price averaging 6.3 cents/kWh for power in this period, the revenues from the other forms of generation were being used to fund the operating losses of the nuclear plants. The debt left over from the nuclear construction could not be included in the rate base until the reactors were declared in service, thereby exacerbating the total capital cost of construction with unpaid interest, at that time around $15 billion, and another $3.5 billion in debts throughout the system was held by a separate entity and repaid through a <b>standing</b> <b>charge</b> on electricity bills.|$|R

40|$|We {{design a}} socially-efficient water tariff in the {{institutional}} context of England, where water metering is largely optional and non-metered households are levied {{proportional to the}} rateable value (RV) of their property. Within this context, it is theoretically demonstrated that: the larger the RV, the more likely the household to opt for metering; and the larger the RV, the smaller the Demand Effect of Metering (DEM; the fall in water consumption resulting from metering). These two hypotheses are confirmed with econometric analyses using datasets provided by a water company operating in East Anglia, England. The results signify an adverse-selection problem: wealthier households {{are more likely to}} opt for metering, yet they are expected to exhibit a smaller DEM once a meter is installed. In order to overcome this, we propose a two-part tariff for metered households consisting of: a variable charge levied proportional to water consumption at a uniform price; and a progressive <b>standing</b> <b>charge</b> to place a heavier burden on wealthier households. The latter component has a potentially major role in attaining social efficiency of metering, by encouraging poorer households to install meters whilst discouraging wealthier ones.

40|$|Since the {{liberalisation}} of the Swedish electricity {{market in}} 1996, {{the competition between}} utilities has increased, and the generation capacity has gradually been adjusted to suit the demand. Consequently, the earlier excessive electricity production capacity has been reduced. However, if {{the gap between the}} generation capacity and demand will be too narrow, this may result in notable power shortages in the electricity market. In order to achieve lower load demand, to avoid load peaks and to reduce electricity cost, a Swedish electrical utility - Skånska Energi Nät AB (SENAB), is planning to include a load demand component in its electricity tariff to make customers more aware of their energy consumption pattern and (possible) load demand problems. This study investigates the impact of the new tariff from the viewpoint of the utility as well as its customers, compared to the existing tariff. The project was carried out by the Efficient Energy Use in Buildings Research Group at the Department of Energy Sciences, Lund University. The results of the investigation show that if a load demand component were to be introduced into SENAB’s network tariff, primarily customers with a 16 -ampere fuse would incur higher network charges whereas customers with a higher fuse level would incur lower charges. With the existing network tariff, customers with high fuse levels pay relatively high <b>standing</b> <b>charges</b> in relation to their exploitation of the grid and as such they are subsidising customers with lower fuse levels. The study also shows that {{it is important that the}} new load demand pricing strategy (tariff) is communicated to customers in a comprehensive manner, so that they understand it and furthermore realise that they can save money by changing their energy consumption patterns without lowering their standard of living or comfort...|$|E
40|$|Some UK {{households}} and individuals use vastly {{more energy than}} others. Nationally, reducing personal demand for energy {{is an important part}} of meeting the commitment to reduce carbon emissions. However, despite occasional attempts to identify and stigmatise particularly ‘excessive’ gadgets or activities, energy policy has not been framed around reducing excessive consumption. By bringing empirical evidence about variations in energy consumption together with the history of policy debate on limiting energy use, this paper considers whether concepts such as excessive or luxury consumption can form the basis for policy. An overview of empirical data, based on existing statistics and surveys, provides context. This shows that energy use in the home and for personal transport varies hugely between {{households and}} individuals in the UK, even within the same income decile. A brief historical survey, both in terms of averages and variation across the population, shows changing patterns of consumption, including recent reductions in residential energy demand. The evidence demonstrates that the difference in consumption between low and high energy using households is just over a factor of two, and that household energy consumption rises much less strongly with income, than, say, transport energy use. The history of UK policy engagement with limiting energy consumption is described, with most attention paid to residential energy use. Case studies of policy proposals to constrain high consumption illustrate how these ideas have been considered. Cases include rising block tariffs, <b>standing</b> <b>charges</b> and energy tariffs, and arguments about the proper basis for EU product energy labels and minimum standards (efficiency versus absolute consumption). These suggestions for policy re-orientation have not been adopted in the UK, where most current residential energy policy is based on efficiency. However, some elements of policy are based on consumption, and these are briefly described. In the discussion, these different types of evidence are brought together. Policy based on consumption could be designed in a number of different ways. It could focus on individuals and households, or on products and homes, or a combination of both. For households, policy could aim to reduce consumption across the whole population, or focus primarily on high consuming households. There are a number of reasons - from the pragmatic to the principled - for focusing on high consumption, but as yet little understanding of what this might mean in policy terms. Many interesting questions remain as to whether a focus on high consumption should have a place within residential energy policy...|$|E
