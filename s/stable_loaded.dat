40|$|A {{theoretical}} rationale, {{which could}} {{help in the}} investigation of mechanobiological factors affecting periprosthetic tissue healing, is still an open problem. We used a parametric sensitivity analysis to extend a theoretical model based on reactive transport and computational cell biology. The numerical experimentation involved the drill hole, the haptotactic and chemotactic migrations, and the initial concentration of an anabolic growth factor. Output measure was the mineral fraction in tissue surrounding a polymethymethacrylate (PMMA) canine implant (<b>stable</b> <b>loaded</b> implant, non-critical gap). Increasing growth factor concentration increased structural matrix synthesis. A cell adhesion gradient resulted in heterogeneous bone distribution and a growth factor gradient resulted in homogeneous bone distribution in the gap. This could explain the radial variation of bone density from the implant surface to the drill hole, indicating less secure fixation. This study helps to understand the relative importance of various host and clinical factors influencing bone distribution and resulting implant fixation...|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: Two noninvasive {{methods to}} measure dental implant {{stability}} are damping capacity assessment (Periotest) and resonance frequency analysis (Osstell). The {{objective of the}} present study was to assess the correlation of these 2 techniques in clinical use. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Implant stability of 213 clinically <b>stable</b> <b>loaded</b> and unloaded 1 -stage implants in 65 patients was measured in triplicate by means of resonance frequency analysis and Periotest. Descriptive statistics as well as Pearson's, Spearman's, and intraclass correlation coefficients were calculated with SPSS 11. 0. 2. RESULTS: The mean values were 57. 66 +/- 8. 19 implant stability quotient for the resonance frequency analysis and - 5. 08 +/- 2. 02 for the Periotest. The correlation of both measuring techniques was - 0. 64 (Pearson) and - 0. 65 (Spearman). The single-measure intraclass correlation coefficients for the ISQ and Periotest values were 0. 99 and 0. 88, respectively (95 % CI). No significant correlation of implant length with either resonance frequency analysis or Periotest could be found. However, a significant correlation of implant diameter with both techniques was found (P <. 005). The correlation of both measuring systems is moderate to good. It seems that the Periotest is more susceptible to clinical measurement variables than the Osstell device. The intraclass correlation indicated lower measurement precision for the Periotest technique. Additionally, the Periotest values differed more from the normal (Gaussian) curve of distribution than the ISQs. Both measurement techniques show a significant correlation to the implant diameter. CONCLUSION: Resonance frequency analysis appeared to be the more precise technique...|$|E

The localized and non-localized solutions are obtained for a simple softening bar; the second-order derivatives of the incremental energy are evaluated. The second-order derivatives along the fundamental path demonstrate a discontinuity at the bifurcation point; the eigen-analysis of the tangential stiffness matrix fails to identify the post-bifurcation paths. The energy variation near the bifurcation point is investigated; {{the relationship between the}} stationary points of the energy profile and post-bifurcation solutions is established. Beyond the bifurcation point, the single <b>stable</b> <b>loading</b> path splits into several post-bifurcation paths and the incremental energy exhibits several competing minima.

To determine the real post-bifurcation path, the concept of minimization of the second-order energy is used as the criterion for the bifurcation analysis involved in softening plasticity.

Breakage load, equivalent to that measured in unidirectional physical tests, was determined from the results of the stress analysis by a maximum tensile stress-based failure criterion. Using this assumption, allows the determination of breakage load for a range of different kind of synthetic loading configurations and its comparison with the natural breakage load distribution of the physical strength tests. The results of numerical modelling indicated that the configuration that required the least breakage load corresponded with the minor principal axis of the ellipsoidal pebbles.
