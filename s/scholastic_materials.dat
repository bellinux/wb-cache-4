40|$|Aim : Eye morbidities with {{or without}} {{symptoms}} delineate a significant morbidity among adolescent schoolgirls in India. The study was undertaken to assess the extent of visual impairment and ocular morbidity to identify influencing factors and the impact on <b>scholastic</b> performance. <b>Materials</b> and Methods : A population-based cross-sectional study was undertaken among 3002 urban girl students of Surat in Gujarat, India. Overall prevalence of refractive error {{was found to be}} 15. 22 %; myopia affected 91. 47 %, hyperopia 4. 60 %, and astigmatism 0. 04 %. The prevalence of myopia and astigmatism was more in higher age groups, while hyperopia was more in lower age groups; even students with good vision reported ophthalmic symptoms. Of all spectacle users, in 29. 73 % cases the eyesight was not found to be with the best possible corrections. Refractive error was observed to be higher among the general caste (50. 98 %) and among Muslims (54. 05 %). Still, among those with problems of eyesight, 75. 93 % students had good academic performance. Associated ocular morbidity was noted in 20. 35 % participants along with the refractive error.

40|$|D. Litt. et Phil. (Psychology) The {{generalizability}} of scores obtained on the General Scholastic Aptitude Test (GSAT) was investigated {{for a number}} of subpopulations. It was shown that acceptable procedures for limiting bias against certain subpopulations had been implemented in the course of test development. In order to facilitate an empirical investigation of the GSAT, random samples of Afrikaans-speaking whites, English-speaking whites, Afrikaans-speaking coloureds, English-speaking coloureds and English Speaking Indians were tested. The nature and intensity of cognitive stimulation as well as the direction of intellectual development differed from group to group and had definite implications for achievement in a test such as the GSAT. All the groups contained persons who could be regarded as fully integrated into an advanced technological society, but their average level of development, measured against this criterion, differed considerably. The test displayed a one-factor structure with respect to all the groups. On the basis of the content of the subtests this factor can be equated with Spearman's g factor. The ecological validity of test scores was studied on the basis of Berry's model for the generalization of behaviour aeross various environmental contexts. The nature {{of the differences between the}} groups with respect to both the internal and external structure of the test scores was investigated by means of conceptual as well as statistical analyses. The extent to which test scores could be generalized was indicated for different combinations of groups. On the basis of regression models it was shown that could to a large extent be used as a substitute for group membership as regards the explanation of GSAT scores. Differences in functioning found between the groups could often be attributed to differences in levels of achievement. Within Berry's experimental context the test was found to be almost equally valid for all the groups and it measured developed general scholastic ability equally well. With respect to most of the pupils in the white groups, the Indian group and the English-speaking coloured group, the test results could be generalized similarly in the behaviour context. The test measured general reasoning ability with <b>scholastic</b> symbol <b>material</b> almost equally well for these four groups, so that cross-cultural comparisons witp respect to this type of reasoning ability could be made reasonably reliably. However, most of the Afrikaans-speaking coloured subjects were probably handicapped by a lack of relevant experience. There are substantial differences between the groups as regards the {{generalizability of}} scores to intellectual achievements in the ecological context. In respect of the majority of white pupils such generalization is probably acceptable, as they could be regarded as fully integrated into an advanced technological society...|$|R
40|$|Various {{studies have}} both {{demonstrated}} {{that differences in}} feminine and masculine language {{are part of a}} social construct strongly correlated to diastratic and diaphasic factors and revealed the existence of a consolidated set of expectations held by a community of speakers with regard to the linguistic behaviors attributed to gender. The shared understanding of this strong social norm and expectation, together with the modern changes that have taken over relations between the sexes and the roles attributed to them, are progressively modifying the perception of difference in speakers’ understandings of their own language, favoring the emergence of new stereotypes. In this obviously dynamic context, certain fields—such as those relating to the rooting and development of preconceived understandings of masculine and feminine language in infancy and adolescence, their propagation through <b>scholastic</b> <b>materials</b> and environments, and their added promotion through the media— remain under represented. Building on this foundation, the article illustrates and discusses the results of several sociolinguistic studies conducted throughout various geographic domains {{over the course of the}} last four years on a cross-section of children and teenagers and compares them with analogous studies conducted in the past. The results of this inquiry allow the scholar to delineate the expectations of the youngest members of society with regard to linguistic behaviors tied to gender and to outline specific traits considered (stereo) typically masculine or feminine. Overall, the data obtained may further stimulate the reflection necessary to bring into focus the development of conceptual schemas that takes place in the delicate transition from infancy into adolescence and to generate working hypotheses regarding processes of diffusion and retention governing linguistic stereotypes among adults...|$|E
40|$|Education in Uganda is {{perceived}} to be the instrument of development. Uganda {{was one of the first}} developing countries to introduce universal primary education (UPE). It is one of the millennium development goals to be achieved by 2015. This research focuses on everyday activities and the perceived importance of education and school of rural children in Uganda. This explores, the daily activities children engage in, how daily activities, poverty and other challenges affect their school life as well as what children think about their own future. The main theory in this study is the social studies of childhood. Rural children’s social relationships and cultures are worthy of study in their own right. Children are active in the construction and determination of their own social lives. The paradigm seeks to understand children as agents through involving them in research by share their experiences. Therefore, In order to understand children experiences. I took children as my informants and their views were taken seriously. My study took children’s as active participants as opposed to human becoming. Results of my study show that poverty and gender are major factors affecting boys and girls education together with other factors like early marriages, poor health, lack of enough food, orphan hood and its implications, large families, heavy punishments, disability, teacher-child relationship and age. The study has found that work is part of rural children’s life in Bushenyi. Children participate in house hold production as part of their socialization. Children in rural Bushenyi are expected to contribute to family income and at the same time learn the necessary skills that enable them to be active members of society. Children’s participation is vital in ensuring their stay in school and completion of their studies. This study determined that domestic work is part of their everyday life. I recommend policy makers like government of Uganda and non-governmental organizations (NGO’s) to provide <b>scholastic</b> <b>materials</b> to school going children. To also expand on poverty eradication programs like National Agricultural Advisory Services (NAADS) and poverty eradication Action Program...|$|E
40|$|The {{number of}} {{children}} affected by conflict situations {{is on the rise}} in Africa. All their childhood experiences are marred by war. The conflict in Northern Uganda which has taken more than 20 years continues to attract local, national and international attention. Once a vibrant area, Gulu has been shuttered by the Lord Resistance Army (LRA) atrocities. One of the eye catching scenes to Gulu is Murchison Falls National Game Park, a place where several vehicles were burnt and people butchered by the LRA which reminds the passengers the brutality they have lived with. The {{purpose of the study was}} to establish the effects of the LRA conflict on children, and evaluate interventions adopted by GUSCO in helping children recover and cope. The inquiry was qualitative with children as primary target. Data was collected using, interviews, focus group discussions, story writing, picture drawing and informal discussions. The Alternative Development theory was used in data analysis and presentation of findings. Information was coded, arranged in themes and categories based on research questions and are presented as narratives using direct quotes from informants. The findings revealed that children in Gulu continued to suffer directly and indirectly despite the interventions. With cultural values and traditions of the Acholi at the brink of collapse, the identity of the young generation is likely to be lost. Children fended for themselves and extended care to the young and elderly. HIV/AIDS prevalence increased, defilement, teenage mothers, prostitution and child labour have led to general decline in health conditions of children in Gulu. The education sector was characterized by declining academic performance and lack of <b>scholastic</b> <b>materials.</b> Night commuting still continued in the face of relative peace, Children continued to move because of domestic deficiencies and numerous deprivations, hostile home environments, accommodation problems, poverty, loss of track of parents and orphanhood. These attributes increased demands for children thus adoption of appalling survival strategies. Concerned mothers found it important to set up GUSCO to rehabilitate and re-integrate former child soldiers. Counseling and guidance, medical and traditional cleansing, sensitization programs, family tracing, reunion, formal and vocational education were essential in addressing the needs of former child soldiers. Pieterse (2001) argues that education is equal to development in a broad sense. Therefore transformation of lives of children in northern Uganda from disempowerment to empowerment requires fundamental changes, including education if children are to live meaningful lives in future. </p...|$|E
40|$|After {{decades of}} restricting private {{secondary}} education, the Government of Tanzania embarked on new {{policies in the}} mid 1980 s to support its expansion. The private sector expanded very fast {{in response to the}} high demand at the time and is still expanding today. However the policy implementers did not put much consideration on the human resources that were to run these schools. Consequently the rapid expansion of the private sector led to an increase in teacher turnover especially from the public sector. At the same time there is also competition in the private sector for the same pool of teachers as each school tries to attract the best-qualified teachers so as to survive in the expanding sector. In Tanzania, all secondary school students take standardized tests at the end of Form II and These examinations are critical for a student's further studies and future career opportunities. Parents therefore choose private rather than state education for different reasons but the decisions of many are influenced by the belief that a private school with smaller classes will raise their child's examination performance. Contemporary education theory holds that lack of <b>scholastic</b> <b>materials,</b> school environment, and family background are responsible for a school's performance This research investigates the causes and effects of teacher turnover and how turnover levels affect performance of schools. Data utilized in this investigation are from the best and worst performing schools in the National Form IV examinations using questionnaires and interviews. The results show that the factors causing teacher turnover are job dissatisfaction and teachers pursuing other jobs. The data shows that in particular low salaries, inadequate support from school administration, student discipline problems and lack of participation in school decision making all contribute to high rates of turnover. The results further indicate that turnover has both positive and negative effects on a school's performance. In particular high rate of turnover causes disruption and repetition of programmes, loss of established teacher experience and burnout and drain on energies of remaining teachers. Low turnover rates lead to inflow of new ideas from new recruits, capacity for planning over extended period of time, and strong teamwork amongst staff. This research suggests that teacher related issues should be addressed so as to reduce teacher turnover. This research is valuable since it helps to explain how teacher turnover influences the performance of schools. It is indispensable to policy makers and owners of private schools since it enlightens them about priorities for action which when met would reduce staff turnover and improve the performance of schools. ...|$|E
40|$|The National {{constitution}} of Uganda clearly underscores {{the fact that}} education is a right of every Ugandan. The same document also stipulates {{the role of the}} Government and other stakeholders in providing education. It is from this mother document that also the other key providers of education services derive their mandate. In Uganda providers of education are either private or public. In some cases the government takes over the management and day today running of some schools whose founder body is private. This is mostly for those schools that are founded by the religious bodies. Hence coining of the term ‘government aided’ schools. Even in the previously entirely public owned schools, government has introduced cost sharing as it cultivates the culture of having the parents too, share in the task of shouldering some operational costs like lunch & <b>scholastic</b> <b>materials</b> for their children among others. Hence the purely public school has quickly faded off the Ministry of Education vocabulary and the government aided has come to be the key term embracing all schools with a government attachment. Grounded in the Ugandan education system’s practice of joint education service delivery, without losing sight of the bulk of private education providers, this study sought to test whether the quality of education delivered today is better, than what it would be if one stakeholder provided the service. The study in general investigated the problems that affect the Ugandan school system, reviewed government position in lower levels of academia, and gave policy recommendations and suggestions of boosting school performance in light of the current performance. A low resource base is reported as one of the key problems that Ugandan schools still have to grapple with. It in turn has accounted for substandard infrastructure, poor library systems, inadequate teacher remunerations and appalling student housing problems in a number of schools, among other challenges. The government stewardship through the Ministry of Education was also found wanting in some aspects. Increasing funding to the education sector was one of the recommended policy interventions. Consultation of all stake holders even those in the private sector was highly encouraged in order to foster unity and flatten the ground between different school ownerships. This is projected to reduce the gap between private and public institutions and build a more sound education system founded in performance & qualitative delivery as opposed to institutional ownership. The coverage of this study could have been wider, but time and monetary resources were key hampering factors to a more exhaustive and comprehensive coverage. It is therefore my strong recommendation that a corrective study ought to be done. This should raise more palliative approaches to improving performance between public and private sector. The government also needs to realise that Uganda is a developing country and education is a priority that is highly needed to achieve and sustain development. They should therefore control most of the educational institutions as opposed to leaving majority of them in the hands of private institution owners. The government too needs to improve it’s performance as regards the role of stewardship in it’s institutions. In as far as achieving the objectives of the study are concerned, the study was largely success...|$|E
