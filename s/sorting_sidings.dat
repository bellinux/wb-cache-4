500|$|The LCDR {{enlarged}} {{the station}} in 1884 to meet growing demand: the viaduct was widened {{to allow for the}} construction of a second island platform and two lines to the east (the easternmost line was used only for freight); and the foot tunnel under the viaduct was opened. In 1885, the LCDR decided to use Blackfriars Bridge railway station solely as a goods yard but lacked the space to sort wagons at the site.

50|$|The Manchester-Sheffield-Wath {{electrification}} {{was extended}} {{into the yard}} in 1965 to allow electrically-hauled trains to the Manchester area to be handled. Seventeen miles of track from Woodburn Junction and Darnall Junction via Broughton Lane to the Reception Sidings at Catcliffe were electrified at 1500 V DC. The insulators were capable of being used at 6.25 kV AC if ever required, with the option of 25 kV AC with minimal conversion costs. Unlike similar electrified marshalling yards, to save on costs {{the main body of}} the <b>sorting</b> <b>sidings</b> was not electrified: a half of the arrival sidings was electrified for incoming electric trains; departing electric trains either had to use the southern third of the main <b>sorting</b> <b>sidings</b> (the western part of which were wired for electric trains) or had to be drawn out of the main <b>sorting</b> <b>sidings</b> by diesel locomotives into electrified departure roads where the electric locomotives were attached.|$|E
50|$|Because the 30-year-old {{facilities}} were {{in need of}} renovation, in 2009 work started on replacing and partially converting the yard. This will also {{take account of the}} increasing significance of container traffic from the ports. In the course of renovation a secondary hump with shorter sorting and formation sidings (Nachordnungsgleisen) will be given up in favour of longer <b>sorting</b> <b>sidings</b> for the formation of long-distance trains. Reception and <b>sorting</b> <b>sidings</b> and their associated points will be replaced in sets and the hump technology will be upgraded to the latest state of the art as part of the renovation work on the whole yard. A total of 220 million euros is being invested in this work which should be completed by 2014.|$|E
50|$|Medium-sized {{and larger}} goods {{stations}} usually have marshalling or shunting sidings to enable trains {{to be divided}} amongst the various local loading and <b>sorting</b> <b>sidings</b> and industrial branches, {{at the same time}} performing the function of a small railway hub.

50|$|Extensive sidings {{were placed}} {{north of the}} crossing. Those on the down side were largely used for coal traffic, but the ones {{opposite}} constituted extensive <b>sorting</b> <b>sidings.</b> Other goods sidings served Trinity Paper works {{on the east side}} of the station, and the Square Print Works on the south west side. The latter had a private internal rail system worked by a locomotive called 'Archibald'.|$|E
50|$|A second fatal {{collision}} {{occurred at}} the <b>sorting</b> <b>sidings,</b> {{just north of the}} station, on 1 April 1960 in fog that reduced visibility to 60 ft. A steam locomotive was waiting on the southbound track outside Herne Hill for a proceed signal when the signalman cleared an electric passenger train behind the steam locomotive to proceed down the same track. The steam locomotive was struck from behind, destroying it and killing the electric train's driver.|$|E
50|$|A {{few years}} later only the main <b>sorting</b> <b>sidings</b> remained: a part of these were {{to be used to}} stable steel trains destined for the Sheffield area, the rest of the {{remaining}} sidings were used to store surplus-to-requirements rolling stock in a poor state of repair. However, in 2007 the remaining sidings were lifted and a new, much smaller yard laid, additionally a new rail-linked distribution and goods transshipment centre - Sheffield International Rail Freight Terminal (SIFRT) was constructed.|$|E
5000|$|At {{the time}} of opening, the yard was {{handling}} 3,000 wagons a day. Incoming trains were split in the 11 reception sidings, propelled over the hump in the yard, from where the individual wagons rolled down a slope and were automatically sorted into new trains on the Yard's 50 main <b>sorting</b> <b>sidings.</b> The yard even had its own dedicated class of shunting locomotive (British Rail Class 13) for this purpose as BR's standard class of shunting locomotive was not powerful enough {{for use in the}} yard. [...] Each of the main <b>sorting</b> <b>sidings</b> was fitted with computer-controlled retarders to either slow the rolling wagons down before they hit other wagons already on the siding, or give wagons rolling too slowly a boost to move them along to the correct position in a particular siding. This wagon-control system, manufactured by Dowty, was very complex, needed almost constant maintenance, and crucially could not handle longer wheelbase wagons, which were already becoming more prevalent and required individual shunting. There was an express freight and departure yard of 10 sidings, and a 25 road secondary yard for local freight trains (with its own hump).|$|E
50|$|Pontypool Road {{had become}} an {{important}} junction, handling the divergence of the main line to Newport and the Eastern Valley line (the former Monmouthshire Railway line) and the Taff Vale Extension Line, as well as goods <b>sorting</b> <b>sidings</b> and an engine shed. Its gradual growth had led to an inconvenient layout, and the opportunity {{was taken by the}} GWR to build a new station, junction, engine shed and sidings facilities; the passenger station consisted of a long island platform. The new layout was opened on 1 March 1908.|$|E
50|$|In 1919 {{as well as}} the {{two sets}} of main lines there were some private sidings serving local {{industries}} including Tottenham Gas works. Adjacent to the station was a marshalling yard for goods traffic. The yard was {{under the control of the}} station master and had three reception sidings and fourteen <b>sorting</b> <b>sidings.</b> Its purpose was the servicing of the various lineside industries on the southern part of the Lea Valley Lines {{as well as the}} Enfield Town and Chingford Branch Line Chingford branch goods depots. Additionally it used to handle the perishable goods traffic as the policy was to keep this apart from more general traffic.|$|E
50|$|The Sheffield {{district}} rail rationalisation {{plan of the}} 1960s {{called for}} {{the replacement of the}} majority of the marshalling yards in the Sheffield area with one large yard. A location on the Sheffield District line was chosen and work started in 1963 with new connections being built at Treeton, Broughton Lane and Tinsley South.The 80 yard Tinsley Wood Tunnel and approach cuttings were filled with some of the material excavated from the new yard, the remaining material being transported to a tip at Oregreaves. The location allowed easy access to the brand new central Sheffield Freight Terminal at Grimesthorpe, and the new Freightliner terminal on the site of the Masborough <b>Sorting</b> <b>Sidings</b> in Rotherham, one of the many yards that Tinsley replaced.|$|E
50|$|The Down Yard is {{completely}} closed {{apart from the}} Down Staging sidings which remain open to all freight operators. The Up yard remains busy to this day shunting traffic for the nearby steel works and as an intermediary point for long distance flows. The Yard consists of Arrivals and Departures at the Thornaby end, numbered 1 to 5 for the Departures and 6 to 12 for the arrivals. There is then a shunt neck leading to 42 Primary <b>sorting</b> <b>sidings.</b> There is {{a small group of}} sidings called the Sectional Sidings which are used for wagon Maintenance and Locomotive Servicing. Thornaby Depot closed in 2008 and was demolished in 2011. Most of the track has been lifted, however the old Ash pits are used for wagon storage and there are some sidings to the south called the New Sidings which are used for the storage and maintenance of Tamping machines.|$|E

The replacement signal box was in use from June 1956 until December 1981, when its functions were transferred to Victoria; the building still exists and is used by railway staff. The signalling at Herne Hill was upgraded from semaphores to colour lights on 8 March 1959 as part of the Kent Coast electrification plan.|$|E

In 1888, Railton Road was extended to the Norwood Road/Half Moon Lane junction and Station Road ceased to exist.At the beginning of 1899, the LCDR and the neighbouring South Eastern Railway (SER) combined their operations as the South Eastern and Chatham Railway (SECR), jointly owned by the two railways. The SECR ran the trains, but the lines and stations continued to be owned by the LCDR or SER.|$|E
40|$|Purpose. Clear and {{uninterrupted}} {{operation of}} humps {{depends on the}} quality of technical equipment and control technology of cuts speed. Technology of interval and purposive regulation of cuts speed is used at most humps. The article discusses ways to reduce the cuts rolling speed to a safe level {{at the beginning of the}} <b>sorting</b> <b>sidings</b> equipped with quasi-continuous speed control system. Methodology. It proposed three fundamentally different ways to reduce the cuts rolling speed at the beginning of the sorting siding. The analysis of the ways to reduce cuts rolling speed to a safe level at the beginning of the <b>sorting</b> <b>sidings</b> was conducted using simulation the process of cuts rolling from humps equipped with quasi-continuous speed control. Findings. As a result of analysis, the inappropriateness of opposite elevation using on the roll-out part of the hump after the last separation switch point. Spot regulators of cars speed can be used to reduce the cuts rolling speed at the beginning of the sorting siding, but this leads to a division conditions deterioration on the last separating switch points of long cuts with the following after them short cuts. Reducing the cuts rolling speed at the beginning of the sorting siding can be carried out using the beam on a stationary wagon retarders park brake position. Control Algorithm park brake position is quite simple. All produce should be unhooked from it at a safe speed. If the accuracy of the implementation of the set speed output to unhook from the park brake position is low, it is possible to eliminate the error of point regulators cars speed. Originality. The question where to start location point of wagon retarders zone to reduce speed to cut level requires additional research.
