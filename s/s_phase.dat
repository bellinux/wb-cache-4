5|$|DNA damage {{checkpoint}} is {{a signal}} transduction pathway that blocks cell cycle progression in G1, G2 and metaphase and slows down {{the rate of}} <b>S</b> <b>phase</b> progression when DNA is damaged.

5|$|Earlier {{cell cycle}} checkpoints such as post-restriction point check between G1 phase and <b>S</b> <b>phase</b> {{similarly}} involve proteasomal degradation of cyclin A, whose ubiquitination is {{promoted by the}} anaphase promoting complex (APC), an E3 ubiquitin ligase. The APC and the Skp1/Cul1/F-box protein complex (SCF complex) are the two key regulators of cyclin degradation and checkpoint control; the SCF itself is regulated by the APC via ubiquitination of the adaptor protein, Skp2, which prevents SCF activity before the G1-S transition.|$|E

This earthquake processing software is based on HYPO 71 (Lee and Lahr 1975). During the relocation procedure of the events, {{the quality of the}} recorded three-component waveforms was visually checked. More than 800 events were discarded from the dataset because of poor quality. We paid particular attention to acquiring good signal-to-noise ratio of the incoming wave and to clearly identifying P and <b>S</b> <b>phases</b> on the seismograms. Additionally, we applied a Butterworth filter with a 2 – 16  Hz band range using a two-way 4 -pole on the seismograms in order to suppress the high-frequency noise and correctly determine P and <b>S</b> <b>phases</b> for each seismogram. As mentioned above, arrival times for P and <b>S</b> <b>phases</b> were strictly controlled by visual inspection. Their phases were manually picked with clear P- and S-wave arrivals.|$|R
5|$|After DNA {{replication}} is complete, {{the cell}} must physically {{separate the two}} copies of the genome and divide into two distinct membrane-bound cells. In prokaryotes(bacteria and archaea) this usually occurs via a relatively simple process called binary fission, in which each circular genome attaches to the cell membrane and is separated into the daughter cells as the membrane invaginates to split the cytoplasm into two membrane-bound portions. Binary fission is extremely fast compared to the rates of cell division in eukaryotes. Eukaryotic cell division is a more complex process known as the cell cycle; DNA replication occurs during a phase of this cycle known as <b>S</b> <b>phase,</b> whereas the process of segregating chromosomes and splitting the cytoplasm occurs during M phase.|$|E

The earthquakes were more than 100 km from the onshore seismic network and, thus, their focal depths were poorly constrained. The <b>s</b> P <b>phases</b> were recorded about 7 – 11 s after the initial P phases, with both phases having almost the same apparent velocities. The computation of ray-paths revealed that the arrival times of the later <b>s</b> P <b>phases</b> are sensitive to focal depths. We have recalculated the hypocenters and origin times for 36 events with more than six <b>s</b> P <b>phase</b> identifications on seismograms recorded at the High Sensitivity Seismograph Network by including <b>s</b> P <b>phases</b> in a double-difference earthquake location algorithm, which eliminates the errors introduced by crustal heterogeneity.

40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{the effect of}} a weak layer in the upper mantle on the deformation of the crust arising from atmospheric loading, and on the isostatic compensation process.

The damping arising from a liquid layer is proportional to the square root of the frequency and does not provide a satisfactory explanation. Scattering of the kind suggested by Jeffreys, or any other mechanism leading to the firmoviscous law, gives rise to damping pro-portional to the square of the frequency and is sufficiently frequency sensitive to be consistent with the observations. The differences between P and S can only be accounted for in terms of different behaviour of the elastic constants for dilatational and distortional movements. I...|$|R
40|$|We have {{previously}} shown that replication of fission yeast chromosomes is initiated in distinct regions. Analyses of autonomous replicating sequences {{have suggested that}} regions required for replication {{are very different from}} those in budding yeast. Here, we present evidence that fission yeast replication origins are specifically associated with proteins that participate in initiation of replication. Most Orp 1 p, a putative subunit of the fission yeast origin recognition complex (ORC), was found to be associated with chromatin-enriched insoluble components throughout the cell cycle. In contrast, the minichromosome maintenance (Mcm) proteins, SpMcm 2 p and SpMcm 6 p, encoded by the nda 1 +/cdc 19 + and mis 5 + genes, respectively, were associated with chromatin DNA only during the G 1 and <b>S</b> <b>phases.</b> Immunostaining of spread nuclei showed SpMcm 6 p to be localized at discrete foci on chromatin during the G 1 and <b>S</b> <b>phases.</b> A chromatin immunoprecipitation assay demonstrated that Orp 1 p was preferentially localized at the ars 2004 and ars 3002 origins of the chromosome throughout the cell cycle, while SpMcm 6 p was associated with these origins only in the G 1 and <b>S</b> <b>phases.</b> Both Orp 1 p and SpMcm 6 p were associated with a 1 -kb region that contains elements required for autonomous replication of ars 2004. The results suggest that the fission yeast ORC specifically interacts with chromosomal replication origins and that Mcm proteins are loaded onto the origins {{to play a role in}} initiation of replication...|$|R

25|$|Loading of Mcm {{proteins}} {{can only}} occur during the G1 {{of the cell}} cycle, and the loaded complex is then activated during <b>S</b> <b>phase</b> by recruitment of the Cdc45 protein and the GINS complex to form the active Cdc45–Mcm–GINS (CMG) helicase at DNA replication forks. Mcm activity is required throughout the <b>S</b> <b>phase</b> for DNA replication. A variety of regulatory factors assemble around the CMG helicase to produce the ‘Replisome Progression Complex’ which associates with DNA polymerases to form the eukaryotic replisome, the structure of which is still quite poorly defined in comparison with its bacterial counterpart.|$|E
25|$|At {{the onset}} of <b>S</b> <b>phase,</b> the pre-replicative complex must be {{activated}} by two S phase-specific kinases in order to form an initiation complex at an origin of replication.

Chromatin-binding assays of Cdc45 in yeast and Xenopus have shown that a downstream event of CDK action is loading of Cdc45 onto chromatin. Cdc6 has been speculated to be a target of CDK action, because of the association between Cdc6 and CDK, and the CDK-dependent phosphorylation of Cdc6. The CDK-dependent phosphorylation of Cdc6 has been considered to be required for entry into the <b>S</b> <b>phase.</b>|$|E
25|$|Upon {{receiving}} a pro-mitotic extracellular signal, G1 cyclin-CDK complexes become active {{to prepare the}} cell for <b>S</b> <b>phase,</b> promoting the expression of transcription factors that in turn promote the expression of S cyclins and of enzymes required for DNA replication. The G1 cyclin-CDK complexes also promote the degradation of molecules that function as <b>S</b> <b>phase</b> inhibitors by targeting them for ubiquitination. Once a protein has been ubiquitinated, it is targeted for proteolytic degradation by the proteasome. However, results from {{a recent study of}} E2F transcriptional dynamics at the single-cell level argue that the role of G1 cyclin-CDK activities, in particular cyclin D-CDK4/6, is to tune the timing rather than the commitment of cell cycle entry.|$|E

25|$|During the G1 {{stage of}} the cell cycle, the {{replication}} initiation factors, origin recognition complex (ORC), Cdc6, Cdt1, and minichromosome maintenance (Mcm) protein complex, bind sequentially to DNA to form the pre-replication complex (pre-RC). At the transition of the G1 stage to the <b>S</b> <b>phase</b> of the cell cycle, S phase–specific cyclin-dependent protein kinase (CDK) and Cdc7/Dbf4 kinase (DDK) transform the pre-RC into an active replication fork.

In addition to the binding of the Mcm proteins, cell division cycle 45 (Cdc45) protein is also essential for initiating DNA replication.

In this in vitro study, we investigated whether different heparin concentrations can affect the cell cycle of lymphoblasts in newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients. Materials and Methods: Lymphoblasts were incubated in different heparin concentrations (0, 10, 20 U/ml), and the percentages of lymphoblasts in each phase of the cell cycle were simultaneously measured by flow cytometry at 0, 1, and 2 hours (h). Results: The percentages of lymphoblasts at the G 2 /M and <b>S</b> <b>phases</b> were significantly increased in 20 U/ml heparin concentration at 1 h compared to 0 U/ml (without heparin) concentration. We demonstrated that heparin increases the percentages of lymphoblasts in the S and G 2 /M phases in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Conclusion: It was shown that heparin expands the proliferation of lymphoblasts by increasing the transition to G 2 /M and <b>S</b> <b>phases</b> and the S-phase fraction ratio. Heparin thus appears promising for its contribution to new treatment fields such as by providing a synergistic effect with chemotherapeutic drugs...|$|R
