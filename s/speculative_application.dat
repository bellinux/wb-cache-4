40|$|The paper {{explores the}} results of a series of practice-based {{research}} investigations of full-scale building envelope prototypes generated from parametric design strategies. The work strives to achieve integration of structure and cladding using digital fabrication (CNC and multi-axis robot) techniques. The projects employ a range of sheet materials: principally plywood, plastics, and aluminium composite panels; and integrated architectural lighting and daylighting. Two key projects are discussed in detail: habitable pavilions which allow for investigation of fabrication, assembly, structural capacity, durability, and transport. Each project sets the goal of achieving doublecurvature, load-bearing surfaces. This is explored through either panelisation or tessellation of the project geometry, or, through bending of the flat sheet materials. In each case, questions of joining, tolerance, load path and distribution, and craftsmanship are addressed and can be discussed comparatively to illuminate the consequences of design decisions. The objective of the research is to develop a repertoire of techniques and strategies for achieving formal complexity and structural integrity through an efficient means of production. The intent of the pavilion-scale work is to test out possibilities that can be extrapolated to a larger scale, demonstrated through <b>speculative</b> <b>application</b> in multi-story public building proposals...|$|E

Drawing on Goffman’s idea of “dramaturgy,” the article enunciates ways that African immigrants and migrants manage their impression and represent themselves to their peers and social groups in home societies. Using selected cases of African immigrants and migrants in the West, the article enunciates, first, how African migrants (re) present their myriad of experiences to their peers and social groups in home societies {{as well as the}} effect of those representations on prospective migrants and, second, why African migrants construe themselves in a particular way to their peers and social groups in home societies.

40|$|Charities seeking {{donations}} usually employ an “appeals scale,” a set {{of specific}} suggested amounts presented directly to potential donors. Choosing them well is crucial: if charities select overly high scale points, they risk their being ignored or even alienating donors and receiving nothing, while overly low scale points may encourage donors to give less than they'd have otherwise. Despite their widespread use, {{little is known about}} the degree to which the points on such scales affect both whether a donation is made and, if so, its size. Using panel data from a 3. 5 year quasiexperiment, we develop a joint model accounting for both donation incidence and amount. The model incorporates heterogeneity across donors in both scale attraction effects and in donation patterns (e. g., seasonality), and allows tests of distinct operationalizations of internal and external reference price theories. Results suggest that scale points do exert substantial attraction effects; that these vary markedly across donors; that donors are more easily persuaded to give less than more; and that there are strong seasonal donation patterns in giving. A significantly negative correlation between error terms in (latent) donation propensity and (observed) donation amount highlights the importance of accounting for selectivity effects. We illustrate the framework with a <b>speculative</b> <b>application</b> to “laddering”: how much charities should increase amounts subsequently requested of individual donors, based on their donation historie...|$|E
40|$|First {{published}} on December 15, 2011. In this article, the authors {{focus attention on}} a poorly understood aspect of contentious politics: {{the interaction between the}} transnational diffusion of new forms of protest behavior and police practices in response to them. Studies of diffusion are usually limited to the diffusion of one kind of innovation by one set of actors to another, as in the diffusion of technical innovations from innovators to adopters. But collective action diffusion also produces a parallel and interactive sequence of “public order” reactions. Using the transnational countersummits that emerged {{around the turn of the}} century as their source of evidence, the authors focus on the coevolution of protester and police innovations across national boundaries. The authors’ major finding is that the mechanisms that cause protester and police innovations to diffuse are remarkably similar, even though they can combine in different ways at different moments: promotion, the proactive intervention by a sender actor aimed at deliberate diffusion of an innovation; assessment, the analysis of information on past events and their definition as successes or failures, which leads to adaption of the innovation to new sites and situations; and theorization, the location of technical innovations within broader normative and cognitive frameworks. The authors close with a <b>speculative</b> <b>application</b> of their findings to the recent diffusion of protester tactics and regime responses in the Middle East and North Africa...|$|E

Sci., 53 : 245 - 248 (1996)) have been reexamined. In the cited study, data collected over a range of depths on a total of 50 tethered, anesthetized specimens were averaged at each depth, mainly at 5, 10, 20, and 40 m, then fit with a model consistent with Boyle's law. Here the data are analyzed for each individual fish, {{and a variety of}} models are used to fit the respective data set. The goodness of fit is gauged by the standard error of the regression.

This review describes the physical connection between these two forms {{as a consequence of}} geometrical squeezing of wavefronts, and describes newly established or <b>speculative</b> <b>applications</b> and combinations of the two. In particular, each can be used in analogous ways to produce surface-selective images, to examine the thickness and refractive index of films (such as lipid multilayers or protein layers) on solid supports, and to measure the absolute distance of a fluorophore to a surface. In combination, the two forms can further increase selectivity and reduce background scattering in surface images. The polarization properties of each lead to more sensitive and accurate measures of fluorophore orientation and membrane micromorphology. The phase properties of the evanescent excitation lead to a method of creating a submicroscopic area of total internal reflection illumination or enhanced-resolution structured illumination. Analogously, the phase properties of evanescent emission lead to a method of producing a smaller point spread function, in a technique called virtual supercritical angle fluorescence...|$|R

40|$|The Pentecostal Missionary Union (PMU) {{commenced}} in 1909 as a non-sectarian Pentecostal faith mission {{with many}} similarities to the China Inland Mission (CIM), {{influenced by the}} links of its President, Cecil Polhill, {{as one of the}} illustrious Cambridge Seven missionaries. In 1924 it amalgamated into the newly formed British Assemblies of God (AOG), with a full merger in 1925. This thesis reconstructs the historical narrative of the PMU examining its theology and praxis. This thesis is not a descriptive biographical narrative of the PMU’s leaders and missionaries but a historiography exploring the PMU’s development in its original context based on information provided by primary sources. Other than one 1995 Masters dissertation, no research has been conducted specifically on the PMU. This research seeks to recover the lost voice of early British non-sectarian Pentecostal missiology marginalized by Protestant mission historiography and overlooked by Pentecostal historiographers focused on American or later periods of Pentecostalism. Pentecostal historiographies have interpreted the twentieth century global revival movement largely through the ‘latter rain’ motif as an eschatologically providential event, discontinuous with previous ecclesiastical history. Pentecostal mission historiography is still developmental, especially in the employment of an historical roots methodology as opposed to traditional providential approaches. This thesis argues that early British Pentecostalism, before the Great War, originated as a non-sectarian mission movement strongly linked to antecedent faith mission roots, demonstrating the necessity for Pentecostals to engage with broader research methodologies that challenge traditional perceptions of the emergence and development of Pentecostalism. The Great War was interpreted with an apocalyptic lens that increasingly shifted Pentecostal eschatological emphasis away from missional urgency towards <b>speculative</b> <b>application</b> of Biblical prophecy with early twentieth century events. The severing of the PMU from its faith mission roots during the Great War, through CIM policy averse to Pentecostalism, reinforced Pentecostal perceptions of eschatological discontinuity and the need of a distinctive denominational identity in the uncertainty of the inter-war period. The lifespan of the world’s first modern Pentecostal missionary organisation was relatively short but it encompassed three specific periods of British history: prior to the Great War, the Great War years and the inter-War years This thesis utilises these three distinct periods to provide a progressive narrative highlighting the challenges within the PMU’s developmental history from non-sectarian faith mission to denominational mission department. The missiological emphasis of early Pentecostalism, as exemplified by the PMU, provides an understanding of the Pentecostal global phenomena a century later. Early 20 th century Pentecostal revivals occurring in various places could have resulted in Pentecostalism remaining a localised sect but its significance grew through its emphasis on missiological urgency with pneumatological empowerment. Contemporary British and global Pentecostalism cannot be explained without historiographical reference to its earliest missiological roots including the PMU...|$|E

Using a broad employability framework (covering individual, personal and external demand, and other factors) the paper considers a range of demand and supply factors, that were generally identified in applied and theoretical literature, that influence success in getting employment. The model is then used to consider the competing efficient metropolitan labor market and the local labor demand hypotheses {{in terms of the}} importance for this sample of skills mismatch and spatial mismatch. The findings suggest that professional qualifications, "soft" verbal skills and using <b>speculative</b> <b>applications</b> to employers were significantly associated with job search success. Length of unemployment, age, and having last worked in a manual occupation were negatively associated with job success, the latter decreasing the odds of getting a job to around thirty percent, suggesting difficulties in occupational "switching" for many job seekers. Higher academic qualifications were also significantly negative, as were those claiming that promotion chances will influence their reservation wage. The geographic accessibility to local jobs was significantly and positively associated with job search success. The results suggest that a range of employability factors and both skills mismatch and spatial mismatch are important in explaining job search success. The degree of "skills" or "spatial" mismatch in a local labor market will be contingent upon the characteristics of the local economy, employers, job seekers and the jobs being considered...|$|R

This can be done either by blocking computation until correct order is guaranteed, or by speculatively proceeding with the best guess (based on local information) and later correcting errors if/as necessary. Since the gainful lengths of speculative forays depend on {{the dynamics of the}} application software and hardware at runtime, an online control system is necessary to dynamically choose and/or switch between the blocking and speculative strategies. In this paper, we formulate the reversible speculative computing in large-scale parallel computing as a dynamic linear feedback control (optimization) system model and evaluate its performance in terms of time and cost savings as compared to the traditional (forward) computing. We illustrate with an exact analogy in the form of vehicular travel under dynamic, delayed route information. The objective is to assist in making the optimal decision on what computational approach is to be chosen, by predicting the amount of time and cost savings (or losing) under different environments represented by different parameters and probability distribution functions.

Theoretical properties of adaptivity of this estimation method have been proved for a specific class of time series, namely the class of locally stationary processes, with an autocovariance structure which varies slowly over time in most cases but might exhibit abrupt changes of regime. This method is based on an algorithm that selects empirically from the data the tiling of the time-frequency plane which exposes best in the least-squares sense the underlying second-order time-varying structure of the time series, and so may properly describe the time-inhomogeneous variations of <b>speculative</b> prices.

Conformal invariance of the sigma model corresponds to the condition of a stable inference scheme, directly leading to the Einstein field equations for classical gravity. By summing over all possible arrangements of the agents in the collective, we reach a string theory. We also use this perspective to quantify how much an observer can hope to learn about the internal geometry of a superstring compactification. Finally, we present some brief <b>speculative</b> remarks on <b>applications</b> to the AdS/CFT correspondence and Lorentzian signature spacetimes.

40|$|Barriers, locks, and flags are {{synchronizing}} operations {{widely used}} by programmers and parallelizing compilers to produce race-free parallel programs. Often times, these operations are placed suboptimally, {{either because of}} conservative assumptions about the program, or merely for code simplicity. We propose Speculative Synchronization, which applies the philosophy behind Thread-Level Speculation (TLS) to explicitly parallel <b>applications.</b> <b>Speculative</b> threads execute past active barriers, busy locks, and unset flags instead of waiting. The proposed hardware checks for conflicting accesses and, if a violation is detected, the offending speculative thread is rolled back to the synchronization point and restarted on the fly. TLS’s principle of always keeping a safe thread is key to our proposal: in any speculative barrier, lock, or flag, the existence {{of one or more}} safe threads at all times guarantees forward progress, even in the presence of access conflicts or speculative buffer overflow. Our proposal requires simple hardware and no programming effort. Furthermore, it can coexist with conventional synchronization at run time. We use simulations to evaluate 5 compiler- and hand-parallelized applications. Our results show a reduction in the time lost to synchronization of 34 % on average, and a reduction in overall program execution time of 7. 4 % on average. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The basic {{financial}} {{purpose of}} corporation is creation of its value. Liquidity management should {{also contribute to}} realization of this fundamental aim. Many of the current asset management models that are found in financial management literature assume book profit maximization as the basic financial purpose. These book profit-based models could be lacking in what relates to another aim (i. e., maximization of enterprise value). The corporate value creation strategy is executed {{with a focus on}} risk and uncertainty. Firms hold cash for a variety of different reasons. Generally, cash balances held in a firm can be called considered, precautionary, speculative, transactional and intentional. The first are the result of management anxieties. Managers fear the negative part of the risk and hold cash to hedge against it. Second, cash balances are held to use chances that are created by the positive part of the risk equation. Next, cash balances are the result of the operating needs of the firm. In this article, we analyse the relation between these types of cash balances and risk. This article presents the discussion about relations between firm’s net working investment policy and as result operating cash balances and firm’s value. This article also contains propositions for marking levels of precautionary cash balances and <b>speculative</b> cash balances. <b>Application</b> of these propositions should help managers to make better decisions to maximize the value of a firm...|$|R
40|$|Memoization is a {{well-known}} optimization technique used to eliminate redundant calls for pure functions. If a call to a function f with argument v yields result r, a subsequent call to f with v can be immediately reduced to r without the need to re-evaluate f ’s body if the association between f, v, and r was previously recorded. Understanding memoization {{in the presence of}} concurrency and communication is significantly more challenging. For example, if f communicates with other threads, it is not sufficient to simply record its input/output behavior; we must also track inter-thread dependencies induced by communication actions performed by these threads. Subsequent calls to f can be elided only if we can identify an interleaving of actions from these call-sites that lead to states in which these dependencies are satisfied. Similar issues arise if f spawns additional threads. In this paper, we consider the memoization problem for a higherorder concurrent language which threads may communicate with one another through synchronous message-based communication. To avoid the need to perform unbounded state space search that may be necessary to determine if all communication dependencies manifest in an earlier call can be satisfied in a later one, we introduce a weaker notion of memoization called partial memoization that gives implementations the freedom to avoid performing some part, if not all, of a previously memoized call if the application evaluates in a state in which some, but not all, dependencies are satisfied. To validate the effectiveness of our ideas, we consider the benefits of memoization for reducing the overhead of recomputation for <b>speculative</b> and transactional <b>applications.</b> For example, we show that on some workloads, memoization can reduce the overhead of re-executing an aborted transaction or failed speculation by over 40 % without incurring high memory costs. 1...|$|R
