25|$|The code {{of ethics}} that is {{affiliated}} with traditional marketing can also be applied to social media. However, with social media being <b>so</b> <b>personal</b> and international, there is another list of complications and challenges that come along with being ethical online. With the invention of social media, the marketer no longer has to focus solely on the basic demographics and psychographics given from television and magazines, but now they can see what consumers {{like to hear from}} advertisers, how they engage online, and what their needs and wants are. The general concept of being ethical while marking on social network sites is to be honest with the intentions of the campaign, avoid false advertising, be aware of user privacy conditions (which means not using consumers' private information for gain), respect the dignity of persons in the shared online community, and claim responsibility for any mistakes or mishaps that are results of your marketing campaign. Most social network marketers use websites like Facebook and MySpace to try to drive traffic to another website. While it is ethical to use social networking websites to spread a message to people who are genuinely interested, many people game the system with auto-friend adding programs and spam messages and bulletins. Social networking websites are becoming wise to these practices, however, and are effectively weeding out and banning offenders.|$|E
500|$|In late 2000, Aguilera {{started to}} record her then-upcoming material. The {{recording}} sessions {{took place in}} studios around California and New York City, including Electric Lady Studios in New York, The Enterprise Studios in Burbank, California, Conway Recording Studios, The Record Plant and NRG Recording Studios in Hollywood. According to Aguilera, the recording sessions were much longer than she thought. She further explained that lots of things came up during that time, including her first break-up with her first boyfriend Jorge Santos. Aguilera also believed that the lyrics of Stripped were <b>so</b> <b>personal,</b> and her vocals [...] "represent a rawer, more bare-bones approach as well, with less of the ostentatious riffing that has miffed critics in the past". She stated, [...] "I did the vocal gymnastics thing because it was fun. That's why I like blues, too, because you can experiment more with that side of your voice. But I thought the lyrics on this record are <b>so</b> <b>personal,</b> deep and good that I wanted to make them stand out more than what I could do with my voice technically".|$|E

Blues is about how you feel today. One day, you're down; another day is real happy and giddy. We're all laughing. Randy's direction captures that. It's always <b>so</b> <b>personal,</b> bringing the audience into the piece." [...] As well as African music, the revue includes [...] "country, gospel, the old blues, Appalachian music," [...] featuring music by Patsy Cline, Brenda Lee, Mahalia Jackson, Jimmy Rogers, Nina Simone and Muddy Waters.|$|E
500|$|Additional {{recording}} {{sessions and}} programming {{took place at}} Sa-Ra's Cosmic Dust Studio. Sa-Ra member Om'mas Keith remarked on Badu's role at their studio, [...] "Sometimes she’d come through and pick a skeletal and other times the beats would get made right then and there." [...] Keith played instruments such as the Fender Rhodes, Roland Juno-106, and Roland SH-101. Of all her collaborators, Badu only let Husayn write lyrics for her on the album. Husayn said that because Badu had not allowed anyone to do this before, [...] "she {{had to go through}} some personal things to come to the point where she'd let somebody write for her in the manner that we did. It was spontaneous {{but at the same time}} there was structure to it. It might not have the right expression, or the right enunciation. Writing is <b>so</b> <b>personal.</b> That was a big thing." ...|$|E
500|$|... "One of Us Must Know" [...] is a {{straightforward}} {{account of a}} burned-out relationship. Dissecting what went wrong, the narrator takes a defensive attitude in a one-sided conversation with his former lover. As he presents his case in the opening verse, it appears he is incapable of either acknowledging his part or limiting the abuse: [...] "I didn't mean to treat you so bad. You don't {{have to take it}} <b>so</b> <b>personal.</b> I didn't mean to make you so sad. You just happened to be there, that's all." [...] "One of Us Must Know" [...] was the first recording completed for Blonde on Blonde and the only one selected from the New York sessions. The song was released as the first single from the album on February 14, the same day Dylan began to record in Nashville. It failed to appear on the American charts, but reached number 33 in the UK.|$|E

500|$|Jackson was {{inspired}} to create an album where [...] "every song was a killer" [...] and developed Thriller with that in mind. Jones and songwriter Rod Temperton gave detailed accounts of what occurred for the 2001 reissue of the album. Jones discussed [...] "Billie Jean" [...] and why it was <b>so</b> <b>personal</b> to Jackson, who struggled {{to deal with a}} number of obsessed fans. Jones wanted the long introduction on the song to be shortened; however, Jackson insisted that it remain because it made him want to dance. The ongoing backlash against disco made it necessary to move in a different musical direction from the disco-heavy Off the Wall. Jones and Jackson were determined to make a rock song that would appeal to all tastes and spent weeks looking for a suitable guitarist for the song [...] "Beat It". Eventually, they found Steve Lukather of Toto to play the rhythm-guitar parts and Eddie Van Halen of the rock band Van Halen to play the solo.|$|E
500|$|By 2008, Cuomo had reconsidered the album, saying: [...] "Pinkertons great. It's super-deep, brave, and authentic. Listening to it, I {{can tell}} that I was really going for it when I wrote and {{recorded}} {{a lot of those}} songs." [...] In 2010, Bell told The Aquarian Weekly: [...] "Pinkerton has definitely taken {{on a life of its}} own and became more successful and more accepted ... As an artist, you just have to do what you believe in at the time, whether it’s accepted or not. You just have to keep going with it." [...] In 2015, following the Pinkerton reissue and the [...] "Memories" [...] tour, in which Weezer performed Blue and Pinkerton in their entirety, Cuomo said:The experience of learning those songs again, singing them every night, working on them with the guys, and then being in a relatively small venue with 1,000 of the most hardcore Weezer fans and hearing them sing every syllable, seeing them air-drum all the fills—it was such an amazing experience and so different from what we'd been doing the years before that ... So it was a great feeling of validation from the fans, for this album that was <b>so</b> <b>personal</b> to me and had been such a source of pain for years.|$|E
500|$|The Children's Television Workshop (CTW, later Sesame Workshop), the {{organization}} {{responsible for the}} production of Sesame Street, considered and discussed addressing the topic of divorce for many years before developing an episode. As early as 1989, writer and director Jon Stone expressed his intention of writing a script about it, stating, [...] "My two projects for this year are drugs and divorce. Divorce is a difficult one. Perhaps we could do it with puppets. I am also writing a script on drugs and peer pressure". Executive producer Dulcy Singer vetoed the idea in 1990, before it reached development. While she felt complex social matters should be discussed on the series, she felt the issue was irrelevant to inner city and financially disadvantaged families, which was the show's target audience. She said that [...] "divorce is a middle-class thing," [...] and suggested instead that an episode focus on a single-parent family, with the child born out of wedlock with an absent father. Singer stated, even after the episode was filmed, [...] "We were really nervous about the show, and we didn't think it was a shoo-in. When you're dealing with something like death, the approach can be universal. But with divorce, it's <b>so</b> <b>personal.</b> People react differently." [...] The topic of divorce was discussed again the following year, after the US Census Bureau released statistics suggesting 40 percent of all children in the United States, not just the middle classes, would soon live in divorced households.|$|E

Grand jury said there wasn't. Okay, fine. Do I have a right to disagree with the grand jury? Many Americans believe O.J. Simpson was guilty. A jury said he wasn't.

2500|$|In 1945 Smith adapted Strange Fruit into a stage play, {{directed}} by José Ferrer with Jane White starring as Nonnie and Mel Ferrer as Tracy. The play was Ferrer's first production, with him choosing to have Smith adapt the play as he [...] "didn't quite see how another playwright could capture so authentic and <b>so</b> <b>personal</b> a flavor as she already had". Smith wrote {{the majority of}} the play over the course of 1945, presenting a second draft to Ferrer in June of that year. A Baptist minister in Philadelphia initially sought to have the play banned in the city, citing the play would contribute towards a [...] "depraved society". For its run in Boston, the city required that the play have several parts omitted before it was allowed to open in the city.|$|E
2500|$|Mentalist Mark Edward relates from {{personal}} experience as a [...] "psychic performer" [...] how powerful a hit can be when someone in a large audience [...] "claims" [...] a phrase such as a [...] "clown in a graveyard" [...] statement. Edward describes a mental image of a clown placing flowers on graves and adds, [...] "Does that mean anything to someone... whereupon a woman stands up and claims that he is speaking directly to her. She remembers it as Edward specifically stating that she knew a man who dressed as a clown and placed flowers on graves in her hometown. Edward reports that it took some convincing {{to get her to}} understand that he was not directly talking to her, but had thrown the statement out to the entire audience of 300 people. She made the connection, and because it seemed <b>so</b> <b>personal</b> and the situation so odd she felt that he was talking to her directly.|$|E
2500|$|... "Happy Anniversary" [...] {{is written}} {{from the point}} of view of a dying loved one, which Pierre based on his grandmother, who died several years prior of cancer. [...] " [...] is {{basically}} [...] from the person's point of view who is dying, and all of the things that they can't necessarily say to the person that they're leaving behind," [...] remarked Pierre. The event occurred in late 2009, shortly after the band had learned of a [...] "big break, this big opportunity," [...] which Pierre skipped out on to go see his ailing grandmother. [...] "It was a weird experience being with this shell of a woman that I used to know. She couldn't move or communicate," [...] he later said; she passed the next morning. He noted that had he not gone, he would not have had another experience with her, which factored into the song’s lyrics to live in the moment. The band considered it the darkest on the album. The song was <b>so</b> <b>personal,</b> it affected the group recording the song. [...] "The song gives me shivers. I couldn't sing the song [...] I kept breaking down every time I tried to sing it. It was really weird," [...] said Pierre. Pierre interpreted the final song on the album, [...] "Floating Down the River", as a celebration of his newfound excitement for life.|$|E

2500|$|Initially, Pink Moon {{garnered}} a {{small amount}} of critical attention. Jerry Gilbert, who had conducted the only known interview with Drake the previous year, wrote the first review of Pink Moon; he was not impressed. Writing in Sounds in March 1972, Gilbert stated that, [...] "The album consists entirely of Nick's guitar, voice and piano and features all the usual characteristics without ever matching up to Bryter Layter. One has to accept that Nick's songs necessarily require further augmentation, for whilst his own accompaniments are good the songs are not sufficiently strong to stand up without any embroidery at all. 'Things Behind The Sun' makes it, so does 'Parasite' – but maybe it's time Mr. Drake stopped acting so mysteriously and started getting something properly organised for himself." [...] Another early review was written by critic Mark Plummer and appeared in Melody Maker in May 1972. Plummer appreciated the music, but was distracted by Drake's growing ascetic mythology: [...] "His music is <b>so</b> <b>personal</b> and shyly presented both lyrically and in his confined guitar and piano playing that neither does nor doesn't come over... The more you listen to Drake though, the more compelling his music becomes – but all the time it hides from you. On 'Things Behind The Sun', he sings to me, embarrassed and shy. Perhaps one should play his albums with the sound off and just look at the cover and make the music in your head reciting his words from inside the cover to your own rhythmic heart rhymes... It could be that Nick Drake does not exist at all." [...] Stephen Holden, in a more enthusiastic review for Rolling Stone magazine, said [...] "the beauty of Drake's voice is its own justification. May it become familiar to us all." ...|$|E
