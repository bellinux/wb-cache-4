40|$|A {{miniature}} assembly is disclosed {{which includes}} a housing assembly with a cover configured to be <b>sealably</b> secured to a box-like receptacle. The receptacle comprises openings on opposing sides for the seating therein of communications connectors. Enclosed within housing is custom-sized circuit board for supporting, at least, a standard communications interface {{and at least one}} electronic device...|$|E
40|$|The method {{involves}} {{inserting a}} bag (1) through a patient opening i. e. naked incision, in an abdominal wall. Tissue is delivered into a bag opening (2) of the bag. The bag opening is withdrawn {{back through the}} patient opening. The bag is sealed. The bag is inflated to create an artificial pneumoperitoneum that extends an abdomen and provides an additional working and viewing space. Laparoscopic procedure is carried out on the tissue located in the inflated bag by <b>sealably</b> inserting a morcellator into the bag. The tissue is retrieved by pulling the bag out through the patient opening...|$|E
40|$|An {{apparatus}} (10) {{is constructed}} having a cylindrical enclosure (16) within which a disc-shaped wicking element (18) is positioned. A well or recess (22) is cut into an upper side (24) of this wicking element, {{and a glass}} cover plate or slip (28) having a protein drop disposed thereon is <b>sealably</b> positioned on the wicking element (18), with drop (12) being positioned over well or recess (22). A flow of control fluid is generated by a programmable gradient former (16), with this control fluid having a vapor pressure that is selectively variable. This flow of control fluid is coupled to the wicking element (18) where control fluid vapor diffusing from walls (26) of the recess (22) is exposed to the drop (12), forming a vapor pressure gradient between the drop (12) and the control fluid vapor. Initially, this gradient is adjusted to draw solvent from the drop (12) at a relatively high rate, and as the critical supersaturation point is approached (the point at which crystal nucleation occurs), the gradient is reduced to more slowly draw solvent from the drop (12). This allows discrete protein molecules more time to orient themselves into an ordered crystalline lattice, producing protein crystals which, when processed by X-ray crystallography, possess {{a high degree of}} resolution...|$|E
