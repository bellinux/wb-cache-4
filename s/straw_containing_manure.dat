This approach {{has in the past}} been used in conjunction with cryopreservation by slow cooling, but has not previously been tested for use throughout an entire rapid cooling and warming procedure. This study determined whether keeping the <b>straw</b> <b>containing</b> the embryos inside a second protecting container throughout the cryopreservation and storage protocol would compromise embryo viability. We established that a cryoprotectant containing a high polymer concentration (35 % dextran or Ficoll) together with 25 % ethylene glycol (as the penetrating cryoprotectant) was highly effective for day 2 and day 3 mouse embryos in both single and double straws. The survival and development of all cryopreserved embryos, as assessed both in vitro and in vivo, was not statistically different to their untreated controls. This established that a protein/serum-free cryoprotectant solution supplemented with polymers could provide complete protection of mouse embryos.

30|$|The {{differences}} in the reaction rate constants of the CH 4 production among R 1, R 2, and R 5 reflect {{the effects of the}} physicochemical characteristics of the substrate on the adaptation of the microbial consortium. The pure substrates are readily degradable, but when {{they are part of a}} complex structure of lignocellulosic material such as wheat straw they become less degradable. It must be noted that wheat <b>straw</b> <b>contained</b> (7.3 %) by-mass lignin whereas xylan and cellulose were pure substrates (lignin free). This explains the difference in the amount of increment in the k value observed in R 1 and R 3 compared to that observed in R 4 and R 5. Similarly, cow <b>manure</b> <b>contains</b> fibers composed of cellulose (23.61 %), hemicellulose (18.71 %) and lignin (11.3 %). It must be taken into account that most of the readily digestible cellulose and hemicellulose in the cow diet have been digested in the animal digestive system and what is left of fiber in the cow manure is the part which is protected by the lignin. This explains why the increase in the k value in R 4 (0.0235) during the successive cycles of anaerobic digestion at 20  °C was lower than that estimated for R 1 (0.0831). However, the increase in k value in R 4 (0.0235) over the successive cycles is greater than that in R 5 (0.0207) (Fig.  2) might be due to the fats and proteins contained in the cow manure. Wheat <b>straw</b> does not <b>contain</b> any fats, and its content of protein is minimum.|$|R

This lack of oxygen, known as eutrophication, is caused when organisms present in the water grow excessively and then later decompose, in the process using up the oxygen in the water. A prominent example is the Gulf of Mexico, where much of the nutrients in fertilizer used in the US Midwest is funneled down the Mississippi River into the Gulf, causing massive dead zones. Other pollutants not commonly considered are antibiotics and hormones. In southern Asia, vultures that consumed carcasses of livestock declined 95% due to their ingestion of the antibiotic known as diclofenac.|$|R
30|$|We {{could see}} that rice <b>straw</b> <b>contained</b> 56.02  % of {{holocellulose}} and 14.00  % of lignin and lignin content reduced to 5.77  % in holocellulose after pretreatment. In other words, the delaminating rate of lignin reached as high as 58.79  % with the pretreatment of SO 3 micro-thermal explosion. As shown in Table  1, the change of hemicellulose content of rice straw before and after pretreatment was minor, what is mean xylose content could be equal after hydrolyzing. Besides, the content of water and ash was reduced to 6.60 and 1.38  %, respectively. This phenomenon was because that the small molecule or soluble substances were vaporized and washed. The holocellulose content increased to 86.17  %, which is predominantly attributed to the decrease of lignin, water and ash. This outcome would be conductive to enzymatic hydrolyzing by cellulase to obtain more available sugars.|$|R

Moreover, it was characterized the ability to grow and ferment simultaneously under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. As lignocellulosic biomass such as rice <b>straw</b> <b>contains</b> a great deal of xylose, use of xylose-fermenting microorganism is necessary to achieve efficient ethanol production from such materials.

Fractionated {{pyrolysis}} {{of biomass}} and its {{three main components}} (viz. hemicellulose, cellulose and lignin) was carried out on a thermogravimetric analyzer, which effectively separated the pyrolysis progress of different compositions. Three temperature ranges of 40 - 300 °C, 300 - 400 °C and 400 - 700 °C were presented with hemicellulose, cellulose and lignin as the dominant component, respectively.

Rice <b>straw</b> <b>contains</b> more extractives and hemicellulose, resulting in higher mass loss in the early pyrolysis stage of 40 - 300 °C.
