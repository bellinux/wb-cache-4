5|$|On {{the morning}} of September 11, 2001, the five hijackers arrived at Washington Dulles International Airport. At 07:15, Khalid al-Mihdhar and Majed Moqed checked in at the American Airlines ticket counter for Flight 77, {{arriving}} at the passenger security checkpoint {{a few minutes later}} at 07:18. Both men <b>set</b> <b>off</b> the metal detector and were put through secondary screening. Moqed continued to <b>set</b> <b>off</b> the alarm, so he was searched with a hand wand. The Hazmi brothers checked in together at the ticket counter at 07:29. Hani Hanjour checked in separately and arrived at the passenger security checkpoint at 07:35. Hanjour was followed minutes later at the checkpoint by Salem and Nawaf al-Hazmi, who also <b>set</b> <b>off</b> the metal detector's alarm. The screener at the checkpoint never resolved what <b>set</b> <b>off</b> the alarm. As seen in security footage later released, Nawaf Hazmi appeared to have an unidentified item in his back pocket. Utility knives up to four inches were permitted at the time by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) as carry-on items. The passenger security checkpoint at Dulles International Airport was operated by Argenbright Security, under contract with United Airlines.|$|E

5|$|Although Brumund's {{publication}} included {{drawings of}} Borobudur, the Batavia Society still {{felt that it}} was incomplete.

The wet monsoon season further hampered his work, resulting in a series of only 43 photographs taken between August to December. The Society was disappointed with the number of photographs, although satisfied with the printing and artistic quality.|$|E

D'Avalos recognized the relative weakness of his cavalry, but considered it to be compensated by the experience of his infantry and the large number of arquebusiers in its ranks.|$|E

5|$|During {{this second}} tour, Schwarzkopf noted two {{incidents}} which haunted him. On February 17, 1970, {{two men in}} C Company, 1st Battalion, 6th Infantry were killed by friendly fire from an American artillery shell that had been ordered by Schwarzkopf, but which had struck a tree near their position {{on its way to}} a target. The parents of one soldier blamed him for the death of their son, a claim which Schwarzkopf strongly denied and termed an accident of war. On May 28, 1970, Schwarzkopf landed his helicopter when discovering troops of B Company who had stumbled into a minefield. Two company officers had been wounded and two soldiers were trapped, fearful of setting off more mines. Although a medevac was on its way, Schwarzkopf ordered his UH-1 Huey to remove the wounded. As he attempted to help the troops back out of the field, one soldier struck a landmine, breaking a leg, and began to panic. Fearing he would <b>set</b> <b>off</b> another landmine, Schwarzkopf pinned the soldier to the ground while another soldier put a splint on the wounded man's leg. In doing so, another mine was <b>set</b> <b>off,</b> killing three and wounding Schwarzkopf's artillery officer.|$|E
