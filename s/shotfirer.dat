2500|$|The most {{important}} protection for people's health {{has been the}} National Health Service, founded by the NHS Act 1946. The National Health Service Act 2006 entitles everyone to {{health care in the}} UK, and is funded through the tax system. If people are injured at work, they may be treated regardless of their means to pay. There is also the right, under the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 to statutory sick pay. People at work can also sue for compensatory damages whenever they are injured and employers have breached a statutory duty. They can claim for the injury itself, loss of income, and relatives or dependents may recover small sums to reflect distress. Employers are vicariously liable for all agents acting for them in the [...] "course of employment" [...] whenever their actions have a [...] "close connection" [...] to the job, and even if it breaks an employer's rules. An employer only has a defence if an employee, on a [...] "frolic of his own", was not placed by an employer in a position to cause harm. Under the Employers’ Liability (Compulsory Insurance) Act 1969, employers must take out insurance for all injury costs. Insurance companies may not their employee to recover costs unless there is fraud. However, until the mid-20th century there were a series of major limitations. First, until 1937, if an employee was injured by a co-worker, the doctrine of common employment, the employer could only be liable if it was shown they were personally liable by carelessness in selecting staff. The House of Lords changed this in Wilsons & Clyde Coal Co Ltd v English, holding an employer had a non-delegable duty of care for all employees. Lord Wright held there were [...] "fundamental obligations of a contract of employment... for which employers are absolutely responsible". The second old restriction was that, until 1891, volenti non fit injuria meant workers were assumed to voluntarily accept the dangers of their work by agreeing to their contracts of employment. Only if an employee callously ignores clear directions of the employer will he be taken to have voluntarily assumed the risk, like in ICI Ltd v Shatwell where an experience quarry <b>shotfirer</b> said he [...] "could not be bothered" [...] to wait 10 minutes before setting of a detonation, and blew up his brother. Third, even if a worker was slightly at fault, until 1945 such contributory negligence precluded the whole of the claim. Now the court will only reduce damages by the amount the employee contributed to their own injury. The fourth defence available to employers, which still exists, is ex turpi causa non oritur actio, that if the employee was engaged in any illegal activity they may not claim compensation for injuries. In Hewison v Meridian Shipping Services Pte Ltd Mr Hewison concealed his epilepsy so that he could work offshore was technically guilty of illegally attempting to gain a pecuniary advantage by deception under the Theft Act 1968 section 16. After being struck in the head by a defective gangplank he suffered worse fits than before, but the Court of Appeal, by a majority, held his illegal act precluded any compensation.|$|E

5000|$|The {{disaster}} inquiry {{was told}} {{that one of the}} pit deputies (whose job was in theory to oversee the safety of the workings) admitted that he also carried out shotfiring during his shifts, in addition to his other duties. It was revealed that he fired more charges during his shift than a full-time <b>shotfirer</b> could have safely carried out. Furthermore, the colliery had made an operating loss in 1933, and the pit manager, William Bonsall, had been under pressure from the Dennis family to increase profitability. Bonsall was not a trained mining engineer and at Gresford the role of mine agent, which would normally be held by a technically experienced person with authority to stand up to both manager and owners, had not been filled for some time since the previous agent's retirement. Bonsall admitted he had spent little time in the Dennis section of the pit in the months before the disaster, as he was overseeing the installation of new machinery in the [...] "Slant", an area in the south-eastern part of the mine's Martin section. Work on improving the Dennis section ventilation had been halted, and the inquiry's chair later confessed to [...] "an uneasy feeling that Mr. Bonsall was overridden" [...] on the matter.|$|E

40|$|Between 1965 and 1971 the National Coal Board {{operated}} a scheme of training for boys entering {{the industry and}} this course {{was known as the}} Mining Apprenticeship Scheme. It was a nominal four years in length and the primary aim was to secure for the Board a steady supply of underground workers who had been trained in a comprehensive range of underground work and who would be suitably knowledgeable about aspects of the work to be considered for promotion to supervisory posts such as <b>shotfirer,</b> deputy, overman, etc. Throughout its existence the scheme was dogged by high wastage in the form of boys voluntarily leaving before completion of training. This thesis is a report of a study carried out in the South East Northumberland coal field of career aspirations of boys entering the Mining Apprenticeship scheme with a view to explaining wastage. In normal usage in industry the term apprenticeship refers to a period of training after which an individual becomes eligible for skilled membership of a craft-type trade union, and in this sense the term was wrongly applied to the Mining Apprenticeship scheme as successful completion of it did not serve as a qualification for membership of any trade union. The main conclusion of the study is that boys who typically entered the Mining Apprenticeship scheme aspired to skilled craft status and that whereas the Mining Apprenticeship was called apprenticeship by the Board it did not in practice (unlike the Craft Apprenticeship training carried out by the Board) offer such status upon completion. The boys who left the scheme went to jobs which might commonly be supposed to offer inferior prospects to those offered by the NCB but in the industrial relations sense they were little different {{in the minds of the}} boys from being a ‘pit yacker’...|$|E
