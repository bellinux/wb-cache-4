40|$|Leathers, Daniel J. Snowpack in the Sierra Nevada Mountain Range {{is the key}} {{component}} of water resources in California, and hence has been extensively investigated by many researchers. This study focuses on establishing a link between hemispheric-scale forcing mechanisms and the spring snowpack through a synoptic pathway. Daily meteorological data from Fresno, CA for the snow accumulation season from November to March over the period from 1950 to 2011 is used in a synoptic typing procedure in order to classify days with similar meteorological conditions into groups representing individual synoptic types. Twelve synoptic types are classified and subsequently related to 1 April snow water equivalent (SWE) values. One <b>synoptic</b> <b>type</b> proved to be particularly important for {{the magnitude of the}} spring snowpack explaining 50 % to 70 % of the variance in 1 April SWE at most snow courses. High frequencies of this <b>synoptic</b> <b>type</b> are found {{to be associated with the}} warm phase of the El Ni??o/Southern Oscillation and the negative phase of the Tropical Northern Hemisphere pattern. Moreover, univariate and multiple linear regression analyses show that this <b>synoptic</b> <b>type</b> is significantly related to indices of the Pacific Hadley-Walker circulation during the snow accumulation season and during the preceding fall. During the snow accumulation season the Northern Oscillation Index explains 43 % of the variance while during the preceding fall the Southern Oscillation Index accounts for 23 % of the variance in this <b>synoptic</b> <b>type.</b> Thus, a more complete understanding of tropical and extra-tropical interactions associated with the Pacific Hadley-Walker circulation may provide a basis for forecasting synoptic-scale conditions conducive to producing heavy snowfall and thereby California's water supply earlier in the water year.

Synoptic class air quality signatures are examined on an annual, seasonal and interannual basis. Residual cumulative dose analysis confirms that the "Back of the High" <b>synoptic</b> <b>types</b> are responsible for above average ozone concentrations in the summer months.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{regional}} (synoptic) and large-scale climate drivers of rainfall are investigated for Victoria, Australia. A non-linear classification methodology known as self-organizing maps (SOM) {{is used to}} identify 20 key regional synoptic patterns, which are shown to capture a range of significant synoptic features known to influence the climate of the region. Rainfall distributions are assigned {{to each of the}} 20 patterns for nine rainfall stations located across Victoria, resulting in a clear distinction between wet and dry <b>synoptic</b> <b>types</b> at each station. The influence of large-scale climate modes on the frequency and timing of the regional synoptic patterns is also investigated. This analysis revealed that phase changes in the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) and/or the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) are associated with a shift in the relative frequency of wet and dry <b>synoptic</b> <b>types</b> on an annual to interannual timescale.

40|$|Little Ice Age (LIA) {{austral summer}} {{temperature}} anomalies {{were derived from}} palaeoequilibrium line altitudes at 22 cirque glacier sites across the Southern Alps of New Zealand. Modern analog seasons with temperature anomalies akin to the LIA reconstructions were selected, and then applied in a sampling of high-resolution gridded New Zealand climate data and global reanalysis data to generate LIA climate composites at local, regional and hemispheric scales. The composite anomaly patterns assist in improving our understanding of atmospheric circulation contributions to the LIA climate state, allow an interrogation of <b>synoptic</b> <b>type</b> frequency changes for the LIA relative to present, and provide a hemispheric context of the past conditions in New Zealand. An LIA summer temperature anomaly of - 0. 56 °C (± 0. 29 °C) for the Southern Alps based on palaeo-equilibrium lines compares well with local tree-ring reconstructions of austral summer temperature. Reconstructed geopotential height at 1, 000 hPa (z 1000) suggests enhanced southwesterly flow across New Zealand occurred during the LIA to generate the terrestrial temperature anomalies. The mean atmospheric circulation pattern for summer resulted from a crucial reduction of the 'HSE'-blocking <b>synoptic</b> <b>type</b> (highs over and {{to the west of}} NZ; largely settled conditions) and increases in both the 'T'- and 'SW'-trough synoptic types (lows passing over NZ; enhanced southerly and southwesterly flow) relative to normal.

Proxy temperature and circulation evidence were used to corroborate the spatially heterogeneous Southern Hemisphere composite z 1000 and sea surface temperature patterns generated in this study. A comparison of the composites to climate mode archetypes suggests LIA summer climate and atmospheric circulation over New Zealand was driven by increased frequency of weak El Niño-Modoki in the tropical Pacific and negative Southern Annular Mode activity. 22 page(s...|$|E

Knowledge of the natural fire regime can provide forest managers with the information needed {{for the conservation of}} these species. This thesis seeks to understand lightning-ignited fires in the Grandfather Ranger District of Pisgah National Forest in western North Carolina. To this end, I used self-organized maps, an automated <b>synoptic</b> <b>typing</b> procedure, to discern atmospheric circulation patterns. Those atmospheric circulation patterns were then associated with lightning-ignited fires and with lightning strikes to understand the atmospheric configurations that favor these events. I then detailed the surface climatic variables and synoptic classifications associated with each individual lightning-ignition. Finally I used point-pattern analysis to discern the association between lightning-ignitions and mountain golden heather (Hudsonia montana), a fire-dependent endemic shrub. A twenty year period was selected for this study. In Objective 1, 500 mb geopotential heights, using North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) data, were used to create <b>synoptic</b> <b>types</b> via self-organized maps. A 12 type composite was selected for this analysis. Those patterns were then associated with lightning ignited fires using National Interagency Fire Management Integrated Database (NIFMID) data. There were 39 lightning-ignited fire events. Lightning-ignitions occurred more than expected in <b>synoptic</b> <b>types</b> associated with high pressure, and predominantly in June. Objective 2 created a lightning climatology. Lightning strikes occurred most often during summer, peaking in July. Lightning strikes associated more than expected with <b>synoptic</b> <b>types</b> with high pressure zonal flow with transitional gradients over the study area. Objective 3 detailed the lightning-ignition events. The majority of events experienced high pressure before, with dry cold frontal movement the day before ignition, and high pressure after ignition. Objective 4 used Ripley?s K analysis and bivariate analysis to discern the spatial arrangement of lightning-ignitions and Hudsonia montana. I found lightning-ignitions to be random at small scales and aggregated at larger scales, and Hudsonia montana to be aggregated across the landscape. When compared using bivariate analysis I found lightning-ignition locations and Hudsonia montana populations to be random at small scales and aggregated at larger scales. This suggest lightning-ignitions and Hudsonia montana populations are not associated with each other by point location, and lightning-ignited fires would need to burn large areas to impact the plant species...|$|R

40|$|The {{influence}} of synoptic-scale circulations on air quality {{is an area}} of increasing interest to air quality management in regards to future climate change. This study presents an analysis where the dominant synoptic „types ‟ over the region of Melbourne, Australia are determined and linked to regional air quality. First, a self-organising map (SOM) is used to generate a time series of synoptic charts that classify the annual daily circulation affecting Melbourne into 20 different synoptic types. SOM results are then employed within the framework of a generalized additive model (GAM) to identify links between synoptic-scale circulations and observed changes air pollutant concentrations. The GAMs estimate shifts in pollutant concentrations under each <b>synoptic</b> <b>type</b> after controlling for long-term trends, seasonality, weekly emissions, spatial variation, and temporal persistence. Results showed the aggregate impact of synoptic circulations in the models to be quite modest as only 5. 1 % of the daily variance in O 3, 4. 7 % in PM 10, and 7. 1 % in NO 2 were explained by shifts in synoptic circulations.

Many of the general features of the results agree well with atmospheric tidal predictions but many particular features suggest that both smaller time scale gravity waves (periods less than 6 hours) and <b>synoptic</b> <b>type</b> waves (periods greater than 1 day) may be interacting significantly with the tidal fields.

40|$|The {{classification}} and visualisation {{utility of}} the self-organising map (SOM) method was explored in the New Zealand context using the NCEP/NCAR geopotential height reanalysis and local (Auckland) meteorological and air quality data. A new synoptic classification {{was derived from the}} geopotential height data for the New Zealand region, consisting of 25 types that are self-organised (topologically-ordered) on the SOM plane. The classification has not only reproduced the typical <b>synoptic</b> <b>types</b> previously identified in the literature, but also provided an opportunity to visualise the evolution of eastward-migrating synoptic systems over New Zealand. The topologically-ordered display of <b>synoptic</b> <b>types</b> on the SOM plane facilitated visualisation and identification of the synoptic types/local meteorology/air quality relationships in urban Auckland under a holistic framework. In particular, the projection of ozone (O 3) and NOx (NO and NO 2) data on the SOM plane provides important insights into how synoptic systems affect local NOx and O 3 concentrations in urban Auckland. For example, the downward transport (from the upper troposphere/stratosphere) and mixing-in of O 3 under cyclonic conditions and the advection of clean air from open ocean waters under blocking states are two of the main synoptic-scale mechanisms that modulate daily highs and lows of O 3 and NOx in regional Auckland, bearing in mind that the coupling of local emissions, chemical processes and local meteorology is the major determinant of local air pollution. The results from this study are useful for air quality management in Auckland or similar regions, and also provide a basis for a more comprehensive assessment of the impact of weather and climatic conditions {{on the quality of the}} regional airshed. 24 page(s...|$|R

However, errors in the in situ measurements themselves complicate such comparisons. Atmospheric temporal and spatial variability are also influential. These issues are investigated by means of a special field program composed of flights of dual radiosondes and multiple radiosondes launched near the time of NOAA- 6 overpasses. Satellite derived mean layer temperatures, geopotential heights, and winds are compared with the same quantities determined from the in situ sensors. Of particular interest is the impact of in situ errors on these comparisons. It is shown that the radiosonde provides a precise pressure height relationship and therefore precise data for <b>synoptic</b> <b>type</b> use. Radar tracking of the radiosondes reveals, however, an imprecise pressure measurement which causes large differences between the actual altitude of the radiosonde and the altitude at which it is calculated to be.

Some Type 1 PSCs, called here intermediate-type PSCs, exhibit lidar signals {{which do not}} fit the two distinct groups, Types 1 a and 1 b, of the standard classification. A wavelet decomposition analysis of backscatter and depolarisation ratio high-resolution profiles is performed in order to study the vertical scales of the various PSC layers. This analysis reveals the presence of small-scale structures in the lidar vertical profiles, which are typical of mesoscale processes associated with the propagation of waves such as gravity waves into the winter stratosphere. When these small-scale structures are filtered out of the lidar profiles, most of the intermediate PSCs detected in the original data disappear, indications that the layers of intermediate PSCs must be relatively thin, possibly embedded into wider <b>synoptic</b> <b>Type</b> 1 a or 1 b layers. This suggests that intermediate PSCs observed over DDU in 1996 tended to form during rapid and small-scale perturbations associated with mesoscale processes. The lidar signal of intermediate-type PSCs may simply reflect the sampling of rapidly evolving PSCs, supporting the view of these intermediate PSCs as transition-type PSCs. It is worth noticing that the vertical scale of theses processes cannot be fully resolved in meteorological analysis or satellite data.

They represent an important mechanism of poleward transport {{of energy and}} momentum. This paper provides an analysis of water vapour transport in TTT systems. An objective sampling of TTT systems is conducted from analysis of daily satellite rainfall products. During the sampled TTT events, rain bands extend from tropical southern Africa near 10 °S to the midlatitudes of the southwest Indian Ocean. The divergent and non-divergent (streamfunction) components of vertically integrated water vapour flux associated with major TTT events are calculated, from National Centers for Environmental Prediction reanalysis data. During TTT events the streamfunction circulation dominates water vapour transport, although adjustments to the divergent component are relatively more important. The results indicate that TTT events facilitate a substantial water vapour flux from the tropics into the midlatitudes. Water vapour transport to the midlatitudes along the TTT axis is facilitated largely by changes to the streamfunction, associated with a strengthening and eastward displacement of the Indian Ocean high, {{and the advent of}} midlatitude transients. It is also shown that TTT systems are major regions of moisture convergence. The high vapour concentrations along {{the full extent of the}} TTT rain bands are maintained by the divergent circulation. The structure of these divergent vapour flux anomalies is suggestive of adjustments to the Walker circulation, involving strong anomalous divergence over the maritime continent/west Pacific and a weaker enhancement of the major divergence centre over the tropical Atlantic...|$|E

40|$|Ozone and {{particle}} pollution are {{of concern for}} the Sydney basin, in particular during warm months (November to March) when pollution levels can exceed national standards. Previous studies on the relationship between synoptic circulation and air quality focused on high pollution days or aggregated air quality conditions over the region as a whole. This study provides both temporal and spatial analyses of the synoptic processes affecting warm-month ozone and {{particle pollution}} in Sydney. A warm-month synoptic catalogue was developed by applying the self-organising map method to the NCEP/NCAR geopotential height reanalysis for south-east Australia. The catalogue was linked to mesoscale meteorological features such as drainage flows and sea breezes, and subsequently to the spatial variability in air quality across the Sydney basin. The typical <b>synoptic</b> <b>types</b> commonly associated with high or low ozone and PM 10 levels, as well as variations in visibility, were identified. The results suggest that, due to Sydney's subtropical coastal-basin environment, the interaction between meso- and synoptic-scale features determine local air quality conditions in the region, rather than the synoptic conditions alone. Emissions from bushfires appear to have considerable impacts on the synoptic modulation to visibility and PM 10 levels, with such impacts tending to be more at a local scale. In contrast, no comparable impacts were found for ozone pollution. For ozone and visibility, the probability for an exceedance day under some <b>synoptic</b> <b>types</b> varied considerably over time, implying that {{there might have been a}} shift in the role of synoptic modulation to local air quality associated with changes in air emissions profiles. This study provides a leap in our understanding of the relationship between synoptic circulation and air quality in a coastal-basin environment.

In all 16 different classification schemes, representative of four general approaches in <b>synoptic</b> <b>typing</b> (leader algorithm, optimization scheme, predefined types, eigenvector analysis) were considered. Several statistical measures variously quantifying performance in arranging daily observations into clearly defined homogenous groups were employed. Based on the results {{it was not possible to}} identify a single optimum classification or general approach in <b>synoptic</b> <b>typing.</b> This is related to inconsistencies in performance with respect to the specific target variable and statistical measures used; the results were also shown to be conditional on the number of circulation types (CTs) as well as spatiotemporal dependencies in performance. However, the study did indicate that those typing schemes based on predefined thresholds (Litynski, GrossWetterTypes, LambWeather Type) – along with the Kruizinga and Lund classifications – were better able to resolve surface temperature. With respect to precipitation those classifications derived using some optimization procedure (simulated annealing, Self Organizing Maps, k-means clustering) were consistently among the best-performing schemes. In capturing the relationship between synoptic-scale circulation and precipitation the importance of incorporating somemeasure of vorticitywas highlighted; in contrast the inclusion of discrete directional patterns was shown to be important for resolving variations in local temperature. The classifications generally performed best for winter, reflecting the closer coupling between circulation and surface conditions during this period. Spatial patterns in the synoptic–climatological relationship were more apparent for precipitation.

40|$|We use the 2 B-GEOPROF-LIDAR R 04 (2 BGL 4) and R 05 (2 BGL 5) {{products}} and the 2 B-CLDCLASSLIDAR R 04 (2 BCL 4) product, all generated by combining CloudSat radar and CALIPSO lidar satellite measurements with auxiliary data, {{to examine the}} vertical distribution of cloud occurrence around the Ross Ice Shelf (RIS) and Ross Sea region. We find that the 2 BGL 4 product, used in previous studies in this region, displays a discontinuity at 8. 2  km which is not observable in the other products. This artefact appears to correspond with {{a change in the}} horizontal and vertical resolution of the CALIPSO dataset used above this level. We then use the 2 BCL 4 product to examine the vertical distribution of cloud occurrence, phase, and type over the RIS and Ross Sea. In particular we examine how synoptic conditions in the region, derived using a previously developed synoptic classification, impact the cloud environment and the contrasting response in the two regions. We observe large differences between the cloud occurrence as a function of altitude for synoptic regimes relative to those for seasonal variations. A stronger variation in the occurrence of clear skies and multi-layer cloud and in all cloud type occurrences over both the Ross Sea and RIS is associated with <b>synoptic</b> <b>type</b> than seasonal composites. In addition, anomalies from the mean joint histogram of cloud top height against thickness display significant differences over the Ross Sea and RIS sectors as a function of synoptic regime, but are near identical over these two regions when a seasonal analysis is completed. However, the frequency of particular phases of cloud, notably mixed phase and water, is much more strongly modulated by seasonal than synoptic regime compositing which suggests that temperature is still the most important control on cloud phase in the region...|$|E
40|$|Surface {{climate in}} Europe is {{changing}} and patterns in trends {{have been found}} to vary at sub-seasonal scales. This study aims to contribute {{to a better understanding of}} these changes across space and time by analysing to what degree observed climatic trends can be attributed to changes in synoptic atmospheric circulation. The relative importance of synoptic circulation changes (i. e. trends in <b>synoptic</b> <b>type</b> frequencies) as opposed to trends in the hydrothermal properties of synoptic types (within-type trends) on precipitation and temperature trends in Europe is assessed on a monthly basis. The study is based on mapping spatial and temporal trend patterns and their variability at a relatively high resolution (0. 5 ° × 0. 5 °; monthly) across Europe. Gridded precipitation and temperature data (1963 – 2001) originate from the Watch Forcing Data set and synoptic types are defined by the objective SynopVis Grosswetterlagen (SVG). During the study period, relatively high influence of synoptic circulation changes are found from January to March, contributing to wetting trends in northern Europe and drying in the south. Simultaneously, particularly dry synoptic types get warmer first in south-western Europe in November and/or December and affect most of Europe in March and/or April. Strong influence of synoptic circulation changes is again found in June and August. In general, changes in synoptic circulation has a stronger effect on climate trends in north-western Europe than in the south-east. The exact locations of the strongest influence of synoptic circulation changes vary with the time of year and to some degree between precipitation and temperature. Throughout the year and across the whole of Europe, precipitation and temperature trends are caused by a combination of synoptic circulation changes and within-type changes with their relative influence varying between regions, months and climate variables...|$|E
40|$|A {{sustained}} morphodynamic reorganisation of {{the east}} Australian coast occurred over a large latitudinal gradient from subtropical Queensland (S 25 °) to mid-latitude Bass Strait (S 40 °) between ~ 1600 to 1900 CE. These changes indicate that a large-scale shift in the modal climate occurred together with changes in extreme storm frequency or clustering of East Coast Cyclones (ECC), {{when compared to the}} past century. ECC are complex subtropical weather systems that form off the east coast of Australia and/or travel parallel to the coast of Australia from south-east Queensland to Victoria. We investigate coastal evolution and the associated climate drivers using a novel combination of methods, including: LIDAR DEM and field mapping of coastal geology; a decadal-scale climate reconstruction of sea-level pressure, marine windfields, and paleo-storm <b>synoptic</b> <b>type</b> and frequency, using a paleoclimate data assimilation approach; together with wave transformation and coastal planform modelling for paleo-wave directions, and historical bathymetry. We present the morphodynamic response to changes in directional wave power, by linking the paleo-windfield reconstruction to wave transformation models. The combined methodology has illuminated the 'ultimate' storm impacts not seen in the past century, and defines the multi-decadal coastal system response and recovery to extreme storm sequences. Increased embaymentisation and anticlockwise rotation of embayed and barrier coast planform geometry; shifts in barrier-estuary-inlet configuration; and a ubiquitous foredune transgression, are shown to have occurred between ~ 1600 to 1800 CE. This was in response to a poleward shift in the subtropics and frequency of tradewind-driven wave climate, and tropical-origin storms. From 1800 to 1900 CE, an equatorward shift in the subtropics, and clustering of extratropical-origin storms drove an increase in the shoreface-littoral sediment budget and a clockwise coastline progradation. This energetic, oblique directional wave climate, delivered higher than modern across-shoreface and alongshore sand transport rates. The 20 th century decline in storm wave energy and implied reduction in across-shoreface sand transport is a significant driver of modern shoreline behavior along the Australian east coast. 1 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Fourteen {{years of}} {{meteorological}} parameters, aerosol variables (absorption and scattering coefficients, aerosol number concentration) and trace gases (CO, NO x, SO 2) {{measured at the}} Jungfraujoch (JFJ, 3580 m a. s. l.) have been analyzed {{as a function of}} different <b>synoptic</b> weather <b>types.</b> The Schüepp <b>synoptic</b> weather <b>type</b> of the Alps (SYNALP) classification from the Alpine Weather Statistics (AWS) was used to define the synoptic meteorology over the whole Swiss region. The seasonal contribution of each <b>synoptic</b> weather <b>type</b> to the aerosol concentration was deduced from the aerosol annual cycles while the planetary boundary layer (PBL) influence was estimated by means of the diurnal cycles. Since aerosols are scavenged by precipitation, the diurnal cycle of the CO concentration was also used to identify polluted air masses. SO 2 and NO x concentrations were used as precursor tracers for new particle formation and growth, respectively. The aerosol optical parameters and number concentration show elevated loadings during advective weather types during the December–March period and for the convective anticyclonic and convective indifferent weather types during the April–September period. This study confirms the consensus view that the JFJ is mainly influenced by the free troposphere during winter and by injection of air parcels from the PBL during summer. A more detailed picture is, however, drawn where the JFJ is completely influenced by free tropospheric air masses in winter during advective weather types and largely influenced by the PBL also during the night in summer during the subsidence weather type. Between these two extreme situations, the PBL influence at the JFJ depends on both the time of year and the <b>synoptic</b> weather <b>type.</b> The fraction of PBL air transported to the JFJ was estimated by the relative increase of the specific humidity and CO...|$|R
40|$|A {{comparison}} of two statistical downscaling methods for daily maximum and minimum surface air temperature, total daily precipitation and total monthly precipitation at Indianapolis, IN, USA, is presented. The analysis is conducted for two seasons, {{the growing season}} and the non-growing season, defined based on variability of surface air temperature. The predictors used in the downscaling are indices of the synoptic scale circulation derived from rotated principal components analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis of variables extracted from an 18 -year record from seven rawinsonde stations in the Midwest region of the United States. PCA yielded seven significant components for the growing season and five significant components for the non-growing season. These PCs explained 86 % and 83 % of the original rawinsonde data for the growing and non-growing seasons, respectively. Cluster analysis of the PC scores using the average linkage method resulted in eight growing season <b>synoptic</b> <b>types</b> and twelve non-growing <b>synoptic</b> <b>types.</b> The downscaling of temperature and precipitation is conducted using PC scores and cluster frequencies in regression models and artificial neural networks (ANNs). Regression models and ANNs yielded similar results, but the data for each regression model violated {{at least one of}} the assumptions of regression analysis. As expected, the accuracy of the downscaling models for temperature was superior to that for precipitation. The accuracy of all temperature models was improved by adding an autoregressive term, which also changed the relative importance of the dominant anomaly patterns as manifest in the PC scores. Application of the transfer functions to model daily maximum and minimum temperature data from an independent time series resulted in correlation coefficients of 0. 34 – 0. 89. In accord with previous studies, the precipitation models exhibited lesser predictive capabilities. The correlation coefficient for predicted versus observed daily precipitation totals was less than 0. 5 for both seasons, while that for monthly total precipitation was below 0. 65. The downscaling techniques are discussed in terms of model performance, {{comparison of}} techniques and possible model improvements...|$|R
40|$|Aim of this {{presentation}} is to analyse the synoptic conditions favourable to snowfall {{with more than}} 10 cm fresh snow cover {{in the bottom of}} the Trentine sector of the Adige Valley. Following the abundant and reiterated snowfalls in the study area during the 2005 - 2006 winter season and the many discomforts to the population and mainly to the road traffic, an accurate study of such events resulted necessary for a reliable forecast. The valley orientation in a NNE-SSW direction lets the Mediterranean warm-humid air masses to get in as far as the main headwater divide (Brenner Pass) and to make its climate relatively mild. Moreover, such humid air inflows bring mean annual precipitation of about 800 - 1000 mm that gradually decreses from the lower valley mouth to the main divide. The precipitation regime consists of rainfalls in spring and autumn whereas a strong absolute minimum occurs between December and Febraury when snowfalls are more likely on the valley floor. In fact, the vally is annually subjected to warm advection snowfalls, though infrequent and scarce, between November and mid April. The study area is about 80 km long with elevation ranging from 130 and 230 m a. s. l. All the snowfall events observed from 1980 to 2006 were analysed by using the data of the Civil Protection Authority of Trento Province, i. e. Trento Roncafort (194 n a. s. l.), Trento Laste (312 m a. s. l.), Rovereto (203 m a. s. l.) and Ala (197 m a. s. l.) meteo stations. Through the study and analysis of ground and at the 500 hPa geopotential meteo maps, satellite images, thermodynamic diagrams of the nearest sounding stations and the data of the nivometeorological stations, the <b>synoptic</b> <b>types</b> that characterised the snowfalls were studied and classified and a clusterisation was made. For each of the <b>synoptic</b> <b>types</b> defined the conditions for a quantification of the mean characteristic meteo parameters were anlysed in order to obtain a reliable forecast of intense snowfalls on the valley bottom...|$|R
