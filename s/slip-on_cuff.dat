40|$|ME 450 Capstone Design and Manufacturing Experience: Fall 2015 The {{design team}} spent eight {{weeks in the}} Obstetrics and Gynecology Department at a {{tertiary}} referral hospital, Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital (KATH), in Kumasi, Ghana. During the team’s immersion experience at the hospital, the team observed healthcare providers experiencing difficulty following obstetrics patients’ blood pressure management plans. This occurred {{largely because of the}} high volume of patients and the busyness of the wards. The patient's blood pressure measurement strongly influences the treatment especially if she has hypertensive disorders. Hypertensive disorders, mainly preeclampsia and eclampsia, are the second leading cause of maternal mortality worldwide and the leading cause of maternal mortality at KATH. The team identified an opportunity {{for the development of a}} blood pressure measurement device to aid the healthcare providers in measuring the patients’ blood pressures every 30 minutes or four hours according to their management plans. This project is in collaboration with clinical mentors and advisors at University of Michigan Hospital and KATH. The final design is an auscultatory device with a microphone stethoscope and headphones to listen to the Korotkoff sounds, a hand pump for manual inflation, an automatic constant rate deflation facilitated by a solenoid valve, a LCD screen to display the current pressure, a <b>slip-on</b> <b>cuff,</b> an aneroid pressure gauge for calibration, a handle, a storage area, and a rechargeable battery. The current prototype follows the design fairly closely however the device is not powered by a rechargeable battery and the electrical components are all on a breadboard which prevents its portability. All validation testing completed so far on the current prototype has been promising including testing the accuracy and ease-of-use of the device when used by three nursing student. This device will be continued to be improved next semester so that it can be taken to KATH for further validation and feedback...|$|E
