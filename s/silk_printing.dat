40|$|Water based silk {{solutions}} {{were successfully}} inkjet printed {{for the first}} time into patterns of parallel lines onto vinyl plastic substrates. Human bone marrow stromal cells (hMSCs) were seeded on the <b>silk</b> <b>printed</b> patterns and cultured in the presence of 100 ng/ml of bone morphogenic protein (BMP- 2). After one week of culture cell growth and attachment showed site specificity on the <b>silk</b> <b>printed</b> lines. Both alkaline phosphatase activity and cell morphology indicated hBMSCs differentiation into osteogenic cells along the <b>silk</b> <b>printed</b> lines. After 4 week of culture, the cellular bridging of adjacent <b>silk</b> <b>printed</b> lines took place for all interline distances lower than 1. 25 mm. Therefore, commercial inkjet printing technology can produce complex viable cellular patterns with 111 ± 24 μm lateral resolution, through the deposition of bioactive materials. The results provide a first step toward cell specific control using 3 D inkjet printing techniques using biocompatible gel systems to regulate cell functions...|$|R

50|$|Asprey was {{established}} in England in Mitcham, Surrey in 1781. Founded as a <b>silk</b> <b>printing</b> business by William Asprey, it soon became a luxury emporium. In 1841, William Asprey's elder son Charles went into partnership with a stationer located on London's Bond Street. In 1847 the family broke with this partner and moved into 167 New Bond Street, the premises Asprey occupies today. From its central London location Asprey advertised 'articles of exclusive design and high quality, whether for personal adornment or personal accompaniment and to endow with richness and beauty the table and homes of people of refinement and discernment.' An early speciality was dressing cases. Asprey crafted traditional cases and designs, mostly in leather, suitable for the new style of travel ushered in by railways. The main competitors {{at the time were}} H.J. Cave & Sons. Asprey was recognised for its expertise when it won a gold medal for its dressing cases at the International Exhibition of 1862 but lost out to its rivals, H.J. Cave & Sons in 1867.|$|E

50|$|Unlike {{paper or}} fabric, glass is nonabsorbent and {{transparent}} so applying digital printing technology {{had to be}} adapted to overcome the challenges presented by the glass itself. Until 2007 the two main methods of printing on glass were <b>silk</b> screen <b>printing</b> and digital UV <b>printing.</b> <b>Silk</b> screen <b>printing,</b> where the ink is applied directly {{onto the surface of}} the glass through a mesh stencil, was patented in 1907. Screen printed transfers, where the image is transferred from a paper onto the glass, was patented in the 1930s by Johnson Mattey. Firing is necessary in both methods in order for the ink to be permanently infused with the glass.|$|R
