2500|$|Medical cannabis, {{or medical}} {{marijuana}} {{can refer to}} the use of cannabis and its cannabinoids to treat disease or improve symptoms; however, there is no single agreed upon definition. The use of cannabis as a medicine has not been rigorously scientifically tested, often due to production restrictions and other federal regulations. There is limited evidence suggesting cannabis can be used to reduce nausea and vomiting during chemotherapy, to improve appetite in people with HIV/AIDS, and to treat chronic pain and muscle spasms. This is the most widely consumed form, containing 3% to 20% THC, with reports of up-to 33% THC. This is the <b>stock</b> <b>material</b> from which all other preparations are derived.

40|$|The present paper {{summarizes}} {{the outcome of}} a roundtable discussion on reintroductions or restocking as a management strategy for native European crayfish, which took place during the European Crayfish conference in Poitiers, France in September 2001. Aspects related to the suitability of the target habitat, the <b>stocking</b> <b>material</b> and the <b>stocking</b> procedure itself are important to consider during any reintroduction measure: Apart from general water quality and structural parameters, a suitable habitat is ideally geographically isolated from other surface waters and human activities such as intensive fishing pressure. However, it is of striking importance {{to make sure that the}} target habitat is free of crayfish plague, e. g. by experimental in situ exposure of native specimens. Overexploitation should be avoided if the <b>stocking</b> <b>material</b> originates from other surface waters and genetic aspects should be considered in <b>stocking</b> <b>material</b> originating from both natural surface waters and crayfish farms. Information for the stocking procedure itself are summarized from experiences gathered in various European countries. As an overall result of the discussion, the following three key questions related to reintroductions of native crayfish arised: 1. Why are the native crayfish not present (anymore) in the target habitat? 2. Do native crayfish survive in situ exposure as a test for crayfish plague? 3. Is the reintroduction or restocking measure successful in establishing a self-sustaining stock of native crayfish...|$|R

6000|$|John Ingerfield, when {{he asked}} Anne Singleton to be his wife, felt no more love for her than he felt {{for any of the}} other sumptuous {{household}} appointments he was purchasing about the same time, and made no pretence of doing so. Nor, had he done so, would she have believed him; for Anne Singleton has learned much in her twenty-two summers and winters, and knows that love is only a meteor in life's sky, and that the true lodestar of this world is gold. Anne Singleton has had her romance and buried it deep down in her deep nature and over its grave, to keep its ghost from rising, has piled the stones of indifference and contempt, as many a woman has done before and since. Once upon a time Anne Singleton sat dreaming out a story. It was a story old as the hills--older than some of them--but to her, then, it was quite new and very wonderful. It contained all the usual <b>stock</b> <b>material</b> common to such stories: the lad and the lass, the plighted troth, the richer suitors, the angry parents, the love that was worth braving all the world for.

But my father threatens to stop my allowance, and, as you know, I have nothing of my own except debts. Some would call her handsome, but how can I think of her beside you? Oh, why was money ever let to come into the world to curse us?"

For comparison reasons, nanocellulose (NC) from bleached kraft pulp (BKP) was produced in a similar approach as NLC. Both the NLC and the NC were blended with their respective pulp fibres and their corresponding handsheets properties were evaluated with respect to sheet density. It was found that the handsheets of pulp fibres blended with NLC/NC improved the mechanical properties of handsheets with only a slight effect in relation to the sheet density. Improvements in strength properties of handsheets such as z-strength, tensile index, tear index, burst index, E-modulus, strain at break, tensile stiffness, air resistance were observed...|$|R
