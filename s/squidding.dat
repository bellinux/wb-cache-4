40|$|Summary. [...] Reasom for Enquiry. [...] To {{determine}} {{the underlying cause}} {{of the collapse of}} a parachute, known as ' <b>squidding.</b> ' Range of Investigatio~,. [...] Measurements of pressure were made in a wind tunnel at. a number of positions over the surfaces of rigid models representing (a) a fully inflated canopy (b) a semi-squidded shape, and also at points over tile surface of a small paiachute. Each rigid model was uniformly perforated with holes representing a degree of porosity which was varied in some of tile tests by covering different areas of the surface. Tests on the parachute were made with it tethered, (1) with rigging lines to a fixed point, (2) by wires to tile sides of the tunnel. Directional measurements of flow required for tracing streamlines were made in the neighbourhood of the parachute {{both before and after the}} fabric had been rendered non-porous. Conclusions. [...] It was found that, through the lack of deformable areas near each mouth, tile rigid models did not reproduce adequately the prerequisite conditions of flow which normally lead to <b>squidding.</b> Radial outward forces tending to prevent collapse were shown to depend not only on the pressure inside. the canopy but also on the strength and direction of the local flow. Any change which brings tile direction nealer to that of tile axis of the parachute decreases tile incidence of the lip of each gore, and hence reduces the outward radial force. Such a change results from an increase in porosity of the fabric, and since an increase in porosity usually occurs with rise of speed, tile proces...|$|E
40|$|A {{preliminary}} {{investigation of the}} aerodynamic and control characteristics of a flexible glider similar to a parachute in construction has been made at the Langley Research Center to evaluate its capabilities as a reentry glider. Preliminary weight estimates of the proposed vehicle indicate that such a structure {{can be made with}} extremely low wing loading. Maximum temperatures during the reentry maneuver might be held as low as about 1, 500 F. The results of wind-tunnel and free-glide tests show that the glider when constructed of nonporous material performed extremely well at subsonic speeds and could be flown at angles of attack from about 200 to 900. At supersonic speeds the wing showed none of the unfavorable tendencies exhibited by conventional parachutes at these speeds, such as <b>squidding</b> and breathing. Several methods of packing and deploying the glider have been successfully demonstrated.

40|$|AbstractWe {{designed}} a digital double relaxation oscillation <b>SQUID</b> (DROS) with an single flux quantum (SFQ) feedback circuit for digital <b>SQUID</b> magnetometers. The DROS is magneticall coupled to a feedback <b>SQUID</b> loop and a signal magnetic flux is input to the feedback <b>SQUID</b> loop. The DROS generates {{two kinds of}} voltage pulses corresponding to the total magnetic flux in the feedback <b>SQUID</b> loop. Those voltage pulses are converted to SFQ and anti-SFQ pulses and input to the feedback <b>SQUID</b> loop to keep the magnetic flux in the feedback <b>SQUID</b> loop constant. A read-out dc <b>SQUID</b> (R/O <b>SQUID)</b> is also magnetically coupled to the feedback <b>SQUID</b> loop for monitoring the actual magnetic flux in the feedback <b>SQUID</b> loop. The number of the generated SFQ pulses is estimated by SFQ feedback steps on output voltage curves generated from the R/O <b>SQUID.</b> Wide dynamic operation range is realized by the SFQ feedback and sub-Œ¶ 0 magnetic flux resolution is realized by the R/O <b>SQUID,</b> where Œ¶ 0 (= h/ 2 e) is the single magnetic flux quantum.

50|$|As {{the name}} implies, <b>SQUIDs</b> {{are made from}} superconducting material. As a result, {{they need to be}} cooled to {{cryogenic}} temperatures of less than 90 K (liquid nitrogen temperatures) for high temperature <b>SQUIDs</b> and less than 9 K (liquid helium temperatures) for low temperature <b>SQUIDs.</b> For magnetic current imaging systems, a small (about 30 ¬µm wide) high temperature <b>SQUID</b> is used. This system has been designed to keep a high temperature <b>SQUID,</b> made from YBa2Cu3O7, cooled below 80K and in vacuum while the device under test is at room temperature and in air. A <b>SQUID</b> consists of two Josephson tunnel junctions that are connected together in a superconducting loop (see Figure 1). A Josephson junction is formed by two superconducting regions that are separated by a thin insulating barrier. Current exists in the junction without any voltage drop, up to a maximum value, called the critical current, Io. When the <b>SQUID</b> is biased with a constant current that exceeds the critical current of the junction, then changes in the magnetic flux, Œ¶, threading the <b>SQUID</b> loop produce changes in the voltage drop across the <b>SQUID</b> (see Figure 1). Figure 2(a) shows the I-V characteristic of a <b>SQUID</b> where ‚àÜV is the modulation depth of the <b>SQUID</b> due to external magnetic fields. The voltage across a <b>SQUID</b> is a nonlinear periodic function of the applied magnetic field, with a periodicity of one flux quantum, Œ¶0=2.07√ó10‚àí15 Tm2 (see Figure 2(b)). In order to convert this nonlinear response to a linear response, a negative feedback circuit is used to apply a feedback flux to the <b>SQUID</b> so as to keep the total flux through the <b>SQUID</b> constant. In such a flux locked loop, the magnitude of this feedback flux is proportional to the external magnetic field applied to the <b>SQUID.</b> Further description of the physics of <b>SQUIDs</b> and <b>SQUID</b> microscopy can be found elsewhere.|$|R

40|$|The flux {{modulation}} scheme (FMS) {{is the standard}} readout technique of dc <b>SQUIDs,</b> where a step-up transformer links the <b>SQUID</b> to the preamplifier. The transformer's primary winding shunts the <b>SQUID</b> via a large capacitor while the secondary winding connects it to the preamplifier. A modulation flux having a frequency of typically 100 [*]kHz generates an ac voltage across the <b>SQUID,</b> stepped up by the transformer. The <b>SQUID</b> with FMS is customarily operated in the current bias mode, because a constant dc bias current flows only through the <b>SQUID</b> due to the capacitor isolation. With FMS, however, the transformer ac shunts the <b>SQUID</b> so that in reality the operating mode is neither purely current-biased nor voltage-biased but rather nominal current-biased or ‚Äúmixed biased. ‚Äù Our objective is to experimentally investigate the consequences of ac shunting of the dc <b>SQUID</b> in FMS and the transformer's transfer characteristics. For different shunt values we measure {{the change in the}} <b>SQUID</b> bias current due to the ac shunt using another <b>SQUID</b> in the two-stage readout scheme, and simultaneously monitor the <b>SQUID</b> output voltage signal. We then explain our measurements by a simplified graphic analysis of <b>SQUID</b> intrinsic current-voltage (I‚ÄìV) characteristics. Since the total current flowing through the <b>SQUID</b> is not constant due to the shunting effect of the transformer, the amplitude of <b>SQUID</b> flux-to-voltage characteristics V(Œ¶) is less as compared to the direct readout scheme (DRS). Furthermore, we analyze and compare V(Œ¶) obtained by DRS and FMS. We show that in FMS, the transfer characteristics of the <b>SQUID</b> circuit also depend on the isolation capacitance and the dynamic resistance of the <b>SQUID...</b>|$|R

40|$|I {{present the}} design and {{analysis}} of a large bandwidth scanning Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (<b>SQUID)</b> microscope. Currently available <b>SQUID</b> microscopes are limited to detecting magnetic fields with frequencies less than 1 MHz. However, for observing nanosecond time scale phenomena such as logic operations in today's computer chips, <b>SQUID</b> microscopes with 1 GHz bandwidth and larger are required. The major limitation in <b>SQUID</b> microscope bandwidth is not the <b>SQUID</b> itself but the electronics and readout technique. To increase bandwidth, the fast transition of a hysteretic dc <b>SQUID</b> from the zero voltage state to the resistive state {{can be used as}} the detection element in a new <b>SQUID</b> readout technique, referred to as pulsed <b>SQUID</b> sampling. The technique involves pulsing the bias current to the dc <b>SQUID</b> while monitoring the voltage across it. As the pulse length shortens, the <b>SQUID</b> measures the applied external magnetic flux with shorter sampling time, which increases the bandwidth. Experimental tests of the technique have demonstrated the possibility of following signals with frequencies up to 1 GHz using a dc <b>SQUID</b> with Nb-AlOx-Nb Josephson junctions at around 4 K. Ringing in the pulse profile permitted the effective bandwidth of the sampling technique to be much greater than the nominal value suggested by the pulse length setting on the generator. I identify additional means of increasing bandwidth: redesigning the dc <b>SQUID,</b> implementing transmission line wiring, adding high speed superconducting circuits, etc. which should allow bandwidths to reach 40 GHz and higher. Towards creating a large bandwidth <b>SQUID</b> microscope, I also assembled and tested with collaborators a fully functional 4 K scanning <b>SQUID</b> microscope.
