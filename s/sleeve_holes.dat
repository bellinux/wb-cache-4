5000|$|A {{sleeveless}} T-shirt, {{also called}} a muscle shirt, {{is the same}} design as a T-shirt, but without sleeves. They are primarily worn by men, since some sleeveless T-shirts have large open <b>sleeve</b> <b>holes</b> that would expose the female breast under certain circumstances. They are often worn during athletic activities or as casual wear during warmer weather. They are colloquially known as shooter shirts in the southern United States. They were quite popular in the 1980s and were stereotypically associated with surfers and bodybuilders (hence the name [...] "muscle" [...] shirt) who often bore the logo of their gyms on these shirts. Muscle shirts/shooter shirts without logos are now more commonly worn as casual wear.|$|E

25|$|The {{woodpecker}} toy is a {{well known}} benchmark problem in contact dynamics. The toy consists of a pole, a <b>sleeve</b> with a <b>hole</b> that is slightly larger than {{the diameter of the}} pole, a spring and the woodpecker body. In operation, the woodpecker moves down the pole performing some kind of pitching motion, which is controlled by the sleeve. Figure 7 shows some snapshots of a simulation.|$|R
50|$|The Midnight is {{the name}} of the third EP {{released}} by electronica duo Lemon Jelly, according to the insert of Lemonjelly.ky, on July 17, 2000. It was limited to 1,000 10 in copies, the first 200 of which featured hand screen-printed sleeves. The tracks from the EP were later incorporated for more accessible listening into the critically acclaimed Lemonjelly.ky album. The cover had silver foil stamped on the inner <b>sleeve</b> and die-cut <b>holes</b> in the outer sleeve so when the record was pulled out of its sleeve, the stars twinkled in the night sky.|$|R
5000|$|Friction {{drilling}} uses a conical bit made of very heat-resistant material such as cemented carbide. This {{device is}} pressed against a target material with both high rotational speed and high pressure. That way, {{there is a}} high local production of heat which softens the object, making it plastic. The tool then [...] "sinks" [...] through the object, making a hole in it. Lubricants help prevent work-material from adhering to the bit. Unlike drilling, material that is flowed is not lost but it forms a <b>sleeve</b> around the <b>hole.</b> The length of that sleeve is up to 3 times the original thickness of the material. The presence of this metal lip around hole edges makes connections stronger.|$|R

According to the theory, the bullet then went through the Governor's jacket cuff about [...]5 cm from the end, the shirt's French cuff about 1.5 cm from the end, struck and shattered his radius leaving many dark fibres and small fragments of metal in the wound, and exited on the palm side of his wrist above the cuff. There was a hole about [...]5 cm from the end of the jacket <b>sleeve</b> and a <b>hole</b> through the back of the doubled French cuff but no exit hole on the palm side.|$|R
40|$|Au-Ge-Ni solder {{was chosen}} for brazing of the Cu-Cr-Zr alloy {{cylinder}} and a part with a cylindrical <b>hole</b> (<b>sleeve)</b> below 550 °C. The Au based solder was first sintered {{on the surface of}} the cylinder and then brazed to the inner surface of the sleeve. The effects of the heating process, the temperature and the holding time at the temperature on the microstructure of the sintered layer {{on the surface of the}} cylinder, the brazed interfacial microstructure, and the brazed shear strength between the cylinder and the sleeve were investigated by scanning electron microscope, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analysis, and tensile shear tests. By approach of side solder melt feeding and brazing under proper parameters, the voids and micro cracks due to a lack of enough solder melt feeding are greatly lessened and the brazed shear strength of 100 MPa is ensured even with large clearances around 0. 01 mm...|$|R
40|$|Differential near {{infrared}} sensors recently sparked a growing interest as a promising measuring modality for brain computer interfacing. In our study we present {{the design and}} characterization of novel, differential functional NIRS sensors, intended to record hemodynamic changes of the human motor cortex in the hand-area during motor imagery tasks. We report on the spatial characterization of a portable, multi-channel NIRS system with one module consisting of two central light emitting diodes (LED) (770 nm and 850 nm) and four symmetric pairs of radially aligned photodiodes (PD) resembling a plus symbol. The other sensor module features four similar, differential light paths crossing {{in the center of}} a star. Characterization was performed on a concentric, double beaker phantom, featuring a PBS/intralipid/blood mixture (97 / 1 / 2 %). In extension of previous work, the inner, oxygenated beaker was covered by neoprene <b>sleeves</b> with <b>holes</b> of various sizes, thus giving an estimate on the spatial limits of the NIRS sensor’s measurement volume. The star shaped sensor module formed a diffuse focus of approximately 3 cm in diameter at 1. 4 cm depth, whereas the plus shaped arrangement suggested a concentric ring of four separate regions of interest, overall larger than 6 cm. The systems measurement sensitivity could be improved by removing ambient light from the sensing photodiodes by optical filtering. Altogether, we conclude that both our novel fNIRS design as well as its electronics perform well in the double-layered oxygenation phantom and are thus suitable for in-vivo testing...|$|R
50|$|Lawrence {{then began}} work on a new Formula Junior car {{in which he would}} apply lessons learned from Keith Duckworth, whom he had met when picking up the engines for the DS101s. This led to his {{developing}} a unique suspension system for the car. To get more power out of the engine Lawrence drilled a hole directly down into the cylinder head and pressed a <b>sleeve</b> into the <b>hole,</b> creating a new intake port and blocking off the old at the same time. On the now high-mounted intake manifold he added a set of second-hand 45DC3 carburetors that drew cold air in over the driver's head. The VW transaxle was retained, but was mounted upside-down to drop the crankshaft below the height of the driveline. This car, christened the DS104, was taken to Silverstone for testing, where it was discovered that the crown-wheel was fitted to {{the wrong side of the}} pinion, resulting in the car having one forward gear and four reverse. The crown-wheel was subsequently moved. The DS104 debuted at Oulton Park, where it won on its first outing.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease causes {{significant}} morbidity in premature infants, but {{the role}} of dysfunction of the lower oesophageal sphincter (LOS) in this condition is unclear. METHODS: Oesophageal manometry was performed after gavage feeding in 13 healthy preterm neonates (postmenstrual age > or = 33 weeks) with a perfused <b>sleeve</b> with side <b>hole</b> assembly. Swallow related (both single and multiple) and transient LOS relaxations (TLOSRs) were identified and the characteristics of these events defined. Reflux was identified with manometric criteria (common cavity episodes). RESULTS: Five hundred and eleven relaxation of the LOS were observed, 55 % related to single swallows, 23 % related to multiple swallows, and 22 % TLOSRs. The time to maximal LOS relaxation was longer for TLOSRs than for single or multiple swallows (mean (SEM) 5. 0 (0. 3) s v 3. 0 (0. 1) s and 3. 3 (0. 1) s, p or = 33 weeks) the motor events associated with LOS relaxation {{were similar to those}} seen in healthy adults. TLOSRs may be an important mechanism of reflux in premature infants. T. I. Omari, K. Miki, G. Davidson, R. Fraser, R. Haslam, W. Goldsworthy, M. Bakewell, and J. Den...|$|R
40|$|Aim—The {{incidence}} of anorectal symptoms after radiotherapy (RTH) for localised pelvic malignant disease is unclear. In addition, {{the effects of}} pelvic irradiation on both anorectal motility and sensory function are poorly defined. A prospective study was therefore performed on 35 patients (55 - 82 years of age) with localised prostatic carcinoma before and {{four to six weeks}} after RTH to assess its effects on anorectal function.  Methods—Anorectal symptoms were assessed by questionnaire. Anorectal pressures at rest and in response to voluntary squeeze, rectal distension, and increases in intra-abdominal pressure were evaluated with perfused <b>sleeve</b> side <b>hole</b> manometry. Rectal sensation was tested during graded balloon distension. Rectal compliance was calculated by the pressure-volume relation obtained during the testing of rectal sensation. Ultrasound was used to determine anal sphincter structure and integrity.  Results—RTH had no effect on anal sphincter morphology. The frequency of defecation increased after RTH (7 (3 - 21) v 10 (3 - 56) bowel actions a week; p< 0. 01). After RTH, 16 patients had faecal urgency and eight faecal incontinence, compared with five and one respectively before RTH (p< 0. 01 for each). Basal and squeeze sleeve recorded pressures were reduced after RTH (54 (3) v 49 (3) mm Hg (p< 0. 05) and 111 (8) v 102 (8) mm Hg (p< 0. 01), before and after RTH respectively; means (SEM)). Rectal compliance was reduced after RTH (1. 2 v 1. 4 mm Hg/ml, p< 0. 05). After RTH, threshold volumes for perception of rectal distension were lower in the 16 patients who either experienced faecal urgency for the first time (13 patients) or reported worsening of this symptom (three patients) compared with the remaining patients (34 (4) v 48 (5) ml respectively, p< 0. 05).  Conclusion—Faecal incontinence (23 %) is a common problem four to six weeks after RTH for prostatic carcinoma and is associated with minor reductions in anal sphincter pressures. The high prevalence of faecal urgency in patients after RTH may be related to alterations in rectal perception of stool. ...|$|R
