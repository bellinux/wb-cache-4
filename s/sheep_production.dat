5|$|During the Roman {{occupation}} of the British Isles, a large wool processing factory was established in Winchester, England in about 50 AD. By 1000 AD, England and Spain were recognized as the twin centers of <b>sheep</b> <b>production</b> in the Western world. As the original breeders of the fine-wooled merino sheep that have historically dominated the wool trade, the Spanish gained great wealth. Wool money largely financed Spanish rulers and thus the voyages to the New World by conquistadors. The powerful Mesta (its full title was Honrado Concejo de la Mesta, the Honorable Council of the Mesta) was a corporation of sheep owners mostly drawn from Spain's wealthy merchants, Catholic clergy and nobility that controlled the merino flocks. By the 17th century, the Mesta held upwards of two million head of merino sheep.|$|E
5|$|In South America, {{especially}} in Patagonia, {{there is an}} active modern sheep industry. Sheep keeping was largely introduced through immigration to the continent by Spanish and British peoples, for whom sheep were a major industry during the period. South America has {{a large number of}} sheep, but the highest-producing nation (Brazil) kept only just over 15 million head in 2004, far fewer than most centers of sheep husbandry. The primary challenges to the sheep industry in South America are the phenomenal drop in wool prices in the late 20th century and the loss of habitat through logging and overgrazing. The most influential region internationally is that of Patagonia, which has been the first to rebound from the fall in wool prices. With few predators and almost no grazing competition (the only large native grazing mammal is the guanaco), the region is prime land for sheep raising. The most exceptional area of production is surrounding the La Plata river in the Pampas region. <b>Sheep</b> <b>production</b> in Patagonia peaked in 1952 at more than 21 million head, but has steadily fallen to fewer than ten today. Most operations focus on wool production for export from Merino and Corriedale sheep; the economic sustainability of wool flocks has fallen with the drop in prices, while the cattle industry continues to grow.|$|E

25|$|In 1645 the General Court ordered rural {{towns to}} {{increase}} <b>sheep</b> <b>production.</b> Sheep provided meat and especially wool {{for the local}} cloth industry, and reduced the expense of imports of British cloth.

25|$|Willow Bunch's {{agriculture}} {{generates the}} most profit from grain yields; {{as a result}} there is much less emphasis on livestock. Surveys from the 1930s show high poultry production, and moderate production of horses, cattle, sheep and swine. <b>Sheep</b> <b>production</b> saw a major drop from 1931 to 1936 and never rose again. The 1950s continued these pre-existing trends with low <b>sheep</b> <b>production,</b> high cattle production, and very high poultry production. The trend has since continued unabated, with far more land dedicated to crops than pasture fields. A 2011 census shows no farms dedicated to animals other than beef cattle ranches and animal combination farms. Furthermore, there are no farms dedicated to general apiculture. The small presence of livestock is characteristic of the farming division, however. While areas like Old Post, Waverly and Excel have many farms dedicated to cattle ranching/farming, these municipalities have few other farms dedicated to animal production.|$|E
25|$|The ancient parish of Skinnand was {{recorded}} as the smallest {{village in the}} Deanery of Longoboby in 1332.

500|$|Gradually, {{beginning}} in the 19th century, <b>sheep</b> <b>production</b> in the U.S. moved westward. Today, {{the vast majority of}} flocks reside on Western range lands. During this westward migration of the industry, competition between sheep (sometime called [...] "range maggots") and cattle operations grew more heated, eventually erupting into range wars. Other than simple competition for grazing and water rights, cattlemen believed that the secretions of the foot glands of sheep made cattle unwilling to graze on places where sheep had stepped. As <b>sheep</b> <b>production</b> centered on the U.S. western ranges, it became associated with other parts of Western culture, such as the rodeo. In modern America, a minor event in rodeos is mutton busting, in which children compete to see who can stay atop a sheep the longest before falling off. Another effect of the westward movement of sheep flocks in North America was the decline of wild species such as Bighorn sheep (O. canadesis). Most diseases of domestic sheep are transmittable to wild ovines, and such diseases, along with overgrazing and habitat loss, are named as primary factors in the plummeting numbers of wild sheep. <b>Sheep</b> <b>production</b> peaked in North America during the 1940s and 1950s at more than 55 million head. By 2013 the number of sheep in the United States was 10 percent what {{it had been in the}} early 1940s.|$|E
500|$|In the 21st century, {{the nations}} {{with the highest}} {{consumption}} of sheep meat are the Arab States of the Persian Gulf, New Zealand, Australia, Greece, Uruguay, the United Kingdom and Ireland. These countries eat 14–40lbs (3–18kg) of sheep meat per capita, per annum. Sheep meat is also popular in France, Africa (especially the Maghreb), the Caribbean, {{the rest of the}} Middle East, India, and parts of China. This often reflects a history of <b>sheep</b> <b>production.</b> In these countries in particular, dishes comprising alternative cuts and offal may be popular or traditional. Sheep testicles—called animelles or lamb fries—are considered a delicacy {{in many parts of the}} world. Perhaps the most unusual dish of sheep meat is the Scottish haggis, composed of various sheep innards cooked along with oatmeal and chopped onions inside its stomach. [...] In comparison, countries such as the U.S. consume only a pound or less (under 0.5kg), with Americans eating 50pounds (22kg) of pork and 65pounds (29kg) of beef. In addition, such countries rarely eat mutton, and may favor the more expensive cuts of lamb: mostly lamb chops and leg of lamb.|$|E
500|$|Sheep {{may fall}} victim to poisons, {{infectious}} diseases, and physical injuries. As a prey species, a sheep's system is adapted to hide the obvious signs of illness, to prevent being targeted by predators. However, some signs of ill health are obvious, with sick sheep eating little, vocalizing excessively, and being generally listless. Throughout history, {{much of the money}} and labor of sheep husbandry has aimed to prevent sheep ailments. Historically, shepherds often created remedies by experimentation on the farm. In some developed countries, including the United States, sheep lack the economic importance for drug companies to perform expensive clinical trials required to approve more than a relatively limited number of drugs for ovine use. However, extra-label drug use in <b>sheep</b> <b>production</b> is permitted in many jurisdictions, subject to certain restrictions. [...] In the US, for example, regulations governing extra-label drug use in animals are found in 21 CFR (Code of Federal Regulations) Part 530. [...] In the 20th and 21st centuries, a minority of sheep owners have turned to alternative treatments such as homeopathy, herbalism and even traditional Chinese medicine to treat sheep veterinary problems. Despite some favorable anecdotal evidence, the effectiveness of alternative veterinary medicine has been met with skepticism in scientific journals. The need for traditional anti-parasite drugs and antibiotics is widespread, and is the main impediment to certified organic farming with sheep.|$|E
