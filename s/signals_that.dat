5|$|Beginning in the 1960s, James E. Lloyd's {{investigation}} of female fireflies {{of the genus}} Photuris revealed they emit the same light <b>signals</b> <b>that</b> females of the genus Photinus use as a mating signal. Further research showed male fireflies from several different genera are attracted to these mimics, and are subsequently captured and eaten. Female signals are based on that received from the male, each female having a repertoire of signals matching the delay and duration of the female of the corresponding species. This mimicry may have evolved from non-mating <b>signals</b> <b>that</b> have become modified for predation.|$|E

5|$|As one of {{the nearest}} Sun-like stars, Epsilon Eridani has {{been the target of}} many {{attempts}} to search for planetary companions. Its chromospheric activity and variability mean that finding planets with the radial velocity method is difficult, because the stellar activity may create <b>signals</b> <b>that</b> mimic the presence of planets. Attempts at direct imaging of potential exoplanets have proven unsuccessful to date.|$|E
5|$|In the 1920s, Howe {{introduced}} her to representatives of women's political organizations, with which she became active, and watched and critiqued her speeches to these groups. The pair even developed a system of hand <b>signals</b> <b>that</b> Howe would use while she spoke to warn {{her if she was}} lapsing into a bad habit. He encouraged her to express herself in print as well, and acted for a time as her literary agent.|$|E
5|$|Not all co-evolved {{interactions}} between species involve conflict. Many cases of mutually beneficial interactions have evolved. For instance, an extreme cooperation exists between {{plants and the}} mycorrhizal fungi that grow on their roots and aid the plant in absorbing nutrients from the soil. This is a reciprocal relationship as the plants provide the fungi with sugars from photosynthesis. Here, the fungi actually grow inside plant cells, allowing them to exchange nutrients with their hosts, while sending <b>signals</b> <b>that</b> suppress the plant immune system.|$|E
50|$|Later systems {{modified}} the time base {{to include a}} second <b>signal</b> <b>that</b> periodically produced blips on the display, providing a clock <b>signal</b> <b>that</b> varied with the time base and thus {{did not need to}} be aligned. In UK terminology, these were known as strobes.|$|R

5|$|Other {{possibilities}} exist, as well. For example, immunohistochemistry usually utilizes an antibody {{to one or}} more proteins {{of interest}} that are conjugated to enzymes yielding either luminescent or chromogenic <b>signals</b> <b>that</b> can be compared between samples, allowing for localization information. Another applicable technique is cofractionation in sucrose (or other material) gradients using isopycnic centrifugation. While this technique does not prove colocalization of a compartment of known density and the protein of interest, it does increase the likelihood, and is more amenable to large-scale studies.|$|E
5|$|The CD 4+ cells {{through their}} T cell receptor-CD3 complex {{recognize}} the epitope-bound MHC II molecules {{on the surface}} of the antigen presenting cells, and get 'activated'. Upon this activation, these T cells proliferate and differentiate into Th2 cells. This makes them produce soluble chemical <b>signals</b> <b>that</b> promote their own survival. However, another important function that they carry out is the stimulation of B cell by establishing direct physical contact with them.|$|E
5|$|The heart {{receives}} nerve {{signals from}} the vagus nerve and from nerves arising from the sympathetic trunk. These nerves act to influence, but not control, the heart rate. Sympathetic nerves also influence the force of heart contraction. <b>Signals</b> <b>that</b> travel along these nerves arise from two paired cardiovascular centres in the medulla oblongata. The vagus nerve of the parasympathetic nervous system acts to decrease the heart rate, and nerves from the sympathetic trunk act to increase the heart rate. These nerves form a network of nerves that lies over the heart called the cardiac plexus.|$|E

5|$|The {{landline}} telephones in most residential {{homes are}} analogâ€”that is, the speaker's voice directly determines the signal's voltage. Although short-distance calls may be handled from end-to-end as analog signals, increasingly telephone service providers are transparently converting the signals to digital signals for transmission. The {{advantage of this}} is that digitized voice data can travel side-by-side with data from the Internet and can be perfectly reproduced in long distance communication (as opposed to analog <b>signals</b> <b>that</b> are inevitably impacted by noise).|$|E
5|$|When {{movement}} is required, one {{strategy is to}} minimise the motion signal, for example by avoiding waving limbs about and by choosing patterns that do not cause flicker when seen by the prey from straight ahead. Cuttlefish may be doing this with their active camouflage by choosing to form stripes {{at right angles to}} their front-back axis, minimising motion <b>signals</b> <b>that</b> would be given by occluding and displaying the pattern as they swim.|$|E
5|$|Coalitions between organisms of {{the same}} species have also evolved. An extreme case is the eusociality found in social insects, such as bees, {{termites}} and ants, where sterile insects feed and guard the small number of organisms in a colony that are able to reproduce. On an even smaller scale, the somatic cells that make up the body of an animal limit their reproduction so they can maintain a stable organism, which then supports a small number of the animal's germ cells to produce offspring. Here, somatic cells respond to specific <b>signals</b> <b>that</b> instruct them whether to grow, remain as they are, or die. If cells ignore these signals and multiply inappropriately, their uncontrolled growth causes cancer.|$|E

25|$|SD {{cards and}} host devices {{initially}} communicate through a synchronous one-bit interface, where the host device provides a clock <b>signal</b> <b>that</b> strobes single bits {{in and out}} of the SD card. The host device thereby sends 48-bit commands and receives responses. The card can <b>signal</b> <b>that</b> a response will be delayed, but the host device can abort the dialogue.|$|R
5|$|If a P. schultzi female is mature, a male P. schultzi {{will try}} to copulate with her, or cohabit with a subadult female and copulate while she is moulting. They usually mate on a web or on a {{dragline}} made by the female, and P. schultzi typically copulates for about 100seconds, while others in the genus can take several minutes or even several hours. Females try to kill and eat their mates during or after copulation, and subadult females mimic adult females to attract males as prey. Contests between Portia females are violent, and embraces in P. schultzi typically take 20 to 60seconds. Sometimes, one female knocks the other {{on her back and}} the other may be killed and eaten if she does not right herself quickly and run way. When hunting, P. schultzi mature females emit olfactory <b>signals</b> <b>that</b> reduce the risk that any other females, males, or juveniles of the same species may contend for the same prey.|$|E
5|$|In Bauer's view, the {{presence}} {{at one of}} the meetings of Gerhard Clages of the SS <b>signals</b> <b>that</b> Himmler was focusing on secret peace talks. Brand and Grosz arrived in Istanbul just two months before the attempted assassination of Adolf Hitler on 20 July 1944. Himmler knew that attempts might be made on Hitler's life, though not where and when. It is possible that he wanted to broker for peace in case Hitler did not survive, using low-level agents for plausible deniability, and if Hitler did survive, Bauer argues, Himmler could offer him a peace deal with the West that excluded the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|Newly {{discovered}} planets, particularly {{ones that}} are potentially habitable, have enabled SETI and METI programs to refocus projects for communication with extraterrestrial intelligence. In 2009 A Message From Earth (AMFE) was sent toward the Gliese 581 planetary system, which contains two potentially habitable planets, the confirmed Gliese 581d and the more habitable but unconfirmed Gliese 581g. In the SETILive project, which began in 2012, human volunteers analyze data from the Allen Telescope Array to search for possible alien <b>signals</b> <b>that</b> computers might miss because of terrestrial radio interference. The data for the study is obtained by observing Kepler target stars with the radio telescope.|$|E
40|$|The present {{invention}} {{provides a}} system and method for transmitting an ultrawideband (UWB) <b>signal</b> <b>that</b> {{is composed of}} an orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) based <b>signal</b> <b>that</b> is transmitted in an underlay manner and an impulse radio based <b>signal</b> <b>that</b> is transmitted in an overlay manner. The system and method are effective in determining an interference temperature for each of multiple carriers within the UWB signal and classifying {{each one of the}} multiple carriers of the channel as being an interfered carrier or a non-interfered carrier based on the interference temperature for each one of multiple carriers. The desired signal is then transmitted on the interfered carriers at a <b>signal</b> power <b>that</b> is not greater than the power limit of the underlay UWB policy and on the non-interfered carriers at a <b>signal</b> power <b>that</b> is greater than the power limit of the underlay UWB policy...|$|R

5|$|Over the {{following}} year, Japan also proceeded with its expansion plans. The Invasion of French Indochina on 22 September 1940 (which by then {{was controlled by}} the collaborating government of Vichy France), and Japan's ongoing bloody conflict with China, put a severe strain on American-Japanese relations. On 26 July 1940, the United States had passed the Export Control Act, cutting oil, iron and steel exports to Japan. This containment policy was Washington's warning to Japan that any further military expansion would result in further sanctions. However, such US moves were interpreted by Japan's militaristic leaders as <b>signals</b> <b>that</b> they needed to take radical measures to improve the Empire's situation, thereby driving Japan closer to Germany.|$|E
5|$|Prior to 2007, the Staten Island Railway used Baltimore & Ohio Railroad style color {{position}} light <b>signals</b> <b>that</b> dated {{back to when}} it was a B line. In 2007, a $72 million project to replace the old signal system was completed. The system was replaced with an FRA-compliant 100Hz, track circuit based, Automatic Train Control (ATC) signal system. As part of the project, forty R44 subway cars and four locomotives were modified with on board cab signaling equipment for ATC bi-directional movement. A new rail control center and back-up control center was constructed as part of this contract.|$|E
5|$|Synapses {{are the key}} {{functional}} elements of the brain. The essential function of the brain is cell-to-cell communication, and synapses are the points at which communication occurs. The human brain has been estimated to contain approximately 100 trillion synapses; even the brain of a fruit fly contains several million. The functions of these synapses are very diverse: some are excitatory (exciting the target cell); others are inhibitory; others work by activating second messenger systems that change the internal chemistry of their target cells in complex ways. A large number of synapses are dynamically modifiable; that is, {{they are capable of}} changing strength {{in a way that is}} controlled by the patterns of <b>signals</b> <b>that</b> pass through them. It is widely believed that activity-dependent modification of synapses is the brain's primary mechanism for learning and memory.|$|E
