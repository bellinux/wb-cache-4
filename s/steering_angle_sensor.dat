ABS is an existing system that prevents the vehicle's wheels from locking up under braking, especially in slippery road conditions. For the ABS to work, the system relies on the computed input from a <b>steering</b> <b>angle</b> <b>sensor</b> to monitor the driver's steering direction, the yaw sensor to detect the momentum of which the wheels are steering (yaw rate), and a lateral acceleration (g-force) sensor to signal the changes in speed. At the same time, the TCS will prevent wheel slip during acceleration while the side-slip control stabilizes cornering when the rear or front wheels slip sideways (during oversteer and understeer).|$|E

The developed algorithm successfully estimates the offset to an accuracy {{on the order of}} degrees, and the uncertainty of the estimate is ultimately determined by the backlash in the steering system, which may range up to approximately 15 degrees or more depending on service standards. The investigation also shows that two general approaches to estimate the <b>steering</b> wheel <b>angle</b> in real-time can produce unbiased estimates only when the vehicle is cornering at low speeds...|$|R
40|$|A {{stationary}} or temporary offset in {{the steering}} system {{of a vehicle}} can result in functions, relying on the <b>steering</b> wheel <b>angle,</b> performing poorly. Due to {{the wide range of}} different vehicle configurations at Scania CV, all sensors with relevant information regarding vehicle direction are not available on all vehicles. By using a statistical approach, including common sensors installed on the vehicle, a conceptual algorithm calibrating the <b>Steering</b> Wheel <b>Angle</b> <b>Sensor</b> offset in real- time has been developed. The algorithm is simple and relies on the assumption that a vehicle is driving straight ahead most of the time above a certain minimum vehicle speed, thus the most frequent <b>steering</b> wheel <b>angle</b> is the straight ahead angle. The algorithm is only active above the certain minimum vehicle speed and consists of two moving windows comprising <b>steering</b> wheel <b>angle</b> samples in which the calculations are performed. The results show that the algorithm is able to detect offsets with a short calibration time. Storage of samples is required but no vehicle specific parameters are needed. ...|$|R

On the other hand two optical sensing elements are used in addition. Hence, we gain fault tolerance by redundancy and, concurrently, by diversity because of the different physical sensing principle.

25|$|Modern {{electronic}} stability {{control systems}} are an {{evolution of the}} ABS concept. Here, {{a minimum of two}} additional sensors are added to help the system work: these are a <b>steering</b> wheel <b>angle</b> <b>sensor,</b> and a gyroscopic sensor. The theory of operation is simple: when the gyroscopic sensor detects that the direction taken by the car does not coincide with what the steering wheel sensor reports, the ESC software will brake the necessary individual wheel(s) (up to three with the most sophisticated systems), so that the vehicle goes the way the driver intends. The steering wheel sensor also helps in the operation of Cornering Brake Control (CBC), since this will tell the ABS that wheels {{on the inside of the}} curve should brake more than wheels on the outside, and by how much.|$|R
40|$|Many Advanced Driver Assistance Systems rely on an {{accurate}} self-localization. This is usually provided by Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) along with on-board sensors, such as inertial sensors, speed sensors, wheel-tick <b>sensors</b> and <b>steering</b> wheel <b>angle</b> <b>sensors.</b> However, this pproach suffers from incremental error growth when long GNSS outages occur. Additionally, {{it is widely}} accepted that GNSS has a poor performance in urban-like environments due to satellite line-of-sight blockage, signal attenuation and multipath propagation. We propose a solution in which the error associated to GNSS-based positioning is contained by using surrounding road infrastructure objects (RIO) that are detected with a radar sensor. Since the position of these objects is a-priori not known, we suggest to share their estimated location among the vehicles using vehicle-to-vehicle communication and, in this way, improve their over-all position accuracy over time. In this way, vehicles entering a GNSS-denied area are able to maintain their position accuracy, achieving even better results as if GNSS was available in the areaof interest...|$|R

In order to solve this problem we derive dynamical models for the ego vehicle, the road and the leading vehicles. The main difference to existing approaches is that we make use of a new dynamic model for the road.

40|$|This study {{proposes a}} method for {{real-time}} identification of a driver model. The proposed method requires only the yaw rate sensor, the <b>steering</b> <b>angle</b> <b>sensor,</b> and velocity sensors that are usually installed in the production car. The identification algorithm involves {{the division of the}} recorded data, prefiltering of the divided data, estimation of the driver's desired response, and identification. The prefilter extracts the driver's involuntary response that can be modelled in a simple form. The ideal car response that the driver attempts to track is estimated from the recorded data, and this response is provided to the identification algorithm of the feedback driver model for error tracking. These newly developed methods enable real-time identification under actual driving conditions. The driving simulator experiments and the actual driving tests were performed, and the proposed method was validated. The results show that the time history of the variation in the driver's characteristics can be realised in real time using the proposed method. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Mercedes-Benz has {{recently}} added a crosswind stabilization function to the Active Body Control (ABC) suspension for the 2009 S-Class. For this purpose the ABC uses the yaw rate, lateral acceleration, <b>steering</b> <b>angle</b> and velocity <b>sensors</b> of the Electronic Stability Program ESP to vary the wheel load distribution via the ABC spring struts, {{depending on the}} direction and intensity of the crosswind. This function has to distinguish between vehicle reactions caused by crosswind, by driver interaction, and by road unevenness. The effects of the crosswinds can be compensated in this way, or reduced to a minimum {{in the case of}} strong gusts. For developing this function Mercedes Benz used the test case generator TestWeaver to generate thousands of different driving and crosswind scenarios. The scenarios have been executed using a co-simulation of: (i) a dynamic vehicle model (based on the inhouse tool CASCaDE), (ii) a road and crosswind model implemented in C and (iii) a MathWorks/Simulink model of the crosswind stabilization function. This simulation-based approach helped considerably to validate and iteratively improve the safeguarding algorithms of the stabilization function through all design phases...|$|R

50|$|The first {{generation}} 4Matic system was originally a complex electronically controlled system with automatically engaging four-wheel drive (4WD), the system employs locking central and rear differentials {{to provide additional}} traction in slippery conditions. The centre differential, {{also known as the}} transfer case, contains two clutches. Each hydraulically enabled clutch is controlled separately to allow for three modes of operation: 2WD (mode 0) where 100% of available torque is available to the rear axle while the front axle is disconnected, and two 4WD modes which allow for 35/65 front/rear axle torque split (mode 1) or 50/50 front/rear axle torque split (mode 2). The rear differential lock, previously known as ASD on Mercedes-Benz models, can also be locked (mode 3) if rear wheel slip is still present when the transfer case 50/50 4WD mode 2 is engaged. Due to safety and stability concerns there is no front differential lock. The 4Matic system uses inputs from the three channel ABS system and a <b>steering</b> wheel <b>angle</b> <b>sensor</b> to decide when to intervene. 4WD is disengaged automatically if the ABS service brakes are applied. Engine throttle control is not inherent in the W124 system. Two W124 variants of the 4Matic system were produced: the first system (1986-1991) used a mechanical pressure test lever to disable the system hydraulically while the second system variant (1992/1993) used an electrical test switch to break power to the system. The later system variant when in test mode allows for continued operation of the rear shock self-levelling system (SLS) when installed. Initially plagued with reliability factors, the multi-plate clutch central differentials were subject to failure; it was discontinued in 1993.|$|R
40|$|Wheel shimmy and wobble {{are well}} known dynamic {{phenomena}} at automobiles, aeroplanes and motorcycles. This eigenmode excites in particular oscillations of the wheel about the steering axis, {{and it is no}} surprise, that unstable bicycle wobble is perceived unpleasant or may be dangerous, if not controlled by the rider in time. Basic research on wobble at motorcycles within the last decades has revealed a better understand-ing of reasons for the sudden onset of wobble, and the complex relations between parameters affecting wobble have been identified. These fundamental findings have been transferred to bicy-cles. As mass balances and inertial properties, rider influence and lateral compliances of tyre and frame do differ at bicycle and motorcycle, approved models to represent wobble at motorcycles have to prove themselves, when applied at bicycles. For that purpose numeric results are compared with measurements at test runs, and parametric influences on the stability of the wobble mode at bicycles have been evolved.

Among various sensors, vehicle dynamic sensors can measure the vehicle motions such as speed and rotational angular speed for dead reckoning, {{which can be}} applied to develop a land vehicle positioning system to overcome the weaknesses of the GNSS technique. In this paper, three land vehicle positioning algorithms that integrate GNSS with vehicle dynamic sensors including a wheel speed sensor (WSS), a yaw rate sensor (YRS), and a <b>steering</b> <b>angle</b> <b>sensor</b> (SAS) are implemented, and then a performance evaluation was conducted during GNSS outages. Using a loosely coupled strategy, three integration algorithms are designed, namely, GNSS/WSS, GNSS/WSS/YRS, and GNSS/WSS/YRS/SAS. The performance of the three types of integration algorithm is evaluated based on two data sets. The results indicate that both the GNSS/WSS/YRS integration and the GNSS/WSS/YRS/SAS integration could estimate the horizontal position with meter-level accuracy during 30 -second GNSS outages. However, the GNSS/WSS integration would provide an unstable navigation solution during GNSS outages due to the accuracy limitation of the computed yaw rate using WSS...|$|E

40|$|In {{the highly}} {{competitive}} automotive industry, OEM and tier-I suppliers face {{the problem of}} determining costs and creating accurate and rapid schedules for current and future product developments. Successful companies in this industry {{are those that are}} able to forecast and meet important deadlines, satisfy performance requirements and reduce costs to keep development within budget. But frequently one or two factors are achieved {{at the expense of the}} others. Sometimes, for example, suppliers are able to cut costs, but only at the expense of quality. Or they can increase quality at expense of costs. Both scenarios are of concern, especially when competitors are attempting to capture market share. Engineers and program managers require powerful techniques to have better estimates of completion time versus expenditures. Unfortunately, though, there are not yet such tools available that are capable of incorporating both dimensions of product quality and cost. Moreover, it would be desirable to incorporate product performance with those two dimensions in order to obtain a broad perspective of the entire design. The main goal of this thesis is the investigation, evaluation and application of the research reported in the Ph.

40|$|The {{task was}} to {{synthesise}} an adjustable hydraulic system structure, the mathematical model of which takes into account its inherent nonlinearity. Its solution suggests using a successive computer simulations starting with a structure of the linearized stable hydraulic system, which is then complicated by including the essentially non-linear elements. The hydraulic system thus obtained {{may be unable to}} meet the Lyapunov stability criterion and be unstable. This can be eliminated through correcting elements. Control of correction results is provided according to the form of transition processes due to stepwise variation of the control signal. Computer simulation of a throttle-controlled electrohydraulic servo drive with the rotary output element illustrates the proposed method application. A constant pressure power source provides fluid feed for the drive under pressure. For drive simulation the following models were involved: the linear model, the model taking into consideration a non-linearity of the flow-dynamic characteristics of a spool-type valve, and the non-linear models that take into account the dry friction in the spool-type valve, the backlash in the <b>steering</b> <b>angle</b> <b>sensor</b> of the motor shaft.

40|$|Both <b>steering</b> <b>angle</b> and {{sideslip}} angle are important states for vehicle handling and stability control. Instead of directly measuring these angles, indirect estimation {{of these states}} will provide a cost-effective way {{for the implementation of}} vehicle control systems. In the past, model-based methods have been proposed to estimate the {{sideslip angle}} with the measured <b>steering</b> <b>angle.</b> In this paper, a novel observer design is presented for simultaneous estimation of vehicle <b>steering</b> <b>angle</b> and sideslip angle so that the estimation of sideslip angle does not require the measurement of <b>steering</b> <b>angle</b> and the estimate of <b>steering</b> <b>angle</b> can also be used for other purposes, such as automatic steering control, steering system fault diagnosis, and driving performance monitoring. To enable this observer design, the Takagi–Sugeno (T–S) fuzzy modeling technique is applied to represent the vehicle lateral dynamics model with nonlinear Dugoff tyre model and time-varying vehicle speed. A T-S observer is then designed to simultaneously estimate the <b>steering</b> <b>angle</b> and sideslip angle with the measurements of yaw rate and vehicle speed, and is designed to be robust against parameter uncertainties and unknown inputs. The conditions for designing such an observer are derived in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Experimental results are used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
