40|$|The article {{deals with}} the basic {{principles}} of organization and functioning of the institute of the public authorities in Germany. The possibility of the implementation of these principles in Ukraine has been identified. Aspects that include the «public servant» concept have been considered and those categories, which are included into the «public servant» position in similar German institutions, have been described. The procedure of public servants’, appointing to the relevant categories of posts and the legislation on the political impartiality of public servants, has been analyzed. Some disciplinary rules of law, which regulate the consequences that can lead to a particular offense of public servants, have been pointed out. These special public-legal relations both at the federal and state levels are ruled by German laws on public servants. Federal law on public servants (Bundesbeamtengesetz) contains detailed description on the procedure of provision of services by public servants at the federal level. The relevant state laws exists for public servants who are employed in the public service at the state level, for example, in the city or municipality. According to the German state structure, employers of public servants are State, land and municipality. It should be noted that from April, 1 st 2009 the significant changes were made to state laws on public servants and these changes are based on the law on the <b>status</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>servant</b> (Beamtenstatusgesetz). The previous law on the status of public servants (Beamtenrechtsrahmengesetz) was canceled. So, public servants are persons, which perform public-legal functions in the public sphere at the federal, state and municipal levels. In Germany public servant is a person who is in special official relations with the state. These relations are characterized by the performance of public-legal functions. Public servant’s relations with the State (land) are characterized by the loyalty and the trust from the Government’s side. The public servant has special public-legal powers, based on the relevant principles of public administration. All these aspects have been investigated in comparison with the relevant rules of Ukrainian law «On Public Service». The importance of the unification of basic approaches and principles of development, which are described in the law «On Public Service», with {{the basic principles of}} service in local authorities has been proved. Taking into consideration the experience of functioning of German public service institute, it will allow forming an integral institute of public service in Ukraine...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} is to {{describe}} {{different aspects of the}} teaching profession in the French educational system. At the same time, we specify the ongoing substantial reform of the educational system that is, since 2013, changing certain parts of this profession. For this purpose, we focus firstly on the historical development during which the roots and principles of this profession were forged, since the times of the Gauls {{until the end of the}} 20 th century. Moreover, we describe the current state of the French educational system in which many forms of the teaching profession appear. The following chapter concentrates on teacher education and the development of the institution that was established for that purpose, from the IUFM up to the current ESPE. Furthermore, we mention certain rights that emanate from the profession and the <b>status</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>servants.</b> Also, we try to depict how teachers can move to a different school. Finally, the last chapter deals with some chosen current issues that are affecting the teaching profession.

5000|$|Within {{the space}} of a few weeks, three reforms were introduced, all of which helped to spark off a brewing crisis. None of these {{projects}} had involved negotiations or discussions with any representatives of the academic community. Education Minister Xavier Darcos, who was already caught in an impasse following the failed introduction of a reform for secondary schools (ultimately shelved), presented a plan in October that would affect the training of primary and secondary school teachers. Until that point, teachers had enjoyed the <b>status</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>servants.</b> They first had to successfully pass a national exam with entry quotas (numerus clauses), after which they spent a year in a university teacher training institute (Institut Universitaire de Formation des Maîtres IUFM) with numerous work placements, and finally became fully qualified teachers. There were two such exams: the CAPES (following a bachelor's degree, or more often a Master's) and the Agrégation, following a master's degree and an additional preparatory year. Those who passed the Agrégation had a direct route into Higher Education teaching. Most university lecturers, especially in humanities departments, are former Agrégés who have been awarded a doctorate. Following the reform, they would have to take a master's degree in theory of education (Master Enseignement). Preparation for the exam would then become part of the second year's syllabus, during which there would also be work placements, in order for teachers to access teaching posts immediately after qualifying. However, the technical implementation of this plan has proved to be extremely complex, and opponents have stressed the fact that there would be many more candidates than work placements on offer. Moreover, the training they would receive in their original area of interest would suffer, since the hours of educational theory and exam preparation would leave less time available time for the coursework for the master's degree. Union members denounced the draft law as an attack against teachers' status as <b>public</b> <b>servants</b> and stated that Graduate students who failed the numerus clausus would then become [...] "crowds of precariously employed teachers without any status". The academic community had already begun fighting this proposal, which they saw as threatening the <b>status</b> <b>of</b> French teachers. Meanwhile, Valérie Pécresse unveiled her own proposals.|$|R
40|$|Prosodic {{analysis}} of Topicalization Markers (TMs) in French 1. Introduction. Topicalization Markers (TMs) in French, like {{en ce qui concerne}} (1), lexically {{indicate that the}} element following the TM has to be interpreted as the topic or the frame of the utterance, in contrast with clitic left dislocation (2), where the dislocated constituent is co-referent with the pronoun il and where the topic marking is implicit. (1) Difficile de s'y retrouver, tant les divers statuts des fonctionnaires sont nombreux. Mais en ce qui concerne les fonctionnaires "d'état", ils devraient être tous alignés sur le statut des militaires. [So numerous are the different <b>statuses</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>servants</b> {{that it is difficult to}} make sense out of them all. As far as <b>public</b> <b>servants</b> working for state government are concerned, however, they should be treated as soldiers are. ] (2) - Et après, on est tous les deux chez notre père. Mon père, il va être moins seul en fait et il y aura toujours quelqu'un chez lui. [And afterwards, we both stay with our father. My father, he's going to be less lonely and there'll always be someone with him. ] In contrast with most studies about TMs in French, which are limited to their syntactic and discourse properties in written (mostly formal) language (Choi-Jonin 2003 – Fløttum 1999, 2003 – Lagae 2003, 2007, 2011 – Porhiel 2004, 2005), we investigate the interaction between discourse and prosody in spontaneous speech (in several corpora of oral French, a. o. C-Prom, ESLO and Rhapsodie). The general claim of this paper is that, contrary to what is put forward in Martin (2009 : 163), left dislocation constructions with and without TM are marked by a strong and obligatory prosodic boundary. 2. Background. Our prosodic analysis is based on Mertens' (2006) predictive model of French unmarked default intonation, which is based on syntactic structure and which specifies the prosodic boundary of the stressed syllable of each intonation group (IG). Mertens (2006) states that peripheral constituents like clitic left dislocations are followed by a major boundary. We will show that TMs indeed are separated from its verbal kernel by a major boundary. 3. Details. We will first present the results of our {{analysis of}} the pitch contour of the stressed syllable in different types of constructions involving a left detached constituent, a. o. left dislocation with TM (ex. 1), clitic left dislocation (ex. 2), left detached spatio-temporal constituents (ex. 3) and universe-of-discourse introducers (4) (referring to mental spaces - Fauconnier 1994). (3) En Espagne, le gouvernement s'attaque à la fraude fiscale. [In Spain, the government is dealing with fraud. ] (4) Dans le domaine de l'économie, il était jusqu'à présent difficile de mettre d'accord les pays très libéraux. In economic policy, it has so far been very difficult to reconcile the ultra-liberal countries. ] We will show that all these left detached constituents are separated from the verbal kernel by an important pitch interval, rather than by a clear-cut pause. The stressed syllable of the left detached constituent reaches a high level tone. References: Choi-Jonin, I. 2003. Ordre syntaxique et ordre référentiel: emplois de la locution prépositive Quant à.

40|$|The {{management}} <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>servants</b> {{has assumed}} increasing importance as public service organizations {{are confronted with}} {{a rise in the}} demand for high quality services in the context of limited resources. Much of the research on the treatment <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>servants</b> has focused on the notion <b>of</b> <b>public</b> service motivation and whether the motives <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>servants</b> differ from those of private sector employees. However, the organization’s need to harness positive employee attitudes and behaviors as a means of coping with the pressures on public service delivery encourages a focus on the factors influencing these attitudes and behaviors within the sector. We address this issue by drawing upon a psychological contract framework, which captures employee perceptions of the reciprocal exchange between him/her and his/her employer. This study investigates the relationship between the psychological contract and two outcomes: organizational commitment and organizational citizenship behavior using survey responses from five thousand seven hundred and nine employees. The results support the underlying proposition that public sector employees reciprocate the treatment they receive from their employer. Consequently, we argue that the psychological contract framework has some value in enhancing our understanding <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>servant</b> attitudes and behavior. The implications of our findings for the management <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>servants</b> are discussed. We suggest that future research integrate individual predispositions and situational factors to provide a more comprehensive understanding <b>of</b> <b>public</b> servants’ attitudes and behavior...|$|R

40|$|The article {{analyzes}} {{ethical aspects}} of the personality <b>of</b> a <b>public</b> <b>servant.</b> Such  concepts as, «professional honor», «professional dignity», «professional justice», «professional responsibility» are disclosed. The role of these concepts in public servants’ professional activities is defermined. It is stated that professional dignity <b>of</b> the <b>public</b> <b>servant</b> is closely connected with his position in the team, his personal merit and honor <b>public</b> <b>servant.</b> The matter is that a <b>public</b> <b>servant</b> is a representative a particular team, and the entire public service. The {{attention is focused on}} the fact that the higher developed feeling of personal and official dignity <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>servants,</b> the more he values his professional honor, the more significant social value he has to society. As a result, professional honor and professional dignity, complement each other, help to maintain a certain, fairly high level <b>of</b> a <b>public</b> <b>servant’s</b> morality. It was found that such concepts as «professional honor», «professional dignity», «professional justice», «professional responsibility» were brought up before and are brought up now in a large stable structures and organizations of the world. In developed countries, such as France, Germany, Japan, England – the honor and responsibility <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>servant</b> are essential professional qualities, which largely determine style of activities and influence decision-making process. In our country, nowadays, the education <b>of</b> a <b>public</b> <b>servant</b> is missed, therefore we will not be able in the future to count on the loyalty of civil servants to their job.
