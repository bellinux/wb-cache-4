50|$|Universal motors are series wound. <b>Shunt</b> <b>winding</b> {{was used}} experimentally, {{in the late}} 19th century, but was {{impractical}} owing to problems with commutation. Various schemes of embedded resistance, inductance and antiphase cross-coupling were attempted to reduce this. Universal motors, including shunt wound, were favoured as AC motors at this time as they were self-starting. When self-starting induction motors and automatic starters became available, these replaced the larger universal motors (above 1 hp) and the shunt wound.|$|E
2500|$|Analog meter {{movements}} are inherently more fragile physically and electrically than digital meters. Many analog multimeters feature a range switch position marked [...] "off" [...] {{to protect the}} meter movement during transportation which places placing a low resistance across the meter movement, resulting in dynamic braking. Meter movements as separate components may be protected {{in the same manner}} by connecting a shorting or jumper wire between the terminals when not in use. Meters which feature a <b>shunt</b> across the <b>winding</b> such as an ammeter may not require further resistance to arrest uncontrolled movements of the meter needle because of the low resistance of the shunt.|$|R

Research methods: With the help of simulation and analytical methods of calculation techniques developed a simulation model, identified the advantages of using a modernized impulse control scheme. The obtained results: The modernized scheme of series excitation DC current motor pulse control is designed. For the proposed and existing pulse regulation schemes the models are developed; they help to investigate the electromechanical processes of electric drive in these schemes and to perform the comparative analysis. The results of the modernized DC motor speed impulse control scheme investigation in the acceleration mode, overrun and electro-dynamic braking are given. Scientific novelty: Developed advanced pulse regulating sequential excitation DC motor scheme. For existing and proposed schemes impulse regulation developed models that allow study of electromechanical processes in electric drive for existing and proposed impulse control schemes. The practical significance: It is shown that the addition of a <b>shunt</b> field <b>winding</b> diode to pulsed regulator scheme reducing the rate of current decay in the winding. It is determined that the proposed upgrade allows to use electro-dynamic braking mode at the motor self-excitation. The proposed scheme design avoids the use of additional independent power sources and simplify the technical implementation and reduce costs...|$|R
40|$|The flux {{modulation}} scheme (FMS) {{is the standard}} readout technique of dc SQUIDs, where a step-up transformer links the SQUID to the preamplifier. The transformer's primary <b>winding</b> <b>shunts</b> the SQUID via a large capacitor while the secondary winding connects it to the preamplifier. A modulation flux having a frequency of typically 100 [*]kHz generates an ac voltage across the SQUID, stepped up by the transformer. The SQUID with FMS is customarily operated in the current bias mode, because a constant dc bias current flows only through the SQUID due to the capacitor isolation. With FMS, however, the transformer ac shunts the SQUID so that in reality the operating mode is neither purely current-biased nor voltage-biased but rather nominal current-biased or “mixed biased. ” Our objective is to experimentally investigate the consequences of ac shunting of the dc SQUID in FMS and the transformer's transfer characteristics. For different shunt values we measure {{the change in the}} SQUID bias current due to the ac shunt using another SQUID in the two-stage readout scheme, and simultaneously monitor the SQUID output voltage signal. We then explain our measurements by a simplified graphic analysis of SQUID intrinsic current-voltage (I–V) characteristics. Since the total current flowing through the SQUID is not constant due to the shunting effect of the transformer, the amplitude of SQUID flux-to-voltage characteristics V(Φ) is less as compared to the direct readout scheme (DRS). Furthermore, we analyze and compare V(Φ) obtained by DRS and FMS. We show that in FMS, the transfer characteristics of the SQUID circuit also depend on the isolation capacitance and the dynamic resistance of the SQUID...|$|R
