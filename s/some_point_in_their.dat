5|$|The {{crystallization}} of uric acid, often {{related to}} relatively high {{levels in the}} blood, is the underlying cause of gout. This can occur because of diet, genetic predisposition, or underexcretion of urate, the salts of uric acid. Underexcretion of uric acid by the kidney is {{the primary cause of}} hyperuricemia in about 90% of cases, while overproduction is the cause in less than 10%. About 10% of people with hyperuricemia develop gout at <b>some</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> lifetimes. The risk, however, varies depending on the degree of hyperuricemia. When levels are between 415 and 530μmol/l (7 and 8.9mg/dl), the risk is 0.5% per year, while in those with a level greater than 535μmol/l (9mg/dL), the risk is 4.5% per year.|$|E
5|$|The exarchs of Africa were {{effectively}} Governor-Generals {{with both}} {{civilian and military}} powers. Their seat of power was Carthage. Historians of the late 19th and early 20th centuries ascribed much significance to this appointment, even suggesting it would require prominent ties of Heraclius the Elder to Africa or the wider Western Roman Empire. Later historians pointed, however, that this appointment {{was part of a}} wider pattern. In the 6th century, several prominent Byzantine military commanders had started their careers in the eastern regions of the Empire, often in the vicinity of Upper Mesopotamia. Then they were transferred to North Africa at <b>some</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> respective careers.

However, this is not indicative of larger whales' ability to retain heat better, as the thickness of a whale's blubber does not significantly affect heat loss. More indicative of a whale's ability to retain heat is the water and lipid concentration in blubber, as water reduces heat-retaining capacities, and lipid increases them.|$|R

40|$|Low {{back pain}} {{is a common}} {{musculoskeletal}} disorder affecting 80 % of people at <b>some</b> <b>points</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> lives. The term lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) refers to the anatomic narrowing of the spinal canal in the anterior-posterior axis [1]. Neurogenic claudication (NC) is a common symptom of LSS, which is a term proposed by Dejerine [2] in 1911 and further refined by von Gelderen [3] in 1948. Symptoms of NC are described as pain, paraesthesia or cramping of one or both legs, brought on when walk-ing and relieved in sitting [4, 5]. To measure NC, the Neurogenic Claudication Outcome Score (NCOS) was developed by Weiner and Fraser [6]. As suggested it is a simple, concise, self-administered outcome questionnaire and specifically tailored to address functionality in patients with neurogenic claudication [7]. Several studies used the NCOS as an outcome measure of functionality in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis [7 - 11]. In fact the NCOS is based on and represents an expansion of th...|$|R
5|$|At <b>some</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> history, {{not clearly}} documented, horses bred {{in the western}} regions {{crossbred}} with horses that originated south of the Gulf of Finland. This made the western Finnish horse type larger and better suited to farming and forestry work. The characteristics of the original western Finnish type prevailed, however, even though influenced by outside blood and traces of outside influence could be detected for a long time. Later, this mixed type was further crossbred with larger horses from Central Europe during the Middle Ages. Foreign horses were also brought to Finland during military campaigns, and additional animals were imported to manor houses for driving. The crossbreed offspring of Central European and Finnish horses were larger than their Finnish parents, and even more suited for agricultural work.|$|E
5|$|Cavaliers can notably {{suffer from}} mitral valve disease, {{which leads to}} heart failure. This appears in many Cavaliers at <b>some</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> lives and {{is the most common}} cause of death. Some serious genetic health problems, {{including}} early-onset mitral valve disease (MVD), the potentially severely painful syringomyelia (SM), hip dysplasia, luxating patellas, and certain vision and hearing disorders are health problems for this breed. As today's Cavaliers all descend from only six dogs, any inheritable disease present in at least one of the original founding dogs can be passed on to a significant proportion of future generations. This is known as the founder effect and is the likely cause of the prevalence of MVD in the breed. The health problems shared with this breed include mitral valve disease, luxating patella, and hereditary eye issues such as cataracts and retinal dysplasia.|$|E
5|$|However, Psittacosaurus may {{not have}} been entirely bipedal for its entire lifespan. Taking {{sections}} from the limb bones of 16 specimens of Psittacosaurus, ranging in age from less than a year old to ten-year old adults, Qi Zhao from the University of Bristol found that Psittacosaurus was probably secondarily bipedal. The infants' front limbs grew at faster rates than the hind limbs at between birth and three years of age. At the age of between four and six years, arm growth slowed and leg growth accelerated as the animal became mature. At this stage, Psittacosaurs would switch to a bipedal stance. These findings further reveal that the ancestor of Psittacosaurus was likely quadrupedal and eventually gained the ability to become bipedal as it evolved, with the young retaining the quadrupedal gait of the ancestor in question. These findings also lead to the hypothesis that many such dinosaur families may have evolved along this path at <b>some</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> evolution.|$|E
40|$|AbstractConsidering the {{importance}} of maize starch {{and the lack of}} knowledge about the effects of storage temperature on the isolated starch properties; maize grains were stored during 12 months at different temperatures (5, 15, 25 and 35 °C). The extraction yield and the physicochemical, thermal, pasting, crystallinity and morphological properties of starches were determined. The starch isolated from grains stored at 35 °C was yellowish and showed a 22. 1 % decrease in starch extraction yield compared to freshly harvested maize grains. At 35 °C, a reduction in crystallinity was observed by the end of 12 months, despite a parallel rearrangement of the starch chains which resulted in an increase in X-ray peak intensities, gelatinisation temperatures and enthalpy. The starch isolated from maize grains stored at 35 °C appears to have smaller granules, which presents <b>some</b> <b>points</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> surface, potentially attributed to the protein matrix compressing the granules within maize grains...|$|R

5|$|All {{vertebrates}} have {{a similar}} basic body plan and at <b>some</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> lives, mostly in the embryonic stage, share the major chordate characteristics; a stiffening rod, the notochord; a dorsal hollow tube of nervous material, the neural tube; pharyngeal arches; and a tail posterior to the anus. The spinal cord is protected by the vertebral column and is above the notochord and the gastrointestinal tract is below it. Nervous tissue {{is derived from the}} ectoderm, connective tissues are derived from mesoderm, and gut is derived from the endoderm. At the posterior end is a tail which continues the spinal cord and vertebrae but not the gut. The mouth is found at the anterior end of the animal, and the anus {{at the base of the}} tail. The defining characteristic of a vertebrate is the vertebral column, formed in the development of the segmented series of vertebrae. In most vertebrates the notochord becomes the nucleus pulposus of the intervertebral discs. However, a few vertebrates, such as the sturgeon and the coelacanth retain the notochord into adulthood. Jawed vertebrates are typified by paired appendages, fins or legs, which may be secondarily lost. The limbs of vertebrates are considered to be homologous because the same underlying skeletal structure was inherited from their last common ancestor. This is one of the arguments put forward by Charles Darwin to support his theory of evolution.|$|E
40|$|Attempts {{to explore}} teacher educators’ {{thoughts}} {{seem to be}} meaningful at educational sciences since the number of studies discussing effective teaching and effective teacher at teacher education {{in the eye of}} teacher educators are quite limited. Therefore, this study mainly aims to identify the viewpoints of teacher educators in order to discover how they contextualize the concept of effective teaching. For this aim, a case study design, increasingly used in education (Tellis, 1997), is utilized in the study.
