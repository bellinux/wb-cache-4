5|$|<b>Ski</b> <b>wax</b> {{enhances the}} ability of a ski or other runner to slide over snow, which depends on both the {{properties}} of the snow and the ski to result in an optimum amount of lubrication from melting the snow by friction with the ski—too little and the ski interacts with solid snow crystals, too much and capillary attraction of meltwater retards the ski. Before a ski can slide, it must overcome the maximum value static friction. Kinetic (or dynamic) friction occurs when the ski is moving over the snow.|$|E

25|$|When skiing, the {{friction}} between the snow and skis causes wax to abrade and remain in the snow pack until spring thaw. Then the snowmelt drains into watersheds, streams, lakes and rivers, thereby changing the chemistry {{of the environment and}} the food chain. Perfluorocarbons in <b>ski</b> <b>wax</b> are heat resistant, chemically and biologically stable, and thus environmentally persistent.|$|E
25|$|Beginning around 1854, California {{gold rush}} miners held {{organized}} downhill ski races. They {{also discovered that}} bases smeared with dopes brewed from vegetable and/or animal compound helped increase skiing speeds. This led {{to some of the}} first commercial <b>ski</b> <b>wax</b> (even though they contained no wax at all), such as Black Dope and Sierra Lighting; both were mainly composed of sperm oil, vegetable oil and pine pitch. However, some instead used paraffin candle wax that melted onto ski bases, and these worked better under colder conditions.|$|E
500|$|In classic {{cross-country}} skiing the skis remain parallel, as the skier strides straight ahead. The undersides of the skis have a grip {{section in the}} middle treated with a special <b>ski</b> <b>wax</b> that provides friction when the foot is still, yet glides when the foot is in motion, {{while the rest of}} the ski bottom has a glide wax. Classic events occur on courses with tracks set by a grooming machine at precise intervals and with carefully planned curvature. Both poles may be used simultaneously ("double-poling") or with alternating foot and arm extended (as with running or walking) with the pole pushing on the side opposite of the extended, sliding ski. In classic skiing the alternating technique is used for the [...] "diagonal stride"—the predominant classic sub-technique. In diagonal-stride legs move like in ordinary walking, but with longer and more powerful steps. Diagonal is useful on level ground and on gentle uphill slopes. Uphill steps are shorter and more frequent. With double-poling both poles are used simultaneously for thrust, which may be augmented with striding. Double-poling is useful on level ground and on gentle downhill slopes. On steep uphills fishbone technique can be used.|$|E

5|$|Snow figures {{into many}} winter sports {{and forms of}} recreation, {{including}} skiing and sledding. Common examples include cross-country skiing, Alpine skiing, snowboarding, snow shoeing, and snowmobiling. The design of the equipment used, typically relies on the bearing strength of snow, as with skis or snowboards and contends with the coefficient of friction of snow to allow sliding, often enhance by <b>ski</b> <b>waxes.</b>|$|R
2500|$|<b>Ski</b> <b>wax</b> is a {{material}} {{applied to the}} bottom of snow runners, including skis, snowboards, and toboggans, to improve their coefficient of friction performance under varying snow conditions. The two main types of wax used on skis are glide waxes and grip waxes. They address kinetic friction—to be minimized with a glide wax—and static friction—to be achieved with a grip wax. Both types of wax are designed to be matched with the varying properties of snow, including crystal type and size, and moisture content of the snow surface, which vary with temperature and the temperature history of the snow. Glide wax is selected to minimize sliding friction for both alpine and cross-country skiing. Grip wax (also called [...] "kick wax") provides on-snow traction for cross-country skiers, as they stride forward using classic technique.|$|E

50|$|The skier uses {{either a}} classic {{diagonal}} stride cross-country technique, or the faster skate skiing technique. In races, the skate-skiing technique is almost exclusively used.

50|$|The {{company was}} founded in Sweden in 1946 by Börje Gabrielsson, based on {{experience}} with <b>ski</b> <b>wax</b> by Swedish skier Martin Matsbo. Swix was the first producer of modern <b>ski</b> <b>wax,</b> and had a scientific approach to the challenge. The wax was colour-coded according to type, a practice which has since been adopted by the entire <b>ski</b> <b>wax</b> industry. Production was in Skåne in Sweden and in Fjellhamar near Oslo, Norway. By 1964 all production had been moved to Norway. In 1974, Swix bought Liljedahls Skistavfabrikk in Lillehammer, briging the brand under the Swix name and becoming a leading ski pole manufacturer. Swix was bought by Ferd in 1978. In 1989, Swix bought Norheim, which was once owned by Gresvig AS, and has since been expanding into the technical sportswear market.|$|E

40|$|Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl {{substances}} (PFAS) {{are used}} {{in a wide range}} of products of all day life. Due to their toxicological potential, an emerging focus is directed towards their exposure to humans. This study investigated the PFAS load of consumer products in a broad perspective. Perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acids (C 4, C 6 -C 8, C 10 -PFSA), carboxylic acids (C 4 -C 14 -PFCA) and fluorotelomer alcohols (4 : 2, 6 : 2; 8 : 2 and 10 : 2 FTOH) were analysed in 115 random samples of consumer products including textiles (outdoor materials), carpets, cleaning and impregnating agents, leather samples, baking and sandwich papers, paper baking forms and <b>ski</b> <b>waxes.</b> PFCA and PFSA were analysed by HPLC-MS/MS, whereas FTOH were detected by GC/CI-MS. Consumer products such as cleaning agents or some baking and sandwich papers show low or negligible PFSA and PFCA contents. On the other hand, high PFAS levels were identified in <b>ski</b> <b>waxes</b> (up to about 2000 mikrog/kg PFOA), leather samples (up to about 200 mikrog/kg PFBA and 120 mikrog/kg PFBS), outdoor textiles (up to 19 mikrog/m 2 PFOA) and some other baking papers (up to 15 mikrog/m 2 PFOA). Moreover, some test samples like carpet and leather samples and outdoor materials exceeded the EU regulatory threshold value for PFOS (1 mikrog/m 2). A diverse mixture of PFASs can be found in consumer products for all fields of daily use in varying concentrations. This study proves the importance of screening and monitoring of consumer products for PFAS loads and the necessity for an action to regulate the use of PFASs, especially PFOA, in consumer products...|$|R
