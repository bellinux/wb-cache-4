50|$|All tablet dosage forms, <b>softgels</b> {{and liquid}} {{formulations}} primarily enter the blood stream via the gastrointestinal tract, which subjects {{the drug to}} degradation from stomach acid, bile, digestive enzymes and other first-pass effects.

50|$|<b>Softgels</b> are {{produced}} {{in a process}} known as encapsulation using the Rotary Die Encapsulation process invented by Robert Pauli Scherer. The encapsulation process {{has been described as a}} form/fill/seal process. Two flat ribbons of shell material are manufactured on the machine and brought together on a twin set of rotating dies. The dies contain recesses in the desired size and shape, which cut out the ribbons into a two-dimensional shape, and form a seal around the outside. At the same time a pump delivers a precise dose of fill material through a nozzle incorporated into a filling wedge whose tip sits between the two ribbons in between two die pockets at the point of cut out. The wedge is heated to facilitate the sealing process. The wedge injection causes the two flat ribbons to expand into the die pockets, giving rise to the three-dimensional finished product. After encapsulation, the <b>softgels</b> are dried for two days to two weeks depending on the product.|$|R

40|$|AbstractBackgroundDespite supplementation with {{standard}} multivitamins and pancreatic enzymes, deficiencies of vitamins D and K and antioxidants {{are common in}} cystic fibrosis (CF). MethodsIn this non-randomized, open-label study, AquADEKs® <b>softgels</b> were given daily over 12 weeks to 14 CF subjects (mean age 15 years, range 10 – 23) without a preceding wash-out period. Both pancreatic sufficient and insufficient subjects were enrolled. Plasma vitamin and antioxidant levels, urine 8 -isoprostane levels, anthropometric measures, and pulmonary function were determined at baseline, 6 and 12 weeks. ResultsDaily supplementation significantly increased plasma beta(β) -carotene, coenzyme Q 10, and γ-tocopherol concentrations, decreased proteins induced in vitamin K absence (PIVKA-II) levels, but did not normalize vitamin D and K status in all subjects. Vitamin A levels did not exceed the normal range for any subject during the entire study period. Modest improvements in weight percentile and pulmonary function were observed. Change in plasma β-carotene concentrations weakly correlated with changes in weight and body mass index percentiles. ConclusionsIn this study, AquADEKs® increased systemic antioxidant levels, while maintaining vitamin A levels in the normal range, and improved but did not completely normalize vitamin D and K status. Increased β-carotene levels were associated with improved growth parameters. These results warrant further clinical evaluation in CF...|$|R
50|$|Softgels {{can be an}} {{effective}} delivery system for oral drugs, especially poorly soluble drugs. This is because the fill can contain liquid ingredients that help increase solubility or permeability of the drug across the membranes in the body. Liquid ingredients are difficult to include in any other solid dosage form such as a tablet. Softgels are also highly suited to potent drugs (for example, where the dose is <100 µg), where the highly reproducible filling process helps ensure each <b>softgel</b> has the same drug content, and because the operators are not exposed to any drug dust during the manufacturing process.|$|E

40|$|We have {{demonstrated}} that simple formulations composed of the parent drug in combination with {{generally regarded as safe}} (GRAS) permeability enhancers are capable of dramatically increasing the absolute bioavailability of zanamivir. This has the advantage of not requiring modification of the drug structure to promote absorption, thus reducing the regulatory challenges involved in conversion of an inhaled to oral route of administration of an approved drug. Absolute bioavailability increases of up to 24 -fold were observed when Capmul MCM L 8 (composed of mono- and diglycerides of caprylic/capric acids in glycerol) was mixed with 1. 5 mg of zanamivir and administered intraduodenally to rats. Rapid uptake (t(max) of 5 min) and a C(max) of over 7200 ng/mL was achieved. Variation of the drug load or amount of enhancer demonstrated a generally linear variation in absorption, indicating an ability to optimize a formulation for a desired outcome such as a targeted C(max) for enzyme saturation. No absorption enhancement was observed when the enhancer was given 2 hr prior to drug administration, indicating, in combination with the observed tmax, that absorption enhancement is temporary. This property is significant and aligns well with therapeutic applications to limit undesirable drug-drug interactions, potentially due to the presence of other poorly absorbed polar drugs. These results suggest that optimal human oral dosage forms of zanamivir should be enteric-coated gelcaps or <b>softgels</b> for intraduodenal release. There continues to be a strong need and market for multiple neuraminidase inhibitors for influenza treatment. Creation of orally available formulations of inhibitor drugs that are currently administered intravenously or by inhalation would provide a significant improvement in treatment of influenza. The very simple GRAS formulation components and anticipated dosage forms would require low manufacturing costs and yield enhanced convenience. These results are being utilized to design prototype dosage forms for initial human pharmacokinetic studies...|$|R

A better pH-related dissolution profile has been described in vitro for <b>softgel</b> T 4 preparation than for T 4 tablets. Our study was aimed at comparing <b>softgel</b> and tablet T 4 requirements in patients with gastric disorders. A total of 37 patients with gastric-related T 4 malabsorption were enrolled, but only 31 (28 F/ 3 M; median age = 50 years; median T 4 dose = 2. 04 μg/kg/day) completed the study. All patients were in long-lasting treatment (> 2 years) with the same dose of T 4 tablets when treatment was switched to a lower dose of <b>softgel</b> T 4 capsules (- 17 %; p = 0. 0002). Assessment of serum FT 4 and TSH was carried out at baseline and after 3, 6, 12, and 18 months after the treatment switch. In more than 2 / 3 of patients (good-responders n = 21), despite the reduced dose of T 4, median TSH values were similar {{at each time point}} (p = 0. 3934) with no change in FT 4 levels.

40|$|Contextl-Thyroxine (l-T 4) therapy {{of central}} {{hypothyroidism}} (CH) {{is guided by}} measurements of serum free thyroxine (FT 4), which should be above the midnormal range value (MNRV). In some countries, novel formulations of oral l-T 4 (liquid or <b>softgel)</b> are available further to the classic tablets. The intestinal absorption of either novel formulation is greater than tablets in patients with primary hypothyroidism. ObjectiveTo evaluate whether new oral formulations of l-T 4 could be considered optimal in patients with CH who do not reach the FT 4 target using tablet l-T 4. DesignOur observation of six patients with isolated CH and serum FT 4 below MNRV under stable adequate doses of tablet l-T 4 (median 1. 51 [*]μg/kg bw/day), prompted us to switch them to liquid (n[*]=[*] 4) or <b>softgel</b> (n[*]=[*] 3) l-T 4 at the same dose, and verify whether FT 4 increased above MNRV. A seventh patient with FT 4 above MNRV was enrolled because she wanted a “more modern formulation. ” Postswitch FT 4 was measured at least twice with the same kit as preswitch FT 4. ResultsIn the first six patients, postswitch FT 4 averaged 13. 0 [*]±[*] 1. 6 [*]pg/ml compared to 10. 4 [*]±[*] 1. 8 preswitch FT 4 (P[*]=[*] 0. 00026), with 11 / 13 (85 %) measurements above MNRV compared to 0 / 20. In the liquid or <b>softgel</b> l-T 4 group, postswitch FT 4 averaged 13. 1 [*]±[*] 1. 6 vs. 10. 6 [*]±[*] 0. 9 [*]pg/ml preswitch (P[*]=[*] 0. 0004) or 12. 9 [*]±[*] 2. 1 vs. 10. 3 [*]±[*] 2. 4 (P[*]=[*] 0. 048), respectively. In the seventh patient (switched to liquid l-T 4), averages were 18. 3 vs. 15. 2 [*]pg/ml, and proportions 4 / 4 vs. 2 / 2. ConclusionIn CH patients, oral liquid or <b>softgel</b> l-T 4 administered at the same doses as tablet l-T 4 ensures target serum FT 4 levels above MNRV that tablet l-T 4 may miss. In turn, this performance suggests the more favorable pharmacokinetics profile of either novel formulation compared with the tablet formulation...|$|E
