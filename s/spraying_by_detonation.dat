5000|$|The {{explosion}} happens by {{the mechanism}} of shock-to-detonation transition. The initiation happens by an explosive charge going off in the mass, <b>by</b> the <b>detonation</b> of a shell thrown into the mass, or <b>by</b> <b>detonation</b> of an explosive mixture {{in contact with the}} mass. The examples are Kriewald, Morgan (present-day Sayreville, New Jersey), Oppau, and Tessenderlo.|$|R

40|$|Short-wavelength {{chemical}} lasers (SWCL's) {{have been}} pursued in many laboratories, following the great success achieved with infrared chemical lasers utilizing simple atom molecule exchange reaction. However, all efforts to obtain SWCL's (< 1 µm) {{have failed to}} date. The reasons for failure and possible ways to overcome the difficulties are discussed. In particular, a novel approach to obtaining SWCL's based on a premixed fuel-lasant capable of producing high energy pulses, is described. Electronically-excited nitrogen molecules are produced <b>by</b> <b>detonation</b> of metal azides. Lasing is excepted via energy transfer from the nitrogen molecules to metal atoms or within the nitrogen molecules.

40|$|WC- 12 %Co powder of 53 µm – 63 µm {{particle}} size were thermally <b>sprayed</b> <b>by</b> using {{high velocity oxygen fuel}} gun (HVOF) MicroJet and modified gas flame gun TopJet/ 2. Gas ratio during the spraying time was sistematically varied to define influence of spraying parameters {{on the quality}} of coatings. Adhesive strength test were carried out by pull-off the pin method using an original device. Surface morphology investigation of the WC- 12 %Co coatings, <b>sprayed</b> <b>by</b> the MicroJet gun and modified gas flame gun TopJet/ 2, showed that the increase of the fuel gas flow rate resulted in reduction of the surface roughness and porosity as well as improved sintering of the particles. Adhesive strength of the coatings <b>sprayed</b> <b>by</b> the MicroJet gun varies from 46. 5 MPa to 59. 7 MPa. Fuel gas flow rate increase resulted to sudden increase of the adhesive strength.

The study revealed from 4. 8 % to 34. 1 % increase in aboveground matter of sunflower which was <b>sprayed</b> <b>by</b> 5 -ALA solution at concentrations of 0. 01 - 0. 1 ppm in comparison with plants grown in a medium containing 200 mg Pb ∙ dm - 3 with no 5 -ALA spraying.

50|$|Methyl nitrate is a {{sensitive}} explosive. When ignited it burns extremely fiercely with a gray-blue flame. Methyl nitrate has {{a relatively low}} brisance in comparison to other explosives, including other nitrate esters. The sensitivity of methyl nitrate to initiation <b>by</b> <b>detonation</b> is among the greatest known, with even a number one blasting cap, the lowest power available, producing a near full detonation of the explosive.|$|R

Thousands of people witnessed a large fireball followed <b>by</b> <b>detonations</b> and a very large shower of small fragments falling on ice, land and houses within an area of about 127 sq km (appx. 78 sq. miles).

5000|$|In {{explosive}} welding, {{the pressure}} to bond the two layers is provided <b>by</b> <b>detonation</b> of a sheet of chemical explosive. No heat-affected zone is produced in the bond between metals. The explosion propagates across the sheet, which tends to expel impurities and oxides from between the sheets. Pieces up to 4 x 16 metres can be manufactured. The process is useful for cladding metal sheets with a corrosion-resistant layer.|$|R
