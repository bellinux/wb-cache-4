40|$|<b>Stillage</b> <b>sludge,</b> a {{by-product}} of sugar industry, was subjected to proximate analysis. Its protein quantity and quality was improved through fermentation with Brevibacterium flavum. A protein isolate was prepared from it. Its proximate analysis was carried out to know its nutritional potential. The amino acid profile shows that it is limiting in threoninc. The chemical score of protein isolate thus found to be 36. 42. The quality of its protein was evaluated in terms of protein efficiency ratio (3. 92), net protein utilization (71. 27), digestibility (96. 97) and biological value (73. 00) by conducting a feeding trial on weanling albino rats...|$|E
40|$|Availability {{of animal}} protein due to low {{production}} and high cost is limited. Therefore, vegetable protein being cheeper source, {{may be used}} in the preparation of weaning food for infants. The present study was carried out to prepare a weaning food consisting of sprouted wheat and protein isolate from an unconventional source, like <b>stillage</b> <b>sludge.</b> The chemical evaluation of weaning food was conducted. Amino acid profile of the protein isolate showed the chemical score was 36. 42. However thyronine was the limiting amino acid. Results of biological trial conducted on weanling Albino rats showed the digestibility, 96. 40, 97. 83. Net protein utilization (NPU) 76. 34, 78. 8, biological value 79. 20, 80. 54 and protein efficiency ratio 4. 0, 4. 6 of skim milk diet respectively...|$|E
40|$|Fermentative {{hydrogen}} production from cassava stillage {{was conducted to}} investigate the influences of temperature (37 Â Â°C, 60 Â Â°C, 70 Â Â°C) and initial pH (4 - 10) in batch experiments. Although the seed sludge was mesophilic anaerobic sludge, maximum hydrogen yield (53. 8 Â ml H 2 /gVS) was obtained under thermophilic condition (60 Â Â°C), 53. 5 % and 198 % higher than the values under mesophilic (37 Â Â°C) and extreme-thermophilic (70 Â Â°C) conditions respectively. The difference was mainly due to the different VFA and ethanol distributions. Higher {{hydrogen production}} corresponded with higher ratios of butyrate/acetate and butyrate/propionate. Similar hydrogen yields of 66. 3 and 67. 8 Â ml H 2 /gVS were obtained at initial pH 5 and 6 respectively under thermophilic condition. The total amount of VFA and ethanol increased from 3536 to 7899 Â mg/l {{with the increase of}} initial pH from 4 to 10. Initial pH 6 was considered as the optimal pH due to its 19 % higher total VFA and ethanol concentration than that of pH 5. Homoacetogenesis and methonogenesis were very dependent on the initial pH and temperature even when the inoculum was heat-pretreated. Moreover, a difference between measured and theoretical hydrogen was observed in this study, which could be attributed to homoacetogenesis, methanogenesis and the degradation of protein.
