50|$|Changes {{were also}} needed in {{searchlight}} design and training, so a team was {{selected from the}} London Electrical Engineers {{to return to their}} Headquarters at 46 Regency Street and set up workshops, design and drawing offices to deal with the redesigns. This organisation became The Searchlight Experimental Establishment commanded by Captain P. Yorke, RE. (The Tyne Electrical Engineers (TEE) similarly took responsibility for the School of Electric Lighting at Gosport.) Technology and tactics developed to keep pace as the Germans replaced vulnerable airships with heavy bombers. New 90 cm and 120 cm electric searchlights and their <b>sound</b> <b>locators</b> were linked directly to the guns to provide early warning.|$|R
5000|$|The US Marines {{included}} sound ranging units {{as standard}} {{parts of their}} defense battalions. These sound ranging units were active in the Marines both before and during World War II. The US Army also used <b>sound</b> <b>locators.</b> During the Okinawa campaign, the US Army used its sound ranging sets to provide effective counter battery fire. The Japanese tried to counter this effective counter-battery fire with the tactic of [...] "shoot and scoot," [...] which means shooting {{a small number of}} rounds and leaving the firing position before the counter-battery fire could arrive. While an effective tactic against counter-battery fire, this approach tends to reduce the effectiveness of artillery fire.|$|R

50|$|In late 1941 the {{battalion}} began to receive SLC-equipped 90-cm searchlight projectors to replace <b>sound</b> <b>locators.</b> These required relocation of some sites to obtain best results. Early in 1942 the regiment shifted {{some of its}} sites southwards, including parts of Essex, with 328 Battery based at Felixstowe, 330 Battery at Manningtree, from where it covered Shotley Royal Naval Training Establishment (HMS Ganges) and the Harwich Naval Base, and 562 Battery covering Colchester and Chelmsford. These three batteries came {{under the control of}} RAF North Weald Operations Room. Regimental HQ also moved to Manningtree. Part of 328 Battery's duties was to provide 'Canopy' for RAF Martlesham Heath, where a cone of searchlights over the airfield assisted homing aircraft. This duty ended when the US Eighth Air Force took over Martlesham Heath. The regiment also provided 'Canopy' for RAF Wattisham in the spring of 1941.|$|R
50|$|The first battalions {{were created}} in 1939, when the {{outbreak}} of World War II caused concerns that overseas bases might be attacked by the Imperial Japanese Navy. In July 1941 the 5th Marine Defense Battalion landed in Iceland {{as part of the}} 1st Provisional Marine Brigade alongside the 6th Marine Regiment and other elements of the 2nd Marine Division, augmenting British forces until they departed in September. The battalion had left its Coast Defense Group behind and exchanged the aircraft <b>sound</b> <b>locators</b> for SCR-268 radar sets. In March 1942 the battalion was relieved by the Army's 61st Coast Artillery Regiment. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, where defenders shot down three planes on 7 December 1941, the battalions grew rapidly. On 8 December, the Japanese began an assault on Wake Island, and the defenders, including 399 Marines of the 1st Defense Battalion, surrendered after a prolonged battle on 23 December.|$|R
50|$|Although AA Command and RAF Fighter Command had the {{advantage}} of the Chain Home radar network to detect air raids approaching the coastline, there was no radar coverage inland. In daylight the Royal Observer Corps and searchlight detachments tracked the progress of raids visually; at night, sound location had to be used. 1st AA Division devised a system of 14 fixed base-lines of <b>sound</b> <b>locators</b> to detect night raids approaching the London Inner Artillery Zone. These were linked by automatic telephone equipment to the operations room, where the angular plots were resolved to indicate grid squares where the Heavy AA guns in range could fire an unseen barrage. Detachments of 75th S/L Rgt were trained to operate these baselines. This 'Fixed Azimuth' system came into action in June 1940, in time for the opening of the night Blitz on London. It was later replaced when searchlight control (SLC) and gunlaying (GL) radar systems were introduced.|$|R
5000|$|This is {{also the}} first episode to use the digital ink and paint as a proof of concept, {{which led to the}} {{decision}} to have The Simpsons animation converted from traditional cel to digital ink and paint. It was a good episode to test technique on due to the cloning sequences which required many different layers of animation for each of the clones. According to Al Jean, in the dub for the scene where Homer is being cloned Matt Groening said [...] "let's just throw a couple screams in there", and <b>sound</b> archive <b>locator</b> Norm supplied them. The effect coming out of the hammock is meant to resemble a Xerox light. This was one of two years that did not feature special Halloween names of The Simpsons staff in the credits. Al Jean said that to some people, the names took up so much space across the screen that the result was a [...] "green smear". They were brought back due to popular demand. The image of Homer strangling Homer was pitched in the writers room by one of the audio commentators.|$|R

Next part of the paper describes time-delay estimation method of the direction of arrival of the sound wave and its software implementation for real-time evaluation. Created software application for audio data analysis and direction of arrival computations provides user-friendly graphical user interface which is able to visualize recorded sound waves and frequency spectra in sound analyzer mode and direction of arrival of <b>sound</b> wave in <b>locator</b> mode.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a generic technology for modeling {{in real time}} the various operations of surface mines. Based on various sensor fusion techniques and high-speed network, a virtual reality model of a mine capable of representing not only static infrastructures but also mobile equipment such as trucks and excavators is created. The modeling technique deal {{with a wide range}} of sensors such as survey data, satellite pictures, ore concentration, machine condition indicators, video, <b>sound,</b> real-time GPS <b>locator,</b> range sensor, etc. The model created allows for every piece of information to be displayed in context allowing for a better temporal and spatial correlation of events by mine operators, planners, and supervisors. Syncrude, a Canadian mining company located in northern Alberta, is planning to use this technology, not only to understand oil sands mining processes better, but also to give decision-makers better access to the timely, accurate information from the field that they need to make informed decisions...|$|R
5000|$|In the United States, the {{standards}} in the 2009 MUTCD require APS units to have a pushbutton locator tone, audible and vibrotactile walk indications, a tactile arrow aligned with the direction of travel on the crosswalk, and to respond to ambient <b>sound.</b> The pushbutton <b>locator</b> tone is a beep or tick, repeating at once per second, to allow {{people who are blind}} to find the device. If APS units are installed in more than one crossing direction (e.g. if there are APS units at a curb for both the north-south and west-east crossing directions), different sounds or speech messages may be used for each direction. Under the MUTCD guideline, the walk indication may be a speech message if two or more units on the same curb are separated by less than 10 ft. These speech messages usually follow the pattern [...] "name. Walk sign is on to cross Name." [...] Otherwise, the walk indication may be a [...] "percussive tone," [...] which usually consists of repeated, rapid sounds that can be clearly heard from the opposite curb and can oscillate between high and low volumes. In both cases, when the [...] "don't walk" [...] indication is flashing, the device will beep at every second until the [...] "don't walk" [...] indication becomes steady and the pedestrian countdown indication reaches [...] "0", at which point the device will beep intermittently at lower volume. When activated, the APS units are mandated to be accompanied by a vibrating arrow on the APS during the walk signal.|$|R
