5|$|Containing autobiographical themes, a {{majority}} of the album's lyrics came {{as the result of a}} series of changes in her life: a recent annulment of her marriage to singer James DeBarge, severing her business affairs from her father and manager Joseph and the rest of the Jackson family, hiring the A executive John McClain as her new management, and her subsequent introduction to Jam and Lewis. The album has been praised by critics as both an artistic feat and as a personal testament of <b>self-actualization.</b> It has also been regarded as a template upon which numerous female artists have modeled their careers, particularly black women.|$|E
25|$|According to WorldCat, {{psychological}} themes {{found in}} Brodsky's books include the subjects: <b>self-actualization,</b> self-esteem, self-realization, change, identity, and individual responsibility.|$|E
25|$|Need-based {{theories}} of motivation focus on an employee's drive {{to satisfy a}} variety of needs through their work. These needs range from basic physiological needs for survival to higher psychoemotional needs like belonging and <b>self-actualization.</b>|$|E
25|$|Basic {{needs are}} defined as the most basic needs {{required}} to survive such as food, water and shelter. Basic needs and needs associated with <b>self-actualization</b> (overwhelming needs) co-exist when basic needs are being compromised over extended periods of time.|$|E
25|$|The Need for Achievement is in {{many ways}} similar to the need for mastery and <b>self-actualization</b> in Maslow's {{hierarchy}} of needs and growth in the ERG theory. The achievement orientation has garnered more research interest as compared to the need for affiliation or power.|$|E
25|$|In setting {{goals and}} the {{intervention}} activities, in order to solve social/human problems, there prevail critical terms and categories of the humanistic psychology and psychotherapy, such as: <b>self-actualization,</b> human potential, holistic approach, human being, free will, subjectivity, human experience, self-determination/development, spirituality, creativity, positive thinking, client-centered and context-centered approach/intervention, empathy, personal growth, empowerment.|$|E
25|$|Humanistic {{psychology}} is a psychological perspective that rose to {{prominence in the}} mid-20th century in answer to the limitations of Sigmund Freud's psychoanalytic theory and B. F. Skinner's behaviorism. With its roots running from Socrates through the Renaissance, this approach emphasizes individuals' inherent drive towards <b>self-actualization,</b> the process of realizing and expressing one's own capabilities and creativity.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1930s, psychologists, {{interested}} in the uniquely human issues, such as the self, <b>self-actualization,</b> health, hope, love, creativity, nature, being, becoming, individuality, and meaningthat is, a concrete understanding of human existence, included Abraham Maslow, Carl Rogers, and Clark Moustakas, {{who were interested in}} founding a professional association dedicated to a psychology focused on these features of human capital demanded by post-industrial society.|$|E
25|$|Maslow's {{hierarchy}} of {{needs is a}} pyramid depicting the levels of human needs, psychological, and physical. When a human being ascends {{the steps of the}} pyramid, he reaches <b>self-actualization.</b> Beyond the routine of needs fulfillment, Maslow envisioned moments of extraordinary experience, known as peak experiences, profound moments of love, understanding, happiness, or rapture, during which a person feels more whole, alive, self-sufficient, and yet a part of the world. This is similar to the flow concept of Mihály Csíkszentmihályi.|$|E
25|$|At {{the most}} basic level, an {{employee}} is motivated to work {{in order to satisfy}} basic physiological needs for survival, such as having enough money to purchase food. The next level of need in the hierarchy is safety, which could be interpreted to mean adequate housing or living in a safe neighborhood. The next three levels in Maslow's theory relate to intellectual and psycho-emotional needs: love and belonging, esteem (which refers to competence and mastery), and finally the highest order need, <b>self-actualization.</b>|$|E
25|$|Personal {{development}} in Buddhism {{is based upon}} the noble eightfold path which integrates ethics, wisdom or understanding (pañña) and psychological practices such as meditation (bhavana, cultivation, development). <b>Self-actualization</b> in traditional Buddhism is based on the ideas of Nirvana and Buddhahood. The highest state a human can achieve (an Arahant or a Buddha) is seen as being completely free from any kind of dissatisfaction or suffering, all negative mental tendencies, roots and influxes have been eliminated and there are only positive emotions like compassion and loving-kindness present.|$|E
25|$|The basic {{requirements}} build upon {{the first step}} in the pyramid: physiology. If there are deficits on this level, all behavior will be oriented to satisfy this deficit. Essentially, if you have not slept or eaten adequately, you won't be interested in your self-esteem desires. Subsequently, we have the second level, which awakens a need for security. After securing those two levels, the motives shift to the social sphere, the third level. Psychological requirements comprise the fourth level, while the top of the hierarchy consists of self-realization and <b>self-actualization.</b>|$|E
25|$|In the mid-20th century, {{the rise}} of {{phenomenology}} and humanistic psychology led to renewed interest in self-esteem. Self-esteem then took {{a central role in}} personal <b>self-actualization</b> and in the treatment of psychic disorders. Psychologists started to consider the relationship between psychotherapy and the personal satisfaction of a person with high self-esteem as useful to the field. This led to new elements being introduced to the concept of self-esteem, including the reasons why people tend to feel less worthy and why people become discouraged or unable to meet challenges by themselves.|$|E
25|$|Honing {{theory is}} held to explain certain {{phenomena}} not {{dealt with by}} other theories of creativity, for example, how different works by the same creator are observed in studies to exhibit a recognizable style or 'voice' even through in different creative outlets. This is not predicted by theories of creativity that emphasize chance processes or the accumulation of expertise, but it is predicted by honing theory, according to which personal style reflects the creator's uniquely structured worldview. Another example is in the environmental stimulus for creativity. Creativity is commonly considered to be fostered by a supportive, nurturing, trustworthy environment conducive to <b>self-actualization.</b> However, research shows that creativity is also associated with childhood adversity, which would stimulate honing.|$|E
25|$|Humanistic {{psychology}} {{developed in}} the 1950s as a movement within academic psychology, in reaction to both behaviorism and psychoanalysis. The humanistic approach sought to glimpse the whole person, not just fragmented parts of the personality or isolated cognitions. Humanism focused on uniquely human issues, such as free will, personal growth, <b>self-actualization,</b> self-identity, death, aloneness, freedom, and meaning. It emphasized subjective meaning, rejection of determinism, and concern for positive growth rather than pathology. Some founders of the humanistic school of thought were American psychologists Abraham Maslow, who formulated a hierarchy of human needs, and Carl Rogers, who created and developed client-centered therapy. Later, positive psychology opened up humanistic themes to scientific modes of exploration.|$|E
25|$|Alderfer, {{expanding}} on Maslow's {{hierarchy of}} needs, created the ERG theory. This theory posits {{that there are}} three groups of core needs — existence, relatedness, and growth, hence the label: ERG theory. The existence group is concerned with providing our basic material existence requirements. They include the items that Maslow considered to be physiological and safety needs. The second group of needs are those of relatedness- the desire we have for maintaining important personal relationships. These social and status desires require interaction with others {{if they are to be}} satisfied, and they align with Maslow's social need and the external component of Maslow's esteem classification. Finally, Alderfer isolates growth needs as an intrinsic desire for personal development. Maslow's categories are broken down into many different parts and there are a lot of needs. The ERG categories are more broad and covers more than just certain areas. As a person grows, the existence, relatedness, and growth for all desires continue to grow. All these needs should be fulfilled to greater wholeness as a human being. These include the intrinsic component from Maslow's esteem category and the characteristics included under <b>self-actualization.</b>|$|E
500|$|Conversely, {{reflecting}} the transformation from script to screen, Dana Stevens of Slate disagrees with Gleiberman's {{suggestion that the}} [...] "film makes you think" [...] and argues that the film's [...] "eagerness" [...] to [...] "drag" [...] the audience [...] "through the lower depths of human experience" [...] leaves little space for independent [...] "conclusions". Stevens noted that while the film is about improvement and <b>self-actualization,</b> [...] "it wields an awfully large cudgel" [...] in contrast to Scott's view of balance: [...] "unsparing force (though not in overly graphic detail)". Perhaps sharing Mathews' view regarding the daunting challenge of adapting the harsh story of Push, Stevens' observes that [...] "Daniels and Fletcher no doubt intended for their film to lend a voice {{to the kind of}} protagonist too often excluded from American movie screens: a poor, black, overweight single mother from the inner city." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2013, Hutcherson voiced the {{character}} Nod in the animated action-adventure 3D film Epic, {{loosely based on}} William Joyce's book, The Leaf Men and the Brave Good Bugs; the film is his most commercially successful except for The Hunger Games series. As filming approached for The Hunger Games sequel, , he enlisted celebrity trainer Bobby Strom to assist him in five hour-long workouts per week. The film brought in $420 million at the North American box office, making it his most commercially successful film. Todd Gilchrist of Indiewire proclaimed of the actor's performance that [...] "Hutcherson's maturing talents achieve a parallelism with {{the character}}'s <b>self-actualization,</b> proving subtler and more self-aware with every resigned decision he makes {{on behalf of the}} people around him that he loves." [...] Hutcherson received his second MTV Movie Award for [...] "Best Male Performance" [...] {{for his role in the}} sequel.|$|E
500|$|... "Disposable Teens" [...] is a [...] "signature Marilyn Manson song" [...] with a {{bouncing}} guitar riff {{composed of}} staccato articulation. Its lyrics juxtapose the disenfranchisement of contemporary youth with the revolutionary idealism of their parents' generation. The Beatles' influence {{is evident in}} this song; the chorus echoes the disillusionment of the White Albums [...] "Revolution 1". Manson singled out [...] "Target Audience (Narcissus Narcosis)" [...] as his favorite song on the album, and said that it describes every person's desire for <b>self-actualization.</b> Borrowing a riff from English alternative rock band Radiohead, [...] "President Dead" [...] is a guitar-driven song showcasing John 5's technical skills. It opens {{with a sample of}} Don Gardiner's ABC News Radio broadcast announcing the death of John F. Kennedy. The song is 3:13 long, which is a deliberate numerological reference to frame 313 of the Zapruder film—the frame displaying the impact of the fatal head shot which killed Kennedy. [...] "In the Shadow of the Valley of Death" [...] is an introspective song with Adam at his most emotionally vulnerable.|$|E
500|$|Robert Avila of the San Francisco Bay Guardian called The Group: [...] "in-your-face {{comedy in}} a droll send-up of EST-like <b>self-actualization</b> programs," [...] and a spoof of [...] "recent incarnations" [...] {{including}} The Secret and Landmark Forum. Avila gave the play a positive review, noting its [...] "inspired writing, sharp humor, and simple yet slick production". In {{a review of}} the play for the San Jose Mercury News, Karen D'Souza wrote: [...] From est to 'The Secret,' this is a playful lampoon of 'healing philosophies'". D'Souza also reviewed the play positively, writing: [...] " [...] Writer-director Robert Quillen Camp slyly pokes fun at reducing the human experience to one-size-fits-all platitudes and besmirching belief systems with [...] "cash-only" [...] workshops." [...] Pat Craig wrote in Contra Costa Times: [...] "After a lifetime of enduring various human potential programs, from the chanted mantras of transcendental meditation to the institutionalized loathing of est, 'The Group' seems a bit tame for satire to a veteran of the high-profit mind games." [...] In a review for the San Francisco Examiner, Leslie Katz said, [...] "In the end, the show provides excellent therapy. As those who aren't swayed by expensive self-help seminars know, laughter is indeed the best medicine." ...|$|E
500|$|Upon the 30th {{anniversary of}} the album's release, Julian Kimble of Billboard {{magazine}} wrote: [...] "In hindsight, Control is both evolutionary and revolutionary. As Jackson’s first album to land atop the Billboard 200, it marked professional and personal breakthroughs. Distancing herself from the immense Jackson family shadow, she created {{one of the most}} influential projects across contemporary R and pop music. And not only was Jackson’s maiden voyage with producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis at the forefront of R, pop and hip-hop’s intersection, it birthed a novel sound in the process." [...] MTV's Meaghan Garvey asserted [...] "it’s hard to overstate the significance of Control, whether in terms of the pop landscape, the evolution of the music video as a vessel for promotion and expression, or Top 40 feminist anthems." [...] She also argued [...] "it’s important to note that Control’s <b>self-actualization</b> anthems were expressions of black female pride. Control spawned a whopping six videos—great ones, at that—which played an immeasurable role in the shift toward visible black pop." [...] Gerrick D. Kennedy of Los Angeles Times wrote that Jackson's continued influence is evident in the careers of Rihanna, Beyoncé, Ciara, FKA Twigs and Tinashe in that [...] "all of them take cues from Jackson's blueprint. And all that began with Control." ...|$|E
500|$|Bill Lamb of About.com {{ranked the}} song as the 13th best pop song of all time, expressing that [...] "Kelly Clarkson {{has stated that}} she insisted on adding the rock feel to the recording. The result was a record that {{captured}} the prevailing sound of mainstream pop with near perfection." [...] NME placed it at number 135 on its list of the [...] "150 Best Tracks of the Past 15 Years", writing [...] "What {{should have been a}} slice of American schlock power-pop turned into a brilliant kiss-off, in any genre." [...] The A.V. Club staff rated the song as one of their favorite gleeful breakup songs, writing [...] "The minute that bass and drum machine start, this song is an anthem of the scorned, a call to <b>self-actualization,</b> and an instant hands-in-the-air dance party." [...] Rolling Stone ranked [...] "Since U Been Gone" [...] at number 482 of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time in 2010, whose readers listed it as the ninth-ranked single of the last decade. The AOL Radio Staff put the song at number 10 on their list of 10 Best Break Up Songs. The song also appeared at number one in Sarah Muller of MTV's Valentine's Day Playlist: Top 10 Breakup Songs. [...] "Since U Been Gone" [...] has also appeared in several Billboard lists; in March 2013, it was ranked at number one on its list of Top 100 American Idol Hits of All Time. In April 2017, it appeared at number two of Billboards 100 greatest choruses of the 21st century and is also Clarkson's biggest Billboard Hot 100 hits.|$|E
500|$|Jackson {{has changed}} her lyrical focus over the years, {{becoming}} {{the subject of}} analysis in musicology, African American studies, and gender studies. David Ritz compared Jackson's musical style to Marvin Gaye's, stating, [...] "like Marvin, autobiography seemed the sole source of her music. Her art, also like Marvin's, floated over a reservoir of secret pain." [...] Much of her success {{has been attributed to}} [...] "a series of powerful, metallic grooves; her chirpy, multi-tracked vocals; and a lyrical philosophy built on pride and self-knowledge." [...] Ritz also stated, [...] "The mystery is the low flame that burns around the perimeters of Janet Jackson's soul. The flame feeds off the most highly combustible elements: survival and ambition, caution and creativity, supreme confidence and dark fear." [...] During the 1980s, her lyrics embodied <b>self-actualization,</b> feminist principles, and politically driven ideology. Gillian G. Gaar, author of She's a Rebel: The History of Women in Rock & Roll (2002), described Control as [...] "an autobiographical tale about her life with her parents, her first marriage, and breaking free." [...] Encyclopedia of African American Popular Culture (2010) author Jessie Carney Smith wrote [...] "with that album, she asserted her independence, individuality, and personal power. She challenged audiences to see her as a transformed person, from an ingénue to a grow-up, multi-talented celebrity." [...] Referring to Rhythm Nation 1814 as an embodiment of hope, Timothy E. Scheurer, author of Born in the USA: The Myth of America in Popular Music from Colonial Times to the Present (2007) wrote [...] "It may remind some of Sly Stone prior to There's a Riot Going On and other African-American artists of the 1970s in its tacit assumption that the world imagined by Dr. King is still possible, that the American Dream is a dream for all people." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Lysergic Acid Diethylamide" [...] {{concluded}} Anna Torv's [...] "Bellivia" [...] arc. Pinkner {{defended the}} storyline against some critical fans, [...] "We understand {{that some people}} were frustrated, just like some people were frustrated {{with the idea of}} Bolivia having a baby. But there are things that we feel are entertaining to us, and that allow us to explore themes that... we can’t otherwise access. And we think that if it’s entertaining, and it allows Anna a chance to stretch, and it gives Walter Bishop his old partner back for an episode so we can see what they were like together... those are also perfectly valid reasons for doing those episodes." [...] Wyman added, [...] "Yeah, it was important. I mean, you know, for people that say it was just a diversion, well, there was something really important involved in that Walter/William relationship. That was part of Walter’s <b>self-actualization,</b> that moment when William Bell says, 'Look, you have to be on your own. You have to walk the path that you believe in. You gain some humility where there once was hubris, and it’s really important that you depend on yourself.' Part of our plan has always been to get Walter to embrace his flaws and uniqueness as strengths, rather than thinking of them inhibiting his performance as a scientist and as a character. We were really anxious to get that across, and the best person to do that for us was William Bell, because Walter depended so much on William in so many different ways. So that story came around at a time where we really needed to have it." [...] Because the season finale did not resolve the plotline of Olivia and the man from the blimp, Pinkner commented in a post-finale interview that [...] "It’s definitely still in play. Without being too spoilery, there are things you think you have time to explore in any given season, but don’t. But yes, we are very interested in that moment and the implications of that." ...|$|E

2500|$|Horney {{also shared}} Abraham Maslow's view that <b>self-actualization</b> is {{something}} that all people strive for. By [...] "self" [...] she understood the core of one's own being and potential. Horney believed that if we have an accurate conception of our own self, then we are free to realize our potential and achieve what we wish, within reasonable boundaries. Thus, she believed that <b>self-actualization</b> is the healthy person's aim through life—as opposed to the neurotic's clinging {{to a set of}} key needs.|$|E

2500|$|The aim of {{humanistic}} {{therapy is}} usually {{to help the}} client develop a stronger and healthier sense of self, also called <b>self-actualization.</b> [...] Humanistic therapy attempts to teach clients that they have potential for self-fulfillment. This type of therapy is insight-based, meaning that the therapist attempts to provide the client with insights about their inner conflicts.|$|E

2500|$|According to Padmal de Silva [...] "Buddhist {{strategies}} {{represent a}} therapeutic model which treats the person as his/her agent of change, {{rather than as}} the recipient of externally imposed interventions." [...] Silva argues that the Buddha saw each person {{responsible for their own}} personal development and considers this as being similar to the humanistic approach to psychology. Humanistic psychotherapy places much emphasis on helping the client achieve <b>self-actualization</b> and personal growth (e.g. Maslow).|$|E
2500|$|Humanistic {{psychology}} is a psychological perspective which rose to {{prominence in the}} mid-20th century in response to Sigmund Freud's psychoanalytic theory and B. F.

2500|$|There is {{debate about}} whether the {{philosophy}} of Friedrich Nietzsche can be considered an influence on transhumanism despite its exaltation of the [...] "Übermensch" [...] (overman or superman), due to its emphasis on <b>self-actualization,</b> rather than technological transformation. The transhumanist philosophies of Max More and Stefan Lorenz Sorgner have been influenced strongly by Nietzschean thinking.

2500|$|Peter B. Clarke {{confirmed}} that most participators {{felt they had}} made progress in <b>self-actualization</b> as defined by American psychologist Abraham Maslow and the human potential movement. He stated that the style of therapy Rajneesh devised, with its liberal attitude towards sexuality as a sacred part of life, had proved influential among other therapy practitioners and new age groups. Yet Clarke believes that the main motivation of seekers joining the movement was [...] "neither therapy nor sex, but the prospect of becoming enlightened, in the classical Buddhist sense".|$|E
2500|$|One of {{humanistic}} psychology's early sources was {{the work}} of Carl Rogers, who was strongly influenced by Otto Rank, who broke with Freud in the mid-1920s. [...] Rogers' focus was to ensure that the developmental processes led to healthier, if not more creative, personality functioning. The term 'actualizing tendency' was also coined by Rogers, and was a concept that eventually led Abraham Maslow to study <b>self-actualization</b> as one of the needs of humans. Rogers and Maslow introduced this positive, humanistic psychology in response to what they viewed as the overly pessimistic view of psychoanalysis.|$|E
