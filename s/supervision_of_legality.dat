40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the issue of {{cognition}} of Polish administrative courts. The doctrine formulates a number of different opinions on that matter, from a postulate to maintain the existing model which limits the court’s <b>supervision</b> <b>of</b> the <b>legality</b> <b>of</b> a public administrative act in the cassation system, to the introduction of administrative courts judicial decision as to the merits of an administration case. In the light of the existing wording of Article 184 of Poland’s Constitution, the latter proposal is currently unacceptable since its adoption would vest into the administrative court the tasks of administration, leaving organs of public administration unable to realise their goals and objectives. As a result, their activities would be taken over by courts. There {{are a number of other}} reasons supporting the current judicial supervision, including the fact that organs of public administration are highly specialised in different matters. A replacement of the cassation system <b>of</b> <b>supervision</b> with a system of appeals would also entail a necessity to revise the whole system <b>of</b> instance <b>supervision,</b> which again, would be contradictory to the currently binding Constitution. What is more, the administrative court would loose one of its immanent features namely, the power to control administration distinguish it from the jurisdiction of courts of law. This could even lead to further postulates advocating resignation from a separate judicial decision in administrative matters. Last but not least, there are historical reasons why the current model should be retained. All the arguments presented in the paper support the view that the cognition of Polish administrative courts should remain unchanged...|$|R

The various legal systems represent different ways of considering the Principle <b>of</b> <b>Legality,</b> taking into account the general aspects of retroactivity, strict construction and foreseeability as guidelines for this study.   Therefore, {{it was not possible to}} extract a general understanding of the Principle <b>of</b> <b>Legality,</b> and even the consideration of minimum standards was a complex task. Despite these obstacles some conclusions could be reached regarding the evolution of the Principle <b>of</b> <b>Legality</b> in international criminal law.   The Principle <b>of</b> <b>Legality</b> seems to be in a very early state of development in international criminal law.   There seem to be some basic rules that are recognised in treaties, but the courts and the drafters of criminal definitions have not given the Principle the same scope at domestic legislatures and courts.   However, the Rome Statute seems to provide for a system where the Principle <b>of</b> <b>Legality</b> could be respected, since its text gives the broadest scope of any treaty so far.   However, for now there is still a lot of work to be done, if we aspire to create a respectful system of international criminal law, since the existing rules do not comply with the expected minimum standards.

40|$|The concept <b>of</b> <b>legality</b> is {{a crucial}} one for the {{definition}} of many shared-memory consistency conditions.

Being thus defined on totally ordered sets of operations, the notion <b>of</b> <b>legality</b> is not fully realistic, because parallel executions on sharedmemory multiprocessing systems are best represented by partially ordered sets of operations.

In this paper, we introduce an alternative definition <b>of</b> <b>legality</b> that is based on partially ordered sets of operations.

40|$|The Peoples' Councils and Local Self-Government System Act of 20 July 1983 {{introduced}} certain new {{elements to}} local administration system. Treating people's councils as organs of local self-government {{was one of}} those elements. People's councils and organs of municipal and rural residents self-government are handled in the new regulation as parts of the same organizational structure (of local self- -government system). It resulted in an increase of weight <b>of</b> decentralization and <b>supervision</b> problems in aspect of local administration. The present article contains a study of regulation pertaining to supervision excercised in three systems: 1. supervision performed upon people's councils, 2. <b>supervision</b> upon organs <b>of</b> municipal and rural self-government and 3. supervision upon administrative organs of people's councils. In the first system, supervision is performed by the Council of State (upon all councils in principle) and by voivodship (district) councils upon municipal, quarter, and rural district councils. The <b>supervision</b> covers control <b>of</b> <b>legality</b> <b>of</b> decisions and corrective means which cannot violate a principle of independence in activities. The newly introduced obligation of lending assistance to supervised organs is characteristic for a socialist state. The Polish Seym (Diet) is also obliged by the Act to take care of self-government charakter of people's councils, special means are provided for the Council of State to be used in instances of violating independence of people's councils by other organs. <b>Supervision</b> <b>of</b> rural self-government organs is trusted to rural district council and to its presidium, while supervision upon municipal self-government organs is performed by municipal (quarter) council and its presidium. Means of control are not intensive there but also the scope of affairs relegated to that self government is not substantial {{at least as far as}} decisional competence is concerned. In practice, the <b>supervision</b> upon organs <b>of</b> administration of people's councils is of a crucial importance, as those are implementing tasks of people's councils. On the central level, the supervision is divided onto various organs: Council of Ministers, Prime Minister, Minister of Administration and Region-Shaping Economy and branch ministers, what can threaten with inconsistencies in performing that function. On the voivodship level, the supervision is performed by voivodes and heads of departments of voivodship administration upon relevant organs of administration on the level of rural district, city, quarter. Yet, competence of higher level organs is differentiated subject to tasks performed by local organs of administration. In the decentralised sphere (when organs of administration act as executive organs of people's councils), means of exercised influence are those <b>of</b> <b>supervision.</b> But if those organs act in the sphere excluded from the competence of people's councils, the means are close to hierarchical subordination. That latter influence is named governance in the Act. The differentiated influence is effected by a dual role of local organs of administration since a dualistic model of local administration (self- -governmental and governmental) is rejected in the Act.

40|$|Under Swedish tax law; {{the general}} {{clause in the}} Tax Avoidance Act is a method to prevent tax evasion. The purpose of the general clause is to prevent any tax {{avoidance}} procedures that the legislator {{has not been able}} to foresee. For the general clause to be applicable, four prerequisites need to be met. This thesis analyses the fourth prerequisite based on the principle <b>of</b> <b>legality.</b> The prerequisite concludes that a determination of the tax base, based on the procedure in question, is in conflict with the purpose of the legislation. The prerequisite has been criticized for being difficult to apply. As tax laws are applied beyond the scope of the legislation, it has also been considered that taxation is made without statutory basis, which is conflicting with the principle <b>of</b> <b>legality.</b> The principle <b>of</b> <b>legality</b> requires the application of law to be predictable and without arbitrary. Therefore, in order to collect taxes there is a requirement of legal authority. Of this requirement, it has been deduced a prohibition on application by analogy of tax laws. Of relevance to the relation between the fourth prerequisite and the principle <b>of</b> <b>legality</b> is what legal value the principle is considered to have. It has been discussed whether the principle <b>of</b> <b>legality</b> can be codified in the constitution. It has been found that the principle <b>of</b> <b>legality</b> is expressed in the Instrument of Government. It is not considered to be any controversies between the fourth prerequisite and the principle <b>of</b> <b>legality,</b> as there is a legal authority for the taxation that occurs under the general clause. It is also not considered to be any illicit delegations, as the courts only rule on whether the practice is in contrast to tax legislation purposes, and not legislate. The taxpayer therefore has to take the purpose of the legislation into consideration when measures are taken for tax avoidance purposes...|$|R
