For Inertial Confinement Fusion research, a batch of several 1 - 2 mm diameter inertial fusion target shells are grown using several <b>sputter</b> <b>coaters</b> that run for 2 - 3 weeks and use 2 - 3 targets per gun. As the targets are consumed, a well documented ring or "race track" indentation develops on the target surface. The changing geometry of the target has been shown to affect the operating parameters of the sputter gun, as well as the quality of the deposition. Current methods do not achieve the quality and reproducibility that specifications demand. The purpose of this thesis is to characterize the sputtering process as it evolves through the life of a target, to better understand the sputtering process and ultimately to provide the means to produce higher quality, reproducible shells. Several production <b>sputter</b> <b>coaters</b> were automated to provide enhanced control and process data as a function of time. An experiment was then conducted that documented the deposition from an unused copper target through 90 % of its initial thickness in three separate runs. It was found that the sputter yield matches with the empirical calculation, and is determined by the cathode voltage. The distribution of coated material for small theta; retains the cosine to the fourth power dependence, even as the sputter yield decreases with increasing target erosion. As the target erodes, the sputtered material is focused around small theta; because of changing target geometry and resputtering...|$|R

In {{order to}} solve the {{traditional}} problems such as long designing cycle and high designing cost, the research applies the virtual simulation technology {{to the design of}} cathode target on magnetron <b>sputtering</b> vacuum <b>coater.</b> Through analyzing, modeling and simulating, the process model of a typical cathode target on magnetron <b>sputtering</b> <b>coater</b> is proposed.

40|$|For {{large area}} {{architectural}} coatings such as Low-E or solar control systems strong demands on color uniformity {{are to be}} fulfilled. Typically, a precision of delta a*, delta b* < +- 1 is required. For single-Ag based Low-E coatings this implies a film thickness tolerance of about +- 2 %, while for double or multi-AG low-E coatings the thickness variation should be less than +- 1 %. A common problem of in-line <b>sputter</b> <b>coaters</b> is a certain film thickness deviation of about 2 % along the glass transport direction. It is caused by varying flow conditions due to the glass substrate movement within the compartments. In order to solve this problem, we performed a three dimensional Monate Carlo gas flow simulation of a jumbo sized sputter compartment together with adjacent pumping compartments and glass transport slots. The sputter compartment comprises two 3. 83 m sized twin rotatable magnetrons equipped with Zn-targets. Based on the Monte Carlo simulation, a heuristic model of the reactive ZnO sputtering process has been implemented. Experimental verification shows that this model properly describes (i) the pressure with respect to substrate position, (ii) the ZnO target voltage vs. oxygen flow charcteristics at different conditions as well as (iii) the film thickness profile on a substrate after dynamic deposition. This model is a starting point towards novel controlling algorithms which allow for film thickness homogeneity better than 1 % within jumbo sized in-line <b>sputtering</b> <b>coaters...</b>|$|R

40|$|For the {{deposition}} of dielectric thin films, dual magnetron sputtering using AC {{in the medium}} frequency range (MFDMS) is widely established. The most obvious advantages of MF over DC excitation is the long term process stability without adverse effects of an insulating coating on the anode and the reduced arcing due to self-extinction at polarity change of the MF power. Also, dense films with fine grains are preferably obtained by MF sputtering. For power supplies in industrial <b>sputter</b> <b>coaters,</b> two substantially different design approaches are available: (1) the resonant output circuit leading essentially to a sine wave excitation and (2) bipolar pulsed excitation with an essentially rectangular output waveform.

40|$|There is an {{increasing}} demand for high precision coatings on large areas via in-line reactive sputtering, which requires advanced process control techniques. Thus, an improved theoretical understanding of the reactive sputtering process kinetics is mandatory for further technical improvement. We present a detailed Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) gas flow model of an in-line <b>sputtering</b> <b>coater</b> for large area architectural glazing.

The model reveals a significant phase shift in the pressure fluctuations between the areas above the center and the edges of the substrate. This is a geometric effect and is e. g. independent of the substrate travelling direction. Consequently, a long sputtering source will observe pressure fluctuations at its center and edges, which are out of phase. For a heuristic model of the reactive sputtering process, we show that in certain cases a two-dimensional model treatment is sufficient for predicting the film thickness distribution on the moving substrate. In other cases, a strong phase shift between averaged pressure fluctuations and reactive sputtering process response is observed indicating that a three-dimensional model treatment is required for a realistic simulation of the in-line deposition process...|$|R

40|$|With {{the demand}} {{of a low}} cost and high quality TCO layer in thin films solar cell {{applications}} the need of production process for ZnO:Al films suited for large area coatings in industry became apparent. Throughout the last years strong effort {{have been made in}} order to use Al-doped ZnO films on glass as substrates for amorphous or amorphous/microcrystalline silicon solar cells. The material promises better properties compared to the conventionally used SnO 2 :F films due to the possibility of a tailored surface texture for optimized light trapping. With the rise of production capacities the first <b>sputtering</b> <b>coaters</b> for large area deposition of ZnO:Al are now being set up. On lab scale, best optical and electrical properties and etch morphologies are achieved by RF sputtering of ceramic targets. With reactive magnetron sputtering it is possible to produce high quality films on large area at low target cost, while increased demands on process control of the reactive process limit process yield and reproducibility up to now. In order to fully exploit the potential of the reactive sputtering process, the optimum operation point has to be stabilization during deposition and adjusted throughout the lifetime of the targets. Nowadays even cost efficient sintered ceramic ZnO:Al 2 O 3 targets with high conductivity can be sputtered by using DC power and thus offer an interesting alternative to the reactive process.

40|$|With {{the demand}} {{of a low}} cost and high quality TCO layer in thin film solar cell {{applications}} {{the need for a}} production process of ZnO:Al films suited for large area coatings in industry became apparent. Throughout the last years strong efforts have been made to use Al-doped ZnO films on glass as substrates for amorphous or amorphous/microcrystalline silicon solar cells. The material promises better performance at low cost especially because ZnO:Al can be roughened in order to enhance the light scattering into the cell. With the rise of production capacities first <b>sputtering</b> <b>coaters</b> for large area deposition of ZnO:Al are now being set up. Nowadays cost efficient, sintered ceramic ZnO:Al 2 O 3 targets with high conductivity can be sputtered by using DC power. At Fraunhofer IST ceramic ZnO:Al 2 O 3 (1 wt. %) targets were dc sputtered using a screening experiment design, which covered a wide interval of the main process parameters like total pressure, sputtering power and oxygen partial pressure, while substrate temperature was held constant at 300 °C. In this experiment a big influence on the target erosion was shown. During sputtering from a ceramic target, the film is damaged perpendicular to the erosion area by high energetic oxygen ion bombardment. The ions receive their energy from the potential difference between cathode and floating substrate. Their impact leads to a higher resistivity, lower mobility and a higher etching rate of the deposited layer in diluted hydrochloric acid. This counteracts the necessary properties of a TCO as front contact in a-Si/µc-Si solar cells. In order to understand and minimize these problems static imprints with a standard and a strong magnet were performed additionally. A new plane ZnO:Al 2 O 3 target was used. Comparing the position-dependent properties of the imprints, their height profiles remained similar but a huge impact on resistivity was observed depending on the target state, namely the race track depth. Options to diminish the damaging effect of oxygen were examined, in particular the use of stronger magnets for magnetron sputtering to reduce the applied target voltage. The observed film damage increases with higher target voltage, therefore both are reduced by applying a higher magnetic field. The results show a clear reduction of target voltage by 40 V by applying the same power using a stronger magnetron. Also less damage opposite the race tracks was observed. Resistivity is lowered by a factor of 1. 5 which yields better properties of ZnO:Al as front contact of thin film solar cells. Also the crystal structure and etching behavior changed positively...|$|R
