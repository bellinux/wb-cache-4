40|$|AbstractRNA-Seq {{was used}} to examine the microbial, eukaryotic, and viral {{communities}} in water catchments (‘tanks’) formed by tropical bromeliads from Costa Rica. In total, transcripts with taxonomic affiliation to a wide array of bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes, were observed, as well as RNA-viruses that appeared related to the <b>specific</b> <b>presence</b> of eukaryotes. Bacteria from 25 phyla appeared to comprise the majority of transcripts in one tank (Wg 24), compared to only 14 phyla in the other (Wg 25). Conversely, eukaryotes from only 16 classes comprised the majority of transcripts in Wg 24, compared to 24 classes in the Wg 25, revealing a greater eukaryote diversity in the latter. Given that these bromeliads had tanks of similar size (i. e. vertical oxygen gradient), and were neighboring with presumed similar light regime and acquisition of leaf litter through-fall, it is possible that pH was the factor governing these differences in bacterial and eukaryotic communities (Wg 24 had a tank pH of 3. 6 and Wg 25 had a tank pH of 6. 2). Archaeal diversity was similar in both tanks, represented by 7 orders, with the exception of Methanocellales transcripts uniquely recovered from Wg 25. Based on measures of FPKG (fragments mapped per kilobase of gene length), genes involved in methanogenesis, in addition to a spirochaete flagellin gene, were among those most highly expressed in Wg 25. Conversely, aldehyde dehydrogenase and monosaccharide-binding protein were among genes most highly expressed in Wg 24. The ability to observe <b>specific</b> <b>presence</b> of insect, plant, and fungi-associated RNA-viruses was unexpected.

In the present study, bispecific antibodies that recognize human red blood cell (RBC) and the food borne pathogen Listeria monocytogenes (L. monocytogenes) were engineered. The procedure involves initial reduction of a mixture of anti-RBC and anti-Listeria antibodies followed by gradual re-oxidation of the reduced disulphides. This facilitates association of the separated antibody chains and formation of hybrid immunoglobulins with affinity for the L. monocytogenes and human RBC. The bispecific antibodies caused the agglutination of the RBCs only in the presence of L. monocytogenes cells.

40|$|Citrus genus is {{characterized}} by a <b>specific</b> <b>presence</b> of indole metabolites deriving from the N-methylation of tryptamine and its hydroxylated form, 5 -hydroxytryptamine (serotonin), which are likely involved in plant defense mechanisms. In this study, we identified {{for the first time the}} occurrence in Citrus plants of serotonin 5 -O-β-glucoside and all its N-methylated derivatives, that is, N-methylserotonin 5 -O-β-glucoside, N,N-dimethylserotonin (bufotenine) 5 -O-β-glucoside, and N,N,N-trimethylserotonin (bufotenidine) 5 -O-β-glucoside. The identification of the glucosylated compounds was based on mass spectrometric studies, hydrolysis by glucosidase, and in some cases, comparison to authentic compounds. Beside leaves, the distribution of the glucosylated forms and their aglycones in some Citrus species was evaluated in flavedo, albedo, juice, and seeds. The simultaneous presence of serotonin and its N-methylated derivatives, together with the corresponding glucosylated forms, is consistent with the occurrence of a metabolic pathway, specific for Citrus, aimed at potentiating the defensive response to biotic stress through the optimization of the production and use of the most toxic of such metabolites...|$|R
40|$|Summary The {{occurrence}} {{and distribution}} of (1, 4) -β-galac-tan in wood cells of poplar (Populus trichocarpa Torr. & A. Gray × P. koreana Rehder) were studied by immunolabeling with a monoclonal antibody (LM 5) specific to this carbohy-drate epitope. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed ex-clusive binding of the LM 5 antibody to tension wood fibers, in-dicating the <b>specific</b> <b>presence</b> of (1, 4) -β-galactan in cell walls of this wood cell type. Higher magnifications achieved with the fluorescence microscope and additional immunogold electron microscopy showed that the binding of the LM 5 antibody was mainly restricted to a narrow cell wall area between the gelati-nous G-layer and the secondary cell wall. This labeling pattern strongly suggests a role of (1, 4) -β-galactan in cross-linking the G-layer and secondary cell wall. Furthermore, the exclusive lo-calization of (1, 4) -β-galactan in tension wood strengthens the view that this carbohydrate epitope {{can be considered a}} highly specific marker of reaction wood formation in mechanically stressed trees...|$|R
40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{discusses the}} occurrences {{and implications of}} an exhausted body and its encounters with its witnesses. The phenomenon is studied as a <b>specific</b> performance <b>presence</b> that can be located across cultures and centuries. The study proposes {{that the impact of}} such a body lies within a central paradox: virtuosity and disappearance. Through this paradox, the exhausted body becomes a vehicle for transformation for the performer and witness. The destructive qualities inherent in a body in extreme tension, in pain, or on the verge of death are seen as tools with which the body becomes a channel for new experiences. New life emerges from the seemingly exhausted vehicle. This idea is discussed by using case-studies from different practices around the world; from the ancient rituals of Sarpam Thullal in India to the more contemporary practices of Performance Art by artists such as Orlan and Marina Abramovic. The aesthetic and cultural theory made use of in this dissertation range across cultures; from Japanese aesthetic theory to Catholic ideology to Eugenio Barba?s cross-cultural study of the extra-daily body. The {{purpose of this study is}} not to analyse the cultural or historical roots of the performance presence of the exhausted body. Instead, it seeks to shed light on this body as a <b>specific</b> <b>presence</b> that is deliberately put into action in performance. The first three chapters: The exhausted body as an act of resistance, its relationship with the community, and its ability for transformation, discusses the different components in the encounter between the exhausted body and its witnesses.

To further validate this concept, EcPV 2 -neutralizing serum antibody titers were determined by an EcPV 2 pseudovirion (PsV) neutralization assay. Furthermore, an EcPV 2 L 1 virus-like particle (VLP) -based vaccine was generated and its prophylactic efficacy evaluated in vivo. All 6 / 6 gSCC-affected, but only 3 / 20 tumor-free age-matched animals revealed EcPV 2 -neutralizing serum antibody titers by PsV assay. Vaccination of NZW rabbits and BalbC mice with EcPV 2 L 1 VLP using Freund׳s or alum respectively as adjuvant induced high-titer neutralizing serum antibodies (1600 – 12, 800). Passive transfer with rabbit EcPV 2 –VLP immune sera completely protected mice from experimental vaginal EcPV 2 PsV infection. These findings support the impact of EcPV 2 in equine gSCC development and recommend EcPV 2 L 1 VLP as prophylactic vaccine against EcPV 2 infection and associated disease in equids...|$|R

40|$|I hereby {{submit the}} above-titled {{manuscript}} {{for publication in}} Frontiers in Plant Science. The research reported is original and novel. No {{part of it is}} submitted for publication elsewhere. We report on regulation and interactions of a unique histidine sensor kinase, Hik 2. Hik 2 is found in all known cyanobacteria, but has no previously identified functional response regulator. Here we show that it transfers phosphate rapidly, in vitro, to two response regulators, termed Rre 1 and RppA. Hik 2 is of special importance in being indispensable to cyanobacteria, and in being the closest cyanobacterial homologue of the uniquely conserved Chloroplast Sensor Kinase (CSK), which couples photosynthetic electron transport to gene transcription. Hik 2 function is so important that it has survived the transition from cyanobacterium to eukaryotic sub-cellular organelle. Hik 2 {{is likely to be a}} redox sensor involved in adjustment of the stoichiometry of photosystems I and II of oxygenic photosynthesis. We show that Hik 2 also responds to the <b>specific</b> <b>presence</b> of sodium ions. These regulatory controls and the bifurcated signal transduction pathway indicated by two response regulators lead to a proposal for integration of photosynthetic light-acclimation with response to salt stress...|$|R
40|$|We have {{examined}} the influence of RNA upon the interaction of Gag-Pol with Gag during human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) assembly. COS 7 cells were transfected with protease-negative HIV- 1 proviral DNA, and Gag/Gag-Pol complexes were detected by coimmunoprecipitation with anti-integrase. In COS 7 cells, Gag/Gag-Pol is found almost entirely in pelletable, membrane-bound complexes. Exposure of cells to 1 % Triton X- 100 releases Gag/Gag-Pol from bulk membrane, but the complexes remain pelletable. The role of RNA in facilitating the interaction between Gag and Gag-Pol was examined in these bulk membrane-free, pelletable complexes. The <b>specific</b> <b>presence</b> of viral genomic RNA {{is not required to}} maintain the Gag/Gag-Pol interaction, but some type of RNA is, since exposure to RNase destabilized the Gag/Gag-Pol complex. When present only in Gag, the nucleocapsid mutation R 7 R 10 K 11 S, which inhibits Gag binding to RNA, inhibits the formation of both Gag and Gag/Gag-Pol complexes. When present only in Gag-Pol, this mutation has no effect upon complex formation.

We determined the effect of SSc IgGs on the muscarinic receptor activation by bethanechol (BeCh; methyl derivate of carbachol) in SMC and smooth muscle strips from rat internal anal sphincter. IgGs were purified from GI-symptomatic SSc patients and normal volunteers, with protein G-Sepharose columns. SMC lengths were determined via computerized digital micrometry. The presence of M 3 -R and IgG-M 3 -R complex was determined by Western blot.

Nevertheless, very little information is available on the glycoconjugate components of this extra-embryonic structure. In the present study, we investigated by lectin histochemistry, the glycosylation pattern expressed in the CAM epithelia during embryonic development. Occurrence of sialic acid-associated glycoproteins was detailed by either specific lectins, which discriminate alpha 2, 3 and alpha 2, 6 sialoderivatives, or sialidase digestion combined with appropriate lectins to identify the sialic acid acceptor sugars. Lectin affinities proved to depend greatly on differentiation of the CAM epithelia which showed highest expression of binding sites {{during the second half of}} incubation up to hatching. Differences emerged between the chorionic and the allantoic epithelium, regarding qualitative, quantitative and temporal expression of sugar moieties. A cell type-specific distribution of glycocomponents was found in the chorionic epithelium where lectin binding sites were specifically located in the villus cavity cells. In the allantoic epithelium, high and heterogeneous occurrence of sialoglycoconjugates as well as <b>specific</b> <b>presence</b> of fucose residues were evidenced mostly in the granule cells.

40|$|The {{specific}} phenotype {{of mature}} differentiated beta cells not only {{depends on the}} <b>specific</b> <b>presence</b> of genes that allow beta cell function {{but also on the}} selective absence of housekeeping genes ("disallowed genes") that would interfere with this function. Recent studies have shown that both histone modifications and DNA methylation via the de novo methyltransferase DNMT 3 A are involved in repression of disallowed genes in neonatal beta cells when these cells acquire their mature phenotype. It is unknown, however, if the environmental influence of advanced age, pregnancy and the metabolic stress of high fat diet or diabetes could alter the repression of disallowed genes in beta cells. In the present study, we show that islet disallowed genes-which are also deeply repressed in FACS-purified beta cells-remain deeply repressed in animals of advanced age and in pregnant females. Moreover, the stability of this repression was correlated with strong and stable histone repression marks that persisted in islets isolated from 2 year old mice and with overall high expression of Dnmt 3 a in islets. Furthermore, repression of disallowed genes was unaffected by the metabolic stress of high fat diet. However, repression of about half of the disallowed genes was weakened in 16 week-old diabetic db/db mice. In conclusion, we show that the disallowed status of islet genes is stable under physiological challenging conditions (advanced age, pregnancy, high fat diet) but partially lost in islets from diabetic animals...|$|R
