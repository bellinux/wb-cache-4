40|$|A {{potential}} {{scenario for}} retrieving saltcake from single shell tanks is the ''Rainbird{reg_sign} sprinkler'' method. Water is distributed evenly {{across the surface}} of the saltcake and allowed to percolate by gravity through the waste. The salt dissolves in the water, forming a saturated solution. The saturated liquid is removed by a saltwell pump situated near the bottom of the tank. By this method, there is never a large inventory of liquid in the tank that could pose a threat of leakage. There are many variables or factors that can influence the hydrodynamics of this retrieval process. They include saltcake porosity; saltwell pumping rate; salt dissolution chemistry; factors that could promote flow channeling (e. g. tank walls, dry wells, inclusions or discontinuities in the saltcake); method of water distribution; plug formation due to crystal formations or accumulation of insoluble solids. A brief literature search indicates that very little experimental data exist on these aspects of saltcake dissolution (Wiersma 1996, 1997).

40|$|Efficient use {{of water}} in {{irrigated}} agriculture is as important in areas of plentiful water supply {{as it is in}} water-short areas. Much of the water delivered to the farm for irrigation is lost while applying it to the land because of the system management practices followed. Field-water application efficiency is the precentage of water delivered to a field that is stored in the soil within the root zone of the growing crop. Factors affecting field-water application efficiency in irrigation are climate, soil, crop, water supply, topography, method of irrigation, irrigation system design, and irrigation system operation. Water is applied to the land by four general methods: flooding, furrows, sprinkler, and subirrigation. Each of these methods has charactersitic water losses, but all losses can be classified under evaporation, deep percolation, or runoff. Water-application efficiency studies have been conducted at a number of locations in the United States.

The irrigation methods included traditional flooding (through basins and furrows) and micro irrigation (through trickle and sprinklers). The soil samples were collected at 0. 3, 0. 6, 0. 9 and 1. 2 m depths for nitrate nitrogen analysis. The results from two-year study showed high NO 3 -N concentrations at all sampling depths under basin and furrow methods, which {{could be attributed to}} free percolating water under these methods. In contrast, the NO 3 -N concentrations remained concentrated only in the top 0. 3 and 0. 6 m depths under trickle and <b>sprinkler</b> irrigation <b>methods</b> due to insignificant water movement towards deeper depths.

Results show that leaf area index (LAI) of winter wheat was greater and active leaf area lasted for longer in the sprinkler than in the surface irrigated field. Above-ground biomass at harvest was 4 similar to 22. 1 % greater in the sprinkler than in the surface irrigated field, similarly the yield was greater by 11. 5 similar to 50. 9 %. The greater yield was mainly due to the greater weight of 1000 kernels in the sprinkler irrigated field. Seasonal crop evapotranspiration (ET) was lower by 4 similar to 23 %, water productivity (WP) was higher by 18 similar to 57 % and irrigation water productivity (IWP) was higher by 21 similar to 81 % in the sprinkler field than in the surface irrigated field.

Three tillage systems were used [...] till-plant (T), disk (D), and subtill (S) which was till-plant with subsoiling between rows with straight single shanks, 360 mm deep, after last cultivation. The soil was a Sharpsburg silty clay loam (fine, montmorillonitic, mesic Typic Argiudolls). Runoff was measured from two plots representing each tillage system under the span between towers 9 and 10 for HPI, LPI, and LPS. Hand samples of water were taken at specific time intervals during runoff events for sediment and nutrient analysis. The greatest average annual sediment yield within each irrigation system was for D tillage treatment (148 kg ha- 1) and smallest was for S tillage treatment (2 kg ha- 1). Total nitrogen in runoff followed a pattern similar to sediment with a range from 0. 86 to 0. 01 kg ha-I for D and S tillage, respectively. Runoff as a percentage of irrigation water applied for irrigation systems ranked LPS 3 ̆e LPI 3 ̆e HPI. Tractor wheel trafficked rows accounted for majority of the runoff...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to compare different irrigation methods based upon a parametric evaluation system in an area of 45, 000 ha in the Ramhormoz plain located in the Khuzestan Province, in the southwest of Iran. The soil properties of the study area such as texture, depth, electrical conductivity, drainage, calcium carbonate content and slope were derived from a semi-detailed soil study carried out on the Ramhormoz plain on a scale of 1 : 20, 000. Once the soil properties were analyzed and evaluated, suitability maps were generated for surface, sprinkler and drip irrigation methods using Remote Sensing (RS) Techniques and Geographic Information System (GIS). The results demonstrated that by applying sprinkler irrigation instead of surface and drip irrigation methods, the arability of 39, 625 ha (87. 98 %) in the Ramhormoz Plain will improve. In addition by applying drip Irrigation instead of surface and <b>sprinkler</b> irrigation <b>methods,</b> the land suitability of 2925 ha (6. 57 %) of this Plain will improve. The comparison of the different types of irrigation techniques revealed that the sprinkler and drip irrigations methods were more effective and efficient than the surface irrigation methods for improving land productivity. However, the main limiting factor in using surface irrigation methods in this area were salinity, drainage and carbonate content and the main limiting factor in using sprinkler and drip irrigation methods in this area were salinity and carbonate content...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the effectiveness of irrigation water use in HayraboluIrrigation Scheme, established in 1987 and transferred to irrigation cooperative. The study was completed intwo years in order to minimize the meteorological and environmental effects on evapotranspiration andirrigation water requirement. Irrigation application efficiency and sufficiency of farmer irrigation applicationwere investigated at 20 different farmers’ fields. Pressurized irrigation was prevailed (51 %) and irrigation efficiency for <b>sprinkler</b> and surfaceirrigation <b>methods</b> were 61 and 62 %, respectively. Irrigation water losses on the scheme basis was 11, 91 %. It was further determined that farmers irrigated their crops according to the phonological observation, did nottake the permissible consumption level of water content and applied insufficient water to satisfy the fieldcapacity. Among the predominantly grown crops, wheat and sunflower were not irrigated assuming that theprecipitation was sufficient to meet their demand while onion and corn were under-supplied. Generally, aneffective irrigation programme was not realised...|$|R
40|$|Many recent {{reviews and}} meta-analyses of N 2 O {{emissions}} {{do not include}} data from Mediterranean studies. In this paper we present a meta-analysis of the N 2 O emissions from Mediterranean cropping systems, and propose a more robust and reliable regional emission factor (EF) for N 2 O, distinguishing the effects of water management, crop type, and fertilizer management. The average overall EF for Mediterranean agriculture (EF Med) was 0. 5 %, which is substantially lower than the IPCC default value of 1 %. Soil properties had no significant effect on EFs for N 2 O. Increasing the N fertilizer rate led to higher EFs; when N was applied at rates greater than 400 kgNha - 1, the EF did not significantly differ from the 1 % default value (EF: 0. 82 %). Liquid slurries led to emissions that did not significantly differ from 1 %; the other fertilizer types were lower but did not significantly differ from each other. Rain-fed crops in Mediterranean regions have lower EFs (EF: 0. 27 %) than irrigated crops (EF: 0. 63 %). Drip irrigation systems (EF: 0. 51 %) had 44 % lower EF than <b>sprinkler</b> irrigation <b>methods</b> (EF: 0. 91 %). Extensive crops, such as winter cereals (wheat, oat and barley), had lower EFs (EF: 0. 26 %) than intensive crops such as maize (EF: 0. 83 %). For flooded rice, anaerobic conditions likely led to complete denitrification and low EFs (EF: 0. 19 %). Our results indicate that N 2 O emissions from Mediterranean agriculture are overestimated in current national greenhouse gas inventories and that, with the new EF determined from this study, the effect of mitigation strategies such as drip irrigation {{or the use of}} nitrification inhibitors, even if highly significant, may be smaller in absolute terms. </p...|$|R

In the movie Backdraft, Robert De Niro plays a senior fire investigator {{who claims to}} his young eager apprentice that "Fire is a living, breathing, thing that must be treated with respect to understand. " Some anthropologists suggest that early humans discovered fire through spontaneous combustion. The arrangement of decaying organic matter may {{have been enough to}} generate a small fire. Conventional anthropologists argue that fire may have been first discovered in forest fires started by lightning, lava flows or other natural causes. Fire is real and must be controlled. An area to best control and minimize its destructive effects is during the design process. The design concerns for fire include: Control of ignition Control means of escape; Detection Control Spread of fire; Prevention of structure collapse. Prior to controlling the spread of fire one must be able to predict its behavior. One promising method for doing this is with computer modeling. This technology was used by the US Navy in a unique government/industry partnership in analyzing fire in aircraft hangars. With the high cost of modern aircraft, detector and <b>sprinkler</b> activation <b>methods</b> were evaluated to determine a quicker response to small fires with the benefit of reducing damage to aircraft adjacent to the fire source. Along with full scale experiments - computer modeling played a role in formulating new approaches. The computer model should simulate the response of the facility fire control system for the fire. The simulation can be used to evaluate weaknesses in the fire control system. In the long term to make this simulation capability accessible to the architect or engineer from the desk top. Consequently, the user would choose components for parameters to run a fire hazard scenario and see its predicte[URL]...|$|R
