50|$|A split S2 is {{a finding}} <b>upon</b> <b>auscultation</b> of the S2 heart sound.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Upon</b> <b>auscultation</b> of {{the heart}} sounds, [...] a {{systolic}} ejection murmur may be heard that is attributed to the pulmonic valve, due to the increased flow of blood through the pulmonic valve rather than any structural abnormality of the valve leaflets.|$|R
25|$|<b>Upon</b> <b>auscultation</b> of an {{individual}} with mitral stenosis, the first heart sound is usually loud and may be palpable (tapping apex beat) because of increased force in closing the mitral valve. The first heart sound is made by the mitral and tricuspid heart valves closing. These are normally synchronous, and the sounds are termed M1 and T1, respectively. M1 becomes louder in mitral stenosis. It {{may be the most}} prominent sign.|$|R
40|$|Short, high-pitched sounds (‘snaps’ or ‘clicks’) are a {{frequent}} finding <b>upon</b> <b>auscultation</b> of both symptomatic and entirely asymptomatic patients with heart disease. These sounds very frequently indicate structural {{changes in the}} valves. While these changes {{may or may not}} be of hemodynamic significance, the patient is at considerable risk of infective endocarditis in many of these disorders. Patients presenting with these sounds should, in most cases, be advised to have antibiotics prior to any dental or surgical manipulation...|$|R
50|$|<b>Upon</b> <b>auscultation</b> of an {{individual}} with mitral valve prolapse, a mid-systolic click, followed by a late systolic murmur heard best at the apex is common. The length of the murmur signifies the time period over which blood is leaking back into the left atrium, known as regurgitation. A murmur that lasts throughout the whole of systole {{is known as a}} holo-systolic murmur. A murmur that is mid to late systolic, although typically associated with less regurgitation, can still be associated with significant hemodynamic consequences.|$|R
50|$|<b>Upon</b> <b>auscultation,</b> {{the heart}} murmur will sound {{similar to the}} murmur of aortic stenosis. However, a murmur due to HCM will {{increase}} in intensity with any maneuver that decreases the volume {{of blood in the}} left ventricle (such as standing abruptly or the strain phase of a Valsalva maneuver). Administration of amyl nitrite will also accentuate the murmur by decreasing venous return to the heart. Classically, the murmur is also loudest at the left parasternal edge, 4th intercostal space, rather than in the aortic area.|$|R
5000|$|A pericardial {{friction}} rub, also pericardial rub, is {{an audible}} medical sign {{used in the}} diagnosis of pericarditis. [...] <b>Upon</b> <b>auscultation,</b> this <b>sign</b> is an extra heart sound of to-and-fro character, typically with three components, ONE systolic and TWO diastolic. It resembles the sound of squeaky leather and often is described as grating, scratching, or rasping. The sound seems {{very close to the}} ear and may seem louder than or may even mask the other heart sounds. The sound usually is best heard between the apex and sternum but may be widespread.|$|R
50|$|Inhalation {{pressure}} causes {{an increase}} in the venous blood return to {{the right side of the}} heart by decreasing intrathoracic negative pressure making it more negative (pulling blood into the right side of the heart via a vacuum-like effect). Therefore, right-sided murmurs generally increase in intensity with inhalation. The increased (more negative) intrathoracic pressure has an opposite effect on the left side of the heart, making it harder for the blood to exit into circulation. Therefore, left-sided murmurs generally decrease in intensity during inhalation. Inhalation can also produce a non-pathological split S2 which will be heard <b>upon</b> <b>auscultation.</b>|$|R
50|$|Almost 75% {{of people}} have {{symptoms}} for {{less than two months}} before seeking medical attention. A flu-like illness, with a cough, fever, a feeling of illness (malaise), fatigue, and weight loss heralds the onset in about 40% of patients. Doctors do not find any specific abnormalities on routine laboratory tests or on a physical examination, except for the frequent presence of crackling sounds (called rales) <b>upon</b> <b>auscultation</b> with a stethoscope by the care provider. Pulmonary function tests usually show that the amount of air the lungs can hold is below normal. The amount of oxygen in the blood is often low at rest and is even lower with exercise.|$|R
2500|$|Inhalation {{decreases}} intrathoracic pressure {{which allows}} more venous blood {{to return to}} the right heart (pulling blood into {{the right side of the}} heart via a vacuum-like effect). Therefore, right-sided heart murmurs generally increase in intensity with inhalation. The decreased (more negative) intrathoracic pressure has an opposite effect on the left side of the heart, making it harder for the blood to exit into circulation. Therefore, left-sided murmurs generally decrease in intensity during inhalation. Increasing venous blood return to the right side of the heart by raising a patient's legs to a 45-degree while lying supine produces similar effect which occurs during inhalation. Inhalation can also produce a non-pathological split S2 which will be heard <b>upon</b> <b>auscultation.</b>|$|R

40|$|Background: Nasogastric tube (NG tube) usage {{was first}} {{described}} in 1921 by Levin. Surgeons routinely use NG tube in most esophageal resections. Considering the numerous complications caused by this tube, the uncertainty about its usefulness and {{the scarcity of}} studies conducted on the subject, particularly in esophageal cancer patients, we investigated the necessity of the NG tube in these cases. Methods: This clinical trial was performed at the Cancer Institute of Imam Khomeini Hospital. Esophageal cancer patients were randomized into groups either with or without postoperative NG tube; the latter group was also prescribed metoclopramide. Postoperative obstruction was the exclusion criteria. The operation was done {{by a team of}} surgeons using the surgical techniques of McKeown or Orringer. All patients received ranitidine, heparin and antibiotics postoperatively. All patients received postoperative chest X-ray and chest physiotherapy. The NG tube was inserted or reinserted for those with abdominal distention and/or repeated vomiting. The NG tube was pulled out after return of bowel movements. The variables recorded for each patient included the first day of flatus, the first day of defecation, the first day of bowel sound (BS) <b>upon</b> <b>auscultation,</b> duration of post-operative hospitalization, nausea and vomiting, abdominal distension, pulmonary complications, wound complications, anastomotic leakage and the need for placing/replacing the NG tube. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS, v. 11. 5. Results: After randomization, the NG tube was inserted for 22 patients, and 18 patients had no NG tube. The incidence of anastomotic leakage was significantly higher in the NG-tube group. No {{significant differences between the two}} groups were found for other complications. The mean times until first passage of flatus, defecation and BS <b>upon</b> <b>auscultation</b> and the duration of post-operative hospitalization were not significantly different. The need for placing/replacing the NG tube was the same for both groups. There was no difference in the perioperative death rates between the two groups. Conclusions: We conclude that the routine use of NG tubes after surgery is not recommended for all patients. NG tube should be used according to the specific needs of each patient. This protocol will protect patients from undesired complications...|$|R

40|$|<b>Upon</b> <b>auscultation,</b> cardiac dysrhythmias can be suspected, but {{electrocardiography}} is {{the ultimate}} diagnostic tool. Electrocardiogram (ECG) recording used to be reserved to specialized centers, but nowadays relatively cheap and small recorders are available to the practitioner in the field. ECGs can therefore be recorded ambulatory and during prolonged periods at rest or even during exercise. The know-how of a good quality recording is mandatory for a correct diagnosis. The basic equipment consists of electrodes, a recorder {{and a way to}} display the trace. Self-adhesive electrodes should be used, and positioned along the mean electrical axis of the heart. Small recording devices offer the advantage of allowing recordings during exercise. As the electrical impulse spreads through the heart, the ECG trace shows successively a P wave, a QRS complex and a T wave. T-a waves are not always clearly visible in horses. The positioning of the electrodes may differ for ambulatory, exercise or long-term resting recordings. However, as long as the electrodes are positioned along the mean electrical axis, their exact position is not of crucial importance...|$|R
