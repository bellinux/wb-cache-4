5000|$|The Armenian {{cucumber}}, Cucumis melo var. flexuosus, {{is a type}} of long, slender fruit which {{tastes like}} a cucumber and looks somewhat like a cucumber inside. It is actually a variety of muskmelon (C. melo), a species closely related to the cucumber (C. sativus). It is also known as the yard-long cucumber, <b>snake</b> <b>cucumber,</b> snake melon, and uri in Japan. It {{should not be confused with}} the snake gourds (Trichosanthes spp.). The skin is very thin, light green, and bumpless. It has no bitterness and the fruit is almost always used without peeling. It is also sometimes called a [...] "gutah".|$|E
40|$|Page(s) : 10 (1), 64 - 76, 17 Ref. A {{powdery mildew}} species of tomato and sowthistle (Sonchus cornutus) was {{identified}} as Erysiphe sp., based on anamorph characteristics. The pathogen is ectophyte; conidia are ellipsoid and formed singly on unbranched conidiophores; fibrosin bodies were not present, and vacuoles were observed. Tomato was not extensively colonized by Erysiphe sp. compared to Leveillula taurica. Erysiphe sp. is pathogenic to <b>snake</b> <b>cucumber</b> and okra but not cocklebur (Xanthium stramonium), and cross infection was achieved between these host plants. Leveillula taurica was restricted to tomato and okra, whereas Sphaerotheca fuliginea caused powdery mildew of <b>snake</b> <b>cucumber,</b> okra and cocklebur. Reciprocal inoculation between these crops demonstrated cross infectivity, but conidia from cocklebur failed to infect any of the tested plant species except its original host. Sowthistle poses a great risk to tomato production, while cocklebur probably {{does not have any}} significant role in natural occurrence of tomato powdery mildew and that of other vegetables.

40|$|During 1992 and 1993 growing seasons, 385 cucurbit plant samples showing virus like {{symptoms}} {{have been}} collected {{for the purpose of}} identifying nine viruses that might cause cucurbit diseases in Riyadh, Gassim and Hail regions. The direct or indirect ELISA and agar double diffusion tests have been used for the identification. All the nine plant viruses to which the tests were performed have been identified in the central area of Saudi Arabia (Riyadh, Gassim and Hail regions). The zucchini yellow mosaic virus (ZYMV) was identified from all cultivated cucurbit species : cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.), melon (Cucumis melo L.), watermelon (Citrullus lanatus Thunb.), pumpkin (Cucurbita maxima Duch.), squash (Cucurbita pepo L.), bottlegourd (Lagenaria siceraria L.) and <b>snake</b> <b>cucumber</b> (Cucumis melo var flexuoses). The squash mosaic virus (SMV), watermelon mosaic virus- 1 (WMV- 1) which is known as papaya ringspot virus (PRSV) were identified from all previously mentioned cucurbit species except from bottlegourd, pumpkin and <b>snake</b> <b>cucumber</b> respectively. The watermelon mosaic virus- 2 (WMV- 2) was identified from all species except pumpkin and <b>snake</b> <b>cucumber.</b> The prune dwarf virus (PDV) has been identified from cucumber, melon, squash, and pumpkin. The cucumber green mottle mosaic virus (CGMMV) was identified from watermelon, melon, and bottlegourd. The cucumber leaf spot virus (CLSV) was identified from the plants of squash, pumpkin and bottlegourd, while the beet western yellows virus (BtWYV) was identified from the bottlegourd plants only. The results of this study confirmed that the ZYMV was the most detected virus affecting all the cucurbit species in the different locations of the central area of Saudi Arabia, with 60. 5 % of detection. The lowest detection percentage (0. 5 %) was observed with BtWYV. The immunological tests revealed that most of the tested samples had mixed infections, also it revealed that about 25. 7 % of these samples gave negative reactions to all of the tested viruses. This is the first complete and comprehensive study on viruses that infect cucurbits in Riyadh, Gassim and Hail regions which together form the central area of Saudi Arabia. In this study, the WMV- 1 was identified in the central area for the first time,while four cucurbit viruses which include BtWYV, CLSV, PDV and WMV- 2 were identified for the first time not only in the central area alone, but in Saudi Arabia as a whole...|$|E
5000|$|String Greenhouse (formerly the Production Greenhouse) - This {{greenhouse}} {{focuses on}} innovative high-density techniques, such as Nutrient film technique. It also shows off [...] "vertical growing techniques", in which plants are grown on specialized trellises which cause the herbaceous plants to approximate {{the shape and}} structure of trees. One {{of the most famous}} examples of these trees is The Land's [...] "tomato tree", which produced over 32,000 tomatoes in a 16-month period. It was recognized by Guinness World Records as both the largest and most productive tomato plant in the world. Other crops include eggplant, peppers, winged bean, lettuce and <b>snake</b> gourd. Furthermore, <b>cucumbers</b> and pumpkins are grown in the shape of Mickey Mouse through the use of special molds. Much of the produce grown in the String Greenhouse is used in The Garden Grill and Sunshine Seasons, both restaurants in The Land pavilion. In total, over 30 tons of produce are harvested from The Land each year.|$|R
40|$|Page(s) : 2 (2), 67 - 82, 10 RefA {{survey was}} {{conducted}} in eastern, central and western parts of the Sudan to determine the major viruses affecting various cucurbit crops (<b>snake</b> <b>cucumber,</b> melon, watermelon, and squash). Of 102 samples analyzed, using DAS-ELISA, nearly 65 % were infected by cucurbit aphid-borne yellows luteovirus (CABYV), 54 % by zucchini yellow mosaic potyvirus (ZYMV) and 39 % by geminiviruses serologically related to watermelon chlorotic stunt virus (WCSV). Among other viruses identified, squash mosaic comovirus (SqMV) was detected in 15 % of the samples, a potyvirus closely related to watermelon mosaic virus type Morocco (WMV-M) in 4 % of the samples, cucumber mosaic cucumovirus (CMV) in 4 % of the samples and melon rugose mosaic tymovirus (MRMV) in 2 % of the samples. This is the first report of CABYV and ZYMV in the Sudan, and the first report of WCSV and MRMV in Africa. Khartoum University Pres...|$|E
40|$|A {{total of}} 20 brassicaceous and cucurbitaceous {{vegetable}} cultivars and hybrids, including two cabbages, three cauliflowers, one garden rocket, two radishes and one turnip, three cucumbers, three pumpkin, one <b>snake</b> <b>cucumber,</b> three sequash and one watermelon, {{were examined in}} the greenhouse for their susceptibility to the root knot nematode, Meloidogyne javanica (Treub) Chitw. Determination of host susceptibility {{was based on the}} standards and parameters documented by the International Meloidogyne Project. Most of the tested cultivars were found to susceptible to moderately susceptible and good hosts, except for white radish which was resistant and poor host to the tested nematode. Susceptible cultivars were clearly damaged by the nematode infection and roots appeared to be heavily galled. Gall index values of all tested cultivars were ranged from 2. 0 - 5. 0, whereas, reproduction factor (Rf) values and number of eggs per gram root were significantly (P ≤ 0. 05) varied among tested cultivars. They were ranged from 0. 156 - 65. 5 and 114. 0 - 27638. 2, respectively, where the minimum values are recorded for white radish and maximum ones for squash cv. Masha’el F 1...|$|E
40|$|During surveys {{carried out}} in June and October 2005 and August 2006 for {{assessing}} the occurrence of cucurbit- infecting viruses in Tunisia, samples of squash, melon and <b>snake</b> <b>cucumber</b> showing virus-like symptoms were collected from the major cucurbit-growing areas. Besides mosaic-inducing viruses, DAS-ELISA and RT-PCR tests showed the presence of yellows-inducing viruses: Cucurbit aphid-borne yellows virus (CABYV, Polerovirus), Cucurbit yellow stunting disorder virus (CYSDV, Crinivirus) and Cucumber vein yellowing virus (CVYV, Ipomovirus). While CABYV, a virus previously reported from Tunisia, was detected throughout the country, CYSDV and CVYV, reported {{here for the first}} time, were found only in the Sahel and the Southern part of the country. The identification of CYSDV and CVYV was confirmed by immunosorbent electron microscopy. Phylogenetic analysis done on parts of the CP gene sequence showed that Tunisian CYSDV isolates have high sequence identity (99 - 100 %) with isolates that have recently emerged in the Middle East, Southern Europe and the United States. In contrast, CVYV isolates from Tunisia are more divergent (96. 6 %) from Middle East isolates and are only distantly related (94. 5 - 95 %) to isolates which recently emerged in Spain, Portugal and France...|$|E
