Partici-pants completed questionnaires that included the Life Orientation Test–Revised, the COPE, the Social Provisions Scale, and the 12 -item Center for Epidemiologi-cal Studies Depression Scale. Avoidant coping and social support mediated the relation between optimism and depressive symptoms, whereas active coping did not mediate this relationship. Results partially replicate those of prior research and illustrate the need for culturally sensitive theory regarding the combined ef-fect of personality, coping strategies, and social support on psychological adjust-ment to stressful situations...|$|E

Traditional academic VOs are persistent, resourceful and have logically centralized, membership-oriented management structures. In contrast, the GRIA experience has been that business VOs are likely to be projectfocused and have distributed, process-oriented management structures. © 2005 IEEE...|$|E

40|$|Studies {{that have}} {{examined}} the association between parenting behaviors and childhood post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have yielded mixed findings. To clarify the role of parenting in childhood PTSD we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of 14 studies that investigated the association between parenting and youth PTSD symptoms (total n = 4010). Negative parenting behaviors (e. g. overprotection, hostility) accounted for 5. 3 % {{of the variance in}} childhood PTSD symptoms. Positive parenting behaviors (e. g. warmth, <b>support)</b> <b>account</b> for 2. 0 % of variance. The negative and positive parenting and child PTSD symptom associations did not statistically differ in magnitude. Moderator analyses indicated that methodological factors and trauma variables may affect the association between parenting and child PTSD. Most studies relied upon questionnaire measures of general parenting style, and studies were predominantly cross-sectional with weaker evidence found in longitudinal studies. Given the small number of high quality studies available, only provisional recommendations about the role of parenting in childhood PTSD are made...|$|E
40|$|QUESTION: How does {{a campus}} library and IT {{organization}} create a single service desk {{to provide all}} library and IT public service? BACKGROUND: At present, two service desks separately provide the UNM Health Sciences Center with 1) all library public service and 2) IT user <b>support</b> (<b>account</b> management, telephone help line, PC & mobile reimaging and repair). Library administration decided to combine those service desks at a single location and create a new unit to provide “tier one” services, effective July 1, 2011. METHODS: Managers and staffs of both desks listed all services provided and sorted out tier one services (provided on the spot by the person on duty) from tier two and above (referrals). Library administration moved seven staff into the new unit and appointed a manager (the author). Staff of the new unit collaborated on designing the work area and developing and providing cross-training. RESULTS: As of the writing of this abstract (June 2011), planning and training is well underway. CONCLUSIONS: At {{the time of the}} October 2011 SCC Annual Meeting this poster session will report the status of the new team and desk, illustrate service levels, and describe our success (and bumpy spots) in creating a truly blended library/IT unit...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{describes}} posttraumatic stress reactions in young witnesses of motor vehicle accidents (MVAs). This study investigated (a) whether witnesses of MVAs report fewer trauma symptoms than direct victims, {{but more than}} adolescents who were never exposed to an MVA; and (b) whether individual differences in sex, negative appraisal, avoidant coping, and social <b>support</b> <b>account</b> for variability in trauma symptoms beyond status as a witness as compared to a victim. Self-report data came from a community-based sample of 3, 007 adolescents {{with an average age}} of 14. 6 years and comprising 53 % boys. Compared to direct victims of an MVA in which someone was injured, witnesses of MVAs with injury reported significantly less internalizing symptoms, such as symptoms of posttraumatic stress (d = 0. 25), fear (d = 0. 21), and depression (d = 0. 17). Compared to adolescents who were never exposed to an MVA with injury, witnesses reported significantly more externalizing symptoms (d = 0. 24). In multiple regression analyses the significant difference between witnesses and victims disappeared when sex, other stressful events, appraisals, and coping were added to the model. These findings suggest that adolescent witnesses, as well as direct victims, may be at risk for posttraumatic reactions...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is twofold: (a) to see whether the {{association}} between age and perceived con-trol is the same for Blacks as well as Whites; and (b) to see if education, health, income, social support, cognitive func-tion, and religion account for the relationship between age and control in the same way for Blacks and Whites. Methods. Data for this study come from the first wave of the Americans ’ Changing Lives panel study. Complete data are available for 357 Black and 2, 792 White individuals. Respondents were asked questions about their feelings of control, health status, income, social support, cognitive function, religious participation, and demographic information. Results. The findings suggest that age has an inverse and nonlinear association with feelings of control. Moreover, this relationship is similar for Blacks and Whites. The data further reveal that, across all age groups, Blacks report a lower sense of control than Whites. Less education, less income, greater cognitive impairments, and more religiosity are associated with a lower sense of control. These factors, along with health and social <b>support,</b> <b>account</b> for 69 % of the as-sociation between age and control, with no differences according to race. Discussion. These results show that lower levels of control are associated with older age in both Blacks and Whites, and that racial disparities in feelings of control persist across all age groups. This suggests that Blacks may be at a partic-ular disadvantage in the face of the increasing challenges of aging. strong sense of personal control is essential for the maintenance of health and well-being in late lif...|$|E
40|$|Non-invasive Ventilation (NIV) has {{effectively}} {{been used in}} the treatment of Chronic Respiratory Failure (CRF) of different origin. However, there is not enough evidence to support its use in COPD and Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome (OHS). The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effect of NIV in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of patients with CRF and to identify parameters associated with changes in HRQoL. In the 1 st protocol, NIV was offered to 49 patients, of whom 22 comprised the standard treatment group whereas 27 received NIV. Quality of life was assessed with the SF- 36 questionnaire. Additional measurements included blood gases, pulmonary function tests, dyspnea, daytime sleepiness, exacerbations and hospitalizations. The NIV group showed a significant improvement in quality of life in the 3 rd month, both in the Physical (p< 0. 0001) and the Mental Component Summary Score (p= 0. 009), that was maintained until the 12 th month. PaCO 2 decreased by the 1 st month in the NIV group (p< 0. 0001), and PaO 2 rose during the 6 th month (p= 0. 004). Dyspnea and diurnal sleepiness improved significantly. No significant improvements were observed in the control group. Patients on NIV spent less days in the hospital compared to controls. In the 2 nd protocol, 91 patients with CRF (35 COPD; 17 restrictive thoracic disorders, RTD; 28 obesity-hypoventilation syndrome, OHS; 11 neuromuscular disease, NMD) participated. HRQoL was assessed with the SF- 36 questionnaire. Improvements in Physical Component Summary (PCS, p< 0. 0001) and Mental Component Summary (MCS, p< 0. 0001) scores in RTD and MCS in OHS (p= 0. 01) and COPD (p= 0. 003) were observed by the 3 rd month. PCS in OHS and COPD patients improved by the 6 th month (p= 0. 003 and p< 0. 0001 respectively). NMD patients did not present improvements in HRQoL. Improvements in HRQoL were associated with improvements in PaO 2 and dyspnea in COPD patients, and with total hours of daily ventilator use, improvement in dyspnea, pressure support and EPAP in RTD patients. Home NIV is consistently effective in improving HRQoL and physiological parameters in patients with CRF. Improvements in arterial blood gases and dyspnea, the total hours of ventilator use and the amplitude of pressure <b>support</b> <b>account</b> for the improvements seen in quality of life. ...|$|E
