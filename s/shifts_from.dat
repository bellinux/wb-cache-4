5|$|Across {{the town}} line, NY11A intersects Otisco Road (CR246) and passes several farms {{on its way}} to the hamlet of Cardiff. Here, the route runs past a line of homes prior to passing under US20 at the {{northern}} edge of the community. Outside of Cardiff, the highway becomes known as Syracuse–Tully Valley Road as it slowly curves to the northwest, matching a similar turn in the course of the creek and its valley. As the road traverses another stretch of cultivated fields, it meets Field Lane, a short connector providing access between NY11A and US20. Past this point, NY11A serves little more than farms before it enters the Onondaga Reservation. At this point, maintenance of the route <b>shifts</b> <b>from</b> the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) to the Onondaga Nation.|$|E
5|$|After leaving NY173 and the Seneca Turnpike, {{the highway}} {{heads to the}} {{northeast}} through the town of Onondaga as South Avenue. NY175 passes the Community General Hospital of Greater Syracuse and intersects with a county road before entering the Syracuse city limits. At this point, maintenance of the route <b>shifts</b> <b>from</b> NYSDOT {{to the city of}} Syracuse. In Syracuse, NY175 runs along the western edge of Saint Agnes Cemetery to an intersection with NY80 at the cemetery's north end. Much of the next area is both residential and commercial in nature, leaving the fields and forests that the route had previously followed behind.|$|E
5|$|At Lexington Avenue, NY92 {{begins to}} turn to the {{southeast}} as it heads through more residential areas of the city. At East Avenue, a local street just west of Nottingham Senior High School, a center lane begins, enabling left turns from both directions. The route passes north of the school and St. Mary's Cemetery and south of LeMoyne College before exiting the city limits. At this point, maintenance of the route <b>shifts</b> <b>from</b> Syracuse to the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT). Now in DeWitt, NY92 continues past several blocks lined with homes to an intersection with Erie Boulevard, a six-lane divided highway that carries NY5 through eastern Syracuse. The boulevard ends here, however, and NY5 turns to join NY92 eastward along Genesee Street.|$|E

5|$|Downtown, {{maintenance}} of NY10 <b>shifts</b> <b>from</b> the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) {{to the village}} at Mohawk Street. The highway remains locally owned for three blocks to Incinerator Road, where the route becomes state-maintained once more. During this stretch, NY10 intersects NY5S at Main Street. North of Incinerator Road, the route passes under the Thruway before crossing into the neighboring village of Palatine Bridge at {{the midpoint of the}} Mohawk River. On the northern riverbank, NY10 meets NY5 and overlaps the route westward for a block before continuing northward into the largely rural town of Palatine.|$|E
5|$|During {{the solar}} cycle's declining phase, energy <b>shifts</b> <b>from</b> the {{internal}} {{toroidal magnetic field}} to the external poloidal field, and sunspots diminish in number and size. At solar-cycle minimum, the toroidal field is, correspondingly, at minimum strength, sunspots are relatively rare, and the poloidal field is at its maximum strength. With {{the rise of the}} next 11-year sunspot cycle, differential rotation shifts magnetic energy back from the poloidal to the toroidal field, but with a polarity that is opposite to the previous cycle. The process carries on continuously, and in an idealized, simplified scenario, each 11-year sunspot cycle corresponds to a change, then, in the overall polarity of the Sun's large-scale magnetic field.|$|E
5|$|Dynamic editing {{contributed to}} the surrealistic nature of the episode. Abrupt cuts from {{close-up}} to extreme wide angles and sudden <b>shifts</b> <b>from</b> normal speed to super slow-motion are used in Buffy's dream: several sequences become slow-motion partway through them, then revert to normal speed as they continue. Xander's dream features mismatches between sound and image: characters are sometimes shown not speaking even as their voices are heard. Additionally, silence is used frequently, to both reflect the characters' disorientation and to unsettle the audience. Whedon cited films by Steven Soderbergh as his main inspirations for the odd editing, especially The Limey and The Underneath. He also listed Orson Welles' version of The Trial and Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut as inspirations for many of his shooting and editing decisions.|$|E

Eastwood introduces voices reminiscent of those in a horror film score during the child murder flashbacks. The score was orchestrated and conducted by Lennie Niehaus. It was released on CD in North America on , 2008, through record label Varèse Sarabande.|$|E
5|$|Inside {{the village}} limits, {{maintenance}} of NY120A <b>shifts</b> <b>from</b> {{the state to}} Westchester County, which inventories the route as CR112. Continuing on, the road narrows to two lanes ahead of Port Chester's central business district, where NY120A passes the Port Chester Public Library and the village's post office ahead of a junction with Pearl Street three blocks west of U.S. Route1 and two blocks west of the Metro-North Railroad. Here, NY120A turns off Westchester Avenue and onto North Pearl Street, becoming a village-maintained route in the process. The route's northeastward run on North Pearl Street is brief, however, as NY120A turns northwest onto King Street after just two blocks.|$|E
5|$|NY309 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with NY29A in downtown Gloversville. The route heads northward as Bleecker Street, passing large commercial buildings as it heads north through the city. At Spring Street—two blocks north of NY29A—the surroundings become more residential as the commercial structures {{are replaced by}} homes. The route continues on, crossing Cayadutta Creek between 8th Avenue and McLaren Street before leaving Bleecker Street at 11th Avenue to follow an unnamed western extension of 11th Avenue. At this point, the amount of development along NY309 drops substantially as it parallels Cayadutta Creek and heads northwestward {{out of the city}} limits. At this point, maintenance of the route <b>shifts</b> <b>from</b> the city of Gloversville to the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT).|$|E

5|$|NY418 begins just {{southwest}} of Thurman Station, a hamlet within {{the town of}} Thurman, where Athol Road <b>shifts</b> <b>from</b> county maintenance (as CR4) to state maintenance (as NY418). It heads northeastward along the base of Sugarloaf Mountain, one of the Three Sisters Mountains, as it passes an area with very little development. The route continues along a northeasterly trek to Thurman Station, where it intersects with River Road {{in the center of}} the isolated community. At this point, the route turns southeastward and crosses the Upper Hudson River Railroad at-grade before passing over the Hudson River on the Thurman Station Bridge. NY418 passes into the town of Warrensburg at the midpoint of the bridge.|$|E

Just {{north of the city}} limits, NY9L intersects NY254. The route continues northward through Queensbury, passing Floyd Bennett Memorial Airport and running parallel to the Washington County line on its way toward and eventually across the Blue Line into Adirondack Park. NY9L intersects NY149, an east–west arterial connecting Interstate87 (I-87) to Vermont, just north of the park limits.|$|E
5|$|West of {{the city}} of Watertown, NY3 intersects NY180 {{southwest}} of the Watertown International Airport before connecting to I-81 by way of an interchange at the city line. NY3 heads east into Watertown, intersecting with both US11 and NY12 at Massey Street. At this point, maintenance of NY3 <b>shifts</b> <b>from</b> the state to the city of Watertown. The route overlaps NY12 southbound and a short piece of US11 northbound through downtown to Public Square, where NY3 meets northbound NY12. US11 northbound leaves NY3 here while the overlap between NY3 and NY12 continues eastward through Watertown. The concurrency ends near the eastern fringe {{of the city}}, where NY3 leaves NY12 and becomes state-maintained once more as it departs the city to the northeast.|$|E

5|$|According to Daniel Joseph Singal, Faulkner's {{literary}} style gradually {{developed from}} 19th century Victorian to modernist, with Light in August more firmly {{grounded in the}} tradition of the latter. The novel is characteristic of the modernist fascination with polaritieslight and dark, good and evilthe burden of history on the present, and the splintering of personal identity. The plot is also divided into dual currents, one focusing on Lena Grove and the other on Joe Christmas, a technique that Faulkner continued to use in other works. The narrative is not structured in any particular order, as it is often interrupted by lengthy flashbacks and constantly <b>shifts</b> <b>from</b> one character to another. This lack of organization and narrative continuity was viewed negatively by some critics. As in his other novels, Faulkner employs elements of oral storytelling, allowing different characters to lend voice to the narrative in their own distinct Southern idiom. Unlike some of the other Yoknapatawpha County novels, notably The Sound and the Fury, Light in August does not rely solely on stream-of-consciousness narration, but also incorporates dialogue and an omniscient third-person narrator that develop the story.|$|E
5|$|Although the themes, {{events and}} {{characters}} of the Arthurian legend varied widely from text to text, {{and there is no}} one canonical version; Geoffrey's version of events often served as the starting point for later stories. Geoffrey depicted Arthur as a king of Britain who defeated the Saxons and established an empire over Britain, Ireland, Iceland, Norway and Gaul. Many elements and incidents that are now {{an integral part of the}} Arthurian story appear in Geoffrey's Historia, including Arthur's father Uther Pendragon, the wizard Merlin, Arthur's wife Guinevere, the sword Excalibur, Arthur's conception at Tintagel, his final battle against Mordred at Camlann, and final rest in Avalon. The 12th-century French writer Chrétien de Troyes, who added Lancelot and the Holy Grail to the story, began the genre of Arthurian romance that became a significant strand of medieval literature. In these French stories, the narrative focus often <b>shifts</b> <b>from</b> King Arthur himself to other characters, such as various Knights of the Round Table. Arthurian literature thrived during the Middle Ages but waned in the centuries that followed until it experienced a major resurgence in the 19th century. In the 21st century, the legend lives on, not only in literature but also in adaptations for theatre, film, television, comics and other media.|$|E
5|$|At Emerson Park, {{a public}} park {{situated}} near {{the midpoint of the}} northern lakeshore, the highway turns back to the north to access Melrose Park, a community built up just north of the lake around the Owasco Outlet. Here, NY38A meets NY437, a short connector highway linking NY38A to its parent, NY38. North of Melrose Park, the route becomes known as Owasco Street as it follows the Owasco Outlet into the city of Auburn. At the city line, ownership and maintenance of the route <b>shifts</b> <b>from</b> the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) to Auburn. The route heads northeastward through the densely populated city to Walnut Street, where it splits into a one-way couplet along Fulton Street (northbound) and John and Owasco Streets (southbound).
