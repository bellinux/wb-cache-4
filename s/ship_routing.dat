In contrast to land routing, <b>ship</b> <b>routing</b> has unique features, including overnight trips, disjoint time windows, not necessarily prespecified routes, and a great uncertainty derived from weather conditions. In this work we present a special <b>ship</b> <b>routing</b> problem, which incorporates many features present in general <b>ship</b> <b>routing</b> settings. We discuss aspects related with data gathering and updating, which are particularly difficult in the context of <b>ship</b> <b>routing.</b> Additionally, we present a GRASP algorithm to solve this problem.

40|$|The {{relevance}} of <b>ship</b> <b>routing</b> system is increasing {{according to the}} mitigation of carbon emissions and enhance the maritime safety. New generation of high-resolution meteo-oceanographic predictions provides useful tools for routing of ship. However, scientific efforts have been focused on inter-oceanic routes. This contribution investigates the economic benefits and improvement on maritime safety of <b>ship</b> <b>routing</b> of Short Sea Shipping (SSS) routes. The investigation is supported {{with the development of}} a <b>ship</b> <b>routing</b> system based on a path finding algorithm and meteo-oceanographic predications. Results show that the economic benefits using <b>ship</b> <b>routing</b> in SSS is estimated in percentage of the total cost during energetic wave episodes. The work establishes the basis of further developments in optimal route applied in relatively short-distances and its systematic use in the SSS maritime industry. In this work, the optimal <b>ship</b> <b>routing</b> analysis is investigated in a relative short distance maritime route between Barcelona and Palma de Mallorca (Spain). Dijkstra algorithm is implemented in order to obtain the optimal path under an energetic wave event. The methodology is based on the inclusion of the drag resistance due to waves. The results reveal how the wave direction has a relevant role in the optimum path due to the relative direction with the ship and the enhancement of the navigational safety.

When ship characteristics, loading conditions, ship speed, and sea conditions (wave, wind and currents) are imported to this system, together with departure and final points and departure time, a set of minimum fuel consumption routes under different ETA can be achieved. In this way, an optimal and safe enough route can be decided according to shipping schedule. A combination of global and local optimisation strategy is used in weather routing optimisation.

40|$|Fatigue cracks are {{observed}} {{much earlier than}} expected in ships and marine structures due to uncertainties in the fatigue design process, such as encountered sea environments and variability in S-N curves, etc. The current study presents the theoretical development and validation of a fatigue model useful for <b>ship</b> <b>routing</b> which may contribute to better utilisation of the materials and structures by more wise operation of them. During the theoretical development of the <b>ship</b> <b>routing</b> fatigue model, various models to estimate fatigue damage intensity, including both cycle counting calculations and spectral approximations, are reviewed. The proposed <b>ship</b> <b>routing</b> fatigue model {{is a function of}} operation profiles, i. e., heading angle and ship speed, as well as encountered wave environments (significant wave height), which are easily available in today’s commercial routing tool systems. Concerning the characteristics of ship response, the so-called narrow-band approximation is adopted and further simplified in order to estimate the fatigue damage in ships under an arbitrary stationary sea state. Long-term fatigue damage is estimated by a summation of fatigue damages in all encountered sea states during, for example, one voyage or a period of several years. Further, fatigue damage due to wave-induced vibrations (whipping and springing) and fatigue damage caused by various stress components are also studied and discussed. A validation using response from full-scalemeasurements and numerical analysis is presented. It shows that the proposed model works very well in comparison with the rainflow counting method. Finally, the proposed <b>ship</b> <b>routing</b> fatigue model is applied on real case scenarios, where its applicability in shipping industry is demonstrated...|$|E

The first is that multi-commodity concept considered by this model is reduced to maximum one primary cargo and one spot cargo was taken one after the other by any ship voyage. The second is that the model does not use gross profit per day as a criterion for selecting an optimal solution. The third is that transport demand is assumed fixed.|$|E

40|$|<b>Ship</b> <b>routing</b> and {{scheduling}} {{is among the}} most important task for many shipping companies. Today, only few shipping companies use optimization-based decision support systems for routing {{and scheduling}} of their fleet. They still accomplish this task manually based on their experience. However, access to an optimization-based decision support system may be of great value for planners in shipping companies. By proper routing and scheduling of their fleets of ships the shipping companies may get the possibility to increase the income by transporting more optional spot cargoes and/or to reduce the sailing costs. This may have an important financial impact for the shipping companies in an increasingly competitive market. This thesis presents various short-term <b>ship</b> <b>routing</b> and scheduling problems faced by planners in tramp shipping companies, and proposes solution methods for solving them. The focus is on local search-based heuristic solution methods that can find good solutions to the problems within reasonable time, and hence give valuable decision support for the planners. The thesis consists of two parts. The first part gives an introduction to <b>ship</b> <b>routing</b> and scheduling problems. The second part consists of four papers that are the major contribution of this thesis. The first paper focuses on decision support for planner in shipping companies. In the second paper an efficient tabu search heuristic is described for solving the tramp <b>ship</b> <b>routing</b> and scheduling problem. Flexible cargo quantities are considered in paper 3, while split loads are introduced and discussed in paper 4.

Any enhancement in the existing ad-hoc scheduling procedure has the potential for significant savings. A mixed-integer programming model for the KPC problem is constructed in this dissertation.

40|$|There {{is a wide}} {{selection}} of methods and models {{that can be used to}} predict and monitor energy utilisation in ships. There is, however, no single model/method that can be applied generally to a vessel to increase its energy efficiency. The shipping industry faces the challenge of reducing fuel consumption and air emissions. There is a need to understand how much energy is needed and used by the entire energy system of a ship but with a resolution that can analyse this usage at a subsystem or component level. This report presents a state-of-the-art investigation of published models and methods within the research area of ship energy efficiency. Emphasis is placed on the existing models and methods for energy systems modelling (prediction, monitoring and improvements) and their applicability, strengths and weaknesses. The report also presents a review of green ship energy concepts such as wind power as auxiliary propulsion in ships, together with <b>ship</b> <b>routing</b> optimisation. The outcome of the study highlights two important issues. First, there is a need to develop a generic holistic model that would be applicable for ship energy efficiency analysis and simulations. The current state-of-the-art shows that parts of such a model exist, but they need to be combined to interact on a common basis. Second, the potential of wind power to act as auxiliary propulsion and <b>ship</b> <b>routing</b> optimisation can significantly reduce energy consumption and improve the energy efficiency of ships.
