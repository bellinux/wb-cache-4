Red, also known as jeweler's rouge, polishes without any cutting action. The blue compound is a dryer compound and is used with a grease-less wheel that also does not cut or <b>scratch</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface.</b>|$|E

25|$|Water {{sensitive}} {{objects are}} masked {{in plastic wrap}} to avoid getting wet. A slurry of precipitated (pharmaceutical grade) calcium carbonate and deionized water is created and rubbed onto the silver piece with a cotton rag or cotton ball. It is recommended that the slurry be tested on the bottom or in a non-visible area of the silver for abrasiveness. If the slurry is too abrasive it will <b>scratch</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> and increase the potential for future tarnishing. The polish is applied with a soft cloth and polished in a circular motion.|$|E

2500|$|King {{was able}} to draw well, and {{continued}} to draw throughout his life. Vincent Alessi notes of King’s European drawings that “the drawings are not merely documentary sketches of places visited. Rather they quietly <b>scratch</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface,</b> capturing the rhythm, heart and sensibilities of a location and its people. It is this aspect that best reveals King’s humanity”. Jane Eckett says that: “For Grahame King drawing represented much more than simply a means of describing the world. It {{was his way of}} learning about the world, synthesizing observation, thought, feeling and intuition.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Though their 1989 {{debut album}} Blood, Sweat and No Tears was a {{moderate}} success, Sick of It All did not achieve commercial success until later albums. After {{the release of}} their second album Just Look Around in 1992, East West Records saw the band's potential and signed them in 1993. Sick of It All's third and major label debut album, <b>Scratch</b> <b>the</b> <b>Surface,</b> was released in 1994 to critical acclaim, and included the singles [...] "Scratch the Surface" [...] and [...] "Step Down" [...] (the video for the latter single would also be featured in the 1995 Beavis and Butt-head episode [...] "Premature Evacuation"). Their 1997 follow-up Built to Last was also highly acclaimed. Despite the success of Built to Last, Sick of It All was dropped from East West and signed to Fat Wreck Chords in 1998, who released the band's next three albums before being dropped from the label in 2005, when they signed to Abacus Records, a subsidiary of Century Media. This label released their eighth studio album Death to Tyrants in 2006 to positive reviews (Abacus eventually went out of business, though Sick of It All would remain on Century Media, which released the band's next three albums). Sick of It All's latest album, The Last Act of Defiance, was released on September 30, 2014.|$|E

6000|$|But it is {{time that}} the Malthusian doctrine,--the fear of {{over-population}} as a hindrance to social reform,--was dismissed from consideration. It is at best but a worn-out scarecrow shaking its vain rags in the wind. Population, it is true, increases in a geometrical ratio. The human race, if favored by environment, can easily double itself every twenty-five years. If it did this, the time must come, through sheer power of multiplication, when {{there would not be}} standing room for it on the globe. All of this is undeniable, but it is quite wide of the mark. It is time enough to cross a bridge when we come to it. The [...] "standing room" [...] problem is still removed from us by such uncounted generations that we need give no thought to it. The physical resources of the globe are as yet only tapped, and not exhausted. We have done little more than <b>scratch</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface.</b> Because we are crowded here and there in the ant-hills of our cities, we dream that the world is full. Because, under our present system, we do not raise enough food for all, we fear that the food supply is running short. All this is pure fancy. Let any one consider in his mind's eye the enormous untouched assets still remaining for mankind in the vast spaces filled with the tangled forests of South America, or the exuberant fertility of equatorial Africa or the huge plains of Canada, Australia, Southern Siberia and the United States, as yet only thinly dotted with human settlement. There is no need to draw up an anxious balance sheet of our assets. There is still an uncounted plenty. And every human being born upon the world represents a power of work that, rightly directed, more than supplies his wants. The fact that as an infant he does not maintain himself {{has nothing to do with}} the case. This was true even in the Garden of Eden.|$|E
