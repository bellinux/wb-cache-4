The two main classes are horse plowing, and tractor plowing. Some different plowing classes for tractors include depend on how many <b>furrows</b> the <b>plow</b> has. Other tractor plowing classes include antique plowing, and 4H (youth) plowing. Plowing is [...] "judged for straightness, firmness, evenness, depth, shape and uniformity. A good <b>plowed</b> <b>furrow</b> must be straight with a smooth trough and clean, even sides." ...|$|R

40|$|Inter-furrow {{infiltration}} variability {{is often}} ignored during the evaluation and optimisation of furrow irrigation. Existing techniques for estimating infiltration parameters are generally too intensive in measurement and computation for routine application {{at the field}} scale and have therefore primarily been used to study the behaviour of <b>single</b> <b>furrows.</b> This paper identifies the inter-furrow infiltration variation within typical furrow-irrigated fields and determines that this variation can be adequately described using a log-normal distribution. A procedure to predict whole field furrow infiltration characteristics using minimum field measurements is then presented. The technique uses a single advance measurement for <b>single</b> <b>furrows</b> and the log-normal probability distribution to predict the statistical distribution of infiltration functions across the field {{based on the measured}} infiltration curve for one or more fully evaluated furrows. This technique also considers the infiltration curve over appropriate ranges of opportunity time. Simulations using the predicted infiltration parameters demonstrate more accurate estimates of the whole field efficiency and uniformity than those extrapolated from infiltration measurements on a limited number of furrows as sampled in a conventional evaluation. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{management}} of composting {{may influence the}} characteristics of the produced compounds. The experiment used three frequencies of plowing, combined with the conditions: with and without coverage of the composting patio, with and without the use of commercial inoculant, resulting in 12 furrows, installed on the Experimental Center of Agricultural Engineering (NEEA), of the STATE UNIVERSITY OF WEST PARANÁ (UNIOESTE), Campus of Cascavel city - state of Paraná (PR), in Brazil. The waste and quantities used in kg were: corn cob (7. 5); hatchery residue (5); floater sludge (31); ash (1); wheat cleaning residue (120); wheat pre-cleaning residue (120); corn peel (7. 5); solid fraction of wash trucks used to transport chickens (2); solid fraction of pig manure (1) and coal (5), totaling 300 kg of natural matter. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the influence of plowings, patio coverage and inoculation in losses of N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Na, Cu, Zn, Mn, Fe. The <b>furrows</b> <b>plowed</b> three times a week in the first month showed significant higher losses of N (p< 0. 05). The coverage of the composting patio influenced significantly the losses of N, K, Mg and Na (p< 0. 05). The produced compounds had a high agronomic value in relation to macro and micronutrients. It is recommended the use of patio coverage and plowing twice a week in the first month and once a week in the subsequent months for a compound with higher concentrations of nutrients...|$|R

Next to {{them come}} {{the men of}} the Renaissance schools, headed by Dürer, who, less careful of the beauty and {{refinement}} of the line, delight in its vigor, accuracy, and complexity.

500|$|Pollen grains {{are usually}} spherical to {{ellipsoid}} in shape, sometimes triangular, about 20 to 30micrometres along their long axis and 20 to 30µm in diameter. They are typically monosulcate, meridionosulcate or more rarely trichotomosulcate. The sulcus is a furrow which {{runs along the}} surface of the pollen grain and is usually the site at which pollination occurs. Monosulcate pollen has a <b>single</b> <b>furrow</b> that runs along the pole of the pollen grain. Meridionosulcate pollen have a furrow that runs along the equator of the pollen grain. Trichotomosulcate pollen, on the other hand, has three furrows. The outer layer of the pollen is covered {{to a greater or lesser}} extent with ridges, spines or warts.

40|$|Generally, the measurement, {{evaluation}} and optimisation of furrow irrigation {{is restricted to}} a <b>single</b> <b>furrow</b> or small number of adjacent furrows. The measurement process is too intensive to be applied at the full field scale. Consequently {{it is necessary to}} assume that the infiltration characteristics and inflow rates of the measured furrow(s) represent the remainder of the field. Many people have observed or speculated upon the significance of spatial variability but few outline potential strategies to deal with the issue. Clearly, a new approach was required. Research conducted by the authors and others at the NCEA has investigated and developed potential tools and techniques to better evaluate surface irrigation accounting for spatial and temporal variability. A trial was conducted in a typical commercial cotton field to showcase the tools and techniques to evaluate and optimise irrigation performance at the field scale. The resulting data also provided an insight into the nature of spatial variability. Complete inflow, advance and runoff measurements were used to accurately determine soil infiltration rates for a small number of <b>furrows.</b> <b>Single</b> advance points were then used to predict the infiltration characteristics across the remainder of the field.

40|$|In July 1990 AVIRIS and AIRSAR {{data were}} {{collected}} over the Manix Basin Area of the Mojave Desert to study land degradation in an arid area where centerpivot irrigation had been in use. The Manix Basin is located NE of Barstow, California, along Interstate- 15 at 34 deg 57 min N 116 deg 35 min W. This region was covered {{by a series of}} lakes during the Late Pleistocence and Early Holocene. Beginning in the 1960 's, areas were cleared of the native creosote bush-dominated plant community to be used for agricultural purposes. Starting in 1972 fields have been abandoned due to the increased cost of electricity needed to pump the irrigation water, with some fields abandoned as recently as 1988 and 1992. These circumstances provide a time series of abandoned fields which provide the possibility of studying the processes which act on agricultural fields in arid regions when they are abandoned. Ray et al. reported that polarimetric SAR (AIRSAR) could detect that the concentric circular planting <b>furrows</b> <b>plowed</b> on these fields persists for a few years after abandonment and then disappear over time and that wind ripples which form on these fields over time due to wind erosion can be detected with polarimetric radar. Ray et al. used Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) bandpasses to generate NDVI images of the Manix Basin which showed that the fields abandoned for only a few years had higher NDVI's than the undisturbed desert while the fields abandoned for a longer time had NDVI levels lower than that of the undisturbed desert. The {{purpose of this study is}} to use a fusion of a time series of satellite data with airborne data to provide a context for the airborne data. The satellite data time series will additionally help to validate the observation and analysis of time-dependent processes observed in the single AVIRIS image of fields abandoned for different periods of time...|$|R
60|$|The {{cultivation}} of sugar is simple. The land having been got in perfect order, deep <b>furrows</b> were <b>plowed</b> {{at a distance}} of five feet apart. In these the cuttings, which are pieces of {{the upper part of the}} cane, containing two or three knots, were laid {{at a distance of}} three feet apart. The plow was then taken along by the side of the furrow, so as to fill it up again and cover the cuttings. In sugar plantations the rows of canes are close together, but Mr. Hardy had chosen this distance, as it enabled his horse-hoe to work between them, and thus keep the ground turned up and free from weeds, without the expense of hard labor. In a short time the shoots appeared above the soil. In four months they had gained the height of fourteen feet, and their glossy stems showed that they were ready to cut.|$|R

40|$|Signaling by the centrosomal asters and spindle midzone coordinately directs {{formation}} of the cytokinetic furrow. Here, we explore {{the contribution of the}} asters by analyzing the consequences of altering interaster distance during the first cytokinesis of the Caenorhabditis elegans embryo. Delaying aster separation, by using TPXL- 1 depletion to shorten the metaphase spindle, leads to a corresponding delay in furrow formation, but results in a <b>single</b> <b>furrow</b> that ingresses at a normal rate. Preventing aster separation, by simultaneously inhibiting TPXL- 1 and G signaling-based cortical forces pulling on the asters, delays furrow formation and leads to the {{formation of}} multiple furrows that ingress toward the midzone. Disrupting midzone-based signaling, by depleting conserved midzone complexes, results in a converse phe-notype: neither the timing nor the number of furrows is affected, but the rate of furrow ingression is decreased threefold. Simultaneously delaying aster separation and disrupting midzone-based signaling leads to complete failure of furrow formation. Based on these results, we propose that signaling by the separated asters executes two critical functions: 1) it couples furrow formation to anaphase onset by concentrating contractile ring proteins on the equatorial cortex in a midzone-independent manner and 2) it subsequently refines spindle midzone-based signaling to restrict <b>furrowing</b> to a <b>single</b> site...|$|R
40|$|SummaryBackgroundAfter anaphase, the {{segregated}} chromosomes are sequestered by cytokinesis into two separate daughter cells by a cleavage furrow {{formed by the}} actomyosin-based contractile ring. The failure to properly position the contractile ring between {{the segregated}} chromosomes can result in aneuploidy. In both C. elegans embryos and human cells, the central spindle regulates division-plane positioning in parallel with a second pathway that involves astral microtubules. ResultsWe combined genetic and pharmacological manipulations with live cell imaging to spatially separate the two division cues in a single cell. We demonstrate that the two pathways for furrow formation are mechanistically and genetically distinct. By following the distribution of green fluorescent protein (GFP) -tagged nonmuscle myosin, {{we have found that}} the astral pathway for furrow formation involves the negative regulation of cortical myosin recruitment. An asymmetrically positioned spindle induces the asymmetric cortical accumulation of myosin. This cortical myosin behaves as a coherent contractile network. If the cortical network is nonuniform over the cell, the cortical contractile elements coalesce into a <b>single</b> <b>furrow.</b> This coalescence requires interconnections among contractile elements. ConclusionsWe conclude that the two pathways of cleavage-furrow formation are mechanistically distinct. In particular, we conclude that the astral pathway for cleavage-furrow formation involves the negative regulation of myosin distribution by astral cues...|$|R
