5|$|Physcia caesia {{was first}} {{described}} by Georg Franz Hoffmann in 1784 as Lichen caesius. Other lichenologists assigned it to various other genera {{both before and}} after it was moved into its current genus by Georg Ernst Ludwig Hampe in 1839. It has 2 subspecies, P. c. caesia and P. c. ventosa, {{as well as a number}} of distinct forms and varieties, some of which were thought to be distinct species in the past. Although this species and Physcia aipolia have been considered a species pair, some molecular <b>studies</b> <b>suggest</b> that they should instead be considered conspecific. Other molecular <b>studies</b> <b>suggest</b> that both Physcia caesia and Physcia aipolia are polyphyletic taxa, with various forms more closely related to other species than to each other.|$|E

5|$|An {{example of}} a seductive detail in a {{training}} context might be a training class that includes cartoons on slides containing tips for effective supervision.

5|$|Around {{one-third of}} people with {{psoriasis}} report {{a family history of}} the disease, and researchers have identified genetic loci associated with the condition. Identical twin <b>studies</b> <b>suggest</b> a 70% chance of a twin developing psoriasis if the other twin has the disorder. The risk is around 20% for nonidentical twins. These findings suggest both a genetic susceptibility and an environmental response in developing psoriasis.|$|E

5|$|Hybridization may be {{important}} in speciation in some plant groups. However, homoploid hybrid speciation (not {{increasing the number of}} sets of chromosomes) may be rare: by 1997, only 8 natural examples had been fully described. Experimental <b>studies</b> <b>suggest</b> that hybridization offers a rapid route to speciation, a prediction confirmed by the fact that early generation hybrids and ancient hybrid species have matching genomes, meaning that once hybridization has occurred, the new genome can remain stable.|$|E

Both autistic groups performed worse than controls at complex language tasks such as figurative language, comprehension and inference. As people are often sized up initially from their basic language skills, these <b>studies</b> <b>suggest</b> that people speaking to autistic individuals {{are more likely to}} overestimate what their audience comprehends.|$|E
5|$|Knowledge of the {{clitoris}} {{is significantly}} impacted by cultural {{perceptions of the}} organ. <b>Studies</b> <b>suggest</b> that knowledge of its existence and anatomy is scant in comparison with that of other sexual organs, and that more education about it could help alleviate social stigmas associated with the female body and female sexual pleasure; for example, that the clitoris and vulva in general are visually unappealing, that female masturbation is taboo, or that men {{should be expected to}} master and control women's orgasms.|$|E

5|$|Other <b>studies</b> <b>suggest</b> that rivaling Carnotaurus did {{not deliver}} rapid head blows, but pushed slowly {{against each other}} with the upper sides of their skulls. Thus, the horns {{may have been a}} device for the {{distribution}} of compression forces without damage to the brain. This is supported by the flattened upper sides of the horns, the strongly fused bones of the top of the skull, and the inability of the skull to survive rapid head blows.|$|E
5|$|Other, {{more recent}} <b>studies</b> <b>suggest</b> {{that the idea}} of object {{permanence}} may not be an innate function of young children. While, in reference to Piaget's theory, it has been established that young children develop object permanence as they age, the question arises: does this occur because of a particular perception that already existed within the minds of these young children? Is object permanence really an inbred response to the neural pathways developing in young minds? <b>Studies</b> <b>suggest</b> that a multitude of variables may be responsible for the development of object permanence rather than a natural talent of infants. Evidence suggests that infants use a variety of cues while studying an object and their perception of the object's permanence can be tested without physically hiding the object. Rather, the object is occluded, slightly obstructed, from the infants view and they are left only other visual cues, such as examining the object from different trajectories. It was also found that the longer an infant focuses on an object may be due to detected discontinuities in their visual field, or the flow of events, with which the infant has become familiar.|$|E

Nonetheless, the victory boosted {{the morale of the}} Song infantry and halted the southern advance of the Jin army.|$|E
