It uses a Chinese Ingenic Jz4730 336MHz MIPSII-compatible one core 32-bit system-on-a-chip (SoC) with 128MiB of SDRAM, and a 1–2GB <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>drive.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{overall goals}} of PIP are to {{increase}} the repetition rate of the Booster beam from 7Hz to 15Hz and replace old hardware to increase reliability of the operation. Before {{the start of the}} PIP project, a replacement of the pre-accelerator injector was underway. The replacement of almost 40-year-old Cockcroft–Walton generators to RFQ started in 2009 and completed in 2012. At the linac stage, the analog beam position monitor (BPM) modules were replaced with digital boards in 2013. A replacement of Linac vacuum pumps and related hardware is expected to be completed in 2015. A study on the replacement of 201-MHz drift tubes is still ongoing. At the boosting stage, a major component of the PIP is to upgrade the Booster ring to 15-Hz operation. The Booster has 19 radio frequency stations. Originally, the Booster stations were operating without solid-state drive system which was acceptable for 7-Hz, but not for 15-Hz operation. A demonstration project in 2004 converted one of the stations to <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>drive</b> prior to the PIP project. As part of the project, the remaining stations were successfully converted to solid state in 2013. Another major part of the PIP project is to refurbish and replace 40-year-old Booster cavities. Many cavities have been refurbished and tested to operate at 15Hz repetition rate. The completion of cavity refurbishment is expected to be completed in 2015 and the repetition rate can be gradually increased to 15-Hz operation from that point. A longer term upgrade task is to replace the Booster cavities with a new design. The research and development of the new cavities is underway. The completion of the Booster cavity replacement is expected to be in 2018.|$|E
500|$|The Retina models {{also have}} fewer user-accessible upgrade or {{replacement}} options than previous MacBooks. Unlike in previous generations, the memory is soldered onto the logic board {{and is therefore}} not upgradable. The <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>drive</b> is not soldered and can be replaced by users. The battery is glued into place; attempts to remove it may destroy the battery and/or trackpad. The entire case uses proprietary pentalobe screws and cannot be disassembled with standard tools. While the battery is glued in, recycling companies have stated that the design is only [...] "mildly inconvenient" [...] and does not hamper the recycling process.|$|E

500|$|The {{new models}} omit Ethernet and FireWire 800 ports, though Apple offers Thunderbolt {{adapters}} for both interfaces. They also omit a SuperDrive, making the 15-inch model Apple's first professional notebook since the PowerBook 2400c to ship without a built-in optical drive. Instead {{of a hard}} disk drive, the new models ship with a <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>drive</b> housed in a proprietary flash module design rather than a 2.5" [...] notebook drive. Apple also claims improved speakers and microphones and a new system for cooling the notebook with improved fans. The new case design {{does not have a}} Kensington lock slot, so alternative products are required to physically secure the computer.|$|E

The tablet itself has a 128GB <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>drive,</b> and the keyboard adds 1TB of hard drive storage. The computer also features various ports including HDMI, LAN, one USB 3.0, and two USB 2.0.|$|E

The study further showed that when a <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> is implemented as a primary storage device with Windows 7 installed, there was a 0 % chance for recovery of any evidence, whether it be file content, file names, or properties.
