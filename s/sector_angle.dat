K 1 - 6 (Invited) This paper dissects {{the effect}} of the {{statistical}} variation of <b>sector</b> <b>angle</b> to magnetic sensitivity in sectorial split-drain magnetic field effect transistors (SD-MAGFETs). The magnetic sensitivity of sectorial SD-MAGFET depends on both the <b>sector</b> <b>angle</b> and the charge trapping effect along the channel boundary. Our empirical studies showed that both factors are affected by the statistical variation of the <b>sector</b> <b>angle,</b> and each becomes the dominating effect at different <b>sector</b> <b>angle</b> range. As a result, we proposed a statistical model for the process induced magnetic sensitivity, which is useful for the prediction of the appropriate <b>sector</b> <b>angle</b> that achieves the smallest magnetic sensitivity variation brought by the process induced variation. The developed model is empirical, which also demonstrate the existence of an optimal <b>sector</b> <b>angle</b> with respect to process variation. Copyright © IEEE...|$|E
40|$|The {{three-dimensional}} {{free vibration}} of annular sector plates with various boundary conditions is studied {{by means of}} the Chebyshev-Ritz method. The analysis is based on the three-dimensional small strain linear elasticity theory. The product of Chebyshev polynomials satisfying the necessary boundary conditions is selected as admissible functions {{in such a way that}} the governing eigenvalue equation can be conveniently derived through an optimization process by the Ritz method. The boundary functions guarantee the satisfaction of the geometric boundary conditions of the plates and the Chebyshev polynomials provide the robustness for numerical calculation. The present study provides a full vibration spectrum for the thick annular sector plates, which cannot be given by the two-dimensional (2 -D) theories such as the Mindlin theory. Comprehensive numerical results with high accuracy are systematically produced, which can be used as benchmark to evaluate other numerical methods. The effect of radius ratio, thickness ratio and <b>sector</b> <b>angle</b> on natural frequencies of the plates with a <b>sector</b> <b>angle</b> from 120 ° to 360 ° is discussed in detail. The three-dimensional vibration solutions for plates with a re-entrant <b>sector</b> <b>angle</b> (larger than 180 °) and shallow helicoidal shells (<b>sector</b> <b>angle</b> larger than 360 °) with a small helix angle are presented for the first time. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Here we show how the geometry of 4 -vertices, given by the <b>sector</b> <b>angles</b> of each plate, affects their folding behavior. For generic vertices, we distinguish three vertex types and two subtypes. We establish relationships based on the relative sizes of the <b>sector</b> <b>angles</b> to determine which folds can fully close and the possible mountain-valley assignments. Next, we consider what occurs when <b>sector</b> <b>angles</b> or sums thereof are set equal, which results in 16 special vertex types.

This approach would be especially useful for sampling objects in small discrete areas or “polygons” with lots of internal or external edge, {{but it may be}} extended to sampling any object regardless of polygon size. Sector plots are wedge-shaped with a fixed <b>sector</b> <b>angle.</b> The probability of object selection is constant and equal to the <b>sector</b> <b>angle</b> in degrees divided by 360 °.

40|$|Magnetic sensors have a {{wide range}} of {{applications}} in proximity sensing, position sensing, etc. Once a magnetic field is present, or there is a change of magnetic field, an electronic signal will be generated from the magnetic sensor. The Hall Effect sensor is a well-known magnetic sensor where the hall voltage varies piecewise with the magnetic field strength. The advanced CMOS technology enables the integration of magnetic sensing core, biasing circuit, amplifier, etc., into one tiny chip. Therefore the power consumption, parasitic element and manufacturing cost of the integrated magnetic sensor can be reduced. It is well-known that silicon is a material which is compatible with the integrated circuit fabrication process. However, silicon may not be a good choice for being an integrated magnetic sensor because of the low mobility property. Low mobility will degrade the performance of the magnetic sensing core, especially the magnetic field sensitivity. Recent research has improved the performance of magnetic sensing core fabricated by silicon such as the development of the metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) Hall Plate and Split-Drain Magnetic Field Effect Transistor (SD-MAGFET). These magnetic sensors are feasible for integrating with a biasing circuit, amplifier and A/D converter. Therefore a silicon magnetic sensor with high magnetic field sensitivity, reduced power consumption and less parasitic elements can be fabricated. These properties make integrated magnetic sensors popular in industrial and motion control systems, especially in mechatronic application. The operation of a mechatronic system usually involves a high operating temperature and high unwanted signal noise. Silicon magnetic sensors are capable of high performance under the above conditions. A high magnetic field changing rate {{is one of the main}} factors which degrade the performance of magnetic sensors in mechatronic application. Especially in measuring the angular position of a magnet, a fast changing magnetic field rate will cause the magnetic sensor not to move fast enough respond to the changing magnetic field. Another factor that also strongly influences magnetic field sensitivity is the geometric dimension variation of magnetic sensors. This variation is caused by the imperfect manufacturing process and it is unavoidable. In my research, a Sectorial Split-Drain (SSD) MAGFET is employed for investigation. An experiment is designed for investigating the magnetic field sensing behaviour of alternating magnetic fields. The magnetic field sensing resolution is studied through spectral analysis. The studies show that a MAGFET-based system can achieve better accuracy than traditional Hall Plate when sensing the alternating magnetic field. The underlying physics are also explored which leads to device selection guidelines for high speed, high accuracy angular position measurement. Another experiment is designed to investigate the SSD-MAGFET magnetic field sensitivity variation, whereby the sensitivity variation is induced by manufacturing process variation (process-induced variation). The <b>sector</b> <b>angle</b> and magnetic field sensitivity of 965 “identical” SSD-MAGFETs are measured. A statistical model describing process-induced variation is developed.
