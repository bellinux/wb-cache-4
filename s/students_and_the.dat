5|$|More than 300 {{hours of}} footage was {{recorded}} by the <b>students</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> two Iraqi associate producers. It was transcribed, translated and edited into a 90-minute film. Getting the tapes out of Iraq proved difficult for Winter and O'Mahoney, who remained in the UK. They {{had to rely on}} journalists from many news agencies, especially those in the BBC News's Baghdad Bureau high-risk team, to smuggle the tapes out of Iraq. When curfews were enforced, weeks passed before the producers received new footage because it was impossible for anybody to leave their homes or the country.|$|E
5|$|On 6 November 1957, Houphouët-Boigny became Minister of Public Health and Population in the Gaillard {{administration}} {{and attempted to}} reform the public health code. He had previously served as Minister of State under Maurice Bourgès-Maunoury (13 June– 6 November 1957). Following his Gaillard ministry, he was again appointed Minister of State from 14 May 1958;– 20 May 1959. In this capacity, he participated {{in the development of}} France's African policy, notably in the cultural domain. At his behest, the Bureau of French Overseas <b>Students</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> University of Dakar were created. On 4 October 1958, Houphouët-Boigny was one of the signatories, along with de Gaulle, of the Constitution of the Fifth Republic. The last post he held in France was Minister-Counsellor in the Michel Debré government, from 23 July 1959 to 19 May 1961.|$|E
5|$|On Sunday, February 25, 1917, Danebod Folk School {{burned to}} the grown. Fortunately, the fire burned slowly. The <b>students</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> quickly summoned neighbors had time to rescue much of the {{furniture}} and other items of high value. Nearby buildings were saved, but the Folk School was beyond rescue. In the fall of 1917, nine months after the disastrous fire, a new and larger Folk School was dedicated. Speakers at the dedicatory exercises were Pastor Knudsen, C.P. Højbjerg, Aage Møller, P.Rasmussen, and Kristian Østergaard. Meanwhile, a terrible epidemic of influenza swept the county, and all churches and schools were temporarily closed {{in an effort to}} halt the deadly disease; but many people died. Another catastrophe followed on August21, 1918, when a devastating tornado tore through Lincoln County. It was the fourth most deadly tornado in Minnesota history and took the lives of 36 people and injured a dozen more.|$|E

5|$|Other {{victims were}} college students, {{many of whom}} were {{expelled}} from their institutions and had their careers destroyed, academic teachers who tried to defend the <b>students</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> academic institutions themselves: Warsaw University had several departments administratively dissolved. Liberal intelligentsia members, Jewish or not, were removed from the government and other places of employment. Leftist intellectuals and student leaders lost what was left of their faith in the ostensibly socialist government. Finally the party itself was purged of many thousand suspect members, people who somehow did not fit the new environment of intolerance and hatred. The 1968 purges meant also the beginning of a large scale generational replacement of the party executive membership, a process that continued into the early 1970s, after Gomułka's departure. The prewar communist cadres were removed and people whose careers were formed in People's Poland took their place, which, early in his term, gave Gomułka's successor Edward Gierek one of the youngest in Europe elites of power.|$|E
