5|$|The Western Australian gold rushes of the 1890s {{resulted}} in <b>strong</b> <b>economic</b> growth, {{and a massive}} increase in population: doubling from almost 50,000 in 1891 to more than 100,000 by 1895, and expanding to 184,000 by 1901. The influx included desperate, dishonest people, from elsewhere in Australia and overseas, and Fremantle Prison was soon overcrowded.|$|E
5|$|The recent <b>strong</b> <b>economic</b> {{growth and}} lower {{unemployment}} in the Telford area {{has been attributed to}} the construction of the motorway: {{unemployment in the}} 1980s was over 20%, but by 2004 this figure had fallen to 3.3%. The motorway enabled the development of distribution centres in Telford, and industrial estates such as Hortonwood and Stafford Park have provided employment in the area.|$|E

30|$|Channelling pension {{contributions}} through {{financial markets}} may also – under strong assumptions – contribute to <b>stronger</b> <b>economic</b> growth 28. This effect matters especially for catching-up economies {{such as in}} Poland. Although the pension reform aimed at the goals specified earlier in this paper, a positive externality such as contributing to <b>stronger</b> <b>economic</b> growth was an additional argument for channelling part of the pension contributions through financial markets 29.|$|R

5|$|Urban renewal {{projects}} and {{the transition to}} a service economy have resulted in <b>strong</b> <b>economic</b> growth in some parts of Northern England, but a definite North–South divide remains both in the economy and the culture of England. Centuries of migration, invasion and labour have shaped Northern culture, and the region retains distinctive dialects, music and cuisine.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} events in 2006 pushed {{renewable}} energy up the political agenda, including the US mid-term elections in November, which confirmed clean energy as a mainstream issue. Also in 2006, the Stern Review made a <b>strong</b> <b>economic</b> case for investing in low carbon technologies now, and argued that economic growth need not be incompatible with cutting energy consumption. According to a trend analysis from the United Nations Environment Programme, climate change concerns coupled with recent high oil prices and increasing government support are driving increasing rates of investment in the renewable energy and energy efficiency industries.|$|E
5|$|Basel had {{remained}} studiously neutral {{throughout the whole}} war. Although allied with some cantons of the Swiss Confederacy, it also had <b>strong</b> <b>economic</b> ties in the Alsace and further down along the Rhine. But {{the events of the}} war had strengthened the pro-confederate party in the city council, and the Swiss recognized the city's strategic position as a bridgehead on the Rhine (like Schaffhausen, too). On June 9, 1501, a delegation from Basel and the Swiss cantons' representatives signed the alliance contract, which the city council of Basel ratified on July 13, 1501.|$|E
50|$|Economic {{growth in}} Central America is {{projected}} to slow slightly in 2014-15, as country-specific domestic factors offset the positive effects from <b>stronger</b> <b>economic</b> activity in the United States.|$|R

5|$|Beginning {{around the}} mid-20th century, Texas began to {{transform}} from a rural and agricultural state {{to one that}} was urban and industrialized. The state's population grew quickly during this period, with large levels of migration from outside the state. As {{a part of the}} Sun Belt Texas experienced <b>strong</b> <b>economic</b> growth, particularly during the 1970s and early 1980s. Texas's economy diversified, lessening its reliance on the petroleum industry. By 1990, Hispanics overtook blacks to become the largest minority group in the state.|$|E
5|$|Cameroon has had {{a decade}} of <b>strong</b> <b>economic</b> performance, with GDP growing {{at an average of}} 4% per year. During the 2004–2008 period, public debt was reduced from over 60% of GDP to 10% and {{official}} reserves quadrupled to over USD 3billion. Cameroon is part of the Bank of Central African States (of which it is the dominant economy), the Customs and Economic Union of Central Africa (UDEAC) and the Organization for the Harmonization of Business Law in Africa (OHADA). Its currency is the CFA franc.|$|E
5|$|Exports formed 28percent of GDP in 2009. Most of the country's {{export revenue}} {{is derived from}} the {{textiles}} industry, fish and shellfish, vanilla, cloves and other foodstuffs. France is Madagascar's main trading partner, although the United States, Japan and Germany also have <b>strong</b> <b>economic</b> ties to the country. The Madagascar-U.S. Business Council was formed in May 2003, as a collaboration between USAID and Malagasy artisan producers to support the export of local handicrafts to foreign markets. Imports of such items as foodstuffs, fuel, capital goods, vehicles, consumer goods and electronics consume an estimated 52percent of GDP. The main sources of Madagascar's imports include China, France, Iran, Mauritius and Hong Kong.|$|E

5|$|Since the {{liberalisation}} of the Turkish {{economy in}} the 1980s, the country has enjoyed <b>stronger</b> <b>economic</b> growth and greater political stability.

5|$|In {{the course}} of the 1960s and 1970s, Cold War {{participants}} struggled to adjust to a new, more complicated pattern of international relations in which the world was no longer divided into two clearly opposed blocs. From the beginning of the post-war period, Western Europe and Japan rapidly recovered from the destruction of World War II and sustained <b>strong</b> <b>economic</b> growth through the 1950s and 1960s, with per capita GDPs approaching those of the United States, while Eastern Bloc economies stagnated.|$|E
5|$|Kentucky's {{citizens}} were split regarding the issues {{central to the}} Civil War. The state had <b>strong</b> <b>economic</b> ties with Ohio River cities such as Pittsburgh and Cincinnati {{while at the same}} time sharing many cultural, social, and economic links with the South. Unionist traditions were strong throughout the Commonwealth's history, especially in the east. With economic ties to both the North and the South, Kentucky had little to gain and much to lose from a war between the states. Additionally, many slaveholders felt that the best protection for slavery was within the Union.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the prison}} {{came under the}} control of the colonial government, it was renamed Fremantle Prison. All prisoners in Perth Gaol were {{transferred}} to Fremantle, and from 1887 female prisoners were also imprisoned there, in their own separate section. The Western Australian gold rushes of the 1890s resulted in <b>strong</b> <b>economic</b> growth, and a massive increase in population: doubling from almost 50,000 in 1891 to more than 100,000 by 1895, and to 184,000 by 1901. This influx included desperate, dishonest people, from elsewhere in Australia and overseas, and Fremantle Prison was soon overcrowded.|$|E
50|$|The period {{following}} the 1973 oil crisis {{was characterized by}} stagflation, the combination of low economic and productivity growth and high inflation. The period was also characterized by high interest rates, which is not entirely consistent with secular stagnation. <b>Stronger</b> <b>economic</b> growth resumed and inflation declined during the 1980s.|$|R

5|$|To the north, the {{conflict}} held a <b>strong</b> <b>economic</b> component {{in addition to}} territorial disputes. Newfoundland {{was the site of}} a British colony based at St. John's, and the French colonial base was at Plaisance, with both sides also holding a number of smaller permanent settlements. The island also had many seasonal settlements used by fishermen from Europe. These colonists numbered fewer than 2,000 English and 1,000 French permanent settlers (and many more seasonal visitors) who competed with one another for the fisheries of the Grand Banks, which were also used by fishermen from Acadia (then encompassing all of present-day Nova Scotia and New Brunswick) and Massachusetts.|$|E
5|$|The {{focus of}} the company began to switch away from purely {{construction}} and towards more turnkey work and service provision, for example the 1961-3 Hilton Hotel, Athens, project. Most work was domestic, driven by Germany's <b>strong</b> <b>economic</b> growth, with a particular strength in power plant construction. This included {{the construction of the}} Federal Republic of Germany's first nuclear power plant, Kahl Nuclear Power Plant, near Dettingen am Main. The construction contract had been awarded by AEG, which had been commissioned by the utility company RWE to build the plant. The plant began to feed its electricity to the grid in June 1961. By contrast, the first East German nuclear plant, at Rheinsberg, was connected to the grid in 1966.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{going to}} war against France, the British Royal Navy began intercepting ships of neutral {{countries}} bound for French ports. The French imported large amounts of American foodstuffs, and the British hoped to starve the French into defeat by intercepting these shipments. In November 1793 the British government widened the scope of these seizures to include any neutral ships trading with the French West Indies, including those flying the American flag. By the following March, over 250 U.S. merchant ships had been seized and their crews impressed. Americans were outraged, and angry protests erupted in several cities. Many Jeffersonians in Congress demanded a declaration of war, but Congressman James Madison instead called for <b>strong</b> <b>economic</b> retaliation, including an embargo on all trade with Britain. Further inflaming anti-British sentiment in Congress, news arrived while the matter was under debate that the Governor General of British North America, Lord Dorchester, had made an inflammatory speech inciting the Indians in the Northwest Territory against the Americans.|$|E
50|$|In the {{following}} years, the railway {{became one of}} the <b>strongest</b> <b>economic</b> enterprises of the city and due to the good rail connections several industrial companies settled in Elsterwerda and nearby Biehla, causing significant population growth. The population increased from 1,739 in 1871 to 2,537 in 1895 and 4,224 in 1910.|$|R
5000|$|In its 2007 survey {{entitled}} [...] "Cities of the Future", FDi magazine ranked Guadalajara highest among major Mexican {{cities and}} designated Guadalajara {{as having the}} second <b>strongest</b> <b>economic</b> potential of any major North American city, behind Chicago. The magazine also ranked it as the most business-friendly Latin American city in 2007.|$|R
5000|$|The {{decline of}} the Genoese navy and fleet {{continued}} through the 17th and 18th centuries. Changes in the economy of Genoa ensured that bankers, not merchants, became the <b>strongest</b> <b>economic</b> force in the city. The need to protect trade routes declined as a consequence, shrinking {{the need for a}} large navy.|$|R
5|$|BART {{ridership}} {{has grown}} rapidly since 2010, mirroring <b>strong</b> <b>economic</b> {{growth in the}} Bay Area. In 2015, the system was carrying approximately 100,000 more passengers each day than it had five years earlier. High gasoline prices also contributed to growth, pushing ridership to record levels during 2012, with the system recording five record ridership days in September and October 2012. During the fiscal year ending June 30, 2017, BART recorded an average weekday ridership of 423,395, the second-highest in its history, but a 2.3% drop from 2016. Ridership growth began to slow in late 2016, and dropped by 1.7% in October 2016 from the prior year. The line to the San Francisco International Airport lost riders, while ride-sharing services such as Uber and Lyft grew {{by a factor of}} almost six or nearly 500% at the airport during 2014–2016. BART planners believe that competition from Uber and Lyft is reducing overall ridership growth and BART's share of SFO airport transit. Some see the decline in transit use in large U.S. cities as part of a national trend, linked to changes in commute patterns, the fall in gasoline prices since 2014, and competition from the private sector in the form of ride-sharing services.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{extractive}} {{industries have}} contributed strongly to New Zealand's economy, focussing {{at different times}} on sealing, whaling, flax, gold, kauri gum, and native timber. With the development of refrigerated shipping in the 1880s meat and dairy products were exported to Britain, a trade which {{provided the basis for}} <b>strong</b> <b>economic</b> growth in New Zealand. High demand for agricultural products from the United Kingdom and the United States helped New Zealanders achieve higher living standards than both Australia and Western Europe in the 1950s and 1960s. In 1973, New Zealand's export market was reduced when the United Kingdom joined the European Community and other compounding factors, such as the 1973 oil and 1979 energy crisis, led to a severe economic depression. Living standards in New Zealand fell behind those of Australia and Western Europe, and by 1982 New Zealand had the lowest per-capita income of all the developed nations surveyed by the World Bank. In the mid-1980s New Zealand deregulated its agricultural sector by phasing out subsidies over a three-year period. Since 1984, successive governments engaged in major macroeconomic restructuring (known first as Rogernomics and then Ruthanasia), rapidly transforming New Zealand from a protected and highly regulated economy to a liberalised free trade economy.|$|E
5|$|In the {{economic}} field, the document addressed {{the lack of}} a bourgeoisie that could turn the political changes into economic development, and proposed to overcome this lack with strong state interventionism. Mariano Moreno proposed that the state invest 200 or 300 million in factories, manufacturing, arts, agriculture, navigation, and other critical areas. There would be no risk of bankruptcy because the state would manage the businesses. With the money generated, the state would then seek seeds and tools, and ultimately allow the continent to be economically autarchic. The initial money that the state would need to become such an active economic force would come from the mines in Potosi, where the slavers had nearly 500 or 600 million. Moreno proposed simply to confiscate the money and nationalize the mines. He reasoned that five or six thousand people would be harmed by such action, but eighty or a hundred thousand would benefit. The state would not manage those areas indefinitely; Moreno proposed that this should be done only until there was a <b>strong</b> <b>economic</b> activity in each area, and then the state would just observe, making sure that they followed the laws enacted for the common good of society.|$|E
30|$|Urban centers such as Stuttgart, Karlsruhe, and Mannheim {{with highly}} {{developed}} industry and service sectors make Baden-Württemberg {{one of the}} <b>strongest</b> <b>economic</b> regions in Europe (Atzl and Keller 2013). The state possesses a dense network of road, railway, and water transport infrastructures with important corridors for the Trans-European transport network (Gebhardt 2008).|$|R
50|$|Around 1300, the manoral economy {{suffered}} contraction {{due to the}} fluctuation in {{the price}} of agricultural foodstuffs. Ministeriales who were in a <b>stronger</b> <b>economic</b> position were better able to survive the weakening of their basis as landowners. The vast majority languished in poverty, resorting to selling lands to the Church, or to brigandage.|$|R
