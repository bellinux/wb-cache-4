In 1998 the building's second-largest tenant, law firm Drinker Biddle & Reath, left for One Logan Square. The resulting vacancy prompted the owners to renovate the building, renamed One South Broad, {{at a cost of}} US$10 million. Renovations included modernizing the elevators, <b>security</b> <b>and</b> <b>safety</b> systems and converting the lower floors to retail and restaurant space. The renovations took eighteen months and One South Broad was officially rededicated on May 3, 2000.|$|E
5|$|Grand Forks International Airport (GFK, KGFK) {{is served}} by Delta Air Lines with several daily round trips to Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport; and Allegiant Air, which {{operates}} flights {{a few times a}} week to Mesa, Arizona (Phoenix-Gateway), Sanford, Florida (Orlando-Sanford) and Las Vegas, Nevada. A new passenger terminal completed in early 2011, allowed more passengers to come through the airport, improved circulation, added a baggage claim and addressed <b>security</b> <b>and</b> <b>safety</b> concerns. The airport was a major distribution center for FedEx, which conducts flights daily within the state and northern Minnesota. FedEx moved their flight operations to Fargo, ND on October 31, 2016. The airport is one of the busiest airports in the country, due in large measure to the presence of the John D. Odegard School of Aerospace Sciences of the University of North Dakota.|$|E

This decision was reported to have been taken by the Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and other government ministers after a meeting with the BCCI. It was widely understood that India's withdrawal was due to political tensions between India and Pakistan. Indian sports minister Uma Bharti stated that cricketing ties between the two countries would resume after the normalization of political Indo-Pak ties. Additionally, Indian players' <b>security</b> <b>and</b> <b>safety</b> in Pakistan was also noted to be the major concern.|$|E

25|$|Plug and socket systems {{intended}} for high current, high voltage or polyphase industrial equipment, {{as well as}} additional contacts and larger contacts, may also include features to improve the <b>security</b> <b>and</b> <b>safety</b> of use. For example, a high-power plug may include a locking ring or twist-lock feature to prevent accidental disconnection in use. A socket may include a mechanical interlock that prevents insertion or removal of a plug unless the local safety disconnecting switch is open. Plugs may include special measures to contain an arc generated during disconnection. Plugs used for equipment in wet locations (such as mines) may include small supervisory contacts that check {{the integrity of the}} earthing conductor.|$|E
25|$|Following these {{killings and}} other similar incidents, Norman Carlson, then {{director}} of the Federal Bureau of Prisons, argued that a more secure type of prison needed to be designed, where uncontrollable inmates could be isolated from correction officers and other prisoners {{for the sake of}} <b>security</b> <b>and</b> <b>safety.</b> The control unit at USP Marion became a model for the subsequent construction of ADX, a facility designed from the ground up as a control unit prison. Years later, Carlson said he felt such a prison was needed to house inmates so desperate that they would commit murder (of another prisoner, or a guard) in the hopes of being sentenced to death.|$|E

The concern was raised after the terror attacks that started on September 11, 2001 that destroyed the World Trade Center in New York. Atienza and the council decreed that the Pandacan district was to be converted from an industrial zone to a residential-commercial zone. A moratorium was set and the oil companies have agreed to gradually scale down their operations.|$|E

25|$|At the Seventeenth Session, on Thursday 13 June, {{there was}} {{a reading of the}} {{relevant}} sections of Pope Gregory X's constitution ubi majus periculum, in which the magistrates of the host city of a Conclave are required to provide <b>security</b> <b>and</b> <b>safety</b> for the participants. The Captain and magistrates of Pisa then took their oaths. Patriarch Simon de Cramaud then informed the Council that, while this was going on, the Cardinals had met behind the high altar and had emerged with an agreement to elect only with a unanimous vote, or at least a two-thirds vote of each of the two colleges. Then the three Patriarchs read out a conciliar decree, authorizing the cardinals, without regard to Obedience, {{in the name of the}} Council and by virtue of Canon Law to proceed to an election. A vote of approval was demanded, and despite some grumbling from a French minority, the decree was accepted. And finally a solemn procession and prayers was ordered for the next day, looking forward to the opening of the Conclave.|$|E
500|$|This {{site was}} {{selected}} {{on the basis}} of several criteria. The plutonium pilot facilities needed to be [...] from the site boundary and any other installation, in case radioactive fission products escaped. While <b>security</b> <b>and</b> <b>safety</b> concerns suggested a remote site, it still needed to be near sources of labor, and accessible by road and rail transportation. A mild climate that allowed construction to proceed throughout the year was desirable. Terrain separated by ridges would reduce the impact of accidental explosions, but they could not be so steep as to complicate construction. The substratum needed to be firm enough to provide good foundations, but not so rocky that it would hinder excavation work. It needed large amounts of electrical power (available from the Tennessee Valley Authority) and cooling water. Finally, a War Department policy held that, as a rule, munitions facilities should not be located west of the Sierra or Cascade Ranges, east of the Appalachian Mountains, or within [...] of the Canadian or Mexican borders.|$|E
