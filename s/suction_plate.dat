50|$|Garra barreimiae is a small, slender fish, {{somewhat}} flattened on the underside. It {{grows to}} {{a length of}} about 7-8 cm. The head is wedge-shaped and has a <b>suction</b> <b>plate</b> on the lower jaw and a blunt snout. This fish is a fairly dark colour and is speckled; it has a paler transverse band just behind the head. An unpigmented form with fewer scales and no external eyes has been found living underground. Juveniles of this form are sighted at first, but as they get older, skin grows over their eyes.|$|E
50|$|A chopper pump is {{operated}} by a drive unit (e.g. electric motor, hydraulic motor, PTO), which turns the impeller and the cutting system. An open impeller design is used to successfully pass the macerated solids or thick slurry. A set of hardened steel cutters is installed externally to the pump suction in order to macerate all solids prior to entering the hydraulic parts of the pump. A chopper pump {{should not be confused}} with a grinder pump, which uses its impeller as part of the cutting mechanism. Grinder pumps are typically used for light weight sewage applications, whereas chopper pumps are used for tough solids handling applications. The chopping system consists of a set of rotating cutters that are keyed to the shaft and work in conjunction with the stationary cutters, which are bolted to the <b>suction</b> <b>plate.</b> A system of mechanical seals are used to prevent the pumped liquid from entering the motor. The pump can either be connected to a pipe, flexible hose or lowered down a guide rail so that the pump sits on a coupling foot (aka base elbow), thereby connecting it to the discharge pipe.|$|E

40|$|Automatic {{control of}} high tension soil {{solution}} samplers (suction lysimeters) {{in response to}} the surrounding soil matric potential has been proposed as a new method to reduce the convergence and divergence fluxes around the lysimeters. It is important to evaluate the instruments’ performance with automatically regulated suction because the efficiency of the control and its effects on the flux volumes could vary with the surrounding soil matric potential. An automatic equilibrium tension lysimeter (AETL) system was developed composed of 16 small-area (572 cm 2) ceramic <b>suction</b> <b>plates</b> that were continuously kept in equilibrium by an automated control device. The automated control device consisted of a datalogger connected to electronic tensiometers and to an electric vacuum pump that was activated to regulate the ceramic <b>plate</b> <b>suction.</b> The system was evaluated by simulating its performance with the HYDRUS- 2 D finite-element model. The AETL system continuously kept the lysimeters’ suction in equilibrium with the surrounding soil when the soil water matric potential head ranged from 2306 to 0 cm H 2 O. Suction control was less effective during low drainage conditions (soil matric potential head less than 250 cm H 2 O), when it took more time to re-equilibrate the pressure heads. However analysis of the variability of drainage and model simulations showed that incorrect suction control in drier conditions had a limited effect on the collected volumes. Suction was much better controlled when drainage flux was high, allowing a correct estimate of drainage. Automatic control of <b>suction</b> <b>plates</b> is a valuable tool for estimating drainage fluxes. Fine control of suction is needed when drainage flux is high because even the slight overapplication of suction, which is typically done during field experiments to overcome porous plate resistance and ensure that a sample is collected, could produce marked overestimation of water drainage (. 30 %) ...|$|R
40|$|Samples of A and B horizons of arable loessial soil, {{with and}} without the {{addition}} of c. a. 9 % of peat and subjected to six freezing/thawing cycles, were studied. Surface free energies and water contact angles were determined using a thin layer wick- ing technique. The water retention curving relating soil moisture to the pressure head was measured by combining the <b>suction</b> <b>plate</b> and pressure chamber methods. The addition of the fresh (non-dried) peat increased soil wettability in both horizons, which increased further after cyclic temperature changes. The amount of water retained at high pressure head values (in the low moisture region) decreased with the decrease in soil wettability, i. e., with the de- crease {{in the work of}} spreading of water and the increase of the contact angle. However, the amount of water retained at low pressure head values (in the high moisture region) depended on the pore volume of the soils. It was concluded that the value of the surface free energy has an important effect on water retention at low soil moistures, whereas at high moistures, macroscopic soil characteristics (such as porosity or bulk density) govern the water retention...|$|E
40|$|Sampling induces {{structural}} {{modifications in}} clay which {{depend on the}} stress and strain paths followed during sampling history. A complete description of disturbance is very difficult, because it originates in situ during drilling and is completed in the laboratory with reloading at the pre-existing stress conditions. In this paper, only the effects of undrained relief of confining effective stresses are investigated for reconstituted natural clays of varying plasticity. During undrained stress relief, negative pore pressure (suction) occurs: this residual stress was selected as a reference parameter for disturbance appraisal and compared with initial conditions before unloading. For {{the same type of}} soil, consolidation was carried out in various stress conditions (isotropic and anisotropic), and both normally consolidated and overconsolidated specimens were made. After undrained unloading, residual stress was evaluated by means of a controlled swelling technique using a modified oedometer and a triaxial device. This method was validated by comparisons with <b>suction</b> <b>plate</b> measurements performed on reconstituted kaolin clay specimens. Experiments showed various causes of loss of suction in samples, related to plasticity index, stress history, stress conditions and released stress level. For normally consolidated non-structured clays, undrained stress relief gives rise to some important disturbance processes, more evident for anisotropically consolidated samples. Residual stress may be considered meaningful for stress relief disturbance appraisal...|$|E

40|$|This {{data set}} {{contains}} measurements of {{dissolved organic carbon}} in samples of soil water collected from the main experiment plots of a large grassland biodiversity experiment (the Jena Experiment; see further details below). In the main experiment, 82 grassland plots of 20 x 20 m were established {{from a pool of}} 60 species belonging to four functional groups (grasses, legumes, tall and small herbs). In May 2002, varying numbers of plant species from this species pool were sown into the plots to create a gradient of plant species richness (1, 2, 4, 8, 16 and 60 species) and functional richness (1, 2, 3, 4 functional groups). Plots were maintained by bi-annual weeding and mowing. In April 2002 glass <b>suction</b> <b>plates</b> with a diameter of 12 cm, 1 cm thickness and a pore size of 1 - 1. 6 mm (UMS GmbH, Munich, Germany) were installed in depths of 10, 20, 30 and 60 cm to collect soil solution. The sampling bottles were continuously evacuated to a negative pressure between 50 and 350 mbar, such that the suction pressure was about 50 mbar above the actual soil water tension. Thus, only the soil leachate was collected. Cumulative soil solution was sampled biweekly and analyzed for dissolved organic carbon concentration by a high TOC elemental analyzer (Elementar Analysensysteme GmbH, Hanau, Germany).

40|$|Plant {{diversity}} {{was shown}} to influence the N cycle, but plant diversity effects on other nutrients remain unclear. We tested whether plant species richness or the presence/absence of particular functional plant groups influences P partitioning among differently extractable pools in soil, P concentrations in soil solution, and exploitation of P resources (i. e. the proportion of total bioavailable Pin plants and soil that was stored in aboveground biomass) by the plant community in a 5 -year biodiversity experiment in grassland. The experimental grassland site established in 2002 had 82 plots with different combinations of numbers of species (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 60) and functional groups (grasses, small non-leguminous herbs, tall non-leguminous herbs, legumes). In 2007, we determined P partitioning (Hedley) in soil of all experimental plots. We sampled plant community biomass and continuously extracted soil solution with <b>suction</b> <b>plates</b> from March 2003 to February 2007 and determined PO 4 -P concentrations in all samples. The presence of legumes increased aboveground P storage in plants and decreased labile P-i concentrations in soil because of their higher demands for P associated with N- 2 fixation. During cold periods, readily plant-available PO 4 -P concentrations in soil solution increased in legume-containing mixtures likely caused by leaching from P-rich residues. We found a consistently positive effect of plant species richness on P exploitation by the plant community which was independent {{of the presence of}} particular plant functional groups. With proceeding time after establishment, plant species richness increasingly contributed to the explanation of the variance in P exploitation. Therefore, plant strategies to efficiently acquire P seem to become increasingly important in these grasslands. We conclude that diverse plant communities are better prepared than less diverse mixtures to respond to P limitation induced by continuously high atmospheric N deposition. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V.

For agricultural purposes, peat has frequently been mixed with sand, but the effect of this measure on the release and cycling of DOC has rarely been investigated. This study examined the effects of (i) mixing peat with sand and (ii) water table depth (WTD) on DOC concentrations at three grassland sites on shallow organic soils. The soil solution was sampled bi-weekly for two years with <b>suction</b> <b>plates</b> at 15, 30 and 60 cm depth. Selected samples were analysed for dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), δ 13 CDOM and δ 15 NDOM. Average DOC concentrations were surprisingly high, ranging from 161 to 192 mgl− 1. There was no significant impact of soil organic carbon (SOC) content or WTD on mean DOC concentrations. At all sites, DOC concentrations were highest at the boundary between the SOC-rich horizon and the mineral subsoil. In contrast to the mean concentrations, the temporal patterns of DOC concentrations, their drivers and the properties of dissolved organic matter (DOM) differed between peat-sand mixtures and peat. DOC concentrations responded to changes in environmental conditions, but only after a lag period of a few weeks. At the sites with a peat-sand mixture, temperature and therefore probably biological activity determined the DOC concentrations. At the peat site, the contribution of vegetation-derived DOM was higher. The highest concentrations occurred during long, cool periods of waterlogging, suggesting a stronger physicochemical-based DOC mobilisation. Overall, these results indicate that mixing peat with sand does not improve water quality and may result in DOC losses of around 200 kg DOCha− 1 a− 1...|$|R

There is limited literature on these problems, and on methods used to address them. OBJECTIVES: Community nurses in the Facial Cleft Deformity Clinic evaluate associated airway obstruction and feeding problems and devise nursing interactions to address these. This retrospective study examined the incidence of airway and feeding difficulties in the neonatal, pre-surgical period, {{as well as the}} surgical and nutritional management of these infants. METHOD: Retrospective records of 215 infants with FRT were examined and data on incidence, airway and feeding difficulties and surgical and nutritional management was collected. Descriptive statistics, including average and percentage values, were compiled. RESULTS: The incidence of FRT amongst the cleft palate patients was 6. 0 %, with 37. 7 % of these having feeding difficulties. However, surgical interventions such as glossopexy (5. 6 %), distraction osteogenesis (0. 9 %) and tracheotomy (2. 3 %) for airway management were seldom required.

Inorganic phosphorus concentrations in the soil solution were measured photometrically with a continuous flow analyzer (CFA SAN++, Skalar [Breda, The Netherlands]). Ammonium molybdate catalyzed by antimony tartrate reacts in an acidic medium with phosphate and forms a phospho-molybdic acid complex.

Total dissolved P in soil solution was analyzed by irradiation with UV and oxidation with K 2 S 2 O 8 followed by reaction with ammonium molybdate (Skalar catnr. 503 - 553 w/r). As the molybdic complex forms under strongly acidic conditions, we could not exclude the hydrolysis of labile organic P compounds in our samples. Furthermore, the molybdate reaction is not sensitive for condensed phosphates. The detection limits of both TDP and PO 4 P were 0. 02 mg P l- 1 (CFA, Skalar).

The obtained SWRC shows that the measurements via the two methods consistently agree with each other. By using a suction-controlled oedometer for unsaturated soils, a series of one-dimensional compression tests were performed on the unsaturated compacted sand-bentonite mixture at different constant suctions. The testing results indicate that the yield stress increases and compression index decreases with the increase of imposed suction. The results also demonstrate that the mixture wetted to saturation and subsequently dried to a certain suction level has a lower yield stress than that wetted directly to the same suction...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{the present}} paper, an {{analysis}} {{is carried out}} to study the free convection, thermal radiation and mass transfer effects on an unsteady flow of a viscous incompressible micropolar fluid over a vertical moving porous plate immersed in a porous medium with time varying <b>suction</b> velocity. The <b>plate</b> moves with the constant velocity in the longitudinal direction, and the free stream velocity follows an exponentially small perturbation law. The velocity and temperature distributions are derived, discussed and their profiles shown through graphs. Also, the results of coefficient of skin-friction, {{the rate of the}} heat transfer in terms of Nusselt number and the ratio of convective to diffusive mass transport in terms of Sherwood number at the plate are prepared with various values of fluid properties and flow conditions...|$|R

40|$|As {{offshore}} energy developments {{move towards}} deeper water, moored floating production facilities are increasingly preferred to fixed structures. Anchoring systems are therefore {{of great interest}} to engineers working on deep water developments. <b>Suction</b> embedded <b>plate</b> anchors (SEPLAs) are rapidly becoming a popular solution, possessing a more accurate and predictable installation process compared to traditional alternatives. In this paper, finite element analysis has been conducted to evaluate the ultimate pullout capacity of SEPLAs in a range of post-keying configurations. Previous numerical studies of anchor pullout capacity have generally treated the soil as an elastic-perfectly plastic medium. However, the mechanical behaviour of natural clays is affected by inter-particle bonding, or structure, which cannot be accounted for using simple elasto-plastic models. Here, an advanced constitutive model formulated within the kinematic hardening framework is used to accurately predict the degradation of structure as an anchor embedded in a natural soft clay deposit is loaded to its pullout capacity. In comparison with an idealised, non-softening clay, the degradation of clay structure due to plastic strains in the soil mass results in a lower pullout capacity factor, a quantity commonly used in design, and a more complex load–displacement relationship. It can be concluded that clay structure has an important effect on the pullout behaviour of plate anchors. Peer ReviewedPostprint (author's final draft...|$|R
40|$|A {{study of}} {{unsteady}} MHD free convection flow through a porous vertical flat plate {{immersed in a}} porous medium in presence of magnetic field with radiation has been analyzed. Introducing a time dependent <b>suction</b> to the <b>plate,</b> a similarity procedure has been adopted by taking a time dependent similarity parameter. In this analysis we consider a Darcy-Forchhemier model and the corresponding momentum and energy equations have been solved numerically, for cooling and heating of the plate by employing Nachtsheim-Swigert iteration technique along with the sixth order Runge-Kutta integration scheme. Non-dimensional velocity and temperature profiles are then presented graphically for different values of the parameter entering into the problem. During the process of numerical computations the skin-friction coefficient (viscous drag) {{and the rate of}} heat transfer (Nusselt number), which are of physical interest, are sorted out and presented in the form of tables...|$|R
