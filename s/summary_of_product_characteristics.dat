40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{features of}} UK Patient Information Leaflets (PILs) as originating and shifting from the corresponding <b>Summaries</b> <b>of</b> <b>Product</b> <b>Characteristics</b> (SmPCs). PILs accompany prescription-only and over-the-counter medicines {{to ensure that}} all citizens have equal access to reliable and effective quality information. To this purpose, they have been regularly revised by pharmaceutical companies and then validated by the national departments of Health in compliance with national regulations and EU directives and regulations. Alternatively, they are now licensed for use in EU Member States by the European Medicines Agency. The discursive construction of risk (Fage-Butler 2011) and trust generation (Earle 2010) informs patient-centeredness (Balint 1969; Mead, Bower 2000) : intralinguistic and intergeneric expert-to-layman translation (Zehtsen 2007) are at work to turn highly specialized <b>Summaries</b> <b>of</b> <b>Product</b> <b>Characteristics</b> (SmPCs) into functionally adequate Patient Information Leaflets (PILs), their closer cognates. These can be seen as seats for Knowledge Dissemination (Calsamiglia, van Dijk 2004), reconceptualization and recontextualization. In his context, it is {{the purpose of this paper}} to address questions about the shift from presentation of biomedical research to interactive and patient-friendly communication that pursues engagement with the reader via recourse to general words (as against specialist terms or hypernyms), basic categories (vs. hyponyms) and, importantly, 1 st and 2 nd person conditionals and 2 nd person imperatives and question-answer patterns (as against nominalizations) ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis study {{constitutes}} an initial step towards filling {{a gap in}} corpus linguistics studies of linguistic and phraseological variation across English pharmaceutical texts, in particular in terms of recurrent linguistic patterns. The study conducted from a register- perspective (Biber & Conrad, 2009), which employs both quantitative and qualitative research procedures, aims to provide a corpus-driven description of vocabulary and phraseology, namely key words, lexical bundles, and phrase frames, used in patient information leaflets and <b>summaries</b> <b>of</b> <b>product</b> <b>characteristics</b> (represented by 463 and 146 texts, respectively) written originally in English and collected in two domain-specific custom-designed corpora. The analysis is largely based on the methodology proposed by Biber (2006, 2009), Goźdź-Roszkowski (2011) and Roemer (2009), which enables one to explore the lexico- phraseological profile of two text types and the functions of keywords, lexical bundles and phrase frames found therein, thus providing new data for a description of English used for pharmaceutical purposes. The results show that patterns of language use differ across two text types, and that the observed differences are linked with the situational and functional characteristics of patient information leaflets and <b>summaries</b> <b>of</b> <b>product</b> <b>characteristics.</b> Thus, {{the results show that}} pattern variability is not only content-related (Roemer, 2009), but also function-related.

40|$|International audienceBackground: Clinical {{practice}} {{guidelines are}} useful for physicians, and guidelines {{are available on the}} Internet from various websites such as Vidal Recos. However, these guidelines are long and difficult to read, especially during consultation. Similar difficulties have been encountered with drug <b>summaries</b> <b>of</b> <b>product</b> <b>characteristics.</b> In a previous work, we have proposed an iconic language (called VCM, for Visualization of Concepts in Medicine) for representing patient conditions, treatments and laboratory tests, and we have used these icons to design a user interface that graphically indexes <b>summaries</b> <b>of</b> <b>product</b> <b>characteristics.</b> In the current study, our objective was to design and evaluate an iconic user interface for the consultation of clinical practice guidelines by physicians. Methods: Focus groups of physicians were set up to identify the difficulties encountered when reading guidelines. Icons were integrated into Vidal Recos, taking human factors into account. The resulting interface includes a graphical summary and an iconic indexation of the guideline. The new interface was evaluated. We compared the response times and the number of errors recorded when physicians answered questions about two clinical scenarios using the interactive iconic interface or a textual interface. Users' perceived usability was evaluated with the System Usability Scale. Results: The main difficulties encountered by physicians when reading guidelines were obtaining an overview and finding recommendations for patients corresponding to "particular cases". We designed a graphical interface for guideline consultation, using icons to identify particular cases and providing a graphical <b>summary</b> <b>of</b> the icons organized by anatomy and etiology. The evaluation showed that physicians gave clinical responses more rapidly with the iconic interface than the textual interface (25. 2 seconds versus 45. 6, p < 0. 05). The physicians appreciated the new interface, and the System Usability Scale score value was 75 (between good and excellent). Conclusion: An interactive iconic interface can provide physicians with an overview of clinical practice guidelines, and can decrease the time required to access the content of such guidelines...|$|R

40|$|Although nitrate therapy, {{used in the}} {{treatment}} of cardiovascular disorders, is frequently associated with side-effects, mainly headaches, the <b>summaries</b> <b>of</b> <b>product</b> <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> nitrate-containing medicines do not report detailed description of headaches and even do not highlight the possibility of nitrate-induced migraine. Two different types of nitrate-induced headaches have been described: (i) immediate headaches that develop within the first hour of the application, are mild or medium severity without characteristic symptoms for migraine, and ease spontaneously; and (ii) delayed, moderate or severe migraine-type headaches (occurring mainly in subjects with personal or family history of migraine), that develop 3 – 6 h after the intake of nitrates, with debilitating, long-lasting symptoms including nausea, vomiting, photo- and/or phono-phobia. These two types of headaches are remarkably different, not only in their timing and symptoms, but also in the persons who are at risk. Recent studies provide evidence that the two headache types are caused by different mechanisms: immediate headaches are connected to vasodilation caused by nitric oxide (NO) release, while migraines are triggered by other actions such as the release of calcitonin gene-related peptide or glutamate, or changes in ion channel function mediated by cyclic guanosine monophosphate or S-nitrosylation. Migraines usually need anti-attack medication, such as triptans, but these drugs are contraindicated in most medical conditions that are treated using nitrates. In conclusion, these data recommend the correction <b>of</b> <b>summaries</b> <b>of</b> nitrate <b>product</b> <b>characteristics,</b> and also suggest a need to develop new types of anti-migraine drugs, effective in migraine attacks, {{that could be used in}} patients with risk for angina pectoris...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION: The lack of {{consistent}} official {{information on the}} use of medications during lactation {{is probably one of the}} main reasons leading to an excess of prudence, based on presumption of risk rather than on evidence. The objective of this study was to compare the level of agreement between different official sources available to doctors and women {{on the use of}} medications during lactation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sources of information included governmental regulatory agencies (RAs) and scientific sources (SS). The package leaflets (PLs) and <b>summaries</b> <b>of</b> <b>product</b> <b>characteristics</b> (SPCs) were retrieved from online databases of the European Union and U. S. RAs.

40|$|The {{increasing}} use of radiopharmaceuticals for positron {{emission tomography}} (PET) {{has come to the}} attention of regulatory bodies. In order to help authorities in all aspects, the EANM has formed a task group for licensing PET radiopharmaceuticals; this group has surveyed the use of these compounds in Europe by a questionnaire. The number of PET centres that responded to the questionnaire was 26, which included more than 90 % of the larger European PET centres. The survey showed that 2 -[18 F]fluoro- 2 -deoxyglucose {{is by far the most}} important PET radiopharmaceutical with more than 200 applications per week, followed by [15 O]water, [15 O]carbonmonoxide, [13 N]ammonia, [11 C]-l-methionine, andl- 6 -[18 F]fluoro-DOPA.

5000|$|The area of {{intranasal}} medication delivery {{provides a}} huge opportunity for research - both for specifically developed pharmaceutical drugs designed for intranasal treatment, {{as well as}} for investigating off label uses of commonly available generic medications. Nasal sprays for local effect are quite common. Steroids, antiasthma medications such as salbutamol, ipratropium, montelukast and a large number of inhalational anaesthetic agents are being used commonly. The recent developments in intranasal drug delivery systems are prodigious. Several antimigraine drugs, available by the trade names of Imitrex- sumatriptan; Zomig - Zolmitriptan; Migranal - Dihydroergotamine and the OTC nasal spray Sinol-M; are also currently administered by nasal administration because a fast effect is desired and oral administration can be prohibited by nausea. Peptide drugs (hormone treatments) are also available as nasal sprays, in this case to avoid drug degradation after oral administration. The peptide analogue desmopressin is, for example, available for both nasal and oral administration, for the treatment of diabetes insipidus. The bioavailability of the commercial tablet is 0.1% while that of the nasal spray is 3-5% according to the SPC (<b>Summary</b> <b>of</b> <b>Product</b> <b>Characteristics).</b> Syntocinon nasal spray containing oxytocin is used to increase duration and strength of contractions during labour. Intranasal oxytocin is also being actively investigated for many psychiatric conditions including alcohol withdrawal, anorexia nervosa, PTSD, autism, anxiety disorders, pain sensation and schizophrenia. Intranasal Calcitonin, calcitonin-salmon is used to treat Hypercalcaemia arising out of malignancy, Paget's disease of bone, post menopausal and steroid induced osteoporosis, Phantom limb pain and other metabolic bone abnormalities, available as Rockbone, Fortical and Miacalcin Nasal Spray. GnRH analogues like nafarelin and busurelin are used for the treatment of anovulatory infertility, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, delayed puberty and cryptorchidism. Other potential drug candidates for nasal administration include anaesthetics, antihistamines (Azelastine), antiemetics (particularly metoclopramide and ondansetron) and sedatives that all benefit from a fast onset of effect. Intranasal midazolam is found to be highly effective in acute episodes of seizures in children. Recently, {{the upper part of the}} nasal cavity, as high as the cribriform plate, has been proposed for drug delivery to the brain. This [...] "transcribrial route" [...] published first in 2014 was suggested by the author (Baig AM. et al,) for drugs to be given for Primary Meningoencephalitis [...] Naloxone is used intravenously in opiate addiction in emergency cases, in rapid opiate detoxification, and as a diagnostic tool. The nasal drug administration of naloxone was found to be as effective as the intravenous route. In opioid overdoses, where hypotension and sometimes damaged veins make intravenous administration difficult, nasal naloxone offers a wide margin of safety and reduced risk of infection from vessel puncture while enabling even untrained bystanders to assist a victim. The prevention of abnormal nasal blood vessel growth (Avastin) and even the delivery of medications and drug antidotes such as hydroxocobalamin (antidote to cyanide poisoning) are being developed via intranasal medications. More recently interest is developing on delivery of a number of peptides and other drugs to the nose for direct transport into the brain to treat neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's. Intranasal insulin is being investigated for treatment of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. IN ketamine, commonly being used for the treatment of breakthrough pain in patients with chronic pain is now becoming an area of significant research interest for the treatment of bipolar disease and major depressive disorder with early results suggesting a strong and prolonged antidepressant effect following a single subdissociative dose (50 mg) of ketamine.|$|E

METHODS All medicines administered to neonates during 1 day with individual prescription and demographic data were registered in a web-based point prevalence study. Excipients were identified from the <b>Summaries</b> <b>of</b> <b>Product</b> <b>Characteristics.</b> Determinants <b>of</b> EOI administration (geographical region, gestational age (GA), active pharmaceutical ingredient, unit level and hospital teaching status) were identified using multivariable logistical regression analysis. RESULTS Overall 89 neonatal units from 21 countries participated. Altogether 2095 prescriptions for 530 products administered to 726 neonates were recorded. EOI were found in 638 (31 %) prescriptions and were administered to 456 (63 %) neonates through {{a relatively small number}} <b>of</b> <b>products</b> (n= 142; 27 %). Parabens, found in 71 (13 %) products administered to 313 (43 %) neonates, were used most frequently. EOI administration varied by geographical region, GA and route of administration. Geographical region remained a significant determinant of the use of parabens, polysorbate 80, propylene glycol and saccharin sodium after adjustment for the potential covariates including anatomical therapeutic chemical class of the active ingredient.

Our {{aim was to}} describe the extent of excipient intake by Estonian neonates; to classify the excipients according to potential neonatal toxicity and thereby to measure the extent of exposure of neonates to potentially harmful excipients. Methods A prospective cohort study that recorded all medicines prescribed to patients aged below 28 [*]days admitted to Tartu University Hospital from 01. 02 - 01. 08 2008 and to Tallinn Children’s Hospital from 01. 02 - 01. 08 2009 was conducted. Excipients were identified from <b>Summaries</b> <b>of</b> <b>Product</b> <b>Characteristics</b> and classified according to toxicity following a literature review. Results 1961 prescriptions comprising 107 medicines were written for 348 / 490 neonates admitted. A total of 123 excipients were found in 1620 (83 %) prescriptions and 93 (87 %) medicines. 47 (38 %) of these excipients were classified as potentially or known to be harmful to neonates. Most neonates (97 %) received at least one medicine (median number 2) with potentially or known to be harmful excipient. Parabens were {{the most commonly used}} known to be harmful excipients and sodium metabisulphite the most commonly used potentially harmful excipient, received by 343 (99 %) and 297 (85 %) of treated neonates, respectively. Conclusions Hospitalised neonates in Estonia are commonly receiving a wide range of excipients with their medication. Quantitative information about excipients should be made available to pharmacists and neonatologists helping them to take into account excipient issues when selecting medicines and to monitor for adverse effects if administration of medicines containing excipients is unavoidable. </p...|$|R

The {{study was conducted with}} prescription sequence analysis of each resident's detailed pharmacy records and data on morbidity and mobility. Results Use of drugs, which according to the <b>summaries</b> <b>of</b> <b>product</b> <b>characteristics</b> (SPC) and the literature on adverse drug effects have moderately to strongly constipating properties, was associated with a relative risk of 1. 59 (95 % CI 1. 24 - 2. 04) for the occurrence of constipation during exposure time. Use of drugs with mildly to moderately constipating effects was not associated with laxative use (RR 1. 13; 95 % CI 0. 93 - 1. 38). Stratification on the level of age, gender, type of nursing (psychogeriatric or somatic), morbidity, number of medications taken and mobility showed no confounding effects of these variables on outcome measurements. These variables all acted as effect modifiers. Effect of age and number of medications taken on the relative risk was nonlinear. Conclusions Although an association between drugs that exhibit moderately to strongly constipating effects and occurrence of constipation was found, the risk was not as high as seen in previous studies. The high prevalence of constipation in nursing home patients is only partly due to adverse drug effects...|$|R
