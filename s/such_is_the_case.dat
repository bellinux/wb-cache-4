5|$|The Guilden Morden boar {{recalls the}} Anglo-Saxon poem Beowulf, where helmets with boar imagery are {{referenced}} five times. In three cases {{they appear to}} feature freestanding boars atop the helmets, like the Guilden Morden example. <b>Such</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> when Grendel's mother seeks vengeance {{for the death of}} her son.|$|E
5|$|The biblical view of {{the late}} Iron Age {{political}} and cultural map describes it {{as a set of}} branching genealogies. Biblical figures three generations forward from Terah are invariably described as the eponymous founders of different tribes and polities that interacted with the Kingdom of Judah between the 8th and 6th centuries BCE. <b>Such</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> of the Qedarite Arabs, who according to biblical tradition, are the offspring of the Abraham-Ishmael-Kedar genealogical line.|$|E
5|$|Advances {{during the}} last decades {{has led to the}} recent {{approval}} of several oral drugs. These drugs are expected to gain in popularity and frequency of use at the expense of previously existing therapies. Further oral drugs are still under investigation, the most notable example being laquinimod, which was announced in August 2012 to be the focus of a third phase III trial after mixed results in the previous ones. Similarly, Other studies are aimed to improve efficacy and ease of use of already existing therapies through the use of novel preparations. <b>Such</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> the PEGylated version of interferon-β-1a, that has a longer life than normal interferon and therefore it is being studied if given at less frequent doses has a similar efficacy than the existing product. With the completion of a robust two-year study, it is shown that the PEGylated interferon beta-1a has greater efficacy in decreasing relapse rate and disability progression compared to placebo for MS patients.|$|E
25|$|When bridge {{construction}} resumed, toll bridges were often constructed {{on the site}} of ferry routes. <b>Such</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> at Willington, Gunthorpe and Gainsborough.|$|R
25|$|It <b>was</b> {{presumed that}} <b>the</b> {{co-pilot}} <b>was</b> under flight instruction. If <b>such</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case,</b> <b>the</b> instructor, who <b>was</b> pilot-in-command, may {{have failed to}} brief or supervise the co-pilot properly.|$|R
2500|$|Pamphlets {{also offered}} playwrights an {{opportunity}} to write and be published in those times when the plague had closed <b>the</b> theatres. [...] <b>Such</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> with Shakespeare's Venus and Adonis and Nashe's Pierce Penniless, which were both written and published when <b>the</b> theatres <b>were</b> closed from 1592–1593.|$|R
5|$|Batesian mimicry {{is a case}} of {{protective}} or defensive mimicry, where the mimic does best by avoiding confrontations with the signal receiver. It is a disjunct system, which means that all three parties are from different species. Batesian mimicry stands in contrast to other forms such as aggressive mimicry, where the mimic profits from interactions with the signal receiver. One such case of this is in fireflies, where females of one species mimic the mating signals of another species, deceiving males to come close enough for them to eat. Mimicry need not involve a predator at all though. <b>Such</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> in dispersal mimicry, where the mimic once again benefits from the encounter. For instance, some fungi have their spores dispersed by insects by smelling like carrion. In protective mimicry, the meeting between mimic and dupe is not such a fortuitous occasion for the mimic, and the signals it mimics tend to lower the probability of such an encounter.|$|E
5|$|The game is {{sometimes}} {{played with the}} larger and heavier (and unnumbered) carom billiard balls instead of pocket billiard balls. <b>Such</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> at the Union Club and was also at the University of Michigan Billiards & Games Room, where the faculty devoted {{most of their time}} to bottle pool. Not incidentally three-cushion billiards, which uses these larger balls, was also a mainstay in that room and touring three-cushion professional Carl Conlon was a fixture there until his death in 1997. In this variation, a solid-yellow (or dotted) second cue ball is used in place of the 1 ball, and the red ball, known traditionally as the , is used in place of the 2 ball. The use of such balls makes scoring by caroms easier, but makes pocketing balls (and scratching) more difficult because the larger balls must still be made in the ordinarily-sized pool pockets.|$|E
25|$|The Taliban {{frequently}} used the pre-Islamic Pashtun tribal code, Pashtunwali, in deciding certain social matters. <b>Such</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> with the Pashtun practice of dividing inheritances equally among sons, {{even though the}} Qur'an clearly states that women are to receive one-half a man's share.|$|E
50|$|A {{facelift}} {{may include}} a change to <b>the</b> vehicle's name; <b>such</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> when Ford renamed their Five Hundred model {{to be their}} Ford Taurus in 2008. The facelifts of the Citroën DS3, DS4 and DS5 even changed the brand under which these models fell to DS instead of Citroën.|$|R
50|$|During the Spanish Civil War, {{the country}} {{split into two}} {{different}} centralized economies, and the whole economic effort <b>was</b> redirected to <b>the</b> war industry. According to recent research, growth is harmed during civil wars due to the huge contraction on private investment, and <b>such</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> with <b>the</b> Spanish divided economy.|$|R
50|$|Dominicans were {{forbidden}} to own buildings and land, but <b>such</b> property could <b>be</b> held in trust for them. <b>Such</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> with Blackfriars, which <b>was</b> situated in <b>the</b> north west of Newcastle just inside the city walls. The friary covered seven acres (2.83 hectares), but also had two gardens and four small closes that provided a small income.|$|R
25|$|Youth-driven {{activism}} requires {{young people}} {{to be the primary}} movers within an adult-led movement. <b>Such</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> with the Sierra Club, where youth compel their peers to join and become active in the environmental movement. This is also true of many organizations that were founded by youth who became adults, such as SEAC and National Youth Rights Association.|$|E
25|$|The word {{cooperative}} is {{also used}} to describe a non-share capital co-op model in which fee-paying members obtain the right to occupy a bedroom and share the communal resources of a house that is owned by a cooperative organization. <b>Such</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> with student cooperatives in some college and university communities across the United States.|$|E
25|$|The {{scholarly}} {{interpretation of}} the eagle being the Roman Empire (the eagle in the fifth vision, whose heads might be Vespasian, Titus and Domitian if <b>such</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case)</b> {{and the destruction of}} the temple would indicate that the probable date of composition lies {{toward the end of the}} first century, perhaps 90–96, though some suggest a date as late as 218.|$|E
50|$|Although {{economically}} successful, company towns sometimes failed politically {{due to a}} lack {{of elected}} officials and municipally owned services. Accordingly, workers often had no say in local affairs and therefore, felt dictated. Ultimately, this political climate caused resentment amongst workers and resulted in many residents eventually losing long-term affection for their towns; <b>such</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> at Pullman.|$|R
50|$|Family-based {{organized}} crime groups were formed among Georgian Jewish immigrants to Israel as well. Georgian-Jewish crime {{families have been}} able to expand their operations to Western European cities such as Antwerp. They are involved in counterfeiting, fraud, money laundering, drug trafficking, weapon trafficking, prostitution and armed robbery. <b>Such</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> with <b>the</b> Georgian-Jewish Melikhov clan in Antwerp.|$|R
50|$|Culture often {{becomes a}} target of social {{movements}} when their demands {{have to do with}} personal action. <b>Such</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> with <b>the</b> feminist movement, in which organizations put a large amount of resources to books, magazines, art, and other channels of culture; this has been shown to contribute to the shift in family dynamics and institutional structures.|$|R
25|$|Among the Spanish-speaking Catholics, most {{communities}} {{celebrate their}} homeland's patron saint, dedicating {{a day for}} this purpose with festivals and religious services. Some Spanish-speakers syncretize Roman Catholicism and African or Native American rituals and beliefs. <b>Such</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> of Santería, popular with Afro-Cubans, which combines old African beliefs {{in the form of}} Roman Catholic saints and rituals. Other syncretistic beliefs include Spiritism and Curanderismo.|$|E
25|$|In some countries, {{there has}} been a move toward harm {{reduction}} by health services, where the use of illicit drugs is neither condoned nor promoted, but services and support are provided to ensure users have adequate factual information readily available, and that the negative effects of their use be minimized. <b>Such</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> of Portuguese drug policy of decriminalization, which achieved its primary goal of reducing the adverse health effects of drug abuse.|$|E
25|$|The {{national}} legislation had little relevance on private law, {{though it did}} partially influence {{on the work of}} the Coder. <b>Such</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> of the hereditary vocation of the article 3,572, whose antecedent is the law dictated by the legislature of the Buenos Aires Province dictated on May 22, 1857. Vélez had also in mind the uses and customs of the country, especially regarding the family organisation.|$|E
25|$|Hispanics held various {{grades of}} {{ranks in the}} {{military}}, the highest being full Admiral of the Union Navy. Three Hispanics <b>were</b> awarded <b>the</b> Medal of Honor, the highest military decoration for heroism awarded by the United States. Hispanic women also participated, <b>such</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> of Loreta Janeta Velazquez, a Cuban woman who disguised as a male, fought and spied for the Confederacy.|$|R
50|$|Before the Industrial Revolution, {{companies}} were a relatively rare business form. Until 1844, {{there was no}} comprehensive legislation governing companies, so {{that they had to}} be incorporated by a specific Act of Parliament, or by the granting of a royal charter in Europe. <b>Such</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> with <b>the</b> British East India Company in 1600 and the Dutch East India Company in 1602.|$|R
50|$|After the Civil War ended, those {{officers}} {{remaining in}} the United States Armed Forces found lieutenant colonel to again be a terminal rank, although many lieutenant colonels were raised to higher positions in a brevet status. <b>Such</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> with George A. Custer, who was a lieutenant colonel in the regular army, but held the brevet rank of major general.|$|R
25|$|Ritual: green {{obsidian}} ornaments as rich offerings {{for high}} rank individuals. <b>Such</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> of pieces found within skull in some burials, {{as if these}} {{were placed in the}} person’s mouth; these pieces are spherical or semi-square and always of green stone. In these same conditions a small rectangular piece was found, with an edge perforation, of a dark green stone and so polished that it seems mirror.|$|E
25|$|The {{curse of}} lycanthropy was also {{considered}} by some scholars as being a divine punishment. Werewolf literature shows many examples of God or saints allegedly cursing those who invoked their wrath with werewolfism. <b>Such</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> of Lycaon, who {{was turned into a}} wolf by Zeus as punishment for slaughtering one of his own sons and serving his remains to the gods as a dinner. Those who were excommunicated by the Roman Catholic Church were also said to become werewolves.|$|E
25|$|It is {{important}} to distinguish between brain death and states that {{may be difficult to}} differentiate from brain death, (such as barbiturate overdose, alcohol intoxication, sedative overdose, hypothermia, hypoglycemia, coma, and chronic vegetative states). Some comatose patients can recover to pre-coma or near pre-coma level of functioning, and some patients with severe irreversible neurological dysfunction will nonetheless retain some lower brain functions, such as spontaneous respiration, despite the losses of both cortex and brain stem functionality. <b>Such</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> with anencephaly.|$|E
50|$|As {{happened}} on numerous other occasions, such storms produced a large moist and warm {{flow from the}} Gulf of Mexico as well as lots of instability in <b>the</b> atmosphere. <b>Being</b> in May, storm systems produced large contrasts of temperatures, which added more ingredients {{for the development of}} powerful thunderstorms with possible damaging tornadoes. <b>Such</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> on May 10, 1905.|$|R
2500|$|Place naming in 17th century Europe was {{frequently}} influenced by location {{in reference to}} other places, shape, age, topography, or geographic features. <b>Such</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> with Achter Kol (Meadowlands/Newark Bay). [...] "Achter", meaning behind, and [...] "kol", meaning ridge or pass, can <b>be</b> translated as <b>the</b> [...] "behind the ridge", in this <b>case</b> Bergen Neck. <b>The</b> appeal of Achter Kol would have been great: ...|$|R
50|$|Foreigners {{who have}} {{acquired}} Norwegian citizenship may lose {{it if they}} are found to have lied about their origins, <b>such</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> of about 100 Somalis who along with their children born in Norway lost their citizenship and right of residence after it turned out they were from neighbouring countries. This is considered an affront to Norwegian society which is built on trust.|$|R
25|$|Secondly, allocating {{monetary}} value to nature would make its conservation reliant on markets that fluctuate. This {{can lead to}} devaluation of services that were previously considered financially beneficial. <b>Such</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> of the bees in a forest near former coffee plantations in Finca Santa Fe, Costa Rica. The pollination services were valued to over US$60,000 a year, but soon after the study, coffee prices dropped and the fields were replanted with pineapple. Pineapple does not require bees to be pollinated, so {{the value of their}} service dropped to zero.|$|E
25|$|Dutch dialects are {{primarily}} the dialects {{that are both}} related with the Dutch language and are spoken in the same language area as the Dutch standard language. Although heavily {{under the influence of}} the standard language, some of them remain remarkably diverse and are found in the Netherlands and northern Belgium. The area where they are spoken often correspond with former mediaeval counties and duchies. The Netherlands (but not Belgium) makes a distinction between a dialect and a streektaal ("regional language"). These words are actually more political than linguistic, because a regional language unite a large group of very differing varieties. <b>Such</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> with the Gronings dialect, which is considered a variety of the Dutch Low Saxon regional language, but is in fact very distinct from other Low Saxon varieties due to a Frisian substrate. Also, some Dutch dialects are more remote from the Dutch standard language than some varieties of a regional language are. <b>Such</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> with West Flemish, which is considered a Dutch dialect but is far more remote from the standard language than most Dutch Low Saxon varieties are. Within the Netherlands, a further distinction is made between a regional language and a separate language, which is the case with the (standardised) West Frisian language. It is spoken next to Dutch in the province of Friesland.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the districts, there are Territorial Units with Special Status. These usually include areas with small or no permanent populations. <b>Such</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> with the All-Russia Exhibition Centre, the Botanical Garden, large parks, and industrial zones. In recent years, some territories have been merged with different districts. There are no ethnic-specific regions in Moscow, as in the Chinatowns that exist in some North American and East Asian cities. And although districts are not designated by income, as with most cities, those areas that are closer to the city center, metro stations or green zones are considered more prestigious.|$|E
30|$|The Tedlar and Plexiglas layers {{were used}} in {{alternate}} orders (arrangements 4 and 5) to evaluate {{whether or not there}} was Cherenkov radiation produced out of the source volume. If <b>such</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case,</b> in <b>case</b> 5, <b>the</b> amplitude of <b>the</b> signal would <b>be</b> smaller than in 4. The remaining component in case 5 would be an indication of the importance of the direct detection of high energy photons.|$|R
30|$|<b>Such</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> with South Tyneside NHS Foundation Trust, a {{provider}} of acute and community health services in northeast England that understands the importance of providing high quality, safe and compassionate care for the patients at all times, but needs {{a better understanding of}} how its hospitals operate to improve resource allocation and wait times and to ensure that any issues are identified early and acted upon [4].|$|R
5|$|For {{the purpose}} of {{reproduction}} most amphibians require fresh water although some lay their eggs on land and have developed various means of keeping them moist. A few (e.g. Fejervarya raja) can inhabit brackish water, {{but there are no}} true marine amphibians. There are reports, however, of particular amphibian populations unexpectedly invading marine waters. <b>Such</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> with <b>the</b> Black Sea invasion of the natural hybrid Pelophylax esculentus reported in 2010.|$|R
