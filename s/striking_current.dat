At night, a network of 4,000 low-voltage tungsten-halogen bulbs illuminate the bridge. In 1993 the innovative use of long-life low-energy lighting was commended by Mary Archer, at the time Chairwoman of the National Energy Foundation.

The obtained average activation energy for dipole relaxation is in very close agreement with the DX center binding energy. Monochromatic light induces state transition in the defect and makes possible the identification of dipoles observed in the dark. Charge relaxation currents are destroyed by photoionization of Al 0. 5 Ga 0. 5 As using either 647 nm Kr+ or 488 nm Ar+ laser lines, which are above the DX center threshold photoionization energy.

40|$|Breaches of biosecurity, {{leading to}} incursions by {{invasive}} species, {{have the potential}} to cause substantial economic, social and environmental losses, including drastic reduction in biodiversity. It is argued that improving biosecurity reduces risk to biodiversity, while maintaining stable ecosystems through biodiversity can be a safeguard against biosecurity breaches. The global costs of invasive alien species (IAS) have been estimated at around US$ 350 billion, while alien invertebrate and vertebrate pests and weeds are estimated to cost Australia at least $ 7 billion a year. A <b>striking,</b> <b>current,</b> example is the incursion by Myrtle Rust (Puccinia psidii) an organism which can infect all members of the Myrtaceae, the most important family in the Australian flora. Myrtle rust was first detected on a property on the central coast of New South Wales in late April 2010. Two years later the disease has been detected in numerous locations in Queensland and New South Wales ranging from commercial plant nurseries and public amenities to large areas of bushland. This particular breach of biosecurity will, inevitably, diminish biodiversity of flora and fauna over large areas of the continent. Integrated pest management (IPM), an enrichment of diversity in managing invasive and other pest species, offers the best opportunity to address problems such as these. Australia's response to increasing biosecurity risk is comprehensive and includes national networking of scientists engaged in a complex program of biosecurity research and development, including studies of IPM. This network is being enhanced by the development of international linkages...|$|E

40|$|AbstractLightning {{overvoltage}} is {{the major}} cause of the transmission line interruption in Malaysia. It {{is the main reason}} that endangers the safety and reliability of transmission line system. The phenomenon is a dominant factor considered in designing substations and transmission-line insulation, therefore its investigation is important. This work modelled a 132 kV overhead transmission line for shielding failure pattern recognition by using ATP-EMTP software, as they are vital to the evaluation of lightning performance. The modelled transmission-line is divided into few parts: wires (shield wires and phase conductors), towers, cross-arms, insulator strings, tower-surge impedance and tower-footing resistance. The developed model is simulated with four different magnitudes of lightning-strike current on each phase conductor in order to investigate the shielding failure voltage pattern across the line insulation in the transmission line system. When the lightning- <b>strike</b> <b>current</b> is injected from upper phase to lower phase conductor, the magnitude of the maximum induced voltage across the insulator string at those phases has been decreased. On the other hand, as the magnitude of the lightning- <b>strike</b> <b>current</b> has been increased, the magnitude of the maximum induced voltage across the insulator string at each phase will be increased. Flashover occurs when the voltage induced across the insulator string at each phase is equal or exceeds the CFO voltage. These analyses have been done based on the waveforms obtained from the simulations on developed model...|$|R

40|$|An {{analysis}} of the shielding properties of mixed metal and graphite composite structures has illustrated some important aspects of electromagnetic field penetration into the interior.

A transfer function technique can then be used to study the response of the aircraft to a given lightning <b>strike</b> <b>current.</b> Conversely, the lightning current can be inferred from the measured response.

Therefore, effective and economical lightning protection measures are necessary for railway signaling systems because suspended operation or train delays due to lightning damage may cause social disruption. For analyzing lightning risk and making study for countermeasures against lightning damage, must measure the lightning overvoltage on railway signaling cables, which were laid at the ground surface and overhead, and rails {{in the field to}} enable quantitative analysis of the frequency of lightning overvoltage occurrence. Moreover, we investigated the correlation of lightning overvoltage (V) on signaling cables and rails with lightning conditions, such as the <b>strike</b> <b>current</b> (I) and the strike position (distance from the measuring position). From this we deduced the correlation between the lightning overvoltage (V) and (I), expressed as a linear expression.

40|$|Lightning is a {{major problem}} in a {{transmission}} line system. Lightning which occurs around the world will give a huge effect on electrical transmission system and also on distribution system division. Lightning-strike commonly generated in two different ways. One of the ways is direct strike to a wire shield (tower top) and another way is shielding failure. A direct-strike to the wire shield generates back flashover as a result of voltage on insulator string magnitude is equal or exceeds the critical flashover voltage (CFO). Therefore, the insulation of surge arrester on transmission line is the way to reducing and finally solving the back flashover problem. This study modelled a 132 kV overhead transmission line for back flashover pattern by using ATP/EMTP software before and after implement the Haddad Surge Arrester Model.

5|$|It was {{recognized}} {{early on that}} SiC had such a voltage-dependent resistance, and so columns of SiC pellets were connected between high-voltage power lines and the earth. When a lightning strike to the line raises the line voltage sufficiently, the SiC column will conduct, allowing <b>strike</b> <b>current</b> to pass harmlessly to the earth instead of along the power line. Such SiC columns proved to conduct significantly at normal power-line operating voltages and thus had {{to be placed in}} series with a spark gap. This spark gap is ionized and rendered conductive when lightning raises the voltage of the power line conductor, thus effectively connecting the SiC column between the power conductor and the earth. Spark gaps used in lightning arresters are unreliable, either failing to strike an arc when needed or failing to turn off afterwards, in the latter case due to material failure or contamination by dust or salt. Usage of SiC columns was originally intended to eliminate the need for the spark gap in a lightning arrester. Gapped SiC lightning arresters were used as lightning-protection tool and sold under GE and Westinghouse brand names, among others. The gapped SiC arrester has been largely displaced by no-gap varistors that use columns of zinc oxide pellets.|$|R
