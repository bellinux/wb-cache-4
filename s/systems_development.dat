5|$|The postwar {{years were}} spent {{implementing}} {{the lessons of}} the Yom Kippur War. SEAD tactics were improved, training was stepped up and innovative technologies introduced. The Hammers cooperated with Rafael, Israel's weapon <b>systems</b> <b>development</b> authority, in the introduction of the Tadmit electro-optical fire-and-forget guided bomb, {{a modified version of the}} AGM-62 Walleye II. At the same time, the Phantom's air-to-air role was diminished with the introduction into service of the F-15 Eagle and the F-16 Fighting Falcon. The squadron was, nonetheless, the first IAF squadron to introduce Rafael's Python 3 into service in March 1977. Air-to-air training continued and on December 29, 1977, during combat against a pair of F-15s, two squadron aircraft collided. Squadron leader Avsha Friedman and navigator Avihu Ikar were killed. The remains of their aircraft, Kurnass 305, stand as a memorial to the two pilots on the Acre-Carmiel road. On January 20, 1981, the squadron lost another pilot in similar circumstances, when Kurnass 222 collided with F-16 222. Squadron leader Eliezer Adar ejected, but Dani Weiss was killed, as was the F-16 pilot, Uri Ben-Amitai.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{research}} suggests that financial <b>system</b> <b>development</b> is important for economic development and for reducing financing constraints of firms (Levine, 2005). Consequently, researchers started investigating the factors that determine financial <b>system</b> <b>development.</b> A group of factors that have been identified are institutional factors. Many researchers have investigated the theoretical and empirical links among historical institutional factors, current institutional factors, and financial <b>system</b> <b>development</b> (Beck and Levine, 2005). There are, however, few studies that have investigated extensively the theoretical and empirical links among institutional factors and financial <b>system</b> <b>development</b> within the African context. Africa provides an interesting context to empirically validate and refine many of the theories that have been postulated to explain the relationships among historical and current institutional factors and financial <b>system</b> <b>development.</b> This is because Africa {{is in the process}} of developing its institutions and reforming existing ones and offers an opportunity to examine the impact of institutional factors on financial <b>system</b> <b>development</b> in nascent contexts. Therefore, this dissertation investigated the following research question: To what extent are institutional factors determinants of financial <b>system</b> <b>development</b> in Africa? To answer this research question, this study empirically evaluated the effects on financial <b>system</b> <b>development</b> of historical institutional factors that have been identified by four theories: legal origins theory, disease endowment theory, religion-based theory, and ethnic fractionalisation theory. Moreover, current institutional factors identified by the law and finance theory as possible determinants of financial <b>system</b> <b>development</b> were empirically examined. Furthermore, the links among historical and current institutional factors were empirically studied. The results show that the disease endowment variables are the only historical institutional factors that explain cross-country variation in financial <b>system</b> <b>development</b> in Africa. Additionally, this study finds that the institutional enforcement quality and efficiency of the judicial system are the only current institutional factors that explain cross-country variation in financial <b>system</b> <b>development</b> in Africa. Current institutional factors such as the efficiency of the legal property system and the quality of the credit information infrastructure do not appear to have effects on financial <b>system</b> <b>development.</b> Moreover, the institutional enforcement quality seems to be one of the possible channels through which disease endowment affects financial <b>system</b> <b>development</b> in Africa. This study also reveals that there are few statistically significant links among historical and current institutional factors within the African context. To my knowledge, this is the first study to show some of these empirical links among historical institutional factors, current institutional factors, and financial <b>system</b> <b>development</b> for the African context. The main conclusion of this dissertation is that institutional factors seem not to be determinants of financial <b>system</b> <b>development</b> in Africa to a large extent. In essence, institutional factors appear to matter for financial <b>system</b> <b>development</b> in Africa, but not as much as might have been expected judging from many calls for institutional reforms from the World Bank and others. The theoretical and policy implications of the findings of this dissertation are discussed, and future areas of research are also proposed...|$|R
