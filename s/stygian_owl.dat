50|$|The <b>stygian</b> <b>owl</b> lays two eggs in stick nests {{created by}} other birds, but occasionally, they will nest on the ground, like their relative, the short-eared owl.|$|E
50|$|Being {{a coastal}} and marine park, it {{contains}} a large variety of birds, including most of the species endemic to the country. These include the brown pelican or alcatraz (Pelecanus occidentalis), magnificent frigatebird (Fregata magnificens), Hispaniolan amazon (Amazona ventralis), barn owl (Tyto alba), and <b>stygian</b> <b>owl</b> (Asio stygius). Some of the bird species found in Los Haitises are not found elsewhere within the Dominican Republic.|$|E
5000|$|Birds of Cuba's moist forests {{include the}} Cuban tody (Todus multicolor), bee hummingbird (Mellisuga helenae), Cuban trogon (Priotelus temnurus), Cuban {{solitaire}} (Myadestes elisabeth), hook-billed kite (Chondrohierax uncinatus), red-legged honeycreeper (Cyanerpes cyaneus), Cuban parakeet (Aratinga euops), <b>stygian</b> <b>owl</b> (Asio stygius) and Gundlach's hawk (Accipiter gundlachi). [...] The rare Cuban solenodon (Solenodon cubanus), a small mammal, is endemic to eastern montane forests. Other notable mammals include the hutias, 4-5 species of small to medium-sized, climbing rodents {{related to the}} Guinea Pig.|$|E
50|$|Like most bats, the Cuban flower bat is nocturnal. It {{spends the}} day in colonies of several {{thousand}} individuals in narrow, blind-ending cave galleries. Such caves are often shared with other species of bat, including the Cuban fruit-eating bat, the buffy flower bat and various moustached bats. During the night, Cuban flower bats feed primarily on seeds and flower pollen {{from a wide range}} of plants, although they do also eat some flying insects. They are typically gregarious animals, flying in groups of up to thirty individuals during the night. The main predators of Cuban flower bats include barn <b>owls,</b> <b>stygian</b> <b>owls,</b> and Cuban boas.|$|R
5000|$|... 681 {{species of}} birds have been reported, {{including}} herons and egrets (Egretta and Ardea genera), whistling ducks (Dendrocygninae family), sharp-tailed ibis (Cercibis oxycerca), ibis (Theristicus genus), and the roseate spoonbill (Platalea ajaja). Endemic birds include ash-throated crake (Mustelirallus albicollis), plain-breasted ground dove (Columbina minuta), red-shouldered macaw (Diopsittaca nobilis), green-rumped parrotlet (Forpus passerinus), scaled ground cuckoo (Neomorphus squamiger), and <b>stygian</b> <b>owl</b> (Asio stygius).Endangered birds include sun parakeet (Aratinga solstitialis), wattled curassow (Crax globulosa), varzea piculet (Picumnus varzeae), green-thighed parrot (P'ionites leucogaster) and red-necked aracari (Pteroglossus bitorquatus).|$|E
50|$|In the Massif de la Hotte alone {{there are}} 42 {{globally}} threatened mammals, birds, {{reptiles and amphibians}} which need conservation efforts. The coastal zone ecosystem has been fairly well preserved and has coral reefs, mangrove forests and estuaries. Coral reefs {{are not part of}} the national parks. There are 38 species under the threatened and endangered list and some of them may have been extirpated too. Of these, nearly 50% are endemic and threatened with extinction and three are critically threatened. The critically endangered species are black-capped petrel, Ridgway's hawk (also endemic), <b>stygian</b> <b>owl,</b> and western chat-tanager and eastern chat-tanager, both endemic.|$|E
50|$|Native {{species of}} bird include the rufous-capped warbler, common crossbill, pine siskin, eastern bluebird, <b>stygian</b> <b>owl,</b> king vulture, ocellated turkey, acorn woodpecker, Lesson's motmot, plumbeous vireo, keel-billed toucan and red-lored parrot. Winter {{visitors}} include the hepatic tanager and chipping sparrow. Orange-breasted falcons {{are more common}} in the area than elsewhere in Belize. Other fauna present in the reserve are the frog species Rana juliani (which is restricted to the Maya Mountains) and Eleutherodactylus sandersoni, and the fish species Poecilia teresae. The pine forest has been seriously damaged by the southern pine beetle, Dendroctonus frontalis, with 80% of the trees showing signs of attack.|$|E
50|$|The <b>stygian</b> <b>owl</b> (Asio stygius) is a {{medium-sized}} dusky colored owl. It has yellow eyes, a black beak, a dark blackish facial disk, and white eyebrows. Its underparts are a dingy buff color with dark brown barring and streaks. The upperparts are reverse, buff barring and streaks {{on a dark}} background.This owl occupies a variety of deciduous and evergreen forests, and open areas with patchy forest. It lives from sea level to 3100 m above.This species takes {{in a variety of}} prey including birds, small mammals, reptiles, amphibians, crustaceans, and insects. All of its hunting is done at night.|$|E
5000|$|The {{combination}} of the species' bulk, prominent ear-tufts and barred plumage distinguishes it {{through much of the}} range, but it may be easily confused with the lesser or Magellanic horned owl (B. magellanicus), which may overlap in range. The Magellanic horned owl was once considered a subspecies of the great horned, but is now almost universally considered a distinct species, as is supported by genetic materials, with the great horned being the paraspecies. Overall coloration is similar, but the Magellanic is markedly smaller with smaller feet and a smaller head, with finer but more numerous brownish bars on the underside, rather than the blotchy irregular barring typical of great horned owls. Other eagle-owls may superficially be somewhat similar, but the species is generically allopatric with the exception of wintering snowy owls. More tropical species with ear tufts, the <b>stygian</b> <b>owl</b> (A. stygius) and striped owl (Pseudoscops clamator), are much smaller. Other large owls lack ear tufts ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract This paper {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} that the structural components of vegetation have impact over the distribution of owl species in a fragment of a semi-deciduous seasonal forest. This paper also determined which vegetation variables contributed to the spatial distribution of owl species. It was developed in the Perobas Biological Reserve (PBR) between September and December 2011. To conduct the owl census, a playback technique was applied at hearing points distributed to cover different vegetation types in the study area. A total of 56 individual owls of six species were recorded: Tropical Screech-Owl (Megascops choliba), Black-capped Screech-Owl (Megascops atricapilla), Tawny-browed Owl (Pulsatrix koeniswaldiana), Ferruginous Pygmy-Owl (Glaucidium brasilianum), Mottled Owl (Strix virgata) and <b>Stygian</b> <b>Owl</b> (Asio stygius). The results suggest that the variables of vegetation structure have impact on the occurrence of owls. The canopy height, the presence of hollow trees, fallen trees and glades are the most important structural components influencing owl distribution in the sampled area...|$|E
