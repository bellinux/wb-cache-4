25|$|As Alabama entered their contest against Kentucky, {{they gained}} one {{position}} the rankings to No. 19 and the Wildcats entered the rankings at No. 15 {{in the weekly}} AP Poll. In the game, the Crimson Tide battled the Wildcats to a 7–7 tie {{in the first game}} played at Legion Field of the season. After a scoreless first, Holt Rast blocked a Kentucky punt that was recovered by Alabama at the Wildcats' two-yard line. Two plays later, Paul Spencer scored on a short run and Bud Waites converted the extra point to give the Crimson Tide a 7–0 lead. <b>Still</b> <b>down</b> by a touchdown {{at the end of the}} third, Kentucky tied the game in the fourth on a short Noah Mullins run and Jim Hardin extra point. The tie brought Alabama's all-time record against Kentucky 17–1–1.|$|E
25|$|In August 1947, Barrington {{was asked}} to join the groundstaff of the prestigious Surrey County Cricket Club at the Kennington Oval in South London for the {{following}} season. From April 1948, he commuted to London by railway for his training, having yet to see a first-class cricket match. The Chief Coach was Andy Sandham who thought his leg-spin bowling lacked accuracy (Surrey had Jim Laker and Tony Lock so did not need another spinner) and made him concentrate on his batting. Alec Bedser predicted that Barrington was a future Test player and Sandham later stated that Barrington was his best pupil. He worked on preparing the vast Oval ground for first-class cricket and played for the Surrey Club and Ground cricket team, though <b>still</b> <b>down</b> the order. In the 1949 season he only had time to play one game, making 52 against Kew before he was called up for National Service.|$|E
25|$|After {{their close}} victory over Tulane, the Crimson Tide dropped one {{position}} to the No. 16 {{spot in the}} weekly poll. In their game against Georgia Tech Alabama fell behind 14–0 after the first quarter, but a pair of second half touchdowns gave the Crimson Tide a 14–14 tie against the Yellow Jackets at Grant Field. Georgia Tech took an early 14–0 lead after W. C. Gibson threw a 16-yard touchdown pass to George Smith and W. H. Ector scored on a two-yard run. <b>Still</b> <b>down</b> 14–0 {{as they entered the}} third quarter, Alabama scored their first points of the game on a three-yard Alvin Davis touchdown run to cap a 57-yard drive. The Crimson Tide then tied the game in the fourth when they executed a hook and lateral play, with Davis crossing the endzone line for a 66-yard touchdown. Alabama was then in position to attempt a game-winning field goal from the Jackets' 15; however, time expired before they could get a play off which resulted in the 14–14 tie. The tie brought Alabama's all-time record against Georgia Tech to 11–10–3.|$|E

25|$|The {{following}} {{game was}} against the team from France. The USA team started out slowly, hitting only one of their first six shots at the basket. France pulled out to a 14–5 early lead, hitting two-thirds of their shot attempts in the first quarter, and extended the lead to a 13-point margin during the first half. The USA team came back, but was <b>still</b> <b>down</b> 30–25 at halftime. The USA team cut into {{the lead in the}} third quarter, but with one quarter to go, France led 49–47. Kaleena Mosqueda-Lewis, who would score nine of her thirteen points in the final quarter, helped the USA take the lead, and the USA team pulled out to an eleven-point lead with just over six minutes to play. However, France hit consecutive three-pointers as part of a 9–0 run to bring the margin down to two points. With just over a minute to play, the score was even at 64 points apiece. Bria Hartley passed to Breanna Stewart, who was fouled going for the basket. She sank both free throws. After a turnover by France, Kaleena Mosqueda-Lewis scored with 23 seconds to go to give the USA a four-point lead. France did not score again, and the USA won the game 70–64.|$|E
25|$|Brady {{started the}} 2014 {{season with a}} 33–20 loss to the Miami Dolphins. It was Brady's first opening day loss since the 2003 season. Brady {{recorded}} 241 {{yards and a touchdown}} in the loss. New England rebounded against the Minnesota Vikings, but Brady struggled, throwing for 149 yards and a touchdown in a 30–7 win. Against the Oakland Raiders Brady was pressured all day, but threw for 234 yards and a touchdown in 16–9 win. After a humiliating 41–14 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs, Brady led New England to back-to-back wins against the Cincinnati Bengals and the Buffalo Bills. Brady then defeated the New York Jets with a 261-yard performance that included three touchdowns. The following week, a 51–23 embarrassment of the Chicago Bears saw Brady throw for 354 yards and a season-high five touchdowns. After passing for 333 yards, and 257 yards in his next two games against the Denver Broncos and Indianapolis Colts respectively, Brady defeated the Detroit Lions 34–9 with 349 passing yards and two touchdowns against only one interception. The Patriots winning streak was put to the test against the Green Bay Packers in Week 13. Down 13–0 early, Brady threw for 245 yards and two touchdowns. <b>Still</b> <b>down</b> 26–21, Brady was unable to give the Patriots their eighth consecutive victory. After trailing 14–3 at the San Diego Chargers, Brady rallied his team with 317 passing yards, two touchdowns, and one interception, to a 23–14 comeback win. Brady clinched his NFL record 12th AFC East division title with 287 passing yards, two touchdowns, and an interception. Brady struggled in his final two games, throwing for only 182 yards, a touchdown, and an interception in 17–16 victory against the Jets, and 80 yards in one half of the final regular season game against the Buffalo Bills, a 17–9 loss, though Julian Edelman, Rob Gronkowski, and three starting offensive linemen did not play either the entirety or the majority of the final game, and Brady only played in the first half.|$|E
25|$|The Badgers {{took the}} opening drive {{of the second}} half and moved into the Gamecocks red zone but would be forced to settle for a 35–yard field goal by K Jack Russell. South Carolina got the ball for their first second half drive. On their first play, Connor Shaw {{scrambled}} for 8 yards but fumbled after he was hit by Badgers LB Derek Landisch. The ball was recovered by fellow Badgers LB Ethan Armstrong. Wisconsin started at the South Carolina 31–yard line but failed to move the ball into the red zone and were forced to try a field goal. The kick from Jack Russell was wide right from 42 yards. South Carolina then drove 75 yards scoring on a 22–yard touchdown pass to Bruce Ellington from Connor Shaw. On the first play of the Badgers next drive, QB Joel Stave would scamble for 5 yards but was hit hard by a South Carolina defender. A few plays later after handing the ball off, Stave would be forced to leave the game with a shoulder injury. Taking over at quarterback for the Badgers was sixth year senior Curt Phillips. The third quarter would come to a close with the Badgers moving into Gamecock territory. On fourth and one from the South Carolina 26–yard line, Wisconsin decided to go for the first down instead to try a 40 plus yard field goal. The Gamecocks defense stuffed the Badgers and they turned the ball over on down. Six plays later, South Carolina extended their lead with a 3–yard touchdown pass to Jerell Adams from Connor Shaw. However, the Badgers would strike quickly on the ensuring kickoff. Badgers kick returner, Kenzel Doe, returned the kickoff 91 yards for a touchdown. The return was highlighted with a stiff arm that sprung Doe for the score. The Badgers were within three with just under 11 minutes left in the game. Once again, South Carolina would answer this time a 9 play 88 yard drive capped by a 1–yard touchdown run by Connor Shaw on a QB sneak. The Badgers then took over and got to the Gamecocks 47–yard line before Curt Phillips was intercepted. With less than five minutes left, the Gamecocks took over. Wisconsin LB Conor O'Neill then forced a fumble that was recovered by CB Darius Hillary. The Badgers then moved the ball to the Gamecocks 16–yard line but again backup QB Curt Phillips was intercepted. The Badgers defense would force the Gamecocks to punt and the Badgers took over with 2:10 left in the game <b>still</b> <b>down</b> by 10 points. Wisconsin got down to South Carolina's 17–yard line but the Badgers tried a trick play with a screen to WR Jared Abbrederis who then attempted to pitch the ball to RB Melvin Gordon but he mishandled the ball and fumbled turning the ball over to South Carolina. Two kneel downs later and the game was over with a South Carolina victory over Wisconsin, 34–24.|$|E

A successful two-point conversion pass from McElroy to Colin Peek gave Alabama a 24–17 lead. On the ensuing kickoff, Davon Morgan fumbled and Chris Rogers recovered for the Tide at the Tech 21. The following Alabama drive stalled at the 3, but Tiffin's fourth field goal made the score 27–17. Poor kickoff coverage and penalties set up a 32-yard Williams that run cut the lead to 27–24 late in the fourth quarter. Alabama quickly struck back as Ingram rushed for 39 yards, McElroy completed a 19-yard pass to Peek, and then threw to Ingram for an 18-yard touchdown and a 34–24 lead. The Hokies never threatened to score again and Alabama won its opener, 34–24. Ingram led the Tide with 150 yards rushing on 26 carries and a pair of touchdowns, and he was named the SEC Offensive Player of the Week. The victory improved Alabama's all-time record against the Hokies to 11–1.|$|E
500|$|North Korean {{activity}} continued {{throughout the}} night, and although {{this resulted in}} further casualties in A and B Companies, {{they were unable to}} penetrate the forward Australian positions. Among the dead was Wathen, whose platoon was attacked by the North Koreans after moving to cover the exposed B Company position, resulting in several other Australians also being wounded. Meanwhile, during the evening the 3 RAR Assault Pioneer Platoon had also discovered and destroyed a small North Korean arms dump on the eastern bank of the river. The Australians subsequently attempted to evacuate their casualties from the forward companies, and although these had been relatively light the task proved perilous. With the bridge <b>still</b> <b>down,</b> the wounded had to be carried by hand on stretchers to the broken span and then lowered [...] to a boat borrowed from the American engineers. The boat was then hauled by ropes back across to the eastern bank of the river where the casualties were load into jeep ambulances. Despite a number of difficulties the majority of the casualties were successfully evacuated by these means, even as the bridge occasionally came under small arms fire. However, at around 01:00, while evacuating the final casualty, the boat came under fire again from North Korean snipers and sank after being swept against a concrete piling. The wounded soldier fell into the fast flowing Taeryong River and the 3 RAR battalion drum-major, Sergeant Thomas Murray, subsequently dived into the freezing waters and rescued him. Murray was later awarded the George Medal for his actions.|$|E
