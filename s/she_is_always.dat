5|$|During {{the earlier}} seasons of the show, Maggie's {{equivalent}} of a hallmark was to trip over her clothing and fall on her face while trying to walk, causing a loud thud on the floor, but this was toned down in the later seasons.

5|$|Chamunda is {{included}} in the Saptamatrika (seven Matrikas or mothers) lists in the Hindu texts like Mahabharata (Chapter 'Vana-parva'), Devi Purana and Vishnudharmottara Purana. She is often depicted in the Saptamatrika group in sculptures, examples of which are Ellora and Elephanta caves. Though <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>always</b> portrayed last (rightmost) in the group, she is sometimes referred to {{as the leader of the}} group. While other Matrikas are considered as Shaktis (powers) of male divinities and resemble them in their appearance, Chamunda is the only Matrika who is a Shakti of the great Goddess Devi rather than a male god. She is also the only Matrika who enjoys independent worship of her own; all other Matrikas are always worshipped together.|$|E
60|$|Yet in {{her heart}} itself <b>was</b> <b>always</b> this same strain, tense, anxious. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> not safe, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> exposed, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> attacked. There <b>was</b> a yearning in her for a fulness of peace and blessedness. What a heavy yearning it was--so heavy.|$|R

5|$|Prior to her infestation, Kerrigan is {{described}} as being a graceful and deadly woman, exceedingly agile and athletic, possessing jade-green eyes and brilliant red hair usually worn as a ponytail. The novel Queen of Blades describes her facial features as being too strong to be classified as beautiful, but instead as striking and completely fitting for her personality. Kerrigan is rarely seen out of her armor, a form-fitting hostile environment suit specifically designed for Ghost operatives and equipped with a personal cloaking device, but when off-duty, she {{is described}} as wearing a soft work shirt, worn cotton pants with a dusty leather jacket, and high leather boots. Even then, it is uncommon for Kerrigan to be unarmed: <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>always</b> equipped {{with at least a}} combat knife.|$|E

Eventually, Gopal's father dies of a heart attack after seeing Chitra's drunken behaviour on Gopal's birthday. Gopal tries to control Chitra, but <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>always</b> irritated by his acts. At one point, she tries to leave him. Gopal begs her to change her decision, but Chitra still leaves.

25|$|Ethel lives above Doctor Legg's (Leonard Fenton) {{surgery and}} works as the cleaner in the pub. She is {{somewhat}} of a troublemaker and often spreads the most insane rumours about and gets her words mixed up with hilarious consequences. She is famous for her questionable ability to read-palms and tea-leaves, once even earning a living from it. After Lou's death in 1988 Ethel and Dot become an inseparable double-act and although the two argue constantly, they actually depend on each other a great deal. Despite the fact that Ethel appears totally barmy, she can be quite astute when she wants and <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>always</b> the first {{to point out the}} malicious ways of Dot's villainous son, Nick Cotton (John Altman). Ethel is never afraid to stand up to Nick, even kneeing him in the groin once when he attempts to mug her. She also correctly figures out that Nick is trying to poison Dot to get her money, and she refuses to back down, despite Dot falling out with her because of her accusations. Following several falls and a broken hip, Ethel is persuaded to move out of her residence above the surgery and into sheltered housing in 1988. Although she is strongly opposed to this initially, she eventually comes to enjoy her new home, though she would continue to show up in Albert Square regularly.|$|E
500|$|Barbauld's most {{significant}} political texts are: An Address to the Opposers of the Repeal of the Corporation and Test Acts (1790), Epistle to William Wilberforce on the Rejection of the Bill for Abolishing the Slave Trade (1791), Sins of Government, Sins of the Nation (1793), and Eighteen Hundred and Eleven (1812). As Harriet Guest explains, [...] "the theme Barbauld's essays of the 1790s repeatedly return {{to is that}} of the constitution of the public as a religious, civic, and national body, and <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>always</b> concerned to emphasize the continuity between the rights of private individuals and those of the public defined in capaciously inclusive terms." ...|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert {{began his}} review of Election by noting, [...] "I {{remember}} students like Tracy Flick, the know-it-all who always has {{her hand in the}} air, while the teacher desperately looks for someone else to call on. In fact, I was a student like Tracy Flick." [...] He goes on to compare Tracy to Elizabeth Dole: [...] "a person who always seems to be presenting you with a logical puzzle for which she is the answer... <b>She</b> <b>is</b> <b>always</b> perfectly dressed and groomed, and is usually able to conceal her hot temper behind a facade of maddening cheerfulness. But she is ruthless. She reminds me of a saying attributed to David Merrick: 'It is not enough for me to win. My enemies must lose.'" ...|$|E

500|$|Despite {{constant}} thefts, {{particularly of}} livestock, Seacole's establishment prospered. Chapter XIV of Wonderful Adventures describes the meals and supplies provided to officers. They were closed at 8 pm daily and on Sundays. Seacole {{did some of}} the cooking herself: [...] "Whenever I had a few leisure moments, I used to wash my hands, roll up my sleeves, and roll out pastry." [...] When called to [...] "dispense medications," [...] she did so. Soyer was a frequent visitor, and praised Seacole's offerings, noting that she offered him champagne on his first visit. The Special Correspondent of The Times newspaper wrote approvingly of her work: [...] "...Mrs. Seacole...doctors and cures all manner of men with extraordinary success. <b>She</b> <b>is</b> <b>always</b> in attendance near the battle-field to aid the wounded, and has earned many a poor fellow’s blessings." ...|$|E
500|$|Allison Mack characterizes Chloe {{as being}} a [...] "misfit" [...] during the first season; more of [...] "a really smart girl with attitude". She goes on to {{describe}} Chloe as intelligent and independent. Another of Chloe's defining characteristics is her need to [...] "expose falsehoods" [...] and find the truth in every situation. The character is curious, and wants {{to be honest with}} people. <b>She</b> <b>is</b> <b>always</b> {{trying to make sense of}} the situation. Next to her curiosity, her impulsiveness is a key characteristic that eventually leaves her under the control of Lionel Luthor, when she offers to uncover information on Clark for Lionel. The reason for this betrayal is based on Chloe's love for Clark. As Allison Mack explains, Chloe is so blinded by her love for Clark that she neglects to see all of the mistakes that he makes. It is this unrequited love for Clark that [...] "drives [...] to be as ambitious and as focused as she is".|$|E
500|$|Lopez {{began working}} on a [...] "collection of songs" [...] in 2011, unaware {{of what she was}} [...] "going to do with them". At the time, she was {{deciding}} whether she wanted to release a greatest hits album or a new studio album. Lopez stated that {{when it comes time to}} make an album, she doesn't sit down and write for the entire thing. She revealed that <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>always</b> working on new music and that her albums [...] "happen organically" [...] when she has recorded enough material. Lopez explained: [...] "I don't ever stop. I keep going with it. These records, like 'Follow the Leader,' [...] they just kind of came about. It wasn't something like, 'Oh, I'm going to sit down and make a record right now.'" [...] Among the songs she recorded, two were chosen to be included on Dance Again... The Hits: [...] "Dance Again" [...] and [...] "Goin' In".|$|E

500|$|Yuiko Kurugaya is Riki's classmate {{who has a}} {{self-sufficient}} personality, and {{is sometimes}} seen carrying a replica of a katana called Muramasa. She {{is seen as an}} older sister to everyone despite being the same age of almost the entire cast, and is fond of things or people she considers to be cute.Translated quote: [...] "I like cute things." [...] Mio Nishizono is a calm girl who is very diligent. Due to having weak health, <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>always</b> seen with a parasol when outside.

500|$|The first verse of [...] "I Could Fall in Love" [...] implores {{the object}} of the singer's desire to walk away, because her {{emotions}} are too overpowering and she feels love of unprecedented intensity. She fears that by allowing him to stay attached, she may [...] "lose control". Selena believes that her infatuation can lead to romantic love. She then sings [...] "I could fall in love (in love) with you" [...] before wondering how she would feel if she were to touch him for the first time. The fear of being rejected and unloved leads her to keep her feelings to herself, and she begins to believe that her love is [...] "not right". She continues, [...] "and I guess I should try/ to do what I should do/ but I could fall in love/ fall in love with you". During the midpoint break, Selena sings in Spanish that <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>always</b> dreaming about him, imagining that he loves her. She sings the chorus twice before the song comes to an end without her ever having come to terms with her loved one.|$|E
500|$|Apart {{from serving}} {{officers}} at the British Hotel, Seacole also provided catering for spectators at the battles, and spent time on Cathcart's Hill, some [...] north of the British Hotel, as an observer. On one occasion, attending wounded troops under fire, she dislocated her right thumb, an injury which never healed entirely. In a dispatch written on 14 September 1855, William Howard Russell, special correspondent of The Times, wrote {{that she was a}} [...] "warm and successful physician, who doctors and cures all manner of men with extraordinary success. <b>She</b> <b>is</b> <b>always</b> in attendance near the battlefield to aid the wounded and has earned many a poor fellow's blessing." [...] Russell also wrote that she [...] "redeemed the name of sutler", and another that she was [...] "both a Miss Nightingale and a [...] ". Seacole made a point of wearing brightly coloured, and highly conspicuous, clothing—often bright blue, or yellow, with ribbons in contrasting colours. While Lady Alicia Blackwood later recalled that Seacole had [...] "...personally spared no pains and no exertion to visit the field of woe, and minister with her own hands such things as could comfort or alleviate the suffering of those around her; freely giving to such as could not pay...".|$|E
