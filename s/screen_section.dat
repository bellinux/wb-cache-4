50|$|Also notable {{were several}} {{commercial}} software products {{developed in the}} mid to late 1970s in conjunction with the commercial computers. These products were popular with business customers because of their screen design feature and other ease-of-use features. The first product was IDEA (Interactive Data Entry/Access), which consisted of a screen design tool (IFMT), TP Controller (IMON), and a program development language (IFPL). The second was the CS40 line of products, which used COBOL and their own ISAM data manager. The COBOL variant used included an added <b>screen</b> <b>section.</b> Both of these products were a major departure from the transaction monitors of the day which did not have a screen design tool and used subroutine calls from COBOL to handle the screen. IDEA was identified by some market watchers as a precursor to fourth-generation programming languages.|$|E

40|$|Several factors {{determine}} {{the success of}} Alpha-Beta gravel packing procedures in deviated wells. Among others gravel concentration, rheology of carrier fluid and injection rates could be mentioned. Choosing incorrect values for these parameters may end up in an unsuccessful gravel pack that results in part of the sand <b>screen</b> <b>section,</b> or the complete section being exposed directly to sand production. This sand production could lead to various challenges both downhole and top side. In this thesis, three well known gravel-packing models are reviewed. Using the models, several parametric sensitivity {{studies were carried out}} to learn the bed height deposition and settling velocity changes. The analysis is based on single and combined effects of parameters. The fluid systems selected are both Newtonian and near Newtonian fluid behaviors...|$|E

40|$|Gravel packing is a {{well-known}} method in sand control where stabilizing the formation with gravel prevents the production of formation sand. Longer and more complex completion operations are making the business of completing wells continually changing with new challenges, new technology and new methods. The purpose of this thesis is to discuss the gravel placement in nearly vertical openhole systems with blank pipe sections between the screens. In vertical openhole completions with long blank pipe sections slurry and gravel settling regimes will occur differently compared to a conventional gravel pack operation without blank pipe sections. The {{reason for this is}} when a lower <b>screen</b> <b>section</b> is packed with gravel and the overlying section is with blank pipe, the carrier fluid can no longer flow through the lower screen. The gravel in the blank pipe sections is mainly settling due to gravitational forces and therefore displaces the carrier fluid, which flows upwards to the upper <b>screen</b> <b>section.</b> By simulating gravel pack operations with blank pipe sections in Halliburton’s laboratory scale model in Tananger it has recently been shown (with continuous pumping) that with a higher inclination on the well (less vertical), a better packing is achieved in the blank pipe section; a higher gravel pack efficiency is achieved. By analyzing and calculating theoretically how the gravel settles with regards to physical laws in fluid dynamics will give a better view on how to optimize the packing of gravel in the blank pipe sections in nearly vertical wells. How to optimize the packing in these blank pipe sections without the use of extensive expensive rig-time was one of several challenges that had {{to be taken into account}} during the work with this thesis. The combination of solids and fluid in one flow resulted in complex calculations, and certain parameters were therefore predetermined and assumptions like fluid loss and particle interaction were set to zero to simplify the calculations. The parameters in this thesis take the basis in ta field located in the Norwegian sector...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. The deep ice-sheet coring (DISC) drill {{consists}} of four major mechanical drilling subsystems and four subsystems supporting on-surface activities. The mechanical drilling subsystems are a drill sonde, a drill cable, a tower and a winch. The drill sonde is the down-hole portion of the drill system and {{consists of}} six distinct sections: (1) the cutter head, (2) the core barrel, (3) the <b>screen</b> <b>section,</b> (4) the motor/pump section, (5) the instrument section and (6) the upper sonde, which includes anti-torques and drill cable terminations. The drill cable not only provides the means of supporting the drill sonde in the borehole, but also provides conduits for electrical power and data transmission. The tower tilts to allow the drill sonde to be serviced in the horizontal position without removing it from the tower. The winch provides a means of quickly raising the sonde from the borehole and providing the fine control necessary for coring operations...|$|E
40|$|Objective: The study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} correlates of cognition among patients with schizophrenia. Methods: Over a three month period, in-patients diagnosed with schizophrenia (n = 50) and mood disorders (n = 50) were recruited into the study. Both groups of patients were assessed using the Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (SCAN), the Annett Hand Preference Questionnaire (AHPQ) and the Global Assessment of Function Scale (GAF). Patients with schizophrenia were further assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndromes Scale, PANSS and the Clinical Global impression (CGI). The cognitive <b>screen</b> <b>section</b> of SCAN (comprising Verbal Trails Test and Mini Mental State examination, MMSE) and the cognitive factor of PANSS {{were used to}} assess cognitive function. Results: No differences were found in the cognitive profile of patients with schizophrenia and mood disorder. Among patients with schizophrenia, poor verbal performance was associated with the negative or mixed syndrome (p = 0. 004), left or mixed handedness (p = 0. 013), greater illness severity (p = 0. 030) and lower GAF scores (p = 0. 039). Poor performance on MMSE correlated with higher total PANSS score (p = 0. 022) and was also associated with the negative or mixed syndrome (p = 0. 003) and lack of clinical improvement (p = 0. 035). Conclusion: Patients with the negative or mixed schizophrenia syndrome may suffer more cognitive deficit. Poor verbal performance among patients with schizophrenia may be associated with left or mixed handedness, more severe illness and poor functioning...|$|E

40|$|The {{remediation}} of aged source zone {{affected by}} residual chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons (CAHs) {{represents one of}} the main challenges in contaminated aquifers. Groundwater Circulation Wells (GCWs) could be considered a strategy for the progressive source zone remediation; this in situ remediation technology is designed to create an in situ vertical groundwater circulation cells by drawing groundwater from an aquifer through one screened section of a multi-screened well and discharging it through another screened section. The pressure gradient between the two hydraulically separated screen sections in the well induces a circulation flow in the aquifer forcing water through less permeable layer where usually CAHs residual source are located. The groundwater moves through the treatment zone both horizontally and vertically and as a consequence the low permeable layer is constantly penetrated by the vertical flow of the GCWs. We tested the possibility to use GCW to enhance in-situ bioremediation (ISB) in an operative industrial site heavily contaminated by different chlorinated solvents (at concentration up to 100 mg/L) in a complex hydrogeological saturated zone. A 30 mts deep GCW, with three screen sections, was designed and installed at the site for a pilot testing. Groundwater is pumped towards two screen sections of the GCW and is reinjected into the aquifer by another <b>screen</b> <b>section</b> after passing through an external unit treatment. External treatment unit is composed of a sand filter tank and two reactors: one reactor was filled with a biodegradable polymer (polyhydroxy-butyrrate, PHB) and the other one with a mixture of zero-valent iron (ZVI) and PHB. Results from the first eight months of operation clearly demonstrated how groundwater recirculation through the PHB reactor allowed delivering continuously electron donors in the contaminated aquifer enhancing the mobilization of CAHs and stimulating Natural Attenuation biological processes. © 2016, AIDIC Servizi S. r. l...|$|E
40|$|Uptake and dose {{distributions}} in peritoneal LS 174 T colon tumor xenografts {{were compared}} for a hu-manized construct of the CC 49 (HuCC 49) high-affinity anti-TAG- 72 monoclonal antibody and a construct with the CH 2 region deleted (HuCC 49 DCH 2), both labeled with 177 Lu using a PA-DOTA bifunctional chelating agent and injected in the peritoneum. Tumors were resected and serially sectioned at 1 h, 4 h, 24 h, and 48 h postinjection. Between 5 and 24 (average 16) sections were retained per tumor for au-toradiography. The typical section interval was 340 mm and thickness was 16 mm. Tumor sections were air dried {{and placed on}} film and/or phosphor <b>screen.</b> <b>Section</b> images were digitized at 100 mm resolu-tion electronically (phosphor screen) or by laser densitometer (film). Section images were used to gen-erate tumor surface descriptions and activity distributions by reconstructing the activity densities in three dimensions. Three-dimensional dose-rate calculations, performed using a point kernel for 177 Lu, were used to prepare radial histograms describing the variation in dose rate {{as a function of}} distance from the tumor center to surface. At early times postinjection, the 177 Lu-HuCC 49 DCH 2 antibody displayed higher dose rates near the tumor surface compared to the 177 Lu-HuCC 49 antibody. At 24 h postinjection, dose rate distributions appeared similar for both antibodies and more uniform than at earlier times. The 177 Lu-HuCC 49 DCH 2 antibody indicated improved uniformity at 48 h postinjection. Cell survival calculations based on the three-dimensional dose rate distributions favored 177 Lu-HuCC 49 DCH 2 for equal injection activities. However the most significant effect was the greater injected dose tolerated for the 177 Lu-HuCC 49 DCH 2 antibody based on equivalent estimated bone marrow dose...|$|E
40|$|Groundwater wells {{are often}} clogged by incrustation, {{which has a}} {{negative}} impact on well specific capacity. Chemical and biological incrustation formed by precipitation of minerals in the well reduces the open area of slots in the <b>screen</b> <b>section,</b> which leads to an efficiency reduction in wells. Incrustation conditions are observed in the geothermal energy wells located at Oslo airport, Gardermoen. Well yield capacity has declined since they were installed in 1997. There are eighteen energy wells; 9 wells on the cold side and 9 wells on the warm side. The ground source of heat pump, which is an open system, extracts heat from the ground by pumping ground water from production well to the heat pump. After the circulation in the system, the ground water used is injected into the injection well and flows through the aquifer again. Recently, one well from the cold wells was totally abandoned and it {{has been replaced by a}} new pilot well. A quantitative calculation with PHREEQC of saturation indices for formation- and borehole water has aided in the evaluation of several minerals. These results have been compared with formation mineralogy and crust samples from within the borehole. The results from geochemical modelling indicates that carbonate minerals such as calcite (CaCO 3), aragonite (CaCO 3), dolomite (CaMg(CO 3) 2), dolomite-ord (CaMg(CO 3) 2), and rhodochrosite (MnCO 3), have the potential to precipitate in the wells. However, the crust analyses showed that only calcium carbonates were found. Furthermore, the elevated percentage of inorganic carbon in the crust samples supports evidence of carbonate mineral precipitation. In addition, the reduction of ferrous iron (Fe++) concentration, as the flow of formation water approaches production wells, as well as the relatively high percentage of iron in the crust samples are all indicative of Fe (III) oxide minerals precipitation. An increased content of organic carbon in the crust samples compared with aquifer material indicates microbiological activity in the formation of the crust. The disturbance of chemical equilibrium due to pumping, which leads to pressure reduction allows the release of gases from the formation water, resulting in precipitation of calcium carbonate in the wells...|$|E
40|$|Conjoint {{analysis}} (CA) {{has emerged}} as an important approach to the assessment of health service preferences. This article examines Adaptive Choice-Based Conjoint Analysis (ACBC) and reviews available evidence comparing ACBC with conventional approaches to CA. ACBC surveys more closely approximate the decision-making processes that influence real-world choices. Informants begin ACBC surveys by completing a build-your-own (BYO) task identifying the level of each attribute that they prefer. The ACBC software composes a series of attribute combinations clustering around each participant's BYO choices. During the <b>Screener</b> <b>section,</b> informants decide whether each of these concepts is a possibility or not. Probe questions determine whether attribute levels consistently included in or excluded from each informant's <b>Screener</b> <b>section</b> choices reflect 'Unacceptable' or 'Must Have' simplifying heuristics. Finally, concepts identified as possibilities during the <b>Screener</b> <b>section</b> are carried forward to a Choice Tournament. The winning concept in each Choice Tournament set advances to the next choice set until a winner is determined. A review of randomized trials and cross-over studies suggests that, although ACBC surveys require more time than conventional approaches to CA, informants find ACBC surveys more engaging. In most studies, ACBC surveys yield lower standard errors, improved prediction of hold-out task choices, and better estimates of real-world product decisions than conventional choice-based CA surveys.
