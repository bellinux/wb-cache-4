He was time-{{displaced}} in the 30th century where he saw various incarnations of The Legion of Super Heroes before being displaced again in present-day Smallville where he encountered a still young and inexperienced modern day clone Superboy(Kon-El). Thinking he was <b>somehow</b> <b>in</b> his own future he was confused to see another Superboy and fought him until coming to realize that something bigger was going on. After talking {{it out with the}} modern Superboy the Pocket Universe Superboy vanished back to his proper time and reality. This Superboy was later retconned to have been the Earth-One Superboy.|$|E

25|$|An {{important}} question {{that remains to}} be answered is what language or languages were spoken by the people and rulers of the empire of Teotihuacan. During {{the first part of the}} Classic period Teotihuacan achieved dominance over central Mexico and far into the Maya area. Possible candidates for the language of Teotihuacan have been Nahuatl, Totonac or Mixe–Zoque. Terrence Kaufman has argued that Nahuatl is an unlikely candidate because Proto-Nahuan did not enter Mesoamerica until around the time of the fall of Teotihuacan (c. 600 AD), and that Totonac or Mixe–Zoque are likely candidates because many Mesoamerican languages have borrowed from these two languages during the Classic period. Others find Mixe–Zoque an unlikely candidate because no current Mixe–Zoque settlements are found in central Mexico. Around 500–600 CE a new language family entered Mesoamerica when speakers of Proto-Nahuan, a southern Uto-Aztecan language, moved south into central Mexico. Their arrival, which coincides with the decline of Teotihuacan and a period of general turmoil and mass migration in Mesoamerica, has led scientists to speculate that they might have been involved <b>somehow</b> <b>in</b> the fall of the Teotihuacan empire.|$|E
500|$|... "August" [...] was co-written by co-showrunners J. H. Wyman and Jeff Pinkner, {{while being}} {{directed}} by NCIS veteran Dennis Smith. They began shooting the episode {{during the second}} half of September 2009, right after wrapping production on [...] "Of Human Action". Supervising producer Josh Singer later noted how [...] "August" [...] helped them write the rest of the season, [...] "There was one episode, 'August', which was all about the Observers, that I feel was mythology without being mythology. And <b>somehow,</b> <b>in</b> working that episode, we sort of found a new creative vein. And it's not that that episode was necessarily so related to everything else we did. But I feel like it sort of opened us up in terms of how we were feeling about the year".|$|E
500|$|Although forty-six {{drivers were}} {{entered in the}} qualifier; {{according}} to NASCAR's qualifying procedure, only forty-three could race. Each driver ran two laps, with the starting order determined by the competitor's fastest times. Martin Truex, Jr. clinched his third pole position of the season, {{with a time of}} 26.643. He was joined on the grid's front row by Kurt Busch. Johnson qualified third, Kahne took fourth, and Hamlin started fifth. Biffle, Kyle Busch, Stewart, Casey Mears and Martin completed the top ten positions. The three drivers that failed to qualify were Regan Smith, Kevin Conway and Brandon Ash. After the qualifier Truex said, [...] "(Today) we were pretty good in practice. This is a weird track where you go out in practice, then expect to pick up a half-second <b>somehow</b> (<b>in</b> qualifying). We did. It's strange, but it felt good." ...|$|E

500|$|It is {{not known}} how Morrell {{supported}} himself during his months in London; {{it is possible that}} Abby sent him funds from America. <b>Somehow,</b> <b>in</b> the autumn of 1837 {{he made his way to}} Havana in Cuba, after which his movements are unclear. [...] It appears that he eventually obtained command of a vessel, possibly the Christine, and that he sailed in September 1838, probably planning a return to the Pacific. He got no further than Mozambique on the East African coast; his ship was wrecked, and Morrell was stranded ashore. He is reported to have died, either of fever or during an insurrection, in late 1838 or early 1839. This story is complicated by an alternative account indicating that Christine was wrecked a year later, [...] early in 1840, although whether Morrell was alive and in command by that date is unrecorded. Christine was known as a slave ship, which raises the possibility that in his final years Morrell was engaged with the slave trade. [...] Fairhead suggests an alternative hypothesis: that Morrell staged his death in Mozambique, to evade Margaret Oakleys insurers. In this scenario he may have escaped to South America and lived out his days there. A letter dated August 11, 1843, to the editor of The New York Commercial Advertiser and signed [...] "Morrell" [...] could, Fairhead maintains, only have been written by someone with intimate knowledge of the Oakley voyage. Fairhead offers no explanation why Morrell, if alive, should break his silence other than: [...] "Perhaps, like many criminals, he could not resist flaunting himself".|$|E
2500|$|The {{belief in}} a [...] "twin" [...] world, Terra, is {{widespread}} on Antiterra {{as a sort of}} fringe religion or mass hallucination. (The name [...] "Antiterra" [...] may be a back-formation from this; the planet is [...] "really" [...] called [...] "Demonia".) One of Van's early specialties as a psychologist is researching and working with people who believe that they are <b>somehow</b> <b>in</b> contact with Terra. Terra's alleged history, so far as he states it, appears to be that of our world: that is, the characters in the novel dream, or hallucinate, about the real world.|$|E
2500|$|Following the {{argument}} in the Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen (EPR) paradox paper (but using the example of spin, as in David Bohm's version of the EPR argument), Bell considered an experiment {{in which there are}} [...] "a pair of spin one-half particles formed <b>somehow</b> <b>in</b> the singlet spin state and moving freely in opposite directions." [...] The two particles travel away from each other to two distant locations, at which measurements of spin are performed, along axes that are independently chosen. Each measurement yields a result of either spin-up(+) or spin-down(−); it means, spin in the positive or negative direction of the chosen axis.|$|E

Freedland wrote in The Jewish Chronicle: [...] "Now, as it happens, I have multiple criticisms of IJV ... but even their most trenchant opponents must surely blanch {{at the notion that}} these critics of Israel and of Anglo-Jewish officialdom are <b>somehow</b> <b>in</b> favour of genocide—literally, eager to see the murder and eradication of the Jewish people ... it is an absurdity, one that drains the word 'genocide' of any meaning." ...|$|E
2500|$|Thus {{began his}} {{transition}} into the brash, bombastic manager [...] "Captain" [...] Lou Albano. With a quick wit and a grating personality, Albano delivered memorable promos and earned the scorn of the wrestling audience as {{he attempted to}} dethrone World Wide Wrestling Federation superstar and WWWF World Heavyweight Champion Bruno Sammartino. Albano described the strategy behind his overblown, ranting interview style: [...] "I just remember the point I wanna bring across, and then I just babble before, during, and after. [...] <b>Somehow,</b> <b>in</b> the middle, I said {{the two or three}} sentences that sold tickets. [...] Mostly, I just tried to make people want to see me get my ass kicked, and along the way, hopefully the guy I was managing would catch a beating too!" [...] Growing out his hair and beard, and packing on extra pounds, Albano gave the image of a wild man. He developed a later trademark, applying rubber bands to his beard, after having seen a homeless man do the same. He also often wore a rubber band hanging from a safety pin pushed through his cheek.|$|E
2500|$|The year 1754 was {{the year}} of the {{alienation}} of Tessin. His favor with the queen had deteriorated since 1750-51: first, when he used the Riksdag to force her to agree to the engagement between Crown Prince Gustav and Sophia Magdalena of Denmark, when she herself had wished to engage her son to Margravine Philippine of Brandenburg-Schwedt; and second, when he had betrayed her plans of a coup at the accession of her spouse. The relation between Louisa Ulrika and Tessin was never well seen by Adolf Frederick. Contemporary witnesses state the Tessin was in love with her and [...] "was not always able to conceal his feelings for the crown princess". It is unknown whether there was ever any physical relationship between the queen and Tessin, but Louisa Ulrika herself mention in her memoirs that she had been offended <b>somehow</b> <b>in</b> that aspect. According to Crown Prince Gustav wrote in 1769, that Tessin had made Louisa Ulrika [...] "suggestions far from the reverence one is expected to show toward a sovereign." [...] The Queen felt her pride offended and informed the king, who surprised Tessin in his knees before the queen. This incident led to the King's animosity toward Tessin and the exile of count Tessin and countess Tessin from court. The queen only remarked that she missed countess Tessin.|$|E
