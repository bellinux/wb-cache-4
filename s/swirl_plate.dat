40|$|Abstract:––Based on {{technology}} and economy, a design of explosion-proof heater of bunched pipeline is {{mentioned in this}} paper to solute {{the problems of the}} present heater which is used to heat crude oil in winter. The structure and working principle of this new heater are introduced. And the function of the new heater’s <b>swirl</b> <b>plate</b> is described, before the heater power of the new heater is analyzed. The <b>swirl</b> <b>plate</b> makes crude oil spiral through heating tube leading to delay staying time inside of the heater. The heater has achieved the heat of the oil-water mixture in order to avoiding the phenomenon of oil-water separator and uneven heating. The principle of the heater is feasible. It has advantages of energy conservation and environment protection, and widely applied to crude oil wellhead heating.

40|$|It {{is known}} that a helical port is more {{effective}} than a tangential port to attain the required swirl ratio with minimum sacrifice in the volumetric efficiency. The swirl port is designed for lesser swirl ratio to reduce emissions at higher speeds. But this condition increases the air fuel mixing time and particulate smoke emissions at lower speeds. Optimum swirl ratio is necessary according to the engine operating condition for optimum combustion and emission reduction. Hence the engine needs variable swirl to enhance the combustion in the cylinder according to its operating conditions, for example at partial load or low speed condition it requires stronger swirl, while the air quantity {{is more important than the}} swirl under very high speed or full load and maximum torque conditions. The swirl and charging quantity can easily trade off and can be controlled by the opening of the valve. Hence in this study the steady flow rig experiment is used to evaluate the swirl of a helical intake port design for different operating conditions. The variable <b>swirl</b> <b>plate</b> set up of the W 06 DTIE 2 engine is used to experimentally study the swirl variation for different openings of the valve. The sliding of the <b>swirl</b> <b>plate</b> results in the variation of the area of inlet port entry. Therefore in this study a swirl optimized combustion system varying according to the operating conditions by a variable <b>swirl</b> <b>plate</b> mechanism is studied experimentally and compared with the computational fluid dynamics predictions. In this study the fluent computational fluid dynamics code has been used to evaluate the flow in the port-cylinder system of a DI diesel engine in a steady flow rig. The computational grid is generated directly from 3 -D CAD data and in cylinder flow simulations, with inflow boundary conditions from experimental measurements, are made using the fluent computational fluid dynamics code. The results are in very good agreement with experimental results...|$|E
40|$|A pressure—swirl {{fuel nozzle}} {{generating}} a hollow—cone spray with nominal cone angle of 30 degrees {{is used in}} a swirl—stabilized combustor. The combustor is circular in cross section with <b>swirl</b> <b>plate</b> and fuel nozzle axes aligned and coinciding with the axis of the chamber. Kerosene is injected upward inside the chamber from the fuel nozzle. Separate swirl and dilution air flows are uniformly distributed into the chamber that pass through the honey comb flow straighteners and screens. Calculated swirl number of 1. 5 is generated with the design <b>swirl</b> <b>plate</b> exit air velocity of 30 degrees {{with respect to the}} chamber axis. Effects of swirl and dilution air flow rates on the shape and stability of the flame are investigated. Stable and classical liquid fuel sheet disintegration zone exists close to the nozzle with no visible light followed by a luminous blue region and a mixed blue/yellow region that subsequently turns into yellow for most of the part in the flame. A Phase Doppler Particle Analyzer (PDPA) is used to measure drop size, mean and rms axial velocity for two cases of with and without combustion at six different axial locations from the nozzle. For the no—combustion case all air and fuel flow rates were kept at the same values as the combusting spray condition. Results for mean axial drop velocity profiles indicate widening of the spray due to combustion while the magnitudes of the peak velocities are slightly increased. No measurements inside the hollow—cone spray are possible due to burning of fuel droplets. Drop turbulence decreases due to combination of increase in gas kinematic viscosity and elimination of small drops at high temperatures. Sauter Mean Diameter (SMD) radial profiles at all axial locations increase with combustion due to preferential burning of small drops...|$|E

The extensive coking observed on the <b>swirl</b> <b>plates</b> {{of the fuel}} nozzles of the E- 2 C HAWKEYE aircraft is the initiative of this investigation. A testing rig reproducing the shut down procedure of the engine was designed and a method {{for the evaluation of}} the resistance in coking for different types of <b>swirl</b> <b>plates</b> is presented. The method is based on measurements of weight increase and holes closure, and on microscopic examination. It {{can be applied to the}} evaluation of any suggested modification of <b>swirl</b> <b>plates</b> in the future and provides the NAVY with a reliable easy to use and modify experimental set-up able to produce comparative data. Results for two different types of <b>swirl</b> <b>plates</b> with different surface finish are presented, together with conclusions and comments arising from the experimental results and the design process. Recommendations for future search objectives to the problem are also presented[URL] Junior Grade, Hellenic Nav...|$|R
50|$|Because raceway {{aquaculture}} operations discharge {{large volumes}} of water, the concentration of discharged solids is low. This means {{it is not easy}} to treat and implement practical, cost effective treatments. Technologies for the removal of solids include microscreens, dual-drain tanks, <b>swirl</b> separators, <b>plate</b> separators, baffles, media filters, air flotation, foam fractionation, chemical flocculation, and constructed wetlands. But because of the impracticality and / or high costs of these methods, most of them are not applicable for commercial aquaculture. As a consequence, sedimentation (settling) is still the most widely applied and cost effective technology. Since 1999, regulations in South Korea require that all raceway farms provide waste water treatment facilities covering at least 20% of the farmed area to prevent pollution of the freshwater environment. Open race way ponds were used for removal of heavy metal ions like lead using live Spirulina (Arthospira) sp.|$|R
40|$|Procedure: 1. Pour a {{thin layer}} of M 9 onto an NGM plate {{containing}} non-starved worms. Gently <b>swirl</b> the <b>plate</b> to dislodge the worms. 2. With a glass pipet, collect the M 9 and worms from the plate into microcentrifuge tubes. 3. Centrifuge the tubes at 2000 rpm for 1 minute. A pellet of worms will form. 4. With a glass pipet, place the pellet of worms into the center of a 500 mM NaCl NGM plate. Suck up as little liquid as possible! 5. Use filter paper to remove any excess liquid from the NGM plate. It is important that you make sure all the excess liquid is gone, or the osmolarity of the plate will change. 6. Start a timer immediately after all the liquid is gone. 7. Score movement (# moving/total) as needed. Generally, movement is recorded at 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11 minutes. N 2 worms should dehydrate and become paralyzed by 7 minutes after the start of the assay. Mutants resistant to osmotic stress will swi...|$|R
