5|$|Scyllarides latus was {{originally}} {{classified in the}} genus Scyllarus, along with the four other <b>slipper</b> <b>lobsters</b> known at the time (Scyllarus arctus, Scyllarides aequinoctialis, Thenus orientalis and Arctides guineensis). Separate genera were first introduced by William Elford Leach in 1815, namely Thenus and Ibacus. In 1849, Wilhem de Haan divided the genus Scyllarus into two genera, Scyllarus and Arctus, but made the error of including the type species of Scyllarus in the genus Arctus. This was first recognised by the ichthyologist Theodore Gill in 1898, who synonymised Arctus with Scyllarus, and erected a new genus Scyllarides to hold the species that De Haan had placed in Scyllarus. Scyllarides {{is placed in the}} subfamily Arctidinae, which is differentiated from other subfamilies by the presence of multiarticulated exopods on all three maxillipeds, and a three-segmented palp on the mandible. The only other genus in the subfamily, Arctides, is distinguished by having a more highly sculptured carapace, with an extra spine behind each eye, and a transverse groove on the first segment of the abdomen.|$|E
25|$|The {{fossil record}} of <b>slipper</b> <b>lobsters</b> extends back 100–120 million years, which is {{considerably}} {{less than that of}} slipper lobsters' closest relatives, the spiny lobsters. One significant earlier fossil is Cancrinos claviger, which was described from Upper Jurassic sediments at least , and may represent either an ancestor of modern <b>slipper</b> <b>lobsters,</b> or the sister group to the family Scyllaridae sensu stricto.|$|E
25|$|Although {{they are}} fished for {{wherever}} they are found, <b>slipper</b> <b>lobsters</b> have not {{been the subject of}} such intense fishery as spiny lobsters or true lobsters. The methods used for catching <b>slipper</b> <b>lobsters</b> varies depending on the species' ecology. Those that prefer soft substrates, such as Thenus and Ibacus, are often caught by trawling, while those that prefer crevices, caves and reefs (including Scyllarides, Arctides and Parribacus species) are usually caught by scuba divers.|$|E
50|$|Scyllarides haanii, the Aesop <b>slipper</b> <b>lobster,</b> is {{a marine}} decapod crustean {{in the family}} Scyllaridae. Other common names include the humpbacked <b>slipper</b> <b>lobster</b> and the ridgeback <b>slipper</b> <b>lobster.</b>|$|R
40|$|Commercial {{catch and}} effort data were {{fit to the}} Leslie model to {{estimate}} preexploitation abundance and the catchability coefficient of <b>slipper</b> <b>lobster,</b> Scyllarides squammosus, in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (NWHI). A single vessel fished for 34 consecutive days {{in the vicinity of}} Laysan Island and caught 126, 127 total <b>slipper</b> <b>lobster</b> in 36, 170 trap hauls. Adjusted catch of legal <b>slipper</b> <b>lobster</b> dropped from a high of 3. 70 to 1. 16 lobster per trap haul. Preexploitation abundance at Laysan Island was an estimated 204, 000 legal <b>slipper</b> <b>lobster,</b> which was extrapolated to yield an estimate of 1. 2 X 106 to 3. 8 X 106 lobster for the entire NWHI <b>slipper</b> <b>lobster</b> fishery...|$|R
50|$|Scyllarides aequinoctialis is {{a species}} of <b>slipper</b> <b>lobster</b> that lives in the western Atlantic Ocean from South Carolina to São Paulo State, Brazil, {{including}} the Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean Sea and Bermuda. Its common name is Spanish <b>slipper</b> <b>lobster.</b> It grows up to 30 cm long, with a carapace 12 cm long. S. aequinoctialis is the type species of the genus Scyllarides, and the first species of <b>slipper</b> <b>lobster</b> to be described from the Western Atlantic.|$|R
25|$|<b>Slipper</b> <b>{{lobsters}}</b> are {{a family}} (Scyllaridae) of about 90 species of achelate crustaceans, in the Decapoda Reptantia, {{found in all}} warm oceans and seas. They are not true lobsters, but are {{more closely related to}} spiny lobsters and furry lobsters. <b>Slipper</b> <b>lobsters</b> are instantly recognisable by their enlarged antennae, which project forward from the head as wide plates. All the species are edible, and some, such as the Moreton Bay bug and the Balmain bug (Ibacus peronii) are of commercial importance.|$|E
25|$|The most {{significant}} predators of <b>slipper</b> <b>lobsters</b> are bony fish, with the grey triggerfish being the {{most significant}} predator of Scyllarides latus in the Mediterranean Sea.|$|E
25|$|Many {{crustacean}} larvae {{were not}} immediately recognised as larvae {{when they were}} discovered, and were described as new genera and species. The names of these genera have become generalised to cover specific larval stages across wide groups of crustaceans, such as zoea and nauplius. Other terms described forms which are only found in particular groups, such as the glaucothoe of hermit crabs, or the phyllosoma of <b>slipper</b> <b>lobsters</b> and spiny lobsters.|$|E
50|$|Scyllarus arctus is {{a species}} of <b>slipper</b> <b>lobster</b> which lives in the Mediterranean Sea and eastern Atlantic Ocean.

Specifically its range is from Australia (Queensland, New South Wales, West Australia), Japan, Hawaii, Melanesia, New Caledonia to East Africa. Scyllarides squammosus has been found at depths from 7.5 m to 71 m.|$|R
25|$|<b>Slipper</b> <b>lobsters</b> {{have six}} {{segments}} {{in their heads}} and eight segments in the thorax, which are collectively covered in a thick carapace. The six segments of the abdomen each bear a pair of pleopods, while the thoracic appendages are either walking legs or maxillipeds. The head segments bear various mouthparts and two pairs of antennae. The first antennae, or antennules, are held on a long flexible stalk, and are used for sensing the environment. The second antennae are the slipper lobsters' most conspicuous feature, as they are expanded and flattened into large plates that extend horizontally forward from the animal's head.|$|E

Despite the name [...] "lobster", <b>slipper</b> <b>lobsters</b> such as Scyllarides latus have no claws, and nor {{do they have the}} protective spines of spiny lobsters. Instead, the exoskeleton, and particularly the carapace, are thicker than in clawed lobsters and spiny lobsters, acting as resilient armour. Adults are cryptically coloured, and the carapace is covered in conspicuous, high tubercles.|$|E
500|$|The sharptooth houndshark is {{a highly}} active species, though it can {{sometimes}} be found resting inside rocky crevices. It mainly hunts at night and {{has been known to}} pursue prey almost onto the shore. The pointed cusps of its teeth allow it to grasp slippery prey, while their broad bases allow it to crush hard-shelled prey. This shark feeds on a variety of crustaceans (crabs, <b>slipper</b> <b>lobsters,</b> and spiny lobsters), bony fishes (including morwongs, sea catfishes, drums, and porgies), and cephalopods (in particular Octopus vulgaris). Sharks and rays (including catsharks and guitarfishes) and their egg capsules are a minor food source for larger individuals. Off South Africa, the most important prey species is the crab Plagusia chabrus. Its dietary composition changes with age: young sharks under [...] long subsist almost completely on crabs, while larger sharks consume more bony fishes and cephalopods, as well as a greater variety of prey overall. This shark has been observed deviating from its nocturnal habits to feed on chokka squid (Loligo reynaudii) during their mass spawnings. The broadnose sevengill shark (Notorynchus cepedianus) is known to prey on this species.|$|E

2500|$|The furry {{lobsters}} (e.g. Palinurellus) {{were previously}} separated {{into a family}} of their own, the Synaxidae, but are usually considered members of the Palinuridae. The <b>slipper</b> <b>lobsters</b> (Scyllaridae) are their next-closest relatives, and these two or three families make up the Achelata. Genera of spiny lobsters include Palinurus {{and a number of}} anagrams thereof: Panulirus, Linuparus, etc. (Palinurus was also a helmsman in Virgil's Æneid.)

2500|$|Lobsters {{have long}} bodies with muscular tails, {{and live in}} crevices or burrows on the sea floor. Three of their five pairs of legs have claws, {{including}} the first pair, which are usually {{much larger than the}} others. Highly prized as seafood, lobsters are economically important, and are often one of the most profitable commodities in coastal areas they populate. Commercially important species include two species of Homarus (which looks more like the stereotypical lobster) from the northern Atlantic Ocean, and scampi (which looks more like a shrimp, or a [...] "mini lobster") – the Northern Hemisphere genus Nephrops and the Southern Hemisphere genus Metanephrops.
