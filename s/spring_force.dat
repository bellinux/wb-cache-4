25|$|The {{discharge}} valve is spring-loaded to a preset pressure discharge pressure, {{acting as a}} variable size restriction to hold a constant pressure in chamber D, despite varying fuel flow rates. The valve is opened as the discharge fuel pressure increases above the force from the spring, thereby lowering the fuel pressure to maintain a balanced position with the <b>spring</b> <b>force.</b>|$|E
25|$|Helmets {{also have}} a {{spring-loaded}} exhaust valve which allows excess air to leave the helmet. The <b>spring</b> <b>force</b> is adjustable by the diver to prevent the suit from deflating completely or over-inflating and the diver being floated uncontrollably to the surface. Some helmets have an extra manual exhaust valve known as a spit-cock. This allows the diver to vent excess air when {{he is in a}} position where the main exhaust can not function correctly.|$|E

25|$|A {{suspended}} Slinky's {{centre of}} mass is accelerating downward at 16 feet per second (i.e. g); when released - the lower portion moves up toward the top portion with an equivalent, constant upward acceleration as the tension is relieved. As the spring contracts, every point along its length will accelerate downward with gravity and tension, and experience a decrease in overall downward acceleration related to height along the spring due to the <b>spring</b> <b>force</b> changing with extension- {{at the bottom of}} the spring the upward initial acceleration reduces in accordance with Hooke's law as the spring contracts, but the centre toward which it is moving gets closer- meaning the base will have been displaced sufficiently toward the centre of inertial mass for it to appear to have hung still. Should this phenomenology extend to very light strings with heavy suspended masses (which have approximately linear tension distributions), different mathematics would be needed to explain the phenomenon.|$|E
500|$|Conservative forces include gravity, the {{electromagnetic}} force, and the <b>spring</b> <b>force.</b> Each of these forces has models that {{are dependent on}} a position often given as a radial vector [...] emanating from spherically symmetric potentials. Examples of this follow: ...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} an impulse-based method for cloth {{simulation}} is presented. The simulation of cloth {{is required in}} different application areas like computer animation, virtual reality or computer games. Simulation methods often assume that cloth is an elastic material. With this assumption the simulation can be performed very efficiently using <b>spring</b> <b>forces.</b> The problem is that many textiles cannot be stretched significantly. A realistic simulation of these textiles with <b>spring</b> <b>forces</b> leads to stiff differential equations which cause a deterioration of performance. The impulse-based method described in this paper solves this problem and allows the realistic simulation of inelastic textiles...|$|R

2500|$|Walker {{refined and}} popularized the design, {{eventually}} securing a trademark {{for the name}} [...] "Linerlock" [...] in March 1990. Walker's improvement to the design was to facilitate true one handed opening of the knife. [...] This was accomplished by removing the weak back spring and adding a heat-treated stop pin to align the blade in the open position. [...] Walker added a detent ball to hold the blade in the closed position using the same <b>spring</b> <b>force</b> from the liner.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{previous}} section, the vibration solution was given {{for a single}} harmonic force, but the Fourier transform in general gives multiple harmonic forces. [...] The second mathematical tool, [...] "the principle of superposition", allows the summation of the solutions from multiple forces if the system is linear. In {{the case of the}} spring–mass–damper model, the system is linear if the <b>spring</b> <b>force</b> is proportional to the displacement and the damping is proportional to the velocity over the range of motion of interest. [...] Hence, the solution to the problem with a square wave is summing the predicted vibration from each one of the harmonic forces found in the frequency spectrum of the square wave.|$|E
2500|$|Large {{marine diesel}} engines are started using {{compressed}} air, typically between 20 and 30 bar {{and stored in}} two or more large bottles, acting directly on the pistons via special starting valves to turn the crankshaft prior to beginning fuel injection. [...] This arrangement is more compact and cheaper than an electric starter motor would be at such scales, and able to supply the necessary burst of extremely high power without placing a prohibitive load on the ship's electrical generators and distribution system. [...] Compressed air is commonly also used, at lower pressures, to control the engine and act as the <b>spring</b> <b>force</b> acting on the cylinder exhaust valves, and to operate other auxiliary systems and power tools on board, sometimes including pneumatic PID controllers. [...] One advantage {{of this approach is}} that {{in the event of an}} electrical blackout, ship systems powered by stored compressed air can continue functioning uninterrupted, and generators can be restarted without an electrical supply. [...] Another is that pneumatic tools can be used in commonly wet environments without risk of electric shock.|$|E

50|$|If {{we assume}} an {{idealized}} spring and idealized, kinetic frictional forces, {{proportional to the}} normal force and directed oppositely to the velocity, there {{is another example of}} discontinuous acceleration. Let a mass, connected to an ideal spring, oscillate on a flat, idealized surface with friction. Each time the velocity changes sign (at the maxima of displacement), the magnitude of the force on the mass, which is the vectorial sum of the <b>spring</b> <b>force</b> and the kinetic frictional force, changes by twice the magnitude of the frictional force, since the <b>spring</b> <b>force</b> is continuous and the frictional force reverses its direction when the velocity does. Therefore the acceleration jumps by this amount divided by the mass. That is, the mass experiences a discontinuous acceleration and the jerk contains a Dirac delta, each time the mass passes through the (decreasing) maximal displacements, until it comes to a halt, because the static friction force adapts to the residual <b>spring</b> <b>force,</b> establishing equilibrium with zero net force and zero velocity.|$|E
