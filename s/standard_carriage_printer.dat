50|$|The trailer {{cars were}} built by Schweizerische Industrie Gesellschaft (SIG); the design {{was based on}} the SBB's <b>standard</b> <b>carriage</b> design (Einheitswagen I) due to the short time {{available}} for design and construction. Only one entrance vestibule was provided at {{the front end of the}} cars, doors were of the folding aluminum type, and windows were double-glazed with a passenger-operated venetian blinds between the panes.|$|R

50|$|The Southern Railway Maunsell {{carriage}} was {{the first}} design family of railway carriages built by Southern Railway (SR) in the United Kingdom. Following grouping in 1923, SR had continued to build carriages to the designs of the previous three main companies (the London and South Western Railway, London Brighton and South Coast Railway and South Eastern and Chatham Railway railways), and the Maunsell carriage {{was intended to be}} the <b>standard</b> <b>carriage</b> design for use across the Southern Railway lines, incorporating the best features of each of the former companies' designs.|$|R
5000|$|The 41 ft Watson was {{designed}} for service at stations which required a larger and more powerful boat than the <b>standard</b> <b>carriage</b> launched types, but which could not accommodate the larger Watson types through boathouse or slipway constraints. There was also a beach type with 7 inches more beam and strengthened hulls to withstand the rigours of beach launching. Production ran from 1931 to 1939 and thirteen boats were completed. Between 1948 and 1952 a further five boats were built before attention turned to the much modified [...] type which appeared in 1954.|$|R
50|$|At 22.92 m, {{they were}} the longest {{carriages}} in Australia. They were Commonwealth Railways' first Australian built <b>standard</b> gauge <b>carriages,</b> their predecessors having been manufactured in Europe or Japan.|$|R

50|$|From 1915 more {{carriages}} {{were constructed}} as the electrification project gathered pace and requirements were locked in. Further ACP carriages 49-106, and BCP carriages 19-80 were constructed in 1915-1916. However, these {{did not have}} the <b>standard</b> <b>carriage</b> bogies; instead they were fitted with plate-framed bogies intended for later fitting of traction motors. The cars also varied in having a well in the roof designed for later provision of electrical equipment—motors, pantographs etc. This gives a rough indication of when {{the decision was made to}} proceed with 1500vDC overhead wiring for Melbourne's electrification, as against earlier proposals for third-rail equipment.|$|R
5000|$|Former {{associate}} Budd Corporation built passenger rolling stock. An existing engineering {{factory in}} Linwood, Scotland, {{was acquired by}} Pressed Steel in 1947 where they manufactured railway rolling stock. A peak of production was reached in the late 1950s - early 1960s. The types of rolling stock produced were of standard British Railways design, and included: <b>standard</b> <b>carriages,</b> British Rail Class 117 Diesel Multiple Units, British Rail Class 303 [...] "Blue Train" [...] Electric Multiple Units, and specialist vehicles like restaurant cars. Pressed Steel received few orders {{after the completion of}} the changeover to diesel trains and modern carriages.|$|R
5000|$|There are two gold class {{carriages}} where refreshments {{and finger}} food are {{served on the}} journey. In the <b>standard</b> <b>carriages</b> there are two booths that face each other which create a section, and there are five of these sections in each carriage. The carriages are very rustic and have been restored {{to look like the}} original ones, the wood work is very detailed and everything about the carriage is like being sent back in time. Although the red leather seats can become very hot and the breeze in the train is very minimal, the carriages are quite impressive.|$|R

50|$|The {{design was}} {{conceived}} by Clayton Engineering Limited, who {{worked closely with}} the RNLI to produce this very efficient launch system. The carriage works in conjunction with the range of Talus tractors which are used to deploy the Atlantic 85 inshore lifeboats. There are three versions of this carriage which include a <b>standard</b> <b>carriage</b> and the option of a hydraulic power pack so that the angle of the launch can be changed to suit the conditions. The carriage’s launch platform has a main bed which elevates through 10° to achieve this feature. The third variant of the carriage has the elevation bed mounted on a rail carriage system.|$|R
5000|$|British Railways Mark 1 was {{the family}} {{designation}} for the first standardised designs of railway carriages built by British Railways. Following nationalisation in 1948, BR had continued to build carriages to the designs of the [...] "Big Four" [...] companies (the Great Western, Southern, London Midland and Scottish and London and North Eastern railways), and the Mark 1 {{was intended to be}} the <b>standard</b> <b>carriage</b> design for use across all lines, incorporating the best features of each of the former companies' designs. It was also designed to be much stronger than previous designs, to provide better protection for passengers {{in the event of a}} collision or derailment.|$|R
50|$|The New South Wales <b>Standard</b> {{suburban}} <b>carriage</b> stock were a type {{of electric}} multiple unit operated by the New South Wales Government Railways and its successors between 1926 and 1992. In their later years, they were nicknamed Red Rattlers.|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} to the various military items, there were old versions of <b>standard</b> passenger <b>carriages.</b> A passenger service was operated over the line at various times, nominally for personnel required on the railway, and others from the War Department/Ministry of Defence and their families.|$|R
5000|$|Express trains {{were usually}} formed with class V 200 {{locomotives}} and [...] "standard carriages" [...] (UIC-X-Wagen). At {{the end of}} the 1980s, the picture changed with the arrival of new class 628 DMUs, which eventually displaced many DMUs and locomotive-hauled trains. The latter services continued until December 2004, initially for many years with class 212 and 216 locomotives, which were from 1998 onwards replaced by class 215s, which were in turn replaced in December 2002 with class 218s. The trains initially consisted of <b>standard</b> <b>carriages,</b> and later were formed increasingly from Silberling carriages. With the use of the class 215 and 218 sets, the locomotive-hauled trains were finally converted to push-pull operations, which until then had been used very rarely in the Lahn valley.|$|R
5000|$|The {{first two}} boats served {{for less than}} ten years before being sold off. The second batch {{appeared}} in 1938 and had 3 inches more beam and were fitted with a shelter ahead of the (tiller) steering position. All but one featured Hotchkiss cone propulsion, [...] was fitted with Gill water jets. These boats served for 10 to 12 years at most of their stations before being replaced by <b>standard</b> <b>carriage</b> launched boats, but at two locations, Poole and Newburgh, Surf-class boats continued into the sixties. [...] was withdrawn from service at [...] {{at the end of}} September 1965 after more than twenty four years on station during which it launched on service only eleven times. With its withdrawal, the Newburgh station was closed.|$|R

50|$|A {{pioneering}} {{diesel railcar}} service with a buffet commenced running in July 1934 between Birmingham Snow Hill and Cardiff, running non-stop through Stratford, {{with only two}} stops at Gloucester and Newport. This was the first long distance diesel express service in Britain. It proved so successful that larger railcars with more seating and no buffet had to be introduced to cope with demand, even {{this had to be}} augmented by a normal locomotive hauled service. During the Second World War, the railcar service was the only through service using the line, as all other long distance trains were suspended, at this time it consisted of a three car train consisting of a <b>standard</b> <b>carriage</b> sandwiched between two railcars. Two such trains ran to and from Cardiff daily at this time, and a stop at Stratford was introduced.|$|R
