Which type of learning, which training needs and how want the training to be delivered. Qualification and accreditation were also examined. Questionnaires were given to 70 nurses working in the 5 acute wards of Psychiatric Hospital of Thessaloniki, Greece. The key findings were that most participants wanted to be trained in practical nursing skills in every day practice. The most preferable training thematic was: a) Management of violent and aggressive behavior, b) Risk assessment, c) The suicidal patient, d) Clinical assessment skills, e) The patient with psychosis and f) Communication <b>skills.</b> <b>Accreditation</b> was very important {{and they wanted to}} gain professional qualification. The empirical study highlighted the need for further training, in the frames of Continuing Education.

40|$|Evaluation of {{resident}} operative {{skills is}} challenging in the fast-paced operating room environment and limited {{by lack of}} validated assessment metrics. We describe a smartphone-based app that enables rapid assessment of operative <b>skills.</b> <b>Accreditation</b> Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) otolaryngology taxonomy surgical procedures (n = 593) were uploaded to the software platform. The app was piloted over 1 month. Outcomes included (1) completion of evaluation, (2) time spent completing the evaluation, and (3) quantification of case complexity, operative autonomy, and performance. During the study, 12 of 12 procedures, corresponding to 3 paired evaluated by the resident/attending dyad. Mean ± SD time of evaluation completion was 98. 0 ± 24. 2 and 123. 0 ± 14. 0 seconds for the resident and attending, respectively. Mean time between resident and attending evaluation completion was 27. 9 ± 26. 8 seconds. Resident and attending scores for case complexity, operative autonomy, and performance were strongly correlated (P <. 0001). Rapid evaluation of resident intraoperative performance is feasible using smartphone-based technology...|$|E
40|$|There is {{a gap in}} hybrid vehicle, {{automotive}} electrical / {{electronic and}} embedded systems expertise in the UK. There is a demand for new and different skills than those traditionally associated with the automotive industry. Traditional models of taught undergraduate programmes with relatively narrow disciplines are deficient as the automotive industry’s need is at the boundaries and overlap of traditional disciplines. Recently-qualified engineering graduates need additional specialist training to make a significant input in such areas. Until recently, addressing this gap remained a significant challenge to automotive companies in the UK. The Technical Accreditation Scheme (TAS) launched in 2010 by Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) in partnership with leading UK Universities provides the platform to deliver high impact, relevant, specialised, state-of-the-art solutions to bridge this gap. Success lies in the integration of personal experience and knowledge of Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) with relevant theory ensuring both academic outcomes and real-world needs for usable skills are addressed. This is done with the backdrop {{of a number of}} challenges ranging from the experience and background of cohorts, understanding the level of pre-requisite learning required and balancing the teaching versus training paradigm. Nevertheless, there has been universal positive feedback from participants and sponsors for the TAS modules delivered by WMG at the University of Warwick. The success of the scheme has led to it being opened up to the UK manufacturing and engineering supply chain employers through the Advanced <b>Skills</b> <b>Accreditation</b> Scheme (ASAS). In addition, make a significant long term impact means providing access to non-traditional disciplines earlier through schools and colleges. The WMG Academy for Young Engineers at the University of Warwick will achieve this through a new state-of-the-art school providing young people interested in engineering access to realising their ambitions...|$|E

40|$|Taking {{a view of}} {{curriculum}} design as {{the definition of a}} long-term learner model, we are exploring ways to capture the complex set of goals for tertiary institutions, their faculties, staff and students as well as accreditation requirements. This can serve several important goals: greater flexibility for students; providing academic staff with greater understanding and control of the curriculum; improved quality control at the level of school, faculty, university and more efficiency and effectiveness in accreditation procedures. This requires several ontologies: the graduate competencies and generic <b>skills,</b> the <b>accreditation</b> types and, the teaching methods. It also requires excellent user interfaces (UIs) for staff to maintain these.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{commissioned}} to identify best practice regarding both the provision and the incentivisation {{of the use}} of financial guidance services. It is based on desk research, a literature review, an on-line survey and interviews in seven countries: Australia, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom between January and July 2016. It investigates the following aspects of financial guidance services: the extent and nature of the needs; national planning; the nature of current provision; business models and funding; how services are promoted and use is incentivised; effectiveness and quality of services; regulation, quality assurance and access to redress. It concludes that {{it will be difficult to}} develop a blue print for financial guidance services that would be appropriate to all member states. National provision needs to build on existing organisations to cover all sections of the population and will need a diversity of channels to achieve this. Comprehensive provision also needs a national body to encourage the development of services, promote their use, share best practice within and across countries, encourage a regime of <b>skills</b> training and <b>accreditation</b> and provide oversight...|$|R
40|$|Engineering {{graduates}} are under increasing pressure to demonstrate {{high levels of}} personal <b>skills.</b> The <b>accreditation</b> criteria of professional bodies such as the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) in the US, Engineers Ireland and Engineers Australia, to name but a few, now include {{the development of a}} broad range of personal skills (ABET, 2008; Engineers Australia, 2011; Engineers Ireland, 2007). Evidence of a ‘strong contribution’, a term used by Engineers Ireland, to the development of teamwork, lifelong learning, ethics, communication and self-direction is required in the programme to satisfy the accreditation criteria. Numerous anecdotes of intensive probing for personal skills are relayed by graduates applying for their first job. Many employers devote significant time to assessing the level of personal skills during the recruitment process. Government reports on skills needs often call for greater attention to be paid to the development of critical thinking, creativity and innovation in engineering programmes (Forfás, 2009). Today’s engineering students are experiencing the effects of curricula changing in response to this new outlook of graduate attributes. Achievement of high levels of many personal skills is greatly facilitated by a concurrent growth in intellectual development – autonomy in learning, commitment to ethics, willingness to lead and display initiative are hallmarks of the relativistic thinker. The engineer whose intellectual development has not yet passed the dualistic and multiplistic stages and is still reliant on authority for direction and decision making will not score highly on personal skills, will be unattractive to employers, and has yet to realise his/her potential. Personal skills development will be facilitated by an engineering curriculum that promotes growth in intellectual development. Attention should be paid to the intellectual development of the students throughout the programme to optimise their progression from dualistic to relativistic thinking. Process facilitated student-centred learning can support this growth. Evidence of strong contribution to programme outcomes related to design and personal skills should also come from measurements of levels of intellectual development among students...|$|R
40|$|Pharmacy {{practice}} {{demands that}} pharmacists draw upon competencies and outcomes that {{enable them to}} perform the functions that support the delivery of pharmaceutical care. Many pharmacy schools have established specific outcome objectives for their students based on published pharmaceutical care func-tions, practice <b>skills</b> and revised <b>accreditation</b> standards. To meet these objectives, students must exam-ine clinical situations rationally and logically, then gather, organize, interpret and analyze data pertinent to the patient in question. Students must be competent to make judgements and therapeutic decisions based on available data, learn from past problem solving successes and failures, and integrate knowledge {{to improve the quality of}} life for patients. Schools and colleges of pharmacy must ensure that the faculty responsible for instructing in the basic pharmaceutical sciences emphasize not only the core science that underpins their discipline, but also the relevance of that science to the contemporary practice of the pro-fession. The Structurally-Based Therapeutic Evaluation (SBTE) of drugs was introduced in the medicinal chemistry courses at Creighton University in 1995, and reported to interested audiences in 1997. We believe that this instructional approach to medicinal chemistry is one way to help faculty bring practical rel-evance to the scientific classroom, and encourage students to meet practice-based outcomes with an understanding of the scientific rationale behind the practice decisions they will make as professionals...|$|R
40|$|Context: Recognition of the {{importance}} of informatics to the practice of pathology has surged. Training residents in pathology informatics has been a daunting task for most residency programs in the United States because faculty often lacks experience and training resources. Nevertheless, developing resident competence in informatics is essential for the future of pathology as a specialty. Objective: To develop and deliver a pathology informatics curriculum and instructional framework that guides pathology residency programs in training residents in critical pathology informatics knowledge and <b>skills,</b> and meets <b>Accreditation</b> Council for Graduate Medical Education Informatics Milestones. Design: The College of American Pathologists, Association of Pathology Chairs, and Association for Pathology Informatics formed a partnership and expert work group to identify critical pathology informatics training outcomes and to create a highly adaptable curriculum and instructional approach, supported by a multiyear change management strategy. Results: Pathology Informatics Essentials for Residents (PIER) is a rigorous approach for educating all pathology residents in important pathology informatics knowledge and skills. PIER includes an instructional resource guide and toolkit for incorporating informatics training into residency programs that vary in needs, size, settings, and resources. PIER is available at [URL] (accessed April 6, 2016). Conclusions: PIER is an important contribution to informatics training in pathology residency programs. PIER introduces pathology trainees to broadly useful informatics concepts and tools that are relevant to practice. PIER provides residency program directors with a means to implement a standardized informatics training curriculum, to adapt the approach to local program needs, and to evaluate resident performance and progress over time...|$|R
40|$|Although {{the title}} 2 ̆ 2 Software Engineer 2 ̆ 2 {{is widely used}} {{throughout}} industry, each software practitioner who bears the title is not a software engineer by many standards. In many instances, people believe that 2 ̆ 2 Software Engineer 2 ̆ 2 is a euphemism for a 2 ̆ 2 programmer 2 ̆ 2 who writes well-structured code while others believe {{it is about the}} software used by engineers. These suppositions expose the ignorance about the historical and legal meaning of 2 ̆ 2 Engineer 2 ̆ 2. Furthermore, the general use of the designation 2 ̆ 2 Engineer 2 ̆ 2 by other non-engineering professions has resulted in weakening the title. Licensing and certification are two possible methods to restrict the use of and restore respectability to the title 2 ̆ 2 Software Engineer 2 ̆ 2. Unfortunately, efforts to license and certify software engineers have led to debate, controversy and opposition throughout the software community. This dissertation presumes that the debate over licensing and certification of software engineers is not truly a debate about licensing and certification but a debate about classification. This dissertation presents a system called SPECS (Software Practitioner Expert Classification System). The researcher suggests that a preliminary step prior to initiating the process of certification or licensing should be one of classification. The goal of classification is to associate the proper job title with the professional qualifications and services of the practitioner. The SPECS prototype has an underlying foundation in software engineering. Eight key components are used to build the classification model. These components include initial professional education, <b>accreditation,</b> <b>skills</b> development, certification, licensing, professional societies, continuing education and code of ethics. The significance of this dissertation is through the research and development of the classification model and the decision support system SPECS, an organization is provided a standard method to properly classify software practitioners and thus identify software engineers that qualify for certification or licensing. In addition, the research contributes to the field of expert system validation, knowledge discovery and knowledge acquisition...|$|R
40|$|The {{educational}} needs of high technology businesses evolve rapidly. Environmental and strategic change transforms all sectors of existing companies, so maintaining pace in the skill set of large workforces is a significant challenge. New university graduates are theoretically strong in their discipline but lack expertise with real-world applications. As these graduates mature into experienced professionals their theoretical skills degrade, becoming less applicable because {{the needs of the}} business have changed. The automotive industry is experiencing a rapid growth in the application of diverse new technology. One example is the move to hybrid and electric vehicle (HEV) propulsion systems, driven by government policy and forming a key element of internationally agreed strategy to combat climate change. Whilst classic automotive engineering skills in areas such as engine calibration and micro-electronics are a continued requirement, so too are skills in power electronics, energy storage technology, electric motors and high voltage systems. There is a clear need to upskill existing personnel and empower individuals to effectively manage the complex interactions of diverse components in the products they must now create. WMG at the University of Warwick has, for over a decade, utilised its expertise and advanced research facilities to deliver a range of professional engineering courses targeting these <b>skills.</b> The Technical <b>Accreditation</b> Scheme (TAS), now in its fifth year, has taught the concepts of advanced vehicle engineering at masters’ degree level to a broad spectrum of automotive industry professionals ranging from recent graduates to industry experts. The scheme is delivered through a unique partnership with Jaguar Land Rover (JLR). As TAS has matured the need to expand and deepen the material has arisen. WMG are responding with a comprehensive suite of new HEV modules, for delivery to JLR personnel through TAS beginning in autumn 2015. Building on a previous work, this paper discusses TAS and its basis in literature as a case study for best practice in industry / university partnership educational programmes, and describes WMG HEV provision thus far. The focus then shifts to how TAS has matured, the requirement to broaden and deepen HEV content, and how WMG is reacting directly and strategically to industry needs with newly targeted modules. The paper concludes by highlighting key elements of TAS which align it with established best practice and therefore {{serve as a model for}} application to other companies, other industries or through other educational institutions...|$|R
40|$|Statistics on First Nations {{participation}} in postsecondary studies are abysmally dismaying (Federation of Saskatchewan Indian Nations (FSIN), 2002). Literature suggests that contributing factors include experiences of cognitive dissonance amongst First Nations students (Huffman, Sill, & Brokenleg, 1986), {{a lack of}} respect for First Nations people in the academy (Kirkness & Barnhardt, 1991), and an underrepresentation of First Nations faculty (Hampton, 1995). To effectively address these issues, it is critical that postsecondary institutions understand the factors that contribute to motivation of First Nations people. The purpose of this naturalistic study was to describe the factors that motivated three First Nations adults in Saskatchewan to enroll in graduate studies. I selected three first-year, First Nations students who were enrolled in graduate studies in the province of Saskatchewan using the snowball sampling technique (Bogdan & Biklen, 1998, p. 64). Two hour-long, open-ended interviews were used to allow each participant to describe the factors for enrolling in graduate studies in their own terms (Bogdan & Biklen, 1998; Hampton, 1995; Van Stone, Nelson, & Niemann, 1994) and to create a "discourse between interviewer and respondent" (Mishler, 1986, p. 53). I then incorporated my own voice into the data alongside the participants' voices because I realized that "the researcher's relationship to the inquiry and to the participants shapes the research text" (Clandinin & Connelly, 1998, p. 171). In this study I found that the three participants were motivated primarily by factors of expedience, such as an increase in pay, career advancement, and prestige. However, for each participant, "traditional" First Nations education was seen as authentic education, while education in terms of <b>accreditation,</b> <b>skills</b> and qualifications is only "playing the game. " To put it another way, Indigenous knowledge is authentic to their experience, while economic rationalism is an "artificial context" (Henderson, 2000 b, p. 12) which they cannot avoid, a game they must play {{in order to make a}} living. While the three participants are fulfilling the need to earn a living in the modem world, they have not forgotten or lost their Aboriginal identity; far from it. Alongside their individualistic, goal-oriented motivations, each participant was able to articulate an explicit, parallel, communal purpose to their participation. Each participant walks in two worlds as an embodiment of Little Bear's (2000) "ambidextrous consciousness" (p. 85) ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{critically}} examines {{and questions}} {{the effectiveness of}} a competency-based training policy for frontline management training and development in Australia - the Frontline Management Initiative (FMI). This represents a crucial landmark in Australian Government training policy, in that the training and development of frontline managers was given a national impetus {{and for the first time}} a frontline management program with nationally recognised qualifications and transferable competencies was developed. Since the very nature of management and managerial competence are matters of long-standing debates, the application and effectiveness of the FMI for the 'frontline manager' and the organisation as a whole constitutes a critical aspect of this work. The study explores the interaction between national, institutional, organisational and individual factors and their impact on the implementation of the FMI in organisations. Data to address the research questions were sought through a series of interviews and questionnaires, six case studies, and supplemented by an extensive analysis of the literature and policy documents regarding the FMI. An institutional perspective on the FMI policy development process was obtained through interviews with policy makers and other individuals who have played prominent roles in the FMI. Interviews with senior managers from the case study organisations provided organisational perspectives on the FMI, and interviews and questionnaires completed by FMI participants provided participant perspectives. An important theme of this thesis is that the political and economic context played an important role in shaping the frontline management recommendations. The FMI is a political construction of what is believed to be the characteristics of an effective 'enterprising frontline manager'. The thesis demonstrates that training and development activities are not only influenced by the organisational environment, but also restrained by national institutions developed over time to deliver and accredit training. In particular the development of a national training system linked with training packages (that enable organisations to provide firm-specific training) and national qualifications reflect a conflict between employee needs and enterprise needs. The current focus of national training which reflects 'enterprise needs', requires employees to be made more 'competent' to suit industry requirements, with the result that the provision of transferability of competencies and qualifications to other firms and industries has been compromised. The analysis of FMI practice indicates that the role and performance of frontline managers are significant issues in all the case study organisations. In an environment characterised by change and (senior managerial) expectations as to what frontline managers ought to be doing, frontline management development is viewed as a key organisational process aimed at delivering successful organisational renewal. For frontline managers these new expectations signal fundamental changes in their roles. An important finding is that the organisational context within which the implementation of the FMI has taken place and the nature of participant characteristics (especially educational qualifications) have influenced participants' perceptions and attitudes towards the FMI. While the rhetoric surrounding the implementation of the FMI focuses on greater organisational productivity, high performing managers, self direction, flexible approach to <b>skill</b> recognition, national <b>accreditation</b> and transferability of skills, in practice the underpinning assumptions of the FMI, including organisational reality (power and politics), make at least some of this rhetoric questionable. As a MD and training technology for managers it is neither a neutral nor an objective process and therefore should not be viewed as an isolated process taking place in organisations. The FMI is a means of crafting distinct frontline managerial identities in organisations and as such may also fall victim to workplace practices and managerial prerogatives. The National Training Framework also emerges as a critical factor in maintaining the quality, credibility and relevance of the FMI training and qualification. Weak training arrangements have had important consequences for the implementation of the FMI. In particular inconsistent implementation of National Training Framework policies has impacted on the quality and relevance of FMI training delivery, the recognition that training receives (within and outside organisations) and the extent to which it achieves the objectives of transferable and consistent training outcomes for frontline managers. Finally, the overall success of the FMI policy is questioned in this thesis. The thesis demonstrates that perceptions of a 'successful' FMI policy are strongly linked to institutional interests. Attention is drawn towards the 'politics of FMI' and the instrumental behaviour displayed by policy makers to protect their institutional interests...|$|R
