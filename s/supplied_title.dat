40|$|Abstract Background We {{conducted}} {{this analysis}} to determine i) which journals publish high-quality, clinically relevant studies in internal medicine, general/family practice, general practice nursing, and mental health; and ii) {{the proportion of}} clinically relevant articles in each journal. Methods We performed an analytic survey of a hand search of 170 general medicine, general healthcare, and specialty journals for 2000. Research staff assessed individual articles by using explicit criteria for scientific merit for healthcare application. Practitioners assessed the clinical importance of these articles. Outcome measures were the number of high-quality, clinically relevant studies published in the 170 journal titles {{and how many of}} these were published in each of four discipline-specific, secondary "evidence-based" journals (ACP Journal Club for internal medicine and its subspecialties; Evidence-Based Medicine for general/family practice; Evidence-Based Nursing for general practice nursing; and Evidence-Based Mental Health for all aspects of mental health). Original studies and review articles were classified for purpose: therapy and prevention, screening and diagnosis, prognosis, etiology and harm, economics and cost, clinical prediction guides, and qualitative studies. Results We evaluated 60, 352 articles from 170 journal titles. The pass criteria of high-quality methods and clinically relevant material were met by 3059 original articles and 1073 review articles. For ACP Journal Club (internal medicine), four <b>titles</b> <b>supplied</b> 56. 5 % of the articles and 27 <b>titles</b> <b>supplied</b> the other 43. 5 %. For Evidence-Based Medicine (general/family practice), five <b>titles</b> <b>supplied</b> 50. 7 % of the articles and 40 <b>titles</b> <b>supplied</b> the remaining 49. 3 %. For Evidence-Based Nursing (general practice nursing), seven <b>titles</b> <b>supplied</b> 51. 0 % of the articles and 34 additional <b>titles</b> <b>supplied</b> 49. 0 %. For Evidence-Based Mental Health (mental health), nine <b>titles</b> <b>supplied</b> 53. 2 % of the articles and 34 additional <b>titles</b> <b>supplied</b> 46. 8 %. For the disciplines of internal medicine, general/family practice, and mental health (but not general practice nursing), the number of clinically important articles was correlated withScience Citation Index (SCI) Impact Factors. Conclusions Although many clinical journals publish high-quality, clinically relevant and important original studies and systematic reviews, the articles for each discipline studied were concentrated in a small subset of journals. This subset varied according to healthcare discipline; however, many of the important articles for all disciplines in this study were published in broad-based healthcare journals rather than subspecialty or discipline-specific journals. </p...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} new empirical results {{regarding the}} demand and <b>supply</b> of <b>title,</b> {{its impact on}} land value, {{and its effects on}} agricultural investment on Brazilian frontiers. We use survey data from 1992 and 1993 from the state of Par  with data on the characteristics of the settlers, land tenure, land agencies involved, land values, and investment. We then turn to census data from the Brazilian agricultural census from 1940 through 1985, with observations at the municipio (county) level to examine the development of property rights to land in the southern state of Paran  during the agricultural boom between 1940 and 1970 and in the Amazon state of Par  during the period of rapid migration to the region after 1970. By examining frontiers we can follow the rise in land values, the increase in the demand for title, and the response of government. The empirical findings support the predictions of the theory regarding the effects of title and investment on land value, the role of expected change in value on demand for title, and the contribution of title in promoting investment. Governments, however, have not exactly followed the predictions of the analytical framework in <b>supplying</b> <b>title.</b> Political and bureaucratic factors {{play an important role in}} the government response to demands for title. This result suggests that researchers must pay special attention to the complex political process by which property rights are assigned in studying the emergence of tenure institutions. ...|$|R
