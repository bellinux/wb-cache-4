25|$|Brazilian jiu-jitsu (BJJ) and jujutsu came to {{international}} {{prominence in the}} martial arts community in the early 1990s, when BJJ expert Royce Gracie won the first, second and fourth Ultimate Fighting Championships, {{which at the time}} were single-elimination martial arts tournaments. Royce often fought against much larger opponents who practiced other styles, including boxing, wrestling, shoot-fighting, karate and taekwondo. It has since become a staple art and key component for many MMA fighters. BJJ and jujutsu are largely credited for bringing widespread attention to the importance of ground fighting. BJJ is primarily a ground-based fighting style that emphasizes joint locks and chokeholds, whereas jujutsu is a method of close combat that utilizes different forms of grappling techniques such as throws, holds and joint locks. As jujutsu may also involve the use of a <b>short</b> <b>weapon,</b> it cannot be used to its full potential in mixed martial arts which prohibits the use of such weapons. Current fighters who are known for their BJJ skills include Joe Lauzon, Ronaldo Souza, Demian Maia, Fabrício Werdum and Rafael Dos Anjos.|$|E
2500|$|The caliber for the OHWS {{was quickly}} {{decided not to}} be the NATO {{standard}} [...] 9mm due to lack of stopping power. [...] The FBI had selected the 10 mm auto to replace their 9mm pistols, but it was too powerful, few manufacturers produced it, and the round caused <b>short</b> <b>weapon</b> service life.

25|$|<b>Shorter</b> <b>weapons</b> (<b>short</b> {{swords and}} {{possibly}} sometimes daggers) {{were known as}} semispathae or half-swords. A large 3rd-century hoard from Künzing included one triangular-bladed short sword and several narrow-bladed short swords (with 23–39cm blades). Bishop and Coulston suggest that some or all were made from broken spathae.|$|R
50|$|The Macedonian phalanxes {{were made}} up {{almost entirely of}} pezhetairoi. Pezhetairoi were very {{effective}} against both enemy cavalry and infantry, as their long pikes {{could be used to}} impale enemies charging on horse-back or to keep enemy infantry with <b>shorter</b> <b>weapons</b> at bay.|$|R
50|$|It may {{be argued}} that a short iron shaft has very few confirmations from archaeology. Vegetius is writing about a one-foot iron shaft because at Vegetius' time the pilum had {{disappeared}} and been replaced by similar <b>shorter</b> <b>weapons</b> such as the plumbatae or the above-mentioned spiculum.|$|R

"Goodwife," [...] said he, [...] "I am Hugh Morrison from Glenae, come of the Manly Morrisons of auld lang syne, {{that never}} took <b>short</b> <b>weapon</b> against {{a man in}} their lives.

The others sprang up with a cheer. The inclosure below them was shallower now from the number that had fallen, and {{was filled with a}} confused mass of struggling men. In their midst was Bathurst fighting desperately with his <b>short</b> <b>weapon,</b> and bringing down a man at every blow, the mutineers being too crowded together to use their unfixed bayonets against him. In a moment Captain Forster leaped down, sword in hand, and joined Bathurst in the fight.|$|E
60|$|Alas! for {{the poor}} man, even though his {{stabbing}} powers had been good instead of bad, for he would only have imbedded the <b>short</b> <b>weapon</b> in a mass of fat without touching the heart. But Grummidge was a bad stabber. He missed his aim so badly as to plunge his weapon into the hood! Nothing {{could have been more}} fortunate. The air escaped and the hood collapsed. At the same moment Grummidge received an ugly scratch on the cheek which sent him sprawling. As he rose quickly he observed Swinton's club, which he grasped and brought vigorously down on the seal's now unprotected nose, and felled it. Another effective blow terminated its career for ever, and then the victor turned to find that Big Swinton lay on the ice, quite conscious {{of what was going on}} though utterly unable to move hand or foot.|$|E

Bowmen have very long attack range, good load speed (rate of fire), but poor melee and {{anti-collision}} capabilities.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>shorter</b> <b>weapon</b> length {{often results}} in a shorter sight radius, {{impairing}} accuracy at distance, as well as reducing bayonet effectiveness in close combat. However, since bullpups are more frequently used in close-quarters combat and bayonets are rarely {{used in the present}} day, these are generally less of an issue.|$|R
5000|$|The Uzi (עוזי, officially cased as UZI) [...] is {{a family}} of Israeli open-bolt, blowback-operated submachine guns. Smaller {{variants}} {{are considered to be}} machine pistols. The Uzi {{was one of the first}} weapons to use a telescoping bolt design which allows the magazine to be housed in the pistol grip for a <b>shorter</b> <b>weapon.</b>|$|R
6000|$|The Somali dagger is an iron blade about {{eighteen}} {{inches long}} by two in breadth, pointed and sharp at both edges. The handle is of buffalo or other horn, {{with a double}} scoop to fit the grasp; and at the hilt is a conical ornament of zinc. It is worn strapped round the waist by a thong sewed to the sheath, and long enough to encircle the body twice: {{the point is to}} the right, and the handle projects on the left. When in town, the Somal wear their daggers under the Tobe: in battle, the strap is girt over the cloth to prevent the latter being lost. They always stab from above: this is as it should be, a thrust with a <b>short</b> <b>weapon</b> [...] "underhand" [...] may be stopped, if the adversary have strength enough to hold the stabber's forearm. The thrust is parried with the shield, and a wound is rarely mortal except in the back: from the great length of the blade, the least movement of the man attacked causes it to fall upon the shoulder-blade.|$|E
6000|$|... "Gentlemen, as to {{the laws}} my brother talks of, they may be known in the bull-ring, or the bear-garden, or the cock-pit, {{but they are not}} known here. Or, if they should be so far {{admitted}} as furnishing a species of proof that no malice was intended in this sort of combat, from which fatal accidents do sometimes arise, it can only be so admitted when both parties are IN PARI CASU, equally acquainted with, and equally willing to refer themselves to, that species of arbitrament. But will it be contended that a man of superior rank and education is to be subjected, or is obliged to subject himself, to this coarse and brutal strife, perhaps in opposition to a younger, stronger, or more skilful opponent? Certainly even the pugilistic code, if founded upon the fair play of Merry Old England, as my brother alleges it to be, can contain nothing so preposterous. And, gentlemen of the jury, if the laws would support an English gentleman, wearing, we will suppose, his sword, in defending himself by force against a violent personal aggression of the nature offered to this prisoner, they will not less protect a foreigner and a stranger, involved in the same unpleasing circumstances. If, therefore, gentlemen of the jury, when thus pressed by a VIS MAJOR, the object of obloquy to a whole company, and of direct violence from one at least, and, as he might reasonably apprehend, from more, the panel had produced the weapon which his countrymen, as we are informed, generally carry about their persons, and the same unhappy circumstance had ensued which you have heard detailed in evidence, I could not in my conscience have asked from you a verdict of murder. The prisoner's personal defence might indeed, even in that case, have gone more or less beyond the MODERAMEN INCULPATAE TUTELAE, spoken of by lawyers; but the punishment incurred would have been that of manslaughter, not of murder. I beg leave to add that I should have thought this milder species of charge was demanded in the case supposed, notwithstanding the statute of James I. cap. 8, which takes the case of slaughter by stabbing with a <b>short</b> <b>weapon,</b> even without MALICE PREPENSE, out of the benefit of clergy. For this statute of stabbing, as it is termed, arose out of a temporary cause; and as the real guilt is the same, whether the slaughter be committed by the dagger, or by sword or pistol, the benignity of the modern law places them all on the same, or nearly the same, footing.|$|E

50|$|By {{the late}} 18th century, these rifles had evolved to being shorter than earlier hunting weapons and were {{generally}} {{shorter than the}} typical military musket, with no provision for a bayonet. The <b>shorter</b> <b>weapon</b> was easier to load and more practical in skirmish combat. However, there was some loss of accuracy and the shorter barrel used meant the powder charges less efficiently.|$|R
