40|$|Drawing on {{qualitative}} {{in-depth interviews}} with 46 <b>stepfathers,</b> we explore how <b>stepfathers</b> characterize the biological father and their re-lations with him. We focus specifically on in-stances in which <b>stepfathers</b> {{directly and indirectly}} act like a father ally; that is, they pre-sumably help the father sustain or improve {{his relationship with his}} child. Our analysis gener-ates theoretical insights about father ally prop-erties (development, purpose, awareness level, reciprocity routines, building trust/respect, and social capital) while discussing conditions that either facilitate (male bonding, avoiding the threshold of discomfort, <b>stepfather’s</b> romantic relationship security, father’s perceived worthi...|$|R
40|$|Girls {{who grow}} up in {{households}} with an unrelated adult male reach menarche earlier than peers, a finding hypothesized to be an evolutionary strategy for families under stress. The authors tested the alternative hypothesis that nonrandom selection into <b>stepfathering</b> due to shared environmental and/or genetic predispositions creates a spurious relation between <b>stepfathering</b> and early menarche. Using the unique controls for genetic and shared environmental experiences offered by the children-of-twins design, the authors found that cousins discordant for <b>stepfathering</b> {{did not differ in}} age of menarche. Moreover, controlling for mother 2 ̆ 7 s age of menarche eliminated differences in menarcheal age associated with <b>stepfathering</b> in unrelated girls. These findings strongly suggest selection, and not causation, accounts for the relationship between <b>stepfathering</b> and early menarche...|$|R

5|$|His mother {{raised the}} family, {{including}} Coleman's brother (Lillashawn) and sister, in the Humboldt Park community area, then the West Side and finally Oak Park. Coleman describes his <b>stepfather</b> as a long-time gang member with an extensive criminal record. After enduring formative years with gunfights outside elementary school, home loss {{due to an}} apartment fire, and expulsion hearings, his <b>stepfather,</b> Mose Oliver, introduced him to wrestling {{to keep him out}} of trouble. Federal records confirm that Oliver is an alleged 1990s gang enforcer who served time from 2004 to 2011 for participation in Operation Day Trader. The wrestling started in about 2001. By sixth grade both his father and <b>stepfather</b> were incarcerated and his father figure was his wrestling coach, Mike Powell. Coleman attended Ella Flagg Young elementary school. Barral raised her family with little assistance away from the gang influences of the West Side. She applied for section 8 assistance.

Two hundred Australians completed vignette-based questionnaires assessing normative expectations of <b>stepfathers</b> financial contribution.

Most participants believed <b>stepfathers</b> should contribute financially, but responses varied greatly. Defacto relationships and maternal employment reduced obligation. A significant 3 -way interaction was also found. Qualitative responses were analysed from a normative expectations and distributive justice perspective. Findings support the use and integration of these theories in studying stepfamily responsibilities. Implications and areas for future research were discusse...|$|R

5|$|Cleomenes, {{who was now}} {{confident}} {{of the strength of}} his position, began plotting against the ephors. He first recruited his <b>stepfather,</b> persuading him of the need {{to do away with the}} ephors. Cleomenes contended they could then make the ephors' property common to all citizens and work toward the achievement of Spartan supremacy in Greece. Having won over his <b>stepfather,</b> Cleomenes started preparing his revolution. Employing the men he considered most likely to oppose him (probably in an attempt to get them killed), he captured Heraea and Asea. He also brought in food for the citizens of Orchomenus—which the Achaeans were besieging—before camping outside Mantinea. This campaign exhausted his opponents, who asked to remain in Arcadia so they could rest. Cleomenes then advanced upon Sparta with his mercenaries and sent some loyal followers to slay the ephors. Four of the five ephors were killed; the sole survivor was Agylaeus, who managed to escape and sought sanctuary in a temple.|$|E
