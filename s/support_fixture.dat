40|$|Curved crystal, {{focusing}} monochromators featuring cubed-root thickness profiles typically employ side-clamped cooling {{to reduce}} thermally induced overall bend deformation of the crystal. While performance is improved, residual bend deformation {{is often an}} important limiting factor in the monochromator performance. A slightly asymmetric “I-beam ” crystal cross section with cubed-root flange profiles has been developed to further reduce this effect. Physical motivation, finite-element modeling evaluation and performance characteristics of this design are discussed. Reduction of high mounting stress at the fixed end of the crystal required the soldering of an Invar <b>support</b> <b>fixture</b> to the crystal.

Risk analysis can be conducted by various means, but the basis is formed by either objectively or subjectively determining probability of occurrence of an event. In the case of rock engineering, this event is either instability or excavation failure. Rock mass classification systems provide objective analysis of data collected on a typically subjective basis that also relate closely to excavation stability.

40|$|AbstractHigh {{efficient}} and precise slicing method {{is required for}} the slicing of silicon carbide ingot. The newly developed multi-wire electrical discharge slicing method would decrease the kerf width and the cracks generated on machined surface. However, much higher wire tension is required in order to reduce wire vibration and to perform a smaller kerf width. Thin wire electrode with round section does not have enough cross sectional area under the high wire tension condition. Therefore, a wire electrode with track- shaped section was proposed and applied to the wire EDM slicing of silicon carbide ingot. The running control of wire electrode with track-shaped section was experimentally investigated. The side support method with fixture plates could decrease the kerf width by brass coated steel wire electrode with track-shaped section.

In such applications, {{it is important to}} analyze the influence of aging on the non-linear behavior of the adhesive in an assembly. The standardized thick adherend shear test (TAST), often used to analyze the full stress-strain curve under shear loading, characteristically has large edge effects. Crack propagation close to the substrate-adhesive interfaces is observed and thus can lead to incorrect analysis of the behavior of the adhesive.

Department of Energy (DOE) Tanks Focus Area Retrieval and Closure program, the DOE Environmental Management International Programs, and delegates from Russia as {{a technology that}} could be implemented in tank waste retrieval operations in the United States. The PMP is basically a jet mixer powered by a pressure/vacuum supply system. A prototype PMP {{was provided by the}} Russian Mining and Chemical Combine and evaluated as a potential retrieval tool in FY 1997 at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL). Based on this evaluation, Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) and DOE staff determined that a modified PMP would meet project needs for bulk mobilization of sludge from {{one or more of the}} Gunite and Associated Tanks (GAAT) at ORNL. In FY 1998, PMP technology was selected for deployment in one of the GAAT to mobilize settled solids. Deployment of the PMP was expected to reduce operation and maintenance costs required to utilize more expensive retrieval systems. The following series of cold tests and inspections were conducted on one of the three PMP units provided to verify the acceptability and readiness of the mixing system for operation in the GAATs at ORNL: (1) Inspections and measurements designed to evaluate the integrity of the equipment: Fabrication shop inspections, Equipment inspections, Vibration/oscillation measurements, Hydrostatic pressure tests. (2) Functionality of the system components: Tank riser interface functionality, Decontamination spray ring (DSR) functionality, Valves, actuator, sensors, and control system functionality, <b>Support</b> <b>fixture</b> tests; and Contamination control assessment. (3) Mixing and operational performance of the PMP system: DSR performance, PMP debris tolerance, PMP performance with water only, PMP cleaning radius determination, and PMP performance with sludge surrogates. The results from these tests indicate that the PMP should be successful in mixing materials with characteristics similar to sand, kaolin clay, and gravel at moderate operating pressure in a 20 -ft-diam tank similar to the GAAT TH- 4.

40|$|The present {{test program}} {{is carried out}} {{as a part of}} the {{on-going}} revision of the Norwegian Concrete Association's publication no. 7 (Sprayed concrete for rock support), which, among others, is to be harmonized with the new European standards dealing with energy absorption capacity for fibre reinforced sprayed concrete. The new European standards describe square panels (continuous support), while the Norwegian tradition has been to test round panels (also continuous support) as described in the previous version of NB 7. The program that has been undertaken is a comparative study of these two methods. The present report gives the results from the fourth test series in this program and is focused on the effect of friction during such tests. The used concrete mix has a nominal water-to-binder ratio of 0. 42 and has a 20 kg/m 3 dosage of 35 mm long steel fibres with end-hooks. All specimens were ready-mixed and cast in-situ (not sprayed). The 28 -days compressive strength of the concrete was 72 MPa. The potential effect of friction is the same for round and square panels, presuming that the support material is the same. It is assumed that four perpendicular cracks form and that the cracks are oriented normal to the support. A theoretical evaluation reveals that the effect of friction will be somewhat less for square panels if the cracks are oriented closer to the corners. The energy absorption capacity (EAC) test results show that the average coefficient of variation (COV) was 7. 8 % for the two individual sets with round panels and, similarly, 11. 7 % for the square panels. The average COV for EAC for the two different friction conditions were quite similar. The EAC from square and round panels at similar support (friction) conditions corresponded well. In panel tests with continuous support the friction occurs in two directions; tangential and radial. The tangential- and radial movements of the panel relative to the support have been quantified. The results show that the friction conditions between the concrete panel and the <b>support</b> <b>fixture</b> has a great impact on the measured energy uptake. For the case denoted ''standard'' conditions, which is the normal set-up for panel tests, the results show that 35 % of the overall energy uptake between zero and 25 mm deflection is due to friction, and the remaining 65 % is due to fibre action in the concrete panel. When friction is eliminated in the test, the results show on average, that the maximum load during the test is reduced by 15 % and the residual load at 25 mm deflection is reduced by 46 %. By using the energy balance equations the coefficient of friction was deduced from the test results. It is found that the coefficient of friction is substantial and that it increases as the test proceeds. This may be associated with a gradual penetration of the sharp concrete crack edges into the wooden support. Adjustments of the early non-linear behaviour of the load deflection curves have been made in accordance to the procedure in ASTM 1550 - 05. The adjustments had no significant effect on the calculated energy absorption capacity...|$|E

Spatial {{curved blades}} {{have been widely}} used in major {{aerospace}} manufacturers due to their light weight, high structural efficiency, high reliability, etc. However, their processing deformation, processing difficulty, and so on limit their use. In order to deal with the situation, flexible multi-point auxiliary <b>supporting</b> <b>fixture</b> for the processing of spatial curved thin-walled parts has become a major topic of current researches. The layout of positioning and clamping points of the flexible multi-point fixture direct affects the stiffness of clamping positions on the thin-walled parts to be processed. When cutting force is definite at a certain point in machining, the greater the stiffness at the processing positions on the part, the smaller the processing deformation due to the cutting force. Therefore, {{in order to reduce the}} machining deformation due to the poor stiffness, a suitable positioning and clamping layout is needed to improve the surface stiffness at the machining positions. Thus, the machining quality of thin-walled parts can be improved...|$|R

An important challenge is the reliability of these deformable devices under thermal stress.
