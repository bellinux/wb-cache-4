50|$|<b>Spar</b> <b>varnish</b> is a wood {{finishing}} varnish.|$|E
50|$|The rawhide webbing of {{traditional}} snowshoes, as noted above, needs regular waterproofing. <b>Spar</b> <b>varnish</b> {{is the preferred}} waterproofing for traditional snowshoes. A light sanding is preferred before 3 coats of <b>spar</b> <b>varnish</b> is applied. Modern snowshoes need no regular maintenance save a sharpening of cleats if desired.|$|E
50|$|In {{applications}} {{where a lot}} of flexing {{is expected}} the whipping may be impregnated with dilute <b>spar</b> <b>varnish</b> or superglue.|$|E
5000|$|Despite this, the {{widespread}} perception of [...] "marine products" [...] as [...] "tough" [...] led to domestic outdoor varnishes being branded as [...] "Spar varnish" [...] and {{sold on the}} virtue of their weather- and UV-resistance. These claims may {{be more or less}} realistic, depending on individual products. Only relatively recently have <b>spar</b> <b>varnishes</b> been available that can offer both effective elasticity and UV-resistance.|$|R
40|$|Remarkable {{increases}} {{in the performance of}} complex systems can be achieved by a collective approach to optimizing individual factors that influence performance. This approach, termed the aggregation of marginal gains, is tested here as a means of improving the performance of exterior clear-coatings. We focused on five factors that influence clear-coating performance: dimensional stability of wood; photostability of the wood surface; moisture ingress via end-grain; coating flexibility and photostability; and finally coating thickness. We performed preliminary research to select effective wood pre-treatments and durable clear-coatings, and then tested coating systems with good solutions to each of the aforementioned issues (factors). Red oak and radiata pine panels were modified with PF-resin, end-sealed, and thick acrylic, alkyd or <b>spar</b> <b>varnishes</b> were applied to the panels. Panels were exposed to the weather and the level of coating defects was assessed every year over a 4 -year period. All of the coatings are performing well on PF-modified pine after 4 yearsâ€™ outdoor exposure. In contrast, coatings failed after 2 years on unmodified pine and they are failing on PF-modified oak. We conclude that our approach shows promise. Future research will build on the current work by developing solutions to additional factors that influence clear-coating performance...|$|R
5000|$|The small cedar-hull and fir-spar boat has a sail of {{approximately}} 100 sq ft and an 8 in draft (board up). A new one costs nearly $17,000 (less sail), while older ones {{come on the}} market from time to time. Beetles are built as planks of Atlantic white cedar over white oak frames. The seams are caulked with cotton. Though hull colors, and to a greater extent, sail colors vary, the classic colors are a white hull, green below the waterline, a natural cedar cockpit (or on older boats gray), and [...] "Beetle Buff," [...] a sort of burnt orange, for the canvas-covered deck. The <b>spars</b> are <b>varnished.</b>|$|R
50|$|There {{are also}} {{mixtures}} sold as finishing oils. These are classed as 'long oils', predominantly oil with some varnish added or as 'short oils' which are predominantly varnish, with some oil. Danish oil {{is a popular}} long oil finishing oil. <b>Spar</b> <b>varnish</b> is a short oil varnish, used for added flexibility and elasticity.|$|E
50|$|<b>Spar</b> <b>varnish</b> was {{originally}} developed for coating the spars of sailing ships. These formed {{part of the}} masts and rigging, so suffered a hard life in service. They were flexed by the wind loads they supported, attacked by sea and bad weather, and also suffered from UV degradation from long-term exposure to sunlight.|$|E
50|$|Neoprene/nylon decks also {{displayed}} superior water resistance, neither stretching as rawhide will when wet nor requiring annual {{treatment with}} <b>spar</b> <b>varnish,</b> features that were immediately appreciated. Eventually they were replaced with even lighter {{materials such as}} polypropylene. This tendency also {{gave way to the}} creation of inflatable snowshoes made of different fabrics such as cordura and thermoplatic polyurethane (TPU).|$|E
5000|$|The glider {{featured}} two wooden parallel trusses {{running along}} its spine, with two widely spaced truss wing spars. Wing ribs {{were attached to}} the <b>spar</b> with <b>varnished</b> shoelaces. The wing shape featured a straight leading edge with the trailing edge tapering back to the tail giving it a distinctive [...] "Half Pie" [...] appearance from the top. The vertical stabilizers were low, but ran {{the full length of}} the fuselage on either side with small canard like control surfaces at the leading edge. The aircraft had conventional landing gear. The pilot sat in a small [...] "bucket" [...] embedded {{in the center of the}} wing. A clear plastic leading edge helped ease the poor downward visibility. The internal volume of the wing was so large that Snyder planned on using Helium to assist in buoyancy, giving it the name [...] "Dirigiplane" [...] in several publications. The assisted lift concept was never applied to the glider though.|$|R
60|$|Nelson's Cove--as {{we used to}} call it--was {{crowded with}} {{shipping}} that day. There was first my steamer, then the Neptun gunboat further out, and the Bonito, brig, anchored as usual so close inshore that it looked as if, with a little skill and judgment, one could shy a hat from the verandah on to her scrupulously holystoned quarter-deck. Her brasses flashed like gold, her white body-paint had a sheen like a satin robe. The rake of her <b>varnished</b> <b>spars</b> and the big yards, squared to a hair, gave her a sort of martial elegance. She was a beauty. No wonder that in possession of a craft like that and the promise of a girl like Freya, Jasper lived in a state of perpetual elation fit, perhaps, for the seventh heaven, but not exactly safe in a world like ours.|$|R
50|$|When first developed, no {{varnishes}} {{had good}} UV-resistance. Even after more modern synthetic resins did become resistant, a true <b>spar</b> <b>varnish</b> maintained its elasticity above other virtues, {{even if this}} required a compromise in its UV-resistance. Spar varnishes are thus not necessarily {{the best choice for}} outdoor woodwork which does not need to bend in service.|$|E
50|$|<b>Spar</b> <b>varnish</b> (also called marine varnish) was {{originally}} {{intended for use}} on ship or boat spars, to protect the timber {{from the effects of}} sea and weather. Spars bend under the load of their sails. The primary requirements were water resistance and also elasticity, so as to remain adhering as the spars flexed. Elasticity was a pre-condition for weatherproofing too, as a finish that cracked would then allow water through, even if the remaining film was impermeable. Appearance and gloss was of relatively low value. Modified tung oil and phenolic resins are often used.|$|E
50|$|On boats, {{particularly}} wooden boats, brightwork {{is exposed}} metal and varnished woodworking, though amongst the yachting set it more often {{refers to the}} woodwork. The metal is usually brass or bronze that is kept polished, or stainless steel, which requires less maintenance. In the past, due to the environmental exposure experienced by boats, corrosion and UV damage made maintaining brightwork both Sisyphean and extremely labor-intensive. However, {{with the development of}} improved UV-absorbers and filters in the chemical composition of the various marine varnishes (<b>spar</b> <b>varnish,</b> polyurethane, or linear polyurethane), this work is not as intensive as it once was. Varnished finishes are maintained by sanding and re-finishing, and metalwork is maintained by polishing.|$|E
50|$|The most {{important}} condition for such varnishes to resist was the mechanical flexing. This required a varnish that was flexible and elastic. Without elasticity, the varnish would soon crack, allowing water to penetrate to the wood beneath. At the time, varnish production was rudimentary {{and had only}} simple materials with which to work. It pre-dated the development of modern polymer chemistry. <b>Spar</b> <b>varnish</b> was a 'short oil' varnish, where {{a small proportion of}} a finishing oil, universally boiled linseed oil, was added to a majority proportion of varnish (see Danish oil for a 'long oil' finish). This gave flexibility, even though its weather resistance was still poor and relatively frequent re-coating was required.|$|E
50|$|Exterior use of {{polyurethane}} varnish may {{be problematic}} {{due to its}} heightened susceptibility to deterioration through ultra-violet light exposure. All clear or translucent varnishes, and indeed all film-polymer coatings (e.g. paint, stain, epoxy, synthetic plastic, etc.) are susceptible to this damage in varying degrees. Pigments in paints and stains protect against UV damage. UV-absorbers are added to polyurethane and other varnishes (e.g. <b>spar</b> <b>varnish)</b> to work against UV damage but are decreasingly effective {{over the course of}} 2-4 years, depending on {{the quantity and quality of}} UV-absorbers added, as well as the severity and duration of sun exposure. Water exposure, humidity, temperature extremes, and other environmental factors affect all finishes. By contrast, wooden items retrieved from the Egyptian pyramids have a new and fresh appearance after 4000 years of storage. Even there, however, fungal colonies were present, and mildew and fungus are another category of entities which attack varnish. In other words, the only coat of varnish with near perfect durability is the one stored in a vacuum, in darkness, at a low and unvarying temperature. Otherwise, care and upkeep are required.|$|E
40|$|Both {{laboratory}} and weather-exposure corrosion tests showed conclusively that the protection afforded by aluminum pigmented <b>spar</b> <b>varnish</b> coatings applied to previously anodized aluminum surfaces was greatly superior to that {{afforded by the}} same coatings applied to surfaces which had simply been cleaned free from grease and not anodized...|$|E
