6000|$|Of Edentates {{there are}} four. The giant {{armadillo}} does not range so far, and the delicate little pink fairy armadillo, the truncated Chlamydophorus, is a dweller in the sand-dunes of Mendoza, {{and has never}} colonized the grassy pampas. The Tatusia hybrida, called [...] "little mule" [...] from the length of its ears, and the Dasypus tricinctus, which, when disturbed, rolls itself into a ball, the wedge-shaped head and wedge-shaped tail admirably fitting into the deep-cut <b>shell</b> <b>side</b> by side; and the quirquincho (Dasypus minutus), all inhabit the pampa, are diurnal, and feed exclusively on insects, chiefly ants. Wherever the country becomes settled, these three disappear, owing to the dulness of their senses, especially that of sight, and to the diurnal habit, which was an advantage to them, and enabled them to survive when rapacious animals, which are mostly nocturnal, were their only enemies. The fourth, and most important, is the hairy armadillo, with habits which are in strange contrast to those of its perishing congeners, and which seem to mock many hard-and-fast rules concerning animal life. It is omnivorous, and will thrive on anything from grass to flesh, found dead and in all stages of decay, or captured by means of its own strategy. Furthermore, its habits change to suit its conditions: thus, where nocturnal carnivores are its enemies, it is diurnal; but where man appears as a chief persecutor, it becomes nocturnal. It is much hunted for its flesh, dogs being trained for the purpose; yet it actually becomes more abundant as population increases in any district; and, if versatility in habits or adaptiveness can {{be taken as a}} measure of intelligence, this poor armadillo, a survival of the past, so old on the earth as to have existed contemporaneously with the giant glyptodon, is the superior of the large-brained cats and canines.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} {{has focused on}} the use of coil heat {{exchangers}} (CHEs) with microencapsulated phase change material (MPCM) slurries to understand if CHEs can yield greater rates of heat transfer. An experimental study was conducted using a counterflow CHE consisting of 3 helical coils. Two separate tests were conducted, one where water was used as heat transfer fluid (HTF) on the coil and <b>shell</b> <b>sides,</b> respectively; while the second one made use of MPCM slurry and water on the coil and <b>shell</b> <b>sides,</b> respectively. The NTU-effectiveness relationship of the CHE when MPCM fluid is used approaches that of a heat exchanger with a heat capacity ratio of zero. The heat transfer results have shown that when using a MPCM slurry, an increase in heat transfer rate can be obtained when compared to heat transfer results obtained using straight heat transfer sections. It has been concluded that the increased specific heat of the slurry as well as the fluid dynamics in helical coil pipes are the main contributors to the increased heat transfer...|$|R

50|$|Two fluids, of {{different}} starting temperatures, {{flow through the}} heat exchanger. One flows through the tubes (the tube side) and the other flows outside the tubes but inside the shell (the <b>shell</b> <b>side).</b> Heat is transferred from one fluid to the other through the tube walls, either from tube side to <b>shell</b> <b>side</b> or vice versa. The fluids can be either liquids or gases on either the shell or the tube side. In order to transfer heat efficiently, a large heat transfer area should be used, leading {{to the use of}} many tubes. In this way, waste heat can be put to use. This is an efficient way to conserve energy.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Starting {{from the}} {{analysis}} of stresses on narrow <b>side</b> <b>shell,</b> based the principle that the stresses of narrow <b>side</b> <b>shell</b> will be less than the hot strength of cast steel grade, the maximum rate of displacement in course of freely bulging under hydrostatic pressure is deduced in this paper.

According to critical strain hypothesis, after investigation a proper casting speed is set to make the strain of wide <b>side</b> <b>shell</b> less than the critical strain and so to ensure the shell thickness in exit of mold meeting with production requirements...|$|R

50|$|Larger {{condensers}} {{are also}} used in industrial-scale distillation processes to cool distilled vapor into liquid distillate.

50|$|A surface {{condenser}} {{is an example}} of such a heat-exchange system. It is a shell and tube heat exchanger installed at the outlet of every steam turbine in thermal power stations. Commonly, the cooling water flows through the tube side and the steam enters the <b>shell</b> <b>side</b> where the condensation occurs {{on the outside of the}} heat transfer tubes. The condensate drips down and collects at the bottom, often in a built-in pan called a hotwell. The <b>shell</b> <b>side</b> often operates at a vacuum or partial vacuum, produced by the difference in specific volume between the steam and condensate. Conversely, the vapor can be fed through the tubes with the coolant water or air flowing around the outside.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} and investigates two common techniques of modeling large periodic <b>side</b> <b>shell</b> openings in global {{finite element models}} for evaluation of passenger ship hull girder static response in early design phase. The first technique is based on homogenization of <b>side</b> <b>shell</b> structure and modeling <b>side</b> <b>shell</b> openings with homogenized orthotropic material using 4 -noded and 8 -noded shell elements. Second technique is direct modeling of <b>side</b> <b>shell</b> openings using coarse mesh, where cost of simplification to geometry and mesh size is studied. The proposed techniques are validated with respect to 3 D fine mesh analysis in two cases. First, periodic <b>side</b> <b>shell</b> model is studied for evaluation of correct in plane response under uniform axial and shear loading. Second, the techniques are investigated in a box-like ship under 4 -point bending load. Accuracy of both techniques is evaluated by means of hull girder deflection, longitudinal deck forces and <b>side</b> <b>shell</b> vertical shear forces. In addition, the performance in border of periodic grid and at areas of high strain gradients is investigated. The results indicate that equivalent orthotropic modeling of both central and offset openings gives accurate global deflection and longitudinal bending response in a simple model where strain gradients are small. When significant strain gradients are introduced e. g. where internal longitudinal bulkheads are discontinuous, the deflection and longitudinal bending response accuracies are compromised. Local response of orthotropic model is less accurate and especially compromised at edges of periodic grid and areas of high strain gradient. Additional local errors arise due to micropolar behavior of offset openings, where the equivalence is only achieved in forces but not in moments due to application of classical theory of elasticity. No significant difference in response is observed whether 4 - or 8 -noded elements are applied. For coarse mesh modeling a sensitivity analysis is performed taking account effect of simplification of structure and mesh size. A reasonable compromise between modeling effort, computational cost and accuracy is found at 4 x 4 elements per opening. Despite being stiffer in uniformly loaded periodic <b>side</b> <b>shell</b> model, the accuracy of coarse mesh modeling is shown to be reliable in application to box-like ship, where performance is not significantly affected by strain gradients and boundary effects...|$|R

40|$|International audiencein {{this second}} of two papers, we {{investigated}} the influence of process parameters on BaSO(4) particle precipitation in a hollow fiber membrane device. The solution of barium chloride was passed tangentially over the membrane surface and reacted with a solution of K(2) SO(4) introduced through the membrane pores. The resulting supersaturation induced nucleation and particle growth on the lumen side of the hollow fibers. A specific technique was developed to measure crystal size directly at the outlet of the hollow fiber device by using EDTA as a neutralizing agent of crystal nucleation and growth. Concentrations of barium chloride and potassium sulphate were shown to influence mainly the CSD, the effect of inlet flow rates on the lumen and <b>shell</b> <b>sides</b> being less pronounced.

5000|$|There can be many {{variations}} on the shell and tube design. Typically, the ends of each tube are connected to plenums (sometimes called water boxes) through holes in tubesheets. The tubes may be straight or bent {{in the shape of}} a U, called U-tubes. [...] In nuclear power plants called pressurized water reactors, large heat exchangers called steam generators are two-phase, shell-and-tube heat exchangers which typically have U-tubes. They are used to boil water recycled from a surface condenser into steam to drive a turbine to produce power. Most shell-and-tube heat exchangers are either 1, 2, or 4 pass designs on the tube side. This refers to the number of times the fluid in the tubes passes through the fluid in the shell. In a single pass heat exchanger, the fluid goes in one end of each tube and out the other. [...] Surface condensers in power plants are often 1-pass straight-tube heat exchangers (see Surface condenser for diagram). Two and four pass designs are common because the fluid can enter and exit on the same side. This makes construction much simpler. There are often baffles directing flow through the <b>shell</b> <b>side</b> so the fluid does not take a short cut through the <b>shell</b> <b>side</b> leaving ineffective low flow volumes. These are generally attached to the tube bundle rather than the shell in order that the bundle is still removable for maintenance.|$|E
50|$|Heat {{exchangers}} {{with only}} one phase (liquid or gas) on each side can be called one-phase or single-phase heat exchangers. Two-phase heat exchangers {{can be used to}} heat a liquid to boil it into a gas (vapor), sometimes called boilers, or cool a vapor to condense it into a liquid (called condensers), with the phase change usually occurring on the <b>shell</b> <b>side.</b> Boilers in steam engine locomotives are typically large, usually cylindrically-shaped shell-and-tube heat exchangers. In large power plants with steam-driven turbines, shell-and-tube surface condensers are used to condense the exhaust steam exiting the turbine into condensate water which is recycled back to be turned into steam in the steam generator.|$|E

They may require pumping {{of the column}} bottoms liquid into the kettle, or there may be sufficient liquid head to deliver the liquid into the reboiler. In this reboiler type, steam flows through the tube bundle and exits as condensate. The liquid {{from the bottom of}} the tower, commonly called the bottoms, flows through the <b>shell</b> <b>side.</b> There is a retaining wall or overflow weir separating the tube bundle from the reboiler section where the residual reboiled liquid (called the bottoms product) is withdrawn, so that the tube bundle is kept covered with liquid and reduce the amount of low-boiling compounds in the bottoms product.|$|E
