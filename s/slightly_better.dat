40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} improve the {{hydration}} resistance of MgO-Al-C bricks, Fe 2 O 3 was chosen as an additive according to thermodynamic calculations. MgO-Al-C refractories were prepared by using Si, Fe 2 O 3 or both as additives. The effects of additives on the hydration resistance of specimens were investigated. XRD was conducted to determine the phase composition. The {{results showed that the}} hydration resistance of MgO-Al-C bricks would be <b>slightly</b> <b>bettered</b> with addition of only Si. However, it was helpful when Fe 2 O 3 was added along with Si. The mechanism is that Fe 2 O 3 could decompose to give off oxygen during heating, which could promote the oxidation of Al powder and inhibit the formation of Al 4 C 3 and AlN...|$|R

5|$|Batesian mimicry {{was first}} {{described}} by pioneering naturalist Henry W. Bates. When an edible prey animal comes to resemble, even slightly, a distasteful animal, natural selection favours those individuals that even very <b>slightly</b> <b>better</b> resemble the distasteful species. This is because {{even a small}} degree of protection reduces predation and increases the chance that an individual mimic will survive and reproduce. For example, many species of hoverfly are coloured black and yellow like bees, and are in consequence avoided by birds (and people).|$|E

Danny peaked with maximum sustained winds of 60mph (95km/h) and a minimum pressure of 1006 mbar (hPa; 29.71 inHg). It held this strength for about 12 hours before wind shear caused the storm to gradually weaken as it meandered northward. By August 28, Danny further deteriorated, and reconnaissance aircraft {{found that it was}} barely a tropical storm.

5|$|Other {{evidence}} suggests hunting behavior in Tyrannosaurus. The eye sockets of tyrannosaurs are positioned {{so that the}} eyes would point forward, giving them binocular vision <b>slightly</b> <b>better</b> than that of modern hawks.

It is not obvious why natural selection would have favored this long-term trend if tyrannosaurs had been pure scavengers, which would not have needed the advanced depth perception that stereoscopic vision provides. In modern animals, binocular vision is found mainly in predators.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{experiments}} {{have indicated that}} it is possible to systematically lead subjects to less refined equilibria in signaling games. In this paper, we seek to understand the process by which this occurs using Camerer and Ho's Experience Weighted Attraction (EWA) model of learning in games. We first adapt the model to extensive-form signaling games by specifying that senders update the chosen message for both the realized and unrealized type, but do not update the unchosen message. We test this model against the choice reinforcement and belief-based special cases of EWA; the latter is of particular interest because it formalizes the story about convergence to less refined equilibria offered by Brandts and Holt. We also test a variety of models which update unchosen messages. We find that while the Brandts-Holt story captures the direction of switching from one strategy to another, it does not do a good job at capturing the rate at which the switching occurs. EWA does quite well at predicting the rate of switching, and is <b>slightly</b> <b>bettered</b> by the unchosen message models, which all perform equally well...|$|R

5|$|Bigfin reef squids and {{the common}} octopus (Octopus vulgaris) were studied to resolve a century-long debate over whether {{cephalopods}} can hear. Unlike fishes, cephalopods do not possess air-filled swim bladders, which might amplify sound waves travelling in water. The results were published in 2009. It showed that bigfin reef squids and octopuses utilise their statocysts for detecting vibrations, an organ primarily used for maintaining spatial orientation. The common octopus can hear sounds between 400Hz and 1000Hz. Bigfin reef squids have a <b>slightly</b> <b>better</b> hearing range of 400Hz to 1500Hz. Both hear best at a frequency of 600Hz. Relatively, their hearing is comparable to prawns and some other invertebrates but is less sensitive than that of most fishes.|$|E

Adding spinal implant devices during fusion increases the risks but provides no added improvement in pain or function.|$|E
