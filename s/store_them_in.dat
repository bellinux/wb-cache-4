25|$|Red {{imported}} {{fire ants}} have negative impacts on seed germination. The {{extent of the}} damage, however, depends on how long seeds are vulnerable for (dry and germinating) and by the abundance of the ants. One study showed that while these ants are attracted to and remove seeds which have adapted for ant dispersal, red imported fire ants damage these seeds or move them in unfavourable locations for germination. In seeds given to colonies, 80% of Sanguinaria canadensi seeds were scarified and 86% of Viola rotundifolia seeds were destroyed. Small percentages of longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) seeds deposited by workers successfully germinate, thus providing evidence that red imported fire ants help the movement of seeds in the longleaf pine ecosystem. Elaiosome-bearing seeds are collected {{at a higher rate}} in contrast to nonelaiosome-bearing seeds and do not <b>store</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> their nests, but rather in surface trash piles in the mound vicinity.|$|E
500|$|Suillus bovinus [...] tastes {{mild and}} is edible, {{although}} it is not highly regarded. When cooked, it releases a lot of fluid, which can be collected and reduced or strained to make a sauce. Its flavour is made more intense by drying. The soft and rubbery consistency of older specimens—as well as their proneness to maggot infestation—renders them almost inedible. Fruit bodies are part of the [...] later summer diet of the red squirrel in Eurasia, which collect the mushrooms and <b>store</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> tree forks for a ready food supply after the onset of frost. There are several fly species that often use S.bovinus fruit bodies to rear their young, including Bolitophila rossica, Exechia separata, Exechiopsis indecisa, Pegomya deprimata, and Pegohylemyia silvatica.|$|E
500|$|The first table read of {{the episode}} took place on October 17, 1990. It was filmed {{in front of a}} studio {{audience}} six days later, on October 23. Seinfeld's stand-up performances were filmed on October 29, 1990, along with the performances used in [...] "The Pony Remark" [...] and [...] "The Busboy". Filming {{of the episode}} took place on stage 19 of the CBS Studio Center in Studio City, Los Angeles, California. [...] "The Ex-Girlfriend" [...] was the first episode to be filmed there, as the majority of season one was filmed in a studio called Desilu Cahuenga, in Hollywood, California, where The Dick Van Dyke Show had also been filmed. Tom Azzari designed the sets for the second season of the show, and was able to re-use various sets from the first season, thanks to Castle Rock Entertainment's decision to <b>store</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> a large storage facility. The chiropractor's waiting room, in which George believes he was charged too much for a visit, was the only new set which appeared in the episode.|$|E

2500|$|The {{decommissioning}} {{of weapons}} is a [...] "technical, traceable and verifiable procedure through which the UN receives all the weapons of the FARC to destine them {{to the construction of}} 3 monuments" [...] The FARC's decommissioning would involve the following technical procedures: registration, identification, monitoring and verification of possession, collection, storage, disablement, removal and final disposition. In short, after the UN registers, identifies and verifies possession of weapons, it would collect all of the FARC's weapons, <b>store</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> specific containers, remove them from the zone and disposes of them by building three monuments.|$|E

In one concession to the demands of the ordnance handlers, Beling agreed to store all 16 bombs alone on deck in the [...] "bomb farm" [...] area between the starboard rail and the carrier's island until they were loaded for the next day's missions.

2500|$|The hardest {{passwords}} to crack, {{for a given}} {{length and}} character set, are random character strings; if long enough they resist brute force attacks (because there are many characters) and guessing attacks (due to high entropy). However, such passwords are typically the hardest to remember. The imposition of a requirement for such passwords in a password policy may encourage users to write them down, <b>store</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> PDAs or cellphones, or share them with others as a safeguard against memory failure. While some people consider each of these user resorts to increase security risks, others suggest the absurdity of expecting users to remember distinct complex passwords {{for each of the}} dozens of accounts they access. For example, in 2005, security expert Bruce Schneier recommended writing down one's password: ...|$|E
2500|$|For costumes, {{flat storage}} may create more {{problems}} than it solves, since {{it is impossible to}} <b>store</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> this manner without forming folds and creases. [...] Therefore, unless the costume is so weakened that it cannot support its own weight, hanging storage is perhaps the best option. [...] Costumes which are unusually heavy (heavily beaded gowns, for instance), or those whose fabric may distort easily (such as some stretch fabrics, or those cut on the bias) should also be stored in flat storage. [...] Garments suitable for hanging should be placed on plastic hangers which have been padded to mimic the shape of human shoulders, and covered with a plastic or cloth cover with an open bottom to allow air circulation while keeping the costume clean. [...] Wooden hangers may have a high acid content, which may cause discolouration or decay to the costume. [...] Likewise, metal hangers do not provide sufficient support, and may lead to distortion of the garments’ shoulders. [...] Therefore, both forms of hanging should be avoided.|$|E

2500|$|Not all plant cells {{respond to}} hormones, but those cells that do are {{programmed}} to respond at specific points in their growth cycle. [...] The greatest effects occur at specific stages during the cell's life, with diminished effects occurring {{before or after}} this period. Plants need hormones at very specific times during plant growth and at specific locations. [...] They also need to disengage the effects that hormones have when {{they are no longer}} needed. The production of hormones occurs very often at sites of active growth within the meristems, before cells have fully differentiated. After production, they are sometimes moved {{to other parts of the}} plant, where they cause an immediate effect; or they can be stored in cells to be released later. Plants use different pathways to regulate internal hormone quantities and moderate their effects; they can regulate the amount of chemicals used to biosynthesize hormones. [...] They can <b>store</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> cells, inactivate them, or cannibalise already-formed hormones by conjugating them with carbohydrates, amino acids, or peptides. Plants can also break down hormones chemically, effectively destroying them. Plant hormones frequently regulate the concentrations of other plant hormones. Plants also move hormones around the plant diluting their concentrations.|$|E
