5|$|NATO's 2004 Istanbul summit {{was also}} remarkably {{silent on the}} subject of nuclear weapons policy and non-proliferation, as opposed to pre-summit {{diplomacy}} and earlier post-Cold War NATO summits and contrary to the demonstrations going on in Istanbul. In June 2004, shortly before the summit, NATO issued two fact sheets on nuclear policy, portraying the developments within NATO in a favourable light in the run up to the 2005 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference. In practice, no real changes {{since the end of the}} Cold War were implemented, as since the 1994 US Nuclear posture review the number of US nuclear weapons based in Europe remained unchanged, and as Cold War nuclear sharing arrangements dating back to the 1960s remained in force. Additionally, no changes were made to Alliance nuclear policy since the 1999 <b>Strategic</b> <b>Concept.</b>|$|E
5|$|The US, the UK, {{and most}} other NATO {{countries}} opposed efforts to require the U.N.

Recognizing the post-Cold War military environment, NATO adopted the Alliance <b>Strategic</b> <b>Concept</b> during its Washington summit in April 1999 that emphasized conflict prevention and crisis management.|$|E

5|$|Comprehensive Political Guidance (CPG), {{a policy}} {{document}} {{that had been}} agreed by Defence Ministers in June 2006 and an addition to the 1999 <b>Strategic</b> <b>Concept</b> document, was formally endorsed during the summit. The CPG intends to provide a framework and political direction for NATO's continuing transformation in the coming 10 to 15 years. More specifically, the document expresses {{the belief that the}} principal threats to the Alliance in the coming decades are terrorism, proliferation, failing states, regional crises, misuse of new technologies, and disruption of the flow of vital resources. According to this document, the Alliance should adapt to these new threats and sets out the Alliance vis-a-vis capability issues, planning disciplines and intelligence for the next 10 to 15 years, including among others the need for joint expeditionary forces and the capability to deploy and sustain them over long periods of time. The document further underlined that NATO's forces should be able to conduct a variety of missions, from high to low intensity, and emphasized the likelihood that NATO will need to carry out a greater number and range of smaller operations. The CPG also confirmed the principle that 40% of the member states' military forces must be redeployable, and 8% must constantly be on operations abroad. This principle makes it, among other things, possible to effectively compare the contributions made by various states, irrespective of the size of their populations.|$|E

Based on Michael Codner’s theory of interoperability, this essay’s aim is to investigate if the Swedish and the Finnish currently are interoperable with each other, due to their military <b>strategic</b> <b>concepts.</b> According to Codner, similarities between the cooperating nation’s military <b>strategic</b> <b>concepts</b> are required in order to reach a high degree of interoperability. This essay will analyze and compare Sweden and Finland’s military <b>strategic</b> <b>concepts,</b> based on three categories; Global Projection, Territorial Defence and Combat Capability. The conclusion is that there are differences between the Swedish and the Finnish military <b>strategic</b> <b>concepts</b> in every category, of varying degrees.

25|$|The first large {{expedition}} to the North was undertaken in 1779 by French Vice Admiral d'Estaing. In the attempt to invade the British-occupied Savannah, the French brought 20 ships-of-the-line and 3,000 troops in transports to Georgia. Although Washington failed to cooperate with his allies, being fixated on attacking the British in New York City, D'Estaing landed the troops in aid to the Americans before he returned to France, {{as he had been}} ordered to do. On 9 October 1779, in concert with a contingent of the Continental Army, the French admiral initiated an assault on the besieged city. The well-fortified British army repulsed the invaders; d'Estaing was seriously wounded and had to sail for Europe. Despite a correct <b>strategic</b> <b>concept,</b> allied cooperation eluded successful operational implementation.|$|E
25|$|The Portuguese {{alliance}} began {{a new era}} {{in political}} and commercial relations with England. However, of more immediate benefit to the Allies was the port of Lisbon, which would provide year round naval access to the Mediterranean, as well as support from the Portuguese army to fight for the Grand Alliance in Spain. As part of the agreement Peter II had demanded that Archduke Charles be sent in person to Portugal. In the King's estimation the presence of the Archduke would help facilitate an anti-Bourbon rising in Spain, but it would also guarantee that the Allies would not leave him in the lurch once he had forfeited his French alliance. To Queen Anne's ministers replacing the Duke of Anjou with Archduke Charles appeared a good way to break Spain's trade monopoly in its colonial empire, knowing that Habsburg control over Spanish America was in England's commercial interest; moreover, it satisfied the Grand <b>Strategic</b> <b>concept</b> of pressing Louis XIV across multiple fonts. However, the agreement also meant the Allies were now committed to a war to secure the whole Spanish inheritance for the Austrian Habsburgs. At first the Emperor had been hesitant as his immediate goals were in Italy not Spain. Nevertheless, it was the weight of English gold and diplomacy which prevailed, and on 12 September 1703 Archduke Charles was crowned Charles III of Spain in Vienna. He arrived in Lisbon, via London, in early March 1704.|$|E
500|$|The CPG policy {{document}} {{is regarded as}} self-contradictory {{for at least two}} reasons. Firstly, it identified the two greatest threats to NATO as terrorism and the {{proliferation of weapons of mass}} destruction (WMD), whilst simultaneously reaffirming the 1999 <b>Strategic</b> <b>Concept</b> as [...] "remaining valid" [...] despite the fact that it barely mentioned these threats. Secondly, the document states that collective defence remains the core purpose of NATO, but at the same time emphasizes potential NATO contributions to conflict prevention and crisis management, and the potential planning and management of missions like that in Afghanistan. The Riga Declaration even described the capability for such missions as NATO's [...] "top priority". Additionally, Jaap de Hoop Scheffer wanted and expected a new <b>Strategic</b> <b>Concept</b> to be debated and agreed upon by 2008, reinforcing already existing views that the CPG will most likely last much less than the 10 to 15 years as the guiding {{policy document}}.|$|E

2500|$|On 21 September 1939, Hans Jeschonnek, the Luftwaffes Chief of Staff, {{clarified}} {{the role}} of the day fighter force in the defence of German territory.

However, all other fighter units would be organised under one of several Luftflotten (Air Fleets), which would prosecute the defence of German targets in a manner [...] "linked directly with the <b>strategic</b> <b>concept</b> for the continued conduct of the air war".

2500|$|Felt {{strongly}} opposed deploying American soldiers into Vietnam. In internal administration debates, {{he warned that}} the proposed American intervention lacked a sound <b>strategic</b> <b>concept</b> and [...] "would commit the U.S. to another Korea-type support and assistance situation" [...] from which [...] "we can't pull out at will without damaging repercussions." [...] In a conference with General Maxwell D. Taylor, military representative to President John F. Kennedy, Felt stressed that introducing U.S. troops into Indochina would be perceived throughout Asia as the reintroduction of white colonialism into Vietnam, would provoke intensified Communist aggression, and would entangle U.S. soldiers in military engagement with the Viet Cong. In early 1962, Felt presciently predicted that Viet Cong forces would seek [...] "a prolonged form of attritional warfare" [...] that could not [...] "be defeated by purely military means."

2500|$|The next year, NATO {{conducted}} a follow-up exercise, Operation Mariner, from September 16 to October 4, 1953.

After the exercise, McCormick told a dinner of the American Council on NATO on October 29, 1953, that the Kremlin was [...] "well aware" [...] {{of the importance of}} the transatlantic sea lane and was readying submarines to fight another possible Battle of the Atlantic. While Operation Mariner had demonstrated that NATO could control the Atlantic given sufficient forces, he warned, [...] "The forces we have available at present to counter the potential underseas menace would be spread precariously thin for this task." ...|$|E
