40|$|Abstract — Three <b>test</b> <b>circuits</b> {{have been}} {{developed}} to experimentally demonstrate and stress the state-of-the-art in 3 -D integrated systems. Several critical elements of this emerging technology, synchronization, power delivery, and thermal management, are just beginning to be explored. The three <b>test</b> <b>circuits</b> explore these three fundamental design issues. The first <b>test</b> <b>circuit</b> examines multi-plane synchronization for a stacked system of three device planes. Experimental data compare skew, slew, and power consumption for different network topologies. The second <b>test</b> <b>circuit</b> examines power delivery in a three plane 3 -D system. The noise propagation characteristics within the power and ground networks are experimentally assessed by varying the through-silicon via (TSV) density and using dedicated planes. The third 3 -D circuit includes five CMOS planes, two logic planes and three memory planes, and includes multiple circuits that examine a range of 3 -D design issues. The test structures are designed to evaluate thermal coupling between CMOS device planes and decoupling capacitance in 3 -D power delivery networks. These <b>test</b> <b>circuits</b> are discussed, and trends and challenges are outlined. Index Terms — 3 -D integration, clock distribution, noise propagation, power distribution, thermal coupling, decoupling capacitor placement. I...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — We {{propose a}} method of {{correlating}} circuit performance with technology fluctuations during the circuit-design phase. The method employs <b>test</b> <b>circuits</b> sensitive for technology fluctuations and a circuit simulation model which enables to interpret the correlation. We validate our proposal with a cascode-current-source <b>test</b> <b>circuit</b> and the driftdiffusion MOSFET model HiSIM. The chosen <b>test</b> <b>circuit</b> allows to separate intra-chip and inter-chip technology fluctuations and to correlate these fluctuations with circuit-performance fluctuations. One important result is that intra-chip fluctuations increase faster than inter-chip fluctuations with decreasing gate length. Quantitative modeling with HiSIM reveals random fluctuation of the effective gate length as the most likely origin for these findings. I...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this project is to construct and operate an integrated <b>test</b> <b>circuit</b> for the Molten-Caustic-Leaching (Gravimelt) process for desulfurization and demineralization of coal to prove process economics assumptions, deliver product coal and to test process conditions aimed at significantly lowering costs. The <b>test</b> <b>circuit</b> consists of six unit operations which together provide a continuous system for leaching coal and regenerating the reactant. These units are: (a) a kiln for reacting molten caustic with coal; (b) a seven stage water washing section for recovering caustic from the coal; (c) a three-stage acid washing section for removing the last traces of metals and alkali and providing an ultra pure coal product; (d) a water treatment section to provide either dischargeable or recyclable water; (e) a regeneration section to provide purified aqueous caustic; and (f) an evaporator section to provide molten-caustic for recycle to the kiln reactor.

40|$|Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) is {{an issue}} that has rapidly {{increased}} in importance in recent years, driven by legal, and commercial demands. The EMC compliance requires the implementation of a total EMC approach to the development of electric and electronic circuitry such as in product manufacturing, with compliance being {{an integral part of the}} product life-cycle. Radiated emission test is one of the EMC criteria with a purpose to ensure that other products are protected from the emissions generated by it. TIns project is focused on the contribution of Differential Mode Current (Id) and Common Mode Current (Ie), that occur in electric and electronic circuitry which definitely affects the overall radiated emissions level. A standard <b>test</b> <b>circuit</b> was designed and implemented as the reference circuit. Several of the <b>test</b> <b>circuits</b> were designed and developed using appropriate layout design techniques such as loop area control and appropriate grounding techniques to ensure signal quality and functional performances due to EMC. The value of Id exhibited significantly much higher values than Ie for frequency ranges between 30 MHz to 1000 MHz throughout all the measurements. Despite the significantly different values between Id and Ie, the total radiated emissions over the frequency ranges exhibited consistent results. This indicate that although the values of Ie were noticeably lower than Id, Ie still dominated the radiated emission in electric and electronic circuitry. The effects of loop area and grounding techniques on radiated emission were also studied. There was a 0. 3 % of reduction regarding loop area technique using double-sided PCB compared to the standard <b>test</b> <b>circuit.</b> The average value of radiated emission produced by the <b>test</b> <b>circuit</b> due to Id exhibited a reduction of 3. 42 % from the standard <b>test</b> <b>circuit,</b> while the average value of radiated emission produced by the <b>test</b> <b>circuit</b> due to Ie exhibited a reduction of 2. 17 % from the standard <b>test</b> <b>circuit.</b> Future work should focus on improving the circuit design and development using multilayer PCB for optimal performance. Furthermore, effort can also be made on expanding the circuit design by implementing noisy sources such relays and motors, and improve the circuit with higher density and more traces...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The impacts {{caused by}} {{board-level}} charged-device-model (CDM) electrostatic-discharge (ESD) events on integrated-circuit products are investigated in this paper. The mechanism of board-level CDM ESD event is introduced first. Based on this mechanism, an experiment is performed {{to investigate the}} board-level CDM ESD current waveforms under different sizes of printed circuit boards (PCBs), charged voltages, and series resistances in the discharging path. Experimental {{results show that the}} discharging current strongly depends on the PCB size, charged voltage, and series resistance. Moreover, the chip- and board-level CDM ESD levels of several test devices and <b>test</b> <b>circuits</b> fabricated in CMOS processes are characterized and compared. The test results show that the board-level CDM ESD level of the <b>test</b> <b>circuit</b> is lower than the chip-level CDM ESD level of the <b>test</b> <b>circuit,</b> which demonstrates that the board-level CDM ESD event is more critical than the chip-level CDM ESD event. In addition, failure analysis reveals that the failure in the <b>test</b> <b>circuit</b> under board-level CDM ESD test is much severer than that under chip-level CDM ESD test.
