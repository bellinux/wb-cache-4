In viscoplastic materials, relaxation tests demonstrate the stress relaxation in uniaxial loading at a constant strain. In fact, these tests characterize the viscosity and can be used to determine the relation which exists between the stress and the rate of viscoplastic strain.

40|$|The {{changes in}} {{viscoelastic}} properties of potatoes (Tubuls Agria) stored at 4 ˚C for 4 months were modeled and evaluated {{by using the}} creep-recovery test. Cylindrical specimens with 15 mm in diameter and 35 mm long were used. The samples were allowed to deform gradually under the constant stress (110 kPa) for about 30 min. After removing the load, the sample recovery was registered. Deformation of the specimens with time were measured and recorded. <b>Strain-time</b> <b>curve</b> was plotted for loading and recovery process. Four-element (Burgers) mechanical model adequately described the creep response of the potato tissue. The coefficients of instantaneous elasticity, elastic and viscous coefficients of the retarded elastic part, Newtonian viscous flow and retardation time were determined, {{as they can be}} used to study the effect of storage conditions {{on the quality of the}} stored potatoes. These values were decreased significantly (...|$|E
40|$|The use {{of digital}} volume {{correlation}} (DVC) {{in combination with}} a laboratory x-ray computed tomography (CT) for full-field internal 3 D deformation measurement of opaque materials has flourished in recent years. During x-ray tomographic imaging, the heat generated by the x-ray tube changes the imaging geometry of x-ray scanner, and further introduces noticeable errors in DVC measurements. In this work, to provide practical guidance high-accuracy DVC measurement, the errors in displacements and strains measured by DVC due to the self-heating for effect of a commercially available x-ray scanner were experimentally investigated. The errors were characterized by performing simple rescan tests with different scan durations. The {{results indicate that the}} maximum strain errors associated with the self-heating of the x-ray scanner exceed 400 µε. Possible approaches for minimizing or correcting these displacement and strain errors are discussed. Finally, a series of translation and uniaxial compression tests were performed, in which strain errors were detected and then removed using pre-established artificial dilatational <b>strain-time</b> <b>curve.</b> Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy and accuracy of the proposed strain error correction approach...|$|E
40|$|Compression creep {{tests were}} {{performed}} on the ternary 91. 84 Sn- 3. 33 Ag- 4. 83 Bi (wt. %, abbreviated Sn-Ag-Bi) Pb-free alloy. The test temperatures were: &# 8722; 25 &# 176;C, 25 &# 176;C, 75 &# 176;C, 125 &# 176;C, and 160 &# 176;C (&# 177; 0. 5 &# 176;C). Four loads were used at the two lowest temperatures and five at the higher temperatures. The specimens were tested in the as-fabricated condition or after having been subjected {{to one of two}} air aging conditions: 24 hours at either 125 &# 176;C or 150 &# 176;C. The <b>strain-time</b> <b>curves</b> exhibited frequent occurrences of negative creep and small-scale fluctuations, particularly at the slower strain rates, that were indicative of dynamic recrystallization (DRX) activity. The source of tertiary creep behavior at faster strain rates was likely to also be DRX rather than a damage accumulation mechanism. Overall, the <b>strain-time</b> <b>curves</b> did not display a consistent trend that could be directly attributed to the aging condition. The sinh law equation satisfactorily represented the minimum strain rate as a function of stress and temperature so as to investigate the deformation rate kinetics: d&# 949;/dtmin = Asinhn (&# 945;&# 963;) exp (&# 8722;&# 916;H/RT). The values of &# 945;, n, and &# 160;&# 916;H were in the following ranges (&# 177; 95 % confidence interval) : &# 945;, 0. 010 &# 8211; 0. 015 (&# 177; 0. 005 1 /MPa); n, 2. 2 &# 8211; 3. 1 (&# 177; 0. 5); and &# 916;H, 54 &# 8211; 66 (&# 177; 8 kJ/mol). The rate kinetics analysis indicated that short-circuit diffusion was a contributing mechanism to dislocation motion during creep. The rate kinetics analysis also determined that a minimum creep rate trend could not be developed between the as-fabricated versus aged conditions. This study showed that the elevated temperature aging treatments introduced multiple changes to the Sn-Ag-Bi microstructure that did not result in a simple loss (&# 8220;softening&# 8221;) of its mechanical strength...|$|R
40|$|AbstractCyclic creep (CC) {{tests were}} {{performed}} with the magnitudes of the stress range of constant stress ratio (R= 0. 1) under continuous tension-tension loading cycles at a hold time of 10 minute at 600 oC for normalized and tempered modified 9 Cr- 1 Mo steel. Cyclic <b>strain-time</b> <b>curves</b> {{were obtained from the}} controlled cyclic creep tests, and the cyclic creep behavior was investigated and compared with the static creep (SC) behavior. In the present test conditions, the results of creep rupture time and creep rate showed retardation behaviour when compared with those of the static creep. Creep rupture ductility decreased with a decrease in stress, and the ductility was almost the same for the CC and SC. In the fracture micrographs, the CC showed typical ductile fracture preceded by many dimples which occurred in the equi-axed core. The dimple size and area decreased with a decrease in the stress ranges. The precipitates formed in the CC test specimens were more coarsened than those in CC ones...|$|R
40|$|The constant-stress {{behaviour}} of {{low-density polyethylene}} toughened polystyrene has been analysed. It {{was found that}} the initial strain-time behaviour during constant-stress tensile tests is well described by a simple model that predicts a proportionality between strain and the square of time, provided a correction for craze formation during the application of stress is made. By analysing <b>strain-time</b> <b>curves</b> at different stresses it has been determined that the product of the rates of craze initiation and of craze growth is exponentially dependent on stress. The attainment of a constant strain rate during constant-stress experiments and the attainment of a constant-stress level during constant strain-rate experiments result from a strong decrease in the rate of craze initiation. This effect allowed the determination of the stress and temperature dependences of the rate of craze growth. This rate was found to be well described by the Eyring equation, which is in agreement with earlier results obtained from constant stress- and strain-rate experiments...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the results of an experimental investigation of the yielding phenomenon during the transition from elastic to plastic behavior in 3 per cent silicon-iron alloy. Static load tests, constant strain-rate tests and square wave rapid loading tests were conducted on single crystal. and polycrystalline specimens {{in order to determine the}} dislocation configurations at various stages in the yielding process. An electrolytic etching technique was used to reveal dislocation intersections with the observation surface. Grain boundaries were found to be the primary source of dislocations for slip band formation in fully annealed material. The velocity of mobile dislocations was found to be an extremely sensitive function of the applied stress. A true static upper yield point was found to be consistent with theories of the upper yield point based upon dislocation kinetics. The delay-time for yielding at constant applied stress was found to depend upon the dynamics of dislocation motion, the anisotropic stress concentration, the stress concentration due to relaxation of individual grains and the Schmid factor of the least favorably oriented grains. Dislocation dynamics and dislocation configurations at various stages of plastic deformation were capable of accounting for a true upper yield point, the shape of the <b>strain-time</b> <b>curve</b> at constant stress and the Luder's band propagation velocity in polycrystalline specimens...|$|E

Both vertical deformation and pore pressure were measured during primary consolidation, which refers to the time-dependent compression process associated with the dissipation of pore pressure. The pore pressure changes were investigated by considering the maximum and the residual values. The development of compression during pore pressure dissipation was analysed to identify the change patterns in volumetric <b>strain-time</b> <b>curves.</b> Three types of change patterns were found during the primary consolidation, and the remoulded yield stress {{was found to be}} the key factor in classifying the change patterns. The inflexion point is absent for types 1 and 2, indicating that the end of primary consolidation cannot be determined by the commonly used Taylor and Casagrande methods. Type 3 shows an inverse 'S' shape, suggesting that the end of primary consolidation determined based on the compression-time curves occurs before the completion of pore pressure dissipation...|$|R
40|$|Rheological {{characteristics}} {{are one of}} most important properties needed {{to be considered for}} the designing and construction for the long term stability and serviceability of underground structures in the rock mass. Up to date, although extensive studies on the rheological properties of rocks are available in the literature, most of existing studies reported the strain-time data for the axial deformation through compression rheological method and did not mention the lateral deformation, and mainly focused on the soft rocks at shallow depth. Thus, very limited {{attention has been paid to}} the rheological properties of deep and hard rock, neglecting the effects of structural anisotropy on the rheological properties. This paper presents a comprehensive in-depth study on the rheological behaviours of super-deep hard rock considering the effects of structural anisotropy by using the uniaxial and biaxial creep tests. The results revealed that significant creep behaviour can be observed in the hard rock specimens under high stress in the in-situ conditions, and the strain-time behaviour of hard rock exhibited brittle failure. The <b>strain-time</b> <b>curves</b> of hard rock exhibited two obvious phases of instantaneous creep and steady state creep without the phase of accelerated creep. Moreover, it was observed that the rheological behaviours, including the instantaneous modulus, transient creep duration, axial and lateral creep deformations, steady state creep rate, volumetric strain and contraction ratio are strongly affected by the structural anisotropy. Based on the experimental data, empirical models of the parameters governing creep behaviour have been established...|$|R
40|$|The Petroleum Safety Authority of Norway (PSA) has now {{acknowledged}} {{the use of}} shale as an annular barrier for permanent plug and abandonment (PP&A) operations in the oil industry. Shale can exhibit a natural self-sealing effect; a result from delayed deformation of the rock. It is believed that creep in combination with consolidation plays important roles in the process when shale closes in and forms a tight barrier around a well. For using shale as a permanent annular barrier {{it is important to}} comprehend how these time-dependent mechanisms are affected by externally induced parameters, like stress, temperature and chemical alterations of the pore fluid. The purpose of this master thesis is to investigate creep characteristics and consolidation effects in Pierre shale. Two literature studies have been completed and several laboratory experiments have been carried out on small size core plugs drilled normal to the bedding plane. Axial <b>strain-time</b> <b>curves</b> have been obtained by performing uniaxial compression tests with step loading at a temperature around 30 oC. The main objectives have been to identify how the creep and consolidation processes are affected by different stress levels and variations in the pore fluid pH. Eventually, the laboratory work resulted in four successful creep experiments. The obtained data showed that Pierre shale exhibits considerable time-dependent deformation in response to applied stress. Changing the stress conditions affected the amount of deformation in periods with constant stress and it appeared like the shale demonstrated different creep behavior before and after a certain test dependent stress level. It was also seen that the temperature variation increased with extended test time for the conducted experiments and the experimental results implied that p-wave velocities are related to strain as well as stress. In addition, the creep tests indicated a correlation between p-wave velocities and temperature. Finally, {{it was found that the}} pH value of the pore fluid had an impact on consolidation and creep properties. A lower pH value reduced the overall stiffness and strength of the samples, resulting in more consolidation. More creep deformation and increased creep rates were seen compared to a near-neutral pH environment...|$|R
