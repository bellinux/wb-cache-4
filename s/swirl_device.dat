40|$|Purpose - One current {{trend in}} burner {{technology}} is to obtain high efficiency while keeping {{low levels of}} NOx emissions. A swirling flow in combustion ensures a fixed position of a compact flame. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} design efficient swirlers. Flow patterns are simulated for the different <b>swirl</b> <b>devices</b> proposed in this work. Two axial-swirlers are studied: one based on curve-vanes consisting of a straight line with an arc of a circle as the trailing edge and the other is the common flat-vanes. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to assess the accuracy of different swirl generators using a well-known benchmark test case. Design/methodology/approach - This work deals with modelling the swirler using two approaches: the general purpose Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solver Ansys-Fluent (R) and the suite of libraries OpenFOAM (R) to solve the Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes equations, showing there is a slight deviation between both approaches. Their performance involves analyzing not only the Swirl number but also the size of the recirculation zones in the test chamber. A subsequent process on the flow patterns was carried out to establish the intensity of segregation which provides insight into the quality of mixing. Findings - CFD models are feasible tools to predict flow features. It was found that numerical results tend to reduce the inner recirculation zone (IRZ) radial size. Further, an increase of the swirl number involves larger IRZ and a smaller outer recirculation zone (ORZ). The curved swirler displays a better axi-symmetric behaviour than flat vanes. There is weak influence of the chord vanes on the swirl number. The number of vanes is a compromise of head loses and guidance of the flow. Originality/value - The paper offers two different approaches to solve turbulent swirling flows. One based in a general contrasted commercial tool and other using open source code.

The increasing demand for more efficient heat transfer fluids in many applications has been led to enhance heat transfer to meet the cooling challenge necessary. Nanofluid is a relatively new engineering material consisting of the nanometre-sized additives and base fluids, has gained extensive attention due to its role in improving the efficiency of thermal systems. Although, there are many studies of nanofluids with different types of base fluid such as water, Ethylene glycol (EG) and Propylene glycol (PG), there are very limited studies of using nanofluids with BioGlycol as a base fluid. While, BioGlycol (BG) showed more advantages compared to water Ethylene glycol (EG) and Propylene glycol (PG), for instance, a much lower freezing point and higher boiling point than water, provided lower viscosity compared to Propylene glycol (PG) and Ethylene glycol (EG), has greater thermal stability while possessing similar or better thermophysical properties compared to Propylene and Ethylene glycols and non-toxic renewable sourced fluid.

40|$|Understanding how swirl flows can {{be applied}} to {{processes}} in {{the oil and gas industry}} and how problems might hinder them, are the focus of this thesis. Three application areas were identified: wet gas metering, liquid loading in gas wells and erosion at pipe bends due to sand transport. For all three areas, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations were performed. Where available, experimental data were used to validate the CFD results. As a part of this project, a new test loop was conceived for the investigation of sand erosion in pipes. The results obtained from CFD simulations of two-phase (air-water) flow through a pipe with a swirl-inducing device show that generating swirl flow leads to separation of the phases and creates distinct flow patterns within the pipe. This effect can be used in each of the three application areas of interest. For the wet gas metering application, a chart was generated, which suggests the location of maximum liquid deposition downstream of the <b>swirling</b> <b>device</b> used in the ANUMET meter. This will allow taking pressure and phase fraction measurements (from which the liquid flow rate can be determined) where they are most representative of the flow pattern assumed for the ANUMET calculation algorithms. For the liquid loading application, which was taken as an upscaling of the dimensions investigated for the wet gas metering application, the main focus was on the liquid hold-up. This parameter is defined as the ratio of the flowing area occupied by liquid to the total area. Results obtained with CFD simulations showed that as the water rate increases, the liquid hold-up increases, implying a more effective liquid removal. Thus, it was concluded that the introduction of a swirler can help unload liquid from a gas well, although no investigation was carried out on the persistance of the swirl motion downstream of the device. For the third and final application, the erosion at pipe bends due to sand transport, the main focus was to check the erosion rate on the pipe wall with and without the introduction of a swirler. The erosion rate was predicted by CFD simulations. The flow that was investigated consisted of a liquid phase with solid particles suspended in it. The CFD results showed a significant reduction in erosion rate at the pipe walls when the swirler was introduced, which could translate into an extended working life for the pipe. An extensive literature review performed on this topic, complemented by the CFD simulations, showed the need for a dedicated multiphase test loop for the investigation of sand erosion in horizontal pipes and at bends. The design of a facility of this type is included in this thesis. The results obtained with this work are very encouraging and provide a broad perspective of applications of swirl flows and CFD for the oil and gas industry...|$|R

The dual nature of semi-solid materials results in a marked decrease in internal defects otherwise associated with conventional casting methods. In recent years, the National Research Council Canada - Aluminum Technology Centre (NRC-ATC) has dedicated itself to better understanding the behaviour of semi-solid aluminum alloys, notably 357, using the SEED (<b>Swirled</b> Enthalpy Equilibration <b>Device)</b> rheocasting method. SEED is a novel process which relies on the mechanical agitation and cooling of molten aluminum to produce a semi-solid billet.

40|$|Cast {{aluminum}} alloys have witnessed a notable increase {{in use in}} the automotive and transport industry {{by virtue of their}} mechanical properties. The ability of these alloys to be easily cast into complex shapes coupled with a favourable strength-to-weight ratio has given them an edge over cast irons. Cast 319 alloys, for example, are heavily used in the fabrication of engine blocks. The addition of copper in these alloys aids in maintaining high mechanical properties in service, at temperatures of more than 2000 C. One particular area of casting which has received further and further attention is the area of semi-solid casting, where an alloy casting is prepared as a slurry with flow properties that resemble both solid and liquid. In the present work, the effects of iron additions and heat treatment to the mechanical properties of a 319 semi-solid alloy were studied. This alloy was prepared using the SEED process, developed by Rio Tinto Alcan (RTA) in collaboration with the Aluminium Technology Centre (ATC) of NRC Canada. The SEED (<b>Swirled</b> Enthalpy Equilibration <b>Device)</b> process is a novel rheocasting method which yields a semi-solid slurry from the mechanical stirring and cooling of the molten aluminum. The rheocasting process is characterized by very good mechanical properties owing to a globular microstructure, which was confirmed via optical and scanning electron microscopy. Typical values of peak stress and elongation recorded in this work were 350 MPa and 5...|$|R
40|$|This project {{involves}} {{implementing a}} new technology, microforming, in a headbox {{to produce an}} isotropic sheet with significant reductions in the MD/CD stiffness ratio (increasing CD specific STFI) and improved sheet uniformity. Microforming involves generating axial vorticity (i. e., swirl) prior to the converging nozzle of the headbox by retrofitting an existing tube block with <b>swirl</b> generation <b>devices</b> referred to as Vortigen system. The Vortigen system developed in this project is a retrofit technology to a hydraulic headbox tube block. The tubes in the tube block are re-designed to generate axial vorticity (or swirl) in the tubes. This type of flow results in higher intensity small-scale turbulence in the forming jet at the slice. The net effect, as demonstrated in pilot and commercial trials, is improvement in formation and surface smoothness, lower MD/CD tensile ratio, and consequently, higher CD strength properties such as CD STFI, Ring Crush and tensile or breaking length. The objective of this project is to implement microforming by developing the retrofit technology for generation and on-line control of axial vorticity in the tubes to optimize turbulent scale and intensity, and consequently, fiber network structure properties in the sheet. This technology results in significant improvements in the performance and capital effectiveness of the paper machine (PM) {{for a fraction of}} the cost to replace a headbox. In this project we have developed and demonstrated the concept of generating axial vorticity to control the fiber orientation in the converging zone of the headbox, and to produce a sheet with isotropic fiber orientation. The technology developed here has been demonstrated in static form on several pilot trials and two series of commercial trials. The economic feasibility of this technology is based primarily on fiber savings in cases where a more isotropic fiber orientation can be used to reduce the basis weight of the product. Even a 5 % decrease in basis weight will results in substantial savings covering the cost of a commercial retrofit in 6 months or less in a medium size machine. The project also resulted in significant amount of information on fiber orientation in turbulent flow and in a converging nozzle where the results can be used in other applications, such as formation of composite materials. Several MS and Ph. D. students and postdoctoral associates have been trained as part of this project...|$|R
40|$|The {{automotive}} industry has leaned greatly towards {{the use of}} aluminum alloys {{by virtue of their}} strength and low density. Given this, the potential for aluminum use in the fabrication of vehicle parts has greatly increased. However, there are limited studies devoted to the improvement of the casting process. In the present work, the SEED (<b>Swirled</b> Enthalpy Equilibrium <b>Device)</b> rheocasting method, as developed by Rio Tinto Alcan in collaboration with the Aluminium Technology Center of NRC Canada (ATC-NRC), was analyzed by the authors in an attempt to optimize operating parameters (e. g. proper mold filling, slurry temperature, injection speed, etc.), which affect the final cast part quality. In many of the existing semi-solid casting processes which use billets as feedstock, for example, it is often found that the outer surface of the billets is contaminated. During the injection phase, a billet's external skin comes into contact with air and lubricant, and, as a result, becomes contaminated. The use of such a contaminated billet can often result in an increased rejection rate of cast parts. The SEED process, which uses heat extraction of the liquid aluminum alloy via mechanical agitation (swirling) in a confined cylinder to form the semi-solid billet on site, has already proven successful in producing sound aluminum castings having an excellent combination of strength and ductility. The resulting semi-solid billet, having a microstructure consisting of 3 ̆b 1 -Al globules surrounded by the eutectic phase, is then injected into the cold chamber of an HPDC machine.

40|$|Aluminum-silicon alloys {{represent}} {{a majority of}} cast alloys used in the automotive industry, as these alloys can be molded into complex shapes with relative ease. Cast aluminum-silicon-copper alloys, or 319 aluminum alloys, for example, are a popular choice in the fabrication of engine blocks. The addition of copper to Al-Si aids in maintaining the casting integrity when in service (with temperatures exceeding 2000 C (392 F)). Although numerous publications have explored the use of cast 319 alloys, there is still very little in terms of literature with respect to semi-solid cast 319 alloys. Semi-solid casting, where an alloy is prepared as a slurry, is fast becoming a popular casting method due to the dual liquid-solid nature of the resulting billet. The billet remains still, as if solid, yet flows under the action of an applied shear force. A semi-solid rheocast 319 aluminum alloy was prepared for this study using the SEED (<b>Swirled</b> Enthalpy Equilibration <b>Device)</b> casting method, as developed by Rio Tinto Alcan {{in collaboration with the}} Aluminium Technology Centre of NRC Canada. This process uses heat extraction of the liquid aluminum alloy via agitation (swirling) in a confined cylinder to form the semi-solid billet. The resulting microstructure consists of alpha aluminum globules surrounded by the eutectic phase. In this work, the iron content of the 319 semi-solid alloy was altered, and the changes in microstructure and mechanical properties were observed. The chief objective of this ongoing study is to use recycled aluminum (with iron traces) for future casting, as opposed to higher purity aluminum. The SEED process itself has proven successful in obtaining high integrity 356 / 357 castings, among others; therefore, it is also the authors' intent to develop SEED as a fully industrial process.

40|$|The high-turbulent {{swirling}} {{flows of}} heat carrier that {{are created by}} a cyclone chamber are used in industry. They {{make it possible to}} intensify processes of heat and mass exchange. The results of an experimental study of convective heat transfer on the lateral surface of the active volume of a relatively long cyclone chamber considerably exceeding the length of the chambers that were used in previously performed studies are presented and analyzed in the article. Air supply in the swirler of the chamber was performed tangentially from diametrically opposite sides of the two input channels. The gas outlet was implemented from the opposite end. The heat transfer by convection to the swirling air flow was studied by the method of changing the state of aggregation of a heating agent – condensation of slightly superheated steam. Collecting condensate from the working section was made through a water seal for maintaining a constant pressure calorimeter. The amount of heat transferred during experiment was determined by weight of the collected condensate. The specific features of influence of geometrical characteristics of cyclone chamber on intensity of heat exchange are considered. In the experiments we varied the relative diameter of the outlet port of the chamber d вых and the relative area of the input channels f вх. Segmental construction of the chamber made it possible to move a calorimeter on its length. The local heat transfer coefficient was determined for various values of the dimensionless longitudinal coordinate  z  coinciding with the axis of the chamber, and counted from the back end of the swirler. The estimated equations of heat transfer obtained during the research are presented and recommended for use in practice of engineering. The considered problem is of an interest {{from the point of view}} of further research of aerodynamics and of convective heat transfer in a highly <b>swirling</b> flow cyclone <b>devices,</b> in order to improve the methods of their thermal and aerodynamic calculations. </p...|$|R
40|$|Two novel {{turbomachinery}} {{concepts are}} presented as enablers to advanced flight missions requiring integrated airframe/propulsion systems. The first concept is motivated by thermal management challenges in low-to-high Mach number (4 +) aircraft. The idea of compressor cooling combines the compressor and heat exchanger function to stretch turbopropulsion system operational limits. Axial compressor performance with blade passage heat extraction is assessed with computational experiments and meanline modeling. A cooled multistage compressor with adiabatic design point is found to achieve higher pressure ratio, choking mass flow, and efficiency (referenced to an adiabatic, reversible process) at fixed corrected speed, with greatest benefit occurring through front-stage cooling. Heat removal equal to one percent of inlet stagnation enthalpy flux {{in each of the}} first four blade rows suggests pressure ratio, efficiency, and choked flow improvements of 23 %, 12 %, and 5 % relative to a baseline, eight-stage compressor with pressure ratio of 5. Cooling is also found to unchoke rear stages at low corrected speed. Heat transfer estimations indicate that surface area limitations and temperature differences favor rear-stage cooling and suggest the existence of an optimal cooling distribution. (cont.) The second concept is a quiet drag device to enable slow and steep approach profiles for functionally quiet civil aircraft. Deployment of such devices in clean airframe configuration reduces aircraft source noise and noise propagation to the ground. The generation of swirling outflow from a duct, such as an aircraft engine, is conceived to have high drag and low noise. The simplest configuration is a ram pressure driven duct with non-rotating swirl vanes, a so-called <b>swirl</b> tube. A <b>device</b> aerodynamic design is performed using first principles and CFD. The swirl-drag-noise relationship is quantified through scale-model aerodynamic and aeroacoustic wind tunnel tests. The maximum measured stable flow drag coefficient is 0. 83 at exit swirl angles close to 500. The acoustic signature, extrapolated to full-scale, is found to be well below the background noise of a well populated area, demonstrating swirl tube conceptual feasibility. Vortex breakdown is found to be the aerodynamically and acoustically limiting physical phenomenon, generating a white-noise signature that is [approx. ] 15 dB louder than a stable swirling flow. by Parthiv Narendra Shah.
