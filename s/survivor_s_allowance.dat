40|$|A {{striking}} {{characteristic of}} Brigham Young 2 ̆ 7 s theology was his {{inclusion of a}} cosmology in his teachings. In his speeches as President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Young juxtaposed cosmological pronouncements with practical advice. Young regularly opined on such topics as the eternal nature of matter and light and the interaction of gods and humans with these substances. Dovetailed to his cosmic musings was down-to-earth advice on raising children, avoiding the evils of the gold rush, and controlling one 2 ̆ 7 s temper. This paper argues that Young 2 ̆ 7 s mingling of the abstruse with the mundane functioned as a theodicy for the nineteenth-century Mormons. In order to justify an omnipotent God 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>allowance</b> of Mormon suffering and persecution, Young framed God and the human experience within a cosmology. He taught that humans exist with {{the express purpose of}} accumulating light and truth. This accumulation would continue after death throughout eternity. Young taught that an ineluctable factor in this progression was suffering and for this reason, Young condoned God 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>allowance</b> of Mormon hardship. By weaving these cosmological teachings with his pragmatic counsel, Young taught the Latter-day Saints to view their daily lives [...] full of struggles, pain, and fear [...] within a cosmological framework.

40|$|PURPOSE: The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the postoperative levels of classical or pure MELD and changes in lactate or base excess (BE) levels as possible predictive factors of the type of outcome of patients submitted to orthotopic liver trasplantation (OLT). METHODS: The study was conducted on 60 patients submitted to OLT at the University Hospital, Faculty of Medicine of Ribeirão Preto, USP, between October 2008 and March 2012. The 30 latest <b>survivor</b> (<b>S)</b> and non-survivor (NS) cases were selected. All liver transplants were performed using the piggy-back technique. ALT, AST, BE and blood lactate values were determined for each group at five time points (immediate preoperative period, end of hypothermal ischemia, 5 and 60 minutes after arterial revascularization and in the immediate postoperative period, when the postoperative MELD was also calculated. RESULTS: The aminotransferases reached a maximum increase 24 hours after surgery in both the S and NS groups. There was a significantly higher increase in BE and blood lactate in the NS group, especially after 5 minutes of afterial reperfusion of the graft, p 0. 05), while the postoperative MELD was higher in the NS than in the S group (p< 0. 05) CONCLUSION: Joint analysis of postoperative MELD, BE and blood lactate can be used as an index of severity of the postoperative course of patients submitted to liver transplantation...|$|R

40|$|Currently, {{debates about}} the merits of {{one form or another}} of day care {{frequently}} miss some significant issues and hence some of the important policy options may be ruled out or in for the wrong reasons. Here, child day care is layed on a spectrum one end of which offers maximum market freedom in the form of income redistribution, a negative income tax, children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>allowance,</b> or other transfer assistance, to be spent on the market if so desired for day care services, and {{on the other end of}} the spectrum a system of comprehensive child day care centers. In between are various mixtures of the two and various special blends like voucher systems. Hopefully, by so arraying the issues and discussing them certain similarities between antipoverty and child care policy become evident and certain problems of transfers in cash or provision in kind can be clarified. Various day care policy options are discussed in relationship to assumptions that they make about cost, theories of child development, definitions of universality, the preference of parents, returns to scale, economic rationality, market responsiveness, quality, consumer democracy, and citizen control. Finally three central issues which lie outside of this analysis, freedom, political environment, and the target group to whom day care should be directed are discussed. In this discussion the point is made that day care is best conceived of as directed toward mothers not toward children or families. It is the mother who is most in need of the benefit of day care policy most of the time and to whom reasonable policy of day care should be directed. This consideration quite alters what seem fairly reasonable conclusions in favor of market day care in favor of day care by voucher or by direct service...|$|R

40|$|During {{the last}} 10 years, much {{emphasis}} {{has been placed}} on the importance of breakfast for people of all ages. Nutritionists have pointed out that persons who eat a hearty breakfast show fewer signs of mid-morning fatigue, have or develop better work habits, and do not get as hungry as those who eat little or no breakfast. Many people do not realize the importance of starting the day with a good breakfast. The 12 to 13 hour fast which the body undergoes from the evening meal until breakfast time requires the consumption of an adequate breakfast. Many poor breakfasts may be attributed to either failure {{to take the time to}} eat, or to not understanding the necessity of an adequate breakfast. Nationwide surveys report that a large number of adolescents and adults fail to receive the recommended 1 / 4 to 1 / 3 of their caloric and nutrient needs at breakfast. A basic breakfast pattern has been developed to aid in planning an adequate breakfast that will supply 1 / 4 to 1 / 3 of the calories and other nutrients needed each day. It includes fruit, cereal and/or egg, milk, bread and butter, yet it allows for a wide variation in menus. it is economical and can be easy to prepare. A breakfast of these foods insures one of less morning fatigue and better feeling during the morning and all day long. Studies show that breakfast is the most frequently missed meal. Many of the subjects who did not eat breakfast had a total day 2 ̆ 7 s intake that was classified as poor. Eating two meals a day failed to make up for the deficiency in nutrients. Breakfast consumption shows a direct relationship to the diet score, proof of the fact omitting breakfast is a poor start for the day. At the ages when an individual needs a larger intake of calories and nutrients, many times there is an actual decrease in the intake of nutritions food. The adolescents are noted for this inverse relationship between their nutritive needs and their actual intake. Galloway and Wilcox (1954), in a Utah study of school children, found that the breakfast meal did not furnish the recommended 1 / 4 to 1 / 3 of the day 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>allowance</b> of calories and many of the other nutrients. The noon and evening meals furnished a larger percentage of most nutrients to their diets. The number of children in the study by Galloway, et al., (1954) was somewhat limited.

40|$|Since the 1990 s, {{governmental}} agencies have increasingly turned to market based {{cap and trade}} programs to control the emission of pollutants. Firms subject to cap and trade regulation are typically required to acquire emissions allowances via open auction markets. The cost to acquire allowances may impose a substantial financial burden on a firm. While emissions reduction efforts may eliminate some firm 2 ̆ 7 s need to acquire additional allowances, there are still numerous firms that need to purchase additional allowances on the open market. This study presents a new forward buying heuristic, designed for those firms that need to purchase emissions allowances via auctions, which reduces the impact of emissions allowance acquisitions on the firms 2 ̆ 7 financial performance. The heuristic, designated as the Newsvendor Production Planning with Emissions Allowance Forward Buying (NPPAFB) method, applies a forward buying algorithm {{to determine the number}} of periods for which to forward buy allowances, the current production order up to level, and the current and future emissions allowance requirements (which serves as the order up to level for allowance purchases). Additionally, NPPAFB also authorizes unused emissions allowances to be sold when market conditions are favorable. Compared against three existing production planning and allowance procurement strategies, a simulation exercise finds that the NPPAFB method significantly reduces a firm 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> emissions <b>allowance</b> expenditures. These results indicate that heuristic can be readily adopted by any firm that is required to procure emissions allowances via open markets in an effort to improve the firm 2 ̆ 7 s profitability...|$|R

The results for total fluorine indicate a slight, but steady, decrease of its volume mixing ratio with increasing altitude, around a mean stratospheric value of (1. 15 +/- 0. 12) ppbv. Both uncertainties correspond to one standard deviation. These mean springtime 1985 stratospheric budgets are commensurate with values reported for the tropospheric Cl and F concentrations in the early 1980 <b>s,</b> when <b>allowance</b> is made for the growth rates of their source gases at the ground and the time required for tropospheric air to be transported into the stratosphere. The results are discussed with emphasis on conservation of fluorine and chlorine and the partitioning among source, sink, and reservoir gases throughout the stratosphere. Peer reviewe...|$|R

Amplification of innate immune responses by endogenous danger-associatedmolecular patterns (DAMPs) promotes inflammation. The involvement of S 100 A 8 and S 100 A 9, DAMPs {{belonging to the}} S 100 calgranulin family, in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease is attracting an increasing amount of interest. S 100 A 8 and S 100 A 9 (also termed MRP 8 and MRP 14) preferentially form the S 100 A 8 /A 9 heterodimer (MRP 8 / 14 or calprotectin) and are constitutively expressed in myeloid cells. The levels of circulating S 100 A 8 /A 9 in humans strongly correlate to blood neutrophil counts and are increased by traditional cardiovascular risk factors such as smoking, obesity, hyperglycemia, and dyslipidemia. S 100 A 8 /A 9 is an endogenous ligand of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR 4) and of the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) and {{has been shown to}} promote atherogenesis in mice. In humans, S 100 A 8 /A 9 correlates with the extent of coronary and carotid atherosclerosis and with a vulnerable plaque phenotype. S 100 A 8 /A 9 is locally released followingmyocardial infarction and amplifies the inflammatory responses associatedwithmyocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury. Elevated plasma levels of S 100 A 8 /A 9 are associated with increased risk of future coronary events in healthy individuals and in myocardial infarction <b>survivors.</b> Thus, <b>S</b> 100 A 8 /A 9 might represent a useful biomarker and therapeuti...|$|R

40|$|M. A. Incest can {{be defined}} as, “The {{involvement}} of dependant children or adolescents in sexual activities they do not truly comprehend, {{to which they are}} unable to give informed consent, or that violate the social taboos of family roles” (Kempe & Kempe, 1978, p. 60). Incest may include a multitude of activities, such as fondling, masturbation, exposing genitalia, exposure to pornographic material, as well as intercourse (Gilmartin, 1994). In our sexist patriarchal society, sexual abuse of children and women has been, and still is, a dark secret (Bradshaw, 1995). A study done by Collings (1997) at the University of Natal revealed that over 50 % of all second year st udents had reported some incidence of sexual abuse during their childhood and/or adolescent years. Statistics from the South African Police Force indicate {{an increase in the number}} of incest cases from 7559 in 1994 to 10037 in 1995 (Tucker, 2000). Lyell (1997) emphasised that the magnitude of the problem of sexual abuse is far greater than any professionals working in this field ever imagined. Over the past 24 years many studies have been published on the psychological impact of incest (Ensink, 1992). These effects include the disruption of normal development (Doyle, 1997), emotional problems (Newman & Peterson, 1996), social problems (Newman Lubell & Peterson, 1998) and physical problems (Tucker, 2000), to name a few. The abovementioned statistics show that incest is of concern in the South African context. It is also of international relevance because as Boyles, De Noon and Key (1999) have noted sexual abuse is a worldwide problem. The purpose of this study is to investigate the way adult female <b>survivor</b> <b>s</b> of childhood incest cope. The epistemological framework of this study is that of the Modernistic approach. Quantitative methods of research were therefore used to collect and analyse the data. The survivors’ ways of coping were assessed through response s t o the “Ways of Coping” Questionnaire given by a multi-e t h n i c sample containing mainly white women. Relevant biographical details were obtained with the use of a constructed biographical questionnaire. The differences regarding the different ways of coping, as related to specific factors, such as duration of therapy, duration of abuse and so forth, were discussed. Possible implications of the results have also been mentioned in this thesis. The information obtained provides a new perspective on incest, that of salutogenesis. Previous research has focused on the adverse effects that occur because of incest. There has not been a focus on the strengths of incest survivors, or the reason why some survivors cope better than others. It was found that incest sur vivors develop constructive coping skills, such as positive reappraisal, seeking social support and planful problem solving, after a minimal time period of one year in therapy. It was also found that the duration of abuse affects the way an adult survivor copes with the incest. Particular ways of coping are correlated with others, for example planful problem solving is correlated with positive reappraisal. The information which has emerged from this study may be useful for therapists working with incest sur vivors. Having a broader understanding of survivors’ ways of coping and some of the factors influencing these, may allow therapists to direct and teach ways of coping, and more specifically to facilitate and encourage more constructive ways of coping...|$|R
40|$|This article {{analyses}} {{the life}} stories of female Jewish refugees and <b>survivors</b> in 1950 <b>s</b> Britain {{in order to}} explore {{their relationship with the}} existing Jewish community and wider society. The paper is based on an analysis of twenty-one oral history testimonies from the Jewish survivors of the Holocaust collection held at the British library. Around 50, 000 Jewish refugees from Central Europe came to Britain in the 1930 s after fleeing from Hitler. In addition, {{a relatively small number of}} camp survivors and former hidden children settled in the country after the war; the Board of Deputies of British Jews Demographic Unit estimates the figure at 2000. This article considers how these refugee and survivor women tried to find a place for themselves within 1950 s Britain. Looking at their experiences of arrival, work and home, it reflects upon the discrimination and hostility they faced, and they ways they tried to deal with this. Finally it discusses what this meant for their sense of belonging or ‘unbelonging’...|$|R
