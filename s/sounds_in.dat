5|$|At {{first the}} art of music sought purity, limpidity and {{sweetness}} of sound. Then different sounds were amalgamated, care being taken, however, to caress the ear with gentle harmonies. Today music, as it becomes continually more complicated, strives to amalgamate the most dissonant, strange and harsh <b>sounds.</b> <b>In</b> this way we come ever closer to noise-sound.|$|E
5|$|Since many tornadoes are audible {{only when}} very near, sound {{is not to}} be thought of as a {{reliable}} warning signal for a tornado. Tornadoes are also not the only source of such <b>sounds</b> <b>in</b> severe thunderstorms; any strong, damaging wind, a severe hail volley, or continuous thunder in a thunderstorm may produce a roaring sound.|$|E
5000|$|A {{problem with}} {{teaching}} {{the reading of}} English with this analytical approach is that English words {{do not have a}} one-to-one speech-sound to symbol relationship. If they did have a one-to-one relationship, reading would be easier. In general, with a few common exceptions, the consonants do have a one-to-one speech-sound to symbol relationship but the vowels do not. For instance the letter [...] "a" [...] represents one <b>sound</b> <b>in</b> the word [...] "say", a second <b>sound</b> <b>in</b> [...] "at", a third <b>sound</b> <b>in</b> [...] "any", a fourth <b>sound</b> <b>in</b> [...] "are", a fifth <b>sound</b> <b>in</b> [...] "all", a sixth <b>sound</b> <b>in</b> [...] "about", a seventh <b>sound</b> <b>in</b> [...] "father", an eighth <b>sound</b> <b>in</b> [...] "orange", and a ninth <b>sound</b> (silence) <b>in</b> [...] "bread". The speech-sounds are sometimes influenced by (a) the letters surrounding the target vowel, (b) by the sentence containing the word and (c) the stress, or lack thereof, given to the syllable containing the letter.|$|R
5000|$|In areas {{explored}} by the British {{in the late}} 18th Century, particularly the northwest coast of North America, the term [...] "sound" [...] was applied to inlets containing large islands, such as Howe <b>Sound</b> <b>in</b> Vancouver and Puget <b>Sound</b> <b>in</b> Washington State. It was also applied to bodies of open water not fully open to the ocean, such as Caamaño Sound or Queen Charlotte <b>Sound</b> <b>in</b> Canada, or broadenings or mergings at the openings of inlets, like Cross <b>Sound</b> <b>in</b> Alaska and Fitz Hugh <b>Sound</b> <b>in</b> British Columbia.|$|R

The g always has the “hard” pronunciation, never the “soft” pronunciation of gem or giant. The s is always unvoiced, never pronounced with the z <b>sound</b> <b>in</b> rose or the zh <b>sound</b> <b>in</b> leisure.|$|R
5|$|The lungs {{also play}} {{a pivotal role in}} speech by {{providing}} air and airflow for the creation of vocal sounds.

5|$|The {{music on}} Kaleidoscope Dream draws on R, pop, funk, rock and soul styles, {{as well as}} {{elements}} from electronic and psychedelic music. The album's producers incorporated dense bass lines, buzzing synthesizers, and hazy, reverbed <b>sounds</b> <b>in</b> the songs, which deal mostly with sex, romance, and existential ideas. Miguel titled Kaleidoscope Dream {{as a metaphor for}} life and wanted the songs to reflect his lifestyle and personality.|$|E
5|$|A musical {{instrument}} is an instrument created or adapted to make musical <b>sounds.</b> <b>In</b> principle, any object that produces sound {{can be considered}} a {{musical instrument}}—it is through purpose that the object becomes a musical instrument. The history of musical instruments dates to the beginnings of human culture. Early musical instruments may have been used for ritual, such as a trumpet to signal success on the hunt, or a drum in a religious ceremony. Cultures eventually developed composition and performance of melodies for entertainment. Musical instruments evolved in step with changing applications.|$|E

25|$|The {{physics of}} <b>sound</b> <b>in</b> fluids {{differs from the}} physics of <b>sound</b> <b>in</b> solids, {{although}} both are density waves: <b>sound</b> waves <b>in</b> fluids only have longitudinal components, whereas <b>sound</b> waves <b>in</b> solids have longitudinal and transverse components. This is because fluids can't support shear stresses (but see viscoelastic fluids, which only apply to high frequencies).|$|R
5|$|Bulls have a loud vocalization {{consisting}} of screams known as bugling, {{which can be}} heard for miles. Bugling {{is often associated with}} an adaptation to open environments such as parklands, meadows, and savannas, where sound can travel great distances. Females are attracted to the males that bugle more often and have the loudest call. Bugling is most common early and late in the day {{and is one of the}} most distinctive <b>sounds</b> <b>in</b> nature, akin to the howl of the gray wolf.|$|E
5|$|Chris Brandkamp {{produced}} most of {{the ambient}} and incidental <b>sounds</b> <b>in</b> the game. To make sure the sounds fit, Brandkamp {{had to wait until}} the game's visuals were placed in context. Sound effects were drawn from unlikely sources; the noise of a fire in a boiler was created by driving slowly over stones in a driveway, because recordings of actual fire did not sound like fire burning. The chimes of a large clock tower were simulated using a wrench, then transposed to a lower pitch.|$|E
5|$|Conceived in {{the wake}} of a series of {{distressing}} personal events, 808s & Heartbreak marked a major musical departure for West from his previous rap records, instead featuring a sparse, electronic sound and West singing through an Auto-Tune vocal processor.

This achievement was {{due in part to the}} mainstream promotional efforts Modern Sounds had received from ABC prior to and following release. The album proved to be a crossover hit as well, as distributors claimed the record had been selling in pop, R and country music markets; at the time, often referred to as white and black markets during the period.|$|E

5000|$|By {{filling the}} tube with other gases besides air, and {{partially}} evacuating {{it with a}} vacuum pump, Kundt was also able to calculate the speed of <b>sound</b> <b>in</b> different gases at different pressures. To create his vibrations, Kundt stopped {{the other end of}} the tube with a loose fitting stopper attached to the end of a metal rod projecting into the tube, clamped at its center. When it was rubbed lengthwise with a piece of leather coated with rosin, the rod vibrated longitudinally at its fundamental frequency, giving out a high note. Once the speed of <b>sound</b> <b>in</b> air was known, this allowed Kundt to calculate the speed of <b>sound</b> <b>in</b> the metal of the resonator rod. The length of the rod L was equal to a half wavelength of the <b>sound</b> <b>in</b> metal, and the distance between the piles of powder d was equal to a half wavelength of the <b>sound</b> <b>in</b> air.

5|$|Modern <b>Sounds</b> <b>in</b> Country and Western Music is {{a studio}} album by American R singer-songwriter and {{musician}} Ray Charles. It was recorded by Charles in February 1962 at Capitol Studios in New York City and at United Recording Studios in Hollywood, before being released in April {{of that year}} by ABC-Paramount Records. The album departed stylistically from the singer's previous rhythm and blues music. It featured country, folk, and Western music standards reworked by Charles in popular song forms of the time, including R, pop, and jazz.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{scientific}} {{analyses of}} the name must account for {{the origins of the}} different forms found in early sources Latin (usually Londinium), Old English (usually Lunden), and Welsh (usually Llundein), with reference to the known developments over time of <b>sounds</b> <b>in</b> those different languages. It is agreed that the name came into these languages from British Celtic; recent work tends to reconstruct the lost Celtic form of the name as * or something similar. This was adapted into Latin as Londinium and borrowed into West Germanic, the ancestor-language of English, already before English had become widely spoken in Britain.|$|E

Diagnosis involves procedures such as bronchoscopy, radiography, and x-ray computed tomography to visualize the tracheobronchial tree. Signs and symptoms vary based on the location and severity of the injury; they commonly include dyspnea (difficulty breathing), dysphonia (a condition where the voice can be hoarse, weak, or excessively breathy), coughing, and abnormal breath <b>sounds.</b> <b>In</b> the emergency setting, tracheal intubation {{can be used to}} ensure that the airway remains open.
