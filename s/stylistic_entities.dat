40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to test the {{appropriateness}} of symmetry analysis as a method for the systematic classification of Early Mediaeval ornamentation. This method {{is different from the}} traditional Montehan concept of formal classification in archaeology, in that the <b>stylistic</b> <b>entities</b> are not chosen according to the formal similarity of individual motifs and motif-elements, but according to the formal similarity of their symmetrical organisation within an ornamental pattern. It is suggested that symmetry analysis is a more objective method of classifying and analysing ornamentation, as it avoids the subjective selection of typological elements, and therefore also avoids one of the pitfalls of typological classification caused by the ambiguity of the concept of style. Washburn, the originator of this method has suggested that in this way hypotheses can be tested regarding the identity as well as the interaction or information exchange of individuals belonging to a certain cultural, ethnic or social group. In order to test the usefulness of symmetry analysis in relation to these proposals for archaeological research, garnet jewellery from the Merovingian period as well as two manuscript paintings from the Gospel-books of Lindisfarne and Kells have been analysed and compared. It was concluded that the structure of the design-fields of the different types of artefact {{is one of the main}} factors for the appearance of certain symmetries within the ornamental context of the artefacts. However, the analysis could also indicate that the method has the potential to classify decorated artefacts according to different regions and workshops of production, and even according to their different social milieu of production. It is concluded that a larger quantity of material has to be analysed in order to get conclusive results from the symmetrical analysis in relation to the latter aspects of investigation, and with regard to the other original proposals made by Washburn...|$|E
40|$|Welcome to {{the first}} LRE-Rel Workshop on Language Resources and Evaluation for Religious Texts erence in Istanbul, Turkey. The focus of this {{workshop}} is the application of computer-supported and Text Analytics techniques to religious texts ranging from: the faith-defining religious canon; authoritative interpretations and commentary; sermons; liturgy; prayers; poetry; and lyrics. We {{see this as an}} inclusive and crossdisciplinary topic, and the workshop aims to bring together researchers with a generic interest in religious texts to raise awareness of different perspectives and practices, and to identify some common themes. We therefore welcomed submissions on a range of topics, including but not limited to: analysis of ceremonial, liturgical, and ritual speech; recitation styles; speech decorum; discourse analysis for religious texts; formulaic language and multi-word expressions in religious texts; suitability of modal and other logic types for knowledge representation and inference in religious texts; issues in, and evaluation of, machine translation in religious texts; text-mining, stylometry, and authorship attribution for religious texts; corpus query languages and tools for exploring religious corpora; dictionaries, thesaurai, Wordnet, and ontologies for religious texts; measuring semantic relatedness between multiple religious texts; (new) corpora and rich and novel annotation schemes for religious texts; annotation and analysis of religious metaphor; genre analysis for religious texts; application in other disciplines (e. g. theology, classics, philosophy, literature) of computersupported methods for analysing religious texts. Our own research has focussed on the Quran (e. g. see Proceedings of the main Conference, LREC' 2012; but we were pleased to receive papers dealing with a range of other religious texts, including Muslim, Christian, Jewish, Hindu, and Sikh holy books, as well as religious writings from the 17 th and 20 th centuries. Many of the papers present an analysis technique applied to a specific religious text, which could also be relevant to analysis of other texts; these include text classification, detecting similarities and correspondences between texts, authorship attribution, extracting collocations or multi-word expressions, <b>stylistic</b> analysis, Named <b>Entity</b> recognition, advanced search capabilities for religious texts, developing translations and dictionaries. This LRE-Rel Workshop demonstrates that religious texts are interesting and challenging for Language Resources and Evaluation researchers. It also shows LRE researchers a way to reach beyond our research community to the billions of readers of these holy books; LRE research can {{have a major impact on}} society, helping the general public to access and understand religious texts...|$|R
