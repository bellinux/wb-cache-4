25|$|A crystal or {{crystalline}} solid is a {{solid material}} whose constituents (such as atoms, molecules, or ions) are arranged in a highly ordered microscopic structure, forming a crystal lattice that extends in all directions. In addition, macroscopic single crystals are usually identifiable by their geometrical shape, consisting of flat faces with <b>specific,</b> <b>characteristic</b> orientations. The scientific study of crystals and crystal formation is known as crystallography. The process of crystal formation via mechanisms of crystal growth is called crystallization or solidification.|$|E

500|$|By substituting epithets for {{characters}}' names ("the youth", [...] "the tattered soldier"), Crane injects an allegorical quality {{into his}} work, making his characters {{point to a}} <b>specific</b> <b>characteristic</b> of man. There have been numerous interpretations concerning hidden meanings within The Red Badge of Courage. Beginning with Robert W. Stallman's 1968 Crane biography, several critics have explored the novel in terms of Christian allegory. In particular, the death of Henry Fleming's Christ-like friend, Jim Conklin, is noted for evidence of this reading, {{as well as the}} concluding sentence of chapter nine, which refers to the sun as [...] "fierce wafer" [...] in the sky. John Berryman {{was one of the first}} critics to interpret the novel as a modern wasteland through which the protagonist plays the role of an Everyman. Still others read the novel as having a Naturalist structure, comparing the work to those by Theodore Dreiser, Frank Norris and Jack London.|$|E
500|$|Written {{thirty years}} after the end of the Civil War and before Crane had any {{experience}} of battle, The Red Badge of Courage was innovative stylistically as well as psychologically. [...] Often described as a war novel, it focuses less on battle and more on the main character's psyche and his reactions and responses in war. [...] It is believed that Crane based the fictional battle in the novel on that of Chancellorsville; he may also have interviewed veterans of the 124th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment, commonly known as the Orange Blossoms, in Port Jervis, New York. [...] Told in a third-person limited point of view, it reflects the private experience of Henry Fleming, a young soldier who flees from combat. [...] The Red Badge of Courage is notable in its vivid descriptions and well-cadenced prose, both of which help create suspense within the story. [...] Similarly, by substituting epithets for characters' names ("the youth", [...] "the tattered soldier"), Crane injects an allegorical quality into his work, making his characters point to a <b>specific</b> <b>characteristic</b> of man. [...] Like Crane's first novel, The Red Badge of Courage has a deeply ironic tone which increases in severity as the novel progresses. [...] The title of the work is ironic; Henry wishes [...] "that he, too, had a wound, a red badge of courage", echoing a wish to have been wounded in battle. [...] The wound he does receive (from the rifle butt of a fleeing Union soldier) is not a badge of courage but a badge of shame.|$|E

2500|$|There {{are also}} {{suggestions}} {{of the potential}} of a Byronic heroine in Byron’s works. Charles J. Clancy claims that Aurora Raby in Don Juan possesses many of the characteristics typical of a Byronic hero. Described as “silent, lone” in the poem, her life has indeed been spent in isolation - she has been orphaned from birth. She validates Thorslev’s assertion that Byronic heroes are “invariably solitaries” (Clancy, 29). Yet, like her male counterpart, she evokes an interest from those around her, “There was awe in the homage which she drew” (XV, 47). Again, this is not dissimilar to {{the description of the}} fascination that Byron himself encountered wherever he went (McCarthy, 161). Her apparent mournful nature is also reminiscent of the regretful mien of the Byronic hero. She is described as having deeply sad eyes, [...] "Eyes which sadly shone, as Seraphs' shine" [...] (XV, 45). This was a <b>specific</b> <b>characteristic</b> of the Byronic hero (Clancy, 30). This seems to express a despair with humanity, not unlike the despair present in Byron's Cain, as Thorslev notes. She herself admits to despairing at [...] "man's decline" [...] (XV, 45), therefore this brings her into direct comparison with Cain's horror at the destruction of humanity (Clancy, 31).|$|E

The facts and admissions cited in disproof of the assertion that the sciences follow one another, both logically and historically, in the order of their decreasing generality, have been enforced by the sundry instances we have met with, in which the more general or abstract sciences have been advanced only at the instigation of the more special or concrete--instances serving to show that a more general science as much owes its progress to the presentation of new problems by a more special science, as the more special science owes its progress to the solutions which the more general science is thus led to attempt--instances therefore illustrating the position that scientific advance is as much from the special to the general as from the general to the special.|$|E

40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVES: To {{determine}} whether disease <b>specific</b> <b>characteristics,</b> reflecting clinical disease severity, {{add to the}} explanation of mobility limitations in patients with specific chronic diseases. DESIGN AND SETTING: Cross sectional study of survey data from community dwelling elderly people, aged 55 - 85 years, in the Netherlands. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: The additional explanation of mobility limitations by disease <b>specific</b> <b>characteristics</b> was examined by logistic regression analyses on data from 2830 community dwelling elderly people. MAIN RESULTS: In the total sample, chronic non-specific lung disease, cardiac disease, peripheral atherosclerosis, diabetes mellitus, stroke, arthritis and cancer (the index diseases), were all independently associated with mobility limitations. Adjusted for age, sex, comorbidity, and medical treatment disease <b>specific</b> <b>characteristics</b> that explain the association between disease and mobility mostly reflect decreased endurance capacity (shortness of breath and disturbed night rest in chronic non-specific lung disease, angina pectoris and congestive heart failure in cardiac disease), or {{are directly related to}} mobility function (stiffness and lower body complaints in arthritis). For atherosclerosis and diabetes mellitus, disease <b>specific</b> <b>characteristics</b> did not add to the explanation of mobility limitations. CONCLUSIONS: The results provide evidence that, to obtain more detailed information about the differential impact of chronic diseases on mobility, disease <b>specific</b> <b>characteristics</b> are important to take into account...|$|R
