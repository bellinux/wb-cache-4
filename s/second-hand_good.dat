5000|$|The {{field of}} {{application}} {{of the law of}} value is limited to new output by producers of traded, reproducible labour-products, although it might indirectly influence trade in other goods or assets (for example, the value of a <b>second-hand</b> <b>good</b> may be related to a newly produced good of the same type). Thus, the law does not apply to all goods, services or assets in an economy, and it does not rule the whole economy. In modern Marxism, the law of value is often equated with [...] "market economy", but that was not Marx's own idea. Rather, it limits, regulates and constrains the trade in products. Simply put, the socially necessary labour requirements set limits for the movements of product prices. [...] Primary products are a special case, which Marx discusses in his theory of differential and absolute ground rent. World market prices for primary products can at any time be strongly influenced by the yield of harvests and mines in different countries, regardless of labour effort. There are, besides, various kinds of products which, for one reason or another, are not subject to the law of value (see below).|$|E

40|$|While various Australian {{state governments}} have set {{targets for the}} {{reduction}} of waste to landfill, the emphasis to date has been placed mainly {{on the development of}} bulk materials recycling industries than on other strategies for waste reduction such as the reuse of <b>second-hand</b> <b>goods.</b> Many <b>second-hand</b> channels are informal and do not involve market transactions, making it difficult to collect information that could identify patterns. In this paper we report on the findings of a survey conducted with 306 Melbourne households about their practices of acquiring and disposing of used household goods. Our survey results confirm the importance of both formal and informal channels for the circulation of <b>second-hand</b> <b>goods</b> among Melbourne households. Sociodemographic characteristics such as household composition, employment status, education level and country of birth, along with infrastructure issues, such as dwelling types and residential tenures, are significant predictors of the use of various second-hand channels. A fuller understanding of the routes of reuse of <b>second-hand</b> <b>goods</b> will require grappling with complex intergenerational and gender effects, and large differences between types of dwellings, systems of infrastructure and living situations among Melbourne householders...|$|R

This analysis concluded that our target audience had high costs of obtaining <b>second-hand</b> <b>goods,</b> which often made them choose easier first-hand purchases. We decided that in order to reduce these costs, we would develop a product overview on the Internet for the second-hand store chain ‘Kirkens Korshær’. Initiating the first phase in an iterative process we designed a mock-up of the product overview based on usability theory. This mock-up was then evaluated in two steps first with our target-audience and later with a store manager of a ‘Kirkens Korshær’ store...|$|R

40|$|From a tax {{point of}} view, taxable dealers {{have the right}} to choose {{applying}} the special VAT scheme, under certain conditions and limitations. The European Directive requires, as a general rule, to assess the margin for each good, as a difference between the selling price charged by the reselling person and the purchase price for such good.

This article aims to release, {{for the first time on}} national level, divergences between the application of EU and national legislation on the tax arrangement of <b>second-hand</b> <b>goods</b> such as cars, starting from the fact that national legislation has chosen only the application of the second method (method of establishing the overall profit margin at the level of a tax period), irrespective of the type of <b>second-hand</b> <b>goods,</b> dealers and accounting system used by the latter...|$|R
40|$|We {{develop a}} game-theoretic {{framework}} {{to investigate the}} competitive implications of consumer-to-consumer electronic marketplaces, which promote concurrent selling of new and used goods. In many e-marketplaces, where suppliers cannot directly use <b>second-hand</b> <b>goods</b> for practicing inter-temporal price discrimination, the threat of cannibalization of new goods by used goods become significant. We examine conditions under which it is optimal for suppliers to operate in such markets, explaining why used-goods markets may not be predatory for them. While a monopolist supplier is worse off {{in the presence of}} a secondary market, competition can in fact make it better off. The presence of used-goods markets provides an active outlet for some consumers to sell their <b>second-hand</b> <b>goods.</b> Such sales lead to an increase in their disposable income. This increased income can then be used to buy an additional new good. Contrary to conventional wisdom, our model predicts the reduction in the price of new goods when there are used-goods markets. We highlight the strategic role that used goods commission plays in determining optimal profits. Overall, for a wide range of parameters, there is an increas...|$|R
