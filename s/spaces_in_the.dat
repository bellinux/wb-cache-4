Revenues from the rental <b>spaces</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> basement and upper floors had also begun to flow in. Notably, Hugh Morrow, a beat cop, had leased apartment 205. His granddaughter Susan Morrow would manage the Princess from 1981 to 1994.|$|E
5|$|Subsequent {{additions}} to the Board of Trade Building moved the agricultural and financial trading floors out of the original trading room and into new <b>spaces</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{additions to}} the building's rear in the 1980s. In 2004 the historic 1930 trading floor, already substantially altered (and unused {{for more than two}} years), was demolished and its pits filled with concrete. It was renovated in a modern style and now is leased to a privately owned options trading firm.|$|E
5|$|Birds {{have one}} of the most complex {{respiratory}} systems of all animal groups. Upon inhalation, 75% of the fresh air bypasses the lungs and flows directly into a posterior air sac which extends from the lungs and connects with air <b>spaces</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bones and fills them with air. The other 25% of the air goes directly into the lungs. When the bird exhales, the used air flows out of the lungs and the stored fresh air from the posterior air sac is simultaneously forced into the lungs. Thus, a bird's lungs receive a constant supply of fresh air during both inhalation and exhalation. Sound production is achieved using the syrinx, a muscular chamber incorporating multiple tympanic membranes which diverges from {{the lower end of the}} trachea; the trachea being elongated in some species, increasing the volume of vocalisations and the perception of the bird's size.|$|E

5|$|Bolton's 26 {{conservation}} areas contain 700 listed buildings, many {{of which}} are in the town centre, and there is parkland including the Victorian Queen's Park, Leverhulme Park and other open <b>spaces</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> surrounding area. These include Le Mans Crescent, Ye Olde Man & Scythe, Little Bolton Town Hall, the Market Place, Wood Street and Holy Trinity Church. The Market Hall of 1854 is a Grade II listed building. Outside the town centre can be found Mere Hall, Firwood Fold, Haulgh Hall, Park Cottage, St Mary's Church, Deane, Lostock Hall Gatehouse and All Souls Church. Notable mills still overlooking parts of the town are Sir John Holden's Mill and Swan Lane Mills.|$|E
5|$|During sexual arousal, the {{clitoris}} and {{the whole}} of the genitalia engorge and change color as the erectile tissues fill with blood (vasocongestion), and the individual experiences vaginal contractions. The ischiocavernosus and bulbocavernosus muscles, which insert into the corpora cavernosa, contract and compress the dorsal vein of the clitoris (the only vein that drains the blood from the <b>spaces</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> corpora cavernosa) and the arterial blood continues a steady flow and, having no way to drain out, fills the venous spaces until they become turgid and engorged with blood. This is what leads to clitoral erection.|$|E
5|$|In March 1997, {{the city}} passed Measure B, which granted the school {{district}} $69 million to replace old and crowded facilities and modernize the school campus. The renovations revived one of the school's last original structures: the Amador Theater, the city's most popular performing arts facility. The measure enabled the addition of renovated science classrooms, a multipurpose room, a library and media center, and a sound-proofed music building. The parking lot and central quad were expanded, with more than 550 parking <b>spaces</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> new lot, and classrooms were equipped to be more energy efficient.|$|E

5|$|Much of {{the estate}} had been managed as a coppiced woodland, giving Robinson the {{opportunity}} to plant drifts of scilla, cyclamen, and narcissus between the coppiced hazels and chestnuts. On the edges, and in the cleared <b>spaces</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> woods, Robinson established plantings of Japanese anemone, lily, acanthus, and pampas grass, along with shrubs such as fothergilla, stewartia, and nyssa. Closer to the house he had some flower beds; throughout he planted red valerian, which he allowed to spread naturally around paving and staircases. Robinson planted thousands of daffodils annually, including 100,000 narcissi planted along one of the lakes in 1897. Over the years he added hundreds of trees, some of them from American friends John Singer Sargent and Frederick Law Olmsted. Other features included an oval-shaped walled kitchen garden, a heather garden, and a water garden {{with one of the}} largest collections of water lilies in Europe.|$|E
5|$|Next to Columbia River, long {{segments}} of the 40 Mile Loop skirt the north edge of the slough watershed, while other segments such as the north–south I-205 Bike Path cross it or, {{as in the case}} of the largely unfinished Columbia Slough Trail, run through it generally along an east–west axis. The 40Mile Loop is a partly completed greenway trail around and through Portland and other parts of Multnomah County. Originally proposed by the Olmsted Brothers, architects involved in the planning for Portland's Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition of 1905, it has expanded to a projected , encircling the city and connecting parks along the Columbia, Sandy, and Willamette rivers and Johnson Creek. The parks and other public <b>spaces</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> watershed have their own pedestrian paths, some of which are also bicycle paths that connect to the 40Mile Loop. Many gaps lie between completed trail segments.|$|E
5|$|The {{vertebral}} arteries {{emerge as}} {{branches of the}} left and right subclavian arteries. They travel upward through transverse foramina – <b>spaces</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cervical vertebrae and then emerge as two vessels, one on the left and one on the right of the medulla. They give off one of the three cerebellar branches. The vertebral arteries join in front of the middle part of the medulla to form the larger basilar artery, which sends multiple branches to supply the medulla and pons, and the two other anterior and superior cerebellar branches. Finally, the basilar artery divides into two posterior cerebral arteries. These travel outwards, around the superior cerebellar peduncles, and {{along the top of the}} cerebellar tentorium, where it sends branches to supply the temporal and occipital lobes. Each posterior cerebral artery sends a small posterior communicating artery to join with the internal carotid arteries.|$|E

5|$|There {{are several}} green <b>spaces</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area, the largest being Brookmill Park, Deptford Park, Ferranti Park, Pepys Park and Sayes Court Park. In 1884 W.J. Evelyn, a {{descendant}} of John Evelyn, sold ground then being used as market gardens in Deptford, to the London County Council for less than its market value, as well as paying toward the cost of its purchase. It was officially {{opened to the public}} as Deptford Park on 7 June 1897. In 1886, he dedicated an acre and a half of the Sayes Court recreation ground in perpetuity to the public and a permanent provision was made for the Evelyn estate to cover the expense of maintenance and caretaking, this was opened on 20 July 1886.|$|E
5|$|With {{the ongoing}} {{disputes}} over the modern façade {{of the proposed}} new building, which some felt did not properly match the Jewish Quarter's aesthetic, an Englishman named Charles Clore took the initiative to fund a new design projects. He commissioned Denys Lasdun, who drew up plans between 1978 and 1981 that more closely adhered to the original Hurva. His plans were still considered insufficient, as they were rejected by Prime Minister Menachem Begin and the Minister of Interior, who refused to sign papers enabling construction to begin. No further progress was made and when Clore, who had wished to see the synagogue completed in his lifetime, died, his daughter provided funds to create {{one of the few}} open <b>spaces</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Jewish Quarter adjacent to the Hurva.|$|E

5|$|Allosaurus {{had nine}} {{vertebrae}} in the neck, 14 in the back, and {{five in the}} sacrum supporting the hips. The number of tail vertebrae is unknown and varied with individual size; James Madsen estimated about 50, while Gregory S. Paul considered that to be too many and suggested 45 or less. There were hollow <b>spaces</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> neck and anterior back vertebrae. Such spaces, which are also found in modern theropods (that is, the birds), are interpreted as having held air sacs used in respiration. The rib cage was broad, giving it a barrel chest, especially in comparison to less derived theropods like Ceratosaurus. Allosaurus had gastralia (belly ribs), {{but these are not}} common findings, and they may have ossified poorly. In one published case, the gastralia show evidence of injury during life. A furcula (wishbone) was also present, but has only been recognized since 1996; in some cases furculae were confused with gastralia. The ilium, the main hip bone, was massive, and the pubic bone had a prominent foot that may have been used for both muscle attachment and as a prop for resting the body on the ground. Madsen noted that in about half of the individuals from the Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry, independent of size, the pubes had not fused to each other at their foot ends. He suggested that this was a sexual characteristic, with females lacking fused bones to make egg-laying easier. This proposal has not attracted further attention, however.|$|E
5|$|Three B-29s {{based on}} Guam, which had spotless mission records and no {{mechanical}} difficulties, {{were selected for}} the mission. In a ten-day process that continued as a typhoon raged off Okinawa, the aircraft were stripped of unnecessary equipment such as armor and gun turrets, and the resulting empty <b>spaces</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fuselage were faired over with smooth metal to minimize parasitic drag. Blister-type bubble windows were replaced with flat ones, painted group markings were removed, and the aluminum aircraft skin polished to a high luster, all {{in order to achieve}} the least possible drag. Twentieth Air Force markings were painted on each vertical rudder. The bomb bay in each aircraft was fitted with five 600-gallon (2,300L) fuel tanks; added to the normal B-29 fuel tanks, this made a total of 10,000 gallons (38,000L) of fuel capacity, as much as a railroad tank car. Filled with fuel and 12 men, each ship weighed —it would be the greatest overload attempted on a B-29 at that time.|$|E
5|$|With {{the area}} having a {{generally}} low density and lacking transit-oriented development, the Metrorail {{was designed as}} a park and ride system, with the idea being that suburban residents would drive to the stations, then commute {{the rest of the way}} into the city. Nearly all of the stations outside of downtown Miami have parking facilities, except Tri-Rail Station. Several have large parking garages, such as Dadeland North and South stations, located at the southern end of the system, which combined have space for over 3,000 cars. Earlington Heights, located just northwest of Downtown and adjacent to Interstate 95 and the Airport Expressway, has a large garage that was formerly dedicated to Metrorail riders. However, that is now used by the county due to the station's low ridership, with only 95 vehicle spaces currently available. The successful Dadeland garages are at or over capacity, with two of Metrorail's proposed extensions, the West Kendall Corridor and South Link, intended to help alleviate them. The two northernmost stations, which are located near the Palmetto Expressway, Palmetto and Okeechobee, appeal to Broward County commuters with nearly 2,000 combined spaces. Additionally, the proposed North Corridor to the Broward/Miami-Dade county line would have included five park and ride facilities totaling 2,650 <b>spaces.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> late 1990s, the plan was to potentially even continue the Metrorail line into Broward County along 27th Avenue (University Drive), ending at Broward Boulevard near Broward Mall in Plantation.|$|E
