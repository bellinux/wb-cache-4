500|$|Critical {{reaction}} {{has been}} positive towards the song. Stephen Thomas Erlewine from Allmusic named it a [...] "track pick" [...] from the album. In {{a review of}} the album, Slant Magazine's Sal Cinquemani hailed it as [...] "a joyous composition". Michael Hubbard of musicOMH called it [...] "pure pop genius," [...] saying the track [...] "steals the show". Gary Crossing from Dotmusic described the song as a [...] "Sexy, bass-heavy monster of a floor-filler with cheesy synths, robotic voices and whispers aplenty" [...] while complimenting the [...] "I like to singy singy singy". This view was shared by Victoria Segal from NME who complimented Ahmadzaï's production technique and blending disco sounds with vocoder effects. She added that the song is [...] "so heavily distorted, the macho disco bassline is <b>so</b> <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> get its shirt off and the baby oil on, it somehow sounds cool." [...] Barry Walters from Rolling Stone called the song [...] "improvisional", and described it as [...] " [...] like a rock rocket ship, then [...] while a digitally tweaked [...] squeaks". David Browne from Entertainment Weekly called the verses of [...] "Impressive Instant" [...] as Madonna's [...] "dippiest lyrics in ages", and also complimented Ahmadzaï's fusion of hard disco beats and contorting Madonna's vocals. Greg Kot from Chicago Tribune credited Madonna for paying homage to dance music with [...] "Impressive Instant" [...] and explaining that: ...|$|E
2500|$|..... It {{was not his}} wont to talk at length, nor was he, unless {{exceptionally}} interested, a good listener. He was so {{logical and}} <b>so</b> <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> grasp a situation, that he would often cut short exposition by some forcible remark or personal raillery that would all too often quite disconcert the speaker.|$|E
2500|$|During a {{visit to}} the UK in April, the United Nations' Special Rapporteur on Violence Against Women, Rashida Manjoo, criticized the country's [...] "boys' club sexist culture". She argued that sexism in the UK was more [...] "pervasive" [...] and [...] "in your face" [...] than other {{countries}} she had visited, which included Algeria, Italy, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Azerbaijan, India and Croatia. She cited issues such the sexist portrayal of women in public, including the female nudity on Page Three of the Sun newspaper, bullying of girls in schools, and harassment in public spaces. Laura Bates, the founder of the Everyday Sexism Project, commented on Manjoo's criticisms calling them [...] "a wake-up call to recognise the depth and severity of the problem. We still have gender inequality in the UK [...] we are <b>so</b> <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> point the finger at other countries and suggest women [...] are equal." ...|$|E
5000|$|Lewis T. Duck: A small duck {{with a short}} temper. He is full of ideas, and {{believes}} them to be the best, <b>so</b> is <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> inform people that he is [...] "always right". He can be quite friendly but lacks patience. The 'T' stands for 'The'.|$|R
50|$|The {{advent of}} massed, rapid {{firepower}} {{of the machine}} gun, submachine gun and the rifled artillery piece was <b>so</b> <b>quick</b> as <b>to</b> outstrip the development of any way to attack a trench defended by riflemen and machine gunners. The carnage of World War I was perhaps the greatest vindication and vilification of the rifle as a military weapon.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Don't you, though?' he returned, {{with one}} of his jerks. 'I'm {{astonished}} at that, Master Copperfield, you being usually <b>so</b> <b>quick!</b> I'll try <b>to</b> be plainer, another time.---Is that Mr. Maldon a-norseback, ringing at the gate, sir?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That depends. To be a poet {{is to have}} a soul <b>so</b> <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> discern that no {{shade of}} quality escapes it, and <b>so</b> <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> feel, that {{discernment}} is but a hand playing with finely ordered variety on the chords of emotion--a soul in which knowledge passes instantaneously into feeling, and feeling flashes back as a new organ of knowledge. One may have that condition by fits only." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You know so much, Checco mio. Your mind is <b>so</b> <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> fathom {{matters of}} this kind. Think you, now, {{it might have}} been the Duca Valentino?" ...|$|E

50|$|Camelot is easy {{to learn}} and without {{extensive}} theory or praxis, making it perhaps more accessible for novices to play/enjoy compared to chess. Gameplay is exceptionally tactical almost from the first move, <b>so</b> games are <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> play to a finish.|$|R
60|$|Intrigue and {{trickery}} {{were more}} to Mr. Ward's liking, and <b>so</b> he was <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> alter his plan of campaign the instant {{that it became}} evident that Divine had elected to join forces with the opposing faction.|$|R

6000|$|... "Is he <b>so</b> <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> see us! A good {{look-out}} must be had, when a vessel, that {{is merely}} steadied by her stay-sails, {{can be seen}} so far. Vigilance is a never-failing sign of value!" ...|$|E

50|$|The {{country has}} planned to subsidize {{electric}} cars. Transport {{accounts for a}} large amount of fossil fuel use <b>so</b> a <b>quick</b> transition <b>to</b> electric cars and public transport will be a key element of transition to renewable energy use.|$|R

50|$|The {{baby boom}} saw a {{significant}} increase in sales for Jell-O. Young mothers didn't have the supporting community structures of earlier generations, <b>so</b> marketers were <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> promote easy-to-prepare prepackaged foods. By this time, creating a Jell-O dessert required simply boiling water, Jell-O and Tupperware molds.|$|R
6000|$|He resisted, {{and none}} <b>so</b> <b>quick</b> as women <b>to</b> scent resistance. His very {{unbending}} attitude aroused their inherent craving for rigidity in his profession; he was neither plastic, unctuous, nor subservient; his very homeliness, redeemed by {{the eyes and}} mouth, compelled their attention. One of them told Mrs. Larrabbee that that rector of hers would [...] "do something." ...|$|R
60|$|Ralph lighted a {{pipe and}} sat down on the piazza. He looked {{steadily}} in front of him, but he saw no grass, no trees, no moonlighted landscape, no sky of summer night. He saw only the face of a young girl, leaning over and looking down at him from the top of a stairway. It was the face of a girl who was so gentle, so thoughtful for others, <b>so</b> <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> perceive, <b>so</b> <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> do; who was so fond of his sister, and so beautiful. He sat and thought of the wondrous good fortune that had brought this girl beneath his roof, and had given him these charming hours with her.|$|E
60|$|If I {{had been}} Rectus, I don't think I {{should have been}} <b>so</b> <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> guess {{anything}} of that kind about my father; but perhaps he had heard things like that before. He took it as coolly as he generally took everything.|$|E
60|$|And I {{went up to}} her. She {{turned and}} looked at me, and I saw she was in fact Miss Caroline Spencer. But she was not <b>so</b> <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> {{recognize}} me; she looked startled. I pushed a chair to the table and sat down.|$|E

5000|$|Favre {{improved}} to 17-4 against the Bears {{in his career}} with this game, which was also his ninth straight road victory against the team. CB R.W.

60|$|Altogether, she was <b>so</b> <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> avoid me, and so {{constant}} to keep herself {{surrounded with}} others, that I must watch {{a long while}} before I could find my opportunity; and after it was found, I made not much of it, as you are now to hear.|$|E

5000|$|Pragmatism: An action someone makes {{should be}} judged {{according}} to the love influenced in it, so the user must always ask: {{what is the most}} loving thing to do? For example, war may not to a situationist be considered the most 'loving' thing and <b>so</b> many are <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> deem it as morally wrong.|$|R
50|$|Purpose {{built in}} the 1960s, and {{refurbished}} {{in the summer of}} 2008, 115 Queen's Road is directly opposite the student's union, and <b>so</b> has <b>quick</b> access <b>to</b> the student bar and university swimming pool.

6000|$|When {{six years}} ago that word had first fallen on Lady Valleys' ears, she had thought: [...] "Oh! dear! Am I really Granny?" [...] It had been a shock, had seemed the end of so much; but the matter-of-fact heroism of women, <b>so</b> much <b>quicker</b> <b>to</b> accept the {{inevitable}} than men, had soon come to her aid, and now, unlike her husband, she did not care a bit. For all that she answered nothing, partly {{because it was not}} necessary to speak in order to sustain a conversation with little Ann, and partly because she was deep in thought.|$|R
