2500|$|Compared {{to other}} members of the Felinae, the wildcat is a small species, but is {{nonetheless}} larger than the housecat. The wildcat is similar in appearance to a <b>striped</b> <b>tabby</b> cat, but has relatively longer legs, a more robust build, and a greater cranial volume. The tail is long, and usually slightly exceeds one-half of the animal's body length. Its skull is more spherical in shape than that of the jungle and leopard cat. The ears are moderate in length, and broad at the base. The eyes are large, with vertical pupils, and yellowish-green irises. Its dentition is relatively smaller and weaker than the jungle cat's. The species size varies according to Bergmann's rule, with the largest specimens occurring in cool, northern areas of Europe (such as Scotland and Scandinavia) and of Middle Asia (such as Mongolia, Manchuria and Siberia). Males measure [...] in body length, [...] in tail length, and normally weigh [...] Females are slightly smaller, measuring [...] in body length and [...] in tail length, and weighing [...]|$|E
50|$|The primary tabby pattern gene, Mc/mc or Mc/Mc, {{sets the}} basic pattern of stripes that {{underlies}} the coat. Mc is the wild-type tabby gene and produces {{what is called}} a Mackerel <b>striped</b> <b>tabby.</b> Classic tabbies are cats who also possess mc/mc, a recessive mutant gene that produces the blotched pattern.|$|E
50|$|The Dragon Li {{displays}} a unique golden brown, broken mackerel (also known as broken <b>striped)</b> <b>tabby</b> pattern, distinctive ear tipping, large round almond shaped luminescent yellow/green eyes, {{and a strong}} full bodied stature reminiscent of its wild nature. The Dragon Li is valued for its unmistakable intelligence, an uncanny cognizance in relation to its surroundings, {{and its ability to}} interact perspicuously with humans.|$|E
50|$|Toonces {{was portrayed}} by a live cat (for the title {{sequence}} and certain close-up driving scenes) and a puppet. The puppet {{was made up}} of three parts. The first part was a head and torso piece, which was a simplistic rendering of a grey-and-white <b>striped</b> short-haired <b>tabby.</b> The other two parts consisted of two separate paws, which were manipulated so as to simulate Toonces actually steering the car.|$|R
50|$|However, the agouti gene only {{controls}} {{the production of}} black pigment, so a cat with an O allele for orange color will still have the tabby pattern. As a result, both red cats and the patches of red on tortoiseshell cats will show <b>tabby</b> <b>striping.</b>|$|R
25|$|Despite {{thousands}} of years of domestication, there is very little difference between the housecat and its wild ancestor, as its breeding has been more subject to natural selection imposed by its environment, rather than artificial selection by humans. The wildcat subspecies that gave rise to the housecat is most likely the African wildcat, based on genetics, morphology, and behaviour. The African wildcat lacks the sharply defined dorsal stripe present in the European wildcat, a trait which corresponds with the coat patterns found in <b>striped</b> <b>tabbies.</b> Also, like the African wildcat, the housecat's tail is usually thin, rather than thick and bushy like the European wildcat's. In contrast to European wildcats, which are notoriously difficult to tame, hand-reared African wildcats behave almost exactly like domestic tabbies, but are more intolerant of other cats, and almost invariably drive away their siblings, mates, and grown kittens. Further evidence of an African origin for the housecat is present in the African wildcat's growth; like housecat kittens, African wildcat kittens undergo rapid physical development during {{the first two weeks of}} life. In contrast, European wildcat kittens develop much more slowly. The bacula of European domestic cats bear closer resemblance to those of local, rather than African wildcats, thus indicating that crossbreeding between housecats and wildcats of European origin has been extensive.|$|R
5000|$|Tabby :Striped, with {{a variety}} of patterns. The classic blotched tabby (or marbled) pattern is the most common and {{consists}} of butterflies and bullseyes. The mackerel or <b>striped</b> <b>tabby</b> is a series of vertical stripes down the cat's side (resembling the fish). This pattern broken into spots is referred to as a spotted tabby. In addition, the individual hairs in a tabby-patterned coat may be banded with different colors, hence a [...] "ticked" [...] tabby. The worldwide evolution of the cat means that certain types of tabby are associated with certain countries; for instance, blotched tabbies are quite rare outside NW Europe, where they are the most common type.|$|E
50|$|Jack (29 January 1976 - 20 April 1986) was {{a silver}} <b>striped</b> <b>tabby</b> and {{the brother of}} Jill who made his {{television}} debut with his sister just three weeks after they were born. Jack and Jill became known as Blue Peter's disappearing cats, for whenever they appeared on screen they tended to leap out of a presenter's lap. The production team put together a sequence of clips demonstrating this, featuring various moments when the cats leapt out of sight. It was set {{to the theme of}} the cartoon Top Cat, and was often requested by viewers as the clip they most wanted to see again. Jack died suddenly in 1986 at 10 years old.|$|E
5000|$|The primary tabby pattern gene, Mc/mc, {{sets the}} basic pattern of stripes that {{underlies}} the coat: the basic wild-type tabby gene, Mc, produces {{what is called}} a mackerel <b>striped</b> <b>tabby</b> (stripes look like thin fishbones and may break up into bars or spots); while a recessive mutant, mc, produces a blotched or classic tabby pattern (broad bands, whorls, and spirals of dark color on pale background usually with bulls-eye or oyster pattern on flank), common in Iran, Great Britain and in lands that were once part of the British Empire and Persian Empire. The gene responsible for this differential patterning has been identified as transmembrane aminopeptidase Q (Taqpep), which also produces the king cheetah coat variant.|$|E
50|$|The lack of <b>tabby</b> <b>striping</b> in bicolor cats is {{controlled}} by the agouti protein, which inhibits the production of melanin and thus prevents the formation of dark hair colors. In agouti cats the gene is turned on and off as the hair grows, producing hairs with alternating stripes yellow and black. In domestic cats, inactivation of the agouti gene by a deletion mutation causes all-black coat color.|$|R
50|$|The lynx point {{pattern is}} formed by {{cross-breeding}} a colorpoint cat with a tabby cat (or breeding cats that already possess the lynx point pattern). It {{is characterized by}} a mixture of the darkening (reduced) of point coloration, with distinct <b>tabby</b> <b>striping</b> on the head, tail, and legs, and an otherwise uniform and comparatively pale body. It is an accepted pattern, in some cat registries but not others, for particular breeds, mostly Siamese-related. Lynx point coloration was also a feature of some of the foundation stock of the Siberian.|$|R
5000|$|The agouti gene, A/a which {{codes for}} agouti {{signaling}} protein. The dominant, wild-type A causes the agouti shift phenomenon which causes hairs {{to be black}} pigmented at the tips and orange pigmented at the roots (revealing the underlying tabby pattern), while the recessive non-agouti or [...] "hypermelanistic" [...] allele, a, prevents this shift in the pigmentation pathway. In its homozygous form, aa, this results in black pigment production throughout the growth cycle of the hair. Thus, the non-agouti genotype (aa) masks or hides the tabby pattern, although sometimes a suggestion of the underlying pattern can be seen (called [...] "ghost striping"), especially in kittens. The O allele is also epistatic over the aa genotype. That is, the A to a mutation {{does not have a}} discernible effect on red or cream colored cats, resulting in these cats displaying <b>tabby</b> <b>striping</b> independent of their genotype at this locus. This explains why you can usually see the tabby pattern in the orange patches of non-agouti tortoiseshell cats, but not in the black or brown patches.|$|R
5000|$|Onstage, Mungojerrie and Rumpleteazer {{are usually}} costumed as orange, black and brown calico or tabby cats. Their relation, be it siblings, friends or mates, is unknown. In the {{original}} Broadway production, they wore baggy clown-like costumes seemingly made of various food wrappers as characters performing for Bustopher Jones. Generally, Mungojerrie's costume is a darker, more heavily <b>striped</b> <b>tabby</b> pattern, while Rumpleteazer is paler. However, when they perform their duet song, they have additional costume pieces that vary by which {{version of the}} song is performed: a vest and stockings for Mungojerrie and a leotard and stockings for the original Rumpleteazer, or pearls for the modern Rumpleteazer. This {{has the effect of}} making them appear almost identically marked.|$|E
50|$|Compared {{to other}} members of the Felinae, the wildcat is a small species, but is {{nonetheless}} larger than the housecat. The wildcat is similar in appearance to a <b>striped</b> <b>tabby</b> cat, but has relatively longer legs, a more robust build, and a greater cranial volume. The tail is long, and usually slightly exceeds one-half of the animal's body length. Its skull is more spherical in shape than that of the jungle and leopard cat. The ears are moderate in length, and broad at the base. The eyes are large, with vertical pupils, and yellowish-green irises. Its dentition is relatively smaller and weaker than the jungle cat's. The species size varies according to Bergmann's rule, with the largest specimens occurring in cool, northern areas of Europe (such as Scotland and Scandinavia) and of Middle Asia (such as Mongolia, Manchuria and Siberia). Males measure 43 to 91 cm in body length, 23 to 40 cm in tail length, and normally weigh 5 to 8 kg. Females are slightly smaller, measuring 40 to 77 cm in body length and 18 to 35 cm in tail length, and weighing 3 to 5 kg.Both sexes possess pre-anal glands, which consist of moderately sized sweat and sebaceous glands around the anal opening. Large-sized sebaceous and scent glands extend along the full length of the tail on the dorsal side. Male wildcats have pre-anal pockets located on the tail, which are activated upon reaching sexual maturity. These pockets {{play a significant role in}} reproduction and territorial marking. The species has two thoracic and two abdominal teats. The wildcat has good night vision, having 20 to 100% higher retinal ganglion cell densities than the housecat. It may have colour vision as the densities of its cone receptors are more than 100% higher than in the housecat. Its sense of smell is acute, and it can detect meat at up to 200 metres. The wildcat's whiskers are white; they can reach 5 to 8 cm in length on the lips, and number 7 to 16 on each side. The eyelashes range from 5 to 6 cm in length, and can number 6 to 8 per side. Whiskers are also present on the inner surface of the wrist, and can measure 3 to 4 cm.|$|E
6000|$|Quickly, and concealing {{her light}} {{as much as}} possible, {{she walked down the}} damp ash-strewn paths of the kitchen-garden, and came out into the {{overgrown}} and neglected shrubbery, or pleasance, where the long wet-laden shoots came beating in her face, and now and then seeming to hold her back, and strange rustlings were heard that would have frightened a maiden of a less stout and earnest heart. Her anxiety was lest she should be confused by the unwonted aspect of things in the dark, and miss the path; and very, very long did it seem, while her light would only show her leaves glistening with wet. At last she gained a clearer space, the border of a field: something dark rose before her, she knew the outline of the shed, and entered the lower part. It was meant for a cart-shed, with a loft above for hay or straw; but the cart had been lost or broken, and there was only a heap of rubbish in the corner, by which the children were wont to climb up to inspect their kittens. Here Rose was for a moment startled by a glare close to her of what looked like two fiery lamps in the darkness, but the next instant a long, low, growling sound explained it, and the <b>tabby</b> <b>stripes</b> of the cat quickly darted across her lantern's range of light. She heard a slight rustling above, and ventured to call, in a low whisper, [...] "Edmund." ...|$|R
