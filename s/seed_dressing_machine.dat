40|$|<b>Seed</b> <b>dressing,</b> i. e., the {{treatment}} of crop seeds with insecticides and/or fungicides, aiming to protect seeds from pests and diseases, is widely used in conventional agriculture. During the growing season, those crop fields often receive additional broadband herbicide applications. However, despite this broad utilization, very little is known on potential side effects or interactions between these different pesticide classes on soil organisms. In a greenhouse pot experiment, we studied single and interactive effects of <b>seed</b> <b>dressing</b> of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L. var. Capo) with neonicotinoid insecticides and/or strobilurin and triazolinthione fungicides and an additional one-time application of a glyphosate-based herbicide on the activity of earthworms, soil microorganisms, litter decomposition, and crop growth. To further address food-web interactions, earthworms were introduced to half of the experimental units as an additional experimental factor. Seed dressings significantly reduced the surface activity of earthworms with no difference whether insecticides or fungicides were used. Moreover, <b>seed</b> <b>dressing</b> effects on earthworm activity were intensified by herbicides (significant herbicide × <b>seed</b> <b>dressing</b> interaction). Neither <b>seed</b> dressings nor herbicide application affected litter decomposition, soil basal respiration, microbial biomass, or specific respiration. <b>Seed</b> <b>dressing</b> did also not affect wheat growth. We conclude that interactive effects on soil biota and processes of different pesticide classes should receive more attention in ecotoxicological research...|$|R
40|$|Black beetles (BB: Heteronychus spp. : Coleoptera, Scarabaeidae) {{are serious}} {{constraints}} to upland rice {{production in the}} Madagascar central highlands. From 2002 to 2007 we compared the effects of two soil management and two fertilization modalities in an upland rice-based cropping system on soil macrofauna abundance, diversity and BB damage to rice crops and yield. This cropping system involved a 2 -year rotation of upland rice the first year, followed by common bean the second year, with oat as a relay crop under both conventional tillage (CT) and no-tillage soil management (NT), each under both organic (OF) and mineral fertilization (MF). All four modalities (CT-OF; CT-MF; NT-OF and NT-MF) were managed under two plant protection levels (<b>seed</b> <b>dressing</b> with imidacloprid + thiram vs no <b>seed</b> <b>dressing).</b> Herbivorous/detritivorous beetles were the most abundant soil biota, respectively representing more than two-thirds and half of all macrofauna {{at the outset of}} the experiment and 4 years later, with the BB Heteronychus arator rugifrons (Fairmaire) being the dominant pest species (herbivore). The Shannon diversity index was reduced significantly between the beginning and the end of the experiment 4 years later, while it was only marginally affected by soil management, fertilization and <b>seed</b> <b>dressing</b> regimes at both sampling dates. Throughout the study period, <b>seed</b> <b>dressing</b> resulted in a significant reduction in BB damage, and in a significantly higher rice grain yield as compared to control. NT management did not enable <b>seed</b> <b>dressing</b> discontinuation based on grain yield and BB damage level after 3 and 4 years of this practice, respectively. In this respect, CT-MF management ranked best in the absence of <b>seed</b> <b>dressing.</b> The reasons for the poor performance of NT management in the studied cropping system as compared to the same strategy used in other systems reported in earlier studies are discussed.

40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Seed</b> <b>dressing</b> with carbosulfan, benfurocarb and {{triazophos}} {{reduced the}} gall index and incrased the yield of okra. Maximum yield was obtained with carbosulfan 3 % with gall index 3. 0 as against 5. 0 in control. Seed soaking in carbosulfan, triazophos, monocrotophos and zolone {{reduced the number}} of galls and egg-masses. Carbosulfan reduced the invasion of larvae. Key words: Okra, root-knot, insecticides, control The root-knot nematode (Meloidogyne incognita) is a major limiting factor in vegetable production. Yield losses due to this nematode are estimated at 28 - 91 % on okra Abelmoschus esculentus (Reddy and Singh, 1981). Seed treatment with nematicides lowers the nematode management cost and effectively reduces the severity of root-knot infection in okra (Sivakumar et al., 1973).

40|$|In 2000, beekeepers {{from the}} Italian region of Friuli {{reported}} losses {{of a high}} number of bee hives during the spring season. At the time of this bee incident farmers in Friuli had started to drill their corn fields and some of the seeds had been treated with the <b>seed</b> <b>dressing</b> product Gaucho (active ingredient: imidacloprid). Reports by some French beekeepers on suspected impacts of <b>seed</b> <b>dressed</b> sunflowers on honeybees made some Italian beekeepers to believe {{that there might be a}} link between their bee losses and the use of Gaucho <b>seed</b> <b>dressing</b> on corn <b>seed.</b> During drilling, dust particles are emitted by the pneumatic seed drilling ma-chines which may also contain abraded <b>seed</b> <b>dressing</b> particles. In response to this concern, further investigations were conducted to examine whether corn crops, seed-treated with Gaucho will pose a risk to honey bees. In October 2001 and June 2002, two field trials were conducted in Germany with Italian and German commercial maize seeds to investigate the possible abrasion of Gaucho from seed-treated maize during sowing with a pneumatic drilling machine. The results show an average emission rate of only 4 % on the seed drilling rate with a standard dressing formulation. Formulations with adjuvants diminished abrasions even more. In parallel, a replicated cage test with honey bees was conducted to examine whether the recorded abrasion rates could ad-versely affect honeybee colonies foraging on flowering plants with simulated deposits of emitted dust particles. From the findings of this replicated cage study it can be concluded that deposition rates which were much higher than those potentially emitted fro...|$|R
