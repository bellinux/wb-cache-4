5|$|BoxBoy! {{received}} a positive reception from critics. Reviewers praised the game's creative puzzles and inventive {{use of the}} box-manipulation mechanics. Some critics were pleasantly <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> amount of content that was offered and agreed that the package was good value for money. However, the game's simple art style was divisive among reviewers. A sequel, BoxBoxBoy!, was released for the Nintendo 3DS in 2016, with a third game, Bye-Bye BoxBoy!, in 2017.|$|E

5|$|The 2nd Ranger Company {{then moved}} east to help relieve the 7th Marines, which was reeling from Chinese attacks. In {{three days of}} {{intermittent}} fighting, the company conducted a number of search and destroy missions. This culminated in an attack on Hill 545, where an estimated company of Chinese troops, who had previously pushed the Marines back, were themselves <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Rangers and forced to withdraw, losing 15 killed to the Rangers' two wounded.|$|E
5|$|The British {{military}} was <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> attack on Convoy Faith, {{as it had}} been believed that the Condors no longer posed a serious threat. In response, the convoy route between Britain and Africa was moved to the west. The German Condor force attempted to repeat its success against Convoy Faith by carrying out similar attacks on other convoys, but sustained heavy losses from Allied anti-aircraft guns and aircraft.|$|E

5|$|The {{storm was}} {{classified}} as a supercell following further analysis of its erratic nature and extreme attributes. During the event, the Bureau of Meteorology was constantly <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> frequent changes in direction, {{as well as the}} severity of the hail and the duration of the storm. The event was also unique as the time of year and general conditions in the region were not seen as conducive for extreme storm cell formation.|$|E
5|$|US {{officials}} in Washington were <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> coup. Although Khánh had already told CIA agent Lucien Conein—who helped {{to plan the}} coup against Diệm—in December 1963 {{that he intended to}} overthrow Minh, the report was filed away among the many rumors that were received by American representatives.|$|E
5|$|Betances' remains {{arrived in}} San Juan, Puerto Rico on August 5, 1920, and were honored upon arrival by a crowd then {{estimated}} at 20,000 mourners. The large crowd, which had assembled near {{the port of}} San Juan as early as 4:00a.m. (AST) that morning, was the largest ever assembled for a funeral in Puerto Rico {{since the death of}} Luis Muñoz Rivera three years earlier. Media reporters of the day were <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> size of the crowd, given the fact that Betances had not visited Puerto Rico (at least in the open) for the 31 years before his death, and had been dead over 21 years afterwards.|$|E

2500|$|The Shah {{was taken}} {{completely}} <b>by</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> protests; {{to make matters}} worse he often became indecisive during times of crisis.

5|$|Brashear has {{represented}} the United States on two separate occasions. He made his international debut at the 1997 World Championship, where he registered two goals and five points in eight games, helping the Americans to a sixth-place finish. He later {{noted that he}} was <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> invitation, but felt that it gave him an opportunity to show he could play other roles besides being an enforcer. He played for the U.S. again the following year at the World Championship, playing in six games and accumulating ten penalty minutes as the Americans finished in 12th place.|$|E
5|$|Following Jefferson's {{return to}} Grimsby, Marstrand's were puzzled by Orsborne's actions, but {{initially}} {{thought that he}} had taken on another engineer in Dover and had gone fishing, perhaps in new grounds. There were unconfirmed sightings of Girl Pat in the Baltic Sea and elsewhere. As weeks passed with no definite news, the Marstrand directors assumed that the vessel was lost, either through foundering or barratry, and claimed insurance. They had already received sums totalling £2,400 from the underwriters, when they were <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> arrival of bills from Corcubión, together with the news that Girl Pat had sailed from the port on 24 April, her destination unknown.|$|E
5|$|On {{the kickoff}} {{following}} the field goal, Georgia head coach Mark Richt ordered an unorthodox onside kick. <b>Surprised</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> unexpected play, the Virginia Tech coverage team {{was unable to}} recover the ball, which was leapt upon by the kicker, Brian Mimbs. With a new chance at offense {{and a sense of}} optimism triggered by the successful onside kick, Georgia drove down the field. Aided by 20yards in penalties against Virginia Tech, the drive resulted in a six-yard touchdown pass to Martrez Milner. The touchdown and extra point boosted Georgia's morale and cut the score to 21–13, Virginia Tech leading by eight.|$|E

60|$|Barringford led the advance, having {{questioned}} Bevoir {{so closely}} {{that he said}} he felt he could find the cave in the dark. As the party moved on, all kept their eyes and ears wide open for a possible <b>surprise</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> enemy.|$|R
5|$|Piłsudski's PPS, {{while not}} {{planning}} for a major uprising then and there, had a policy of supporting the protest and harassing Russian forces. The PPS, {{as well as other}} socialist organizations, such as Jewish Bund and SDKPiL, were as <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> scale of the spontaneous revolt as the Russian authorities; PPS forces in Łódź consisted of 10 regular and armed PPS members and a few dozen semi-enlisted workers. A larger group sent from Warsaw under Walery Sławek never made it in time to take control or affect the uprising; it was, in the end, an anarchic and unorganized violent protest against the Russian government.|$|E
5|$|Pong {{is one of}} the {{earliest}} arcade video games. It is a table tennis sports game featuring simple two-dimensional graphics. The game was originally manufactured by Atari, which released it in 1972. Allan Alcorn created Pong as a training exercise assigned to him by Atari co-founder Nolan Bushnell. Bushnell based the idea on an electronic ping-pong game included in the Magnavox Odyssey, which later resulted in a lawsuit against Atari. <b>Surprised</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> quality of Alcorn's work, Bushnell and Atari co-founder Ted Dabney decided to manufacture the game.|$|E
5|$|Quadras, who was {{interested}} in sports, started writing the screenplay for the film in 2011, which took two years to complete. Quadras arranged a meeting with Kom via her manager in the year he started writing the script. Kumar went to Manipur to meet Kom and seek her permission to make the film. Initially, Kom was <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> development as the sport, especially women's boxing, was not well known in India. However, she was enthusiastic about the idea.|$|E
60|$|He did not exhibit much {{excitement}} {{while doing}} this. It was, after all, but a trifling jest in his esteem, {{as the only}} result to be hoped for would be the giving of a <b>surprise</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> little tug which might perhaps be experienced <b>by</b> <b>the</b> artist on rising.|$|R
6000|$|... "How do you do, Mr. McEachern?" [...] inquired Jimmy genially. [...] "Quite a {{surprise}} meeting you in England.

5|$|<b>Surprised</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Austrian advance toward Genoa in mid-April 1800, Bonaparte had hastily led {{his army}} over the Alps in mid-May and reached Milan on 2 June.

Under Mao's urgent orders, the 9th Corps Army was rushed into North Korea on 10 November. Undetected by UN intelligence, the 9th Corps Army quietly entered the Chosin Reservoir area on 17 November, with the 20th Corps of the 9th Army relieving the 42nd Corps near Yudami-ni.|$|E
5|$|<b>Surprised</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{underperformance}} of Thunderbirds Are Go {{and convinced}} that the franchise still had cinematic potential, United Artists authorised {{the production of a}} sequel. However, Thunderbird 6 received a similarly unenthusiastic response on its release in 1968, and the Thunderbirds franchise was abandoned until the appearance of a reboot, starring live actors, in 2004. Meanwhile, the Zero-X astronauts were featured in their own strip in the Anderson-related TV Century 21 comic until 1969, and the MEV portion of the spacecraft appeared in the pilot episode of Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons.|$|E
