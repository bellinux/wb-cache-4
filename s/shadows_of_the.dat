5|$|A {{comparison}} of two spandrels reveals different post-restoration states. The {{one on the}} left has shadows and details defined in black. The green robe with yellow highlights has been washed with black and defined with deep shadow. On the fictive architecture each motif is picked out in black. The eyes of the child are detailed in black and white. The continued presence of these details suggests that they were completed while the plaster was damp. The entire right spandrel has an unfinished look. Before cleaning it also had black defining the <b>shadows</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> robes and crisp detailing on the architecture.|$|E
5|$|Thief II {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics, and its initial sales were stronger {{than those of}} its predecessor. However, the game's royalties were processed slowly, which compounded Looking Glass's financial troubles. As a result, the company closed in May 2000, with plans for Thief III cancelled. The third game in the series, entitled , was developed by Ion Storm and published by Eidos in 2004. Thief 2X: <b>Shadows</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Metal Age, a widely praised expansion mod for Thief II, was released in 2005.

They were told that a number of Jews who were being taken to the gas chambers had escaped and hidden in the woods. They were ordered to take pistols and search the woods. When his group arrived at the extermination area of the camp they saw a farmhouse, in front of which were SS men and the bodies of seven or eight prisoners who had been caught and shot. The SS men told Gröning and his comrades that they could go home but they decided to hang around in the <b>shadows</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> woods.|$|E

5|$|Outside of Capcom, Killer7 {{served as}} {{a turning point for}} Suda51 and his studio, Grasshopper Manufacture, {{effectively}} launching his career. With Capcom as publisher, Killer7 was his first game to be released outside Japan. While its sales were not up to Capcom's standards, the game's cult success encouraged the director to remake two of his older Japan-only games, The Silver Case and Flower, Sun, and Rain, for Western release. It also allowed his next major title, No More Heroes, to be released to critical and commercial success. The game also cemented Suda51's status as an auteur video game director. He would later work with Shinji Mikami again on <b>Shadows</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Damned.|$|E
5|$|Shortly afterwards, Bruno and George {{arrive at}} the same theatre, {{following}} Bruno's device to an energy source he was tracing. George decides to break in, finding Susarro, Petra, and Flap (who survived {{falling out of the}} train in <b>Shadows</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Templars) interrogating Nico about her investigations; George quickly rescues her when Flap is left on his own with her, knocking him out in the process. After the pair reveal what led them to crossing paths with each other, they decide to continue searching the theatre, looking for the source of the energy Bruno detected. In the process, they find two keys - one in a safe, which is made of stone and decorated with crystals, and was the energy source Bruno detected, while the other, a stone, is found in a weird chamber, within a column of energy, bearing an omega symbol on it. Heading outside, after escaping from Susarro and Petra (who had been dealing with a mysterious, hooded man), George is tazed by an unknown assailant, who takes the strange energy key from him.|$|E
5|$|Piper {{reported}} {{that as he}} was leaving Exchange Buildings to return to Houndsditch he saw a man acting suspiciously in the <b>shadows</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cul-de-sac. As the policeman approached him, the man walked away; Piper later described him as being approximately , pale and fair-haired. When Piper reached Houndsditch he saw two policemen from the adjoining beats—constables Woodhams and Choate—who watched 120 Houndsditch and 11 Exchange Buildings while Piper went to the nearby Bishopsgate Police Station to report. By 11:30 seven uniformed and two plain clothes policemen had gathered in the locality, each armed with his wooden truncheon. Sergeant Bentley from Bishopsgate police station knocked at number 11, unaware that Piper had already done so, which alerted the gang. The door was answered by Gardstein, who made no response when Bentley asked if anyone was working there. Bentley asked him to fetch someone who spoke English; Gardstein left the door half-closed and disappeared inside. Bentley entered the hall with Sergeant Bryant and Constable Woodhams; as they could see the bottom of his trouser legs, they soon realised that someone was watching them from the stairs. The police asked the man if they could step {{into the back of the}} property, and he agreed. As Bentley moved forward, the back door opened and one of the gang exited, firing from a pistol as he did so; the man on the stairs also began firing. Bentley was shot in the shoulder and the neck—the second round severing his spine. Bryant was shot in the arm and chest and Woodhams was wounded in the leg, which broke his femur; both collapsed. Although they survived, neither Bryant or Woodhams fully recovered from their injuries.|$|E
5|$|In 1903 Synge left Paris {{and moved}} to London. He had written two one-act plays, Riders to the Sea and <b>The</b> <b>Shadow</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Glen, the {{previous}} year. These met with Lady Gregory's approval and <b>The</b> <b>Shadow</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Glen was performed at the Molesworth Hall in October 1903. Riders to the Sea was performed at the same venue in February the following year. <b>The</b> <b>Shadow</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Glen, under the title In <b>the</b> <b>Shadow</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Glen, formed part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bill for <b>the</b> opening run <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Abbey Theatre from 27 December 1904 to 3 January 1905. Both plays were based on stories that Synge had collected in the Aran Islands, and Synge relied on props from the Aran Islands to help {{set the stage for}} each of them. He also relied on Hiberno-English, <b>the</b> English dialect <b>of</b> Ireland, to reinforce its usefulness as a literary language, partly because he believed that the Irish language could not survive.|$|R
