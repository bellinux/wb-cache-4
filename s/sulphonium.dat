5000|$|The SET domain itself {{turned out}} to be an {{uncommon}} structure. Although in all three studies, electron density maps revealed the location of the AdoMet or AdoHcy cofactor, the SET domain bears no similarity at all to the canonical/AdoMet-dependent methyltransferase fold. Strictly conserved in the C-terminal motif of the SET domain tyrosine could be involved in abstracting a proton from the protonated amino group of the substrate lysine, promoting its nucleophilic attack on the <b>sulphonium</b> methyl group of the AdoMet cofactor. In contrast to the AdoMet-dependent protein methyltranferases of the classical type, which tend to bind their polypeptide substrates on top of the cofactor, it is noted from the Rubisco LSMT structure that the AdoMet seems to bind in a separate cleft, suggesting how a polypeptide substrate could be subjected to multiple rounds of methylation without having to be released from the enzyme. In contrast, SET7/9 is able to add only a single methyl group to its substrate.|$|E

The potencies of these compounds were assayed {{by measuring the}} kinetics of inactivation of the yeast Kex 2 proteinase, the prototype of a growing family of eukaryotic precursor processing proteinases. The most potent inhibitor, Pro-Nvl-Tyr-Lys-Arg-chloromethane, was based on cleavage sites in the natural Kex 2 substrate pro-alpha-factor.

40|$|DNA {{methylation}} {{appears to}} be involved in the regulation of gene expression. Transcriptionally inactive (silenced) genes normally contain a high proportion of 5 -methyl- 2 '-deoxycytosine residues whereas transcriptionally active genes show much reduced levels. There appears good reason to believe that chemical agents capable of methylating 2 '-deoxycytosine might affect gene expression and as a result of hypermethylating promoter regions of cytosine-guanine rich oncogenic sequences, cancer related genes may be silenced. This thesis describes the synthesis of a number of `electrophilic' S-methylsulphonium compounds and assesses their ability to act as molecules capable of methylating cytosine at position 5 and also considers their potential as cytotoxic agents. DNA is methylated in vivo by DNA methyltransferase utilising S-adenoxylmethionine as the methyl donor. This thesis addresses the theory that S-adenoxylmethionine may be replaced as the methyl donor for DNA methytransferase by other <b>sulphonium</b> compounds. S-[3 H-methyl]methionine <b>sulphonium</b> iodide was synthesised and experiments to assess the ability of this compounds to transfer methyl groups to cytosine in the presence of DNA methyltransferase were unsuccessful. A proline residue adjacent to a cysteine residue has been identified to a highly conserved feature of the active site region of a large number of prokaryotic DNA methyltransferases. The thesis examines the possibility that short peptides containing the Pro-Cys fragment may be able to facilitate the alkylation of cytosine position 5 by <b>sulphonium</b> compounds. Peptides were synthesised up to 9 amino acids in length but none were shown to exhibit significant activity. Molecular modelling techniques, including Chem-X, Quanta, BIPED and protein structure prediction programs were used to assess any structural similarities that may exist between short peptides containing a Pro-Cys fragment and similar sequences present in proteins.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the preparation and reactions of hexafluorobut- 2 -yne (H. F. B.). Attempts to improve the somewhat unsatisfactory literature method for preparing this acetylene were unsuccessful. However, the pyrolysis of perfluorocyclobutene over fluoride ion, a reaction first reported by a previous worker in this laboratory, has been developed to provide a new high yield route to H. F. B. Free radical additions to H. F. B. have been investigated and a series of novel adducts was obtained. The behaviour of H. F. B. was found to differ considerably from that of fluoroalkenes, which have been studied previously. A number of reactions of H. F. B. involving the use of caesium fluoride as an initiator have been studied. Copolymers of various compositions were obtained from reactions with acetylenic esters and several interesting co-oligomers were prepared from fluoroalkenes. The additions of a variety of nucleophiles to H. F. B. were investigated with a view to obtaining cyclic products. Most of these experiments gave polyhexafluorobut- 2 -yne as the only product but a reaction with sulphur did give a thiophene derivative.

40|$|Horseradish {{peroxidase}} (HRP) is {{a robust}} enzyme with commercial applications as an immunodiagnostic reporter enzyme {{and in the}} catalysis of difficult chemical transformations. The commercial enzyme is still isolated from {{the roots of the}} horseradish plant Armoracia rusticana, and has been studied as a model haem enzyme system since the early 1940 ’s. Following the development of methods to produce the active recombinant enzyme in E. coli (Smith et al., 1990) and completion of the crystallographic structure in 1997 (Gajhede et al., 1997) it has been possible to identify the structural requirements for activity and to extend these activities by protein engineering techniques. Three aspects relating to the enhancement of the ‘normal’ and ‘designed’ activities of selected variants have been explored at the structure function level in this work. Earlier work (Gajhede et al., 1997; White et al., 1997) highlighted residues that interact with aromatic substrates but that also potentially occlude access to the reactive haem edge by larger bulky substrates of potential commercial interest. The X-ray structure of the HRP-C* A 140 G/F 179 A variant was solved to 2. 0 Å. A larger engineered cavity at the haem edge was observed consistent with the ability of the variant to oxidise luminol directly, a property not seen in the wild-type enzyme. The structure factors for other residues in the haem access channel were not significantly affected. The structure of the S 167 M HRP variant was also solved, because of interest in its ability to form a novel <b>sulphonium</b> linkage to the haem vinyl group (K. Cali, DPhil thesis, University of Sussex). The sulphur to β vinyl distance was found to be 3. 15 Å, compared to 1. 7 Å in the natural <b>sulphonium</b> linkage of myeloperoxidase. This implies that significant thermal motion in the structure is required for the haem-protein crosslink to form, accounting for the relatively slow autocatalytic modification process observed in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. Previous work (Ngo and Smith, Int. Pat. No. WO/ 2007 / 020428) has shown that HRP engineered with a more open distal haem pocket (mimicking that of chloroperoxidase or cytochrome P 450 s) with a weak surrogate base (provided by a Glu residue as in chloroperoxidase) was capable of both entantioselective sulphoxidation and epoxidation. Building on this work, an alternative variant was designed in which the location of the weak base, provided by a Glu or Asp residue, has been varied within the active site. In particular, the HRP variant R 38 E:F 41 A:H 42 A (EAA) catalyses the production of the 1 and 2 naphthol from naphthalene at a rate of 124 ± 4 min- 1, suggesting the generation of an epoxide intermediate in the active site. The wild-type enzyme does not catalyse this reaction or the sulphoxidation reactions described for earlier variants. This {{is believed to be the}} first report of aromatic C-H bond activation by an engineered plant peroxidase and is unusual in that C-H bond activation of this type normally requires a P 450 -type thiolate ligated haem system. Equilibrium binding studies show that naphthalene binds to the engineered haem cavity with an estimated Kd of 30 ± 2 μM. Unfortunately, crystals of HRP variants described by Ngo and Smith (2007) and of the new EAA variant described here could not be obtained, despite many crystallisation attempts under a wide range of conditions...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} value of s-methylmethionine <b>sulphonium</b> {{chloride}} (SMMSC) (200 mg/kg) on nutritional performance of pigs and as prevention or therapy for oesophagogastric ulcers. Design: Sixty pigs from a high health status herd with continuing oesophagogastric ulcer problems were endoscopically assessed for {{the presence or absence}} of oesophagogastric ulcers. Forty-eight pigs were then selected and allocated according to an initial oesophagogastric epithelial (ulcer score) classification to replicated treatment groups in a 2 × 2 factorial design. Weight gain and feed intake were measured over 49 d, after which pigs were killed and stomachs were collected, re-examined and scored for oesophagogastric ulceration. Results: There was no difference over the 49 d in weight gain, feed intake and backfat in pigs with and without SMMSC supplementation between pigs with or without fully developed oesophagogastric ulcers at the start of the study. In pigs with an initially low ulcer score, feeding SMMSC did not prevent further oesophagogastric ulcer development. No significant effect of SMMSC was apparent when final mean oesophagogastric ulcer scores were compared in pigs with existing high ulcer score. However, further analysis of the changes in individual pig oesophagogastric ulcer scores during the experiment showed that the observed reductions in scores of the high ulcer group was significantly different from all other groups. Conclusion: This study has indicated that supplementation of pig diets with SMMSC cannot be justified unless the slight ulcer score improvement observed could be translated to some commercial production advantage such as a reduction in pig mortalities due to oesophagogastric ulcers. This study has further confirmed the benefit of endoscopy as a tool to enable objective assessment of oesophageal gastric health...|$|E
40|$|Methionine adenosyltransferases (MATs) are {{a family}} of enzymes in charge of synthesising S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), the most {{important}} methyl donor present in living organisms. These enzymes use methionine and ATP as reaction substrates, which react in a SN 2 fashion where the sulphur atom from methionine attacks C 5 ′ from ATP while triphosphate chain is cleaved. A MAT liver specific isoenzyme has been detected, which exists in two distinct oligomeric forms, a dimer (MAT III) and a tetramer (MAT I). Our previously reported crystal structure of MAT I complexed with an inhibitor led to {{the identification of the}} methionine-binding site. We present here the results obtained from the complex of MAT I with a competitive inhibitor of methionine, (2 S, 4 S) -amino- 4, 5 -epoxypentanoic acid (AEP), which presents the same features at the methionine binding site reported before. We have also analysed several complexes of this enzyme with methionine and ATP and analogues of them, in order to characterise the interaction that is produced between both substrates. The crystal structures of the complexes reveal how the substrates recognise each other at the active site of the enzyme, and suggest a putative binding site for the product SAM. The residues involved in the interactions of substrates and products with MAT have been identified, and the results agree with all the previous data concerning mutagenesis experiments and crystallographic work. Moreover, all the information provided from the analysis of the complexes has allowed us to postulate a catalytic mechanism for this family of enzymes.

Sodium sulphide treatment yielded (14), but prior reduction to (4, but Y=CHOH) then yielded (6), the first example of a dibenzo-fused thiophenophane. This scheme leading to (6) could have wide application.

Attempts to prepare (1, but m=CH=CH) were unsuccessful because of difficulties in synthesizing 2, 5 -disubstituted thiophenes of type (9). Some experiments towards the synthesis of (17) were made. Compound (18) was prepared by a 7 -stage synthesis and demethylated to (19). Oxidative demethylation of (18) and oxidation of (19) using various reagents did not give (2 O). The thesis concludes with an experimental section (90 pages) and a bibliography (226 references). [Numbers in brackets in abstract refer to chemical diagrams.

40|$|Algae inhabit a {{wide variety}} of both marine and {{freshwater}} habitats. These habitats differ in regard to various factors such as chemical composition, the organisms that live there, the light which may radiate into that particular area, the temperature of the sites depending on where the environment is located, just to name a few. One factor that varies from environment to environment is the salinity. This paper will look at the mechanisms utilized by marine algae to cope with the changes in salinity content in their habitats and most importantly how they use different osmolytes to carry out this process. Marine algae "osmotically adjust" themselves to external salinity changes, in a biphasic maimer. Firstly, this includes changes in turgor pressure or large internal water fluxes in response to osmotic gradients. Secondly. an internally regulated osmotic adjustment occurs with the use of both inorganic and organic osmolytes. Compatible solutes are ions and molecules used by man organisms to osmotically adjust and they play a double role in the process of osmotic adjustment. They act as osmolytes and also protect the cellular enzymatic activities under salinity stress. They are called 'compatible solutes" because they protect the cellular enzymatic activity. The main compatible solutes are polyols (including amino acids, carbohydrates and sugars). quaternary ammonium derivatives or tertiary <b>sulphonium</b> compounds. Certain species and taxonomic classes use specific compatible solutes and some even use combinations of them. Glycerol is an important compatible solute because it plays a major role with glycolysis and interactions with enzymes of the Krebs cycle. β-dimethylsulphoniopropionate (DMSP) is a compatible solute that is produced in large quantities by marine microalgae as an osmoregulator. This compatible solute has also been suggested to be a cryoprotectant in marine microalgae that inhabit the cold waters of the polar region. Therefore. microalgae utilize DMSP for both osmoregulation and as a cryoprotectant. Some algae. e. g. the genus Dunaliella and some Chlamydomonas species, have an enhanced tolerance to salt. These salt-tolerant algae are referred to as halophils and their salt optima in relation to their growth rate differs from the normal salt tolerant species. They are salttolerant because they have an extreme tolerance of low water availability. Special types of marine microalgae with a similar salinity tolerance inhabit the Great Salt Lake. There are two main metabolic pathways that marine algae utilize in order to osmotically adjust under salinity stress. The first metabolic pathway is termed hyperosmotic stress by which an abundance of enzymes is synthesized and then osmolyes are produced. where the cellular metabolism is reduced, reserve products are remobilized and redistributed within the compartments of the cell. The second metabolic pathway is termed hypoosmotic stress in which polymeric reserve products are utilized, synthesis of enzymes is inhibited. degradative pathways are inhibited and organic osmolytes are released into the medium to protect the cell from rupturing by increased osmotic stress. These pathways function together in synchrony to enable marine micro-algae to survive in their environment. ...|$|E
