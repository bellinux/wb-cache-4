[...] "Like most adolescents, Veronica understands and anticipates this mix, even if she doesn't always deal {{with it in the}} most effective way. Even if you don't want to pick sides, you're bound to be assessed as having done so. And once you're labeled—09er or not—you can either <b>spend</b> <b>your</b> time fighting rumors or finding alternative measures. Veronica, so precociously and brilliantly aware of alternatives, makes this familiar process seem worth pondering one more time." ...|$|E
500|$|Throughout 1941 and 1942 Gielgud worked continually, in Barrie's Dear Brutus, another Importance of Being Earnest in the West End, and Macbeth on tour. Returning, {{with more}} {{assurance}} than before, to entertaining the troops, he so far departed from his classical style as to join Lillie and Michael Wilding singing a comic trio. His 1943 revival of William Congreve's Love for Love on tour {{and then in}} London received high praise from reviewers. In 1944 he was approached by Ralph Richardson, who had been asked by the governors of the Old Vic {{to form a new}} company. Unwilling to take sole charge, Richardson proposed a managing triumvirate of Gielgud, Olivier and himself. Gielgud declined: [...] "It would be a disaster, you would have to <b>spend</b> <b>your</b> whole time as referee between Larry and me." ...|$|E

500|$|Throughout the war Tyrone Guthrie had striven to {{keep the}} Old Vic company going, even after German bombing in 1942 left the theatre a near-ruin. A small troupe toured the provinces, with Sybil Thorndike at its head. By 1944, with the tide of the war turning, Guthrie felt it time to re-establish the company in a London base and invited Richardson to head it. Richardson made it a {{condition}} of accepting that he should share the acting and management in a triumvirate. Initially he proposed Gielgud and Olivier as his colleagues, but the former declined, saying, [...] "It would be a disaster, {{you would have to}} <b>spend</b> <b>your</b> whole time as referee between Larry and me." [...] It was finally agreed that the third member would be the stage director John Burrell. The Old Vic governors approached the Royal Navy to secure the release of Richardson and Olivier; the Sea Lords consented, with, as Olivier put it, [...] "a speediness and lack of reluctance which was positively hurtful." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Call the Shots" [...] is a dance-pop and pop rock track {{written in}} the key of D major and with a {{moderate}} tempo of 126 beats per minute. Unlike previous singles released by the band, the song follows the verse–chorus form. The lyrics {{are concerned with the}} ending of a relationship, and opens with a repetitive melody followed by Coyle singing, [...] "Static tone on the phone, I'll be breaking again / Must be something better babe". As the chorus begins, the five members of the group trade lines and sing, [...] "Just 'cause you're raising the bet and call the shots now on me / It really doesn't faze me how you <b>spend</b> <b>your</b> time", with Alexis Petridis of The Guardian stating that [...] "only anterograde amnesia could wipe [...] from your brain". During the middle-eight, Roberts sings lyrics that were the inspiration for Girls Aloud's autobiography Dreams that Glitter – Our Story, released in 2008: [...] "I've seen life burn bright, seen it shimmer / Then fade like starlight to a glimmer, oh no / I've seen life flow by like a river / So full of twilight, dreams that glitter". Alex Fletcher of Digital Spy said that the instrumentation of [...] "Call the Shots" [...] was based on 1990s dance productions, and added that it incorporated [...] "oohs" [...] and [...] "ah ah ahs" [...] that [...] "reverberate around an infectious chorus," ...|$|E

500|$|B in the Mix: The Remixes {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from music critics. Kurt Kirton of About.com highlighted the remixes of [...] "Everytime" [...] and [...] "Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know", {{adding that the}} album {{would be better if}} it included more tracks. He summarized his review saying, [...] "this is a decent release that should please any Britney fan and most club music fanatics". Barry Walters of Rolling Stone said the album was [...] "even more redundant" [...] than Greatest Hits: My Prerogative, but added that with the exception of [...] "Toxic", [...] "just about every original track is bettered here". Spence D. of IGN said: [...] "If you had the choice to purchase only one Britney Spears' album, then this would be the one to <b>spend</b> <b>your</b> money on." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic commented that [...] "B in the Mix doesn't exactly erase the impression that Spears isn't in tune with her recording career". He also stated that on tracks such as [...] "Toxic", [...] "her flaws stand out just a bit too much [...] the instrumental hooks have been removed from the record, leaving Spears to carry the day—which she can't really do. [...] Overall this album sounds and feels like what it really is: a piece of product." [...] MTV writer Bradley Stern praised the album, saying it [...] "featured loads of excellent remixes stretching from [...] "...Baby One More Time" [...] to [...] "Toxic", but nothing shined quite as bright as the album's undeniable highlight: [...] "And Then We Kiss" [...] (Junkie XL Remix)." ...|$|E

2500|$|Speaking of the publicity, Lopez told MTV News: [...] "We try [...]" [...] "I'm {{not saying}} there's not times that we wish [...] {{could just be}} going to the movies and come out and there's not a crowd there waiting. You just want to <b>spend</b> <b>your</b> Sunday {{afternoon}} not working, {{but at the same time}} we both love what we do. If that's something that's part of it, then that's fine. We feel the love and we're very happy about it," [...] she stated. While speaking of the damage that could be caused, Lopez said: [...] "I think [...] if it's not a real thing. I've been in relationships where they were kind of unstable, and so the media messed with it a lot." [...] The overexposure from the media and public interest in their relationship resulted in less admiration for their work and negatively affected their careers.|$|E

2500|$|Gooch's {{commitment}} to England cricket and {{passion for the}} game remains. When commenting on the new England coaching role he said: [...] "It {{came out of the}} blue. I met Andy at Trent Bridge when I was working for radio and I was a bit surprised when he asked me to do it. But you <b>spend</b> <b>your</b> career trying to do your bit for England and when you're asked to help again the call of your country is special.". He has since remained as England's batting coach on a permanent basis, continuing this role for the 2010 series against Bangladesh and Pakistan, and the winter Ashes series against Australia in Australia. Double-centurion Alastair Cook (at the first test at the Gabba in Brisbane) hailed Gooch's influence on England's and his own batting prowess. Gooch subsequently has supervised England's batting (or 'run-scoring', as Ian Bell has noted Gooch refers to it) throughout their rise to number 1 in the Test cricket ICC Rankings. Prior to Gooch taking over, English batsmen had scored 6 test double-centuries in 15 years. 15 months after he became the batting coach, England had already beaten that total.|$|E
