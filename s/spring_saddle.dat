25|$|In the United States, the California Motor Company {{was formed}} in 1901 to sell {{complete}} gasoline-engine motorbikes in San Francisco, Oakland, and San Jose. The company began with a 200cc single-cylinder, 1.5-horsepower, four-stroke engine designed by R.C. Marks. Mounted to a standard bicycle frame, the California could reach speeds of approximately 25mph (40km/h). The California weighed around 75-80 pounds, and featured a leading-link front fork, a leather <b>spring</b> <b>saddle,</b> a front Duck roller brake, and an Atherton rear coaster brake. A leathern belt-drive directly connected the engine output shaft to the rear wheel. During the summer of 1903, George A. Wyman rode a 200cc, 1.5-horsepower California from San Francisco to New York City, becoming {{the first person to}} cross the North American continent aboard a motor vehicle.|$|E
5000|$|Wyman {{used his}} 1902 California machine for his {{crossing}} of the United States. The California had a , [...] four-stroke engine attached to an ordinary diamond-frame bicycle. Wyman's machine was equipped with 28 x 1.5 in. tires, wooden rims, a leading-link front suspension fork, a Garford <b>spring</b> <b>saddle,</b> a Duck Brake Company front roller brake, and a 1902-patent Atherton rear coaster brake. A leather belt-drive with a spring-loaded idler pulley directly connected the engine output shaft to the rear wheel. Using a standard steel bicycle frame, the California weighed approximately [...] without rider, and was capable of approximately 25 mph using the 30-octane gasoline of the day, {{with a range of}} 75 to 100 mi. Throttle control was not yet perfected, and engine revolutions were mainly controlled by means of a spark timing mechanism. The wick-type carburetor was crude, consisting of a metal box with internal baffles stuffed with cotton batting. With no float chamber, the rider had to open the gasoline tap periodically to admit fuel into the carburetor.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn this study, Three {{dimensional}} {{finite element}} analysis {{has been carried out}} using FEM based DEFORMTM 3 D software on hot forging of <b>spring</b> <b>saddle.</b> The influence of design parameter viz. flash thickness and process parameters viz. billet temperature, die temperature and friction coefficient along with their interactions are investigated for the responses forging load and billet temperature loss during hot forging operation using Taguchi's L 27 orthogonal array. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) is employed to determine significant parameters. It has been observed that optimal factor settings for each performance characteristic are different. Flash thickness and Billet temperature and interaction of flash with billet temperature are observed as the most significant parameters affecting the responses. In order to minimize two responses simultaneously, Grey Taguchi method is adopted and optimum factor levels have been reported. Optimization of the process parameters simultaneously leading to a low billet temperature loss along with a low forging load and it is also verified through a confirmation experiment for validation of these results. Confirmatory results prove the potential of Taguchi design of experiments, ANOVA analysis and Grey Taguchi method in Multi-objective optimization of process parameters...|$|E

5000|$|Although it {{was also}} known as the Light Roadster the engine was a well-proven 770cc V-twin side-valve {{four-stroke}} from Tottenham engine specialists JAP; Bat also offered 650cc, 964cc and 980cc options. The Bat No 2 also featured a specially <b>sprung</b> <b>saddle</b> to improve rider comfort on the poor roads of the time. [...] To raise awareness of the motorcycles, Tessier began serious competitive racing and achieved over 200 wins, setting numerous speed records. Bat also managed seventh place in the 1913 Senior TT. Production ended on the outbreak of the First World War. when the factory switched to producing munitions. Bat sold all their remaining stock of Bat No. 2 motorcycles to the Russian military but were never paid, so discontinued the No. 2 after the war.|$|R

5000|$|The Raleigh Bomber was {{a bicycle}} {{aimed at the}} boys/youth market which first {{appeared}} in 1981. Visually it resembled the Californian [...] "clunker" [...] bikes which were a homemade genre dating from the 1970s, primarily for use on the now legendary Repack downhill course. The Bomber had wide balloon tyres, a low slung frame and a <b>sprung</b> <b>saddle</b> with wide [...] "cowhorn" [...] style handlebars. Transmission was a choice between a single speed or 3 speed Sturmey Archer gears. Later, a Super Bomber was introduced {{in addition to the}} standard models. The Bomber was a highly unusual bicycle for its time, as it featured 559mm wheels with wide tyres, virtually unheard of in the UK until they became standard equipment on the ATB or mountain bikes which swept Britain a few years later.|$|R

50|$|Pedersen {{wrote that}} he {{developed}} the hammock style seat first. It provides suspension from road imperfections with much less weight, 4 oz instead of 3 lb of traditional leather and steel <b>spring</b> <b>saddles</b> of the day. Pedersen then developed a frame, a truss assembled from several thin tubes, around his new seat design. He attributed his inspiration to the Whipple-Murphy bridge truss. The design initially did not support seat height adjustment, and even after some adjustability was added, required the manufacture of eight different sizes. The non-standard frame design would not accommodate a traditional front fork. Instead, Pedersen developed a fork that also consisted of thin tubes assembled into a truss, which {{was attached to the}} frame with bearings at two distinct points, instead of through a traditional head tube. Pedersen also received patents for a chainwheel and bottom bracket combination and lightweight pedals.|$|R

50|$|They are simple, {{relative}} to other bicycles. They are all-steel single speed with 28 in wheels, fenders, fully covered chain, <b>sprung</b> leather <b>saddle,</b> rear rack and rod brakes (a handlebar lever connects directly to the brake pads), double stand (PA02 and PA06) or side stand (PB13). Like the Ford Model T, they are only available in one colour, black, except for the flare of vanilla at the fender tips. They can be equipped with a dynamo lighting set.|$|R
50|$|Edward Turner’s Triumph twin {{was a major}} {{turning point}} for the British {{motorcycle}} industry, as although a 500 cc parallel twin of medium capacity was not revolutionary, the 5T Speed Twin model was lighter than many contemporary singles with significantly more power and torque. Early models were only available in 'Amaranth red' with hand painted gold pinstripes to set off the chrome. Initially the one piece iron cylinder was secured with six studs which led to weakness, so these were replaced by eight studs. The two cylinders were fed by a single Amal Type 6 carburettor and many features such as the transmission and clutch were straight from the Triumph single. Originally with girder forks, the <b>sprung</b> <b>saddle</b> was the only rear suspension as the Speed Twin had a rigid frame - also from the single cylinder production line. On the night of 14 November 1940 {{the majority of the}} city-centre of Coventry was destroyed by German bombs and the Triumph factory (which was working on an order of thousands of military specification 5T's) was completely wiped out, and all of Triumph's technical records, drawings and designs were destroyed.|$|R
60|$|By {{this time}} the prince and princess had got a good start, and were feeling quite happy, when {{suddenly}} they {{heard the sound of}} a gallop far behind them. The prince <b>sprang</b> from the <b>saddle,</b> and laid his ear to the ground.|$|R
