40|$|Home-purchase {{lending to}} lower-income and {{minority}} households and neighborhoods has expanded significantly {{and at a}} faster rate than lending to other borrowers in recent years. Over the same period, however, an increasing proportion of applicants for conventional home-purchase mortgages, including lower-income and minority applicants, have had their applications denied. The first trend often has been taken as evidence that lenders' efforts to expand credit availability have been successful, whereas the second trend has contributed to concerns about access to credit and the fairness of the lending process. An important but little-recognized force behind the <b>shift</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> toward lower-income and minority borrowers has been a rapid expansion of activity by subprime and manufactured-home lenders, lenders who are oriented toward lower-income and minority households. Using data collected under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) from 1993 to 1998, this article finds that part of the growth in mortgage lending and most of the increase in denial rates are associated with the substantial and growing share of mortgage activity of institutions that specialize in subprime and manufactured-home lending.

In particular, the paper examines the dynamic patterns in the allocation <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> across large and small firms {{before and after the}} crisis. The data suggest that large firms, to some extent, are leaving banks and going to the capital market for their financing after the crisis. The data also suggest that profitable small firms are gaining easier access to the credit from financial institutions after the crisis. Is this shift (in the allocation <b>of</b> bank <b>credit</b> from large firms to small firms) due to lenders' choice or due to borrowers' changed incentives? The paper suggests that the improved lending practices of banks, at least partially, contributed to this <b>shift</b> <b>of</b> bank <b>credit</b> from large firms to small firms. ...|$|R

40|$|The flow of new {{bank lending}} to UK {{households}} and businesses fell sharply following {{the start of}} the global financial crisis in mid- 2007. That provoked an ongoing debate {{about the extent to which}} the sustained weakening of bank lending was caused by a fall in demand for credit, or a fall in supply. While it is difficult to disentangle the effects <b>of</b> <b>shifts</b> in <b>credit</b> demand and supply, this article finds evidence of a substantial and persistent tightening in credit supply conditions from mid- 2007. But independently weaker credit demand — probably associated with the impact of the global financial crisis — is also likely to have contributed to the weakness in bank lending. ...|$|R
40|$|The credit {{view is that}} a {{monetary}} tightening affects the real economy by shifting the supply schedule <b>of</b> bank <b>credit</b> left. While bank credit typically contracts following {{a monetary}} tightening, the financial contraction {{does not necessarily mean}} a <b>shift</b> <b>of</b> the supply schedule. Testing the credit view requires the identification <b>of</b> the <b>shifts</b> <b>of</b> the demand and supply schedules <b>of</b> <b>credit.</b> Using an original approach, this study shows that the credit view is supported for Japan. The credit view is, however, composed of two different views, namely the lending view and the balance-sheet view. While the balance-sheet view implies that the cutback of lending has no impact on the real economy, the lending view implies independent impacts of the cutback. Given the acceptance <b>of</b> the <b>credit</b> view, this study further attempts to test the balance-sheet view against the lending view. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{empirical evidence}} to support the theory that, in Italy, {{over the course of the}} past two years, even though a considerable slowdown in bank lending has been recorded, there has not been a credit crunch. After a first section dedicated to a descriptive analysis of the data, the paper presents an econometric estimation of the production sector’s demand for bank loans. An Error Correction Model (ECM) is used – estimated for the pre-crisis period (1998. Q 2 – 2007. Q 2) and applied both with the one and two step procedure – which considers lending as a function of the added value of the private sector, of the gross operating margin to nominal added value ratio (a proxy for self-financing) and of the real interest rate applied to loans. To test the robustness of the results obtained in the first specification of the model, we remove the assumption of weak exogeneity of the independent variables of the single equation model and construct a multivariate multi-equation model (VECM). All of the different approaches and methods adopted provided similar results: as expected, the demand for credit increases as real added value increases and decreases as the cost of lending and self-financing increase. The dynamic out-of-sample forecast of the model, relating to the two-year period of economic and financial crisis (2007. Q 3 – 2009. Q 2), shows that the actual loan stock remained well above the “theoretical” level forecasted on the basis of the functional relationships estimated before the crisis. This delta (which can be defined as “extra-credit”) is interpreted as the outcome <b>of</b> a rightward <b>shift</b> <b>of</b> the <b>credit</b> supply curve, rather than a leftward shift as would have happened in a credit crunch scenario. ...|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} differences in credit-card and debit-card usage between the United States and Japan. Although I do not doubt that {{social and psychological}} factors have some significance, I contend that four institutional factors also have useful explanatory power: the freedom of banks to enter the industry; the size of retailers; the level of telecommunications costs; {{and the size of}} the national economy. Generally, credit cards in Japan are used for a smaller share of transactions, with a higher average amount, and with less borrowing per transaction. The costs to merchants that take the cards and the rates of fraud also are noticeably higher in Japan than in the United States. The article argues that the difference in usage is attributable primarily to regulations that largely excluded banks and their affiliates from credit- card lending until 1992 and also, to some lesser degree, to the relatively small size of Japanese retailers. The article concludes that the differences in discount rates and fraud rates are more likely to be transient, but attributable to a combination of factors, including the comparatively small payment-card market and high telecommunications costs, both of which have hampered the sophistication of responses to fraudulent transactions. Debit cards are used quite rarely in Japan?the first general-use debit card was not introduced until the spring of 2000. Although that card is cheaper for the merchants that take it than credit cards, and also is much more resistant to fraudulent transactions, the article suggests that the debit card will not find as large a market in Japan as it has in the United States. The reason is that the <b>shift</b> <b>of</b> the <b>credit</b> card from its use as a borrowing device in the United States to its use as a near-cash payment device in Japan leaves a much smaller niche for the debit card in Japan. ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the impact of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) on mortgage pricing and to measure the GST <b>shifting</b> ratio <b>of</b> Australian <b>credit</b> unions. Design/methodology/approach - Using the proprietary data from 79 credit unions in Australia, we perform multivariate regression analysis on the effect of the GST on mortgage effective yield spreads and interest margins, respectively. We also introduce a model that is used to measure the GST shifting ratio. Findings - We document that the introduction of the GST in July 2000 led to the substantial rise in mortgage costs charged by credit unions in the post-GST periods. Overall, the GST alone contributed to the increase of effective yield spreads and interest margin by 65. 3 and 70. 1 basis points, respectively. As measured by the GST-shifting ratio, credit unions passed more than twice of the GST rate. This suggests GST over-shifting, and it is generally consistent with tax over-shifting literature. Originality/value - This is the first time the GST shifting ratio has been robustly measured with the use of multivariate models on mortgage costs.

40|$|A line <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> is one <b>of</b> {{the most}} {{flexible}} financing tools for companies.

Therefore the usage of stochastic models of dynamic systems for the research into optimizing the management of pharmaceutical products distribution companies taking into account <b>credit</b> payments is <b>of</b> great current interest. A stochastic model <b>of</b> the optimal <b>credit</b> strategy <b>of</b> a pharmaceutical distributor in the market of pharmaceutical products has been constructed in the article considering credit payments and income limitations. From the mathematical point of view the obtained problem is the one of stochastic optimal control where the amount <b>of</b> monetary <b>credit</b> is the control {{and the amount of}} pharmaceutical product is the solution curve. The model allows to identify the optimal cash loan and the corresponding optimal quantity of pharmaceutical product that comply with the differential model of the existing quantity of pharmaceutical products in the form of Ito; the condition of the existing initial stock of pharmaceutical products; the limitation on the amount <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> and profit received from the product selling and maximize the average integral income.
