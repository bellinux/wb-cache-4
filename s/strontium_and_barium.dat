5|$|Due to {{the large}} size of the heavy s-block elements, {{including}} strontium, a vast range of coordination numbers is known, from 2, 3, or 4 {{all the way to}} 22 or 24 in SrCd11 and SrZn13. The Ca2+ ion is quite large, so that high coordination numbers are the rule. The large size of <b>strontium</b> <b>and</b> <b>barium</b> plays a significant part in stabilising strontium complexes with polydentate macrocyclic ligands such as crown ethers: for example, while 18-crown-6 forms relatively weak complexes with calcium and the alkali metals, its <b>strontium</b> <b>and</b> <b>barium</b> complexes are much stronger.|$|E
5|$|Calcium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Ca and atomic number 20. An alkaline earth metal, calcium is a reactive pale yellow metal that forms a dark oxide-nitride layer {{when exposed to}} air. Its {{physical and chemical properties}} are most similar to its heavier homologues <b>strontium</b> <b>and</b> <b>barium.</b> It is the fifth most abundant element in Earth's crust and the third most abundant metal, after iron and aluminium. The most common calcium compound on Earth is calcium carbonate, found in limestone and the fossilised remnants of early sea life; gypsum, anhydrite, fluorite, and apatite are also sources of calcium.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{the simple}} oxide CaO, the {{peroxide}} CaO2 {{can be made}} by direct oxidation of calcium metal under a high pressure of oxygen, and there is some evidence for a yellow superoxide Ca(O2)2. Calcium hydroxide, Ca(OH)2, is a strong base, though it is not as strong as the hydroxides of strontium, barium or the alkali metals. All four dihalides of calcium are known. Calcium carbonate (CaCO3) and calcium sulfate (CaSO4) are particularly abundant minerals. Like <b>strontium</b> <b>and</b> <b>barium,</b> as well as the alkali metals and the divalent lanthanides europium and ytterbium, calcium metal dissolves directly in liquid ammonia to give a dark blue solution.|$|E
50|$|Essexites are {{generally}} rich in aluminium, alkalis (sodium and calcium), potassium (>3% K2O), LILE-enriched (<b>strontium,</b> caesium <b>and</b> <b>barium),</b> {{as compared to}} tholeiitic basalts and gabbros.|$|R
50|$|Alluaivite {{contains}} {{relatively high}} amounts of admixing <b>strontium,</b> cerium, potassium, <b>and</b> <b>barium,</b> with lesser amounts of substituting lanthanum and zirconium.|$|R
50|$|The ideal {{formula of}} {{strontianite}} is SrCO3, with molar mass 147.63 g, but calcium (Ca) can substitute {{for up to}} 27% of the <b>strontium</b> (Sr) cations, <b>and</b> <b>barium</b> (Ba) up to 3.3%.|$|R
5|$|Calcium, {{along with}} its {{congeners}} magnesium, <b>strontium,</b> <b>and</b> <b>barium,</b> was first isolated by Humphry Davy in 1808. Following the work of Jöns Jakob Berzelius and Magnus Martin af Pontin on electrolysis, Davy isolated calcium and magnesium by putting a mixture of the respective metal oxides with mercury(II) oxide on a platinum plate which {{was used as the}} anode, the cathode being a platinum wire partially submerged into mercury. Electrolysis then gave calcium–mercury and magnesium–mercury amalgams, and distilling off the mercury gave the metal. However, pure calcium cannot be prepared in bulk by this method and a workable commercial process for its production was not found until over a century later.|$|E
5|$|Consuming 75% of production, {{the primary}} use for {{strontium}} is in glass for colour television cathode ray tubes, where it prevents X-ray emission. This application for strontium is declining because CRTs are {{being replaced by}} other display methods. This decline has a significant influence on the mining and refining of strontium. All parts of the CRT must absorb X-rays. In the neck and the funnel of the tube, lead glass is used for this purpose, but this type of glass shows a browning effect due to {{the interaction of the}} X-rays with the glass. Therefore, the front panel is made from a different glass mixture with <b>strontium</b> <b>and</b> <b>barium</b> to absorb the X-rays. The average values for the glass mixture determined for a recycling study in 2005 is 8.5% strontium oxide and 10% barium oxide.|$|E
5|$|Plutonium {{can form}} alloys and {{intermediate}} compounds with most other metals. Exceptions include lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium and caesium of the alkali metals; and magnesium, calcium, <b>strontium,</b> <b>and</b> <b>barium</b> of the alkaline earth metals; and europium and ytterbium {{of the rare}} earth metals. Partial exceptions include the refractory metals chromium, molybdenum, niobium, tantalum, and tungsten, which are soluble in liquid plutonium, but insoluble or only slightly soluble in solid plutonium. Gallium, aluminium, americium, scandium and cerium can stabilize the δ phase of plutonium for room temperature. Silicon, indium, zinc and zirconium allow formation of metastable δ state when rapidly cooled. High amounts of hafnium, holmium and thallium also allows some retention of the δ phase at room temperature. Neptunium is the only element that can stabilize the α phase at higher temperatures.|$|E

50|$|An Am Star or metallic-line star {{is a type}} of {{chemically}} {{peculiar star}} of spectral type A whose spectrum has strong and often variable absorption lines of metals such as zinc, <b>strontium,</b> zirconium, <b>and</b> <b>barium,</b> <b>and</b> deficiencies of others, such as calcium and scandium. These abnormalities are due to some elements which absorb more light being pushed towards the surface, while others sink under the force of gravity. This effect takes place only if the star has low rotational velocity.|$|R
5000|$|The {{solubility}} {{in water}} of the other hydroxides in this group increases with increasing atomic number. Magnesium hydroxide Mg(OH)2 is a strong base as are the hydroxides of the heavier alkaline earths, calcium hydroxide, <b>strontium</b> hydroxide <b>and</b> <b>barium</b> hydroxide. A solution/suspension of calcium hydroxide is known as limewater {{and can be used}} to test for the weak acid carbon dioxide. The reaction Ca(OH)2 + CO2 [...] Ca2+ + [...] + OH− illustrates the strong basicity of calcium hydroxide. Soda lime, which is a mixture of NaOH and Ca(OH)2, is used as a CO2 absorbent.|$|R
5|$|The stable {{alkali metals}} are all silver-{{coloured}} metals except for caesium, {{which has a}} pale golden tint: {{it is one of}} only three metals that are clearly coloured (the other two being copper and gold). Additionally, the heavy alkaline earth metals calcium, <b>strontium,</b> <b>and</b> <b>barium,</b> as well as the divalent lanthanides europium and ytterbium, are pale yellow, though the colour is much less prominent than it is for caesium. Their lustre tarnishes rapidly in air due to oxidation. They all crystallise in the body-centered cubic crystal structure, and have distinctive flame colours because their outer s electron is very easily excited. Indeed, these flame test colours are the most common way of identifying them since all their salts with common ions are soluble.|$|E
25|$|The Australian Synroc (synthetic rock) {{is a more}} {{sophisticated}} way to immobilize such waste, and this process may eventually come into commercial use for civil wastes (it is currently being developed for US military wastes). Synroc was invented by Prof Ted Ringwood (a geochemist) at the Australian National University. The Synroc contains pyrochlore and cryptomelane type minerals. The original form of Synroc (Synroc C) was designed for the liquid high level waste (PUREX raffinate) from a light water reactor. The main minerals in this Synroc are hollandite (BaAl2Ti6O16), zirconolite (CaZrTi2O7) and perovskite (CaTiO3). The zirconolite and perovskite are hosts for the actinides. The <b>strontium</b> <b>and</b> <b>barium</b> will be fixed in the perovskite. The caesium will be fixed in the hollandite.|$|E

500|$|Calcium is {{considered}} to be an alkaline earth metal, along with these heavier elements and the lighter beryllium and magnesium. Nevertheless, there are significant differences in chemical and physical properties between beryllium and magnesium (which behave more like aluminium and zinc respectively and have some of the weaker metallic character of the post-transition metals) and the group members from calcium onwards, which traditionally led to [...] "alkaline earth metal" [...] only applying to the latter group. This classification is mostly obsolete in English-language sources, but is still used in other countries such as Japan. As a result, comparisons with <b>strontium</b> <b>and</b> <b>barium</b> are more germane to calcium chemistry than comparisons with magnesium.|$|E
2500|$|The {{thermodynamically}} stable form of CaCO3 {{under normal}} conditions is hexagonal β-CaCO3, (the mineral calcite).

The aragonite form can be prepared by precipitation at temperatures above 85°C, the vaterite form can be prepared by precipitation at 60°C. Calcite contains calcium atoms coordinated by 6 oxygen atoms, [...] in aragonite they are coordinated by 9 oxygen atoms. [...] The vaterite structure is not fully understood. Magnesium carbonate MgCO3 has the calcite structure, whereas <b>strontium</b> <b>and</b> <b>barium</b> carbonate (SrCO3 and BaCO3) adopt the aragonite structure, reflecting their larger ionic radii.|$|E
2500|$|Pure radium is a {{volatile}} silvery-white metal, although its lighter congeners calcium, <b>strontium,</b> <b>and</b> <b>barium</b> {{have a slight}} yellow tint.

Its melting point is either [...] or [...] and its boiling point is [...] Both of these values are slightly {{lower than those of}} barium, confirming periodic trends down the group 2 elements. Like barium and the alkali metals, radium crystallizes in the body-centered cubic structure at standard temperature and pressure: the radium–radium bond distance is 514.8picometers. Radium has a density of 5.5g/cm3, higher than that of barium, again confirming periodic trends; the radium-barium density ratio is comparable to the radium-barium atomic mass ratio, due to the two elements' similar crystal structures.|$|E

Locations where radiation fields once posed immediate mortal threats, such as much of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant on day one of the accident and the ground zero sites of U.S. atomic bombings in Japan (6 hours after detonation) are now relatively safe because the radioactivity has decayed to a low level.Many of the fission products decay through very short-lived isotopes to form stable isotopes, but a considerable number of the radioisotopes have half-lives longer than a day.|$|R
