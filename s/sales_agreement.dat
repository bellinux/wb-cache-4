5|$|Between {{the time}} of the initial <b>sales</b> <b>agreement</b> in November 1988 and the {{finalization}} of the acquisition of Pillsbury in January 1989, Grand Metropolitan set about putting its own corporate stamp on Burger King; the stated goal of Grand Met CEO Allen Sheppard was to upgrade the overall performance of the chain and improve its standing as the second largest fast-food burger chain globally. To that end, he had the company initiate a three-prong strategy of evaluation of operations, personnel moves, and structural changes and improvements to fortify the company.|$|E
5|$|In a 2005 Canadian dispute, Rogers Media and Newcap Broadcasting {{maintained}} a joint <b>sales</b> <b>agreement</b> pertaining to CHNO-FM in Sudbury, Ontario, but community {{interests and the}} lobby group Friends of Canadian Broadcasting presented substantial evidence to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission that in practice, the agreement was a de facto LMA, going significantly beyond advertising sales into program production and news-gathering. LMAs in Canada cannot be implemented without the CRTC's approval, and in early 2005, the CRTC ordered the agreement to cease.|$|E

5|$|On March 6, 2014, the FCC {{announced}} that it would hold a vote on March 31 on a proposal to ban joint sales agreements involving television stations outright, making them attributable to FCC ownership limits if the senior partner sells 15% or more of advertising time of a competing junior partner station in the JSA; the ban applies to both existing sharing agreements under such a structure as well as pending station transactions that include a JSA. Station owners would be given a two-year grace period to unwind or modify joint sales agreements in violation of the policy; coordinated retransmission consent negotiations between two of the four highest-rated stations in a single market would also be barred under the proposal. Wheeler also proposed an expedited process to review joint sales agreements on a case-by-case basis, granting a waiver of the rules if a broadcaster can prove a particular joint <b>sales</b> <b>agreement</b> arrangement serves the public interest.|$|E

25|$|The British {{did not ask}} {{to extend}} the Polaris <b>Sales</b> <b>Agreement</b> to cover the Polaris {{successor}} Poseidon due to its cost. The Ministry of Defence upgraded its nuclear missiles to the longer-ranged Trident after much political wrangling within the Callaghan Labour Party government over its cost and whether it was necessary. The outgoing Prime Minister James Callaghan made his government's papers on Trident available to Margaret Thatcher's new incoming Conservative Party government, which took the decision to acquire the Trident C4 missile.|$|E
25|$|In 1966, {{the museum}} {{relocated}} again {{to its current}} home on the South Park Blocks, at 1200 SW Park Avenue. The Society originally owned the full city block between Madison and Jefferson streets and SW Park and Broadway, but sold part of this property in 2014 when it sold the Sovereign Hotel. There is a large mural on this nine-story building called Oregon History, painted by Richard Haas that depicts the Lewis & Clark Expedition. Part of the <b>sales</b> <b>agreement</b> stated that both the building, built in 1923, and the mural would be preserved.|$|E
25|$|The Department of National Defense {{is working}} for the {{immediate}} delivery of at least 4 of the total 12 FA-50 fighter jets plans to purchase from South Korea. The Department of National Defense has begun negotiations with the Korean Aerospace Industries (KAI) while it is waiting for Malacañang's final approval of the <b>sales</b> <b>agreement.</b> It will be a government-to-government procurement that requires multi-year obligational authority from the Department of Budget and Management. After the confirmation of the <b>sales</b> <b>agreement</b> and the multi-year obligational authority from DBM, the formal negotiations can start and schedule the delivery of at least 4 fighter jets. The government is moving closer to acquiring 12 FA-50 fighter jets {{for the air force}} after the defense department’s Bids and Awards Committee (BAC) approved the terms of reference for the project. Once the terms of reference are approved with finality, the defense department could begin negotiations with the aircraft supplier, the state-run Korean Aerospace Industries (KAI). The negotiations are hoped to be finished by August. The negotiations were completed on Feb. 21, 2014. The Department of National Defense Special Bids and Awards Committee approved the offer of Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI) in a meeting that was held in Camp Aguinaldo. On Mar. 28, 2014, it was announced by the state arms procurement agency of South Korea that South Korea signed a US$420 million contract Friday to export 12 FA-50 fighter jets built by Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI) to the Philippines under a government-to-government deal.|$|E

25|$|Trident {{missiles}} are {{provided to the}} United Kingdom {{under the terms of}} the 1963 Polaris <b>Sales</b> <b>Agreement</b> which was modified in 1982 for Trident. British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher wrote to President Carter on 10 July 1980, to request that he approve supply of Trident I missiles. However, in 1982 Thatcher wrote to President Reagan to request the United Kingdom be allowed to procure the Trident II system, the procurement of which had been accelerated by the US Navy. This was agreed in March 1982. Under the agreement, the United Kingdom paid an additional 5% of their total procurement cost of 2.5 billion dollars to the US government as a research and development contribution.|$|E
25|$|Tyco Communications was {{announced}} {{as the winner}} on 7 March and negotiations were finalized on 14 April, as a turnkey contract {{on the condition that}} the cable could be financed. The main difficulty was that NSC, a foundation, had very little equity, and spent most of its cash on a US$300,000 detailed study for Tyco to advance the planning. Hannon Armstrong was selected as a financial partner and the money was guaranteed by the Ministry of Trade and Industry. The first work took place at Breivika: the land-owner was contacted on 7 May, a <b>sales</b> <b>agreement</b> was signed on 13 May, permits were finalized on 23 May, construction started the next day and the NOK5-million facility was completed on 25 July. Permission for the installations on Svalbard was granted on 17 June.|$|E
25|$|From {{the early}} days of the Polaris program, American {{senators}} and naval officers suggested that the United Kingdom might use Polaris. In 1957 Chief of Naval Operations Arleigh Burke and First Sea Lord Louis Mountbatten began corresponding on the project. After the cancellations of the Blue Streak and Skybolt missiles in the 1960s, under the 1962 Nassau Agreement that emerged from meetings between Harold Macmillan and John F. Kennedy, the United States would supply Britain with Polaris missiles, launch tubes, ReBs, and the fire-control systems. Britain would make its own warheads and initially proposed to build five ballistic missile submarines, later reduced to four by the incoming Labour government of Harold Wilson, with 16 missiles to be carried on each boat. The Polaris <b>Sales</b> <b>Agreement</b> was signed on April 6, 1963.|$|E

50|$|The vendor's {{intention}} was to sell their 544 acre of farmland. Unfortunately, the subsequent <b>sale</b> <b>agreement</b> was {{complicated by the fact}} that the 544 acres was on numerous titles, and by mistake the vendor's solicitors included in the <b>sale</b> <b>agreement</b> a title for a 12 acre block, on the mistaken belief that these 12 acres were the south western corner of the farm.|$|R

25|$|A European {{solution}} and the US UGM-73 Poseidon were also briefly considered, but ultimately rejected, primarily on capability, cost and uncertainty grounds. The clear favourite was the UGM-96 Trident I, which {{as well as}} being a cost-effective solution — given the US would also operate the missile in vast numbers — also delivered the overall best long-term capability insurances against Soviet advancements in ballistic missile defence. Subsequently on 10 July 1980, the then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher wrote to US President Jimmy Carter requesting the purchase of Trident I missiles on a similar basis as the 1963 Polaris <b>Sales</b> <b>Agreement.</b> However, following the acceleration of the US UGM-133 Trident II missiles, Thatcher wrote to US President Ronald Reagan in 1982 requesting the United Kingdom be allowed to procure the improved system instead. An agreement was made in March 1982 between the two countries, and under the agreement, Britain made a 5% research and development contribution.|$|E
25|$|An {{improved}} {{version of}} 'Fat Man' was developed, and on 26 February 1952, Prime Minister Winston Churchill {{announced that the}} United Kingdom also had an atomic bomb and a successful test took place on 3 October 1952. At first these were free-fall bombs, intended {{for use by the}} V Force of jet bombers. A Vickers Valiant dropped the first UK nuclear weapon on 11 October 1956 at Maralinga, South Australia. Later came a missile, Blue Steel, intended for carriage by the V Force bombers, and then the Blue Streak medium-range ballistic missile (later canceled). Anglo-American cooperation on nuclear weapons was restored by the 1958 US-UK Mutual Defence Agreement. As a result of this and the Polaris <b>Sales</b> <b>Agreement,</b> the United Kingdom has bought United States designs for submarine missiles and fitted its own warheads. It retains full independent control over the use of the missiles. It no longer possesses any free-fall bombs.|$|E
25|$|On February 11, 2014, Quincy Newspapers {{agreed to}} {{purchase}} WPTA from the Malara Broadcast Group {{as part of}} a deal to purchase Granite Broadcasting's stations in four markets (the other stations were KBJR-TV in Superior, Wisconsin and its satellite KRII in Chisholm, Minnesota, WEEK-TV in Peoria, Illinois and WBNG-TV in Binghamton, New York). The WISE-TV license would be acquired by SagamoreHill Broadcasting; however, WPTA (which would be acquired by Quincy outright, making it the senior partner in the Fort Wayne duopoly) would operate WISE-TV through a shared services agreement. In a presentation submitted to the FCC in August 2014, Quincy said that the existing joint <b>sales</b> <b>agreement</b> would be terminated, allowing WISE-TV its own sales staff, and that it would spend $2 million on {{the construction of a new}} studio facility at the WPTA site, after which both stations would produce competing live newscasts. In November 2014, the deal was reworked to remove SagamoreHill from the transaction; Quincy will now acquire WISE, with WPTA remaining with Malara.|$|E
