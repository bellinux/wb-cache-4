Multileaf alfalfa varieties have more than three leaflets per leaf, giving them greater nutritional content by weight because there is more leafy matter for the same amount of stem.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} was undertaken {{to study the}} establishment of lucerne {{on one of the}} drier soils of the Manawatu <b>sand</b> country. <b>Lucerne</b> has often been difficult to establish on these soils, yet once established grows well, possibly due to the large supply of water that {{is to be found in}} the water table a metre or so below the surface. Difficulty in establishing lucerne has often been attributed to shifting of the unconsolidated cultivated sand surface by wind, and also to the low moisture holding capacity of the soil. Lucerne stands are usually sown in the spring, but the available soil moisture may be quickly evaporated by the strong prevailing westerly wind at this time and wind erosion may occur, often burying plants with sand and leaving other young plants with their root systems exposed. Another possible reason for poor establishment of lucerne could be the high surface temperatures often experienced on the bare surface. The aim of the field study was to examine the effects of soil temperature, soil moisture and wind erosion on lucerne establishment. Subsequently, glasshouse experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of temperature variations in the soil and on the surface on the growth and survival of lucerne seedlings.

5000|$|A {{distinctive}} {{phase of}} building activity occurred from 1921 following {{the introduction of}} mud-brick manufacturing and construction techniques to the reserve. The technique was {{thought to have been}} introduced by two former inmates of the Purga mission (near Ipswich). The bricks were composed of a mixture of <b>sand,</b> clay and <b>lucerne</b> hay and were used to form walls. Squared and adzed [...] "bush timber" [...] was used for framing and corrugated iron was used for roofing. Buildings mentioned in Annual Reports from 1922 to 1924 constructed by this method included a [...] "native courthouse", dairy, soup kitchen, isolation ward, sewing room, boiler house, old men's dining room, new lock-up, school, [...] "an extra dormitory, 60ft x 20ft" [...] (18.29m x 6.1m), a number of mudbrick cottages (for inmates) and other [...] "unidentified buildings".|$|R
