Rationale An increasing need has been identified for a <b>stronger</b> <b>authentication</b> of the database maintainer upon database updates (addition, modification and deletion of objects). The existing authentication methods have serious security problems: the MAIL-FROM has the drawback that a mail header is very easy to forge whereas CRYPT-PW is exposed to message interception, since the password is sent unencrypted in the update mail message...|$|R

With development of technology, Tanzania’s administration of justice infrastructure has not advanced to keep pace with these changes to regulate their processes taking place in the modern age. Fortunately courts started to look toward integrated electronic Case Management Systems to cut down on quantity of paperwork and streamline day-to-day operations. However, these systems were old fashioned since less information security measures to guarantee <b>stronger</b> <b>authentication,</b> confidentiality, integrity and nonrepudiation were taken into consideration. Among the main challenges facing security measure implemented on Case Management System is the username-password authentication mechanism which is highly susceptible to social engineering attacks where a user may be tricked into revealing secret information used in authentication, hence leaving the system compromised. This study has considered digital signatures technology would be the best solution to the aforementioned challenges. It provides mechanisms to detect unauthorised operations on electronic case information by enforcing encryption and signature application which result in <b>stronger</b> <b>authentication,</b> confidentiality, integrity, and nonrepudiation. Analysis of existing information security model was performed, resulting in implementation guidelines for an advanced information security model and subsequently a prototype which utilises Digital Signatures technology...|$|R
5000|$|Cisco LEAP, {{similar to}} WEP, has had {{well-known}} security weaknesses since 2003 involving offline password cracking. [...] LEAP uses {{a modified version}} of MS-CHAP, an authentication protocol in which user credentials are not strongly protected. <b>Stronger</b> <b>authentication</b> protocols employ a salt to strengthen the credentials against eavesdropping during the authentication process. Cisco's response to the weaknesses of LEAP suggests that network administrators either force users to have stronger, more complicated passwords or move to another authentication protocol also developed by Cisco, EAP-FAST, to ensure security. [...] Automated tools like ASLEAP demonstrate the simplicity of getting unauthorized access in networks protected by LEAP implementations.|$|R
