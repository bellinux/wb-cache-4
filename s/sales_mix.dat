5000|$|Average prices represent, quite simply, {{total sales}} revenue divided by total units sold. Many products, however, {{are sold in}} {{multiple}} variants, such as bottle sizes. In these cases, managers face a challenge: they must determine 'comparable' units. Average prices can be calculated by weighting different unit selling prices by the percentage of unit <b>sales</b> (<b>mix)</b> for each product variant. If we use a standard, rather than an actual mix of sizes and product varieties, the result is price per statistical unit. Statistical units are also known as equivalent units. Average price per unit and prices per statistical unit are needed by marketers who sell the same product in different packages, sizes, forms, or configurations {{at a variety of}} different prices. As in analyses of different channels, these product and price variations must be reflected accurately in overall average prices. If they are not, marketers may lose sight of what is happening to prices and why. If the price of each product variant remained unchanged, for example, but there was a shift in the mix of volume sold, then the average price per unit would change, but the price per statistical unit would not. Both of these metrics have value in identifying market movements. In a survey of nearly 200 senior marketing managers, 51 percent responded that they found the [...] "average price per unit" [...] metric very useful in managing and monitoring their businesses, while only 16% found [...] "price per statistical unit" [...] very useful.|$|E

This paper explores the potential for and cost of further increases in domestic passenger car fuel economy using market-ready technologies and <b>sales</b> <b>mix</b> shifts. Using technology already included in manufacturers' production plans and based on consumers' willingness to pay for increased fuel economy, domestic auto mpg could be increased from the 1987 level of 27 mpg to 31. 6 mpg in 1995 without reducing vehicle size or performance from 1987 levels. By 2000, 34. 3 mpg can be justifed on the same basis. A higher level, 36. 4 mpg, is cost-effective, based on fuel cost savings over the entire expected vehicle life. The maximum level achievable with the technology included in this analysis is 39. 4 mpg, but this level would not be cost-effective. <b>Sales</b> <b>mix</b> shifts stimulated by price subsidies for efficient cars and surcharges on inefficient models can cause about I or 2 mpg of higher fuel economy before becoming too costly. ...|$|E

40|$|Reducing {{greenhouse}} gas (GHG) emissions {{is of great}} concern in Japan, as well as elsewhere, {{such as in the}} U. S. and EU. More than 20 % of GHG emissions in Japan come from the transportation sector, and a more than 70 % reduction in GHG emissions by 2050 has been projected as a feasible goal. It is clear that substantial reduction in GHG emissions from the transportation sector will be required in Japan over the next several decades. This research developed a fleet model for Japan to evaluate GHG emission trends through 2030 and through 2050. The fleet model shows that GHG emissions from light-duty vehicles are likely to decrease significantly due to anticipated decrease of vehicle kilometers traveled (VKT) from all the light-duty vehicles in Japan over the next several decades. This is because of several factors, such as the decrease of vehicle sales due to the recession and higher gasoline prices. In the analysis through 2030, the fleet model was run under four "sales mix scenarios," including a scenario which is based on the forecast by the Japanese Government. Even in the scenario without any <b>sales</b> <b>mix</b> change in the future, a 36 % GHG emission reduction from the level of 2008 is achieved by 2030. In the Government Scenario (the most optimistic scenario), a 49 % GHG emission reduction from the level of 2008 is achieved by 2030. In the longer-term analysis through 2050, the fleet model was run under two "sales mix scenarios" and two "vehicle fuel consumption forecasts. " In the most conservative case, a 54 % GHG emission reduction from the level of 2008 is achieved by 2050. In the most optimistic case, a 67 % GHG emission reduction from the level of 2008 is achieved by 2050. Even though substantial GHG emission reductions by 2050 are projected, coordinated policy measures would make the most optimistic <b>sales</b> <b>mix</b> scenario more feasible, and help realize further GHG emission reductions. by Eriko Nishimura.

In the case of incomplete information (only the distribution of the demand is known), we apply another research approach (partition graph) to determine the optimal bundle price.

In this paper, the magnitude, combinations and timings of the changes required in U.

Scenarios of future vehicle characteristics and <b>sales</b> <b>mix</b> indicate that the 2016 mandate is aggressive, requiring significant changes starting from today. New vehicles must forgo horsepower improvements, become lighter, and a greater number will use advanced, more fuel-efficient powertrains, such as smaller turbocharged engines, hybrid-electric drives. Achieving a factor-of-two increase in fuel economy by 2030 is also challenging, but more feasible since the auto industry will have more lead time to respond. A discussion on the feasibility of meeting the new fuel economy mandate is included, considering vehicle production planning realities and challenges in deploying new vehicle technologies into the market.
