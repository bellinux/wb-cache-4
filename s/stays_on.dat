The lower level tracks can only be reached by trains running to or from Jay Street–MetroTech since they do not connect to the IND Crosstown Line.|$|E

5|$|Hartebeest {{are remarkably}} alert and {{cautious}} animals with highly developed brains. Generally calm in nature, hartebeest can be ferocious when provoked. While feeding, one individual <b>stays</b> <b>on</b> {{the lookout for}} danger, often standing on a termite mound to see farther. At times of danger, the whole herd flees in a single file after an individual suddenly starts off. Adult hartebeest are preyed upon by lions, leopards, hyenas and wild dogs; cheetahs and jackals target juveniles. Crocodiles may also prey on hartebeest.|$|E

5|$|Another set of officials, {{the chain}} crew, are {{responsible}} for moving the chains. The chains, consisting of two large sticks with a 10-yard-long chain between them, are used to measure for a first down. The chain crew <b>stays</b> <b>on</b> the sidelines during the game, but if requested by the officials they will briefly bring the chains on to the field to measure. A typical chain crew will have at least three people – {{two members of the}} chain crew will hold either of the two sticks, while a third will hold the down marker. The down marker, a large stick with a dial on it, is flipped after each play to indicate the current down, and is typically moved to the approximate spot of the ball. The chain crew system has been used for over 100 years and is considered to be an accurate measure of distance, rarely subject to criticism from either side.|$|E
5|$|The 7.7million day {{visitors}} and 5.5million who made overnight <b>stays</b> <b>on</b> the Norfolk coast in 1999 {{are estimated to}} have spent £122million, and secured the equivalent of 2,325 full-time jobs in that area. A 2005 survey at six North Norfolk coastal sites, including Blakeney, Cley and Morston found that 39per cent of visitors gave birdwatching as {{the main purpose of}} their visit. The villages nearest to the Point, Blakeney and Cley, had the highest per capita spend per visitor of those surveyed, and Cley was one of the two sites with the highest proportion of pre-planned visits. The equivalent of 52 full-time jobs in the Cley and Blakeney area are estimated to result from the £2.45million spent locally by the visiting public. In addition to birdwatching and boat trips to see the seals, sailing and walking are the other significant tourist activities in the area.|$|E
5|$|The Ulstermen {{eventually}} rouse, {{one by one}} at first, {{and finally}} en masse. The final battle begins.

He enters the fray and confronts Fergus, who keeps {{his side of the}} bargain and yields to him, pulling his forces off the field. Connacht's other allies panic and Medb is forced to retreat. At this inopportune moment she gets her period, and although Fergus forms a guard around her, Cú Chulainn breaks through as she is dealing with it and has her at his mercy. However, he spares her because he does not think it right to kill women, and guards her retreat back to Connacht as far as Athlone.|$|E
40|$|We use micro {{data for}} England and Wales {{to examine the}} effects of class size on the {{decision}} to <b>stay</b> <b>on</b> in full time schooling at 16 and on wages later in life. We find that class size has a sizeable and significant effect on the decision to <b>stay</b> <b>on.</b> This finding is very robust. Wage equations show the effect of <b>staying</b> <b>on</b> is significantly positive for wages. Combining this with the effect of class size <b>on</b> the <b>staying</b> <b>on</b> decision, reveals that class size significantly affects future wages. Reduced form models lead to much less accurate and insignificant estimates. Copyright Royal Economic Society 2003...|$|R

5|$|The {{eggs are}} {{incubated}} {{for an average}} of 11days (range 10–16). Both adults incubate, although only the female <b>stays</b> <b>on</b> the nest at night. The chicks are altricial, hatching naked and with closed eyes, and are fed by both parents. They fledge about 11–12days after hatching, leaving the nest shortly before they are able to fly. They are assisted with feeding for a further two or three weeks. If the nest is threatened, the non-incubating bird gives an alarm call so that the sitting parent and chicks stay still and quiet. A male blackcap may mob a potential predator, or try to lure it away with disjointed runs and flaps on the ground. The blackcap normally raises just one brood, but second nestings are sometimes recorded, particularly in the milder climate of the Mediterranean and the Atlantic islands; triple brooding has been observed once, the female laying a total of 23 eggs in the season.|$|E

Instead, Ender joins the colony program to populate one of the buggers' former worlds. There, he discovers the dormant egg of a bugger queen, who reveals that the buggers had initially assumed humans were a non-sentient race, for want of collective consciousness, but realized their mistake too late, and requests that Ender take the egg to a new planet to colonize.|$|E

Between the two of us we came up with just this kind of groove, which <b>stays</b> <b>on</b> the same note as opposed to change, it's quite technical but it kind of added a bit of bounce to the song and it made it roll along in a much more fluid way. It was a bit mechanical before and it's just interesting how something small like that can really change the whole vibe of a song. It was just nice because from there on it was one of our favourite tracks and it almost didn't get on the record but it's now one of our favourite tracks.|$|E

25|$|Every tooth is {{connected}} to its surrounding bone by the periodontal ligament. The tooth receives its nourishment through this ligament. When a tooth is knocked-out, this ligament is stretched and splits in half; half <b>stays</b> <b>on</b> the tooth root and half <b>stays</b> <b>on</b> the socket wall. If these two halves can be kept alive, the tooth can be replanted and the halves of the ligament will reattach and the tooth will remain vital. The half that <b>stays</b> <b>on</b> the socket wall, since it remains connected to the bone blood supply, is naturally kept alive. However, the ligament cells that remain on the tooth root lose their blood and nutrition supply and must be artificially maintained. They must be protected from two potentially destructive processes: cell crushing and loss of normal cell metabolism. All treatment between {{the time of the}} accident and the ultimate replantation must be focused on preventing these two possibilities.|$|E
