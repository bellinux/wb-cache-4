In addition, the degradation on the damaged and undamaged parts was compared with a Vickers hardness test. Weibull statistical analysis {{was carried out in}} order to evaluate the reliability of the Vickers hardness measured data. Spalling of the edge portion occurred by degradation during use over a long period. Rough parts in the specimens were caused by damage because the <b>slitting</b> <b>knife</b> was used for 1 year. The friction coefficient and wear loss at the damaged parts of the knife edge were slightly larger from shock due to repetitive cutting operation. The Vickers hardness followed a two-parameter Weibull probability distribution...|$|E

40|$|A unique {{laboratory}} device, the Laboratory Shear, {{has been}} designed and built to simulate and examine the shear angle cutting process, which is the predominant method used in many cutting operations. The device is capable of force and velocity measurements of the shear angle cutting process with the abilities to vary cutting speed, knife preload, and blade geometry. The dimensions of the device are such that mobility to and from conditioning rooms in the laboratory environment are not limited. Assembly and disassembly ease as well as automatic versus manual operation options were incorporated for greater experimental flexibility. The device {{has the ability to}} evaluate products at a shear velocity of 200 inches per second, which equates to nearly 1000 feet per minute on a conventional slitter with 10 shear angle. The force measurement capability is 10 pounds, which is sufficient to handle the majority of Kodak films. Knife preload can be adjusted to provide preloads from 2 lbs to 12 lbs, in increments of 2 lbs. Debug of the Lab Shear Device was conducted and included knife sharpness measurement as well as calibration of the load cell and velocity transducer. The upper (moving) knife was found to have a cutting tip radius of approximately 0. 0002 inch and the lower (stationary) knife was found to have a cutting tip radius of approximately 0. 0001 inch. Both knives could be considered as 2 ̆ 2 medium dull 2 ̆ 2 based on the Kodak standard for <b>slitting</b> <b>knife</b> sharpness (X 3 ̆c 0. 0001 inch = sharp, X 3 ̆e 0. 0005 inch = dull).

5000|$|The {{minimum number}} of knife changes problem (for the {{one-dimensional}} problem): this is concerned with sequencing and permuting the patterns so as to minimise {{the number of times}} the <b>slitting</b> <b>knives</b> have to be moved.

5000|$|Winder {{constraints}} {{where the}} slitting process has physical or logical constraints: {{a very common}} constraint is that only {{a certain number of}} <b>slitting</b> <b>knives</b> are available, so that feasible patterns should not contain more than a maximum number of rolls. Because winder machinery is not standardised, very many other constraints are encountered.|$|R
50|$|Note that camber {{is often}} caused by <b>slitting,</b> where <b>slitting</b> <b>knives</b> extend the edge being slit. Outer edges left {{untreated}} {{usually have a}} shorter length than the inner edges being formed by slitting. The outer mults from slitting will therefore usually have camber, while inner mults frequently will not. Decamberers are cost effective when material is not laterally straight enough to suit a given process, and needs upgrading. Cambered material is usually lower in cost than straight material, and decamberers offer savings in these cases. Various types of decambering machines cater to wide or narrow materials.|$|R
50|$|The {{process is}} used {{because of its}} low cost and high {{precision}} for mass production. Some machines have a program that monitors the blades and sharpens the blades often to maintain the quality and precision of the cut. Depending on the industry and the product that is being slit these machine can run between 10m/min (special metal webs) and 5000 m/min (paper making process). The machines can also incorporate extensive automation to precisely control material tension, automatically position the <b>slitting</b> <b>knives,</b> automatically align the cores onto which the material is wound and to reduce manual handling of the rolls.|$|R

40|$|Aim: To obtain iris biopsy {{samples of}} {{sufficient}} {{quality and quantity}} for histopathological analysis using a novel punch biopsy technique. Methods: Two patients underwent iris tumour biopsy at an ocular oncology service. A trabeculectomy punch (Kelly Descemet’s membrane punch) with a 1. 0 mm diameter head and a 0. 75 mm deep bite was inserted through a clear cornea perforated by a SatinSlit 3. 2 mm angled <b>slit</b> <b>knife</b> into a viscoelastic-filled anterior chamber. The Kelly punch was placed over the lesion and pressed down before the punch was made. After obtaining the sample, the Kelly punch {{was removed from the}} eye and then opened over a dry cellulose sponge. Tissue samples were placed in 4 % formalin and processed routinely for standard staining with H&E, periodic acid Schiff and immunostains. Results: In both patients, by using the punch biopsy technique with the Kelly punch, we were able to obtain a 0. 860. 6 mm piece of tissue, large enough for any histological analysis. H&E staining showed spindle cell melanoma. Tissue sections, stained positive with MART- 1 (melanoma antigen recognised by T cells) and negative with cytokeratin, established the diagnosis of melanoma of the iris in each of these patients. Conclusions: Iris biopsy with the punch technique yields a tissue biopsy specimen, as opposed to cytology samples obtained by fine needle aspiration biopsy. This technique is quick, simple to perform and require...|$|R
40|$|AbstractCurrently {{technologies}} {{which are}} applied for leather cutting include <b>slitting</b> <b>knifes,</b> die press techniques and manual cutting. Use of laser technology has grown significantly during recent years due to number of advantages over conventional cutting methods; flexibility, high production speed, possibility to cut complex geometries, easier cutting of customized parts, and less leftovers of leather makes laser cutting {{more and more}} economically attractive to apply for leather cutting. Laser technology provides advantages in cutting complex geometries, stable cutting quality and possibility to utilize leather material in economically best way. Constant quality is important in industrial processes and laser technology fulfills this requirement: properly chosen laser cutting parameters provides identical cuts. Additionally, laser technology is very flexible in terms of geometries: complex geometries, individual designs, prototypes and small scale products can be manufactured by laser cutting. Variety of products, which needed to be cut in small volumes, is also the application where laser cutting can be more beneficial due to possibility to change production from one product to another only by changing geometry without a need to change cutting tool. Disadvantages of laser processing include high initial investment costs and some running costs due to maintenance and required gas supply for the laser. Higher level of operator's expertise is required due to more complicated machinery in case of laser cutting. This study investigates {{advantages and disadvantages of}} laser cutting in different areas of application and provides comparison between laser cutting and mechanical cutting of leather...|$|R

40|$|Conventional {{practices}} for nitrogen fertilization of corn produce soil {{conditions that are}} conducive to preferential water flow and nitrate leaching. A new fertilizer applicator is proposed that will more effectively protect the fertilizer from infiltrating water and thus reduce the potential for leaching. The device forms a small compacted layer of soil above the subsurface fertilizer band and then mounds soil into a surface dome directly above the fertilizer band. This new localized compaction and doming (LCD) method is evaluated by measuring soil physical properties around the fertilizer band and comparing them with measurements made within the conventional knifing system. The LCD applicator increased penetration resistance from 0. 50 to 0. 75 MPa at the fertilizer band. As the <b>knife</b> <b>slit</b> above the fertilizer band was closed by the LCD applicator, soil bulk density was increased from 1. 2 to 1. 4 g/cm 3 in the region. The ponded infiltration rate through the fertilizer band was reduced from 19. 7 cm/h at the conventional <b>knife</b> <b>slit</b> to 10. 1 cm/h at the LCD surface. Reduced water flow through the fertilizer band will result in reduced NO 3 -N movement. Nitrate movement was measured during a growing season in a corn field, and NO 3 -N applied by the LCD applicator moved approximately 60 % as deep as NO 3 -N applied by a conventional knife applicator. The ability to restrict NO 3 -N movement by modifying the surface soil at N application represents a simple yet effective strategy to reduce NO 3 -N leaching losses and possible impacts on groundwater quality...|$|R
50|$|To raise {{animals for}} the purpose of {{collecting}} their skin is called fur farming. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) alleges fur farmers are involved in skinning animals alive for their fur or skins. Killing tactics deemed brutal by PETA are also in concern. Many fur farms allegedly skin animals alive to keep the pelts intact from damage that could occur while killing them. To avoid bullet holes, tears or <b>slits</b> from a <b>knife,</b> fur farmers can use methods such as beating the animal, electrocuting them, using poison to paralyse them, or breaking their necks. Although these methods ensure an undamaged pelt, they are sometimes not enough to confirm the death of the animal, leaving the creature to be skinned alive.|$|R

40|$|Lithium-ion battery {{performance}} {{is affected by}} cut surface quality during the electrodes' cutting process. Currently, die cutting and rotary <b>knife</b> <b>slitting</b> {{have been used to}} cut prismatic and cylindrical electrodes, respectively. Both techniques, which require expensive tooling that wear out over time, result in process instability and poor cut quality. These will cause an internal short circuit and significant heat generation in the cells. Laser cutting, proved and widely utilized in the industry, can solve the abovementioned problems by improving cut surface quality due to many advantages, such as no tool wear, high energy concentration, fast processing speed, very narrow Heat Affected Zone, applicability to nearly all materials, and flexibility of laser power. Investigating underlying physical phenomena with numerical analysis provides significant advantages to fully utilize the remote laser cutting of electrodes for lithium-ion batteries. In this paper, a mathematic al model of three-dimensional self-consistent remote laser cutting is presented for anode (graphite-coated copper) of lithium-ion batteries. Computational and experimental results, obtained by using laser power of 450 W and scanning speed of 5 m s- 1, show a two-step melt pool geometry and copper composition increase on the material interface...|$|R

Hyperion is a hyperspectral imager scheduled to {{fly on the}} Earth-Orbiter 1 (EO- 1) spacecraft for the New Millennium project. The other payloads on the spacecraft are ALI (Advanced Land Imager) and AC (atmospheric corrector). The payloads were integrated into the spacecraft at Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC). An End-to-End imaging test was conducted at GSFC which demonstrated integrity of Hyperion performance after environmental tests. The performance characterization procedures described here include: crosstrack MTF, spectral and spatial co-alignment, spectral wavelength calibration, signal to noise, polarization, spectral response function and scene generation. The characterization was carried out with the TRW Imaging Spectrometer Characterization Facility {{which is based on}} a 250 watt QTH lamp, a monochromator, a collimator and a fine pointing mirror. A selection of narrow <b>slits</b> and a <b>knife</b> edge are illuminated at the exit slit of the monochromator for sub-pixel performance characterization parameters such as MTF. Special attention is devoted to the spectral calibration technique using rare earth doped Spectralon panels. This was the technique used at the End-to-End test to verify spectral performance of Hyperion after GSFC environmental tests. It is a particular useful technique when the optical test setup does not allow for the use of a monochromator. 1...|$|R
40|$|To reduce carbon emission, {{transportation}} {{sector has}} adapted lithium-ion battery-based hybridization {{of gasoline and}} diesel engines due to its efficiency, the availability of technologies, and nationwide infrastructures. To cut prismatic and cylindrical electrodes for lithium-ion batteries, die cutting and rotary <b>knife</b> <b>slitting</b> have been used. Both techniques have disadvantages such as tool wear, process instability, inconsistency of cut quality, and redesign of mechanical cutting processes due to various battery sizes. High speed remote laser cutting overcomes these disadvantages with characteristics such as contact-free process, high energy concentration, low noise level, fast processing speed, very narrow heat affected zone, applicability to nearly all materials, and flexibility of laser power. Optimization of key parameters, or power and scanning speed, has been presented for laser cutting of electrodes for lithium-ion batteries. An acceptable clearance width is observed. The line energy is defined as dividing laser power by scanning speed and spot size. A good quality of cut surface, with no defects, such as delamination, burrs, edge bending, or microsized material attachments, is achieved with line energies between 0. 8 x 10 (12) and 2. 5 x 10 (12) J m(- 3) for anode and 0. 31 x 10 (12) Jm(- 3) and less than 3. 5 x 10 (12) Jm(- 3) for cathode...|$|R

He is suddenly startled by the appearance of Billy, and hears Vicki scream outside, as the teenagers attack the car with axes. Coming to her rescue, Burt is attacked by Billy who is wielding a cross with a hidden knife inside, but Burt takes him down, and tosses the car keys to Vicky, letting her escape, though she is forced to kill one of the cultists with the crow knife. The couple manages to escape the town, though the car is damaged by an ear of corn stuffed into the engine as an engine light blinks, and Burt wonders out loud how no one else has found Jonah, unless it really is protected by a cruel and bloodthirsty God. The film then cuts from the car to a tremendous flock of crows flying as the credits roll, implying that the car might have exploded and killed Burt and Vicki.|$|R
