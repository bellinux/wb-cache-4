40|$|The present paper {{experimentally}} {{investigates the}} heat transfer enhancement of a microchannel heat sink <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> impinging jet. In order {{to evaluate the}} cooling performance of the microchannel heat sink <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> impinging jet, temperature distributions are measured by using a micro-thermal sensor array manufactured through simple and convenient microfabrication processes. Based on these experimental results, the thermal resistance of the microchannel heat sink <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> impinging jet is obtained and compared with the thermal resistance as calculated numerically. In order to show the heat transfer enhancement of the microchannel heat sink <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> impinging jet, its thermal resistance is {{compared with that of}} a microchannel heat sink with a parallel flow. Under the condition that the pumping power is 0. 072 W, the thermal resistance of the microchannel heat sink <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> impinging air jet is experimentally obtained to be 6. 1 ◦C/W, which is enhanced by about 48. 5 % compared with that of the microchannel heat sink with a parallel flow. In addition, the microchannel heat sink <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> impinging jet is shown to be superior <b>to</b> <b>a</b> manifold microchannel heat sink as a cooling device for advanced electronic equipment with high heat generation and compact size...|$|R

5|$|A concern {{from people}} living along the tunnel {{was that they}} would be subject to low-frequency noise. Originally the {{municipalities}} of Asker and Bærum had demanded that residents be <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> maximum of 27 decibel A-weighting (dBA), but the National Rail Administration appealed the requirements and was permitted to allow up to 32 dBA. In March 2004, a test was done in the tunnel to insure that the requirements would be met, as low-frequency sound is difficult to predict. Measurements after the opening of the tunnel showed background noise of 30 dBA, that no-one was subject to 32 dBA or higher, and that it was nearly impossible to measure the passing of trains.|$|E

No material was found either by the forensic examination of the scene or by the postmortem examination that would have linked a suspect to the crime.|$|E

5|$|Cavaliers can be <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> {{genetic defect}} of the femur and knee called luxating patella. This {{condition}} {{is most often}} observed when a puppy is 4 to 6 months old. In the most serious cases, surgery may be indicated. The grading system for the patella runs from 1 (a tight knee), to 4 (a knee so loose that its cap is easily displaced). If a cavalier has a grade 1–2, physical rehabilitation therapy and exercise may reduce the grading and potentially avoid surgery. The grades 3–4 are most severe where surgery {{will most likely be}} needed to correct the problem to avoid the development of arthritis and lameness in the limb.|$|E
