5|$|The {{dominant}} {{types of}} yeast {{used to make}} beer are the top-fermenting <b>Saccharomyces</b> cerevisiae and bottom-fermenting <b>Saccharomyces</b> pastorianus. Brettanomyces ferments lambics, and Torulaspora delbrueckii ferments Bavarian weissbier.|$|E
5|$|Baker's yeast or <b>Saccharomyces</b> cerevisiae, a {{unicellular}} fungus, {{is used to}} make {{bread and}} other wheat-based products, such as pizza dough and dumplings. Yeast species of the genus <b>Saccharomyces</b> are also used to produce alcoholic beverages through fermentation. Shoyu koji mold (Aspergillus oryzae) is an essential ingredient in brewing Shoyu (soy sauce) and sake, and the preparation of miso, while Rhizopus species are used for making tempeh. Several of these fungi are domesticated species that were bred or selected according to their capacity to ferment food without producing harmful mycotoxins (see below), which are produced by very closely related Aspergilli. Quorn, a meat substitute, is made from Fusarium venenatum.|$|E
5|$|Barley, in {{the form}} of malt, brings the {{condensed}} tannins prodelphinidins B3, B9 and C2 into beer. Tryptophol, tyrosol and phenylethanol are aromatic higher alcohols found in beer as secondary products of alcoholic fermentation (products also known as congeners) by <b>Saccharomyces</b> cerevisiae.|$|E
5|$|Some {{eukaryotic}} protozoa such as Leishmania {{major and}} Trypanosoma cruzi lack the RNAi pathway entirely. Most {{or all of}} the components are also missing in some fungi, most notably the model organism <b>Saccharomyces</b> cerevisiae. The presence of RNAi in other budding yeast species such as <b>Saccharomyces</b> castellii and Candida albicans, further demonstrates that inducing two RNAi-related proteins from S. castellii facilitates RNAi in S. cerevisiae. That certain ascomycetes and basidiomycetes are missing RNA interference pathways indicates that proteins required for RNA silencing have been lost independently from many fungal lineages, possibly due to the evolution of a novel pathway with similar function, or to the lack of selective advantage in certain niches.|$|E
5|$|The fungi {{have several}} {{unicellular}} species, such as baker's yeast (<b>Saccharomyces</b> cerevisiae) and fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe). Some fungi, {{such as the}} pathogenic yeast Candida albicans, can undergo phenotypic switching and grow as single cells in some environments, and filamentous hyphae in others.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of a}} Spanish {{research}} study to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of mushrooms, Rhodotus palmatus was one of 204 species screened against a panel of human clinical pathogens and laboratory control strains. Using a standard laboratory method to determine antimicrobial susceptibility, the mushroom was shown to have moderate antibacterial activity against Bacillus subtilis, and weak antifungal activity against both <b>Saccharomyces</b> cerevisiae and Aspergillus fumigatus.|$|E
5|$|Hygrophorus agathosmus is edible, but {{considered}} bland. A {{study of}} the antioxidant capacity of the mushroom was composed of at least five organic acids: oxalic, citric, malic, quinic, and fumaric acids. Using a standard laboratory test to determine antimicrobial activity, Hygrophorus agathosmus was shown to inhibit the growth of various pathogenic bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Salmonella typhimurium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Bacillus subtilis; it also inhibits {{the growth of the}} yeast Candida albicans and <b>Saccharomyces</b> cerevisiae.|$|E
5|$|Lambic, a beer of Belgium, is {{naturally}} fermented using wild yeasts, rather than cultivated. Many {{of these are}} not strains of brewer's yeast (<b>Saccharomyces</b> cerevisiae) and may have significant differences in aroma and sourness. Yeast varieties such as Brettanomyces bruxellensis and Brettanomyces lambicus are common in lambics. In addition, other organisms such as Lactobacillus bacteria produce acids which contribute to the sourness.|$|E
5|$|Microorganisms are {{essential}} tools in biotechnology, biochemistry, genetics, and molecular biology. The yeasts brewer's yeast (<b>Saccharomyces</b> cerevisiae) and fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe) are important model organisms in science, {{since they are}} simple eukaryotes that can be grown rapidly in large numbers and are easily manipulated. They are particularly valuable in genetics, genomics and proteomics, for example in protein production.|$|E
5|$|The yeast species <b>Saccharomyces</b> cerevisiae {{has been}} an {{important}} model organism in modern cell biology for much of the twentieth century, {{and is one of the}} most thoroughly researched eukaryotic microorganisms. It was the first eukaryote whose genome was sequenced. In the twentyfirst century, the filamentous mould Aspergillus has been adopted for genome studies.|$|E
5|$|Gene {{transfer}} between species {{includes the}} formation of hybrid organisms and horizontal gene transfer. Horizontal gene transfer is the transfer of genetic material from one organism to another organism that is not its offspring; this is most common among bacteria. In medicine, this contributes {{to the spread of}} antibiotic resistance, as when one bacteria acquires resistance genes it can rapidly transfer them to other species. Horizontal transfer of genes from bacteria to eukaryotes such as the yeast <b>Saccharomyces</b> cerevisiae and the adzuki bean weevil Callosobruchus chinensis has occurred. An example of larger-scale transfers are the eukaryotic bdelloid rotifers, which have received a range of genes from bacteria, fungi and plants. Viruses can also carry DNA between organisms, allowing transfer of genes even across biological domains.|$|E
5|$|Essential {{genes are}} {{the set of}} genes thought to be {{critical}} for an organism's survival. This definition assumes the abundant availability of all relevant nutrients {{and the absence of}} environmental stress. Only a small portion of an organism's genes are essential. In bacteria, an estimated 250–400 genes are essential for Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis, which is less than 10% of their genes. Half of these genes are orthologs in both organisms and are largely involved in protein synthesis. In the budding yeast <b>Saccharomyces</b> cerevisiae the number of essential genes is slightly higher, at 1000 genes (~20% of their genes). Although the number is more difficult to measure in higher eukaryotes, mice and humans are estimated to have around 2000 essential genes (~10% of their genes). The synthetic organism, Syn 3, has a minimal genome of 473 essential genes and quasi-essential genes (necessary for fast growth), although 149 have unknown function.|$|E
5|$|Eukaryotic cells {{exposed to}} DNA {{damaging}} agents also activate important defensive pathways by inducing multiple proteins involved in DNA repair, cell cycle checkpoint control, protein trafficking and degradation. Such genome wide transcriptional response is very complex and tightly regulated, thus allowing coordinated global response to damage. Exposure of yeast <b>Saccharomyces</b> cerevisiae to DNA damaging agents results in overlapping but distinct transcriptional profiles. Similarities to environmental shock response {{indicates that a}} general global stress response pathway exist {{at the level of}} transcriptional activation. In contrast, different human cell types respond to damage differently indicating an absence of a common global response. The probable explanation for this difference between yeast and human cells may be in the heterogeneity of mammalian cells. In an animal different types of cells are distributed among different organs that have evolved different sensitivities to DNA damage.|$|E
5|$|Several pivotal {{discoveries in}} biology {{were made by}} {{researchers}} using fungi as model organisms, that is, fungi that grow and sexually reproduce rapidly in the laboratory. For example, the one gene-one enzyme hypothesis was formulated by scientists using the bread mold Neurospora crassa to test their biochemical theories. Other important model fungi are Aspergillus nidulans and the yeasts <b>Saccharomyces</b> cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe, each of which {{with a long history}} of use to investigate issues in eukaryotic cell biology and genetics, such as cell cycle regulation, chromatin structure, and gene regulation. Other fungal models have more recently emerged that address specific biological questions relevant to medicine, plant pathology, and industrial uses; examples include Candida albicans, a dimorphic, opportunistic human pathogen, Magnaporthe grisea, a plant pathogen, and Pichia pastoris, a yeast widely used for eukaryotic protein production.|$|E
5|$|The Ascomycota, {{commonly}} known as sac fungi or ascomycetes, constitute the largest taxonomic group within the Eumycota. These fungi form meiotic spores called ascospores, which are enclosed in a special sac-like structure called an ascus. This phylum includes morels, a few mushrooms and truffles, unicellular yeasts (e.g., of the genera <b>Saccharomyces,</b> Kluyveromyces, Pichia, and Candida), and many filamentous fungi living as saprotrophs, parasites, and mutualistic symbionts (e.g. lichens). Prominent and important genera of filamentous ascomycetes include Aspergillus, Penicillium, Fusarium, and Claviceps. Many ascomycete species have only been observed undergoing asexual reproduction (called anamorphic species), but analysis of molecular data has often been able to identify their closest teleomorphs in the Ascomycota. Because the products of meiosis are retained within the sac-like ascus, ascomycetes {{have been used for}} elucidating principles of genetics and heredity (e.g., Neurospora crassa).|$|E
5|$|Yeasts {{have been}} used since ancient times to leaven bread and to ferment beer and wine. More recently, mould fungi have been {{exploited}} to create {{a wide range of}} industrial products, including enzymes and drugs. Medicines based on fungi include antibiotics, immunosuppressants, statins and many anti-cancer drugs. The yeast species <b>Saccharomyces</b> cerevisiae is an important model organism in cell biology. The fruiting bodies of some larger fungi are collected as edible mushrooms, including delicacies like the chanterelle, cep, and truffle, while a few species are cultivated. Mould fungi provide the meaty (umami) flavour of fermented soybean products such as tempeh, miso and soy sauce, and contribute flavour and colour to blue cheeses including Roquefort and Stilton. Moulds also yield vegetarian meat substitutes like Quorn. Some fungi, especially the fly agaric and psilocybin mushrooms are used for the psychoactive drugs that they contain; these in particular are the focus of academic study in the field of ethnomycology.|$|E
25|$|In {{sparkling}} wine production some winemakers select strains (such as one known as Épernay {{named after the}} town in the Champagne wine region of France and California Champagne, also known as UC-Davis strain 505) that are known to flocculate well, allowing the dead yeast cells to be removed easily by riddling and disgorgement. In Sherry production, the surface film of yeast known as flor {{used to make the}} distinctive style of fino and manzanilla sherries comes from different strains of <b>Saccharomyces</b> cerevisiae, though the commercial flor yeast available for inoculation is often from different species of <b>Saccharomyces,</b> <b>Saccharomyces</b> beticus, <b>Saccharomyces</b> fermentati and <b>Saccharomyces</b> bayanus.|$|E
25|$|Copper {{inhibits}} Actinomucor elegans, Aspergillus niger, Bacterium linens, Bacillus megaterium, Bacillus subtilis, Brevibacterium erythrogenes, Candida utilis, Penicillium chrysogenum, Rhizopus niveus, <b>Saccharomyces</b> mandshuricus, and <b>Saccharomyces</b> cerevisiae in concentrations above 10g/L.|$|E
25|$|The {{homologue}} to Wee1 in {{budding yeast}} <b>Saccharomyces</b> cerevisiae is called Swe1.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Saccharomyces</b> (sugar mold) yeast genus {{is favored}} for {{winemaking}} (for both grapes {{as well as}} other fruit wines in addition also to being used in brewing and breadmaking) because of the generally reliable and positive attributes it can bring to the wine. These yeasts will usually readily ferment glucose, sucrose and raffinose and metabolize glucose, sucrose, raffinose, maltose and ethanol. However, <b>Saccharomyces</b> cannot ferment or utilize pentoses (such as arabinose) which is usually present in small amount in wines as residual sugars.|$|E
25|$|Most {{species of}} yeast, {{including}} <b>Saccharomyces</b> cerevisiae, may be transformed by exogenous DNA in the environment. Several {{methods have been}} developed to facilitate this transformation at high frequency in the lab.|$|E
25|$|Genes {{similar to}} ERCC4 with {{equivalent}} functions (orthologs) {{are found in}} other eukaryotic genomes. Some of the most studied gene orthologs include RAD1 in the budding yeast <b>Saccharomyces</b> cerevisiae, and rad16+ in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe.|$|E
25|$|Similar {{tests were}} {{performed}} with a low-pressure (0.1–600 MPa) diamond anvil cell, which has better imaging quality and signal collection. The studied microbes, <b>Saccharomyces</b> cerevisiae (baker's yeast), withstood pressures of 15–50 MPa, and died at 200 MPa.|$|E
25|$|The best {{characterized}} endonucleases {{which are}} {{most widely used}} in research and genome engineering include I-SceI (discovered in the mitochondria of baker's yeast <b>Saccharomyces</b> cerevisiae), I-CreI (from the chloroplasts of the green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii) and I-DmoI (from the archaebacterium Desulfurococcus mobilis).|$|E
25|$|The beer is {{generally}} brewed from a grist containing approximately 60–70% barley malt and 30–40% unmalted wheat. The wort is cooled overnight in a shallow, flat metal pan called a coolship {{where it is}} left exposed to the open air so microorganisms may inoculate the wort. While this cooling method of open air exposure is a critical feature of the style, the key yeasts and bacteria that perform the fermentation reside within the breweries' timber fermenting vessels. Over eighty microorganisms {{have been identified in}} lambic beer, the most significant being <b>Saccharomyces</b> cerevisiae, <b>Saccharomyces</b> pastorianus and Brettanomyces bruxellensis. The process {{is generally}} only possible between October and May as in the summer months there are too many unfavourable organisms in the air that could spoil the beer.|$|E
25|$|There are {{structural}} and organizational {{differences in the}} Golgi apparatus among eukaryotes. In some yeasts, Golgi stacking is not observed. Pichia pastoris does have stacked Golgi, while <b>Saccharomyces</b> cerevisiae does not. In plants, the individual stacks of the Golgi apparatus seem to operate independently.|$|E
25|$|In 1996, <b>Saccharomyces</b> cerevisiae was {{the first}} single-celled, {{eukaryotic}} organism to have its entire genome sequenced. This sequencing helped confirm the nearly century of work by mycologists and enologists in identifying different strains of <b>Saccharomyces</b> cerevisiae {{that are used in}} beer, bread and winemaking. Today there are several hundred different strains of S. cerevisiae identified. Not all of the strains are suitable for winemaking and even among the strains that are, there is debate among winemakers and scientists about the actual magnitude of differences between the various strains and their potential impact on the wine. Even among strains that have demonstrated distinctive difference when compared among young wines, these differences seem to fade and become less distinctive as the wines age.|$|E
25|$|Possibly the world's oldest {{fermented}} beverage dating to 3,000 years ago, mead ("honey wine") is the alcoholic product made by adding yeast to the honeywater must, followed by {{weeks or months}} of fermentation. In modern mead production, the yeast, <b>Saccharomyces</b> cerevisiae, is commonly used.|$|E
25|$|The gene {{encoding}} the cytoplasmic PNGase {{was first}} identified in budding yeast, <b>Saccharomyces</b> cerevisiae and gene orthologues {{have since been}} found in wide variety of eukaryotes including mammals. In terms of the tissue distribution of the mouse Ngly1 gene, enzyme activities as well as transcripts were detected in all tissues/organs examined.|$|E
25|$|Actin {{has been}} one of the most highly conserved {{proteins}} throughout evolution because it interacts with a large number of other proteins. It has 80.2% sequence conservation at the gene level between Homo sapiens and <b>Saccharomyces</b> cerevisiae (a species of yeast), and 95% conservation of the primary structure of the protein product.|$|E
25|$|Anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{antibodies}} (ASCAs) are antibodies against antigens {{presented by}} the cell wall of the yeast <b>Saccharomyces</b> cerevisiae. ASCAs and perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (pANCAs) {{are the two most}} useful and often discriminating biomarkers for colitis. ASCA tends to recognize Crohn's disease more frequently, whereas pANCA tend to recognize ulcerative colitis.|$|E
25|$|The {{most widely}} studied origin {{recognition}} complex {{is that of}} <b>Saccharomyces</b> cerevisiae or yeast which is known to bind to the autonomously replicating sequence (ARS). The S. cerevisiae ORC interacts specifically with both the A and B1 elements of yeast origins of replication, spanning a region of 30 base pairs. The binding to these sequences requires ATP.|$|E
25|$|This {{level of}} {{biosafety}} {{is appropriate for}} work with several kinds of microorganisms including non-pathogenic Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, <b>Saccharomyces</b> cerevisiae and other organisms not suspected to contribute to human disease. Due to the relative ease and safety of maintaining a BSL-1 laboratory, these are the types of laboratories generally used as teaching spaces for high schools and colleges.|$|E
25|$|Molecular combing of DNA fibers {{can be used}} {{to monitor}} the {{structure}} of chromosomes in the budding yeast <b>Saccharomyces</b> cerevisiae. This provides DNA replication profiles of individual molecules. This requires that the yeast strains express thymidine kinase, which wild type yeasts so not, being fungi (see occurrence). Therefore. a gene for thymidine kinase must be incorporated in the genome.|$|E
25|$|Cell {{division}} cycle 45 (Cdc45) {{protein is}} a critical component for {{the conversion of the}} pre-replicative complex to the initiation complex. The Cdc45 protein assembles at replication origins before initiation and is required for replication to begin in <b>Saccharomyces</b> cerevisiae, and has an essential role during elongation. Thus, Cdc45 has central roles in both initiation and elongation phases of chromosomal DNA replication.|$|E
25|$|Outside {{the inner}} plate {{we find the}} outer plate, {{composed}} mostly by proteins. This structure is assembled in {{the surface of the}} chromosomes when the nuclear envelope breaks down. The outer plate in vertebrate kinetochores contains about 20 anchoring sites for MTs (+) ends (named kMTs, after kinetochore MTs), whereas a kinetochore's outer plate in yeast (<b>Saccharomyces</b> cerevisiae) contains only one anchoring site.|$|E
