40|$|Dressing seeds with {{pesticides}} {{to control}} pests {{is a widespread}} practice with important advantages. Recent incidents of bee losses, however, have directed attention to the emission of abraded pesticide-coated seed particles to the environment during sowing. This phenomena of drift of pesticide-dust can lead to pesticide contamination of air, water and other natural resources in crop-growing areas. This review article presents {{the state of the}} art of the phenomenon of dust emission and drift from pesticide seed dressing during sowing and the consequences thereof. To begin, we define pesticide seed treatment and present its pros and cons with focus on dust, dust emission and dust drift from pesticide coated seed. The factors affecting emission of pesticide-dust, (e. g. seed treatment quality, <b>seed</b> <b>drilling</b> technology and environmental conditions) are considered along with its possible effects. The measuring techniques and protocols and models currently in use for calculating the behaviour of dust are reviewed together with their features and limitations. We end by characterizing possible mitigation measures, such as improving the seed quality and the use of modified <b>seed</b> <b>drilling</b> technology, and present an overview of regulations and stewardship activities. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|In 2000, beekeepers {{from the}} Italian region of Friuli {{reported}} losses {{of a high}} number of bee hives during the spring season. At the time of this bee incident farmers in Friuli had started to drill their corn fields and some of the seeds had been treated with the seed dressing product Gaucho (active ingredient: imidacloprid). Reports by some French beekeepers on suspected impacts of seed dressed sunflowers on honeybees made some Italian beekeepers to believe {{that there might be a}} link between their bee losses and the use of Gaucho seed dressing on corn seed. During drilling, dust particles are emitted by the pneumatic <b>seed</b> <b>drilling</b> ma-chines which may also contain abraded seed dressing particles. In response to this concern, further investigations were conducted to examine whether corn crops, seed-treated with Gaucho will pose a risk to honey bees. In October 2001 and June 2002, two field trials were conducted in Germany with Italian and German commercial maize seeds to investigate the possible abrasion of Gaucho from seed-treated maize during sowing with a pneumatic drilling machine. The results show an average emission rate of only 4 % on the <b>seed</b> <b>drilling</b> rate with a standard dressing formulation. Formulations with adjuvants diminished abrasions even more. In parallel, a replicated cage test with honey bees was conducted to examine whether the recorded abrasion rates could ad-versely affect honeybee colonies foraging on flowering plants with simulated deposits of emitted dust particles. From the findings of this replicated cage study it can be concluded that deposition rates which were much higher than those potentially emitted fro...|$|E

Around the turn to the 20 th century, two very different precision seed drill methods were developed almost at the same time. Band seeding made it possible to achieve nearly perfect single grain sowing. For this purpose, individual, equally spaced seeds were embedded into bands of paper or cotton. In the field, these seed tapes were then unreeled from large drums. The pneumatic system proposed in 1897, by contrast, introduced grain singling using a vacuum for the first time. Although band seeding presented a satisfactory technological solution, it was never widely applied. Pneumatic systems, on the other hand, took long to catch on and only started to be successful in the late 1960 s. Up to then, these innovative systems had to be considered as failures.

30|$|Neonicotinoids This {{group of}} highly {{effective}} insecticides {{have been widely}} used in the past 20  years for seed treatment (seed coatings). These “systemic” active substances are taken up by the seedling, offering protection against sucking insects and some chewing insects. In 2008, the spread of abrasion dust from coated seeds spread by pneumatic <b>seed</b> <b>drilling</b> equipment led to a massive poisoning of bee colonies in south-western Germany [16]. The importance of the airborne distribution of abrasion dust had been underestimated in the EU approval for the active substances and in PPP testing. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) reassessed the risk of the main neonicotinoids for honey bees and wild pollinators (e.g., bumble bees) {{in the light of the}} new scientific findings and found serious gaps in the data—in particular concerning long-term toxicity. For many applications, EFSA concluded that an unacceptable risk was indicated or could not be excluded. As a consequence, the EU Commission banned these critical applications in 2013 and called on the producers to provide the missing data [17]. It remains to be seen what decisions will be reached by the EFSA, the EU Commission and the national authorities on the basis of the data that is provided and in consideration of the massive criticism of this group of substances by scientists [18] and environmental and nature conservation associations (e.g., [19]).|$|E

40|$|Declining sown pasture {{productivity}} as {{a result}} of a tie-up in plant available soil nitrogen is an ongoing constraint to grazing production across the brigalow bioregion of central and southern Queensland. Research suggests that legume establishment offers the most cost effective long-term remediation strategy for improving pasture quality and yield. Within southern Queensland, medics (Medicago spp.) can provide valuable winter contributions to dietary protein and soil nitrogen, however establishment and yields are frequently poor and soil phosphorus often limiting. An experiment was established across two soil types (brigalow clay and poplar box red loam) 70 km north of Goondiwindi, Queensland to investigate the effects of sowing method, weed control and phosphorus fertiliser application on the establishment and yield of a mix of three medic cultivars (Medicago truncatula cv. Jester & cv. Caliph and Medicago orbicularis cv. Bindaroo Gold). On both soil types, plant population and biomass were significantly improved via direct drilling of seed as compared to broadcasting. On the loam, drilling increased average populations by between 519 and 1, 900 % above those recorded in broadcast treatments and improved biomass by between 144 and 315 %. On the clay soil, drilling increased populations by between 339 and 983 % above those measured in broadcast treatments. Clay soil drilling showed biomass improvements of between 124 and 1, 368 %. No significant biomass or legume population treatment effects were observed on the clay soil. No significant treatment effects were observed for yield on the loam soil.

Methods The experiment was conducted on the farm of Shandong Agricultural University, Tai’an, China, using large-spike (Shannong 8355 and Lankao Aizao 8) and multiple-spike (Jimai 20 and Lumai 14) cultivars. Broadcast and <b>seed</b> <b>drilling</b> (row spacing of 30, 25, 20 and 15 cm) treatments were used in a randomized complete block design with three replications. Every treatment added dibble seeding with 30 cm plant spacing. Plot area is 8 m 2. Important findings The two types have higher tillering ability with dibble seeding, but there are significant differences in spike number and spike rate. Canopy microclimate has greater influence on the two types than do genetic factors. The large-spike cultivar has a higher degree of response on the colony environment than the multiple-spike cultivar. Canopy structure can be effectively controlled by seeding mode. Drilling makes significantly higher economic yield than broadcast seeding. The degree of response to row spacing differs among the varieties. It is suggested that a suitable combination of cultivar and row spacing could effectively increase grain yield, with the row spacing 23. 4 – 23. 9 cm for multiple-spike cultivars and 16. 5 – 16. 9 cm for large-spike cultivars.

Two pots of each group were range or minimum-till “drilled” 32 (using an auger) or broadcast, then singed with a heat lamp to simulate a light burn. BSC development and seeding treatment had significant effects on plant germination and fitness. Intact crust decreased cheatgrass germination while drilling improved its germination and fitness. Minimum-till drilling generally supported the best germination and fitness in all species. Range drilling and broadcast seeding were often surprisingly similar in their effect on grasses. Germination and fitness for both forbs were greater when broadcast compared to range drilling. More developed BSC supported greater germination and fitness across native species. Tall-moss often supported the fittest plants, but tended to have lower germination rates. Minimum-till drilling often resulted in lessened BSC group effect (e. g. no height difference in M 2 -M 4) while range drilling tended to accentuate BSC group effects (e. g. taller plants with more developed BSC).

All measured crop properties were strongly affected by different seasons, especially with the season of 2003 with extreme drought. Crop biomass in five growth stages for winter wheat showed that at the beginning DS and CH had stronger growth than CT and NT, but differences vanished toward final stages. Winter wheat grain yield achieved by reduced tillage systems was in average either higher (CH= 5. 59 t ha − 1) or not different (5. 38 and 5. 23 t ha − 1 for DS and NT, respectively) than CT (5. 28 t ha − 1). Soybean growth was consistently the most impaired at NT system, especially at the full maturity stage, where also DS and CH had lower biomass than CT.

We found coarse- and fine-scale social and political opinions were associated with all post-wildfire management decisions, often creating perceived barriers to project implementation. Conversely, local citizens were more supportive of projects than managers perceived them to be. While the majority of managers and citizens supported the concept of incorporating experimental research, managers were less able to consider more specific research incorporation into actual projects.

40|$|Interest {{in various}} forms of reduced tillage is {{steadily}} increasing, in line with today’s high machinery and fuel costs and increasing awareness of harmful effects of soil compaction. Reduced tillage in its various forms does, however, place higher proportions of coarse aggregates and greater quantities of plant residues. In the summer of 1995, the Väderstad Concorde underwent evaluation in field trials. The Väderstad Concorde is essentially a seedbed harrow with a seed hopper installed above it. The seed is fed pneumatically, with each harrow tine functioning as a seed coulter. Depth control is achieved using a wheel which follows the contour of the land, transmitting control signals to the hydraulics unit to raise or lower the machine as required. The Concorde was developed to allow farmers {{to reduce the number}} of machinery passes required. The trails encompassed spring drilling (With different numbers of harrow passes and various drilling depth), and involved studies of the bottom of the drill and the seedbed itself to investigate seed placement, the size distribution of aggregates and the moisture content of the bottom of the drill and the rest of the seedbed. During the growing season there followed monitoring of the number of plants, shoots (tillers) and ears, and of yields. The number of weeds at the various stages of growth was also investigated. Another aspect of these trials involved drilling nitrogen fertilizer amongst growing autumn wheat in the spring (drilled both along and across the direction of <b>seed</b> <b>drilling).</b> In spring drilling, an implement with Crosskill rollers was used after the Concorde. The result showed that seed placement after the Concorde in spring drilling was good, with, at lowest, 96 % of seed placed at the bottom of the drill. The number of plants per square metre after the Concorde was higher where no prior harrowing had taken place. This indicates that harrowing prior to drilling does not improve the result, provided that the field has been harrowed in the autumn or levelled. In the trail crops which had not been harrowed prior to drilling, pressure on the crop from weeds was lower than in the crops which had been harrowed twice before drilling. The harvest result also indicated that a reduced number of harrow passes before drilling with Concorde produced increased yields. Drilling nitrogen fertiliser in autumn wheat produced increased yields when compared with topdressing, in spite of the fact that a great deal of precipitation fell on the following night. It is difficult to determine whether the increased yield was a result of the tillage effect or the placement of the fertiliser. Even greater effects are probably to be expected if rain does not fall on the crop immediately after the fertiliser is drilled in this way...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2007 Restoration of invaded aridlands is {{required}} to reduce the exorbitant ecological and monetary losses related to noxious weeds. An understanding of how reduced and increased levels of soil N and P influence interference between medusahead and squirreltail is imperative to understanding how squirreltail {{may be used in}} restoration of medusahead infested rangelands. Medusahead (Taeniatherum caput-medusae ssp. asperum (Simk.) Melderis) is an invasive, nonnative, annual grass that is rapidly displacing desirable rangeland plants in western North America. Evidence suggests that the native, perennial bunchgrass squirreltail (Elymus elymoides (Raf.) Swezey) may be able to displace medusahead under certain conditions, but the role of soil nutrients in this process is not well understood. I performed interference and growth analysis studies in a greenhouse to determine if soil nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) alter interference between medusahead and squirreltail. In both studies, plants were grown in pots containing a one-to-one mixture of sand and field soil from a site containing medusahead and squirreltail. In the interference experiment, medusahead and squirreltail were Redacted for privacy planted in density combinations of 0, 1, 5, 25, and 125 seeds per species per pot at four levels of N and P (loNloP, loNhiP, hiNloP, hiNhiP). Results indicated that medusahead and squirreltail competed for N. Increased soil N reduced medusahead and squirreltail's relative competitive abilities largely due to reductions in the intensity of intraspecific interference. High N also reduced the effect of medusahead density on squirreltail biomass. Soil P levels had little influence on predicted species aboveground growth or relative competitive ability. In the growth analysis experiment, plant growth, growth rates, and relative growth rates for above- and belowground biomass, total biomass, leaf area, total root length, and depth of root penetration of isolated individuals were recorded for harvested plants at 2 -week intervals over a 70 -day period. Results indicated that medusahead produced more absolute belowground biomass, aboveground biomass, total biomass, leaf area, and root length and had higher growth rates for these parameters than squirreltail. Squirreltail allocated more of its acquired resources to belowground growth endowing it with greater root: shoot ratios. Medusahead relative growth rates decreased in belowground biomass, aboveground biomass, total biomass, leaf area, and root length {{over the course of the}} study period, while squirreltail's relative growth rate for leaf area remained constant; however, medusahead still maintained higher relative leaf area growth rates during the experiment. Results from the growth analysis study matched results from the interference study in that medusahead was found to be a superior competitor over squirreltail for environmental resources. In order to understand the full benefits of squirreltail's relatively higher allocation of biomass to belowground growth, a long-term study would be necessary. A long-term study would allow for the differences in perennial versus annual resource allocation patterns to manifest themselves to their fullest extent. Over time and with consistently low nutrient availability, squirreltail might increase in medusahead infested rangelands. The maintenance of continually low levels of nutrient availability combined with a reduction of medusahead competition are prerequisites for reclamation of medusahead infested rangelands. Maintaining soil N at very low levels, over the long term, may diminish medusahead seed banks to low enough levels that squirreltail can increase and slowly replace medusahead. Competition between medusahead and squirreltail seedlings will likely be won by medusahead, but seedling-to- mature plant competition may be won by squirreltail. It appears that management inputs, e. g., <b>seed</b> <b>drilling,</b> herbicides, and best management practices that maintain low N availability, will be required to allow native perennials to firmly establish in invasive annual weed infested rangelands...|$|E
