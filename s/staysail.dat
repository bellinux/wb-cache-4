5|$|The British fleet was {{anchored}} off The Rock on 10December 1796 when a storm blew up. Culloden {{was obliged}} {{to get under way}} when her anchors failed to hold, narrowly missing Pearl Rock in the process, and at 21:00, Gibraltar was forced to cut her cable. As she was attempting to get clear of Cabrita Point at 22:00, her fore topmast snapped and her foresail, mainsail, main topmast <b>staysail,</b> and mizzen <b>staysail</b> tore. Having already lost her main topsail, she became difficult to handle and struck the sandbank several times before being blown across it. By midnight Gibraltar was out of danger and able to ride out the storm, and the next day at noon she anchored in Tangier Bay. The damage incurred during the storm necessitated her being sent to Plymouth in January 1797. During the repairs, which took until April and cost £12,818, a large piece of rock was removed from her hull. Gibraltar returned to the Mediterranean in July 1797 under Captain William Hancock Kelly.|$|E
5|$|By mid-December the ship's {{supply of}} flour and butter for the voyage had been {{exhausted}} and Philip authorised Mason to broach the stores {{set aside for}} the future colony in order to continue to feed the convicts. A month later, on 20 January 1788, Prince of Wales reached Australia's Botany Bay. Six days later she sailed for Sydney Cove as part of the relocation of the convict settlement to Port Jackson. Leaving Botany Bay she collided with Friendship, losing her mainmast <b>staysail</b> and topsail, but the damage was swiftly repaired and she was able to enter Port Jackson in line with her fellow transports. There she landed 49 convicts, 31 marines and 23 civilians.|$|E
25|$|The brig's {{foremast}} {{is smaller}} than the main mast. The fore mast holds a fore sail, fore top sail, fore top gallant sail, and fore royal. Between the fore mast and the bowsprit are the fore <b>staysail,</b> jib, and flying jib. All the yards are manipulated by a complicated arrangement of cordage named the running rigging. This is opposed to the standing rigging which is fixed, and keeps mast and other objects rigid.|$|E
50|$|Most <b>staysails</b> are triangular, however {{some are}} four-cornered, notably some fisherman's <b>staysails.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A brig has two masts, both square-rigged. In {{addition}} to jibs and <b>staysails</b> (stays'ls) before the foremast and <b>staysails</b> between the masts, {{there is a}} gaff-rigged fore-and-aft sail, called a [...] "spanker" [...] or a [...] "kicker" [...] or sometimes a [...] "mizzen". This sail occupies the lower [...] to [...] of the main or aftermost mast, with sqares'ls above.|$|R
50|$|All {{the above}} rigs {{normally}} carry {{a number of}} jibs and generally carry fore-and-aft <b>staysails</b> between the masts.|$|R
25|$|To {{address these}} issues, Grampus, {{although}} similar in design {{to the traditional}} New England schooner, also differed in significant ways. She had a hull about two feet (0.6 meter) deeper than traditional schooners of similar length, giving her greater stability. She had a straight stem, rather than a raking one, and her stern was narrower and more raked, with her after portion approximating a V-shape, all changes which increased her hull length at the waterline. Her foremast was considerably shorter than her mainmast, and her rigging was designed {{so that she could}} carry a double-headed rig forward that allowed her to use a smaller jib that could be furled upon the approach of heavy weather and a fore <b>staysail</b> running from the foremast to near her stem. The result was a ship able to achieve higher sailing speeds, able to make more efficient use of her sails, with no need for crew members to work on her bowsprit during bad weather, and less likely to capsize in heavy seas.|$|E
500|$|American (Delaware River yard no. 308) was {{launched}} on 14 July 1900, and delivered to American-Hawaiian in October, joining Californian in the American-Hawaiian Fleet. American, {{the first of}} the trio of Pennsylvania ships to be completed, was , and was [...] in length and [...] abeam. She had a deadweight tonnage of , and her cargo holds had a storage capacity of [...] American had a speed of , and was powered by a single triple-expansion steam engine with coal-fired boilers, that drove a single screw propeller. American and her sister ships, equipped with two upright masts, carried and used two large trysails, a fore <b>staysail</b> and jib, and a main <b>staysail,</b> to help conserve coal for their journeys.|$|E
2500|$|The cutter {{is similar}} to a sloop with a single mast and mainsail, but {{generally}} carries the mast further aft to allow for [...] a jib and <b>staysail</b> to be attached to the head stay and inner forestay, respectively. Once a common racing configuration, today it gives versatility to cruising boats, especially in allowing a small <b>staysail</b> to be flown from the inner stay in high winds.|$|E
50|$|Jibs {{that are}} not roller-furling usually have hanks, clips that attach to the stay. This applies to other <b>staysails,</b> as well.|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} extra is the spinnaker. Other extras include {{studding}} sails, the modern spanker (or tallboy), and some <b>staysails</b> and topsails.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Pears {{to me to}} have a jurymast rigged {{upon his}} back, and fore and main <b>staysails</b> set under each of his arms," [...] said Captain Ephraim.|$|R
2500|$|Seneca then {{instructed}} Tomoka {{that she}} would be sunk by gunfire unless she proceeded toward New York City. The rum-runner started in that direction, but then suddenly started its engine, hoisted the fore <b>staysail</b> and stood rapidly to eastward. Seneca gave chase and opened fire. [...] The first shot was fired across the bow of the fleeing schooner, then the range was gradually decreased. After three warning shots, a fourth shot was fired to hit. The shell landed alongside a few feet from Tomoka, and the schooner immediately stopped engines, hauled down the fore <b>staysail</b> and headed into the wind with her foresail idly flapping.|$|E
2500|$|After {{rebuilding}} in the 1980s {{she is now}} [...] long, [...] {{wide and}} [...] deep and measures [...] She now has a wheel {{and was in the}} <b>staysail</b> class of sailing barge. Her current sails are a jib, foresail, mainsail and topsail on the mainmast, and a mizzen sail on the mizzen-mast aft. Initially engined in 1943, she has been powered since 1980 by a Ford diesel. more recently the barge has been fitted with a bowsprit.|$|E
2500|$|On 16 October 1957, on {{a voyage}} between New York City and Liverpool, No.8 piston rod {{in the engine}} snapped. The ship was about [...] off Halifax at the time. The weather deteriorated, and the ship was rolling, making repairs difficult. To {{stabilize}} Rakaia, {{it was decided to}} jury rig a set of sails. Tarpaulin sails were made from hatch covers. Two square sails and one <b>staysail</b> were erected, giving approximately [...] of sail. The engine was reduced from [...] eight to six cylinders, running at a maximum of 50rpm; it took eleven days to reach Liverpool.|$|E
50|$|In {{the typical}} Bermuda rig, the sails located {{in front of}} the mast {{generally}} deliver a higher percentage of the driving force. The stay that supports {{the leading edge of the}} sail causes far less turbulence than a mast, resulting in better airflow across the lee side of the sail. To take advantage of this fact, Bermuda rigs are shifting towards larger fore-sails and smaller mainsails. Fore-sails include jibs, genoas and <b>staysails.</b> The cutter, with its use of multiple foresails, achieves the same goal of placing a higher percentage of the sail area in <b>staysails.</b>|$|R
50|$|Fore-and-aft rigged sails include <b>staysails,</b> Bermuda rigged sails, gaff rigged sails, gaff sails, gunter rig, lateen sails, lug sails, the spanker sail on {{a square}} rig and crab claw sails.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hard up {{with the}} helm--hard up!" [...] Wilkinson shouted. [...] "Hold on a moment with those head sails; that will do, that will do. Let go the halliards; down <b>staysails</b> and jib." ...|$|R
2500|$|She was rigged as a barque (the fore- and mainmasts being square rig and the {{mizzen mast}} {{carrying}} a fore-aft sail) {{and the total}} maximum sail area was 12,296 square feet (1142 square metres). Following {{the practice of the}} most modern sailing ships of the time, the windjammers, she carried split topsails {{to reduce the size of}} the deck crew needed to handle them. The ship was rigged to carry several large staysails and the funnel was hinged at the base so it could be laid on the deck when the large mizzen <b>staysail</b> was rigged once at sea. The Discovery was marginally faster under sail than she was under engine - her record for distance travelled in 24 hours is 223 nautical miles (358km), equivalent to 9.2 knots (10.5mph, 17km/h)> ...|$|E
2500|$|After the war, the Tuckerton Wireless Station was {{included}} in German war reparations paid to America. Shortly afterwards, it was sold to RCA which operated it until 1948 as a backup to their famous Radio Central facility in Rocky Point, New York. In 1921, RCA installed two massive Alexanderson alternators, which were removed in 1948. [...] For transatlantic communications, the radio station operated under the call signs WCI and WGG. For coastal communications, after World War I, [...] the station operated under the callsign WSC. The [...] steel tower, anchored by three large concrete blocks, was taken down on December 27, 1955. The three huge anchor blocks still exist today, in a backyard on North Ensign Drive {{and in the middle}} of South Ensign Drive and <b>Staysail</b> Drive. Many smaller anchor blocks providing foundations for smaller towers that supported the umbrella antenna are still visible in the lagoons. Remains of the large tower can be seen in scraps at the Giffordtown Museum.|$|E
2500|$|Dundas was {{eventually}} forced to haul {{away from the}} Belleisle as night fell, and try to save his own ship. During the night the Naiads larboard topsail sheet blew away, and the reefed topsail sheet was split. The crew were forced to cut away the other sheet to save the yard, but the sheet blew away in the gale. Shortly afterwards the fore topmast <b>staysail</b> was blown to bits. Belleisle was also in a desperate situation, blown almost onto the breakers of the Spanish coast before her crew managed to wear her around. With difficulty she survived the night, and was found when the light came the next morning by Dundas, who had a line reattached. [...] He steered straight for Gibraltar, and came {{within sight of the}} rock by midday, despite having been fired on by the Spanish battery at Tarifa. Dundas took Naiad in and anchored at 1330 that afternoon, while the Belleisle was warped into the mole. Dundas subsequently was awarded a sword from the Lloyd's Patriotic Fund for his services at Trafalgar.|$|E

50|$|To a stay - Sails {{attached}} to stays, include jibs, which are {{attached to}} forestays and <b>staysails,</b> which are mounted on other stays (typically wire cable) that support other masts from the bow aft.|$|R

50|$|Many mast-aft rigs utilize a small {{mainsail}} {{and multiple}} <b>staysails</b> that can resemble some cutter rigs. A cutter {{is a single}} masted vessel, differentiated from a sloop either {{by the number of}} <b>staysails,</b> with a sloop having one and a cutter more than one, or by the position of the mast, with a cutter's mast being located between 50% and 70% of the way from the aft {{to the front of the}} sailplan, and a sloop's mast being located forward of the 70% mark. A mast aft rig could, based on headsail count, be considered a variation of the sloop or cutter, or, based on mast position, a unique rig.|$|R
50|$|A headsail of a {{sailing vessel}} is any sail set {{forward of the}} {{foremost}} mast. The most common headsails are <b>staysails,</b> a term that includes jibs and the larger genoa. Other headsails are set independently of any forestays, such as the spinnaker.|$|R
50|$|On rigs having {{multiple}} jibs or <b>staysails</b> {{of which}} at least one is set high, such as many late 19th and 20th Century racing cutters, the uppermost of these, set flying or on a topmast stay, is often called the jib topsail.|$|R
60|$|Either {{owing to}} the fore-top-mast <b>staysail,</b> or to some providential sea, the vessel did fall off, however, and {{presently}} she righted, coming up with great force, with a heavy roll to windward. The <b>staysail</b> helped us, I feel persuaded, as the stay had got taut in the wreck, and the wind had blown out the hanks. The brig's helm being hard up, {{as soon as she}} got way, the craft flew round like a top, coming up on the other tack, in spite of us, and throwing her nearly over again. She did not come fairly down, however, though I thought she was gone, for an instant.|$|E
60|$|Flora and Mabel agreed, Wyndham {{changed his}} course, {{and the dark}} hills they were {{following}} got nearer. By and by Marston hauled down the <b>staysail</b> {{and stood on the}} deck forward, studying the forbidding coast Wyndham steered for.|$|E
60|$|The boat swung round a little, edging {{in toward}} the beach, and Whitney saw by the ripples {{that they were in}} shallow water. Andrew let the <b>staysail</b> run down, but when he stood ready with the boathook, Elsie smiled.|$|E
50|$|Square rig - As {{with any}} {{downwind}} change of course, the sails on a square rigger are adjusted with the vessel's running rigging, using braces sheets. Only the jibs, <b>staysails</b> and the spanker {{need to be}} jibed, as on a fore-and-aft rig.|$|R
5000|$|Sails {{set forward}} of the mainmast, such as jibs and <b>staysails,</b> are {{sometimes}} referred to as foresails, although [...] "headsails" [...] is a more common term, headsail can also specifically refer to the sail on a forestay that connects directly {{to the head of the}} mast.|$|R
50|$|Windeward Bound is rigged {{with four}} square sails, three headsails, three <b>staysails</b> between the masts, a gaff {{mainsail}} and gaff topsail, totalling 12 sails in all. The total sail area is 402 m2 and the windage lever of the sails from {{the centre of}} lateral resistance8 is 9.87 m.|$|R
