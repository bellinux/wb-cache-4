40|$|In service industries, a {{dominant}} morphology of service applications is a bi-lateral Resource Integration Service Pattern (called BIRIS), {{in which the}} broker is responsible for aggregating distributed service resources into a whole and providing it to customers.

This study presented a progressive service value network design scheme for bi-lateral service scenarios. It consisted of four steps. The first <b>step</b> <b>was</b> the initial SVN identification.

Hence, the test is only applicable if the object of the impugned legislation is a proper one.|$|E
50|$|Originally {{the altar}} {{was made in}} the shape of an {{ordinary}} table, on which the crucifix and candlesticks were placed.

5|$|A full {{data set}} may consist of {{hundreds}} of separate images taken at different orientations of the crystal. The first <b>step</b> <b>is</b> to merge and scale these various images, that is, to identify which peaks appear in two or more images (merging) and to scale the relative images so {{that they have a}} consistent intensity scale. Optimizing the intensity scale is critical because the relative intensity of the peaks is the key information from which the structure is determined. The repetitive technique of crystallographic data collection and the often high symmetry of crystalline materials cause the diffractometer to record many symmetry-equivalent reflections multiple times. This allows calculating the symmetry-related R-factor, a reliability index based upon how similar are the measured intensities of symmetry-equivalent reflections, thus assessing the quality of the data.|$|E
5|$|A notable {{feature on}} the wall of the front porch on the ground floor is a foot print on a stone slab. It is said that this foot print belonged to a {{resident}} of the monastery, who was a water carrier, known as Chitenpa. He served in the monastery for a long time and on one fine day he announced that he had completed his service to the monastery and then stamped his left foot on the stone slab which created a dented formation of his step. This <b>step</b> <b>is</b> venerated as a miracle in view of a belief among the people of the region that such an imprint on a stone slab could only be created by a divine person who was a true devotee of the monastery.|$|E
5|$|DNA {{nanostructures}} must be rationally {{designed so}} that individual nucleic acid strands will assemble into the desired structures.

Then, the overall secondary structure of the target complex is determined, specifying the arrangement of nucleic acid strands within the structure, and which portions of those strands should be bound to each other. The last <b>step</b> <b>is</b> the primary structure design, which is the specification of the actual base sequences of each nucleic acid strand.|$|E

5|$|It {{has also}} been {{reported}} that phosphoramidites activated with 1H-tetrazole react, to a small extent, with the O6 position of guanosine. Upon oxidation with I2 /water, this side product, possibly via O6-N7 migration, undergoes depurination. The apurinic sites thus formed are readily cleaved {{in the course of}} the final deprotection of the oligonucleotide under the basic conditions (see below) to give two shorter oligonucleotides thus reducing the yield of the full-length product. The O6 modifications are rapidly removed by treatment with the capping reagent as long as the capping <b>step</b> <b>is</b> performed prior to oxidation with I2/water.|$|E
5|$|The {{newly formed}} tricoordinated {{phosphite}} triester linkage is not natural and is of limited stability under {{the conditions of}} oligonucleotide synthesis. The treatment of the support-bound material with iodine and water {{in the presence of}} a weak base (pyridine, lutidine, or collidine) oxidizes the phosphite triester into a tetracoordinated phosphate triester, a protected precursor of the naturally occurring phosphate diester internucleosidic linkage. Oxidation may be carried out under anhydrous conditions using tert-Butyl hydroperoxide or, more efficiently, (1S)-(+)-(10-camphorsulfonyl)-oxaziridine (CSO). The step of oxidation is substituted with a sulfurization step to obtain oligonucleotide phosphorothioates (see Oligonucleotide phosphorothioates and their synthesis below). In the latter case, the sulfurization <b>step</b> <b>is</b> best carried out prior to capping.|$|E

40|$|While lean {{programmes}} {{continue to}} be implemented in many companies, there is a rising concern regarding the failures of these programmes.

Using the experience with a lean programme in an aircraft maintenance and repair operation, the purpose of the research was to develop an implementation model which consists of six critical decisions or steps. The first <b>step</b> <b>was</b> to perform strategic analysis which was driven by the market or the customer. The second <b>step</b> <b>was</b> to establish a high-level cross-functional team to drive the improvement initiative. The third <b>step</b> <b>was</b> to identify overall improvement tools. The fourth <b>step</b> <b>was</b> to perform a high-level value stream mapping and prioritise improvement opportunities. The fifth <b>step</b> <b>was</b> to develop a detailed plan for low-level improvement teams, and the sixth <b>step</b> <b>was</b> to implement, document, and revise as needed.
