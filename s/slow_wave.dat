5|$|Sleep {{involves}} great {{changes in}} brain activity. Until the 1950s {{it was generally}} believed that the brain essentially shuts off during sleep, but this is now known to be far from true; activity continues, but patterns become very different. There {{are two types of}} sleep: REM sleep (with dreaming) and NREM (non-REM, usually without dreaming) sleep, which repeat in slightly varying patterns throughout a sleep episode. Three broad types of distinct brain activity patterns can be measured: REM, light NREM and deep NREM. During deep NREM sleep, also called <b>slow</b> <b>wave</b> sleep, activity in the cortex takes the form of large synchronized waves, whereas in the waking state it is noisy and desynchronized. Levels of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and serotonin drop during <b>slow</b> <b>wave</b> sleep, and fall almost to zero during REM sleep; levels of acetylcholine show the reverse pattern.|$|E
25|$|<b>Slow</b> <b>wave</b> sleep {{occurs during}} stages 3 and 4 of the sleep process. <b>Slow</b> <b>wave</b> {{activity}} is increased {{by as much}} as 25% after implicit learning and time spent in this sleep stage has been shown to improve performance of the implicitly learned task after sleep.|$|E
25|$|Humans possess both <b>slow</b> <b>wave</b> and REM sleep, in both phases {{both eyes}} are closed and both hemispheres of the brain involved. Sleep has also been {{recorded}} in mammals other than humans. One interesting study showed that echidnas possess only <b>slow</b> <b>wave</b> sleep (non-REM). This {{seems to indicate that}} REM sleep appeared in evolution only after therians. But this has later been contested by studies that claim that sleep in echidna combines both modes into a single sleeping state. Other studies have shown a peculiar form of sleep in odontocetes (like dolphins and porpoises). This is called the unihemispherical <b>slow</b> <b>wave</b> sleep (USWS). At any time during this sleep mode, the EEG of one brain hemisphere indicates sleep while that of the other is equivalent to wakefulness. In some cases, the corresponding eye is open. This might allow the animal to reduce predator risk and sleep while swimming in water, though the animal may also be capable of sleeping at rest.|$|E
50|$|Intestinal <b>slow</b> <b>waves</b> {{occur at}} around 12 cycles-per-minute in the duodenum, and {{decreases}} in frequency towards the colon. Entrainment of intestinal <b>slow</b> <b>waves</b> forms “frequency plateaus” in a piece-wise manner along the intestine. Similar to the stomach, intestinal <b>slow</b> <b>waves</b> frequency, propagation velocity, and amplitude also demonstrate significant inter-species differences.|$|R
50|$|ICC {{serve as}} {{electrical}} pacemakers and generate spontaneous electrical <b>slow</b> <b>waves</b> in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Electrical <b>slow</b> <b>waves</b> spread from ICC to smooth muscle cells {{and the resulting}} depolarization initiates calcium ion entry and contraction. <b>Slow</b> <b>waves</b> organize gut contractions into phasic contractions that are the basis for peristalsis and segmentation.|$|R
40|$|When {{intracellular}} recordings {{were made}} from the circular layer of the intact muscular wall of the isolated guinea pig gastric corpus, an ongoing regular high frequency discharge of <b>slow</b> <b>waves</b> was detected even though this region lacked myenteric interstitial cells. When <b>slow</b> <b>waves</b> were recorded from preparations consisting of both the antrum and the corpus, <b>slow</b> <b>waves</b> of identical frequency, but with different shapes, were generated in the two regions. Corporal <b>slow</b> <b>waves</b> could be distinguished from antral <b>slow</b> <b>waves</b> by their time courses and amplitudes. Corporal <b>slow</b> <b>waves,</b> like antral <b>slow</b> <b>waves,</b> were abolished by buffering the internal concentration of calcium ions, [Ca 2 +]i, to low levels, or by caffeine, 2 -aminoethoxydiphenyl borate or the chloride channel blocker DIDS. Corporal preparations demonstrated an ongoing discharge of unitary potentials, as {{has been found in}} all other tissues containing interstitial cells. The experiments show that the corpus provides the dominant pacemaker activity which entrains activity in other regions of the stomach and it is suggested that this activity is generated by corporal intramuscular interstitial cells...|$|R
25|$|Sleep {{studies of}} KLS show varying results {{based on the}} amount of time the patient is observed. <b>Slow</b> <b>wave</b> sleep is often reduced at the {{beginning}} of episodes, and REM sleep is reduced near the end. Conversely, REM sleep is often normal at the beginning, and <b>slow</b> <b>wave</b> sleep is often normal by the conclusion. Stage two non-rapid eye movement sleep is often interrupted during KLS. Studies also show that stage one and three non-rapid eye movement sleep become more efficient when the episodes end. The Multiple Sleep Latency Test has yielded inconsistent results when given to KLS patients. In many cases, hours are spent in a withdrawn sleep-like state while awake during episodes. Most sleep studies have been performed while subject are near the end of their episodes. Some patients experience brief insomnia and become very happy and talkative after the episode ends.|$|E
25|$|The Penn State Student Section initiates a wave during {{sporting}} events. After {{the wave}} passes around the stadium twice, the student section slows down the wave {{to about a}} fourth {{the speed of the}} normal wave. After the <b>slow</b> <b>wave</b> passes, the wave speeds up to over twice the speed of the normal wave. The wave has, on occasion, been reversed in direction following the fast wave.|$|E
25|$|This two {{process model}} was first {{proposed}} in 1982 by Borbely, who called them Process S (homeostatic) and Process C (Circadian) respectively. He showed how the <b>slow</b> <b>wave</b> density increases {{through the night}} and then drops off {{at the beginning of the}} day while the circadian rhythm is like a sinusoid. He proposed that the pressure to sleep was the maximum when the difference between the two was highest.|$|E
40|$|Membrane {{potential}} recordings {{were made}} from longitudinal smooth muscle cells of the guinea-pig urethra using conventional microelectrode techniques. Smooth muscle cells of the urethra developed spontaneous transient depolarizations (STDs) and <b>slow</b> <b>waves.</b> Single unit STDs had amplitudes of approximately 5 mV and <b>slow</b> <b>waves</b> seemed to occur as amplitude multiples of single unit STDs. STDs and <b>slow</b> <b>waves</b> were abolished by niflumic acid or low chloride solution and also by cyclopiazonic acid (CPA), BAPTA or high concentrations of caffeine. Lower concentrations of caffeine abolished <b>slow</b> <b>waves</b> but not STDs. Nifedipine inhibited <b>slow</b> <b>waves</b> but not STDs. When stochastic properties of STDs were examined, {{it was found that}} the intervals between occurrences were not well modelled by Poisson statistics, instead the STDs appeared to be clustered. Transmural stimulation evoked excitatory junctional potentials (EJPs) and triggered <b>slow</b> <b>waves</b> which were abolished by either α,β-methylene-ATP or tetrodotoxin. Evoked <b>slow</b> <b>waves</b> were also abolished by caffeine, co-application of caffeine and ryanodine or by CPA which left EJPs unaffected. In conclusion, smooth muscle cells of urethra exhibit STDs which are clustered rather than random events, and are the result of spontaneous Ca 2 + release from intracellular stores and subsequent activation of Ca 2 +-activated chloride channels. STDs sum to activate L-type Ca 2 + channels which contribute to the sustained phase of <b>slow</b> <b>waves.</b> Stimulation of purinoceptors by neurally released ATP initiates EJPs and also causes the release of Ca 2 + from intracellular stores to evoke <b>slow</b> <b>waves...</b>|$|R
40|$|Sleep <b>slow</b> <b>waves</b> are {{the main}} {{phenomenon}} underlying NREM sleep. They are homeostatically regulated, they {{are thought to be}} linked to learning and plasticity processes and, at the same time, they are associated with marked changes in cortical information processing. Using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and high-density (hd) EEG we can measure <b>slow</b> <b>waves,</b> induce and measure plastic changes in the cerebral cortex and directly assess corticocortical information transmission. In this manuscript we review the results of recent experiments in which TMS with hd-EEG is used to demonstrate (i) a causal link between cortical plastic changes and sleep <b>slow</b> <b>waves</b> and (ii) a causal link between <b>slow</b> <b>waves</b> and the decreased ability of thalamocortical circuits to integrate information and to generate conscious experience during NREM sleep. The data presented here suggest a unifying mechanism linking <b>slow</b> <b>waves,</b> plasticity and cortical information integration; moreover, they suggest that TMS {{can be used as a}} nonpharmacological means to controllably induce <b>slow</b> <b>waves</b> in the human cerebral cortex...|$|R
40|$|In the {{gastrointestinal}} (GI) tract electrical <b>slow</b> <b>waves</b> yield oscillations in {{membrane potential}} that periodically increase the open probability of voltage-dependent Ca 2 + channels and facilitate phasic contractions. <b>Slow</b> <b>waves</b> are {{generated by the}} interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC), and these events actively propagate through ICC networks {{within the walls of}} GI organs. The mechanism that entrains spontaneously active pacemaker sites throughout ICC networks to produce regenerative propagation of <b>slow</b> <b>waves</b> is unresolved. Agents that block inositol 1, 4, 5 -trisphosphate (IP 3) receptors and mitochondrial Ca 2 + uptake were tested on the generation of <b>slow</b> <b>waves</b> in the canine colon. A partitioned chamber apparatus was used to test the effects of blocking slow-wave generation on propagation. We found that active propagation occurred along strips of colonic muscle, but when the pacemaker mechanism was blocked in a portion of the tissue, <b>slow</b> <b>waves</b> decayed exponentially from the point where the pacemaker mechanism was inhibited. An IP 3 receptor inhibitor, mitochondrial inhibitors, low external Ca 2 +, and divalent cations (Mn 2 + and Ni 2 +) caused exponential decay of the <b>slow</b> <b>waves</b> in regions of muscle exposed to these agents. These data demonstrate that the mechanism that initiates <b>slow</b> <b>waves</b> is reactivated from cell-to-cell during the propagation of <b>slow</b> <b>waves.</b> Voltage-dependent conductances present in smooth muscle cells are incapable of slow-wave regeneration. The data predict that partial loss of or disruptions to ICC networks observed in human motility disorders could lead to incomplete penetration of <b>slow</b> <b>waves</b> through GI organs and, thus, to defects in myogenic regulation...|$|R
25|$|Quazepam has potent sleep {{inducing}} {{and sleep}} maintaining properties. Studies in both {{animals and humans}} have demonstrated that EEG changes induced by quazepam resemble normal sleep patterns whereas other benzodiazepines disrupt normal sleep. Quazepam promotes <b>slow</b> <b>wave</b> sleep. This positive effect of quazepam on sleep architecture {{may be due to}} its high selectivity for type1 benzodiazepine receptors as demonstrated in animal and human studies. This makes quazepam unique in the benzodiazepine family of drugs.|$|E
25|$|Uniaxial {{birefringence}} {{is classified}} as positive when the extraordinary index of refraction ne {{is greater than the}} ordinary index no. Negative birefringence means that Δn = ne − no is less than zero. In other words, the polarization of the fast (or <b>slow)</b> <b>wave</b> is perpendicular to the optic axis when the birefringence of the crystal is positive (or negative, respectively). In the case of biaxial crystals, all three of the principal axes have different refractive indices, so this designation does not apply. But for any defined ray direction one can just as well designate the fast and slow ray polarizations.|$|E
25|$|Mammals, {{birds and}} {{reptiles}} evolved from amniotic ancestors, the first vertebrates with life cycles independent of water. The fact that {{birds and mammals}} are the only known animals to exhibit REM and NREM sleep indicates a common trait before divergence. Reptiles are therefore the most logical group to investigate the origins of sleep. Daytime activity in reptiles alternates between basking and short bouts of active behavior, which has significant neurological and physiological similarities to sleep states in mammals. It is proposed that REM sleep evolved from short bouts of motor activity in reptiles while SWS evolved from their basking state which shows similar <b>slow</b> <b>wave</b> EEG patterns.|$|E
40|$|Left {{and right}} {{cerebral}} hemispheres are morphologically similar, {{although they are}} functionally different. Focal EEG abnormalities should appear with an equal frequency in both of them, but the literature has reported a left predominance. We presented the first Latin American study on lateralization of focal EEG abnormalities. Method: We retrospectively studied 10, 408 EEGs from April 2001 to April 2010. They were separated by age and gender to estimate the frequency of left-sided versus right-sided focal abnormalities (discharges or <b>slow</b> <b>waves).</b> Associated clinical features were also accessed. Results: Discharges were more prevalent in left cerebral hemisphere, in temporal lobe, and a stronger lateralization was found among adults. Right-sided discharges occurred more in frontal lobe. <b>Slow</b> <b>waves</b> were also more prevalent in the left cerebral hemisphere and among adults. Among left-sided <b>slow</b> <b>waves</b> group, women were more prevalent. Contrarily, men were more observed among right-sided <b>slow</b> <b>waves</b> EEGs. Left-sided <b>slow</b> <b>waves</b> were more prevalent in temporal and parietal lobes. Contrarily, right-sided <b>slow</b> <b>waves</b> occurred more in frontal and occipital lobes. Epilepsy was the most frequent disease among the patients with focal discharges in both cerebral hemispheres. Right-sided <b>slow</b> <b>waves</b> were more associated to epilepsy, and left-sided <b>slow</b> <b>waves</b> were more associated to headache. Conclusion: There were significant differences between cerebral hemispheres on focal EEG abnormalities, considering lateralization, gender, age and clinical features. These results suggest a neurofuncional asymmetry between cerebral hemispheres which {{may be explained by}} different specificities, as well as by cerebral neuroplasticity...|$|R
40|$|<b>Slow</b> <b>waves</b> {{represent}} one of {{the prominent}} EEG signatures of non-rapid eye movement (non-REM) sleep and are thought {{to play an important}} role in the cellular and network plasticity that occurs during this behavioral state. These <b>slow</b> <b>waves</b> of natural sleep are currently considered to be exclusively generated by intrinsic and synaptic mechanisms within neocortical territories, although a role for the thalamus in this key physiological rhythm has been suggested but never demonstrated. Combining neuronal ensemble recordings, microdialysis, and optogenetics, here we show that the block of the thalamic output to the neocortex markedly (up to 50 %) decreases the frequency of <b>slow</b> <b>waves</b> recorded during non-REM sleep in freely moving, naturally sleeping-waking rats. A smaller volume of thalamic inactivation than during sleep is required for observing similar effects on EEG <b>slow</b> <b>waves</b> recorded during anesthesia, a condition in which both bursts and single action potentials of thalamocortical neurons are almost exclusively dependent on T-type calcium channels. Thalamic inactivation more strongly reduces spindles than <b>slow</b> <b>waves</b> during both anesthesia and natural leep. Moreover, selective excitation of thalamocortical neurons strongly entrains EEG <b>slow</b> <b>waves</b> in a narrow frequency band (0. 75 – 1. 5 Hz) only when thalamic T-type calcium channels are functionally active. These results demonstrate that the thalamus finely tunes the frequency of <b>slow</b> <b>waves</b> during non-REM sleep and anesthesia, and thus provide the first conclusive evidence that a dynamic interplay of the neocortical and thalamic oscillators of <b>slow</b> <b>waves</b> is required for the full expression of this key physiological EEG rhythm. peer-reviewe...|$|R
40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVES: The {{electrophysiological}} {{correlates of}} anesthetic sedation remain poorly understood. We used high-density electroencephalography (hd-EEG) and source modeling {{to investigate the}} cortical processes underlying propofol anesthesia and compare them to sleep. DESIGN: 256 -channel EEG recordings in humans during propofol anesthesia. SETTING: Hospital operating room. PATIENTS OR PARTICIPANTS: 8 healthy subjects (4 males) INTERVENTIONS: N/A MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Initially, propofol induced increases in EEG power from 12 - 25 Hz. Loss of consciousness (LOC) was accompanied {{by the appearance of}} EEG <b>slow</b> <b>waves</b> that resembled the <b>slow</b> <b>waves</b> of NREM sleep. We compared <b>slow</b> <b>waves</b> in propofol to <b>slow</b> <b>waves</b> recorded during natural sleep and found that both populations of waves share similar cortical origins and preferentially propagate along the mesial components of the default network. However, propofol <b>slow</b> <b>waves</b> were spatially blurred compared to sleep <b>slow</b> <b>waves</b> and failed to effectively entrain spindle activity. Propofol also caused an increase in gamma (25 - 40 Hz) power that persisted throughout LOC. Source modeling analysis showed that this increase in gamma power originated from the anterior and posterior cingulate cortices. During LOC, we found increased gamma functional connectivity between these regions compared to the wakefulness. CONCLUSIONS: Propofol anesthesia is a sleep-like state and <b>slow</b> <b>waves</b> are associated with diminished consciousness even in the presence of high gamma activity.

Initially, {{it was expected that}} the brainstem, which was implicated in arousal would be inactive, but this was later on found to have been due to low resolution of PET studies and it was shown that there is some <b>slow</b> <b>wave</b> activity in the brainstem as well. However, other parts of the brain, including the precuneus, basal forebrain and basal ganglia are deactivated during sleep. Many areas of the cortex are also inactive, but to different levels. For example, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex is considered the least active area while the primary cortex, the least deactivated.|$|E
25|$|While {{many factors}} can {{increase}} risk for ISP or RISP, {{they can be}} avoided with minor lifestyle changes. By maintaining a regular sleep schedule and observing good sleep hygiene, one can reduce chances of sleep paralysis. It helps subjects to reduce the intake of stimulants and stress in daily life by taking up a hobby or seeing a trained psychologist who can suggest coping mechanisms for stress. However, some cases of ISP and RISP involve a genetic factor—which means some people may find sleep paralysis unavoidable. Practicing meditation regularly might also be helpful in preventing fragmented sleep, and thus the occurrence of sleep paralysis. Research has shown that long-term meditation practitioners {{spend more time in}} <b>slow</b> <b>wave</b> sleep, and as such regular meditation practice could reduce nocturnal arousal and thus possibly sleep paralysis.|$|E
25|$|Zaleplon has a {{pharmacological}} profile {{similar to}} benzodiazepines, {{characterized by an}} increase in <b>slow</b> <b>wave</b> deep sleep (SWDS) with rapid onset of hypnotic action. Zaleplon is a full agonist for the benzodiazepine α1 receptor located on the GABAA receptor complex in the body, with lower affinity for the α2 and α3 subsites. It selectively enhances the action of GABA similar to, but more selectively than benzodiazepines. Zaleplon, although not a benzodiazepine, maintains a very similar chemical structure nonetheless, known for inducing hypnotic effects by α1 subreceptor sites, anxiolytic, and muscle relaxant effects via α2 and α3 subsites, with negligible anticonvulsant properties (via α5 subsite), as zaleplon action is modulated at benzodiazepine receptor sites. The elimination half-life of zaleplon is about 1–1.5 hours. The absorption rate of zaleplon is rapid and the onset of therapeutic effects is typically breached within 5–15 minutes following ingestion.|$|E

40|$|During non-REM {{sleep the}} EEG is {{dominated}} by <b>slow</b> <b>waves</b> which result from synchronized UP and DOWN states in the component neurons of the thalamocortical network. This review focuses on four areas of recent progress {{in our understanding of}} these events. Thus, it has now been conclusively demonstrated that the full expression of <b>slow</b> <b>waves,</b> both of natural sleep and anesthesia, requires an essential contribution by the thalamus. Furthermore, the modulatory role of brainstem transmitters, the function of cortical inhibition and the relative contribution of single neocortical neurons to EEG <b>slow</b> <b>waves</b> have started to be carefully investigated. Together, these new data confirm the view that a full understanding of <b>slow</b> <b>waves</b> can only be achieved by considering the thalamocortical network as a single functional and dynamic unit for the generation of this key EEG rhythm...|$|R
40|$|Sleep <b>slow</b> <b>waves</b> are {{the major}} {{electrophysiological}} features of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Although there is growing understanding of where <b>slow</b> <b>waves</b> originate {{and how they are}} generated during sleep, the function of <b>slow</b> <b>waves</b> is still largely unclear. A recently proposed hypothesis relates <b>slow</b> <b>waves</b> to the homeostatic regulation of synaptic plasticity. While several studies confirm a correlation between experimentally triggered synaptic changes and slow-wave activity (SWA), little is known about its association to synaptic changes occurring during cortical maturation. Interestingly, <b>slow</b> <b>waves</b> undergo remarkable changes during development that parallel the time course of cortical maturation. In a recent cross-sectional study including children and adolescents, the topographical distribution of SWA was analyzed with high-density electroencephalography. The results showed age-dependent differences in SWA topography: SWA was highest over posterior regions during early childhood and then shifted over central derivations to the frontal cortex in late adolescence. This trajectory of SWA topography matches the course of cortical gray maturation. In this chapter, the major changes in <b>slow</b> <b>waves</b> during development are highlighted and linked to cortical maturation and behavior. Interestingly, synaptic density and slow-wave amplitude increase during childhood are highest shortly before puberty, decline thereafter during adolescence, reaching overall stable levels during adulthood. The question arises whether SWA is merely reflecting cortical changes or if it plays an active role in brain maturation. We thereby propose a model, by which sleep <b>slow</b> <b>waves</b> may contribute to cortical maturation. We hypothesize that while there is a balance between synaptic strengthening and synaptic downscaling in adults, the balance of strengthening/formation and weakening/elimination is tilted during development...|$|R
25|$|Much of {{the brain}} {{activity}} in sleep {{has been attributed to}} the thalamus and it appears that the thalamus may {{play a critical role in}} SWS. The two primary oscillations in <b>slow</b> <b>wave</b> sleep, delta and the slow oscillation, can be generated by both the thalamus and the cortex. However, sleep spindles can only be generated by the thalamus, making its role very important. The thalamic pacemaker hypothesis holds that these oscillations are generated by the thalamus but the synchronization of several groups of thalamic neurons firing simultaneously depends on the thalamic interaction with the cortex. The thalamus also plays a critical role in sleep onset when it changes from tonic to phasic mode, thus acting like a mirror for both central and decentral elements and linking distant parts of the cortex to co-ordinate their activity.|$|E
25|$|More recently, {{the problem}} of {{definition}} has been addressed by observing overall brain activity {{in the form of}} characteristic EEG patterns. Each stage of sleep and wakefulness has a characteristic pattern of EEG which can be used to identify the stage of sleep. Waking is usually characterized by beta (12–30Hz) and gamma (25–100Hz) depending on whether there was a peaceful or stressful activity. The onset of sleep involves slowing down of this frequency to the drowsiness of alpha (8–12Hz) and finally to theta (4–10Hz) of Stage 1 NREM sleep. This frequency further decreases progressively through the higher stages of NREM and REM sleep. On the other hand, the amplitude of sleep waves is lowest during wakefulness (10–30μV) and shows a progressive increase through the various stages of sleep. Stage 2 is characterized by sleep spindles (intermittent clusters of waves at sigma frequency i.e. 12–14Hz) and K complexes (sharp upward deflection followed by slower downward deflection). Stage 3 sleep has more sleep spindles. Stages 3 and 4 have very high amplitude delta waves (0–4Hz) and are known as <b>slow</b> <b>wave</b> sleep. REM sleep is characterized by low amplitude, mixed frequency waves. A sawtooth wave pattern is often present.|$|E
25|$|Age {{and genetic}} factors {{influence}} {{the risk of}} developing alcohol-related neurotoxicity. Adolescence, especially early adolescence (i.e. before age 15), is a critical and delicate developmental stage for specialised neuronal and synaptic systems mature. This critical developmental stage is where lifelong adult traits e.g., talents, reasoning and complex skills mature; however alcohol and in particular binge drinking may disrupt and interfere with this developmental process. Adolescence is also a period of development characterised by a high level of novel seeking, thrill seeking and risk taking behaviour and thus alcohol and other drug experimentation and abuse is common. An adolescent rat study found that a relatively short exposure to high levels of alcohol resulted in long-lasting changes to functional brain activity with corresponding abnormalities in EEG brain waves that persisted into adulthood, including persisting disturbances in sleep EEG with a reduction in <b>slow</b> <b>wave</b> sleep. These EEG findings are similar to premature aging. According to one review of the literature, if the developmental stage of adolescence is similar to the developmental stage of the fetus with regard to sensitivity to the neurotoxic effects of alcohol, and if long-lasting or permanent damage to the brain occurs similar to what animal studies suggest, then this represents a major public health issue due to the high levels of alcohol use by adolescents. Indeed, alcohol can affect the remodeling and functional changes in synaptic plasticity and neuronal connectivity in different brain regions that occurs during adolescence (see this related article).|$|E
40|$|Intracellular {{recordings}} {{were made}} from the circular layer of the intact muscular wall of the guinea-pig gastric antrum in preparations {{where much of the}} corpus remained attached. When two electrodes were positioned parallel to and near to the greater curvature, <b>slow</b> <b>waves</b> were first detected at the oral site and subsequently at the anal site: the oro-anal conduction velocity was found to be 2. 5 mm s− 1. When one electrode was positioned near the greater curvature and the other at a circumferential location, <b>slow</b> <b>waves</b> were first detected near the greater curvature and subsequently at the circumferential site: the circumferential conduction velocity was 13. 9 mm s− 1. When recordings {{were made from}} preparations in which the circular muscle layer had been removed, the oro-anal and the circumferential conduction velocities were both about 3. 5 mm s− 1. When <b>slow</b> <b>waves</b> were recorded from preparations in which much of the myenteric network of antral interstitial cells (ICCMY) had been dissected away, <b>slow</b> <b>waves</b> were first detected near the region of intact ICCMY and subsequently at a circumferential location: the circumferential conduction velocity of <b>slow</b> <b>waves</b> in regions devoid of ICCMY was 14. 7 mm s− 1. When the electrical properties of isolated single bundles of circular muscle were determined, their length constants were about 3 mm and their time constant about 230 ms, giving an asymptotic electrotonic propagation velocity of 25 mm s− 1. Oro-anal electrical coupling between adjacent bundles of circular muscle was found to vary widely: some bundles were well connected to neighbouring bundles whereas others were not. Together the observations suggest that the slow oro-anal progression of <b>slow</b> <b>waves</b> results from a slow conduction velocity of pacemaker potentials in the myenteric network of interstitial cells. The rapid circumferential conduction of <b>slow</b> <b>waves</b> results from the electrical properties of the circular muscle layer which allow intramuscular ICC (ICCIM) to support the radial spread of slow waves: regions of high resistance between bundles prevent the anally directed spread of <b>slow</b> <b>waves</b> within the circular layer...|$|R
40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were to {{determine}} optimal pacing parameters of electrical stimulation on different gut segments and to investigate effects and possible mechanisms of gastrointestinal electrical stimulation on gut <b>slow</b> <b>waves.</b> Twelve female hound-mix dogs were used in this study. A total of six pairs of electrodes were implanted on the stomach, duodenum, and ascending colon. Bilateral truncal vagotomy was performed in six of the dogs. One experiment was designed to study the effects of the pacing frequency on the entrainment of gut <b>slow</b> <b>waves.</b> Another experiment was designed to study the modulatory effects of the vagal and sympathetic pathways on gastrointestinal pacing. The frequency of <b>slow</b> <b>waves</b> was 4. 88 ± 0. 23 cpm (range, 4 – 6 cpm) in the stomach and 19. 68 ± 0. 31 cpm (range, 18 – 22 cpm) in the duodenum. There were no consistent or dominant frequencies of the <b>slow</b> <b>waves</b> in the colon. The optimal parameters to entrain <b>slow</b> <b>waves</b> were: frequency of 1. 1 intrinsic frequency (IF; 10 % higher than IF) and pulse width of 150 – 450 ms (mean, 320. 0 ± 85. 4 ms) for the stomach, and 1. 1 IF and 10 – 20 ms for the small intestine. Electrical stimulation was not able to alter colon <b>slow</b> <b>waves.</b> The maximum entrainable frequency was 1. 27 IF in the stomach and 1. 21 IF in the duodenum. Gastrointestinal pacing was not blocked by vagotomy nor the application of an α- or β-adrenergic receptor antagonist; whereas the induction of gastric dysrhythmia with electrical stimulation was completely blocked by the application of the α- or β-adrenergic receptor antagonist. Gastrointestinal pacing is achievable in the stomach and small intestine but not the colon, and the maximal entrainable frequency of the gastric and small intestinal <b>slow</b> <b>waves</b> is about 20 % higher than the IF.

25|$|The drug {{causes a}} delay in the onset, and {{decrease}} in the duration of REM sleep. Following discontinuation of the drug, REM sleep rebound {{has been reported in}} some studies. Nitrazepam is reported to significantly affect stages of sleep - a decrease in stage 1, 3, and 4 sleep and an increase in stage 2. In young volunteers, the pharmacological properties of nitrazepam were found to produce sedation and impaired psychomotor performance and standing steadiness. EEG tests showed decreased alpha activity and increased the beta activity, according to blood plasma levels of nitrazepam. Performance was significantly impaired 13 hours after dosing with nitrazepam, as were decision-making skills. EEG tests show more drowsiness and light sleep 18 hours after nitrazepam intake, more so than amylobarbitone. Fast activity was recorded via EEG 18 hours after nitrazepam dosing. An animal study demonstrated that nitrazepam induces a drowsy pattern of spontaneous EEG including high-voltage slow waves and spindle bursts increase in the cortex and amygdala, while the hippocampal theta rhythm is desynchronized. Also low-voltage fast waves occur particularly in the cortical EEG. The EEG arousal response to auditory stimulation and to electric stimulation of the mesencephalic reticular formation, posterior hypothalamus and centromedian thalamus is significantly suppressed. The photic driving response elicited by a flash light in the visual cortex is also suppressed by nitrazepam. Estazolam was found to be more potent however. Nitrazepam increases the <b>slow</b> <b>wave</b> light sleep (SWLS) in a dose-dependent manner whilst suppressing deep sleep stages. Less time is spent in stages 3 and 4 which are the deep sleep stages, when benzodiazepines such as nitrazepam are used. Benzodiazepines are therefore not good hypnotics in the treatment of insomnia. The suppression of deep sleep stages by benzodiazepines may be especially problematic to the elderly as they naturally spend less time in the deep sleep stage.|$|E

According to a recent hypothesis, the homeostatic decrease of sleep SWA is due to a progressive decrease in the strength of corticocortical connections. This hypothesis was evaluated in a large-scale thalamocortical model, which showed that a decrease in synaptic strength, implemented through a reduction of postsynaptic currents, resulted in lower sleep SWA in simulated local field potentials (LFP). The decrease in SWA was associated with a decreased proportion of high-amplitude <b>slow</b> <b>waves,</b> a decreased slope of the <b>slow</b> <b>waves,</b> and {{an increase in the number}} of multipeak waves. Here we tested the model predictions by obtaining LFP recordings from the rat cerebral cortex and comparing conditions of high homeostatic sleep pressure (early sleep) and low homeostatic sleep pressure (late sleep). DESIGN: Intracortical LFP recordings during baseline sleep and after 6 hours of sleep deprivation. SETTING: Basic sleep research laboratory. PATIENTS OR PARTICIPANTS: WKY adult male rats. INTERVENTIONS: N/A. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Early sleep (sleep at the beginning of the major sleep phase, sleep immediately after sleep deprivation) was associated with (1) high SWA, (2) many large <b>slow</b> <b>waves,</b> (3) steep slope of <b>slow</b> <b>waves,</b> and (4) rare occurrence of multipeak waves. By contrast, late sleep (sleep at the end of the major sleep phase, sleep several hours after the end of sleep deprivation) was associated with (1) low SWA, (2) few high-amplitude <b>slow</b> <b>waves,</b> (3) reduced slope of <b>slow</b> <b>waves,</b> and (4) more frequent multipeak waves. CONCLUSION: In rats, changes in sleep SWA are associated with changes in the amplitude and slope of <b>slow</b> <b>waves,</b> and in the number of multi-peak waves. Such changes in slow-wave parameters are compatible with the hypothesis that average synaptic strength decreases {{in the course of}} sleep...|$|R
40|$|Delayed gastric {{emptying}} {{is common}} following severe large cutane-ous burns; however, {{the mechanisms of}} burn-induced delayed gastric emptying remain unknown. The {{aim of this study}} was to explore the possible involvement of hyperglycemia and cyclooxygenase- 2 recep-tors in the burn-induced gastric dysrhythmias. Gastric <b>slow</b> <b>waves</b> and gastric emptying were assessed in rats 6 h following sham or burn injury. Animals were randomized to one sham-burn and seven burn groups: untreated; two groups of saline treated (control); insulin treated (5 IU/kg); cyclooxygenase- 2 inhibitor treated (10 mg/kg); ghrelin treated (2 nmol/rat); and gastric electrical stimulation treated. It was found that 1) severe burn injury impaired gastric <b>slow</b> <b>waves</b> postprandially and delayed gastric emptying; 2) the impairment in gastric <b>slow</b> <b>waves</b> included a decrease in the slow-wave frequency and in the percentage of normal <b>slow</b> <b>waves,</b> and an increase in the percentage of bradygastria (P 0. 001, 0. 01, and 0. 01, respectively vs...|$|R

We show the existence and the stability of a fast wave and a family of <b>slow</b> <b>waves.</b> Fast waves {{are similar to those}} already described in continuum networks. Stable <b>slow</b> <b>waves</b> have not been previously reported in purely excitatory networks and their propagation is particular to the discrete nature of the network. The robustness of our results is studied in the presence of noise...|$|R
