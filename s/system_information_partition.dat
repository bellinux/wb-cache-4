We show that this approach provides a framework for a formal and rigorous treatment of questions of knowledge and common knowledge at every node of the tree.

40|$|Abstract—Recent {{developments}} in small satellites {{have led to}} an increasing interest in building satellite clusters as open systems that provide a “cluster-as-a-service ” in space. Since applications with different security classification levels must be supported in these open systems, the system must provide strict <b>information</b> <b>partitioning</b> such that only applications with matching security classifications interact with each other. The anonymous publish/subscribe communication pattern is a pow-erful interaction abstraction that has enjoyed great success in previous space software architectures, such as NASA’s Core Flight Executive. However, the difficulty is that existing solutions that support anonymous publish/subscribe communication, such as the OMG Data Distribution Service (DDS), do not support <b>information</b> <b>partitioning</b> based on security classifications, which is a key requirement for some systems. This paper makes two contributions to address these limitations. First, we present a transport mechanism called Secure Transport that uses a lattice of labels to represent security classifications and enforces Multi-Level Security (MLS) policies to ensure strict <b>information</b> <b>partitioning.</b> Second, we present a novel discovery service {{that allows us to}} use an existing DDS implementation with our custom transport mechanism to realize a publish/subscribe middleware with <b>information</b> <b>partitioning</b> based on security classifications of applications. We also include an evaluation of our solution {{in the context of a}} use case scenario. I...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the question whether}} interactive knowledge and common knowledge of <b>information</b> <b>partitions</b> are additional assumptions in the state-space model of knowledge. Robert Aumann and others have already discussed this issue, {{but in a way}} that appears unsatisfactory. This paper provides a thorough answer to the question in four steps. First, it makes clear the methodological nature of the puzzles surrounding interactive and common knowledge of <b>information</b> <b>partitions.</b> Second, it points out two properties – labeled as Substitutivity and Immediacy – that knowledge holds in the state-space model, and that have received little attention in the literature. Third, based on the previous two steps, the paper demonstrates that interactive and common knowledge of <b>information</b> <b>partitions</b> are not additional assumptions of the state-space model of knowledge; this is the main contribution of the work. Finally, the Appendix of the paper offers a critical examination of Aumann’s discussion of the issue...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Recently, several game {{theorists have}} {{questioned}} whether <b>information</b> <b>partitions</b> are appropriate. Bacharach (2005) has considered in particular more general information patterns {{which may not}} even correspond to a knowledge operator. Such patterns arise when agents lack perfect discrimination, as in Luce’s (1956) example of intransitive indif-ference. Yet after extending the state space to include what the agent knows, a modified <b>information</b> <b>partition</b> can still be constructed in a straightforward manner. The required modification introduces an extra set of impossible states into the partition. This allows a natural represention of the agent’s knowledge that some extended states are impossible.

40|$|The {{standard}} way of modelling imperfect {{information in}} games is {{in terms of}} <b>information</b> <b>partitions</b> for players. In this view, each player is associated with an equivalence relation over the set of game positions. For multiplayer games of imperfect information defined in this manner it turns out that most of the algorithmic questions like determining the winning strategy and synthesis of an equilibrium profile are undecidable. In this light, we propose a model where the players’ <b>information</b> <b>partitions</b> are generated explicitly by means of communication. We define a notion of locally consistent equilibrium and suggest that this captures the intuition of stable behaviour of players better. We show that when communication is by means of public announcements, the question of whether locally consistent equilibrium profile exists is decidable...|$|R

30|$|A {{comment on}} network {{partitions}} is relevant at this point. The three measures of Φ discussed above, {{make use of}} what is called the minimum <b>information</b> <b>partition</b> or minimum <b>information</b> bi-partition (MIP/MIB). The issue with this partitioning is that it leads to a combinatorial explosion in the number of configurations to be evaluated when working with networks having a large number of nodes. As a result, application of the above measures to compute integrated information of very large networks remains challenging, particularly for the scale of networks obtained from neuroimaging data. On the other hand, in earlier work (Arsiwalla and Verschure 2013), we have introduced a formulation of integrated information that overcomes both, the normalization and combinatorial problem by using a different partitioning of the network called the maximum <b>information</b> <b>partition</b> (MaxIP), which opens the prospect of large-scale applications. However, the formulation in (Arsiwalla and Verschure 2013) was only applicable for uncorrelated node dynamics, which may not be realistic enough for many biological systems.|$|R

It was assumed that readers of instructions construct both a procedural and a system mental model, and that the latter enables the readers to infer possible missing information in procedural instructions. Moreover, it was assumed that <b>system</b> <b>information</b> would increase the cognitive load during reading and practicing, and that it would affect the appreciation of the instructions as well as the self-efficacy of the reader. The participants in the experiment read instructions and practiced with a fictitious machine before performing a number of tasks and answering a questionnaire. The results indicate that <b>system</b> <b>information</b> increased the cognitive load during reading and decreased self-efficacy, while the instructional text with <b>system</b> <b>information</b> was judged as more difficult.
