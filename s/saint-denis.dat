5|$|In {{the final}} against Barcelona at the Stade de France in <b>Saint-Denis,</b> Paris, Arsenal fielded a 4–5–1 formation, with Eboué {{replacing}} the injured Lauren, and Cole making a return at left-back for Flamini.|$|E
5|$|La Grande Chaloupe between <b>Saint-Denis</b> and La Possession, one of {{the last}} {{remainders}} of the semi-evergreen forest once common in the west of the island, preserved and restored here.|$|E
5|$|On 13 November of {{the same}} year, a series of coordinated bomb and gunfire {{terrorist}} attacks in Paris and <b>Saint-Denis,</b> claimed by ISIL, killed 130 people and injured more than 350.|$|E
5|$|In addition, the Paris {{region is}} served by a light rail network of nine lines, the tramway: Line T1 runs from Asnières-Gennevilliers to Noisy-le-Sec, line T2 runs from Pont de Bezons to Porte de Versailles, line T3a runs from Pont du Garigliano to Porte de Vincennes, line T3b runs from Porte de Vincennes to Porte de la Chapelle, line T5 runs from <b>Saint-Denis</b> to Garges-Sarcelles, line T6 runs from Châtillon to Viroflay, line T7 runs from Villejuif to Athis-Mons, line T8 runs from <b>Saint-Denis</b> to Épinay-sur-Seine and Villetaneuse, {{all of which are}} {{operated}} by the Régie Autonome des Transports Parisiens, and line T4 runs from Bondy RER to Aulnay-sous-Bois, which is operated by the state rail carrier SNCF. Five new light rail lines are currently in various stages of development.|$|E
5|$|The Paris {{region is}} the most active water {{transport}} area in France, {{with most of the}} cargo handled by Ports of Paris in facilities located around Paris. The Loire, Rhine, Rhone, Meuse, and Scheldt rivers can be reached by canals connecting with the Seine, which include the Canal Saint-Martin, Canal <b>Saint-Denis,</b> and the Canal de l'Ourcq.|$|E
5|$|UEFA {{awarded the}} right to host the final to the Stade de France in <b>Saint-Denis</b> after {{considering}} its merits in terms of capacity, stadium infrastructure and dossiers including city and airport agreements and promotional plans. UEFA also conducted a variety of site visits. The Stade de France previously staged the 2000 UEFA Champions League Final between Real Madrid and Valencia, which Madrid won 30 {{and was the first}} time two clubs from the same country had faced each other in the final. <b>Saint-Denis</b> was chosen to host the final in recognition of the 50th anniversary of the first European Cup final in 1956, held in nearby Paris at the Parc des Princes, now home of Paris Saint-Germain. The Parc des Princes also hosted the 1975 and 1981 European Cup finals, the 1978 and 1995 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup finals, and the 1998 UEFA Cup Final.|$|E
5|$|Émilie {{departed}} on 3 September 1795 with a congé de navigation authorising her {{to defend}} herself, {{but not to}} take prizes as a privateer. The next day, she made a port call at <b>Saint-Denis</b> before cruising to Mahé. At Sainte Anne Island, two large British ships chased him, but {{he was able to}} evade them by sailing through the reefs, at night.|$|E
5|$|Catherine's {{ability to}} bear children, however, failed to improve her marriage. In 1534, {{at the age}} of 15, Henry had taken as his {{mistress}} the 38-year-old Diane de Poitiers, whom he adored {{for the rest of his}} life. Even so, he respected Catherine's status as his consort. When King Francis I died on 31 March 1547, Catherine became queen consort of France. She was crowned in the basilica of <b>Saint-Denis</b> on 10 June 1549.|$|E
5|$|Ever {{since moving}} out of Parc des Princes {{at the end of}} 1997, France's main home venue has been the Stade de France in <b>Saint-Denis,</b> where their home Six Nations matches are played. It has a {{capacity}} of 80,000. Since 2005, France has also played home internationals at the following venues around the country: Stade Chaban-Delmas, Grand Stade Lille Métropole (now known as Stade Pierre-Mauroy), Stade Gerland, Stade Vélodrome, Stade de la Mosson, Stade de la Beaujoire, Stade Bonal, Stadium Municipal, Toulouse.|$|E
5|$|For the 2007 World Cup, France was {{the primary}} host, and there were ten venues used for matches {{throughout}} the country (Cardiff in Wales and Edinburgh in Scotland also hosted some games). The French cities that hosted matches were Bordeaux (Stade Chaban-Delmas), Lens (Stade Félix Bollaert), Lyon (Stade Gerland), Marseille (Stade Vélodrome), Montpellier (Stade de la Mosson), Nantes (Stade de la Beaujoire), Paris (Stade de France, <b>Saint-Denis</b> and Parc des Princes), Saint-Étienne (Stade Geoffroy-Guichard), and Toulouse (Stadium de Toulouse). The final was played at Stade de France.|$|E
5|$|In {{advance of}} the storm {{striking}} Réunion, officials advised residents to remain inside. Officials ordered residents in Saint-Leu along the coast to evacuate inland, and at least 300people evacuated island-wide. The airport at <b>Saint-Denis</b> was closed, but reopened after the storm passed the island; several flights were canceled as a result. The main port was also closed, as were most childcare facilities, and mail service was suspended. Officials issued a red alert for the island, the first since Cyclone Dumile a year prior.|$|E
5|$|After this, {{the troops}} {{went to the}} nearby village of Saint-Philippe, where they stayed {{overnight}} and received assistance from the townspeople. Captain Holland contacted C. W. Bennett, the British Consul at <b>Saint-Denis,</b> and they secured passage to Mauritius on the SS Lalpoora, located at Pointe des Galets. After brief stops in Saint-Joseph and St. Pierre, the troops were transported to Pointe des Galets by train. The Lalpoora left Réunion on the mid-afternoon of 17 January, and they arrived in Mauritius early the next morning. The officers of Warren Hastings were praised for the discipline and bravery of the troops involved in the evacuation; however, Captain Holland had to face a court martial for losing the ship; he was reprimanded and subsequently acquitted.|$|E
5|$|France {{traditionally}} play in blue {{shirts with}} white shorts and red socks, and are {{commonly referred to}} as les tricolores or les bleus. The French emblem is a golden rooster imposed upon a red shield. Their alternative strip is composed of a white shirt and navy blue shorts and socks. French international matches are played at several venues across the country; the Stade de France in the Paris suburb of <b>Saint-Denis</b> is used for their games during the Six Nations, and they have a formidable home record at the Stade Vélodrome in Marseille where they have only lost twice, to Argentina in 2004 and to New Zealand in 2009.|$|E
5|$|Léopard {{had been}} {{selected}} to convince the Vichy government of La Réunion to join the Free French in June, but the collision and her consequent repairs delayed her mission. On the night of 27/28 November, she arrived off the island with 80 troops aboard. They were landed successfully and seized control of <b>Saint-Denis,</b> Réunion, the island's capital, although the governor fled into the interior. A coast-defense battery engaged the contre-torpilleur and she fired back, with men killed on both sides. The Vichy hold-outs surrendered on the 30th and Léopard remained in the Indian Ocean escorting convoys until March 1943.|$|E
5|$|Paris's {{most popular}} sport clubs are the {{association}} football club Paris Saint-Germain F.C. and the rugby union club Stade Français. The 80,000-seat Stade de France, {{built for the}} 1998 FIFA World Cup, is located just north of Paris in the commune of <b>Saint-Denis.</b> It is used for football, rugby union and track and field athletics. It hosts the French national football team for friendlies and major tournaments qualifiers, annually hosts the French national rugby team's home matches of the Six Nations Championship, and hosts several important matches of the Stade Français rugby team. In addition to Paris Saint-Germain FC, the city {{has a number of}} other professional and amateur football clubs: Paris FC, Red Star, RCF Paris and Stade Français Paris.|$|E
5|$|Retrieving his boats, Corbet {{determined}} to sail to Île Bourbon directly. By 04:00 on 12 September {{he had arrived}} at <b>Saint-Denis</b> and there landed his wounded and came ashore for news, learning that two French frigates were just offshore, blockading the port. The French ships had spotted Africaine in the harbour and despatched the small brig Entreprenant to Isle de France with information of her whereabouts, although Corbet had raised flags that successfully deceived the French into believing that his frigate was Rowley's flagship HMS Boadicea. The French ships were Astrée, commanded by Pierre Bouvet, and Iphigénie, formerly one of the British frigates captured at Grand Port, under René Lemarant de Kerdaniel.|$|E
5|$|Rowley, {{stationed}} at Saint-Paul {{to the west}} of <b>Saint-Denis,</b> received word that Africaine had arrived at Saint Denis and immediately sought to drive off the French blockade. Sailing eastwards, Boadicea came within sight of Bouvet's squadron at 15:00 and the British flagship followed by the small brigs HMS Otter and HMS Staunch. Corbet recognised Rowley's intention and joined the attack, embarking 25 soldiers from the 86th Regiment of Foot to replace his losses at Grand Bay. The French, still believing Africaine to be Boadicea, assumed that Boadicea was an East Indiaman named Windham in disguise, and fell back towards Isle de France before the British force.|$|E
5|$|The 1620s saw the {{fragmentation}} of the west wing of the original residence. Sold {{to a number of}} owners, this part of the building was gradually distorted until only a few remnants were left. The other three wings of the building were acquired by the Huraults of <b>Saint-Denis</b> in 1621, and on 5 July 1637 the residence was acquired by the Bégon family. In 1644, major restoration work was done on the north wing under Charles Turmel. The Hôtel d'Alluye was sold by Michel Bégon de la Picardière to the Terrouanne family on 5 August 1718 for 9,000 livres.|$|E
5|$|The 2006 UEFA Champions League Final was an {{association}} football match between Barcelona of Spain and Arsenal of England at the Stade de France in <b>Saint-Denis,</b> Paris, France, on Wednesday, 17 May 2006. It {{was the final}} match of the 2005–06 season of Europe's primary cup competition, the UEFA Champions League. Barcelona were appearing in their fifth final, having won the competition once in 1992, and lost the other three finals. Arsenal were appearing in the final {{for the first time}} and in doing so became the first club from London to feature in the final.|$|E
5|$|The French {{defenders}} of the town, despite initially resisting the attack, were unable to prevent the seizure of the port's defensive fortifications. The British force later withdrew {{under pressure from the}} main garrison of the island, burning warehouses containing over £500,000 worth of silk captured from British merchant ships. Ultimately the French were unable to effectively oppose the invasion, the island's governor General Des Bruslys retreating to <b>Saint-Denis</b> rather than engage the British and later committing suicide. The transportation of forces from the recently captured island of Rodrigues, the co-ordination of land and naval forces and the failure of the French defenders to co-ordinate an effective response were all features of the subsequent invasion and capture of Île Bonaparte in July 1810.|$|E
5|$|The {{association}} {{football club}} Paris Saint-Germain and the rugby union club Stade Français {{are based in}} Paris. The 80,000-seat Stade de France, built for the 1998 FIFA World Cup, is located just north of Paris in the neighbouring commune of <b>Saint-Denis.</b> Paris hosts the annual French Open Grand Slam tennis tournament on the red clay of Roland Garros. Paris hosted the Olympic Games in 1900, 1924 and will host the 2024 Summer Olympics. The 1938 and 1998 FIFA World Cups, the 2007 Rugby World Cup, and the 1960, 1984, and 2016 UEFA European Championships were also held in the city, and every July, the Tour de France bicycle race finishes in the city.|$|E
5|$|Commodore Josias Rowley {{was given}} {{command of the}} British {{response}} to the French deployment, a hastily assembled force composed mainly of those ships available at the Cape of Good Hope in early 1809. Ordered to stop the French raiders, Rowley was unable to spread his limited squadron wide enough to pursue the roving French frigates, instead using his forces to blockade and raid the French Indian Ocean islands in anticipation of Hamelin's return. In August 1809, Caroline arrived with her prizes at Saint-Paul on Île Bonaparte and Rowley determined to seize the frigate. He planned a successful invasion of the town, launched on 20 September, 1809, {{which resulted in the}} capture of the port's defences, Caroline and the captured East Indiamen. With his objectives complete, Rowley withdrew five days later. Almost a year later, Rowley returned with a larger task force and made a second landing around the capital of Île Bonaparte, <b>Saint-Denis.</b> Marching on the seat of government, Rowley's troops rapidly overwhelmed the defences and forced the island's garrison to surrender, renaming the island Île Bourbon and installing a British governor.|$|E
5|$|Parisian {{examples}} of European architecture date {{back more than}} a millennium; including the Romanesque church of the Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Prés (1014–1163); the early Gothic Architecture of the Basilica of <b>Saint-Denis</b> (1144), the Notre Dame Cathedral (1163–1345), the Flamboyant Gothic of Saint Chapelle (1239–1248), the Baroque churches of Saint-Paul-Saint-Louis (1627–1641) and Les Invalides (1670–1708). The 19th century produced the neoclassical church of La Madeleine (1808–1842); the Palais Garnier Opera House (1875); the neo-Byzantine Basilica of Sacré-Cœur (1875–1919), and the exuberant Belle Époque modernism of the Eiffel Tower (1889). Striking {{examples of}} 20th-century architecture include the Centre Georges Pompidou by Richard Rogers and Renzo Piano (1977), and the Louvre Pyramid by I.M. Pei (1989). Contemporary architecture includes the Musée du Quai Branly by Jean Nouvel (2006) and the new contemporary art museum of the Louis Vuitton Foundation by Frank Gehry (2014).|$|E
5|$|In June 1937 the Old Vic company took up an {{invitation}} to perform Hamlet {{in the courtyard of}} the castle at Elsinore, where Shakespeare located the play. Olivier secured the casting of Leigh to replace Cherry Cottrell as Ophelia. Because of torrential rain the performance had to be moved from the castle courtyard to the ballroom of a local hotel, but the tradition of playing Hamlet at Elsinore was established, and Olivier was followed by, among others, Gielgud (1939), Redgrave (1950), Richard Burton (1954), Derek Jacobi (1979), Kenneth Branagh (1988) and Jude Law (2009). Back in London, the company staged Macbeth, with Olivier in the title role. The stylised production by Michel <b>Saint-Denis</b> was not well liked, but Olivier had some good notices among the bad. On returning from Denmark, Olivier and Leigh told their respective spouses about the affair and that their marriages were over; Esmond moved out of the marital house and in with her mother. After Olivier and Leigh made a tour of Europe in mid 1937 they returned to separate film projects—A Yank at Oxford for her and The Divorce of Lady X for him—and moved into a property together in Iver, Buckinghamshire.|$|E

25|$|The Coronation in <b>Saint-Denis</b> is {{the last}} scene on the North End of the West Wall, showing the {{completion}} of Marie's divinely assisted preparation. It {{would be one of}} two paintings most visually apparent upon entrance into the gallery through the southeast corner. Rubens composes The Coronation in <b>Saint-Denis</b> for distanced viewing by employing accents of red. For example, the robes of two cardinals near the right edge. These accents also create a sense of unity with the neighboring work, Apotheosis of Henry IV and the Proclamation of the Regency.|$|E
