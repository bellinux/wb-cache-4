50|$|On January 11, 1995, WXON {{became a}} charter {{affiliate}} of the upstart WB Television Network. Granite Broadcasting bought WXON {{two years later}} in January 1997 and on October 14 of that year, the station's call letters were changed to WDWB. In 2004, the station became the new over-the-air broadcast home of the NBA's Detroit Pistons, taking the rights from the team's longtime broadcaster, WKBD and was the broadcast home for 15 to 20 Detroit Tigers baseball games produced by Fox Sports Net Detroit. WDWB carried the full WB network schedule, but after joining the network it frequently preempted programming that it rescheduled or did not air in favor of programming such as movies, Big Ten Conference basketball, the Pistons, the Tigers, and from 1999 until 2012, the Jerry Lewis MDA Telethon. Like the baseball and basketball games, the annual MDA telethon was broadcast live, but since the station had no studios to accommodate the local telethon segments, it was produced out <b>of</b> the <b>studios</b> <b>of</b> PBS <b>member</b> <b>station</b> WTVS (channel 56) in the New Center section of downtown Detroit.|$|R
50|$|The PBS service {{generally}} {{does not}} offer local programming content. Instead, it broadcasts content produced for a national audience distributed via satellites. There is no generally accepted right of access for citizens to use broadcast <b>studio</b> facilities <b>of</b> PBS <b>member</b> <b>stations,</b> nor right <b>of</b> access by community content producers to the airwaves stewarded by these television stations outside of some universities or technical colleges such as Milwaukee's Milwaukee Area Technical College, which owns the area's two PBS <b>member</b> <b>stations</b> and offers students the limited ability (within FCC guidelines) to produce their own programs to air on a public television station for television production experience. These qualities are {{in stark contrast to}} PEG channel content, which is mostly locally produced, especially in conjunction with local origination studio facilities. And {{in the case of the}} P, public-access television, the facilities and channel capacity are uncurated free-speech zones available to anyone for free or little cost.|$|R

The Dick Cavett Show, another very popular series but one “not critical to the PBS core mission,” had been eliminated the year before.|$|R
