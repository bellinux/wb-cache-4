50|$|Mortise locks {{may include}} a {{non-locking}} sprung latch {{operated by a}} door handle. Such a lock is termed a <b>sash</b> <b>lock.</b> A simpler form without a handle or latch is termed a 'dead lock'. Dead locks are commonly used as a secure backup to a sprung non-deadlocking latch, usually a pin tumbler rim lock.|$|E
50|$|The Lever lock {{door handle}} on a {{backplate}} is {{another type of}} door handle which operates similarly to the lever latch door handle. This type of handle on a backplate consists of a lever and just below it, a key hole cut. This allows a key to be inserted into the door to control a mortice <b>sash</b> <b>lock.</b> Just the like the lever latch, the door can be opened and shut by pushing the handle but can also be locked using a key. This locking mechanism is why this type of door handle is used for front and back doors of residential housing.|$|E

25|$|After {{the first}} double murder, some parents warned their {{children}} about being out late. The second double murder shocked {{the city and}} curfews were set for businesses. The height of the town's hysteria snowballed after the murder of Virgil Starks. The Texarkana Gazette stated on Sunday, May 5, that the killer might strike again at any moment, at any place and at any one. Before, it was normal to leave your house unlocked, but soon residents started locking doors, pulling down shades, blocking windows, and arming themselves with guns. Some people would nail sheets over their windows or nail the window down. Some used screened-door braces as window guards. The next day after Starks' death, several residents bought firearms and locks. Stores sold out of locks, guns, ammunition, and window shades and Venetian blinds. Other items that sold well included window <b>sash</b> <b>locks,</b> screen door hooks, night latches, and other protective devices.|$|R
50|$|A {{variant of}} the face cam {{provides}} motion parallel to the axis of cam rotation. A common example is the traditional <b>sash</b> window <b>lock,</b> where the cam is mounted {{to the top of}} the lower sash, and the follower is the hook on the upper sash. In this application, the cam is used to provide mechanical advantage in forcing the window shut, and also provides a self-locking action, like some worm gears, due to friction.|$|R
