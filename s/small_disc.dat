5|$|As {{early as}} 1926, Meyer {{had written to}} Irène Joliot-Curie {{suggesting}} that Rona work with her to learn how his laboratory could make their own polonium samples. Once Hans Pettersson was able to secure funds to pay Rona's expenses, Joliot-Curie allowed her to come and study polonium separation at the Curie Institute in Paris. Rona developed an enhanced method of preparing polonium sources and producing alpha-emissions.(α-emission). Gaining recognition as {{an expert in the}} field, she took those skills back to the Radium Institute along with a <b>small</b> <b>disc</b> of polonium. This disc allowed Rona to create lab specimens of polonium, which were used in much of the Institute's subsequent research.|$|E

25|$|The GameCube is {{the first}} Nintendo console to use optical discs as its primary storage medium. The discs {{are similar to the}} miniDVD format; {{as a result of their}} smaller size and the console's <b>small</b> <b>disc</b> compartment, the system was not {{designed}} to play standard DVDs or audio CDs. The console supports online gaming for a small number of its titles via the broadband or modem adapter and connects to the Game Boy Advance via the link cable, allowing players to access exclusive in-game features using the handheld as a second screen and controller.|$|E
25|$|Rather than {{measuring}} the thermal conductivity using the traditional {{methods such as}} Lees' disk, the Forbes' method, or Searle's bar, {{it is common to}} use Laser Flash Analysis where a <b>small</b> <b>disc</b> of fuel is placed in a furnace. After being heated to the required temperature one side of the disc is illuminated with a laser pulse, the time required for the heat wave to flow through the disc, the density of the disc, and the thickness of the disk can then be used to calculate and determine the thermal conductivity.|$|E

After {{beginning}} to transform into a beast, he admits that [...] "Conrad" [...] dosed them before Peter Bishop (Joshua Jackson) pauses the process by administering a sedative and placing him in an induced coma. Walter develops an antidote, while Olivia finds another <b>small</b> <b>disc</b> in Hicks' hand. Her demand to see Scott's body leads her and Phillip Broyles (Lance Reddick) to Massive Dynamic, where Nina Sharp (Blair Brown) tells her that the information gleaned from Scott's body implicates him in a bioterrorist cell with the other two.|$|E

500|$|Simultaneous {{to these}} events, Peter has {{attempted}} to flee to New York City and points beyond {{to stay away from}} Olivia, fearing that staying near her would further erode her original memories. Walter calls him back, identifying that the Observer September (Michael Cerveris) had implanted something in Peter's eye during the events of the previous episode. The <b>small</b> <b>disc</b> reveals a nearby address, where Peter finds a stash of September's Observer equipment, including a GPS-like device that leads him to a strange pod (as shown previously in [...] "The Arrival"). Peter is ultimately able to activate the pod, where September appears. September states the pod acts as a beacon, allowing him to return after the other Observers hid the universe from him. In response to Peter's questions about trying to return to his own timeline, September states that Peter is actually home; he was never truly erased from time as his love for his friends, and their love for him brought him back. September soon vanishes, and the pod buries itself in the ground. The episode closes as Peter and Olivia rejoin each other with a passionate kiss.|$|E
2500|$|The {{southern}} gastric-brooding frog was a dull grey to slate coloured frog {{that had}} small patches, both darker and {{lighter than the}} background colouration, scattered over dorsal surface (back). The ventral surface was white or cream, occasionally with yellow blotches. The arms and legs had darker brown barring above and were yellow underneath. There was a dark stripe that ran from the eye {{to the base of}} the forelimb. The ventral surface (belly) was white with large patches of cream or pale yellow. The toes and fingers were light brown with pale brown flecking. The end of each digit had a <b>small</b> <b>disc</b> and the iris was dark brown. The skin was finely granular and the tympanum was hidden. The male Southern Gastric Brooding Frog was [...] in length and the female [...] in length.|$|E

A disc of copper, one {{fifth of}} an inch thick and only one {{inch and a half}} in diameter, was amalgamated at the edge; a square piece of sheet lead (copper would have been better) of equal {{thickness}} had a circular hole cut in it, into which the disc loosely fitted; a little mercury completed the metallic communication of the disc and its surrounding ring; the latter was attached to one of the galvanometer wires, and the other wire dipped into a little metallic cup containing mercury, fixed upon the top of the copper axis of the <b>small</b> <b>disc.</b> Upon rotating the disc in a horizontal plane, the galvanometer needle could be affected, although the earth was the only magnet employed, and the radius of the disc but three quarters {{of an inch}}; in which space only the current was excited.|$|E

If instead of the ball B a <b>small</b> <b>disc</b> of metal be used, the carrier may be charged at, or above the middle of its upper surface: but if the plate be enlarged to about 1-1/2 or 2 inches in diameter, C (fig. 108.), then no charge {{will be given to}} the carrier at f, though when applied nearer to the edge at g, or even above the middle at h, a charge will be obtained; and this is true though the plate may be a mere thin film of gold-leaf. Hence {{it is clear that the}} induction is not through the metal, but through the surrounding air or dielectric, and that in curved lines.|$|E
6000|$|Go down at low spring-tide to {{the nearest}} ledge of rocks, and with a hammer and chisel chip off {{a few pieces of}} stone covered with growing sea-weed. Avoid the common and coarser kinds (fuci) which cover the surface of the rocks; for they give out under water a slime which will foul your tank: but choose the more {{delicate}} species which fringe the edges of every pool at low-water mark; the pink coralline, the dark purple ragged dulse (Rhodymenia), the Carrageen moss (Chondrus), and above all, the commonest of all, the delicate green Ulva, which you will see growing everywhere in wrinkled fan-shaped sheets, as thin as the finest silver-paper. [...] The smallest bits of stone are sufficient, provided the sea-weeds have hold of them; for they have no real roots, but adhere by a <b>small</b> <b>disc,</b> deriving no nourishment from the rock, but only from the water. Take care, meanwhile, that there be as little as possible on the stone, beside the weed itself. Especially scrape off any small sponges, and see that no worms have made their twining tubes of sand among the weed-stems; if they have, drag them out; for they will surely die, and as surely spoil all by sulphuretted hydrogen, blackness, and evil smells.|$|E
60|$|Carina.--This {{is always}} very narrow and curved, concave within, often carinated and barbed exteriorly; it extends upwards between the terga for one half or {{two thirds of}} their length: at the lower {{extremity}} it ends (with the exception of L. fascicularis), in a small fork (Pl. I, fig. 1, a, b) rectangularly inflected and embedded in the membrane, beneath the basal margin of the scuta. From comparing this {{lower part of the}} carina in L. australis (fig. 5 a), with the same part in some of the species of the allied genus Pæcilasma, {{it would appear that the}} fork is formed by an oblong disc, more and more notched at the end, and with the rim between the two points more or less folded backwards: conformably with this view, in very young specimens of L. australis, instead of a large and sharp fork, there is a <b>small</b> <b>disc.</b> The only use of the fork appears to be to give firm attachment to the membrane uniting the valves and peduncle. In L. fascicularis, instead of a fork, there is a broad, oblong disc (figs. 6, 6 a), rectangularly inflected; it is much longer than the fork, in proportion to the upper part of the carina; the disc is not more deeply embedded than the upper part. The umbo (and primordial valve when distinguishable,) of the carina is seated just above the embedded fork (or disc in L. fascicularis), at the point where the inflection takes place; hence the main growth of the carina is upwards,--the fork, however, being of course, likewise added to at its point: in L. fascicularis, the growth is both upwards and downwards.|$|E
50|$|Larger rotors {{can be used}} to {{increase}} braking force, but this also increases weight and inertia. To overcome this brake manufacturers developed calipers four, six and even eight pistons.Increasing the number of pistons increases the swept piston area, allowing for longer, narrower brake pads and <b>smaller</b> <b>discs.</b>|$|R
50|$|Omni wheels or poly wheels, {{similar to}} Mecanum wheels, are wheels with <b>small</b> <b>discs</b> around the {{circumference}} which are {{perpendicular to the}} turning direction. The effect is that the wheel can be driven with full force, but will also slide laterally with great ease. These wheels are often employed in holonomic drive systems.|$|R
