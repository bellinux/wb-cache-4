5|$|Sire, be not grieved nor greatly distressed {{because of}} what has befallen us. It is not on things of wood that the issue hangs for us, but on men and horses...If then you so desire, let us {{straightway}} attack the Peloponnese, or if it pleases you to wait, that also we can do...It is best then that you should do as I have said, {{but if you have}} resolved to lead your army away, even then I have another plan. Do not, O king, make the Persians the laughing-stock of the Greeks, for if you have suffered harm, it is by no fault of the Persians. Nor can you <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> anywhere done less than brave men should, and if Phoenicians and Egyptians and Cyprians and Cilicians have so done, it is not the Persians who have any part in this disaster. Therefore, since the Persians are in no way to blame, be guided by me; if you are resolved not to remain, march homewards with the greater part of your army. It is for me, however, to enslave and deliver Hellas to you with three hundred thousand of your host whom I will choose.|$|E
500|$|Quantico was {{designed}} with over a half-dozen core characters, {{in addition to}} Alex Parrish, for pacing reasons. It was intended to have a flashback narrative, shifting between [...] "the present day with Parrish navigating her way through a class of FBI New Agent Trainees to the near future as the truth and repercussions of the attack emerge". Safran also used flashforwards to spread out the series' plot points. He said in a 2015 interview that although the series is [...] "intricately plotted", it {{does not intend to}} overwhelm the viewer, saying: [...] "It is tightly structured and moves quickly between two, sometimes three, time periods, but we made sure that it's not so complicated that it just feels like too much. I like to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> a lot of tributaries, but they all lead to one ocean". The series' diverse cast has helped its writers create a variety of storylines and plot points. According to a Variety article on Safran and Quantico, [...] "The show delves below the surface into those disparate backgrounds to explore how each character’s personal stories influence their motivations for joining the FBI and in their perspective on the search for truth in the terrorism investigation. That offers a wealth of engaging material for writers to mine". Safran modeled Quantico on Buffy the Vampire Slayer in structure, with self-contained story arcs from season to season. Its producers said that each season would have a specific storyline, with Alex the series' focal point surrounded by a new cast.|$|E

2500|$|Following the November 2015 Paris attacks, {{a cartoon}} in the Daily Mail by Stanley McMurtry ("Mac") linked the European migrant crisis (with {{a focus on}} Syria in particular) to the {{terrorist}} attacks, and criticised the European Union immigration laws for allowing Islamist radicals to gain easy access into the United Kingdom. Despite being compared to Nazi propaganda by The New York Times, and criticised as [...] "reckless xenophobia," [...] and racist, the cartoon received praise on the Mail Online website. A Daily Mail spokesperson told The Independent: [...] "We {{are not going to}} dignify these absurd comments which wilfully misrepresent this cartoon apart from to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> not received a single complaint from any reader".|$|E
2500|$|Beginning in the 1850s, the {{restaurant}} hosted the annual {{gathering of the}} New England Society of New York, which featured many important speakers of the day. In 1860, Delmonico's provided the supper at the Grand Ball welcoming the Prince of Wales at the Academy of Music on East 14th Street. Supper was set out in a specially constructed room; the menu was French, and the pièces montées represented Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, the Great Eastern and Flora's Vase. The New York Times reported, [...] "We may frankly <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> never seen a public supper served in a more inapproachable fashion, with greater discretion, or upon a more luxurious scale". In 1862, {{the restaurant}} hired Charles Ranhofer, {{considered one of the}} greatest chefs of his day.|$|E
2500|$|Shortly {{before the}} opening, {{members of the}} {{neighboring}} Grace Baptist Church erected 13 white crosses in a field {{across the road from}} the mosque [...] "to make a statement to the Muslims about how we felt about our religion, our Christianity. We wanted them to see the crosses and know how we felt about things." [...] Ossama Bahloul of the ICM told worshippers, [...] "This day is a day of forgiveness. We want to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> nothing bad in our heart against anyone." [...] The New York Times praised the forbearance of the ICM's members in an editorial published on August 19, noting that [...] "ith patience and dignity, the Islamic Americans of Murfreesboro learned the hard way the endless American lesson that constitutional rights don't come guaranteed." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 10 December 2007, updates by Jagex removed free player-versus-player {{combat and}} {{unbalanced}} trading {{in order to}} rid the game of activities involving real currency being traded for virtual goods. The updates also affected legitimate players, resulting in many of them actively complaining on the forums. Jagex issued a Customer Support News article admitting the updates {{may not have been}} an ideal replacement for what was removed, requesting patience and promising to remedy potential problems with updates in the future. During the changes, subscription numbers fell by 60,000. No figures were given as to how many of those subscriptions belonged to legitimate players and how many to gold farmers. In an interview in February 2008, Jagex's head of content stated that, [...] "we were really afraid we were going to lose our members over this change, because other games had in the past. But we are very, very pleased to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> lost practically none of our members." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{differences}} between Romans and Goths in Ostrogothic Ravenna were never as clearly defined {{as they were}} along religious lines. The Goths followed the Arian branch of Christianity, while the Romans practiced Orthodoxy. Both considered the other to be heretics. Theodoric, however, was the keystone in maintaining order amongst the peoples that he ruled, commanding respect and fear in equal measure from both Romans and Goths alike. Upon his taking of power the Orthodox bishops and leaders of Ravenna were allowed to keep their posts, but not had to enter into power sharing with Arian counterparts. In his Variae Cassiodorus has letters he penned for Theodoric that show his toleration as well as protection of the Orthodox Church. In one such letter Theodoric had Cassiodorus write, this time to Faustus, a Roman prefect, saying [...] "'The Defensores of the Holy Church of Milan want to be enabled to buy as cheap as possible the things which they need for the relief of the poor; and they <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> bestowed this favor on the Church of Ravenna. 'Your Magnificence will therefore allow them to single out some one merchant who shall buy {{for them in the}} market, without being subject to monopoly, siliquaticum, or the payment of gold-fee." ...|$|E
2500|$|Dorothy L. Sayers {{notes that}} Satan's three faces are thought {{by some to}} suggest his control over the three human races: red for the Europeans (from Japheth), yellow for the Asiatic (from Shem), and black for the African (the race of Ham). All interpretations {{recognize}} that the three faces represent a fundamental perversion of the Trinity: Satan is impotent, ignorant, and full of hate, {{in contrast to the}} all-powerful, all-knowing, and all-loving nature of God. Lucifer retains his six wings (he originally belonged to the angelic order of Seraphim, described in Isaiah 6:2), but these are now dark, bat-like, and futile: the icy wind that emanates from the beating of Lucifer's wings only further ensures his own imprisonment in the frozen lake. He weeps from his six eyes, and his tears mix with bloody froth and pus as they pour down his three chins. Each face has a mouth that chews eternally on a prominent traitor. Marcus Junius Brutus and Gaius Cassius Longinus dangle with their feet in the left and right mouths, respectively, for their involvement in the assassination of Julius Caesar (March 15, 44 BC) – an act which, to Dante, represented the destruction of a unified Italy and the killing of the man who was divinely appointed to govern the world. In the central, most vicious mouth is Judas Iscariot, the apostle who betrayed Christ. Judas is receiving the most horrifying torture of the three traitors: his head is gnawed inside Lucifer's mouth while his back is forever flayed and shredded by Lucifer's claws. According to Dorothy L. Sayers, [...] "just as Judas figures treason against God, so Brutus and Cassius figure treason against Man-in-Society; or we may <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> here the images of treason against the Divine and the Secular government of the world".|$|E

60|$|Is {{this speech}} self-righteous? If so, it {{is a bad}} speech; for self- righteousness is a bad temper of mind; there are few worse.

If we confess our sins, God is {{faithful}} and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
