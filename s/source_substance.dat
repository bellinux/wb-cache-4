40|$|Aim The aims of {{this paper}} were to {{catalogue}} {{a complete list of}} all the alphabetical names for vitamins that have appeared in the scientific literature, provide the citations of their first use and seek explanations for any apparent gaps in the naming system. Methods The names of known vitamins and pseudo-vitamins were identified from standard nutrition textbooks, historical monographs and several review articles. If the first citation for the alphabetical vitamin name was not found in these sources, additional searches were conducted in the Scopus and Medline databases, in Google and Google Scholar, using the names of vitamins as search terms. Results Sixty-seven different alphabet-based vitamin names were tabulated, including where possible the scientific and alternative names, a description of the <b>source</b> <b>substance,</b> physiological roles and the first citation of the alphabetical name. The results show that all the letters of the alphabet have been used to describe putative vitamin compounds. The simple alphabetical naming system proposed by Drummond in 1920 lasted for less than a decade. A number of other systems have been used based on the name of the discoverer, the source of the material or its physiological function. Conclusions Using simplified alphabetical names may assist in nutrition communication and education of the general public, but dietitians need to be careful to maintain a clear understanding of the proper biochemical distinctions and nomenclatures of the known vitamins, especially when writing for academic publication...|$|E

In a virtual case study, we selected MCPP as target substance and MCPA and 2, 4 -DP as source substances with the goal to waive a 90 -day study with MCPP. In order to develop a convincing case to show how biological data can substantiate read across, we used metabolomics on blood samples from the 28 -day studies to show the qualitative and quantitative similarity of the substances. The 28 -day metabolome evaluation of source substances and the target substance indicate liver and kidneys as target organs. 2, 4 -DP was identified as the best <b>source</b> <b>substance.</b> Using the information of the 90 -day 2, 4 -DP study, we predicted MCPP's toxicity profile at 2500  ppm: reduced food consumption and body weight gain, liver and kidney weight increases with clinical-pathology changes and a moderate red blood cell parameter reduction. NOEL prediction for MCPP was below that of 2, 4 -DP (< 500  ppm), and {{similar to that of}} MCPA (≥ 150  ppm). Qualitatively, these predictions are comparable to the results of the real MCPP 90 -day study in rats (reduced food consumption and body weight gain, weight increases and clinical-pathology changes in liver and kidneys, reduced red blood cells values). Quantitatively, the predicted NOAEL (150  ppm) is similar to the actual study (NOEL =  75  ppm, NOAEL ≤  500  ppm).

Research {{indicates}} that homeopathic remedies (a) contain measurable source and silica nanoparticles heterogeneously dispersed in colloidal solution; (b) act by modulating biological {{function of the}} allostatic stress response network (c) evoke biphasic actions on living systems via organism-dependent adaptive and endogenously amplified effects; (d) improve systemic resilience. Discussion The proposed active components of homeopathic remedies are nanoparticles of <b>source</b> <b>substance</b> in water-based colloidal solution, not bulk-form drugs. Nanoparticles have unique biological and physico-chemical properties, including increased catalytic reactivity, protein and DNA adsorption, bioavailability, dose-sparing, electromagnetic, and quantum effects different from bulk-form materials. Trituration and/or liquid succussions during classical remedy preparation create “top-down” nanostructures. Plants can biosynthesize remedy-templated silica nanostructures. Nanoparticles stimulate hormesis, a beneficial low-dose adaptive response. Homeopathic remedies prescribed in low doses spaced intermittently over time act as biological signals that stimulate the organism’s allostatic biological stress response network, evoking nonlinear modulatory, self-organizing change. Potential mechanisms include time-dependent sensitization (TDS), a type of adaptive plasticity/metaplasticity involving progressive amplification of host responses, which reverse direction and oscillate at physiological limits. To mobilize hormesis and TDS, the remedy must be appraised as a salient, but low level, novel threat, stressor, or homeostatic disruption for the whole organism. Silica nanoparticles adsorb remedy source and amplify effects. Properly-timed remedy dosing elicits disease-primed compensatory reversal in direction of maladaptive dynamics of the allostatic network, thus promoting resilience and recovery from disease. Summary Homeopathic remedies are proposed as source nanoparticles that mobilize hormesis and time-dependent sensitization via non-pharmacological effects on specific biological adaptive and amplification mechanisms. The nanoparticle nature of remedies would distinguish them from conventional bulk drugs in structure, morphology, and functional properties. Outcomes would depend upon {{the ability of the}} organism to respond to the remedy as a novel stressor or heterotypic biological threat, initiating reversals of cumulative, cross-adapted biological maladaptations underlying disease in the allostatic stress response network.

Here, we combined read-across as non-testing strategy with a tiered exposure assessment for the risk characterisation of 1 -methoxypropan- 2 -ol (PGME) as a representative for phase-in substances to be registered under REACH. Read-across from the selected <b>source</b> <b>substances</b> provided data which were comparable with experimental data available for target substance PGME, resulting in a realistic starting point for both qualitative and quantitative risk assessment. Greater variability was observed in the exposure estimates from a first Tier model (ECETOC TRA) or less conservative further Tier models (Stoffenmanager; RISKOFDERM), when these results were compared with results from a data-rich approach using measured data. When safe use of chemicals cannot be demonstrated with these approaches, refinement can be introduced in the estimation of hazard and exposure, or both. In view of the variability associated with exposure modeling, it may often add more value to invest in realistic exposure data than in toxicity studies, apart from animal welfare considerations. © 2010 Elsevier Inc...|$|R
30|$|Alginate is a low-cost, biocompatible, biodegradable, {{and easily}} <b>sourced</b> <b>substance,</b> and is {{generally}} considered non-immunogenic [55, 56]. Hydrogel nanoparticles formed by crosslinked alginate {{have been used for}} the encapsulation of various therapeutics [56]. These processes vary from surfactant-driven formation of inverse micelles [39] to mechanical stimuli or temperature-induced formation of particles [41]. We present a simple and robust means of producing relatively monodisperse alginate nanocarriers. This synthesis process is carried out at room temperature (unlike as presented by Machado et al.) and can be performed in just a few hours. The inverse micelle process incorporates aqueous-soluble therapeutics into the alginate matrix, without the need for chemical modification. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements of the alginate nanoparticles showed uniform distributions of particles ~[*] 80 – 90  nm. Electron microscopy confirmed the sizes and the rough spherical morphology of the particles. Doxorubicin encapsulated in the alginate matrix of the nanoparticles shows distinct in vitro efficacy relative to free doxorubicin, indicating that future studies could investigate the efficacy of the therapeutics in vivo.|$|R
