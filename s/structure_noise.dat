Although {{the recent}} {{advances}} in the sparse representations of images have achieved outstanding denosing results, removing real, <b>structured</b> <b>noise</b> in digital videos remains a challenging problem.

40|$|Abstract – In this paper, a new fast {{algorithm}} for dental diseases detection is presented. Such algorithm {{relies on}} performing cross correlation {{in the frequency}} domain between input image and the input weights of fast neural networks (FNNs). It is proved mathematically and practically {{that the number of}} computation steps required for the presented FNNs is less than that needed by conventional neural networks (CNNs). Simulation results using MATLAB confirm the theoretical computations. One of the limitations of Direct Digital Radiography (DDR) is noise. Some recent publications have indicated that Digital Subtraction Radiography (DSR) might significantly aid in the clinical diagnosis of dental diseases, once various clinical logistic problems limiting its widespread use have been over come. Noise in digital radiography may result from sources other than variation in projection geometry during exposure. <b>Structure</b> <b>noise</b> consists of all anatomic features other than those of diagnostic interest.

40|$|We {{give new}} {{algorithms}} {{for a variety}} of randomly-generated instances of computational problems using a linearization technique that reduces to solving a system of linear equations. These algorithms are derived in the context of learning with <b>structured</b> <b>noise,</b> a notion introduced in this paper. This notion is best illustrated with the learning parities with noise (LPN) problem —well-studied in learning theory and cryptography. In the standard version, we have access to an oracle that, each time we press a button, returns a random vector a ∈ GF(2) n together with a bit b ∈ GF(2) that was computed as a · u + η, where u ∈ GF(2) n is a secret vector, and η ∈ GF(2) is a noise bit that is 1 with some probability p. Say p = 1 / 3. The goal is to recover u. This task is conjectured to be intractable. In the <b>structured</b> <b>noise</b> setting we introduce a slight (?) variation of the model: upon pressing a button, we receive (say) 10 random vectors a 1, a 2, [...] ., a 10 ∈ GF(2) n, and corresponding bits b 1, b 2, [...] ., b 10, of which at most 3 are noisy. The oracle may arbitrarily decide which of the 10 bits to make noisy. We exhibit a polynomial-time algorithm to recover the secret vector u given such an oracle. We think this <b>structured</b> <b>noise</b> model may be of independent interest in machine learning. We discuss generalizations of our result, including learning with more general noise patterns. We also give the first nontrivial algorithms for two problems, which we show fit in our <b>structured</b> <b>noise</b> framework. We give a slightly subexponential algorithm for the well-known learning with errors (LWE) problem over GF(q) introduced by Regev for cryptographic uses. Our algorithm works for the case when the gaussian noise is small; which was an open problem.

Here, we investigated whether a novel clean up tool for <b>structured</b> <b>noise</b> was capable of reducing center-related R-fMRI differences between healthy subjects. We analyzed 3 Tesla R-fMRI data from 72 subjects, half of whom were scanned with eyes closed in a Philips Achieva system in The Netherlands, and half of whom were scanned with eyes open in a Siemens Trio system in the UK. After pre-statistical processing and individual Independent Component Analysis (ICA), FMRIB’s ICA-based X-noiseifier (FIX) was used to remove noise components from the data. GICA and dual regression were run and non-parametric statistics were used to compare spatial maps between groups before and after applying FIX. Large significant differences were found in all resting-state networks between study sites before using FIX, most of which were reduced to non-significant after applying FIX. The between-center difference in the medial/primary visual network, presumably reflecting a between-center difference in protocol, remained statistically different.

The tests confirmed that vibration reduction effects by vibration control could be predicted from total loss factor of the surface before and after vibration control, and they confirmed that measurement values and predicted values found from of the measurements largely agreed with each other. However, in order to predict the effects, it is indispensable that we establish a method of estimating before and after vibration control with the area, thickness, and conditions for fixation of major vibration surfaces of steel bridges. Thus, aiming to predict vibration reduction effects on major vibration surfaces of steel bridges, we conducted a new study on the method of estimating based on conditions such as area and thickness of the vibration surfaces.

This superiority was maintained even if the images were severely degraded by random noise, to simulate radiographs obtained by efficient imaging systems requiring 40 times less radiation exposure than currently used.
