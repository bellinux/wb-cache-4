40|$|Abstract. To control <b>some</b> <b>phone</b> {{services}} at the subscriber end, especially the money consumer ones, is a permanent challenge. The principles described in the article offer some solutions to deny or to selective lock <b>some</b> types of <b>phone</b> <b>calls.</b> The basic idea is to {{count the number of}} dialed digits or to detect first (or second) dialed digit. Digital frequency and period filters are use for that. In this manner the <b>phone</b> <b>call</b> could be stopped if the call number contains a greater number of digits than settled up or if the number contains a certain prefix. Both, pulse and tone dialing technologies were taken into consideration. The solutions could be implemented as microcontroller based systems too...|$|R

We didn't have a good team last year, and so it really doesn't make any sense to re-sign with the Pirates until September, if we are to do that."

His decision {{to stay in the}} match was attributed by <b>some</b> to another <b>phone</b> <b>call</b> from Kissinger and a deluge of cablegrams to Fischer. Spassky, owing to his sporting spirit and respect and sympathy for Fischer, agreed to play the third game in a small room backstage, {{out of sight of the}} spectators.

The RZA explained that he was actually looking to work with a rock band and after <b>some</b> <b>phone</b> <b>calls,</b> Dog Eat Dog met up with the RZA in a New York City studio. After a few short hours of jamming together, [...] "Step Right In" [...] was recorded. The band recorded {{the first half of the}} record with the Butcher Bros., Phil and Joe Nicolo, who had previously produced multi-platinum acts such as Cypress Hill, The Fugees and Urge Overkill. Working with well-known producers opened up Dog Eat Dog to new ideas in the studio and they experimented with full horn sections and additional musicians to fill out their overall sound. The second half of the album was completed with producer Bob Musso, best known for his previous work with bands such as Murphy's Law and Praxis.|$|E
5000|$|On 19 December 2008 France Telecom {{issued a}} press release stating that the FLAG Telecom, SEA-ME-WE 4, and SEA-ME-WE 3 cables, linking Alexandria, Egypt, Sicily, and Malta, had been cut by either bad weather {{conditions}} or a ship's anchor, resulting in substantial slowdowns in communication traffic, with Egypt experiencing an overall 80% reduction in Internet capacity. France Telecom expects SEA-ME-WE 4 will be repaired first, then SEA-ME-WE 3, then FLAG, and that repairs should be concluded by 31 December. The break disrupted 75% of communication between the Middle East and Asia {{and the rest of}} the world. The breaks caused companies including Vodafone, Verizon Communications, Portugal Telecom, GO (Malta) and France Telecom to experience disruption in their systems and forced them to reroute communications through different means. Others, such as AT&T, also received reports of service disruption. The rerouting of these communications caused large slowdowns in some areas. Interoute director Jonathan Wright stated that [...] "You can reroute the data through other cables, but that increases traffic and can potentially create bottlenecks, so Internet connections may slow down and <b>some</b> <b>phone</b> <b>calls</b> could get disrupted." [...] The GO-1 cable connecting Malta and Sicily was also cut.|$|E
5000|$|X-Force {{met with}} Spike Freeman after their return from {{space and the}} Orphan {{explained}} that U-Go Girl’s final words were that she wanted the team to be called X-Statix. Mr. Freeman argued that the team already had a name. Angered, the Orphan knocked {{over much of the}} merchandise covering Spike’s office, claiming that he didn’t care about making money. Spike ordered him to say [...] "no comment" [...] if asked about what the new team name was. As Spike left his office, he noticed that the Anarchist and Dead Girl were drunk on the couch. Later, the Orphan and Spike Freeman once again got into an argument over the Orphan not wanting to keep quiet about the team’s name. Spike threatened to make <b>some</b> <b>phone</b> <b>calls</b> and ruin his image; Orphan does not care. Later still, after the Orphan made a guest appearance on [...] "Lacuna & the Stars" [...] and announced that U-Go Girl’s last words were X-Statix, Spike Freeman had a [...] "change of heart" [...] and decided that the team name would indeed become X-Statix, due to the media hype surrounding the name since the Orphan’s appearance on television. Angered at Spike’s reason for changing the name, the Orphan exclaimed that all Spike cared about was public opinion. Mr. Freeman quickly responded, saying that he was on the Orphan’s side, which the Orphan demand he prove by playing Russian roulette. Spike fearlessly did so and tossed the gun back {{into the hands of the}} Orphan. Shocked at Spike’s fearlessness at the possibility of killing himself, the Orphan agreed to get his act together and appear with Doop at the opening of Doop Kiddies Hospital.|$|E

Did we sometimes protest too much? Maybe, but we were up against a lot; we were underfinanced and still underappreciated in some corners of the music business, so we had to fight scrappily and mean when it was called for.

40|$|Background - Iran {{is one of}} the {{countries}} located on “the thalassemia belt” with a significant annual number of thalassemia new births. Given the importance of thalassemia prevention, a program to this effect was approved in Iran in 1995. Screening of carrier couples and prenatal diagnosis were the two main elements of this program. In the present study, the authors have tried to address the impacts of prevention efforts in Iran (1989 - 2009) and also the status of new birth cases of thalassemia during the time period ranging from 1989 when the Iranian Thalassemia Society was established to 1995 when the prevention program started to run. Materials and Method - The data were obtained from the countrywide haemovigilance network. The data were then compared against the available information in the thalassemia treatment network of Iran and some other thalassemia associations. The available information had been collected through questionnaires and in <b>some</b> cases by <b>phone</b> <b>calls</b> and emails.

40|$|Objective: This study {{examines}} the effectiveness {{and costs of}} follow-up <b>phone</b> <b>calls</b> in improving response rates to a community survey. Methods: Non-responders to a postal survey were randomly allocated to receive a <b>phone</b> <b>call</b> or no <b>phone</b> <b>call.</b> The resources used for {{the development and implementation}} of the survey were documented. The response rates and cost per level of follow-up contact examined. Results: Follow-up <b>phone</b> <b>calls</b> led to a statistical significant increase in the number of responses to a community-wide survey, relative to no <b>phone</b> <b>call.</b> This relative increase in responses (n= 62 for the follow-up <b>phone</b> <b>call</b> group versus n= 1 for controls), did not increase the absolute survey response rate sufficiently (from 38. 5 % for two mailed surveys to 39. 8 % for two mailed surveys plus a <b>phone</b> <b>call)</b> to justify the <b>phone</b> <b>call</b> costs. Scenario analyses show increasing the initial response rate by 10 % and conducting a second mailed survey achieves greater marginal cost savings than increasing the response rate to the second mailout or the follow-up <b>phone</b> <b>calls.</b> Conclusions: These results suggest a follow-up <b>phone</b> <b>call</b> was not cost effective.
