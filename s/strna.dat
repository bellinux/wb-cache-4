50|$|Small {{temporal}} RNA (abbreviated <b>stRNA)</b> regulates {{gene expression}} during roundworm development by preventing the mRNAs they bind from being translated. In contrast to siRNA, stRNAs downregulate expression of target RNAs after translation initiation without affecting mRNA stability. Nowadays, stRNAs are {{better known as}} miRNAs.|$|E
40|$|The 21 -nucleotide small {{temporal}} RNA (<b>stRNA)</b> let- 7 regulates developmental timing in Caenorhabditis elegans {{and probably}} in other bilateral animals. We present in vivo and in vitro evidence that in Drosophila melanogaster a developmentally regulated precursor RNA is cleaved by an RNA interference-like mechanism to produce mature let- 7 <b>stRNA.</b> Targeted destruction in cultured human {{cells of the}} messenger RNA encoding the enzyme Dicer, which acts in the RNA interference pathway, leads to accumulation of the let- 7 precursor. Thus, the RNA interference and <b>stRNA</b> pathways intersect. Both pathways require the RNA-processing enzyme Dicer to produce the active small-RNA component that represses gene expression...|$|E
40|$|A {{complete}} cDNA {{copy of the}} viroid-like satellite RNA of the Canadian {{strain of}} lucerne transient streak virus (LTSV) has been cloned and the nucleotide sequence of the RNA has been determined using this and other clones. The sequence comprises 322 residues and shares 80 ~ homology with satellite RNAs (stRNAs) of the Australasian isolates of LTSV. A proposed secondary structure for the RNA is highly base-paired and thermodynamically stable, and consists of a rod-like structure interspersed with single-stranded loops, an arrangement similar to that proposed for circular <b>stRNA</b> of other strains of LTSV and other sobemoviruses {{as well as for}} viroids. Whereas certain regions of the sequence are very similar or identical to those of <b>stRNA</b> from Australasian LTSV, including the putative self-cleavage sites on both the positive and negative sense forms of the RNA, other regions of the sequence are quite dissimilar between the Canadian and Australasian strains...|$|E

40|$|Two small {{temporally}} regulated RNAs (<b>stRNAs)</b> * of ∼ 22 nucleotides regulate {{timing of}} gene expression during {{development of the}} nematode C. elegans. This regulation occurs at a posttranscriptional, presumably translational, level and is distinct from RNA interference (RNAi). One of the two <b>stRNAs,</b> let- 7, {{as well as its}} target gene, lin- 41, are highly conserved even in humans, suggesting a wide employment of stRNA-mediated gene regulation. Recent reports indicate that these two <b>stRNAs</b> are indeed likely to represent only the tip of an iceberg with hundreds or more of additional micro-RNAs (miRNAs) existing in metazoans. miRNAs might thus be previously underestimated key participants in the field of gene regulation...|$|R
40|$|AbstractRNAi is a gene-silencing {{phenomenon}} {{triggered by}} double-stranded (ds) RNA and involves {{the generation of}} 21 to 26 nt RNA segments that guide mRNA destruction. In Caenorhabditis elegans, lin- 4 and let- 7 encode small temporal RNAs (<b>stRNAs)</b> of 22 nt that regulate stage-specific development. Here we show that inactivation of genes related to RNAi pathway genes, a homolog of Drosophila Dicer (dcr- 1), and two homologs of rde- 1 (alg- 1 and alg- 2), cause heterochronic phenotypes similar to lin- 4 and let- 7 mutations. Further we show that dcr- 1, alg- 1, and alg- 2 are necessary for the maturation and activity of the lin- 4 and let- 7 <b>stRNAs.</b> Our findings suggest that a common processing machinery generates guide RNAs that mediate both RNAi and endogenous gene regulation...|$|R
40|$|AbstractMicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a {{new class}} of noncoding RNAs, which are encoded as short {{inverted}} repeats in the genomes of invertebrates and vertebrates [1, 2]. It is believed that miRNAs are modulators of target mRNA translation and stability, although most target mRNAs remain to be identified. Here we describe the identification of 34 novel miRNAs by tissue-specific cloning of approximately 21 -nucleotide RNAs from mouse. Almost all identified miRNAs are conserved in the human genome and are also frequently found in nonmammalian vertebrate genomes, such as pufferfish. In heart, liver, or brain, it is found that a single, tissue-specifically expressed miRNA dominates the population of expressed miRNAs and suggests a role for these miRNAs in tissue specification or cell lineage decisions. Finally, a miRNA was identified that appears to be the fruitfly and mammalian ortholog of C. elegans lin- 4 <b>stRNA...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{antibiotic}} blasticidin S (BlaS) is {{a potent}} inhibitor of protein synthesis in bacteria and eukaryotes. We have determined a 3. 4 -A crystal structure of BlaS bound to a 70 <b>StRNA</b> ribosome complex and performed biochemical and single-molecule FRET experiments to determine the mechanism of action of the antibiotic. We find that BlaS enhances tRNA binding to the P site of the large ribosomal subunit and slows down spontaneous intersubunit rotation in pretranslocation ribosomes. However, the antibiotic has negligible effect on elongation factor G catalyzed translocation of tRNA and mRNA. The crystal structure of the antibiotic-ribosome complex reveals that BlaS impedes protein synthesis through a unique mechanism by bending the 32 ̆ 7 terminus of the P-site tRNA toward the A site of the large ribosomal subunit. Biochemical experiments demonstrate that stabilization of the deformed conformation of the P-site tRNA by BlaS strongly inhibits peptidyl-tRNA hydrolysis by release factors and, to a lesser extent, peptide bond formation...|$|E
40|$|Posttranscriptional {{silencing}} (PTGS) in plants, nematodes, Drosophila, {{and perhaps}} all eukaryotes operates by sequence-specific degradation or translational inhibition {{of the target}} mRNA. These processes are mediated by duplexed RNA. In Drosophila and nematodes, double-stranded (ds) RNA or self-complementary RNA is processed into fragments of approximately 21 nt by Dicer- 1 [1, 2]. These small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) serve as guides to target degradation of homologous single-stranded (ss) RNA [1, 3]. In some cases, the approximately 21 nt guide fragments derived from endogenous, imperfectly self-complementary RNAs cause translational inhibition of their target mRNAs, with which they have substantial, but not perfect sequence complementarity [4 - 6]. These small temporal RNAs (stRNAs) belong to a class of noncoding microRNAs (miRNAs), 20 - 24 nt in length, that are found in flies, plants, nematodes, and mammals [4, 6 - 12]. In nematodes, the Dicer- 1 enzyme catalyzes the production of both siRNA and <b>stRNA</b> [2, 13 - 15]. Mutation of the Arabidopsis Dicer- 1 homolog, CARPEL FACTORY (CAF), blocks miRNA production [1, 4, 16 - 18]. Here, we report that the same caf mutant does not block either PTGS or siRNA production induced by self-complementary hairpin RNA. This suggests either that this mutation only impairs miRNA formation or, more interestingly, that plants have two distinct dicer-like enzymes, one for miRNA and another for siRNAi production...|$|E
40|$|Two small {{temporal}} RNAs (<b>stRNAs),</b> lin- 4 and let- 7, control developmental timing in Caenorhabditis elegans. We {{find that}} these two regulatory RNAs {{are members of a}} large class of 21 – 24 -nucleotide non-coding RNAs, called microRNAs (miRNAs). We report on 55 novel miRNAs in C. elegans. The miRNAs have diverse expression patterns during development: a let- 7 paralog is temporally co-expressed with let- 7; miRNAs encoded in a single genomic cluster are co-expressed during embryogenesis; still other miRNAs are expressed constitutively throughout development. Potential orthologs of several novel miRNA genes were identified in Drosophila and human genomes. The abundance of these tiny RNAs, their expression patterns, and their evolutionary conservation imply that, as a class, miRNAs have broad regulatory functions in animals. Two types of short RNAs, both about 21 – 25 nt in length, serve as guide RNAs to direct posttranscriptional regulatory machinery to specific mRNA targets. Small temporal RNAs (<b>stRNAs)</b> control developmental timing in Caenorhabditis elegans (1 - 3). They pair to sites within the 3 ´-untranslated region (3 ´ UTR) of target mRNAs, causin...|$|R
40|$|RNA {{molecules}} are {{a constant}} source of joy to molecular biologists: They come in all shapes and sizes, and perform diverse informational, structural, and catalytic tricks in living cells. Perhaps less appreciated is their facility for regulating gene expression. Small regulatory RNAs figure prominently in two fascinating phenomena: gene inactivation by RNA interference (RNAi), and the control of gene expression during development. RNAi is implemented by short interfering RNAs (siRNAs), whereas developmental control depends on small temporal RNAs (<b>stRNAs).</b> Parallel research efforts hav...|$|R
40|$|During RNA {{interference}} (RNAi), long dsRNA {{is processed}} to approximately 21 nt duplexes, short interfering RNAs (siRNAs), which silence genes through a mRNA degradation pathway. Small temporal RNAs (<b>stRNAs)</b> and micro-RNAs (miRNAs) are approximately 21 nt RNAs that are processed from endogenously encoded hairpin-structured precursors, and function to silence genes via translational repression. Here {{we report that}} synthetic hairpin RNAs that mimic siRNAs and miRNA precursor molecules can target a gene for silencing, and the mechanism of silencing appears to be through mRNA degradation and not translational repression. The sequence and structural configuration of these RNAs are important, and even slight modification in structure can affect the silencing activity of the hairpins. Furthermore, these RNAs are active when expressed by DNA vectors containing polymerase III promoters, opening the possibility for new approaches in stable RNAi-based loss of function studies...|$|R
40|$|In Caenorhabditis elegans, lin- 4 and let- 7 encode 22 - and 21 -nucleotide (nt) RNAs, respectively, which {{function}} as key regulators of developmental timing. Because {{the appearance of}} these short RNAs is regulated during development, they are {{also referred to as}} small temporal RNAs (stRNAs). We show that many 21 - and 22 -nt expressed RNAs, termed microRNAs, exist in invertebrates and vertebrates and that some of these novel RNAs, similar to let- 7 <b>stRNA,</b> are highly conserved. This suggests that sequence-speciÞc, posttranscriptional reg-ulatory mechanisms mediated by small RNAs are more general than previously appreciated. Two distinct pathways exist in animals and plants in which 21 - to 23 -nt RNAs {{function as}} posttranscriptional regulators of gene ex-pression. Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) act as mediators of sequence-specific mRNA degradation in RNA interference (RNAi) (1 – 5), whereas stRNAs regulate developmen-tal timing by mediating sequence-specific repression of mRNA translation (6 – 11). siRNAs and stRNAs are excised from dou-ble-stranded RNA (dsRNA) precursors by Dicer (12 – 14), a multidomain ribonuclease III protein, thus producing RNA species of similar sizes. However, siRNAs are be-lieved to be double-stranded (2, 5, 12), whereas stRNAs are single-stranded (8). We previously developed a directional cloning procedure to isolate siRNAs after processing of long dsRNAs in Drosophila melanogaster embryo lysate (2). Briefly, 59 and 39 adapter molecules were ligated to the ends of a size-fractionated RNA population, followed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification, con-catamerization, cloning, and sequencing. This method, originally intended to isolate siRNAs, led to the simultaneous identifica-tion of 16 novel 20 - to 23 -nt short RNAs, which are encoded in the D. melanogaster genome and are expressed in 0 - to 2 -hour embryos (Table 1). The method was adapted to clone RNAs in a similar size range from HeLa cell total RNA (15), which led to th...|$|E
40|$|The bull shark, Carcharhinus leucas, is an {{important}} euryhaline predator that is exploited throughout its range for meat and fins. This species is taxonomically paired with the pigeye shark, C. amboinensis. Validity of this group has not been directly tested using molecular markers. Genetic variation and phylogeny was examined with concatenated datasets of mitochondrial genes (cytb, cox 1 and 12 <b>stRNA</b> 16 s) for nineteen species, from three families within the order Carcharhiniformes. Whilst there were indications of species pairings within the genus, {{there was no evidence}} to suggest that the bull and pigeye sharks should be considered a species group. Phylogenetic analysis failed to resolve Carcharhinus, but confirmed Negaprion as a sister taxon and placed Prionace glauca within Carcharhinus. It remains unclear if the family Sphyrnidae, arose from a Rhizoprionodon or Scoliodon ancestor and future revision of this complex group of sharks is required. Like other large carcharhinid species, C. leucas exhibits a low reproductive rate and long generation times. It is susceptible to localised depletions and such declines have been documented. The global stock structure was assessed by analysing the mitochondrial control region in 245 individuals sampled from eight populations in three ocean basins. The bull shark exhibits relatively high haplotype diversity (0. 896 ± 0. 010) when compared to other globally-distributed sharks and the nucleotide diversity was similar to others from the genus (0. 00465 ± 0. 00014). There was significant stock structure found among populations (ΦST= 0. 736, p< 0. 00001) and among ocean basins (ΦCT= 0. 527, p= 0. 00653). Geneflow between the US Atlantic coastline and Gulf of Mexico was sufficient to consider the area to be a single panmictic population. Coalescent analyses suggest an Indian Ocean origin with population divergences associated with warm interglacials and increased habitat with drop in sea level during the recent Wisconsin glaciation. Seven discrete stock management units for bull sharks are proposed. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|RNA {{interference}} (RNAi) {{was first}} recognized in Caenorhabditis elegans as a biological response to exogenous double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), which induces sequence-specific gene silencing. RNAi represents a conserved regulatory motif, which {{is present in}} a wide range of eukaryotic organisms. Recently, we and others have shown that endogenously encoded triggers of gene silencing act through elements of the RNAi machinery to regulate the expression of protein-coding genes. These small temporal RNAs (<b>stRNAs)</b> are transcribed as short hairpin precursors (∼ 70 nt), processed into active, 21 -nt RNAs by Dicer, and recognize target mRNAs via base-pairing interactions. Here, we show that short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) can be engineered to suppress the expression of desired genes in cultured Drosophila and mammalian cells. shRNAs can be synthesized exogenously or can be transcribed from RNA polymerase III promoters in vivo, thus permitting the construction of continuous cell lines or transgenic animals in which RNAi enforces stable and heritable gene silencing...|$|R
