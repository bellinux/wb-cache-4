40|$|Computing {{the long}} term {{behavior}} of regulatory and signaling networks is critical in understanding how biological functions take place in organisms. <b>Steady</b> <b>states</b> of these networks determine the activity levels of individual entities in the long run. Identifying all the <b>steady</b> <b>states</b> of these networks is difficult as it suffers from the state space explosion problem. In this paper, we propose a method for identifying all the <b>steady</b> <b>states</b> of boolean regulatory and signaling networks accurately and efficiently. We build a mathematical model that allows pruning {{a large portion of}} the state space quickly without causing any false dismissals. For the remaining state space, which is typically very small compared to the whole state space, we develop a randomized traversal method that extracts the <b>steady</b> <b>states.</b> We estimate the number of <b>steady</b> <b>states,</b> and the expected behavior of individual genes and gene pairs in <b>steady</b> <b>states</b> in an online fashion.
