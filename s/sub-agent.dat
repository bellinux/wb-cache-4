5|$|Although many {{messages}} were sent by agents, the Twenty Committee considered that Ironside was quite unrealistic {{and as a}} result was cautious about promoting it too heavily. Most of the information was sent with words of caution or uncertainty to ensure that the agent would not be compromised. One of the most critical Bodyguard agents, Garbo, did become involved on 5 June, but only in forwarding the message of a fictional <b>sub-agent</b> who he had already identified as unreliable (MI5 hoped that this would cover for, in their opinion, the implausible nature of the story). The agent's report explained that a US division based in Liverpool was preparing to head to Bordeaux.|$|E
5|$|The elder Hindman {{frequently}} made {{business trips}} to Alabama and even moved {{the family to}} Jacksonville after buying several lots of land there. He {{took advantage of the}} many local business opportunities and was able to provide his family with whatever they needed. He also gained a reputation for honesty with his business associates, which included Cherokee Indian tribes in the area. Hindman became trusted by the Cherokee Nation and was appointed as the <b>sub-agent</b> to the Cherokees by President James Monroe. After Andrew Jackson became President, Hindman, Sr. was appointed to the post of United States Agent for the Cherokee Nation. The elder Hindman frequently traveled to Washington D.C. to discuss the interests of the Cherokee Nation, and in 1841 was assigned by Acting Secretary of War Albert M. Lea to determine why the Cherokees in North Carolina had rejected the government's suggestion to join other parts of the tribe in Indian Territory. Hindman spent almost two months unsuccessfully trying to persuade the North Carolina Cherokees to rejoin the rest of their nation further West.|$|E

The original separate agents, while now purchased, licensed and installed together, still retain separate features and separate image names.

500|$|After graduation, Davies {{returned}} {{to work in the}} mines, initially at Tumble in the Gwendraeth Valley. In December 1913 he unsuccessfully sought election as miners' <b>sub-agent</b> for the Anthracite Miners' district of the SWMF. When the First World War began in August 1914 he opposed it as capitalist militarism: [...] "History teaches that war invariably brings in its wake a lower standard of morality, a restriction of the liberty of the masses, and a degradation of their social conditions". In 1917 Davies founded and was first chairman of the Burry Port and Gwendraeth Valley Trades and Labour Council. He was initially selected as the Labour candidate for the Llanelli constituency in the 1918 general election, but stood down when the SWMF backed his rival, J. H. Williams.|$|E
500|$|Even {{with the}} {{treaties}} of 1837 and 1842, leaders worried about Ojibwa removal. Buffalo kept in constant {{contact with the}} other bands to ensure the Ojibwa upheld their obligations. He sent runners to all the bands to report back on any conduct by the Ojibwa that could construed as grounds for removal. Nothing was reported. But, President Zachary Taylor signed the removal order on February 6, 1850, under corrupt circumstances, claiming to be protecting the Ojibwa from [...] "injurious" [...] whites. [...] The Wisconsin legislature resisted the order and put aside plans for removal. Alexander Ramsey, the territorial governor of Minnesota, and Indian <b>sub-agent</b> John Watrous conspired {{on a plan to}} force the Ojibwa to Minnesota anyway, as the two men stood to gain personal economic and political benefits from removal.|$|E
500|$|Mohun left America for Genoa, Italy with Louis {{and their}} sister, Laura.

Mohun then journeyed to the Congo with Louis, who was to act as his <b>sub-agent.</b> [...] The US commercial post in the Free State was then at Boma near the Atlantic coast, but Mohun also operated from Léopoldville, further inland. [...] In July 1892 he assisted US citizen Warren C. Unckless in establishing a rubber factory on the Sankuru River near Lusambo for the Société anonyme belge pour le commerce du Haut-Congo. [...] Unckless, a plantation manager in Costa Rica, had imported experienced rubber cutters from South America to begin the enterprise but came under attack from tribesmen and a Belgian force had to be dispatched to provide security. [...] Mohun spent much of his time in exploration of the country's interior, visiting several areas where no white man had ever ventured and making a survey {{of the quality of the}} agricultural land and the crops grown by the native population.|$|E

40|$|A new {{operational}} semantics for "pure" CCS is proposed that considers the parallel operator {{as a first}} class one, and permits {{a description of the}} calculus in terms of partial orderings. The new semantics (also for unguarded agents) is given in the SOS style via the partial ordering derivation relation. CCS agents are decomposed into sets of sequential <b>sub-agents,</b> and the new derivations which relate sets of <b>sub-agents</b> describe their actions and their causal dependencies. The computations obtained by animating sets of <b>sub-agents</b> via the partial ordering derivation relation are "observed" either as interleaving or partial orderings of events. Interleavings coincide with Milner 2 ̆ 7 s many step derivations, and "linearizations" of partial orderings are all and only interleavings. In order to obtain more abstract semantics, we introduce two relations of partial ordering observational equivalence and congruence that preserve concurrency. These are finer than Milner 2 ̆ 7 s exactly in that they distinguish interleaving of sequential nondeterministic agents from their concurrent execution...|$|R

2500|$|Comcast Business {{services}} {{used to be}} sold exclusively {{through direct}} sales employees. In March 2011, Comcast created an indirect sales channel called the Solution Provider Program, a comprehensive indirect channel program that enables telecommunications consultants and system integrators to sell Comcast's services such as Business Class Internet, Voice, and high-capacity Ethernet services to small and mid-market businesses. The program offers recurring commissions for sales partners based on monthly revenue, and Comcast will provide, install, manage and bill for these services. For the initial launch of the Solutions Provider Program, Comcast enlisted three national master representatives—Telarus, based in Salt Lake City, Utah; Intelisys, based in Petaluma, California; and Telecom Brokerage Inc (TBI), based in Chicago. <b>Sub-agent</b> sales partners must work {{with one of these}} three partners {{in the early stages of}} the program.

It is said that Major Gillespie brought on the attack with a cane. A severe conflict ensued, during which two pistols were fired by Gillespie and one by Loose.

50|$|In the Philippines, a <b>Sub-Agent</b> {{is someone}} who is under the {{supervision}} and operational control of a Real Estate Broker. The <b>Sub-Agent</b> is not {{an agent of the}} Buyer or Seller. It is the Broker who is the Agent of the Buyer or Seller.

The formal position of a <b>Sub-Agent</b> in the hierarchy of real estate practitioners in the Philippines is equivalent to the rank of Salesperson.
