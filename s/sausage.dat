These defined autochthonous functional starter cultures (combination of Lactobacillus and Staphylococcus strains) were used to produce five different industrial <b>sausages</b> which were compared by a panel. The viability of introduced autochthonous Lactobacillus and Staphylococcus strains and their effect on the final product characteristics: microbiology, physical-chemical and sensory properties, were monitored. The obtained results indicated that autochthonous starter cultures survived industrial production of <b>sausages</b> and can be used for industrial production of <b>sausages</b> under controlled conditions. Autochthonous starter cultures obtained better results in organoleptic properties, microbial safety and prolonged shelf life in comparison with commercial starter cultures...|$|R

5|$|Glamorgan <b>sausage</b> (Welsh: Selsig Morgannwg) is a {{traditional}} Welsh vegetarian <b>sausage</b> for which the main ingredients are cheese (usually Caerphilly), leeks and breadcrumbs. The earliest published mention of the dish is from the 1850s in the book Wild Wales by George Borrow, although earlier records in the Glamorgan Archives show a version which contains pork. The modern vegetarian version became popular during the Second World War when meat was harder to come by, and is now mass-produced by at least two companies. Variations include swapping the leeks for onions, as well as different herbs and spices, and various types of cheese.|$|E

30|$|Duck {{farming is}} on the raise in the current scenario, but {{processed}} products from duck meat are still uncommon to find. Investigating the duck meat qualities during storage will provide information to enhance duck meat utilization. Development of ready-to-eat and ready-to-cook duck meat products {{is expected to increase}} and improve non-chicken meat-based protein. The Study was aimed to evaluate the changes in quality characteristics of duck meat <b>sausages</b> preserved by refrigeration (7  ±  1  °C). Duck meat <b>sausages</b> were prepared by utilizing raw and partially cooked duck meat with addition of soy flour at 10 % level as a binder. Different quality characteristics like physical and chemical characteristics, proximate composition, and organoleptic characteristics were evaluated. Cooking loss of partially cooked meat <b>sausages</b> was lower than raw duck meat <b>sausages,</b> whereas emulsion stability and 2 -thiobarbituric acid (TBA) values of raw duck meat <b>sausages</b> were lesser than partially cooked meat <b>sausages.</b> Cooking loss and emulsion stability decreased in both types of meat <b>sausages,</b> while, 2 -TBA values increased as refrigerated storage progressed for 14  days. Percent moisture content of raw duck meat <b>sausages</b> was higher than partially cooked meat <b>sausages,</b> which decreased in both types of meat <b>sausages</b> as refrigerated storage progressed for 14  days. Percent crude protein (CP) and percent ether extract (EE) content of partially cooked duck meat <b>sausages</b> were higher than raw duck meat <b>sausages.</b> Regardless of type of meat used, refrigerated storage of <b>sausages</b> increased CP and EE up to 10 th day but decreased upon further storage up to 14 th day. Organoleptic scores for raw duck meat <b>sausages</b> were higher than partially cooked duck meat <b>sausages</b> and all the scores decreased with an increase in the storage period. However the scores were within the acceptable limits. The findings prove that, duck meat can be effectively acclaimed as an alternative avenue to meet the escalating protein demand in the form of ready-to-eat product. The quality of <b>sausages</b> is also retained during refrigerated storage.|$|R
5|$|In modern versions, Caerphilly {{cheese is}} used, {{which is a}} {{descendant}} of the old traditional Glamorgan cheese recipe and lends the same general texture and flavour. The basic recipe calls for a mixture of cheese, leeks and breadcrumbs, although some recipes swap the leeks for onions or spring onions and may add herbs such as parsley or further flavourings such as mustard. The mixture is then rolled into <b>sausage</b> shapes, and then fried. There is no <b>sausage</b> casing used, although egg is used to bind the mixture {{so that it does}} not fall apart during the cooking process.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Semi-dry, {{fermented}} <b>sausages</b> were made, incorporating mechanically deboned {{turkey meat}} (MDTM) and hand deboned turkey meat in ratios of 0 : 100, 20 : 80, 35 : 65, and 50 : 50, and polyphosphate salt levels of 0 % and 0. 5 %. These <b>sausages</b> were evaluated for objective and subjective characteristics: proximate composition and pH (raw and cooked), total acidity, yields, shear and tear strengths, and sensory acceptability. Addition of phosphates {{had no effect}} on the proximate composition or yields of <b>sausages.</b> This was contrary to literature reports, but was probably due to the long processing time of the <b>sausages.</b> Phosphate salts raised the pH of <b>sausages,</b> as expected. The shear and tear values of the <b>sausages</b> were significantly increased by addition of phosphates and significantly decreased by increasing levels of MDTM. No significant interactions were found. Sensory evaluations tended to indicate that, when thinly sliced, <b>sausages</b> were considered primarily for flavor rather than for texture or appearance. The <b>sausages</b> made in this study were all considered acceptable, to a degree dependent on the individual's preference for the spicy flavor. Alkaline phosphate salts have potential use in stabilizing MDTM for use in semi-dry, fermented poultry <b>sausages...</b>|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to find out quality of beef <b>sausages</b> fortified with cod and corn oil and processed with different cooking methods. The <b>sausages</b> were made of beef, cod oil, corn oil, tapioca flour, skimmed milk, salt, pepper, garlic, angkak, and ice, with the ratio of cod oil and corn oil of 2. 9 : 7. 1; 2. 4 : 7. 6; and 1. 9 : 8. 1. All <b>sausages</b> ingredients were mixed and then filled in the casing. The raw <b>sausages</b> were cooked using steaming and vacuum steaming for 30 minutes. The <b>sausages</b> were then analyzed for chemical composition (moisture, protein, and fat contents), physical quality (pH, water holding capacity, and tenderness), and fatty acids profile (omega 3 and omega 6 ratio). The data of chemical composition and physical quality were analyzed statistically using analysis of variance (factorial pattern = 3 factors of oil ratio x 2 factors of cooking method) and the differences between means were tested by Duncan’s new Multiple Ranges Test. The data of fatty acids profile were analyzed descriptively. The results showed that the different ratio of cod and corn oils affected the moisture content, protein content, pH, and water holding capacity of <b>sausages</b> (P< 0. 05). Vacuum steaming increased significantly the moisture content, protein content, fat content, pH, and water holding capacity of <b>sausages</b> (P< 0. 05). The <b>sausages</b> cooked with vacuum steaming contained higher omega 3 and omega 6 than that of steaming <b>sausages.</b> There were interactions between oil ratio and cooking methods on the moisture content, protein content, pH, and tenderness of <b>sausages</b> (P< 0. 05). In conclusion, fortification of <b>sausages</b> with cod and corn oil at 2. 4 : 7. 6 ratio and cooked with vacuum steaming resulting the best quality of <b>sausages.</b> (Key words: Chemical composition, Cod oil, Corn oil, Physical quality, <b>Sausages,</b> Vacuum steaming...|$|R

5|$|On {{the coast}} the 52nd (Lowland) Division was fought a fierce action after {{crossing}} the Wadi el Hesi {{on the coast}} north of Gaza. By the morning of 8 November, two infantry brigades had crossed the Wadi el Hesi near its mouth and, despite some opposition established themselves on the sand dunes to the north towards Askelon. <b>Sausage</b> Ridge, on their right stretched from Burberah to Deir Sineid, was held in considerable strength, as the ridge covered the road and railway from Gaza to the north. During the afternoon the 155th Brigade moved to attack <b>Sausage</b> Ridge, but it was threatened by a counterattack on the left forcing, the brigade to halt and face north to meet this attack. When the 156th Brigade arrived from Sh. Ajlin on the Wadi el Hesi, the 157th Brigade attacked the southern portion of the ridge, and gained a footing as darkness fell. They lost this precarious position four times to fierce Ottoman counterattacks, before strongly attacking and throwing the defenders off the ridge by 21:00.
