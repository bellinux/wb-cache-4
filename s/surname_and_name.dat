RESULTS While evaluating the results of the measured group during the three-month interventional training, fitness of the individual measured groups showed recorded increases as well as decreases. Decreasing average cardiac rate, consequently increasing body fitness, was recorded for men.

40|$|There are 536, 454 author-article {{combinations}} {{included in}} our database, of which 31 % lack affiliations We recover affiliation information {{for many of these}} authors by applying the procedures developed by Tang and Walsh (2010), as implemented in Agrawal et al. (2013). For each record without author’s affiliation we check whether there is another record with the same author name (full <b>surname</b> <b>and</b> <b>name</b> or full surname and initials) with an affiliation. We assign this latter affiliation to the missing record as long as both articles cite, at least, two articles that are not highly cited. The low citation benchmark is set at less than 50 citations. This increases the author-article combinations with affiliation information for some authors from 69 % to 80 %. Of those, 84 % have affiliations for all authors. We impute affiliation information for years in which an author does not publish by using his or her affiliation before or after those years. Our algorithm uses, iteratively, the closest information relative to the information gap. For example, suppose that author A published an article in 1990 when she was affiliated to MIT, and then published her next article in 1994 when she was affiliated to Princeton.

Theme: Utilization ofthe continuous power measurement {{on the road}} bicycle for triathlets training management. Thesis' objective: Objective of the thesis is to compare an accomplishment rate of the training task measuring physicalload by power or heart rate. Method: Thesis is focussing on a contribution of the measuring of physical load by power in comparison to heart rate. Research is based on recording values ofthe power and heart rate during the test rides controlled by both methods. On the basis of obtained data we evaluate which method ofthe load management leads to better accomplishment ofthe test rides task. Measurement itself was made by POWER TAP PRO SL equipment installed on the bicycle ofthe tested person. Test were done in various terrain conditions to reach a data corresponding with real training process. Results: Utilization ofthe continuous power measurement on the road bicycle in triathlets training management, based on results of this thesis, can be evaluated as useful.

Objectives: Design of the methodics {{for creating}} model cycling rides in the training of the cycling part of the triathlon for an intermittent method with short distances using the power meter. Method: The pilot study focuses on the methodics for creating model cycling rides in the cycling part of the triathlon and their evaluation.
