30|$|On {{the other}} hand, memristor is a circuit element which was {{proposed}} by Chua (1971) {{and has been}} realized the prototype by Hewlett-Packard laboratory in Strukov et al. (2008) and Tour and He (2008). Different from classical resistors, memristor is a nonlinear resistor which owns non-uniqueness values. In addition, the memristor can manage and store a great quantity of information. For its excellent properties about memory, we can build a new model if the conventional resistors are replaced by the memristors in neural networks, which is called memristive neural networks. <b>Some</b> <b>representative</b> <b>works</b> studied on {{the properties of the}} memristive systems display its applicability in several interdisciplinary areas (see Bao and Zeng 2013; Guo et al. 2015; Wang et al. 2003; Wu et al. 2012; Wu and Zeng 2012; Wen and Zeng 2012; Zhao et al. 2015). From the description of memristive neural networks, combining memristors with infinite memory is extremely interesting. An advantage of fractional-order systems in comparison to integer-order systems is that fractional-order systems can generate infinite memory. Therefore, merging the memristors into a class of fractional-order neural networks is pretty anticipated. Although stability analysis of fractional-order memristive or memristor-based neural networks has been gradually carried out (see Chen et al. 2014, 2015; Rakkiyappan et al. 2014, 2015 b; Velmurugan and Rakkiyappan 2016; Velmurugan et al. 2016), {{it is worth noting that}} fractional-order memristive neural networks can exhibit complicated dynamics or chaotic behaviors if the network’s parameters and time delays are appropriately specified.|$|R
40|$|Intelligent {{recommendation}} {{technology has}} been playing an increasingly important role in various industry applications such as e-commerce product promotion and Internet advertisement display. Besides users' feedbacks (e. g., numerical ratings) on items as usually exploited by some typical recommendation algorithms, there are often some additional data such as users' social circles and other behaviors. Such auxiliary data are usually related to users' preferences on items behind the numerical ratings. Collaborative recommendation with auxiliary data (CRAD) aims to leverage such additional information so as to improve the personalization services, which have received much attention from both researchers and practitioners. Transfer learning (TL) is proposed to extract and transfer knowledge from some auxiliary data in order to assist the learning task on some target data. In this paper, we consider the CRAD problem from a transfer learning view, especially on how to achieve knowledge transfer from some auxiliary data. First, we give a formal definition of transfer learning for CRAD (TL-CRAD). Second, we extend the existing categorization of TL techniques (i. e., adaptive, collective and integrative knowledge transfer algorithm styles) with three knowledge transfer strategies (i. e., prediction rule, regularization and constraint). Third, we propose a novel generic knowledge transfer framework for TL-CRAD. Fourth, we describe <b>some</b> <b>representative</b> <b>works</b> of each specific knowledge transfer strategy of each algorithm style in detail, which are expected to inspire further works.

It reviews <b>some</b> <b>representative</b> <b>work</b> in the area, with particular emphasis on the objectives, outputs and conclusions of the studies, and on how researchers propose using the resulting Risk Estimate for decision making. Several problems and sources of confusion concerning MRA are identified, such as terminology, the application of Risk Estimates to establish Food Safety Objectives and microbiological criteria for foods, lack of data, and the difference between Risk Assessment and the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point system (HACCP). In the context of Codex Alimentarius, MRA was developed as a tool for decision making and priority setting by government risk managers. However, elements of Risk Assessment can be used for other purposes. A transparent description of a Risk Assessment study is useful for Risk Communication.

40|$|This thesis {{offers a}} study of a {{particular}} period (1884 - 1899) in Britain in which Fantastic literature revealed itself as a convergence point of multiple anxieties of late nineteenth-century society. Fantastic literature is a genre often mistaken for Gothic, Fantasy or the like, that in fact has its own particular' rhetoric and literary conventions. In this study I present {{some of the most}} important social and literary elements of the context in which Fantastic literature emerged in Britain - the conventions of Gothic literature, a short history of Spiritualism, the scientific organizations devoted to the study of paranormal phenomena, such as the Society for Psychical Research, and a brief summary of the social evolutionist ideas of Thomas Huxley and H. G. Wells. By examining the context and <b>some</b> <b>representative</b> <b>works</b> of Fantastic literature, like R. L. Stevenson's 'Olalla' (1884), Arthur Conan Doyle's 'The Parasite' (1895), Henry James's The Turn of the Screw (1898) and H. G. Wells's When the Sleeper Wakes (1899), we get a better idea of essential characteristics of Fantastic literature, that is, of the elements within these stories that reflect some important issues of late Victorian society. One can see that the rhetoric of the Fantastic sheds light on phenomena linked with uncertainty and fear in late nineteenth-century society, suchÃ‚Â·as occultism, supernatural sightings, haunted houses and spiritualism. During the twentieth and twenty-first centuries Fantastic literature has survived alongside Fantasy literature (J. R. R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings), magical realism (Salman Rushdie's Midnight Children or Garda Marquez's One Hundred Years ofSolitude) and children's literature (J. K. Rawling's Harry Potter) preserving its own identity and rhetoric. Italo Calvina's The Rampant Baron, J. L. Borges's 'The Aleph' and Haruki Murakami's The Wind-up Bird Chronicle indicate that Fantastic literature still has its place in literature because it expresses a particular kind of ideas that cannot find expression in other genres.

It will show that texture is used consistently by Kyr as an expressive device to illuminate the inner meaning of the text.

It is neither text set to music, nor music written to fit within a preexistent text. Instead, all dimensions of the composition are conceived simultaneously.

The non-linearity of the differential equations makes the convergence of the iterative method difficult. The limitations on the storage capacity of the available computing machines makes it impracticable to obtain solutions having any predetermined accuracy. In addition, the imposition of the natural boundary conditions which prescribe the velocities on the boundaries, also contributes to the complexity of the problem. A brief survey of <b>some</b> <b>representative</b> <b>work</b> done on the numerical solution of Navier-Stokes equations has been given here. The Navier-Stokes equations have been reduced to a system of two second order coupled differential equations which are then solved numerically. Some finite difference schemes have recently been suggested which guarantee the convergence of the iterations for solving the two difference equations. However, these schemes require a certain number of parameters which have to be determined by numerical experimentation. Our aim here is to develop a procedure which would be economical and would require a minimum of numerical experimentation. We have succeeded in showing that only one parameter besides the optimum over-relaxation factors is sufficient for convergence. Different criteria for convergence are studied and the one, which appears to be most efficient, has been used to obtain numerical solutions for the steady flow of a viscous fluid in a two-dimensional cavity flow. Another problem for which the numerical solutions have been obtained is the separating flow due to a thin plate of finite length placed at the point of symmetry of an otherwise two-dimensional stagnation point flow. A non-uniform mesh has been used for this problem and the numerical results for different values of Reynolds number have been obtained. These are given in the form of stream lines and equi-vorticity curves. We have also extended the difference schemes to problem of axisymmetric flows although no numerical results have been obtained. The results obtained in this thesis may be considered as quali­tatively satisfactory in the sense that they exhibit the characteristics of the fluid flow. These results can not be considered quantitatively reliable unless some insight is gained about the convergence of the numer­ical solution of the discretized problem to that of the differential equations. This can partly be done by repeating the calculations using smaller mesh sizes. However, this would require a considerable amount of computing time. It would be interesting to investigate the possibilities of improving the results using some higher order stable difference schemes or finer mesh sizes in the boundary layer only without unduly increasing the computing time...|$|R
