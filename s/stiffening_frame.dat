40|$|Inefficient {{integration}} between engineering software tools, particularly Computer Aided Design / Analysis / Manufacturing (CAD / CAE / CAM) systems, {{continues to be}} a significant problem for many engineering sectors. Transfer of model data between tools is often through neutral Boundary Representation (B-Rep) formats such as STEP which transfer model geometry only. B-Rep formats do not preserve modelling information and design intent added by high level tools (such as design-by-feature and parametric information captured by CAD systems), and omit information about significant model features from other engineering contexts (e. g. analysis and manufacturing). Automatic Feature Recognition (AFR) technologies have been suggested as a solution to engineering tool integration issues and while they {{have been shown to be}} successful in integrating CAD / CAM systems, they have limited application to CAE tools.

The key objective of the flight trials was to examine the influences of environmental phenomena and of the engine nacelle structure regarding the interpretation of the nacelle infrared images and of the nacelle surface temperature measurements, both with reference to determining the location of the flow transition front on the nacelles. As regards the application of the infrared thermography, the study has yielded the result that the quality of the infrared images is influenced by heat radiation to space and from Earth, as well as by reflection of sunlight from the airframe. For good quality infrared images, only carbon fiber composites should be used as structural material for the nacelle fan cowls. In addition, the mechanical design of the fan cowls should not contain any <b>stiffening</b> <b>frames</b> in the substructure, but the should be designed as a uniform honeycomb skin structure.

While the shell plating, which is {{in direct contact with}} the ice, can be up to 50 mm thick in older polar icebreakers, the use of high strength steel with yield strength up to [...] in modern icebreakers results in the same structural strength with smaller material thicknesses and lower steel weight.

40|$|To {{gauge the}} {{potential}} of seismic methods for the estimation of gas content in coal, the ultrasonic response of a sample saturated in turn with He, N 2, CH 4, and CO 2 has been investigated. Specifically, traveltimes {{were used to determine}} P-wave velocity {{as a function of the}} difference between confining pressure and pore pressure. After crushing the sample to powder, adsorption isotherms for CO 2 and CH 4 were measured and then used to estimate the bulk densities, P-wave moduli, and impedances during the traveltime measurements. The data suggest a significant difference in density, P-wave modulus, and impedance under CO 2 relative to CH 4 saturation. Though these findings are based on the assumption that adsorption capacity of the sample when confined was similar to that measured after crushing, they are also roughly supported by isostatic strain measurements taken during swelling. Two possible causes of this behavior are, first, the mechanical properties of the adsorbed phase may be more liquid than gaslike.

The preliminary analysis results show a decrease of the relative displacement of the isolated raised floor with respect to the corresponding base frame floor, and an increase of the lateral deformation of the base shear frame floor, when the isolated raised floor mass is increased.

40|$|A new {{computerised}} design {{model for}} the buckling strength assessment of stiffened panels is presented. The overall formulation is very general, and in principle, any type of stiffening arrangements of open or closed profile type, corrugations etc. can be analysed. The model {{is based on an}} orthotropic version of Marguerre’s non-linear plate theory. The stiffened panel is treated as an integrated unit, allowing for internal redistribution of membrane stresses between component plates, while preventing overall buckling and permanent deformations/sets. By using non-linear plate theory, the strength model is more theoretical consistent than existing code formulations, which are mainly based on empirical curve fitting to a limited number of numerical and experimental results. Complicated items such as bi-axial loading combined with in-plane shear loads and non-linear mode interaction problems are dealt with in a sound physical framework, and empirical approximations are reduced to a minimum. The model also provides a set of reduced anisotropic/orthotropic macro material coefficients {{that can be used in}} refined linear global FE analysis of ship hulls to reflect the increased membrane flexibility experienced by compressed stiffened panels. This area of application allows for redistribution of loads between gross elements such as <b>stiffened</b> panels, <b>frames,</b> girders and bulkheads and ensures a more realistic assessment of the nominal stress flow in a ship hull.
