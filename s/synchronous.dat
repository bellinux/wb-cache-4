5|$|Fegelein held various {{ranks in}} both the Allgemeine-SS and Waffen-SS. The {{following}} table shows that progression was not <b>synchronous.</b>|$|E
5|$|A numerically {{controlled}} oscillator (NCO) is a digital signal generator which creates a <b>synchronous</b> (i.e. clocked), discrete-time, discrete-valued {{representation of a}} waveform, usually sinusoidal. NCOs are often {{used in conjunction with}} a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) at the output to create a direct digital synthesizer (DDS).|$|E
5|$|Because {{the orbit}} of Phobos is below <b>synchronous</b> altitude, the tidal forces from the planet Mars are {{gradually}} lowering its orbit. In about 50 million years, it could either crash into Mars's surface or break up into a ring structure around the planet.|$|E
5|$|Graphical user {{interfaces}} (GUIs) may be developed using Perl. For example, Perl/Tk and WxPerl {{are commonly used}} to enable user interaction with Perl scripts. Such interaction may be <b>synchronous</b> or asynchronous, using callbacks to update the GUI.|$|E
5|$|<b>Synchronous</b> {{spawning}} is very typical on {{the coral}} reef, and often, even when multiple species are present, all corals spawn {{on the same}} night. This synchrony is essential so male and female gametes can meet. Corals rely on environmental cues, varying from species to species, to determine the proper time to release gametes into the water. The cues involve temperature change, lunar cycle, day length, and possibly chemical signalling. <b>Synchronous</b> spawning may form hybrids and is perhaps involved in coral speciation. The immediate cue is most often sunset, which cues the release. The spawning event can be visually dramatic, clouding the usually clear water with gametes.|$|E
5|$|Torque {{generated}} by the drive causes the induction motor to run at <b>synchronous</b> speed less the slip. If the load drives the motor faster than <b>synchronous</b> speed, the motor acts as a generator, converting mechanical power back to electrical power. This power is returned to the drive's DC link element (capacitor or reactor). A DC-link-connected electronic power switch or braking DC chopper controls dissipation of this power as heat {{in a set of}} resistors. Cooling fans may be used to prevent resistor overheating.|$|E
5|$|Brooding {{species are}} most often ahermatypic (not reef-building) in areas of high current or wave action. Brooders release only sperm, which is {{negatively}} buoyant, sinking on to the waiting egg carriers who harbor unfertilized eggs for weeks. <b>Synchronous</b> spawning events sometimes occurs even with these species. After fertilization, the corals release planula that are ready to settle.|$|E
5|$|Metis lies inside Jupiter's <b>synchronous</b> orbit radius (as does Adrastea), {{and as a}} result, tidal forces slowly cause {{its orbit}} to decay. If its density is similar to Amalthea's, Metis's orbit lies within the fluid Roche limit; however, because it has not broken up, it must lie outside its rigid Roche limit.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the planets}} in the Solar System have {{secondary}} systems of their own, being orbited by planetary objects called natural satellites, or moons (two of which, Titan and Ganymede, are larger than the planet Mercury), and, {{in the case of}} the four giant planets, by planetary rings, thin bands of tiny particles that orbit them in unison. Most of the largest natural satellites are in <b>synchronous</b> rotation, with one face permanently turned toward their parent.|$|E
5|$|The Cray-3 system {{architecture}} comprised a foreground processing system, up to 16 background processors {{and up to}} 2 gigawords (16 GB) of common memory. The foreground system was dedicated to input/output and system management. It included a 32-bit processor and four <b>synchronous</b> data channels for mass storage and network devices, primarily via HiPPI channels.|$|E
5|$|The Moon is in <b>synchronous</b> rotation: it rotates {{about its}} axis {{in about the}} same time it takes to orbit Earth. This results in it always keeping nearly the same face turned towards Earth. However, due to the effect of libration, about 59% of the Moon's surface can {{actually}} be seen from Earth.|$|E
5|$|The {{orbit of}} Adrastea lies inside Jupiter's <b>synchronous</b> orbit radius (as does Metis's), {{and as a}} result, tidal forces are slowly causing its orbit to decay {{so that it will}} one day impact Jupiter. If its density is similar to Amalthea's then its orbit would {{actually}} lie within the fluid Roche limit. However, since it is not breaking up, it must still lie outside its rigid Roche limit.|$|E
5|$|The stages {{were built}} by the Belgian company Stageco along with the U.S.-based company Enerpac. Each stage {{deployed}} high-pressure, state-of-the-art hydraulic systems. These {{were used for the}} first time ever to assemble and dismantle the high tonnage structure. Stageco designed a unique system, based on Enerpac's <b>Synchronous</b> Lift System, to raise the modular construction to a height of 30 metres in an efficient and effective manner.|$|E
5|$|Titania orbits Uranus at the {{distance}} of about , being the second farthest from the planet among its five major moons. Titania's orbit has a small eccentricity and is inclined very little relative to the equator of Uranus. Its orbital period is around 8.7 days, coincident with its rotational period. In other words, Titania is a <b>synchronous</b> or tidally locked satellite, with one face always pointing toward the planet.|$|E
5|$|Today these {{generators}} aren't used {{any more}} in modern turbines. Instead today most turbines use variable speed generators combined with partial- or full-scale power converter between the turbine generator and the collector system, which generally have more desirable properties for grid interconnection and have Low voltage ride through-capabilities. Modern concepts use either doubly fed machines with partial-scale converters or squirrel-cage induction generators or <b>synchronous</b> generators (both permanently and electrically excited) with full scale converters.|$|E
5|$|Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) allows data packets to be {{used for}} <b>synchronous</b> voice communications. The data packets are marked as voice type packets and can be {{prioritized}} by the network administrators so that the real-time, <b>synchronous</b> conversation is less subject to contention with other types of data traffic which can be delayed (i.e. file transfer or email) or buffered in advance (i.e. audio and video) without detriment. That prioritization is fine when the network has sufficient capacity for all the VoIP calls taking {{place at the same time}} and the network is enabled for prioritization i.e. a private corporate style network, but the Internet is not generally managed in this way and so there can be a big difference in the quality of VoIP calls over a private network and over the public Internet.|$|E
25|$|The {{butterfly}} technique {{with the}} dolphin kick consists of <b>synchronous</b> arm movement with a <b>synchronous</b> leg kick. Good technique {{is crucial to}} swim this style effectively. The wave-like body movement is also very significant in creating propulsion, as {{this is the key}} to easy <b>synchronous</b> over-water recovery and breathing.|$|E
25|$|Once started, a <b>synchronous</b> motor {{requires}} synchronism {{with the}} moving magnetic field's <b>synchronous</b> speed for all normal torque conditions.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes SPI {{is called}} a {{four-wire}} serial bus, contrasting with three-, two-, and one-wire serial buses. The SPI may be accurately described as a <b>synchronous</b> serial interface, but it {{is different from the}} <b>Synchronous</b> Serial Interface (SSI) protocol, which is also a four-wire <b>synchronous</b> serial communication protocol. SSI Protocol employs differential signaling and provides only a single simplex communication channel.|$|E
25|$|In computing, DDR4 SDRAM, an {{abbreviation}} for double data rate fourth-generation <b>synchronous</b> dynamic random-access memory, {{is a type}} of <b>synchronous</b> dynamic random-access memory (SDRAM) with a high bandwidth ("double data rate") interface.|$|E
25|$|Instead {{of using}} a set of {{switched}} capacitors, an unloaded <b>synchronous</b> motor can supply reactive power. The reactive power drawn by the <b>synchronous</b> motor {{is a function of}} its field excitation. This is referred to as a <b>synchronous</b> condenser. It is started and connected to the electrical network. It operates at a leading power factor and puts vars onto the network as required to support a system's voltage or to maintain the system power factor at a specified level.|$|E
25|$|AC {{electric}} motors are either asynchronous or <b>synchronous.</b>|$|E
25|$|The D17B is a <b>synchronous</b> serial {{general-purpose}} digital computer.|$|E
25|$|Synchronizers {{can be used}} to run <b>synchronous</b> {{algorithms}} in asynchronous systems.|$|E
25|$|Rotation {{is equal}} to <b>synchronous</b> speed (motor stator field speed).|$|E
25|$|In SCIM fixed-speed {{operation}} rotation {{is equal}} to <b>synchronous</b> speed less slip speed.|$|E
25|$|The {{simplest}} chain-of-state {{method is}} the linear <b>synchronous</b> transit (LST) method. It operates by taking interpolated points between the reactant and product geometries and choosing {{the one with}} the highest energy for subsequent refinement via a local search. The quadratic <b>synchronous</b> transit (QST) method extends LST by allowing a parabolic reaction path, with optimization of the highest energy point orthogonally to the parabola.|$|E
25|$|Global skew {{achieves}} zero skew {{between two}} <b>synchronous</b> pins without considering logic relationship.|$|E

25|$|Additional {{techniques}} help {{to filter}} the peaks {{that can be}} seen in the 2D <b>synchronous</b> and asynchronous spectra.|$|E
25|$|The {{generator}} converts {{mechanical power}} {{supplied by the}} turbine into electrical power. Low-pole AC <b>synchronous</b> generators of high rated power are used.|$|E
25|$|In <b>synchronous</b> machines, the {{magnetic}} field must be provided by means other than induction such as from separately excited windings or permanent magnets.|$|E
25|$|In the {{analysis}} of distributed algorithms, more attention is usually paid on communication operations than computational steps. Perhaps the simplest model of distributed computing is a <b>synchronous</b> system where all nodes operate in a lockstep fashion. During each communication round, all nodes in parallel (1)receive the latest messages from their neighbours, (2)perform arbitrary local computation, and (3)send new messages to their neighbors. In such systems, a central complexity measure {{is the number of}} <b>synchronous</b> communication rounds required to complete the task.|$|E
25|$|Areosynchronous orbit: A <b>synchronous</b> {{orbit around}} the planet Mars with an orbital period equal in length to Mars' sidereal day, 24.6229 hours.|$|E
25|$|As real {{measurement}} signals {{contain a}} certain level of noise, the derived 2D spectra are influenced and degraded with substantial higher amounts of noise. Hence, interpretation begins with studying the autocorrelation spectrum on the main diagonal of the 2D <b>synchronous</b> spectrum. In the 2D <b>synchronous</b> main diagonal signal on the right 4 peaks are visible at 10, 20, 30, and 40 (see also the 4 corresponding positive autopeaks in the 2D <b>synchronous</b> spectrum on the right). This indicates that in the original dataset 4 peaks of changing intensity are present. The intensity of peaks on the autocorrelation spectrum are directly proportional to the relative importance of the intensity change in the original spectra. Hence, if an intense band is present at position x, it is very likely that a true intensity change is occurring and the peak is not due to noise.|$|E
25|$|GDDR5 SGRAM is a {{graphics}} type of DDR3 <b>synchronous</b> graphics RAM, {{which was}} introduced before DDR4, {{and is not}} a successor to DDR4.|$|E
