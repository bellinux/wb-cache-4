The video could also result in Azrim's prosecution under a law banning adultery, owing to Cut Tari having been married at the time the video was made in 2006.|$|E
50|$|The {{wearing of}} badges became {{more common in}} the late 1800s. Historians have put forth several reasons for the lack of the regular use of a badge; among them, some Rangers felt a shiny badge was a tempting target. Other historians have speculated there was no real need to show a badge to a hostile Native American or outlaw. Additionally, from a {{historical}} viewpoint, a Ranger's pay was so scanty that the money required for such fancy accoutrements was rarely available. Nevertheless, some Rangers did wear badges, and the first of these appeared around 1875. They were locally made and varied considerably from one to another, but they invariably represented a <b>star</b> <b>cut</b> from a Mexican silver coin (usually a five-pesos coin). The design is reminiscent of Texas's Lone Star flag.|$|E

She was hung by her hair, burned with hot irons, had a five-pointed <b>star</b> <b>cut</b> into her back and the wound rubbed with salt, and suffered a broken arm and broken ribs. She endured her suffering stoically, and even cheered her imprisoned comrades by reciting Lermontov's epic poem Demon, which she knew by heart. Even in the note which she managed to pass secretly to her relatives, knowing her death was near, she expressed faith in victory and called for her brother Elisha to stand firmly for his homeland.|$|E
