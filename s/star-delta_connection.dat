40|$|This paper {{examines}} the rearrangement of the stator winding of a 3 -phase synchronous generator {{to produce a}} 6 -phase output. This machine is configured such that one group of coils are connected in star topology while and other group of coil are configured in delta topology. This thereby produces the opportunity to interface the machine with a 12 -pulse rectifier. The redesign of the winding and selection of the appropriate number of turns is presented. A 16 pole, 36 slot machine is evaluated in this paper and finite element results are obtained for multiple load conditions under 12 -pulse rectification as well as 6 -pulse rectification for comparison. It is shown that, the <b>star-delta</b> <b>connection</b> with 12 -pulse rectification reduces the voltage ripple {{in the range of}} 25 to 40 V in a 540 V DC link. The machine operates with lower core losses. The machine efficiency observed with 12 -pulse rectifier operation is the same with that of 6 -pulse rectification...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 110) The {{solution of}} unbalanced electrical circuits {{has been found}} to be most practical by the method of Symmetrical Components. It is very powerful analytical tool and is based on sound theory. This project is intended to meet the needs of the practicing engineer and the engineering student. It presupposes a knowledge of fundamental single phase and poly phase circuit theory and the operating characteristics of the more important types of alternating current apparatus. A theoretical analysis is based on the assumption of three phase abc system. The paper was undertaken to investigate the characteristics of loads, when the systems are connected in three different ways. These three connections are star connected loads, grounded star connected loads and delta connected loads. Results from these informations are then developed into the ???a??? matrix transformation in each case, The advantages of these matrix trans formations are essential to be able to look at the phase diagram and immediately write the necessary sequence components from it. This paper also deals with the three phase, two winding transformers, From the knowledge of the Symmetrical Components are then decomposed the voltages and currents into a matrix equation which lead us to the solution of the equivalent circuits of the trans formers. Three different connections of two winding transformers were created to study (Delta-Delta connection, Star-Star connection and <b>Star-Delta</b> <b>connection).</b> The illustration involving the applications of the Symmetrical Components to solve the unbalanced three phase system is also presented in this paper...|$|E

The economics of a scalar controlled 100 HP induction motor is investigated with three topologies namely <b>star-delta</b> (S/D) <b>connection,</b> constant Volt/frequency (V/f) controller and Differential Evolution (DE) controller in steady-state conditions. In this study, the flux level in a machine has been considered to adjust to give minimum operating cost for the textile mill load. The flux controller improves the economics in terms of operating cost (energy cost and demand charge cost) and the test {{results show that the}} flux level in the most economic motor will be adjusted according to load and speed, particularly at light load. Standard benchmark problems (Rastingin and Griewank) have been considered for validation of the proposed DE controller for induction motor operating cost minimization. Case study also presented in this paper. Index Terms — Differential evolution, economics, induction motor, loss minimization...|$|R
40|$|Sustainable energy {{solutions}} are aimed {{to reduce the}} consumption of fossil fuels by using renewable energy sources and energy efficiency techniques. This thesis presents two new sustainable energy applications {{in the field of}} electrical machines. Polyphase induction motors dominate the energy usage spectrum for industrial and commercial applications. The conventional winding structure used in both synchronous and induction machines has a basic unit of the winding with a 60 degree phase belt and a three phase connection either in star or delta. A new winding structure using an innovative <b>Star-Delta</b> Series <b>Connection</b> (SDSC) which has a high winding coefficient and low harmonic content is presented in this thesis. The principle of the SDSC winding is described. The Electro-Magnetic Belt and Electro-Magnetic Space diagram are two important means to be used for optimization of the new winding. Experimental results from two prototypes confirm the theoretical analysis. The efficiency of the new machine at rated load increased by about 3. 8 % as compared to the standard machine with a conventional winding structure. Wind energy {{is one of the most}} attractive renewable energy options. Wind turbines are designed to couple either synchronous or asynchronous generators with various forms of direct or indirect connection with grid or diesel generators. Permanent magnet (PM) generators using high energy Neodymium- Iron-Boron magnets offer advantages such as direct coupling without gear box, absence of excitation winding and slip rings, light weight and smaller size. This thesis presents the design and development of an outer-rotor PM generator suitable for wind energy conversion. The initial electromagnetic design followed by a Finite Element Analysis is presented in detail. A 20 kW prototype machine was built and extensively tested. It was found that the machine could maintain an ++efficiency of about 85 % for a wide operating range. Equivalent circuit models were developed. The results of the Finite Element analysis matches closely with the experimental and the designed values...|$|R
