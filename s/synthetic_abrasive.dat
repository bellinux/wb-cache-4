40|$|Abrasive Waterjet cutting (AWJ) {{presents}} {{many advantages}} over competing machining techniques, but several issues {{are related to}} the high volume of materials (and in particular of abrasive) used in the process. In this study, the environmental impact of the material flows in the abrasive waterjet industry has been analyzed adopting a life cycle perspective in order to individuate which phases place the largest burden on the environment. Moreover, three alternative abrasives (crushed rock, recycled glass and <b>synthetic</b> <b>abrasive)</b> and three disposal practices (in-site recycling, off-site recycling and recycling as construction material) have been also evaluated to estimate the benefits that can be achieved if these could be used in place of garnet abrasives and landfilling. The transportation of the abrasive resulted to be the phase that has the largest influence in every case and thus should be reduced as much as possible. For what concerns the alternative options, the usage of recycled glass and the in-site recycling of the abrasive were the two alternatives with the best environmental performances. However, crushed rock could be the best option for what concerns the global warming potential if carbon sequestration due to carbonation of silicate rocks is taken into account. Off-site recycling and recycling as construction material are good options only if the transportation to the recycling site can be reduced. <b>Synthetic</b> <b>abrasive</b> are instead found to have a much larger impact compared to every other alternative examined...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Grinding {{wheels are}} made of natural or <b>synthetic</b> <b>abrasive</b> {{minerals}} bonded together in a matrix to form a wheel. For manufacturers, grinding wheels provide {{an efficient way to}} shape and finish metals and other materials. Grinding wheels are the only way to create parts with precision dimensions and high-quality surface finishes. At this time, grinding wheels are used in almost every industry. Manufacturing of a grinding wheel consist of mixing abrasive grains, binders and bonding materials. Three important components, abrasive grains with binders and bonding materials, make up any grinding wheel. The, additives are mixed to create a wheel with the properties necessary to shape a particular material in the manner desired. Abrasive grains include the central part of any grinding wheel, and the toughness and friability of th...|$|E

50|$|Abrasives {{are shaped}} for various purposes. Natural {{abrasives}} are often sold as dressed stones, {{usually in the}} form of a rectangular block. Both natural and <b>synthetic</b> <b>abrasives</b> are commonly available in a wide variety of shapes, often coming as bonded or coated abrasives, including blocks, belts, discs, wheels, sheets, rods and loose grains.|$|R
50|$|Abrasives may be {{classified}} as either natural or synthetic. When discussing sharpening stones, natural stones have long been considered superior but advances in material technology are seeing this distinction become less distinct. Many <b>synthetic</b> <b>abrasives</b> are effectively identical to a natural mineral, differing only in that the synthetic mineral has been manufactured rather than been mined. Impurities in the natural mineral may make it less effective.|$|R
40|$|Grinding {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{versatile}} methods of removing material from machine parts by the cutting action of the countless hard and sharp abrasive particles of a revolving grinding wheel. It works by forcing the abrasive grains into the surface of the workpiece so that each grain cuts away a small bit of material in the form of chips. Abrasive grinding wheel is an expendable wheel that carries an abrasive compound on its periphery. They are made of small, sharp and very hard natural or <b>synthetic</b> <b>abrasive</b> minerals, bonded together in a matrix to form a wheel. The paper presents a review of some of the characteristics as well as theoretical considerations of operations of abrasive grinding wheel.

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, static-pressure strength, {{toughness}} index (TI) and thermal-{{toughness index}} (TTI) of each sample have been analyzed {{on the basis}} of the experimental studies on the magnetic separation and heavy liquid separation of diamond abrasives. The results show that the magnetism of <b>synthetic</b> diamond <b>abrasives</b> has an obvious influence on their mechanical performances. With the increase of magnetism, <b>synthetic</b> diamond <b>abrasive</b> particles becomes darker and darker in appearance color, and have more bubbles, impurities and defects inside the particles, furthermore, their surface fineness observed under the microscope will be found worse. While, the static-pressure strength, the TI under the normal temperature and TTI all become lower and lower. But the influence on the static-pressure strength and the TI is smaller, however the influence on TTI is the greater. The specific gravity of <b>synthetic</b> diamond <b>abrasives</b> has little influence on their mechanical performances...|$|R

30|$|Thermal spray {{coatings}} can be {{used for}} wear, corrosion and erosion resistance. They are used to resist almost all forms of wear, including erosive, abrasive, and adhesive, in nearly every type of industry. The materials used range from hard metals to soft metal alloys to oxides to carbide-based cermet. Flame-sprayed aluminum and zinc coatings are frequently used for corrosion resistance on bridges, ships, and other structures. Other thermal spray coatings are used for their corrosion resistance, often coupled with their wear resistance. Thermal spray coatings are used in some applications to provide specific frictional characteristics to a surface, covering the full spectrum from low friction to high friction. Textile industry provides an application covering the complete range of friction characteristics and surface topography to handle very <b>abrasive</b> <b>synthetic</b> fiber.|$|R

Following <b>abrasive</b> or wet casting immobilization of multiwall CNTs onto glassy carbon substrates, the linker groups were covalently grafted to the CNTs either by electrochemical reduction of C 6 H 4 CH 2 NHBoc diazonium salt or oxidation of Boc-EDA. The Boc group was then removed and the anthraquinone groups attached to the linker by amide coupling using solid-phase synthesis methods. The surface coverage, stability, affect of pH and buffer capacity of the tethered anthraquinone groups was investigated by cyclic voltammetry.

40|$|A {{combined}} approach using solid state electroanalysis (abrasive stripping voltammetry) and ESR spectroscopy {{was made to}} characterize the different species of manganese which are present in natural and <b>synthetic</b> calcium carbonates. <b>Abrasive</b> stripping voltammetry permits identifying Mn 02 and MnC 03, but the method fails {{when it comes to}} detecting unambiguously MnC 03 in the presenee of Mn 02. Neither can this method detect Mn 2 + ions in mixed crystals of Cal_xMIlxC 03 because of their low concentrations. ESR spectroscopy can show that Mn 2 + ions are present in calcite on Ca 2 + sites. Additionally, information about the state and symmetry of Mn 2 + site s and the local dynamics of the lattice can be obtained. In aragonite, only extremely small amounts of individual Mn 2 + ions are present and most of the manganese is found in the form of Mn 02 agglomerates. Solid state electroanalysis and ESR spectroscopy allow a rather complete qualitative specification of manganese in calcium carbonates...|$|R
40|$|Diamond {{reinforced}} metal-matrix composites (MMCs) are utilised for cutting, drilling, grinding {{and polishing}} a variety of materials, in many cases being the most efficient and economic choice. The increased cost of <b>synthetic</b> diamond <b>abrasives</b> has led to constant search for ways to extent diamond tool life. This has been realised by introducing chemical reactions at the interfaces {{in order to develop}} chemical bridges between diamonds and metals that prolong the retention of crystals at the operating surfaces of the tools. Alloying the matrix with carbide forming metals is a way to introduce interfacial reactivity, but involves problems with concentrating the alloying element at the interfacial region and may cause alteration of the wear resistance characteristics of the binder, which may be an undesirable effect. A recent development and alternative method to alloying is the coating of the diamonds with carbide forming metals, offering unique advantages. Although metal-coated diamonds are commercially available, the effectiveness of their usage and the understanding of interfacial phenomena occurring in composites reinforced with such abrasives still remain unexplored. The work carried out in this research has examined the interfacial bonding in diamond MMCs reinforced with metal-coated crystals. The work described in this thesis included a preliminary study on diamond/metal reactivity serving the need to identify the mode and intensity at which synthetic diamonds and elemental metals interact at various conditions. This was achieved by examining the changes occurring to diamond surfaces when crystals were heated in the presence of various elemental metals. The latter were brought in contact with the diamonds either in the form of loose or hot-pressed metallic powders or in the form of thin metal coatings deposited onto the crystals by vapour deposition methods. Results showed that metals, depending on their electronic configuration, either catalyse the graphitisation of diamond surfaces and dissolve carbon or react at the diamond surfaces to form carbide crystallites. Dissolution of the diamond occurred by formation of oriented hexagonal/triangular and rectangular pits on octahedral { 111 } and cubic { 100 } surfaces respectively. Intensity of interactions strongly depended on heating temperature and time. Metal coatings were found to efficiently react with the diamonds only after annealing at temperatures of the order of 1000 °C subsequent to the deposition. The diamond impregnated MMCs investigated in this research were reinforced with various types of metal-coated and metal-powder encapsulated diamonds of the carbide forming metals of Ti, Cr and W. The tested composites included two types of metal-matrices that of standard plain cobalt as well as some selected alloyed matrices typically employed in practice. Interfacial bonding characterisation and assessment of the potential capability of the metal-coatings to offer enhanced diamond retention has been made by determining the mechanical properties of the composites and by conducting extensive microscopic analysis of the developed fracture surfaces. The results suggested that incorporating metal-coated crystals could be beneficial in improving the diamond retention, provided that consolidation temperature is sufficiently high to favour diamond/metal reactions. Results showed improvements in mechanical properties to be achieved when reinforcing with the coated diamonds compared to non-coated grit. The characteristics of the interactions at the diamond surfaces in the composites conformed to the findings of the preliminary study on the fundamentals of diamond/metals interactions. Reactions on crystal surfaces took place at the locations where prior dissolution of the diamond had occurred. Metal coatings were found to provide excellent protection to the diamonds against catalysed dissolution by aggressive binders. Thin coatings suffered from loss of continuity in systems were the coating metal atoms were readily soluble in the metal-matrix. This was avoided with thicker coatings that also appeared to provide a supplementary mechanical effect in addition to the chemical bonding in improving the retention of the diamond crystals. Encapsulation of diamond with carbide forming metals was a hybrid method between alloying the metal-matrix and coating the crystals. Although encapsulation provided sufficient levels of chemical interactions, it was shown that diamonds could not be efficiently protected from aggressive binders. In addition, composites impregnated with powder-encapsulated diamonds suffered from inadequate sintering of the carbide forming metal zones surrounding the crystals when consolidation was performed at relatively low temperatures which was reflected in inferior mechanical properties.
