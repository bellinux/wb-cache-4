500|$|The Blade Runner soundtrack by Vangelis {{is a dark}} melodic {{combination}} of classic composition and futuristic synthesizers which mirrors the film-noir retro-future envisioned by Ridley Scott. Vangelis, fresh from his Academy Award-winning score for Chariots of Fire, composed and performed the music on his synthesizers. He also made use of various chimes and the vocals of collaborator Demis Roussos. Another memorable sound is the haunting tenor sax solo [...] "Love Theme" [...] by British saxophonist Dick Morrissey, who performed on many of Vangelis's albums. Ridley Scott also used [...] "Memories of Green" [...] from the Vangelis album <b>See</b> <b>You</b> <b>Later,</b> an orchestral version of which Scott would later use in his film Someone to Watch Over Me.|$|E
