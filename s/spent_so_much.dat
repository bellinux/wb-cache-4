After ten minutes of trying, Leonard finally gets in the queue but is 15,211th in line. Tickets run out and the four men are {{disappointed}} {{that they will not}} be able to attend, especially as they had <b>spent</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> time on their costumes, intending to go as different versions of the Hulk as portrayed by Lou Ferrigno, Eric Bana, Edward Norton, and Mark Ruffalo.|$|E

25|$|Bale {{is a huge}} golf fan and has {{a replica}} of the 17th hole at TPC Sawgrass in his back garden. His love of golf was blamed by the Spanish media as the reason why he has <b>spent</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> time out injured for Real Madrid.|$|E
25|$|When the Supreme Court Building {{opened in}} 1935, McReynolds, {{like most of}} the other justices, refused to move his office into the new building; he {{continued}} to work out of the office he maintained in his apartment. His reason was that with the country in the turmoil of the Great Depression, it was unconscionable to have <b>spent</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> money on a single building.|$|E

50|$|Bevans was Principal of New Inn Hall, Oxford in 1585-6, and Principal of Jesus College from 1586 to 1602. He {{was also}} {{chancellor}} to Herbert Westfaling, Bishop of Hereford, and <b>so</b> <b>spent</b> <b>much</b> {{of his time}} as Principal in Hereford. In his absence, Griffith Powell (who was to become Principal himself in 1613) effectively ran the college {{during much of the}} time that Bevan was Principal. Bevans died in 1602, the same year as Westfaling.|$|R

The lowest was that of R 716, which recorded just 88,909 miles (143,085km) in just four years of service before being withdrawn in 1956 and scrapped in 1962.|$|E
25|$|The {{collapse}} of the army that Reza Shah had <b>spent</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> time and effort creating was humiliating. Many of the military generals had behaved incompetently or secretly sympathised with the British and ended up sabotaging the Iranian resistance. The army generals met in secret to discuss surrender options. When the Shah learned of the generals' actions, he beat {{the head of the}} armed forces General Ahmad Nakhjavan with a cane and physically stripped him of his rank. He was nearly shot by the Shah on the spot, but at the insistence of the Crown Prince, he was sent to prison instead.|$|E
25|$|On 31 July 1960, Valentino met Giancarlo Giammetti at the Café de Paris on the Via Veneto in Rome. One {{of three}} children, Giammetti {{was in his}} second year of {{architecture}} school, living at home with his parents in the haut bourgeois Parioli section of Northern Rome. That day Giammetti gave Valentino a lift home in his Fiat and a friendship, as well as a long-lasting partnership, started. The day after, Giammetti was to leave for Capri for vacation and, by coincidence, Valentino was also going there, so they met again on the island 10 days later. Giammetti would shortly thereafter abandon the University to become Valentino's business partner. When Giammetti arrived, the business situation of Valentino's atelier was in fact not brilliant: in one year he had <b>spent</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> money that his father's associate pulled out of the business, and had to fight against bankruptcy.|$|E
25|$|Finance {{should also}} be {{providing}} the information, analysis and advice to enable the organizations’ service managers to operate effectively. This goes beyond the traditional preoccupation with budgets – how <b>much</b> have we <b>spent</b> <b>so</b> far, how <b>much</b> do we have left to spend? It is about helping the organization to better understand its own performance. That means making the connections and understanding the relationships between given inputs – the resources brought to bear – and the outputs and outcomes that they achieve. It is also about understanding and actively managing risks within the organization and its activities.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the mid-19th}} century, Cornwall took on another {{personality}} [...] - [...] a health retreat. Until the early 20th century, city folk {{flocked to the}} Valley to experience the therapeutic powers they believed it to hold. The mountains, fresh air and evergreen forests were thought to offer the perfect conditions for good health {{and they were not}} far from the city. Cornwall {{on the west side of}} the Hudson became especially popular as a health retreat, offering numerous boarding houses and many conveniences of the day, including accessibility to the railroad and steamboats, as well as a telegraph office and large library. Nathaniel Parker Willis, one of the Knickerbocker writers, enjoyed the time he <b>spent</b> here <b>so</b> <b>much</b> he bought property in Cornwall, establishing a country home he called Idlewild. His many writings on the area helped make Cornwall a popular spot for health-seekers.|$|R
2500|$|Returning to Boston in July 1832, Howe began {{receiving}} a few blind children at his father’s house in Pleasant Street. He gradually developed {{what became the}} noted Perkins Institution. In January 1833 the funds available were all <b>spent,</b> but <b>so</b> <b>much</b> progress had been shown that the legislature approved funding, later increased to $30,000 a year, to the institution on condition that it should educate gratuitously twenty poor blind from the state. Collections of funds were also contributed from Salem and Boston. Colonel Thomas Handasyd Perkins, a prominent Boston trader in slaves, furs, and opium, presented his mansion and grounds in Pearl Street {{as a location for}} the school in perpetuity. This building was later found unsuitable and Colonel Perkins consented to its sale. In 1839 the institution was moved to the former Mount Washington House Hotel in South Boston. It was henceforth known as the Perkins Institution and Massachusetts Asylum (or, since 1877, School for the Blind.) ...|$|R
25|$|The first {{scheduled}} service with a Class 72 train occurred on 8 August 2002 on the Jæren Commuter Rail. NSB {{stated that they}} had never previously <b>spent</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> time testing equipment before putting it into service, and that the Jæren had been chosen for the introduction because the single-line system was easier to operate than the services around Oslo. The company also stated that they hoped all the trains would be in service by the end of 2003. By January 2003, half the trains had been delivered, and were gradually being put into service on the Oslo Commuter Rail. However, on the Gardermoen Line the electronics from the train were interfering with the signaling systems, so the lights would switch from green to red before the train passed, instead of afterwards. This made it impossible for the NSB to put the train into service on Norway's only high-speed line. Another problem was that the trains would not close the doors if they were at a station without level tracks, although this was quickly solved. In 2003, NSB decided to abandon the Puls concept, and revert to the former single-profile strategy.|$|E
25|$|Tailchaser's Song begins, after quoting {{a poem by}} Christopher Smart, with an {{exposition}} of the central elements of the cats' mythology, starting with a creation myth. This both frames the further developments of cat mythology and culture throughout the story and provides necessary backstory for the novel itself. Meerclar Allmother is identified as the primordial creator of all other beings, who brought forth a pair of cats who are the progenitors of the entire species as well as divine figures. Harar Goldeneye is the male, and Fela Skydancer the female. The first litter of this pair are also divine. These three cats are called the Firstborn; the middle child, Grizraz Hearteater, raises a monstrous hound out of jealousy and sets it to attack all cats. The eldest of the three, Viror Whitewind, slays the creature but is himself mortally wounded. Hearteater is driven out and flees beneath the ground where he searches out arcane lore, while Whitewind's death causes his father to flee to the heavens after searching for Hearteater in a murderous rage and causes his mother to be silent {{for the rest of}} his life. His youngest brother, Tangaloor Firefoot, renounced his claim to the throne and fled from the court out of grief. As a result of a further encounter with Firefoot, Hearteater is blinded by sun after having <b>spent</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> time beneath the earth, and retreats back beneath the ground, where it is supposed that he plots further destruction.|$|E

He was infatuated with the idea because he <b>spent</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> time there. He is just totally consumed with murder all the time." [...] Nelson's impressions were similar: [...] "It was the absolute misogyny of his crimes that stunned me," [...] she wrote, [...] "his manifest rage against women. He had no compassion at all ... he was totally engrossed in the details. His murders were his life's accomplishments." ...|$|E

60|$|He was not {{the less}} alone for having <b>spent</b> <b>so</b> many years in {{seclusion}} and retirement. This was no better preparation than a round of social cheerfulness: perhaps it even increased the keenness of his sensibility. He had been so dependent upon her for companionship and love; {{she had come to}} be <b>so</b> <b>much</b> a part and parcel of his existence; they had had so many cares and thoughts in common, which no one else had shared; that losing her was beginning life anew, and being required to summon up the hope and elasticity of youth, amid the doubts, distrusts, and weakened energies of age.|$|R

By these and other extravagances the genteel are reduced to poverty, and forced to borrow of those whom they formerly despised, but who, through industry and frugality, have maintained their standing; in which case it appears plainly that, A plowman on his legs is higher than a gentleman on his knees, as Poor Richard says. Perhaps they have a small estate left them which they knew not the getting of; they think, It is day and it never will be night; that a little to be <b>spent</b> out of <b>so</b> <b>much</b> is not worth minding; but, Always taking out of the meal tub and never putting in, soon comes to the bottom, as Poor Richard says; and then, When the well is dry, they know the worth of water. But this they might have known before, if they had taken his advice. If you would know the value of money, go and try to borrow some; for, He that goes a-borrowing goes a-sorrowing, as Poor Richard says; and, indeed, so does he that lends to such people, {{when he goes to}} get it in again.

500|$|The Second Test in Cape Town saw an Australian victory, {{the first}} in Davidson's 14 Tests. He took 2/31 and 2/18 as South Africa lost by an innings after being forced to follow on. It was during this match that Davidson earned his famous {{reputation}} for injury complaints, something that became {{a constant source of}} humour; he <b>spent</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> time on the massage table that his teammates attached a plaque that read [...] "The AK Davidson Autograph Treatment Table". Benaud reported that Davidson persistently complained to captain Craig about an injury before delivering the next ball with high pace and swing.|$|E

He told her about a love scene between competing ballet dancers, and Portman recalled, [...] "I thought that was very interesting because this movie is in so many ways an exploration of an artist's ego and that narcissistic sort of attraction to yourself and also repulsion with yourself." [...] On the decade's wait before production, she said, [...] "The fact that I had <b>spent</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> time with the idea ... allowed it to marinate a little before we shot." ...|$|E
500|$|Radiohead {{had created}} Kid A and Amnesiac, {{recorded}} simultaneously, through a years-long process of recording and editing that drummer Phil Selway described as [...] "manufacturing {{music in the}} studio". For their next album, the band sought to capture a more immediate, [...] "live" [...] sound. Yorke told MTV: [...] "The last two studio records were a real headache. We had <b>spent</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> time looking at computers and grids, we were like, that's enough, we can't do that any more. This time, we used computers, {{but they had to}} actually be in the room with all the gear. So everything was about performance, like staging a play." ...|$|E
5000|$|The album {{received}} universal acclaim with Metacritic {{giving it}} a score of 81 from 11 reviews. Phil Freeman, in his review for AllMusic states, [...] "He can clearly make a piano {{do just about anything}} he wants it to, and Solo is a project that puts the thought that went into its construction clearly visible, but it's never breathtaking in the way a truly great solo piano performance can be". The Guardian review by John Fordham awarded the album 4 stars noting [...] "Pianist Vijay Iyer's wealth of traditional jazz experience might not always be apparent in the organised, intricate contemporary music he plays with his own groups". PopMatters' Will Layman said [...] "Iyer defies comparison other than in convincing you that he belongs in august company. If this first solo recital was a historical test, then Vijay Iyer gets an A". Writing for All About Jazz, Lyn Horton was less enthusiastic stating [...] "Music history is already integrated into Iyer's being. If he were only {{to step out of the}} academic environment in which he has <b>spent</b> and spends <b>so</b> <b>much</b> time, he might stop following a never-ending path of reinterpreting history in order to move his compositional strength forward. It is likely that Iyer will receive positive accolades for this premiere solo effort. But his awareness of what he can do best seems to have slipped away".|$|R

She looked older, too; and contrasting her with the girl who had first looked in at his door, Moss could scarcely believe that less than half a year had affected this change in her. He was too keen an observer not to know that part of this was due to a refining taste in hats and gowns, but beneath all these superficial traits she had grown swiftly in the expression of security and power.|$|R

And I <b>spent</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> time {{building}} that trophy case." [...] The scene then cuts to the trophy case with an Academy Award in it that Homer has stolen. In the original Fox broadcast, the name in the inscription on the Academy Award was Haing S. Ngor. In American syndication and the season seven DVD, the name was changed to Don Ameche (who had won for Cocoon). Ngor, who won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for the 1984 film The Killing Fields, was murdered on February 25, 1996, between the original and the syndicated broadcast. Producers were concerned the syndicated episode would imply Homer had murdered Ngor to steal the statue.|$|E
500|$|Dawson did biographical {{research}} {{in order to}} develop the novel. Though she is interested in writing biography, she finds that novels are an easier genre to express her understanding of the historical individual. When writing her historical novels Dawson does not embark on a thorough bout of research beforehand, instead she researches as she writes. While researching the novel, Dawson read nine biographies of Brooke, finding different elements of his life in each one, and felt that she had an additional understanding of Brooke which need to be expressed. [...] Dawson includes an extensive bibliography {{in the back of the}} novel showing where passages and ideas in the novel are from. She said that she included the bibliography in order to show readers where she found [...] " [...] Rupert, a figure of [...] imagination". Dawson <b>spent</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> time researching and thinking about Brooke, her husband once asked her [...] "when is this obsession going to end?" ...|$|E
500|$|Hańska {{lived with}} Balzac's mother {{for a time}} after his death, in the house he had <b>spent</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> time and expense furnishing. The elder Mme. Balzac moved in with a friend after several months, and Hańska {{approached}} the remains of her late husband's writing. Several works had been left incomplete, and publishers inquired about releasing a final edition of his grand collection La Comédie humaine. Hańska sponsored new editions of his works and was involved in editing some of them, even adding occasional content. Balzac's debt, meanwhile, still exceeded 200,000 francs, which Hańska paid while also providing for his mother's living expenses. One of her letters at the time gives voice to her frustrations: [...] "In nursing my husband's incurable malady I ruined my health, just as I have ruined my private fortune in accepting the inheritance of debts and embarrassments which he left me." [...] Anna and Jerzy moved into a nearby house in Paris.|$|E
