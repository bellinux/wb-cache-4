30|$|Nanowires are {{considered}} {{building blocks for}} the ultimate scaling of MOS transistors, capable of pushing devices until the most extreme boundaries of miniaturization thanks to their physical and geometrical properties. In particular, nanowires’ <b>suitability</b> <b>for</b> <b>forming</b> a gate-all-around (GAA) configuration confers to the device an optimum electrostatic control of the gate over the conduction channel and then a better immunity against the short channel effects (SCE). In this letter, a large-scale process of GAA vertical silicon nanowire (VNW) MOSFETs is presented. A top-down approach is adopted for the realization of VNWs with an optimum reproducibility followed by thin layer engineering at nanoscale. Good overall electrical performances were obtained, with excellent electrostatic behavior (a subthreshold slope (SS) of 95  mV/dec and a drain induced barrier lowering (DIBL) of 25  mV/V) for a 15 -nm gate length. Finally, a first demonstration of dual integration of n-type and p-type VNW transistors for the realization of CMOS inverter is proposed.|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the premise that ceramics might sometimes profitably be shaped using techniques more traditionally associated with metals and plastics, particularly forging of solids and extrusion of liquids. This firstly required that the high temperature formability of ceramics be known. Existing forming and associated testing techniques were therefore surveyed, establishing short-comings and pointing to areas requiring new techniques. Plastic deformation mechanisms of principal simple ceramics were reviewed to determine the scope of novel techniques required, and to show evidence of <b>suitability</b> <b>for</b> <b>forming.</b> Emphasis {{was given to the}} deformation behaviour of alumina, the ceramic chosen for experimental investigation. Five rigs were constructed for an experimental schedule in three phases: (I) two furnaces and one press were used to study the compatibility of alumina with graphite, tantalum, tungsten and molybdenum under forming conditions. Some original microhardness values for carbides were measured. Observations were made of graphite's spectral emissivity. Sensitive temperature control was achieved. ii) a special melting unit was developed for inflating molten alumina to form hollow spheres, resembling blow-moulding of glass and plastics. Thermal endurances of tungsten heaters in vacuo, in argon and in molten alumina were studied. Heat transfer through sintered and powder alumina was measured. The spectral emissivity of sintered alumina was found. The freezing contraction of molten alumina, and the contact angle with tungsten were found accurately using a novel technique with possible wide application. iii) a multipurpose rig with tungsten tooling was constructed for tests of alternating drivedown - stress relaxation, compressive creep, and forging on recrystallised alumina. The experiments gave information on forgeability, ductility above 1150 C, crack healing, tertiary creep rate, pore distribution effect on steady state creep rate, and pore closing contribution to deformation. It was concluded that forging and liquid extrusion of alumina is feasible and is sometimes preferable to traditional shaping methods...|$|E
40|$|Ionic Liquid Ion Sources (ILIS) are {{a subset}} of {{electrospray}} capable of producing bipolar beams of pure ions from ionic liquids. Ionic liquids are room temperature molten salts, characterized by negligible vapor pressures, relative high conductivities and surface tensions lower than water. Compared with the colloid form of electrospray, renowned for its applications to spectroscopy, ILIS yield highly monoenergetic beams composed entirely of ions. In this respect they are similar to Liquid Metal Ions Sources, but offer the ability to emit {{both positive and negative}} ions from a benign propellant that remains in the liquid state over a wide range of temperatures. When applied to spacecraft propulsion these sources are very power efficient and yield high specific impulses. Furthermore. the low flow rates and negligible vapor pressures of ionic liquids allow for passive feeding systems which can remain exposed to the vacuum of space. This configuration would remove the need for pressurized propellant tanks or valves, both of which are difficult to miniaturize for small satellites. However; the thrust produced from each emitter is very low, less than 0. 1 [mu]N. As a result, compact arrays of active ILIS have been sought since their discovery. If arrays of modest packing density (~ 5 emitters/mm²) could be achieved, ILIS as thrusters would offer a scalable form of propulsion capable of providing useful thrust levels to small satellites with performance comparable to established, but difficult to miniaturize, plasma based ion engines. This research has sought a technique for creating arrays of ILIS from bulk porous substrates as part of an overall process for microfabricating complete thrusters. The thesis includes a survey of potential fabrication methods considering both <b>suitability</b> <b>for</b> <b>forming</b> arrays of ILIS and the ability to integrate each technique within a thruster packaging process. Electrochemical etching is highly selective and can proceed at rates which are limited by mass transport conditions. In this thesis we show how this etching regime can be exploited to smoothly remove material from the surface of a bulk porous metal substrate without damaging the internal pore structure. Dry film photoresists have been identified as a suitable alternative to spin on techniques for porous materials and have been applied within an electrochemical etching process. A two step process for forming arrays of ILIS has been motivated using numerical simulations of the etching process to predict emitter profiles and investigate the impacts of non-uniform etching conditions. These concepts have been applied experimentally using a custom built, automated, etching station capable of repeatedly producing arrays of 480 emitters spaced 500 pm apart on a 1 x 1 cm porous nickel substrate pre-mounted, and aligned, within a silicon thruster package. The emitters are typically 165 [mu]m tall with rounded tips suitable for operation as ILIS. Pulsed voltage conditions were found to significantly enhance wafer level uniformity enabling fabrication of functional emitters within a few hundred [mu]m of the substrate boundary. The structures have been smoothed and rounded, making them suitable for use as ILIS, during a secondary etch process using electrolytes doped with nickel chloride to suppress transient effects. These doped solutions enabled a few [mu]m of material to be removed selectively from the porous surface while maintaining smooth features. These arrays have been mounted and aligned with electrostatic grids to demonstrate their emission capabilities. Propellant has been fed to the emitters by capillarity within the porous bulk and then extracted at potentials as low as 850 V. Beam currents exceeding several 100 [mu]A at both positive and negative polarities have been measured using both EMIIm and EMI-BF₄ ionic liquid propellant. Two complete devices were tested yielding large beam currents and very high transmission fractions (- 88 - 100 %) from both attempts. We estimate that these devices can supply 10 's of [mu]N of thrust at modest operating potentials, ~ 1. 5 kV. with a specific impulse of roughly 2000 - 3000 s. When completely packaged, the thrusters measure 1. 2 x 1. 2 x 0. 2 cm, weigh less than 1 g and require less than 0. 65 W of operating power. These characteristics would be ideal for a small satellites where volume, mass and power are all at a premium, while the thrust levels would be sufficient to enable a variety of orbit variation and attitude control maneuvers. For example, applied to a CubeSat, this type of thruster system, including PPU, would occupy roughly 10 % of the spacecraft volume and mass while enabling de-orbiting from an 800 km altitude in roughly 100 days, compared with many years when left to decay naturally. by Daniel George Courtney.

40|$|Mitoxantrone {{is useful}} for the {{treatment}} of cancer and MS and, as with other chemotherapeutic agents, many studies have examined its tolerability. The suitability of mitoxantrone in MS is particularly interesting because of its role in treating various stages of the disease. Evidence shows that mitoxantrone could be a first-line treatment <b>for</b> malignant <b>forms</b> of MS, and a second-line drug in relapsing-remitting or secondary progressive MS that is unresponsive to interferon beta- 1 a, - 1 b or glatiramer acetate. Mitoxantrone should, however, be restricted to patients with demonstrable inflammatory disease activity, and should only be prescribed by neurologists with previous experience in both MS and mitoxantrone therapy. This review examines the properties of mitoxantrone, its tolerability, and discusses its <b>suitability</b> <b>for</b> treating various <b>forms</b> of MS, referring to several important studies...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThere is some {{controversy}} amongst respiratory physicians over {{the value of}} domiciliary nebuliser use for chronic lung conditions. Most recommendations <b>for</b> assessment of <b>suitability</b> <b>for</b> this <b>form</b> of treatment rely upon response to lung function tests and reported improvements in exercise ability. Relatively little emphasis has been placed upon the patient view of this therapy. This survey examined the subjective views of patients receiving domiciliary nebulisers regarding this treatment. A postal questionnaire was sent to 82 patients using home nebuliser treatment provided by the respiratory clinic at Whipps Cross University Hospital, London. It consisted of 29 structured questions covering topics of well-being and symptom control, self-confidence, dependency, time and technical issues, as well as side effects and compliance. Most patients surveyed had chronic obstructive lung disease. For almost all sections of the questionnaire patients reported overwhelmingly {{that the benefits of}} using a nebuliser outweighed potential disadvantages. The main perceived advantages were the ability for patients themselves to control symptoms and to be less dependent on General Practitioners, hospitals and carers. Compliance was generally excellent, and the reported side effects were minor and relatively infrequent. The results strongly support the view that nebulisers are helpful in managing chronic lung disease in the community, with benefit to patient well-being and potential health cost savings...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Dieless bellows forming using local heating {{technique}} is an advanced flexible forming technology to produce bellows from straight tube {{without the use}} of dies. The deformation is induced by applying continuous compression, and local heating. Advantages of these processes are the absence of dies, applicability <b>for</b> various materials, <b>suitability</b> <b>for</b> flexible <b>forming</b> process including low batch production, flexibility on workpiece sizes and output geometries. However, the implementation of these processes is still low owing to the low quality, reproducibility, and production speed. The limitation of these dieless forming processes using local heating is caused by the absence of dies required to form the desired profile. Therefore deformation depends on temperature, length of heating zone, processing speed, speed ratio of feeding to fabrication speeds. In order to enhance the product quality in these dieless forming with local heating, real-time monitoring are necessary to identify deformation progress. Machine vision based on image processing technique was selected to monitor deformation behavior on dieless bellows forming process. The present paper describes real-time monitoring using image processing approach to monitor dimensional profile and temperature distribution during the process. The results show that machine vision is effective and efficient to monitor dynamic deformation of dieless bellows forming proces and able to identify abnormal process condition...|$|R
40|$|Increased {{interest}} {{has been shown}} in recent months regarding the feasibility and potential advantages of a common currency for Canada and the United States. This paper explores the arguments for and against such an arrangement and attempts to determine whether it would offer any significant advantages for Canada compared with the present flexible exchange rate system. The paper first reviews the theoretical arguments advanced in the economics literature in support of fixed and flexible currency arrangements. A discussion of Canada's past experience with the two exchange rate systems follows, after which there is a survey of the empirical evidence published on Canada's current and prospective <b>suitability</b> <b>for</b> some <b>form</b> of fixed currency arrangement with the United States. The final section of the paper examines critically a number of concerns raised about the behaviour of the current flexible exchange rate system. These concerns include its susceptibility to destabilizing speculation; the depressing effect it might have on trade and investment flows; the encouragement it might provide for lax fiscal policies; and the harmful effect it might have on productivity. On the basis of the evidence reviewed in this paper, the author concludes (i) that most of these concerns are either exaggerated or unsubstantiated; and (ii) that a flexible exchange rate continues to offer important advantages for Canada, given the significant differences that distinguish the Canadian and U. S. economies and Canadians’ desire for policy independence. Exchange rates...|$|R

40|$|Minimal or {{inconsistent}} behavioural {{responses to}} command make it challenging to accurately diagnose {{the level of}} awareness of a patient with a Disorder of Consciousness (DOC). By identifying markers of mental imagery being covertly performed to command, functional neuroimaging (fMRI, EEG) has shown {{that some of these}} patients are aware despite their lack of behavioural responsiveness. We report the findings of behavioural, fMRI, and EEG approaches to detecting command-following in a group of patients with DOC. From an initial sample of 14 patients, complete data across all tasks was obtained in six cases. Behavioural evaluations were performed with the Coma Recovery Scale - Revised. Both fMRI and EEG evaluations involved the completion of previously validated mental imagery tasks - i. e., motor imagery (EEG and fMRI) and spatial navigation imagery (fMRI). One patient exhibited statistically significant evidence of motor imagery in both the fMRI and EEG tasks, despite being unable to follow commands behaviourally. Two behaviourally non-responsive patients produced appropriate activation during the spatial navigation fMRI task. However, neither of these patients successfully completed the motor imagery tasks, likely due to specific motor area damage in {{at least one of these}} cases. A further patient demonstrated command following only in the EEG motor imagery task, and two patients did not demonstrate command following in any of the behavioural, EEG, or fMRI assessments. Due to the heterogeneity of aetiology and pathology in this group, DOC patients vary in terms of their <b>suitability</b> <b>for</b> some <b>forms</b> of neuroimaging, the preservation of specific neural structures, and the cognitive resources that may be available to them. Assessments of a range of cognitive abilities supported by spatially-distinct brain regions and indexed by multiple neural signatures are therefore required in order to accurately characterise a patient’s level of residual cognition and awareness...|$|R
