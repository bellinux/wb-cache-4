That effort has included a four-pronged approach: An ambitious approach to lending artworks around the world, working with scholars and academics {{to learn more about}} the artists and their works, the creation of a publications program to provide <b>supporting</b> <b>information</b> about the artists and their work, and building an online forum for the artwork.|$|E
