The average grains size of core drilling - 1 are gravel about 21. 3 %, sand 60. 2 %, silt 5 % and clay about 0. 4 % while core drilling- 2 are  characterized by  44. 3 %, sand 26. 8 %, silt 24. 6 % and clay about 0. 6 %. These result shows that at location of Core drilling - 1 is dominated by sand where as at location of Core drilling - 2 is dominated by gravel. These situation can be interpreted that the sediment at core drilling - 2 location have influenced by strong marine current which can transport the large amount of gravel size compare to the location of Core drilling- 1 which is dominated by sand.

The challenges presented by electronic resources add complexities which make us nostalgic for the simplicity of print. Medical librarians are charged with spending their scarce budgetary resources wisely {{to provide access to}} high quality, urgently needed content. Collection development decisions are driven by many factors. Price is just one. The challenge of finding the budgetary resources to meet continuing price increases will be demonstrated in this presentation by historical price lines for a <b>sample</b> <b>of</b> <b>core</b> clinical journals in medicine and nursing. The challenge for librarians who must now track changing pricing models, license terms, and hundreds of other data elements has been answered in part by electronic resource management systems (ERMs). Once a library purchases an ERM system, the next challenge is populating and maintaining the massive amounts of data associated with electronic resources. Without the data, an ERM system is just an expensive online filing cabinet. The trend now is toward automating the transfer of essential data between systems to ease the burden of manual data entry and improve accuracy.

DESIGN: An ethnographic study involving: Field observations: 40 hours, over 4 weeks, daily activities, 7 interprofessional meetings, 3 care planning meetings, 1 business meeting, and 3 family meetings; Individual observations: a physiotherapist, an occupational therapist, and a social worker individually observed for 45 minutes to an hour; and Interviews: 19 participants, 11 professions, 27 informal, 5 formal interviews. Data analysis consisted of an iterative process involving coding field notes for themes by 3 members {{of the research team}} by qualitative analysis software. SETTING: Single inpatient spinal cord rehabilitation care unit in a Canadian urban academic rehabilitation hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Purposive convenience <b>sample</b> <b>of</b> <b>core</b> team, more than 40 professionals: physiatrist, over 21 nurses, 3 physiotherapists, 3 occupational therapists, 2 social workers, chaplain, psychologist, therapeutic recreationist, program assistant, program manager, pharmacist, advanced practice leader, 6 students (1 pharmacy, 4 registered nurse, and 1 psychology), and on-site community organizations.

40|$|I use {{photometry}} and spectroscopy {{data for}} 24 Type II plateau supernovae {{to examine their}} observed and physical properties. This dataset shows that these objects encompass {{a wide range of}} ~ 5 mag in their plateau luminosities, their expansion velocities vary by x 5, and the nickel masses produced in these explosions go from 0. 0016 to 0. 26 Mo. From a subset of 16 objects I find that the explosion energies vary between 0. 6 x and 5. 5 x 10 ^ 51 ergs, the ejected masses encompass the range 14 - 56 Mo, and the progenitors' radii go from 80 to 600 Ro. Despite this great diversity several regularities emerge, which reveal that there is a continuum in the properties of these objects from the faint, low-energy, nickel-poor SNe 1997 D and 1999 br, to the bright, high-energy, nickel-rich SN 1992 am. This study provides evidence that more massive progenitors produce more energetic explosions, thus suggesting that the outcome of the core collapse is somewhat determined by the envelope mass. I find also that supernovae with greater energies produce more nickel. Similar relationships appear to hold for Type Ib/c supernovae, which suggests that both Type II and Type Ib/c supernovae share the same core physics. When the whole <b>sample</b> <b>of</b> <b>core</b> collapse objects is considered, there is a continous distribution of energies below 8 x 10 ^ 51 ergs.

Texas state accountability standards {{are a result of}} the No Child Left Behind Act of 2011 (NCLB). Texas state law requires schools to design a reconstitution plan after the second year of receiving an academically unacceptable school rating for failing to meet the required standards on state assessments, dropout rates, and graduation rates. The plan must be implemented by the third year. A mixed methods approach was used to uncover the strategies that were successful during the restructuring initiative. Data was obtained from three sources: interviews, document analysis and surveys. Interviews were conducted with district administrators, campus based administrators and teachers of the three high schools. A <b>sample</b> <b>of</b> <b>core</b> content teachers were surveyed using questions from the MetLife Survey of the American Teacher: Collaborating for Student Success. Results revealed that each school chose to engage in a major form of restructuring that included the formation of a themed based magnet school. A team approach was used to devise, implement, and monitor the reconstitution plan. Common strategies unveiled in the study included the use of common assessments, collaborative planning among core teachers, professional development, continuous monitoring of student absences, extended learning times for students, and a focus on college readiness. Survey data revealed that the majority of teachers believed that collaboration positively impacted student achievement. It is recommended that schools undergoing restructuring choose a reconstitution option that allows for flexibility, use multiple resources to foster school improvement, and develop restructuring plans that serve as living documents. Further research is needed to study the principal's role in achieving an academically acceptable rating.

40|$|Nettilling Lake {{is located}} on Baffin Island, Nunavut, Canada between the areas of past warming (Canadian High Arctic to the North) and climatic {{stability}} (Northern Quebec and Labrador region to the South). Despite being the largest lake in the Nunavut region with a postglacial marine to lacustrine transition history only a few paleo-environmental investigations were completed in this area. The oxygen isotope composition of diatoms (d 18 O diatom) can provide valuable insights into paleo-environmental conditions. Here, the recent (isotope) hydrology and hydrochemical data from the lake are presented to facilitate the interpretation of a d 18 O diatom record from an 82 cm sediment core (Ni- 2 B). The well-mixed lake (d 18 O water = - 17. 4 ‰) is influenced by a heavier (less negative) isotope composition (- 18. 80 ‰) from Amadjuak River draining Amadjuak Lake to the South and water of lighter (more negative) isotopic composition (- 16. 4 ‰) from the Isurtuq River originating from Penny Ice Cap in the North-East. From the d 18 O water and d 18 O diatom of the topmost <b>sample</b> <b>of</b> <b>core</b> Ni- 2 B a D 18 O silica-water of 1000 ln alpha(silica-water) = 40. 2 ‰ for sub-recent diatoms of Nettilling Lake was calculated matching the known water-silica fractionation for fossil sediments well and thereby showing the general applicability of this proxy for paleo-reconstructions in this region. Extremely large d 18 O diatom variations {{in the core of}} more than 13 ‰ are mainly induced by changes in the isotopic composition of the lake water due to a shift from glaciomarine (d 18 O diatom = + 34. 6 ‰) through brackish (+ 23. 4 to + 27. 2 ‰) towards lacustrine (+ 21. 5 ‰) conditions (transition zones glaciomarine to brackish at 69 cm/ 7300 yr cal. BP and brackish to lacustrine at 35 cm/ 6000 yr cal. BP) associated with a shift in the degree of salinity. Our study provides the first evidence that paleo-salinity can be reconstructed by d 18 O diatom. Additionally, for the lacustrine section it could be demonstrated that d 18 O diatom may serve as a proxy for past air temperature within the same core recording a late Holocene cooling of about 4 °C being consistent with other published values for the greater Baffin region...|$|E

The cores were discovered by comparing {{images of the}} fields containing candidate High-Mass Protostellar Objects (HMPOs) at 1. 2 mm and mid-infrared (8. 3 µm; MIR) wavelengths. While the HMPOs are detected at both wavelengths, several cores emitting at 1. 2 mm in the same fields show absorption or no emission at the MIR wavelength. We argue that the absorption is caused by cold dust. The estimated masses of a few 10 2 M ⊙- 10 3 M ⊙ {{and the lack of}} IR emission suggests that they may be massive cold cores in a pre-stellar phase, which could presumably form massive stars eventually.

40|$|We present new {{photometric}} {{observations of}} Supernova (SN) 2003 ie starting {{one month before}} discovery, obtained serendipitously while observing its host galaxy. With only a weak upper limit derived on the mass of its progenitor (< 25 M_sun) from pre-explosion studies, this event could be a potential exception to the "red supergiant (RSG) problem" (the lack of high mass RSGs exploding as Type IIP supernovae). However, this is true only if SN 2003 ie was a Type IP event, something which has never been determined. Using recently derived core collapse SN light curve templates, {{as well as by}} comparison to other known SNe, we find that SN 2003 ie was indeed a likely Type IIP event. However, it is found {{to be a member of}} the faint Type IIP class. Previous members of this class have been shown to arise from relatively low mass progenitors (< 12 M_sun). It therefore seems unlikely that this SN had a massive RSG progenitor. The use <b>of</b> <b>core</b> collapse SN light curve templates is shown to be helpful in classifying SNe with sparse coverage. These templates are likely to become more robust as large homogeneous <b>samples</b> <b>of</b> <b>core</b> collapse events are collected. Comment: Submitted to A...|$|R
40|$|Although the {{standard}} model of star formation has served us well for over 20 years, its details are still a matter of debate. In particular, questions related {{to the effect of}} environment on star formation efficiency and the relative and absolute lifetimes of the different evolutionary phases are best answered by observations <b>of</b> large <b>samples</b> <b>of</b> <b>cores.</b> Such observations are only now becoming available, thanks to an impressive suite of new instruments that allow mapping studies in a reasonable time. Essential information such as whether cores are gravitationally bound or unbound, whether they are dominated by thermal or turbulent motions, and whether they are contracting or collapsing, or expanding, can only be obtained through molecular line observations. Isolated cores are the best places in which to study the star formation process, due to their simple nature and freedom from the confusing effects of crowded regions. We propose to map in N 2 H+, CS, and C 18 O, 40 cores that we have observed in the MIR and mm continuum. When combined with our existing data on 90 cores that probe different evolutionary stages, these data will provide the most complete, unbiased view <b>of</b> <b>core</b> evolution and the initial conditions for star formation...|$|R
