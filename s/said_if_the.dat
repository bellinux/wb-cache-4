Frankfurter {{pointed out that}} during oral argument before the Supreme Court, the federal government claimed that the district court had misread and misinterpreted its claims.

However, that was not the admission of the government, federal attorneys <b>said.</b> <b>If</b> <b>the</b> court had misinterpreted the government's position, Frankfurter concluded, the case should be remanded for further proceedings rather than adjudicated. However, since a majority has seen fit to grant certiorari, Frankfurter reluctantly agreed to concur in the majority opinion.|$|E

[...] In its original American broadcast on January 27, 1994, [...] "A Many Splendored Thing" [...] was watched by 11.2 million households, according to Nielsen Media Research, earning the episode an 11.9 rating. That constituted a slight increase from the previous week's episode, [...] "Black and Blue", which was seen by 10.83 million households. It was the 37th highest rated television show of the week, tied with the Fox animated comedy series The Simpsons.

500|$|The Tales of the Black Freighter DVD also {{includes}} Under the Hood, a fictional in-universe documentary detailing the characters' backstories, which takes its title {{from that of}} Hollis Mason's memoirs in the comic book. Under the Hood is rated PG because {{it is meant to}} resemble a behind-the-scenes television news magazine profile of the characters. The actors were allowed to improvise during filming interviews in character. Bolex cameras were even used to film [...] "archive" [...] footage of the Minutemen. The film itself was scheduled to be released on DVD four months after Tales of the Black Freighter, and Warner released a director's cut on July 21, 2009, and the extended version with the animated film edited back into the main picture was scheduled to be released on November 3, 2009, but did not hit the shelves until November 10, 2009.

500|$|On December 24, Khánh {{issued a}} {{declaration}} of independence from [...] "foreign manipulation", and condemned [...] "colonialism", explicitly accusing Taylor of abusing his power. At the time, Khánh was also secretly negotiating with the communists, hoping {{to put together a}} peace deal so he could expel the Americans from Vietnam, although this effort did not lead anywhere in the two months before he was forced out of power. For his part, Taylor privately told Americans journalists that Khánh was expressing opposition to the US merely because he knew he had lost Washington's confidence. Taylor said Khánh was completely unprincipled and was stirring up anti-American sentiment purely to try to shore up his political prospects, not because he thought US policy was harmful to South Vietnam. The US media were generally very critical of Khánh's actions and did not blame Taylor for the disharmony. Peter Grose of The New York Times said [...] "It almost seems as if Viet Cong insurgents and the Saigon government conspired to make the United States feel unwelcome." [...] The Chicago Tribune lampooned Khánh's junta, calling it a [...] "parody of a government" [...] and saying it would not survive for a week without US support and describing the generals as [...] "remittance men on the United States' payroll". However, the New York Herald Tribune said it was dangerous to pressure South Vietnam too much, citing the instability that followed the American support for the coup against Diệm, who had resisted US advice so often. It said [...] "The issue is not General Khánh versus General Taylor. It is whether the Vietnamese still have the will to exist as an independent state." [...] The newspaper <b>said</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> answer was yes, then both Washington and Saigon would have to look beyond personalities.|$|E

2500|$|The {{character}} of Pete lasted {{in the show}} for eight years, and was eventually written out in 1993 when the writers felt that the character {{had come to a}} natural end. There was initially talk of Pete getting back together with his ex-wife Kathy, but it was felt {{that it would have been}} a retrogressive step, and it was dismissed. The character was killed off-screen in December 1993 and brought back to Walford to be buried. The press reported at the time that Pete was killed-off because he spoke negatively about EastEnders in the press following his axing. There was also speculation that he had not got along with Gillian Taylforth, who played his ex-wife Kathy. Dean commented, [...] "When they wrote me out of EastEnders, they said they had run out of storylines.

2500|$|In mid-1968, Powell's book The House of Lords in the Middle Ages was {{published}} after twenty years' work. At {{the press conference}} for its publication, Powell <b>said</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> government introduced a Bill to reform the Lords he would be its [...] "resolute enemy". Later in 1968, when the Labour government published its Bills for the new session, Powell was angry at Heath's acceptance of the plan drawn up by the Conservative Iain Macleod and Labour's Richard Crossman to reform the Lords, titled the Parliament (No. 2) Bill. Crossman, opening the debate on 19 November, said the government would reform the Lords in five ways: removing the voting rights of hereditary peers; making sure no party had a permanent majority; ensuring {{the government of the}} day usually passed its laws; weakening the Lords' powers to delay new laws; and abolishing the power to refuse subordinate legislation if it had been passed by the Commons. Powell spoke in the debate, opposing these plans. He said the reforms were [...] "unnecessary and undesirable" [...] {{and that there was no}} weight in the claim that the Lords could [...] "check or frustrate the firm intentions" [...] of the Commons. He claimed that only election or nomination could replace the hereditary nature of the Lords. If they were elected it would pose the dilemma of which House was truly representative of the electorate. He also had another objection: [...] "How can the same electorate be represented in two ways so that the two sets of representatives can conflict and disagree with one another?" [...] Those nominated would be bound to the Chief Whip of their party through a sort of oath and Powell asked [...] "what sort of men and women are they to be who would submit to be nominated to another chamber upon condition that they will be mere dummies, automatic parts of a voting machine?" [...] He also stated that the inclusion in the proposals of thirty crossbenchers was [...] "a grand absurdity", because they would have been chosen [...] "upon the very basis that they have no strong views of principle on the way in which the country ought to be governed". Powell claimed the Lords derived their authority not from a strict hereditary system but from its prescriptive nature: [...] "It has long been so, and it works". He then added that there was not any widespread desire for reform: he indicated a recent survey of working-class voters that showed that only a third of them wanted to reform or abolish the Lords, with another third believing the Lords were an [...] "intrinsic part of the national traditions of Britain". Powell deduced from this, [...] "As so often, the ordinary rank and file of the electorate have seen a truth, an important fact, which has escaped so many more clever people—the underlying value of that which is traditional, that which is prescriptive".|$|E
