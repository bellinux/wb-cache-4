40|$|Seat belt {{anchorage}} locations have {{a strong}} effect on occupant protection. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) 210 specifies requirements for {{the layout of the}} anchorages relative to the seating reference point and <b>seat</b> <b>back</b> <b>angle</b> established by the SAE J 826 H-point manikin. Sled testing and computational simulation has established that belt anchorage locations {{have a strong}} effect on occupant kinematics, particularly for child occupants using the belt as their primary restraint. As part of a larger study of vehicle geometry, the locations of the anchorage points in the second-row, outboard seating positions of 83 passenger cars and light trucks with a median model year of 2005 were measured. The lower anchorage locations spanned the entire range of lap belt angles permissible under FMVSS 210 and the upper anchorages (D-ring locations) were distributed widely as well. Combined with the findings from concurrent research on the effects of belt geometry, these results suggest that occupant kinematics in frontal impact can be expected to differ widely across vehicles due to differences in belt geometry...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a mechanism for}} standing and sitting transformation of a wheelchair using a two-wheeled inverted pendulum concept with reduced torque requirement, in simulation studies. The motivation of this work is to design a compact standing mechanism to help an elderly/disabled person with functional limitation in lower extremities to maneuver in small and confined spaces and enable them to perform standard daily life routines independently. The wheelchair system at the upright standing position is tested with different travel distances, and {{the challenge is to}} control both sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit operations in a stable manner using flexible-joint humanoid. An additional spring/damping element is incorporated at each wheel to provide a comfortable ride for the user especially during stand-to-sit transformation task. A PD-fuzzy control with modular structure is implemented, and the performance of the system is observed through visual nastran 4 d (vn 4 d) visualization software and simulation in matlab. The stand-to-sit performance tests have shown more than 38 % reduction in tilt and <b>back</b> <b>seat</b> <b>angles</b> fluctuation in linear travel motion using a suspension system, while the initial tilt torque needed is 50 % less than the amount required in previous designs...|$|R
40|$|A {{new type}} of car seat has been {{designed}} in which the back-rest is able to move freely in the vertical direction. The design allows the back-rest to follow the vertical vibration {{of the back of}} an occupant of the seat. This is intended to decrease any strain on the lumbar part of the spinal column caused by a different vertical motion at the seat squab and the <b>seat</b> <b>back.</b> The transmission of vertical (z axis) vibration from the base of this seat to the seat surface, to the back-rest and to the backs and heads of seat occupants has been measured. Measurements were made with the <b>seat</b> <b>back</b> fixed, to prevent vertical motion relative to the seat frame, and with the <b>seat</b> <b>back</b> free to move. Vibration transmissibilities from the seat base to the seat surface were characterized by a resonance at frequencies in the region of 4 Hz. The resonance frequencies were slightly higher with the fixed back-rest than with the moving back-rest. The transmissibilities at frequencies above 4 Hz -were generally higher with the fixed back-rest. Measurements with no contact between the seat occupants and the <b>seat</b> <b>back</b> indicated that the dynamic properties of the human body and the seat cushion were less influenced by the moving <b>seat</b> <b>back</b> than by the fixed <b>seat</b> <b>back.</b> Differential motion between the seat surface and <b>seat</b> <b>back</b> was smaller with the moving <b>seat</b> <b>back</b> than with the fixed back.

5000|$|In 1936, Nash {{introduced}} the [...] "Bed-In-A-Car" [...] feature, which allowed the car's interior {{to be converted}} into a sleeping compartment. The rear <b>seat</b> <b>back</b> hinged up, allowing the rear seat cushion to be propped up into a level position. This also created an opening between the passenger compartment and the trunk. Two adults could sleep in the car, with their legs and feet in the trunk, and their heads and shoulders on the rear seat cushions. In 1949 this arrangement was modified so that fully reclining front <b>seat</b> <b>backs</b> created a sleeping area entirely within the passenger compartment.

40|$|A {{laboratory}} {{study was conducted}} to quantify the effects of belt-positioning boosters on lap and shoulder belt fit. Postures and belt fit were measured for forty-four boys and girls ages 5 to 12 in four highback boosters, one backless booster, and on a vehicle seat without a booster. Belt anchorage locations were varied over a wide range. Seat cushion angle, <b>seat</b> <b>back</b> <b>angle,</b> and seat cushion length were varied in the no-booster conditions. All boosters produced better mean lap belt fit than was observed in the no-booster condition, but the differences among boosters were relatively large. With one midrange belt configuration, the lap belt was not fully below the anterior-superior iliac spine (ASIS) landmark {{on the front of the}} pelvis for 89 % of children in one booster, and 75 % of children failed to achieve that level of belt fit in another. In contrast, the lap belt was fully below the ASIS for all but two children in the best-performing booster. Child body size had a statistically significant but relatively small effect on lap belt fit. The largest children sitting without a booster had approximately the same lap belt fit as the smallest children experienced in the worst-performing booster. Increasing lap belt angle relative to horizontal produced significantly better lap belt fit in the no-booster condition, but the boosters isolated the children from the effects of lap belt angles. Reducing seat cushion length in the no-booster condition improved lap belt fit but changing cushion angle did not. Belt upper anchorage (D-ring) location had a strong effect on shoulder belt fit in conditions without shoulder belt routing from the booster. Unexpectedly, the worst average shoulder belt fit was observed in one highback booster with a poorly positioned shoulder belt routing clip. The shoulder belt was routed more outboard, on average, with a backless booster than without a booster, but raising the child also amplified the effect of D-ring location, such that children were more likely to experience poor shoulder belt fit due to outboard and forward D-ring locations when sitting on the booster. Taller children experienced more-outboard shoulder belt fit in conditions without shoulder belt routing by the booster and in the one booster with poor shoulder belt routing. Adjustable shoulder belt routing on three of the highback boosters effectively eliminated stature effects, providing approximately the same shoulder belt fit for all children. <b>Seat</b> <b>back</b> <b>angle</b> did not have a significant effect on shoulder belt fit. The belt fit was measured in each test condition using the 6 YO and 10 YO Hybrid-III ATDs. ATD belt fit was strongly correlated with child belt fit across test conditions, but offsets between the ATD and child belt fit scores were observed due to anatomical and postural differences between the ATDs and children. The results of this study have broad applicability toward the improvement of occupant restraints for children. The data show substantial effects of booster design on belt fit, particularly the effects of alternative lap and torso belt routing approaches. Regression analyses quantify the critical importance of belt anchorage location for child belt fit, providing an important foundation for efforts to optimize belt geometry for children. The strong correlation between ATD and child belt fit scores means that ATD-based measurements can reliably be used to assess booster and vehicle designs with respect to child belt fit...|$|E
40|$|Obesity {{has been}} shown to {{increase}} the risk of some types of injury in crashes. One hypothesis is that obesity adversely effects belt fit by changing the routing of the belt relative to the underlying skeletal structures. To evaluate this hypothesis, belt fit was measured in a laboratory study of 54 men and women, 48 percent of whom were obese, with a body mass index (BMI) of 30 kg/m 2 or greater. Test conditions included a wide range of upper and lower belt anchorage locations and ranges of seat height, seat cushion angle, and <b>seat</b> <b>back</b> <b>angle</b> spanning a large fraction of current vehicle front and rear seats. In some conditions, foot position was restricted to simulate the typical situation in the second row of a small sedan. Across individuals, an increase in BMI of 10 -kg/m 2 was associated with a lap belt positioned 43 mm further forward and 21 mm higher relative to the anterior-superior iliac spines of the pelvis. Each 10 -kg/m 2 increase in BMI was associated with an increase in lap belt webbing length of 130 mm. The worsening of lap belt fit with restricted foot position was slightly greater for obese participants. Obesity was associated with a more-inboard shoulder belt routing across a wide range of upper belt anchorage locations, and the shoulder belt webbing length between the D-ring and latchplate increased by an average of 60 mm with each 10 -kg/m 2 increase in BMI. The results suggest that obesity effectively introduces slack in the seat belt system by routing the belt further away from the skeleton. Particularly in frontal crashes, but also in rollovers and other scenarios, this slack will result in increased excursions and an increased likelihood and severity of contacts with the interior. The higher routing of the lap belt with respect to the pelvis also increases the likelihood of submarining in frontal crashes...|$|E
40|$|Dates covered (From - To) September 2011 - October 2013 Final ReportDesigning {{vehicles}} {{for the safety}} and comfort of occupants requires detailed information on posture, position, and body shape. This report presents the methods and results of a study of soldiers as drivers and passengers in vehicle seats. A total of 257 male and 53 female soldiers were measured at three Army posts while minimally clad, wearing the Advanced Combat Uniform (ACU), {{with the addition of}} personal protective equipment (PPE), composed of the Improved Outer Tactical Vest (IOTV) and Advanced Combat Helmet (ACH), and with encumbrance (ENC) simulating the gear of either a rifleman or SAW-gunner. Standard anthropometric data, such as stature and body weight, were recorded. Participants were measured as either drivers or crew. Five driver workstation configurations (packages) were produced in a vehicle mockup by varying the steering wheel position relative to the pedals. The participants adjusted the seat to obtain a comfortable driving posture. The three-dimensional locations of body landmarks were measured using a FARO Arm coordinate digitizer. In the crew conditions, the experimenters varied the seat height and back angle and conditions included a simulated protective footrest. A whole-body laser scanner was used to record body shape at each garb level. A statistical analysis of the body landmark data was conducted to obtain models to predict soldier posture as a function of vehicle factors, such as seat height, and soldier attributes, such as stature, and garb level (ACU, PPE, or ENC). Driver posture was strongly affected by steering wheel position and crew posture by <b>seat</b> <b>back</b> <b>angle.</b> Adding PPE and ENC resulted in more-upright postures, but the effects on spine posture were small. Statistical models of both seated and standing body shape were developed from the scan data, including the effects of PPE and ENC on space claim. The effects of ENC on space claim were largely independent of body size. The results of this study have broad applicability for the design and assessment of military vehicles.

40|$|Background: The latest {{generation}} of rear-end whiplash protection systems, {{as found in}} the WHIPS Volvo and SAHR Saab, have reduced injury rates by almost 50 % {{in comparison with the}} previous generation of seat/head restraint systems. Occupant behaviour, such as seated posture and seat adjustment settings, may affect the injury risk. Method: Five studies were conducted. Studie I was an injury outcome study based on insurance data. Studies II-IV investigated seat adjustment, occupant backset, and cervical retraction for drivers and occupants in different postures and positions in the car, during stationary and driving conditions. Study V compared the occupant data from studies II and III with a vehicle testing tool, the BioRID dummy, using the protocols of the ISO, RCAR, and the RCAR-IIWPG. Results: Female drivers and passengers had a threefold increased risk for medically-impairing neck injury in rear-end impacts, compared to males. Driver position had a double risk compared with front passenger seat position. Female drivers adjusted the driver seat differently to male drivers; they sat higher and closer to the steering wheel and with more upright back support. The volunteers also adjusted their seat differently to the ISO, RCAR, and RCAR-IIWPG protocol settings; both sexes sat further away from the steering wheel, and <b>seat</b> <b>back</b> <b>angle</b> was more upright then in the protocols. In stationary cars, backset was highest in the rear seat position and lowest in the front passenger seat position. Males had a larger backset than females. Cervical retraction decreased and backset increased for both sexes when posture changed from self-selected posture to a slouched posture. The BioRID II dummy was found to represent 96 th percentile female in stature, and a 69 th percentile female in weight in the volunteer group. Conclusions: Risks in car rear-end impacts differ by sex and seated position. This thesis indicates the need for a 50 th percentile female BioRID dummy and re-evaluation of the ISO, RCAR, and RCAR-IIWPG protocols, and further development of new safety systems to protect occupants in rear-end impacts...|$|E
40|$|The Adaptive Paddling Program at California Polytechnic State University has {{sponsored}} {{the construction of}} an adaptive kayak seat, the Tide Rider 360, to provide paddlers with disabilities sufficient trunk support while out on the water. In particular, this design focused on providing the least restrictive environment for all users while still providing sufficient lateral, neck, back, and hip support. This seat is intended for use in the quarterly Adaptive Paddling Program to allow people with disabilities to experience the joys of kayaking in the most comfortable and supportive environment possible. The following report details the background research, design development, manufacturing, and testing processes that went into designing this seat. It provides in-depth breakdowns on aspects such as the concept generation and material selection methods in order to prove that this kayak seat meets the requirements of the Adaptive Paddling Program. In particular, this seat was designed for use in marine environments with maximum levels of adjustability, support, and comfort. It was designed to fit to all different types of people in terms of weight, disability, and paddling ability. This kayak seat was manufactured out of aluminum tubing and joints, high density polyethylene sheets, and polyethylene foam. In addition to these materials, we added pre-manufactured wheelchair support components for the lateral supports, headrest, hip supports, and seat base. The total cost for the manufacturing of this prototype came out to be approximately $ 2100 and the final weight was just around 30 pounds. We conducted multiple levels of testing on the kayak seat, including a load test and in-pool assessment. Our load testing proved that the aluminum seat frame experiences minimal deflection and bending when subjected to a constant weight {{for an extended period of}} time. The in-pool testing verified that the seat is able to support a paddler while still allowing them a wide range of motion, if so desired. The prototype as is does have a few shortcomings, such as some hard to reach adjustment bolts, but the Adaptive Paddling Program still feels confident in the ability of this seat and the fulfillment of the preset requirements. We believe that with a few slight modifications to the <b>seat</b> <b>back</b> <b>angle</b> and some additional reach of the supports, this product would be able to change the lives of the participants in the Adaptive Paddling Program...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2006. This study {{tested the}} {{following}} hypotheses: (1) Wheelchair configuration changes will change seated postural alignment, (2) Health outcome measures will improve after postural change and (3) Successful seating interventions are possible via a distance medicine model. Prospective repeated measures design with subjects randomized at enrollment to either in-person intervention by the investigator or teleconsultation mediated intervention. Data were collected at baseline, post intervention and 3 -months. Outcome Measures: Seated Height (SH), Wheelchair Users Shoulder Pain Index (WUSPI), Postural Scale for Wheelchair Users (PSWU), Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS) *, Pain Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and Pain Interference (*baseline and 3 months only). The primary comparison was between pre and post intervention {{scores on the}} outcome measures (within subject analysis) examining {{the effect of the}} intervention. The between group comparison explored the effectiveness of the teleconsultation intervention in relation to the gold standard of a hands-on clinic. A convenience sample of 13 subjects was enrolled across two investigative sites with analysis on 11 subjects who completed the study. Inclusion: SCI with ASIA Impairment Scale scores of A or B, motor level T 1 -T 10 inclusive, age 18 or greater, one year or more post SCI, with non-specific musculoskeletal pain or discomfort in their wheelchair, who are full-time users of manual wheelchairs. Intervention: custom specified wheelchair configuration change; generally decreasing inside <b>seat</b> to <b>back</b> <b>angle</b> via changes to seat plane or backrest alignment. Post intervention results: Increase in SH (postural alignment) was significant (p=. 03), mean change of 1. 01 inches; 95 % confidence interval 0. 13 to 1. 9. Mean improvement (- 9. 6) on the WUSPI was significant (p=. 03); 95 % confidence interval - 18. 34 to - 0. 87. Decrease in worst pain intensity (- 1. 18) was significant (p=. 04); 95 % confidence interval - 2. 3 to - 0. 4. Remaining outcomes did not show significant change post intervention. The intervention effect was not maintained at 3 -month follow up (n= 9). Clinical Relevance. Wheelchair configuration can alter seated posture, and improved postural alignment appears to improve health outcomes as measured by the WUSPI and Pain VAS. Feasibility of successful postural intervention via teleconsultation was supported by this preliminary study. Further work is needed on maintenance of the intervention effect...|$|R
