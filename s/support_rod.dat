2500|$|This {{starting}} material is finely powdered, {{and placed in}} a container within a Verneuil furnace, with an opening at the bottom through which the powder can escape when the container is vibrated. While the powder is being released, oxygen is supplied into the furnace, and travels with the powder down a narrow tube. This tube is located within a larger tube, into which hydrogen is supplied. At the point where the narrow tube opens into the larger one, combustion occurs, with a flame of at least [...] at its core. As the powder passes through the flame, it melts into small droplets, which fall onto an earthen <b>support</b> <b>rod</b> placed below. The droplets gradually form a sinter cone on the rod, the tip of which is close enough to the core to remain liquid. It is at that tip that the seed crystal eventually forms. As more droplets fall onto the tip, a single crystal, called a boule, starts to form, and the support is slowly moved downward, allowing the base of the boule to crystallise, while its cap always remains liquid. The boule is formed {{in the shape of a}} tapered cylinder, with a diameter broadening away from the base and eventually remaining more or less constant. With a constant supply of powder and withdrawal of the support, very long cylindrical boules can be obtained. Once removed from the furnace and allowed to cool, the boule is split along its vertical axis to relieve internal pressure, otherwise the crystal will be prone to fracture when the stalk is broken due to a vertical parting plane.|$|E

40|$|An {{apparatus}} for rejecting {{waste heat}} from a system located {{on or near}} the lunar equator is presented. The system utilizes a reflective catenary shaped trough deployed about a vertical radiator to shade the radiator from heat emitted by the hot lunar surface. The catenary shaped trough is constructed from a film material and is aligned relative to the sun so that incoming solar energy is focused to a line just above the vertical radiator and can thereby isolate the radiator from the effects of direct sunlight. The film is in a collapsed position between side by side <b>support</b> <b>rods,</b> all of which are in a transport case. To deploy the film and <b>support</b> <b>rods,</b> a set of parallel tracks running perpendicular to length of the <b>support</b> <b>rods</b> are extended out from the transport case. After the support tracks are deployed, the <b>support</b> <b>rods</b> are positioned equidistant from each other {{along the length of the}} support tracks so that the flexible film shade between adjacent <b>support</b> <b>rods</b> is unfolded and hangs in a catenary shaped trough. A heat radiator is supported between each pair of <b>support</b> <b>rods</b> above each hanging reflective trough...|$|R

50|$|The POCIS sampler {{consists}} of an array of sampling disks mounted on a <b>support</b> <b>rod.</b> Each disk {{consists of}} a solid sorbent sandwiched between two polyethersoulfone (PES) microporous membranes which are then compressed between two stainless steel rings which expose a sampling area. A standard POCIS disk consists of a sampling surface area to sorbent mass ratio of approximately 180 cm2g. Because the amount of chemical sampled {{is directly related to}} the sample surface area, it is sometimes necessary to combine extracts from multiple POCIS disks into one sample. Stainless steel rings, or other rigid inert material, are essential to prevent sorbent loss as the PES membranes are not able to be heat sealed. The POCIS array is then inserted and deployed within a protective canister. This canister is usually made of stainless steel or PVC and works to deflect debris that may displace the POCIS array during its deployment.|$|E
50|$|The {{purposes}} of the sample assembly (Fig. 2) are to transmit hydrostatic pressure to the sample from the compressing piston, to provide controlled heating of the sample and to provide, via the capsule, a suitable volatile and oxygen fugacity environment for the experiment. Therefore, it includes a component {{for each of these}} purposes.The outer cylinder is a pressure transmitting, electrically insulating cylinder made from NaCl, talc, BaCO3, KBr, CaF2, or even borosilicate glass. The next components are, in order, an electrically insulating borosilicate glass cylinder and a graphite cylinder, which acts as the “furnace”. To locate the sample exactly in the centre of the furnace and to grip the thermocouple, a <b>support</b> <b>rod</b> usually made of crushable ceramics is used. The final component is a conductive steel base plug, located {{at the top of the}} sample assembly.The final part of the assembly is the thermocouple itself, whose wires are insulated from one another and from the material of the assembly by a tube made of mullite.|$|E

Without these rods and for this particular technology, these disturbances remain unavoidable under the joint actions of bad weather, of the sun and of moisture intake by the material. The use of the <b>supporting</b> <b>rods</b> creates another issue: the notable difference of the expansion coefficient of both raw materials (a 3.5 factor between hybrid wood and metal) creates frequent disturbances, even when installation has been carefully made. For a horizontal installation, the stagnation of condensation waters between composite and metal decreases the durability of the installation.|$|R

40|$|The helical slow-wave circuit embodies a {{helical coil}} of {{rectangular}} tape supported {{in a metal}} barrel by dielectric support rods. Although the helix slow-wave circuit remains the mainstay of the traveling-wave tube (TWT) industry because of its exceptionally wide bandwidth, a full helical circuit, without significant dimensional approximations, has not been successfully modeled until now. Numerous {{attempts have been made}} to analyze the helical slow-wave circuit so that the performance could be accurately predicted without actually building it, but because of its complex geometry, many geometrical approximations became necessary rendering the previous models inaccurate. In the course of this research it has been demonstrated that using the simulation code, MAFIA, the helical structure can be modeled with actual tape width and thickness, dielectric <b>support</b> <b>rod</b> geometry and materials. To demonstrate the accuracy of the MAFIA model, the cold-test parameters including dispersion, on-axis interaction impedance and attenuation have been calculated for several helical TWT slow-wave circuits with a variety of <b>support</b> <b>rod</b> geometries including rectangular and T-shaped rods, as well as various <b>support</b> <b>rod</b> materials including isotropic, anisotropic and partially metal coated dielectrics. Compared with experimentally measured results, the agreement is excellent. With the accuracy of the MAFIA helical model validated, the code was used to investigate several conventional geometric approximations in an attempt to obtain the most computationally efficient model. Several simplifications were made to a standard model including replacing the helical tape with filaments, and replacing rectangular support rods with shapes conforming to the cylindrical coordinate system with effective permittivity. The approximate models are compared with the standard model in terms of cold-test characteristics and computational time. The model was also used to determine the sensitivity of various circuit parameters including typical manufacturing dimensional tolerances and <b>support</b> <b>rod</b> permittivity. By varying the circuit parameters of an accurate model using MAFIA, these sensitivities can be computed for manufacturing concerns, and design optimization previous to fabrication, thus eliminating the need for costly experimental iterations. Several variations were made to a standard helical circuit using MAFIA to investigate the effect that variations on helical tape and <b>support</b> <b>rod</b> width, metallized loading height and <b>support</b> <b>rod</b> permittivity, have on TWT cold-test characteristics...|$|E

40|$|The {{problem of}} free {{vibration}} of a uniform beam elastically interconnected to a cantilevered beam, representing an idealized launch vehicle aeroelastic model in a wind tunnel, is studied. With elementary beam theory modelling, numerical results are {{obtained for the}} frequencies, mode shapes and the generalized modal mass of this elastically cou pled 13; system, {{for a range of}} values of the spring constants and cantilevered beam stiffness and inertia values. The study shows that when the linear springs are supported at the nodal points corresponding to the first free-free beam mode, the modal interaction comes primarily from the rotational spring stiffness. The effect of the linear spring stiffness on the higher model modes is also found to be marginal. However, the rotational stiffness has a significant effect on all the predominantly model modes as it couples the model 13; deformations and the <b>support</b> <b>rod</b> deformations. The study also shows that though the variations in the stiffness or the inertia values of the cantilever beam affect only the 13; predominantly cantilever modes, these variations become important {{because of the fact that}} the cantilevered <b>support</b> <b>rod</b> frequencies may come close to, or even cross over, the 13; predominantly model mode frequencies. The results also bring out the fact that shifting of the support points away from the first mode nodal points has a maximum effect only on the first model mode...|$|E
