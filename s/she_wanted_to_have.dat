In 2008, she celebrated the 40th anniversary of her professional debut on the West End stage debut. Paige has never married nor had children, although she had an 11-year affair with the lyricist Tim Rice throughout the 1980s.

500|$|Gaga {{spoke to}} Whitney Pastorek of Entertainment Weekly during a [...] "Behind the Scenes" [...] {{episode of the}} shoot, about her inspirations for the video. <b>She</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a [...] "giant" [...] dance video with [...] "LoveGame", {{describing}} it as [...] "plastic, beautiful, gorgeous, sweaty, tar on the floor". There would be scary and dangerous looking men also in the video. Gaga had the idea of portraying herself and her co-actors as New York inhabitants taking {{on the role of}} designers, performance artists, dancers etc. She enlisted people from downtown New York as dancers, who normally would not get cast in a video.|$|E
500|$|Nagle entered The Derby in 1937; that horse, Sandsprite, ridden by John Crouch at odds of 100–1, {{finished}} second to Mid-day Sun, owned by Mrs Lettice Miller, {{the first woman}} owner ever to win the Derby. This was the first horse Nagle bred herself and reactions from commentators were mixed. One report described the horse as a [...] "commanding individual", whereas another reporter's opposing opinion was revealed by Nagle when after Sandsprite's success at Epsom she stated [...] "Not bad for a horse which one newspaper said was only good enough to give rides at the seaside". Sandsprite's dam was Wood Nymph, a mare purchased by Nagle for 240 guineas. <b>She</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> her mated by the stallion Sansovino but {{had to settle for}} using his son, Sandwich, as she could not afford his stud fee. Sandsprite had several other outings in which he gained second or third placings, but was put down at the onset of his stud career after breaking a leg.|$|E

500|$|On another occasion, {{a prostitute}} {{was brought to}} Jackson's room after a concert in Madison Square Garden. There, the pop star interrogated the sex worker, asking why she was a prostitute, whether <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> sex with him, {{and how much it}} would cost. The woman responded that she was a prostitute for the money, but that she would have sex with him for free because she wanted him. The prostitute then {{proceeded}} to unbutton her blouse, exposing her breasts. Apparently repulsed, Jackson turned his head and begged her to [...] "put them back". The singer suggested that they talk instead but would still pay her, which the prostitute declined to do; she was not there to talk. Instead, she gave Jackson her telephone number, urging him to call her when he wanted to [...] "get off". Jackson acknowledged the prostitute as she left, stating that he would perhaps call her one day, though he never did.|$|E
500|$|Poniewozik complimented the way [...] "Monteith really sold Finn’s {{feeling of}} being {{helpless}} and overmatched", and Canning said that Finn's reaction to Rachel's admission that <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> sex because of the play was a [...] "solid and true moment". Rachel's reasoning, however, came in for harsh criticism: Brett Berk of Vanity Fair said it was [...] "neither believable nor even amusing" [...] that she would try intercourse for such a reason, Bell called her a [...] "dunce", and VanDerWerff didn't believe that she would just blurt it out to Finn. The Star-Ledger Vicki Hyman felt her decision {{to go all the}} way did not [...] "ring quite true", and Poniewozik called it [...] "essentially pity sex". Ausiello had a different view—"I would hardly call it pity sex"—and West said she was [...] "going to choose to believe" [...] that Rachel did not have her first time [...] "just to make him feel better".|$|E

She initially said that <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> an abortion, but she changed her mind and agreed to allow the pregnancy to continue on condition that Lennon adopt the role of househusband, which he agreed to do. Sean was born on 9 October 1975 (Lennon's 35th birthday) and delivered by Caesarean section. Lennon's subsequent hiatus from producing music would span five years. He had a photographer take pictures of Sean every day of his first year and created numerous drawings for him, which were posthumously published as Real Love: The Drawings for Sean. Lennon later proudly declared, [...] "He didn't come out of my belly but, by God, I made his bones, because I've attended to every meal, and to how he sleeps, and {{to the fact that he}} swims like a fish." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Ray of Light" [...] was {{directed}} by Jonas Åkerlund, who had previously shot the controversial clip for the song [...] "Smack My Bitch Up" [...] (1997) by The Prodigy. Madonna had been planning the video for [...] "Ray of Light" [...] {{from the time she}} was filming the clip for previous single [...] "Frozen" [...] in the Mojave Desert. [...] "Smack My Bitch Up" [...] was her current favorite and she enlisted Åkerlund. Madonna stated that when she makes an album, she [...] "puts [...] soul on it", but a music video is a lot more working with a director. With the Ray of Light album, <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> videos with fresh expression, and hence wanted to collaborate with new directors. She liked Åkerlund's [...] "special way of working" [...] and spoke with him over the telephone.

Rihanna had {{previously}} worked with Stargate on the singles [...] "Hate That I Love You", [...] "Don't Stop the Music" [...] and [...] "Rude Boy". In February 2011 Stargate said that Rihanna approached the Norwegian production duo before she began recording the then-untitled project, saying that <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> fun and produce happy, uptempo songs. According to Tor Erik Hermansen of Stargate, [...] "Only Girl (In the World)" [...] was the first song created for Loud and Rihanna decided to include it on the album before recording her vocals. In a webchat with fans, Rihanna said {{that she wanted to}} take the next step as an artist: [...] "I didn’t want to go backward and remake Good Girl Gone Bad. I wanted the next step in the evolution of Rihanna, and it’s perfect for us. You guys are always defending me, so now you’ve got some great songs to justify it." [...] The singer described [...] "Only Girl (In the World)" [...] as having a [...] "bigger sound" [...] than [...] "Rude Boy".|$|E
500|$|Madonna worked {{primarily}} with Orbit after Guy Oseary, Maverick Records's partner, phoned Orbit {{and suggested that}} he send some songs to the singer. He sent a 13-track digital audio tape (DAT) to Madonna, and [...] "Frozen" [...] was among these tracks. [...] "I was {{a huge fan of}} William's earlier records. [...] I also loved all the remixes he did for me and I was interested in fusing a kind of futuristic sound but also using lots of Indian and Moroccan influences and things like that, and I wanted it to sound old and new at the same time", Madonna said. The singer drew inspiration from Bernardo Bertolucci's 1990 British-Italian drama film, The Sheltering Sky, which dealt with a couple trying to save their marriage during a trip to Africa. <b>She</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the [...] "whole Moroccan/orchestral/super-romantic/man-carrying-the-woman-he-loves-across-the-desert vibe" [...] for the track. Still continuing work with Leonard on some of the tracks, Madonna asked him to give her a composition with [...] "tribal feel, something really lush and romantic". They composed the melody on the DAT and recorded the demo, which stretched to over 10 minutes due to Madonna continuing writing the track.|$|E

500|$|... "Turn Up the Radio" [...] was {{recorded}} at MSR Studios, New York City and Sarm West Studios, Notting Hill, London. It {{was produced by}} both Madonna and Solveig, the latter also working on the synth arrangement, the drums and the instrumentation for the song. Tordjman assisted Solveig on the synth arrangement. Demacio [...] "Demo" [...] Castellon, who represented The Demolition Crew group, was responsible for recording and mixing the track. Philippe Weiss and Graham Archer assisted Castellon on the recording, while Angie Teo assisted on the mixing. Lastly Jason [...] "Metal" [...] Donkersgoed did the additional editing of the song. According to Solveig, [...] "Turn Up the Radio" [...] was his first composition which Madonna approved for the album. On {{the first day of}} recording, the singer prepared all the things she wanted to change in the song and how <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the final version. She wanted to change the top lines and the melodies from the demo sung by Williams. During recording, Solveig muted the vocals and just played the instrumentals, then Madonna sang the song. The producer added that among all the songs they recorded, [...] "Turn Up the Radio" [...] was the most characteristic of a Madonna track.|$|E
2500|$|Spektor {{decided to}} work with {{multiple}} producers on the album. She has compared composing an album to taking a class, and as such, <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> [...] "multiple professors". She also felt the multiple producers would allow them not to worry what the single or big hit would be. The most notable producers include David Kahne, who produced her last album Begin to Hope, and Jeff Lynne, former member of Electric Light Orchestra and The Traveling Wilburys. Although Lynne has an expansive musical background, Spektor {{did not know of}} his work when she originally met him.|$|E
2500|$|According to Donnelly, {{the band}} {{had been working}} {{together}} for five years, stating that if she didn't have the band, she wouldn't {{know what else to}} do with her life. She described the band as a work of passion, citing sources of influences such as the bands Misfits, Blondie and Iron Maiden, and singer Courtney Love. The Misfits in particular were a large influence to the album; their horror themed and often purposely over-the-top style to making music were important in shaping the way the band presented themselves in image. Donelly expressed an interest with progressing the style of music on their sophomoric effort, stating that <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a tighter focus this time around, and specifically noting that the song titles on Fantastic Wounds were more direct and confident in nature.

2500|$|Reeves {{was anxious}} {{not to break}} up Wells's marriage, though <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> his child. The news that she was {{pregnant}} in the spring of 1909 shocked the Reeves family, and the couple fled to Le Touquet-Paris-Plage where they attempted domestic life together. Neither of them did well with domesticity; loneliness and anxiety concerning her pregnancy, as well as the complexity of the situation drove her to depression, and after three months they decided to leave Le Touquet. Wells took her to Boulogne and put her on the ferry to England, while he stayed to continue his writing. Reeves went to stay with Wells and his wife Jane when they returned to Sandgate. But then on 7 May 1909, she was married to Rivers Blanco White. In her latter life she wrote [...] "I did not arrange to marry Rivers, he arranged it with H.G, but I have always thought it the best that could possibly have happened".|$|E

The father, who had experienced a traumatic circumcision as a child objected and they turned to the courts for a decision. The Medical Society of New Jersey and the Urological Society of New Jersey both opposed any court ordered medical treatment. As the parties came to an agreement, no precedent was set. In June 2001 a Nevada court settled a dispute over circumcision between two parents but put a strict gag order on {{the terms of the}} settlement. In July 2001 a dispute between parents in Kansas over circumcision was resolved when the mother's request to have the infant circumcised was withdrawn. In this case the father opposed circumcision while the mother asserted that not circumcising the child was against her religious beliefs. (The woman's pastor had stated that circumcision was [...] "important" [...] but was not necessary for salvation.) On 24 July 2001 the parents reached agreement that the infant would not be circumcised.|$|E
