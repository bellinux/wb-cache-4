25|$|Typically, bulbs of 21 to 27watts, {{producing}} 280 to 570 lumens (22 to 45 mean spherical candlepower) {{are used}} for stop, turn, reversing and rear fog lamps, while bulbs of 4 to 10W, producing 40 to 130lm (3 to 10 mscp) {{are used for}} tail lamps, parking lamps, <b>side</b> <b>marker</b> <b>lamps</b> and side turn signal repeaters.|$|E
25|$|In the US, amber {{front and}} red rear <b>side</b> <b>marker</b> <b>lamps</b> and retroreflectors are required. The law {{initially}} required lights or retroreflectors on vehicles made after 1 January 1968. This was amended to require lights and retroreflectors on vehicles made after 1 January 1970. These side-facing devices make the vehicle's presence, position {{and direction of}} travel clearly visible from oblique angles. The lights are wired so as to illuminate whenever the vehicles' parking and taillamps are on, including when the headlamps are being used. Front amber side markers in the United States may be wired so as to flash in synchronous phase or opposite-phase with the turn signals, but {{are not required to}} flash at all. Side markers are permitted but not required on cars and light passenger vehicles outside the US and Canada. If installed, they are required to be brighter and visible through a larger horizontal angle than US side markers, may flash only in synchronous phase with the turn signals (but are not required to flash), and they must be amber at the front and rear, except rear side markers may be red if they are grouped, combined, or reciprocally incorporated with another rear lighting function that is required to be red.|$|E
2500|$|LEDs {{were first}} applied to {{automotive}} lighting in centre high-mount stop lamps (CHMSL), {{beginning with the}} 1984 Chevrolet Corvette. Adoption of LEDs for other signal functions on passenger cars is gradually increasing with demand for the technology and related styling updates. In North America, the 2000 Cadillac Deville was the first passenger car with LED taillights. The 2002 Kia Opirus/Amanti was an early adopter of LED front turn signals. The 2007 Audi R8 sports car uses two strips of optically focused high-intensity LEDs for its daytime running lamps. Optional on the R8 outside North America was the world's first LED headlamp, made by AL-Automotive Lighting. The low and high beams, along with the position (parking) lamp and front turn signal, are all realised with LEDs. [...] The Lexus LS 600h features LED low beam, position and <b>side</b> <b>marker</b> <b>lamps</b> in North America, and the 2009 Cadillac Escalade Platinum uses LEDs for the low and high beams, {{as well as for}} the position and <b>side</b> <b>marker</b> <b>lamps.</b> The Mercedes-Benz S-Class (W222) has no non-LED lamps at all, not even in the most basic trim level.|$|E
50|$|Because the United States {{does not}} {{recognise}} the international ECE Regulations on auto safety components and constructions, but rather maintains its own Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards, {{the front of}} the B4 had to be specially redesigned for vehicles sold in North America. The front and bumper had to be designed to accommodate impact energy absorbers not required outside North America. Instead of the dual-reflector headlamps, a single-reflector design was used inboard of an amber combination turn signal, parking, and <b>side</b> <b>marker</b> <b>lamp</b> and reflector wrapping around the corner, and fog lamps smaller than the rest-of-world items were placed the corners of the bumper air duct.|$|R

2500|$|For 1969, a new one-piece, full-width grille, new {{taillights}} {{and trim}} were featured. Standard engines were unchanged, although refinements in the Chrysler Clean Air System (formerly Clean Air Package) produced better operating economy from the 6-cylinder engines. Improved drum brake self-adjusters, {{a more efficient}} power steering pump, and improvements to the optional Sure-Grip differential were also highlighted. [...] Starting with cars built on January 1, 1969, front seat headrests were now standard. 1969 Valiants did not have <b>side</b> <b>marker</b> <b>lamps,</b> they would return in 1970.|$|E
2500|$|The 1969 model {{eliminated}} {{the front door}} vent windows, had a slight grille and taillight revision, moved the ignition key from the dashboard to the steering column (which locked the steering wheel when the key was removed, a federal requirement installed one year ahead of schedule), and the gauge faces changed from steel blue to black. In addition, the rear quarter-panel mounted <b>side</b> <b>marker</b> <b>lamps</b> changed from a red lens shaped like the Pontiac [...] "arrowhead" [...] emblem to one shaped like the broad GTO badge.

Such off-road vehicles are considered to be neither motor vehicles nor motorcycles, as those terms are defined under federal law. Under present-day NHTSA rules, the final decision as to whether such federally defined off-road vehicles may be legally operated on public roads is determined by the laws of the state in which the vehicle is being operated.|$|E
2500|$|The 1968 Caprice {{received}} a minor facelift {{that included a}} new grille with taillights set into the bumper and optional hidden headlamps. Caprice coupes now came standard with the new Astro Ventilation system, which included extra vents in the dash, {{and the removal of}} vent (wing) windows. <b>Side</b> <b>marker</b> <b>lamps</b> became standard on all U.S. cars and the Caprice carried over the optional white corner marker lamps at the forward edge of the fenders in addition to the amber parking lights which were illuminated with the headlights. All 1968 Chevrolets got front side marker lights on the fender; cars with an optional engine were identified with its cubic inch displacement listed on half the bezel; the light itself occupied the other half. The fiber optics monitoring system was offered again as an option. Chevrolet made the Caprice Coupe's formal roofline available in the Impala series. The Impala Custom Coupe became the best-selling model in the line. The L72 [...] Turbo-Jet V8 returned to the option list after a one-year hiatus. A new [...] Turbo Fire V8 rated at [...] replaced the [...] small block as the standard engine. Inside, the instrument panel was revised with a return to the horizontal sweep speedometer and a revised three-spoke steering wheel. An optional instrument cluster had a narrow speedometer within its opening and flanking it with engine-turned instruments in the place of warning lights. The fuel gauge, placed next to the speedometer within its own pod in the base models, was moved to its new place next to the speedometer. A tachometer took the place of the fuel gauge in the large opening left by the fuel gauge.|$|E
