500|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has {{assessed}} the leopard shark as of Least Concern. It is highly susceptible to local depletion {{due to its}} slow growth rate and low level of exchange between regional stocks. It was considered for, but is not managed under, the U.S. Pacific Fishery Management Council's (PMC) 1982 Groundfish Management Plan. In 1992, the State of California imposed a recreational minimum size limit of [...] and a possession limit of three fish, a move that was strongly supported and promoted by the sport fishing community. In 1993, the State also instituted a minimum size limit of [...] for the commercial harvesting of all sharks and rays, including for the aquarium trade. In addition, Californian restrictions {{on the use of}} certain types of fishing gear in near-shore waters confer good protection to this shark's core population. These management measures seem to have successfully reduced fishing mortality and halted the population decline from the 1980s; the status of the leopard shark off California is regarded as secure, with demographic models estimating an annual population increase of 3ndash&6% with <b>sustainable</b> <b>fishing.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Ocean {{circulation}} patterns have {{a strong}} influence on climate and weather and, in turn, the food supply of both humans and other organisms. Scientists have warned of the possibility, {{under the influence of}} climate change, of a sudden alteration in circulation patterns of ocean currents that could drastically alter the climate in some regions of the globe. Major human environmental impacts occur in the more habitable regions of the ocean fringes – the estuaries, coastline and bays. Ten per cent of the world's population – about 600 million people – live in low-lying areas vulnerable to sea level rise. Trends of concern that require management include: over-fishing (beyond sustainable levels); coral bleaching due to ocean warming and ocean acidification due to increasing levels of dissolved carbon dioxide; and sea level rise due to climate change. Because of their vastness oceans also act as a convenient dumping ground for human waste. Remedial strategies include: more careful waste management, statutory control of overfishing by adoption of <b>sustainable</b> <b>fishing</b> practices and the use of environmentally sensitive and sustainable aquaculture and fish farming, reduction of fossil fuel emissions and restoration of coastal and other marine habitat.|$|E
