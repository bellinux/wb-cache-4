25|$|The {{extreme value}} theorem of Karl Weierstrass states that a {{continuous}} real-valued function on a compact set attains its maximum and minimum value. More generally, a lower <b>semi-continuous</b> function on a compact set attains its minimum; an upper <b>semi-continuous</b> function on a compact set attains its maximum.|$|E

25|$|Black sparrowhawks are {{relatively}} widespread and common in sub-Saharan Africa and listed as not globally threatened by CITES. Densities range from one pair per 13 square kilometers in Kenya to one pair per 38-150 square kilometers in South Africa. On the Cape Peninsula, however, in the south-western corner of South Africa, the nest are typically only 500m (550yds) {{apart in the}} pine plantations and other continuous or <b>semi-continuous</b> belts of trees.|$|E
25|$|The most {{prevalent}} plant {{communities in the}} Sydney region are Dry Sclerophyll Forests which consist of eucalyptus trees and a few casuarinas, sclerophyll shrubs (typically wattles and banksias) and a <b>semi-continuous</b> grass in the understory, mainly in an open woodland setting. These plants tend to have rough and spiky leaves, as they're grown in areas with low soil fertility. Wet sclerophyll forests {{are found in the}} damp, elevated areas of Sydney, such as in the northeast. They are defined by straight, tall tree canopies with an elaborate, moist understorey of soft-leaved shrubs, tree ferns and herbs.|$|E

2500|$|Extrusion may be {{continuous}} (theoretically producing indefinitely long material) or <b>semi-continuous</b> (producing many pieces).

5000|$|The {{indicator}} function {{of an open}} set is lower <b>semi-continuous,</b> whereas the {{indicator function}} of a closed set is upper <b>semi-continuous.</b> The floor function , which returns the greatest integer {{less than or equal}} to a given real number x, is everywhere upper <b>semi-continuous.</b> Similarly, the ceiling function [...] is lower <b>semi-continuous.</b>|$|E

50|$|If f and g are two real-valued {{functions}} {{which are}} both upper <b>semi-continuous</b> at x0, then so is f + g.

50|$|A {{function}} may be upper {{or lower}} <b>semi-continuous</b> without being either {{left or right}} continuous.
