In the second test campaign, the pyrometer was sighted into the top of the radiant <b>syngas</b> <b>cooler</b> through an unused soot blower lance. The pyrometer experienced no more problems with slag occlusions, and the readings were continuous and consistent.

40|$|Integrated {{gasification}} {{combined cycle}} (IGCC) is a potentially promising clean technology with an inherent advantage of low emissions, since the process removes contaminants before combustion instead of from flue gas after combustion, as {{in a conventional}} coal steam plant. In addition, IGCC has potential for cost-effective carbon dioxide capture. Availability and high capital costs are the main challenges to making IGCC technology more competitive and fully commercial. Experiences from demonstrated IGCC plants show that, in the gasification system, low availability {{is largely due to}} slag buildup in the gasifier and fouling in the <b>syngas</b> <b>cooler</b> downstream of the gasification system. In the entrained flow gasifiers used in IGCC plants, the majority of mineral matter transforms to liquid slag {{on the wall of the}} gasifier and flows out the bottom. However, a small fraction of the mineral matter (as fly ash) is entrained with the raw syngas out of the gasifier to downstream processing. This molten/sticky fly ash could cause fouling of the <b>syngas</b> <b>cooler.</b> Therefore, it is preferable to minimize the quantity of fly ash and maximize slag. In addition, the hot raw syngas is cooled to convert any entrained molten fly slag to hardened solid fly ash prior to entering the <b>syngas</b> <b>cooler.</b> To improve gasification availability through better design and operation of the gasification process, better understanding of slag behavior and characteristics of the slagging process are needed. Slagging behavior is affected by char/ash properties, gas compositions in the gasifier, the gasifier wall structure, fluid dynamics, and plant operating conditions (mainly temperature and oxygen/carbon ratio). The viscosity of the slag is used to characterize the behavior of the slag flow and is the dominating factor to determine the probability that ash particles will stick. Slag viscosity strongly depends on the temperature and chemical composition of the slag. Because coal has varying ash content and composition, different operating conditions are required to maintain the slag flow and limit problems downstream. This report briefly introduces the IGCC process, the gasification process, and the main types and operating conditions of entrained flow gasifiers used in IGCC plants. This report also discusses the effects of coal ash and slag properties on slag flow and its qualities required for the entrained flow gasifier. Finally this report will identify the key operating conditions affecting slag flow behaviors, including temperature, oxygen/coal ratio, and flux agents...|$|E

In indirect gasification heat needed for endothermic gasification reactions is produced by burning char in a separate combustion section of the gasifier and subsequently the heat is transferred to the gasification section. The advantages of indirect gasification are no syngas dilution with nitrogen and no external heat source required. The production process involves several process units, including biomass gasification, <b>syngas</b> <b>cooler,</b> cleaning and compression, methanation reactors and SNG conditioning.

The study included detailed mass-energy balance simulations, financial analyses, and energy and environmental benefits estimates for seven pulpmill biorefinery process configurations. All seven configurations include an oxygen-blown, high-temperature black liquor gasifier, <b>syngas</b> <b>cooling,</b> clean-up by a Rectisol (methanol) system, and a catalytic gas-to-liquid process; six of them also include a fluidized-bed, oxygen-blown biomass gasifier and a gas turbine combined cycle fully integrated with the gasification and <b>syngas</b> <b>cooling</b> section. Three biofuels were examined: dimethyl ether (DME), Fischer-Tropsch liquids, and ethanol-rich mixed-alcohols. For the integrated biorefineries analyzed here, the ratio of useful energy outputs (steam, electricity and fuels) to total energy inputs (black liquor, wood residuals and fuel oil) ranges from 66 to 74 %; these values compare with about 57 % for conventional systems based on Tomlinson boilers and 65 % for gasification combined cycles that produce only electricity. Because of the integration of the biorefinery with the pulp and paper mill, the adjusted liquid fuel yield per unit of biomass – a measure of the effectiveness of biomass conversion to liquids – is far higher than for “standalone” gasification-based biorefineries or for ethanol production via biochemical conversion (based on enzymatic hydrolysis). Besides better energy performance, the integration between the biorefinery and the pulp mill effectively limits the specific capital investment associated with liquid fuels production to a surprisingly modest $ 60, 000 – 150, 000 per barrel of diesel equivalent per day—specific capital costs comparable to those for much larger coal-to-liquids facilities. Gasification-based pulp mill biorefinery technologies, once fully commercialized, offer the potential for attractive investment returns and, if implemented widely, significant energy and environmental benefits to the United States...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{simultaneous}} combined {{heat and}} power (CHP) production via biomass gasification is {{considered as one}} of the main alternatives to fossil energy. The possibility of significantly decrease greenhouse gas emissions as well as higher electrical performance compared to conventional wood combustion system have led to a growing interest in the gasification process. In the past decades several gasification units at lab- and pilot-scale have been developed but despite promising results (Hofbauer, 2003) none of them reached commercial scale due to unresolved technical issues. Mathematical modeling and simulation studies are then necessary to predict and evaluate the overall performance of new processes, especially at large scale. Numerous simulations have been reported regarding gasification technology (Spath, 2005; Gomez-Barea, 2010; Kaushal, 2010; Radmanesh, 2005) however in most studies gasification reactions are essentially modeled by chemical equilibriums that do {{not take into account the}} formation of tars, and the presence of inorganics in the biomass is generally not considered. Besides syngas cleaning and power generation steps are only rarely integrated (Damartzis, 2012). The aim of our work is to provide a rigorous model of an integrated CHP plant consisting of a wood gasification unit including a drying step, a <b>syngas</b> cleaning and <b>cooling</b> unit and a syngas combustion engine. The simulation is implemented in Aspen Plus where the combination of various modules coupled with Fortran user-subroutines gives a comprehensive representation of the system. The gasification unit is an indirect heated gasifier based on the TNEE technology (Deglise, 1985). The raw syngas exiting the gasifier consists of H 2, CO, CO 2, H 2 O, CH 4, C 2 H 4, C 2 H 6, C 6 H 6, C 7 H 8, C 8 H 8, C 9 H 8, C 10 H 8, C 12 H 8, C 14 H 10, C 16 H 10, NH 3, H 2 S, HCl and solid particles. All of these compounds are modeled for the first time under a biomass gasification process simulation. In order to burn the syngas in a gas engine, strict gas quality requirements have to be achieved (Jenbacher Documentation). As suggested in the literatures (Zwart, 2009; Göransson, 2011), the syngas cleaning unit consists of the following successive steps: cyclone, catalytic tar cracking, <b>syngas</b> <b>cooling</b> up to 120 °C, bag filter, water scrubber for tars, NH 3 and HCl removal, amine unit for H 2 S removal and a compressor. The syngas enters the engine at 40 °C and 1 bar with a LHV of 14. 5 MJ/kg. The engine produces 10 MWe and 3. 3. 105 kg/hr of hot water (90 / 105 °C) for district heating. The heat integration of the overall system will be detailed in the communication. A part of the heat contained in the flue gas is used to preheat the air combustion, while the remaining heat added to the recovered heat from the <b>syngas</b> <b>cooling</b> is used to dry the biomass. The energetic assessment of the CHP plant will be discussed and a complete mass balance of the whole process will be depicted.

In the co-production plants considered in the paper, coal is gasified to synthesis gas in an entrained flow gasifier. The <b>syngas</b> is <b>cooled,</b> cleaned of particulate matter, and shifted (to primarily H 2 and CO 2) in sour water–gas shift reactors. After further cooling, H 2 S is removed from the syngas using a physical solvent (Selexol); CO 2 is then removed from the syngas, again using Selexol; after being stripped from the solvent, the CO 2 is dried and compressed to 150 bar for pipeline transport and underground storage. High purity H 2 (99. 999 %) is extracted from the H 2 -rich syngas via a pressure swing adsorption (PSA) unit and delivered at 60 bar. The PSA purge gas is compressed and burned in a conventional gas turbine combined cycle, generating co-product electricity. The H 2 /electricity ratio can be varied by lowering the steam-to-carbon ratio in the syngas or by letting part of the de-carbonized syngas by-pass the PSA unit. Performances and emissions of H 2 /electricity co-production with CO 2 capture are compared with those of a system that vents the CO 2. We examine different methods of syngas heat recovery (quench versus radiant cooling) and explore the effects of changing the electricity/H 2 ratio, gasifier pressure and hydrogen purity. Results show that state-of-the-art commercial technology allows transferring to de-carbonized hydrogen 57 – 58 % of coal LHV, while exporting to the grid decarbonized electricity amounting to 2 – 6 % of coal LHV. In contrast to decarbonizing coal IGCC electricity, which entails a loss of 6 – 8 percentage points of electricity conversion when capturing CO 2 as an alternative to venting it, CO 2 capture for H 2 production gives a minor energy penalty (∼ 2 percentage points of export electricity).

The pre-combustion gas stream is at high pressure, has low volumetric flow rates and is capable of producing relatively pure hydrogen for conversion into electricity by gas turbines or fuel cells without generating additional carbon dioxide. Polybenzimidazole (PBI) polymer shows promise as a high temperature membrane material for pre-combustion-based capture of CO 2 from IGCC gas streams. We are developing {{a process that is}} based on PBI membrane to achieve a capture of 90 % CO 2 as a high pressure stream with about 10 % increase in the cost of energy. A significant advantage of the PBI membrane compared to other sorbent-based technologies and conventional polymeric membranes is that PBI membrane is capable of operating at over a broader temperature range (∼ 100 – 400  ∘C). In contrast, solvent-based processes such as Selexol require <b>syngas</b> <b>cooling</b> prior to treatment, followed by reheating the processed fuel gas stream. In this paper, we are presenting the preliminary results of a process simulation using the ASPEN program under several scenerios including the IGCC with no CO 2 capture, IGCC with Selexol, and IGCC with PBI membrane separator. The high temperature membrane-based CO 2 capture method compares favorably against the Selexol-based CO 2 capture method. If H 2 S remains with the CO 2 stream and can be sequestered, then the cost of electricity appears to be lower than Selexol-bsed separation systems...|$|R

A high integration between gasification and power islands is necessary in order to obtain an elevated efficiency: the heat recovery system from <b>syngas</b> <b>cooling</b> is carefully arranged to provide thermal power for clean syngas reheating, air preheating and steam generation. The paper presents a preliminary analysis of literature results and a discussion of the thermodynamic implications arising from the use of different primary fuels in a fuel cell-gas turbine cycle. Then the work presents a detailed thermodynamic analysis of the proposed IGFC layout, assessing the effect of SOFC operating pressure on power balance and net plant efficiency. A sensitivity analysis on the variation of fuel and air utilization in the fuel cell is also performed. Results show that the present innovative SOFC-based power system may achieve an efficiency gain of 7 - 11 percentage points, with respect to an advanced IGCC based on state of the art technology...|$|R
40|$|A High Performance Power System (HIPPS) {{is being}} developed. This {{system is a}} coal-fired, {{combined}} cycle plant with indirect heating of gas turbine air. Foster Wheeler Development Corporation and a team consisting of Foster Wheeler Energy Corporation, Bechtel Corporation, University of Tennessee Space Institute and Westinghouse Electric Corporation are developing this system. In Phase 1 of the project, a conceptual design of a commercial plant was developed. Technical and economic analyses indicated that the plant would meet {{the goals of the}} project which include a 47 percent efficiency (HHV) and a 10 percent lower cost of electricity than an equivalent size PC plant. The concept uses a pyrolysis process to convert coal into fuel gas and char. The char is fired in a High Temperature Advanced Furnace (HITAF). The HITAF is a pulverized fuel-fired boiler/air heater where steam is generated and gas turbine air is indirectly heated. The fuel gas generated in the pyrolyzer is then used to heat the gas turbine air further before it enters the gas turbine. The project is currently in Phase 2 which includes engineering analysis, laboratory testing and pilot plant testing. Research and development is being done on the HIPPS systems that are not commercial or being developed on other projects. Pilot plant testing of the pyrolyzer subsystem and the char combustion subsystem are being done separately. This report addresses the areas of technical progress for this quarter. The detail of <b>syngas</b> <b>cooler</b> design is given in this report. The final construction work of the CFB pyrolyzer pilot plant has started during this quarter.

40|$|The U. S. Department of Energy‘s National Energy Technology Laboratory (DOE NETL) is {{exploring}} affordable technologies and processes to convert domestic coal and biomass resources to high-quality liquid hydrocarbon fuels. This interest is primarily {{motivated by the}} need to increase energy security and reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the United States. Gasification technologies represent clean, flexible and efficient conversion pathways to utilize coal and biomass resources. Substantial experience and knowledge had been developed worldwide on gasification of either coal or biomass. However, reliable data on effects of blending various biomass fuels with coal during gasification process and resulting syngas composition are lacking. In this project, GE Global Research performed a complete characterization of the gas, liquid and solid products that result from the co-gasification of coal/biomass mixtures. This work was performed using a bench-scale gasifier (BSG) and a pilot-scale entrained flow gasifier (EFG). This project focused on comprehensive characterization of the products from gasifying coal/biomass mixtures in a high-temperature, high-pressure entrained flow gasifier. Results from this project provide guidance on appropriate gas clean-up systems and optimization of operating parameters needed to develop and commercialize gasification technologies. GE‘s bench-scale test facility provided the bulk of high-fidelity quantitative data under temperature, heating rate, and residence time conditions closely matching those of commercial oxygen-blown entrained flow gasifiers. Energy and Environmental Research Center (EERC) pilot-scale test facility provided focused high temperature and pressure tests at entrained flow gasifier conditions. Accurate matching of syngas time-temperature history during cooling ensured that complex species interactions including homogeneous and heterogeneous processes such as particle nucleation, coagulation, surface condensation, and gas-phase reactions were properly reproduced and lead to representative syngas composition at the <b>syngas</b> <b>cooler</b> outlet. The experimental work leveraged other ongoing GE R&D efforts such as biomass gasification and dry feeding systems projects.

40|$|To {{reduce the}} {{greenhouse}} effect, {{the use of}} renewable fuel has to be increased. As renewable fuel has different characteristics compared to fossil fuel regarding content of trace metals, alkali, chlorine and sulphur, the corrosion characteristics in high temperature energy processes have to be evaluated. This thesis concerns high temperature corrosion in the superheater region of a boiler and the <b>syngas</b> <b>cooler</b> area of a gasifier. For the superheater region, laboratory exposures were performed. The methods included a salt dip exposure, where samples were dipped in an equimolar solution of ZnCl 2 and KCl, and two salt bed exposures with different chlorine concentrations, 10 and 20 wt%. Ranking of the materials showed that a Ni content above 10 wt% and Cr above 20 wt% reduced corrosion rates in the salt dip and in the 10 % Cl salt bed exposure. For exposure in the 20 % Cl bed, even higher alloying was needed. An alumina forming austenitic steel showed future potential in sulphidising-chlorinating environments. For the gasifier region, the effect of HCl in a simulated gasifier atmosphere was studied and also samples exposed in the syngas section of a biomass gasifier were investigated. Metal loss was low for all exposures and {{it was observed that}} chlorine had minor influence. For the plant exposed samples, a difference compared to that reported for coal gasifiers was the absence of FeS for the lowest alloyed steel. Instead, a deposit with pronounced content of Zn, Ca, S and O was present on the surface. Zinc was suggested to mitigate corrosion. Thermodynamic modelling was used to explain phases present and to predict the nitridation behaviour of an alumina forming austenitic steel. Equilibrium and kinetic modelling of the nitridation showed good coherence with the observed microstructures. However, the kinetic modelling resulted in larger nitridation depths than observed experimentally which was attributed to the presence of a thin oxide layer {{on the surface of the}} samples.

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{coal-fired}} power plants have increased {{their role in the}} global energy scenario and in this framework environmental issues require a sustainable use of coal and great efforts for greenhouse gas reduction. With this aim, this paper reports on a comparative performance assessment of two power generation technologies: the Ultra Super Critical (USC) steam plant and the Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) plant. Performances were assessed referring to typical commercial size plants (400 - 500 MW) integrated with CO 2 capture systems. The study is based on simulation models specifically developed through Aspen-Plus® and Gate-Cycle® software platforms. The USC plant is integrated with a SNOX section that removes simultaneously nitrogen and sulfur oxides without producing process wastes and with lower power requirements compared to traditional FGD systems. The USC plant is also integrated with a low temperature CO 2 capture/compression section based on a MEA chemical absorption process. The IGCC plant is based on a Texaco entrained bed gasifier, fed by a coal-water slurry and high purity oxygen, integrated with a triple-pressure reheat combined cycle. The IGCC is integrated with a <b>syngas</b> <b>cooling</b> and treatment section composed of radiant and convective coolers, a water gas shift section and a low temperature CO 2 capture system based on a physical absorption process. The performance assessment of USC and IGCC power plants was carried out by varying the main operating parameters of both power sections and gas treatment sections. For both plants an in-depth analysis of performance penalties due to the CO 2 capture systems was carried out, evaluating the influence of CO 2 removal technology and efficiency...|$|R
40|$|Gasification-based {{energy systems}} coupled with {{carbon dioxide capture}} and storage {{technologies}} {{have the potential to}} reduce greenhouse gas emissions from continued use of abundant and secure fossil fuels. Dynamic reduced order models (ROMs) that predict the operation of entrained flow gasifiers (EFGs) within IGCC (integrated gasification combined cycle) or polygeneration plants are essential for understanding the fundamental processes of importance. Such knowledge can be used to improve gasifier reliability, availability and maintainability, leading to greater commercialization of gasification technology. A dynamic ROM, implemented in Aspen Custom Modeler, has been developed for a range of EFGs. The ROM incorporates multiple feedstocks, mixing and recirculation, particle properties, drying and devolatilization, chemical kinetics, fluid dynamics, heat transfer, pollutant formation, slag behavior and <b>syngas</b> <b>cooling.</b> The ROM employs a reactor network model (RNM) that approximates complex fluid mixing and recirculation using a series of idealized chemical reactors. The ROM was successfully validated for steady-state simulation of four experimental gasifiers. The throughputs of these gasifiers range from 0. 1 to 1000 metric tonnes per day (3 kWth - 240 MWth). Sensitivity analysis was performed to identify the parameters most important to ROM accuracy. The most important parameters are found to be those that determine RNM geometry, particle physical and kinetic properties, and slagging. The ROM was used to simulate the steady-state and dynamic performance of a full-scale EFG system. In steady-state mode, the ROM was used to establish base case and fluxant requirements. The base case performance agreed with design specifications. Steady-state simulation was also used to determine important states for dynamic simulation. Six cases were examined in dynamic mode, including gasifier cold start. Dynamic results showed agreement with industrial experience for gasifier start-up times. by Rory F. D. Monaghan. Thesis (Ph.

40|$|This report {{summarizes}} the achievements and final {{results of this}} program. The objective of this program {{is to develop a}} comprehensive systems approach to integrated design of sensing and control systems for an Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) plant, using advanced model-based techniques. In particular, this program is focused on the model-based sensing and control system design for the core gasification section of an IGCC plant. The overall approach consists of (i) developing a first-principles physics-based dynamic model of the gasification section, (ii) performing model-reduction where needed to derive low-order models suitable for controls analysis and design, (iii) developing a sensing system solution combining online sensors with model-based estimation for important process variables not measured directly, and (iv) optimizing the steady-state and transient operation of the plant for normal operation as well as for startup using model predictive controls (MPC). Initially, available process unit models were implemented in a common platform using Matlab/Simulink{reg_sign}, and appropriate model reduction and model updates were performed to obtain the overall gasification section dynamic model. Also, a set of sensor packages were developed through extensive lab testing and implemented in the Tampa Electric Company IGCC plant at Polk power station in 2009, to measure temperature and strain in the radiant <b>syngas</b> <b>cooler</b> (RSC). Plant operation data was also used to validate the overall gasification section model. The overall dynamic model was then used to develop a sensing solution including a set of online sensors coupled with model-based estimation using nonlinear extended Kalman filter (EKF). Its performance in terms of estimating key unmeasured variables like gasifier temperature, carbon conversion, etc., was studied through extensive simulations in the presence sensing errors (noise and bias) and modeling errors (e. g. unknown gasifier kinetics, RSC fouling). In parallel, an MPC solution was initially developed using ideal sensing to optimize the plant operation during startup pre-heating as well as steady state and transient operation under normal high-pressure conditions, e. g. part-load, base-load, load transition and fuel changes. The MPC simulation studies showed significant improvements both for startup pre-heating and for normal operation. Finally, the EKF and MPC solutions were coupled to achieve the integrated sensing and control solution and its performance was studied through extensive steady state and transient simulations in the presence of sensor and modeling errors. The results of each task in the program and overall conclusions are summarized in this final report...|$|E
40|$|Coal is {{the most}} common fossil {{resource}} for power production worldwide and generates 40 % of the worlds total electricity production. Even though coal is considered a pollutive resource, the great amounts and the increasing power demand leads to extensive use even in new developed power plants. To cover the world's future energy demand {{and at the same time}} limit our effect on global warming, coal fired power plants with CO 2 capture is probably a necessity. An Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) Power Plant is a utilization of coal which gives incentives for CO 2 capture. Coal is partially combusted in a reaction with steam and pure oxygen. The oxygen is produced in an air separation process and the steam is generated in the Power Island. Out of the gasifier comes a mixture of mainly H 2 and CO. In a shift reactor the CO and additional steam are converted to CO 2 and more H 2. Carbon dioxide is separated from the hydrogen in a physical absorption process and compressed for storage. Hydrogen diluted with nitrogen from the air separation process is used as fuel in a combined cycle similar to NGCC. A complete IGCC Power Plant is described in this report. The air separation unit is modeled as a Linde two column process. Ambient air is compressed and cooled to dew point before it is separated into oxygen and nitrogen in a cryogenic distillation process. Out of the island oxygen is at a purity level of 95. 6 % and the nitrogen has a purity of 99. 6 %. The production cost of oxygen is 0. 238 kWh per kilogram of oxygen delivered at 25 °C and 1. 4 bar. The oxygen is then compressed to a gasification pressure of 42 bar. In the gasification unit the oxygen together with steam is used to gasify the coal. On molar basis the coal composition is 73. 5 % C, 22. 8 % H 2, 3. 1 % O 2, 0. 3 % N 2 and 0. 3 % S. The gasification temperature is at 1571 °C and out of the unit comes syngas consisting of 66. 9 % CO, 31. 1 % H 2, 1. 4 % H 2 O, 0. 3 % N 2, 0. 2 % H 2 S and 0. 1 % CO 2. The syngas is cooled and fed to a water gas shift reactor. Here the carbon monoxide is reacted with steam forming carbon dioxide and additional hydrogen. The gas composition of the gas out of the shift reactor is on dry basis 58. 2 % H 2, 39. 0 % CO 2, 2. 4 % CO, 0. 2 % N 2 and 0. 1 % H 2 S. Both the gasification process and shift reactor is exothermal and there is no need of external heating. This leads to an exothermal heat loss, but parts of this heat is recovered. The gasifier has a Cold Gas Efficiency (CGE) of 84. 0 %. With a partial pressure of CO 2 at 15. 7 bar the carbon dioxide is easily removed by physical absorption. After separation the solvent is regenerated by expansion and CO 2 is pressurized to 110 bar to be stored. This process is not modeled, but for the scrubbing part an energy consumption of 0. 08 kWh per kilogram CO 2 removed is assumed. For the compression of CO 2, it is calculated with an energy consumption of 0. 11 kWh per kilogram CO 2 removed. Removal of H 2 S and other pollutive unwanted substances is also removed in the CO 2 scrubber. Between the CO 2 removal and the combustion chamber is the H 2 rich fuel gas is diluted with nitrogen from the air separation unit. This is done to increase the mass flow through the turbine. The amount of nitrogen available is decided by the amount of oxygen produced to the gasification process. Almost all the nitrogen produced may be utilized as diluter except from a few percent used in the coal feeding procedure to the gasifier. The diluted fuel gas has a composition of 50. 4 % H 2, 46. 1 % N 2, 2. 1 % CO and 1. 4 % CO 2. In the Power Island a combined cycle with a gas turbine able to handle large H 2 amounts is used. The use of steam in the gasifier and shift reactor are integrated in the heat recovery steam generator (HRSG) in the steam cycle. The heat removed from the <b>syngas</b> <b>cooler</b> is also recovered in the HRSG. The overall efficiency of the IGCC plant modeled is 36. 8 %. This includes oxygen and nitrogen production and compression, production of high pressure steam used in the Gasification Island, coal feeding costs, CO 2 removal and compression and pressure losses through the processes. Other losses are not implemented and will probably reduce the efficiency. </p...|$|E

40|$|Improving {{the steam}} cycle design to {{maximize}} power generation is demonstrated using pinch analysis targeting techniques. Previous work models the steam pressure level in composite curves {{based on its}} saturation temperature alone. The present work examines the effect of including both sensible and latent heating of steam in the composite curve. It is shown that including sensible heating allows for better thermal matching between the process and steam system which results in improving the overall efficiency while minimizing the capital cost. Additionally, fixed steam headers, such as assumed in total site analysis, give no allowance for reheating before turbine expansion, which can be valuable to consider when optimizing the steam system for certain plant configurations. A case study using an integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) plant with carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) is analyzed to assess changes in steam cycle design on the plant efficiency and cost. In addition to improving the steam system within an IGCC plant to improve efficiency, losses within the radiant heat exchanger can also be reduced. Instead of using high temperature <b>syngas,</b> <b>cooling</b> from 1300 °C to 760 °C, to boil steam at 330 °C, another heat transfer fluid can be used and heated to higher temperatures. Material constraints restrict the maximum allowable temperature of the heat transfer fluid. To maintain high heat transfer coefficients in the heat transfer fluid, a fluid with high thermal conductivity, such as a liquid metal, can be used and heated to high temperatures (~ 700 °C). Liquid metals can then act as an intermediate heat transfer medium, absorbing heat from high temperature syngas and rejecting it to steam at temperatures in excess of 500 °C. The use of liquid metals leads to a 0. 75 point increase in plant efficiency. Gases, such as carbon dioxide and helium, are also considered as potential heat transfer fluids in the radiant heat exchanger. These gases can be at equal pressure to the syngas pressure in the radiant heat exchanger, reducing the tensile stress in tube walls, but their low thermal conductivities still necessitate high strength materials at high temperature. A Brayton power cycle with recuperation is considered in this work, absorbing heat from the hot syngas and rejecting it to steam. Over a range of different Brayton cycle pressure ratios and maximum temperatures, no improvement in plant efficiency was found {{with respect to the}} case where steam is boiled in the same sized heat exchanger. by Barbara Brenda Botros.

25|$|Pre-combustion CO2 removal is {{much easier}} than CO2 removal from flue gas in {{post-combustion}} capture due to the high concentration of CO2 after the water-gas-shift reaction and the high pressure of the syngas. During pre-combustion in IGCC, the partial pressure of CO2 is nearly 1000 times higher than in post-combustion flue gas. Due to the high concentration of CO2 pre-combustion, physical solvents, such as Selexol and Rectisol, are preferred {{for the removal of}} CO2 vs that of chemical solvents. Physical solvents work by absorbing the acid gases without the need of a chemical reaction as in traditional amine based solvents. The solvent can then be regenerated, and the CO2 desorbed, by reducing the pressure. The biggest obstacle with physical solvents is the need for the <b>syngas</b> to be <b>cooled</b> before separation and reheated afterwards for combustion. This requires energy and decreases overall plant efficiency.|$|R
