50|$|It is a point-wise <b>self-regulating</b> <b>heater</b> and {{self-limiting}} heater. Self-regulating {{means that}} every {{point of the}} heater independently keeps a constant temperature without the need of regulating electronics. Self-limiting means that the heater can never exceed a certain temperature in any point and requires no overheat protection.|$|E
50|$|The PTC rubber {{material}} is a <b>self-regulating</b> <b>heater.</b> It produces {{the same amount}} of heat in each point of the heater as is conducted and radiated away from the heater to the object it is attached to, and its surroundings. It is in constant thermal equilibrium with the environment, point by point. A measure of the power produced by the heater is actually a measurement of the heat transfer between the heater and the object. Hence, it {{can be used as a}} heat transfer sensor.|$|E
50|$|A <b>self-regulating</b> <b>heater</b> is an {{electrical}} heater which strives {{to keep a}} constant temperature regardless of how the ambient conditions changes. It is the material in the heater itself that regulates the temperature. The heater requires no regulating electronics, temperature sensors, overheat protection etc. The temperature the heater will hold is decided when the material and the heater is produced. It can be fine tuned by changing the voltage to the heater. Self-regulating heaters are made from materials with strong Positive temperature coefficient (PTC) characteristics, i.e. the resistivity of the material increases rapidly with increasing temperature. Such materials include ceramic PTC stones. and PTC rubber.|$|E

40|$|Bulk {{thermistor}} ceramics on BaTiO 3 -basis {{with positive}} temperature coefficient (PTC) are used for surge protection devices, <b>self-regulating</b> <b>heaters</b> or temperature sensing elements for a long time. The origin of their high current limiting electric insulation resistance that only appears upon heating above the Curie temperature TC of the ferroelectric compound BaTiO 3 relies on a resistive back-to-back Schottky barrier layer, a space charge zone formed at the grain boundaries. This insulating layer {{is due to the}} physical or chemical absorption of oxygen combined with segregated acceptor-type metal vacancies created at the interface during processing. Generally the material compositions under mass production are offstoichiometric, enriched in TiO 2 and must be sintered under oxidizing conditions, since the oxidation process is crucial for the defect chemical reactions involved {{in the formation of the}} insulating grain boundary layer...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{positive}} {{temperature coefficient}} (PTC) effect on material properties has attracted much attention in recent years due to the prospects of many applications like temperature sensors, thermistors, <b>self-regulating</b> <b>heaters,</b> etc. It {{has been suggested that}} incorporation of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) into carbon black (CB) -filled polymers could improve the electrical properties of composites due to high conductivity and network structure and significantly reduce the required CB loading. RESULTS: We observed no change in melting temperature and crystalline transition temperature on addition of MWNTs. However, the heat of fusion decreases as the amount of conducting carboxylated MWNT (c-MWNT) filler increases and the resistivity of the composite decreases. The free volume shows an increase up to 1. 5 wt% of c-MWNT content and then decreases. CONCLUSION: Well-developed crystals could not be formed due to restricted chain mobility as filler content increases. This results in minimum intermolecular interactions, and thus a decreased heat of fusion. A composite with c-MWNT content of 0. 5 wt% showed the highest PTC and higher resistivity at 150 degrees C possibly due to the formation of flocculated structures at elevated temperature. For filler content greater than 1. 5 wt%, the decrease in free volume may be due to restricted chain mobility. (C) 2009 Society of Chemical Industr...|$|R
40|$|Polyvinyl chloride- (PVC-) based nanocomposites {{containing}} nanosized graphite {{and nickel}} nanoparticles (GN) as conductive fillers to achieve {{positive temperature coefficient}} of resistance (PTCR) thermistors and <b>self-regulating</b> <b>heater</b> function have been successfully fabricated. The microstructure of the foliated graphite and nanocomposites was examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The effect of GN content on the static electrical conductivity, carrier's mobility, and number of charge carriers of the nanocomposites was studied. The applicability of nanocomposites as PTCR thermistors was examined by monitoring the conductivity as a function of temperature. It is found that the conduction mechanism in PVC/GN nanocomposites is governed by tunneling mechanism. Also, the applied voltage versus current and temperature were studied to check the applicability of composites as <b>self-regulating</b> <b>heater.</b> The results show that the PVC/GN nanocomposites might have potential applications in PTCR devices, <b>self-regulating</b> <b>heater,</b> and temperature sensors...|$|E
40|$|The Shuttle/Centaur {{high energy}} upper stage vehicle thermal environments were {{more severe than}} {{previous}} Centaur vehicle thermal environments, creating {{need for a new}} hydrazine fuel line thermal control technique. Constant power heaters did not satisfy power dissipation requirements, because the power required to maintain fuel line thermal control during cold conditions exceeded the maximum power allowable during hot conditions. Therefore, a Raychem Thermolimit <b>self-regulating</b> <b>heater</b> was selected for this application, and was attached to the hydrazine fuel line with Kapton and aluminum foil tapes. Fuel line/heater thermal modeling and subsequent thermal vacuum chamber testing simulated heater thermal performance during all worst-case Shuttle/Centaur thermal environmental conditions. Fuel line temperatures were maintained between the 4 C to 71 C limits during all analytical and test cases. Finally, the thermal model predictions were correlated with the test data, thereby ensuring that the model would provide satisfactory predictions for future missions and/or vehicles...|$|E
