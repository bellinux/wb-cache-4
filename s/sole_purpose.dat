5|$|A major {{accomplishment}} of the Johnson administration was {{the passage of}} a legislative redistricting bill. Despite the fact that the U.S. Constitution requires redistricting after every decennial census, Kentucky's legislative districts had remained virtually unchanged between 1893 and 1941. He asked the 1942 legislative session to adjourn early so he could call a special session for the <b>sole</b> <b>purpose</b> of considering a redistricting bill. The legislators obliged, and passed a bill {{by the end of the}} special session.|$|E
5|$|Several Congressmen, {{including}} Hamilton, Robert Morris and Gouverneur Morris, {{attempted to}} use this Newburgh conspiracy as leverage to secure support from the states and in Congress for funding of the national government. They encouraged MacDougall to continue his aggressive approach, threatening unknown consequences if their demands were not met, and defeated proposals that would have resolved the crisis without establishing general federal taxation: that the states assume the debt to the army, or that an impost be established dedicated to the <b>sole</b> <b>purpose</b> of paying that debt.|$|E

5|$|After {{more than}} 60 years of {{continuous}} operation, the Cacchio family {{decided to sell}} the Theatre. Rather than sell to real estate developers, the Cacchios preferred to transfer the property to the Rosendale Theatre Collective, a nonprofit formed in late 2009 for the <b>sole</b> <b>purpose</b> of buying and preserving the Theatre. The group spent months raising funds {{for a down payment}} on the building, with the bulk of its money coming from small individual donations. About 60 fundraisers were held, and a large grant was provided by PepsiCo after the Theatre Collective ran a successful social networking campaign for the April 2010 Pepsi Refresh Project. The Cacchios transferred ownership of the property to the Theatre Collective on August19, 2010.

5|$|Dio {{maintains}} that one purpose for Caracalla issuing the edict was {{the desire to}} increase state revenue; at the time, Rome was in a difficult financial situation and needed {{to pay for the}} new pay raises and benefits that were being conferred on the military. The edict widened the obligation for public service and gave increased revenue through the inheritance and emancipation taxes that only had to be paid by Roman citizens. The provincials also benefited from this edict because they were now able {{to think of themselves as}} equal partners to the Romans in the empire. However, few of those that gained citizenship were wealthy, and while it is true that Rome was in a difficult financial situation, it is thought that this could not have been the <b>sole</b> <b>purpose</b> of the edict.|$|E

This happens while Underwood and Claire advocate for a controversial gun control bill for the <b>sole</b> <b>purpose</b> of creating an atmosphere divisive enough to weed out potential running mates. During the resulting open convention, Underwood intimidates the front-runner, Secretary of State Catherine Durant (Jayne Atkinson), into surrendering her delegates, and uses the public sympathy from Claire's mother's death to ensure that he and Claire are nominated.|$|E

5|$|The {{development}} of factitious disorders in online venues is made easier by {{the availability of}} medical literature on the Internet, the anonymous and malleable nature of online identities, {{and the existence of}} communication forums established for the <b>sole</b> <b>purpose</b> of giving support to members facing significant health or psychological problems. Several high-profile cases have demonstrated behavior patterns which are common among those who pose as gravely ill or as victims of violence, or whose deaths are announced to online forums. The virtual communities that were created to give support, as well as general non-medical communities, often express genuine sympathy and grief for the purported victims. When fabrications are suspected or confirmed, the ensuing discussion can create schisms in online communities, destroying some and altering the trusting nature of individual members in others.|$|E
5|$|The soldier caste has {{anatomical}} and behavioural specialisations, {{and their}} <b>sole</b> <b>purpose</b> is {{to defend the}} colony. Many soldiers have large heads with highly modified powerful jaws so enlarged they cannot feed themselves. Instead, like juveniles, they are fed by workers. Fontanelles, simple holes in the forehead that exude defensive secretions, are {{a feature of the}} family Rhinotermitidae. Many species are readily identified using the characteristics of the soldiers' larger and darker head and large mandibles. Among certain termites, soldiers may use their globular (phragmotic) heads to block their narrow tunnels. Different sorts of soldiers include minor and major soldiers, and nasutes, which have a horn-like nozzle frontal projection (a nasus). These unique soldiers are able to spray noxious, sticky secretions containing diterpenes at their enemies. Nitrogen fixation {{plays an important role in}} nasute nutrition.|$|E

Yankovic released the record under Placebo Records, a one-off label founded by Yankovic for the <b>sole</b> <b>purpose</b> of distributing the EPs. Due to the underground success of the record, Yankovic was eventually able to secure a short-lived record deal with TK Records, who released the title song as a single.

50|$|Privatization {{took place}} in 1998, when the works, by that time {{employing}} 1500, were broken up into twelve companies that began to go bankrupt one by one. The core business among these, called Sidermet, produced iron tubes. This company was sold by the state in 2003 and its new owners filed for bankruptcy in late 2005. By that point, Sidermet had 200 employees remaining, for the <b>sole</b> <b>purposes</b> of safeguarding and maintenance of the site. In 2010, there were two firms left standing, with under seventy employees.

50|$|To Rome with Love is {{the story}} of widowed college {{professor}} Michael Endicott, who decided to leave his native Iowa following the death of his wife and accept a new position as an instructor at the American Overseas School of Rome. The culture shock of his children in reacting to their new environment, and to an extent, his own, provided the main humor in the series. Family situations provided most of the rest. Early on, much of this came from Endicott's single sister, Harriet, who followed them to Rome, apparently for the <b>sole</b> <b>purposes</b> of dissuading them from living there and to cajole them into returning to Iowa. Harriet soon departed, but her place was taken shortly afterward by Andy Pruitt, Endicott's father-in-law and the children's grandfather.

5|$|Abraham Lincoln's {{constitutional}} election {{reflected the}} nation’s sectional divide, though 82 {{percent of the}} electorate had split among the Unionists, Lincoln, Stephen A.

Breckinridge resolved to secede from the United States and form the Confederate States of America. The Virginia Assembly called a special convention for the <b>sole</b> <b>purpose</b> of considering secession from the United States. Virginia was deeply divided, returning a convention of delegates amounting to about one-third for secession and two thirds Unionist. But the Unionists would prove to be further divided between those who would be labelled Conditional Unionists who would favor Virginia in the Union only if Lincoln made no move at “coercion”, and those who would later be called Unconditional Unionists who would be unwavering in their loyalty to the constitutional government of the United States.|$|E
5|$|Once Birmingham Dissenters {{started to}} agitate for {{the repeal of}} the Test and Corporation Acts, which {{restricted}} Dissenters' civil rights (preventing them, for instance, from attending the Universities of Oxford or Cambridge, or from holding public office), the semblance of unity among the town's elite disappeared. Unitarians such as Priestley were {{at the forefront of the}} repeal campaign, and orthodox Anglicans grew nervous and angry. After 1787, the emergence of Dissenting groups formed for the <b>sole</b> <b>purpose</b> of overturning these laws began to divide the community; however, the repeal efforts failed in 1787, 1789, and 1790. Priestley's support of the repeal and his heterodox religious views, which were widely published, inflamed the populace. In February 1790, a group of activists came together not only to oppose the interests of the Dissenters but also to counteract what they saw as the undesirable importation of French Revolutionary ideals. Dissenters by and large supported the French Revolution and its efforts to question the role monarchy should play in government.|$|E

While Frank is in surgery, Claire helps guide Frank's vice president Donald Blythe through a diplomatic crisis with Russia. While Frank is receiving a liver transplant, she declines {{going to the hospital}} in favor of negotiating a treaty with Petrov, and strong-arms him into accepting the U.S.' terms. When Frank recovers from surgery, he agrees to let Claire be his vice president. He and Claire advocate for a controversial gun control bill for the <b>sole</b> <b>purpose</b> of creating an atmosphere divisive enough to pick off the potential running mates.

Based on the available information and photographic data we proceed to a typological classification of lighting spaces. An analysis of artificial lighting used is also made in order to find solutions to improve its quality...|$|R
5|$|There {{were two}} major {{political}} coalitions {{running in the}} elections. The Indian National Congress contested alone, while the Dravidar Kazhagam (DK) under Periyar E. V.

The DMK-led United Front comprised the Swatantra Party, Communist Party of India (Marxist), Praja Socialist Party, Samyukta Socialist Party, Tamil Nadu Toilers Party, Republican Party of India and the Indian Union Muslim League. The Tamil Arasu Kazhagam and the We Tamils party campaigned using the DMK election symbol. This opposition coalition was forged by C.

5|$|Anti-Relief partisans opened many {{lines of}} attack against Desha. They said {{his refusal to}} {{articulate}} a specific campaign platform showed {{that he was trying}} to be all things to all people. They assailed his military record, claiming he had only volunteered for service in the War of 1812 after being promised command of a division, that he balked at fighting and discouraged General Harrison's pursuit of the British and Indians, and that he billed excessive expenses to the government after his service. Desha's legislative career was also subject to scrutiny and attack. Anti-Relief partisans claimed that he had espoused certain positions for the <b>sole</b> <b>purpose</b> of pitting the state's agrarian interests against its aristocracy. They charged that he had secretly favored the Compensation Act of 1816 and had worked to pass it, despite his vote against it. In contrast to his rhetoric in favor of a strong, well-equipped army and navy, opponents claimed he had actually voted against increasing the military's budget. As further evidence of his lack of trustworthiness, they pointed to his vote for William H. Crawford while serving as a presidential elector in 1816, even though Kentuckians were nearly unanimous in their support of James Monroe.|$|E
5|$|In 1684, the government, through Governor General Gabriel Curuscalegui, {{approved}} {{the collection of}} a tribute for five years for the <b>sole</b> <b>purpose</b> of constructing a stone church.

In 1840, Father Joaquin de Coria repaired the church, but because of a fire in 1851 which ravaged most of the town, Father Juan de Llanera fixed the damages to the church the following year. Father Juan de Dios de Villayos rebuilt the church roof and bell tower after it was damaged by an earthquake in 1881, and the church was rebuilt again in 1883 by Father Paulino Camba. Damaged by the earthquake of 1937, it was repaired again by Father Federico Diaz Pines with the help of the Confederation of United Catholics (Kapisanang Unidad Catolica). During World War II, the church suffered damage and was later renovated. A major repair was done from 1980 to 1984, when a story of the bell tower was rebuilt and the ceiling was renovated under the Parish Council of the Laity.|$|E
