From the exponential distribution of the lifetimes of the turbulent phases quantitative information on the vortex density L can be inferred such as the distribution and the width of the fluctuations of L. The phases of potential flow show a Rayleigh distribution of the excess oscillation amplitude above the amplitude at turbulent flow. The rms value is found to scale as omega^{- 3 / 2 }.

With these metal centers, phosphines are used quite often, as well as {{hydrogen}} and carbonyl ligands. The rhodium and iridium anions tend to be <b>slightly</b> <b>unstable</b> if the ligand is triphenylphosphine however, and quickly undergo reduction. If the PPh3 is instead replaced with DIOP (PPh2CH2CHO2)2C(CH3)2), stability is increased. The osmium complexes {{tend to be more}} stable than either Rh or Ir. Cobalt and ruthenium anions of these types also have stability issues. Osmium complexes are also able to form multiple Os center complexes such as: Os3(CO)7(PMe3)2(μ3-η2:η2:η2C60). Similarly Ir can form multicentered complexes, with more than one fullerene ligand.

Rhodium can also make these types of complexes, where it has been seen up to a cluster of six Rh atoms with two fullerene ligands such as: (C60)Rh6(C60).

40|$|Weather {{conditions}} are documented {{prior to and}} during the STS- 48 attempted landing at the Shuttle Landing Facility at KSC on 18 Sep. 1991. Trends in meteorological data during 17 and 18 Sep. are examined along with {{their relationship to the}} overall weather pattern observed over the KSC region. The primary weather problems during the landing were the formation of showers within 10 nautical miles of the SLF and any ceiling less than 10, 000 ft. The controlling factor of the weather was a high pressure ridge that was gradually weakening and moving off the northeast. As this occurred, the low level flow was switching from a easterly to a southeasterly direction. This change in wind direction was reflected by shower movement on the McGill radar and by trends in rawinsondes launched from the Cape. These rawinsondes also indicated that the boundary layers was becoming <b>slightly</b> more <b>unstable</b> several hours prior to the attempted landing which may have aided in the development of clouds and small isolated showers. Also, analyses of Doppler wind profiler and rawinsondes indicated a possible midlevel disturbance in the easterly flow pattern near 700 mb. This weak disturbance may have made the atmosphere a little more unstable early on 18 Sep. Finally, embedded within the southeasterly flow were several bands of low clouds. These clouds were rather difficult to see in unenhanced IR satellite imagery available to forecasters in real time. However, post analyses using several different enhancement curves, adapted from NESDIS, clearly reveals the presence of these clouds...|$|R
40|$|Coupled fibers are {{successfully}} fabricated by injecting {{hydrogen flow}} at 1 bar and fused <b>slightly</b> by <b>unstable</b> torch flame {{in the range}} of 800 - 1350 C. Optical parameters may vary significantly over wide range physical properties. Coupling coefficient and refractive index are estimated from the experimental result of the coupling ratio distribution from 1 % to 75 %. The change of structural and geometrical fiber affects the normalized frequency (V) even for single mode fibers. Coupling ratio as a function of coupling coefficient and separation of fiber axis changes with respect to V at coupling region. V is derived from radius, wavelength and refractive index parameters. Parametric variations are performed on the left and right hand side of the coupling region. At the center of the coupling region V is assumed constant. A partial power is modeled and derived using V, normalized lateral phase constant (Æ°), and normalized lateral attenuation constant, (w) through the second kind of modified Bessel function of the / order, which obeys the normal mode, LP 01 and normalized propagation constant (b). Total power is maintained constant in order to comply with the energy conservation law. The power is integrated through V, Æ° and w over the pulling length range of 7500 - 9500 Î¼m for 1 -D where radial and angle directions are ignored. The core radius of fiber significantly affects V and power partially at coupling region rather than wavelength and refractive index of core and cladding.
