5|$|I-280 {{continues}} to run {{just north of}} the railroad as a six-lane freeway through Harrison, reaching an interchange with CR 508. The road continues southeast through urban surroundings before turning east and passing to the north of a railroad yard, splitting from the railroad line as it runs into Kearny and enters the New Jersey Meadowlands. At the final interchange with CR 508, I-280 has access to the Holland Tunnel via Route 7, US 1/9 Truck and Route 139. Past CR 508, the freeway narrows to four lanes and comes to the toll plaza for the New Jersey Turnpike (I-95) at exit 15W, at which point I-280 ends. Full access is provided with the Western <b>Spur</b> <b>of</b> the New Jersey Turnpike, which carries through I-95 traffic; ramps to and from the north on the Eastern <b>Spur</b> <b>of</b> the New Jersey Turnpike allow for access to the Lincoln Tunnel via Route 495.|$|E
5|$|PA106 {{is one of}} five {{portions}} of the original U.S. Route 106 (US 106), a <b>spur</b> <b>of</b> US6 through Pennsylvania. US106 went from US6 in Wyalusing to the New York state line in Damascus Township along current-day PA652. The designation was eliminated in 1972 and replaced by PA106 from Kingsley to Carbondale, PA652 from Indian Orchard to Darbytown and PA706 from Wyalusing to Nichols.|$|E

The two highways merged to form SR174 in 1964 and a branch of SSH10B became the Crown Point <b>spur</b> <b>of</b> SR174. A second spur route, located in Leahy, was added in 2009.|$|E

5|$|The {{alignment}} of Route 18 through Middlesex County from Middlesex to Highland Park was first designated in the 1926 designing {{of a new}} highway system as State Highway Route S-29, a prefixed <b>spur</b> <b>of</b> New Jersey Route 29 (U.S. Route 22) through Middlesex County. The route followed Washington Avenue in Middlesex and the River Road in Piscataway until terminating at State Highway Route 27 near the Albany Street Bridge in Highland Park. By {{the time of the}} 1927 New Jersey state highway renumbering, the route was re-designated as State Highway Route S-28. This route was a prefixed <b>spur</b> <b>of</b> State Highway Route 28 in Middlesex, following Raritan Avenue and River Road through Piscataway and Highland Park, joining State Highway Route 27 on a concurrency into New Brunswick, and onto George Street in New Brunswick southward. After New Brunswick, Route S-28 continued southward through East Brunswick, Old Bridge and Browntown before terminating at State Highway Route 4 (U.S. Route 9) in Matawan.|$|E

Route 3 passes {{to the south of}} the Meadowlands Sports Complex and has access to Route 120, MetLife Stadium (the home stadium of the New York Giants and New York Jets of the National Football League), and the Meadowlands Racetrack in the eastbound direction and to MetLife Stadium and the Meadowlands Racetrack in the westbound direction. The route narrows back to six lanes and comes to a ramp which provides access to the western <b>spur</b> <b>of</b> the New Jersey Turnpike (Interstate 95). Route 3 interchanges with Route 120 and the carriageways separately. The route passes under the western <b>spur</b> <b>of</b> the New Jersey Turnpike and becomes eight lanes again.|$|E
5|$|Business Spur Interstate 96 (BS I-96) was a {{business}} <b>spur</b> <b>of</b> I-96 through the city of Portland. The western terminus was {{at the corner of}} Grand River Avenue and Kent Street in downtown Portland. From there the highway followed Grand River Avenue eastward through downtown and past businesses roughly parallel to the Looking Glass River. East of downtown, the spur turned southeasterly past another commercial area. The highway's eastern terminus was at exit77 south of the city.|$|E

Muigai was sufficiently wealthy that he could afford to keep several wives, each of whom lived in a separate nyom ba (woman's hut).|$|E
5|$|Near the Lake Ontario shoreline, NY18F {{connects to}} the Fort Niagara <b>spur</b> <b>of</b> the Niagara Scenic State Parkway via a partial diamond interchange. Only {{westbound}} access is permitted at the location; access to the eastbound spur, and thus the parkway mainline, is provided via NY93 in Youngstown or by NY18 farther east.

At the end of the north <b>spur</b> <b>of</b> the main hill is a mound that resembles a Buddhist stupa.
