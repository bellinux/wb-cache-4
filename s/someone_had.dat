5|$|Altgens was {{featured}} in two AP dispatches issued on November 22, 1963. He initially reported hearing two shots, but thought <b>someone</b> <b>had</b> been setting off fireworks. For a November 25 story, Altgens wrote {{that he did not}} know the origin of the gunshots until later, but he believed they came from the other side of Elm Street, opposite the presidential limousine from where he was standing.|$|E
5|$|Although sign theft {{has always}} been a problem along this highway, thefts reached {{epidemic}} proportions when the pending number change was announced. Within days of the announcement, virtually every US666 sign had been stolen, some for sale on eBay. Officials in Utah reported that five entire sign assemblies had been cut down with a chainsaw and stolen, while New Mexico officials reported that even signs welded to metal posts, as a theft deterrent, had been stolen. Officials speculated from one scene that <b>someone</b> <b>had</b> intentionally crashed a car into the sign post to break the welds.|$|E
5|$|The Giants {{played the}} Los Angeles Raiders in Los Angeles in week three. Joe Morris rushed for 110yards on 18 carries—the {{first time in}} 19 games <b>someone</b> <b>had</b> rushed for 100yards against the Raiders—and the Giants' defense held the Raiders to three field goals. Raiders running back Marcus Allen was held to 40yards on 15 carries, ending his then-NFL record 11 game 100yard rushing streak, and the Giants {{defeated}} the Raiders 14–9. The Raiders gained a total of 58 rushing yards, and committed nine penalties. Raiders' quarterback Jim Plunkett completed 21 of 41 passes for 281yards, and Phil Simms threw touchdown passes of 18 and 11yards to wide receiver Lionel Manuel.|$|E
5000|$|The causative {{morpheme}} {{can also}} be used recursively to generate indefinitely long words that are grammatically valid. This morpheme shows quite some irregularity, taking one of six forms depending on the verb root. Otherwise it alternates between -DIr (D=d or t, I=ı,i,u or ü) and -t depending on the preceding letter. piş-ir-di-ler = they cooked it piş-ir-t-ti-ler = they caused it to be cooked (they had it cooked) [...] piş-ir-t-tir-di-ler = they caused it to be caused to be cooked (they <b>had</b> <b>someone</b> <b>have</b> it cooked) piş-ir-t-tir-t-ti-ler = they caused it to be caused to be caused to be cooked (they <b>had</b> <b>someone</b> <b>have</b> <b>someone</b> <b>have</b> it cooked) piş-ir-t-tir-t-tir-di-ler = they caused it to be caused to be caused to be caused to be cooked (they <b>had</b> <b>someone</b> <b>have</b> <b>someone</b> <b>have</b> <b>someone</b> <b>have</b> it cooked)Multiple usage of this suffix is rare, but there is no theoretical reason to put a limit to its use.|$|R

Chuck then brings Ellie to Castle and demonstrates martial arts skills from the Intersect. When Chuck claims to be Agent X, the first human Intersect, Ellie informs him that, according to the laptop, <b>someone</b> <b>had</b> originally uploaded the Intersect to their brain before Chuck's birth. After Chuck repairs the computer, they find a redacted file on British scientist Hartley Winterbottom.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} three months of 1944, Cicero {{supplied}} the Germans with copies of documents taken from his employer's dispatch box or his safe. Photographs of top secret documents were generally handed over in Moyzisch's car, which was parked inconspicuously on an Ankara street. On one occasion, this led to a high-speed chase around Ankara as <b>someone</b> <b>had</b> taken an interest in the hand-over. Bazna, who had perhaps been tailed, escaped. Ultra, the British codebreaking system based at Bletchley Park routinely read German messages, coded by the Enigma machine. From that information, the codebreakers knew that there was an intelligence breach, but did not know that the source was the British Embassy in Turkey.|$|E
5|$|His {{schedule}} in the Olympics was busy. Along with the decathlon and pentathlon, he {{competed in the}} long jump and high jump. The first competition was the pentathlon. He won four of the five events and placed third in the javelin, an event he had not competed in before 1912. Although the pentathlon was primarily decided on place points, points were also earned for the marks achieved in the individual events. He won the gold medal. That same day, he qualified for the high jump final in which he placed fourth, and also took seventh place {{in the long jump}}. Even more remarkably, because <b>someone</b> <b>had</b> stolen his shoes just before he was due to compete, he found some discarded ones in a rubbish bin and won his medals wearing them.|$|E

5|$|Several facts {{point to}} a {{political}} motive behind the assassination. Leontovych's participation in the independence movement, such as commissioning Ukrainian Republic Capella, aimed at promoting Ukraine as an independent state, earned him many enemies. His older daughter Halyna later recalled her father saying, shortly before his death, that he had documents {{to leave the country}} to Romania, and that he had these documents with him among his sheet music during a concert. However, after returning from tea following the concert, Leontovych noticed that <b>someone</b> <b>had</b> gone through his papers. His plans to leave the country, along {{with the fact that he}} was killed by a Soviet agent, also indicate political reasons for his death.|$|E
5|$|Somehow King {{walked in}} {{the front door of the}} jail and a few minutes later out the back. King had {{arranged}} with Undersheriff Harry Woods (publisher of the Nugget) to sell the horse he had been riding to John Dunbar, Sheriff Behan's partner in the Dexter Livery Stable. On March 19, King conveniently escaped while Dunbar and Woods were making out the bill-of-sale. Woods claimed that <b>someone</b> <b>had</b> deliberately unlocked a secured back door to the jail. The Earps and the townspeople were furious at King's easy escape. Williams was later dismissed from Wells Fargo, leaving behind a number of debts, when it was determined he had been stealing from the company for years.|$|E
5|$|Van Peebles {{and several}} key crew members were armed {{because it was}} {{dangerous}} to {{attempt to create a}} film without the support of the union. One day, Van Peebles looked for his gun, and failed to find it. Van Peebles found out that <b>someone</b> <b>had</b> put it in the prop box. When they filmed the scene in which Beetle is interrogated by police, who fire a gun next to both of his ears, it was feared that the real gun would be picked up instead of the prop. While shooting a sequence with members of the Hells Angels, one of the bikers told Van Peebles they wanted to leave; Van Peebles responded by telling them they were paid to shoot until the scene was over. The biker took out a knife and started cleaning his fingernails with it. In response, Van Peebles snapped his fingers, and his crewmembers were standing there with rifles. The bikers stayed to shoot the scene.|$|E

40|$|Decades of {{feminism}} have freed women from many longstanding gender roles-less so, however, men. Women now wear pants, but men {{still do not}} wear dresses. Mothers of young children overwhelmingly work outside of the home, but male housewives remain rare. Tomboys have achieved some acceptance, but boys are still expected to be boys. Actresses needn 2 ̆ 7 t be sultry to be sexy, but actors are still taller, stronger and more silent than their sexual partners-except for Woody Allen. Perversely, the confluence of women 2 ̆ 7 s entry into the workplace {{with the death of}} social democracy resulted in recreating the American worker as a gendered, unencumbered bachelor. Women have been freed to be men, and men have been freed to be single. But <b>someone</b> <b>has</b> to wear the dresses, <b>someone</b> <b>has</b> to raise the children, <b>someone</b> <b>has</b> to go to work, <b>someone</b> <b>has</b> {{to take care of the}} old folks, and <b>someone</b> <b>has</b> to keep up the social calendar. So long as men are gendered into or out of some of these roles, women will be stuck with the rest, on overload. The next step of gender equality requires limiting market equality in order to loosen male gender roles...|$|R
5|$|After {{his arrival}} in New England, Wheelwright preached {{primarily}} to the Boston settlers who owned land at Mount Wollaston, still considered a part of Boston, but located about ten {{miles south of the}} Boston meetinghouse. Within months, <b>someone</b> <b>had</b> alerted magistrate John Winthrop, a lay person in the Boston church, that Wheelwright was harboring familist and antinomian doctrines. Familism, the theology of the Family of Love, involved one's perfect union with God under the Holy Spirit, coupled with freedom from both sin, and the responsibility for it. Antinomianism, or being freed from moral law under the covenant of grace, was a form of familism. Most of the New England Puritan ministers were adamantly opposed to these theological doctrines, seeing them as the cause of the violent and bloody ravages of the anabaptists in Germany during the Münster Rebellion of the 1530s. When confronted with accusations of familism, Wheelwright denied preaching such a doctrine. While Winthrop and many of the colony's ministers may have viewed Wheelwright as a familist, Cotton saw him as an orthodox minister.|$|E
5|$|Brown, though {{disappointed}} {{at being}} scooped, congratulated the Ortiz team on their discovery. He apologized for immediately overshadowing their announcement of Haumea with his announcement of Eris, {{and explained that}} <b>someone</b> <b>had</b> accessed their data and {{he was afraid of}} being scooped again. Ortiz did not volunteer to say that it had been he who accessed the data. Upon learning from web server records that it was a computer at the Sierra Nevada Observatory that had accessed his observation logs the day before the discovery announcement—logs which included enough information to allow the Ortiz team to precover Haumea in their 2003 images—Brown came to suspect fraud. He emailed Ortiz on August 9 and asked for an explanation. Ortiz did not respond, and on August 15 the Caltech team filed a formal complaint with the IAU, accusing the Ortiz team of a serious breach of scientific ethics in failing to acknowledge their use of the Caltech data, and asked the MPC to strip them of discovery status. Ortiz later admitted he had accessed the Caltech observation logs but denied any wrongdoing, stating this was merely part of verifying whether they had discovered a new object. Brown began to wonder if the Spanish team had actually identified Haumea at all before they saw his own abstract and telescope log.|$|E
5|$|The {{stone was}} already in a ruined state when Rogberg {{depicted}} the stone in 1763. Rogberg noted {{that it had been}} used as a bridge across a brook and because of this the runes had been worn down so much that most of them were virtually illegible, a statement that is contradicted by later depictions. Since the runestone had passed unnoticed by the runologists of the 17th century, it is likely that it was used as a bridge. In a traveller's journal written in 1792 by Hilfeling, the bottom part of the stone is depicted for the first time, though the artist {{does not appear to have}} realised that the two parts belonged together. In 1822, Liljegren arrived to depict it. A surviving yet unsigned drawing is attributed to Liljegren (see illustration). In 1922, the runologist Kinander learnt from a local farmer that some 40 years earlier, the runestone had been seen walled into a bridge that was part of the country road, and the inscription had been upwards. <b>Someone</b> <b>had</b> decided to remove the runestone from the bridge and put it beside the road. Kinander wanted to see the stone and was shown a large worn down stone in the garden of Eriksstad. However, according to Kinander it was not possible to find any remaining runes on what was supposed to be the runestone.|$|E

5|$|This theory {{stems from}} the various rumours {{spreading}} after Centaurs sinking. If Centaur had been in breach of the Hague Convention of 1907, and <b>someone</b> <b>had</b> informed the Japanese of this, I-177 may have been under valid orders to attack. When Centaur left Sydney, her decks were packed with green-uniformed men, and as Field Ambulance uniforms were only distinguishable from other Army uniforms by badge insignia and the colouration of the cloth band ringing the hat, a distant observer could {{have concluded that the}} hospital ship was transporting soldiers. Those witnessing the loading in Sydney would have seen the ambulance drivers bring their weapons aboard, and could have come to a similar conclusion. If a spy or informant had passed this information to the Japanese, I-177 could have been lying in wait. The main flaw in this theory is the question of how Nakagawa and his crew were able to predict that Centaur was taking an alternative route and how they were able to determine the new route selected.|$|E

25|$|In November 1953, Time {{magazine}} published evidence gathered variously by Kenneth Page Oakley, Sir Wilfrid Edward Le Gros Clark and Joseph Weiner {{proving that}} the Piltdown Man was a forgery and demonstrating that the fossil was {{a composite of}} three distinct species.
