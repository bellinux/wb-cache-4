The penetration degree of the ink pigment was RPS 1 < RPS 3 << RPS 2 << RP and the results were found to be related to the polar component of the surface energy. The ink penetration into the paper sheets was less pronounced for the papers with a higher surface polar character due to the stronger interactions between the water based ink and the <b>surface</b> <b>sizing</b> agents.

For this, hand sheets (100 GSM) of mixed recycled pulp containing 1 % cationic starch were prepared and were treated by the sizing agent on the sheet surface at various concentration (0, 3 - 10 %). Application and concentration increment of the starch solution caused its higher retention on the surface and lesser penetration into the paper structure (Z direction), contributed to the better hydrophobicity of <b>sized</b> <b>paper</b> and significantly reduction in water absorption of the paper, with the highest reduction in the Cobb test up to the solution concentration of 5 %.

Penetration of a part of sizing agent into the porous structure of paper and resulted improvement in fiber bonding are possible and probable, that higher concentration and viscosity of the starch solution contributed to the lesser penetration and bonding formation with higher retention on the paper surface which resulted in continuous improvement in paper smoothness. With the sizing solution thickening, tear index decreased due to starch film formation on the paper surface with brittle character.

Regarding chemical paper surface treatments, an important issue is {{the evaluation of the}} penetration of chemical compounds into the fibrous matrix, as the chemicals can potentially cause changes in the intrinsic properties of paper. The work presented here aimed to use Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy to study <b>paper</b> <b>surface</b> <b>sizing,</b> namely, the penetration of the sizing chemicals into the paper structure. Two different <b>surface</b> <b>sizing</b> formulations were applied to paper produced from Eucalyptus globulus bleached pulp (reference paper) : both contain 90 % (w/w) cationic starch, but one contains 10 % (w/w) poly(styrene-co-maleic anhydride) whereas the other contains 10 % (w/w) poly(styrene-co-butyl acrylate). The surface-sized paper sheets were further manually delaminated, so that the top surfaces as well as the internal layers could be analyzed by FT-IR spectroscopy.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} aimed at {{understanding}} and fully characterising the association mechanism of an alternating copolymer in water {{and the effect of}} the association in solution on the conformation of the polymer chains at the air/water interface. Self-assembly is an elegant and efficient method to obtain well defined and usually defect-free nano-architectures. The association, variety of shapes and properties of block copolymers have been extensively studied. The present study led to a precise understanding of the complex behaviour of large molecules. The polymer studied is an alternating copolymer; poly(styrene- alt-maleic anhydride) (SMA). This polymer has various applications ranging from <b>surface</b> <b>sizing</b> of <b>paper,</b> to nanotechnology and pharmaceutical applications. The detailed theoretical investigation of the SMA association led to the discovery of a novel way to self-assemble polymer chains, and the prediction and characterisation of a tubular structure formed by this association. The nanotubes are several micrometers long and their conformation shows that the hydrophobic groups are mainly located inside the tube and the hydrophilic groups are mainly on the exterior surface of the tube. The predicted tubular structure of SMA in solution was also confirmed by neutron scattering experiments. This study showed that the tubes interact forming two-dimensional sheets of tubes and higher order structures. In addition, the SMA association {{has been shown to be}} thermally stable. Furthermore, neutron reflectivity experiments were performed on the SMA solution to determine the influence of the association in solution on the conformation of the polymer at the air-water interface. This study revealed an equilibrium between the conformation of the polymer in solution and at the interface. Using the knowledge of the association mechanism obtained from the complete theoretical and experimental characterisation of the association of poly(styrene-maleic anhydride) in water and at the air-water interface, a novel application for the polymer has been developed. This application uses the template formed by the nanotubes to form nanowires of intrinsically conducting polymers.

40|$|That <b>surface</b> <b>size</b> has {{an impact}} on {{attention}} has been well-known in advertising research for almost a century; however, theoretical accounts of this effect have been sparse. To address this issue, we review studies on <b>surface</b> <b>size</b> effects on eye movements in this paper. While most studies find that large objects {{are more likely to be}} fixated, receive more fixations, and are fixated faster than small objects, a comprehensive explanation of this effect is still lacking. To bridge the theoretical gap, we relate the findings from this review to three theories of <b>surface</b> <b>size</b> effects suggested in the literature: a linear model based on the assumption of random fixations (Lohse, 1997), a theory of <b>surface</b> <b>size</b> as visual saliency (Pieters et al., 2007), and a theory based on competition for attention (Janiszewski, 1998).

In order to test the models against each other, we reanalyse data from an eye tracking study investigating <b>surface</b> <b>size</b> and saliency effects on attention. The reanalysis revealed little support for the first three theories while the demand for attention model showed a much better alignment with the data.

To better understand the phenomena, wetting on glass slides with a controlled level of heterogeneity was investigated. Also, partially hydrophobized glass capillaries were used to simulate capillary penetration into the pores on <b>sized</b> <b>paper.</b> Dynamic wetting on paper followed a power law model with a lower rate than wetting on a smooth surface. The chemical composition of the paper surface {{did not affect the}} wetting dynamics, which was mainly affected by surface roughness in a micron scale. The super-hydrophobic properties of the <b>sized</b> <b>papers</b> were due to air entrapment in the micron-scale roughness on the surface. Wetting and {{absorption of}} water droplets on <b>sized</b> <b>paper</b> occurred in different time scales. A pseudo-equilibrium contact angle was reached at the end of wetting just before absorption of water droplets. Increasing the surface coverage of the hydrophobic domains on <b>paper</b> by <b>sizing</b> increased the pseudo-equilibrium contact angle and delayed absorption into paper. This delay was related to partial dissolution of the <b>surface</b> <b>sizing</b> polymers in the water droplets on the surface. The equilibrium contact angle of water droplets on partially hydrophobized glass slides was a linear function of a characteristic dimension of the hydrophobic domains and the length of the three phase contact line. The dynamic rise of water in partially hydrophobized vertical capillaries followed two mechanisms. First, capillary rise was a function of the dynamic contact angle, changing with the velocity of the contact line. Second, local changes of the advancing contact angle due to the heterogeneities on the capillary walls lowered the capillary rise velocity. The stick (pause) and jump of the contact line was another effect of the hydrophobic domains. Capillary rise dynamics was a function of the advancing contact angle of water droplets measured on a flat glass slide with the same coverage of hydrophobic domains...|$|R

Decreasing the wetting {{of the sheet}} will also increase paper machine efficiency by {{reducing the number of}} web breaks. Also, the same afterdrying capacity can be used for both MSP coating and <b>surface</b> <b>sizing</b> at size solids contents of 20 %- 30 %. <b>Surface</b> <b>sizing</b> solids contents of up to 30 % have not been used due to the insufficient stability of starch at elevated solids contents and maintaining the binding power of the starch. Also the ability to maintain the amount of starch at the MSP application at very high solids contents has been lacking. Here, both the chemistry of the starch solutions and the application technology used needed to be developed in order to produce the desired applied starch amount at starch solids contents of up to 30 % with desired binding properties. The features of the base paper also needed to be adjusted to fit the features of high solids <b>surface</b> <b>sizing.</b> The findings of this study prove {{that it is possible to}} use a wide variety of starch viscosities and molecular weights even at increased solids contents. Increasing starch solids contents with more stable starches is therefore not restricted to highly degraded starches only with their lower binding power. When the solids content of the starch solution is increased from 8 % to 30 %, less starch penetrates into the sheet and more starch remains on the paper surface. The concentration of starch on the surface of paper decreases sheet porosity, oil absorption and internal strength, as well as increases its surface strength and bending stiffness. At very high solids contents internal strength behavior also suggests that starch may locally penetrate into the larger sheet pores. This observation is supported by pore size distribution analysis. The base paper for high solids <b>surface</b> <b>sizing</b> can also be optimized by adjusting the press to dryer web draw. Here, the aim could be to minimize the press draw below 2 % when internal strength or air permeability are critical. A method for obtaining more informative starch distribution curves was developed to provide a helpful tool in characterizing the effect of various process parameters on the z-distribution of starch in the sheet. An additional feature of this method is the definition of a dimensionless penetration number Qtot that can be used to quantitatively compare the penetration of <b>surface</b> <b>sizing</b> starch in different paper samples. A novel interpretation is presented of the role of <b>surface</b> <b>sizing</b> starch with respect to the elastic modulus and bending stiffness properties of the sheet. When increasing the elastic modulus or bending stiffness of the sheet, starch may merely promote shrinkage potential instead, which leads – when shrinkage is not allowed – to increased drying stress that, in turn, leads to an increase in the elastic modulus of the sheet and a further increase in bending stiffness. reviewe...|$|R
