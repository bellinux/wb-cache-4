50|$|THE <b>SOS</b> <b>chromotest</b> is {{considered}} to be the most simple and rapid short-term test for genotoxicity. It serves as a useful and cost effective complement to the traditional Ames test for a number of reasons. Firstly, because of its simplicity and rapidity, the <b>SOS</b> <b>chromotest</b> may be used as a screening test for a large number of potentially genotoxic compounds. Secondly, it may allow the detection of genotoxic chemicals which yield false negatives in the Ames test (such as estradiol, a compound of growing concern). Thirdly, it can prove an effective method to discriminate false positive results in the Ames test.|$|E
50|$|The <b>SOS</b> <b>chromotest</b> is a {{biological}} assay {{to assess the}} genotoxic potential of chemical compounds. The test is a colorimetric assay which measures the expression of genes induced by genotoxic agents in Escherichia coli, {{by means of a}} fusion with the structural gene for β-galactosidase. The test is performed over a few hours in columns of a 96-well microplate with increasing concentrations of test samples. This test was developed as a practical complement or alternative to the traditional Ames test assay for genotoxicity, which involves growing bacteria on agar plates and comparing natural mutation rates to mutation rates of bacteria exposed to potentially mutagenic compounds or samples. The <b>SOS</b> <b>chromotest</b> is comparable in accuracy and sensitivity to established methods such as the Ames test and is a useful tool to screen genotoxic compounds, which could prove carcinogenic in humans, in order to single out chemicals for further in-depth analysis.|$|E
50|$|The <b>SOS</b> <b>chromotest</b> {{consists}} of incubating the E. coli with increasing concentrations {{of the chemical}} to be tested. After allowing time for protein synthesis, β-galactosidase activity is assayed using a simple colorimetric assay. By including a lactose analog which yields a colored compound upon degradation, an easily observable or quantifiable change in colour {{is used as a}} metric. Since the chemical tested may inhibit protein synthesis at higher concentrations, which would lead to an underestimation of B-galactosidase induction, alkaline phosphatase is assayed simultaneously with β-galactosidase in order to scale the data to survivability of the cells.|$|E
50|$|Salmonella typhimurium TA 1535 1002 {{bacteria}} {{are exposed to}} potentially genotoxic test compounds in a 96-well microplate. If genotoxic lesions are produced in the bacterial genome, the umuC gene is induced {{as part of the}} general SOS response. The plasmid pSK1002 contains the umuC gene fused to the lacZ reporter gene, much like the fusion in the <b>SOS</b> <b>Chromotest.</b> The induction of the umuC-gene is thus a measure for the genotoxic potential of the sample. Since the umuC-gene is fused with the lacZ-gene for β-galactosidase, the induction of the umuC-gene can be easily assessed by determination of the β-galactosidase activity, measured by the conversion of a colorless ONPG substrate (o-nitrophenyl-β-D-galactopyranoside) to the yellow product o-nitrophenyl by the lacZ-encoded B-galactosidase.|$|E
50|$|The umu operon {{is useful}} {{as it is}} likely to be more {{involved}} in mutageneis than the other known SOS genes (Kato and Shinoura, 1977), and can be taken advantage of in the same way as the <b>SOS</b> <b>Chromotest.</b> Taking advantage of the operon fusion placing the lac operon (responsible for producing beta-galactosidase, a protein which degrades lactose) under the control of an SOS-related protein, a simple colorimetric assay for genotoxicity is possible. If a genotoxin is present, the resulting DNA damage will result in the production of beta-galactosidase instead of DNA repair as a result of the gene fusion. A lactose analog is added to the media which is degraded by the beta-galactosidase, producing a colored compound which can be measured quantitatively through spectrophotometry. The degree of color development is a direct measure of the amount of beta-galactosidase produce, which itself is directly related to the extent of DNA damage.|$|E
40|$|Three {{short-term}} assays (the <b>SOS</b> <b>chromotest,</b> the Ames-fluctuation {{test and}} the newt micronucleus test) were carried out to evaluate the genotoxicity of four trihalo-methanes (chloroform, bromodichloromethane, chlorodi-bromomethane and bromoform). With the <b>SOS</b> <b>chromotest,</b> all the chemicals studied except chloroform were found to induce primary DNA damage hi Escherichia coli PQ 37. In the Ames-fluctuation test, only bromoform showed mutagenic activity on Salmonella typhimurium strain TA 100. The newt micronucleus assay detected a clastogenic effect on the peripheral blood erythrocytes of Pleurodeles waltl larvae for bromodichloromethane and bromoform. It appeared {{that the presence of}} bromine substituent(s) generally led to significant genotoxic activity. Moreover, the use of the metabolic system significantly increased the genotoxicity of the brominated trihalomethanes in the <b>SOS</b> <b>chromotest</b> Unlike previous investigations in which the <b>SOS</b> <b>chromotest</b> was always the least interesting assay, this study exhibited the good efficiency of this in vitro test on E. coli for the detection of trihalomethanes with bromine substituents...|$|E

Their effects {{were compared with}} those induced by Cyclophosphamide. Two mutagenicity tests, the <b>SOS</b> <b>Chromotest</b> and cytogenetic analysis were applied. The tests were carried out with or without metabolic activation (addition of S 9 -mix), either in E. coli PQ 37 cultures, using four doses (0. 3, 3, 30 and 300 pmol compound/assay) for the <b>SOS</b> <b>Chromotest</b> or in leukocyte cultures using 0. 3 mM from each compound, for cytogenetics. The dose- response relationships and SOSIP values revealed an indirect mutagenic potential for Cyclophosphamide, amplified by S 9 mix in bacterial cultures and an antiproliferative, clastogenic effect on lymphocytes. For Romcis and diphenylantimony(III) diisopropyldithiophosphate, a significant positive response by <b>SOS</b> <b>Chromotest</b> was recorded, which correlated with increased frequencies of chromosomal aberrations...|$|E
40|$|We {{present and}} {{evaluate}} the <b>SOS</b> <b>chromotest,</b> a bacterial test for detecting DNA-damaging agents. It is a colorimetric assay based on the induction by these agents of the SOS function sfiA, whose level of expression is monitored {{by means of a}} sfiA::lacZ operon fusion. The response is rapid (a few hours), and does not require survival of the tester strain. Dose-response curves for various chemicals include a linear region. The slope of this region is taken as a measure of the SOS inducing potency. Comparison for a number of substances of known genotoxicity of the SOS inducing potency determined in the <b>SOS</b> <b>chromotest</b> with the mutagenic potency determined in the Salmonella assay (mutatest) revealed a striking quantitative correlation over more than 7 orders of magnitude. The sensitivity of the <b>SOS</b> <b>chromotest</b> (lowest amount detected) is equal to that of the mutatest and generally 4 - 40 times higher than that of a phage induction assay (inductest). From a practical point of view our observations contribute to the validation of the <b>SOS</b> <b>chromotest</b> as a test for detecting genotoxins and in particular genotoxic carcinogens. From a theoretical standpoint the results suggest that mutagenic potency measured in the mutatest reflects the level of induction of an SOS function and that most genotoxins are inducers of the SOS response in bacteria...|$|E
40|$|In this work, the {{toxicity}} and genotoxicity of organic solvents (acetone, carbon tetrachloride, dichloromethane, dimethylsulfoxide, ethanol, ether and methanol) were studied using the <b>SOS</b> <b>chromotest.</b> The influence of these solvents on the direct genotoxicity {{induced by the}} mutagens mitomycin C (MMC) and 4 -nitroquinoline- 1 -oxide (4 -NQO) were also investigated. None of the solvents were genotoxic in Escherichia coli PQ 37. However, based on the inhibition of protein synthesis assessed by constitutive alkaline phosphatase activity, some solvents (carbon tetrachloride, dimethylsulfoxide, ethanol and ether) were toxic and incompatible with the <b>SOS</b> <b>chromotest.</b> Solvents that were neither toxic nor genotoxic to E. coli (acetone, dichloromethane and methanol) significantly reduced the genotoxicity of MMC and 4 -NQO. When these solvents were used to dissolve vitamin E they increased the antigenotoxic activity of this compound, possibly through additive or synergistic effects. The relevance of these results is discussed in relation to antigenotoxic studies. These data indicate the need for careful selection of an appropriate diluent for the <b>SOS</b> <b>chromotest</b> since some solvents can modulate genotoxicity and antigenotoxicity...|$|E

40|$|The {{genotoxic}} {{effects of}} 11 monofunctional alkylating carcinogens in the Escherichia coli Multitest, <b>SOS</b> <b>Chromotest</b> and Salmonella assay were quantified using the 'yield versus lethal hit plot ' method. In this method, the genotoxic yield-potency {{is defined as}} the integral under the yield versus lethal hit curve, whereas the genotoxic yield-efficiency {{is defined as the}} maximum yield obtained. With the series of substances tested, these two genotoxicity indices were found to be equivalent in the E. coli Multitest. The three bacterial short-term tests were compared and the following observations made: (i) the mutagenic efficiencies in the Salmonella assay and in the Multitest are correlated; (ii) the SOS-inducing efficiency in the <b>SOS</b> <b>Chromotest</b> correlates with both the SOS-inducing efficiency and the recombinogenk efficiency in the Multitest; (iii) mutagenesis and SOS induction measured by the same protocol in the Multitest are clearly distinct phenomena; (iv) when quantified with the 'yield versus lethal hit plot ' method, the data from the <b>SOS</b> <b>Chromotest</b> do not correlate any more with the data from the Salmonella assay. Therefore the <b>SOS</b> <b>Chromotest</b> should be considered as a complementary rather than an alternative test to the Salmonella assay. Consequently, the Multitest appears as a relevant candidate for the basis of a battery of tests since it permits the measurement of at least two independent genotoxic effects in a single bacterial system. The method of quantification of genotoxic potencies using the 'yield versus lethal hit plot ' method demonstrates the quantitative relation-ships existing between the data obtained using different systems measuring the same genotoxic effect and differentiates different genotoxic effects from each other...|$|E

40|$|Three {{short-term}} assays (the <b>SOS</b> <b>chromotest,</b> the Ames-fluctuation {{test and}} the newt micronucleus test) were carried out to evaluate the genotoxicity of six halogenated acetonitriles identified in chlorinated waters (monochloro-, dichloro-, trichloro-, monobromo-, dibromo- and bromochloroacetonitrile). With the <b>SOS</b> <b>chromotest,</b> three of the chemicals studied (dichloro-, dibromo- and bromochloroacetonitrile) were found to induce primary DNA damage in Escherichia coli PQ 37. In the Ames-fluctuation test, all the compounds except dibromoacetonitrile showed muta- genic activity on Salmonella typhimurium strain TA 100. The newt micronucleus assay detected a clastogenic effect on the peripheral blood erythrocytes of Pleurodeles waltl larvae for all the six haloacetonitriles studied. Moreover, two structure-activity relationships were noted: (l) the genotoxic activity of haloacetonitriles containing bromine substituents appeared higher than the corresponding chlorinated acetonitriles and (2) the clastogenic activity of the chlorinated acetonitriles increased {{with the number of}} chlorine substituents...|$|E
40|$|The present work {{evaluated}} the chemical composition and the DNA protective {{effect of the}} essential oils (EOs) from Lippia alba against bleomycin-induced genotoxicity.

For this intent, two prokaryotic test systems were used: the <b>SOS</b> <b>chromotest</b> and the Ames test. No metabolization with S 9 was investigated, since only the direct effects of the substances and materials were surveyed. Most of the substances and materials tested presented mild to moderate cytotoxicity and genotoxicity as revealed by the <b>SOS</b> <b>chromotest.</b> Formocresol was the only tested substance to present severe genotoxicity to the tester bacterial strains.

The results confirmed the strong SOS inducing activity of 2 -aminoanthracene and benzo[a]pyrene with metabolic activation and N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine, mitomycin C and 4 -nitroquinoline-N-oxide without metabolic activation. A weaker response {{in the absence of}} microsomal enzymes was observed with hydroxyurea (only at high doses) and the soluble Cr(VI) compounds potassium chromate and potassium dichromate. No effect was observed with ampicillin, cadmium chloride, cyclophosphamide, griseofulvin, the insoluble Cr(VI) compound lead chromate, the soluble Cr(III) compounds chromium nitrate, chromium chloride, chromium potassium sulphate, and the chelating agent sodium nitrilotriacetate. Among the Cr(III) compounds only chromium acetate produced a low but significant increase of SOS inducing activity. Solubilization by nitrilotriacetate of genotoxic Cr(VI) from insoluble lead chromate was observed, whereas no interaction occurred between nitrilotriacetate and the soluble Cr(VI) and Cr(III) compounds. Using urinary XAD- 2 extracts, we found the <b>SOS</b> <b>Chromotest</b> poorly sensitive to the mutagens present in urine from tobacco smokers which, on the other hand, were detected by the gene mutation assay in Salmonella typhimurium (Ames test). A urine sample obtained from a psoriatic patient, therapeutically treated with mineral coal tar, had a significant SOS inducing activity with and even without metabolic activation, whereas in the Ames test it was active only in the presence of metabolic activation.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Toxicity of cyanobacterial blooms, an {{increasing}} problem around the world, {{is connected to}} the increase in bloom samples containing microcystins, caused by excessive eutrophication of drinking-and recreational water reservoirs. Microcystins are the most common group of cyanobacterial hepato-toxins. In Poland they are produced mainly by the Microcystis genus. The toxicity of microcystins has been well documented, but investigation into their genotoxicity has been insufficient relative to the study of their overall toxicity. Therefore, the aim of this study was the estimation and comparison of the genotoxicity of cyanobacterial extracts with microcystins (CEMs) using the <b>SOS</b> <b>chromotest</b> (bacterial test) with Escherichia coli PQ 37 and the comet assay with human lymphocytes. Cyanobacterial bloom samples were collected in the summer months from two Polish water reservoirs, one at Sulejów and one at Jeziorsko. The <b>SOS</b> <b>chromotest,</b> which used prokaryotic cells (without metabolic activation), and the comet assay, which used eukaryotic cells, both indicated the potential genotoxic effect of CEMs. Cyanobacterial extracts caused DNA damage in human lymphocytes in vitro. The maximum level of DNA damage was observed after 12 h incubation with CEMs. The bacterial test indicated a dependence of the degree of CEM genotoxicity, the composition, and the concentration of microcystins in each bloom sample examined with the time of exposure. Differences between the genotoxicity of cyanobacterial extract and the standard microcystin-LR were noticeable. This was probably caused by the interaction o...|$|E

40|$|International audienceAntioxidant {{activity}} of isorhamnetin 3 -O-neohesperidoside, {{isolated from the}} leaves of Acacia salicina, {{was determined by the}} ability of this compound to inhibit xanthine oxidase activity and to scavenge the free radical 2, 2 ′-azino-bis (3 -ethylbenzthiazoline- 6 -sulfonic acid) (ABTS. −) diammonium salt. Antigenotoxic activity was assessed using the <b>SOS</b> <b>chromotest</b> assay. This compound has the ability to scavenge the ABTS. + radical by a hydrogen donating mechanism. We also envisaged the study of the antioxidant effect of this compound by the enzymatic xanthine/xanthine oxidase (X/XOD) assay. Results indicated that isorhamnetin 3 -O-neohesperidoside was a potent inhibitor of xanthine oxidase and superoxide anion scavengers. Moreover, this compound induced an inhibitory activity against nifuroxazide and aflatoxine B 1 (AFB 1) induced genotoxicity. Taken together, these observations provide evidence that isorhamnetin 3 -O-neohesperidoside isolated from the leaves of A. salicina is able to protect cells against the consequences of oxidative stress.

40|$|Il est admis aujourd'hui que la génotoxicité identifiée dans les extraits d'eau potable provient principalement de l'action du chlore sur la matière organique naturelle qui donne naissance à des dérivés organohalogénés. Dans le présent travail, nous avons comparé la sensibilité de trois essais de génotoxicité (<b>SOS</b> <b>chromotest,</b> test d'Ames-fluctuation et test micronoyau triton) lors de l'étude de composés organohalogénés, d'acides fulviques chlorés et d'échantillons d'eau (non concentrés) en cours de {{traitement}} de potabilisation. Les composés organohalogénés étudiés sont 4 trihalométhanes, 5 acétonitriles et 5 chloropropanones identifiés dans l'eau potable ou dans des solutions de substances humiques chlorées. Les résultats obtenus révèlent que le <b>SOS</b> <b>chromotest</b> est globalement le moins sensible des trois essais et que le test d'Ames-fluctuation et le test micronoyau triton permettent généralement de détecter les plus faibles concentrations de composés génotoxiques. Les essais ont également permis de démontrer que {{la nature}} des substituants halogénés (brome ou chlore), le nombre et la position des atomes de chlore influencent notablement la génotoxicité des composés organohalogénés. Toutefois, les résultats obtenus indiquent qu'aucun des trois tests réalisés n'est suffisant à lui seul pour détecter l'ensemble des produits génotoxiques. Ces observations confirment la nécessité de réaliser une batterie de tests qui mette en oeuvre divers types cellulaires et différents systèmes de métabolisation, et détecte divers évènements de génotoxicité. Les travaux portant sur les solutions concentrées d'acides fulviques chlorés montrent l'intérêt des essais sur bactéries (particulièrement le test d'Ames-fluctuation) pour la détection rapide de l'activité génotoxique de ces solutions. L'étude concemant les échantillons d'eau prélevés à différents niveaux d'une station de potabilisation, et analysés sans concentration préalable, indique que le test d'Ames- fluctuation est le seul capable de détecter une activité génotoxique dans les échantillons non concentrés étudiés. On montre, conformément à la littérature, que l'activité mutagène observée résulte de la chloration de l'eau. Since {{the identification of}} organohalides in drinking water in 1974, several investigators have detected genotoxic activity in drinking water concentrates. It is now widely admitted that the observed genotoxicity originates mainly from the reaction of chlorine on natural organic matter contained in the raw water, {{which leads to the}} formation of organohalogenated compounds. The aim {{of this study is to}} show the benefit of three short-term assays for the evaluation of the genotoxic potency of organohalogenated compounds and of complex mixtures. In a wider context, the purpose is to identify a test or a battery of tests that can contribute to the control of natural and drinking water genotoxicity. The three genotoxicity assays carried out during this work were:- the <b>SOS</b> <b>chromotest,</b> a primary DNA damage in vitro assay on Escherichia coli; - the Ames- fluctuation test, a point mutation in vitro assay on Salmonella typhimurium; - and the newt micronucleus test, a chromosomal aberration in vivo assay on the amphibian Pleurodeles waltl. These assays display a valuable advantage: the water samples under study can be analyzed without concentration prior to testing. Thus, the different concentration procedures, which may modify the original genotoxicity of the water samples, are avoided. A previous study on seven reference genotoxic chemicals had indicated that the <b>SOS</b> <b>chromotest</b> was never the most sensitive of the three tests (for a given chemical, the most sensitive assay is defined as the test which detects the lowest concentration inducing a significant genotoxic effect). On the contrary, the Ames-fluctuation test proved to be the most sensitive for compounds showing direct genotoxic activity, and the newt micronucleus test the most sensitive for chemicals with indirect genotoxic effects. None of the assays was the most sensitive for every substance analyzed. These observations suggested the need to implement a battery of tests using several cell types, different metabolization systems and detecting several genotoxicity events. This earlier study also showed, in accord with several results in the literature, that the Ames-fluctuation test (in liquid medium) demonstrated a better sensitivity than the Ames test (in agar solid medium). The first part of the present study involved testing the genotoxicity of 14 organo- halogenated compounds identified in drinking water samples or in chlorinated humic matter samples. The chemicals studied were four chlorinated and/or brominated trihalomethanes (trichloro-, bromodichloro-, chlorodibromo- and tribromomethane), five chlorinated or brominated acetonitriles with one, two or three halogens (monochloro-, dichloro-, trichloro-, monobromo- and dibromoacetonitrile) and five chlorinated propanones with one, two or three substitutions on one or two carbon atoms (monochloro-, 1, 1 -dichloro-, 1, 3 -dichloro-, 1, 1, 1 -trichloro- and 1, 1, 3 - trichloropropanone). Although the <b>SOS</b> <b>chromotest</b> was the most sensitive for 3 of the 14 substances analyzed, the results confirmed that this test was globally the least sensitive; the Ames-fluctuation test and the newt micronucleus test remained the most efficient assays. It is interesting to note that the Ames-fluctuation test appeared the most sensitive for all the chloropropanones tested and the newt micronucleus test, for all the haloacetonitriles analyzed. Moreover, several structure-activity relationships were demonstrated: the nature of the halogenated substituents (bromine or chlorine), the number and, above all, the position of chlorine atoms strongly influenced the genotoxicity of the organohalides studied. In the second part of the work we analyzed the effects of complex mixtures containing several organohalogenated compounds: the three tests were performed on two chlorinated fulvic acids of different origin. Pornic fulvic acid was extracted from a surface water reservoir used to produce drinking water in Vendée (France) and Pinail fulvic acid came from a forest pond near Poitiers (France). The total organic carbon was about 1 g/l in the solution subjected to chlorination and the molar chlorination ratio was 1. 5 Cl 2 /C. The results showed the advantage of tests using bacteria: the Ames fluctuation test was the only assay able to detect the genotoxicity of both chlorinated fulvic acids; the <b>SOS</b> <b>chromotest</b> detected the genotoxic effect of only one of the chlorinated fulvic acids (Pinail). In contrast, the newt micronucleus test did not show any genotoxicity of the chlorinated fulvic acids. However, it must be pointed out that, as insufficient fulvic acid was available, the genotoxic potency of these solutions on the newt was not tested under adequate conditions (e. g., subchronic concentrations were not studied). Nevertheless, the concentrations of fulvic acid analyzed were very close to those found in the aquatic environment. The last part of the study attempted to approximate environmental and human exposure conditions: the three tests were performed on four water samples taken at several stages of a drinking water treatment plant. These samples were analyzed for genotoxicity in the three test systems without preconcentration. The plant studied is characterized by the following treatment steps: - coagulation-flocculation; - chlorination at 6 g Cl 2 /m 3; - sand filtration; - ozonation at 1. 9 g O 3 /m 3; - final chlorination at 1. 4 g Cl 2 /m 3 before sending the treated water into the distribution system. The four samples were taken: 1. before any treatment (raw water, 10 to 13 mg total organic carbon per liter), 2. between the sand layer filter and the ozonator (chlorinated water), 3. after the ozonator (ozonated water), 4. and at the end of the treatment process (treated water). The results obtained confirmed the advantage of the Ames fluctuation test, which was the only assay able to detect a genotoxic activity in the unconcentrated water samples studied. Regarding the influence of the different chemical treatments on the mutagenicity observed, it was demonstrated that the first chlorination step led to the formation of direct-acting mutagens. The treatment with ozone, at the rate used, did not significantly modify the mutagenicity of the samples that had previously been chlorinated. Similarly, the second chlorination step did not significantly increase the direct mutagenicity detected. Practically, our study indicated that the Ames-fluctuation test is the only assay, among the three performed that is able to contribute efficiently to the control of drinking water genotoxicity. In this context, the benefit of the <b>SOS</b> <b>chromotest</b> appears only in case of accidental pollution: indeed, it is the only test able to yield results within 24 hours. The implementation of the newt micronucleus test could be useful for the control of natural or drinking water genotoxicity in case of extensive pollution...|$|E
40|$|The {{relationship}} between toxicity and soil contamination {{must be understood}} to develop reliable indicators of environmental restoration for bioremediation. Two bacterial rapid bioassays: <b>SOS</b> <b>chromotest</b> and umu-test with and without metabolic activation (S- 9 mixture) were used to evaluate genotoxicity of petroleum hydrocarbon-contaminated soil following bioremediation treatment. The soil was taken from an engineered biopile at the Czor Polish oil refinery. The bioremediation process in the biopile lasted 4 years, and the toxicity measurements were done after this treatment. Carcinogens detected in the soil, polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), were reduced to low concentrations (2 mg/kg dry wt) by the bioremediation process. Genotoxicity was not observed for soils tested with and without metabolic activation by a liver homogenate (S- 9 mixture). However, umu-test was more sensitive than SOS-chromotest {{in the analysis of}} petroleum hydrocarbon-bioremediated soil. Analytical results of soil used in the bioassays confirmed that the bioremediation process reduced 81 percent of the petroleum hydrocarbons including PAHs. We conclude that the combined test systems employed in this study are useful tools for the genotoxic examination of remediated petroleum hydrocarbon-contaminated soil...|$|E
40|$|Echinodorus macrophyllus, {{commonly}} known as chapéu-de-couro, is a medicinal plant used in folk medicine to treat inflammation and rheumatic diseases. In this work, we used short-term bacterial assays based on the induction of SOS functions to examine the genotoxicity and mutagenicity of an aqueous extract of E. macrophyllus leaves. Whole extract and an ethyl acetate fraction showed similar genotoxicity and caused an ~ 70 -fold increase in lysogenic induction. The extract also gave a positive result in the <b>SOS</b> <b>chromotest</b> with an increase of 12 -fold in &# 946;-Galactosidase enzymatic units. There was a strong trend towards base substitutions and frameshifts at purine sites in the mutations induced by the extract in Escherichia coli (CC 103 and CC 104 strains) and Salmonella typhimurium test strains (22 -fold increase in histidine revertants in TA 98 strain). Since reactive oxygen species may be implicated in aging process and in degenerative diseases, we used antioxidant compounds as catalase, thiourea and dipyridyl in the lysogenic induction test. All this compounds were able to reduce the induction factor observed in the treatment with chapéu-de-couro, thus suggesting that the genotoxicity and mutagenicity were attributable {{to the production of}} reactive oxygen species that targeted DNA purines...|$|E
