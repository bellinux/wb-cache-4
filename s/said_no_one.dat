500|$|According to Metamorphoses, the {{initiation}} [...] "was {{performed in the}} manner of voluntary death and salvation obtained by favor." [...] Only Isis herself could determine who should be initiated and when; thus, Lucius only begins preparing for the mysteries after Isis appears to him in a dream. The implication that Isis was thought to command her followers directly is supported by the Greek writer Pausanias, writing in the same era as Apuleius, who <b>said</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> was allowed to participate in Isis' festivals in her shrine at Tithorea without her inviting them in a dream, and by inscriptions in which priests of Isis write that she called them to become her servants. In Apuleius's description, the goddess also determines how much the initiate must pay to the temple in order to undergo the rites.|$|E
500|$|From its beginning, the Sunday Expresss {{campaign}} {{drew the}} attention of other papers. Some backed Douglas, including the Sunday Chronicle, The People and Truth. The Daily News and Westminster Gazette ran a review that, without commenting on Douglas's action, said the novel [...] "present as a martyr {{a woman in the}} grip of a vice". Most of the British press defended The Well. The Nation suggested that the Sunday Express had only started its campaign because it was August, the journalistic silly season when good stories are scarce. Country Life and Lady's Pictorial both ran positive reviews. Arnold Dawson of the Daily Herald, a Labour newspaper, called Douglas a [...] "stunt journalist"; he <b>said</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> would give the book to a child, no child would want to read it, and any who did would find nothing harmful. Dawson also printed a scathing condemnation of the Home Office by H. G. Wells and George Bernard Shaw and started a counter-campaign that helped Hall obtain statements of support from the National Union of Railwaymen and the South Wales Miners' Federation.|$|E

The two of them [...] "hung out" [...] a few times, resulting in Emma being pregnant with Henry {{before she went to}} jail. Once there, she tried to tell him about Henry, only to discover that he had died while saving a family from a burning building. However, she later admits to Mary the story she gave Henry was a lie and he should never know the truth about his father. After Emma's reunion of the children with Michael that evening, Henry arrived with pumpkin pie to give Emma in order to thank her for explaining about his birth father. They are interrupted by a stranger (Eion Bailey) on a motorcycle with a unique box. Without giving his name, he asks Emma about finding a place to stay. After referring him to Granny's Bed & Breakfast, she reminds Henry that he <b>said</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> else ever comes to or leaves Storybrooke and Henry replies that they don't.|$|E
500|$|Carey {{performed}} [...] "Obsessed" [...] {{on several}} televised appearances since its release. On August 5, 2009, Carey performed the song {{live for the}} first time on the fourth season of the talent competition, America's Got Talent. Carey, appearing in jeans and a black top, was accompanied by several male dancers and three back-up singers. As she performed the song, the dancers hoisted her into the air several times, and carried her to several areas on the stage. During the performance, several white lights flashed, while monitors behind the dancers showed images of Carey and the video. Breanne Heldman from E! Entertainment Television criticized several aspects of the performance. She described the lighting as [...] "anxiety inducing", and wrote, [...] "That <b>said,</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> is doubting the singer's impressive set of pipes, but—frighteningly jarring lighting and quick edits aside—did she actually utilize them on 'America's Got Talent' last night?" [...] Aside from questioning the singers live vocals, she also felt Carey seemed [...] "robotic", and didn't show effort or interest in the performance. A reviewer from Idolator also was critical on the performance, asking if there was [...] "anything good about [...] ". He claimed Carey was lip-syncing, and described it as [...] "lackadaisical", and wrote, [...] "the backup dancers’ moves would have probably received a big red 'X' from at least one of the judges." ...|$|E

2500|$|It is {{unlikely}} any Native American recognized Custer {{during or after}} the battle. Michno summarizes: [...] "Shave Elk said 'We did not suspect that we were fighting Custer and did not recognize him either alive or dead.' Wooden Leg <b>said</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> could recognize any enemy during the fight, for they were too far away. The Cheyennes {{did not even know}} a man named Custer was in the fight until weeks later. Antelope said none knew of Custer being at the fight until they later learned of it at the agencies. Thomas Marquis learned from his interviews that no Indian knew Custer was at the Little Bighorn fight until months later. Many Cheyennes were not even aware that other members of the Custer family had been in the fight until 1922, when, Marquis said, he himself first informed them of that fact." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1956 Steiner {{returned}} to the United States, where for two years he was a scholar at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. He also held a Fulbright professorship in Innsbruck, Austria from 1958 to 1959. In 1959, he was appointed Gauss Lecturer at Princeton, where he lectured for another two years. [...] He then became a founding fellow of Churchill College at the University of Cambridge in 1961. Steiner was initially not well received at Cambridge by the English faculty. Many disapproved of this charismatic [...] "firebrand with a foreign accent" [...] and questioned {{the relevance of the}} Holocaust he constantly referred to in his lectures. Bryan Cheyette, professor of 20th-century literature at the University of Southampton said that at the time, [...] "Britain [...] didn't think it had a relationship to the Holocaust; its mythology of the war was rooted in the Blitz, Dunkirk, the Battle of Britain." [...] While Steiner received a professorial salary, he was never made a full professor at Cambridge with the right to examine. He had the option of leaving for professorships in the United States, but Steiner's father objected, saying that Hitler, who <b>said</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> bearing their name would be left in Europe, would then have won. Steiner remained in England because [...] "I'd do anything rather than face such contempt from my father." [...] He was elected an Extraordinary Fellow at Cambridge in 1969.|$|E
