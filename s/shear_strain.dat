25|$|Shear {{strength}} {{is a term}} used in soil mechanics to describe {{the magnitude of the}} shear stress that a soil can sustain. The shear resistance of soil is a result of friction and interlocking of particles, and possibly cementation or bonding at particle contacts. Due to interlocking, particulate material may expand or contract in volume as it is subject to shear strains. If soil expands its volume, the density of particles will decrease and the strength will decrease; in this case, the peak strength would be followed by a reduction of shear stress. The stress-strain relationship levels off when the material stops expanding or contracting, and when interparticle bonds are broken. The theoretical state at which the shear stress and density remain constant while the <b>shear</b> <b>strain</b> increases may be called the critical state, steady state, or residual strength.|$|E

40|$|In the {{classical}} plate theory, {{it is assumed}} that the plane cross sections initially normal to the plate midsurface before deformation remain plane and normal to that surface during deformation. This is the result of neglecting the transverse <b>shear</b> <b>strains.</b> However, in thick and moderately thick laminated plates, significant transverse <b>shear</b> <b>strains</b> occur, and the theory gives inaccurate results for the plates. So, {{it is obvious that the}} <b>shear</b> <b>strains</b> have to be taken into account. There are numerous theories of plates and laminated plates that include the transverse <b>shear</b> <b>strains.</b> One of them is the Reissner and Midlin theory, known as the first-order shear deformation theory, which defines the displacement field as linear variations of midplane displacements. This theory, where the relation between the resultant shear forces and the <b>shear</b> <b>strains</b> is obtained by using shear correction factors, has some advantages due to its simplicity and low computational cost. Some other plate theories, namely the higher-order shear deformation theories, include the effect of transverse <b>shear</b> <b>strains.</b> For example, the theory developed by Reddy allows not only for the transverse <b>shear</b> <b>strains,</b> but also for parabolic variations in the strains across the plate thickness, and thus there is no need to use shear correction coefficients in computing the shear stresses. The present stud is a survey of plate bending of cross-ply laminate by using the finite element method (F. E. M).

2500|$|But in {{addition}} to friction, soil derives significant shear resistance from interlocking of grains. [...] If the grains are densely packed, the grains tend to spread apart from {{each other as they}} are subject to <b>shear</b> <b>strain.</b> The expansion of the particle matrix due to shearing was called dilatancy by Osborne Reynolds. If one considers the energy required to shear an assembly of particles there is energy input by the shear force, T, moving a distance, x and there is also energy input by the normal force, N, as the sample expands a distance, y. [...] Due to the extra energy required for the particles to dilate against the confining pressures, dilatant soils have a greater peak strength than contractive soils. Furthermore, as dilative soil grains dilate, they become looser (their void ratio increases), and their rate of dilation decreases until they reach a critical void ratio. Contractive soils become denser as they shear, and their rate of contraction decreases until they reach a critical void ratio.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{the above}} {{equations}} {{are the most}} used form in literature, some comments about the notation are necessary. Generally, D and E are vectors, that is, Cartesian tensors of rank 1; and permittivity ε is a Cartesian tensor of rank 2. Strain and stress are, in principle, also rank-2 tensors. But conventionally, because strain and stress are all symmetric tensors, the subscript of strain and stress can be relabeled in the following fashion: 11→1; 22→2; 33→3; 23→4; 13→5; 12→6.
