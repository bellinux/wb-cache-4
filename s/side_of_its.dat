5|$|The European Super Cup {{was founded}} in the early 1970s, {{as a means to}} {{determine}} the best team in Europe and serve as a challenge to Ajax, the strongest club <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> day. The proposal by Dutch journalist Anton Witkamp, a football match between the holders of the European Cup and Cup Winners' Cup, failed to receive UEFA's backing, given the recent Cup Winners' Cup winners Rangers had been banned from European competition. Witkamp nonetheless proceeded with his vision, a two-legged match played between Ajax and Rangers in January 1973. The competition was endorsed and recognised by UEFA a year later.|$|E

5|$|In Roman Egypt {{during the}} 2nd century CE, Claudius Ptolemaeus (Ptolemy) {{attempted}} {{to address the}} problem of the orbital motion of Mars. Observations of Mars had shown that the planet appeared to move 40% faster on one <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> orbit than the other, in conflict with the Aristotelian model of uniform motion. Ptolemy modified the model of planetary motion by adding a point offset from the center of the planet's circular orbit about which the planet moves at a uniform rate of rotation. He proposed that the order of the planets, by increasing distance, was: the Moon, Mercury, Venus, Sun, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and the fixed stars. Ptolemy's model and his collective work on astronomy was presented in the multi-volume collection Almagest, which became the authoritative treatise on Western astronomy for the next fourteen centuries.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 12th century, Philip Augustus {{extended}} the Louvre fortress {{to defend the}} city against river invasions from the west, gave the city its first walls between 1190 and 1215, rebuilt its bridges to either <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> central island, and paved its main thoroughfares. In 1190, he transformed Paris' former cathedral school into a student-teacher corporation that would become the University of Paris and would draw students from all of Europe.During the Hundred Years' War, Paris was occupied by England-friendly Burgundian forces from 1418, before being occupied outright by the English when Henry V of England entered the French capital in 1420; {{in spite of a}} 1429 effort by Joan of Arc to liberate the city, it would remain under English occupation until 1436.|$|E

5|$|Loggerhead {{sea turtles}} {{observed}} in captivity {{and in the}} wild are most active during the day. In captivity, the loggerheads' daily activities are divided between swimming and resting on the bottom. While resting, they spread their forelimbs to about midstroke swimming position. They remain motionless with eyes open or half-shut and are easily alerted during this state. At night, captives sleep {{in the same position}} with their eyes tightly shut, and are slow to react. Loggerheads spend up to 85% of their day submerged, with males being the more active divers than females. The average duration of dives is 15–30 min, but they can stay submerged for up to four hours. Juvenile loggerheads and adults differ in their swimming methods. A juvenile keeps its forelimbs pressed to the <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> carapace, and propels itself by kicking with its hind limbs. As the juvenile matures, its swimming method is progressively replaced with the adult's alternating-limb method. They depend entirely on this method of swimming by one year old.|$|E
5|$|MD 410's name becomes EastWest Highway {{again as}} it heads east from MD 650 as a four-lane {{undivided}} highway through {{the northern part}} of Chillum. The highway has frontage roads on either <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> crossing of Sligo Creek, then becomes divided ahead of its intersection with MD 212 (Riggs Road). MD 410 briefly has six lanes as it heads southeast to Ager Road, which leads toward the West Hyattsville Station on the Washington Metro's Green Line. MD 410 has a partial intersection with Ager Road; the missing movements between MD 410 and Ager Road are made via 23rd Avenue to the east. MD 410 crosses Northwest Branch Anacostia River and enters the city of Hyattsville. The highway expands to six lanes as it passes between The Mall at Prince George's and Prince George's Plaza Station on the Green Line. East of University Town Center and the headquarters of the National Center for Health Statistics, MD 410 has a four-way intersection with the northern end of MD 500 (Queens Chapel Road) and the southern end of Adelphi Road.|$|E
5|$|Males {{are easy}} to {{identify}} due to their perceptibly broad and smaller mandibles. Their antennae consist of 13 segments, and are almost the same length as the ants' bodies. Ergatandromorph (an ant that exhibits both male and worker characteristics) males are known; in 1985, a male M. gulosa was collected before it hatched from its cocoon, {{and it had a}} long but excessively curved left mandible while the other mandible was small. On the right <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> body, it was structurally male, but the left side appeared female. The head was also longer on the female side, its colour was darker, and the legs and prothorax were smaller on the male side. Male genitalia are retracted into a genital cavity that is located in the posterior end of the gaster. The sperm is structurally the same to other animal sperm, forming an oval head with a long tail.|$|E

5|$|Racer's {{hurricane}} was {{a destructive}} tropical cyclone that had severe effects on northeastern Mexico and the Gulf Coast of the United States in early October1837. It takes {{its name from}} the Royal Navy ship Racer, which sustained some damage when it encountered the hurricane in the northwestern Caribbean Sea. The storm first affected Jamaica with flooding rainfall and strong winds on September26 and27, before entering the Gulf of Mexico by October1. As the hurricane approached northern Tamaulipas and southern Texas, it slowed to a crawl and turned sharply eastward. The storm battered the GulfCoast from Texas to the Florida Panhandle between October3 and7, and after crossing the Southeastern United States, it emerged into the Atlantic shipping lanes off the Carolinas. For most of the storm's duration, the strongest winds and heaviest rains were confined to the northern <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> track.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after {{entering}} Carroll County, MD 30 curves northwest and meets {{the southern end}} of MD 30 Business (Hanover Pike) and Phillips Drive at a roundabout. While the business route heads north through the center of Hampstead, MD 30 passes {{to the west of the}} town on the Hampstead Bypass, which has two lanes but expands to a three- or four-lane divided highway for short stretches on either <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> roundabouts. The state highway passes under Houcksville Road and over Shiloh Road before meeting MD 482 (Hampstead–Mexico Road) at a roundabout. MD 30 reunites with the northern end of MD 30 Business at a roundabout in the community of Greenmount. The state highway, once again named Hanover Pike, has a short four-lane divided section through a commercial area before reducing to two lanes.|$|E
5|$|The Bengal slow loris {{has a small}} {{swelling}} on the ventral <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> elbow {{called the}} brachial gland, which secretes a pungent, clear oily toxin that the animal uses defensively by wiping it on its toothcomb. The oil has been analyzed using gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry, {{and it has been}} shown that almost half of the several dozen volatile or semi-volatile chemicals present do not occur in the closely related pygmy slow loris. The most predominant component was the phenolic compound m-cresol. The authors of the study suggest that the chemically complex oils may help the lorises communicate with each other, allowing them to transmit by scent information about sex, age, health and nutritional status, and dominance.|$|E

5|$|The {{breeding}} male {{is bright}} russet or cinnamon red on its upperparts from its crown to its rump, {{with a black}} streaking on its mantle. It has a small black bib and black around its eye, separated from the russet of its crown by a very thin white supercilium, a stripe running from the bill {{to the rear of}} the head. The <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> neck and cheek are off-white, and its underparts are pale grey or washed with yellow, varying geographically. Shoulders and greater coverts are chestnut, and its median coverts are black at the base with white at the tips. The rest of the wing is light brown with black tinges. Its tail is blackish brown, edged with ashy brown. The non-breeding male differs little from the breeding male, being paler with more orange upperparts. The only species with which the male is easily confused is the Eurasian tree sparrow, which differs in its black cheek spot and brown back.|$|E
5|$|The type {{specimen}} preserves the right canine. Like other therocephalians, the canine of Euchambersia was very large, {{resulting in a}} specialized predatory lifestyle that incorporates a sabertooth bite into prey killing. It is round in cross-section, and bears a prominent ridge on the <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> front surface. Immediately beside this ridge is a shallow depression that becomes wider {{near the top of}} the tooth, which is probably the same structure as the groove interpreted by some authors. Theriodonts usually replace their teeth in an alternating (or distichial) pattern, such that the canine tooth is always functional; both skulls of Euchambersia show no sign of any replacement teeth developing, suggesting that Euchambersia was reliant on having both canines present and functional simultaneously.|$|E
5|$|Located {{in an area}} of {{warm water}} {{temperatures}} and light wind shear, Hurricane Paul continued to intensify and organize; its well-defined eye was surrounded by a ring of deep convection while outflow remained strong to the north and south. On October23, while located 465miles (750km) south-southwest of Cabo San Lucas, Paul reached its peak intensity of 105mph (165km/h), a Category2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Scale. A large trough located off the west coast of California turned the hurricane to the north-northwest, and later to the north. The combination of increasing shear and dry air quickly weakened Paul to a tropical storm on October24 as its low-level circulation became detached from the diminishing convection. The storm then turned to the northeast after passing near Socorro Island. Despite increasing wind shear of over 50mph (80km/h), Paul remained a tropical storm while its circulation remained on the southwest <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> developing deep convection. Early on October25, the storm passed about 100miles (160km) south of the southern tip of Baja California. The circulation briefly became involved with the deep convection as it accelerated northeastward, though as it approached the coast of Sinaloa, the center again decoupled from the upper level circulation. Later that day, Paul weakened to a tropical depression a short distance off the coast of Mexico, and turned to the north. Early the next day, the depression, devoid of any deep convection, made landfall near Isla Altamura in northwestern Sinaloa. Hours later, the National Hurricane Center issued the last advisory on the dissipating tropical depression.|$|E
50|$|However Haworthia fasciata {{is rare in}} cultivation, and {{can easily}} be {{distinguished}} by the smooth upper (ie. inner) surfaces <b>of</b> <b>its</b> leaves. Its white tubercles occur only on the lower (outer) <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> leaves; whereas H.attenuata has roughness or tubercles on both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> leaves. The leaves of H.fasciata are also often stouter and more deltoid. They tend to curve inwards more. Unlike H.attenuata, older H.fasciata specimens also sometimes develop long columnal stems. The most fundamental distinction, though not externally obvious, is that Haworthia fasciata has fibrous leaves - unlike H.attenuata, but similar to H.glauca, H.coarctata, H.reinwardtii and H.longiana.|$|R
