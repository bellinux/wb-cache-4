500|$|Sorkin {{fought with}} the ABC network during the first season {{over the use of}} a laugh track and a live studio audience. The laugh track was widely decried by critics as jarring, with Joyce Millman of Salon.com {{describing}} it as [...] "the most unconvincing laugh track you've ever heard". Sorkin commented that: [...] "Once you do shoot in front of a live audience, you {{have no choice but to}} use the laugh track. Oftentimes [...] is the right thing to do. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> need a cymbal crash. Other times, it alienates me." [...] The laugh track was gradually dialed down and was gone by the end of the first season. Sorkin was triumphant in the second season when ABC agreed to his demands, unburdening the crew of the difficulties of staging a scene for a live audience and leaving the cast with more time to rehearse.|$|E
500|$|Before meeting Beyoncé, Rich Harrison had {{conceptualized}} {{the beat}} of the song. He had sampled the hook's instrumentation from the 1970 song [...] "Are You My Woman? (Tell Me So)," [...] which had originally been written and composed by Eugene Record, frontman of the Chicago-based vocal group The Chi-Lites. When Harrison first played the beat to his friends, they could not [...] "dig it," [...] and this made him realize that he had conceived something special, which people would appreciate better after hearing the whole record. Thus Harrison decided not to market the selection, and instead, he waited for the right artist to record it: [...] "I had it in the chamber, I had not really shopped it much, because <b>sometimes</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not want {{to come out of the}} bag before it's right. People do not really get it and you will leave them with a foul taste in their mouth." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} written by Lifehouse lead singer Jason Wade and American record {{producer}} Jude Cole and was produced by Lifehouse and Jude Cole at Ironworks Studio in Los Angeles. In an interview with The San Bernardino Sun, Wade talked about making songs on the album and said, [...] "This time around it was not about having any preconceived notions. It was about letting the tape machine roll and getting the music down spontaneously." [...] When asked about {{the message of the}} song, Wade said, [...] "I think the main message of this song, at least for me personally when I was writing the lyrics, is just how difficult it can be to be in a relationship. <b>Sometimes,</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> things to disappoint the other person. Letting someone down and trying to repair a relationship that you feel is kind of slipping through your hands a bit." [...] "Whatever It Takes" [...] was originally released with the band's fourth studio album, Who We Are, on June 18, 2007 and was officially solicited as a single to mainstream radio on November 13, 2007.|$|E

5000|$|Adrian Younge, whose song [...] "Sirens" [...] was sampled {{to create}} the instrumental, commented that he was [...] "very happy how it came out." [...] Despite usually being {{critical}} of how people sample his music, Young thought that [...] "especially for 'Picasso Baby', they literally just looped the top, and it worked. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>you</b> just <b>do</b> a loop and it just works." ...|$|R

The board say, 'D--- the hoss!' 'Get rid of the hoss.' 'Chuck out the hoss.' Then they talk together, and one say to the Professor Dobbs: 'Eef you cannot thees hoss remove from the mine, you can take him out of the report.' He look to me, thees professor. I see nothing; I remain tranquil. Then the board say: 'Thees report with the hoss in him is worth two thousand dollar, but WITHOUT the hoss he is worth five thousand dollar. For the stockholder is frighted of the rearing hoss. It is of a necessity that the stockholder should remain tranquil. Without the hoss the report is good; the stock shall errise; the director shall sell out, and leave the stockholder the hoss to play with.' The professor he say, 'Al-right;' he scratch out the hoss, sign his name, and get a check for three thousand dollar." ...|$|E

5000|$|Written by Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, [...] "Rough Justice" [...] was {{a heavily}} {{collaborative}} effort {{like many of}} the lead singer and guitarist's latter-day compositions.

Yeah, I almost sort of woke up and said, 'Where's my guitar?' <b>Sometimes</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> dream a riff, you know? I had to get up, and it's really hard to get me up.

5000|$|On June 14, 2003 in Pikeville, Kentucky, the McCoy cousins {{partnered with}} Reo Hatfield of Waynesboro, Virginia, to declare an {{official}} truce between the families. Reo Hatfield {{said that he}} wanted to show that if the two families could reach an accord, others could also. He had said {{that he wanted to}} send a broader message to the world that when national security is at risk, Americans put their differences aside and stand united: [...] "We're not saying you don't have to fight because <b>sometimes</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> have to fight," [...] he said. [...] "But you don't have to fight forever." [...] Signed by more than sixty descendants during the fourth Hatfield-McCoy Festival, the truce was touted as a proclamation of peace, saying [...] "We ask by God's grace and love that we be forever remembered as those that bound together the hearts of two families to form a family of freedom in America." [...] Governor Paul E. Patton of Kentucky and Governor Bob Wise of West Virginia signed proclamations declaring June 14 Hatfield and McCoy Reconciliation Day. Ron McCoy, one of the festival's founders, said it is unknown where the three signed proclamations will be exhibited. [...] "The Hatfields and McCoys symbolize violence and feuding and fighting, but by signing this, hopefully people will realize that's not the final chapter," [...] he said.|$|E
5000|$|During a {{performance}} at the Avalon Theater in Salt Lake City, Utah, on September 6, 2006, frontman Dave Elkins made the following statement before the band performed [...] "Mistakes We Knew We Were Making" [...] (transcribed from video previously posted on YouTube):I hope {{you know how much}} fun we’re having up here because of you guys. Well, this next song is a hypothetical story of a couple who falls in love; they’ve decided what they’re looking for and they find it in each other…and it’s very good, it’s very rewarding; but…well, not “but” but alongside of this, or as a result of this, an unborn baby comes into the picture before too long. And {{a lot of people have}} wondered and talked to us at shows, and I’ve seen it discussed on message boards and whatnot, and a lot of people thought this song is a story about an abortion or this song is a story stating us as pro-choice or pro-life, and that’s not necessarily the case here. What we’re looking at is the fact that as a result of this baby entering into the world, they find a love, these individuals, that’s more fulfilling and more rewarding, and more satisfying, than anything they had known up until that point. Cheering I think that it’s important that we understand that love is not always black and white like we’d like for it to be, and sometimes it’s very grey. Sometimes you have to make the difficult decisions. And <b>sometimes</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> have to try and fail, and fail and fail a few times before you can actually succeed and get the big picture. And I think that’s exactly what this song is really all about. And this song is called “Mistakes We Knew We Were Making.” ...|$|E
