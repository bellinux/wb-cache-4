40|$|In {{order to}} {{increase}} the efficiency of desired work inside the long tunnel drilling, rating of electrical drives at tunnel face has significantly increased. Due to the high rating concentration of electrical drives at tunnel face significant voltage must be required which is need of an hour to finish the work in given time interval and to avoid the various dangers. Therefore, planning of electrical power distribution is required and voltage drop across each electrical drives must be taken into account. While power planning drill machine, Armored Face Conveyors (AFC), <b>Shearer,</b> breaker, Stage <b>loader,</b> <b>face</b> lightning, etc. must be given due importance as starting power required to them is very high. Breakaway torque of the AFC is not maintained because of low power, so it is required to start constantly requiring high power as well as it will heat the environment, which is often hazardous. In order to provide the required power drop and reduce the dangers, some alternative methods must be used. In the present investigation voltage drop compensation technique is developed by providing with optimization of position of transformer. Even though the voltage drop cannot be maintained in such cases boosting transformer with the power thyristor with tap changing is used to control the power instead of tap changer mechanism. In order to operate the various drives in long drilling tunnel and finish the work in desired period one must know the various parameters involved in the system. On line parameter such as voltage, currents, temperature, etc. of electrical drives and environment are measured through PC using various sensors, the sensed data is compared with the standard data. The comparison will help to take necessary decision and helps to reduce the forth-coming dangers in the tunnel or electrical drives...|$|R
50|$|The Anderton <b>Shearer</b> <b>Loader</b> is a {{coal cutting}} machine {{which was used}} in the UK coal {{industry}} after 1953. The Anderton Power Loader with its cutting drum up to five feet in diameter was patented in 1953. It was successfully used throughout the British coalfields and by 1966 cut half the coal produced and by 1977 it produced 80% of the coal mined in Britain.|$|R

5000|$|Lancashire {{was at the}} {{forefront}} of innovation in coal mining from James Brindley's 1756 water wheel at Wet Earth Colliery to the Duke of Bridgewaters's underground canals. Edward Ormerod patented a [...] "Butterfly" [...] safety link to improve cage safety in 1867 that is used globally. Lancashire had the first pithead baths in the country at Gibfield Colliery in Atherton and the first mines rescue station at to cover an entire coalfield at Howe Bridge in 1908. The Anderton <b>Shearer</b> <b>Loader</b> invented by James Anderton produced more than half the total output of British coal in the 1960s.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Automation in {{underground}} mining enhances safety {{and leads to}} economic efficiencies. After more than 50 years of research, automation tasks have gradually been growing out of the classic engineering/mechanical environment and require a sophisticated data-mining treatment. The success of (mechanical) process automation has left only one remaining place in the coal-excavation process where human labor is still indispensable: {{the operation of the}} excavation machine, the <b>shearer</b> <b>loader.</b> The necessity to utilize human labor is due to the unknown exact position of the underground coal seam to be excavated. Therefore, at each point in time, a human has to detect the direction in which to excavate further. In the harsh underground conditions, this brings about serious safety and health hazards. The operator is surrounded by dust, which obstructs his vision, among others. In addition, human mistakes in coal-layer detection mean that more rock is excavated rather than coal, which lowers the economic efficiency of the whole coal-mining process. In this paper we fill in the gap in the coal-excavation automation by building a pattern recognition system inside the <b>shearer</b> <b>loader</b> that turns it into a “smart ” machine that is capable of detecting the correct position of the coal to be excavated and enable human-free coal mining. The success of such a system would mean that mines with very harsh human conditions could potentially become fully operational, since human presence would not any more be required for coal excavation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The mining {{production}} systems, {{both for}} underground and open pit extraction consist mainly {{in a string}} of equipment starting with the winning equipment (<b>shearer</b> <b>loader,</b> in case of underground longwall mining or bucket wheel excavator in case of open pit mining), hauling equipment (armored face conveyor in longwall mining or the on-board belt conveyor in case of excavators), main conveying equipment (belt conveyor in both cases), transfer devices, stock pile or bunker feeding equipment. This system of mainly serially connected elements is characterized by the throughput (overall amount of bulk coal respectively overburden rock produced), which is dependent on the functioning state of each involved equipment, and is strongly affected also by the process inherent variability due to the randomness of the involved processes (e. g. the cutting properties of the rock). In order to model and simulate such production systems, some probabilistic methods are applied arising from the artificial intelligence approach, involving unit operations and equipment, as the overall system as a whole, namely the Monte Carlo simulation, neural networks, fuzzy systems, and the Load Strength Interference methods. The results obtained are convergent and offer the opportunity for further developments of their application in the study of mining production systems...|$|R
50|$|Although {{forms of}} {{pre-packaged}} paper cartridges {{go back to}} the Middle Ages, their extra cost and small benefit to civilian users discouraged wide-spread adoption of them except for militia duty. For example, on April 19, 1775, in Lexington and Concord, paper cartridges were routinely used by many civilians on the opening day of the American Revolutionary War. Similarly, the British soldiers there carried cartridge boxes holding 36 paper cartridges. The advantage of paper cartridges was speed; 3 to 4 rounds a minute were possible using paper cartridges. Measuring each charge before firing reduced the rate of fire to about one round per minute. There were other methods, including small cloth bags containing the correct amount of powder for a single shot, that might be carried on a bandolier (again requiring a container for a supply for refilling). An important safety concern was that when reloading a muzzle-loading gun soon after a shot there might be small pieces of wadding burning in the muzzle, which would cause the new load of powder to ignite as a flash. So long as no part of the <b>loader</b> <b>faced</b> the end of the barrel this was not dangerous in itself, but if a spark reached the main supply in the powder flask a fatal explosion was likely. Various precautions were taken, both in the design and use of powder measures used with flasks, or in the flasks themselves, to prevent this from happening. The inside and outside of a powder horn were often polished to make the horn translucent so that the soldier would be able to see how much powder he had left.|$|R
50|$|The coal is {{cut from}} the coalface by a machine called the <b>shearer</b> (power <b>loader).</b> This machine can weigh 75-120 tonnes {{typically}} and comprises a main body, housing the electrical functions, the tractive motive units to move the shearer along the coalface and pumping units (to power both hydraulic and water functions). At {{either end of the}} main body are fitted the ranging arms which can be ranged vertically up down by means of hydraulic rams, and onto which are mounted the shearer cutting drums which are fitted with 40-60 cutting picks. Within the ranging arms are housed very powerful electric motors (typically up to 850 kW) which transfer their power through a series of lay gears within the body and through the arms to the drum mounting locations at the extreme ends of the ranging arms where the cutting drums are. The cutting drums are rotated at a speed of 20-50 revs/min to cut the mineral from coal seam.|$|R
5000|$|Although {{forms of}} {{pre-packed}} paper cartridges {{go back to}} the Middle Ages, these were for several centuries made up by the shooter or a servant, rather than being mass-produced, requiring a container for the gunpowder, which came loose. Unlike modern cartridges, these were not inserted into the gun themselves, but were rather a pre-measured amount of powder stored in a paper wrapper, sometimes with the ball included as well. Loading the gun involved tearing open the package, emptying the powder into the muzzle and pan, inserting the ball with the paper doubling as wadding, and then ramming home the charge. This was somewhat faster and more convenient than measuring out a powder charge each time, especially in a combat situation. However, there was no large-scale manufacturing of these cartridges until the 19th century, and even then the benefits mostly lay with military use; the added cost made them less popular with civilian shooters until the advent of the self-contained metallic cartridge and the breech-loader. While loading a muzzleloader, an important safety concern was that when reloading a muzzle-loading gun soon after a shot there might be small pieces of wadding burning in the muzzle, which would cause the new load of powder to ignite as a flash. So long as no part of the <b>loader</b> <b>faced</b> the end of the barrel this was not likely to lead to serious injury, but if a spark reached the main supply in the powder flask a dangerous, even fatal, explosion was likely. General Sir James Pulteney, 7th Baronet, was one such victim; he died in 1811 from complications after losing an eye when a powder flask accidentally exploded in his face in Norfolk. Charles Kickham, prominent in the Irish Republican Brotherhood, grew up largely deaf and almost blind as the result of an explosion when he was 13, in about 1840. [...] Various precautions were taken in the design and use of powder flasks to prevent this from happening, and expensive examples from as early as the 16th century usually have springs to automatically close the dispensing spout (this is much less common with the cheaper horn type).|$|R
5000|$|Boot <b>loaders</b> may <b>face</b> {{peculiar}} constraints, {{especially in}} size; for instance, on the IBM PC and compatibles, a boot sector should typically work in only 32 KB (later relaxed to 64 KB) of system memory and not use instructions {{not supported by}} the original 8088/8086 processors. The first stage of boot loaders (FSBL, first-stage boot loader) located on fixed disks and removable drives must fit into the first 446 bytes of the Master Boot Record in order to leave room for the default 64-byte partition table with four partition entries and the two-byte boot signature, which the BIOS requires for a proper boot loader [...] - [...] or even less, when additional features like more than four partition entries (up to 16 with 16 bytes each), a disk signature (6 bytes), a disk timestamp (6 bytes), an Advanced Active Partition (18 bytes) or special multi-boot loaders have to be supported as well in some environments. In floppy and superfloppy Volume Boot Records, up to 59 bytes are occupied for the Extended BIOS Parameter Block on FAT12 and FAT16 volumes since DOS 4.0, whereas the FAT32 EBPB introduced with DOS 7.1 requires even 71 bytes, leaving only 441 bytes for the boot loader when assuming a sector size of 512 bytes. Microsoft boot sectors therefore traditionally imposed certain restrictions on the boot process, for example, the boot file had to be located at a fixed position in the root directory of the file system and stored as consecutive sectors, conditions taken care of by the [...] command and slightly relaxed in later versions of DOS. The boot loader was then able to load the first three sectors of the file into memory, which happened to contain another embedded boot loader able to load the remainder of the file into memory. When they added LBA and FAT32 support, they even switched to a two-sector boot loader using 386 instructions. At the same time other vendors managed to squeeze much more functionality into a single boot sector without relaxing the original constraints on the only minimal available memory and processor support. For example, DR-DOS boot sectors are able to locate the boot file in the FAT12, FAT16 and FAT32 file system, and load it into memory as a whole via CHS or LBA, even if the file is not stored in a fixed location and in consecutive sectors.|$|R
