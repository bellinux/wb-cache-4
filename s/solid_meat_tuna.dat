Six experimental diets were formulated in the experiment. Three diets contained 50, 150 and 250 g/kg of TPM-H (<b>tuna</b> <b>meat</b> by-product hydrolysate), and two diets with the unprocessed TPM (<b>tuna</b> <b>meat</b> by-product) at an inclusion level of 50 and 250 g/kg.

Results of the feeding trial suggest that the inclusion of TPM-H at 250 g/kg in fish diets improved body weight gain rate (3271. 58 %), feed intake (24. 55 g/fish/ 56 days) and feed conversion efficiency (1. 12) of the fish.

40|$|Graduation date: 2014 Access {{restricted}} to the OSU Community, at author's request, from Dec. 27, 2013 - June 27, 2014 Staphylococcus aureus is a human pathogen capable of producing enterotoxins causing staphylococcal food poisoning, {{one of the most}} economically important foodborne diseases in the U. S. This pathogen may be introduced to pre-cooked <b>tuna</b> <b>meat</b> used for the production of canned tuna because significant manual handling occurs after cooking of the raw fish to separate the meat from the skin and bones. This study was conducted to investigate the growth and enterotoxin production of five enterotoxigenic S. aureus strains in pre-cooked albacore and skipjack <b>tuna</b> <b>meat</b> held at 37 and 27 °C, the survival of S. aureus in pre-cooked <b>tuna</b> <b>meat</b> stored at - 20 ± 2 °C for 4 weeks and its ability to grow and produce enterotoxins in the pre-cooked <b>tuna</b> <b>meat</b> at 37 °C after frozen storage, and thermal inactivation of enterotoxins in pre-cooked <b>tuna</b> <b>meat</b> at 111 and 121 °C. Frozen pre-cooked albacore tuna (loin, chunk and flake) and skipjack tuna (chunk and flake) obtained from a canned tuna producer were inoculated with five S. aureus strains or highly purified enterotoxins A (SEA), B (SEB), and D (SED) for this study. With an initial inoculation levels of 10 ²⁻⁴ CFU/g, populations of S. aureus in inoculated albacore and skipjack <b>tuna</b> <b>meat</b> increased by > 3 log CFU/g after 6 and 8 h of incubation at 37 °C, respectively. On the other hand, more than 8 and 10 h of incubation at 27 °C were needed to yield the same increase of S. aureus counts (> 3 log CFU/g) in albacore and skipjack samples, respectively. However no enterotoxin was produced in any inoculated albacore or skipjack tuna samples exposed to 37 °C for 12 h or 27 °C for 16 h. S. aureus survived in pre-cooked tuna during frozen storage. With an initial inoculation level of 10 ³⁻⁴ CFU/g, populations of S. aureus in all pre-cooked tuna samples decreased slightly (< 0. 7 log CFU/g) after 4 weeks of storage at - 20 ± 2 °C. However, the populations increased rapidly once the samples were thawed and held at 37 °C. Total S. aureus counts in albacore and skipjack samples increased by greater than 3 log CFU/g after 6 and 8 h of exposure to 37 °C, respectively. However, no enterotoxin was detected in any samples after 10 h exposure to 37 °C. All the samples showed signs of spoilage before enterotoxin was detected. Studies of heat resistances of SEA, SEB, and SED inoculated to pre-cooked albacore and skipjack <b>tuna</b> <b>meat</b> revealed that the heat resistance of SED was stronger than SEA and SEB, particularly in albacore loin, flake and skipjack flake samples. When samples were inoculated with SEA, SEB and SED at levels of 500 ng/g, a thermal treatment at 121 °C for 15 min inactivated SEA and SEB in all samples and SED in albacore chunk and skipjack chunk but not in albacore loin, flake and skipjack flake samples. However, a process at 111 °C, for 60 min inactivated all SEA, SEB and SED in all tuna samples at levels of 500 ng/g. When the pre-cooked <b>tuna</b> <b>meat</b> samples were inoculated with S. aureus at levels of 10 ³⁻⁴ CFU/g, SEA, SEB, and SED were detected in all samples after 36 h of incubation at 37 °C.

40|$|In 1988, the United States {{government}} {{published the}} first federal regulations for the testing of human samples {{for the presence of}} illegal drugs. These regulations produced successful techniques for detecting illegal substances in human samples, specifically urine. However, they also caused an increase in methods used to falsify the results of these tests. The most common of these methods is that of in vitro adulteration, or adding a substance to a urine sample in order to cause a false negative test result. As a result of these adulteration methods, new tests have been developed to assess the integrity of samples collected for drug of abuse testing. To examine the effectiveness of one specimen validity test, the Alere iScreen© Urine Adulteration Test Strip, different concentrations of six common adulterants were created and combined with drug-positive human urine controls to simulate adulterated samples. <b>Solid</b> <b>meat</b> tenderizer, liquid meat tenderizer, lemon juice, apple cider vinegar, eye drops, and bleach were added at varying dilutions to Alere’s positive iScreen© Urine Control. Each sample was tested for pH, specific gravity, nitrite, glutaraldehyde, creatinine, and pyridinium chlorochromate/oxidant presence by the test strip in duplicate to determine if the specimen validity test was effective at detecting the presence of the adulterants.
