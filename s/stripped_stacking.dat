40|$|This paper {{presents}} an investigation on the AC losses in several typical superconducting composite conductors using the H-formulation model. A single superconducting strip with ferromagnetic substrate or cores and {{a stack of}} coated conductors with ferromagnetic substrates are studied. We consider all the coated conductors carrying AC transport currents and simultaneously exposed to perpendicular AC magnetic fields. The influences of the amplitude, frequency, phase difference and ferromagnetic materials on the AC losses are investigated. The results show that the magnetization losses of single <b>strip</b> and <b>stacked</b> <b>strips</b> have similar characteristics. The ferromagnetic substrate can increase the magnetization loss at low magnetic field, and decrease the loss at high magnetic field. The ferromagnetic substrate can obviously increase the transport loss in <b>stacked</b> <b>strips.</b> The trends of total AC losses of single <b>strip</b> and <b>stacked</b> <b>strips</b> are similar when they are carrying current or exposed to a perpendicular magnetic field. The effect of the frequency on the total AC losses of single strip is related to the amplitude of magnetic field. The AC losses decrease with increasing frequency in low magnetic field region while increase in high magnetic field region. As the phase difference changes, there is a periodic variation for the AC losses. Moreover, when the strip is under only the transport current and magnetic field, the ferromagnetic cores will increase the AC losses for large transport current or field...|$|R

Correlation graphics show the relation between <b>stacks</b> and <b>strips</b> of different levels, providing context and distance awareness among the focus points. The zoom hierarchies can also be used as graphical histories and for communicating insights to stakeholders.

40|$|Abstract This paper {{presents}} a non-linear integer programming {{model for a}} cross-dock problem that considers the total transportation cost of inbound and outbound trucks from an origin to a destination and {{the total cost of}} assigning <b>strip</b> and <b>stack</b> doors to trucks based on their number of trips and the distance between doors in cross-dock. In previous studies these two cost-based problems are modeled separately however it is more realistic and practical to use both of them as an integrated cross-docking model. Additionally this model is solved for a randomly generated numerical example with three suppliers and two customers by the use of a genetic algorithm. By comparing two different parameter levels i. e. low and high numbers of populations the optimum solution is obtained considering a high level population size. A number of <b>strip</b> and <b>stack</b> doors are equal to a number of inbound and outbound trucks in the same sequence as 4 and 6 respectively. Finally the conclusion is presented...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Many 2 D visual spaces have a {{virtually}} one-dimensional nature with very high aspect ratio between the dimensions: examples include time-series data, multimedia data such as sound or video, text documents, and bipartite graphs. Common among these {{is that the}} space can become very large, e. g., temperature measurements could span a long time period, surveillance video could cover entire days or weeks, and documents can have thousands of pages. Many analysis tasks for such spaces require several foci while retaining context and distance awareness.

40|$|The paper {{discusses}} a {{model to}} estimate the diffraction loss in stacked quantum well slabs for optically pumped lasers. Two quantum well slabs, cleaved from the same <b>strip,</b> are <b>stacked</b> together with the front sides facing each other to form the laser cavity. Misalignment and different slab sizes are possible, which may result in additional diffraction loss. The model {{is based on the}} diffraction integral theory to calculate the fundamental mode in a plane mirror resonator. Model results suggest that, for a small misalignment size of a few percent of the wavelength, the diffraction loss is relatively small compared with other sources of loss in the laser system. Hence, the stacked scheme is feasible for the long wavelength far-infrared region but not suitable for shorter wavelengths in the mid- or near-infrared regions. This model is in general applicable to other optically pumped quantum well laser...|$|R

40|$|The {{correlation}} of particular Fourier {{components of the}} light curves of RR Lyrae variables with metallicity, discovered by Simon and later by Kovacs and his coworkers, is shown {{to have the same}} explanation as the period ratios (period shifts in log P) between RRab Lyrae variables that have the same colors, amplitudes, and light-curve shapes but different metallicities. A {{purpose of this paper is}} to demonstrate that the model which predicts the period-metallicity relations is the mediating parameters of colors, amplitudes, and light-curve shapes also explains the Simon/Kovacs et al. correlation between period, Phi_ 31, and metallicity. The proof is made by demonstrating that the combination of the first and third phase terms in a Fourier decomposition of RRab light curves, called Phi_ 31 by Simon and Lee, varies monotonically across the RR Lyrae instability strip in the same way that amplitude, color, and rise time vary with period within the strip. The premise of the model is that if horizontal branches at the RR Lyrae <b>strip</b> are <b>stacked</b> in luminosity according to the metallicity, then there necessarily must be a log period shift between RR Lyraes with different metallicities at the same Phi_ 31 values. However, there are exceptions to the model. ( [...] . ...|$|R

50|$|The {{title of}} a strip was {{sometimes}} typeset and pasted into the first panel, enabling the strips to be closely stacked. This {{had the advantage of}} making space for additional strips but often resulted in a crowded, unattractive page design. More often during the 1930s and 1940s, the title was typeset (in all upper case letters) and positioned to the right in the white space area above that strip, with the byline on the right. An episode subtitle (in upper and lower case) was centered between the title and the byline. In later years, as continuity strips gave way to humor strips, the subtitles vanished. In a nod toward the classic daily strips of yesteryear, the cartoonist Bill Griffith continues the tradition by always centering a hand-lettered episode subtitle above each of his Zippy strips.

40|$|We {{study the}} STORAGE ALLOCATION PROBLEM (SAP) {{which is a}} variant of the UNSPLITTABLE FLOW PROBLEM ON PATHS (UFPP). A SAP {{instance}} consists of a path P = (V,E) and a set J of tasks. Each edge e ∈ E has a capacity ce and each task j ∈ J is associated with a path Ij in P, a demand dj and a weight wj. The goal is to find a maximum weight subset S ⊆ J of tasks and a height function h: S → R+ such that (i) h(j) + dj ≤ ce, for every e ∈ Ij; and (ii) if j, i ∈ S such that Ij ∩ Ii 6 = ∅ and h(j) ≥ h(i), then h(j) ≥ h(i) + di. SAP {{can be seen as a}} rectangle packing problem in which rectangles can be moved vertically, but not horizontally. We present a polynomial time (9 + ε) -approximation algorithm for SAP. Our algorithm is based on a variation of the framework for approximating UFPP by Bonsma et al. [FOCS 2011] and on a (4 + ε) -approximation algorithm for δ-small SAP instances, namely for instances in which dj ≤ δ · ce, for every e ∈ Ij, for a sufficiently small constant δ> 0. In our algorithm for δ-small instances, tasks are packed carefully in strips in a UFPP manner, and then a (1 + ε) factor is incurred by a reduction from SAP to UFPP in strips. The <b>strips</b> are <b>stacked</b> to form a SAP solution. Finally, we show that SAP is strongly NP-hard, even with uniform weights and even if assuming the no bottleneck assumption...|$|R
30|$|There {{are three}} {{different}} scenarios {{in which the}} main cutting function can be called. In every run, one of these cases occurs. The first case is when the free space {{is equal to the}} raw stock (W,L) size. From the second iteration and after the cutting procedure, there will be two remainder strips from the stock. The width and length of the upper strip are represented by WRS and LRS, respectively. In every cycle, newly generated strips are placed {{on the top of the}} stack, which forms the second scenario. Conversely, the lower strips are used to produce new items in the third scenario. They will be used until there are no more feasible cuts, which lead to waste items. Then, the control flow will change to the stack items and the pop function will be called. The cutting algorithm continues to run until the control flow reaches the waste items. In a situation where there are no <b>strips</b> and the <b>stack</b> is empty, a new raw stock will be used. The above algorithm has been implemented using the C++ language.|$|R

40|$|A {{study has}} been made of the decay of the trapped {{magnetisation}} in superconductors when exposed to a crossed field. Numerical results have been compared with the theory of Brandt and Mikitik (2002 Phys. Rev. Lett. 89 027002) which solves the problem for a thin strip superconductor. FlexPDE with the A formulation and COMSOL with the H formulation were both used. Simulations of a strip with a cross section aspect ratio of 20 showed good agreement with theory both for the case of a transverse field larger than the transverse penetration field and for one smaller. In the latter case the magnetisation saturates as predicted, however the simulations show a slow decay after many cycles. In the case of stacked YBCO tapes the movement of flux lines is very small and the effects of the reversible motion were investigated. This can decrease the decay initially for very thin decoupled tapes, but cause a steady decay after very large numbers of cycles. Simulations on <b>stacked</b> <b>strips</b> showed that the decay constant increased approximately linearly with the number of strips. When combined with the theory for one tape this can explain the very slow decay observed in previous experiments. Experimental results were qualitatively in agreement with theory and simulations but showed some discrepancies.

The praise poetry of Iolo Goch describing [...] Owain Glyndŵr’s houses at Sycharth indicate that cruck construction was well established in 14th-century Wales. The earliest cruck framed house to be dated so far is Hafodygarreg at Erwood in Breconshire, which has a date of 1402. These cruck buildings {{are part of the}} Hall-house tradition with central fireplaces and the smoke escaping through vents in the roof. Some of the cruck framed houses were extended by adding wings, providing an H shaped layout. With the introduction of box framed and jettied houses in the mid-15th century, the use of crucks gradually went out of fashion. At this time many cruck houses were converted into barns and evidence for fireplaces and chimney <b>stacks</b> <b>stripped.</b> A good example of a house that has been converted into a barn, possibly as late as the 18th century is at Ty-coch Llangynhafal, Denbighshire.

There are many instances in Montgomeryshire where more elaborate timber framed farmhouses are associated on the same site with earlier houses which were converted into barns.

40|$|Flatness {{defects in}} thin strip cold rolling are a {{consequence}} of buckling due to roll thermo-elastic deformation and the resulting heterogeneous strip plastic deformation. A coupled rolling – buckling model has been developed [Abdelkhalek et al. 2011]. It has shown that (i) taking buckling into account results in completely different stress fields and fits correctly the measured on-line residual stresses under tension (“stress-meter rolls”); (ii) coupling buckling in the post-bite area and the rolling model, whatever the technique, changes little the in-bite fields. The model is applied here {{to the effect of}} friction on optimal setting of a flatness actuator, Work Roll Bending. Coupled rolling- buckling models Sheet Rolling model Lam 3 /Tec 3 The rolling model is Lam 3 /Tec 3, a 3 D <b>strip</b> / roll <b>stack</b> deformation software described in [Hacquin et al. 1998]. It uses an implicit velocity formulation with P 1 -discretisation on hexahedra. A steady state formulation based on streamlines is used, which requires EVP constitutive equations integration along streamlines, with an heterogeneous time step strategy called ELDTH. The roll stack deformation model is based on advanced beam theory, Boussinesq solution of a half-space under general loading, and Hertz contact mechanics. This model is discretized by an influence function method, resulting in a system of equations in the roll rigid body displacement, contact line displacement field roll / roll and contact pressures. This system is non-linear due to unknown contact lines. It is solved by Newton-Raphson method. Counhaye-Abdelkhalek model [Counhaye, 2000] has proposed a method to deal with sheet buckling in a FDM rolling model. The same has been implemented in Lam 3 /Tec 3 [Abdelkhalek 2011]. Initially proposed within the membrane theory framework, it forbids the appearance of a negative stress: every time this is about to occur, the structure buckles, bringing the stress back to almost zero by providing a stress-free alternative to elastic shortening of a material line. The following critical conditions are introduced...|$|R
