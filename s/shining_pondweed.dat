5000|$|<b>Shining</b> <b>pondweed</b> is {{a common}} name for several plants and may refer to: ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Shining</b> <b>pondweed</b> is more {{prevalent}} in older, poorly connected floodplain lakes and is a poor colonizer, slow to regenerate following floods and intolerant of drawdown. In Britain <b>shining</b> <b>pondweed</b> is mainly restricted to southern England with scattered outposts in Scotland and Wales, but is more widespread in Ireland. It is tolerant of eutrophication to some extent and in marl lakes it may replace Chara spp. as nutrient levels increase, before itself being ousted by fine-leaved pondweeds and eventually phytoplankton at higher nutrient levels. In a study of nutrient-rich river backwaters in the R. Tizsa (Hungary), <b>shining</b> <b>pondweed</b> was tolerant of very high phosphate concentrations, so long as chemical oxygen demand and chlorophyll-a concentrations in the water were not too high. In the Netherlands, the invasive Elodea nuttallii may compete with it for habitat.|$|E
5000|$|Potamogeton illinoensis, {{commonly}} known as Illinois pondweed [...] or <b>shining</b> <b>pondweed,</b> is an aquatic plant. It provides food and cover for aquatic animals.|$|E
50|$|Globally {{and on the}} {{majority}} of national Red Lists, <b>shining</b> <b>pondweed</b> is not considered threatened. P. lucens has declined somewhat in Britain, but still remains reasonably widespread.|$|E
50|$|Potamogeton lucens, or <b>shining</b> <b>pondweed,</b> is an aquatic {{perennial}} plant {{native to}} Eurasia and North Africa. It grows in relatively deep, still or slow-flowing, calcareous freshwater habitats.|$|E
50|$|<b>Shining</b> <b>pondweed</b> {{is one of}} the {{so-called}} Magnopotamion group of pondweeds. These are a characteristic floristic component of the protected Habitats Directive habitat Type Natural eutrophic lakes with Magnopotamion.|$|E
50|$|Dried {{and ground}} <b>shining</b> <b>pondweed</b> {{has been shown}} to be {{effective}} at binding heavy metals, raising the possibility of using biomass from this plant as a means of treating contaminated sediments.|$|E
5000|$|Potamogeton lucens (lucens meaning 'shining') {{was one of}} the {{original}} species named by Linnaeus in Species Plantarum (1753). <b>Shining</b> <b>pondweed</b> is morphologically quite variable, and as a result has received a bewildering number of synonyms.|$|E
50|$|Over {{much of its}} range, <b>shining</b> <b>pondweed</b> is {{not likely}} to be {{confused}} with any other species. However, in southern Europe the related and quite similar P. schweinfurthii has recently been discovered. P. lucens can usually be distinguished by its relatively broader leaves, 2-6 times as long as they are broad, and most or all of which are petiolate, but some forms are very difficult to distinguish without a detailed comparison of multiple characters.|$|E
50|$|<b>Shining</b> <b>pondweed</b> {{is a large}} {{plant with}} robust {{creeping}} rhizomes and long, terete, branching stems, typically up to 2.5 m but exceptionally to 6 m. The leaves are large, 75-200 mm (exceptionally more) long and 25-65 mm wide, 2-6 times as long as broad; as with the smaller P. gramineus, the leaves on the branches are smaller than those on the main stem. The leaves are pale green or yellowish, translucent, shiny with distinctive netted veining, minutely denticulate margins, and a short petiole of 1-12 mm. Floating leaves are absent.|$|E
5000|$|Anchor Church is {{included}} {{on the list of}} Derbyshire Regionally Important Geological Sites (RIGS), and is also listed as a Local Wildlife Site.Species of note found here include wall pennywort (Umbilicus rupestris) which grows on the rocks themselves, plus <b>shining</b> <b>pondweed</b> (Potamogeton lucens), a very rare [...] "Red Data List" [...] plant in Derbyshire, found in the backwater channel below the rocks and two other sites elsewhere in the county. Other species of note recorded near Anchor Church include Eurasian otter, and 1970s records of small water-pepper (Persicaria minor).|$|E
50|$|<b>Shining</b> <b>pondweed</b> {{is rarely}} cultivated, {{even though it}} is both easy to grow and an {{attractive}} plant. Its distinctive, large, transparent netted leaves are unlike any other commonly cultivated pond plant. In common with other pondweeds of this group it roots poorly from stem cuttings and is best propagated by division of the rhizomes. It is easy to grow in a garden pond or even in a barrel, but unlike some other submerged plants {{needs to be able to}} root in a suitable substrate such as sand or aquatic compost. Plants being established should be weighted down initially to allow them to root. Where waterfowl grazing is likely, protection will be necessary, especially in the early summer growth period.|$|E
50|$|Potamogeton × angustifolius is {{a hybrid}} between <b>shining</b> <b>{{pondweed}}</b> Potamogeton lucens and various-leaved pondweed Potamogeton gramineus. It is a perennial, growing from robust rhizomes. The stems are variable: slender to robust, terete, and branching, usually reaching 1.2 m but rarely up to 2m. The submerged leaves {{are reduced to}} phyllodes {{at the base of}} the stem, but elsewhere are broad and translucent, yellowish to dark green, sometimes with a pinkish tinge. The leaves measure 50-130 × 10-25 mm on the stems and main branches, but may be much smaller on the side branches; they have 4-5 (rarely 6) veins either side of the midrib and are usually sessile but some clones may have a few petiolate leaves. Turions are absent.|$|E
