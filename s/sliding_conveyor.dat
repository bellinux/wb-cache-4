40|$|Abstract. A star {{sprocket}} is {{an important}} component of U-shaped <b>slide</b> chain <b>conveyor,</b> so it is particularly important to be analyzed. It conducts modal analysis of star sprocket by using large finite element analysis software, ANSYS, calculates natural frequencies of the first five and the corresponding modes and analyzes natural frequency affected by sprocket tooth thickness. The result provides basic theory for dynamic optimization analysis of U-shaped <b>slide</b> chain <b>conveyor...</b>|$|R
40|$|Proper {{maintenance}} of plant equipment can {{significantly reduce the}} overall operating cost, while boosting the productivity of the plant. Therefore Maintenance planning is carried out in a area where the frequent failure occurs. The raw mill section is chosen due to its critical failure nature. The various subsystems of the raw mill system are: air <b>slide,</b> <b>conveyor</b> assembly, impact crusher, separator, elevator and gear assembly. The objective {{is to determine the}} optimal maintenance policy by means of Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and it is combined with Goal Programming (GP) to minimize the total maintenance cost...|$|R

40|$|A {{theoretical}} and experimental study {{was made of}} the conveying speed with which granular materials are transported by vibratory conveyors. The basic assumption made is that the layer of granular material can be considered as a point mass. The theory incorporates rest, slide, and flight phases of the material. Although the emphasis of this study is on the effect of the inclination (and declination) of the conveyor on the conveying speed, the effects of throw number, friction coefficient and vibration angle on the conveying speed are also shown. A useful method is presented for measuring the coefficient of friction between granular material and vibratory conveyor. Experiments were performed in order to verify the point mass theory. The agreement between theory and experiment is fairly good for <b>slide</b> <b>conveyors</b> but for throw conveyors larger deviations are observed. Some possibilities for improvement to the theory are briefly investigated...|$|R
40|$|The {{vibratory}} conveyor, routinely {{employed for}} normal-gravity transport of granular materials, usually {{consists of a}} continuous open trough vibrated sinusoidally to induce axial movement of a granular material. Motivated {{in part by a}} hypothetical application in zero gravity, we propose a novel modification of the vibratory conveyor based on a closed 2 d trough operating in a "slide-conveying" mode, with the granular mass remaining permanently in contact with the trough walls. We present a detailed analysis of the mechanics of transport, based on a rigid-slab model for the granular mass with frictional (Coulomb) slip at the upper and lower walls. The form of the vibration cycle plays a crucial role, and the optimal conveying cycle is not the commonly assumed rectilinear sinusoidal motion. The conveying efficiency for the novel <b>slide</b> <b>conveyor</b> will be presented for several simple vibration cycles, including one believed to represent the theoretical optimum...|$|R
50|$|Electric {{circuits}} caused perforations {{to be cut}} in a {{ticker tape}} attached to {{the face of the}} customer's key. The customer then took the punched out tape to the cashier for processing. The cashier would insert the tape into a reading mechanism that would electronically read it. That set off electrical and electronic circuits which started the goods <b>sliding</b> down <b>conveyor</b> belts and did the cost tallying in the process.|$|R
5000|$|The Turk: One of {{the strangest}} settings. Roast turkeys <b>slide</b> on a <b>conveyor</b> belt {{and you have to}} fire a fork at them to score points. A {{telephone}} flies diagonally around the screen, {{getting in the way of}} your fork.|$|R
50|$|A Fork lift can be {{arranged}} {{in more ways than}} an L-shaped conveyor or a platform lift and a spiral conveyor. A fork-lift is a product lift which lifts products from a conveyor using a fork and then places them at a different level on another conveyor. Such a fork-lift makes it possible to introduce or remove products at an angle of 90 degrees. As a result, the number of possible input and output combinations is somewhat larger. Because of the possibility of <b>sliding</b> <b>conveyors</b> in or out of the lift, a fork-lift can also be used as a vertical sorting system. With such a sorting installation, a product can be entered and removed at any level and a product can be lifted and lowered using one lift. The power and thus the energy consumption of the drive is considerably lower with a fork-lift than with other systems, since only the product weight needs to be transported and the forks maintain a balance between each other in the rising and lowering section. Another difference between a fork-lift and an L-shaped conveyor or platform lift is the complexity of the control. With an L-shaped conveyor or platform lift, input and output must be completely synchronous, whereas this is not necessary with a fork-lift. This ensures considerably simpler controls.|$|R
50|$|Various test {{machines}} {{have been}} developed to measure slip angle in a controlled environment. A motorcycle tire test machine is located at the University of Padua. That uses a 3 meter diameter disk that rotates under a tire held at a fixed steer and camber angle, up to 54 degrees. Sensors measure the force and moment generated, and a correction is made to account for the curvature of the track. Other devices use the inner or outer surface of rotating drums, <b>sliding</b> planks, <b>conveyor</b> belts, or a trailer that presses the test tire to an actual road surface.|$|R
40|$|Paradoxical {{effect of}} small {{dissipative}} and gyroscopic {{forces on the}} stability of a linear non-conservative system, which manifests itself through the unpredictable at first sight behavior of the critical non-conservative load, is studied. By means of the analysis of bifurcation of multiple roots of the characteristic polynomial of the non-conservative system, the analytical description of this phenomenon is obtained. As mechanical examples two systems possessing friction induced oscillations are considered: a mass <b>sliding</b> over a <b>conveyor</b> belt and {{a model of a}} disc brake describing the onset of squeal during the braking of a vehicle...|$|R
50|$|The Tornado is a {{water slide}} {{manufactured}} by ProSlide Technology. It requires riders {{to sit in}} a 2-6 seater round tube. Riders drop from inside a tunnel out into the ride's main element shaped like a funnel on its side. Riders oscillate {{from one side to the}} other until they exit through the back of the funnel and into a splash pool. Many of the <b>slides</b> feature a <b>conveyor</b> belt to bring the rafts to the top. On April 13, 2012 it was announced the first 6-man Tornado would be built using Hydromagnetic technology.|$|R
