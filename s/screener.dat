5|$|Despite {{the ban on}} {{broadcasting}} {{the series}} in Victoria, Victorians were still able to access episodes via illegal online distribution. The first episode was made available on torrent sites within 20minutes of it concluding in New South Wales. The Nine Network reportedly obtained the IP address of {{the first person to}} upload the show, and network lawyers were considering legal action. The Australian Federation Against Copyright Theft (AFACT) was investigating the matter, and was expected to make a list of recommendations to Victoria Police. Fears of inside leaks were aroused when advance <b>screener</b> versions of the first eight episodes were posted online.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of September 11, 2001, the five hijackers arrived at Washington Dulles International Airport. At 07:15, Khalid al-Mihdhar and Majed Moqed checked in at the American Airlines ticket counter for Flight 77, {{arriving}} at the passenger security checkpoint {{a few minutes later}} at 07:18. Both men set off the metal detector and were put through secondary screening. Moqed continued to set off the alarm, so he was searched with a hand wand. The Hazmi brothers checked in together at the ticket counter at 07:29. Hani Hanjour checked in separately and arrived at the passenger security checkpoint at 07:35. Hanjour was followed minutes later at the checkpoint by Salem and Nawaf al-Hazmi, who also set off the metal detector's alarm. The <b>screener</b> at the checkpoint never resolved what set off the alarm. As seen in security footage later released, Nawaf Hazmi appeared to have an unidentified item in his back pocket. Utility knives up to four inches were permitted at the time by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) as carry-on items. The passenger security checkpoint at Dulles International Airport was operated by Argenbright Security, under contract with United Airlines.|$|E

25|$|In 2003, Valenti {{found himself}} {{at the center of}} the {{so-called}} <b>screener</b> debate, as the MPAA barred studios and many independent producers from sending <b>screener</b> copies of their films to critics and voters in various awards shows. Under mounting industry pressure and a court injunction Antidote Int'l Films Inc. et al. v MPAA (November 2003), Valenti backed down in 2004, narrowly avoiding a massive and embarrassing antitrust lawsuit against the MPAA.|$|E
25|$|The pilot {{episode was}} {{released}} in <b>screener</b> for test audiences {{and members of the}} entertainment industry to preview the show and drum up business. The <b>screener</b> was subsequently leaked on the Internet and thus has received a much wider critical review process than initially conceived. There were few differences between the unbroadcast pilot and the version that was broadcast. Ashley Scott played the role of Allison in the unbroadcast pilot, but was replaced by Andrea Anders and the character name changed to Alex.|$|E

25|$|Mukasey also {{presided over}} the trial of Jose Padilla, ruling that the U.S. citizen and alleged {{terrorist}} could be held as an enemy combatant but was entitled to see his lawyers. Mukasey also was {{the judge in the}} litigation between developer Larry Silverstein and several insurance companies arising from the destruction of the World Trade Center. In a 2003 suit, he issued a preliminary injunction preventing the Motion Picture Association of America from enforcing its ban against the distribution of <b>screener</b> copies of films during awards season, ruling that the ban was likely an unlawful restraint of trade unfair to independent filmmakers.|$|E
25|$|Jeopardy! is an American {{television}} {{quiz show}} created by Merv Griffin, in which contestants {{are presented with}} clues {{in the form of}} answers, and must phrase their responses {{in the form of a}} question. Throughout its run, the show has regularly offered auditions for potential contestants, taking place in the Los Angeles area and occasionally in other locations throughout the United States. Unlike those of many other game shows, Jeopardy!s audition process involves passing a difficult test of knowledge on a diversity of subjects, approximating the breadth of material encountered by contestants on the show. Since 2006, an online <b>screener</b> test is conducted annually.|$|E

40|$|Apparatuses for <b>screening</b> {{granular}} solid particulate material {{include a}} generally planar first <b>screen</b> {{and a second}} <b>screen.</b> A plurality of apertures extends through the first <b>screen.</b> At least {{a portion of the}} second <b>screen</b> is oriented at an angle to the first <b>screen,</b> and apertures extend through a perforated region of the second <b>screen.</b> The second <b>screen</b> includes at least one region configured to prevent at least some particles of solid material from passing through the second <b>screen...</b>|$|R
50|$|However more {{material}} can be <b>screened</b> at once for a vibrating <b>screen</b> {{compared to a}} trommel <b>screen.</b> This is because {{only one part of}} the <b>screen</b> area of the trommel <b>screen</b> is utilised during the <b>screening</b> process whilst the entire <b>screen</b> is used for a vibrating <b>screen.</b> Trommel <b>screens</b> are also more susceptible to plugging and blinding, especially when different sized <b>screen</b> apertures are in series. Plugging is when material larger than the aperture may become stuck or wedged into the apertures and then may be forced through which is undesirable. Blinding is when wet material clump up and stick {{to the surface of the}} <b>screen.</b> The vibrations in the vibrating <b>screens</b> reduce the chance of plugging and blinding.|$|R
500|$|After Robert Koehler of Variety previewed the <b>screener</b> edit of {{the series}} at the Outfest film festival, he wrote: [...] "What would have been {{spectacular}} stuff just 10 years ago is now something closer to a high-quality Oprah special, humanizing in rather simplistic terms complex lives…". Anthony Glassman of the Gay People's Chronicle was also cautious in his assessment: [...] "The word 'groundbreaking' should be used sparingly, and perhaps it does not apply here. TransGeneration does one thing, and it does it well. It shows the viewer the reality and normality {{of the lives of}} these students and those around them, their family and friends." ...|$|E

But I wouldn't bet on it. [...] " [...] Toomey also later added another review of the premiere, stating that [...] "I'm worried though. Dexter is good. In fact, it's really good. That's why I'm worried. Why? Because Showtime has a nasty little habit of canceling great shows. There was The Chris Isaak Show. Then Dead Like Me. The most recent casualty? Huff. All three of those shows were spectacular. And you know what? Dexter is better than all of them. So, yeah... I'm worried." ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Repeated {{participation}} {{is important in}} faecal immunochemical testing (FIT) <b>screening</b> for colorectal cancer (CRC). However, {{a large number of}} <b>screening</b> invitations over time may lead to <b>screening</b> fatigue and consequently, decreased participation rates. We evaluated the impact of <b>screening</b> fatigue on overall <b>screening</b> programme effectiveness. Methods Using the ASCCA model, we simulated the Dutch CRC <b>screening</b> programme consisting of biennial FIT <b>screening</b> in individuals aged 55 – 75. We studied the resilience of the programme against heterogeneity in <b>screening</b> attendance and decrease in participation rate due to <b>screening</b> fatigue. Outcomes were reductions in CRC incidence and mortality compared to no <b>screening.</b> Results Assuming a homogenous 63  % participation, i. e., each round each individual was equally likely to attend <b>screening,</b> 30  years of <b>screening</b> reduced CRC incidence and mortality by 39 and 53  %, respectively, compared to no <b>screening.</b> When assuming clustered participation, i. e., three subgroups of individuals with a high (95  %), moderate (65  %) and low (5  %) participation rate, <b>screening</b> was less effective; reductions were 33  % for CRC incidence and 43  % for CRC mortality. <b>Screening</b> fatigue considerably reduced <b>screening</b> effectiveness; if individuals refrained from <b>screening</b> after three negative <b>screens,</b> model-predicted incidence reductions decreased to 25 and 18  % under homogenous and clustered participation, respectively. Figures were 34 and 25  % for mortality reduction. Conclusions <b>Screening</b> will substantially decrease CRC incidence and mortality. However, <b>screening</b> effectiveness can be seriously compromised if <b>screening</b> fatigue occurs. This warrants careful monitoring of individual <b>screening</b> behaviour and consideration of targeted invitation systems in individuals who have (repeatedly) missed <b>screening</b> rounds...|$|R
