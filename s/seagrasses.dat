Royle were estimated at seven sites in the reef flats off Bolinao (NW Luzon, The Philippines) featuring different fragmentation of the <b>seagrass</b> meadows. Fragmentation of the <b>seagrass</b> meadow was quantified as cover of E. acoroides and all <b>seagrass</b> species present in 20 × 20 m plots. E. acoroides and overall <b>seagrass</b> cover were correlated positively. The proportion of female flowers of E. acoroides that developed a fruit increased sharply as overall <b>seagrass</b> cover was around 50 %. Apparent sex ratio bore no relationship with overall <b>seagrass</b> cover. This threshold-type of relationship suggests that fragmentation of <b>seagrass</b> meadows can have a major effect on the reproductive output of this species. A possible mechanism underlying these results would be a non-linear increase of the efficiency of trapping the surface-dispersed pollen with increasing <b>seagrass</b> canopy density.

The abundance of Penaeus plebejus and Metapenaeus bennettae was significantly and consistently greater in dense <b>seagrass</b> proximal to mangroves than in other types of habitat. Additionally, sparse <b>seagrass</b> close to mangroves supported more of these species than dense <b>seagrass</b> farther away, indicating that the role of spatial arrangement of habitats was more important than the effects of structural complexity alone.
