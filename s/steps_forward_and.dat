5|$|Following a {{discussion}} with Pete about women and commitment, Adam argues with Rachel and angrily leaves her flat. Seconds later Simon returns, telling Rachel he has turned down the Hong Kong job. After getting locked out the house, Karen interrupts a seminar David is holding, demanding they get a nanny. He relents, embarrassed after being shown {{up in front of}} his colleagues. Determined to get Rachel back, Adam goes to Simon's flat, where he serenades her wearing nothing but a rose between his buttocks. Jenny and Pete arrive to find Simon chasing a naked Adam down the street. The fight is interrupted by a passing policeman, who lists multiple felonies Adam has committed, until Rachel <b>steps</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> takes the blame for what has happened. She declares her love to Adam and the two leave. Pete and Jenny watch and she tells him her last pregnancy test was positive.|$|E
25|$|Sinulog Festival is {{the largest}} fiesta (festival) in the Philippines. Held every third Sunday of January, it commemorates the Child Jesus, the Lord and Protector of Cebu. The Sinulog is a dance ritual of pre-Hispanic {{indigenous}} origin. The dancer moves two <b>steps</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> one step backward to the rhythmic sound of drums. This movement resembles the current (sulog) of what was then known Cebu's Pahina River. Thus the name Sinulog.|$|E
25|$|The hora dance {{originates}} in the Balkans but {{also found in}} other countries (including Romania and Moldova). The dancers hold each other's hands and the circle spins, usually counterclockwise, as each participant follows a sequence of three <b>steps</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> one step back. The Hora is popular during wedding celebrations and festivals, and {{is an essential part}} of the social entertainment in rural areas. In Bulgaria, it is not necessary to be in a circle; a curving line of people is also acceptable.|$|E

25|$|Feminism {{seems to}} have become a {{priority}} of the state since 2000 with {{the foundation of the}} National Council for Women (NCW) who are very active in promoting women's rights in Egypt. In 2000 legislation was passed allowing women to divorce under the khul-law and to pass on their nationality to their biological children in 2004. These are great <b>steps</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> due also in part to a very friendly Egyptian government and lobby in government and outside the state structures through civil society organisations.|$|E
25|$|On the 'ava cup being {{presented}} to a chief {{he takes it}} {{in his right hand}} and after a moment's pause, he spills a few drops onto {{the floor of the house}} on his right side at the same time speaking a few words in a low tone. Today these words have some Christian significance but in olden times were no doubt a form of prayer to one of the numerous gods. He then raises the cup and says Ia manuia which means be happy or prosperous. He then drinks a varying quantity of the 'ava and throws any remainder over his shoulder. He then hands the cup back to the tautu'ava who <b>steps</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> returns to the refill the cup. Should the person served not desire to drink the 'ava he may take a mouthful and then spew it out, or he may merely touch the cup held in the hand of the bearer or he may take hold of the cup and holding it out in front of him address a few remarks to the assembly, finally exclaiming Ia manuia.|$|E

25|$|That night, Karl and Harry have a {{confrontation}} backstage, in which Karl accuses Harry of murdering Carol; Harry angrily rejects the accusation and challenges that Karl merely finds {{it easier to}} believe that rather than accept the guilt of betraying his best friend. On stage, Karl begins to pioneer his psychic act, but the stooge he has hired in the crowd which he had chosen with a fake random ball toss, accidentally trips and concusses himself on the stage. Upon hearing the sad story of another selected audience member, he decides that he cannot perpetuate the fraud, admitting to the audience {{that he is not}} able to contact the dead. As a result, Dani forgives him. Harry, as 'The Black Widower', starts his guillotine act, but at the moment of truth Linda's nerve fails her and she flees the stage. Although Harry’s act would appear to be ruined when he asks if anybody else wants to try, Karl <b>steps</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> announces that he will face the guillotine instead. Karl allows himself to be locked in the guillotine, explaining that Carol was frequently unfaithful and forced Karl to have sex with her. Harry appears to decapitate Karl – although it is merely an illusion, and Karl appears unharmed, the trick having worked perfectly. Harry wins the competition, and in his acceptance speech both forgives Karl and admits that he loves Linda, who joins him on stage and the two kiss. Their friendship mended, Karl and Harry embark on a reunion tour, incorporating Dani and Linda into the act as their assistants.|$|E

500|$|On the Viscount's ship, the Viscount {{tells the}} group {{the story of}} an {{explorer}} who found the Final Key, but was unable to find the Power Crystal. That explorer was the Viscount's grandfather. As the explorer sailed back to his homeland to recollect his thoughts, his ship crashed into an iceberg and sank, taking the Viscount's grandfather to a watery grave. [...] "Sounds like a movie", remarks one of the attendees. The Viscount tells them to dive to the sunken ship and retrieve the Final Key, much to their shock, considering the near-freezing temperatures. Despite this, the group is able to find the Final Key before freezing to death. With all the pieces of the puzzle at hand, the Viscount victoriously enters the Tower, where the Super Big Power Crystal awaits its owner. Just as the Viscount is about to make his wish, Crash <b>steps</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> makes his wish of a large pile of Wumpa Fruit, much to the Viscount's grief.

500|$|The album {{opens with}} Bono and The Edge's {{acoustic}} [...] "Original of the Species" [...] (2004). Turlington {{said of the}} track, [...] "Bono wrote the song with his daughters in mind. It's wishful and imparts the idea that, 'I'm here and I'm watching you take your <b>steps</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> I'm supporting your independence, {{but at the same}} time, I don't want you to make mistakes.' Any parent can relate to that." [...] The song is followed by Eddie Vedder's acoustic ballad [...] "Skipping", which he wrote as a tribute to his children and features his daughter Olivia's (age 6) voice {{at the start of the}} track, saying [...] "check, check" [...] and [...] "daddy, daddy". Turlington said of Vedder's involvement: Eddie was amazing to accept this project while in the midst of so much. I spoke to him and exchanged several emails about his contribution. [...] "Skipping" [...] is such a sweet song and I just love that his daughter Olivia has a little cameo at the start. He once wrote me saying that his girls would be proud one day that their dad contributed to such a meaningful project.|$|E

At {{the end of all}} these arguments, Jesus silently <b>steps</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> kisses the old man on his lips. The Grand Inquisitor, stunned and moved, tells Him he must never come there again, and lets Him out. Alyosha, after hearing this story, goes to Ivan and kisses him softly, with an unexplainable emotion, on the lips. Ivan shouts with delight, because Alyosha's gesture is taken {{directly}} from his poem. The brothers then part.|$|E

Suddenly, an old lady <b>steps</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> demands, [...] "Why don't you all come home!" [...] The choirs answer her: [...] "There is no 'home'. Even angels are always on the move". Eve {{presents}} Michael with a final gift, a terrestrial globe as a souvenir of his journey around the earth. Lucifer appears, first as a gremlin who springs out of the globe and presents Michael with his own, smaller blue globe. Michael passes it around to the choir, which infuriates the gremlin, who makes threatening gestures and summons assistance.|$|E

He's upset and angry, especially when Kat tries to explain how he made her feel when he accused her of sleeping with someone else when she got pregnant again. He obviously didn't mean the things he said then – he just said them {{in the heat of the}} moment, but those words have stuck with Kat." [...] Asked whether Alfie appreciates Kat's honesty, he replied: [...] "Not at all – he'd rather not know. Deep down, Alfie knows that Kat has done things in the past that maybe she shouldn't have, but he didn't know all the details. Now he knows Kat has been unfaithful, he has got to confront the fact. The jury is still out on that one," [...] he explained. [...] "I don't know, if I'm honest. They always seem to take two <b>steps</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> then one step back... They do tend to come through these things, so who knows?" ...|$|E

2500|$|James Worsdale's A Cure for a Scold {{is also a}} ballad opera. First {{performed}} at Drury Lane in 1735, starring Kitty Clive and Charles Macklin, A Cure for a Scold was an adaptation of Lacy's Sauny the Scot rather than Shakespeare's original Taming of the Shrew. Petruchio was renamed Manly, and Katherina was renamed Margaret (nicknamed Peg). At the end, there is no wager. Instead, Peg pretends she is dying, and as Petruchio runs for a doctor, she reveals she is fine, and declares [...] "you have taught me what 'tis to be a Wife, and I shall make it my Study to be obliging and obedient," [...] to which Manly replies [...] "My best Peg, we will exchange Kindness, and be each others Servants." [...] After the play has finished, the actress playing Peg <b>steps</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> speaks directly to the audience as herself; [...] "Well, I must own, it wounds me to the Heart/To play, unwomanly, so mean a Part./What – to submit, so tamely – so contented,/Thank Heav'n!

5000|$|In Pakistan, a {{variation}} that uses two dice allows backwards movement.
