5|$|In {{contrast}} to his usual practice elsewhere in the Historia ecclesiastica, Bede provides no information about his <b>sources</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Cædmon story. Since a similar paucity of sources is also characteristic of other stories from Whitby Abbey in his work, this may indicate that his knowledge of Cædmon's life was based on tradition current at his home monastery in (relatively) nearby Wearmouth-Jarrow.|$|E

5|$|Further {{scattered}} details can {{be found}} in Pausanias's Description of Greece, while the Byzantine Suda dictionary of the 10th century AD preserves some anecdotes found nowhere else. Minor <b>sources</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> period include the works of Pompeius Trogus (epitomized by Justinus), Cornelius Nepos and Ctesias of Cnidus (epitomized by Photius), which are not in their original textual form. These works are not considered reliable (especially Ctesias), and are not particularly useful for reconstructing the history of this period.|$|E
5|$|In the 1940s, Harold Innis {{reached the}} height of his {{influence}} in both academic circles and Canadian society.

Additionally, small rodents, including squirrels, mice, and rats, are important in the sylvatic transmission cycle because of their importance as bloodmeal <b>sources</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> insect vectors. A Texas study revealed 17.3% percent T. cruzi prevalence in 75 specimens representing four separate small rodent species.|$|E
5|$|Surviving Pictish <b>sources</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> period are few, {{limited to}} king lists, the {{original}} {{of which was}} prepared in the early 720s, {{and a number of}} accounts relating to the foundation of St Andrews, then called Cennrígmonaid. Beyond Pictland, the principal sources are the Irish annals, of which the Annals of Ulster and the Annals of Tigernach are the most reliable. These include materials from an annal kept at the monastery of Iona in Scotland. Óengus and the Picts appear occasionally in Welsh sources, such as the Annales Cambriae, and more frequently in Northumbrian sources, of which the Continuation of Bede's chronicle and the Historia Regum Anglorum attributed to Symeon of Durham are the most important.|$|E
5|$|The Chronicle is not unbiased: {{there are}} {{occasions}} when {{comparison with other}} medieval sources {{makes it clear that}} the scribes who wrote it omitted events or told one-sided versions of stories; there are also places where the different versions contradict each other. Taken as a whole, however, the Chronicle {{is the single most important}} historical source for the period in England between the departure of the Romans and the decades following the Norman conquest. Much of the information given in the Chronicle is not recorded elsewhere. In addition, the manuscripts are important <b>sources</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> history of the English language; in particular, the later Peterborough text is one of the earliest examples of Middle English in existence.|$|E

5|$|The early republican {{constitution}} {{was dominated by}} the patricians, who monopolised all control of the magistracies, the Senate, and the voting blocs of the assemblies. Generally, it slowly developed with a tendency towards greater popular representation {{at the expense of}} the patrician class. The main historical <b>sources</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> origins of the Roman political system, Livy and Dionysius of Halicarnassus, relied heavily on the Roman annalists, who supplemented what little written history existed with oral history. This lack of evidence poses problems for the reliability of the traditional account of the republic's origins.|$|E
5|$|The four {{canonical}} gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John) are {{the foremost}} <b>sources</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> life and message of Jesus. However, {{other parts of}} the New Testament also include references to key episodes in his life, such as the Last Supper in 1 Corinthians 11:23. Acts of the Apostles (Acts 10:37–38 and Acts 19) refers to the early ministry of Jesus and its anticipation by John the Baptist. Acts 1:1–11 says more about the Ascension of Jesus (also mentioned in 1 Timothy 3:16) than the canonical gospels do. In the undisputed Pauline letters, which were written earlier than the gospels, the words or instructions of Jesus are cited several times (1 Corinthians 7:10–11, 9:14, 11:23–25, 2 Corinthians 12:9).|$|E
5|$|The main <b>sources</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{proceedings}} and vote-counts of the conclave {{come from the}} accounts Enrico Dandolo of Venice, Simon Renard (the Imperial ambassador to France), and Diego de Mendoza (ambassador to Charles V), the correspondences between Henry II and Guise and d'Este, and the diaries of the various conclavists. In particular, Angelo Massarelli, the secretary of Marcello Cervini, devotes his entire fifth diary to the conclave.|$|E
