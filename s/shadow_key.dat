Through this event, Lyle becomes privy to a vague conspiracy of violent terrorists targeting Wall Street, and his curiosity draws him into their fold. His recruitment and participation are equally inexplicable, a function of the draw of revolutionary activity and respite from the boredom of his ordinary life. His engagement with the radicals, themselves devoid of any morality or particular ideology, becomes more absurd when he attempts to inform on them to equally ill-defined government agents, and begins having sexual relationships with two other conspirators. Lyle discovers that J.

40|$|Diffused {{infrared}} {{transmission is}} one of the preferred techniques used in indoor wireless com-munications. Tolerance to shadowing and a lack of alignm ent requirements are among the many advantages offered by this technique compared to the line-of-sight techniques. However, it has its disadvantages, namely high path loss and multipath dispersion. The limitation imposed by eye-safety requirements restricts the transm itted power. Therefore, ef ® cient use of transmitted optical power is the key for practical broadband infrared systems. In this paper, we report on using a holographic diffuser for shaping of infrared radiation pattern in an indoor infrared trans-mission system. The holographic diffusers have the advantage of light weight and added ¯ exibility in the system design. The reported measurements show that employing a properly designed holographic diffuser can reduce the path loss of a nondirected optical link.

HSV color space corresponds closely to the human perception of color and it has revealed more accuracy to distinguish <b>shadows.</b> The <b>key</b> feature of this segmentation method is processing hue component of HSV on image. The components of HSV are efficiently analyzed and treated separately so that the proposed algorithm can adapt to different environmental illumination conditions and shadows. Polar and linear statistical operations have been applied to extract the background from the video frames. Morphological operations are used to reduce the noise of foreground of the input frame. Label matrix has been determined for finding the object region in the foreground image. The proposed system considered age (duration of object existence) of the objects, misses, potential detections and potential for meeting stationary objects criterions. Finally, detected objects have been indicated with yellow boundary and frame number.

40|$|Molecular {{dynamics}} {{refers to}} the computer simulation of a material at the atomic level. An open problem in numerical analysis is to explain the apparent reliability of molecular dynamics simulations. The difficulty is that individual trajectories computed in molecular dynamics are accurate for only short time intervals, whereas apparently reliable information can be extracted from very long-time simulations. It has been conjectured that long molecular dynamics trajectories have low-dimensional statistical features that accurately approximate those of the original system. Another conjecture is that numerical trajectories satisfy the shadowing property: that they are close over long time intervals to exact trajectories but with different initial conditions. We prove that these two views are actually equivalent to each other, after we suitably modify the concept of <b>shadowing.</b> A <b>key</b> ingredient of our result is a general theorem {{that allows us to}} take random elements of a metric space that are close in distribution and embed them in the same probability space so that they are close in a strong sense. This result is similar to the Strassen-Dudley Theorem except that a mapping is provided between the two random elements. Our results on shadowing are motivated by molecular dynamics but apply to the approximation of any dynamical system when initial conditions are selected according to a probability measure. ...|$|R

40|$|Explaining the {{excellent}} practical {{performance of the}} simplex method for linear programming {{has been a major}} topic of research for over 50 years. One of the most successful frameworks for understanding the simplex method was given by Spielman and Teng (JACM ` 04), who the developed the notion of smoothed analysis. Starting from an arbitrary linear program with d variables and n constraints, Spielman and Teng analyzed the expected runtime over random perturbations of the LP (smoothed LP), where variance σ^ 2 Gaussian noise is added to the LP data. In particular, they gave a two-stage shadow vertex simplex algorithm which uses an expected O(d^ 55 n^ 86 σ^- 30) number of simplex pivots to solve the smoothed LP. Their analysis and runtime was substantially improved by Deshpande and Spielman (FOCS ` 05) and later Vershynin (SICOMP ` 09). The fastest current algorithm, due to Vershynin, solves the smoothed LP using an expected O(d^ 3 ^ 7 n σ^- 4 + d^ 9 ^ 7 n) number of pivots, improving the dependence on n from polynomial to logarithmic. While the original proof of Spielman and Teng has now been substantially simplified, the resulting analyses are still quite long and complex and the parameter dependencies far from optimal. In this work, we make substantial progress on this front, providing an improved and simpler analysis of shadow simplex methods, where our main algorithm requires an expected O(d^ 2 √(n) σ^- 2 + d^ 5 ^ 3 / 2 n) number of simplex pivots. We obtain our results via an improved <b>shadow</b> bound, <b>key</b> to earlier analyses as well, combined with algorithmic techniques of Borgwardt (ZOR ` 82) and Vershynin.

The duration of the stress <b>shadow</b> is a <b>key</b> question in San Francisco Bay area seismic hazard assessment. This study presents a three-dimensional (3 -D) finite element simulation of post- 1906 stress recovery. The model reproduces observed geologic slip rates on major strike-slip faults and produces surface velocity vectors comparable to geodetic measurements. Fault stressing rates calculated with the finite element model are evaluated against numbers calculated using deep dislocation slip. In the finite element model, tectonic stressing is distributed throughout the crust and upper mantle, whereas tectonic stressing calculated with dislocations is focused mostly on faults. In addition, the finite element model incorporates postseismic effects such as deep afterslip and viscoelastic relaxation in the upper mantle. More distributed stressing and postseismic effects in the finite element model lead to lower calculated tectonic stressing rates and longer stress shadow durations (17 – 74 years compared with 7 – 54 years).

By applying geometry approximation to the split parts, shadow maps concentrate on the visible portions of the scene to exploit available shadow maps resolution as possible.

40|$|An {{investigation}} into top management team {{action in the}} practice of strategy was conducted within three UK universities. This study examined strategic practices from a top team perspective in each institution over a seven year period. The aim was to understand the processes by which top teams put strategy into practice within the context of organisational structures that may both constrain and enable strategic action. A theory of practice was developed with which to guide the investigation. This theory, and interrogation of a diverse body of organisation studies and strategic management literature indicated a longitudinal, processual research design as appropriate, accessing rich contextual data over embedded levels of analysis. To this end, 49 interviews, 51 meetings observations, <b>shadowing</b> of <b>key</b> participants, and extensive documentary and archival searches were conducted. Analysis of such data led to the identification of three levels of analysis which are pertinent to an understanding of top management team engagement in strategy as practice. First, the top team process of strategic thinking and acting. Secondly, the structuring characteristics of organisational context. Thirdly, the strategy processes which form the interplay between top team actors and organisational context {{in the practice of}} strategy. These levels of analysis were arranged in an explanatory framework. This framework shows how top management teams engage in strategy as practice through the use of situated and distributed practices which mediate between their behaviour, the organisational contexts in which they act, and the strategic activities which are pursued. To better model the dynamic nature of these relationships, strategy as practice was conceptualised as occurring within an activity system. The activity system comprised three domains, top team actors, organisational structures, and strategic activity, mediated by practices which are situated and distributed across the domains. This research is underpinned by the theoretical approaches of structuration and social becoming, which interpellate the tendency to both recursiveness and transformation in social order. These tendencies are conceptualised as the capacity for continuity and change in the process of putting strategy into practice. The activity system model developed was used to explain how practices are implicated in the mediation of continuity and change...|$|R

Instructional leaders held fundamental, underlying beliefs categorized as: (1) having a process-oriented sense of direction for their school focusing on continued growth and improvement (2) viewing leadership as a collaborative effort; and (3) involving themselves {{as a part of the}} context of the school. These underlying beliefs guided the principal instructional leadership behaviors of: (1) managing and monitoring curriculum and instruction; (2) actively promoting a positive learning environment for students, staff, and parents; (3) actively promoting teacher growth and decision making; and (4) actively communicating. ^ Applications to school districts and institutions responsible for training elementary principals were made. An instructional orientation should be adopted in training elementary principals to be instructional leaders. It is suggested that pre-service and in-service principal training feature instructional leadership case studies and involve collegial cluster groups or peer coaching arrangements. Through journals, aspiring and practicing principals could record their efforts within the context of the elementary school setting.
