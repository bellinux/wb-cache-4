50|$|Biostimulation is the {{addition}} of nutrients with trace elements, electron donors or electron acceptors to stimulate activity and growth of natural indigenous microbial communities. It can range from simple fertilization or infiltration (called passive biostimulation) to more aggressive injections to the ground, and is widely used at US DOE sites. Nitrate is used as nutrient to biostimulate the reduction of uranium, because it serves as very energetically favorable electron acceptor for metal-reducing bacteria. However, many of these microorganisms (Geobacter, Shewanella or Desulfovibrio) exhibit resistance genes to heavy metals that limit their ability to bioremediate radionuclides. In these particular cases, a carbon source such as ethanol {{is added to the}} medium to promote the reduction of nitrate at first, and then of uranium. Ethanol is also used in <b>soil</b> <b>injection</b> systems with hydraulic recirculations: it raises the pH and promotes the growth of denitrifying and radionuclide-reducing bacteria, that produce biofilms and achieve almost 90% decrease in the concentration of radioactive uranium.|$|E

The standard insecticide, Lorsban, performed very well, but since this product is especially harmful to parasitoids it is not considered to have a good fit in IPM programs where parasitoid conservation is emphasized. The currently labeled alternative, Applaud, was an effective treatment and should be considered for citrus mealybug control to avoid destruction of parasitoids.

40|$|In this paper, {{a simple}} {{expression}} {{to predict the}} average diameter of columns created with single, double and triple fluid jet grouting is proposed considering both {{the energy of the}} eroding jet and the resistance of the <b>soil.</b> The <b>injection</b> system (single, double or triple) and the composition of the injected fluids are taken into account on the basis of theoretical analysis of the turbulent diffusion of submerged jets. Instead of separately considering the energy of the air jet shrouding the eroding fluid, a simple parameter is introduced which represents the beneficial effect of air in reducing the energetic dissipation on the jet external surface. In this way, a new expression of the specific kinetic energy of the jet at any distance from the nozzle is proposed, which is a relevant step forward if compared with that at the nozzle or at the pump previously proposed, as it takes into account both the system characteristics and the composition of the eroding jet (either grout or water). In the expression proposed to predict the diameter of jet grouting columns, soil resistance is considered by way {{of the results of the}} standard penetration test and cone penetration test, in terms of NSPT and qc respectively.

40|$|Background: Pest control {{efficacy}} {{with some}} fumigant alternatives to methyl bromide is limited, in some cases, by relatively slower diffusion through soil {{from the point}} of injection. This is particularly a problem for deep rooted perennial crops for which fumigant transport to deep soils is needed to control plant parasitic nematodes and soil borne pathogens. Conventional fumigation systems usually are pressurized with nitrogen because of its relatively low reactivity and solubility. Recently, research suggested that fumigant dispersion in soil and pest control efficacy can be increased by using carbonated fumigants and CO 2 -pressurized fumigant injection systems (Thomas et al., 2011). However, commercial applicator safety concerns related to transporting pressurized fumigant cylinders have, thus far, limited field evaluations of fumigant dispersion and subsequent pest control in California. To evaluate this technology under local conditions and determine specific carbonation conditions that enhance fumigant movement in soil and improve efficacy, a micro spot fumigant injection system (MSFIS) was constructed. The goal of this apparatus is to allow highly accurate <b>soil</b> <b>injections</b> of CO 2 or N 2 pressurized fumigants to facilitate research on carbonation of methyl bromide alternative fumigants.

40|$|The {{prevalence}} of Mycobacterium bovis infection in cattle is increasing rapidly in some countries, including the UK and Ireland. The organism infects {{a wide range}} of mammalian hosts, and eradication of the disease is difficult if there is an extensive reservoir ill the wildlife population. Existing evidence suggests that wildlife vectors include the European badger in the UK and Ireland, the brush-tailed possum and ferret in New Zealand and ungulates in some other countries. Cattle grazing field boundaries or short swards are at particularly high risk, since the chance of contact with the intermediate host or their excreta is increased. There is evidence that the transmission of the disease between cattle following movement accounts for 10 - 15 % of outbreaks in the British Isles and that transmission can occur across farm boundaries. The {{prevalence of}} single reactors in herds suggested that within-herd transmission was not common. In herds with infected cattle, spreading slurry is a risk factor, which can be minimised by prolonged storage of the slurry, by spreading it on fields not used for grazing or by <b>soil</b> <b>injection.</b> M. bovis also survives in water and may enter the respiratory tract during drinking. It is concluded that M. bovis infection in cattle can be transmitted by a number of routes, some of which can be controlled by appropriate husbandry, but that circumstantial evidence suggests that the existence of a widespread intermediate host is the greatest contributor to infection in cattle.

40|$|Rijkswaterstaat has {{recently}} {{stated that the}} use of GeoRM is obligatory for projects with major geotechnical risks. Underground construction of freeway's in high-profile areas, such as the business district Zuidas in Amsterdam or railway links in densely populated areas, always introduce major geotechnical risks. It is not uncommon for these locations to have all the facets that require strong geotechnical risk management: underground construction occurs adjacent to high-rise structures, locations have a very busy surface area, there are financially dependent stake-holders and concerns prevail after issues on earlier projects. Rijkswaterstaat and their consultant firms are tackling this by forming a strong bridge between engineering and management using geotechnical risk management (GeoRM). In this article its main focus is translating the language of technical risks into managerial terms of cost, delay and reputation. Then actions are translated back again into countermeasures, which are often technical in nature. With a unique approach of subdividing and quantifying risks into sub-risks {{all the way down to}} a construction activity level, engineers have the ability to talk directly to the decision makers. To this end a visualization tool has been developed to assess and evaluate risk and counterfeit measures with management staff. The teams involved believe risk reduction is about real-life measures that require a level of detail and knowledge of the actual construction activities to be performed. This approach has led to real risk-reduction activities, for example: additional investigations into underground obstacles (e. g. existing steel anchors) and actions for removing them beforehand, preventing stagnation later. But also: site investigation activities associated with specific construction methods like <b>soil</b> <b>injection</b> which may turn out to be unfeasible if soil parameters don't come out as expected...|$|E

40|$|Compensation {{grouting}} {{is often}} {{employed as a}} mitigation technique to reduce the settlements induced by tunnelling. The efficiency of compensation grouting, defined as {{the ratio of the}} volume of heave induced at ground surface to the volume of injected grout, is strongly dependent on grout properties, <b>injection</b> characteristics and <b>soil</b> properties. In clayey soils, site observations and laboratory tests show high values of compensation efficiency immediately after injection. However the efficiency can decrease with time if positive excess pore water pressures develop in the <b>soil</b> during the <b>injection</b> process. Conversely, in sandy soils, a loss of volume occurs due to pressure filtration of the grout during and soon after the injection process, which reduces the compensation efficiency. This paper describes an analytical model {{that can be used to}} evaluate the volume loss produced by pressure filtration of cement-bentonite grouts as a function of <b>soil,</b> grout and <b>injection</b> parameters. The magnitude of pressure filtration is evaluated as the grout efficiency, which is given by the ratio of the volumes of the final grout body to the injected grout. Results show that the grout efficiency increases with decreasing soil permeability and with increasing grout bentonite content. The result of a grout injection test on a silty soil is back-analysed using this approach in which the grout efficiency is first evaluated through the proposed filtration model and then used to calibrate a numerical simulation of the test. The good agreement between experimental data and computed results shows that prediction of the efficiency of compensation grouting can be improved using the proposed approach...|$|R
