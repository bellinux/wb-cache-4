5|$|Surface-to-surface missile battalions {{were divided}} into three or four batteries, each {{equipped}} with one missile launcher. They operated thirty FROG-3 and eighteen <b>SCUD</b> <b>missile</b> launchers. The FROG-3, a tactical missile first introduced in 1960, was being replaced in other non-Soviet Warsaw Pact armies. Proven to be fairly inaccurate in combat, FROG and SCUD missiles would be ineffective weapons carrying conventional high-explosive warheads. Tipped with nuclear or chemical warheads, however, they could be devastating. According to one former Romanian official writing in 1988, Romania produced chemical agents that could be delivered by battlefield missiles.|$|E
5|$|France also {{committed}} military {{assets to}} the coalition; in October 1990, eight Jaguar A aircraft {{along with several}} Dassault Mirage F1CR reconnaissance aircraft {{were sent to the}} Middle East, with the Mirages, which had more advanced avionics, acting as guides for the Jaguars. Owing to obsolete navigational systems being unable to provide the accuracy required, both French and British Jaguars were quickly modified with GPS receivers, RAF Tornadoes also required adaption to a lesser extent. The French Jaguar force in Saudi Arabia built up to a maximum of 28 aircraft, which carried out 615 combat sorties, with one Jaguar damaged by an Iraqi surface-to-air missile. Typical targets were Iraqi armoured units, <b>Scud</b> <b>missile</b> sites, and naval vessels.|$|E
5|$|The {{commission}} is thought by some foreign policy analysts {{to be the}} basis for President George W. Bush's axis of evil line in his 2002 State of the Union Address, in which he accused Iraq, Iran, and North Korea of being state sponsors of terrorism and of pursuing weapons of mass destruction. The Rumsfeld Commission grouped the three countries together because they all were believed to be pursuing ballistic missile programs based on the <b>Scud</b> <b>missile.</b> In the pre-9/11 days of the Bush presidency, the administration had focused heavily on developing a national missile defense system to counter such threats. A month after the address, former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, who appointed Rumsfeld as head of the commission, mentioned the importance of the commission's findings in relation to the US ability to predict the threat posed by the axis members.|$|E

5|$|Operation Desert Storm {{began on}} 17 January 1991, {{but for the}} first two weeks 3rd Battalion only {{conducted}} sporadic engagements with its Iraqi counterparts across the border. That all changed on 29 January, when several Iraqi divisions unexpectedly crossed the border and seized the Saudi town of Khafji, less than 15kilometers north of 3rd Battalion's position. During the attack the Executive Officer along with the Battalion Sergeant Major drove into the town on a rescue mission looking for two Army soldiers who had been captured. Although they were unable to find them, the Marines from 3rd Battalion did encounter an Iraqi patrol and exchanged rounds with them before escaping. While Saudi and Qatari units ultimately retook the town, 3rd Battalion played a vital role in both coordinating the attack and blocking further Iraqi advances southward. In addition, several heavy machine guns and forward air controllers from the battalion were shifted over to the Saudis and took place in the assault. From 19â€“21 February, 3rd Battalion moved from Al Mish'ab to the forward assembly areas that it would be using to launch its attack into Kuwait. It was also during this period that 3rd Battalion was given its assignment for the ground offensive. Lacking heavy armor or motorized transport, the battalion (along with 2/3) would infiltrate Iraqi positions along the Saudi border and provide flank security {{for the rest of the}} 1st Marine Division to make its assault into Kuwait. On the night of 22 February, 3rd Battalion crossed the border into Kuwait, infiltrating past Iraqi minefields, tank traps, and other obstacles. Like many American units, 3rd Battalion encountered no Iraqi resistance and the biggest threat to the Marines came from friendly fire. Throughout the ground war, the battalion advanced steadily northwards, encountering no resistance but taking plenty of prisoners. 3rd Battalion arrived outside the Kuwait International Airport around 27 February where a <b>SCUD</b> <b>missile</b> landed near the battalion's command post. Several months later, 3rd Battalion returned to Hawaii, having suffered no combat casualties.|$|E

25|$|F-15Es {{attacked}} various heavily defended targets throughout Iraq, prioritizing <b>SCUD</b> <b>missile</b> sites. Missions {{with the}} objective of killing Iraqi President Saddam Hussein were undertaken with several suspected locations bombed by F-15Es. Prior to the operation's ground war phase, F-15Es conducted tank plinking missions against Iraqi vehicles in Kuwait. Following 42 days of heavy combat, a cease fire came into effect on 1 March 1991, leading to the establishment of Northern and Southern no-fly zones over Iraq.|$|E

25|$|Wallace left NBC in 1989 for ABC. At ABC News, Wallace was {{the senior}} {{correspondent}} for Primetime Thursday and occasionally hosted Nightline. During the first Gulf War in 1991, he reported from Tel Aviv on the Iraqi Scud missiles attacks. At the time, the Israeli Government {{did not want}} to advertise where the Scuds landed, in order to prevent the Iraqis from making adjustments to their launchers. On one episode of Nightline, Wallace started describing the location in Tel Aviv where a <b>Scud</b> <b>missile</b> landed. Nightline host Ted Koppel cut him off, and asked him to point to a general area rather than give a specific location.|$|E
25|$|Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD), {{formerly}} Theater High Altitude Area Defense, is an American {{anti-ballistic missile}} defense system designed to shoot down short, medium, and intermediate range ballistic missiles in their terminal phase (descent or reentry) by intercepting with a hit-to-kill approach. THAAD was developed after the experience of Iraq's <b>Scud</b> <b>missile</b> attacks during the Gulf War in 1991. The THAAD interceptor carries no warhead, but relies on its kinetic energy of impact to destroy the incoming missile. A kinetic energy hit minimizes the risk of exploding conventional warhead ballistic missiles, and the warhead of nuclear tipped ballistic missiles will not detonate on a kinetic energy hit.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{appointment}} to Warrant Officer 1 in November 1983, he completed the UH-60 Blackhawk Aviators Qualification Course and {{was assigned to}} the 377th Medical Evacuation Company in Seoul, South Korea. By the time he was 24, he had flown more than 150 medevac missions in the UH-1 and UH-60. After 18 months, he moved to the 101st (Division) Aviation Battalion at Fort Campbell, Kentucky. As a Chief Warrant Officer 2, he attended the instructor pilot course and flew air assault missions in the UH-60. Durant joined the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (SOAR) on August 1, 1988. Assigned to D Company, he performed duties as Flight Lead and Standardization Instructor Pilot. He participated in combat operations Prime Chance; Just Cause; and Operation Desert Storm, where he was the first U.S. helicopter pilot to shoot at a <b>SCUD</b> <b>missile</b> launcher.|$|E
50|$|The Patriot was {{the first}} {{deployed}} tactical ABM system, {{although it was not}} designed from the outset for that task and consequently had limitations. It was used during the 1991 Gulf War to attempt to intercept Iraqi <b>Scud</b> <b>missiles.</b> Post-war analyses show that the Patriot was much less effective than initially thought because of its radar and control system's inability to discriminate warheads from other objects when the <b>Scud</b> <b>missiles</b> broke up during reentry.|$|R
50|$|The {{co-operation}} between Bull and Saddam Hussein was {{an immediate}} threat to Iran and Israel, as Iran had endured an eight-year-long war with Iraq, and Israel had previous military engagements with Iraq during the Arab-Israeli war. Watching development of the gun, Israel feared {{it could be used}} to launch nuclear weapons, but the re-designed <b>SCUD</b> <b>missiles</b> were of greater concern at that moment. As for Iran, it was under threat from both Bull's supergun and his re-designed <b>SCUD</b> <b>missiles.</b>|$|R
50|$|On October 20, Moshe Dayan and the Israeli Chief of Staff David Elazar {{considered}} conquering Port Said and Port Fuad. During the discussion, {{the question}} of Scud launches as an Egyptian response was taken into account. In addition, Israel also bombed the Egyptian missile batteries at Port Said several times. The Egyptians claim that Israel attacked there because of its fear of <b>Scud</b> <b>missiles</b> being positioned there, {{due to the fact}} that <b>Scud</b> <b>missiles</b> positioned at Port Said could threaten all of Israel's big cities.|$|R
25|$|Iraq said {{it would}} rebuild the {{facility}} and France agreed, in principle, {{to aid in the}} reconstruction. Because of a mix of factors, including the Iranâ€“Iraq War, international pressure and Iraqi payment problems, negotiations broke down in 1984 and France withdrew from the project. The Osirak facility remained in its damaged state until the 1991 Persian Gulf War, when it was completely destroyed by subsequent coalition air strikes by the United States Air Force, one of them being the Package Q Strike. During the war, 100 out of 120 members of the Knesset signed a letter of appreciation to Menachem Begin, thanking him for ordering the attack on Osirak. In July 1991, Begin, in a rare interview granted to Israel Army Radio, claimed that the Gulf War, and especially the Iraqi <b>Scud</b> <b>missile</b> attacks on Israel during that war, vindicated his decision to bomb the reactor.|$|E
500|$|The {{commission}} continued briefings until mid-July 1998. [...] During {{that time}} they were frustrated by the compartmentalization of intelligence, the refusal of analysts to speculate or hypothesize on given information, and what they considered general inexperience in the intelligence personnel. The group did not limit their interviews {{to members of the}} government, but also spoke with employees of Boeing and Lockheed Martin, especially about how <b>Scud</b> <b>missile</b> designs could be used as the basis for a long-range ballistic missile program.|$|E
500|$|In January 2003, {{components}} of the 45th Infantry Brigade were deployed to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. Approximately 230 light infantry soldiers from A Company and B Company, 1st Battalion, 179th Infantry Regiment comprised Task Force Ironhorse under the United States Army Central Command (ARCENT). [...] Their primary mission {{leading up to the}} invasion of Iraq was to provide security for Patriot missile sites defending the respective countries from impending <b>SCUD</b> <b>missile</b> attacks. [...] In March 2003, Company A was ordered from the area in and around Riyadh to the northern border cities of Tabuk and Arar, Saudi Arabia in defense of Iraqi retaliation and security of strategically redeployed Patriot Missile sites. Company B was ordered to advance into Iraq from the Kuwaiti border to provide security for ammo caches and forward operating Patriot missile sites. Task Force Ironhorse was the first deployment of Oklahoma National Guard infantry soldiers to a combat zone since the Korean War (members of the Oklahoma National Guard deployed during Desert Storm as Field Artillery units). Task Force Ironhorse completed their mission and returned in August 2003.|$|E

The {{success of these}} engagements, and in particular {{how many of them}} were real targets, is still controversial. Postwar video analysis of presumed interceptions by MIT professor Theodore Postol suggests that no Scud was actually hit; this analysis is contested by Peter D. Zimmerman, who claimed that photographs of the fuselage of downed <b>SCUD</b> <b>missiles</b> in Saudi Arabia demonstrated that the <b>SCUD</b> <b>missiles</b> were fired into Saudi Arabia and were riddled with fragments from the lethality enhancer of Patriot Missiles.|$|R
