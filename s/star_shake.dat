The series was set to <b>star</b> <b>Shake</b> It Up star, Zendaya, who would play 16-year-old Katy Cooper, an outspoken and confident technology wiz and skilled black belt, who discovers that both her parents are spies who expect her to follow in their footsteps. Production on the pilot was set to begin in early 2014. On November 6, 2013, Zendaya tweeted about the pilot, saying she wants {{to bring back the}} [...] "cool Disney Channel", mentioning shows like That's So Raven, The Proud Family, and Kim Possible. It was ordered to series by Disney Channel in May 2014, with the series now under the title K.C. Undercover. The series was released on Watch Disney Channel on January 1, 2015, and was followed by the television premiere on January 18, 2015. The first season consisted of 27 episodes. On May 15, 2015, Disney Channel renewed the series for a second season, which premiered on March 6, 2016. On August 1, 2016, People revealed that the series had been renewed for a third season. The third season premiered on Disney Channel on July 7, 2017.|$|E

40|$|In this Thesis, {{we study}} the {{dynamics}} of rotating relativistic stars. We are mainly interested in {{the dynamics of}} slowly rotating stars with crusts and rapidly rotating uid stars. We also study the dynamics of non - rotating strongly magnetized stars with crusts. After stressing the importance of our studies in modern Astrophysics (Chapter 1) we describe rotating or / and magnetized relativistic stars in equilibrium (Chapter 2). We rst try to describe them with methods that involve multipole expansions. Later on, we show that two - dimensional methods are preferable. Then, we study small - amplitude pulsations of such stars. We rst derive the relevant general - relativistic equations (Chapter 3). We focus on {{the dynamics of the}} uid (we work in the Cowling approximation) and then on that of the spacetime (Inverse Cowling approximation). Subsequently, we solve these equations to obtain numerical results (Chapters 4, 5, 6 and 7). First, we present results for non - rotating neutron stars, then we move on to slowly rotating stars and nally we examine non - rotating magnetized stars with crusts. Neutron stars with crusts are met in many astrophysical cases. For example, phenomena involving rotating neutron stars with crusts and magnetic elds are the radio - emission of pulsars and the X - ray emission of magnetars. In the physical scenaria underlying these phenomena, the magnetic eld lines are frozen into the crust regions and any magnetic - eld perturbations induce elastic perturbations in the stellar crusts. Inversely, elastic perturbations in neutron <b>star</b> crusts <b>shake</b> the magnetic eld lines and modify the lightcurves of such objects. Rotating relativistic stars are also potential sources of gravitational radiation. It was found by Chandrasekhar, Friedman and Schutz that neutron stars could be unstable to the emission of gravitational radiation, if rotating quite rapidly. Their instability could grow high and limit their rotational periods considerably, emitting, at the same time, copious amounts of gravitational radiation. On the other hand, the description of equilibrium con gurations and dynamics of rapidly rotating stars is a di#cult task as it demands two - dimensional numerical techniques. In Chapter 2 we describe how neutron star models are being constructed. We start with the easiest construction, that of a static, spherically symmetric star. We continue by describing the structure equations of a slowly rotating relativistic star. We, rst, keep only linear terms in (the angular velocity of the star) and construct slowly rotating - but spherically symmetric - stars. Then, we derive the structure equations in second order in and we see that the crust now enters into the structure equations and plays {{an active role in the}} deformation of the star. An alternative, two - dimensional construction is then presented. Finally, we show how magnetized neutron stars are being constructed. In Chapter 3 we consider small - amplitude pulsations of these stars. We work in the framework of General Relativity but we also adopt the Cowling approximation. We focus on pulsations of slowly rotating relativistic stars with crusts, magnetized relativistic stars with crusts and rapidly rotating uid relativistic stars. In the case of relativistic stars with crusts, we solve eigenvalue problems while, in the case of rapidly rotating uid stars, we work with two - dimensional evolution equations. These equations do not come straightforward; we work on Einstein equations and on the equations of the uid in order to bring them in a good form for their numerical solution. We present our results in Chapters 4, 5, 6 and 7. In the rst one, we study pulsation modes of non - rotating, non - magnetic neutron stars with crusts. We calculate many spheroidal and toroidal modes for polytropic and for realistic neutron star models. In the next two chapters, we evaluate the e ects of rotation and magnetic elds, respectively, on these modes. We compare with previous Newtonian treatments and we quantify the relativistic corrections. In the last one, we attempt to calculate modes with two - dimensional numerical evolutions but we nd ourselves successful only in the case of non - rotating stars. For rotating stars, numerical instabilities take place and do not allow us to extract useful physical conclusions. ...|$|R
60|$|Into {{that same}} black night, almost, indeed, {{into the very}} same layer of starlit air, Katharine Hilbery was now gazing, {{although}} not {{with a view to}} the prospects of a fine day for duck shooting on the morrow. She was walking up and down a gravel path in the garden of Stogdon House, her sight of the heavens being partially intercepted by the light leafless hoops of a pergola. Thus a spray of clematis would completely obscure Cassiopeia, or blot out with its black pattern myriads of miles of the Milky Way. At the end of the pergola, however, there was a stone seat, from which the sky could be seen completely swept clear of any earthly interruption, save to the right, indeed, where a line of elm-trees was beautifully sprinkled with stars, and a low stable building had a full drop of quivering silver just issuing {{from the mouth of the}} chimney. It was a moonless night, but the light of the stars was sufficient to show the outline of the young woman's form, and the shape of her face gazing gravely, indeed almost sternly, into the sky. She had come out into the winter's night, which was mild enough, not so much to look with scientific eyes upon the <b>stars,</b> as to <b>shake</b> herself free from certain purely terrestrial discontents. Much as a literary person in like circumstances would begin, absent-mindedly, pulling out volume after volume, so she stepped into the garden in order to have the stars at hand, even though she did not look at them. Not to be happy, when she was supposed to be happier than she would ever be again--that, as far as she could see, was the origin of a discontent which had begun almost as soon as she arrived, two days before, and seemed now so intolerable that she had left the family party, and come out here to consider it by herself. It was not she who thought herself unhappy, but her cousins, who thought it for her. The house was full of cousins, much of her age, or even younger, and among them they had some terribly bright eyes. They seemed always on the search for something between her and Rodney, which they expected to find, and yet did not find; and when they searched, Katharine became aware of wanting what she had not been conscious of wanting in London, alone with William and her parents. Or, if she did not want it, she missed it. And this state of mind depressed her, because she had been accustomed always to give complete satisfaction, and her self-love was now a little ruffled. She would have liked to break through the reserve habitual to her in order to justify her engagement to some one whose opinion she valued. No one had spoken a word of criticism, but they left her alone with William; not that that would have mattered, if they had not left her alone so politely; and, perhaps, that would not have mattered if they had not seemed so queerly silent, almost respectful, in her presence, which gave way to criticism, she felt, out of it.|$|R
