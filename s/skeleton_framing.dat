50|$|The International Trust Company Building is an {{historic}} office building at 39-47 Milk Street in Boston, Massachusetts. The nine-story masonry-clad building {{was built in}} 1892-93 to a design by William Gibbons Preston. It is an early example {{in the city of}} Beaux Arts style, and is structurally an early prototype of the use of <b>skeleton</b> <b>framing.</b> It was enlarged in 1906, to a design by Woodbury & Leighton. It was connected by internal connections to the adjacent Compton Building in 1961, when the two buildings were under common ownership.|$|E
50|$|As the bonnet de {{police had}} no visor, {{it could not}} shield wearers' eyes {{from the sun and}} alternative, visored, caps were being experimented with. One variety resembled a modern peaked cap with wide crown and {{horizontal}} visor, with dark blue band and crimson top and undersides. Other styles appeared, cylindrical in shape, with slightly sunken crimson top, crimson sides (flamme), national red/white/blue cockade top front, and dark blue band (turban) with flat rounded visor and retractable leather neckflap. Early models had stiff lining, but other models had cane (rattan) <b>skeleton</b> <b>framing</b> for weight-reduction. Obviously influenced by the old bonnet de police, this cap became known as the casquette d'Afrique (African cap) and became universal wear amongst France's European troops. Later models were more stylish and lightweight, one definitive trend being to taper the flamme/body toward the top, so the round top had a smaller diameter than the bottom of the cap and to tilt the flamme/body toward the front. Apart from being lighter, this also gave the cap a rakish, elegant appearance.|$|E

40|$|The {{main point}} of this {{research}} was работы являлось to create a stand to explore the application of short pulse radio signals in radar. The stand consists of antenna and waveguide elements. Each element out to guarantee operation in X-band with 10 percent working bank and 5 percent instantaneous bandwidth and the power output gotta be 1. 5 kW. The form of the antenna beam patten need to be similar to cosecant pattern Side-lobe level need to be less than - 25 dB. Background level got to be at least - 30 dB. Wave friction, which is radiated from the antenna aperture, got to simultaneous formed in a space. As the most easily realizing variant of such antenna cutting parabolic mirror antenna with offset irradiator was chosen. The irradiator phase centre is shifted from {{the focal point of the}} paraboloid to form a cosecant pattern. Method of physical optics is used for the analysis of antennas. Calculating pattern of horn irradiator and mirror antenna which were met the requirements was received. The construction choice was limited by the preproduction possibilities, mass and dimensions. Mirror antenna consists of <b>skeleton</b> <b>framing</b> with mirroring elements which are fixing on it. Mirroring plane is multiplex and consists off rectangular planes made by hydroforming method. Antenna was tested and adjusted at the antenna darkroom after fabricating. The results were meted requirements. Besides the mirror antenna and the horn antenna waveguide elements, waveguide bends and rotating joints were calculated, manufactured and researched. All calculations included the manufacturers tolerances, technological corner R etc. As the construction base of rotating joint coaxial waveguide was chosen. The decision on the one hand: let keep the axial symmetry of excited wave at rotating part of the waveguide, on the other hand there’s no necessary to apply resonant rings, which are plug into dielectric beads for the transition from rotating ring part to rectangular waveguide. Devices’ parts are interconnected by choke-flange coupling. Chosen construction provides required power level. Researching of all devices shows there’s satisfying to the requirements. Model could be modifying. Horn irradiator could be replaced and plane mirror subdish could be placed at irradiator frame. </p...|$|E

40|$|Construction {{of first}} {{drainage}} tubular systems has been facing such problem as their protection against silting-up by soil particles penetrating through input openings. Searches and investigations {{have led to}} usage of various fibrous materials which are {{playing the role of}} filters. At the beginning glass-fibre mats have been widely applied for this purpose. However, the mats possessing good filtration properties have had a number of fundamental disadvantages. Works executed at the Institute of Mechanics of Metal Polymeric Systems (Gomel, Republic of Belarus) have played a big role in usage of plastic materials. A new technology has been developed with the purpose to obtain thermally-bonded fibres from thermoplastic material. The fibres have been called as polyethylene mats. Investigation of their properties has been carried out under load and it has revealed that their lateral and longitudinal permeability becomes equal at specified pressures, in other words the material takes an isotropic state. The considered interactions of filtrating material and <b>skeleton</b> <b>frame</b> have shown that the main water filtration occurs directly above perforation holes while the material above blind frame sections does not participate in the process. Due to this a new design of the filtrating element has been developed and it can be used in water intake systems for surface and underground water. The filtrating element consists of the <b>skeleton</b> <b>frame</b> with openings and a filtration covering which is installed on the frame. Water-feeding groove cavities are located on the <b>skeleton</b> <b>frame</b> and they are dispersing from perforation holes in the form of beams. These grooves can have side branches of the second, third and other orders. As beam-like arrangement of grooves creates the shortest flow paths for filtrated water from periphery to frame holes and area of groove cross section exceeds the area of poral holes in water in-take covering by a factor of hundreds, it is possible to ensure free water flow to openings. So such approach makes it possible to obtain high element productivity because practically the whole surface of the water in-take covering is involved in the process. Such filtrating elements can be used in various constructions for filtration of liquid and gas. </p...|$|R
