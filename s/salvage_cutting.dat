50|$|There {{are a few}} {{controls}} for beech bark disease. One important management strategy is prohibiting the movement of nursery stock or other materials that may harbor the beech scale insect. Insecticides, generally not applied under forest conditions, are primarily used on high-value ornamental trees. The use of other organisms as controls is also a possibility. The ladybird beetle is a beetle that preys on the beech scale insect. A fungus that parasitizes the Neonectria fungus could also be employed. The problem with using these organisms to control beech bark disease is that {{their impact on the}} disease has not been evaluated extensively.

30|$|Four {{aspects of}} the forest {{management}} explained the large difference of productivity: i) different types of regeneration, i.e. natural before harvest (D) vs plantation after harvest (RO), the lack of tending, the lack of thinning; ii) the delayed harvests; iii) by freezing any management (as prescribed by the technical norms), {{during a period of}} 25  years at a time, when forest stands already reached the optimum dimensions for commercial use and only <b>salvage</b> <b>cuttings</b> are allowed; and iv) a harvest approach taking over 30 – 70 years to be completed. The “freeze” period of “no management” is of special concern: 25  years may be short for the lifetime of a tree, but it is a long period for management and essential for economic reasons.

40|$|Uneven-aged {{forests are}} assumed {{to have a high}} {{stability}} against storm damage but have rarely been analysed for vulnerability to storm damage {{due to a lack of}} a sufficient empirical database. Here we model storm damage in uneven-aged forest to analyse major factors that may determine the sensitivity of this type of forests to storms based on a broad database. Data are derived of public forests in the canton Neuchâtel in West Switzerland that are dominated by silver fir and Norway spruce and managed since the beginning of the 20 th century following a single-tree selection system. A unique dataset of periodical (every 5 - 10 years) full inventories measuring the diameter of every single tree including <b>salvage</b> <b>cuttings</b> was available for the investigation. The time series reached back until 1920 and covered an area of 16 000 ha divided into 3000 divisions. The effect of a major winter storm (‘Lothar') in December 1999 on these forests was investigated using a subset of 648 divisions. The influence of the vertical stand structure on the vulnerability of storm damage was studied using logistic regression models. To facilitate the analyses, an index of closeness to a J-shaped distribution (LikeJ) based on the number of trees in different diameter classes was developed. Besides structural indices, variables representing stand characteristics, soil-related and topography-related variables were included. The results of our study show that the overall damage level of the investigated forests was rather low. The variables that entered the model for the uneven-aged stands were different to those that are normally significant for even-aged stands. While variables like stand structure, the timing of the harvesting and topographic variables entered a multivariate statistical model as significant predictors, standard predictors for storm damage in even-aged stands such as stand density, thinning intensity or species composition were not significant. We hypothesize that the uneven-aged structure of the investigated forests may be one reason for the low damage level we observed but emphasize the need for more detailed research to support this conclusio...|$|R

40|$|Spruce {{bark beetle}} {{outbreaks}} {{are common in}} Norway spruce forests following windstorm damage, due to ample availability of brood material. The realization of an outbreak depends on factors regulating the Ips typographus population dynamics, such as weather conditions and <b>salvage</b> <b>cutting.</b> In this study, we take an ecosystem modelling approach to analyse the influence of multiple environmental factors on the risk for I. typographus outbreaks. Model calculations of I. typographus phenology and population dynamics {{as a function of}} weather and brood tree availability were developed and implemented in the LPJ-GUESS ecosystem modelling framework. The model simulations were driven by gridded climate data covering Sweden with a spatial resolution of 0. 5 ° and a daily temporal resolution. Records on storm damage and I. typographus outbreak periods in Sweden for the period of 1960 – 2009 were used for model evaluation, and a sensitivity analysis was performed to examine the model behaviour. The model simulations replicated the observed pattern in outbreak frequency, being more common in southern and central Sweden than in northern Sweden. A warmer climate allowing for more than one generation per year can increase the risk for attacks on living trees. The effect of countermeasures, aiming at either reduce the availability of brood material or the I. typographus population size, is dependent on a non-linear relation between I. typographus attack density and reproductive success. The sensitivity analysis indicated a major reduction in the risk of attacks on living trees by timely <b>salvage</b> <b>cutting</b> and cutting of infested trees.

This study investigates the time consumptions on specific work elements in timber skidding, develops time prediction models for timber skidding work elements and assesses the production rates for timber skidding in reduced accessibility stands where windthrow <b>salvage</b> <b>cuttings</b> were applied. Following a time study done for two skidders (TAF 690 OP and TAF 657) operating simultaneously in the same felling area, {{it has been found}} that, in average, in a delay free skidding cycle time, lateral winching accounted for a share of 26 - 33 %, on-trail skidding accounted for a share of 64 - 71 % and landing operations accounted for a share of 3 %. Total delays accounted for 51 % and 43 % of the total work time in the case of TAF 690 OP skidder and TAF 657 skidder respectively. Regression models for lateral winching (both skidders) revealed that the winching distance and the number of logs were the relevant predictors for the time consumption estimation (p < 0. 01), whereas in the case of on-trail skidding only the skidding distance was relevant (p < 0. 01). For the overall skidding operation (excluding landing operations) winching and skidding distances were found as relevant predictors (p < 0. 01) in case of TAF 690 OP, whereas the number of logs became an additional relevant predictor in case of TAF 657. In conditions of an average winching distance of 19. 90 m and an average on-trail skidding distance of 980. 32 m, the time study yielded a net production rate of 7. 70 m 3 h- 1 and a gross production rate of 3. 75 m 3 h- 1 in the case of TAF 690 OP skidder.

Methods and ResultsAll data were collected for 128 consecutive patients who underwent CB-PTA to improve infrainguinal arterial circulation between January 2003 and July 2007. One-hundred thirty-five limbs with PAOD (claudication, n = 19; critical limb ischemia [CLI], n = 116) were treated. Patency was evaluated by clinical examination and duplex ultrasonography. A total of 203 lesions (183 stenoses, 20 occlusions) were treated in 66 femoropopliteal and 69 infrapopliteal arterial segments. The TransAtlantic Inter-Societal Consensus (TASC) classification of the primary lesions was A in 41. 5 %, B in 45. 2 %, C in 8. 2 %, and D 5. 1 %. Mean follow-up was 16. 1 ± 9. 7 months. The overall technical success rate was 96. 3 % and the complication rate was 8. 9 %. There were two (1. 5 %) perioperative deaths. The primary patency rate was 82. 1 % at 12 - and 24 -months in patients with claudication (femoropopliteal lesions).

50|$|The typical wagon with 40 to 50 in {{diameter}} wheels could easily move {{over rough ground}} and rocks without high centering and even over most tree stumps if required. The wooden wheels were protected with an iron rim (tire) typically about 1.5 in wide. These iron tires were installed hot so they would shrink tightly onto the wood wheel when they cooled. Nevertheless, it was often necessary to use wooden wedges to keep the iron rim on or soak the wheel in water. The dry desert air sometimes dried the tires so much the iron tire was prone to fall off. Wagon wheels could often be repaired by blacksmiths found along the way or replaced with an abandoned wagon's wheel but otherwise if damaged the wagon usually had to be abandoned. Some damaged wagons were <b>salvaged</b> by <b>cutting</b> the wagon in half and converting the front or rear half of the wagon into a two-wheeled cart. Most of the wagons had a large toolbox, mounted on the left side, usually containing an ax, wagon jack, ropes, short handled shovel, wheel chains for securing the wheels for steep descents and extra chain to hook up another team if double teaming was required for steep ascents and other tools often needed or used. The wagon jack was used for raising each wagon wheel. Then the large axle nut could be unscrewed and the wheel removed for greasing which was required periodically. The wheels were greased {{with a mixture of}} tar or pine resin and lard contained in a covered wooden bucket or large ox horn often hanging from the rear axle to keep its greasy contents away from other goods. Starting with at least one gallon of wagon grease was recommended. On a wagon there was essentially no reverse or brakes and the turning radius was nearly always greater than 125 ft so the teamsters had to think about how to extract the wagon and his team from wherever they went.|$|R

40|$|Ten heavily logged hemlock (Tsuga canadensis (L.)

All stands were dominated by hemlock, with 66 to 99 % of total stand basal area. <b>Salvage</b> or pre-emptive <b>cutting</b> removed more than 50 % of overstory stems and more than 65 % of the basal area in each stand. Logging generated soil scarification, large accumulations of slash, and more rapid and pronounced microenvironment and vegetation changes than HWA damage. Percent open sky was 25 to 35 % in newly cut forests, around 10 % in HWA infested forest, and less than 5 % in older cuts and healthy stands. A high percentage of residual hemlock and hardwood stems died within several years of logging, presumably due to environmental conditions. Black birch (Betula lenta L.) seedling densities and percent cover of brambles (Rubus L. spp.), sedges (Carex L. spp.) and hay-scented fern (Dennstaedtia punctilobula (Michx.) Moore) were significantly higher in cut stands versus HWA damaged and healthy stands. High black birch sapling densities (7, 000 ha – 1) were common in the oldest cuts but not in adjacent, HWA-damaged portions of these stands. Residual hardwood trees had little influence on the species composition of emerging vegetation in logged sites. Conifer species were virtually absent in the regeneration following logging and HWA infestation, suggesting that silvicultural intervention will be necessary if evergreen species are desired.

Osim toga, u šumarskoj je praksi oštećenost krošnje ključni kriterij pri doznaci stabala u redovnim i sanitarnim sječama. Cilj je ovoga rada bio istražiti dinamiku oštećenosti krošanja stabala hrasta lužnjaka i utjecaja oštećenosti krošnje na prirast temeljnice tijekom duljeg razdoblja u dvije najvažnije šumske zajednice hrasta lužnjaka u Hrvatskoj. Istraživanja su obavljena na trajnim pokusnim plohama u zajednici hrasta lužnjaka i običnoga graba na gredi (II-G- 10) i u zajednici hrasta lužnjaka s velikom žutilovkom u nizi (II-G- 20). Obuhvaćeno je ukupno 38 pokusnih ploha od kojih je na 13 obavljena ponovna izmjera i procjena oštećenosti krošanja s intervalima izmjere od 9 do 17 godina. Udio stabala sa značajno oštećenom krošnjom naglo se povećava nakon starosti sastojine od oko 70 godina. Najveći intenzitet odumiranja (70 % u II-G- 10 i 50 % u II-G- 20) zabilježen je kod stabala s oštećenošću krošnje preko 60 %. U sastojinama V. i VI. dobnog razreda, stabla sa značajno oštećenom krošnjom imala su i značajno manji prirast temeljnice u usporedbi s vitalnim stablima sličnih prsnih promjera i širina krošnje. Udio značajno oštećenih stabala, kao i utjecaj oštećenja krošnje na prirast temeljnice, vrlo su slični u obje istraživane zajednice. Međutim, zabrinjava činjenica da je u sastojinama II-G- 20 u samo jednom desetljeću evidentirano značajno povećanje sa 26 % na 70 % udjela značajno oštećenih lužnjakovih stabala, pa se postavlja pitanje u kojem će se smjeru dalje razvijati ove sastojine.

The crown {{damage of}} a tree has a very {{prominent}} place among the broad spectrum of factors defining the pedunculate oak (Quercus roburL.) decline and dieback, {{largely due to the}} fact that it represents the first visible symptom of the decline in tree‘s vitality. Besides, crown damage is a key factor for the selection of trees with high risk of dying during the sanitary and <b>salvage</b> <b>cuttings,</b> in order to salvage high value timber that would be otherwise lost or severely degraded when the tree dies. Aim of this contribution is to investigate dynamics of crown damage of pedunculate oak trees, as well as the effect of the crown damage on tree’s basal area increment during longer time period in two most important types of pedunculate oak forests in Croatia. Research was done on permanent experimental plots situated in the stands of pedunculate oak and common hornbeam (II-G- 10) and stands of pedunculate oak and Genista elata (II-G- 20). In total, 38 permanent experimental plots were used, out of which 13 were re-measured with intervals of 9 to 17 years (Table 1). In first measurement, all trees on plots were permanently tagged, and map of tree locations and crown projections was made. Trees were measured for diameter at breast height (DBH), total tree height and height to crown base. Crown length was calculated as the difference between the total tree height and height to crown base, while the crown ratio was calculated as the ratio of crown length and total tree height. From the map of horizontal crown projections the average crown width was calculated as a mean of the maximal and minimal crown diameters. Assessment of the crown damage was done according to the methodology of the ICP Forests Programme, whereby the trees were tallied into following five crown damage (CD) classes: 0 ( 25 %) and stand age was examined for the 33 plots of forest type II-G- 10 spanning almost entire rotation length of pedunculate oak forests in Croatia (II. to VII. age class). Linear regression with logarithmic transformation of independent variable (stand age) was used for this analysis. According to the model, significant increase of severely damaged trees occurs after the stand age of 70 years (Figure 2 A). The stands in the type II-G- 20 departed significantly from the model in the first measurement, with only 26 % of severely damaged trees compared to 76 % in stands of II-G- 10. By the second measurement, however, these plots also conformed to the behavior predicted by the model (Figure 2 B), due to the deterioration of the overall crown condition. Distributions of oak trees by the CD classes in two measurements (Figure 3) reveal the direction of the crown damage dynamics, which is in more detail presented in the Figure 4. In both forest types, the change in crown class of the oak trees was predominantly in the direction of the worsening crown health status. Negative trend is more pronounced in the II-G- 20 forest type. According to the CD classes recorded in the first measurement (Figure 5), decline intensity was most pronounced in the CD class 3, from which 70 % and 50 % of trees in forest types II-G- 10 and II-G- 20, respectively, died off by the second measurement. This result provides further foundation for the use of the CD assessments in the day-to-day forestry as a reliable indicator of the tree’s imminent death. Effect of crown damage on the basal area increment of oak trees was examined through: (i) the regression analyses of basal area increment per year per tree over DBH (Figure 6) and crown width (Figure 7), comparison of distributions of healthy and severely damaged trees over basal area increment classes (Figure 8), and by comparison of median values of basal area increment of healthy and severely damaged trees by forest types and stand age classes (Figure 9). Crown damage was found to have a significant impact on the basal area increment of pedunculate oak trees, with severely damaged trees having significantly lower basal area increment compared to healthy trees of the similar dimensions. These differences were very similar for both forest types...|$|R

40|$|Dieback {{of silver}} fir in Croatia, {{especially}} in the Dinaric part, is associated with complex changeable effects of abiotic and biotic factors. In industrial forests, the volume of dieback trees or volume of trees cut down in <b>salvage</b> <b>cutting</b> is most often used for showing tree dieback intensity, {{and can be used}} as an indicator of forest stand health status (Capecki 1981). The aim of this research was to show the correlation of silver fir dieback with habitat and structural factors, calculate the intensity of dieback according to volume, and determine tree dieback dynamics and effects of habitat factors on concentration of essential mineral nutritive elements in needles and soil. The research was carried out in the mountainous part of Croatia, in beech-fir and fir forests of Gorski Kotar. The research included the forest stands of disrupted stability and structure, at the border of the natural range of sliver fir towards a warmer area and optimum area of silver fir i. e. central part of Gorski Kotar. Data for wood mass of dieback silver fir trees were collected for the selected management units at the level of all compartments and subcompartments in the management unit. The data were being collected for twelve years (1995 – 2007). In the researched area, needle sampling from tree crowns was carried out on trees with three different levels of defoliation (60 %). Dry needle mass was determined as well as concentration of K, Ca and Mg. Soil chemical analysis included soil reaction, and amount of phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) in the soil. The average annual silver fir dieback intensity for forest stands at the border of the natural range was 18. 3 m 3 /ha or 9. 2 % of silver fir growing stock, and in forest stands in the central part of Gorski Kotar it was 6. 2 m 3 /ha or 4. 1 %. The maximum annual dieback intensity in forest stands at the border of the natural range was 113. 0 m 3 /ha, and in forest stands in the central part of Gorski Kotar it was 55. 4 m 3 /ha. For forest stands with recorded dieback, the average annual increment was 2. 7 m 3 /ha, and in forest stands in the central part of Gorski Kotar it was 3. 3 m 3 /ha. In forest stands with sliver fir dieback, dieback intensity was higher than the value of the growing stock (Table 1). Intensity of the average annual silver fir dieback at the border of the natural range was from 1. 6 to 18. 8 m 3 /ha, and in forest stands in the central part of Gorski Kotar from 5. 0 to 7. 5 m 3 /ha (Fig. 1). In forest stands at the border of the natural range, the highest average annual silver fir dieback intensity was recorded in silver fir forest with hard fern (18. 63 m 3 /ha), and the lowest in silver fir forest with small-reed (11. 5 m 3 /ha). Dieback intensity in the central part of Gorski Kotar was lower, the highest being in silver fir forest with small-reed (14. 4 m 3 /ha), and the lowest in the Dinaric beech-fir forest (5. 8 m 3 /ha) (Fig. 2). In forest stands at the border of the natural range, the highest dieback intensity was recorded at west and southwest exposition, and the lowest at northwest and east exposition. In forest stands in the central part of Gorski Kotar the highest dieback intensity was at southwest, and the lowest at north exposition. In relation to altitude, the most severe dieback intensity was observed at lower, and the lowest at higher altitudes (Table 2). According to the results shown in Table 3, in forest stands at the border of the natural range, tree dieback intensity significantly and positively correlates with exposition, growing stock (0. 23 *) and number of silver fir trees (0. 12 *), and negatively with terrain slope (– 0. 15 *), altitude (– 0. 11 *), precipitation quantities in vegetation period (– 0. 11 *), soil water balance (– 0. 11 *) and increment (– 0. 16 *). In forest stands in the central part of Gorski Kotar silver fir dieback intensity significantly and negatively correlates with altitude (– 0. 14 *), precipitation quantities in vegetation period (– 0. 18 *) and soil water balance (– 0. 12 *). Calcium negatively correlates with vegetation air temperatures (– 0. 23 *), and positively with vegetation precipitations (0. 23 *), which is important for drought periods because 2007 was a »drought« year (Review No. 18). The correlation coefficients of Mg concentration show the same trend with air temperatures (– 0. 48 *) and precipitation quantities (0. 48 *). The correlation of Ca concentration and soil pH value is positive and amounts to 0. 34 *, while the correlation of dry needle mass and defoliation is – 0. 40 * (Table 4). The concentration of phosphorous and potassium in the soil correlates positively with vegetation air temperatures (0. 34 *, 0. 29 *), and negatively with vegetation precipitations (– 0. 34 *, – 0. 29 *) and altitudes (– 0. 52 *, – 0. 50 *) (Table 5). Dry needle mass (g), concentration of potassium, calcium and magnesium (mg/g) decrease with the increase of tree crown defoliation (Table 6). In the current year the mass of dry needles is 0. 48 g, and in the last year it was 0. 52 g. In the current year the concentration of calcium in needles is 12. 34 mg/g, and in the last year it was 17. 06 mg/g (Table 7). The data of Fužine and Rijeka Forest Office show that the percentage share of <b>salvage</b> <b>cutting</b> or dieback of silver fir amounts up to 100 % according to prescribed yield (annual allowable cut) for the area of management units Brloško, Kobiljak-Bitoraj and Jelenje Velo (border of the natural range). On the contrary, the percentage share of salvage cuttings according to prescribed yield {{in the area of the}} management units Ravna Gora and Višnjevica (central part of Gorski Kotar) amounts up to 15 %. In the area of Gorski Kotar tree dieback was recorded on all types of geological basis and forest soils, and in all silver fir forest associations. At the border of the natural range the highest dieback intensity was recorded in silver fir with hard fern, and in the central part of Gorski Kotar in silver fir with small-reed. According to our research, the highest tree dieback volumes (m 3 and m 3 /ha) occur at the lowest altitudes and on mild slopes. Tikvić et al. (2008) reported the same results. Due to higher air temperatures and lower precipitation quantities, soil evaporation is higher at lower altitudes. During drought periods at these altitudes, soil water balance is low. Thomas et al. (2002) found positive correlation between precipitation quantities and altitude and considers that this is suitable for forest tree development at higher altitudes. In forest stands at the border of the natural range, tree dieback volume (m 3 /ha) is the lowest at northeast expositions, and the highest at west exposition, followed by different variants of south expositions, and compartments of different expositions. This was expected since the south and west expositions are warmer and more exposed to unfavourable currents from west Europe. The decrease of vegetation precipitation quantities significantly increases the volume of silver fir dieback. These results correspond to the results reported by other authors (Markalas 1992, Thomas et al. 2002, Tikvić et al. 2008). Even within the silver fir areal in one country, there are significant differences in factors affecting tree dieback. This can be proved by comparing the factors that affect dieback at the border of the natural range and in the central part of Gorski Kotar. Air temperature increase and precipitation quantities decrease result in the decrease of concentration of calcium and magnesium in silver fir needles, which is significant for drought periods and air temperature increase. Dry needle mass and calcium concentration are significantly higher in the last year than in the current year needles. According to the Meteorological and Hydrological Service, the year 2007 (current year needles) was a drought year. In the forest stand at the border of the natural range where dieback was recorded, the average annual dieback intensity was six times higher than the average annual increment, while in forest stands in the central part of the area, dieback intensity was two times higher than the annual increment. Tree dieback was recorded at all expositions, terrain slopes and altitudes, as well as in all forest associations. At the border of the natural range, relief, climate and structural factors have dominant effect on tree dieback, while in the central part of Gorski Kotar climatic factors have dominant effect on tree dieback. The increase of tree crown defoliation causes the decrease of dry needle mass, as well as the concentration of K, Ca and Mg. Drought resulted in lower concentration of magnesium and calcium in silver fir needles, and lower dry needle mass...|$|E

Promjene ekoloških čimbenika utječu značajno na nadzemni i podzemni dio ekosustava. Naglašena osjetljivost jelovih i bukovo-jelovih šuma na rubu njezina areala, odumiranje stabala te propadanje čitavih sastojina pridonijeli su da istraživanja provedemo upravo u tim šumama. Cilj je ovih istraživanja definirati stanišne čimbenike koji su u vezi s odumiranjem stabla obične jele u gorskoj Hrvatskoj, te utjecaj stanišnih čimbenika na stanje hraniva u iglicama i u tlu. Prikupljeni su podaci o drvnom volumenu odumrlih stabala obične jele na razini svih odjela/odsjeka gospodarske jedinice. Iglice su uzorkovane sa stabala triju različitih stupnjeva osutosti, a uzorci tla s dubine od 30 cm. Sastojine na rubu areala obične jele u Gorskom kotaru uvelike odumiru u odnosu na sastojine u unutrašnjosti areala Gorskoga kotara. U razdoblju od 1995. do 2007. u sastojinama na rubu areala u Gorskom kotaru prosječno je godišnje odumrlo 18, 3 m 3 /ha obične jele. U istom razdoblju u sastojinama u unutrašnjosti areala Gorskoga kotara prosječno je godišnje odumrlo 6, 2 m 3 /ha. U sastojinama na rubu areala i u unutrašnjosti areala Gorskoga kotara prosječno godišnje odumiranje stabala obične jele veće je od godišnjega prirasta. Intenzitet odumiranja stabala (m 3 /ha) statistički značajno negativno i vrlo slabo korelira s vegetacijskom količinom oborine (mm) i vodnom bilancom tla (mm). U sastojinama na rubu areala i u unutrašnjisti areala Gorskoga kotara inklinacija i nadmorska visina statistički značajno i negativno utječu na intenzitet odumiranja stabala (m 3 /ha). Kalcij i magnezij negativno i statistički značajno koreliraju s vrijednostima {{temperature}} zraka, a pozitivno s količinom oborine u vegetacijskom razdoblju, što je značajno za razdoblje suše i povećanih vrijednosti temperature zraka na području istraživanja. Dieback {{of silver}} fir in Croatia, {{especially in the}} Dinaric part, is associated with complex changeable effects of abiotic and biotic factors. In industrial forests, the volume of dieback trees or volume of trees cut down in <b>salvage</b> <b>cutting</b> is most often used for showing tree dieback intensity, {{and can be used}} as an indicator of forest stand health status (Capecki 1981). The aim of this research was to show the correlation of silver fir dieback with habitat and structural factors, calculate the intensity of dieback according to volume, and determine tree dieback dynamics and effects of habitat factors on concentration of essential mineral nutritive elements in needles and soil. The research was carried out in the mountainous part of Croatia, in beech-fir and fir forests of Gorski Kotar. The research included the forest stands of disrupted stability and structure, at the border of the natural range of sliver fir towards a warmer area and optimum area of silver fir i. e. central part of Gorski Kotar. Data for wood mass of dieback silver fir trees were collected for the selected management units at the level of all compartments and subcompartments in the management unit. The data were being collected for twelve years (1995 – 2007). In the researched area, needle sampling from tree crowns was carried out on trees with three different levels of defoliation (60 %). Dry needle mass was determined as well as concentration of K, Ca and Mg. Soil chemical analysis included soil reaction, and amount of phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) in the soil. The average annual silver fir dieback intensity for forest stands at the border of the natural range was 18. 3 m 3 /ha or 9. 2 % of silver fir growing stock, and in forest stands in the central part of Gorski Kotar it was 6. 2 m 3 /ha or 4. 1 %. The maximum annual dieback intensity in forest stands at the border of the natural range was 113. 0 m 3 /ha, and in forest stands in the central part of Gorski Kotar it was 55. 4 m 3 /ha. For forest stands with recorded dieback, the average annual increment was 2. 7 m 3 /ha, and in forest stands in the central part of Gorski Kotar it was 3. 3 m 3 /ha. In forest stands with sliver fir dieback, dieback intensity was higher than the value of the growing stock (Table 1). Intensity of the average annual silver fir dieback at the border of the natural range was from 1. 6 to 18. 8 m 3 /ha, and in forest stands in the central part of Gorski Kotar from 5. 0 to 7. 5 m 3 /ha (Fig. 1). In forest stands at the border of the natural range, the highest average annual silver fir dieback intensity was recorded in silver fir forest with hard fern (18. 63 m 3 /ha), and the lowest in silver fir forest with small-reed (11. 5 m 3 /ha). Dieback intensity in the central part of Gorski Kotar was lower, the highest being in silver fir forest with small-reed (14. 4 m 3 /ha), and the lowest in the Dinaric beech-fir forest (5. 8 m 3 /ha) (Fig. 2). In forest stands at the border of the natural range, the highest dieback intensity was recorded at west and southwest exposition, and the lowest at northwest and east exposition. In forest stands in the central part of Gorski Kotar the highest dieback intensity was at southwest, and the lowest at north exposition. In relation to altitude, the most severe dieback intensity was observed at lower, and the lowest at higher altitudes (Table 2). According to the results shown in Table 3, in forest stands at the border of the natural range, tree dieback intensity significantly and positively correlates with exposition, growing stock (0. 23 *) and number of silver fir trees (0. 12 *), and negatively with terrain slope (– 0. 15 *), altitude (– 0. 11 *), precipitation quantities in vegetation period (– 0. 11 *), soil water balance (– 0. 11 *) and increment (– 0. 16 *). In forest stands in the central part of Gorski Kotar silver fir dieback intensity significantly and negatively correlates with altitude (– 0. 14 *), precipitation quantities in vegetation period (– 0. 18 *) and soil water balance (– 0. 12 *). Calcium negatively correlates with vegetation air temperatures (– 0. 23 *), and positively with vegetation precipitations (0. 23 *), which is important for drought periods because 2007 was a »drought« year (Review No. 18). The correlation coefficients of Mg concentration show the same trend with air temperatures (– 0. 48 *) and precipitation quantities (0. 48 *). The correlation of Ca concentration and soil pH value is positive and amounts to 0. 34 *, while the correlation of dry needle mass and defoliation is – 0. 40 * (Table 4). The concentration of phosphorous and potassium in the soil correlates positively with vegetation air temperatures (0. 34 *, 0. 29 *), and negatively with vegetation precipitations (– 0. 34 *, – 0. 29 *) and altitudes (– 0. 52 *, – 0. 50 *) (Table 5). Dry needle mass (g), concentration of potassium, calcium and magnesium (mg/g) decrease with the increase of tree crown defoliation (Table 6). In the current year the mass of dry needles is 0. 48 g, and in the last year it was 0. 52 g. In the current year the concentration of calcium in needles is 12. 34 mg/g, and in the last year it was 17. 06 mg/g (Table 7).
