60|$|The {{first thing}} that caught our eye on board the negro boats which were {{alongside}} was, of course, the baskets of fruits and vegetables, of which one of us at least had been hearing all his life. At St. Thomas's we had been introduced to bananas (figs, as they are miscalled in the West Indies); to the great green oranges, thick- skinned and fragrant; to those junks of sugar-cane, some two feet long, which Cuffy and Cuffy's ladies delight to gnaw, walking, sitting, and standing; increasing thereby {{the size of their}} lips, and breaking out, often enough, their upper front teeth. We had seen, and eaten too, the <b>sweet</b> <b>sop</b> {25a}--a passable fruit, or rather congeries of fruits, looking like a green and purple strawberry, of the bigness of an orange. It is the cousin of the prickly sour-sop; {25b} of the really delicious, but to me unknown, Chirimoya; {25c} and of the custard apple, {25d} containing a pulp which (as those who remember the delectable pages of Tom Cringle know) bears a startling likeness to brains. Bunches of grapes, at St. Kitts, lay among these: and at St. Lucia we saw with them, for the first time, Avocado, or Alligator pears, alias midshipman's butter; {26a} large round brown fruits, to be eaten with pepper and salt by those who list. With these, in open baskets, lay bright scarlet capsicums, green coconuts tinged with orange, great roots of yam {26b} and cush-cush, {26c} with strange pulse of various kinds and hues. The contents of these vegetable baskets were often as gay-coloured as the gaudy gowns, and still gaudier turbans, of the women who offered them for sale.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The atemoya is {{a hybrid}} fruit {{obtained}} by crossing of cherimoya (Annona cherimola Mill.) with <b>sweet</b> <b>sop</b> (Annona squamosa L.). The information about chemical composition of atemoya is scarce. The mineral composition was evaluated employing Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometry (ICP OES) and the centesimal composition and the physico-chemical parameters were assessed employing procedures {{described in the}} AOAC methods. The total phenolic compounds (TPC) and total flavonoids (TF) were determined using spectroanalytical methods. Considering the Reference Daily Intake (RDI), the concentrations of K, Cu and Vitamin C found in atemoya were the highest, representing about 32, 23 and 37 % of the RDI, respectively. The total carbohydrates were 32 g 100 g- 1 and the soluble solids was equivalent to (32. 50 ± 0. 03) °Brix. The result for TPC was 540. 47 ± 2. 32 mgGAE 100 g- 1 and the TF was 11. 56 ± 1. 36 mgQE 100 g- 1. The exploratory evaluation of 42 atemoya samples was performed through Principal Component Analysis (PCA), which discriminated green and ripe fruits according to their mineral composition. The elements that contributed most for the variability between green and ripe fruits were: Ba, Ca, Cu, K, Mg and P...|$|E
40|$|IntroductionFruit and {{vegetable}} consumption may reduce risk for chronic disease and obesity. Children 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s fruit {{and vegetable}} intake is mediated by a preference or willingness to try them. This study 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s primary objective was to adapt the previously validated WillTry tool and to evaluate the adapted version among children in Guam. MethodsAdaptations to the WillTry tool included both novel fruits and vegetables unique to Guam and common ones. Children aged 3 to 11 years who attended 2 community-based summer day camps in 2013 were shown images matching 14 food questions in an initial interview and in a second interview conducted 3 to 72 hours later. Responses were 22 ̆ 0 ac 1 ̆ 53 no, 22 ̆ 0 ac? 22 ̆ 0 ac 1 ̆ 53 maybe, 22 ̆ 0 ac? or 22 ̆ 0 ac 1 ̆ 53 yes 22 ̆ 0 ac? and were coded as 1, 2, or 3, respectively. A higher score indicated more willingness to try fruits and vegetables. Factor analyses determined components of willingness. Psychometric properties and reliability were analyzed. ResultsSixty-five children completed the first interview, and 64 completed the second. Factor analyses revealed 3 components (scales) : 1) local novel (guava, breadfruit, eggplant, <b>sweet</b> <b>sop,</b> star apple, taro leaves), 2) local common (carrot, papaya, long beans, salad greens), and 3) imported (apple, canned peaches, canned corn). All but the imported scale had sufficient internal consistency (Cronbach 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s 1 > 0. 69). Each scale had substantial reliability (ICC > 0. 76). We found no significant differences by age, sex, or type of camp for any scale. Mean scores were 2. 1 (local novel), 2. 4 (local common), and 2. 7 (imported), and all were significantly different. ConclusionThe adapted WillTry was culturally relevant and had psychometric properties {{similar to those of}} the original. An unexpected finding was the tool 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s potential for documenting the nutrition transition. 1 U 01 CA 130784 - 01 /CA/NCI NIH HHS/United State...|$|E
