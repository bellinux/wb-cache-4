The aim is to sustain systems that collect information about contexts and user actions {{over a period of}} time and supply it to applications that dynamically adapt to context changes. <b>Situated</b> <b>computing</b> systems have various architectures, but most of them include a middleware layer that supports equipment with limited computing resources and offers functionalities that simplify applications development, deployment, execution, and maintenance. Middleware and architectures are the focus of this paper, which presents the main concepts, research results, and future trends in middleware for <b>situated</b> <b>computing.</b> Service oriented, event driven, agent-based, and peer-to-peer architectures are discussed. Middleware issues for <b>situated</b> <b>computing,</b> embedded devices, autonomic space management, proactive services, context awareness, and smart spaces are tackled as well...|$|E

Concern about such issues has contributed to give shape to the design space of sustainable HCI (SHCI); a space whose boundaries are at times blurred. On the one hand, some, design “sustainable” information technology based on visions of the world that do not really question limits to continuous economic growth and, on the other hand, others embrace the design of information technology from stances that acknowledges limits (i. e., economic, ecological, energetic). This paper introduces the perspective of social ecology into SHCI. This perspective provides us with a core set of principles that makes us <b>situate</b> <b>computing</b> at the intersection of physical (natural) and moral (human) qualities of our human environment systems.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Situated</b> design <b>computing</b> is an {{approach}} {{to the use of}} computers in design based on situated cognition. It is founded on two concepts: situatedness and constructive memory. These have the capacity to explain a range of design behaviors but have proven to be difficult to fully comprehend. This paper pre-sents analogies with developments in physics that aim to assist in the compre-hension of these foundational ideas. The ideas are drawn from the develop-ments in the notions of space and observations in physics since, to a degree, they parallel the developments in constructive memory and situatedness. ...|$|R

This paper presents the motivation and development details of a sensor and actuator framework, together with its associated description language, developed for widely decentralized software systems. The framework was originally developed with web services and grid computing in mind. Hence, the paper argues that the developed approach is applicable to widely decentralised grids. To portray our proposed approach, the paper uses an illustrative example taken from an experimental case-study developed using the PlanetLab overlay. The latter is an open community research testbed and overlay for Planetary-scale services. In addition, the paper will present an evaluation of the work, and then conclude with general remarks and an indication of further works.

40|$|Empowerment is a {{recently}} introduced intrinsic motivation algorithm {{based on the}} embodiment of an agent and {{the dynamics of the}} world the agent is <b>situated</b> in. <b>Computed</b> as the channel capacity from an agent???s actuators to an agent???s sensors, it offers a quantitative measure of how much an agent is in control of the world it can perceive. In this paper, we expand the approximation of empowerment as a Gaussian linear channel to compute empowerment based on the covariance matrix between actuators and sensors, incorporating state dependent noise. This allows {{for the first time the}} study of continuous systems with several agents. We found that if the behaviour of another agent cannot be predicted accurately, then interacting with that agent will decrease the empowerment of the original agent. This leads to behaviour realizing collision avoidance with other agents, purely from maximising an agent???s empowermen...|$|R

40|$|When people {{interact}} with computers, {{they have to}} pay attention for things that are not related to the situation of the problems because the interfaces are not contextualized to their working environment.

It presents broader theoretical framework to help understand the notion of embodiment and its relevance to <b>situated</b> <b>computing.</b> It explains in detail how the ethos in current research practice concerning embodiment is somewhat misplaced. It explains what may cause embodied experience in interactive environments, and draws constitutive understanding {{about the idea of}} space, objects and their relationships to the human subject in this regard. It denounces tangible computing's claims for physically based interface being a prerequisite for embodied interaction experience and explains the correct relevance of tangibility in interfaces. Thus, it outlines how exactly, tangibility, space, objects or their virtual counterparts (computational metaphors) fit into embodied perspective. The thesis also presents an in-depth analysis of context aware systems' architecture and exposes the limitations of context modelling and context meaning determination processes. It defines what these limitations are, where the problems are located in system design process and shows why they occur. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

40|$|People of Mesoamerican descent are the {{fastest-growing}} {{population in the}} U. S., yet public schooling institutions continue to push for the erasure of Mesoamerican historical knowledges through present-day colonialism. Public schools reproduce a raced, gendered and economically stratified academic pipeline. This pipeline is especially evident in computer science (CS), {{one of the most}} segregated fields in education that promotes an unquestioned digitized approach to living, learning, and dying, primarily for capital gain. This Critical Narrative Inquiry centers Mesoamerican epistemology by describing student activism and adult support through the lens of Itzel, a high school junior, in three organizational tiers: a student-led organization, a CS classroom and a larger schooling community. The foundational framework of this study stems from Critical Theory in a Xicana Sacred Space, a method of reflexivity that relies on critical discourses and material practices through a focus on decolonial scholarship. I include auto-ethnography as I draw upon empirical observation, inquiry and analysis of my experience as a unique `insider'. The central question that guides this study is: How may Mesoamerican academic cultural practices provide a foundation for a positive learning ecology of cultural academic identities in three organizational levels of a public high school, especially in spaces that have been historically segregated, like computer science education? Over the course of three years (2009 - 2012), and using a Grounded Theory approach to data collection and analysis, I highlighted the interconnections between the themes that emerged to build a Critical Narrative Inquiry. I begin with the narratives that develop within the microcosm of a student-led organization about ancestral computing for food justice. Itzel's participation details how a student-led initiative of promoting ancestral praxis interacts with computing for social change. With collaborative adult support, Itzel navigates several dimensions of her identity in her cultural academic journey developing critical consciousness for collective action while healing the neoliberal sickness in public schooling as a continued movement for educational excellence entre el vivir comunitario. This empirical study reveals Mesoamerican academic cultural practices as a Figured World (FW), a socially constructed cultural world that Itzel and others create. This world exposes ancestral computing (AC) practices [...] a critical approach to <b>situating</b> <b>computing,</b> or digital activism, from a familial historical perspective of communal vision [...] and reveal that social relevance can foster positive cultural identities as academic practices in schooling, even in the most barren sites of diversity. The scholarly significance of this work is threefold; it: 1) reveals how Mesoamerican familial practices motivates positive cultural identities as academic practices; 2) spawns a counter-culture that promotes critical thinking for collective agency and responsible technology production towards el vivircomunitario; and 3) illustrates a model that bridges student-led initiatives to classroom and neighborhood wide spaces...|$|R
40|$|Culturally {{embedded}} <b>computing</b> explicitly <b>situates</b> embedded <b>computing</b> in society, individual experience, culture, and history. Based on {{this new}} emphasis, five projects explore alternatives to traditional humancomputer interaction design. Imagine a world without architects, where only engineers construct buildings. With a keen eye toward functionality, these engineers would make sure the buildings were sound, but something would be lacking. People would miss the richness of architecture— the designed connection to their lives, history, and culture. The designed experience of these buildings would be irrelevant to their social and personal concept of buildings. Yet {{this is the world}} researchers are inadvertently creating with ubiquitous computing. Most discussions about ubiquitous computing rely on an engineering perspective, centering on the fact that computing is leaving the desktop. But in leaving the laboratory and workplace, computing is crossing not only physical but also social and cultural boundaries. It’s becoming embedded not only in physical environments but also in culture, society, and history. Designing and building these new technologies requires more than simply building and understanding hardware and software. It also requires analyzing and incorporating the stories, meanings, and social networks that these devices engage. Alternatives to pure engineering approaches to ubiquitous computing are emerging in digital arts and design research that encompass social and cultural meanings and implications. 1, 2 Phoebe Sengers, Joseph Kaye...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a set of}} concepts that provides the cognitive and computational foundations for answering fundamental questions about designerly behaviour. A design agent should be dynamic and able to handle changes in external representations that describe its designs and changes in how it is guided by its past experiences. Such a view of agency is afforded by <b>situated</b> design <b>computing</b> and can represent and explain much designerly behaviour. It can model how a designer can commence designing before all the requirements have been specified, how two designers presented with the same specifications produce different designs, how the same designer later confronted with the same requirements produces a different design to the previous one, and how a designer can change their design trajectory during the activity of designing. This view is built upon three foundational concepts: knowledge grounded in interaction, constructive memory, situatedness. The concepts build on notions of memory that are often traced back to Dewey and Bartlett, although we use contemporary descriptions. Memory is not understood primarily as allowing for the retrieval of an object from a data store by knowing its physical location; it is guiding an experience in a fashion similar to how past experiences progressed, and recognising that this is so.

We also assume that concrete service implementations may possibly migrate on the nodes of the infrastructure. The selection problem we address is framed as an optimization problem of the quality of service, which evaluates at run-time the optimal binding to concrete services as well as the trade-off between the remote execution of software fragments and their dynamic deployment on local nodes of the computational environment.
