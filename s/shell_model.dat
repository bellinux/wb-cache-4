5|$|Natural lead {{consists}} of four stable isotopes with mass numbers of 204, 206, 207, and 208, and traces of five short-lived radioisotopes. The high number of isotopes is consistent with lead's atomic number being even. Lead has a magic number of protons (82), for which the nuclear <b>shell</b> <b>model</b> accurately predicts an especially stable nucleus. Lead-208 has 126 neutrons, another magic number, {{which may explain why}} lead-208 is extraordinarily stable.|$|E

A theory of the fission based on <b>shell</b> <b>model</b> has been formulated by Maria Goeppert Mayer.|$|E

40|$|International audienceA {{detailed}} systematic derivation of a logarithmically discretized {{model for}} two-dimensional turbulence is given, {{starting from the}} basic fluid equations and proceeding with a particular form of discretization of the wave-number space. We show {{that it is possible}} to keep all or a subset of the interactions, either local or disparate scale, and recover various limiting forms of <b>shell</b> <b>models</b> used in plasma and geophysical turbulence studies. The method makes no use of the conservation laws even though it respects the underlying conservation properties of the fluid equations. It gives a family of <b>models</b> ranging from <b>shell</b> <b>models</b> with nonlocal interactions to anisotropic <b>shell</b> <b>models</b> depending on the way the shells are constructed. Numerical integration of the model shows that energy and enstrophy equipartition seem to dominate over the dual cascade, which is a common problem of two-dimensional <b>shell</b> <b>models...</b>|$|R

Applications to astrophysical problems are also discussed...|$|R
25|$|There are however {{problems}} with the <b>shell</b> <b>model</b> when an attempt is made to account for nuclear properties well away from closed shells. This has led to complex post hoc distortions of {{the shape of the}} potential well to fit experimental data, but the question remains whether these mathematical manipulations actually correspond to the spatial deformations in real nuclei. Problems with the <b>shell</b> <b>model</b> have led some to propose realistic two-body and three-body nuclear force effects involving nucleon clusters and then build the nucleus on this basis. Two such cluster models are the Close-Packed Spheron Model of Linus Pauling and the 2D Ising Model of MacGregor.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the nuclear}} <b>shell</b> <b>model</b> has existed since the 1960s, the {{existence}} of such superheavy, relatively stable nuclides has not been demonstrated. Like the rest of the superheavy elements, the nuclides on the island of stability have never been found in nature, and so must be created artificially in a nuclear reaction to be studied. However, scientists have not found a way to carry out such a reaction.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{incompressible}} singularity {{found in}} 3 D elasticity when Poisson’s ratio approaches 1 / 2 {{is not present}} in classical <b>shell</b> <b>models,</b> nor in the limit models obtained from 3 D elasticity when performing an asymptotic analysis {{with respect to the}} thickness parameter. However, some specific <b>shell</b> <b>models</b> – such as the 3 D-shell model – do retain the incompressible singularity. These observations raise the issue of how adequately <b>shell</b> <b>models</b> can represent incompressible conditions, which this paper aims at investigating. We first perform a combined asymptotic analysis of 3 D elasticity with respect to both the thickness parameter and Poisson’s ratio and we obtain a commuting property, which is very valuable as a justification of the concept of an “incompressible shell”, and substantiates the use of classical <b>shell</b> <b>models</b> with incompressible materials. We then show that the 3 D-shell model does not enjoy a similar commuting property; nevertheless we propose a simple modification of this model for which commuting is obtained, hence consistency with incompressibility is recovered. We also illustrate our discussions with some numerical results...|$|R

40|$|Concrete box {{structures}} are mainly used in railway and highway projects as culverts or frame bridges. Structural engineers prefer to do {{finite element method}} (FEM) analysis using shell or frame element models to obtain bending moment diagram (BMD) for design. Structures are modelled center to center supports in <b>shell</b> element <b>models.</b> BMD of general <b>shell</b> element <b>models</b> are continuous throughout the center to center spans and maximum support moment occurs at center of supports. ACI design practice recommends selecting bending moment at face of the support as design value, but BS design practice is different and obtains bending moment value at center of the support for designs. Some literature suggests tedious bending moment correction according to the stiffness {{of the members of}} the joint. In general <b>shell</b> element <b>modeling,</b> inside rigidity of supports is not considered. However general <b>shell</b> element <b>models</b> can be modified at support region to represent the rigidity of the support area. Previously tested concrete box structure was <b>modelled</b> using general <b>shell,</b> modified shell and solid elements. Results of solid element model are much closer to experimental results at supports and spans than other models. This result validated that solid element of box culvert can be used as a base for comparison of general and modified <b>shell</b> <b>models.</b> In this study, BMD of general shell, modified shell and solid element models relevant to concrete box structures were compared to load combinations relevant to Sri Lankan Railways. The results show that BMD of solid and modified shell elements are much more similar than the general <b>shell</b> <b>models.</b> Support design bending moment can be obtained from modified <b>shell</b> <b>models</b> with reliability without confusion of center or face value to select for the design as for the general <b>shell</b> element <b>models...</b>|$|R
25|$|The <b>shell</b> <b>model</b> {{was able}} to qualitatively explain many of the mysterious {{properties}} of atoms which became codified in the late 19th century in the periodic table of the elements. One property {{was the size of}} atoms, which could be determined approximately by measuring the viscosity of gases and density of pure crystalline solids. Atoms tend to get smaller toward the right in the periodic table, and become much larger at the next line of the table. Atoms {{to the right of the}} table tend to gain electrons, while atoms to the left tend to lose them. Every element on the last column of the table is chemically inert (noble gas).|$|E
500|$|Rainwater {{remained}} at Columbia as an instructor. In 1948, he began teaching courses on nuclear structure. Niels Bohr and John Wheeler {{had developed a}} theoretical treatment for nuclear fission in 1939 that they based on the liquid drop model of the nucleus. This was superseded in 1949 by Maria Goeppert Mayer's nuclear <b>shell</b> <b>model,</b> which could explain more about the structure of heavy elements than the older theory but it still had limits. At a colloquium at Columbia in 1949, Charles H. Townes reported experimental results that indicated quadrupole moments greater than those indicated by the <b>shell</b> <b>model.</b> It occurred to Rainwater {{that this could be}} explained and the differences between the liquid drop and nuclear shell models could be reconciled, if the atomic nucleus were not spherical, as had been assumed but could assume other shapes. Rainwater published his theoretical paper in 1950. By chance, that year he was sharing an office with Aage Bohr, who took up the challenge of experimentally verifying Rainwater's theory. Bohr and Ben Mottelson published their results in three papers in 1952 and 1953 that conclusively confirmed the theory. Rainwater felt that his model was overlooked. He later recalled that: ...|$|E
500|$|Stability of {{isotopes}} {{is affected}} by the ratio of protons to neutrons, and also by the presence of certain [...] "magic numbers" [...] of neutrons or protons that represent closed and filled quantum shells. These quantum shells correspond to a set of energy levels within the <b>shell</b> <b>model</b> of the nucleus; filled shells, such as the filled shell of 50 protons for tin, confers unusual stability on the nuclide. Of the 254 known stable nuclides, only four have both an odd number of protons and odd number of neutrons: hydrogen-2 (deuterium), lithium-6, boron-10 and nitrogen-14. Also, only four naturally occurring, radioactive odd–odd nuclides have a half-life over a billion years: potassium-40, vanadium-50, lanthanum-138 and tantalum-180m. Most odd–odd nuclei are highly unstable with respect to beta decay, because the decay products are even–even, and are therefore more strongly bound, due to nuclear pairing effects.|$|E

We introduce the concept of halving time statistics to have a statistically stable tool to quantify the time decay of Response Functions and Generalized Response Functions of high order. We show numerically that in <b>shell</b> <b>models</b> for three dimensional turbulence Response Functions are inertial range quantities. This is a strong indication that the invariant measure describing the shell-velocity fluctuations is characterized by short range interactions between neighboring shells...|$|R
40|$|We study <b>shell</b> <b>models</b> that {{conserve}} the analogs {{of energy}} and enstrophy and hence are designed to mimic fluid turbulence in two-dimensions (2 D). The main {{result is that the}} observed state is well described as a formal statistical equilibrium, closely analogous to the approach to two-dimensional ideal hydrodynamics of Onsager [Nuovo Cimento Suppl. 6, 279 (1949) ], Hopf [J. Rat. Mech. Anal. 1, 87 (1952) ], and Lee [Q. Appl. Math. 10, 69 (1952) ]. In the presence of forcing and dissipation we observe a forward flux of enstrophy and a backward flux of energy. These fluxes can be understood as mean diffusive drifts from a source to two sinks in a system which is close to local equilibrium with Lagrange multipliers (shell temperatures) changing slowly with scale. This is clear evidence that the simplest <b>shell</b> <b>models</b> are not adequate to reproduce the main features of two-dimensional turbulence. The dimensional predictions on the power spectra from a supposed forward cascade of enstrophy and from one branch of the formal statistical equilibrium coincide in these <b>shell</b> <b>models</b> in contrast to the corresponding predictions for the Navier-Stokes and Euler equations in 2 D. This coincidence has previously led to the mistaken conclusion that <b>shell</b> <b>models</b> exhibit a forward cascade of enstrophy. We also study the dynamical properties of the models and the growth of perturbations. © 1994 The American Physical Society...|$|R
500|$|Upon {{his return}} to Copenhagen in 1950, Bohr began working with Ben Mottelson to compare the {{theoretical}} work with experimental data. In three papers, that were published in 1952 and 1953, Bohr and Mottelson demonstrated close agreement between theory and experiment; for example, showing that the energy levels of certain nuclei could be described by a rotation spectrum. They were thereby able to reconcile the <b>shell</b> <b>model</b> with Rainwater's concept. This work stimulated many new theoretical and experimental studies. Bohr, Mottelson and Rainwater were jointly awarded the 1975 Nobel Prize in Physics [...] "for {{the discovery of the}} connection between collective motion and particle motion in atomic nuclei and the development of the theory {{of the structure of the}} atomic nucleus based on this connection". Because his father had been awarded the prize in 1922, Bohr became one of only four pairs of fathers and sons to win the Nobel Prize in Physics. He married Marietta Soffer in 1950. They had two sons, Vilhelm and Tomas, and a daughter, Margrethe.|$|E
500|$|By {{the late}} 1940s {{it was known}} that the {{properties}} of atomic nuclei could not {{be explained by the}} then-current models such as the liquid drop model developed by Niels Bohr amongst others. [...] The <b>shell</b> <b>model,</b> developed in 1949 by Maria Goeppert-Mayer and others, allowed some additional features to be explained, in particular the so-called magic numbers. However, there were also properties that could not be explained, including the non-spherical distribution of charge in certain nuclei. In a 1950 paper, James Rainwater of Columbia University suggested a variant of the drop model of the nucleus that could explain a non-spherical charge distribution. Rainwater's model postulated a nucleus like a balloon with balls inside that distort the surface as they move about. He discussed the idea with Bohr, who was visiting Columbia at the time, and had independently conceived the same idea, and had, about a month after Rainwater's submission, submitted for publication a paper that discussed the same problem, but along more general lines. Bohr imagined a rotating, irregular-shaped nucleus with a form of surface tension. Bohr developed the idea further, in 1951 publishing a paper that comprehensively treated the relationship between oscillations of the surface of the nucleus and the movement of the individual nucleons.|$|E
500|$|From {{the late}} 1940s {{to the early}} 1960s, {{the early days of}} the {{synthesis}} of heavier and heavier transuranium elements, it was predicted that since such heavy elements did not occur naturally, they would have shorter and shorter half-lives to spontaneous fission, until they stopped existing altogether at around element 108 (now known as hassium). Initial work in the synthesis of the actinides appeared to confirm this. The nuclear <b>shell</b> <b>model,</b> introduced in the late 1960s, stated that the protons and neutrons formed shells within a nucleus, somewhat analogous to electrons forming electron shells within an atom. The noble gases are unreactive due to their having full electron shells; thus it was theorized that elements with full nuclear shells – having so-called [...] "magic" [...] numbers of protons or neutrons – would be stabilized against radioactive decay. A doubly magic isotope, having magic numbers of both protons and neutrons, would be especially stabilized, and it was calculated that the next doubly magic isotope after lead-208 would be flerovium-298 with 114 protons and 184 neutrons, which would form the centre of a so-called [...] "island of stability". This island of stability, supposedly ranging from copernicium (element 112) to oganesson (118), would come after a long [...] "sea of instability" [...] from elements 101 (mendelevium) to 111 (roentgenium), and the flerovium isotopes in it were speculated in 1966 to have half-lives in excess of a hundredmillionyears. It took thirty years for the first isotopes of flerovium to be synthesized. More recent work suggests that the local islands of stability around hassium and flerovium are due to these nuclei being respectively deformed and oblate, which make them resistant to spontaneous fission, and that the true island of stability for spherical nuclei occurs at around unbibium-306 (with 122 protons and 184 neutrons).|$|E

Energy levels from quantum states in two different shells will be separated by a relatively large energy gap, so when the number of neutrons and protons completely fills the energy levels of a given shell in the nucleus, the binding energy per nucleon will reach a local maximum and thus that particular configuration will have a longer lifetime than nearby nuclides that do not possess filled shells.|$|E
