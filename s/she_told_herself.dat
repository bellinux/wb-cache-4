60|$|She was {{watching}} him, and <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>herself</b> the shot {{had gone to}} its mark.|$|E
60|$|But as {{she wrote}} it <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>herself</b> that she {{believed}} {{it to be a}} lie.|$|E
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>herself</b> {{that she}} was the {{daughter}} of a judge, the wife of a doctor, and that she did not care to know a capering tailor. <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>herself</b> {{that she was}} not responsive to men [...] . not even to Percy Bresnahan. <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>herself</b> that a woman of thirty who heeded a boy of twenty-five was ridiculous. And on Friday, when she had convinced herself that the errand was necessary, she went to Nat Hicks's shop, bearing the not very romantic burden of a pair of her husband's trousers. Hicks was in the back room. She faced the Greek god who, in a somewhat ungodlike way, was stitching a coat on a scaley sewing-machine, in a room of smutted plaster walls.|$|E
6000|$|... "She thinks well of it, Umbelazi, for she {{has seen}} Saduko and taken a liking to him. <b>She</b> <b>told</b> me <b>herself</b> that <b>she</b> wishes no other husband." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{need not}} trouble {{to try and}} fool me, Mr. Winfield," [...] he said tartly. [...] "I know everything. I have just seen my sister, and <b>she</b> <b>told</b> me <b>herself</b> {{in so many words}} that she {{intended}} to marry you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, mother, {{she is so}} funny!--Come, Addi-lay, let her {{hear your}} fun," [...] said the girl, taking her guest's hand and leading {{her back to the}} hall. [...] "Her name is Addi-lay. I know, for <b>she</b> <b>told</b> me <b>herself.</b> We quite {{understand}} each other already.|$|R
60|$|Ruth {{knew nothing}} of these things. <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>herself</b> {{that it was her}} abruptness that had driven Bailey away.|$|E
60|$|A brave man, <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>herself</b> as {{she went}} bade from the door, and a splendid type of the race.|$|E
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>herself</b> {{that she}} had {{everything}} in the world. And after each self-rebuke she stumbled again on [...] "I just wonder----" ...|$|E
60|$|This was all--literally all--that <b>she</b> <b>told</b> me of <b>herself.</b> I {{have never}} {{discovered}} {{more of her}} sad story from that day to this.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is all that," [...] {{said the}} Franco-Pole, energetically; [...] "every franc of it, beside the house! I know it. <b>She</b> <b>told</b> me <b>herself.</b> Yes. What woman would risk that, you know; and his life, you may say, {{as good as}} gone? Of course they were lies." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It’s understandable," [...] agreed Captain Barber, [...] "but it’s orkard. Instead o’ being a mild, amiable sort o’ woman, all smiles, {{the fear}} o’ losing me has changed ’er into a determined, jealous woman. <b>She</b> <b>told</b> me <b>herself</b> {{it was love}} of me as ’ad changed her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "James is {{not really}} cynical," [...] <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>herself.</b> [...] "He says things, not because he means them, but because he likes to startle people." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He is worshipping that horrid orchid," [...] <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>herself,</b> {{and waited}} ten minutes. [...] "His watch must have stopped. I will go and call him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That thing's going on," [...] <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>herself.</b> [...] "Everything goes on, {{confound}} it! One doesn't {{change anything}} one has set going by making good resolutions." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{was happy}} and useful, was prospering {{as she had}} hoped. That was all <b>she</b> <b>told</b> me of <b>herself.</b> The rest {{referred}} to me.|$|R
60|$|There {{were not}} lacking {{those who would}} gladly have stepped into Gilbert's vacant place. But Anne snubbed them without fear and without reproach. If the real Prince Charming was never to come she {{would have none of}} a substitute. So <b>she</b> sternly <b>told</b> <b>herself</b> that gray day in the windy park.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, no, my dear Gracie! {{that is all}} a mistake. <b>She</b> <b>told</b> me <b>herself</b> <b>she's</b> only twenty. You see, {{the trouble}} is, she went into company injudiciously early, a mere baby, in fact; and that causes her to have the name of being older than she is. But, I do assure you, she's only twenty. <b>She</b> <b>told</b> me so herself." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{never had}} another lover. <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>herself</b> {{that she would}} always be {{faithful}} to the one love of her life. This sounded romantic, and she found a certain comfort in it.|$|E
60|$|If {{all else}} failed her, <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>herself,</b> {{there would be}} no Touraine hovel for her. She could always be Comtesse de Tressan. Let Marius work out alone the {{punishment}} of his cowardice.|$|E
60|$|She {{wanted to}} {{massacre}} him, {{but at the}} same time <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>herself</b> that the poor dear must be feeling very, very ill, and should have a reasonable respite before the slaughter commenced.|$|E
6000|$|Miss Garnett, in despair: [...] "Then {{what have}} I done? Oh, what a fatal, fatal scrape!" [...] With {{a ray of}} {{returning}} hope: [...] "But <b>she</b> <b>told</b> me <b>herself</b> that <b>she</b> was engaged! And you were together so much, last summer!" [...] Desperately: [...] "Then if she isn't engaged to you, whom is she engaged to?" ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{battle has}} been so unfair. All the dice are loaded against me. He has every {{advantage}} over me. But at last I thought I'd won. I thought Violet was getting more resigned. <b>She</b> <b>told</b> me <b>herself</b> just now that the worst was over. And those confounded people must go and upset the applecart. Damn their eyes! ...|$|R
60|$|And {{then this}} girl that was with her! <b>She</b> had <b>told</b> <b>herself</b> {{that it would}} not be well to live for herself alone, that it was her duty to share her good things with some one, and {{therefore}} she had resolved to share them with her niece. But in this guardianship there was danger, which frightened her as she thought of it.|$|R
60|$|He {{started off}} bareheaded. Estella {{followed}} {{him up the}} road breathlessly. Surely it was the strangest walk ever a girl had, <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>herself</b> with mirthless laughter. She pushed the key into his hand at the porch.|$|E
6000|$|... "This job may {{not last}} long," [...] <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>herself,</b> [...] "but while {{it does it}} will be mighty amusing. I shall enjoy these weeks in a quiet country town after the bustle of the big city." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{went down}} the hill to where his ball lay. Eunice {{proceeded}} direct for the green. Much as <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>herself</b> that she hated this man, she never questioned his ability to get there with his next shot.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, she has {{shook hands}} with a good many red-coats in her day, has the `Soldier's Friend,'" [...] {{returned}} the manager. [...] "Why, I remember on one occasion when she was giving a lecture to soldiers, and so many men came forward {{to shake hands with}} her that, as <b>she</b> <b>told</b> me <b>herself,</b> her hand was stiff and swelled all night after it!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So {{good that}} I was afraid {{at first it}} would be useless {{thinking}} of her. But she's a sensible girl, no confounded nonsense about her, and the family are poor as church mice. In fact--well, to tell the truth, we have become most excellent friends, and <b>she</b> <b>told</b> me <b>herself</b> frankly that she meant to marry a rich man, and didn't much care whom." ...|$|R
60|$|Am I {{the first}} with the great and good news for America and England that Harriet Martineau is better and likely to be better? <b>She</b> <b>told</b> me so <b>herself,</b> and {{attributes}} the change to the agency of mesmerism.|$|R
60|$|And {{she loved}} him, she loved him--so. <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>herself</b> in the {{presence}} of all these facts, and without a shadow of doubt in her mind that all she wanted in the world was to make him happy.|$|E
60|$|How Gillian {{might have}} enjoyed all this, {{and yet she}} could not, except so far that <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>herself</b> that thus {{there could be no}} {{reasonable}} objection made by her aunts to intercourse with those whom they so much admired.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then you'd better {{find some}} lady {{who would like}} to have two parishes. They haven't any weight with me at all." [...] At that moment <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>herself</b> how much she would prefer even Boulogne, to Mr. Spooner's two parishes.|$|E
60|$|At {{last they}} separated, and as <b>she</b> undressed Valentia <b>told</b> <b>herself</b> that Ferdinand {{had kept his}} promise. Everything was {{just as it had}} been before, and the only change was that he used her Christian name. And she rather liked him to call her Valentia.|$|R
60|$|So he <b>told</b> her, and <b>she</b> <b>told</b> him of <b>herself,</b> {{and they}} talked and talked till the shadows of {{advancing}} night began to close around them. Suddenly Godfrey looked at his watch, of which he could only just see the hands.|$|R
6000|$|... "My lord," [...] {{said the}} girl, [...] "there is Mrs. Amy, {{who was my}} mother's servant at the time (as <b>she</b> <b>told</b> me <b>herself</b> about three months ago), knows very well I am the person I pretend to be, and caused me to be thrown into jail for debts I knew nothing of, because I should not find out my mother to make myself known to her before she left England." ...|$|R
