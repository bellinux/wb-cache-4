50|$|Vilmorin {{was founded}} as a plant and seed {{boutique}} in 1743 by <b>seed</b> <b>expert</b> Claude Geoffroy {{and her husband}} Pierre Andrieux, the chief seed supplier and botanist to King Louis XV. The store was located on the quai de la Mégisserie, a street in the 1st arrondissement of Paris. In 1774, their daughter married botany enthusiast Philippe-Victoire Levêque de Vilmorin (1746-1804). Together, they revived the stores and created the Vilmorin-Andrieux House, which later became Vilmorin-Andrieux and Company {{under the leadership of}} their son, Philippe André de Vilmorin (1776-1862). Philippe-Victoire de Vilmorin began importing trees and exotic plants into Europe in 1766, starting with the American tulip tree, the domesticated beet, and the rutabaga. Such plants were unknown in Europe prior to Vilmorin-Andrieux's commercial promotion of them for food, fodder and ornamentation.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—With the {{exponential}} growth of smartphone apps, it is prohibitive for apps market places, such as Google App Store for example, to thoroughly verify if an app is legitimate or mali-cious. As a result, mobile users {{are left to}} decide for themselves whether an app is safe to use. Even worse, {{recent studies have shown}} that most apps in markets request to collect data irrelevant to the main functions of the apps, which could cause leaking of private information or inefficient use of mobile resources. To assist users to make a right decision as for whether a permission request should be accepted, we propose RecDroid. RecDroid is a crowdsourcing recommendation framework that collects apps’ permission requests and users ’ permission responses, from which a ranking algorithm is used to evaluate the expertise level of users and a voting algorithm is used to compute an appropriate response to the permission request (accept or reject). To bootstrap the recommendation system, RecDroid relies on a small set of <b>seed</b> <b>expert</b> users that could make reliable recommendations for a small set of application. Our evaluation results show that RecDroid can provide high accuracy and satisfying coverage with careful selection of parameters. The results also show that a small coverage from seed experts is sufficient for RecDroid to cover the majority of the app requests. I...|$|E

40|$|Smallholders play a {{key role}} in {{sustaining}} seed supply systems, alongside the formal seed sector. This is one of the observations made during a 12 -day study visit of <b>seed</b> <b>experts</b> and smallholder <b>seed</b> growers to Zimbabwe in February 1999. Organised by CTA, in collaboration with the Zimbabwean Ministry of Lands and Agriculture, the visit gave the 18 visitors from Ethiopia, Malawi, Mozambique, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and other parts of Zimbabwe a chance to acquaint themselves with the many aspects of seed supply in the host country. In Zimbabwe, the formal sector ensures seed security for commercial crops of maize, soybean, and wheat; it even exports seeds to regional markets. However, many communal farmers cultivate small marginal plots unsuited to these crops. They often grow subsistence crops such as millet, sorghum, cowpea, and open-pollinated varieties of maize. For them, the tried and tested source is the informal sector, which supplies seeds for 90 % of the crops in Zimbabwe and sometimes close to 100 % of the crops in the countries of the visiting group. A more encouraging attitude towards the informal sector on the part of policy and financial bodies would allow better organisation and bring more resources. The group felt that with this support, the community and smallholder groups could {{play a key}} role in seed multiplication, storage and distribution: a message that will be sown far and wide after the study visit.

An <b>expert</b> on <b>seed</b> ageing and plant DNA repair, Osborne researched the effects of DNA degradation, repair and telomere length on the viability of seeds. In the 1970s, she was among the earliest to attempt to isolate nucleic acids from ancient seeds, finding that only very short fragments could be isolated from grains from Egyptian tombs. Among her final research projects was {{a study of the}} effects on DNA repair in seeds and pollen of exposure to radioactive fallout after the Chernobyl nuclear reactor explosion.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} seed vigour as {{the most}} important seed characteristic the seed lot quality depends on. In Serbian, the terms such as vigor, viability and germ inability are used in various ways, depending on the author, which leaves room to possible misunderstanding in interpretation of research results and misuse of expert terminology. The modest lexical fund, compared to that of the English language, for instance, greatly contributes to the problem, and so does the absence of terminological standardization. Since the current technology and research level in seed science and technology requires appropriate terminology, this article offers an outline of basic <b>seed</b> traits related <b>expert</b> terminology as a foundation of future seed research and technology development. ...|$|R

40|$|Crops thrive {{best when}} given {{a good start}} in life. For those crops which are {{normally}} propagated by seed, every effort {{must be made to}} keep pathogens at bay, at least until the crop is well-established. Obvious though this is, farmers throughout the world have, in the past, tended to underestimate the value of using pathogen-free seeds. Severe, even total, crop losses often arise from the presence of pathogens in the seed. Increasingly, farmers are demanding higher quality seed; and high quality seed must always be disease-free. To establish standards, most countries have introduced comprehensive seed certification schemes. To maintain these standards, seed testing stations have been established. These stations are responsible for issuing certificates which give buyers and sellers an accurate indication of quality. Nowadays, the seed trade is very much an international business, and there is a consequent need for some standardization of seed testing methodologies. Seed testing stations must be capable of identifying a wide range of pests, including insects, viruses, bacteria, fungi and nematodes. They also {{need to be able to}} detect mycotoxins (poisonous substances produced by fungi) which can affect seed viability, germination and vigour. National crop improvement programmes, most of which are assisted by the International Agricultural Research Centres, rely heavily of the storage and exchange of plant germplasm, usually in the form of seeds. The risks of transferring seed-borne pathogens in such exchanges are high. The international seed trade increases the problem still further, hence the need for adequate seed certification and quarantine procedures at both national and international levels In order to advance the development of such procedures, CTA, in collaboration with the Danish Government's Institute of Seed Pathology for Developing Countries, held a seminar on the topic in June 1988 in Denmark. <b>Seed</b> <b>experts</b> familiar with the latest methodologies for detection and control of seed-borne pathogens, met to discuss recent progress with seed pathologists from 20 ACP countries. The meeting concluded that the need to increase awareness of the importance of using diseasefree seed was as great as ever; too many farmers continue to underestimate the dangers of not doing so. Seed pathologists in ACP countries would benefit from improved training opportunities so as to increase the standard of seed testing generally. The ACP participants felt that a newsletter for the exchange of relevant information would assist them to achieve the higher quality standards that must be pursued.

For those crops which are normally propagated by seed, every effort must be made to keep pathogens at bay, at least until the crop is well-established.

40|$|The study {{evaluates the}} {{potential}} {{impacts of the}} Drought Tolerant Maize for Africa (DTMA) project run by CIMMYT and the International Institute for Tropical Agriculture (IITA) in 13 countries of eastern, southern and West Africa: Angola, Benin, Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Mali, Mozambique, Nigeria, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe and Ghana. It describes cumulative economic and poverty-reduction benefits to farmers and consumers in those countries over 2007 - 16, from higher yields and from diminished season-to-season yield fluctuations, through the adoption by farmers of improved, drought tolerant maize varieties. At the most likely rates of adoption, based on several recent studies and expert advice, drought tolerant maize can generate US$ 0. 53 billion from increased maize grain harvests and reduced risk over the study period, assuming conservative yield improvements—that is, a yield advantage over normal, improved maize of 3 - 20 %, depending on the site and seasonal conditions. Assuming more optimistic yield gains—a range of 10 - 34 % over non-drought tolerant improved maize—the economic benefit is nearly US$ 0. 88 billion in project countries. Optimistic yields plus full replacement of current improved varieties with drought tolerant ones could help more than 4 million people to escape poverty and many millions more to improve their livelihoods. The most striking economic and poverty benefits will accrue in Nigeria, Kenya, and Malawi, based on the amounts of maize sown in those countries, the importance of maize in inhabitants’ diets and livelihoods, and their historical levels of adoption of improved maize. In comparison, the benefits will be more modest in Angola and Mozambique and moderate in Uganda and Mali. However, even if most DTMA project resources were allocated to the countries where the benefits are highest, the other countries would still benefit from the research spillovers that could be facilitated by crossborder seed market exchanges. Crucial components in this multi-disciplinary study included geographic information system data, data on the probability of failed crop seasons (PFS), yield data from breeders, projected maize adoption rates mainly from <b>seed</b> <b>experts,</b> and poverty data from socioeconomists. The drought tolerant varieties considered {{are the product of}} conventional breeding—that is, they are not transgenic. Follow-up research will address potential benefits from such factors as area expansion effects, increased cropping diversity (households can meet their maize requirements from a smaller portion of their land, freeing up space to sow other crops), and increased investment in fertilizer and other improvements, owing to reduced risk. Moreover, if as expected farmers who adopt drought tolerant maize continue to grow it beyond 2016, the returns on investments to this work will become even more significant.

40|$|This work {{examines}} whether bibliometric domain mapping techniques {{support or}} {{call into question}} a descriptive spatial chart created by a domain expert. The chart was created by Prof. Jonathan Plucker, {{an expert in the}} field of human intelligence theory and testing (Plucker, 1997), and shows the scholarly lineage and interconnections of researchers in that particular field. The chart shows two kinds of relationships: (1) whether someone was a student of, or an assistant to, an earlier theorist; and (2) whether someone was influenced by an earlier theorist. Both are based on the expert knowledge of Prof. Plucker. However, they are not based on a methodical bibliographic analysis of the domain. Therefore, it is hoped that bibliometric domain mapping analysis of the field will either validate the chart or to reveal previously underappreciated connections in the field, and possibly both. This work utilizes a novel, <b>expert</b> <b>seeding</b> approach to constrain, in a principled manner, the universe of relevant articles from which to conduct a co-citation mapping of the domain of intelligence theory and testing. Co-citation is a metric in which two authors are co-cited together in the work of a third author. Aggregate counts and the spatialization of co-citation data from a sufficiently large corpus distribute the co-cited authors by the similarity of their research...|$|R
