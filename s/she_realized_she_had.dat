500|$|... "Galentine's Day" [...] {{received}} generally positive reviews. Entertainment Weekly writer Sandra Gonzalez said, [...] "The show {{managed to}} cram more character development into 22 minutes than I thought possible. Almost every couple {{had a major}} milestone of sorts last night." [...] Gonzalez complimented the acting of Aziz Ansari during his moments with Wendy, and praised the [...] "touching moment" [...] between Ron and Leslie when <b>she</b> <b>realized</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> to break up with Justin. Steve Kandell of New York magazine appreciated that Leslie was correct about Frank, and that Justin was the ignorant one. Kandell said the senior dance served as a [...] "poignant backdrop" [...] for the episode's romantic subplots, but said the most intriguing show's relationship is between Leslie and Ron. Alan Sepinwall, television columnist with The Star-Ledger, said the episode was funny, but focused more attention on advancing various romantic subplots. Sepinwall said the scenes about Ann and Mark were [...] "a nice reaction to the general blandness of that relationship", but found it [...] "frustrating" [...] that the episode left the reason for Wendy and Tom's resolution unclear in [...] "Galentine's Day".|$|E
2500|$|Brian Foote, Danilova's friend, {{has been}} bought in when <b>she</b> <b>realized</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> {{too much of}} ideas to sort them out. [...] "Some of them weren't really a good fit, as I found out during the process, {{and by the end}} I kind of {{realised}} that I needed someone to help me along the way. So, it made sense to ask Brian as he's a great friend of mine that also lives in Los Angeles and he has a great studio with lots of resources. He helped oversee the production of the record and made sure that everything was done on time and nothing was missed out during recording and it worked out just perfect", she said. It was easy for her to work with Foote who, understanding that she was a [...] "control freak", tried to [...] "step away a lot". Yet, {{he had a lot of}} [...] "great suggestions about how to change little things to make them more effective", according to Danilova, and also let her use his [...] "amazing synth collection" [...] which helped the songs grow.|$|E

2500|$|Jane Kowalski's {{call was}} placed by {{cellphone}} at 6:30p.m. {{while she was}} driving on U.S. Route 41. [...] "I was at a stoplight and a man pulled up {{next to me and}} there was a child screaming in the car", she said. [...] She explained further that she heard [...] "terrifying screaming" [...] and that she had [...] "never heard anything like that". [...] Kowalski believed that she was witnessing a child abduction. [...] She also identified the car as a Camaro but stated the color as blue (rather than green). [...] She stated that she had made eye contact with the driver after which [...] "a hand came up and started banging on the passenger window". [...] Since she had crossed the county line into Charlotte, the call was routed to Charlotte County's 9-1-1 call center. [...] It was only after she saw the news the following day that <b>she</b> <b>realized</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> witnessed the abduction of Lee rather than that of a child. [...] When she called the North Port Police Department to explain who she was and that she had made a 9-1-1 call, it became apparent that the call had not been forwarded to the correct authorities. [...] It is this call that is alleged to have been mishandled {{due to the fact that}} the operatives neglected to file it correctly. [...] This call was also presented by the state prosecutors as part of the key evidence at King's trial.|$|E

But as she walked into the Pullman she overheard a passenger remark, [...] "Regular old Arizona sunset," [...] and that shook her heart. Suddenly <b>she</b> <b>realized</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> come to love the colorful sunsets, to watch and wait for them. And bitterly she thought how that was her way to learn the value of something when it was gone.|$|E
