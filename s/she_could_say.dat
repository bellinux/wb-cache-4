2500|$|Edmonds: Yes. Once the truant officer {{came and}} {{asked my mother}} why we weren't in school, and <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>say,</b> [...] "Well, we sent ‘em and they sent ‘em home." [...] So that kind of took, you know, the edge off of them. Our parents didn't keep us home.|$|E
2500|$|Ewa Podleś {{likewise}} {{stated that}} [...] "It's {{enough to hear}} her, I'm positive! Because <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> everything only with her voice! I can imagine everything, I can see everything {{in front of my}} eye." [...] Opera director Sandro Sequi, who witnessed many Callas performances close-up, states, [...] "For me, she was extremely stylized and classic, yet at the same time, human—but humanity on a higher plane of existence, almost sublime. Realism was foreign to her, and that is why she was the greatest of opera singers. After all, opera is the least realistic of theater forms... She was wasted in verismo roles, even Tosca, no matter how brilliantly she could act such roles." [...] Scott adds, [...] "Early nineteenth-century opera... is not merely the antithesis of reality, it also requires highly stylized acting. Callas had the perfect face for it. Her big features matched its grandiloquence and spoke volumes from a distance." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ashanti {{was first}} noticed by Irv Gotti {{because of her}} vocal skills. Ashanti {{initially}} asked him to produce a few demo songs for her to record so <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> she had some strong tracks by the big time producer but Gotti had a different idea. He asked her to pen hooks for his rap artists and to perform with them in duets. Ashanti provided the melodic response to their call. Ashanti was first featured as a background vocalist on rapper Big Pun's song [...] "How We Roll". In the same year, Ashanti was featured on fellow labelmate Cadillac Tah's singles [...] "Pov City Anthem" [...] and [...] "Just Like a Thug". She also appeared on the 2001 The Fast and the Furious soundtrack as a featured artist on Vita's 2001 hip hop remake of Madonna's [...] "Justify My Love" [...] and on the solo track [...] "When a Man Does Wrong". She was featured on Fat Joe's [...] "What's Luv?" [...] and Ja Rule's [...] "Always on Time". [...] "What's Luv?" [...] and [...] "Always on Time" [...] were released simultaneously and became {{two of the biggest}} hit songs of 2002. Ashanti became the first female to occupy the top two positions on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart simultaneously when [...] "Always on Time" [...] and [...] "What's Luv?" [...] were at numbers one and two, respectively.|$|E
60|$|Violet {{thought he}} had exposed himself quite enough; and as dessert was on the table, she rose with as good a smile as <b>she</b> <b>could,</b> <b>saying,</b> 'Very well, I'll explain; you will find {{your way to the}} drawing-room,' and retreated.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>could</b> not <b>say</b> that <b>she</b> understood, {{but she did}} understand.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Rintoul {{afterwards}} {{told her}} husband <b>she</b> <b>could</b> hardly <b>say</b> that <b>she</b> liked Miss Hannay.|$|R
60|$|But she hazily {{wanted some}} one to whom <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> what she thought.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> no more, but {{covered her}} face {{with both hands and}} wept.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Moss's {{tears came}} again at this {{unexpected}} kindness, and <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> nothing.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>could</b> only <b>say</b> that <b>she</b> {{wanted to}} know, and Richard was {{sufficiently}} amused to answer.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> choked; <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>say</b> {{the word}} that is so terrible to the young and happy.|$|R
60|$|Clementina's heart gave a leap in her breast, and <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>say</b> anything. He went on.|$|R
60|$|The mysterious man-servant {{opened the}} door, and we parted before <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> the next words.|$|E
60|$|Nothing <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> would arouse him to action, and {{she finally}} {{allowed him to}} do as he pleased.|$|E
60|$|Flora did not reply. She {{felt that}} in his present state of mind nothing <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> would comfort him.|$|E
6000|$|... "We said nothing," [...] cried Louise, and she blessed heaven that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> truly <b>say</b> so, [...] "which could {{possibly}} be distorted into that." ...|$|R
60|$|With such a {{conviction}} as this strong upon her, {{she felt that}} <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>say</b> much to Bell that would be of any service.|$|R
6000|$|... "I missed nothing," [...] exclaimed Cecil; but {{she felt}} that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> only <b>say</b> so in the past, and her eyes burnt with unshed tears.|$|R
60|$|Eustacia made no reply, but {{she looked}} as if <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> as much upon that subject as he if she chose.|$|E
60|$|Which {{disturbed}} Annie inwardly, although <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> nothing. He {{seemed to}} hate the doll so intensely, because he had broken it.|$|E
6000|$|Before <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> {{anything}} more, {{they were}} {{interrupted by the}} entrance of Dr Lawrence. With a surprised look and smile he said-- ...|$|E
6000|$|In {{this view}} {{it did seem}} improbable, and Mrs. Lapham was shaken. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> only <b>say,</b> [...] "Penelope felt just the way I did about it." ...|$|R
6000|$|The tears glittered in the girl's eyes, and her lip trembled; but, {{with all}} her {{readiness}} of speech, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> only <b>say,</b> [...] "Oh, your Excellency." ...|$|R
6000|$|Then {{she remembered}} it all;--how {{she had been}} driven into a half {{confession}} to her father. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> not <b>say</b> there was nobody. <b>She</b> certainly <b>could</b> not <b>say</b> who that some one was. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> not be silent, for by silence she would be confessing a passion for some other man,--a passion which certainly had no existence. [...] "I don't know why papa should talk about me," [...] she said, [...] "and I certainly don't know why you should repeat what he said." ...|$|R
60|$|Violet, {{still very}} weak, {{could have been}} hysterical, but luckily was able to command herself, though, 'thank you!' was all <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>say.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "It is a {{very sweet}} face," [...] said Grace, exerting herself to be sympathetic, and thankful that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> that much truthfully.|$|E
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> no {{more for}} some minutes, but her cousin did not speak. Recovering her voice, she added, 'Only speak to me, Robert.' ...|$|E
60|$|The girl's heart smote her. She {{knew just}} what {{he wanted her to}} <b>say,</b> but <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>say</b> it, and yet she meant to do all she had undertaken.|$|R
6000|$|And [...] "Mary {{take you}} now," [...] she sang, [...] "That lay against my heart." [...] And [...] "Mary smooth your crib to-night," [...] But <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>say</b> [...] "Depart." ...|$|R
60|$|Lenore {{waited with}} some perturbation. She had a guilty {{conscience}} and she feared {{he meant to}} quiz her about her sudden change of front regarding the Bend trip. So <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not look up and <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>say</b> a word.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> nothing save {{a hoarse}} 'Where?' as with both arms she pressed {{him as if}} she could never let him go again.|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{are some}} things that cannot be--cannot be told to--" [...] And then her heart rose into her throat, and <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> no more.|$|E
6000|$|... "You needn't, {{for there}} you are, my lady." [...] And, unceremoniously picking her up, Mac landed {{her in the}} {{carriage}} before <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> a word.|$|E
60|$|She {{had meant}} to tell Mr. Dutton {{that it was all}} her father's selfishness, but somehow <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>say</b> so, there was {{something}} about him that hindered all unbefitting outbreaks of vexation.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, ay! I {{know you}} don't like him. But {{he knows his}} manners to you, I hope?' said Mr. Egremont, with a suddenness that made her wish <b>she</b> <b>could</b> truthfully <b>say</b> he did not.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Tibbs {{looked at}} the relict of the {{departed}} Bloss, and thought {{he must have had}} very little peace in his time. Of course <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>say</b> so; so she looked very sympathising.|$|R
