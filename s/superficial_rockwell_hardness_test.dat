40|$|Abstract The <b>Rockwell</b> <b>hardness</b> <b>test</b> is {{commonly}} used and accepted by many industrial users, but the hardness value requires conversion between scales because the geometry of the indenters and the load ranges are different. On the other hand, hardness calculation using pyramidal indenters is quite simple and {{can be applied to}} any load range, though it is much more complicated to calibrate the frame compliance and the truncation of indenters in nanoindentation measurement. For this reason, nanoindentation measurement is not yet fully industrially friendly. In order to improve the above situation, newly developed industrial <b>hardness</b> <b>test</b> methods and a new concept of Equivalent indentation depth (or indentation depth index) were proposed and investigated in this paper. These methods are based on the principle of similarity of Vickers and other pyramidal indenters, and take advantage of the industrial and practical usability of the <b>Rockwell</b> <b>hardness</b> <b>test.</b> Experimental results that covered macroscopic through nanoscopic ranges show that the methods can be applied {{to a wide range of}} test loads. One of the expected advantages of the methods of performing nanoindentation and other instrumented indentation tests (ISO 14577) is that the hardness is not significantly influenced by the frame compliance or the truncation of indenters. Other advantages over conventional <b>hardness</b> <b>tests</b> are also discussed in this paper. More experimental work is necessary to confirm and establish the new methods.

The main objective of this project is to investigate the hardness and impact properties of medium carbon steel treated at different heat treatment processes. Three types of heat treatment were performed in this project which are annealing, quenching and tempering. During annealing process, the specimens were heated at 900 oC and soaked for 1 hour in the furnace. The specimens were then quenched in a medium of water and open air, respectively. The treatment was followed by tempering processes which were done at 300 oC, 450 oC, and 600 oC with a soaking time of 2 hours for each temperature. After the heat treatment process completed, <b>Rockwell</b> <b>hardness</b> <b>test</b> and Charpy impact test were performed.

40|$|SummaryThe {{application}} of natural fibres such as bamboo, jute, banana, coir, linen {{and the like}} in Fibre Reinforced Polymeric (FRP) composites have become so vital due to their high effective stiffness and strength, availability, low cost, specific strength, better dimensional stability and mechanical properties, eco-friendly and biodegradable as compared with synthetic fibres. The interest in natural fibre reinforced polymeric composites is rapidly springing up in terms of research and industrial applications. The increased applications of these natural fibres in such composites are a proof to this claim. The paper deals with the detailed study of bamboo fibre, banana fibre and linen fibre cut into 2 − 4 mm of length with epoxy resin having random orientations. Various tests like Impact test (IZOD and CHARPY test), Fourier Transform Infra-Red (FTIR) <b>test</b> and <b>Rockwell</b> <b>Hardness</b> <b>test</b> were conducted on 10 specimens of bamboo epoxy resin composite, bamboo−banana epoxy resin composite and bamboo−linen epoxy resin composite.

Plasma spray torch parameters were varied to produce a set of abradable coatings exhibiting {{a broad range of}} porosity levels (34 - 62 %) and <b>superficial</b> <b>Rockwell</b> <b>hardness</b> values (0 - 78 HR 15 Y). Abradability tests have been performed using an abradable-seal test rig capable of simulating operational wear at different rotor speeds and seal incursion rates. These tests allowed determining the rubbing forces and quantifying the blade and seal wear characteristics for slow and fast seal incursion rates. Erosion wear performance and ASTM C 633 coating adhesion strength test results are also reported. For optimal abradability performance, it is shown that coating hardness needs to be lower than 70 and 50 HR 15 Y for slow and fast blade incursion rate conditions, respectively.

40|$|Abstract The direct {{verification}} of Rockwell testing machines comprises four parts such as test force, indenter, depth measuring device, and testing cycle {{as seen in}} ISO 6508 - 2.
