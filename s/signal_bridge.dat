25|$|In January 1941 he was {{assigned}} as aide and flag lieutenant to Commander Battleships, Battle Force. He was present on the <b>signal</b> <b>bridge</b> of the battleship Maryland during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, and later participated in the Battles of the Coral Sea and Midway. In September 1942 he became aide and flag secretary to Commander Battleship Division Four, whose vessels supported the actions off Guadalcanal and the Santa Cruz Islands.|$|E
25|$|Curtis {{enlisted in}} the United States Navy after the attack on Pearl Harbor and war was declared. Inspired by Cary Grant's role in Destination Tokyo and Tyrone Power's in Crash Dive (1943), he joined the Pacific {{submarine}} force. Curtis served aboard a submarine tender, the USS Proteus, {{until the end of}} the Second World War. On September 2, 1945, Curtis witnessed the Japanese surrender in Tokyo Bay from his ship's <b>signal</b> <b>bridge</b> about a mile away.|$|E
25|$|Biloxi put to sea on 13 January and, {{after joining}} Task Group (TG) 53.5 in Hawaii, sailed for the Marshall Islands. In company with Louisville, Mobile, , and six destroyers, the light cruiser {{approached}} Wotje {{early in the}} morning on 30 January. After launching her Kingfisher spotter aircraft, she carried out a neutralizing bombardment of the Japanese air base on Wotje from dawn until noon. Enemy shore batteries fired back intermittently, one of which straddled Biloxi. A later ricochet hit the superstructure above the <b>signal</b> <b>bridge</b> but fortunately did not explode.|$|E

5000|$|Signals {{are most}} {{commonly}} mounted on trackside masts about 12 ft to 15 ft high {{to put them}} in the eyeline of the engineer. Signals can also be mounted on <b>signal</b> <b>bridges</b> or cantilever masts spanning multiple tracks. <b>Signal</b> <b>bridges</b> and masts typically provide at least 20 ft of clearance {{over the top of the}} rail. Bracket masts are arranged with multiple signals are mounted on the same masts governing two adjacent tracks. Bracket masts tend to be the tallest type of signal to allow the train crew to see the signal over a train on the intervening track. Signals in electrified territory may be mounted on the catenary structure, and signals on bi-directional lines may be mounted back-to-back on the same mounting device.|$|R
50|$|In the 1850s, New York Central Railroad {{took over}} the line {{in an effort to}} build new direct routes. The {{railroad}} built <b>signal</b> <b>bridges</b> along the line to increase safety and capacity. Currently, all New York Central Railroad signals along the subdivision have been replaced by CSX Transportation with the newer Safetran signals.|$|R
25|$|In 1999, {{a reunion}} {{was held on}} the ship. While {{standing}} on the <b>signal</b> <b>bridge,</b> {{the site of a}} friendly fire strike during the Okinawa assault of 6 April, former PFC Marine Gunner Richard R. Fox described how he helped carry a severely injured sailor down to sickbay. Fox had never known whether the man had survived. During his story he was interrupted by fellow North Carolina veteran Richard W. Reed, who identified himself as the injured sailor and offered his thanks. Neither man had known the other's identity for over a half-century.|$|E
2500|$|Grasp {{has three}} {{manually}} operated fire monitors, {{one on the}} forward <b>signal</b> <b>bridge,</b> one on [...] the aft <b>signal</b> <b>bridge,</b> {{and one on the}} forecastle, that can deliver up to [...] per minute of seawater or [...] aqueous film forming foam (AFFF) When originally built, Grasp had a fourth remotely controlled fire monitor mounted on her forward kingpost, but this was later removed. Grasp has a [...] foam tank.|$|E
2500|$|West Virginia {{was also}} damaged by two Type 99 No. 80 Mk 5 bombs made from [...] armor-piercing naval shells fitted with aerial fins. The first was found, unexploded, in debris {{on the second}} deck after passing through the {{searchlight}} platform, <b>signal</b> <b>bridge</b> and main deck deck near frame 70. The second bomb penetrated the [...] roof of turret three and broke apart destroying one of the turret's two guns, but did not detonate. It destroyed the Vought OS2U Kingfisher floatplane on the turret catapult. The impact knocked a second floatplane upside down to the main deck below, spilling gasoline (which ignited) from its fuel tanks. Burning aircraft fuel injured turret personnel and damaged the remaining gun. West Virginia was eventually engulfed by an oil-fed conflagration, begun by the burning [...] and sustained for 30 hours by fuel leaking from both ships.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the basic}} rail system {{was in place}} by 1860, the {{railways}} continued to make major improvements in tracks, <b>signals,</b> <b>bridging,</b> and facilities. With steel came heavier trains and more powerful locomotives. In the 1880s the Boston & Albany Railroad invested heavily in its physical facilities, including the construction of over 30 new passenger stations. Famed Boston architect H. H. Richardson did much of the design work.|$|R
50|$|The {{distance}} between the track centres makes a difference in cost and performance of a double-track line. The track centres can be as narrow and as cheap as possible, but maintenance must {{be done on the}} side. Signals for bi-directional working cannot be mounted between the tracks so must be mounted on the 'wrong' side of the line or on expensive <b>signal</b> <b>bridges.</b> Track centres are usually wider on high-speed lines, as pressure waves knock each other as high-speed trains pass.|$|R

2500|$|The {{task group}} came under air attack {{almost as soon}} as {{operations}} began. At about 08:00, a twin-engine bomber, probably a Yokosuka P1Y [...] "Frances", attacked from her port side. The ship opened fire almost immediately and began scoring hits quickly. The plane began to burn but continued his run passing over Yorktowns bow and splashing in the water on her starboard side. Just seven minutes later, another Frances tried but also went down, a victim of the combined fire of the formation. No further attacks developed until that afternoon; and, in the meantime, Yorktown continued air operations. That afternoon, three Yokosuka D4Y [...] "Judy" [...] dive-bombers launched attacks on the carrier. The first two failed in their attacks and were shot in their attempts. The third succeeded in planting his bomb on the <b>signal</b> <b>bridge.</b> It passed through the first deck and exploded near the ship's hull. It punched two large holes through her side, killed five men, and wounded another 26. Yorktown, however, remained fully operational, and her anti-aircraft gunners brought the attacker down. She continued air operations against the three southernmost islands of Japan and retired for fueling operations on 20 March.|$|E

50|$|CTX also {{included}} crossover switches, which improved operating flexibility to allow trains to bypass stalled trains, and a {{centralized traffic control}} (CTC) system, which allowed track signaling and switching operations to be handled from a single facility in San Jose, {{rather than relying on}} dispatched crews throwing manual switches. Prior to CTX, trains typically had to stop and de-board operators and conductors, who would throw switches by hand. Although CTC was already partially implemented near the two main terminals at San Francisco and San Jose, CTX added CTC throughout the route, and 12 <b>signal</b> <b>bridges</b> were added to the line in total.|$|R
50|$|Around 1898, {{he invented}} a crystal diode {{rectifier}} or cat's whisker diode. Pioneers working on wireless devices eventually {{came to a}} limit of distance they could cover. Connecting the antenna directly to the spark gap produced only a heavily damped pulse train. There {{were only a few}} cycles before oscillations ceased. Braun's circuit afforded a much longer sustained oscillation because the energy encountered less losses swinging between coil and Leyden Jars. And by means of inductive antenna coupling the radiator was better matched to the generator. The resultant stronger and less bandwidth consuming <b>signals</b> <b>bridged</b> a much longer distance.|$|R

50|$|Prior to 1985, signals were {{required}} by regulation to be mounted above {{and to the}} right of the track they governed. This mounting was designed to allow the engineer to view the signal when driving a steam or diesel locomotive with a long nose that restricted the view to the left. In most situations, especially where bi-directional running was implemented, signals needed to be mounted above the track or on bracket masts to allow this right hand placement. As locomotive design changed to allow good visibility on both sides of the track, regulations were changed allowing railroads to shift to bi-directional mast type <b>signals,</b> using <b>signal</b> <b>bridges</b> only in special situations involving multiple tracks or restricted views.|$|R
