40|$|Spate {{irrigation}} is {{a method}} of harvesting and managing floodwater, which is unpredictable in timing and volume. In the spate-irrigated area of 16 000 ha in Eritrea, the farmers have for decades used brushwood and earthen diversion and distribution structures, locally known as Agims and Musghas, to harness and share the floodwater. Although these practices managed to make the systems sustainable for the past 100 years, they failed to fully mitigate the unpredictability of the floodwater and relieve the farmers from poverty. With the aim of improving living conditions, the government decided to modernize the spate irrigation systems. In 1998, the Wadi Laba (2600 ha) was selected as a pilot project, and its major Agims and Musghas were replaced by a concrete headwork and gabions. The main targets were: expanding the annually irrigated area from 1200 to 2600 ha, diverting large floods in a regulated manner so as to increase the probability of irrigating the downstream fields, while preventing erosion and sedimentation and reducing the labour and brushwood needed for operation and maintenance. Field surveys, discharge measurements, interviews and group discussions were conducted to evaluate {{the performance of the}} Wadi Laba system. It was found that in an excellent flood season, only 1400 ha was irrigated. Reasons include: the inappropriate design assumptions and approaches in the initial phase of the modernization, the non-coherence of the modern design with the indigenous water rules and water-sharing arrangements, the failures of the breaching bund, the sedimentation in the culvert and the incorrect operation and use of the <b>scour</b> <b>sluice.</b> Among the proposed improvements are: strengthening the farmers' organization technically, institutionally and legally, replacing the culvert with a head regulator gate, constructing supplementary offtakes, converting the breaching bund into a low-crested rock fill spillway. Besides discussing these issues, this paper provides quantitative justification why the floodwater would have to be supplemented with groundwater, {{if there is to be}} a real possibility of achieving the set target...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: According to {{the current}} {{situation}} of water control project, the existing problems and the audit opinions of superior administrative departments, water control pivot of the West Bridge over the Aksu River is in urgent need of risk-elimination and reinforcement. Based on hydraulic model test, discharge capacity and sand transporting effect of floodgate and <b>scouring</b> <b>sluice</b> as well as design reasonability of energy dissipation and erosion control structure at pivot downstream have been observed and measured in risk-elimination and reinforcement of the West Bridge. It is indicated in experimental research, compared with the designed flow and checked flow in the design, the measured water levels of the floodgate are 0. 43 m and 0. 47 m lower, and measured water levels of <b>scouring</b> <b>sluice</b> are 0. 12 m and 0. 15 m lower; opening ten holes of the floodgate can take significant sand transporting effect, while <b>scouring</b> <b>sluice</b> makes insignificant sand transporting effect; {{it is suggested that}} design institute shall take erosion control measures into consideration within 100 m to the floodgate tank. Project overview Water control pivot at the West Bridge over the Aksu River is large pivot integrated irrigation, power generation by diverting water, water supplied for production and life, flood prevention...|$|R
2500|$|In {{place of}} the Overfall he {{constructed}} three shallow sluices and one deep <b>scouring</b> <b>sluice,</b> between the harbour and the New Cut, together with a dredging vessel, known as a drag boat, to scrape the silt away from the quay walls. Sluices 1, 2 and 4 ('shallow') are used to control the water level, while sluice 3 [...] ('deep') removes the silt. When the deep sluice is opened at low tide, a powerful undertow is created which sucks the silt out of the harbour and into the river. In March 1988, the sluice control was computerised and automated.|$|R
50|$|The canal {{was to be}} 20 ft deep at {{high water}} on spring tides, {{which would make it}} {{suitable}} for ships of 300 tons, with a draught of up to 16 ft. In the lower half there would be a <b>scouring</b> <b>sluice</b> and navigation gates. The canal would be 150 ft wide above the sluice and 200 ft wide below it. Work on the <b>scouring</b> <b>sluice</b> and the reservoir which would store the water for scouring of the channel was undertaken by Humphrey Smith in 1727 and 1728. Piers were to be constructed where the canal met the sea, and the west pier was the first to be started in 1728. Building of the foundations was overseen by Edward Rubie, Perry's foreman, and the contract for the main stonework was awarded to Christopher Cass and Andrews Jelfe. They completed the work in 1730. Perry then left the project, and Rubie went on to supervise the construction of the east pier and the grand sluice, although it is thought that his working drawings were based on Perry's original plans. The grand sluice was the largest of its kind at the time, having five gates, each of which was 6 ft wide, and had huge abutments and a large central pier. Next to it was a navigation channel, which was 40 ft wide, and had a pair of pointed gates. By 1733 some Â£20,000 had been spent on the project, and after a brief pause to raise some more money, work resumed under the supervision of Robert Cooper.|$|R
5|$|The docks {{maintenance}} {{facility was}} established {{on the land}} exposed by the damming of the river to construct the harbour and remains sited at this location to the present day. William Jessop had created a weir in the dam at Underfall to allow surplus water to flow back into the New Cut, this {{was known as the}} 'Overfall'. By the 1830s, the Floating Harbour was suffering from severe silting. Isambard Kingdom Brunel was, however, able to devise a solution to this problem. In place of the Overfall he advised better use of three shallow sluices and one deep <b>scouring</b> <b>sluice</b> between the harbour and the New Cut, together with a dredging vessel. This drag boat would scrape the silt away from the quay walls. When the deep sluice opened at low tide, a powerful undertow sucked the silt into the river to be carried away on the next tide. The shallow sluices enabled adjustment of the dock water level according to weather conditions.|$|R
5000|$|The {{effectiveness}} of the flushing operations has been studied {{over the years by}} hydrographic surveys of the reservoir using turbidimeters, side scan sonar, sub-bottom profiler, repeated echo sounding, sediment coring and X-ray techniques. The studies have indicated that the sluices provided in the dam to flush the sediment deposits in the reservoir are effective given the [...] "duration and degree to which the reservoir is drawn down and on the discharge capacity of the sluices" [...] and also the shape of the reservoir, which in the case of Cachi is in a narrow gorge. Studies indicated that the average diameter of the sediments deposited in the reservoir was of the order of 0.04 mm. It was also noted that on the terraces of the reservoir flushing was not very effective since they were covered with water hyacinths which had trapped the sediments. The old river channel also had indicated a deposit rate of about 2 m, which, however, is now regularly flushed out by opening the <b>scouring</b> <b>sluice.</b>|$|R
500|$|The {{drainage}} of the fen {{was again}} addressed in 1664, when the Deeping Fen Act awarded the Earl of Manchester and others [...] {{of land in}} return for the drainage works. They were also obliged to maintain the banks of the Welland. The inadequacy of its outfall and a spate of bad weather stopped them from completing their task. They tried renting out the land they had been granted, but many tenants were unable to pay the rent, due to the poor state of the drainage which reduced crop yields. In April 1729, the Deeping Fen Adventurers received a letter from Captain John Perry, expressing the opinion {{that the only way to}} improve the drainage was to improve the river outfalls, and proposing the construction of <b>scouring</b> <b>sluices</b> on the river at Spalding, on Vernatt's drain at its outfall, and on the River Glen at Surfleet. Perry was an engineer of some repute, who had set the standard for engineering reports in 1727, when he published his recommendations for the North Level of the Fens. His plans were approved, and the Adventurers offered to give him land covering nearly [...] in payment for the work. He sold one third of the land to finance the project, and began work in 1730. Cowbit sluice on the Welland had six [...] wide gates which were operated by chains connected to a treadwheel. At high tide, water was penned in Cowbit Wash, between banks which were set well back from the main channel. At low tide, the sluice gates were opened, and the flow scoured out silt from the river bed for some [...] downstream. Perry died in February 1733, before the other works were completed, and was buried in Spalding churchyard.|$|R

A navigation lock was constructed beside the sluice, so that vessels could still gain access to the river above. Perry died in February 1733, and was buried in Spalding churchyard. The lock lasted until it was removed by the Welland commissioners in 1813.|$|R
50|$|The annual {{sediment}} load into the Cachi reservoir estimated at 0.81 million tons, which amounts to 1% storage {{volume of the}} reservoir, had been assessed {{at the planning stage}} to be distributed at 54% as thalweg deposits (flushed through low level sluice provided {{in the body of the}} dam), 21% getting deposited on the terraces, 18% flowing out through the spillway by gate operation and power intake through turbines and 7% trapped as bed load in the reservoir. This process is witnessed in two distinct parts of the reservoir - the upper part and the lower part - the upper part gets filled with sand and coarse sediments and the lower part, which is the deep river channel, gets deposited with fine sediment on its terraces which needs to be flushed by reservoir operation (a high concentration of sediments was noted near the power intake). However, for seven years after the project was commissioned, the reservoir was not desilted, which resulted in trapping of 82% of the sediment inflow into the reservoir and which moved towards the body of the dam and interfered with diversion of flow through the power intake in the body of the dam for power generation. The dam is provided with one <b>scouring</b> <b>sluice</b> at the bottom in the main river channel adjacent to the intake screen of the power intake that draws water for power generation. To keep the reservoir in a serviceable condition to derive planned power benefits, it became obligatory to drain the reservoir to its lowest level (though it caused an inevitable economic loss in power generation during the filling stage every year) and flush the deposited sediments downstream so that the intake does not get choked and allows sediment flow into the turbines. The first flushing operation was carried out in three well defined stages in 1973 and thereafter repeated every year till 1990. The downstream impact on the river regime as a result of the silt flushed from the reservoir was also studied when a peak concentration of 400 grams/litre were noted in the form of turbid water not only on the flood plains but also where the river merged with the Atlantic Sea. It was expected that these deposits would be flushed during the flood season. However, as a result of the silt flushing, some detrimental effect on the biota was noted by local people of the area in the downstream reaches of the river below the dam.|$|R
40|$|Prediction {{of likely}} scour depths is an {{important}} aspect of the design of hydraulic structures. While detailed guidance is available for the scour design of some structures, e. g. bridge foundations, scant information is available for many other structures. Recent, as yet unpublished, research findings for a number of fluvial structure types are presented herein. The research findings span <b>scour</b> downstream from <b>sluice</b> gates, <b>scour</b> in the vicinity of low weirs, together with a particular aspect of scour at bridge foundations that has previously received minimal attention. In each case, new data are presented, together with analyses of the data and simple (preliminary) design relationships are determined from the data. A feature common to bridges and low weirs is the form of the dependence of scour depth on flow intensity for clear-water and live-bed scour conditions. The new data are derived from small-scale laboratory experiments for non-cohesive (alluvial) bed materials; the research findings are limited accordingly...|$|R
40|$|Local <b>scour</b> {{downstream}} of <b>sluice</b> gates in erosive beds {{is one of}} {{the main}} concerns of hydraulic engineers because it can cause considerable damage to structures. Many researchers have conducted various studies to predict the maximum depth and length of scour holes and to develop new methods to control this phenomenon. In the methods that have recently been examined, embedded buried plates are used to control the scour in the erosive beds. In this study, using a physical model, the effect of buried plates in erosive beds on the depth of scour downstream of a hydraulic jump was studied. Several experiments were performed in which plates were buried at 50 Â° and 90 Â° angles at different distances from the apron in open channels with horizontal and reverse bed slopes. The results of experiments in which the scour profiles were drawn in dimensionless forms show that the angle and position of the plates are important to controlling and reducing scour depth. In fact, by reducing the angle of buried plates, the maximum depth of scour is also reduced. Also, comparison of the results of a single buried plate and double buried plates shows that using two buried plates at the distances of 30 and 45 Â cm from the non-erodible bed is more effective in reducing the scour depth. The best distances of the buried plates with angles of 90 Â° and 50 Â° from the non-erodible bed are 45 Â cm and 30 Â cm, respectively, in the condition with a single buried plate...|$|R
