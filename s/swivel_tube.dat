5000|$|Reference Pure (RP) [...] - New for 2011, the Reference Pure series {{features}} the same wood blend {{as the original}} Reference series, but with thinner shells (each ply [...]9mm thick), new [...] "Fat Tone" [...] hoops, and Masters Premium-style <b>swivel</b> <b>tube</b> lugs, {{all of which are}} designed to reduce the overall weight of the kit and to create a more open, resonant sound.|$|E
50|$|Masters Premium Legend (MPL) - Introduced at the 2011 Musikmesse music fair, the Legend Series {{incorporates}} most of {{the features}} found in the Reference Pure series such as Fat Tone hoops, thinner shells, and lightweight <b>swivel</b> <b>tube</b> lugs (snares only), {{all of which are}} designed to reduce the kit's weight. Unlike the Masters Premium line, these drums are only made from maple, with the choice of 4 mm or 6 mm shells. These drums are available only in Europe.|$|E
5000|$|The Philco Predicta TV set was {{introduced}} in 1957 for the 1958 model year. It was {{a black and white}} television with the picture tube mounted in a unique steerable pod on a pedestal. There were many versions: 17" [...] or 21" [...] picture tubes, wood or metal cabinets and table or floor standing versions, some with rare UHF tuners. Its specially designed, high-deflection-angle (to achieve a shallow front-to-back depth) picture tube {{turned out to be a}} very unreliable design, and cost the company dearly in repairs and reputation. Many of them were sold to motels and bars due to the convenience of the <b>swivel</b> <b>tube</b> arrangement. It was discontinued in 1960; a great failure for Philco, like the Edsel automobile was for Ford, which coincidentally ran exactly the same model years. Today, due to the unique design, the Predicta is a collector's favorite and restored examples can easily be found.|$|E
5000|$|... was {{the first}} of the class to be {{completed}} in May 1916, and trials revealed numerous problems, such as the aforementioned <b>swivel</b> <b>tubes,</b> and that their low freeboard and great length made them awkward to handle either surfaced or submerged. An early criticism of the class questioned the wisdom of combining such a large hull with so great a surface speed, producing a vessel with the pace of a destroyer and the turning circle of a battle-cruiser.|$|R
5|$|The {{ships were}} also armed with six 45cm torpedo tubes, all in above-water <b>swivel</b> mounts. Four <b>tubes</b> were {{mounted on the}} sides of the ship, another in the bow, and the last in the stern. These weapons were 5.1m (16ft9in) long and carried an 87.5kg (193lb) TNT warhead. They could be set at two speeds for {{different}} ranges. At , the torpedoes had a range of 800m (870yd). At an increased speed of , the range was reduced to 500m (550yb).|$|R

40|$|A part of {{the drill}} string – the swivel (rotational connector) – accomplishes an {{important}} task in the horizontal drilling. Its malfunctioning {{makes it impossible to}} draw in (install) large diameter and length pipelines. The causes of the connector break-down during the horizontal drilling are investigated in the paper. The drilling has been made for twenty inches gas pipeline installation during reaming operations. A trouble was encountered making good work conditions of a system consisting of the drilling machine drill string reamer <b>swivel</b> <b>tube</b> shield of Cardan joint and the gas pipeline 500 m long. In this case, the swivel brokes down and the planned operation was not finished. The assessment of improper drilling conditions, selection of operation system components, and drilling parameters and the insufficient technological supervising have created an excessive risk of failure. A proper application of technical analysis would considerably decrease the hazard of failure which cause large costs, delays and decrease of confidence to the drilling contractor and pipeline installation...|$|E
