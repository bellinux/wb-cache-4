5|$|Two {{competing}} {{theories have}} arisen {{about the cause}} of the explosion. The first is that the bomb detonated in or near the black powder magazine used for the ship's saluting guns and catapult charges. This would have detonated first and then ignited the <b>smokeless</b> <b>powder</b> magazines which was used for the ship's main armament. A 1944 Navy Bureau of Ships report suggests that a hatch leading to the black powder magazine was left open, possibly with flammable materials stocked nearby. The Naval History and Heritage Command explained that black powder might have been stockpiled outside the armored magazine. The alternative explanation is that the bomb penetrated the armored decks and detonated directly inside one of the starboard magazines for the main armament, but <b>smokeless</b> <b>powder</b> is relatively difficult to detonate. Thus the 14-inch powder bags required a black powder pad to quickly ignite the powder. The time elapsed from the bomb hit to the magazine explosion was shorter than experience suggested burning <b>smokeless</b> <b>powder</b> required to explode. It seems unlikely that a definitive answer to this question will ever be found, as the surviving physical evidence is insufficient to determine {{the cause of the}} magazine explosion.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of <b>smokeless</b> <b>powder,</b> based on nitroglycerine or nitrocellulose, by the French inventor Paul Vielle in 1884 was a further step allowing smaller charges of propellant with longer barrels. The guns of the pre-Dreadnought battleships of the 1890s {{tended to be}} smaller in calibre compared to the ships of the 1880s, most often 12in (305mm), but progressively grew in length of barrel, making use of improved propellants to gain greater muzzle velocity.|$|E
5|$|Several {{important}} {{technological advances}} had become available by this time, however, which necessitated several {{changes to the}} design. The advent of <b>smokeless</b> <b>powder</b> permitted smaller guns with greater muzzle velocities; the Navy had accordingly designed a 12-inch (305mm) 40-caliber high-velocity gun. In addition, Krupp cemented armor had been developed in Germany; the steel was a significant improvement over the older Harvey process. Since the steel was stronger, thinner armor plating could achieve {{the same level of}} protection and more importantly, significant savings in weight. Water-tube boilers were also now sufficiently reliable for use in warships. These were lighter and substantially more efficient than older fire-tube boilers.|$|E
50|$|<b>Smokeless</b> <b>powders</b> were {{originally}} developed using nitrocellulose {{as the sole}} explosive ingredient. Therefore, they were known as single-base propellants. A range of <b>smokeless</b> <b>powders</b> that contain both nitrocellulose and nitroglycerin, known as double-base propellants, were also developed. <b>Smokeless</b> <b>powders</b> {{were originally}} supplied only for military use, {{but they were also}} soon developed for civilian use and were quickly adopted for sports. Some are known as sporting powders. Triple-base propellants contain nitrocellulose, nitroglycerin, and nitroguanidine, but are reserved mainly for extremely high-caliber ammunition rounds such as those used in tank cannons and naval artillery.|$|R
50|$|<b>Smokeless</b> <b>powders</b> {{burn more}} slowly than black powder, thus {{maintaining}} high pressures throughout the barrel. Since the barrel is not reinforced at the muzzle, {{it may not be}} able to contain the pressure. Also, most Damascus barrels were made before modern <b>smokeless</b> <b>powders,</b> so the age of the barrel can be a safety hazard.|$|R
25|$|The {{latter half}} of the 19th century saw the {{invention}} of nitroglycerin, nitrocellulose and <b>smokeless</b> <b>powders</b> which soon replaced black powder in many applications.|$|R
25|$|Modern <b>smokeless</b> <b>powder</b> is {{coated in}} {{graphite}} {{to prevent the}} buildup of static charge.|$|E
25|$|California Powder Works began {{producing}} <b>smokeless</b> <b>powder</b> for firearms ammunition in {{the early}} 1890s. Peyton Powder, prepared at Santa Cruz {{under the direction of}} assistant superintendent William Peyton, had an unusual addition of ammonium picrate to the conventional double-base formulation of nitrocellulose and nitroglycerine. Peyton Powder was selected by the United States Army in 1893 for early cartridges for the new Krag-Jørgensen service rifle. The powder works also produced CPW <b>Smokeless</b> <b>powder</b> and loaded shotgun ammunition marketed as Native Son Cartridges after the army adopted W.A. powder in 1896 to avoid cartridge case corrosion caused by picric acid in the Peyton Powder.|$|E
25|$|Towards the end {{of their}} use in the armed forces, the {{original}} gunpowder cartridges were replaced by cartridges filled with <b>smokeless</b> <b>powder.</b> Despite the increase in muzzle velocity, the sights were not altered, thus radically decreasing the accuracy of the rifle.|$|E
50|$|Since <b>smokeless</b> <b>powders</b> burn, not detonate, the {{reaction}} {{can only take}} place {{on the surface of the}} <b>powder.</b> <b>Smokeless</b> <b>powders</b> come in a variety of shapes, which serve to determine how fast they burn, and also how the burn rate changes as the powder burns. The simplest shape is a ball powder, which is in the form of round or slightly flattened spheres. Ball powder has a comparatively small surface-area-to-volume ratio, so it burns comparatively slowly, and as it burns, its surface area decreases. This means as the powder burns, the burn rate slows down.|$|R
50|$|It {{was loaded}} with both black <b>powder</b> and <b>smokeless</b> <b>powders,</b> usually with a 65 gr g lead solid or hollowpoint bullet at a {{standard}} muzzle velocity of 1200 ft/s.|$|R
50|$|It was {{not until}} the {{parallel}} developments of jacketed projectiles, closely followed by <b>smokeless</b> <b>powders</b> in the late 19th century, that dangerous game could be taken with near 100% certainty.|$|R
25|$|The fort's heavy {{guns were}} German, {{typically}} Krupp, while the turret mechanisms {{were from a}} variety of sources. The fort was provided with signal lights to permit communication with neighboring forts. The guns were fired using black powder rather than <b>smokeless</b> <b>powder,</b> producing choking gas in the confined firing spaces that spread throughout the fort.|$|E
25|$|During {{the late}} 19th Century, as Western {{manufacturers}} developed {{machine guns and}} other rapid fire ordnance, it became imperative to reduce the smoke that obscured battlefields and revealed hidden gun emplacements. Camphor was an essential component {{in the production of}} smokeless gunpowder. Also, the new <b>smokeless</b> <b>powder</b> did not foul the weapons as much as conventional gunpowder.|$|E
25|$|The fort's heavy {{guns were}} German, {{typically}} Krupp, while the turret mechanisms {{were from a}} variety of sources. The fort was provided with signal lights to permit communication with the neighboring Fort de Loncin and Fort de Liers. The guns were fired using black powder rather than <b>smokeless</b> <b>powder,</b> producing choking gas in the confined firing spaces that spread throughout the fort.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike {{previous}} cartridges, the [...]375 H&H {{operates at}} relatively higher pressures and was designed {{from the outset}} for use with <b>smokeless</b> <b>powders</b> that can generate higher pressures and thus higher velocities. However, when the cartridge was designed pressure levels were held to [...] as cordite was sensitive to temperature and could cause dangerously high pressures in the hot tropical climates of Africa and India. However, modern <b>smokeless</b> <b>powders</b> are not as sensitive to ambient temperatures as cordite and therefore both the C.I.P. and SAAMI provide far higher allowable pressures than the original loading of the cartridge allowed.|$|R
2500|$|Despite its {{decline as}} a {{sporting}} round, the [...]300 Savage remains quite popular with handloaders {{who are able}} to use newer <b>smokeless</b> <b>powders</b> and more aerodynamic bullets to obtain optimum performance from it.|$|R

25|$|In 1896, at {{serial number}} 164,100, a {{spring-loaded}} base pin latch replaced the cylinder pin retaining screw and by 1900, at serial number 192,000, the Colt Single Action was certified {{for use with}} <b>smokeless</b> <b>powder.</b> In 1920, larger, highly visible sights replaced the original thin blade and notch. The revolvers remained essentially unchanged from that point until cessation of manufacture {{at the beginning of}} World War II.|$|E
25|$|The large {{weapons were}} all German products, made by Krupp in Essen, but the armor was by Cockerill (Belgium), Ateliers de Creusot (France) or Grüson (Germany). The fort was {{provided}} with signal lights to permit {{communication with the}} neighboring Fort de Lantin and Fort de Hollogne. The guns were fired using black powder rather than <b>smokeless</b> <b>powder,</b> producing choking gas in the confined firing spaces that spread throughout the fort.|$|E
25|$|California Powder Works {{became a}} DuPont {{subsidiary}} in 1903, and operated under the DuPont name after 1906. Powder works wharf demolition begun in 1883 was completed before {{construction of the}} Neptune Casino at the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk in 1904. DuPont control of explosives manufacturing in the United States caused federal anti-trust action in 1912 requiring DuPont to distribute assets into three firms. Manufacture of blasting explosives was assigned to Atlas Powder Company. California Powder Works double-base <b>smokeless</b> <b>powder</b> patents were assigned to Hercules Powder Company's consolidated <b>smokeless</b> <b>powder</b> manufacturing facility at Kenvil, New Jersey. DuPont retained manufacture of black powder and single base smokeless powders including the powder being manufactured for the United States Navy. When the Panama Canal simplified transport to the Pacific Fleet, DuPont consolidated production facilities in New Jersey and terminated operations at Santa Cruz in 1914. Powder mill facilities were dismantled, and the property was sold in 1924. The two mansions occupied by powder works superintendents were abandoned and razed in the 1930s.|$|E
5000|$|A United Kingdom {{government}} committee, {{known as}} the [...] "Explosives Committee", chaired by Sir Frederick Abel, monitored foreign developments in explosives and obtained samples of Poudre B and Ballistite; neither of these <b>smokeless</b> <b>powders</b> was recommended for adoption by the Explosives Committee.|$|R

50|$|The Remington Rolling Block rifle was a breech-loading rifle {{produced}} from the mid-1860s {{into the early}} 20th century by E. Remington and Sons (later Remington Arms Company). The action was extremely strong, and could easily withstand the increased pressure of the new <b>smokeless</b> <b>powders</b> coming into use by the late 1880s.|$|R
25|$|Goddard {{described}} extensive {{experiments with}} solid-fuel rocket engines burning high grade nitrocellulose <b>smokeless</b> <b>powder.</b> A critical breakthrough {{was the use}} of the steam turbine nozzle invented by the Swedish inventor Gustaf de Laval. The de Laval nozzle allows the most efficient (isentropic) conversion of the energy of hot gases into forward motion. By means of this nozzle, Goddard increased the efficiency of his rocket engines from 2 percent to 64 percent and obtained supersonic exhaust velocities of over Mach 7.|$|E
25|$|The term {{black powder}} was coined {{in the late}} 19th century, {{primarily}} in the United States, to distinguish prior gunpowder formulations from the new smokeless powders and semi-smokeless powders. Semi-smokeless powders featured bulk volume properties that approximated black powder, but had significantly reduced amounts of smoke and combustion products. <b>Smokeless</b> <b>powder</b> has different burning properties (pressure vs. time) and can generate higher pressures and work per gram. This can rupture older weapons designed for black powder. Smokeless powders ranged in color from brownish tan to yellow to white. Most of the bulk semi-smokeless powders ceased to be manufactured in the 1920s.|$|E
25|$|California Powder Works {{manufactured}} powder for naval artillery. Initial {{production was}} prismatic brown powder, and the works later obtained {{a license to}} produce The United States Navy's patented nitrocellulose <b>smokeless</b> <b>powder.</b> Both powders were used by the Pacific and Asiatic Fleets, and for Pacific harbor and coast defense. The powder works operated a proving ground at Santa Cruz beginning 1892 using guns provided by the United States Inspector of Ordnance. Individual powder lots were test fired in the guns {{for which they were}} intended, including a 57mm QF 6 pounder Hotchkiss, a 6"/45 caliber Quick-Fire Rifle Model 1897, and an 8"/32 caliber Breech-Loading Rifle Model 1888.|$|E
50|$|<b>Smokeless</b> <b>powders</b> are {{classified}} as, typically, division 1.3 explosives under the UN Recommendations on the transportation of Dangerous goods - Model Regulations, regional regulations (such as ADR) and national regulations (such the United States' ATF). However, {{they are used}} as solid propellants; in normal use, they undergo deflagration rather than detonation.|$|R
5000|$|... 2-Nitrodiphenylamine {{is used as}} a {{stabilizer}} for synthetic rubbers, explosives, propellants (e.g. in Otto fuel II, <b>smokeless</b> <b>powders,</b> in some US Army double-base propellants {{in solid}} rockets, and in other applications involving nitric acid esters), plastics, and lubricants. It is also an intermediate for organic synthesis, and a civilian solvent dye.|$|R
5000|$|Plasticizers. Improve the {{mechanical}} {{properties of the}} propellant particles. For composite rocket propellants, dioctyl adipate, isodecyl pelargonate, and dioctyl phthalate are often used. Plasticizers can also be other energetic materials (common in <b>smokeless</b> <b>powders),</b> e.g. nitroglycerine, butanetriol trinitrate, dinitrotoluene, trimethylolethane trinitrate, diethylene glycol dinitrate, triethylene glycol dinitrate, bis(2,2-dinitropropyl)formal, bis(2,2-dinitropropyl)acetal, 2,2,2-trinitroethyl 2-nitroxyethyl ether, and others.|$|R
25|$|The great {{explosion}} of 1898 {{started in the}} <b>smokeless</b> <b>powder</b> plant at 5:15 PM on April 26. Santa Cruz was rocked {{by a series of}} heavy explosions which killed 13 men at the powder works and injured 25 more. Windows were broken in Santa Cruz, and flaming debris fell on Mission Hill. Many buildings used to house company employees were set afire and a community effort was required by residents of Santa Cruz to prevent fires from reaching powder magazines closer to the city. The explosion caused apprehension among Santa Cruz residents about the safety of operating the powder works so close to the city. Santa Cruz County closed the powder works school and required powder works employee housing facilities to be vacated.|$|E
25|$|The Model 1895 was {{the first}} Winchester rifle to feature a box {{magazine}} located underneath the action instead of the tubular magazine design, which had remained fundamentally unchanged from the Winchester 1866. This allowed the rifle to safely chamber military and hunting cartridges with spitzer (pointed) bullets. The M1895 was also {{the last of the}} lever-action rifles to be designed by John Browning, and featured a rear locking bolt as in his previous designs dating back to the Winchester 1886. The M1895 is the strongest lever-action rifle Winchester has produced, designed to handle the increased pressures generated by the more powerful <b>smokeless</b> <b>powder</b> cartridges entering common use {{at the time of its}} introduction. By today’s standards however, the design is considered relatively weak, and not suited to high pressure loads.|$|E
25|$|Since many {{countries}} heavily restrict the civilian possession of ammunition and ammunition components, including primers and <b>smokeless</b> <b>powder,</b> handloading may be explicitly or implicitly illegal in certain countries. Even without specific restrictions on powder and primers, {{they may be}} covered under other laws governing explosive materials. Handloading may require study and passing an exam to acquire a handloading permit prior to being allowed to handload ammunition in some jurisdictions. This is done to avoid catastrophic accidents caused by lack of knowledge/skill as much as possible, and also allows the government to maintain information on who reloads their own cartridges. The standards organization C.I.P. rules that the products of handloaders that do not comply with the C.I.P. ammunition approval rules for commercial ammunition manufacturers cannot be legally sold in C.I.P. member states.|$|E
50|$|Trimethylolethane trinitrate (TMETN), {{also known}} as metriol trinitrate (METN, MTN, METRTN) or nitropentaglycerin, is a nitrate ester. It is a high {{explosive}} similar to nitroglycerin. It is a transparent oily liquid, colorless to light brown. It is odorless. It is used in some solid propellants and <b>smokeless</b> <b>powders</b> as a plasticizer. Its chemical formula is CH3-C(CH2-O-NO2)3.|$|R
50|$|The United States {{military}} replaced gunpowder {{during the}} first decade of the 20th century with <b>smokeless</b> <b>powders</b> formulated from nitrocellulose colloided with ether and alcohol. Large quantities were manufactured for World War I and significant amounts remained unused after the war. Nitrocellulose deteriorates in storage, but military quantities of old smokeless propellant were sometimes reworked into new lots of propellants.|$|R
