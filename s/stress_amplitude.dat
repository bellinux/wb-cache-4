5000|$|Earthquake {{forecasting}} {{differs from}} prediction {{in the sense}} that no alarm is issued, but a time-dependent probability of earthquake occurrence is estimated. Sornette's group has contributed significantly to the theoretical development and study of the properties of the now standard Epidemic Type Aftershock Sequence (ETAS) model [...] In a nutshell, this model states that each event triggers its own direct aftershocks, which themselves trigger their own aftershocks, and so on... The consequence is that events cannot be labeled anymore as foreshocks, mainshocks or aftershocks, as they can be all of {{that at the same time}} (with different levels of probability). In this model, the probability for an event to trigger another one primarily depends on their separating space and time distances, as well as on the magnitude of the triggering event, so that seismicity is then governed by a set of seven parameters. Sornette's group is currently pushing the model to its limits by allowing space and time variations of its parameters. Despite the fact that this new model reaches better forecasting scores than any other competing model, it is not sufficient to achieve systematic reliable predictions. The main reason is that this model predicts future seismicity rates quite accurately, but fails to put constraints on the magnitudes (which are assumed to be distributed according to the Gutenberg-Richter law, and to be independent of each other). Some other seismic or non-seismic precursors are thus required in order to further improve those forecasts. According to the ETAS model, the rate of triggered activity around a given event behaves isotropically. This over-simplified assumption has recently relaxed by coupling the statistics of ETAS to genuine mechanical information. This is done by modelling the stress perturbation due to a given event on its surroundings, and correlating it with the space-time rate of subsequent activity as a function of transferred <b>stress</b> <b>amplitude</b> and sign. This suggests that triggering of aftershocks stems from a combination of dynamic (seismic waves) and elasto-static processes. Another unambiguous interesting result of this work is that the Earth crust in Southern California has quite a short memory of past stress fluctuations lasting only about 3 to 4 months. This may put more constraint on the time window within which one may look for both seismic and non-seismic precursors.|$|E

The friction stir welding resulted in recrystallized grains in the stir zone (SZ) and thermomechanicallyaffected zone (TMAZ), and partially recrystallized grains in the heat-affected zone (HAZ), with the lowest hardness appeared in the SZ. The fatigue life after friction stir welding was observed to be lower at high <b>stress</b> <b>amplitudes,</b> but remained nearly the same at low <b>stress</b> <b>amplitudes.</b> Fatigue strength was higher in the FSWed joints made with the LHT pin tool than with the RHT pin tool due to the elimination of the welding defects near the bottom surface via a downward material flow. Fatigue fracture basically occurred at or near the boundary between TMAZ and SZ. Fatigue crack initiated from the specimen surface or near surface defects in the case of LHT pin tool, and from the welding defects near the bottom surface in the case of RHT pin tool.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Cyclically loaded {{machine parts}} made of high strength-steel mostly fail at high lifetimes from {{subsurface}} inclusions. This phenomenon was observed notably in fatigue tests at low <b>stress</b> <b>amplitudes,</b> which cause {{failure in the}} very high cycle fatigue (VHCF) regime. In contrast, at high <b>stress</b> <b>amplitudes</b> the crack initiation and failure starts from the surface. It can be shown that, depending on stress level, different crack growth mechanisms play an essential role for the failure from subsurface inclusions. To analyse the crack growth initiated from inclusions, specimens of the bearing steel 100 Cr 6 in martensitic condition were tested under tension-compression at different loads till failure. The fracture surfaces were analysed by a scanning electron microscope (SEM) with focus on the crack origin, to apply fracture mechanics theory. In combination to this the microstructure below the crack surface was analysed in detail by a focused ion beam (FIB) preparation of {{the area around the}} inclusion and a transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observation. Finally the change of failure mode is explained by different crack growth mechanisms, which depend on the respective stress intensity factors and a general threshold value for the initiation of long cracks...|$|R

40|$|A {{simplified}} method for estimating the fatigue limit and the fatigue life under two-step loading for the stress ratio R = 0 {{based on the}} results for R = - 1 was proposed. This method required the fatigue test under constant amplitude loading and two-step loading for R = - 1. In this paper, fatigue tests were carried out using high-strength aluminum alloy. In two-step loading for R = - 1, two <b>stress</b> <b>amplitude</b> 1 eve 1 s were used as the primary stress amp 1 itude and three cycle ratios were combined. The cycle ratio was defined as the ratio of cycles at the primary <b>stress</b> <b>amplitude</b> to the corresponding fatigue life.
