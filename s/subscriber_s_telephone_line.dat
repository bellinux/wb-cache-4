Clients were equipped with a commercially available video-phone connected using the client 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> home <b>telephone</b> <b>line.</b> A hands-free speaker-phone and a miniature video-camera (for close-up views) were connected to the video-phone.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To analyze {{differences}} in sociodemographic characteristics associated with health in individuals {{with and without}} a residential <b>telephone</b> <b>line.</b> METHODS: Data from the ISA-Capital 2003 (2003 Health Survey), a study performed {{in the city of}} São Paulo, Southeastern Brazil, were analyzed. Residents who had a residential <b>telephone</b> <b>line</b> were compared to those who reported not having a <b>telephone</b> <b>line,</b> according to sociodemographic, lifestyle, health status and health service use variables. Bias associated with noncoverage of the population without a <b>telephone</b> <b>line</b> was estimated, decreasing after the use of post-stratifi cation adjustments. RESULTS: Of all the 1, 878 interviewees aged more than 18 years, 80. 1 % had a residential <b>telephone</b> <b>line.</b> By comparing groups, the main sociodemographic differences among individuals who did not have a residential <b>telephone</b> <b>line</b> were the following: younger age, greater proportion of black and mixed individuals, smaller proportion of married interviewees, and greater proportion of unemployed individuals with a lower level of education. Residents without a residential <b>telephone</b> <b>line</b> had fewer health tests performed and smoked and drank more. In addition, this group took less medication, considered themselves to be in worse health conditions and used the SUS (National Health System) more frequently. When excluding the population without a <b>telephone</b> <b>line</b> from the analysis, estimates of dental consultations, alcoholism, drug use and SUS use to have a Papanicolaou test performed were those showing the highest bias. After post-stratifi cation adjustment, there was a decrease in the bias of estimates for the variables associated with ownership of a residential <b>telephone</b> <b>line.</b> CONCLUSIONS: The exclusion of residents without a <b>telephone</b> <b>line</b> {{was one of the main}} limitations to the studies performed in this way. However, the use of statistical techniques of post-stratifi cation adjustment enables a reduction in non-coverage bias...|$|R
