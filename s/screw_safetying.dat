50|$|At around 6 pm on 5 August, Inspectors Ranchin and Culioli {{recovered}} a Rock-Ola M1 carbine {{from the river}} Durance. It was broken in two and had clearly been in very poor condition even before being thrown into the river. Several pieces were missing and repairs had been made using makeshift knick-knacks: the sight {{had been replaced by}} half of a 1-franc coin, while the wooden forearm covering the barrel was missing. The lever had been replaced by a Duralumin ring taken from a bicycle's identity plaque, which was fixed to the wood by a <b>screw.</b> The <b>safety</b> strap was missing and the bolt stop was broken. Therefore, {{it was more of a}} DIY handyman's weapon than that of a seasoned killer.|$|R
50|$|It {{has also}} been {{hypothesized}} that polyaxial <b>screws</b> add a <b>safety</b> benefit by failing in the housing/screw interface before breaking in the shaft of the bone screw or in the orthopaedic rod. Unlike standard lateral mass plate and screw systems, the new cervical polyaxial screw and rod system easily accommodates severe degenerative cervical spondylosis and curvatures. This instrumentation system allows for polyaxial screw placement with subsequent multiplanar rod contouring and offset attachment.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACTComplications from total knee {{arthroplasty}} {{caused by}} the implanted material are rare, {{with the exception of}} polyethylene wear. Descriptions of screw migration into the knee joint cavity are very rare. The authors report intra-articular migration of a polyethylene <b>safety</b> <b>screw</b> in a case of total knee arthroplasty, with sacrifice of the posterior cruciate ligament (TKA Performance; Biomet, Warsaw, IN, USA), which necessitated new surgery to remove the screw, replace the polyethylene insert and emplace a new fixation screw...|$|R
40|$|Reverse {{shoulder}} arthroplasty (RSA) {{has been}} a proposed surgical treatment for severe rotator cuff deficiency associated with arthritis. Favourable clinical results {{for this type of}} prosthesis have been reported from short- and mid-term follow-up studies. However, the high revision rate (5 % - 33 %) at long-term follow up (i. e. greater than 6 years) is a concern. One of the principal factors leading to RSA failure is glenoid component loosening with an incidence of 5 % - 38 %. Therefore, one objective of this project is to investigate factors leading to long-term glenoid loosening. As various glenosphere positions have been proposed to minimize scapular notching, the other objective is to predict fixation strengths associated with these new surgical techniques. Scapular notching {{is one of the most}} frequently reported complications for Delta RSA, due to the high postoperative incidence of 50 % to 96 %. In this thesis, the study of scapular notching showed negative effects on the inferior <b>screw</b> <b>safety</b> and safety of the bone close to the screw. The study of initial stability showed that scapular notching may not destroy the good environment for bony ingrowth. Strain-induced bone remodelling {{has been a}}n important factor for the bone loss after hip and knee joint prosthesis implantations. Effects of this factor on the bone loss after Delta RSA implantations were investigated. The results showed that bone resorption was considerable in the region close to the back of metagelene and the middle stem with a mean reduction of postoperative bone apparent density of approximately 63 % at 8 -year follow up. Thereby, postoperative bone loss could be caused by three factors: strain-induced bone resorption, scapular notching and osteolysis induced by the polyethylene wear particles. In this study, prosthesis fixations in the case of inferior positioning and downward tilting of the glenosphere were assessed using two parameters: strain-induced bone resorption and initial stability. It was found that inferior positioning may lead to early bone resorption due to the inferior shift of postoperative glenohumeral force. The downward tilting may cause significant increase of bone-prosthesis micromotions and may result in poor initial stabilities of glenoid prosthesis.

50|$|Users {{liked the}} Mac IIcx, in part, because its {{components}} and parts (such as the RAM, NuBus slots, and power supply) snapped into place inside the case {{without the need}} for screws. There was one central <b>safety</b> <b>screw</b> that tied the assembly together though it was often not reinstalled if ever removed. At the IIcx's introduction, Jean-Louis Gassee demonstrated the IIcx's modular design by assembling one from parts in front of the audience. This made it less expensive to build, easier to repair, and earned it heavy praise and a warm reception amongst the Mac community.|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE The {{need for}} spinal {{instrumented}} fusion in osteoporotic patients is rising. In this review, {{we try to}} give {{an overview of the}} current spectrum of pedicle <b>screw</b> augmentation techniques, <b>safety</b> aspects and indications. METHODS Review of literature and discussion of indications, limitations and technical aspects. RESULTS Various studies have shown higher failure rates in osteoporotic patients, most probably due to reduced bone quality and a poor bone-screw interface. Augmentation of pedicle screws with bone cement, such as polymethylmethacrylate or calcium based cements, is one valid option to enhance fixation if required. CONCLUSIONS Crucial factors for success in the use of augmented screws are careful patient selection, a proper technique and choice of the ideal cement augmentation option...|$|R
50|$|The mine is {{circular}} {{and has a}} very rounded appearance, with {{a central}} metal cap that covers the mine's safety device, a large screw. The mine is unusual in that it uses five igniter/fuzes linked to a central detonator {{by a series of}} flame tubes. Sufficient pressure on the top surface of the mine causes it to press down on {{one or more of the}} igniters, compressing a spring and allowing two steel striker retaining balls to escape, releasing the striker, which is forced upwards by a second spring. The striker hits a percussion cap at the top of the igniter, the flash from which travels along a flame tube to a metal chamber in the centre of the mine. If the <b>safety</b> <b>screw</b> is removed then the flash is free to ignite the detonator, which in turn detonates the main charge.|$|R

40|$|Thoracoscopically-assisted {{anterior}} spinal instrumentation {{is being}} used widely to treat adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). Recent studies have showed that screws placed thoracoscopically could counter the aorta or entrance into the spinal canal. There are a few studies defining the anatomic landmarks to identify {{the relationship between the}} aorta and the thoracic vertebral body using quantitative measurement for the sake of safe placement of thoracoscopic vertebral screw in anterior correction for AIS. The CT scanning from T 4 to T 12 in 64 control subjects and 30 AIS patients from mainland China were analyzed manually. Parameters to be measured included the angle for <b>safety</b> <b>screw</b> placement (α), the angle of the aorta relative to the vertebral body (β), the distance from the line between {{the left and the right}} rib heads to the anterior wall of the vertebral canal (a), the distance from the left rib head to posterior wall of the aorta (b), the vertebral body transverse diameter (c) and vertebral rotation (γ). No significant differences were found between the groups with respect to age or sex. Compared with the control group, α angle from T 7 to T 10, β angle from T 5 to T 10 and b value at T 9, T 10 were significantly lower in the scoliotic group. The a value was significantly lower in the scoliotic group. The c value showed no significant difference between the two groups. In conclusion, to place the thoracoscopic vertebral screw safely, at the cephalad thoracic spine (T 4 –T 6), the maximum ventral excursion angle should decrease gradually from 20 ° to 5 °, the entry-point of the screw should be close to the rib head. For apical vertebrae (T 7 –T 9), the maximum ventral excursion angle increased gradually from 5 ° to 12 °. At the caudal thoracic spine (T 10 –T 12), the maximum ventral excursion angle increased, the entry-point should shift 3 ∼ 5  mm ventrally...|$|R
