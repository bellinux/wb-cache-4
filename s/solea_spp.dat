Since 1969, this disease {{has been one of the}} most important in Japan, affecting mainly yellowtail (Seriola quinqueradiata) (Kusuda & Yamaoka, 1972). From 1990 it has caused economic losses in different European countries including France (Baudin-Laurencin et al., 1991), Italy (Ceschia et al., 1991), Spain (Toranzo et al., 1991), Greece (Bakopoulos et al., 1995), Turkey (Canand et al., 1996), Portugal (Baptista et al., 1996) and Malta (Bakopoulos et al., 1997). Gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata), seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax) and sole (<b>Solea</b> <b>spp.)</b> are the most affected species in Europe Mediterranean countries, as well as hybrid striped bass (M. saxatilis x M. chrysops) in the USA. However, the natural hosts of the pathogen are a wide variety of marine fish (Romalde & Magariños, 1997).|$|E

Samples (n = 141) of <b>Solea</b> <b>spp.</b> were submitted to instrumental analysis and minced wet muscle were scanned in reflectance mode using a NIRSystem 5000. NIRS technique showed a higher precision in predicting ED (fraction of explained variance, R 2 = 0. 83 and estimate of R-square, r 2 = 0. 55) and aW (R 2 = 0. 84; r 2 = 0. 69). Results show that NIRS was able {{to discriminate between}} fresh (99 % samples recognized) and frozen-thawed (77 % samples recognized) raw fillet...|$|E
40|$|In sole (<b>Solea</b> <b>spp.)</b> culture, like {{in other}} {{flatfish}} culture, {{it is likely}} that a vertical gradient of dissolved oxygen (DO) occurs with the lower concentrations being at the tank bottom. This lower concentration at the tank bottom is a consequence of fish oxygen consumption and of the presence of the boundary layer. This fact generates lower DO concentrations in the near-bottom zone where soles are lying most of the time. The aim of this work was to study the hydrodynamic conditions that determine the oxygen gradient that occurs in the layer of water adjacent to flatfish.; Three flow rates were tested in a circular tank and in a rectangular or raceway tank. For each flow rate, water velocities, boundary layer thickness and Reynolds number were calculated. Results showed that the vertical gradient of dissolved oxygen diminishes when water velocity and Reynolds numbers (Re) increase. At the fish density used in this work (11. 6 kg m(- 2)), when Re decreased under 6000, a large increase in the DO gradient was observed. Guidelines are presented to determine in which situations, as defined by hydraulic parameters, Re > 6000 is achieved and DO stratification avoided.; The present work shows that in raceways, the flow rate required to avoid DO stratification is higher than that typically needed to maintain water quality (oxygen, ammonia-nitrogen, carbon dioxide and suspended solids). In circular tanks, it can be easier to achieve velocities that are high enough to avoid stratification with low water inlet flow rates, by adjusting the area of the water entry orifices.

40|$|Tese de mestrado em Biologia e Gestão dos Recursos Marinhos, apresentada à Universidade de Lisboa, através da Faculdadede Ciências, 2007 Soles (<b>Solea</b> <b>spp.)</b> {{are heavily}} {{exploited}} all {{round the world}} (fisheries and aquaculture) due to their high commercial value. Nonetheless, the knowledge on their biology and the exploitation status of their stocks is limited to certain geographical areas. A key issue to management is the population structure of fisheries resources. The aim {{of the present study}} is to determine the genetic diversity and population structure of Solea solea (Linnaeus, 1758), and Solea senegalensis, Kaup, 1858, throughout their distribution range and to evaluate its relationships with life history patterns. The genetic diversity and population structure of both species were analysed based on sequences of cytochrome b of mitochondrial DNA (about 1141 bp in length). A low nucleotide diversity ( 0. 600) was observed for both species (except for Portugal-North population of S. senegalensis, h= 0. 378). The pairwise 2 -statistics and AMOVA for S. solea evidenced a high genetic divergence between Atlantic and Mediterranean populations and between the Eastern and Western areas of the Mediterranean. Significant differences were also observed between samples of S. senegalensis, with geographical distance per se assuming a very important role in structuring populations and presenting a strong association with genetic divergence amongst the set of samples analyzed. Minimum spanning network analyses, revealed star-shaped patterns for populations of both species, suggesting that populations had undergone Summary - x - expansion following bottlenecks. Atlantic populations of S. solea, ranging from the Baltic Sea to South Portugal could be considered as representative of the same panmictic unit, presenting high levels of gene flow. The higher levels of diversity observed in S. senegalensis compared to S. solea may be due to differences in the duration of the pelagic larval phase, spawning period and habitat use patterns, with water temperature assuming a major roResumo alargado disponível em portuguê...|$|E
