40|$|Photovoltaic modules have no {{moving parts}} and last upwards of 25 years with no {{maintenance}} aside from occasional cleaning. The installation of modules in building facades and other structures has necessitated {{the use of}} push fit connectors to enable quick and easy inter-module DC electrical connection. New applications for photovoltaics such as roof shingles (tiles) place further performance demands on connectors. The day-night variation in temperature within a PV roof for example, creates component expansion. This paper details the behaviour of a tin plated copper photovoltaic connector under small amplitude fretting tests (10 - 100 ?m) using a specially developed accelerated lifetime test rig. The mated connector creates a high force, multiple point contact between {{the male and female}} components by the use of a prestressed <b>spring</b> <b>collar.</b> The study shows that a transition amplitude exists (~ 13 ?m) above which gross slip at the connector interface appears to occur. This causes a gradual linear increase in contact resistance, followed by a sudden change to rapid wearing of the tin plating on both the connector surfaces and <b>spring</b> <b>collar,</b> leading to connector failure. Below the transition amplitude, partial slip at the connector interface is observed which creates a stable, low contact resistance. The paper highlights the need to maintain a partial slip/stick condition within a PV connector for long term contact resistance stability. The implication of this requirement for photovoltaic connector design and application is discussed, considering the benefits of flexible connector housings and lubricants in particular...|$|E
5000|$|Adjustable {{dumbbells}} {{consist of}} a metal bar whose centre portion is often engraved with a crosshatch pattern (knurling) to improve grip. Weight plates are slid onto the outer portions of the dumbbell and secured with clips or collars. Shown to the right is a [...] "spinlock" [...] dumbbell, whose ends are threaded to accept large nuts as collars. Alternatively, a dumbbell may have smooth ends with plates being secured by a <b>sprung</b> <b>collar.</b> Nowadays, many commercially sold dumbbells are available with sophisticated, and easy-to-use methods for weight increments adjustments.|$|R

50|$|Compared to the Tantal, the Onyks {{features}} a barrel reduced in length by 216 mm, {{fitted with a}} different type of muzzle device. Due to the barrelâ€™s length, this device is primarily used to reduce muzzle flash, {{but it can also be}} used to mount and launch rifle grenades. At its muzzle end, the device has a conical flash hider, and on its tapered, external surface - a retainer <b>spring</b> and two <b>collars,</b> used to attach and guide rifle grenades.|$|R
60|$|Master Dignam {{walked along}} Nassau street, shifted the porksteaks to his other hand. His <b>collar</b> <b>sprang</b> {{up again and}} he tugged it down. The {{blooming}} stud was {{too small for the}} buttonhole of the shirt, blooming end to it. He met schoolboys with satchels. I'm not going tomorrow either, stay away till Monday. He met other schoolboys. Do they notice I'm in mourning? Uncle Barney said he'd get it into the paper tonight. Then they'll all see it in the paper and read my name printed and pa's name.|$|R
40|$|In {{a survey}} of rehabilitated bauxite mines m {{south-west}} Western Australia, Phytophthora cinnamomi was isolated from the collar, but not from the root system of dead and dying Eucalyptus marginata Garrah) seedlings. Surface water ponding occurs in rehabilitated mines from autumn through to <b>spring,</b> and infected <b>collars</b> were commonly associated with ponding. This suggested that P. cinnamomi infects seedlings directly through periderm at the collar. The objective of this project was to ascertain whether infection by P. cinnamomi through periderm was possible, to study the disease in seedlings infected in this manner, and the methods by which P. cinnamomi circumvented the periderm to infect the seedlings. An inoculum receptacle was designed to simulate water ponding around the main stem of jarrah seedlings, and into which zoospores could be introduced. Under controlled glasshouse conditions in December (early summer) it was demonstrated that zoospores can infect through the stems of non-wounded and wounded jarrah seedlings. This was confirmed in a rehabilitated bauxite mine in May/June (late autumn/early winter), when ponding is most prevalent and sustained. In the field trial, P. cinnamomi was isolated from stems of non-wounded and wounded seedlings 3 weeks after inoculation. However, lesions did not develop in the non-wounded seedlings, or {{in most of the}} wounded seedlings. Another field trial examined the long-term prognosis for jarrah seedlings infected by zoospores at the collar. Within 3 - 6 months of either winter or spring inoculations, 7...|$|R
