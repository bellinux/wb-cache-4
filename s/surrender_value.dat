Since then, many companies have introduced either a second GUL policy that has a slightly higher premium, but in return the policy owner has cash <b>surrender</b> <b>values</b> that show a better internal rate of return on surrender than the additional premiums could earn in a risk-free investment outside of the policy.|$|R

50|$|His work in {{connexion}} with citizen defence was important, but {{his introduction}} of the non-forfeiture principle into life assurance policies was much more so. He had adapted the idea from somewhat similar principles {{that had been made}} law in the state of Massachusetts, United States of America, in 1861. Templeton, however, in 1869 introduced a clause in the policies of the newly formed National Mutual Life Association which provided that overdue premiums would automatically be advanced against the <b>surrender</b> <b>value</b> until the <b>surrender</b> <b>value</b> was exhausted. The principle was adopted by other companies, and has proved of the greatest benefit to an immense number of people.|$|E

50|$|Permanent life {{insurance}} is {{life insurance}} {{that covers the}} remaining lifetime of the insured. A permanent insurance policy accumulates a cash value up to its date of maturation.

Proper funding of a contract may reduce this risk, but it cannot be completely eliminated.|$|R
40|$|The Supreme Court of the United States, in {{the recent}} case of Cohen v. Samuels, 38 Sup. Ct. 36, has {{put an end to}} a method, {{approved}} by some of the lower Federal Courts, whereby a person could create a fund which would be completely under his control but which would nevertheless be protected against any claim on the part of his trustee in bankruptcy. The circumstances in the principal case were as follows: Samuels had taken out ordinary life insurance policies, with the usual provisions as to loan and <b>surrender</b> <b>values,</b> payable to certain of his relatives as beneficiaries, but 2 ̆ 7 with a provision reserving to Samuels the right to change the beneficiary without the latter 2 ̆ 7 s consent. At the time of Samuels 2 ̆ 7 bankruptcy these <b>surrender</b> <b>values</b> were about 1, 200, and if before that time Samuels had wished to realize on such <b>surrender</b> <b>values,</b> all that he need have done was to name himself as beneficiary and thus become entitled to the amount. He became bankrupt, and now insists that the policies do not pass to his trustee in bankruptcy as assets because, not being payable to himself, his estate, or personal representatives, they do not fall within the language of § 70, which defines what property shall pass to the trustee. And his claim was apparently so well fortified by authority that the District Court for the Southern District of New York felt impelled to uphold it, and was supported by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, where, however, HOUGH, C. J., registered a vigorous dissent...|$|R
40|$|Premiums and {{benefits}} associated with traditional life insurance contracts are usually specified as fixed amounts in policy conditions. However, reserve-dependent <b>surrender</b> <b>values</b> and reserve-dependent expenses are common in insurance practice. The famous Cantelli theorem in life insurance ensures that surrendering can be ignored in reserve calculations provided the surrender payment equals the accumulated reserve. In this paper, more complex reserve-dependent payment patterns are considered, in line with insurance practice. Explicit formulas are derived for the corresponding reserve...|$|R
5000|$|Unit-linked IPI [...] - [...] other IPI {{policies}} have no investment element and hence no <b>surrender</b> <b>value,</b> however a unit-linked policy has an investment element similar to unit-linked life assurance policies. Premiums will normally {{be more expensive}} than standard policies due to the investment element, and could be still more expensive if the return on the invested premiums is poor.|$|E
50|$|Traded {{endowment}} policies (TEPs) {{or second}} hand endowment policies (SHEPs) are traditional with-profits endowments {{that have been}} sold to a new owner part way through their term. The TEP market enables buyers (investors) to buy unwanted endowment policies for more than the <b>surrender</b> <b>value</b> offered by the insurance company. Investors will pay more than the <b>surrender</b> <b>value</b> because the policy has greater value if it is kept in force than if it is terminated early. When a policy is sold, all beneficial rights on the policy are transferred to the new owner. The new owner takes on responsibility for future premium payments and collects the maturity value when the policy matures or the death benefit when the original life assured dies. Policyholders who sell their policies, no longer benefit from the life cover and should consider whether to take out alternative cover.The TEP market deals exclusively with Traditional With Profits policies. The easiest way of determining whether an endowment policy is in this category is to check to see whether it mentions units, indicating it is a Unitised With Profits or Unit Linked policy, if bonuses are in sterling {{and there is no}} mention of units then it is probably a traditional With Profits. The other types of policies - “Unit Linked” and “Unitised With Profits” have a performance factor which is dependent directly on current investment market conditions. These are not tradable as the guarantees on the policy are much lower and there is no gap between the <b>surrender</b> <b>value</b> and the market value.|$|E
50|$|When {{it became}} {{apparent}} that many policies would not cover the cost of the mortgage loan, policy holders sought alternative methods to repay their mortgage and dispose of their endowment policies. Whilst initially, the only method was to surrender (cancel) the policy with the life assurance company themselves, obtaining the <b>surrender</b> <b>value</b> calculated by them, a second hand market slowly developed, providing policyholders with much added value over their surrender values.|$|E
50|$|All values {{related to}} the policy (death benefits, cash <b>surrender</b> <b>values,</b> premiums) are usually {{determined}} at policy issue, {{for the life of}} the contract, and usually cannot be altered after issue. This means that the insurance company assumes all risk of future performance versus the actuaries' estimates. If future claims are underestimated, the insurance company makes up the difference. On the other hand, if the actuaries' estimates on future death claims are high, the insurance company will retain the difference.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the problem of}} a lifelong health insurance cover where medical inflation is not sufficiently incorporated in the level premium determined at policy issue. We focus on the setting where changes in health benefits, driven by medical inflation, are accounted for by an appropriate update or indexation of the level premium, the policy value, or both premium and policy value, during the term of the contract. Such an updating mechanism is necessary to restore the actuarial equivalence between future health benefits and <b>surrender</b> <b>values</b> {{on the one hand}}, and available policy values and future premiums on the other hand. We extend existing literature (Vercruysse et al., 2013; Denuit et al., 2017) by developing updating mechanisms in a discrete-time framework, where medical inflation is only taken into account ex-post as it emerges over time and where <b>surrender</b> <b>values</b> are allowed for. We propose and design two types of surrender values: based on the ageing provision {{on the one hand and}} based directly on the premiums paid until surrender on the other hand. We illustrate our updating strategy with numerical examples, using Belgian data, and investigate the sensitivity of our findings with respect to elements from the technical basis (in particular: the lapse rates) used in the actuarial calculations. Our updating mechanism is generic and useful for a wide range of products in life and health insurance, where some elements of the technical basis are guaranteed while others are subject to revision according to policy conditions...|$|R
