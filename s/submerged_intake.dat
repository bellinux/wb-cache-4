40|$|Design {{constraints}} for air intakes of unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs) or manned combat aircrafts {{have been}} tightened and partially changed due to addional requirements {{in regard to}} infrared and radar signature. These requirements have a crucial impact on the aerodynamic shape of air intakes and their integration in aircraft systems. Especially, radar signature {{is the reason why}} submerged or partially <b>submerged</b> air <b>intakes</b> are preferred solutions for UCAVs. Moreover, in order to further reduce the radar signature and to avoid backscattering it is also necessary that air intake associated ram air channels have to be S-shaped. Unfortunately, those intake and channel designs reveal a severe impact on the aerodynamic properties, in particular, under transonic flight condition: Especially partially <b>submerged</b> air <b>intakes</b> are very sensitive to onflow conditions. For example, in dependence of the thickness of the boundary layer in front of the intake fluid with more or less momentum enters the air intake which, consequently, effects the total pressure recovery. In fact, a thicker boundary layer means less total pressure recovery. Consequently a partially <b>submerged</b> air <b>intake</b> and its integrated ram air S-duct together exhibit the disadvantage that in regard to the pressure distribution the inhomogenity of the onflowing air at the engine throat plane might be critical for the performance of the engine. Moreover, an intake and duct shape design, which might be beneficial for one flight condition, may not be robust enough for those varying flow conditions which have to be faced over a full mission. Experimental and numerical studies are necessary in order to clarify the essential dependencies between boundary layer thickness, the effect of shock boundary layer interaction and the required engine performance coe�cients. This study addresses these problems by comparing experimental and numerical results...|$|R
40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the performance of}} proposed <b>submerged</b> <b>intakes</b> in an early design phase, a performance analysis model able to evaluate a range of intake geometries is required. This document details how such a model was developed {{with the use of}} available sub-models for specific flow features. A formulation of the method of characteristics suitable for rotational  flow was used to compute the parts of the flow field not affected by viscous effects. Boundary layers, both laminar and turbulent, were implemented via integral integral relations that provide the growth of the boundary layer. The effects of shock waves interacting with the boundary layers, both in shock wave reflection on the intake walls and the pressure rise in the shock train, are implemented via experimentally obtained correlations.  To investigate the effects that several design variables have on the intake performance, a parametric study was performed with the intake analysis model. It confirmed the initial expectation that an increased expansion angle significantly decreases the total pressure recovery, a measure of efficiency, that is achieved by the intake. Using a gradual compression or multishock compression surface reduces the loss of total pressure due to shock waves. Performance could be further improved by performing further internal contraction via an improved cowl shape...|$|R

In addition, tests were conducted on the submerged inlet with revised entrance lips and deflectors to determine the configuration which {{would result in the}} best dynamic pressure recovery measured at the inlet for this installation without a major rework of the entrance. Stalling of the air flow over the inner lip surface created excessive dynamic pressure losses with the original entrance. The revised entrance produced a 12 -percent increase in dynamic pressure recovery at the design high-speed inlet-velocity ratio and resulted in an improvement of thte critical-speed characteristics of the entrance lip. A complete redesign of the entrance including a decrease in ramp angle and adjustment of lip camber is necessary to secure optimum results from this submerged duct installation...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{provides}} new guidance {{concerning the}} hydrodynamic loads on <b>submerged</b> <b>intake</b> structures located {{in shallow water}} under breaking and non-breaking waves. Results {{from a series of}} experiments conducted in a large wave flume at 1 : 15 scale to study the hydrodynamic forces exerted on a generic intake structure located on a sloping seabed in shallow water below breaking and non-breaking irregular waves are presented. Based on analysis of the experimental data, empirical relationships are developed to describe the peak loads in terms of characteristic wave parameters such as significant wave height and peak wave period. The distribution of the peak loads across different parts of the intake structure is also described. Drag and inertia force coefficients for the horizontal forcing on the intake structure and for the main structural sub-components are derived and presented. It is shown that the well-known Morison equation, with appropriate drag and inertia force coefficients, can provide reasonable estimates of the moderate horizontal loads, but the peak loads are less well predicted.

40|$|The design {{constraints}} for air intakes of unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs) or manned combat aircrafts {{have been}} tightened and partially {{changed over the}} last decade. New requirements in regard to infrared and radar signature have a crucial impact on the aerodynamic shape of air intakes and their integration in the aircraft system. Especially radar signature {{is the reason why}} <b>submerged</b> air <b>intakes</b> are preferred solutions, in fact backscattering is lowered. From the aerodynamic point of view partially <b>submerging</b> of air <b>intakes</b> can lead to short S-shaped ram air intake channels due to a limited integration space for engines and auxiliary systems. The benefit is a further reduction of radar signature, unfortunately, a short S-shape of the intake channel has a severe impact on the onflow conditions for the engine. A strong inhomogeneity in regard to vortices and related total pressure can be observed at the aerodynamic interface plane (AIP), the engine throat plane. Beside Dean-like vortices additional flow separation inside the S-duct might occur. These effects are enforced at transonic flow conditions, in particular shocks are changing the boundary layer thickness in front of the intake. Moreover, maneuvers can lead to the occurrence of additional leading edge vortices or to a strong displacement of existing vortices. All those can lead to a dramatically changed air intake in flow situation, under which flow separation in the S-duct change the pressure distribution at the engine throat plane {{in a way that the}} homogeneity will decrease the performance of the engine...|$|R
40|$|The {{interaction}} of periodic waves {{with a model}} offshore <b>submerged</b> water <b>intake</b> structure was examined experimentally and analytically. Two wave conditions, with long and short wavelengths relative to the structure?s characteristic length scale were tested. Flow kinematics were characterized using particle image velocimetry and the wave motion measured with capacitance wave gages. Pressure distributions at key locations around the model as well as inline and uplift forces were measured {{with an array of}} pressure sensors distributed around the model. The two types of waves tested simulated the maximum and minimum typical conditions estimated to be present on existing intake structures. Additionally, flow visualization was carried out for a solitary wave traveling over the structure to better characterize the processes that occur {{in the vicinity of the}} structure. A complete description of the flow kinematics is presented for the long wave case. The main vortex patterns are related to the wave motion induced inline and uplift forces. Large scale vorticity patterns generated on the weather and lee sides of the structure influence the loading of the structure, primarily the uplift force where large uplift coefficients were found. The dominant vorticity pattern, a vortex filament pair, was linked to the maximum uplift coefficient. The inline force coefficient found is similar to coefficients previously reported for cylindrical structures. The ratios of total vs two component turbulent kinetic energy were estimated. Results disagree with typical ratios found in other studies and generally used to estimate total kinetic energy when one component of velocity is missing. However, large turbulent kinetic energy uncertainty levels were found and caution is advised when using this information. An analytical model based on small amplitude wave theory and irrotational flow solved using a eigenfunction expansion method is presented. Results are compared with experimental values measured for a short wavelength case, conducted specifically to verify and validate the model. Horizontal and vertical velocities as well as inline and uplift force coefficients are in good agreement. Force coefficients were also compared with the long wavelength case results and similar maximum values were obtained. The model is capable of estimating wave scattering, flow kinematics, and wave induced loading on the structure in the diffraction range...|$|R
40|$|Results are {{presented}} following {{a series of}} experimental measurements on a <b>submerged</b> NACA type <b>intake</b> orientated between ± 30 degrees yaw to the free stream in an atmospheric boundary layer wind tunnel at a unit Reynolds number of nominally 1 x 106. The intake was subjected {{to a range of}} upstream wall boundary layer conditions and the intake mass flow (as measured by an orifice plate) was monitored to assess aerodynamic performance. The mass flow data is supported by qualitative flow visualisation within the duct, using a smoke filament illuminated in a laser light sheet in order to gain insight into the flow physics. Intake performance, expressed in terms of a non-dimensional flow momentum coefficient, is seen to degrade with both: (i) intake orientation to the free stream - changes of nominally 40 % are seen for the angle range tested and (ii) increase in upstream boundary layer displacement thickness - changes of nominally 30 % are seen for the range tested. This data is presented as a graphical carpet plot, it is intended that this be used as a guide to performance prediction in non-aeronautical applications where there are often significant changes in both local flow direction and boundary layer thickness. Flow visualisation studies show that the intake performance degradation with yaw angle can be attributed to a progressive change in the vortex- pair structure within the intake as the local flow angle is increased. An increase in both lateral separation and size of the respective vortex cores is considered to act so as to reduce the magnitude of the induced inflow into the intake...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{a series of}} laboratory experiments on frazil ice formation in {{a large body of}} water, and on subsequent frazil-ice congestion of a water intake located {{at the bottom of the}} water body. The experiments sought insights and data regarding flow-field influence on frazil ice formation and ingestion by such an intake. They were conducted using a refrigerated ice-tank at IIHR-Hydroscience and Engineering. The flow field around the bottom intake was monitored using particle image velocimetry. The tank approximately simulated the typical conditions for submerged intakes located in large water bodies. The conditions included wind-induced waves. The experiments are very unusual, insofar that they were conducted at such a large scale. Commensurately, they were not without their challenges; the major ones being to super-cool a large body of water, and to produce frazil ice in a controllable manner in that water. The super-cooled water body in the tank was 21 m long x 5 m wide x 0. 55 m deep (58 m 3 in volume). After some initial experimental difficulties, it was found that substantial quantities of frazil ice indeed could be formed in a sufficiently controllable and repeatable manner to facilitate experiments on the ingestion of frazil ice by a <b>submerged</b> <b>intake.</b> 1...|$|E
40|$|The Lower Yellowstone Irrigation District diverts up to 1400 cfs {{into its}} main canal {{system on the}} lower Yellowstone River in Northeastern Montana. In late 2010, {{as part of a}} pallid {{sturgeon}} recovery program, the USBR and USACE began construction of a new state-of-the-art screened canal head works structure. After over 100 years of unscreened operations, the new fish screened facility was opened in spring 2012. The head works will be integrated into a major river gradient fish passage facility being proposed for construction soon. When completed, the new passage and protection facilities will reduce fish entrainment and open an additional 165 miles of river habitat for the endangered and native fishes. The new headwork facility’s fish protection system consists of twelve, 6. 5 -foot diameter and 25 feet long cylindrical fish protection screens. Each screen is designed to seal over the <b>intake’s</b> <b>submerged</b> sluice gates spaced along the 350 -foot long riverbank facility. An integrated and flush-mounted track system was built into the vertical concrete walls to raise the screens in the non-irrigation season for protection from the significant ice and flood flows common on the river. When the 71 -mile long irrigation canal is operational, each screen is lowered into position and an automatic brush cleaning system is used to keep the 1. 75 mm wedge wire slots from clogging. The new intake facility was physically modeled at the USBR Hydraulics Lab along with several river fish passage options. The on-river screen design keeps the fish and debris in the river as opposed to traditional off-river screen designs with fish bypass facilities. The cylindrical design also reduced the facility footprint and allows diversions to occur over the river’s wide-ranging water surface fluctuations. This presentation will focus on the design, construction, and hydraulics of the intake screen facility, as well as the initial season’s operational experiences...|$|R
40|$|This {{report was}} funded by the U. S. Department of Energy's (DOE's) National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) Existing Plants Research Program, which has an energy-water {{research}} effort that focuses on water use at power plants. This study complements their overall research effort by evaluating water availability at power plants under drought conditions. While {{there are a number of}} competing demands on water uses, particularly during drought conditions, this report focuses solely on impacts to the U. S. steam electric power plant fleet. Included are both fossil-fuel and nuclear power plants. One plant examined also uses biomass as a fuel. The purpose of this project is to estimate the impact on generation capacity of a drop in water level at U. S. steam electric power plants due to climatic or other conditions. While, as indicated above, the temperature of the water can impact decisions to halt or curtail power plant operations, this report specifically examines impacts as a result of a drop in water levels below power plant <b>submerged</b> cooling water <b>intakes.</b> Impacts due to the combined effects of excessive temperatures of the returned cooling water and elevated temperatures of receiving waters (due to high ambient temperatures associated with drought) may be examined in a subsequent study. For this study, the sources of cooling water used by the U. S. steam electric power plant fleet were examined. This effort entailed development of a database of power plants and cooling water intake locations and depths for those plants that use surface water as a source of cooling water. Development of the database and its general characteristics are described in Chapter 2 of this report. Examination of the database gives an indication of how low water levels can drop before cooling water intakes cease to function. Water level drops are evaluated against a number of different power plant characteristics, such as the nature of the water source (river vs. lake or reservoir) and type of plant (nuclear vs. fossil fuel). This is accomplished in Chapter 3. In Chapter 4, the nature of any compacts or agreements that give priority to users (i. e., which users must stop withdrawing water first) is examined. This is examined on a regional or watershed basis, specifically for western water rights, and also as a function of federal and state water management programs. Chapter 5 presents the findings and conclusions of this study. In addition to the above, a related intent of this study is to conduct preliminary modeling of how lowered surface water levels could affect generating capacity and other factors at different regional power plants. If utility managers are forced to take some units out of service or reduce plant outputs, the fuel mix at the remaining plants and the resulting carbon dioxide emissions may change. Electricity costs and other factors may also be impacted. Argonne has conducted some modeling based on the information presented in the database described in Chapter 2 of this report. A separate report of the modeling effort has been prepared (Poch et al. 2009). In addition to the U. S. steam electric power plant fleet, this modeling also includes an evaluation of power production of hydroelectric facilities. The focus of this modeling is on those power plants located in the western United States...|$|R
