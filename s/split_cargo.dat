5000|$|.....the seceded South, {{even before}} the {{outbreak}} of hostilities, was faced with the necessity of securing the basic materials of war. It lacked guns, cannon, and munitions of every sort; it lacked most of the raw materials from which they could be manufactured. The South needed clothing, medicine, tools, and, later on, food. It lacked the factories, too, with which to manufacture the sinews of war, and the machinery and skilled labor with which to establish and run factories. As a result the Confederacy, at the very start, turned it eyes towards Europe." [...] William Diamond Just as the blockade had made export of Confederate goods prohibitive, so did it frustrate the importation of vital goods to the Confederate war-effort. Importers often had to use transshipment points, such as ports in the Caribbean, transferring and <b>splitting</b> <b>cargo</b> onto smaller ships for the final leg. Thus shipments became sporadic and delayed.|$|R

50|$|The two {{centrally}} located engines <b>split</b> the <b>cargo</b> compartment in two and, though rated as a 4-ton vehicle, this prevented large loads, such as heavy artillery or vehicles, from being carried. In addition, {{the driver had}} poor visibility as he was {{centrally located}} inside {{the middle of the}} vehicle. This was compounded by the installation of a canvas cover over the forward hold. As a result, another crew member typically had to stand behind the driver and provide directions.|$|R

50|$|Traditional working {{dinghies}} have a lee {{board that}} can be hooked over the side. This does not <b>split</b> the <b>cargo</b> space. A sailing rudder is usually tied or clipped to a simple pair of pintles (hinge pins) on the transom with the bottom pintle being longer so that the rudder can be mounted one pintle at a time. The rope keeps the rudder from floating off in a wave. Both rudders and lee boards have swiveling tips so the dinghy can be landed. Rudders are often arranged so the tiller folds against the rudder to make a compact package.|$|R

2500|$|The C-5C is a {{specially}} modified variant for transporting large cargo. Two C-5s (68-0213 and 68-0216) were modified {{to have a}} larger internal cargo capacity to accommodate large payloads, such as satellites. The major modifications were {{the removal of the}} rear passenger compartment floor, <b>splitting</b> the rear <b>cargo</b> door in the middle, and installing a new movable aft bulkhead further to the rear. [...] The official C-5 technical manual refers to the version as C-5A(SCM) Space Cargo Modified. Modifications also included adding a second inlet for ground power, which can feed any power-dependent equipment that may form part of the cargo. The two C-5Cs are operated by U.S. Air Force crews for DOD spacecraft programs and NASA, and are stationed at Travis AFB, California. Both 68-0213 and 68-0216 completed the Avionics Modernization Program by January 2007. 68-0213 is being upgraded in RERP to the C-5M (SCM) standard.|$|R
50|$|In 2006, Polaris Shipping Co Ltd, Seoul, {{purchased}} four single-hulled oil tankers, including Sunrise III, for {{conversion to}} very large ore carriers (VLOC) at Cosco (Zhoushan) Shipyard in China. At the time, {{this was a}} typical strategy to increase the lifetime of an otherwise obsolete vessel by another 10 to 14 years and, thanks to the high charter rates of large bulk carriers used to transport iron ore to China, the conversion would pay itself back in just one to two years. Typically, the center tanks of the oil tanker would be <b>split</b> into dry <b>cargo</b> holds while the side tanks {{would be used for}} ballast or remain empty. Holes cut on the main deck for cargo hatches and coamings would require additional structural strengthening to retain sufficient longitudinal strength after conversion. A tank top strengthened for high loading rate and grab unloading would be fitted above the bottom frames and girders. The vessel returned to service in 2008 as Stellar Daisy.|$|R
40|$|During the 90 -day study, {{support was}} {{provided}} to NASA in defining a point-of-departure space transfer vehicle (STV). The resulting STV concept was performance optimized with a two-stage LTV/LEV configuration. Appendix A reports on the effort {{during this period of}} the study. From the end of the 90 -day study until the March Interim Review, effort was placed on optimizing the two-stage vehicle approach identified in the 90 -day effort. After the March Interim Review, the effort was expanded to perform a full architectural trade study with the intent of developing a decision database to support STV system decisions in response to changing SEI infrastructure concepts. Several of the architecture trade studies were combined in a System Architecture Trade Study. In addition to this trade, system optimization/definition trades and analyses were completed and some special topics were addressed. Program- and system-level trade study and analyses methodologies and results are presented in this section. Trades and analyses covered in this section are: (1) a system architecture trade study; (2) evolution; (3) safety and abort considerations; (4) STV as a launch vehicle upper stage; and (5) optimum crew and <b>cargo</b> <b>split...</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{airplane}} {{developed a}} reputation of crashing early on in its life-cycle, crew members {{referred to it as}} a [...] "widowmaker". Some would not fly in the C-133, since early on the cause of the crashes were unknown and it seemed airplanes were just falling out of the sky. A series of issues were discovered after several crash investigations. The first issue discovered, was with the auto-pitch controller on the propeller. A time delay was added to relieve stress on the nose casing. The second issue discovered was stall characteristics gave very little warning to the crew. The left wing was found to stall before the right wing. The fix was simple, a small strip of metal was attached to the right wing causing it to stall {{at the same time the}} left wing would stall. As the aircraft neared the end of its 10,000 hour life-cycle, on February 6, 1970 the last C-133B crashed. It was determined the airframe <b>split</b> at the <b>cargo</b> door. The final fix was a band around the airframe to strengthen, but the end of the C-133 was near. The C-5A Galaxy would debut in 1971 and mark the end of the C-133. Of 50 aircraft built, nine were lost in crashes and one was destroyed in a ground fire.|$|R
40|$|The {{traditional}} {{air cargo}} supply chain is composed by the shippers, the freight forwarders and the airlines. The freight forwarders secure capacity with airlines {{in order to}} accommodate shippers' demand. They bid for capacity six to twelve months before the actual departure date of the aircraft, and confirm the needed capacity a few days before departure. We address the freight forwarders' problem of confirming needed capacity based on balancing the costs of ordering too much capacity versus ordering too little. We use a Markov decision process to model the problem. We show the value function is convex in the state variables for lead times of one and two periods. We present the structure of the optimal policy and show it is stationary. In addition we present solutions to the case with subcontracting options and order due dates. We also address the airlines' revenue management problem with respect to its cargo capacity available for free sale (after honoring committed capacity to freight forwarders), in particular the problems of (1) accepting/rejecting incoming bookings based on bid prices, and of (2) estimating the show-up rate (ratio of bookings handed in at departure over bookings on hand) with impact on overbooking. To address the lumpiness of demand, we <b>split</b> the <b>cargo</b> into two categories: small cargo, composed of mail and small packages, and large cargo, composed of the bulk of commercial cargo. The small cargo is approximated with the passenger arrival, and we propose a new algorithm to solve the traditional probabilistic nonlinear problem from the passenger side. The large cargo is solved using a dynamic program, which is decomposed at the leg level using a fare-prorating scheme. The solution from our new approach is shown via simulation to be superior to two approaches currently used: the first come first serve, and the deterministic linear program. The show-up rate is estimated using wavelets and we show that a discrete show-up rate is more suitable than the traditional Normal estimator used in practice. The new estimator results in considerable more potential revenue. Ph. D. Committee Chair: Dr. Ellis L.

30|$|It {{was found}} that the OR model of Osman et al. (1993) and Christiansen et al. (2007) holds {{characteristics}} close to the tramp shipping characteristics mentioned {{at the beginning of this}} section. The model of either research paper is based on a network of multiple cargo flows. Each network node either represents a load or a discharge event for each cargo. Ships compete in carrying cargoes by following selected arcs in the network, beginning with a start node and ending with an end node. If a network arc is used by a ship, this arc is restricted for use by other ships. An arc is used by a ship if lay can of each arc node can be met and load available in each arc node is within remaining ship capacity. The model assigns network arcs to ships in an attempt to maximise total voyage gross profit for all ships. Both models are nonlinear. Hemmati et al. (2014) and Christiansen and Fagerholt (2014) have presented better tramp shipping characteristics. The former have used a linear objective but used heuristic algorithms to solve their problem. The latter have presented some linear and non-linear models; some handle flexible cargo sizes of what is called ‘more or less owner’s option’, some handle <b>splitting</b> of <b>cargo</b> loads, and some others handle varying ship speed. Most of these models use heuristic algorithms to solve the problem of concern. Flexible <b>cargo</b> sizes, <b>splitting</b> of loads, and different ship speed, although they have been formulated within the models; they could have been handled via sensitivity and what-if analysis after solution. This might help other important shipping elements to be formulated as well. Sensitivity and what-if analysis are necessary validation tools in tramp shipping to handle possible changes in cargo quantity and freight rate, cargo handling rate and charges, and ship speed and fuel consumption. Instead of ship full loads assumed in Brown et al. (1987) and Laake and Zhang (2013), Vilhelmsen et al. (2015) have developed a linear model to handle the case where multiple cargoes can be carried simultaneously on board each ship. The review of the previous models is reported in the follows items. The first is that the model objective maximises voyage gross profit, while in tramp shipping the objective has to maximise gross profit per day. The second is that transport demand is assumed deterministic. In shipping, some cargoes may have random demand. The third is that the model with non-linear objective or/and constraints call for software solutions usually less reliable and inefficient. The fourth is that the authors brought no evidence on the possibility of solving large problems when more cargoes and ships are added.|$|R
