40|$|Background. The Marilao, Meycauayan and Obando river system (MMORS), in the Philippines {{is home to}} many {{precious}} metals refineries, where local artisanal gold smelting industries use silver to draw gold out of used jewelry. Copper recovers the silver. The copper-rich wastewater contributes to local pollution. Alternative methods for <b>silver</b> <b>recovery</b> include electrolytic recovery: removal of silver ions from solution, and conversion of the ions into metallic silver. Objectives. Explore operation and scale-up for the electrolytic recovery of silver for small-to-medium-scale used gold smelting plants. Methods. Effects of current and time were investigated in a laboratory scale, magnetically-stirred electrolysis reactor, using a sintered platinum anode and a stainless steel cathode. <b>Silver</b> <b>recovery</b> (the removal of silver ions from solution) was evaluated {{at different levels of}} constant operating current, and data was used to determine charge dose as the scale up and operating factor. Charge dose was then used to obtain the operating conditions on a pilot scale (100 L) system. A preliminary pilot test assessed <b>silver</b> <b>recovery</b> performance. Results. Higher silver removal rates were noted at higher operating currents. Electrodeposition at 9 amperes showed 98. 7 % <b>silver</b> <b>recovery</b> after 30 mins. The charge dose for silver electrodeposition was 1. 23 coulombs/mg silver ions removed, while the average electrolysis energy requirement was about 0. 59 kilowatt hours/kg of silver removed.

Sediment-hosted ore within a turbiditic sequence is strongly structural controlled. It is sheet-like with several elongated, subvertical massive zoned sulphide bodies with central pyrrhotitic cores surrounded by pyrite ore which is enclosed by semi-massive and breccia-stringer mineralisation. This study showed pronounced grain sizes, texture, mineral composition and trace element geochemistry heterogeneity. The pyrite-pyrrhotite-galena-sphalerite ore has minor marcasite, chalcopyrite and arsenopyrite and trace tetrahedrite (±freibergite), native silver and magnetite. Enrichment trends towards {{the surface and}} peripheral pyrite-dominated ore zones are in Ag, As, Tl, Hg, Sb, Sn, Mo and Au. The first Re-Os whole rock massive sulphide isochron age is 378 ± 15 Ma. Initial ϒOs of ~ 170 is either caused by juvenile continental crust of the Lachlan Fold Belt as metal source or by a contribution of primitive mantle Os. Zinc isotope compositions of sphalerite (δ⁶⁶ZnJMC 0. 220 - 0. 450 ‰) suggest effectively leached average continental crust as the source for metals, chlorite thermometry showed temperatures at 314 - 343 °C, high Cu concentrations coincide with light Zn isotopes that define two major zones of fluid influx and the isocon method showed host lithology replacement was negligible during ore genesis. Sulphides formed in sites of increased dilation and fracture-induced permeability during prolonged periods of fracturing and fluid pulses. Decreasing fluid pressure and adiabatic cooling initiated precipitation of sulphides. No evidence for fluid mixing was identified. Initially, lower parts of the orebody formed in dilational zones in sandstone-rich sequences along a transpressional fault corridor. Major fracturing then caused the formation of upper main lode and upgrading of the lower main lode ore zones. Changing fluid temperatures, internal refinement via dissolution-reprecipitation and temporal fluid composition change created vertical mineralogical and geochemical ore zonation. The orebody was modified during post-depositional compression during continued basin inversion resulting in sulphide remobilisation, upgrading and amplified ore zonation. Zinc and, in particular, Pb recovery rates significantly fluctuated since production began in 1983. Fluctuating recovery rates resulted from grain size variability and subsequent poor particle liberation during grinding. <b>Silver</b> <b>recoveries</b> rarely exceeded 50 %. Poor Ag recoveries were due to fine-grained argentian tetrahedrite, common associations with gangue phases and alteration of tetrahedrite. High concentrations of Bi were encountered recently in lead concentrate. A galenamatildite solid solution contains Bi (max. 5, 645 ppm). High Bi {{is limited to the}} lower most main lode ore zone. Geometallurgical ore characterisation via QEMSCAN® was undertaken to predict mineral processing characteristics of ore sourced from parts of the same stope. On the stope scale there are significant variations in flotation characteristics from different parts of the stope which enables prediction of recoveries, concentrate qualities and mill throughput. Theoretical recovery calculations suggest that ore from the western part will have 10 % lower recovery. Theoretical and long-term average recoveries are similar for Zn but not for Pb. Theoretical data may over- estimate recovery because sample preparation may liberate more particles than plant grinding. An overview of mineralogy and trace elements allows geometallurgical ore characterisation on the stope scale to better predict mill performance. Investigation of geometallurgical ore characteristics and penalty element concentrations are recommended on a stope-by-stope basis within life-of-mine planning. Thesis (Ph. D.)

Initially, the printed circuit board was comminuted in both knife and hammer mills. The comminuted material was characterized by sieve analysis, chemical analysis by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) and loss on ignition. Leaching tests were conducted in sulfuric acid, sulfuric acid in an oxidizing medium and nitric acid. The results indicated that the printed circuit board is mainly composed of copper (19. 42...|$|E
2500|$|In 1947, after Pakistan gained its {{independence}} from Britain, Lahore became the hub of cinema in Pakistan. Upon independence, there was a shortage of funds, filming equipment which initially paralysed the film industry. With hardships faced, the first Pakistani feature film, Teri Yaad released on 7 August 1948, premiering at the Parbhat Theatre in Lahore. Over the next few years, films that were released reached mediocre success until the release of Do Ansoo on 7 April 1950. Do Ansoo became the first film to attain a 25-week viewing making it the first film to reach <b>silver</b> jubilee status. <b>Recovery</b> was evident with Noor Jehan's directorial debut Chanwey releasing on 29 April 1951. The film became {{the first to be}} directed by a female director. Syed Faqir ahmad Shah produced his first production 1952. Though [...] "Jagga Daku" [...] Saqlain Rizvi was the director, the film could not get much appreciation due to violence shown in it. As cinema viewership increased, Sassi released on 3 June 1954 by Eveready Pictures reached golden jubilee status staying on screens for 50-weeks. Legendary playback singer Ahmed Rushdi started his career in April 1955 after singing his first song in Pakistan [...] "Bander Road Se Kemari".Umar Marvi released on 12 March 1956 became the first Pakistani film made in the Sindhi language. To celebrate the success of these endeavours, film journalist Ilyas Rashidi launched an annual awarding event on 17 July 1958. Named Nigar Awards, the event is since then considered Pakistan's premier awarding event celebrating outstanding performance in various categories of filmmaking.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} the time of anesthetic induction and <b>recovery</b> of <b>silver</b> catfish (Rhamdia quelen) exposed to eugenol. It was also determined the efficacy of the anesthetic as a stress reducing agent and performed a sensory analysis of the fillets from fish exposed to this substance. The silver catfish were exposed to air for 1 min to carry out biometry, and blood was collected at 0, 1 and 4 hours later. Eugenol can be used in the range of 20 - 50 mg L- 1 for anesthetic induction in <b>silver</b> catfish, and <b>recovery</b> time from anesthesia was not affected by eugenol concentration. The control group showed significantly higher cortisol levels 4 hours after biometry than at time zero. Fish anesthetized with eugenol (50 mg L- 1) presented significantly lower plasma cortisol levels than control fish at the same time. These data indicate that eugenol inhibits the rise of cortisol in the blood. The sensory analysis test demonstrated that eugenol modifies the flavor of the fillet and therefore is contra-indicated for anesthetization of silver catfish that are intended for human consumption. O objetivo deste estudo foi identificar o tempo de indução e recuperação anestésica de jundiás (Rhamdia quelen) expostos ao eugenol, bem como a eficácia desse anestésico na inibição do estresse e realizar análise sensorial dos filés dos peixes expostos a essa substância. Os jundiás foram expostos ao ar por um minuto para realização da biometria, e o sangue foi coletado zero, uma e quatro horas depois. O eugenol pode ser usado na faixa de 20 - 50 mg L- 1 para a indução da anestesia em jundiás, e o tempo de recuperação da anestesia não foi afetado pela concentração do eugenol. O grupo de controle mostrou níveis significativamente mais elevados do cortisol quatro horas após a biometria que no tempo zero. Os peixes anestesiados com eugenol (50 mg L- 1) apresentaram níveis significativamente mais baixos do cortisol plasmático do que peixes do grupo de controle do mesmo tempo. Esses dados indicam que o eugenol inibe o aumento do cortisol no sangue. O teste sensorial demonstrou que o eugenol modifica o sabor dos filés e consequentemente é contra-indicado para a anestesia do jundiá quando o filé for destinado ao consumo humano...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{bioleaching}} of a concentrate {{produced from}} a black shale ore in an industrial operation in Poland was assessed. Following preliminary batch culture tests, processing in continuous conditions was tested to determine the main specifications {{for the application of}} the stirred-tank technology to this organic-rich polymetallic concentrate. The experimental work was carried out in a laboratory-scale unit consisting of three stirred tanks (50 L or 20 L) using an acidophilic and moderate thermophilic (42 °C) bacterial population. Different configurations of the unit and key operating parameters were tested (nutrient medium composition, solids concentration, agitation and aeration rates). The analysis of both bacterial community structure and mineralogical characteristics of the concentrate and the bioleach residues were implemented in order to better understand the chemical and biochemical reactions occurring in the system. Using the data produced during the continuous operation, downstream processing assessment for both copper and <b>silver</b> <b>recovery</b> was also carried out. The best copper recovery obtained in the continuous operation was 92 % and hot brine leaching of the bioleaching residue (PLINT Process) permitted the recovery of 92 % of the silver. Copper and silver recoveries seemed to be limited by incomplete chalcopyrite dissolution. A preliminary techno-economical evaluation of the concentrate bioleach processing, including bioleaching and copper and silver recoveries, demonstrated the potential economical feasibility. <b>Silver</b> <b>recovery</b> {{plays an important role in}} the process's finances. This study presents promising results that encourage further investigation of bioleach processing...|$|E
