5|$|By 2011 <b>Snapdragon</b> was {{embedded}} in Hewlett Packard's WebOS devices {{and had a}} 50% market share of a $7.9 billion smartphone processor market. By 2012, the <b>Snapdragon</b> S4 (Krait core) had taken a dominant share from other Android system-on-chips like Nvidia Tegra and Texas Instruments OMAP which caused the latter to exit the market. As of July 2014, the market share of Android phones had grown to 84.6 percent, and Qualcomm's <b>Snapdragon</b> chips powered 41% of smartphones. By 2015, <b>Snapdragon</b> was used in most non-Apple smartphones. However, the September 2013 debut of Apple's 64-bit A7 chip in the iPhone 5S forced Qualcomm to rush out a competing 64-bit solution, despite the capable performance of the <b>Snapdragon</b> 800/801/805, since their existing Krait cores were only 32-bit. The first 64-bit SoCs, the <b>Snapdragon</b> 808 and 810, were rushed to market using generic Cortex-A57 and Cortex-A53 cores and suffered from overheating problems and throttling, particularly the 810, which led to Samsung ditching <b>Snapdragon</b> for its Galaxy S6 flagship phone.|$|E
5|$|The {{entry-level}} 200 {{series was}} expanded with six new processors using 28 nanometer manufacturing and dual or quad-core options in June 2013. The <b>Snapdragon</b> 805 was released that November. The 410, which {{is intended for}} low-cost phones in developing nations, was announced the following month. In January 2014, Qualcomm introduced {{a modified version of}} the <b>Snapdragon</b> 600 called 602A that is intended for in-car infotainment screens, backup cameras, and other driver assistance products. The quad-core <b>Snapdragon</b> 610 and eight-core 615 were announced in February 2014. The <b>Snapdragon</b> 808 and 810 were announced in April 2014. The newest iteration in <b>Snapdragon</b> 800 series is <b>Snapdragon</b> 835, which is the first Qualcomm SOC that is built on a 10nm architecture. As of October 2016, the <b>Snapdragon</b> 835 contained the fastest processor in the <b>Snapdragon</b> line.|$|E
5|$|Adoption of <b>Snapdragon</b> {{contributed to}} Qualcomm's {{transition}} from a wireless modem company to one that also produces {{a wider range of}} hardware and software for mobile devices. In July 2011 Qualcomm acquired certain assets from GestureTek in order to incorporate its gesture recognition intellectual property into <b>Snapdragon</b> SoCs. In mid-2012 Qualcomm announced the <b>Snapdragon</b> software development kit (SDK) for Android devices at the Uplinq developer conference. The SDK includes tools for facial recognition, gesture recognition, noise cancellation and audio recording. That November Qualcomm acquired some assets from EPOS Development in order to integrate its stylus and gesture recognition technology into <b>Snapdragon</b> products. It also collaborated with Microsoft to optimize Windows Phone 8 for <b>Snapdragon</b> semiconductors.|$|E

It featured a 1.2GHz processor and had lower power consumption than prior models.|$|E
5|$|In November 2008, Qualcomm {{announced}} it would also compete against Intel in the netbook processor market with dual-core <b>Snapdragon</b> system-on-chips planned for late 2009. It demonstrated a <b>Snapdragon</b> processor that consumed less power than Intel chips announced {{around the same time}} and claimed it would also cost less when released. That same month, Qualcomm introduced a Snapdragon-based prototype netbook called Kayak that used 1.5GHz processors and was intended for developing markets.|$|E
5|$|<b>Snapdragon</b> is a {{suite of}} {{system on a chip}} (SoC) {{semiconductor}} products designed and marketed by Qualcomm for mobile devices. The <b>Snapdragon</b> central processing unit (CPU) uses the ARM RISC instruction set, and a single SoC may include multiple CPU cores, a graphics processing unit (GPU), a wireless modem, and other software and hardware to support a smartphone's global positioning system (GPS), camera, gesture recognition and video. <b>Snapdragon</b> semiconductors are embedded in devices of various systems, including Android and Windows Phone devices.

5|$|On December 7, 2016, Microsoft {{announced}} that {{as part of}} a partnership with Qualcomm, it planned to support the PC version of Windows 10 on Qualcomm <b>Snapdragon</b> systems-on-chip in 2017, beginning with a focus on laptops. Unlike Windows RT, these devices will support the use of an x86 processor emulator to support Win32 desktop applications, along with universal apps. On May 2, 2017, Microsoft unveiled Windows 10 S, an edition of Windows 10 designed for low-end mobile devices targeting the education market (which have led critics to compare the product line to Chrome OS). Similarly to Windows RT, it restricts software installation to applications obtained via Windows Store, but it may be upgraded to Windows 10 Pro for a fee to remove these restrictions.|$|E
5|$|The SIII {{comes in}} two {{distinct}} variations that differ {{primarily in the}} internal hardware. The international SIII version has Samsung's Exynos 4 Quad {{system on a chip}} (SoC) containing a 1.4GHz quad-core ARM Cortex-A9 central processing unit (CPU) and an ARM Mali-400 MP graphics processing unit (GPU). According to Samsung, the Exynos 4 Quad doubles the performance of the Exynos 4 Dual used on the SII, while using 20percent less power. Samsung had also released several 4G LTE versions—4G facilitates higher-speed mobile connection compared to 3G—in selected countries to exploit the corresponding communications infrastructures that exist in those markets. Most of these versions use Qualcomm's <b>Snapdragon</b> S4 SoC featuring a dual-core 1.5GHz Krait CPU and an Adreno 225 GPU. The South Korean and Australian versions are a hybrid of the international and 4G-capable versions.|$|E
5|$|The device {{incorporates}} a 1.7GHz quad-core <b>Snapdragon</b> 600, an ARMv7 SoC, with 2GB of RAM. The chip provides support for LTE networks {{where they are}} available. Most HTC One models come with either 32 or 64 GB of internal, non-expandable storage—unlike the international model, the Chinese and Japanese models include a microSD slot and a removable back cover. Its internal components are arranged in a pyramid-like layout similar to the HTC Butterfly and HTC Windows Phone 8X with larger components (such as the screen and battery) positioned towards the front and smaller components (such as the motherboard) positioned towards the back. This internal layout also allows the device to have a curved backing.|$|E

50|$|<b>Snapdragons</b> {{are often}} {{considered}} as cold-season annual plants and do best in full or partial sun, in well drained soil (although they do require regular watering). They are classified commercially as {{a range of}} heights: midget (6-8 inches), medium (15-30 inches) and tall (30-48 inches).|$|R
