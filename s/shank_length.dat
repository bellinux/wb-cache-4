50|$|A thread shank {{is created}} by loosely {{stitching}} a shankless button onto fabric. This is usually done by keeping a toothpick or other small object in between the button and fabric while the button is stitched on. Once the button has been sewn through a few times, the toothpick is removed and the needle is moved down {{through one of the}} buttonholes, placing the needle and its thread in between the button and fabric. The sewer takes care to not tighten the thread too much. While holding the button away from the garment, the thread is then firmly wrapped around the button (in between the button and fabric) a few times to form a sturdy wrapper for the other threads. The needle is then pushed through the fabric to the underside of the garment, where it can then be securely fastened off. A thread <b>shank's</b> <b>length</b> depends on the thickness of the fabric that will be buttoned. The ideal thread shank is long enough to button the fabric and still have the garment draping nicely, but short enough that the button does not flop around when buttoned.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{influence}} of the dwarfing gene, dw, on growth and reproduction was deter-mined by comparing 1) pure line and reciprocal cross dwarf and normal layers and 2) dwarf and normal full-sib sisters. In Experiment 1, two lines of chickens, the Oregon State University ran-dombred dwarf Leghorn population (D) and Shaver Starcross " 288 " Leghorns (S), were mated within line and reciprocally to produce normal-sized (SS, SD) and dwarf (DS, DD) female progeny. All progeny were reared similarly until 18 weeks of age when birds were transferred to indivi-dual cages. At 18 weeks of age, half the pullets were fed a basal laying ration containing 15 % protein while the remaining birds received the basal ration with. 1 % supplemental methionine. In Experiment 2, full-sib normal and dwarf sisters were obtained by mating hemizygous dwarf females to heterozygous males. Layers were reared {{in a similar manner}} to those in Experiment 1 with the exception that all layers received the basal ration with. 1 % methionine supplemented. Methionine supplementation in Experiment 1 significantly increased egg weights at 35 and 62 weeks of age for all lines and crosses but had no effect on other growth and reproductive traits. Genotype X diet interactions were not observed for any of the measured traits. Normal-sized layers had significantly heavier body weights and longer <b>shank</b> <b>lengths</b> than dwarf layers in both ex-periments. Dwarf hens in both experiments showed reduced egg production capabilities, although ages at sexual maturity were similar among phenotypes. Dwarf layers laid smaller eggs than nor-mal-sized layers.

40|$|ABSTRACT Hens in {{this study}} were {{produced}} from random breeding within lines (high, low, and control) of dwarf White Leghorns that had been divergently selected for four generations for 20 -week body weight. Birds were weighed at 10 weeks of age and placed in individual cages at 18 weeks of age. Body weights, <b>shank</b> <b>lengths,</b> and egg weights were obtained at sexual maturity (day of first egg) and at 4, 8, 12, and 16 weeks after sexual maturity. Egg production was recorded during 28 -day periods. Thirty hens/line were sampled at sexual maturity and at the above times after sexual maturity for body composition (percent fat, protein, moisture, and ash). High line hens showed increased percent body fat and reduced percent protein and moisture compared to low and control hens. Coefficients of determination (R 2) for age at sexual maturity and body weight were small (R 2 <. 20) for high and control hens. There were no meaningful relationships between body weight or other physical measurements and sexual maturity in low hens. There were no significant relationships between body composition and age at sexual maturity in high and control hens. There was a strong cubic association (R 2 =. 73; P<. 001) between percent ash and age at sexual maturity in low hens, although the biological importance of this relationship was uncertain. Coefficients of determination between body weight and performance efficiency (egg mass per body weight) were small to moderate (R 2 =. 04 to. 46) for high and control hens. The relationship of body weight to efficiency was nonsignificant for low hens, even though these birds were most efficient. The effects of body composition on performance efficiency were related to composition changes associated with selection for body weight.

AA (amino acid) sequence analysis revealed that the Myoz 3 gene encodes a 26 [*]kDa protein which have 97 % identities with that of turkey. Expression profiling showed that Myoz 3 mRNA is mainly expressed in leg muscle and breast muscle. Furthermore, we investigated Myoz 3 gene polymorphisms in two broiler breeds, the Yellow Bantam (YB) and the Avian. Five SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) were identified in the YB breed and 3 were identified in the Avian breed.

The current study was designed to investigate the effects of TGF-β genes on chicken growth and body composition traits. The Iowa Growth and Composition Resource Population was established by crossing broiler sires with dams from two unrelated highly inbred lines (Leghorn and Fayoumi). The F 1 birds were intercrossed, within dam line, to produce two related F 2 populations. Body weight and body composition traits were measured in the F 2 population. Primers for TGF-β 2, TGF-β 3, and TGF-β 4 were designed from database chicken sequence. Polymorphisms between parental lines were detected by DNA sequencing, and PCR-RFLP methods were then developed to screen the F 2 population. The TGF-β 2 polymorphisms between broiler and Leghorn and the TGF-β 4 polymorphism between broiler and Fayoumi were associated with traits of skeletal integrity, such as tibia length, bone mineral content, bone mineral density, and the percentage of each measure to BW.

The study involved both qualitative and quantitative methods to gather the data. The questionnaire was used for survey while phenotypic characteristics and egg production forms were used to collect the actual data. The findings revealed that farmers {{in the study area}} regarded chicken production as their primary source of domestic animal protein, with the domestic fowl being the most widely kept poultry species. Other uses are participation in socio-cultural ceremonies, selling for money and gifts. The average number of eggs per clutch ranged from 10 to 15. The hatchability ranged between 50 % and 60 %). Phenotypic characteristics measures revealed the absence of pure white plumage colour that can be associated with the introduction of White Leghorn to the flock. Generally, normal feather cover was the main feather morphology of local chicken populations in north central Namibia. However, features like crested heads, naked necked, frizzling, and feathered shanks occurred sporadically among local chickens in the study area. Fifty-seven percentages of chickens in the surveyed region had single comb, while 29. 6 % and 13. 8 % had rose and pea combs respectively. The most frequent shank colour was black followed by yellow, whitish, orange, and reddish shank. The wing span had positive correlation with body weight and chest circumference at (r = 0. 994). Other researchers discover the strong correlation of chest circumference with <b>length</b> <b>shank</b> at (r = 0. 827).
