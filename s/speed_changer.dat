5000|$|First V-M {{designed}} a two <b>speed</b> <b>changer</b> after Columbia Records introduced the LP in 1948. V-M then added the 45rpm speed after RCA brought that innovation to market in 1949. Finally V-M added the fourth speed (16⅔ rpm) for [...] "talking books" [...] in 1954. The changer mechanism, {{used throughout the}} fifties, sixties, and the seventies was developed in 1950. The basic design was retained until record changer production was terminated. The changer mechanism, responsible for operating the tone arm and the dropping of the records, was updated throughout the years to keep V-M's record changers competitive with their competitors, as technology advanced. The speed control mechanism was, however, completely redesigned in 1961. V-M Corporation claimed that their record changers were jam proof. These V-M record changers had a reputation of being both well built and reliable. These mass-produced record changers, while competitive with other manufactures mass-produced record changers, i.e. BSR and Garrard, in both build quality and product specifications, were not competitive with professional record changers. Like other mass-produced record changers, the tone arms had heavier vertical tracking force (VTF), poorer speed accuracy, and poorer rumble specification than the professional record changers. V-M mass-produced record changers, like their competitors mass-produced record changers, were used in low to medium priced audio equipment-compact stereo systems, console stereos, and portable stereo systems. They were sold also as separate components. Most had ceramic cartridges and diamond styluses (needles), with a separate stylus for 78rpm records. Most had two pole synchronous motors. V-M developed their first professional record changer in 1966. This record changer had a twenty-four pole synchronous motor, and a separate motor for operating the tone arm and lowering the record to the turntable. This professional record changer was only a two speed unit-it did not play 78rpm records. This professional record changer was marketed under the Voice of Music trademark, and also sold to other manufactures such as Sherwood, Philco Ford and Westinghouse. V-M's second generation professional record changers design was developed in 1971, and was sold to BIC. V-M's deteriorating financial condition did not permit V-M to market this design under the Voice of Music trade mark.|$|E
40|$|The bicycle is {{constantly}} being updated {{in order to}} meet market needs, the developing trend of bicycle shifting gear has changed from manual shifting fashion into automatic shift fashion. In this paper, a systematic approach is proposed to synthesize the design concept of the three-speed automatic <b>speed</b> <b>changer.</b> In this paper, we accord to the design concepts of planetary gear trains with two degrees of freedom, which are proposed by Hong-Sen Yan and Long-Chang Hsieh. By applying the TRIZ creative design method to centrifugal clutch, one-way clutch, and brake, 10 kinds of creative design concepts of three-speed automatic <b>speed</b> <b>changer</b> was created. The results not only can serve as a teaching tool for creative design courses, but also can provide as a reference to industrial circles for development of the three-speed automatic <b>speed</b> <b>changer</b> of bicycle, electric motorcycle, and electric scooter...|$|E
50|$|Before {{electric}} motors were invented, mechanical <b>speed</b> <b>changers</b> {{were used to}} control the mechanical power provided by water wheels and steam engines. When {{electric motors}} came into use, means of controlling their speed were developed almost immediately. Today, various types of mechanical drives, hydraulic drives and electric drives compete {{with one another in}} the industrial drives market.|$|R
40|$|The use of {{continuously}} variable transmission systems in many different areas such as aerospace, robotics, machinery and automotive industries {{as an alternative to}} conventional <b>speed</b> <b>changers</b> with constant ratio becomes widely. Especially in the automotive industry, these systems have been used increasingly, since they enable that internal combustion engines in vehicles run at optimal speeds, and consequently provide considerable fuel savings and therefore lower emission values and also they provide powerful acceleration and quiet working. CVT systems have several constructive variants such as belted, chained, balled, toroidal etc. In this paper, toroidal CVT systems based on elastohydrodynamic principles are concerned with, and fundamental works of last two decades in this field are reviewed. However, the relevant terminology and dynamics along with the control of these systems are briefly treated for better understanding of the literature mentioned. Attention is drawn to the lack of some significant issues in present research works, and potential future works are pointed out. This paper, to the authors’ knowledge, will be the first review on toroidal CVT systems in Turkish literatur...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MCom (Economics)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2013. Economic and {{environmental}} objectives are traditionally seen as mutually exclusive, especially {{in terms of}} higher economic growth rates that are coupled with higher greenhouse gas emissions. The first aim {{of this study is to}} find a possible creative solution, in which higher economic growth can be coupled with lower greenhouse gas emissions, also known as low-carbon growth. The literature review shows that the economic growth aspect of low-carbon growth can be achieved by increasing exports. The other part of low-carbon growth, namely lower greenhouse gas intensity, can be achieved by diffusing low-carbon technologies (or environmental goods). The World Trade Organisation also encouraged the liberalisation of environmental goods. Therefore, low-carbon growth could be achieved by promoting the production and exports of low-carbon environmental goods. Although the World Trade Organisations has encouraged the liberation of environmental goods, there is no official list of environmental goods. Therefore, the second aim of this study is to derive a list of low-carbon environmental goods from existing lists of environmental goods. Thirty-nine lowcarbon environmental goods are identified for the purpose of this study. The Decision Support Model (DSM) is used to identify realistic export opportunities for these environmental goods. These low-carbon environmental goods were ranked based on three criteria: i) their potential environmental benefits, ii) South Africa’s capacity to produce these goods, and iii) their potential economic benefits. The five low-carbon environmental goods that ranked the highest are photosensitive semiconductors (HS- 6 : 854140), towers and lattice masts (HS- 6 : 730820), electrical control and distribution boards smaller than 1 kV (HS- 6 : 853710), gearing, ball screws, <b>speed</b> <b>changers,</b> torque converter (HS- 6 : 848340), and static converters (HS- 6 : 850440). The exact environmental uses, producers, intensive and extensive export opportunities of the top five goods were discussed. The best overall intensive export opportunities according to potential export value are HS- 6 : 854140; photosensitive semiconductors (USD 922, 362, 000) to Germany and HS- 6 : 853710; electrical control and distribution boards smaller than 1 kV, to the United States (USD 838, 671, 000). The best overall extensive export opportunities according to their potential export value are HS- 6 : 854140; photosensitive semiconductors to China (USD 953, 255, 000) and HS- 6 : 854140; photosensitive semiconductors to Hong Kong (USD 363, 505, 000). The results of this study will enable policy-makers to make optimal decisions regarding which environmental goods to produce and export. Master...|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to interconnecting the supergrid system, the West Burton 400 kV substation also feeds {{into the local}} 132 kV network. This connection is made via two 240 MVA, 400/132 kV auto-transformers manufactured by Associated Electrical Industries. The windings consists of a tertiary winding, a common, a tapping and a series winding. They are arranged so that the helical single layer tertiary winding is nearest the core, the continuous disc common winding next, followed by the interleaved full-length helical type tapping winding and the multi-layer type series winding and line shield. A continuously transposed conductor was used to minimise eddy current losses and reduce the space requirement of the windings. High <b>speed</b> resistor tap <b>changers</b> are provided on the 132 kV side of each transformer, giving a tapping range of plus 15% to minus 5%. The tapping winding has 7 taps which {{in conjunction with a}} buck/boost switch provide fourteen steps. The fixed contacts of each of the two rotary tap selector units associated with each phase are connected to one half of the tappings from the windings while the moving contacts are connected to the diverter switches. The diverter switch assembly, together with the transition resistors and operating mechanism is mounted on top of the 132 kV bushing which forms {{an integral part of the}} tap changer. Erection of the transformer was carried out inside a translucent plastic dome, inflated by a small blower. This allowed the work to continue regardless of the weather and thus reduced the time normally taken for erecting large transformers in the open. By working day and night within the plastic dome the time for erection on site was reduced from an estimated 8 weeks to 3 weeks. Completely assembled, each transformer is 14.94 m (49 ft) long, 10.06 m (33 ft) wide, and weighs 325.1 tonnes (320 tons) made up of 154.4 tonnes (152 tons) of steel, 30.48 tonnes (30 tons) of copper, and 19.3 tonnes (19 tons) of insulation and 98,420 litres (26,000 gallons) of oil. The current line entries for the 132 kV switch house are North Greetwell - Lincoln 1, Retford - Worksop - Checkerhouse 2, North Greetwell - Lincoln 2 and Retford - Worksop - Checkerhouse 1 ...|$|R
