5|$|After the referendum, Lukashenko {{convened a}} new {{parliamentary}} assembly from those {{members of the}} parliament who were loyal to him. After between ten and twelve deputies withdrew their signature from the impeachment petition, only about forty deputies of the old parliament were left and the Supreme Soviet was dismissed by Lukashenko. Nevertheless, international organizations and many Western countries do not recognize the current parliament given {{the way it was}} formed. At the start of 1998, the Central Bank of Russia <b>suspended</b> <b>trading</b> in the Belarusian ruble, which led to a collapse {{in the value of the}} currency. Lukashenko responded by taking control of the National Bank of the Republic of Belarus, sacking the entire bank leadership and blaming the West for the free fall of the currency.|$|E
5|$|Grant's {{second term}} saw renewed {{economic}} turmoil. In September 1873, Jay Cooke & Company, a New York brokerage house, collapsed after {{it failed to}} sell all of the bonds issued by Jay Cooke's Northern Pacific Railway. The collapse rippled through Wall Street, and other banks and brokerages that owned railroad stocks and bonds were also ruined. On September 20, the New York Stock Exchange <b>suspended</b> <b>trading</b> for ten days. Grant, who knew little about finance, traveled to New York to consult leading businessmen and bankers for {{advice on how to}} resolve the crisis, which became known as the Panic of 1873. Grant believed that, as {{with the collapse of the}} Gold Ring in 1869, the panic was merely an economic fluctuation that affected bankers and brokers. He instructed the Treasury to buy $10 million in government bonds, injecting cash into the system. The purchases curbed the panic on Wall Street but an industrial depression, later called the Long Depression, nonetheless swept the nation. Many of the nation's railroads—89 out of 364—went bankrupt.|$|E

25|$|On 10 September 2001, {{in desperation}} Air New Zealand offered to sell Ansett to Qantas for $1. After two days' {{consideration}} Qantas declined, and Air New Zealand <b>suspended</b> <b>trading</b> in its shares (which had already dropped enormously) and placed Ansett in voluntary administration. Ansett was bankrupt, and Air New Zealand was in barely better shape. The following day Air New Zealand announced a staggering NZ$1,425 million loss: a NZ$1,321 million write-off of Ansett, and another NZ$104 million lost by Air New Zealand itself.|$|E
25|$|On 26 January, Egypt's EGX {{stock market}} index fell on {{speculation}} the instability would spread. The EGX30 has dropped almost 1,000 points since 13 January 2011. EGX dropped 6.1 percent on 26 January, and then another 6.2 percent on 27 January, before {{the chief of the}} stock market temporarily <b>suspended</b> <b>trading</b> due to marked losses in the first minutes of the opening session. The stock index closed the day down by 10.5 percent. On the first trading day in the week following the expansion of protests the EGX again fell.|$|E
25|$|On 29 June, club {{president}} Carson Yeung {{was arrested}} in Hong Kong on charges of money laundering, relating to a period before his involvement with the club. He was bailed to re-appear in August, his assets were frozen, and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange <b>suspended</b> <b>trading</b> of shares in the club's holding company, Birmingham International Holdings (BIHL), in which Yeung was the single largest shareholder with around 26%. BIHL appointed acting chairman Peter Pannu and Yeung's 18-year-old son Ryan {{to the board of}} the football club, and Michael Wiseman stepped down from the board, ending an 83-year formal association between the club and the Wiseman family. Although it appeared that HSBC, the club's bankers, were unlikely to call in a loan secured on the St Andrew's site, as such a course of action would make it difficult for the club to continue, thus reducing the likelihood of HSBC recovering their money, Yeung's situation impeded the search for new investment. Such a combination of factors, added to the reduced income to be expected following relegation, left the club in financial difficulty and ready to off-load high-earning players, particularly in light of the Football League's adoption of UEFA's financial fair-play regulations relating to clubs not spending in excess of their revenue.|$|E

40|$|Fair value {{accounting}} forces {{institutions to}} revalue their inventory whenever a new transaction price is observed. An institution facing a balance sheet constraint can have incentives to <b>suspend</b> <b>trading</b> in opaque over-the-counter markets to obstruct further price discovery. This way the asset’s book valuation {{can be kept}} artificially high, thereby relaxing the institution’s balance sheet constraint. But, the institution loses direct control of its asset holdings, leading to possible excessive risk exposure. An institution optimally balances this tradeoff when choosing the point beyond which it <b>suspends</b> <b>trading.</b> Outside investors, {{who do not know}} at what price the asset would trade, reduce their valuation the longer the asset has not traded. Their expected discount from book value is convex in time since last trade and robust to parameter misspecifications...|$|R
