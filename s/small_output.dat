25|$|A high {{proportional}} gain {{results in}} a large change in the output for a given change in the error. If the proportional gain is too high, the system can become unstable (see the section on loop tuning). In contrast, a small gain {{results in a}} <b>small</b> <b>output</b> response to a large input error, and a less responsive or less sensitive controller. If the proportional gain is too low, the control action may be too small when responding to system disturbances. Tuning theory and industrial practice indicate that the proportional term should contribute {{the bulk of the}} output change.|$|E
25|$|Modern {{image intensifiers}} no longer use a {{separate}} fluorescent screen. Instead, a caesium iodide phosphor is deposited {{directly on the}} photocathode of the intensifier tube. On a typical general purpose system, the output image is approximately 105 times brighter than the input image. This brightness gain comprises a flux gain (amplification of photon number) and minification gain (concentration of photons from a large input screen onto a <b>small</b> <b>output</b> screen) each of approximately 100. This level of gain is sufficient that quantum noise, due to {{the limited number of}} X-ray photons, is a significant factor limiting image quality.|$|E
25|$|Camel milk {{cannot be}} made into butter by the {{traditional}} churning method. It can be made if it is soured first, churned, and a clarifying agent is then added. Until recently, camel milk could not {{be made into}} camel cheese because rennet was unable to coagulate the milk proteins to allow the collection of curds. Developing less wasteful uses of the milk, the FAO commissioned Professor J.P. Ramet of the École Nationale Supérieure d'Agronomie et des Industries Alimentaires, {{who was able to}} produce curdling by the addition of calcium phosphate and vegetable rennet. The cheese produced from this process has low levels of cholesterol and is easy to digest, even for the lactose intolerant. The sale of camel cheese is limited owing to the <b>small</b> <b>output</b> of the few dairies producing camel cheese and the absence of camel cheese in local (West African) markets. Cheese imports from countries that traditionally breed camels are difficult to obtain due to restrictions on dairy imports from these regions.|$|E

2500|$|Byrd's staunch {{adherence}} to Catholicism {{did not prevent}} him from contributing memorably to the repertory of Anglican church music. Byrd's <b>small</b> <b>output</b> of church anthems ranges in style from relatively sober early examples (O Lord, make thy servant Elizabeth our queen (a6) and How long shall mine enemies (a5) [...] ) to other, evidently late works such as Sing joyfully (a6) which is close in style to the English motets of Byrd's 1611 set, discussed below. Byrd {{also played a role}} in the emergence of the new verse anthem, which seems to have evolved in part from the practice of adding vocal refrains to consort songs. Byrd's four Anglican service settings range in style from the unpretentious Short Service, already discussed, to the magnificent so-called Great Service, a grandiose work which continues a tradition of opulent settings by Richard Farrant, William Mundy and Robert Parsons. Byrd's setting is on a massive scale, requiring five-part Decani and Cantoris groupings in antiphony, block homophony and five, six and eight-part counterpoint with verse (solo) sections for added variety. This service setting, which includes an organ part, must have been sung by the Chapel Royal Choir on major liturgical occasions in the early seventeenth century, though its limited circulation suggests that many other cathedral choirs must have found it beyond them. Nevertheless, the source material shows that it was sung in York Minster as well as Durham, Worcester and Cambridge, in the early seventeenth century.. The Great Service was in existence by 1606 (the last copying date entered in the [...] so-called Baldwin Commonplace Book) and may date back as far as the 1590s. Kerry McCarthy has pointed out that the York Minster manuscript of the Great Service was copied by a vicar-choral named John Todd, apparently between 1597–99, and is described as 'Mr Byrd's new sute of service for means'. [...] This suggests the possibility that the work may have been Byrd's next compositional project after the three Mass settings.|$|E

30|$|The {{yields of}} maize and {{groundnut}} are {{significantly associated with}} higher probability of participating in both markets, {{which is consistent with}} expectation, since higher yields are more likely to ensure marketable surplus. For an additional kilogramme yield of maize and groundnut, the probability of market participation increases by 0.1 and 1.3  %, respectively. This finding underscores the importance of increased yield in enhancing the chances of smallholder farmers stepping out of poverty and improving their livelihood through enhanced income from their increased participation in the market. With respect to choice of market, yields of maize and groundnut positively influence the probability of selling at market centres. For every kilogramme yield of maize and groundnut, the probability of selling at market centre increases by 0.03 and 0.1  %, respectively. It is expected that the transaction costs involved in selling larger outputs from larger yields in markets are relatively less than <b>smaller</b> <b>outputs.</b> That is, it is relatively cost-effective to sell <b>smaller</b> <b>outputs</b> at farmgate than at market centre. This finding is consistent with studies (for example, Fafchamps and Hill 2005; Muamba 2011) that use quantity sold in the second stage.|$|R
