5|$|Baleen whales, {{primarily}} juveniles and calves, are preyed on by killer whales. It {{is thought}} that annual whale migration occurs to protect the calves from the killer whales. There have also been reports of a pod of killer whales attacking and killing an adult bowhead whale, by holding down its flippers, covering the blowhole, and ramming and biting until death. Generally, a mother and calf pair, {{when faced with the}} threat of a killer whale pod, will either fight or flee. Fleeing only occurs in species that can swim away quickly, the rorquals. Slower whales must fight the pod alone or with a small family group. There has been one report of a shark attacking and killing a whale calf. This occurred in 2014 during the sardine run when a <b>shiver</b> of dusky sharks attacked a humpback whale calf. Usually, the only shark that will attack a whale is the cookie cutter shark, which leaves a small, non-fatal bite mark.|$|E

40|$|Cold {{exposure}} may {{decrease the}} efficiency of voluntary mo-tor activity due to a decrease of muscular temperature, and to involvement of the motor system in thermoregulatory motor behaviour and <b>shivering</b> thermogenesis. Traditionally, <b>shivering</b> thermogenesis is believed to comprise two pat-terns – 1) thermoregulatory muscle tone (or preshivering tone) and 2) cold <b>shivering</b> itself (Burton, Bronk, 1937).

40|$|Introduction: <b>Shivering</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{complications}} of neuraxial blockade. Some patients find <b>shivering</b> sensation worse than surgical pain. Therefore, both prevention and treatment of established <b>shivering</b> should be regarded as clinically relevant intervention in the perioperative period. The aim of our study is to compare the efficacy of magnesium sulfate when used for prevention or treatment of <b>shivering</b> following spinal anesthesia. Methods: In this prospective, double blind, placebo controlled study, 120 ASA I, II patients undergoing surgery under spinal anesthesia were randomized into 3 groups. Following intrathecal injection, Group P (prophylactic) was given MgSO 4, 50  mg/kg I. V. bolus +  2  mg/kg/h infusion. Group T (therapeutic) was given MgSO 4 50  mg/kg I. V. bolus as a therapy when <b>shivering</b> occurred. If <b>shivering</b> persisted, they received 25  mg/kg I. V. bolus. Group C (control) received saline at identical times. Meperidine was given as rescue if <b>shivering</b> persisted. <b>Shivering</b> grade 3 / 4 was regarded as significant. Core temperatures, incidence of <b>shivering,</b> and side effects were recorded. Main results: Total incidence of <b>shivering,</b> grade 3 / 4, was 15 % in Group P, 45 % in Group T, and 50 % in Group C (p <  0. 01). Magnesium sulfate significantly reduced the incidence and gain of <b>shivering.</b> The use of rescue meperidine was more in Group P (20 %) and Group C (50 %) compared to none in Group T (p <  0. 05, p <  0. 01, respectively). Significant reduction in core temperature occurred in the Mg groups compared to the control group p <  0. 05. No correlation was found between patients who <b>shivered</b> and core temperature or ΔT. Hypotension was more frequent in Group P; nausea and vomiting were more in Mg groups than control group p <  0. 05.

40|$|Postanesthesia <b>shivering</b> {{was first}} {{described}} over fifty years ago.

40|$|Background: Postoperative <b>shivering</b> is {{a common}} event of unknown {{etiology}} with an incidence of 5 - 65 %. This study intended to compare the efficacy of tramadol with that of pethidine in controlling postanesthetic <b>shivering.</b> Methods: This double-blind clinical trial was performed on 300 consecutive patients underwent general anesthesia for elective cataract surgery. Intravenous tramadol 1 mg/kg or pethidine 0. 5 mg/kg was administered for alternate subjects who developed postanesthetic <b>shivering.</b> They were monitored in the recovery room for 1 hour and the cessation time of <b>shivering,</b> recurrence of the event, duration of recovery, respiratory depression, nausea, vomiting, and arterial O 2 saturation were recorded. Results: One hundred and twenty patients (40 %) had postanesthetic <b>shivering.</b> In the tramadol group, <b>shivering</b> terminated within 8 minutes after injection (mean 5 min). They had not recurrence of <b>shivering,</b> respiratory depression, reduction in SpO 2 and nausea or vomiting during recovery. In the pethidine group, <b>shivering</b> terminated within 13 minutes (mean 9 min) after injection, but in 10 patients it recurred after 30 minutes. In this group 28 patients had respiratory depression, reduction in SpO 2, nausea and vomiting {{but none of them}} needed any medication. Conclusion: Tramadol is superior to pethidine as it induced a faster termination of postanesthetic <b>shivering</b> and did not entail adverse effects on the respiratory system and SpO 2, recurrence of <b>shivering</b> or nausea and vomiting. Easy availability and minimum monitoring requirements are other advantages of tramadol.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Although {{meperidine}} is {{an effective}} treatment of postanesthetic <b>shivering,</b> its mechanism of action remains unknown. Investigation of other drugs might help clarify the mechanisms by which <b>shivering</b> can be controlled. Accordingly, we investigated the efficacy of clonidine, an alpha 2 -adrenergic agonist, and ketanserin, a 5 -hydroxytryptamine antagonist, in treating postanesthetic <b>shivering.</b> METHODS: First, 54 patients <b>shivering</b> after general anesthesia were allocated randomly to receive an intravenous bolus of saline, 150 micrograms clonidine, or 10 mg ketanserin. A second study explored the dose-dependence of clonidine. Forty <b>shivering</b> patients were given saline or clonidine, 37. 5, 75, or 150 micrograms. RESULTS: The duration of <b>shivering</b> was significantly shorter in those given clonidine (2. 1 +/- 0. 9 min) than {{in the other two}} groups and shorter in the ketanserin group (4. 3 +/- 0. 9 min) than in the saline group (12. 0 +/- 1. 6 min). Clonidine and ketanserin significantly decreased systolic arterial blood pressure when compared to saline. Core rewarming was significantly slower in the clonidine group. In the second study, 37. 5 micrograms clonidine was no more effective than saline. Two minutes after treatment, 150 micrograms obliterated <b>shivering</b> in all patients. Five minutes after treatment, all patients given 75 micrograms had stopped <b>shivering.</b> Systolic arterial pressure and heart rate decreased significantly in patients given 75 and 150 micrograms clonidine. CONCLUSIONS: Clonidine (150 micrograms) and ketanserin (10 mg) both are effective treatment for postanesthetic <b>shivering.</b> The effect of clonidine on <b>shivering</b> is dose-dependent: whereas 37. 5 micrograms had no effect, 75 micrograms clonidine stopped <b>shivering</b> within 5 min.

40|$|Cold-induced <b>shivering</b> is {{characterized}} by two distinct muscle contraction patterns: continuous low-intensity <b>shivering</b> [at ∼ 1 to 5 % of maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) ] and bursts of high-intensity <b>shivering</b> (at 10 to 35 % MVC) (Meigal, 2002, Haman et al., 2004). In this context, Haman et al. (2004) showed that carbohydrate (CHO) oxidation rate {{is directly related to}} burst <b>shivering</b> rate which increases the proportional recruitment of glycolitic type II fibers. Because most of these studies have been carried out in men, little is still know on the effects of hormonal fluctuations during the menstrual cycle on the dual <b>shivering</b> pattern and energy metabolism in women. Therefore, {{the purpose of this study}} was to quantify differences in muscle recruitment pattern and fuel selection in two phases of the menstrual cycle. Muscle recruitment in eight muscles and whole body fuel selection were monitored in women exposed to 120 min of cold exposure (5 °C liquid-perfusion suit) during FP and LP. Results show that there is no difference in the onset of <b>shivering,</b> <b>shivering</b> intensity, burst duration and burst <b>shivering</b> rate between LP and FP during steady state <b>shivering</b> (in last 15 min). Similarly, during steady state <b>shivering</b> (T= 105 - 120 min), absolute rates and relative contributions of metabolic fuels to total heat production did not differ between FP and LP. We conclude that hormonal fluctuations during the menstrual cycle do not affect muscle recruitment patterns or substrate utilization in the cold. Whether this important difference in fuel selection modifies muscle <b>shivering</b> activity and/or confers a survival advantage remains to be established...|$|R
40|$|History and Objectives: Postoperative <b>shivering</b> is {{a common}} {{complication}} in patients under anesthesia {{and because of the}} importance of its etiology and the controversies on the relationship between core body temperature and <b>shivering,</b> this study was carried out on referrals of Sina hospital in Tehran in 1997. Materials and Methods: Case-control strategy of this study was performed on 60 patients divided into <b>shivering</b> and non-shivering groups. Postoperative tremor with tonic pattern and having a 4 to 8 cycle/min waxing-and-waning component was considered as <b>shivering.</b> Core body temperature was estimated by a nasopharyngeal probe in both groups and they were compared using t-test. The means were reported as Mean±SD. Results: This research was carried out on 90 patients, i. e., 30 patients for case group (<b>Shivering)</b> and 30 patients for control group (Non-shivering). Both groups were similar regarding age, gender and temperature of operation room. Core body temperature in non-shivering group was 36. 11 ± 0. 33 and in <b>shivering</b> group was 35. 32 ± 0. 61 (P< 0. 001). Meanwhile, prevalence of <b>shivering</b> was 36. 7 percent.
