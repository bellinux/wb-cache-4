5|$|In 1639 William Keith, 7th Earl Marischal, {{came out}} {{in support of the}} Covenanters, a Presbyterian {{movement}} who opposed the established Episcopal Church and the changes which Charles I was attempting to impose. With James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose, he marched against the Catholic James Gordon, 2nd Viscount Aboyne, Earl of Huntly, and defeated an attempt by the Royalists to seize Stonehaven. However, when Montrose changed <b>sides</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Royalists and marched north, Marischal remained in Dunnottar, even when given command of the area by Parliament, and even when Montrose burned Stonehaven.|$|E
5|$|T. m. propinquus breeds from {{southeast}} British Columbia, southern Alberta, southwest Saskatchewan {{south to}} southern California and northern Baja California. It winters {{throughout much of}} the southern breeding range and south to Baja California. It is the same size as or slightly larger than nominate T. m. migratorius, but paler and tinged more heavily brownish-gray. It has very little white on the tip of the outermost tail feather. Some birds, probably females, lack almost any red below. Males are usually darker and may show pale or whitish <b>sides</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> head.|$|E
5|$|The {{group had}} {{originally}} {{wanted to call}} the album Abracadabra, until they discovered that another band had already used it. When discussing possible alternatives, during their German tour, Lennon opted for Four <b>Sides</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Circle in response to McCartney's Magic Circle, and Starr jokingly suggested After Geography, a play on {{the title of the}} Rolling Stones' recently released Aftermath LP. Other suggestions included Bubble and Squeak, Beatles on Safari and Pendulum before the band settled on Revolver. They confirmed their choice in a telegram to EMI, sent from the Tokyo Hilton on 2 July.|$|E

5|$|Mari Kiviniemi {{was elected}} {{the new leader}} of the Centre Party in its conference in Lahti on 12 June. The support for the Centre Party has been {{significantly}} higher in northern Finland than elsewhere: in the 2007 election the party received over 43% of the votes in both Oulu and Lapland electoral districts, compared with its nationwide support of 23.1%, while in 2003 the party's vote share in the two northernmost districts was even higher) As the top spots of the party leadership went to members from southern Finland, many of their supporters {{in the northern part}} of the country felt disenchanted; one local party chief even warned that many northern Centre Party supporters might switch <b>sides</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> True Finns.|$|E

5|$|These various micro-climates are {{influenced}} by the magical phenomenon known as Mist, an unstable substance with the ability to cause great variation over small areas. Due to the influence of Mist, several areas of Ivalice are 'jagd', areas in which Mist-laden winds and magicite-rich soil interfere with airship mechanisms. As such, jagds tend to be harsh, lawless frontiers, uncontrolled by any nation. Physically, the peninsula area resembles Europe in the east, with the landmasses of Valendia, Ordalia and Kerwon surrounding a central body of water (the Naldoan Sea) on three <b>sides.</b> <b>To</b> <b>the</b> west, Valendia and Kerwon curve away from Ordalia, creating the Galtean Peninsula.|$|E
5|$|While Aldimir was {{nominally}} {{loyal to}} Theodore Svetoslav, {{the presence of}} Smiltsena and Ivan at his court would have been seen by the Bulgarian emperor as a threat. In addition, Aldimir perhaps harboured a desire to accede to the throne himself. After Theodore Svetoslav's victory over Byzantium at Skafida in 1304, the Byzantines approached Aldimir with a proposal for an anti-Bulgarian alliance. Aldimir initially remained adamant and was hostile to the Byzantine forces which entered his domain in 1305. However, {{by the end of}} that year Aldimir had switched <b>sides</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Byzantines, as Theodore Svetoslav took back the fortresses that he had granted to Aldimir. Shortly thereafter, Theodore Svetoslav restored his direct power over Kran by reconquering and annexing the appanage.|$|E
5|$|On 12 October, for {{the third}} time, Farnese {{supplied}} the garrison of Zutphen, personally, {{as he had done}} the first time. Later on, he sent Verdugo back to Friesland and left Johann Baptista von Taxis in charge of Zutphen. After that, the Spanish army took its winter quarters. When Farnese moved to Brussels to spend the winter there, the Earl of Leicester continued the siege of Zutphen. He was not able to take the town, but succeeded in occupying several forts beyond the IJssel, including Zutphen's sconce, which was carried by surprise by Edward Stanley, brother of William Stanley, and 12 other soldiers. Shortly after the English and Dutch also took their winter quarters. Sir William Stanley was given the command of Deventer, Sir John Burroughs of Doesburg, and Rowland York of Zutphen's sconce. Stanley and York's appointments were met with suspicion by the Dutch States, because Stanley was openly Catholic and York a man of dissolute character. Leicester expressed his full confidence in both soldiers, but in 1587 Stanley and York shifted <b>sides</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Spanish party and handed Deventer and Zutphen's sconce over to Taxis.|$|E
30|$|In {{order to}} examine whether a {{charging}} effect of capacitance exists during the measurement, the J-V curve has been measured by scanning the voltage either from <b>the</b> lower voltage <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> higher one, or from <b>the</b> higher voltage <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lower one, or to and fro repeatedly. They all remained the same. Hence, no charging effect exists.|$|R

25|$|Social {{systems have}} {{patterns}} of social relation that change over time; {{the changing nature}} of space and time determines the interaction of social relations and therefore structure. Hitherto, social structures or models were either taken to be beyond the realm of human control—the positivistic approach—or posit that action creates them—the interpretivist approach. The duality of structure emphasizes that they are different <b>sides</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> same central question of how social order is created.|$|E
