40|$|Rapid Product Development (RPD) is a {{holistic}} concept for an evolutionary product development based on short iteration cycles. The employment of self-organizing teams {{as well as}} a target-oriented use of prototypes is of high relevance. As a consequence of the circular character of the stages of the Development process the involved teams are highly networked. Therefore, a significant need for coordination of distributed teams is arises, to ensure a target-oriented communication and coordination of those teams with regard to the development process as a whole. Distributed development teams could only be coordinated, if they have access to all relevant information and their changes which arise during all iterative cycles of the product development process. Two mechanisms are the basic principles, which support the coordination. Firstly, all pieces of information have to be saved in a database, in which the <b>semantic</b> <b>coherences</b> of information could be mapped, too. Secondly, the information and their changes must be accessible for each team on an individual basis regarding a further processing. Based {{on the state of the}} art only agent based technologies seem to be appropriate to fit the requirements of the coordination of distributed development teams. The coherences of agents which are used in the Rapid Product Development are exemplarily clarified at the temporal planning of activities and resources for distributed development teams...|$|R

40|$|Conventional {{approaches}} to automatic image annotation usually suffer from two problems: (1) They cannot guarantee a good <b>semantic</b> <b>coherence</b> of the annotated words for each image, as they treat each word independently without considering the inherent <b>semantic</b> <b>coherence</b> among the words; (2) They heavily rely on visual similarity for judging semantic similarity. To address the above issues, we propose {{a novel approach}} to image annotation which simultaneously learns a semantic distance by capturing the prior annotation knowledge and propagates the annotation of an image as a whole entity. Specifically, a semantic distance function (SDF) is learned for each semantic cluster to measure the semantic similarity based on relative comparison relations of prior annotations. To annotate a new image, the training images in each cluster are ranked according to their SDF values {{with respect to this}} image and their corresponding annotations are then propagated to this image as a whole entity to ensure <b>semantic</b> <b>coherence.</b> We evaluate the innovative SDF-based approach on Corel images compared with Support Vector Machine-based approach. The experiments show that SDF-based approach outperforms in terms of <b>semantic</b> <b>coherence,</b> especially when each training image is associated with multiple words. 1...|$|E

40|$|The {{state-of-the-art}} in {{semantic segmentation}} is currently represented by fully convolutional networks (FCNs). However, FCNs use large receptive fields and many pooling layers, {{both of which}} cause blurring and low spatial resolution in the deep layers. As a result FCNs tend to produce segmentations that are poorly localized around object boundaries. Prior work has attempted {{to address this issue}} in post-processing steps, for example using a color-based CRF on top of the FCN predictions. However, these approaches require additional parameters and low-level features that are difficult to tune and integrate into the original network architecture. Additionally, most CRFs use color-based pixel affinities, which are not well suited for semantic segmentation and lead to spatially disjoint predictions. To overcome these problems, we introduce a Boundary Neural Field (BNF), which is a global energy model integrating FCN predictions with boundary cues. The boundary information is used to enhance <b>semantic</b> segment <b>coherence</b> and to improve object localization. Specifically, we first show that the convolutional filters of semantic FCNs provide good features for boundary detection. We then employ the predicted boundaries to define pairwise potentials in our energy. Finally, we show that our energy decomposes semantic segmentation into multiple binary problems, which can be relaxed for efficient global optimization.

40|$|Referential {{ambiguity}} arises whenever readers or listeners {{are unable}} to select a unique referent for a linguistic expression out of multiple candidates. In the current article, we review a series of neurocognitive experiments from our laboratory that examine the neural correlates of referential ambiguity, and that employ the brain signature of referential ambiguity to derive functional properties of the language comprehension system. The results of our experiments converge to show that referential ambiguity resolution involves making an inference to evaluate the referential candidates. These inferences only take place when both referential candidates are, at least initially, equally plausible antecedents. Whether comprehenders make these anaphoric inferences is strongly context dependent and co-determined by characteristics of the reader. In addition, readers appear to disregard referential ambiguity when the competing candidates are each semantically incoherent, suggesting that, under certain circumstances, semantic analysis can proceed even when referential analysis has not yielded a unique antecedent. Finally, results from a functional neuroimaging study suggest that whereas the neural systems that deal with referential ambiguity partially overlap with those that deal with referential failure, they show an inverse coupling with the neural systems associated with semantic processing, possibly reflecting the relative contributions of semantic and episodic processing to re-establish <b>semantic</b> and referential <b>coherence,</b> respectively...|$|R

In order to do that, we will recall the conditions of its progression along the linear axis, where the reader establishes semantic, syntactic, thematic, logical and argumentative connections between words and propositions that follow each other; and the conditions of its organic composition, which allows the reader to incorporate the words, phrases and paragraphs so constituted into a global structure (sequences, parts of the text, its general structure) as a function of textual models he or she may have experienced. But we insist upon the fact that, in order for these two types of organisation - linear sequence and hierarchical inclusion - to constitute a text, it is necessary for them to be inscribed in an enunciative context and a communicative project that give the text its origin, its finality, and its function. In view of the development of the use of New Information and Communication Technologies, we will ask ourselves to what extent these new supports, in terms of their nature as well as their modes of functionality, require or lead toward new linguistic and cognitive strategies for treatment of text, especially in learners, children and/or non-native speakers, and how these learners can perceive and construct the local and global <b>coherence</b> (<b>semantic,</b> logical, argumentative [...] .) of a document presented in a hypertextual form. © John Benjamins Publishing Company...|$|R
