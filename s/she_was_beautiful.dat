25|$|In August 1694, {{he married}} the {{daughter}} of a joiner, Marie Elizabeth Huyard. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>beautiful</b> but had no fortune, and Lesage had little practice. About this time he encountered an old schoolfellow, the dramatist Antoine Danchet, who is said to have advised him to take up literature. He began as a translator, and published in 1695 a French version of the Epistles of Aristaenetus, which was not successful. Shortly afterwards he found a valuable patron and adviser in the Abbé de Lyonne, who bestowed on him an annuity of 600 livres, and recommended him to exchange the classics for Spanish literature, of which he was himself a student and collector. Spanish literature was once very popular in France when the queens of the house of Austria sat upon the throne, but had become neglected by Lesage's time.|$|E

Arrangements were made for the two to be married in Arras, but on the first meeting Charles felt [...] "happiness and love enter his heart, for he saw that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>beautiful</b> and young, and thus he greatly desired to gaze at her and possess her". She did not yet speak French and may not have reflected the idealized beauty of the period, perhaps inheriting her mother's dark Italian features, then unfashionable, but Charles most certainly approved of her because the couple were married three days later. Froissart documented the royal wedding, joking about the lascivious guests at the feast and the [...] "hot young couple".|$|E

500|$|Aaliyah {{was viewed}} by others {{as a role}} model. Emil Wilbekin, {{described}} by CNN as [...] "a friend of Aaliyah's" [...] and follower of her career, explained: [...] "Aaliyah is an excellent role model, because she started her career {{in the public eye}} at age 15 with a gold album entitled Age Ain't Nothing but a Number. And then her second album, One in a Million went double platinum. She had the leading role in Romeo Must Die, which was a box office success. She's won numerous awards, several MTV music video awards, and aside from her professional successes, many of her lyrics are very inspirational and uplifting. She also carried herself in a very professional manner. She was well spoken. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>beautiful,</b> but she didn't use her beauty to sell her music. She used her talent. Many young hip-hop fans greatly admire her." ...|$|E
500|$|Off screen, Hepburn {{lived in}} a manner ahead of her time; she thus came to symbolize the [...] "modern woman" [...] and {{played a part in}} {{changing}} attitudes towards the gender. Horton and Simmons write, [...] "Confident, intelligent and witty, four-time Oscar winner Katharine Hepburn defied convention throughout her professional and personal life ... Hepburn provided an image of an assertive woman whom [...] could watch and learn from." [...] After Hepburn's death, film historian Jeanine Basinger stated, [...] "What she brought us was a new kind of heroine—modern and independent. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>beautiful,</b> but she did not rely on that." [...] Mary McNamara, an entertainment journalist and reviewer for the Los Angeles Times wrote, [...] "More than a movie star, Katharine Hepburn was the patron saint of the independent American female." [...] She was not universally revered by feminists, however, who were angered by her public declarations that women [...] "cannot have it all," [...] meaning a family and a career.|$|E
500|$|Nadezhda {{became a}} musical {{as well as}} {{domestic}} partner with her husband, much as Clara Schumann had been with her own husband Robert. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>beautiful,</b> capable, strong-willed, and far better trained musically than her husband {{at the time they}} married—she had attended the Saint Petersburg Conservatory in the mid-1860s, studying piano with Anton Gerke (one of whose private students was Mussorgsky) and music theory with Nikolai Zaremba, who also taught Tchaikovsky. Nadezhda proved a fine and most demanding critic of her husband's work; her influence over him in musical matters was strong enough for Balakirev and Stasov to wonder whether she was leading him astray from their musical preferences. Musicologist Lyle Neff wrote that while Nadezhda gave up her own compositional career when she married Rimsky-Korsakov, she [...] "had a considerable influence on the creation of [...] first three operas. She travelled with her husband, attended rehearsals and arranged compositions by him and others" [...] for piano four hands, which she played with her husband. [...] "Her last years were dedicated to issuing her husband's posthumous literary and musical legacy, maintaining standards for performance of his works... and preparing material for a museum in his name." ...|$|E

[...] The accident is also {{referred to in the}} 1998 film One of Them. In Money, Love: A Novel by Brad Barkley, the character Roman organizes a show of Celebrity Death Cars, including that of Dean and Mansfield, to win back his love interest Gladys. In the song Movie Star by the rock band Cracker sang, [...] "Well the movie star, well she crashed her car, but everyone said <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>beautiful</b> even without her head, everyone said she was dangerous", making an allusion to the accident.

Rumours had it, some people at the Bolshoi decided to settle some old scores this way, now that Stalin, her much-feared patron, was now dead, {{and the name of}} Vera Davydova, another famous Soviet soprano, has been mentioned in this context. Lyudmila Maksakova refused to believe this, remembering the times when Davydova, who lived in a neighbouring dacha, helped her mother in difficult times. Davydova herself remembered her great rival with warmth. [...] "Maria Petrovna paid great attention to the way she looked. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>beautiful</b> and had excellent figure.

2500|$|Porter {{maintained}} a luxury apartment in Paris, where he entertained lavishly. His parties were extravagant and scandalous, with [...] "much gay and bisexual activity, Italian nobility, cross-dressing, international musicians {{and a large}} surplus of recreational drugs". In 1918, he met Linda Lee Thomas, a rich, Louisville, Kentucky-born divorcée eight years his senior. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>beautiful</b> and well-connected socially; the couple shared mutual interests, including a love of travel, and she became Porter's confidant and companion. The couple married the following year. She was in no doubt about Porter's homosexuality, but it was mutually advantageous for them to marry. For Linda, it offered continued social status and a partner who was the antithesis of her abusive first husband. For Porter, it brought a respectable heterosexual front {{in an era when}} homosexuality was not publicly acknowledged. They were, moreover, genuinely devoted to each other and remained married from December 19, 1919, until her death in 1954. Linda remained protective of her social position, and believing that classical music might be a more prestigious outlet than Broadway for her husband's talents, she tried to use her connections to find him suitable teachers, including Igor Stravinsky, but was unsuccessful. Finally, Porter enrolled at the Schola Cantorum in Paris where he studied orchestration and counterpoint with Vincent d'Indy. Meanwhile, Porter's first big hit was the song [...] "Old-Fashioned Garden" [...] from the revue Hitchy-Koo in 1919. In 1920, he contributed the music of several songs to the musical A Night Out.|$|E
