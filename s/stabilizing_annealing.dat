40|$|Significant {{structural}} steels for nuclear power engineering are chromium-nickel austenitic stainless steels. The presented paper evaluates the kinetics of the fatigue crack growth of AISI 304 L and AISI 316 L stainless steels in air and in corrosive environments of 3. 5 % aqueous NaCl solution after {{the application of}} solution annealing, <b>stabilizing</b> <b>annealing,</b> and sensitization annealing. Comparisons were made between the fatigue crack growth rate after each heat treatment regime, and a comparison between the fatigue crack growth rate in both types of steels was made. For individual heat treatment regimes, {{the possibility of the}} development of intergranular corrosion was also considered. Evaluations resulted in very favourable corrosion fatigue characteristics of the 316 L steel. After application of solution and <b>stabilizing</b> <b>annealing</b> at a comparable ∆K level, the fatigue crack growth rate was about one half compared to 304 L steel. After sensitization annealing of 316 L steel, compared to <b>stabilizing</b> <b>annealing,</b> the increase of crack growth rate during corrosion fatigue was slightly higher. The obtained results complement the existing standardized data on unconventional characteristics of 304 L and 316 L austenitic stainless steels...|$|E
40|$|Chromosomal translocations are {{frequently}} observed in cells exposed to agents that cause DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), such as ionizing radiation and chemotherapeutic drugs, {{and are often}} associated with tumors in mammals. Recently, translocation formation in the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, {{has been found to}} occur at high frequencies following the creation of multiple DSBs adjacent to repetitive sequences on non-homologous chromosomes. The genetic control of translocation formation and the chromosome complements of the clones that contain translocations suggest that translocation formation occurs by single-strand annealing (SSA). Among the factors important for translocation formation by SSA is the central mismatch repair (MMR) and homologous recombination (HR) factor, Msh 2. Here we describe the effects of several msh 2 missense mutations on translocation formation that suggest that Msh 2 has separable functions in <b>stabilizing</b> <b>annealed</b> single strands, and removing non-homologous sequences from their ends. Additionally, interactions between the msh 2 alleles and a null allele of RAD 1, which encodes a subunit of a nuclease critical for the removal of non-homologous tails suggest that Msh 2 blocks an alternative mechanism for removing these sequences. These results suggest that Msh 2 plays multiple roles in the formation of chromosomal translocations following acute levels of DNA damage...|$|R

Our results show that these impurities never have an associated O 2 vacancy in a nearest neighbour position. We also confirmed the existence of a disorder-order transformation of the anion lattice of calcia <b>stabilized</b> zirconia under <b>annealing.</b> Such a transformation cannot be observed in Yttria stabilized zirconia...|$|R
40|$|Single {{crystals}} {{of a new}} iron-based superconductor Ba 2 Ti 2 Fe 2 As 4 O {{have been}} grown successfully via a Ba 2 As 3 -flux method in a sealed evacuated quartz tube. Bulk superconductivity with Tc ~ 21. 5 K was demonstrated in resistivity and magnetic susceptibility measurements after the as-grown crystals were annealed at 500 °C in vacuum for a week. X-ray diffraction patterns confirm that the annealed and the as-grown crystals possess the identical crystallographic structure of Ba 2 Ti 2 Fe 2 As 4 O. Energy-dispersive x-ray spectra indicate that partial Ti/Fe substitution exists in the [Fe 2 As 2] layers and the annealing process redistributes the Ti within the Fe-plane. The ordered Fe-plane <b>stabilized</b> by <b>annealing</b> exhibits superconductivity with magnetic vortex pinned by Ti...|$|R
40|$|We have {{observed}} that submicron sized Al [...] AlO_x [...] Al tunnel junctions can be <b>stabilized</b> completely by <b>annealing</b> them in vacuum at temperatures between 350 ^∘C and 450 ^∘C. In addition, low temperature characterization of the samples after the annealing treatment showed a marked improvement of the tunneling characteristics due to disappearance of unwanted resonances in the current. Charging energy, tunneling resistance, barrier thickness and height all increase after the treatment. The superconducting gap is not affected, but supercurrent is reduced {{in accordance with the}} increase of tunneling resistance. Comment: 4 pages, 3 figure...|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} the use of thermal {{annealing}} to improve the behavior of NO 2 gas-sensing ruthenium phthalocyanine films at high temperatures. The approach used, based on the study of the effect of temperature on the film morphology, makes use of in situ energy dispersive X-ray reflectometry and atomic force microscopy. The results show that the morphological changes, induced by high working temperatures, strongly affect the material sensing ability. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the film morphology may be <b>stabilized</b> by thermal <b>annealing</b> treatments, thus enhancing the sensor performances in terms of response times and the capability to work at high temperatures...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{thermomechanical}} processing parameters on the elevated temperature {{behavior of a}} 6061 aluminum [...] aluminum oxides metal-matrix composite (MMC) have been studied. The same processing parameters were employed with unreinforced 6061 AL to provide a comparison. These materials were both thermomechanically processed at either 350 C or 500 C using two rolling schedules. Both schedules involved a constant strain per pass. Subsequent mechanical tests were conducted at temperatures 200 to 500 C and strain rates ranging from (6. 7 E- 3) /s to (1. 3 E- 1) /s. The materials processed at 500 C exhibited higher strength when compared to those processed at 350 C for deformation temperatures below 350 c. Materials <b>stabilized</b> by <b>annealing</b> after completion of rolling displayed higher ductilities {{when compared to the}} as-processed materials, especially at lower testing temperatures. The peak ductilities of the MMCS occurred at testing temperatures near the prior rolling temperatures. Solution treatment prior to rolling and additional strains during rolling in excess of 2. 5 appeared to have no effect on strength or ductility[URL] United States Nav...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of finely dispersed, stable particles on the mechanical strength and microstructure of Al films on Si substrates has been studied. Aluminum oxide particles were produced in Al films by oxygen ion implantation, and the grain size was increased by a laser reflow treatment. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) {{was employed to}} observe the oxide particles and the grain structure in the films after subsequent annealing, and the wafer curvature technique was used to study the deformation properties of the films {{as a function of}} temperature. Significant particle strengthening was obtained in the coarse-grained films in tension as well as in compression. In the as-deposited and ion-implanted films a very fine grain size of only 0. 35 mu m is <b>stabilized</b> after <b>annealing</b> which causes considerable softening of the film in compression at higher temperature because of the enhancement of grain boundary and volume diffusion controlled relaxation mechanisms. However, in tension at low temperature these films show high stresses comparable to those of the laser reflowed and ion-implanted films. The results are discussed in the light of TEM observations...|$|R
40|$|Mn 3. 04 Ge 0. 96 has a {{hexagonal}} crystal structure, {{which can be}} <b>stabilized</b> by high-temperature <b>annealing,</b> and shows antiferromagnetic order with a small ferromagnetic component of less than 0. 1 mu(B) and a coercivity of 0. 45 T. In the ordered phase, magnetization curves M(H) exhibit an exchange bias of 62 mT at T = 2 K after field cooling, which is observable up to room temperature. The exchange anisotropy is suggested to originate from the exchange interaction between the host of triangular-antiferromagnetic Mn 3 Ge units and embedded ferrimagnetic-like clusters. Such clusters develop when excess Mn atoms occupy empty Ge sites in the original triangular-antiferromagnetic structure of Mn 3 Ge...|$|R
40|$|The {{structural}} changes of a (111) oriented CeO 2 film grown on a Si(111) substrate {{covered with a}} hex-Pr 2 O 3 (0001) interface layer due to post deposition annealing are investigated. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements revealing the near surface stoichiometry show that the film reduces continuously upon extended heat treatment. The film is not homogeneously reduced since several coexisting crystalline ceria phases are stabilized due to subsequent annealing at different temperatures as revealed by high resolution {{low energy electron diffraction}} and X-ray diffraction. The electron diffraction measurements show that after annealing at 660 °C the ι-phase (Ce 7 O 12) is formed at the surface which exhibits a Image ID:c 3 cp 52688 g-t 1. gif structure. Furthermore, a Image ID:c 3 cp 52688 g-t 2. gif surface structure with a stoichiometry close to Ce 2 O 3 is <b>stabilized</b> after <b>annealing</b> at 860 °C which cannot be attributed to any bulk phase of ceria stable at room temperature. In addition, it is shown that the fully reduced ceria (Ce 2 O 3) film exhibits a bixbyite structure. Polycrystalline silicate (CeSixOy) and crystalline silicide (CeSi 1. 67) are formed at 850 °C and detected at the surface after annealing above 900 °C...|$|R
40|$|The present paper {{describes}} investigations on the {{creep-fatigue interaction}} in Alloy 800 H at 650 oc under two different loading conditions. First, {{low cycle fatigue}} tests with strain rates {{in the range from}} 10 - 3 s- 1 down to 5 · 10 - 6 s- 1 are performed. Next, fatigue tests with strain controlled dwell times in tension from 180 s to 1800 s are carried out. Furthermore, the influence of different initial microstructural conditions, viz., solution <b>annealed,</b> <b>stabilized</b> and long term aged, is investigated. The evolution of the microstructure as well as the damage mechanisms are characterized by scanning electron microscopy. Under both loading conditions the solution annealed material shows a pronounced cyclic hardening due to the strain-induced precipitation of small M 23 C 6 chromium carbides. With increasing dwell time, or decreasing strain rate, the maximum peak stress is lowered. As a result of the heat treatment or long term aging at 650 oc, chromium carbides precipitate at grain boundaries as well as inside the grains. Hence, the potential for strain induced precipitation is limited and the steady state condition is reached after a few cycles. Lifetime is only affected by the initial microstructure under slow low cycle fatigue loading. This is a result of two different damage mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|Cu(In,Ga) Se 2, {{in short}} CIGS, solar cells have {{received}} considerable attention among photovoltaic solar cells {{because of their}} high conversion efficiency, flexibility and lightweight. The challenge in CIGS technology nowadays {{is not only to}} enhance performances but also to find low cost processing options. The use of CIGS modules built from monolithic interconnected cells on steel sheets is a promising solution; however it requires an additional dielectric layer interposed between the substrate and the entire active stack. Thus, the focus of this thesis was to elaborate a novel dielectric systems prepared on steel substrates and to optimize molybdenum layers as contacts for the fabrication of “high temperature” flexible CIGS solar cells. Polysilazane hybrid polymers were identified and explored to act as a dielectric layer for CIGS solar cells. Coatings were performed on stainless steel substrates using a straightforward “bar coating” deposition method which is suitable for industrial rolling processes. The problem with polysilazane coatings is that they often suffer from thermal instability and cracking due to the high annealing temperature required for growing the CIGS absorbing layer. Indeed, our thermal analysis reveals an important mass loss of around 25 wt. % for type of polysilazane we use. The mass reduction was assigned to chemical transformations of the polymer evidenced by volatilization of different gases and evolution of solvent. Such degradations show a severe weakening of the dielectric strength of polysilazane coatings. It was shown that polysilazanes can be <b>stabilized</b> after <b>annealing</b> at 550 °C. Polysilazane single layers with a thickness below 2 µm are crack-free even after annealing but, unfortunately do not fulfill the dielectric requirements. Single layers with a thickness higher than 2 µm systematically cracked after annealing. With a subtle combination of three layers of polysilazane and a sputtered SiOxAly layer we succeeded in growing a crack-free dielectric stack with total thickness of more or less 4 µm. Constant voltage stress measurements performed on metal-insulating-metal capacitors reveal that such dielectric stacks can tolerate an applied voltage of 1000 V before annealing and 500 V after annealing at 500 °C. Optimization of Mo films was then performed on dielectric stacks and a method to produce crack-free and well-adhered Mo films was established. Two solutions were found and each solution was obtained by combining two different layers. Both solutions pass adhesion testing and exhibit very low sheet resistance required for Mo back contacts. The interface between a set of Mo films and polysilazane was also studied. There seems to be a link between Mo-O-Si covalent bonds and good adhesion at the interface. Adhesion loss observed for some Mo/polysilazane samples occurred due to decohesion in polysilazane itself. The decohesion is assigned to the weakening of polysilazane due to the formation of molybdenum carbide at the interface. Finally, the analysis of steel modified by ultra-thin polysilazane reveals the presence of Cr-O-Si and Fe-O-Si covalent bonds which may explain the good adhesion observed with polysilazane/steel samples.

40|$|Spintronics or spin-{{electronic}}s {{attempt to}} utilize the electronic spin degree of freedom to make advanced materials and devices for the future. Heusler materials are considered very promising for spintronics applications as many highly spin-polarized materials potentially exist in this family. To accelerate materials discovery and development, The Materials Genome Initiative ([URL] was undertaken in 2011 to promote theory-driven search of new materials. In this thesis work, we outline our effort to develop several new materials that are predicted to be 100 % spin-polarized (half-metallic) and thermodynamically stable by theory. In particular, two Mn-based Heusler families were investigated: Mn 2 CoZ (Z= Ga, Sb, Ge) and Mn 2 FeZ (Z=Si,Ge), where the latter is potentially a new Heusler family. These materials were synthesized using the arc-melting technique and their crystal structure was investigated using the X-ray diffraction (XRD) method before and after appropriate annealing of the samples. Preliminary magnetometry measurements are also reported. We first developed a heat-treatment procedure that {{could be applied to}} all the Mn-based compounds mentioned above. Mn 2 CoGa was successfully stabilized in the cubic inverse-Heusler phase with a= 5. 869 Å and magnetic moment of 2. 007 /fu. This is in good agreement with prior literature reports [1]. However, cubic phases of Mn 2 CoSb and Mn 2 CoGe could not be <b>stabilized</b> within the <b>annealing</b> temperature range that is accessible in our lab. We successfully synthesized a cubic Mn 2 FeSi phase using an annealing procedure similar to Mn 2 CoGa. The measured cubic lattice parameter of Mn 2 FeSi was 5. 682 Å. This is the first experimental report of this material {{to the best of our}} knowledge. Detailed analysis of relative intensities of different X-ray peaks revealed that the structure is most likely in an inverse Heusler phase, in agreement with theory. However, a substantial atomic-level disorder was also uncovered from XRD analysis that requires further investigation to understand its effect on its magnetism and half-metallicity. Mn 2 FeGe showed the existence of non-cubic phases that substantially weakened at high annealing temperatures...|$|R
