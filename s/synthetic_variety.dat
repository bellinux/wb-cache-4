40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} inbreeding depression (DE) in castor bean. From a population derived from the Guarani cultivar, 60 mother plants were sampled. Three types of progenies were obtained from each one: from self-pollination (AU), from crosses (CR) and from open pollination (PL). Grain yield of the progenies was evaluated in two locations. There was a strong interaction of progenies x locations, which led to obtaining estimates within each location. Broad variation was observed in inbreeding depression, with mean values of 6. 7 % and 13. 4 %, comparing AU progenies with PL progenies. It was observed that the population has high potential for selecting promising inbred lines.

40|$|Abstract Background To {{elucidate}} {{the role of}} the length of the internode basal ring (LIBR) in resistance to the Mediterranean corn borer (MCB), we carried out a divergent selection program to modify the LIBR using two maize synthetic varieties (EPS 20 and EPS 21), each with a different genetic background. We investigated the biochemical mechanisms underlying the relationship between the LIBR and borer resistance. Selection to lengthen or shorten the LIBR was achieved for each <b>synthetic</b> <b>variety.</b> The resulting plants were analyzed to determine their LIBR response, growth, yield, and borer resistance. Results In the <b>synthetic</b> <b>variety</b> EPS 20 (Reid germplasm), reduction of the LIBR improved resistance against the MCB. The LIBR selection was also effective in the <b>synthetic</b> <b>variety</b> EPS 21 (non-Reid germplasm), although there was no relationship detected between the LIBR and MCB resistance. The LIBR did not show correlations with agronomic traits such as plant height and yield. Compared with upper sections, the internode basal ring area contained lower concentrations of cell wall components such as acid detergent fiber (ADF), acid detergent lignin (ADL), and diferulates. In addition, some residual 2, 4 -dihydroxy- 7 -methoxy-(2 H) - 1, 4 -benzoxazin- 3 -(4 H) -one (DIMBOA), a natural antibiotic compound, was detected in the basal area at 30 days after silking. Conclusion We analyzed maize selections to determine whether the basal area of maize internodes is involved in borer resistance. The structural reinforcement of the cell walls was the most significant trait in the relationship between the LIBR and borer resistance. Lower contents of ADF and ADL in the rind of the basal section facilitated the entry of larvae in this area in both synthetic varieties, while lower concentrations of diferulates in the pith basal section of EPS 20 facilitated larval feeding inside the stem. The higher concentrations of DIMBOA {{may have contributed to the}} lack of correlation between the LIBR and borer resistance in EPS 21. This novel trait could be useful in maize breeding programs to improve borer resistance. </p...|$|E

40|$|Approximately 600, 000 tons {{of maize}} were {{produced}} annually in Nigeria. Maize {{was the main}} grain crop in southern Nigeria and its production in the middle belt was rapidly increasing. Most of the crop was eaten as dry grain, a little before maturity. A preference was recorded for floury varieties of maize in southern Nigeria. This preference depended on the greater yield of flour per unit weight of grain in the floury varieties over flint and dent varieties. Grain type, plant height, time to maturity and grain colour allowed distinction of four local maize types.

40|$|A {{generalized}} way {{to obtain}} a maize (Zea mays L.) <b>synthetic</b> <b>variety</b> is to randomly mate all possible crosses among inbred lines, but, {{when the number of}} lines is large, it would save time and effort to use other mating methods. This work is aimed to determine the utility of two alternative methods, assuming that an equal contribution of each inbred line to the synthetic is the goal (; 1993). Eight Reid inbred lines originated from the U. S. Corn Belt population ‘Reid’, and eight non-Reid unrelated inbreds were the base meterial for synthetic verieties EPS 20 and EPS 21, respectively. Each variety was built using both alternative methods: i) controlling the balanced contribution of each parental inbred (convergent cross method), and ii) randomly mating a seed mixture from the eight inbreds (random method). In the convergent cross method, single crosses between inbreds, and double crosses were performed in 1995, and 1996, respectively, as the first step to create EPS 20 c and EPS 21 c. Finally, in 1997, about 40 plants from each double-cross hybrid were mated only once (as male or female) in plant-to-plant crosses between double cross-hybrids, to generate about 20 ears that provided the base material for synthetics EPS 20 c and EPS 21 c. In the random method, a total of 304 seeds from the eight inbred lines, 38 seeds from each one, were bulked and sown in ten rows of 15 two-kernel hills per row in 1998 to form EPS 20 r and EPS 21 r. After thinning, 150 plants were left, and random plant-to plant crosses were made (where each plant was used only once as male or female), that resulted in 38 and 39 ears, respectively. The two crossing schemes were followed by two generations of recombination. A sample of 40 individuals from each <b>synthetic</b> <b>variety</b> was genotyped with 17 SSR (simple sequence repeat) markers loci. Primer sequences and chromosomal locations are available at the MaizeDB (www. agron. missouri. edu/ssr. html). Genetic drift due to the relatively small samples used to constitute balanced synthetic varieties, and/or natural selection could modify the original frequencies, but did not cause allele or heterozygosity losses. Therefore, the convergent cross method appeared to be appropriate for developing synthetic varieties either from related or non related inbreds. The random method should be used with caution, especially when inbred parents are genetically different, since relative adaptive advantages of some inbred lines could cause loss of genetic variability.

Prolificacy increased in both plant-density-selection experiments at an average rate of 0. 077 ears plant- 1 cycle- 1 (P {{less than or equal}} to 0. 01) when selecting with high-plant density, and an average of 0. 026 ears plant- 1 cycle- 1 (P {{less than or equal to}} 0. 05) when selecting with low-plant density. Total genetic gain for three cycles of selection averaged over evaluation experiments was nearly 20 % at the high-plant density and approximately 6 % at the low plant density compared with the non-selected AS-Z variety. Negative quadratic responses at the low-density selection experiment existed, but the response was highly significant linear for the 60, 000 -plant-ha(- 1) selection experiment. Yield did not show a significant correlated response to selection for prolificacy, but in three of the four instances, prolificacy and yield had the same trend. The high-plant density was the best environment to improve yield components and other agronomic characteristics of AS-Z. Selection for only prolificacy did not produce undesirable effects, but more information is needed to assess the effects of indirect selection. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine: (1) the yield heterosis exhibited in variety crosses of 12 adapted open-pollinated corn belt varieties, (2) the relative general and specific combining ability of these varieties, (3) the effect of variety crossing on moisture in grain at harvest, root lodging, stalk lodging, and dropped ears for these varieties, and (4) the varieties which are potential source material for a reciprocal recurrent selection program. Ten adapted open-pollinated corn belt <b>varieties,</b> two <b>synthetic</b> <b>varieties</b> developed from two of the open pollinated varieties, the 66 possible variety crosses among these 12 varieties, and a hybrid check (U. S. 13) were planted in yield tests at two locations in 1955 and again in 1956. One location was near Lincoln in Eastern Nebraska and the other location was near Axtell in Central Nebraska.

40|$|A diallel set of crosses among 10 <b>synthetic</b> <b>varieties</b> {{of maize}} (Zea mays L.) were {{evaluated}} in eight environments. All varieties, except BSSS, had undergone recurrent selection for either yield or pest resistance. Objectives {{of the study}} were to determine relative performance of varieties per se and in crosses with other improved varieties. Varieties improved by recurrent selection for yield were superior in yield to those improved for pest resistance. It seemed that single-trait selection for pest resistance caused a redirection of photosynthate. BS 13 (S) C 2 x BS 18 yielded 8902 kg ha- 1, which was within one LSD (0. 05) of three single-cross hybrid checks. BS 13 (S) C 2 was an improved strain of BSSS and BS 18 was developed from intercrossing two strains of Krug Hi I Syn. 3 developed from seven cycles of half-sib and S 1 recurrent selection, respectively. Possible combinations of varieties for composite formation based on heterotic response were discussed...|$|R
50|$|Sprague was a {{professor}} at Iowa State University. At Iowa State, Sprague realized that open-pollinated corn often suffered from weak roots and stalks. After intermating 16 lines known to have strong stalks and roots, Sprague created Iowa Stiff Stalk <b>Synthetic.</b> This <b>variety</b> was still used in corn breeding as of 2008. Sprague's techniques took advantage of his belief that good germplasm was crucial to successful breeding.|$|R
