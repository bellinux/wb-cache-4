40|$|Mixing {{is one of}} {{the main}} {{functions}} of <b>screw</b> <b>extruders.</b> Mixing is usually divided in distributive and dispersive mixing. It is well known that single <b>screw</b> <b>extruders</b> generally have poor mixing capability even when dispersive mixing elements are incorporated into the screw design. This paper will discuss the requirements for dispersive mixing. Current dispersive mixing elements used in single <b>screw</b> <b>extruders</b> will be analyzed and the lack of efficient dispersive mixing will be explained. A new generation of dispersive mixing elements will be introduced for use both in single and twin <b>screw</b> <b>extruders.</b> Two and three dimensional flow simulation will be used to analyze the mixing performance of these new mixers. Experimental work on the new mixing elements will be also be presented; the results demonstrate that it is possible to achieve dispersive mixing capability on single <b>screw</b> <b>extruders</b> as good as what can be achieved on twin <b>screw</b> <b>extruders.</b> The implications of these results on the compounding industry will be briefly discussed...|$|R

40|$|This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with the interaction of country-of-origin effects and perceived risk in capital equipment situations. A survey instrument containing an 2 ̆ 2 in-basket 2 ̆ 2 test was sent out to approximately 1400 subjects and was completed by 102 industrial users of twin <b>screw</b> <b>extruders</b> used in the production of plastic compounds. The subjects were all American-based companies and were drawn from a national sample. The hypothesis testing was based on the within-subjects results of a repeated measures analysis of variance technique. While the small sample size and low response rate limit the generalizibility of the results, the research reveals that a country-of-origin bias does exist in purchasers of capital equipment. A significant difference in levels of perceived risk is found in buyers considering purchasing Chinese, German and American machinery. Various risk reduction strategies are tested, including the use of customer reference lists, warranty 2 ̆ 6 performance guarantees, trial performance runs and trade show participation. Three risk reducers are found to cause a significant reduction in perceived risk, namely, the use of a customer reference list, the offer of warranty 2 ̆ 6 performance guarantees and offer of trial performance runs. Risk reduction strategies are tested for significant effects individually and as a group. Country-of-origin effects are modified by risk reduction strategies, but even after all are used, a significant country of origin effect remains. The study also examines sources of information about twin <b>screw</b> <b>extruders,</b> the reliability of these sources, the features of twin <b>screw</b> <b>extruders,</b> the importance of various factors in the purchase of twin <b>screw</b> <b>extruders,</b> and the subjects 2 ̆ 7 years of experience. ...|$|R

50|$|Micro-compounding is {{typically}} performed with a table top, twin screw micro-compounder or -extruder with a working volume of 5 or 15 ml. With such small volumes {{it is almost}} impossible to have sufficient mixing in a continuous extruder. Therefore, state of the art micro-compounders have a batch mode (recirculation) and a conical shape. The L/D of a continuous twin <b>screw</b> <b>extruder</b> is mimicked in a batch micro-compounder by the recirculation mixing time, which is controlled by a manual valve. With this valve the recirculation can be interrupted to unload the formulation in either a strand, or an injection moulder, a film device or a fiber line. Typical recirculation times are 1-3 min, dependent on the ease of dispersive and distributive mixing of the formulation.|$|E

The diameter is often measured by a laser as part of a quality control mechanism to ensure correct diameter of the filament. The filament is then fed through a warm water tank which cools the filament which gives the filament its round shape. The filament is then fed through a cold water tank to cool it to room temperature. It is then wound onto a spool to create the finished product.|$|E

The Center for Advanced Manufacturing at the Potchefstroom {{campus of}} the North West University aims to develop a twin <b>screw</b> <b>extruder</b> that is able to process powder coating resin. The {{facility}} has thus far produced various components and sub systems for local and international manufacturers of extrusion products. The research presented in this thesis aims to both develop a twin <b>screw</b> <b>extruder</b> with an integrated cooling roller system and to investigate {{of the performance of}} a twin <b>screw</b> <b>extruder.</b> The development of a twin <b>screw</b> <b>extruder</b> consists of the selection of the drive section of the extruder, the complete design of a twin <b>screw</b> <b>extruder</b> gearbox, the investigation and design of a suitable barrel for the manufacturing of powder coatings as well as the development of a unique cooling roller unit for the forming of the processed product when exiting the extruder. The extruder was manufactured from the designed components and systems. It was found on further testing that it was capable of producing a powder coating resin of good quality. In order to evaluate the performance of an extruder, the transfer of energy through the extruder needs to be understood. Furthermore it is necessary to understand the theory behind each type of energy being consumed by the extruder, as well as the factors influencing the usage of that energy. The theories investigated were verified in practice by measuring the energy consumption of a twin <b>screw</b> <b>extruder</b> operated under various conditions. These tests provided a correlation between the consumption of mechanical and electrical energy. The results gave an indication of the effectiveness of the screw configuration of the processing section of the extruder, making it possible to determine how the configuration should be amended in order to improve the performance of the extruder.

40|$|A {{coextruded}} snack {{based on}} corn, defatted soya flour and Indonesian ingredients (rice and/or tapioca) {{was developed for}} Indonesian consumers, particularly {{to fit into the}} young adult niche market. Market and consumer research was carried out through collecting primary and secondary data and the results were utilized in the formulation of the extruded snack. Information about the snack market situation in Indonesia and consumer attitude towards extruded snack products indicated that there is an opportunity for success for a new-western style snack (extruded snack) in Indonesia and the key for success are product awareness and product attributes, notably crispiness and flavour. The snack base was manufactured using a co-rotating and intermeshing twin <b>screw</b> <b>extruder</b> (Clextral BC- 21) with a constant feed rate and optimized by changing ingredients and extrusion conditions set by a constrained mixture design scheme (Echip computer software). The effect of the extrusion conditions and ingredients on the functional, physical properties of the snack product was also studied in this project. The product cost was also optimized with a constraint of no more than Rp. 4000 per kg (NZ$ 2. 70) finish snack product. The study on the extrudate properties showed that an increase in rice flour increased moisture content (MC), Water Absorption Index (WAI), Nitrogen Solubility Index (NSI) and Breaking Strength (BS), while an increase in soya reduced the protein solubility and the extrudate became brownish. Consumer acceptability was mainly affected by the rice content, soya content and temperature in the last section (T 4). Specific Mechanical Energy (SME), an extrusion parameter, was calculated directly through torque measurements. Higher SME indicated higher energy used in the extrusion process, thus more starch degradation and protein denaturation occurred, producing extrudates with lower BS. Sensory evaluation showed that snacks with lower BS (a crispier product), higher L* and b* colour (light brownish yellow colour) had a higher acceptance. The most preferred snack base was made from 28 % defatted soya flour, 12 % rice flour, 59. 6 % corn grits and 0. 4 % baking soda. These ingredients were processed in a twin <b>screw</b> <b>extruder</b> with a feed rate of 4. 47 kg/hr. The four barrel temperature zones were set at 40 °C, 80 °C, 115 °C and 140 °C, respectively and 150 ml/hr of water was pumped to the barrel. The screw speed was set at 300 rpm. The snack acceptance was improved by coating the samples with flavours and the most preferred flavour determined by a sensory panel was a spicy flavour (Ethican – QZ 02346; Quest International). The optimum product formulation was then tested in a larger scale consumer test in Indonesia. The results from the final product testing showed that the developed snack was accepted by the target consumers. However some improvements of the product in terms of oil content and product stickiness in the mouth are still necessary. The developed product had a better acceptance over the snacks already in the market in terms of nutritional image, crispiness, product appearance and main ingredients. In addition a feasibility study on snack production in a single <b>screw</b> <b>extruder</b> was carried out and functional and physical properties of the resulting extrudates were compared with those produced using the twin <b>screw</b> <b>extruder.</b> The comparison of WAI, Glass transition temperature (Tg), NSI and BS of snacks manufactured using a single (Lalesse, Universal single <b>screw</b> <b>extruder)</b> and a twin <b>screw</b> <b>extruder</b> (Clextral BC 21) showed that the extent of molecules degradation was lower in the single <b>screw</b> <b>extruder</b> than in the twin <b>screw</b> <b>extruder.</b> Sensory properties also indicated that the twin screw extrudate was crispier and suited to the consumers' preference than the single screw extrudate. The developed product could be produced commercially either using a twin <b>screw</b> <b>extruder</b> or a single <b>screw</b> <b>extruder,</b> depending on the available equipment, although it was recognized that the snack manufactured using the twin <b>screw</b> <b>extruder</b> had a higher preference compared to those produced using the single <b>screw</b> <b>extruder...</b>|$|E
