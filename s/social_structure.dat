40|$|There are, basically, two {{accounts}} of labour markets: the mainstream labour market (MLM) account and the Heterodox account(s) which recognises that labour markets {{are embedded in}} <b>social</b> <b>structures.</b> Whilst bringing <b>social</b> <b>structures</b> into the account(s) is a strength, it reveals meta-theoretical weaknesses. A critical realist meta-theoretical critique not only undermines the MLM account, it also clears the way for Heterodoxy to deal more robustly with <b>social</b> <b>structures</b> and to reject the notion of functional relations between wage rates, supply and demand for labour. What are usually referred to as 'labour markets', then, disappear. There are no phenomena called 'labour markets' that are subsequently embedded in other phenomena called social structures: labour markets become synonymous with the <b>social</b> <b>structures</b> that constitute them. Critical realism also provides the meta-theoretical apparatus necessary to deal robustly with <b>social</b> <b>structures...</b>|$|R

40|$|Changes in <b>social</b> <b>structures</b> {{occurring}} {{during the}} process of economic growth can be considered direct consequences of this process, while other changes are caused by factors such as technological progress, that affect simultaneously <b>social</b> <b>structures</b> and growth. This chapter focuses on that part of the circular argument that goes from growth to <b>social</b> <b>structures.</b> It does not consider the effect of social changes on growth. The chapter is thus an attempt to isolate the pure "income effect" in the evolution of <b>social</b> <b>structures</b> and to disentangle the effect of economic growth from the effect of other factors in observed changes in <b>social</b> <b>structures.</b> Section 1 examines the nature of the statistical relationships existing between social indicators and development across countries and/or across periods, in order to illustrate the differences in <b>social</b> <b>structures</b> associated with differences in income. It also discusses the difficulty of obtaining precise estimates {{of the size of the}} income effect from this kind of evidence and the need to rely on more structural analyses. Section 2 reviews theoretical models of the effect of economic growth on <b>social</b> <b>structures,</b> with an emphasis on several dimensions of social differentiation and on economic inequality. Section 3 focuses on the empirical evidence in support of this structural view of the consequences of growth for <b>social</b> <b>structures.</b> Section 4 concludes by emphasizing the importance of sectoral shifts, the role of the market in integrating the economy and society, and the social costs of sectoral adjustments. The effect of changes in <b>social</b> <b>structures</b> on <b>social</b> institutions and on social relations is only briefly discussed in the Conclusions. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} is to trace {{the relationship between the}} atomistic personality and the <b>social</b> <b>structures</b> of the Chippewa-Ojibwa cultural-linguistic groups. The selection of this group was determined after an ethnographic survey of the urban Indians of Chicago at the American Indian Center during the summer of 1973. The basic hypothesis of this research is that the atomistic personality, which is a characteristic feature of the Chippewa-Ojibwa, has hindered native development of extensive <b>social</b> <b>structures</b> known historically beyond that of the individual family and that most of the <b>social</b> <b>structures</b> were results of externally initiated forces or influences. In delineating the types of <b>social</b> <b>structures,</b> I have described five temporal levels.

The central ideas influencing this shift by Rosenberg were that: (1) individual mental health depends on the <b>social</b> <b>structure</b> of a community (Fromm), (2) therapists alone are unable to meet the psychological needs of a community (Albee), and (3) knowledge about human behavior will increase if psychology is freely given to the community (Miller).|$|E
