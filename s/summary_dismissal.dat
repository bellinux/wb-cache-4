25|$|Underlying Mr Barker's {{claim is}} that the Commonwealth Bank was wrong to dismiss him in breach of its policies.

If the employer dismissed an employee without notice, a court would scrutinise whether the employee's conduct justified <b>summary</b> <b>dismissal.</b> Even if the contract does not specify a period of notice, a term is implied that either party could bring the contract of employment to an end by giving a reasonable period of notice.|$|E
25|$|Peter Rost {{was vice}} {{president}} in charge of the endocrinology division at Pharmacia before and during its acquisition by Pfizer. During that time he raised concerns internally about kickbacks and off-label marketing of Genotropin, Pharmacia's human growth hormone drug. Pfizer reported the Pharmacia marketing practices to the FDA and Department of Justice; Rost was unaware of this and filed an FCA lawsuit against Pfizer. Pfizer kept him on, but isolated him until the FCA suit was unsealed in 2005. The Justice Department declined to intervene, and Pfizer fired him, and he filed a wrongful termination suit against Pfizer. Pfizer won a <b>summary</b> <b>dismissal</b> of the case, with the court ruling that the evidence showed Pfizer had decided to fire Rost prior to learning of his whistleblower activities.|$|E

Likewise, Goldstein stated that the critique that the liberal justices are more likely to invalidate acts of Congress, show inadequate deference to the political process, and be disrespectful of precedent, also lacked merit: Thomas has most often called for overruling prior precedent (even if long standing) that he views as having been wrongly decided, and during the 2009 term Scalia and Thomas voted most often to invalidate legislation.|$|R

500|$|Valve {{adopted the}} word [...] "Dota", {{derived from the}} {{original}} mod's acronym, as the name for its newly acquired franchise. Johnson argued that the word referred to a concept, and was not an acronym. Shortly after the announcement of Dota 2, Valve filed a trademark claim to the Dota name. At Gamescom 2011, company president Gabe Newell explained that the trademark was needed to develop a sequel with the already-identifiable brand. Holding the Dota name to be a community asset, Feak and Mescon filed an opposing trademark for [...] "DOTA" [...] on behalf of DotA-Allstars, LLC (then a subsidiary of Riot Games) in August 2010. Rob Pardo, the {{executive vice president of}} Blizzard Entertainment at the time, similarly stated that the DotA name belonged to the mod's community. Blizzard acquired DotA-Allstars, LLC from Riot Games and filed an opposition against Valve in November 2011, citing Blizzard's ownership of both the Warcraft III World Editor and DotA-Allstars, LLC as proper claims to the franchise. The dispute was settled in May 2012, with Valve retaining commercial franchising rights to the [...] "Dota" [...] intellectual property, while allowing non-commercial use of the name by third-parties. In 2017, Valve's ownership of it was again challenged, after a 2004 internet forum post from Eul was brought to light by a studio known as uCool, which stated that the [...] "Dota" [...] brand was an open source project. uCool, who was previously involved in a lawsuit with Blizzard in 2015 due to a mobile game they released that involved the use of characters and lore from the Dota universe, argued that the forum post invalidated any ownership claims of the intellectual property.

2500|$|The {{requirements}} of notice and any disciplinary procedure {{do not apply}} if the employee {{was the one to}} have repudiated the contract, either expressly, or by conduct. As in the general law of contract, if an employee's conduct is so seriously bad that it manifests to the reasonable person an intention to not be bound, then the employer may dismiss the employee without notice. But if the employer is not justified in making a <b>summary</b> <b>dismissal,</b> the employee has a claim under ERA 1996 section 13 for a shortfall in wages. The same principle, that a serious breach of contract gives the other side the option to terminate, also works in favour of employees. In Wilson v Racher a gardener was bullied by his employer, the heir of Tolethorpe Hall, and gave him a rude telling off for not picking up some string on the lawn. Mr Wilson, the gardener, told Mr Racher [...] "get stuffed, go and shit yourself". The Court of Appeal held that the employer's attitude meant this breakdown in trust and confidence was the employer's own doing, and because the law no longer saw employment as a [...] "Czar-serf" [...] relationship, Mr Wilson was in the right and was wrongfully dismissed. The remedy for breach of contract, following a long tradition that specific performance should not result in draconian consequences or binding hostile parties to continue working together, is typically monetary compensation to put the claimant in the same position as if the contract had been properly performed. However, in Edwards v Chesterfield Royal Hospital, the Supreme Court held that an injunction is available to restrain breach of contract for the employer's failure to follow a doctor's contractual disciplinary procedure. This indicated that specific performance should always in principle be available, particularly in large organisations where people can be shifted to avoid personality conflicts.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: NOMI is {{a dynamic}} condition. Its {{appearance}} at imaging may be different depending on the time in which CT examination is performed and {{on the presence of}} reperfusion event. The aim of our work has been to assess the efficacy of MDCT for the diagnosis of NOMI, with and without reperfusion event. Methods and Materials: Clinical and imaging data from 20 patients (16 males, 4 females) with a <b>dismissal</b> <b>summary</b> of NOMI were retrospectively reviewed. All patients had at least 1 abdominal MDCT examination (n= 28) followed by surgery (n= 8), autopsy (n= 2), angiography (n= 1) or endoscopy (n= 9). The CT scans were evaluated for evidence of vessels, mesentery, bowel and cavity features. The mean diameter of the SMA of NOMI cases were compared with that of 30 controlled cases. Results: The average SMA diameter of NOMI cases were statistically smaller than that of controls (K-S test: D= 0. 75, Prob= 3. 7 E‑ 08). A correlation between the reperfusion event and mesenteric fat stranding (p= 0. 026), bowel wall thickening (p= 3. 2 E‑ 05) and high attenuation of the bowel wall on unenhanced CT images (p= 2. 8 E‑ 04) was demonstrated by Fisher’s exact tests. Normal mesenteric vessels plus wall thickening was significantly correlated with lower mortality (p= 0. 034). Conclusion: The evaluation of mesentery, bowel and peritoneal CT features, in addition to the vessel findings will supply additional information to recognise NOMI and in discriminating the presence of a reperfusion event...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} the CT features of reperfusion (presence/absence) in non-occlusive mesenteric ischaemia (NOMI) and their prognostic value {{in an emergency}} setting. Methods: A revision was undertaken of imaging from 20 patients (16 males/ 4 females) with a <b>dismissal</b> <b>summary</b> of NOMI. All patients had previously undergone aminimum of one multidetector CT examination, and consequently underwent surgery (n= 8), autopsy (n= 2), angiography (n= 1) or endoscopy (n= 9). An evaluation of the CT scans was conducted to determine vessels, mesentery, bowel and peritoneal cavity features. The superior mesenteric artery (SMA) average diameter of NOMI cases were compared with 30 controlled cases. Kappa, Kolmogorov' Smirnov (K-S) and Fisher's exact tests were used for statistical analysis. Results: A mean SMA diameter significantly smaller {{than that of the}} controlled cases was found for patients with NOMI (K-S test: D= 0. 75, p= 3. 7 × 10 - 08). Fisher's exact tests showed a strong connection between the presence of reperfusion and mesenteric fat stranding (p= 0. 026), bowel wall thickening (p= 3. 2 × 10 - 05) and a high attenuation of the bowel wall on unenhanced CT images (p= 2. 8 × 10 - 04). A reduction in mortality was significantly linked to the combination of normal mesenteric vessels and wall thickening (p= 0. 034). Conclusion: Analysis of not only vessels findings but also mesentery and bowel CT features will support the identification of NOMI with or without a reperfusion event in an emergency setting. A strong correlation between some CT features and lower mortality exists. Advances in knowledge: CT features of NOMI with or without reperfusion are demonstrated. Correctly assessing the presence of reperfusion in NOMI, may allow better management of these conditions in the emergency setting...|$|R

60|$|The Alexandrian {{agent had}} been asked to lodge us decently. My wife found herself in a cabin {{occupied}} by two nurses. I was placed in a manner of omnibus, a loose box for six, of whom one was an Armenian and two were Circassians from Daghistán--good men enough, but not pleasant as bedroom fellows. No extra service had been engaged for an extra cargo of seventy-two; that is, forty-two first, and thirty second class. There were only three stewards, including the stewardess; and the sick were left to serve themselves. At least half a dozen were required; and, in such places as Trieste and Alexandria, a large staff of cooks and waiters can always be engaged in a few hours. On board any English ship some of the smartest and handiest seamen would have been converted into temporary attendants--here no one seemed to think of a proceeding so far out of the usual way. There was only one, instead of three or four cooks; and the unfortunate had to fill a total of one hundred and thirty-five mouths, the crew included, three times a day.

The circumlocution fashion prevailed, forms and fusses tormented our souls, and unnecessary strictness in one place was counterbalanced by unpardonable laxity in another. Here is a sample: I am dressing Sam Dammer's shoulder; and, having cleansed the wound, look about for some strips of adhesive plaster to hold on the little square of wet linen which is to cover the gunshot wound; the case is not in the tray; Frank, the sleepy, half-sick attendant, knows nothing of it; we rummage high and low; Sam is tired, and fumes; Frank dawdles and yawns; the men advise and laugh at the flurry; I feel like a boiling tea-kettle, with the lid ready to fly off and damage somebody.|$|E
60|$|Dolly {{might have}} remonstrated against this <b>summary</b> <b>dismissal</b> of the subject, {{notwithstanding}} {{the appearance of}} dinner, but {{at the mention of}} Blue Beard Mrs Varden interposed, protesting she could not find it in her conscience to sit tamely by, and hear her child recommended to peruse the adventures of a Turk and Mussulman--far less of a fabulous Turk, which she considered that potentate to be. She held that, in such stirring and tremendous times as those in which they lived, it would be much more to the purpose if Dolly became a regular subscriber to the Thunderer, where she would have an opportunity of reading Lord George Gordon's speeches word for word, which would be a greater comfort and solace to her, than a hundred and fifty Blue Beards ever could impart. She appealed in support of this proposition to Miss Miggs, then in waiting, who said that indeed the peace of mind she had derived from the perusal of that paper generally, but especially of one article of the very last week as ever was, entitled 'Great Britain drenched in gore,' exceeded all belief; the same composition, she added, had also wrought such a comforting effect on the mind of a married sister of hers, then resident at Golden Lion Court, number twenty-sivin, second bell-handle on the right-hand door-post, that, being in a delicate state of health, and in fact expecting an addition to her family, she had been seized with fits directly after its perusal, and had raved of the Inquisition ever since; to the great improvement of her husband and friends. Miss Miggs {{went on to say that}} she would recommend all those whose hearts were hardened to hear Lord George themselves, whom she commended first, in respect of his steady Protestantism, then of his oratory, then of his eyes, then of his nose, then of his legs, and lastly of his figure generally, which she looked upon as fit for any statue, prince, or angel, to which sentiment Mrs Varden fully subscribed.|$|E
