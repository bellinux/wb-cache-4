The most common circuit configurations are the simple mono and stereo jacks (A and B); however {{there are a}} great number of variants manufactured.A two-conductor TS phone connector. The connection to the sleeve is the rectangle towards the right, and the connection to the tip is the line with the notch. Wiring connections are illustrated as white circles.A three-conductor TRS phone connector. The upper connector is the tip, as it is farther away from the sleeve. The sleeve is shown connected directly to the chassis, a very common configuration. This is the typical configuration for a balanced connection. Some jacks have metal mounting connections (which would make this connection) and some have plastic, to isolate the sleeve from the chassis, and provide a separate <b>sleeve</b> <b>connection</b> point, as in A.This three-conductor jack has two isolated SPDT switches. They are activated by a plug going into the jack, which disconnects one throw and connects the other. The white arrowheads indicate a mechanical connection, while the black arrowheads indicate an electrical connection. This would be useful for a device that turns on when a plug is inserted, and off otherwise, with the power routed through the switches.This three-conductor jack has two normally closed switches connected to the contacts themselves. This would be useful for a patch point, for instance, or for allowing another signal to feed the line until a plug is inserted. The switches open when a plug is inserted. A common use for this style of connector is a stereo headphone jack that shuts off the default output (speakers) when the connector is plugged in.|$|E

Polymer resin grout {{can be used}} as bonding {{material}} for grouted <b>sleeve</b> <b>connections</b> This paper presents the experimental results on the effectiveness of fly ash as micro filler to the splitting tensile strength of polymer grout. In addition, the cement grout that is usually used as {{bonding material}} had been tested for comparison. Eleven proportions, of fly ash as the filler and polymer as binder, were tested with the binder to filler volume ratios of 1 : 1 and 1 : 1. 5. The test results revealed that fly ash {{can be used as}} a micro-filler material to partially replace ordinary river sand in polymer resin grout. The splitting tensile strength of the polymer grout increases with the increase of fly ash contents. However, for higher level of fly ash of more than 22 %, the splitting tensile strength deteriorated. For binder: filler ratio of 1 : 1, the optimum fly ash content of 22 % gave the maximum splitting strength of 17. 62 MPa, which can be considered acceptable for producing grout with high strength bonding material...|$|R

Welded stiffened and unstiffened knee joints, bolted knee joints with end plates, and connections with a fabricated internal sleeve, {{were included in the}} experimental investigation. Most connections tested under opening moment failed by fracture in the heat affected zone of the RHS near the weld. The connections tested under closing moment failed by web local buckling which occurred near the connection. While the stiffened and unstiffened welded connections satisfied the strength interaction requirements in the available design guides, the connections did not maintain the plastic moment for sufficiently large rotation to be considered suitable for a plastic hinge location. The unstiffened welded joints were not able to reach the plastic moment. The use of an internal sleeve moved the plastic hinge in the connection away from the connection centre-line and reduced the stress on the weld between the legs of the connection. It was found that <b>sleeve</b> <b>connections</b> were capable of sustaining the plastic moment for large rotations considered suitable for plastic desig...|$|R
40|$|The {{strength}} of connections in precast concrete structure elements {{is the main}} factor that {{plays an important role}} in the Industrialised Building System. Various types of connections have been developed by previous researchers to improve the existing connections in the market. This study was conducted to develop a new splice sleeve connector, using spiral and elongated bar, which can produce comparable bond strength with the tensile capacity of reinforced bars. In the first phase of the study, 52 specimens were tested under tensile loads until all specimens reached their ultimate failure state. Based on the study conducted, ES- 65 - 4 - 200 specimens with bar embedment length of 200 mm, spiral inner diameter of 65 mm, four elongated bars of Y 10 inside the spiral bar, and use of grout was selected. In phase 2, the selected splice sleeve connector was used in the precast concrete wall panel system. Then, the connector was tested under shear loads to study the connectionâ€™s performance. In this phase, three monolithic specimens, three specimens with Nisso Master Builders (NMB) connectors, and three specimens with the proposed connector were tested. The performance of connections under tensile and shear loads was evaluated based on the ultimate loading capacity, displacement, strain, stress and failure mode. The results show that the wall specimens using spiral and elongated bar connectors, ES- 65 - 4 - 200 achieve satisfactory structural performance with the ultimate shear capacity 28 % higher than monolithic wall and NMB wall connection. These results indicate that the combination of spiral and elongated bar is able to improve the performance of the splice <b>sleeve</b> <b>connections</b> in precast concrete wall structures...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Many {{structural}} {{failures in}} precast concrete buildings are initiated by connection failures. To avoid such failures, the connections should have enough strength {{to join the}} reinforcement bars between precast concrete panels. This paper presents the structural performance and behaviour of a proposed splice <b>sleeve</b> <b>connection</b> using generic steel pipe. The connection consisted of steel bars with tapered nuts confined in grouted steel pipes. The connections were subjected to increasing axial tension until failure. The {{results show that the}} use of smaller pipes gives better confinement effects and provide higher bond strength. A short embedment length of about 10 times rebar diameter is able to provide full tensile strength of the connected rebars.

40|$|One steel {{grid and}} five {{thin-walled}} concrete-filled steel tubes (CTST) {{used as the}} supports of tunnel were tested in site for investigating the mechanical behavior. The mechanical influences of thickness, node form, and concrete on CTST were gained and compared with the impacts on steel grid. It is indicated that high antideformation capacity of CTST improved the stability of surrounding rock in short time. The cementitious grouted <b>sleeve</b> <b>connection</b> exhibited superior flexibility when CTST was erected and built. Although the deformation of rock and soil in the tunnel was increasing, good compression resistance was observed by CTST with the new connection type. It was also seen that vault, tube foot, and connections were with larger absolute strain values. The finite element analysis (FEA) was carried out using ABAQUS program. The results were validated by comparison with experimental results. The FE model could be referred by similar projects...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{circular}} {{hollow sections}} (CHS) are being widely employed in steel structures around the world, increasing {{the development of}} new researches. This article proposes an innovative connection model for circular hollow sections that facilitates and reduces the assembly cost of hollow section structures. The proposed connection is a tube sleeve, used to splice two tubes, composed of an inner tube with a diameter smaller than the connecting tubes, which is connected to the outer tubes by bolts passing through both tubes. This connection can be a cheaper and easier alternative to flange connections, which are widely used in large span tubular trusses. The connection was tested in laboratory under tension loading. The tests made it possible to identify the influence of stress distribution on tubes and the need for the use of a shear lag coefficient. The results of the ultimate load capacity demonstrated the viability of the tube <b>sleeve</b> <b>connection</b> use...|$|E
40|$|The {{conventional}} grouted {{connections with}} corrugated aluminium sleeves {{have been used}} widely in precast concrete construction. The main problem of the conventional grouted <b>sleeve</b> <b>connections</b> {{is the need for}} long embedded lengths reinforcement rebars to achieve full continuity. There is a tendency for the long rebars to touch the sleeve wall and subsequently preventing penetration of grout around the rebar. Since the grout inside the sleeve cannot be inspected after installation, there is doubt that the main rebar is fully bonded. This study proposed a grouted spiral connection which can overcome the use of long embedded length of connected rebars. The main objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the effect of spiral confinement on the bond stress-slip relationship. The experimental program was carried out in two phases, Phase I and Phase II. In Phase I, a total of thirty-six spiral connections were subjected to increasing direct axial pullout loads. Then, in Phase II, a total of twelve beams comprising spiral connections were subjected to flexural pullout loads. Parameters considered in this study were pitch distance and diameter of spiral connections. The experimental results showed that the use of smaller pitch distance and spiral diameter resulted in higher bond strength. However, the spiral diameter had more dominant confinement effect such that it increased the bond strength of direct and flexural pullout tests very dramatically by 34. 5 % and 40 %, respectively. In addition, lower bond strength from the beam tests was reported as compared to the axial pullout tests. The bond strengths obtained from the flexural pullout tests were within the range of 0. 74 to 0. 79 times the bond strengths of the axial pullout tests. Finally, analytical equations were proposed to express the bond stress-slip relationship and bond strength of the grouted spiral connectio...|$|R

To-date, the industry is still very much relying on it as the main assessment criteria to determine the feasibility of a grouted splice connection.|$|R

40|$|Cold {{formed steel}} (CFS) sigma {{sections}} {{are commonly used}} as purlins {{in the construction of}} modern industrial and residential buildings due to their excellent strength-to-weight ratio. This thesis reports investigations on the structural behaviour of CFS sigma purlins in three different parts of modern roof systems. In the first investigation, the pre-buckling, buckling, post-buckling and post-failure behaviour of continuous CFS sigma purlins near internal supports was studied by experimental and numerical methods. In the second investigation, the moment-rotation response as well as the moment resistance of the <b>sleeve</b> <b>connection</b> of sigma purlins was studied by laboratory tests. Engineering models were developed to predict the behaviour of this connection and a good correlation was observed with the experimental data. In the third investigation, the flexural stiffness and moment resistance of CFS sigma purlins fastened to roof sheeting with large screw spacing was studied experimentally. The purlin-sheeting assemblies were subjected to both downward and uplift loadings, from which different behavioural aspects such as flexural stiffness, failure modes and ultimate load were examined.

40|$|Superior {{properties}} of fibre-reinforced-polymer (FRP) composites, {{such as high}} specific strength and excellent corrosion resistance, make them as a potential substitute to traditional metallic materials in piping structures. Despite the advantages associated with FRP pipes, their joining methods are still not satisfactory. It is a known fact that joints are the weakest links of such composite piping structures. A new connection method is proposed in this paper, as the prestressed grouted <b>sleeve</b> <b>connection.</b> The connection transmits axial force by shear on the grout and FRP interface. Shear transfer can be enhanced by introducing radial prestress. The prestress is achieved by using an expansive additive (CSA) which expands the grout after setting. This paper investigates the effects of different CSA ratios on the load bearing capacity of the prestressed grouted sleeve connections in compression. It was found pre-load strain developed significantly in hoop direction which indicates the development of radial prestress. Results from compressive experiments indicate that a high CSA ratio enhances the load bearing capacity of the connection. Different failure modes were observed during the compression tests. Possible reasons are discussed based on the interpretation of strain results...|$|E
40|$|Repair {{techniques}} for short-distance peripheral nerve defects, including adjacent joint flexion {{to reduce the}} distance between the nerve stump defects, "nerve splint" suturing, and nerve <b>sleeve</b> <b>connection,</b> have some disadvantages. Therefore, we designed a repair technique involving intraoperative tension-free application of a nerve elongator and obtained good outcomes in the repair of short-distance peripheral nerve defects in a previous animal study. The present study compared the clinical outcomes between the use of this nerve elongator and performance of the conventional method in the repair of short-distance transection injuries in human elbows. The 3 -, 6 -, and 12 -month postoperative follow-up results demonstrated that early neurological function recovery was better in the nerve elongation group than in the conventional group, but no significant difference in long-term neurological function recovery was detected between the two groups. In the nerve elongation group, the nerves were sutured without tension, and the duration of postoperative immobilization of the elbow was decreased. Elbow function rehabilitation was significantly better in the nerve elongation group than in the control group. Moreover, there were no security risks. The results of this study confirm that the use of this nerve elongator for repair of short-distance peripheral nerve defects is safe and effective. ...|$|E

30|$|This paper {{presents}} an {{experimental study of}} a new grouted splice connection for wall panels, called Welded Bar <b>Sleeve</b> (WBS). The <b>connections</b> were made from steel pipes and tested with incremental tensile, shear and flexural loads until failure. The aim {{is to determine the}} behaviour of the connection under the three load cases. For this, the connections are evaluated in terms of the loadâ€“displacement responses, ultimate capacities, ductility responses and some feasibility assessment criteria. WBS was found to provide sufficient strength at the bar embedded length of 8, 8 and 11 times the bar diameter under tensile, shear and flexural loads, respectively. It is effective under tension, but could only service up to 1 / 3 of its ultimate shear capacity. Flexural load is the most critical load case for the connection. For this, further enhancements are required when subjected to shear and flexural loads.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to assess the {{suitability}} of cold-formed rectangular hollow sections (RHS) for plastic design. The project involved an extensive range of tests on cold-formed Grade C 350 and Grade C 450 (DuraGal) RHS beams, joints and frames. A large number of finite element analyses was also carried out on models of RHS beams. The conclusion is that cold- formed RHS {{can be used in}} plastic design, but stricter element slenderness (b/t) limits and consideration of the connections, are required. Further research, particularly into the effect of axial compression on element slenderness limits, is required before changes to current design rules can be finalised. Bending tests were performed on cold-formed RHS to examine the web and flange slenderness required to maintain the plastic moment for a large enough rotation suitable for plastic design. The major conclusions of the beam tests were: (i) Some sections which are classified as Compact or Class 1 by current steel design specifications do not maintain plastic rotations considered sufficient for plastic design. (ii) The current design philosophy, in which flange and web slenderness limits are independent, is inappropriate. An interaction formula is required, and simple formulations are proposed for RHS. Connection tests were performed on various types of knee joints in RHS, suitable for the column - rafter connection in a portal frame. The connection types investigated were welded stiffened and unstiffened rigid knee connections, bolted plate knee joints, and welded and bolted internal sleeve knee joints, for use in RHS portal frames. The ability of the connections to act as plastic hinges in a portal frame was investigated. The most important finding of the joint tests was the unexpected fracture of the cold-formed welded connections under opening moment before significant plastic rotations occurred. The use of an internal sleeve moved the plastic hinge in the connection away from the connection centre- line thus eliminating the need for the weld between the RHS, or the RHS and the stiffening plate, to carry the majority of the load. The internal <b>sleeve</b> <b>connections</b> were capable of sustaining the plastic moment for large rotations considered suitable for plastic design. Tests on pinned-base portal frames were also performed. There were three separate tests, with two different ratios of vertical to horizontal point loads, simulating gravity and horizontal wind loads. Two grades of steel were used for comparison. The aims of the tests were to examine if a plastic collapse mechanism could form in a cold-formed RHS frame, and to investigate if plastic design was suitable for such frames. In each frame, two regions of highly concentrated curvature were observed before the onset of local buckling, which indicated the formation of plastic hinges and a plastic collapse mechanism. An advanced plastic zone structural analysis which accounted for second order effects, material non-linearity and member imperfections slightly overestimated the strength of the frames. The analysis slightly underestimated the deflections, and hence the magnitude of the second order effects. A second order plastic zone analysis, which did not account for the effects of structural imperfections, provided the best estimates of the strengths of the frames, but also underestimated the deflections. While cold-formed RHS did not satisfy the material ductility requirements specified for plastic design in some current steel design standards, plastic hinges and plastic collapse mechanisms formed. This suggests that the restriction on plastic design for cold-formed RHS based on insufficient material ductility is unnecessary, provided that the connections are suitable for plastic hinge formation, if required. A large number of finite element analyses were performed to simulate the bending tests summarised above, and to examine various parameters not studied in the experimental investigation. To simulate the experimental rotation capacity of the RHS beams, a sinusoidally varying longitudinal local imperfection was prescribed. The finite element analysis determined similar trends as observed experimentally, namely that the rotation capacity depended on both the web slenderness and flange slenderness, and that for a given section aspect ratio, the relationship between web slenderness and rotation capacity was non-linear. The main finding of the finite element study was that the size of the imperfections had an unexpectedly large influence on the rotation capacity. Larger imperfections were required in the more slender sections to simulate the experimental results. There should be further investigation into the effect of varying material properties on rotation capacity...|$|R
