40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the development of food safety scores in <b>school</b> <b>meal</b> <b>services</b> during the application of a systematic intervention based on the knowledge, attitude and practice triad. A total of 68 public schools were included in the study. <b>School</b> <b>meal</b> <b>services</b> were assessed every three months with a checklist, which resulted in eight evaluations over two years. A program was developed and implemented in all the schools during this period that was comprised of three steps: 1) theoretical training, 2) implementation of action plans in situ and 3) weekly visits to motivate food handlers and monitor good practices. These steps were designed to promote changes in the attitudes and practices of food handlers. An ascending linear function was observed for the <b>school</b> <b>meal</b> services' general adequacy percentage over time. Positive developments were also observed regarding buildings and facilities, processes and procedures, distribution of meals, integrated pest management, water control, controls and records, health and safety of employees and equipment and utensils. Our results suggest that the proposed intervention strategy performs well in making <b>school</b> <b>meal</b> <b>services</b> conform to good practices and that strategies in this context should be permanent and continuous.

40|$|Purpose - {{the aim of}} {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the good manufacturing practices in <b>meal</b> <b>services</b> in public <b>schools</b> and day care centres in Baixada Santista, Brazil using a health risk classification. Design/methodology/approach - A total of 59 public schools and day care centres in nine municipalities of Baixada Santista - Brazil were randomly selected. the sanitary conditions were evaluated by applying a validated checklist specific to <b>school</b> <b>meal</b> <b>service.</b> the questions were scored according to the health risks detected. A percentage of conformity to good manufacturing practices was calculated, than schools and day care centres were classified according to health risk in relation to the scores obtained for each thematic area addressed in the checklist and in relation to the overall score. Findings - It was observed that 62 per cent of the schools were classified as average health risk failing to comply with Brazilian legislation on food safety rules. the thematic areas that showed lower percentage of conformity to good manufacturing practices were: hand hygiene (33. 9 per cent), pest control (3. 4 per cent), food handlers (62. 4 per cent) and food hygiene (65. 4 per cent). the <b>school</b> <b>meal</b> <b>service</b> of day care centres presented higher conformity in the hand hygiene (p < 0. 01) and the environmental sanitation (p < 0. 05) than elementary schools. Practical implications - the data observed in our study highlight the need of an effective system to monitor and evaluate the hygienic sanitary conditions in Brazil. the implementation of HACCP system may be an option with good potential to produce safer <b>meals</b> in <b>school</b> environment, nevertheless, the prerequisite program must be implemented first. Professionals with expertise in food safety can act as consultants to the <b>school</b> <b>meal</b> <b>service</b> and may use the data from this study as a benchmark for interventions.

EARLY ORIGINS Public schools, both ancient and modern, boarding and day, have always provided school meals as part of their school life and curriculum. Staff dined together with the children in dining halls or refectories, some sitting with the pupils, others at the high table. The first state schools in Great Britain, dating from 1870, made no such provision for their school life. The Destitute Children's Dinner Society founded in 1864 had by 1869 opened fifty-eight dining rooms in London, where hungry children were given a soup meal, but only during the winter months. Other charities also helped to provide soup kitchens. Public concern was aroused by reports of grave malnutrition and physica...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} prevent {{children}} and young people from becoming obese, healthier eating patterns are urgent. Organic school meals may be an effective strategy to provide healthy food to children. The {{purpose of this study was}} to take a closer look into the current status of organic school meal systems in Denmark, by conducting a case study of three municipalities in the Zealand region that have the most developed models for <b>school</b> <b>meals</b> <b>service</b> in this country. These municipalities have for some years introduced organic food for sale in their primary schools, with three quite different approaches. Copenhagen has established a large central kitchen, producing partly organic food that is heated and sold in tuck shops at the schools. Roskilde cooperates with an organic catering company, delivering food to be sold in school canteens. Gladsaxe has part-time employed staff preparing and selling food at each school, and these people are educated about organic food by a municipal coordinator. Based on interviews with key informants in the three municipalities, the report describes the involved actors, interactions among actors, and barriers and future plans regarding an increased consumption of organic food in school meals. Similarities and differences between the municipalities are discussed. The main challenges for an increased consumption of organic food in schools are related to lack of infrastructure in the schools such as kitchens and dining halls, and that the school meal systems developed so far are not well rooted among the pupils, teachers, other school staff and the parents...|$|E

This study examined 176 food handlers from different food businesses in Santos - Brazil, as follows: street food kiosks, beach kiosks, restaurants, hospitals, and <b>school</b> <b>meal</b> <b>services.</b> the individuals indicated their own risk and their peers' risk of causing a foodborne disease through a 10 cm linear scale anchored by descriptors of intensity ranging from none to very high. the difference between these risk perceptions characterized the OB score. Food handlers perceived themselves as less likely than their peers to transmit a foodborne disease to the consumer (p < 0. 01) and less likely than other food handlers to transmit foodborne disease to their friends and family members (p < 0. 01). A food handler believes that other food handlers are worse than he or she is. Environmental characteristics can empower food handlers and increase their OB, as observed among schools' and hospitals' food handlers. Understand food handlers' perceptions can enable the discussion of different effective strategies of training. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

40|$|Purpose – Social, {{physical}} and temporal characteristics {{are known to}} influence the eating experience {{and the effectiveness of}} nutritional policies. As the <b>school</b> <b>meal</b> <b>service</b> features prominently in UK nutritional and health promotion policy, the paper's aim is to investigate the characteristics of the primary school dining context and their implications for eating behaviours. Design/methodology/approach – A case study of one local authority in Wales was conducted involving 11 primary schools stratified into socio-economic quartiles. Focussed observations were carried out over two to three lunchtimes per school to explore their social, {{physical and}} temporal characteristics. These were supplemented by semi-structured interviews with catering staff and midday supervisors. Findings – The dining halls had numerous generic attributes (e. g. accommodation, equipment, length of lunchtime, social actors). These interacted to have a direct, but not necessarily positive, bearing on food choice and consumption. Overcrowded, multi-purpose dining halls coupled with time pressures and dynamic social situations detracted from the eating experience and the ability of staff to encourage children to eat. Practical implications – Without addressing these underlying issues, school nutritional policy may only play a limited role in influencing what children eat. It is recommended that policy places a greater emphasis on factors such as the eating environment; the time available for eating; {{and the role of the}} midday supervisor. Originality/value – Previous studies of dining halls have generally been part of process evaluations of nutritional interventions.

40|$|This thesis {{argues that}} the {{official}} responses {{at the national level}} to the impact high unemployment had upon the community in the North East Lancashire weaving area in the early 1930 s were barely adequate. The Lancashire cotton industry had been in depression since the early 1920 s, long before the Great Depression affected the rest of the world, and the high unemployment and the low wages paid in the cotton industry had a disastrous effect on an area almost totally dependent upon that industry. Financial conservatism during the Great Depression meant low benefits, and these low benefits resulted in widespread poverty. I argue that in contrast to the national government’s response, local authorities in North East Lancashire set a reasonably high standard of care in their area. They cared for those in need: children, the elderly and the sick and made medical care and education available for children with disabilities. They provided maternal and child welfare clinics, a school medical service and a <b>school</b> <b>meals</b> <b>service.</b> They were also vigorous in housing inspections according to Housing Acts and Public Health Acts. Based on a closely detailed study of local authority records and National Government Education and Health records, this thesis demonstrates that poverty was widespread; the national government was dilatory in recognising regional variations of long-term structural unemployment which in the Lancashire weaving area was slow to diminish, and that local authorities‟ responses, while ample, could not address the problem of poverty in the area adequately without further funding from central government.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{based largely on}} the results of six inter-related {{national}} surveys of community meals services for old people arid thus includes an examination of meals on wheels services, lunch club services, and local authority home help services. Two of these services at least - the meals on wheels service and the home help service - {{have been the subject of}} critical comment from social researchers in the past decade or so as attention has become increasingly directed towards the needs of the old and handicapped in non-institutional settings. This interest has been further intensified by official policies which encourage the return to, or indeed, the retention in the community of those who, by virtue of ill-health, frailty, or handicap, would previously have been institutionalized. The meals services, particularly the domiciliary ones, are basic for the viability of community care. They should make a valuable contribution towards the maintenance of the infirm and incapable in their own homes. These studies were undertaken with the aim of assessing the kind and quality of contribution the meals services are making to the welfare of the old. Part I of this thesis is on current literature of some the social characteristics of health status; and finally, a concerned with a discussion based aspects of the 'problem' of old age old people and considerations of critical examination of communityprovisions for the aged since, while 'more' may mean 'better', this may be a non sequitur in some areas of social provision for aged. Questions then about the appropriateness of use of current health and welfare services are discussed. Part II describes the aims, methods arid outcome of the meals services surveys in Scotland. Questions relating to coverage, type and adequacy of services are raised with both service providers - the local authorities and voluntary organisations - and recipients. In addition, information was gathered concerning the provenance of recipients; their feelings about their health and abilities to care for themselves; their family ties and contacts, and factors such as housing and economic status which may so fundamentally affect a life-style. This study does not break much new ground. It certainly provides more detailed information about the organisation and administration of these services in Scotland than has been available before and, perhaps more significantly, it throws more light on the interface of relationships between voluntary organisers and local authorities, and the views of both towards the services they provide. Lack of change is among the main findings of this research. Although there has been an upward trend in the number of meals supplied over the last fifteen years, the increase has been slow and in that time the modal weekly figure of two meals per recipient has not changed. Both coverage and frequency remain inadequate by normative standards. The study also confirms that domiciliary meals are generally provided for those who score highly on accepted risk factors: most are old (seventy-five years or more); live alone; have no home help; have problems of self-care; and 'make-do' for food on days when meals are not provided. The study also underwrites criticisms concerning the unsuitability of some meals. The <b>School</b> <b>Meals</b> <b>Service,</b> the main supplier of meals for the elderly in Scotland, rightly caters for the needs of growing youth. High carbohydrate content is inappropriate and undesirable in the diet of old people. Menus too seem less than tempting for the aged palate. The views of organisers, local authorities and recipients go a considerable way towards explaining some of the noted inadequacies in provision. The fact that few organisers believe that services are not adequate, or actively search for new recipients, and the fact that most have variable rules and regulations governing acceptance practices must all affect service provision in some way. So too must local authority officials, many of whom judge their services to be inadequate but who, for a variety of reasons, may not be planning remedies. These, and other factors influencing the efficacy of community services, are discussed in Part III. This work then reports not only the results of six national studies but also attempts to place them in the context of the general situation of old people; to comment on them as indicators in the development of welfare provision; and to discuss some of their implications for community services...|$|E

A regression model was used to study the variables associated with observed practices (p < 0. 001). the variables related to observed practices were the knowledge score (beta = 0. 27, p < 0. 01), experience (in years as a food handler) (beta = 0. 19, p = 0. 01), the relationship between the number of meals and the number of food handlers (beta = 0. 19, p = 0. 01), buildings and facilities adequacy(beta = 0. 20, p = 0. 01) and the presence of a nutritionist (beta = 0. 42, p < 0. 001). This study showed that training based on theoretical aspects is not related to the attitudes, self-reported practices and observed practices of Brazilian food handlers from different food services. However, training seems to be an effective tool for improving knowledge. the current wording of Brazilian legislation motivates food handlers to undergo training only for certification. Food safety laws should not only require certification, but also enable the establishment of policies to monitor and ensure the adequacy of food services. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were: 1) identify the state anxiety, trait anxiety levels and perceived stress levels of food handlers and; 2) Verify the association of these scores with food safety variables like: food safety knowledge, attitudes, practices and with job characteristics. This study involved 183 randomly selected food handlers from different food businesses in Santos city, Brazil, as follows: street food kiosks, beach kiosks, restaurants, hospitals and <b>school</b> <b>meal</b> <b>services.</b> To evaluate knowledge, attitudes and self-reported practices, a structured questionnaire was used. Observed practices were evaluated using a checklist. the State Trait Anxiety Inventory - STAI was applied to assess the levels of state and trait anxiety with a score range from 10 to 80. To evaluate stress the Perceived Stress Questionnaire - PSQ was used with a score range from zero to one. Food handlers presented 39. 22; 10. 1 (mean; standard deviation) of state anxiety score, 39. 58; 9. 6 of trait anxiety score and a perceived stress score of 0. 36; 0. 09. Observed practices presented a weak negative correlation with state anxiety (r = 0. 26; p = 0. 014) but not with. trait anxiety (r = - 0. 18; p = 0. 09) and stress (r = 0. 03; p = 0. 78). Using generalized linear models were observed that a higher stress level, trait anxiety and state anxiety were found in food handlers who do not participated in food safety training and with lower knowledge scores of food safety. These findings show that training can not only improve knowledge but possibly empower food handlers, increase their self-efficacy and reduce anxiety and stress levels.

40|$|Based on {{national}} reports from Denmark, Finland, Italy and Norway, describing the <b>school</b> <b>meal</b> systems {{and to which}} extent organic food is integrated there, this report identifies differences between the four countries and experiences made with organic food procurement and the dissemination of organic ingredients in <b>school</b> <b>meals.</b> Such knowledge will help to understand the possibilities and restrictions for increasing organic food in <b>school</b> <b>meal</b> systems, and to reveal the room of manoeuvre for public organic food procurement for youth in each country. In the report, similarities and differences of the national <b>school</b> <b>meal</b> systems in general are first discussed, because this context determines the scope of organic food procurement. The history and current situation of the <b>school</b> <b>meal</b> systems, framework conditions of public food procurement in schools (laws, guidelines, control, financing), {{the structure of the}} <b>school</b> <b>meal</b> provision and public discourses about <b>school</b> <b>meals</b> are described. Next, focus is set on the use and development of organic food in <b>school</b> <b>meal</b> systems. Some <b>school</b> <b>meal</b> system cases are presented by the amount of organic food used, the arguments for organic school food and challenges and barriers for the dissemination of organic food. Finally, <b>school</b> <b>meal</b> system actors in general as well as “organic” actors such as promoters, decision makers, companies and organisations are compared across the four countries. Summarizing chapters are found {{at the end of each}} section of the report. In short, warm meals are served for free to all pupils daily in Finland, and subsidized according to family income to all pupils at least twice a week in Italy. Norway and Denmark stick to a packed lunch brought from home, with additional milk and fruit subscription schemes and a developing additional or complementary <b>meal</b> <b>service</b> especially in Denmark with subsidized prices. Organic food is much emphasised in Italy and Denmark; significantly less in Finland and Norway...|$|R
50|$|The Seoul Free Lunch Referendum was a {{referendum}} held on 24 August 2011, {{on the subject}} of free <b>school</b> <b>meals</b> in the <b>schools</b> around the Seoul Metropolitan Area. The former mayor of Seoul, Oh Se-hoon, proposed to provide a limited free <b>meal</b> <b>service</b> to the 30% of the impoverished children in Seoul, but the Democratic Party proposed to make the free <b>meal</b> <b>service</b> to every kid in Seoul starting from younger elementary school children and gradually to middle school children. This has become the cause of Oh Se-hoon's action to make the final decision of the policy through {{a referendum}}. The referendum was later rejected due to the low voter turnout of 25.7%, significantly lower than the required turnout of 33.3%. The low voting rate contributed Oh Se-hoon's resignation from the mayoralty of Seoul.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: This article {{seeks to}} inform {{state and local}} school food {{policies}} by evaluating the impact of Connecticut’s Healthy Food Certification (HFC), a program which provides monetary incentives to school districts that choose to implement state nutrition standards for all foods sold to students outside reimbursable <b>school</b> <b>meals.</b> METHODS: Food <b>service</b> directors from all school districts participating in the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) (N = 151) in Connecticut were surveyed about the availability of competitive foods {{before and after the}} 2006 - 2007 implementation of HFC. Food categories were coded as healthy or unhealthy based on whether they met the Connecticut Nutrition Standards. Data on NSLP participation were provided by the State Department of Education. Changes in NSLP participation and availability of unhealthy competitive foods in elementary, middle, and high schools were compared pre- and post-HFC across districts participating (n = 74) versus not participating (n = 77) in HFC. RESULTS: On average, all districts in Connecticut reduced the availability of unhealth...|$|R
40|$|Public {{catering}} in Finland {{has strong}} historical roots from the 19 th century, {{connected with the}} rise of the national state, industrialisation, democracy and modern times in general. The <b>school</b> <b>meal</b> system developed hand in hand with work place <b>meal</b> <b>services,</b> and inherently the aim was to offer lateral support for workers' and pupils' activities by healthy and wholesome nutrition. The public catering had initially a strong label of welfare services and implied economical use of ingredients. Later on, the character of public service of the welfare state was emphasised, as public catering was perceived as a way to promote equality between citizens. The public <b>meal</b> system, and <b>school</b> <b>meal</b> system as part of it, represented not a self-evident and 'natural' developmental path, but {{can be seen as a}} result of extensive political, economic and organisational efforts, even fights. Further on, the nutritional and cultural orientations were strengthened when the public <b>school</b> <b>meal</b> system was made a statutory free service for all pupils, first in basic education, and later in secondary education. Today the Finnish welfare state meets the challenge of greying societies and decreasing labour force, and the <b>school</b> <b>meal</b> system, as all public provision systems, in confronted with the trend for increased efficiency and economical operations, including food procurement. Even within these restrictive organisational environments, there is interest in environmentally friendly food and sustainable development by public caterers, municipal officials and politicians of all parties. While the conventional meal system is the prevailing one, there are also movements towards sustainable catering in hundreds of schools around Finland, connected to Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) program. The report is produced within the project “innovative Public Organic food Procurement for Youth”, iPOPY, and will be updated and revised during the project period (2007 - 2010) ...|$|R
