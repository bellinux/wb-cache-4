5|$|Senator Roberts {{proposed}} legislation {{at the start}} of session regarding the surety bond required for towing carriers in rural areas. SB12-049 would have lowered the surety bond from $50,000 to $10,000 for local entities. The bill was assigned to the Senate Transportation Committee, but was postponed indefinitely after it was introduced. However, after the bill was killed, public upheaval caused Roberts to introduce a new bill, this time in the House, which resolved the same issue. HB12-1347 passed the <b>second</b> <b>time</b> <b>around</b> with a resounding 98-1 vote.|$|E
5|$|After {{defeating}} Harris at TNA's Victory Road PPV {{event on}} July 17, 2007 and Tomko, Styles, and he {{losing to the}} team of Andrew Martin, Sting, and Abyss at TNA's Hard Justice PPV event on August 12, 2007 in a Doomsday Chamber of Blood match to become number one contender to the TNA Title, Cage restarted his feud with Samoa Joe. The two met at TNA's No Surrender PPV event on September 9, 2007, where Cage defeated Joe by disqualification when Joe refused to release his Coquina Clutch submission hold he had applied. The two had a rematch on October 14, 2007 at TNA's Bound for Glory PPV event with Matt Morgan as the special outside enforcer. There, Joe defeated Cage to end his 23-month-long undefeated streak by not officially being pinned nor made to submit. Cage and Joe fought one {{more time on the}} October 18, 2007 episode of Impact!, with a spot in the 2007 Fight for the Right tournament to become number one contender to the TNA Championship. Cage defeated Joe to gain entry. Cage made {{it all the way to}} the final round of the tournament, where he fought Kaz on the November 8, 2007 episode of Impact!. Cage defeated Kaz, but due to interference from Styles and Tomko on Cage's behalf, the match was declared a no contest, with the finals being determined on November 11, 2007 at TNA's Genesis PPV event in a ladder match. Cage, however, failed to win the tournament final the <b>second</b> <b>time</b> <b>around</b> at Genesis.|$|E
5|$|The safety {{car came}} back in on lap 32, with Rosberg leading the field at the flying restart, quickly pulling out a two-second {{advantage}} over Hamilton. Sergio Pérez was {{the winner of the}} restart, moving up three places into 11th and moving up another position several laps later. On lap 39, Button moved ahead of Felipe Nasr into seventh position. After keeping the gap at around two seconds for a number of laps, a mistake by Rosberg saw Hamilton close back up to him, allowing him to use the drag reduction system to attempt an overtake manoeuvre. Several drivers decided to change tyres for a <b>second</b> <b>time</b> <b>around</b> lap 50, including Valtteri Bottas on lap 52, while Nico Hülkenberg took his third stop a lap before, serving a five-second time penalty for speeding in the pitlane in the process. On lap 55, Hamilton {{was the first of the}} leading duo to come in for a pitstop, followed by Rosberg a lap later. A quicker stop for Rosberg and a mistake by Hamilton on his lap after pitting saw Rosberg emerge from his stop ahead. Verstappen was in the lead, soon followed closely by the two Mercedes drivers. On lap 58, Räikkönen overtook Ricciardo for fourth place, while Verstappen was staying in the lead with soft compound tyres he fitted on lap 15. He lost the lead to Rosberg however on lap 61, with Hamilton getting past him as well soon after. As the Mercedes duo battled for the race win, several drivers retired in the closing stages of the race, including Hülkenberg and Massa. Räikkönen was closing in to Verstappen in third, while Pascal Wehrlein edged closer to Bottas in tenth place as well. On the last lap, Hamilton attempted to overtake Rosberg into turn two. Hamilton went to the outside but Rosberg turned into the corner late on the inside and both cars touched, damaging Rosberg's front wing and pushing Hamilton off the track. They almost touched again as Hamilton rejoined the track. Hamilton eventually got ahead into turn three as Rosberg nursed his damaged car to the finish line. He was relegated to fourth position as both Verstappen and Räikkönen moved past him over the course of the lap. Further behind, Pérez retired, elevating Wehrlein into the last point-scoring position in tenth.|$|E

50|$|The {{main goal}} of Francis Joyon was {{to regain the}} single-handed round-the-world record from Ellen MacArthur.

25|$|The West Indians batted better <b>second</b> <b>time</b> <b>around.</b> Richard Ollivierre made 67 and Smith again excelled with 100, {{the pair}} adding 100 {{for the fifth}} wicket in 55 minutes. Ollivierre hit in splendid fashion. Set 111 Hampshire were 61/4 but made the target comfortably. Smith took 4/53 and 7 wickets in the match.|$|E
25|$|The Tigers {{began their}} match {{one day before}} Australia and Sri Lanka faced off in the VB Series, and {{recorded}} their first win since November; the Bushrangers, by contrast, hadn't lost since November. The first-innings third-wicket stand between Michael Di Venuto and Travis Birt of the Tigers was worth 143, eight more than Victoria managed in their first innings, and though Cameron White and Shane Warne scored half-centuries for Victoria the <b>second</b> <b>time</b> <b>around,</b> they fell 121 short of their target of 409. In Sydney, the Warriors batted to nine for 508 thanks to centuries from Marcus North (151 not out) and Luke Ronchi (100), and Steve Magoffin and Brett Dorey then took three wickets each as the Blues were bowled out for 117. The <b>second</b> <b>time</b> <b>around,</b> the Blues made 478, but despite three wickets from spinner Jason Krejza the Warriors made it home with six wickets to spare.|$|E
25|$|The <b>second</b> <b>time</b> <b>around</b> the {{tourists}} did much better. Sydney Smith with 93 and Harragin with 63 adding 130 {{runs for the}} fifth wicket in 80 minutes.

25|$|Tipper {{made his}} debut on 23 June against Gloucestershire, and his 42 {{in the first}} innings helped avert a crisis; he had come in with the score on 27/5, but his {{steadying}} knock helped the team to 201.

25|$|The ground {{hosted a}} single Test match in 1902, against Australia, which England lost by 143 runs.

Attendances were poor, and the experiment was never repeated.|$|E
5000|$|Like the {{previous}} game The Book of Air, Dream Chronicles’ feature factor called [...] "Dream Jewels" [...] come with four special powers (one ability was lifted {{compared to the}} fourth game).

25|$|<b>Second</b> <b>time</b> <b>around,</b> only Stewart (69*) {{could muster}} any resistance, with Extras {{contributing}} the next highest score (28) {{in a total}} of 175. Wasim Akram's 4–66 was earned mostly at the expense of England's tail. Pakistan made their target of 138 look like hard work, falling to 18–3 and 95–8 with Lewis (3–43) and Ian Salisbury (3–49) their main tormentors. Once again, Wasim and Waqar combined to win the match – only this time with the bat. A dogged 45 not out from Wasim and strong support from Waqar (20*) saw Pakistan home.|$|E
25|$|It backfired spectacularly. Wood (48), Jaques (37), Michael Vaughan (53) and Harvey (47) {{all made}} {{entertaining}} knocks, {{but it was}} Anthony McGrath who stole the show with a five-and-a-half-hour 165 not out - the grindstone of Yorkshire's amazing runchase, {{the highest in the}} Championship this season - indeed, the highest fourth-innings run chase in the club's history. Leicestershire's bowlers were smashed to all corners, Phil DeFreitas the only one who escaped with some respectability as he took two for 50 in eleven overs. Gibson, Leicestershire's best performer of the first innings, conceded 124 for no wicket the <b>second</b> <b>time</b> <b>around.</b>|$|E
25|$|South Africa named an {{unchanged}} side, {{boosted by}} {{the confidence of}} the draw at Lords and content that their bowlers could deliver as anticipated <b>second</b> <b>time</b> <b>around.</b> Graeme Smith enforced this belief by opting to field, and was rewarded as Morné Morkel and Dale Steyn in particular got stuck into England's batsmen. England were dismissed for 203 on day 1. Kevin Pietersen top scored with 45, and Ian Bell scored 31, but this was the best of a bad bunch. Andrew Flintoff scored 17 and looked to have some confidence with the bat, having had very little success in his recent county appearances. But overall, it was a disappointing effort from England, but they did respond with 3 wickets before the close of play to leave South Africa on 101/3.|$|E
50|$|The 1884-85 {{season was}} Newton Heath LYR's second season of {{competitive}} football.

50|$|Like two {{previous}} {{games of the}} series, Dream Chronicles’ featured factor Dream Jewels (and the new one: gold nuggets) come with unique usages, as {{they are required to}} open new Nexus gateways, {{and for the first time}} Dream Jewels can be forged by the players themselves. There are ten gold nuggets and 30 Dream Pieces molding ten Dream Jewels to complete; other 58 gold nuggets and 60 Dream Pieces work as bonus scores, which are all scattered throughout the game. Like Dream Chronicles 2, players need to replay the game several times to be able to find all of 16 Dream Jewels. At the end of the game, players earn a high score. The faster how players can complete the game, the more Dream Pieces and gold nuggets they can find, the more Dream Jewels they can forge, the better score they will earn.

He made his under-19 Test debut in the third and final Test of the series, played at the County Ground, Chelmsford. He came in seventh in the batting order on debut, between future senior internationals Imran Nazir and Humayun Farhat, but scored only five runs before being out leg before wicket to Paul Franks.|$|E
25|$|Every Essex batsman except number 11 Steyn (run out for 0) {{scored in}} double figures, and William Jefferson top-scoring with 93 as Essex {{got into a}} {{relatively}} comfortable lead of 142, despite three wickets from DeFreitas and Ottis Gibson. Leicestershire surpassed their first innings score with five wickets in hand the <b>second</b> <b>time</b> <b>around,</b> though, before Gough and Napier dug out two wickets to have them 228 for 7. Robinson, Dinesh Mongia, Aftab Habib and HD Ackerman had all passed 30, and Claude Henderson paired up with Ackerman to add 96 for the eighth wicket – the second-highest partnership of the match, as Leicestershire {{made their way to}} a lead of 190. Gough was the only bowler to take more than two wickets, ending with four for 60, while Steyn conceded 102 runs in his 21-over effort, although he did get the wickets of Robinson and Gibson.|$|E
25|$|Day three {{began with}} the weather again threatening, and Chappell {{declared}} the Australian innings closed without returning to the crease {{to try to make}} a game of it. However Glamorgan openers Jones and Hopkins made much better work of it the <b>second</b> <b>time</b> <b>around,</b> pushing the score past 100 without loss. With Australia's frontline bowlers struggling to make a breakthrough, spinner Ray Bright was brought on, and made an immediate impact, having the advancing Hopkins stumped brilliantly by replacement wicket-keeper Richie Robinson for 66. Bright troubled the Glamorgan batsmen with his left-arm orthodox spinners, and soon claimed another, Arthur Francis for 2, leaving Glamorgan on 119–2. Gwyn Richards arrived as his replacement and tried to lift the scoring, but Bright soon claimed Jones for 47, and Mike Llewellyn for 9. Glamorgan had reached 164 for 4 off 43 overs and decided to end their innings and give the Australian's a competitive target. Bright finished with 4 for 53.|$|E

25|$|The 2005–06 NBA season {{marked a}} {{crossroads}} in Bryant's basketball career. Despite past differences with Bryant, Jackson returned {{to coach the}} Lakers. Bryant endorsed the move, and by all appearances, the two men worked together well the <b>second</b> <b>time</b> <b>around,</b> leading the Lakers back into the playoffs. Bryant's individual scoring accomplishments posted resulted in the finest statistical season of his career. On December 20, 2005, Bryant scored 62 points in three quarters against the Dallas Mavericks. Entering the fourth quarter, Bryant outscored the entire Mavericks team 62–61, the only time a player has done this through three quarters since {{the introduction of the}} shot clock. When the Lakers faced the Miami Heat on January 16, 2006, Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal made headlines by engaging in handshakes and hugs before the game, signifying a change in the feud that had festered between them. A month later, at the 2006 NBA All-Star Game, the two were seen laughing together.|$|E
25|$|However, Gloucestershire bowled {{with more}} effect the <b>second</b> <b>time</b> <b>around,</b> Malinga Bandara taking four for 85 in a {{marathon}} 37-over spin bowling effort. Rudge repaired his golden duck, taking a wicket {{with his first}} ball of the innings to remove Mark Wallace for another golden duck. However, Rudge was taken for 36 in a six-over spell, and never returned to bowl. Dean Cosker top scored for Glamorgan with 52 from number seven {{as they made their}} way to 290, setting Gloucestershire a target of 540 to win - which would have been a first class record chase. Ramnaresh Sarwan attempted it, hitting out well after Kadeer Ali had been dismissed, but he was eventually bowled by Huw Waters for 54. Gloucestershire succumbed to 184 for 5 at stumps, needing to survive another day for the draw. Wharf spoiled that, though, taking four wickets on the fourth morning as Gloucestershire crawled to 217 and a 322-run defeat.|$|E
25|$|Xavier Marshall with 82 and Daren Ganga with 99 – {{both with}} ODIs for West Indies – lifted West Indies A to 228 for 2, {{but there was}} little {{resistance}} after that, and Sajeewa Weerakoon could take six wickets with his left-arm spin. However, Jermaine Lawson and Tino Best put pressure on with good and lucky fast bowling, as only wicket-keeper Prasanna Jayawardene passed fifty runs. The touring team had a slender lead of 37, but batting with more composure the <b>second</b> <b>time</b> <b>around,</b> Ryan Ramdass and Carlton Baugh, who both made fifties, ensured that the visitors would have to chase 316. They were well on their way – despite two wickets from Best early on, and Avishka Gunawardene retiring hurt – with 126 for 2 at stumps on day 3. And they would have fancied their chances with the hard-hitting Gunawardene at the crease, and the score 255 for 5. Then the wheels fell off – the last five wickets went for three runs, and the West Indians took the first of the three-game series.|$|E
