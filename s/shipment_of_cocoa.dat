5000|$|C.W. Chappelle was {{the first}} head {{electrician}} of U.S. Steel, and used his contacts there to help the African Union Company, Inc., that had been formed at 1821 Dean Street in Brooklyn, New York with branches in Cincinnati, Ohio and the Gold Coast (British colony) of West Africa. (African Union Company officials included Charles W. Chappelle, president; Joseph L. Jones, secretary; John T. Birch, Treasurer; Directors Gilchrist Stewart, Emmet J. Scott, D. W. Roberts, M. D., George W. Robber, and R. R. Jackson) Additional funding came from minerals such as silver, tin (and other commodities such as mahogany found on the leased African lands) that were exported to the USA and Europe. In 1914 the Company announced its intention to buy the Charles W. Chappelle Company, said to have a large mahogany concession in the Gold Coast (British colony). The land leases usually encompassed about 120 square miles, and were time generous, some offering a 90 plus years contract. This was during a time period when the natural environment was not a main concern. Some leaders on the African continent did not favor the export arrangement as questioning it as depleting Africa of resources {{and the use of}} an African-American to do so, but overall, C.W. Chappelle was received favorably by Africa’s black population and leaders. After C.W. Chappelle moved back to Pittsburgh in the 1920s, he was still an active president of the African Union Company, and its Chairman of the Board was Dr. Jay Emmett Scott of the USA's Howard University, Washington, D.C. [...] It was reported in the Savannah Tribune in 1922 that, [...] "Charles W. Chappelle has made connections with the U.S. Steel Corporation 1922 to the extent of a contract of 100,000 tons of manganese a year for use in their extensive plants. $8,000,000 worth of the finest grades of mahogany 1922 are now awaiting shipment to the United States and Europe" [...] and that business was thriving requiring two steamships. Later, while Jay Emmett Scott was {{chairman of the board of}} the African Union Company, it was [...] "unable to arrange for shipment of the cocoa to the United States. The loss of this big deal sealed the company's fate. As the company teetered on the edge of bankruptcy in early 1923, Scott struggled to save it. He managed to keep the African Union Company afloat for a few more years, even attracting Robert Lee Vann, the Pittsburgh attorney and newspaper owner, to assume control of the company's legal affairs. By 1930, though, the African Union Company was defunct." [...] The exact circumstances of why the African Union Company had problems in the <b>shipment</b> <b>of</b> <b>cocoa</b> (cocoa bean) from Africa to the United States in the late 1920s seems to be so far unknown, and the African Union Company going out of business does coincide just before or during the beginning year of the Great Depression in U.S. history.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The coiled-coil {{coactivator}} (CoCoA) enhances transcriptional {{activity of}} nuclear receptors, the xenobiotic aryl hydrocarbon receptor, and the lymphocyte enhancer factors (LEF) in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. <b>CoCoA</b> is comprised <b>of</b> a large central coiled coil domain flanked by N-terminal and C-terminal activation domains (AD). The N-terminal AD <b>of</b> <b>CoCoA</b> {{is required for}} coactivator function with LEF and β-catenin, while the C-terminal AD <b>of</b> <b>CoCoA</b> is required for coactivator function with nuclear receptors. We explored the role of sumoylation in regulating {{the activities of the}} two ADs and the coactivator function <b>of</b> <b>CoCoA.</b> Results The N-terminus <b>of</b> <b>CoCoA</b> is covalently modified by SUMO 1 at Lys- 29; both PIAS 1 and ARIP 3 function as E 3 ligases. Fusion of SUMO 1 to the N-terminus (mimicking sumoylation) reduced coactivator function <b>of</b> <b>CoCoA</b> with LEF 1 and the activity of the N-terminal AD. The N- and C-termini <b>of</b> <b>CoCoA</b> can bind to each other, and C-terminal transactivation activity is attenuated {{in the presence of the}} N-terminus, indicating that the N-C interaction regulates the activity of the C-terminal AD. Fusion of SUMO 1 to the N-terminal fragment <b>of</b> <b>CoCoA</b> reduced the N-C interaction and inhibition of C-terminal AD activity by the N-terminal fragment. Conclusion Sumoylation <b>of</b> <b>CoCoA</b> differentially regulates the coactivator activity <b>of</b> <b>CoCoA</b> with nuclear receptors versus LEF 1, by attenuating the N-terminal AD activity and enhancing the activity of the C-terminal AD. </p...|$|R

The multivariate statistical analysis (OSC-PLS-DA) showed clear differences between CC and NC groups.

The model provides good empirical results, and is preferred in specification tests to the partial adjustment model. The results reveal that cocoa supply is significantly influenced by the real producer price <b>of</b> <b>cocoa,</b> real price <b>of</b> maize, the supply of manufactured goods and the real exchange rate. The supply <b>of</b> <b>cocoa</b> was found to be inelastic both in the short and long runs. However, the elasticities obtained in the study suggest that supply <b>of</b> <b>cocoa</b> is more responsive in a shorter time than thought previously. 1...|$|R
50|$|The 2010 {{documentary}} The Dark Side of Chocolate brought {{attention to}} purchases <b>of</b> <b>cocoa</b> beans from Ivorian plantations that use child slave labour. The children are usually 12 to 15 {{years old and}} some are trafficked from nearby countries. The first allegations that child slavery is used in cocoa production appeared in 1998. In late 2000, a BBC documentary reported the use of enslaved children in the production <b>of</b> <b>cocoa</b> in West Africa. Other media followed by reporting widespread child slavery and child trafficking in the production <b>of</b> <b>cocoa.</b> In September 2001, Bradley Alford, Chairman and CEO of Nestlé USA, signed the Harkin-Engel Protocol (commonly called the Cocoa Protocol), an international agreement aimed at ending child labour in the production <b>of</b> <b>cocoa.</b>|$|R
40|$|Water vapour {{distillates}} <b>of</b> <b>cocoa</b> {{are analyzed}} {{by means of}} HPLC. The chromatograph, with a detector wavelength of 280 nm, {{makes it possible to}} detect mainly methylized pyrazines. Concentration ratios between individual pyrazines correlate with the sensorially perceptible roasting degree <b>of</b> <b>cocoa.</b> This correlation applies independently, to a large degree, <b>of</b> the <b>cocoa's</b> origin and processing stage. The method seems suited for industrial quality inspection...|$|R
