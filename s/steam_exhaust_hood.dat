40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} {{the findings from}} research studies carried out over the last 30 years, {{to better understand the}} flows in steam turbine low pressure exhaust hoods and diffusers. The work aims to highlight the areas where further study is still required. A detailed description of the flow structure is outlined and the influence of the last turbine stage and the hood geometry on loss coefficient is explored. At present, the key challenge faced is numerically modeling the three-dimensional, unsteady, transonic, wet <b>steam</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>hood</b> flow given the impractically high computational power requirement. Multiple calculation simplifications to reduce the computational demand have been successfully verified with experimental data, but at present there is no ‘best-practice’ approach to reduce the computational time for routine design exercises. This paper highlights the importance of coupling the exhaust hood to the last stage steam turbine blades to capture the interaction; ensuring the total pressure and swirl angle profiles, along with the tip leakage jet are accurately applied to the diffuser inlet. The nonaxial symmetry of the exhaust hood means {{it is also important to}} model the full blade annulus. More studies have emerged modeling the wet steam and unsteady flow effects, but more work is required in this area to fully understand the impact on the flow structure...|$|E

A test case for LP last stage blades (LSBs) {{with a full}} aerodynamic definition and an accompanying <b>exhaust</b> <b>hood</b> was developed which is representative of current industrial practice. The test case geometry is freely available allowing other researchers to build on this work and {{is the first of}} its kind. Studies on this Durham Stage and <b>Exhaust</b> <b>Hood</b> Test Case showed the geometry produces a representative flow pattern and performance metrics comparable to other published research. Using the test case, the effect of condenser cooling water pressure gradient on the hood flow was computed for the first time. A generic boundary condition was developed to represent the transverse condenser cooling water flow and, when applied to the test case, was shown to have a larger influence on the flow asymmetry within the hood than the tip leakage jet. This thesis describes the first application of the non-linear harmonic (NLH) method to couple the LSBs to the <b>exhaust</b> <b>hood.</b> This method enabled the circumferential non-uniformity which develops in the <b>exhaust</b> <b>hood</b> to be transferred across the interface to the stage, in half the computational demand of the full annulus frozen rotor approach. The first review of the influence of inlet circumferential asymmetry on the hood flow field highlighted that modelling its effect is not as crucial as indicated in the literature, unless the diffuser axial length is very compact or if off-design flows are to be studied. A series of recommendations and guidelines for the CFD modelling of <b>steam</b> turbine <b>exhaust</b> <b>hood</b> flows based on this work are supplied. Experimental validation of the Durham Stage and <b>Exhaust</b> <b>Hood</b> Test Case and a comparison of full unsteady studies with the NLH method should be the next steps in this research...|$|R

The aerodynamic loss of LP <b>exhaust</b> <b>hoods</b> is almost the same as those of the stator and rotor blading in LP steam turbines. Designing high performance LP <b>exhaust</b> <b>hoods</b> should lead further enhancement of steam turbine efficiency. This paper presents the results of <b>exhaust</b> <b>hood</b> computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analyses using last stage exit velocity distributions measured in a full-scale development steam turbine as the inlet boundary condition to improve the accuracy of the CFD analysis. One of the main difficulties in predicting the aerodynamic performance of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>hoods</b> is the unsteady boundary layer separation of <b>exhaust</b> <b>hood</b> diffusers. A highly accurate unsteady numerical analysis is introduced in order to simulate the diffuser flows in LP <b>exhaust</b> <b>hoods.</b> Compressible Navier-Stokes equations and mathematical models for nonequilibrium condensation are solved using the high-order high-resolution finite-difference method based on the fourth-order compact MUSCL TVD scheme, Roe’s approximate Riemann solver, and the LU-SGS scheme.

Studies have shown, that long term exposure to cooking emissions creates adverse health effects for kitchen workers. To {{be able to control}} kitchen environment, improve thermal conditions and remove harmful cooking emissions, <b>exhaust</b> <b>hoods</b> are utilised. Inside an <b>exhaust</b> <b>hood,</b> separation of grease and condensate takes place in order to reduce ventilation maintenance costs and ensure that fire safety and hygienic requirements are met. A number of grease filtering techniques exist, however, the majority of hoods utilise single stage filtering using grease separators.

40|$|The <b>exhaust</b> <b>hood</b> of a <b>steam</b> turbine is a {{vital area}} of {{turbomachinery}} research its performance strongly influences the power output of the last stage blades. It {{is well known that}} accurate CFD simulations are only achieved when the last stage blades are coupled to the <b>exhaust</b> <b>hood</b> to capture the strong interaction. This however presents challenges as the calculation size grows rapidly when the full annulus is calculated. The size of the simulation means researchers are constantly searching of methods to reduce the computational effort without compromising solution accuracy. This work uses a novel approach, by coupling the last stage blades and <b>exhaust</b> <b>hood</b> by the Non-Linear Harmonic Method, a technique widely used to reduce calculation size in high pressure turbine blades and axial compressors. This has been benchmarked against the widely adopted Mixing Plane method. The test case used is the Generic Geometry, a representative <b>exhaust</b> <b>hood</b> and last stage blade geometry that is free from confidentiality and IP restrictions and for which first calculations were presented at last year’s conference [1]. The results show that the non-uniform <b>exhaust</b> <b>hood</b> inlet flow can be captured using the non-liner harmonic method, an effect not previously achievable with single passage coupled calculations such as the mixing plane approach.

40|$|It {{has been}} widely {{recognized}} for some decades that {{it is essential to}} accurately represent the strong coupling between the last stage blades (LSB) and the diffuser inlet, in order to correctly capture the flow through the <b>exhaust</b> <b>hoods</b> of <b>steam</b> turbine low pressure cylinders. This applies to any form of simulation of the flow, i. e., numerical or experimental. The <b>exhaust</b> <b>hood</b> flow structure is highly three-dimensional and appropriate coupling will enable the important influence of this asymmetry to be transferred to the rotor. This, however, presents challenges as the calculation size grows rapidly when the full annulus is calculated. The size of the simulation means researchers are constantly searching for methods to reduce the computational effort without compromising solution accuracy. However, this can result in excessive computational demands in numerical simulations. Unsteady full-annulus CFD calculation will remain infeasible for routine design calculations for the foreseeable future. More computationally efficient methods for coupling the unsteady rotor flow to the hood flow are required that bring computational expense within realizable limits while still maintaining sufficient accuracy for meaningful design calculations. Research activity in this area is focused on developing new methods and techniques to improve accuracy and reduce computational expense. A novel approach for coupling the turbine last stage to the <b>exhaust</b> <b>hood</b> employing the nonlinear harmonic (NLH) method is presented in this paper. The generic, IP free, <b>exhaust</b> <b>hood</b> and last stage blade geometries from Burton et al. (2012. “A Generic Low Pressure <b>Exhaust</b> Diffuser for <b>Steam</b> Turbine Research,”Proceedings of the ASME Turbo Expo, Copenhagen, Denmark, Paper No. GT 2012 - 68485) that are representative of modern designs, are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method. This is achieved by comparing results obtained with the NLH to those obtained with a more conventional mixing-plane approach. The results show that the circumferential asymmetry can be successfully transferred in both directions between the <b>exhaust</b> <b>hood</b> flow and that through the LSB, by using the NLH. This paper also suggests that for <b>exhaust</b> <b>hoods</b> of generous axial length, little change in Cp is observed when the circumferential asymmetry is captured. However, the predicted flow structure is significantly different, which will influence the design and placement of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>hood</b> internal “furniture. ...|$|R

40|$|The <b>exhaust</b> <b>hood</b> of a <b>steam</b> turbine is an {{important}} area of turbomachinery research as its performance strongly influences the power output of the last stage blades (LSB). This paper compares results from 3 D simulations using a novel application of the nonlinear harmonic (NLH) method with more computationally demanding predictions obtained using frozen rotor techniques. Accurate simulation of exhausts is only achieved when simulations of LSB are coupled to the <b>exhaust</b> <b>hood</b> to capture the strong interaction. One such method is the NLH method. In this paper, the NLH approach is compared against the current standard for capturing the inlet circumferential asymmetry, the frozen rotor approach. The NLH method is shown to predict a similar <b>exhaust</b> <b>hood</b> static pressure recovery and flow asymmetry compared with the frozen rotor approach using {{less than half the}} memory requirement of a full annulus calculation. A second option for reducing the computational demand of the full annulus frozen rotor method is explored where a single stator passage is modeled coupled to the full annulus rotor by a mixing plane. Provided the stage is choked, this was shown to produce very similar results to the full annulus frozen rotor approach but with a computational demand {{similar to that of the}} NLH method. In terms of industrial practice, the results show that for a typical well designed <b>exhaust</b> <b>hood</b> at nominal load conditions, the pressure recovery predicted by all methods (including those which do not account for circumferential uniformities) is similar. However, this is not the case at off-design conditions where more complex interfacing methods are required to capture circumferential asymmetry...|$|R

Control of solder fume is generally achieved using local <b>exhaust</b> <b>hoods,</b> simple blowers with a filter or low-volume high-velocity (LVHV) ventilation systems. None of these provide an ideal control system and so a push-pull ventilation design was developed as an alternative. Laboratory tests of the system's capture efficiency were carried out using nitrous oxide tracer gas. Capture efficiency was generally greater than 90 % with the push airflow operating. However, without the push airflow, capture efficiency decreased sharply with increasing distance from the <b>exhaust</b> <b>hood</b> (between 38 and 58 % at 420 mm {{from the front of}} the <b>exhaust</b> <b>hood</b> with the same exhaust airflow used by the push-pull system).

40|$|Local exhaust (LE) {{ventilation}} is a ventilation technique where contaminated air is locally extracted {{close to}} the contaminant source usually with the purpose to reduce the exposure of workers to dust, fumes or vapour, which can be hazardous to their health. The performance of a LE installation depends however on many influential factors, {{and there is not}} yet an international standardized way to test LE constructions. The present study is the natural continuation of some previous studies at the University of Gävle that aimed at contributing to the establishment of such tests. The study entails full scale experimental measurements that include 3 -D air velocity measurements and tracer gas tests in a controlled air turbulence environment generated through physical movements of a vertical, human-sized cylinder. These measurements were focused on human exposure, which was analysed by means of a seated human simulator for different configurations in which the exhaust flow rate, turbulence level, the <b>exhaust</b> <b>hood</b> arrangement and the measuring/injecting distance varied. The use of a sonic 3 -D anemometer, that yielded both magnitude and direction of the air movement, proved very useful in analysing the generated air turbulence. As a measure of the LE performance, PNV value (Percentage of Negative Velocities) was used. This measure represents the percentage of time when the air flow at the measuring point in front of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>hood</b> is directed away from the nozzle, i. e. when the velocity component in the direction towards the <b>exhaust</b> <b>hood</b> opening is negative. Regarding the results obtained, in an otherwise undisturbed environment, measurement data showed that the natural convection from the human simulator {{sitting in front of the}} LE introduces some disturbances of the air flow in the suction region, proportional to the exhaust flow rate. However, when additional turbulence was generated through the controlled movements of the human-sized cylinder, thus creating a controlled turbulence setting, natural human convection leaded to a lower percentage of negative velocities (PNV) in comparison with the case in which human simulator was not present, especially for low exhaust air flow rates and when the <b>exhaust</b> <b>hood</b> was raised from the table. The tracer gas tests implied injection of a neutrally buoyant tracer gas through a perforated sphere placed in front of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>hood.</b> The amount of tracer gas that escaped from the suction flow was measured both in the room air and in the breathing zone. The first measurements yielded a sensitive method for measuring the capture efficiency (CE) of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>hood.</b> The CE is the percentage of injected tracer gas that is directly captured by the <b>exhaust</b> <b>hood.</b> This parameter showed that although the  convection flow generated by the human simulator leads to low PNV values, it seems that the tracer gas is not actually being captured, but trapped in that convection flow. As a consequence, PNV and CE get a strong correlation, which is even more intense when injection and capture point are closer together. Hence, PNV represents a good alternative to tracer gas measurements only if the relationship between the correlation of PNV and CE with respect to the distance from the injection to the capture point is known. Finally, measurements of tracer gas in the breathing zone showed random, short and high exposures when turbulence was generated and those exposures got worse by natural human convection...|$|R

Many households equipped their kitchens with a range <b>exhaust</b> <b>hood,</b> with make up air drawn into the kitchen through an open window.

Bergen University College has an engine lab where students and employees use thermal engines, mainly diesel and gasoline engines, for experiments and research. Although the school building was new in 2014 and current sound regulations should have been fulfilled, faults have been found in the sound attenuation in the exhaust system and the engine room. Sound measurements were conducted at the <b>exhaust</b> <b>hood</b> on the roof of the 4 th floor to survey the sound level in the office building on the 5 th floor, which is retracted on the main roof. The <b>exhaust</b> <b>hood</b> is placed outside the windows of the office on the 5 th floor. Analysis of the sound measurements according to current Norwegian standards found that the noise level due to the noise from the <b>exhaust</b> <b>hood</b> was 32 dB(A) higher than allowed at outside the window and 20 dB(A) higher than allowed inside office D 509. Thus the exhaust system does not meet noise requirements for technical systems. Sound power from the <b>exhaust</b> <b>hood</b> was calculated from measurements, and the damping required to meet the current sound regulations was found. In this thesis one argues for the installation of a combined reflection and absorbation silencer LSAD 1 from Tio B. V in the exhaust duct. This will attenuate the sound effect to 61 dB(A) wich means that sound regulations at the facade will be met. This also means that the sound level inside the office will be within the requirements.

It is proposed to install new dampers on the engine itself. These dampers are called Triflex 55 shore. Most of the vibrations will then be absorbed.
