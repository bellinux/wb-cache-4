40|$|Abstract: A {{queueing}} {{system with}} two parallel heterogenous channels without waiting is considered. In this queueing system customer arrivals are Poisson distributed with rate. Each customer has exponentially distributed service time with 	 (= 1, 2) parameter at − ℎ channel. When a customer arrives this system if both the <b>service</b> <b>channels</b> are available, the customer has service with or = 1 − probabilities {{at first and}} second <b>service</b> <b>channels</b> respectively. If one of the <b>service</b> <b>channels</b> is available, the customer has service at this <b>service</b> <b>channel</b> or leaves the system without being served if both of the <b>service</b> <b>channels</b> are busy. We have obtained mean waiting time and mean number of customers {{of the system and}} a simulation of this system is performed...|$|R

40|$|The {{failure of}} a {{telecommunications}} central office in Hinsdale, Illinois, in May 1988 caused widespread service outages and brought the local economy to a virtual halt. In the process it highlighted the emerging market for back-up networks. At present local exchange carriers are obliged to offer a free <b>stand-by</b> <b>service</b> to customers who choose an alternative network for regular use. This conceals the true market value of this 'insurance' service, and should be ended. The author argues that local exchange carriers should vigorously enter the market for 'faultless' networks by offering a range of back-up options for their own primary service, just as the automotive and consumer products industries do. ...|$|R

We compare {{the performance of the}} proposed protocol with that of IEEE 1609. 4 and Asynchronous Multichannel Coordination Protocol (AMCP), in terms of throughput on control and <b>service</b> <b>channels,</b> channel utilization, and the penetration rate of successfully broadcast emergency messages. We demonstrate that AMCMAC outperforms IEEE 1609. 4 and AMCP in terms of system throughput by increasing the utilization of control <b>channel</b> and <b>service</b> <b>channels.</b> In addition, AMCMAC mitigates both the multi-channel hidden terminal and missing receiver problems which occur in asynchronous multichannel MAC protocols. ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this article}} is to {{delineate}} a number of different disintermediation mechanisms within the context of business-to-business (B 2 B) <b>service</b> <b>channels</b> and to identify the specific challenges associated with adopting these mechanisms. Methodology: The research was conducted in accordance with abductive reasoning, moving continuously between the empirical world of 4 industrial (B 2 B) firms and the model world. Findings: This article delineates a choice of 6 disintermediation mechanisms and their attendant challenges within the context of industrial <b>service</b> <b>channels.</b> Contribution: The article provides an original conceptualization of disintermediation, which is detached from the traditional understanding of the concept. As such, it constitutes a useful starting point for the development of a formal theory of disintermediation. Implications for Practice: This article should be useful for practitioners, because it presents various disintermediation options available to industrial firms faced by undesired intermediaries in their industrial <b>service</b> <b>channels.</b> faced by undesired intermediaries in their industrial <b>service</b> <b>channels...</b>|$|R
