25|$|The semi-resonant start circuit {{was invented}} by Thorn Lighting for use with T12 {{fluorescent}} tubes. This method uses a double wound transformer and a capacitor. With no arc current, the transformer and capacitor resonate at line frequency and generate about twice the supply voltage across the tube, and a small electrode heating current. This tube voltage is too low to strike the arc with cold electrodes, but as the electrodes heat up to thermionic emission temperature, the tube <b>striking</b> <b>voltage</b> falls below that of the ringing voltage, and the arc strikes. As the electrodes heat, the lamp slowly, over three to five seconds, reaches full brightness. As the arc current increases and tube voltage drops, the circuit provides current limiting.|$|E

40|$|Lightning {{strike is}} a {{dangerous}} natural phenomenon that can cause various problems. Telecommunication subscriber lines (TSLs) and electrical power lines are two systems that are almost always affected by nearby lightning <b>strikes.</b> <b>Voltages</b> in the telecommunication subscriber line (TSL) do get induced by nearby lightning <b>strikes.</b> The induced <b>voltage</b> can be carefully measured and lightning parameters such as the lightning current wave shape, lightning peak current and strike locations be reproduced. Better designs of lightning protection systems can be realised if data on lightning strike distribution in a given region is known. Commercial lightning mapping or locating systems are based on several technologies (Araujo, 2001; Kenneth, 2003). The two most popular methods are those based on the Time of Arrival (ToA) and the Directional Finder (DF) principles. An example of the lightning locating system (LLS) based on the ToA method is the country- wide LLS owned by the Malaysian national power company (TNB). The system is capable of determining the coordinates of the cloud-to-ground lightning strikes within 500 m accuracy. However, for a localised distribution of lightning, say within 1 square km area, this accuracy is too large for the data to be meaningful...|$|R

Additionally, the circuit power factor is almost 1.0, and no additional power factor correction is needed in the lighting installation. As the design requires that twice the supply voltage must be lower than the cold-cathode <b>striking</b> <b>voltage</b> (or the tubes would erroneously instant-start), this design cannot be used with [...] AC power unless the tubes are at least [...] length.

If the shaft is exposed, a shock hazard {{to the user}} exists, and the internal construction of the tester provides no protection against short-circuit faults.

Even if an internal short circuit does not electrocute the user, the resulting electric shock {{may result in a}} fall or other injury. The lamp provides no indication below the <b>strike</b> <b>voltage</b> of the neon lamp, and so cannot detect certain hazardous leakage conditions. Since it relies on capacitance to complete the circuit, direct-current potential cannot be reliably indicated. If the user of the screwdriver is themselves isolated from ground and capacitively coupled to other nearby live wires, a false negative may occur when they test a live circuit, and a false positive when they test a dead circuit.

Topological insulators (TIs) have been recognized as a promising electrically controlled spin source thanks to the strong spin-orbit coupling and in particular, the spin-momentum locked topological surface states (TSS) supporting helically spin polarized currents. Many TI materials such as Bi-based chalcogenides are also layered 2 D materials and can be incorporated into van der Waals (vdW) coupled heterostructures, opening the possibility of the utilization of TIs for electrical spin injection into other 2 D materials. Here, we demonstrate electrical injection of helically spin-polarized current into graphene through a 3 D TI in a mechanically stacked heterostructure between Bi 2 Te 2 Se (a TI) and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) -grown graphene, using the spin potentiometric measurement. When a dc current is flowing from the TI to graphene, we detect a <b>striking</b> step-like <b>voltage</b> change (spin signal) in both the TI and graphene using ferromagnetic (FM) probes. The sign of the spin signal can be reversed by reversing the direction of the dc bias current, and the corresponding amplitude of the spin signal increases linearly with the bias current, indicative of a current-induced helical spin polarization in both TI and graphene. In contrast, the graphene itself exhibits usual nonlocal spin valve signal when the spins are injected using an FM electrode. We discuss possible origins of the helical spin polarization injected into the graphene in our TI/graphene heterostructure that may include TSS as well as the spin-orbit coupled Rashba states.

A surge arrester may be compared to a relief valve on a boiler or hot water heater. It will release high pressure until a normal operating condition is reached.

When a high voltage (greater than the normal line voltage) exists on the line, the arrester immediately furnishes a path to ground and thus limits and drains off the excess voltage.

This article describes a two-transistor push-pull design at the commonly used frequency of 40. 68 MHz, comparing its performance with a design using push-pull MOS-FETS using the MRF 151 or BLF 177. The design of a reliable laser driver involves ensuring that the RF power amplifier (RFPA) is stable and protected from mismatches that can vary from a voltage standing ratio (VSWR) of 1 : 1 to as high as 20 : 1 at any phase angle of the reflection coefficient. The RFPA must be able to strike the laser when its VSWR is highest. Normally, the RFPA cable length between the RFPA and laser is selected for the best <b>striking</b> <b>voltage</b> across the laser resonant circuit.

40|$|The voltage {{transients}} generated {{during the}} breaker operations in cable systems, for instance, a wind park collection grid, can reach very low rise times. The rise times of these transients can be almost 50 times {{shorter than the}} rise time of a lightning pulse. Such transients can generate a very high voltage stress on the internal transformers insulation. In this paper, a test case is studied using verified models {{of different types of}} transformers and wind turbine layouts in order to account for typical wind turbine layouts found in modern wind farms. A critical switching scenario is chosen in order to provoke the highest possible voltage transients during a current interruption. Furthermore, internal overvoltages are estimated using model of a similarly sized winding. Simulations show that the magnitude of the voltage transients is higher than the basic lightning impulse insulation level (BIL) defined by present standards. Moreover, it is found that the rise time of the voltage surges is much shorter than the rise time of the lightning pulse. The shortest rise time of 40 ns is obtained in a wind turbine layout where the wind turbine breaker is placed near the transformer. Due to very short rise times of the transients, very high internal overvoltages are estimated in dry-type transformer windings. These internal overvoltages are much higher than overvoltages recorded at the basic lightning impulse level. For a wind turbine layout where a breaker is placed {{in the bottom of a}} tower and a dry-type transformer in a nacelle, the highest turn-to-turn voltage of about 1. 5 pu is estimated. This is almost 4 times higher turn-to-turn voltage then the voltage obtained during the BIL test.
