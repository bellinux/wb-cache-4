50|$|While {{studies have}} shown the effects of <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> to be {{detrimental}} to all inmates, <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> of women has particular consequences for women that may differ from the way it affects men. <b>Solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> rates {{for women in the}} United States are roughly comparable to those for men and about 20% of prisoners will be in <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> at some point during their prison career.|$|R
40|$|As of 2005, about 80, 000 {{prisoners were}} housed in <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> in jails and {{in state and}} federal prisons in the United States. Prisoners in <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> are {{generally}} housed in a cell for twenty-two to twenty-four hours a day with little human contact or interaction. The number of prisoners held in <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> increased 40 percent between 1995 and 2000, in comparison to the growth in the total prison population of 28 percent. Concurrently, the duration of time that prisoners spend in <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> also increased: nationally, most prisoners in <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> spend more than five years there. The effects of <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> on prisoners have been a source of growing concern, but the question of whether <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> affects public safety and recidivism has received less attention. While lower courts have imposed constitutional limitations on the use of <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement,</b> in the modern era the Supreme Court has never held that the practice is unconstitutional. Therefore, this Note argues for policy reforms to counteract the harmful impact of <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> on public safety and recidivism, informed by the constitutional standards for its use in prisons...|$|R
50|$|Dr. Eisenman, an Art History {{professor}} and activist, {{who is involved}} in many “stop max” movements centered in Illinois, studies <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> and explains its eventual decline. Since the 1800s <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> was practiced in the penitentiary systems and its implementation and popularity at various prisons grew throughout the centuries. The practice of <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> grew partly because of stigmatizing language {{used to refer to}} certain prisoners like ‘the worst of the worst,’ which became a form of “self-justifying the logic of torture”. Yet, as the use of <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> progressed, public discourse around <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> transitioned from a legitimate form of punishment to torture. Because many prisoners in <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> suffered severe mental and physical illnesses, Eisenman describes {{that by the end of}} the nineteenth century “prisoner isolation and sensory deprivation were widely understood to be forms of torture”. Therefore, human rights groups condemned the use of <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> or ‘supermax’ systems, and national and local ‘stop max’ movements have initiated in America and worldwide to stop the use of <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Litigating against <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> on {{the basis}} of the Fourteenth Amendment and due process is another less common {{strategy}} inmates have used. The Fourteenth Amendment limits the “types of prisoners” that can be placed in <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> and the time the prisoners can be confined. [...] The due process clause within the Fourteenth Amendment also regulates <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> in that prisoners must be given reviews before and during their placement in <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement.</b> [...] Court cases made on these bases do not necessarily address any “underlying problems” of <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement,</b> but they do call for increased monitoring, hearing, and reviews.|$|R
50|$|The {{legality}} of <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> has been frequently challenged {{over the past}} sixty years as conceptions surrounding the practice have changed. Much of the legal discussion concerning <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> has centered {{on whether or not}} it constitutes torture or cruel and unusual punishment. While international law has generally begun to discourage <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement’s</b> use in penal institutions, opponents of <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> have been less successful at challenging it within the United States legal system.|$|R
50|$|Proponents of <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> propound that <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> {{can improve}} the safety of inmates and prison staff. Earlier {{justifications}} for <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> in the mid 20th century included protection for a prisoner whose sexual orientation, religion, or race were far too different and seen as vulnerable to attack from fellow inmates.|$|R
50|$|In total, Browder spent {{approximately}} 800 of over 1,000 days on Rikers Island in <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement.</b> His longest {{duration of}} <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> was 17 months.|$|R
5000|$|Recognizing {{that the}} amount of proof needed to show that <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> violates prisoners’ rights “is simply too high to trigger {{constitutional}} protections,” attorneys have started to approach <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> from a different angle. John F. Cockrell, a recent graduate from the University of Alabama School of Law, suggests that those who challenge <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> do so in context of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA). [...] Cockrell reasons that [...] When claims under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments fail, Title II the ADA may offer an avenue to improve the provision of services to the mentally ill in prisons and <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement,</b> but ipso facto improving the conditions under which all inmates in <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> live.|$|R
50|$|One former Central ward {{wrote about}} his {{experience}} in <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> in 1962. Into the 2000s, former inmates recalled being placed in <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> at Central.|$|R
50|$|The use of {{long-term}} <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement,</b> {{along with other}} grievances, has triggered organized resistance from prisoners and advocacy groups in the United States. Prisoners in California and elsewhere have launched hunger strikes, citing cruel and unusual uses of <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> as a major reason. Hundreds of prisoners in the United States, acting through the Center for Human Rights and Constitutional Law, have in 2012 filed a petition against <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> at the United Nations. The petition alleges that <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> constitutes torture {{and should be addressed}} by the international community.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> is {{becoming}} more and more popular throughout the states with some [...] "supermax" [...] prisons have nothing but <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> cells. [...] "Some people are held in <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> in special “supermax” prisons, such as California’s Pelican Bay, Virginia’s Red Onion, and the federal government’s ADX in Florence, Colorado. At least 44 states and the federal system now have supermax prisons, which are generally composed solely of <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> cells. Other prisoners live in SHUs, RHUs, and IMUs within ordinary prisons, and even inside local jails." ...|$|R
50|$|The first {{comment by}} the Supreme Court of the United States about <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement's</b> effect on {{prisoner}} mental status {{was made in}} 1890 (In re Medley 134 U.S. 160). In it {{the court found that}} the use of <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> produced reduced mental and physical capabilities. The use of <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> in prisons was first introduced to regulate unruly prisoners and keep them away {{from the rest of the}} prison society (Haney, Craig; Lynch, Mona). However, <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> has been linked to several developments of mental disorders, one of which being Ganser syndrome. A man developed Ganser syndrome after being held in <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> for a long term sentence; however, that development is seen as rare and is unlikely in most cases.|$|R
5000|$|In {{more recent}} years, UN representatives have {{strengthened}} {{their efforts to}} stop <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> from being used worldwide. The urgency with which representatives have undertaken these efforts {{is largely due to}} the UN Special Rapporteurs on Torture, Manfred Nowak and Juan Méndez. Nowak and Méndez have both [...] "repeatedly unequivocally stated that prolonged <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> is cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, and may amount to torture". [...] Nowak and Méndez have been especially critical of long-term or prolonged <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement,</b> which they define as lasting fifteen days or more. Their authority and explicit characterization of <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> as cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment has led the UN to include long-term to indefinite <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> in the group of practices that violate the provisions outlined in the UDHR, ICCPR, and CAT. <b>Solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> lasting {{for a short period of}} time, however, is allowed under international law when used as a last resort, though Nowak, Mendez, and many other UN representatives believe that the practice should be abolished altogether.|$|R
50|$|Since the 1980s, the New York City Department of Correction has {{increased}} the use of segregation as a discipline and management tool. In effect, segregation is a secondary sentence imposed by the correctional facility, which is usually unrelated to the conviction for which the person is incarcerated. There are high rates of use of <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> in New York {{when compared to other}} U.S. states. Within the New York prison system, <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> is frequently imposed for nonviolent, “trivial prisoner offenses.” Usually the common misconception is that <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> is a punishment of last resort, reserved for inmates who present a threat of violence or escape. Inmates that are released from <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> go through a “transitional unit” but failure in the program results in their return to <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement.</b> Overall, most of the inmates fail and return to <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement.</b> New York has the highest rate of “disciplinary segregation” in the country, making <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> a regular every day action among the prison. Although prisons nationwide have decreased use of <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement,</b> the New York City Department of Correction expanded its capacity by 27 percent in 2011 and another 44 percent in 2012, according to the NYC Jails Action Coalition. Although the DOC housed 1,000 more inmates in 1990 than it does today, its jails have more solitary cells now. Due to this the city is topping the charts of municipalities with a high rate of <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement.</b> On any given day, there are about 4,500 men, women, and children in some form of isolated confinement in New York State prisons. This is not including New York City’s jails, which are run under a separate system, where those in <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> reach close to 1,000 or more.|$|R
50|$|On August 28, 2014, a law {{was passed}} {{boosting}} oversight {{of the use of}} <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> at Rikers Island, following intense public outcry after various abuses at the prison. The law requires the prison to publish quarterly reports on their use of <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement,</b> but did not include provisions regarding the protection of prisoners against guard brutality or limiting the use of <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> as a punishment.|$|R
5000|$|The United Nations Special Rapporteur on torture, Juan E. Méndez, has {{requested}} that the United States stop holding prisoners in <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> as [...] "it often causes mental and physical suffering or humiliation, amounting to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, and if the resulting pain or sufferings are severe, <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> even amounts to torture." [...] The U.N. estimates there are about 80,000 prisoners in <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> in the U.S., and 12,000 of those are in California. Two prisoners at the Angola prison in Louisiana, Herman Wallace and Albert Woodfox, have each spent more than 40 years in <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement.</b>|$|R
50|$|In the U.S., {{opponents of}} <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> have argued (with varying success) that the {{practice}} violates prisoners’ Constitutional rights. Despite {{the long history of}} litigation over the practice, the Supreme Court has yet to definitively state whether or not <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> is unconstitutional. The Supreme Court considered the constitutionality of long-term <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> only once in the ‘‘Wilkinson v. Austin'’ case. In contrast to the Supreme Court’s inaction, lower courts of the U.S. have imposed constitutional limitations on the use of <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement.</b> Despite such limitations, the federal courts have refused to find that <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> is per se unconstitutional. The U.S. has also effectively “insulated itself from any official sanction for international violations by not submitting to the jurisdiction” of committees that enforce the ICCPR or CAT.|$|R
50|$|Throughout {{the twentieth}} century, the United Nations' stance on <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> has become {{increasingly}} oppositional. International law has reflected this change, and UN monitoring {{has led to a}} major reduction of <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement.</b>|$|R
50|$|Belbenoît and Charrière {{also related}} their {{experiences}} within <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> slightly differently, with the description given by Belbenoît not being {{as severe as}} that by Charrière. Most notably Belbenoît states that all those in <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> were let out of their cells for one hour per day for fresh air and exercise, whereas Charrière stated that those in <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> were locked up for 24 hours a day.|$|R
50|$|<b>Solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> {{has been}} {{traditionally}} {{used as a}} behavioral reform of isolating prisoners physically, emotionally and mentally {{in order to control}} and change inmate behavior. Recently arrived inmates are more likely to violate prison rules than their inmate counterparts and thus {{are more likely to be}} put in <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement.</b> Additionally, individual attributes and environmental factors combine to increase an inmate's likelihood of being put into <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to examine whether {{psychopathology}} (schizophrenia, paranoia, and depression), trauma (child and adult abuse), and psychopathy could successfully predict placement in <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement.</b> Previous research suggests that these factors are associated with a high rate of disciplinary infractions and/or violence among inmates and this behavior jeopardizes prison order. These inmates are usually placed in <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement,</b> which can have detrimental effects. There were 152 male inmates included in the present study who were randomly selected at intake from Coffee Creek Correctional Facility. Data were collected through a variety of assessments and prison records regarding psychopathology, trauma history, and psychopathy as predictor variables and disciplinary infractions and <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> as criterion variables. The results indicated that only psychopathy could significantly predict placement in <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement.</b> Neither psychopathology nor trauma history was significantly related to placement in <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement.</b> Limitations of the study include limited generalizations to racial minorities and attrition/missing data. Future research suggestions include expanding treatment for psychopathy, and the relationship between psychopathology, trauma, psychopathy and placement in <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{long-term}} <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> {{of prisoners}} causes fundamentally debilitative psychological damage. This violence, inherent to the socio-spatial organization of <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement,</b> diminishes prisoners' capacity {{to function as}} human beings. Yet while violence might characterize the ends of <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement,</b> individuation defines the means. This paper argues that <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement,</b> while an extreme case, shares crucial characteristics with other spaces, structures, and modes of organization familiar to Western society. The actual experiences of prisoners subjected to conditions of total isolation, moreover, contradict the prevailing ontology of the individuated subject. The irreconcilability of this paradox invites inquiry into the political and material problematic of individualism itself. The violence of <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement's</b> spatial practice therefore holds important implications for a critical reassessment of any or all socially isolating institutions and individuating ideologies within the structural fabric of modern life...|$|R
40|$|<b>Solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> is a {{frequently}} used penal tool in all fifty states against {{all types of}} offenders. However, since its development in the 1800 s, <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> {{has been found to}} have damaging psychological effects. Juvenile inmates in particular suffer the greatest psychological damage from <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> because their brains are still in a developmental state. This has led many to propose various reforms that would either end or limit the use of <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> for those under the age of eighteen. However, new neurological studies on brain development show that inmates between the ages of eighteen and twenty-five also suffer similar psychological harms and therefore should be included in these reforms. Pulling from these new neurological studies, this Note proposes federal legislation that would limit the use of <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> for inmates under the age of twenty-five...|$|R
40|$|While the harms {{caused by}} <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> and its overuse in American prisons have gained {{increased}} recognition {{over the last}} decade, most {{states and the federal}} government maintain that extensive <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> is both necessary and appropriate for those people deemed “the worst of the worst. ” As a result, many of those who have been so labeled have languished in <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> for years or even decades. With limited exceptions, they are there with the blessing of the federal courts, which have generally held that even very lengthy periods of <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> do not violate the Eighth Amendment’s Cruel and Unusual Punishments clause. In this Article, I examine a Norwegian court’s holding that Anders Behring Breivik’s long-term <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> violates the European Convention on Human Rights to consider the lessons it holds for American Eighth Amendment conditions of confinement jurisprudence...|$|R
5000|$|The penal {{system in}} the United States {{developed}} under two separate systems known as the Auburn system and Pennsylvania system. The current system of <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> was derived originally from the Pennsylvania model which was characterized by [...] "isolation and seclusion." [...] Evidence has shown that Quakers and Calvinists supported <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> as an alternative form of punishment. At {{the time it was}} meant to provide a prisoner with solitude “to reflect on his misdeeds” and restore his relationship with God. <b>Solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> was intended as an alternative to public floggings which were common at the time. In 1818, New York reformer and Friend, Thomas Eddy, lobbied for inmate labor and <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> in place of other forms of punishment such as hanging. Shortly after, New York decided to include <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> and inmate labor into their penal system.|$|R
5000|$|Evan Ebel {{had spent}} much of his time in prison in <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement.</b> Tom Clements' successor, Rick Raemisch, has said [...] "Whatever <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> did to that former inmate and murderer, it was not for the better." ...|$|R

25|$|Formally {{known as}} the Special Correction Unit (SCU), the <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> cells were {{commonly}} called “the Penthouse” by inmates and staff, partly due to their location {{on the top floor}} of one of the cell blocks. (The Penthouse had been built in 1963 to replace the old <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> cells that were in the basement, which were known as “the Hole”.) BC Penitentiary's <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> cells were known as being particularly brutal for a modern prison.|$|R
50|$|Some {{prisoners were}} held in <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> cells for two to five days where they were {{physically}} abused and forced to listen to Chetnik songs for days on end. While the beatings of those in confinement could not be seen by other prisoners, they were heard and the victims had to be dragged out, as some could not even walk for seven to ten days after <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement.</b> One prisoner was held for four months in <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement.</b>|$|R

50|$|Misuse of <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> {{has been}} widely controversial. In {{immigration}} detention centers, reports have surfaced concerning its use against detainees {{in order to keep}} those knowledgeable about their rights away from other detainees. In the prison-industrial complex itself, reports of <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> as punishment in work labor prisons have also summoned much criticism. One issue prison reform activists have fought against is the use of Security Housing Units (extreme forms of <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement).</b> They argue that they do not rehabilitate inmates but rather serve only to cause inmates psychological harm. Further reports of placing prisoners into <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> based on sexual orientation, race and religion have been an ongoing but very contentious subject in the last century.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the past}} few years, several {{internal}} committees and administrative bodies involved in the United States prison and legal systems have also begun to question <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement’s</b> legality.

40|$|This thesis {{examined}} the United States’ ability to circumvent international and constitutional law {{in regards to}} <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> in American prisons. Drawing on scholarship examining inmates’ rights and inmates’ resistance movements, international human rights doctrine, United States constitutional law, activist led movements, and inmate testimony, the thesis demonstrates that the United States is able to simultaneously claim that it is meeting its human rights violations while resisting reforms to both state and federal current policy of warehousing inmates in <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> for decades at a time through two strategies. First, the United States utilizes framing strategies to deny the use of <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> by framing it as a necessary housing policy to guarantee safety and security within the prison. Second, the United States uses continually changing rhetoric to label <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> as segregation. These two strategies allow the United States to avoid both constitutional challenges {{to the use of}} <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> and meeting its obligations under international human rights agreements...|$|R
