5|$|All eight {{lines of}} the Oslo Commuter Rail have <b>some</b> <b>or</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> their {{services}} operate through the tunnel, although many of these terminate at Skøyen. The Airport Express Train operates four hourly services through the tunnel and the Norwegian State Railways operate regional trains along the Vestfold Line and intercity trains along the Sørland Line and Bergen Line through the tunnel. Freight trains along the Sørland Line operate through the tunnel, although only at night, while freight trains along the Bergen Line do not, instead using the Roa–Hønefoss Line.|$|E
5|$|Alternatively {{pig iron}} {{may be made}} into steel (with up to about 2% carbon) or wrought iron (commercially pure iron). Various {{processes}} {{have been used for}} this, including finery forges, puddling furnaces, Bessemer converters, open hearth furnaces, basic oxygen furnaces, and electric arc furnaces. In all cases, the objective is to oxidize <b>some</b> <b>or</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the carbon, together with other impurities. On the other hand, other metals may be added to make alloy steels.|$|E
5|$|Female genital {{mutilation}} (FGM), {{also known as}} female genital cutting and female circumcision, is the ritual cutting or removal of <b>some</b> <b>or</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the external female genitalia. The practice is found in Africa, Asia and the Middle East, and within communities from countries in which FGM is common. UNICEF estimated in 2016 that 200 million women living today in 30 countries—27 African countries, Indonesia, Iraqi Kurdistan and Yemen—have undergone the procedures.|$|E

5|$|In China, {{nationalist}} and communist forces resumed {{the civil}} war in June 1946. Communist forces were victorious and established the People's Republic of China on the mainland, while nationalist forces retreated to Taiwan in 1949. In the Middle East, the Arab rejection of the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine and the creation of Israel marked the escalation of the Arab–Israeli conflict. While European powers attempted to retain <b>some</b> <b>or</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> their colonial empires, their losses of prestige and resources during the war rendered this unsuccessful, leading to decolonisation.|$|E
5|$|In June 2010 diving {{operations}} {{were carried out}} and the survey report indicated that the aircraft was largely complete, although 5K+AR lay inverted on the seabed, indicating that it ground-looped on landing. The port rudder, starboard stabiliser, forward nose glazing, undercarriage doors and engine cowling were missing, but {{the discovery of a}} small debris field associated with the wreck indicates that <b>some</b> <b>or</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> those parts may still be present at the site. Some items, including two of the Dornier's six MG 15 machine guns, are missing and are believed to have been stolen by unauthorized divers sometime after the aircraft's discovery.|$|E
5|$|In many bathhouses the {{customer}} has {{a choice between}} renting a room or a locker, often for fixed periods of up to 12 hours. A room typically consists of a locker and a single bed (though doubles are sometimes available) with a thin vinyl mat supported on a simple wooden box or frame, an arrangement that facilitates easy cleaning between patrons. In many bathhouses (particularly those outside the United States), <b>some</b> <b>or</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the rooms are freely available to all patrons.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} tenth century, the East Anglian Danes came under {{increasing}} pressure from Edward the Elder, king of Wessex. In 902 Edward's cousin Æthelwold ætheling, {{who had been}} driven into exile after an unsuccessful bid for the throne, arrived in Essex after a stay in Northumbria. He was apparently accepted as king by <b>some</b> <b>or</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the Danes in England and in 903 he induced the East Anglian Danes to wage war on Edward. This ended in disaster, {{with the death of}} Æthelwold and of Eohric of East Anglia in a battle in the Fens.|$|E
5|$|Most {{amphibians}} today remain semiaquatic, {{living the}} first stage of their lives as fish-like tadpoles. Several groups of tetrapods, such as the snakes and cetaceans, have lost <b>some</b> <b>or</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> their limbs. In addition, many tetrapods have returned to partially aquatic or fully aquatic lives throughout the history of the group (modern examples of fully aquatic tetrapods include cetaceans and sirenians). The first returns to an aquatic lifestyle may have occurred as early as the Carboniferous Period whereas other returns occurred as recently as the Cenozoic, as in cetaceans, pinnipeds, and several modern amphibians.|$|E
5|$|Shoe polish {{consists}} of a waxy colloidal emulsion, a substance composed {{of a number of}} partially immiscible liquids and solids mixed together. It is usually made from ingredients including <b>some</b> <b>or</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> naphtha, lanolin, turpentine, wax (often Carnauba wax), gum arabic, ethylene glycol, and if required a colourant, such as carbon black or an azo dye (such as aniline yellow). It typically has a specific gravity of 0.8, is negligibly soluble in water, and is made of between 65 and 77% volatile substances—usually naphtha. The high amount of volatile substances means that the shoe polish will dry out and harden after application, while retaining its shine.|$|E

5|$|Stories {{were told}} of Boone making one last visit to Kentucky {{to pay off}} his creditors, {{although}} <b>some</b> <b>or</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> these tales may be folklore. American painter John James Audubon claimed to have gone hunting with Boone in the woods of Kentucky around 1810. Years later, Audubon painted a portrait of Boone, supposedly from memory, although skeptics have noted the similarity of this painting to the well-known portraits by Chester Harding. Boone's family insisted he never returned to Kentucky after 1799, although some historians believe Boone visited his brother Squire near Kentucky in 1810 and have therefore reported Audubon's story as factual.|$|E
5|$|Surface {{decompression}} is {{a procedure}} in which <b>some</b> <b>or</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the staged decompression obligation {{is done in}} a decompression chamber instead of in the water. This reduces {{the time that the}} diver spends in the water, exposed to environmental hazards such as cold water or currents, which will enhance diver safety. The decompression in the chamber is more controlled, in a more comfortable environment, and oxygen can be used at greater partial pressure as there is no risk of drowning and a lower risk of oxygen toxicity convulsions. A further operational advantage is that once the divers are in the chamber, new divers can be supplied from the diving panel, and the operations can continue with less delay.|$|E
5|$|These plugins {{are usually}} easy {{to install and}} can change almost {{everything}} in the game. Plugins can include new creatures, weapons, armor, quests, people, playable species, Easter eggs, stores, player-owned houses, cities, expand {{on the size of}} cities, and introduce new plotlines, and entire landmasses with <b>some</b> <b>or</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the above. Organized projects, such as Tamriel Rebuilt and , attempt to recreate the originally envisioned Morrowind province and other parties of Tamriel, as seen in other The Elder Scrolls games. For example, there are interpretations of both Cyrodiil and Skyrim, the settings of later The Elder Scrolls games.|$|E

5|$|While Strez's murder meant {{an end to}} the Latin–Bulgarian campaign, Stefan did not {{undertake}} a campaign into Macedonia due to the proximity of the coalition troops, which had halted at Niš. In 1217, all of Strez's territory was under the Epirote rule of Theodore Komnenos Doukas, though Boril may have controlled <b>some</b> <b>or</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> it in the meantime. The Serbs failed to take advantage of Strez's death as far as they did not manage to acquire any of his former domains.|$|E
5|$|Approximately {{three-quarters of}} all extant strepsirrhine species are nocturnal, {{sleeping}} in nests made from dead leaves or tree hollows during the day. All of the lorisoids from continental Africa and Asia are nocturnal, a circumstance that minimizes their {{competition with the}} simian primates of the region, which are diurnal. The lemurs of Madagascar, living {{in the absence of}} simians, are more variable in their activity cycles. The aye-aye, mouse lemurs, woolly lemurs, and sportive lemurs are nocturnal, while ring-tailed lemurs and most of their kin, sifakas, and indri are diurnal. Yet <b>some</b> <b>or</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the brown lemurs (Eulemur) are cathemeral, which means that they may be active during the day or night, depending on factors such as temperature and predation. Many extant strepsirrhines are well adapted for nocturnal activity due to their relatively large eyes; large, movable ears; sensitive tactile hairs; strong sense of smell; and the tapetum lucidum behind the retina. Among the adapiforms, most are considered diurnal, with the exception of Pronycticebus and Godinotia from Middle Eocene Europe, both of which had large orbits that suggest nocturnality.|$|E
5|$|From the Greek {{word for}} pan pipes, σύριγξ, {{it is the}} vocal organ of birds. Located {{at the base of}} a bird's trachea, it {{produces}} sounds without the vocal folds of mammals. The sound is produced by vibrations of <b>some</b> <b>or</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the membrana tympaniformis (the walls of the syrinx) and the pessulus, caused by air flowing through the syrinx. This sets up a self-oscillating system that modulates the airflow creating the sound. The muscles modulate the sound shape by changing the tension of the membranes and the bronchial openings. The syrinx enables some species of birds (such as parrots, crows, and mynas) to mimic human speech. Unlike the larynx of mammals, the syrinx is located where the trachea forks into the lungs. Thus, lateralization of bird song is possible and some songbirds can produce more than one sound at a time.|$|E

50|$|Adenosine {{diphosphate}} (ADP) receptor inhibitor is a {{class of}} antiplatelet agents. These drugs inhibit <b>some</b> <b>or</b> <b>all</b> types <b>of</b> adenosine diphosphate receptors (P2Y receptors). P2Y receptors are a family of purinergic G protein-coupled receptors, stimulated by nucleotides such as ATP, ADP, UTP, UDP and UDP-glucose.|$|R
