2500|$|Some {{believe the}} police covered up what happened. On January 1, Liston's wife called Johnny Tocco {{and said she}} hadn't heard from her husband in three days and was worried. A few years before Tocco died, he {{allegedly}} told his good friend, Tony Davi, {{that he went to}} Liston's house and found the door locked and his car in the driveway. Tocco called the police, and they broke into the house. Tocco said that the living room furniture was in disarray, but the house did not yet smell of death. He said they found Sonny lying on his bed with a needle sticking out of his arm. Johnny left the house before the police did. [...] "Johnny wasn't a braggart," [...] Davi told Liston biographer Paul Gallender. [...] "He told me in the <b>strictest</b> <b>confidence,</b> but it was like he wanted to get it off his chest." [...] Gallender claims, [...] "A lot of officers knew Sonny was dead before Geraldine returned home on January 5, but they chose to let him rot." ...|$|E
