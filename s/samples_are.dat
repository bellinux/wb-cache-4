5|$|In {{addition}} to the above, blood <b>samples</b> <b>are</b> usually taken to measure urea and creatinine (measures of kidney function, which may be impaired in DKA {{as a result of}} dehydration) and electrolytes. Furthermore, markers of infection (complete blood count, C-reactive protein) and acute pancreatitis (amylase and lipase) may be measured. Given the need to exclude infection, chest radiography and urinalysis are usually performed.|$|E
5|$|Thus, most {{einsteinium}} <b>samples</b> <b>are</b> contaminated, {{and their}} intrinsic properties are often deduced by extrapolating back experimental data accumulated over time. Other experimental techniques {{to circumvent the}} contamination problem include selective optical excitation of einsteinium ions by a tunable laser, such as in studying its luminescence properties.|$|E
5|$|Vesta is {{currently}} {{one of only}} six identified Solar System bodies of which we have physical samples, coming {{from a number of}} meteorites suspected to be Vestan fragments. It is estimated that 1 out of 16 meteorites originated from Vesta. The other identified Solar System <b>samples</b> <b>are</b> from Earth itself, meteorites from Mars, meteorites from the Moon, and samples returned from the Moon, the comet Wild 2, and the asteroid 25143 Itokawa.|$|E
30|$|As {{part of the}} study, {{groundwater}} <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> {{collected from}} different areas. <b>Samples</b> <b>were</b> randomly taken from whole area of newly installed pumps to investigate the different water quality parameters in the groundwater. The <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> taken in 500  ml bottles. The 60 water <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> collected in total from the groundwater.

40|$|Muscle {{samples from}} the neck and {{diaphragm}} and fecal <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> collected from five hogs from each of 50 lots of market hogs at three Manitoba abattoirs. Environmental <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> also collected. Each <b>sample</b> <b>was</b> tested for Salmonella contamination, and tissue and fecal <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> tested for Campylobacter...|$|R
30|$|Twenty <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> {{collected}} from different sandstone sources (Missouri sandstone, Roubidoux sandstone, and Berea sandstone). The length (L) of all <b>samples</b> <b>was</b> 1.5 in. (3.7  cm) and the diameter (d) of all <b>samples</b> <b>was</b> 1.5 in. (3.7  cm). To {{make sure that}} the dimensions of all <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> exact, a caliper was used to measure the core length and diameter. The <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> placed in an oven at 120  °C for 24  h. After that, the <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> evacuated and then saturated to 100  % with brines of chosen concentrations.|$|R
5|$|Adjuvant {{chemotherapy}} {{refers to}} the use of chemotherapy after apparently curative surgery to improve the outcome. In NSCLC, <b>samples</b> <b>are</b> taken of nearby lymph nodes during surgery to assist staging. If stage II or III disease is confirmed, adjuvant chemotherapy improves survival by 5% at five years. The combination of vinorelbine and cisplatin is more effective than older regimens. Adjuvant chemotherapy for people with stage IB cancer is controversial, as clinical trials have not clearly demonstrated a survival benefit. Chemotherapy before surgery in NSCLC that can be removed surgically also appears to improve outcomes.|$|E
5|$|Almost all {{the rocks}} show {{evidence}} of impact process effects. Many samples {{appear to be}} pitted with micrometeoroid impact craters, which is never seen on Earth rocks, due to the thick atmosphere. Many show signs of being subjected to high pressure shock waves that are generated during impact events. Some of the returned <b>samples</b> <b>are</b> of impact melt (materials melted near an impact crater.) All samples returned from the Moon are highly brecciated {{as a result of}} being subjected to multiple impact events.|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{from the}} Apollo 17 mission {{shows that the}} massifs {{surrounding}} the valley are composed primarily of feldspar-rich breccia and that basalt underlies the valley floor, {{a result of the}} lava flows during the valley's history. Seismic studies suggest that the basalt below the valley floor is about 1400 metres (4593.2feet) thick. Above the layer of subfloor basalt lies a deposit of unconsolidated material of various compositions ranging from volcanic material to impact-formed regolith. The valley floor's unusually low albedo, or reflectivity, {{is a direct result of}} the volcanic material and glass beads located there. The deeper craters on the valley floor act as 'natural drill holes' and allowed the astronauts to sample the subfloor basalt. These basalt <b>samples</b> <b>are</b> composed primarily of plagioclase, but also contain amounts of clinopyroxene and other minerals.|$|E
30|$|Twenty-six {{brown algae}} <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> {{collected}} during October and November, 2014. The <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> {{collected from the}} fringing reefs area with transect at c. 50  m and depth {{in the range of}} 50 – 150  cm. Four species including Turbinaria sp., Sargassum sp., Cystoseira sp. and Padina sp. <b>were</b> identified. <b>Samples</b> <b>were</b> stored in polyethylene bottles until transferring to laboratory. <b>Samples</b> <b>were</b> then flushed by seawater that was collected from the relevant locations. The soft parts in algae <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> separated and oven-dried at 105  °C. Dried <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> crushed to fine powder for treatment.|$|R
30|$|In Oman, <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> {{collected}} from 4 governorates: Musandam, Batinah North, Dakhilya, and Dhahira (Fig.  6). At least 15 <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> {{collected from}} 5 farms in each governorate. Lime leaf <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> also collected from 6 farms in Al-Ain (UAE) in March 2013. In addition, <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> collected from Hormozgan and Kerman (Iran) (Fig.  6). At least 20 <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> collected from each country.

Urine <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> collected and frozen at - 80 °C until analysis.|$|R
5|$|Hafnium is a shiny, silvery, {{ductile metal}} that is {{corrosion-resistant}} and chemically similar to zirconium (due to its {{having the same}} number of valence electrons, being in the same group, but also to relativistic effects; the expected expansion of atomic radii from period 5 to 6 is almost exactly cancelled out by the lanthanide contraction). The physical properties of hafnium metal <b>samples</b> <b>are</b> markedly affected by zirconium impurities, especially the nuclear properties, as these two elements are among the most difficult to separate because of their chemical similarity.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, a {{team from}} New York {{described}} detection of PrPSc even when initially present at only one part in a hundred billion (10−11) in brain tissue. The method combines amplification with a novel technology called Surround Optical Fiber Immunoassay (SOFIA) and some specific antibodies against PrPSc. After amplifying and then concentrating any PrPSc, the <b>samples</b> <b>are</b> labelled with a fluorescent dye using an antibody for specificity and then finally loaded into a micro-capillary tube. This tube is placed in a specially constructed apparatus {{so that it is}} totally surrounded by optical fibres to capture all light emitted once the dye is excited using a laser.|$|E
5|$|In 2017 Canadian {{scientists}} recreated an extinct {{horse pox}} virus {{to demonstrate that}} the smallpox virus can be recreated in a small lab {{at a cost of about}} $100,000, by a team of scientists without specialist knowledge. This makes the retention controversy moot since the virus can be easily recreated even if all <b>samples</b> <b>are</b> destroyed. Although the scientists performed the research to help development of new vaccines as well as trace smallpox's history, the possibility of the techniques being used for nefarious purposes was immediately recognized, leading to new regulation questions.|$|E
30|$|<b>Sampling</b> <b>was</b> {{done during}} two periods in April/May 2014 (on-set of rainy season) and November/December 2014 (on-set of dry season) {{from the various}} {{locations}} indicated above. Depth integrated water <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> collected over bridges and preserved at about pH 2 with conc. HNO 3, whilst sediment <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> collected through coring with a PVC tube. Two water and sediment <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> taken from each location. The fish <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> collected using dragnet and stored in an ice chest at 4  °C and transported to the laboratory. The <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> later identified in the laboratory and prepared for analysis.|$|R
30|$|In this study, {{contaminated}} pistachio <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> {{prepared in}} closed package. The <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> analyzed before treatment. The <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> placed between the electrodes and then {{exposed to the}} plasma at 8, 10, 12, 14, 16 and 18  min. After plasma exposure, the treated <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> transferred for fungal analysis, each treatment was repeated thrice.|$|R
40|$|In {{the past}} six and half years, 862 {{different}} clinical samples [sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage, thorax puncture, cerebrospinal fluid and skin samples] were tested by Gen-probe amplified Mycobacterium tuberculosis direct test (MTD) or ligase chain reaction (LCR) or polymerase chain reaction (PCR). 239 parallel clinical <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> cultivated, and some <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> stained with Ziehl-Neelsen staining. 1 - 4 <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> tested per patient. 29 (12. 13 %) <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> positive and 177 (74. 05 %) <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> negative with both cultivation and molecular genetic methods. 2 (0. 83 %) <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> positive only on cultivation, and 31 (12. 97 %) <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> positive only with the molecular diagnostic methods. The differences are undoubtedly explained by {{the sensitivity of the}} molecular diagnostic methods...|$|R
5|$|In {{contrast}} to plants and animals, the early fossil {{record of the}} fungi is meager. Factors that likely contribute to the under-representation of fungal species among fossils include the nature of fungal fruiting bodies, which are soft, fleshy, and easily degradable tissues and the microscopic dimensions of most fungal structures, which therefore are not readily evident. Fungal fossils are difficult to distinguish from those of other microbes, and are most easily identified when they resemble extant fungi. Often recovered from a permineralized plant or animal host, these <b>samples</b> <b>are</b> typically studied by making thin-section preparations that can be examined with light microscopy or transmission electron microscopy. Researchers study compression fossils by dissolving the surrounding matrix with acid and then using light or scanning electron microscopy to examine surface details.|$|E
5|$|The {{diagnosis}} of hypopituitarism is made on blood tests. Two types of blood tests {{are used to}} confirm {{the presence of a}} hormone deficiency: basal levels, where blood <b>samples</b> <b>are</b> taken–usually in the morning–without any form of stimulation, and dynamic tests, where blood tests are taken after the injection of a stimulating substance. Measurement of ACTH and growth hormone usually requires dynamic testing, whereas the other hormones (LH/FSH, prolactin, TSH) can typically be tested with basal levels. There is no adequate direct test for ADH levels, but ADH deficiency can be confirmed indirectly; oxytocin levels are not routinely measured.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} trees in the world, {{according}} to a 2015 estimate, is 3.04 trillion, of which 1.39 trillion (46%) are in the tropics or sub-tropics, 0.61 trillion (20%) in the temperate zones, and 0.74 trillion (24%) in the coniferous boreal forests. The estimate is about eight times higher than previous estimates, {{and is based on}} tree densities measured on over 400,000 plots. It remains subject to a wide margin of error, not least because the <b>samples</b> <b>are</b> mainly from Europe and North America. The estimate suggests that about 15 billion trees are cut down annually and about 5 billion are planted. In the 12,000 years since the start of human agriculture, the number of trees worldwide has decreased by 46%.|$|E
30|$|The PVC biofilm <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> {{collected}} from four different regions located {{in and around}} Tirupati (Chittoor District), Andhra Pradesh, India.

5|$|Thorium is {{a highly}} {{reactive}} and electropositive metal. With a standard reduction potential of −1.90V for the Th4+/Th couple, it is somewhat more electropositive than zirconium or aluminium. Finely divided thorium metal can exhibit pyrophoricity, spontaneously igniting in air. When heated in air, thorium turnings ignite and burn with a brilliant white light to produce the dioxide. In bulk, the reaction of pure thorium with air is slow, although corrosion may eventually occur after several months; most thorium <b>samples</b> <b>are</b> contaminated {{with varying degrees of}} the dioxide, which greatly accelerates corrosion. Such samples slowly tarnish in air, becoming grey and finally black at the surface.|$|E
5|$|Titanium {{tetrachloride}} (titanium(IV) chloride, TiCl4) is a colorless volatile liquid (commercial <b>samples</b> <b>are</b> yellowish) that, in air, hydrolyzes with spectacular {{emission of}} white clouds. Via the Kroll process, TiCl4 {{is produced in}} the conversion of titanium ores to titanium dioxide, e.g., for use in white paint. It is widely used in organic chemistry as a Lewis acid, for example in the Mukaiyama aldol condensation. In the van Arkel process, titanium tetraiodide (TiI4) is generated {{in the production of}} high purity titanium metal.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 2003, Craig Venter, {{leader of}} the privately funded {{parallel}} of the Human Genome Project, has led the Global Ocean Sampling Expedition (GOS), circumnavigating the globe and collecting metagenomic samples throughout the journey. All of these <b>samples</b> <b>are</b> sequenced using shotgun sequencing, in hopes that new genomes (and therefore new organisms) would be identified. The pilot project, conducted in the Sargasso Sea, found DNA from nearly 2000 different species, including 148 types of bacteria never before seen. Venter has circumnavigated the globe and thoroughly explored the West Coast of the United States, and completed a two-year expedition to explore the Baltic, Mediterranean and Black Seas. Analysis of the metagenomic data collected during this journey revealed two groups of organisms, one composed of taxa adapted to environmental conditions of 'feast or famine', and a second composed of relatively fewer but more abundantly and widely distributed taxa primarily composed of plankton.|$|E
30|$|A set of oil samples totaling sixteen (16) were {{obtained}} from different oil fields within the Niger Delta basin.

50|$|The main {{difference}} between cluster sampling and stratified <b>sampling</b> <b>is</b> that in cluster <b>sampling</b> the cluster <b>is</b> treated as the sampling unit so <b>sampling</b> <b>is</b> {{done on a}} population of clusters (at least in the first stage). In stratified <b>sampling,</b> the <b>sampling</b> <b>is</b> done on elements within each strata. In stratified sampling, a random <b>sample</b> <b>is</b> drawn {{from each of the}} strata, whereas in cluster sampling only the selected clusters <b>are</b> <b>sampled.</b> A common motivation of cluster <b>sampling</b> <b>is</b> to reduce costs by increasing sampling efficiency. This contrasts with stratified sampling where the motivation is to increase precision.|$|R
30|$|Water <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> {{collected}} from the five selected sites of the lake at about 10 to 15  cm below the water surface {{with the help of}} a Ruttner sampler.
