The alloy is treated with hydrochloric acid. The metal is extracted from the solution as oxalate and converted to oxide by heating. The oxide is reduced to metal by heating with lanthanum, aluminium, cerium or zirconium in high vacuum. The metal is purified by sublimation and collected over a condensed plate.|$|E

Some of these have ionic characteristics: taking the alloys with gold, the most electronegative of metals, as an example, NaAu and KAu are metallic, but RbAu and CsAu are semiconductors. NaK is an alloy of sodium and potassium that is very useful because it is liquid at room temperature, although precautions must be taken due to its extreme reactivity towards water and air. The eutectic mixture melts at −12.6°C. An alloy of 41% caesium, 47% sodium, and 12% potassium has the lowest known melting point of any metal or alloy, −78°C.|$|R

25|$|The use of <b>sodium</b> <b>amalgam,</b> which {{promotes}} {{the formation of}} essentially free alkyl anions, leads to (E) alkenes with extremely high selectivity. Samarium(II) iodide also produces the (E) alkene predominantly, but with lower selectivity.|$|E
25|$|Alkyl and alkenyl sulfones {{with good}} leaving {{groups in the}} β {{position}} undergo elimination under reductive conditions to afford alkenes or alkynes. The Julia olefination exploits this process for the synthesis of alkenes from alkyl sulfones and carbonyl compounds. Addition of an α-sulfonyl anion to a carbonyl compound, followed by quenching with an acyl or sulfonyl chloride, leads to a β-acyloxy or -sulfonyloxy sulfone, which undergoes elimination under reductive conditions. <b>Sodium</b> <b>amalgam</b> {{may be used to}} accomplish the elimination step; however, the combination of samarium(II) iodide and HMPA is milder than strongly basic <b>sodium</b> <b>amalgam</b> and leads to higher yields in reductive elimination processes.|$|E

Disodium hydrogen phosphate is used to buffer the solution at a pH of 7–8, meaning that base-labile functionality is stable under the reduction conditions. Reductions employing aluminum amalgam (prepared by immersion of aluminum foil into a 2% aqueous solution of HgCl2) often require higher temperatures than the corresponding <b>sodium</b> <b>amalgam</b> reactions. Mercury and mercury compounds are poisonous and teratogenic, and should be used only in a properly functioning chemical fume hood.

40|$|The {{standard}} electron-transfer heterogeneous {{rate constant}} of lithium, potassium, <b>sodium</b> and caesium <b>amalgams</b> in N,N-dimethylformamide was ascertained employing cyclic voltammetry {{in an effort}} to relate the presence of a non-equilibrium electrode reaction at the dropping lithium amalgam electrode to the variation of the lithium amalgam electrode potential with amalgam electrode con- figuration, i. e. whether streaming, dropping or stationary. Such variations are not observed at other alkali metal amalgam electrodes. In the dipolar aprotic solvents the standard electron-transfer heterogeneous rate constant for the Li(Hg) electrode increases as the solvating power for Li+ decreases, i. e. dimethyl sulphoxide < di- methylformamide < propylene carbonate. Water is a much stronger solvator of Li+ than is propylene carbonate, but the electron transfer is faster in water than in propylene carbonate; the important role of entropic contributions in ion solvation is discussed as an explanation...|$|R

The remarkable solvent effect on the two equilibria (1 a double left right arrow 1 b; 2 a double left right arrow 2 b) was rationalized using solvent basicity measures and polarity scales.

500|$|Zinc, cadmium {{and mercury}} form a large range of alloys. Among the zinc {{containing}} ones, brass is an alloy of zinc and copper. Other metals long known to form binary alloys with zinc are aluminium, antimony, bismuth, gold, iron, lead, mercury, silver, tin, magnesium, cobalt, nickel, tellurium and sodium. While neither zinc nor zirconium are ferromagnetic, their alloy [...] exhibits ferromagnetism below 35K. Cadmium {{is used in}} many kinds of solder and bearing alloys, due to a low coefficient of friction and fatigue resistance. It {{is also found in}} some of the lowest-melting alloys, such as Wood's metal. Because it is a liquid, mercury dissolves other metals and the alloys that are formed are called amalgams. For example, such amalgams are known with gold, zinc, sodium, and many other metals. Because iron is an exception, iron flasks have been traditionally used to trade mercury. Other metals that do not form amalgams with mercury include tantalum, tungsten and platinum. <b>Sodium</b> <b>amalgam</b> is a common reducing agent in organic synthesis, and is also used in high-pressure sodium lamps. Mercury readily combines with aluminium to form a mercury-aluminium amalgam when the two pure metals come into contact. Since the amalgam reacts with air to give aluminium oxide, small amounts of mercury corrode aluminium. For this reason, mercury is not allowed aboard an aircraft under most circumstances because of the risk of it forming an amalgam with exposed aluminium parts in the aircraft.|$|E
