5|$|The first {{large-scale}} {{industrial use}} of vanadium {{was in the}} <b>steel</b> <b>alloy</b> chassis of the Ford Model T, inspired by French race cars. Vanadium steel allowed for reduced weight while simultaneously increasing tensile strength (ca. 1905).|$|E
5|$|In 2016 a {{breakthrough}} in creating a strong light aluminium <b>steel</b> <b>alloy</b> which might be suitable in applications such as aircraft was announced by researchers at Pohang University of Science and Technology. Adding small amounts of nickel was found to result in precipitation as nano particles of brittle B2 intermetallic compounds which had previously resulted in weakness. The result was a cheap strong light steel alloy—nearly as strong as titanium at 10% of the cost—which is slated for trial production at industrial scale by POSCO, a Korean steelmaker.|$|E
5|$|During {{assembly}} of Collins bow section in Sweden, multiple defects in the hull welding were discovered. Different reasons were given by different parties for the problems: the <b>steel</b> <b>alloy</b> {{used for the}} hull required different welding techniques to those normally used by Kockums; the Swedish navy always requested partial penetration welds for their submarines, while the RAN wanted full penetration welding, but had not made this clear; delays in delivering the steel plates to Kockums resulted in rushed work and a resulting drop in quality. Kockums engineers proposed that the section be kept in Sweden for repairs, but to minimise delays it was accepted as-is, with repairs attempted at ASC during full {{assembly of}} the first boat.|$|E

40|$|Selective {{oxidation}} behaviour of Fe-Mn-Cr <b>steel</b> <b>alloys</b> annealed at 950 °C in Ar plus 5 vol. % H 2 atmosphere under different annealing time and dew points was studied. The Fe-Mn-Cr <b>steel</b> <b>alloys</b> are externally oxidized when annealing at dew point of - 45 °C, while internally oxidized at dew points of - 10 and 10 °C. The internal oxides {{formed in the}} Fe-Mn-Cr <b>steel</b> <b>alloys</b> are (Mn, Fe) O and (Cr, Mn, Fe) 3 O 4. The kinetics of internal oxidation of Fe-Mn-Cr alloys at 950 °C is diffusion controlled and follows parabolic growth rate law. The measured kinetics of internal oxidation of Fe-Mn-Cr alloys and the concentration depth profiles of internal oxides are in good agreement with simulation results. Adding Cr to the Fe-Mn <b>steel</b> <b>alloys</b> decreases the kinetics of internal oxidation. The growth rate of internal oxidation zone can be predicted by a modified Wagner’s internal oxidation model. The external oxides formed during annealing of Fe-Mn-Cr <b>steel</b> <b>alloys</b> cannot be reduced by H 2. However, an oxide-free steel surface {{can be obtained by}} first forming and then reducing a Wüstite scale...|$|R

5|$|The {{carbon content}} of steel is between 0.002% and 2.14% by weight for plain ironcarbon alloys. These values vary {{depending}} on alloying elements such as manganese, chromium, nickel, iron, tungsten, carbon and so on. Basically, steel is an iron-carbon alloy that does not undergo eutectic reaction. In contrast, cast iron does undergo eutectic reaction. Too little carbon content leaves (pure) iron quite soft, ductile, and weak. Carbon contents {{higher than those of}} steel make an alloy, commonly called pig iron, that is brittle (not malleable). While iron alloyed with carbon is called carbon <b>steel,</b> <b>alloy</b> steel is steel to which other alloying elements have been intentionally added to modify the characteristics of steel. Common alloying elements include: manganese, nickel, chromium, molybdenum, boron, titanium, vanadium, tungsten, cobalt, and niobium. Additional elements are also important in steel: phosphorus, sulfur, silicon, and traces of oxygen, nitrogen, and copper, that are most frequently considered undesirable.|$|E

2500|$|Cheaper steel bicycle {{frames are}} made of mild steel, also called high tensile steel, such as {{might be used to}} {{manufacture}} automobiles or other common items.

25|$|Producing metric {{drawings}} and analyzing {{the materials used}} in the Derwent V went fairly quickly, but finding {{a substitute for the}} high-temperature, creep-resistant Nimonic 80 <b>steel</b> <b>alloy</b> was a more difficult challenge. Eventually an alloy that matched Nimonic 80's high-temperature properties was found in KhN 80T, but it was not creep-resistant. The first Derwent V copy, designated as the RD-500 (Reaktivnyy Dvigatel — jet engine) after the Factory No. 500 where the engine was first produced, was being tested on 31 December 1947, but problems cropped up quickly. Combustion was uneven and this cracked the combustion chambers. This may {{have had something to do}} with the modifications made by the Soviets to the fuel, speed and starter systems. But these problems were resolved by September 1948 when the engine passed its 100-hour State acceptance test.|$|E
25|$|Two flaws {{emerged in}} Maines protection, both due to {{technological}} developments between her laying-down and her completion. The {{first was a}} lack of adequate topside armor to counter the effects of rapid-fire intermediate-caliber guns and high-explosive shells. This was a flaw she shared with Texas. The second was the use of nickel-steel armor. Introduced in 1889, nickel steel was the first modern <b>steel</b> <b>alloy</b> armor and, with a figure of merit of 0.67, was an improvement over the 0.6 rating of mild steel used until then. Harvey steel and Krupp armors, both of which appeared in 1893, had merit figures of between 0.9 and 1.2, giving them roughly twice the tensile strength of nickel steel. Although all three armors shared the same density (about 40 pounds per square foot for a one-inch-thick plate), six inches of Krupp or Harvey steel gave the same protection as 10inches of nickel. The weight thus saved could be applied either to additional hull structure and machinery or to achieving higher speed. The navy would incorporate Harvey armor in the s, designed after Maine, but commissioned at roughly the same time.|$|E

In the present study, we synthesized fully dispersible nanocrystalline Beta zeolite seeds and coated on <b>steel</b> <b>alloys</b> followed by steaming.
