40|$|Good <b>synchronous</b> <b>cultures</b> of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe {{can be made}} by {{selecting}} small cells from the Beckman JE- 6 elutriator rotor. More important, the rate of leucine incorporation in controls shows far less perturbation than after selection from tube gradients. Elutriation may therefore be the best available method for reducing perturbations in selection synchronized <b>cultures.</b> <b>Synchronous</b> <b>cultures</b> of yeasts (and other cells) have been produced {{for more than a decade}} {{by selecting}} fractions from an exponential phase culture after centrifuging in a gradient in tubes or in zonal rotors (Mitchison & Carter, 1975). Although this method is satisfactory in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe for measuring some cellular components, e. g.

These perturbations appear in <b>synchronous</b> <b>cultures</b> and also in control cultures (Mitchison & Carter, 1975) which are put through most of the synchronizing pro-cedure but which are not finally selected for size and are therefore asynchronous with respect to the cell cycle.

40|$|Criteria are {{presented}} for distinguishing between <b>synchronous</b> and synchronized <b>cultures</b> (natural vs. forced synchrony) {{on the basis}} of characteristics of growth and division during a single generation. These criteria were applied in an examination of the uptake of potassium during the cell growth and division cycle in <b>synchronous</b> <b>cultures</b> and in a synchronized culture of Escherichia coli. In the <b>synchronous</b> <b>cultures</b> the uptake of 42 K doubled synchronously with cell number, corresponding to a constant rate of uptake per cell throughout the cell cycle. In the synchronized culture, uptake rates also remained constant during most of the cycle, but rates doubled abruptly well within the cycle. This constancy of 42 K uptake per cell supports an earlier interpretation for steady-state cultures that uptake is limited in each cell by a constant number of functional sites for binding, transport, or accumulation of compounds from the growth medium, and that the average number of such sites doubles late in each cell cycle. The abrupt doubling of the rate of uptake of potassium per cell in the synchronized culture appears because of partial uncoupling of cell division from activation or synthesis of these uptake sites...|$|R

40|$|The {{rates of}} polyadenylated {{messenger}} RNA and ribosomal RNA synthesis were measured in synchronously dividing cultures of fission yeast (Schizosaccfiaromyces pombe). Control asynchronous cultures, {{which had been}} exposed to the conditions used for preparing syn-chronous cultures, were investigated to check for effects of the synchronization procedure itself on RNA synthesis. After each period of DNA synthesis in <b>synchronous</b> <b>culture,</b> the rates of messenger and ribosomal RNA synthesis doubled, suggesting that gene number controls the rate of messenger and ribosomal RNA synthesis. This was confirmed by experiments with asynchronous, exponential-phase cultures in which DNA synthesis was inhibited by hydroxy-urea. Both <b>synchronous</b> <b>culture</b> and hydroxyurea experiments suggested that there is a delay of 15 min (o-i of the cell generation time) between replication of the DNA and transcription of both gene copies. A pattern of protein accumulation was calculated from changes in the rate of polyadenylated messenger RNA synthesis during <b>synchronous</b> <b>culture.</b> This simulated pattern indicates that protein is accumulated linearly, with a doubling in the rate of accumulation once per cell cycle. The simulated pattern of protein accumulation is very similar to measurements previously reported by other workers of changes in activities of 3 enzymes in synchronous cultures. It is suggested that the doubling of the rate of messenger RNA synthesis, {{as a consequence of the}} replication of the DNA once per cycle, provides the basis of a mechanism for control of the doubling of other cellular constituents during the cell cycle...|$|E
40|$|By {{using the}} intact {{cells of the}} fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, the {{activity}} of acid phosphatase (EC 3. 1. 3. 2) was compared through the cell cycle with the growth in cell length {{as a measure of}} cell growth.

When hydroxyurea was added to an asynchronous or a <b>synchronous</b> <b>culture</b> by selection, both specific and total activity followed the same continuous pattern as the growth in cell length after the stoppage of cell division. When oversized cells produced by a hydroxyurea pulse treatment to the culture previously syndronized by selection were transferred to a poor medium, they divided synchronously but could hardly grow in the total cell length. In this experimental situation, the total enzyme activity also scarcely increased through three division cycles.

40|$|Analysis of {{exponential}} and <b>synchronous</b> <b>cultures</b> of Escherichia coli B/r {{after the}} addition of FL 1060 indicates a block point for division by this agent some 15 to 20 min {{before the end of}} the preceding cell division cycle, a time corresponding to the beginning of the C period of the cell division cycle. Morphological examination of FL 1060 -treated <b>synchronous</b> <b>cultures</b> of E. coli /r was consistent with inhibition by FL 1060 of a very early event in the cell division cycle. This event appears to be essential for normal cell surface elongation in a rod configuration. Temporary treatment of <b>synchronous</b> <b>cultures</b> of E. coli B/r with FL 1060 resulted in division delay, the extent of which was a function of the duration of exposure to FL 1060. However, even after relatively long times of FL 1060 treatment the delayed divisions were still synchronous. Although FL 1060 had no direct effect on deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis, the synchronous delayed division occuring after temporary treatment with FL 1060 were accompanied by a delay in the attainment of resistance of cell division to inhibitors of DNA, ribonucleic acid, and protein synthesis. These results suggest aht an FL 1060 -sensitive event initiates at the beginning of the C period of the cell division cycle of E. coli and is responsible for normal cell elongation. This cell elongation pathway procedes independently of DNA synthesis, but there is an interaction between this pathway and termination of a round of DNA replication in which a normal rod configuration is necessary to allow a signal for cell division to be generated upon completion of DNA replication...|$|R

The shift-up experiments, in which portions of a <b>synchronous</b> <b>culture</b> of each mutant were transferred to the nonpermissive temperature, showed that the transition point, at which cells attained the ability to divide at the nonpermissive temperature in the cell cycle, was strain specific. Furthermore, the heat shock experiments, in which portions of a <b>synchronous</b> <b>culture</b> were subjected to the nonpermissive temperature before the transition point for a fixed period and shifted back to the permissive temperature, showed that the time interval between the shift-back and the subsequent cell division was specific to each strain but was independent {{of the age of}} heat shock. These results led us to the idea that the initiation of septum formation in B. subtilis requires the timed action of the four gene products, each of which functions at a specific stage in the cell cycle.

40|$|In {{synchronized}} continuous {{cultures of}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae CBS 8066, {{the production of}} the extracellular invertase (EC 3. 2. 1. 26) showed a cyclic behavior that coincided with the budding cycle. The invertase activity increased during bud development and ceased at bud maturation and cell scission. The cyclic changes in invertase production resulted in cyclic changes in amounts of invertase localized in the cell wall. However, the amount of enzyme invertase present in the culture liquid remained constant throughout the budding cycle. Also, in asynchronous continuous cultures of S. cerevisiae, the production and localization of invertase showed significant fluctuation. The overall invertase production in an asynchronous culture was two to three times higher than in <b>synchronous</b> <b>cultures.</b> This could be due to more-severe invertase-repressive conditions in a <b>synchronous</b> chemostat <b>culture.</b> Both the intracellular glucose- 6 -phosphate concentration and residual glucose concentration were significantly higher in <b>synchronous</b> chemostat <b>cultures</b> than in asynchro-nous chemostat cultures.

High-density yeast cultures (2 x 10 (8) cells per ml) were arrested prior to "start" by sequential glucose deprivation, {{after which they}} synchronously replicated DNA and divided after a final glucose feeding. Oxygenation of arrested cultures {{in the absence of}} glucose led to increased levels of sugar phosphates and ATP and an increase in intracellular pH. However, these conditions did not initiate cell cycle progression, indicating that energization is not used as an intracellular signal for initiation of the cell division cycle and that the cells need exogenous carbon sources for growth. Glucose refeeding initiated an alkaline intracellular pH transient only in the <b>synchronous</b> <b>cultures,</b> showing that increased intracellular pH accompanies the traversal of start. Changes in phosphate flow and utilization also were observed in the <b>synchronous</b> <b>cultures.</b> In particular, there was increased consumption of external phosphate during DNA synthesis.
