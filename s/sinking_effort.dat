25|$|Shoshone {{was then}} taken further downriver, making the run over Celilo Falls, itself always {{reckoned}} a hazardous stretch, on June 28, 1870. Once below Celilo, she ran as a cattle boat between the upper Cascades and The Dalles. Later {{she was taken}} over the Cascades {{and down to the}} Willamette River, where she was sold to the Willamette River Transportation Company. The W.R.T. Co. then hauled Shoshone up around Willamette Falls, and ran her on the upper Willamette and also on the Yamhill River. There, perhaps surprisingly for a boat that had run Hells Canyon, she struck a rock near Salem, Oregon in the fall of 1874 and <b>sank.</b> <b>Efforts</b> to raise her failed, although her machinery was salvaged, and later installed in Champion. In January 1875, rising water lifted her free, and washed her down river to Lincoln. There a farmer salvaged her cabins, hauled them ashore, and turned them into a chicken coops.|$|R

5000|$|In 1938 Major Treatt of the Canada War Department, {{inspected}} {{the west coast}} of Canada and determined suitable locations for coastal defences. Yorke Island was determined to be a suitable site. The site was equipped with two 4.7” Quick firing guns, later replaced by two 6” Mk7 guns on Mk 2 mounting (transferred from the Stanley Park Battery). Also fitted was a 6 pdr Hotchkiss “examination gun”. Anti-aircraft defence was provided by two 40mm Bofors guns at two different sites. In all three 800 million carbon arc searchlights were positioned to maintain a night fighting ability. In addition examination vessels, nicknamed the [...] "Gumboot Navy" [...] due to the use of fishing vessels and their crew, were on station to assist the fort in examining all passing traffic. Approximately 60 buildings were built to support the garrison. A major challenge with Yorke Island was a lack of drinking water. Water was at first supplied by Union Steam ships while dropping off construction materials. After this was determined to be to inefficient, a scow with a large tank was brought in to fill the 50000 gallon cement water tank via the nearest creek on Hardwicke Island. Filling this tank and its challenges led to the only death on Yorke, Gnr Brunt, when the skiff he and others were on was swamped returning from a maintenance trip to Hardwicke Island. Brunt's leg tangled in the boat tow line and he was lost when it <b>sank.</b> <b>Efforts</b> to recover him were not successful.|$|R

This study compared the heat transfer performance of a thermosyphon drill to the performance of a solid drill and a heat pipe drill under simulated and actual drilling conditions. Results show that when using a drill with a thermosyphon the temperature of the drill tip was almost 60 % lower than a solid drill for 45 and 55 -volt power inputs and 37 % lower for 35 -volt power input. Compared to a heat pipe drill the maximum temperatures were reduced 18 % to 36 %. It was also shown that higher speed has an adverse effect on the operation of the thermosyphon, but in the worst case, the drill tip temperature was only 16 % higher...|$|R

40|$|High-precision {{measurements}} of atmospheric oxygen play {{an increasingly important}} role {{in our understanding of}} the global carbon cycle and its feedbacks on the Earth’s climate. In combination with CO 2 measurements, they allow partitioning of global oceanic and terrestrial sinks of anthropogenic CO 2. In addition, influences from biospheric processes and anthropogenic emissions on observed CO 2 variations can be distinguished using simultaneously measured O 2 mixing ratios, since these processes have different O 2 :CO 2 ratios. Over the past decade, the global network of stations monitoring atmospheric O 2 in addition to CO 2 has been growing continuously and also become more representative due to the addition of continental stations. Data from these stations allow better constraining of fluxes from regional to continental scales, but due to the proximity of highly variable local (e. g. anthropogenic) sources and <b>sinks</b> additional <b>effort</b> is needed to interpret the measurements. This thesis deals with two aspects that are important for improving the ability to utilize those data: First, the characterization of anthropogenic sources, their spatial and temporal variability and their influence on the atmospheric composition, and second, the use of airborne measurements to characterize the spatial variability of fluxes in between the ground-based monitoring stations. In {{the first part of this}} thesis, the possibility to use simultaneous atmospheric O 2 and CO 2 measurements for identifying different types of emission sources is investigated. The second part deals with the use and improvement of airborne {{measurements of}} atmospheric oxygen, by presenting results from an aircraft campaign in the Amazon forest and the development of a new instrument for in-situ O 2 measurements onboard research aircraft...|$|R

2500|$|Land {{managers}} and conservationists {{have become increasingly}} interested in preserving and restoring high quality habitat, particularly where rare, threatened, or endangered species are concerned. [...] As a result, {{it is important to}} understand how to identify or create high quality habitat, and how populations respond to habitat loss or change. [...] Because a large proportion of a species' population could exist in <b>sink</b> habitat, conservation <b>efforts</b> may misinterpret the species' habitat requirements. [...] Similarly, without considering the presence of a trap, conservationists might mistakenly preserve trap habitat under the assumption that an organism's preferred habitat was also good quality habitat. [...] Simultaneously, source habitat may be ignored or even destroyed if only a small proportion of the population resides there. [...] Degradation or destruction of the source habitat will, in turn, impact the sink or trap populations, potentially over large distances. [...] Finally, efforts to restore degraded habitat may unintentionally create an ecological trap by giving a site the appearance of quality habitat, but which has not yet developed all of the functional elements necessary for an organism's survival and reproduction. [...] For an already threatened species, such mistakes might result in a rapid population decline toward extinction.|$|R
