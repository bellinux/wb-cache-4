5|$|The flow of {{the river}} has {{decreased}} in power in recent years, partly because of <b>surface</b> <b>run-off</b> in the upper catchment of the Hazel Brook, especially from the large retail centre at Cribbs Causeway, which sends {{a good deal of}} silt into the system, slowing the flow and creating a risk of flooding downstream. This problem has now been partially alleviated by the construction of the Catbrain attenuation reservoir near Cribbs Causeway. Measurements of pollution by the city council show the water to be relatively clean.|$|E
5|$|The lake {{does not}} meet the National Water Quality Standards due to its high {{concentration}} of Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD). Considering the adverse impact on the lake water quality due to Eutrophication, anthropogenic pressures and holy rituals and tourism, a water quality study was specifically undertaken at four sites on a monthly basis for six months. The sampling sites were chosen to represent the pressure of pilgrims and other pollution inflows at the locations. The water samples were analysed for temperature, pH, salinity, conductivity, total dissolved solids, alkalinity, hardness, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, chloride, nitrite, nitrate, phosphate, sulphate, sodium, ammonium, potassium, total chlorophyll, biochemical oxygen demand and chemical oxygen demand. The analysis over the period has revealed that the lake water was alkaline, chloride and conductivity concentrations were high at all the four sites, and there were lower levels of dissolved oxygen (at sites with greater pollution load) and high hardness (on account of excess of calcium and magnesium from <b>surface</b> <b>run-off).</b> During the period of the annual Pushkar Fair, a distinct co-relationship was discerned between various parameters analysed and the degree of water pollution in the lake. This has called for urgent remedial actions to be undertaken by all of the government agencies involved with the lake management, with people's participation.|$|E

40|$|Although other {{research}} studies on {{areas such as}} the physical-chemical, nutrients and phytoplankton status of Lake Kyoga systems have been given a lot of attention (e. g. Mungoma 1988 and NaFIRRI 2006), efforts to determine the pollution status of this system, especially by heavy metals as one of the worldwide emerging environmental problems, is still limited. Many trace metals are regarded as serious pollutants of aquatic ecosystems because of their persistence, toxicity and ability to be incorporated into food chains (Mwamburi J., and Nathan O. F., 1997). Given the rapid human population growth and the associated economic activities both within the rural and urban areas in Uganda, such fish production systems are becoming very prone to various kinds of pollution including that by heavy metals.

40|$|Heavy {{metal content}} {{of sewage sludge}} is {{currently}} the most significant factor limiting its reuse in agriculture within the European Union. In the Netherlands most of the produced sewage sludge is incinerated, mineralizing the organic carbon into the atmosphere rather than returning {{it back to the}} soil. Source-separation of black water (toilet water) excludes external heavy metal inputs, such as industrial effluents and <b>surface</b> <b>run-offs,</b> producing sludge with reduced heavy metal content that is a more favorable source for resource recovery. The results presented in this paper show that feces is the main contributor to the heavy metal loading of vacuum collected black water (52 - 84 %), while in sewage the contribution of feces is less than 10 %. To distinguish black water from sewage in the sludge reuse regulation, a control parameter should be implemented, such as the Hg and Pb content that is significantly higher in sewage sludge compared to black water sludge (from 50 - to 200 -fold). The heavy metals in feces and urine are primarily from dietary sources, and promotion of the soil application of black water sludge over livestock manure and artificial fertilizers could further reduce the heavy metal content in the soil/food cycle.

40|$|During {{the current}} {{research}} the level of groundwater (piezometers P 2,P 3,P 4) and surface water (reservoir B) contamination during landfill operation and after its closure were examined. 113 samples of groundwater and surface water were collected from spring 2005 until spring 2012, i. e. {{three years after the}} landfill closure. The samples were analyzed for pH, EC, PAH, TOC and six heavy metals: Cr, Hg, Zn, Pb, Cd, Cu. The heavy metal concentration in groundwater and surface water both during landfill operations and after the landfill closure remained on a similar level and did not exceed permissible levels determined by WHO. Cr was an exception, because its concentration, during landfill exploitation, reached the value of 0. 028 mg/l in surface water. In all examined after the landfill was closed a decrease in the EC value was observed. With the landfill closure the TOC concentration in groundwater increased from 1. 8 – 3. 4 to 2. 07 – 3. 6 mg/l and the PAH concentration from 0. 01 to 0. 02 mikrog/l. It may be attributed to a slowdown of decomposition in landfill. An additional PAH source for ground and surface water are <b>surface</b> <b>run-offs</b> form road pavements, yards and parking lots. The remaining high TOC level in a surface reservoir after the landfill closure is also a result of eurotrophisation, which enriches water with organic substances. Seasonal changes in the concentration of pollutants were observed, resulting both from their dilution by atmospheric precipitation (EC, pH, Cd, Cu) and due to washing them out from neighboring areas and enriching with them the analyzed water (Cu, PAH, Hg) ...|$|R

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This thesis {{is concerned with the}} design of press tool run-ofts. Run-off is the area on the punch surrounding the panel and its shape is of great importance to the control of metal flow during the draw. The design, although influenced by engineering considerations, is principally a geometric problem, which traditionally has been time-consuming. The overall objective is to reduce the run-oft definition time and hence improve the lead time. Current Austin Rover design procedures are described in Chapter 2 and form the basis of the C. A. D. program outlined in Chapter 3. This specification distils the need for a number of geometric algorithms. In general, obtaining the required continuity between the panel and <b>run-off</b> <b>surface</b> will require some degree of boundary curve approximation. Chapter 4 details four alternative approximation techniques which are compared in Chapter 5; and constitute the main results of the thesis.

50|$|Despite {{the growth}} of {{vegetation}} in a tropical rainforest, soil quality is often quite poor. Rapid bacterial decay prevents the accumulation of humus. The concentration of iron and aluminium oxides by the laterization process gives the oxisols a bright red colour and sometimes produces mineral deposits such as bauxite. Most trees have roots near the surface, because there are insufficient nutrients below the surface; most of the trees' minerals come from {{the top layer of}} decomposing leaves and animals. On younger substrates, especially of volcanic origin, tropical soils may be quite fertile. If rainforest trees are cleared, rain can accumulate on the exposed soil <b>surfaces,</b> creating <b>run-off</b> and beginning a process of soil erosion.

50|$|Water is a {{particularly}} important issue in dryland farming. The ability to collect and store water at a low cost and without damaging the environment, is what opens up deserts and other arid regions to farmers.

30|$|All {{groundwater}} needs managing {{towards the}} goal of sustainability of supply. To attain this goal, and indeed to reach any properly informed groundwater management decision, the resource needs to be regularly monitored (Taylor & Alley 2001). The prevailing meteorology, variations in <b>surface</b> water <b>run-off</b> and baseflow discharge, groundwater abstraction rates as well as simple groundwater levels all need to be closely watched. The data collected can then be used to construct and validate groundwater flow models, allowing a variety of ‘what if’ scenarios to be formulated, and giving policy-makers essential insight into the likely performance and productivity of their local aquifer. However, monitoring is often inadequate or even absent in many poorer countries, rendering validated modelling impossible. It is these countries that are most at risk of mismanaging groundwater resources, and where the possibility of groundwater ceasing to flow is greatest.|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1983 Polynuclear {{aromatic}} hydrocarbons (PNAH) classified as noncarcinogens may be photooxidized to mutagenic or toxic products by near-ultraviolet (NUV) wavelengths of sunlight (290 - 320 nm). The {{possibility that this}} represents a major degredation pathway in the aquatic environment is of increasing concern. Large quantities of PNAH from accidental oil spills, anthropogenic and natural combustion, <b>surface</b> <b>run-offs,</b> and industrial discharges are being released into the aquatic ecosystem. In addition there is growing evidence that the stratospheric ozone layer may be diminishing. As a result, more NUV wavelengths from sunlight will reach the earth's surface. The {{purpose of this study}} was to design a system that can measure the effects of simulated sunlight (290 nm) irradiated PNAH on mammalian cells. A second observation was to utilize the system developed, to collect preliminary data on the effects of two PNAH parent compounds, fluoranthene and phenanthrene, on mammalian cells. The first set of experiments, conducted during development of the system, involved the selection of methanol as the most suitable PNAH solvent. Determination of the rate of PNAH degradation was also determined during the initial experiments. Other system-related experiments included an analysis of the effects of (a) plastic tissue-culture dishes, (b) methanol, (c) phosphate buffered saline (PBS), and (d) 5 -bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) on the induction of sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) and/or cell survivals of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. The experimental results indicated that none of these factors significantly affected either the survival or the number of induced SCEs in the CHO cells. Preliminary data indicated that in the absence of simulated sunlight, PNAH compounds did not cause an increase in SCEs, nor a decrease in cell survival. However, CHO cells exposed to supersaturated concentrations of fluoranthene and a simulated sunlight (290 nm) light dose of 2000 or 3000 j-sec/m² did not survive. At similar light doses and lower fluoranthene concentrations, the induction of SCEs and mutation frequency were increased. The data from phenanthrene studies indicated there was a decrease in survival in cells exposed to super-saturated concentrations and a simulated sunlight (290 nm) dose of 6000 j-sec/m² The number of SCEs was not increased in cells exposed to lower phenanthrene concentrations and light doses of 2000 or 3000 j-sec/m²...|$|R
