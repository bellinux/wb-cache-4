40|$|Taipei China {{had been}} free from {{foot and mouth disease}} (FMD) over 68 {{years before the}} disease {{occurred}} in March 1997. The first suspected case was recorded on a pig farm in the Hsinchu Prefecture on 14 March 1997. Based on clinical signs, gross histopathological findings, and results of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction tests, diagnosis of FMD was confirmed by the Taiwan Animal Health Research Institute on 19 March 1997 and was reconfirmed by the FMD World Reference Laboratory in Pirbright (United Kingdom), on 25 March 1997. By the end of July 1997, 6, 147 pig farms (about a quarter of the pig farms in Taipei China), were affected. The disease was well under control within two months by means of stamping-out and blanket vaccination. The Government purchased 21 million doses of inactivated oil-adjuvant FMD vaccine, which allowed for two injections per pig and one injection of other cloven-hoofed animals. Before the vaccine was used, the <b>stamping-out</b> <b>policy</b> was implemented, ensuring that all pigs in the affected farms were destroyed. After blanket vaccination, a partial <b>stamping-out</b> <b>policy</b> was adopted, i. e. only pigs showing clinical signs were destroyed...|$|E
40|$|Botswana {{experienced}} {{an outbreak of}} contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP) in February 1995 after 56 years of freedom from the disease. The outbreak was confined to the north-western {{region of the country}} in the Ngamiland District. CBPP was eradicated by applying the <b>stamping-out</b> <b>policy</b> that was implemented in April 1996 and resulted in the slaughter of 320 000 cattle. The Botswana government compensated farmers, offering them different compensation options. By the end of 1997, the restocking exercise introduced 70 000 cattle into Ngamiland. Botswana was declared CBPP-free by the World Organisation of Animal Health in 1998. Prevention strategies, which included border control, quarantine and animal movement controls, were implemented {{to reduce the risk of}} reintroduction of the disease as CBPP is still present in neighbouring countries. Serological surveillance and abattoir inspections are conducted in high-risk areas...|$|E
40|$|Canada {{maintains}} a <b>stamping-out</b> <b>policy</b> {{for control of}} foreign animal disease. Integral to stamping out, there are obligatory animal movement restrictions that, over time, can result in severe animal welfare problems. The {{purpose of this study}} was to estimate the time to critical overcrowding in a sample of Manitoba swine farms, if they were placed under movement restriction. Time to critical overcrowding in both static and dynamic populations was estimated by modeling swine growth and projecting anticipated on-farm stocking density through time and comparing it with a standard maximal stocking density. The time to critical overcrowding of 15 isowean piglet production units was 0. 66 ± 0. 88 weeks. On average, 7 isolated nursery facilities reached critical overcrowding in 52 ± 14 days and 5 farrow-to-finish operations reached critical overcrowding in 43 ± 18 days. Animal welfare concerns should be included in contingency plans to control foreign animal disease...|$|E
40|$|Highly {{pathogenic}} {{avian influenza}} (HPAI) {{is a striking}} disease in susceptible poultry, which leads to severe economic losses. Inactivated vaccines are {{the most widely used}} vaccines in avian influenza virus (AIV) vaccination programs. However, these vaccines interfere with the serological detection of wild-type AIV infections in immunized populations. The use of vaccines that allow differentiation between infected and vaccinated animals (DIVA strategy) would stop current <b>stamping-out</b> <b>policies.</b> Therefore, novel vaccination strategies are needed to allow improved protection of animals and humans against HPAI virus (HPAIV) infection. The presented study analyzed {{for the first time the}} immunogenic capacity of plant-expressed full-length hemagglutinin (rHA 0) of HPAIV H 5 N 1 in several vaccine formulations within the highly relevant host species chicken. We were able to express plant-expressed rHA 0 at high levels and could show that, when administered with potent adjuvants, it is highly immunogenic and can fully protect chicken against lethal challenge infection. Real-time reverse transcription (RT) -PCR and serological tests demonstrated only marginally increased virus replication in animals vaccinated with plant-derived rHA 0 compared to animals immunized with an inactivated reference vaccine. In addition, the use of plant-expressed rHA 0 also allowed an easy serological differentiation of vaccinated from AIV-infected animals based on antibodies against the influenza virus NP protein...|$|R
40|$|Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides "Small Colony" (MmmSC) is {{responsible}} for contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP) in bovidae, a notifiable disease to the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE). Although its origin is not documented, the disease was known in Europe in 1773. It reached nearly world-wide distribution in the 19 (th) century through the cattle trade and was eradicated from most continents by <b>stamping-out</b> <b>policies.</b> During the 20 (th) century it persisted in Africa, and it reappeared sporadically in Southern Europe. Yet, classical epidemiology studies failed to explain the re-occurrence of the disease in Europe in the 1990 s. The objectives {{of this study were}} to obtain a precise phylogeny of this pathogen, reconstruct its evolutionary history, estimate the date of its emergence, and determine the origin of the most recent European outbreaks. A large-scale genomic approach based on next-generation sequencing technologies was applied to construct a robust phylogeny of this extremely monomorphic pathogen by using 20 representative strains of various geographical origins. Sixty two polymorphic genes of the MmmSC core genome were selected, representing 83601 bp in total and resulting in 139 SNPs within the 20 strains. A robust phylogeny was obtained that identified a lineage specific to European strains; African strains were scattered in various branches. Bayesian analysis allowed dating the most recent common ancestor for MmmSC around 1700. The strains circulating in Sub-Saharan Africa today, however, were shown to descend from a strain that existed around 1810. MmmSC emerged recently, about 300 years ago, and was most probably exported from Europe to other continents, including Africa, during the 19 (th) century. Its diversity is now greater in Africa, where CBPP is enzootic, than in Europe, where outbreaks occurred sporadically until 1999 and where CBPP may now be considered eradicated unless MmmSC remains undetected...|$|R
40|$|Highly {{pathogenic}} {{avian influenza}} (HPAI) H 5 N 1 virus continues to circulate in poultry in Asia and Africa posing {{a threat to}} both public and animal health. Vaccination, used {{as an adjunct to}} improved bio-security and <b>stamping-out</b> <b>policies,</b> contributed to protecting poultry in Hong Kong from HPAI H 5 N 1 infection in 2004 - 2008 although the virus was repeatedly detected in dead wild birds. The detection of clade 2. 3. 4 H 5 N 1 viruses in poultry markets and a farm in Hong Kong in 2008 raised the question whether this virus has changed to evade protection from the H 5 vaccines in use. We tested the efficacy of three commercial vaccines (Nobilis, Poulvac and Harbin Re- 5 vaccine) in specific pathogen free white leghorn chickens against a challenge with A/chicken/Hong Kong/ 8825 - 2 / 2008 (clade 2. 3. 4) isolated from vaccinated poultry in Hong Kong and A/chicken/Hong Kong/ 782 / 2009 (clade 2. 3. 2). Harbin Re 5 vaccine provided the best, albeit not complete protection against challenge with the clade 2. 3. 4 virus. All three vaccines provided good protection from death and significantly reduced virus shedding following challenge with the clade 2. 3. 2 virus. Only Harbin Re- 5 was able to completely protect chickens from virus shedding as well as mortality. Sera from vaccinated chickens had lower geometric hemagglutination inhibition titers against A/chicken/Hong Kong/ 8825 - 2 / 08, as compared to two other clade 2. 3. 4 and one clade 0 virus. Alignment of amino-acid sequences of the haemagglutinin of A/chicken/Hong Kong/ 8825 - 2 / 08 and the other H 5 viruses revealed several mutations in positions including 69, 71, 83, 95, 133, 140, 162, 183, 189, 194 and 270 (H 5 numbering) which may correlate with loss of vaccine protection. Our results indicated that the tested HPAI H 5 N 1 (2. 3. 4) virus has undergone antigenic changes that allow it to evade immunity from poultry vaccines. This highlights the need for continued surveillance and monitoring of vaccine induced immunity, with experimental vaccine challenge studies being done where indicated...|$|R
40|$|The <b>stamping-out</b> <b>policy</b> for {{the control}} of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) in {{countries}} that are free from FMD without vaccination has a dramatic socio-economic impact, huge animal welfare issues and may result {{in the loss of}} farm animal genetic resources. As an alternative to pre-emptive culling or emergency vaccination we further explore the possibility to use antiviral drugs {{in the event of an}} FMD outbreak. In the present study, we tested the in vitro cytotoxicity and anti-FMDV activity of 1, 2, 4, 5 -tetrahydro-[1, 4]thiazepino[4, 5 -a]benzimidazole. The molecule was shown to inhibit the replication of reference strains of the Eurasian FMDV serotypes O, A, C and Asia but not the FMDV serotypes from the South African Territories (SAT) neither a related picornavirus, i. e. swine vesicular disease virus. The molecule can be added until 2 h post inoculation in a 'single replication cycle experiment' without losing its antiviral activity. The genetic characterization of progressively selected resistant FMD viruses shows that the molecule presumably interacts with the non-structural 2 C protein of FMDV. Further studies are required on the use of this molecule in vivo. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Summary: Recent {{epizootics}} {{of highly}} contagious OIE List A diseases, such as foot and mouth disease, {{classical swine fever}} and avian influenza (AI), led {{to the implementation of}} stamping-out policies resulting in the depopulation of millions of animals. The enforcement of a control strategy that is based only on the application of sanitary restrictions on farms and that involves the culling of animals that are infected, suspected of being infected or suspected of being contaminated, may not be sufficient to avoid the spread of infection, particularly in areas that have high animal densities, and thus results in mass depopulation. In the European Union, the directive that imposes the enforcement of a <b>stamping-out</b> <b>policy</b> (92 / 40 /EC) for AI was adopted in 1992, although it was drafted in the 1980 s. The poultry industry has undergone substantial changes in the past 20 years, mainly resulting in shorter production cycles and in greater animal densities per territorial unit. Due to these changes, infectious animal diseases are significantly more difficult to control because of the greater number of susceptible animals reared per given unit of time and to the difficulties in applying adequate biosecurity measures. The slaughter and destruction of large numbers of animals is also questionable from an ethical poin...|$|E
40|$|A devastating {{outbreak}} of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), {{caused by a}} porcinophilic serotype O virus, occurred in Taiwan in March 1997. This outbreak was brought under control {{by means of a}} <b>stamping-out</b> <b>policy</b> and vaccination. Although mandatory vaccination was conducted in Taiwan between 1997 and 2007, sporadic outbreaks of FMD occurred between 1998 and 2009; however, the viruses that caused these outbreaks remain uncharacterized. This article reports the genetic and antigenic characterization of FMD viruses isolated in Taiwan during this period. Sequence analysis of the VP 1 coding region showed that the viruses isolated in Taiwan between 1998 and 2009 were most similar to viruses isolated in Taiwan in 1997 and to viruses isolated from Hong Kong and Vietnam in 1991 - 1996. The results of phylogenetic analysis suggested that the viruses isolated in Taiwan in 1998 - 2009 were derived from the viruses isolated in Taiwan in 1997. However, substantial mutations were found in the viruses isolated in 2009, and some of these changes may have resulted from vaccine pressure in the field. Serum neutralization tests confirmed that viruses isolated in 2009 showed a significant change in antigenicity. This is the first report of changes in the VP 1 sequence and antigenicity of porcinophilic FMD viruses isolated from an area in which long-term mandatory vaccination against FMD was practiced.

40|$|H 5 and H 9 {{influenza}} virus isolates in Japan were genetically and antigenically characterized {{and the birds}} infected with the virus were pathologically examined. In 2005, H 5 N 2 {{influenza virus}}es were isolated form layer chickens in Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan and the Ibaraki prefectural governor declared {{the end of the}} H 5 N 2 outbreak in June, 2006, 1 year after the first detection. Sixteen H 5 N 2 viruses were isolated from 9 farms of the affected 41 farms. Phylogenetic and antigenic analysis of the isolates showed that these isolates were closely related to the H 5 N 2 strains prevalent in Central America that have been circulating since 1994. Experimental infection of chickens with the index isolate (A/chicken/Ibaraki/ 1 / 2005 (H 5 N 2)) demonstrated that this virus replicated efficiently in the respiratory tract without clinical signs. Pathological findings of the chickens indicated that the virus efficiently replicated in salivary epithelial cells. The virus was transmitted among the chickens in separated cage. This result indicated that the infection to chickens spread by droplet transmission in the outbreaks. In 2008, H 5 N 1 highly pathogenic avian influenza virus was isolated from whooper swans (Cygnus cygnus) found dead in Hokkaido, Japan. Pathological findings indicate that the swan died due to severe congestive edema in the lungs. Phylogenetic analysis of the HA genes of the isolates revealed that these are the progeny viruses of the isolates Clade 2. 3. 2 from poultry and wild birds in China, Russia, Korea, and Hong Kong. Antigenic analyses indicated that the viruses are different from the H 5 N 1 viruses isolated from wild birds and poultry before 2007. The chickens vaccinated with A/duck/Hokkaido/Vac- 1 / 2004 (H 5 N 1) survived 14 days after challenge with the isolate, although small amount of the challenge virus was recovered from the tissues of the birds. These findings indicate that the H 5 N 1 highly pathogenic avian influenza virus are circulating in wild birds in addition to domestic poultry in Asia and showing antigenic variation that may be due to vaccination. Recently, H 9 N 2 influenza viruses were isolated from poultry and mammals in Asian countries. The hemagglutinins (HAs) of H 9 influenza viruses isolated from birds and mammals of different species were antigenically and genetically analyzed. Based on the reactivity patterns with the panel of 8 monoclonal antibodies, 21 H 9 N 2 virus strains isolated from birds and mammals were divided into 7 antigenically distinct groups. The present findings indicate that H 9 N 2 viruses are genetically and antigenically varied. The vaccinations to poultry in some countries resulted in antigenic variation of H 5 and H 9 influenza viruses isolated in Asia. These result indicate that the <b>stamping-out</b> <b>policy</b> is most important to control for avian influenza. 日本で分離されたH 5 およびH 9 インフルエンザウイルスについて、遺伝子と抗原性を解析するとともに、宿主鳥の病理学的検索を実施した。 2005 年、茨城県下で採卵鶏に鳥インフルエンザが発生し、流行が終息するまでに一年を要した。感染が確認された 41 農場のうち 9 農場の鶏から 16 株のH 5 N 2 ウイルスが分離された。分離株の抗原性および遺伝子解析の結果、いずれも 1994 年から中米の家禽で流行しているH 5 N 2 ウイルスと極めて近縁であることが明らかになった。分離株A/chicken/Ibaraki/ 1 / 2005 (H 5 N 2) を実験感染させたニワトリは、臨床症状を示さなかったが、呼吸器からウイルスが回収された。病理検索の結果、唾液腺上皮細胞でウイルスが効率よく増殖していることが判った。また、本ウイルスは隔離ケージ間のニワトリに伝播したことから、飛沫により鶏群に感染が拡大したと推察された。 2008 年、北海道のサロマ湖畔で発見された斃死オオハクチョウから、H 5 N 1 高病原性鳥インフルエンザウイルスを分離した。この斃死体の病理学的検索の結果、死因は重度の肺のうっ血性浮腫であった。分離ウイルス遺伝子の解析により、中国、ロシア、韓国および日本の秋田県、青森県で同年に分離されたウイルスと近縁であり、クレード 2. 3. 2 に属することが判った。分離ウイルスはこれまでに分離されたH 5 N 1 ウイルスの抗原性と大きく異なっていたため、国内備蓄Vac- 1 ワクチンの本ウイルスの攻撃に対するワクチンの防御免疫賦与効果を調べた。攻撃後、ワクチン接種ニワトリの組織の一部からウイルスが回収されたが、いずれの鳥も 14 日間症状を呈することなく生残した。すなわち、国内備蓄ワクチンは現在流行しているウイルスの感染に対しても、防御効果を示した。近年アジアの家禽や哺乳動物からH 9 N 2 インフルエンザウイルスが分離されている。そこで、アジアの家禽に流行しているウイルスに近縁なA/swine/HongKong/ 10 / 1998 （H 9 N 2 ）および野生水禽から分離されたA/duck/Hokkaido/ 13 / 2000 (H 9 N 2) に対するモノクローン抗体を作出し、当研究室のインフルエンザウイルスライブラリーに保管されている 21 株のH 9 ウイルスの抗原性を解析した。その結果、調べたH 9 N 2 ウイルスは抗原性と遺伝子が多様であることが分かった。これらの鳥インフルエンザウイルスの抗原性が多様であることの理由として、一部の国で家禽にH 5 およびH 9 ウイルスワクチンが使用されていることが挙げられる。以上の成績は、家禽のインフルエンザは早期摘発淘汰を基本とする対策によって制圧されることを示している...|$|E
