However, only a purely analytical evaluation of the modeling approaches does not alwaysreflect their practical usefulness. Hence, the [motivation] of the thesis was selecting two modeling approaches, those are Secure Tropos and Misuse Cases, using an empirical investigation for such evaluations to guide the researchers and practitioners a better overview and understanding of the benefits of the two modeling approaches in a real life usage. The objective was to see if the advantages claimed analytically in the previous project also come true in practice. [Questions] Through a controlled experiment, two core problems shall be investigated: a) How about the participants&# 146; performance when they applied the two modeling approaches to finish tasks in the experiment and b) Their preference for the two modeling approaches after the experiment. The [principle] was using two modeling approaches to perform the experiment, through the participants&# 146; performance on the identified number of threats and mitigations for the experiment cases, and their perception of the two modeling approaches by means of asking them to estimate the usage of modeling diagrams, textual description of cases, and memory in the experiment. And combining with the evaluation of post-questionnaire analysis, the conclusions were summarized based on the empirical study of statistical results and the previous analytical study results, to investigate whether the empirical evaluation could match well with analytical evaluation or not. [Contribution] The experiment project was the first time to compare the Secure Troposand Misuse Cases comprehensibly. The results illustrated that both modeling techniqueshad no significant difference of identifying threats but they had significant difference of identifying mitigations in this controlled experiment with 50 students who apply to both modeling approaches with relevant cases. And through analyzing the same case with the same modeling approach or different modeling approach of the experiment, it was found that <b>Net</b> <b>Shopping</b> case was identified more mitigations and threats by the participants when considering the aspect of technique criteria of threats and mitigations. The participants were complementary regarding goal-based modeling approach in some security issues and performed non-techniques threats and mitigations in this controlled experiment. Hence, Secure Tropos was investigated perceiving more favorable. In the last, comparing with the six dimensions from previous analytical comparison, the investigation shows that most of the two modeling approaches&# 146; advantages were confirmed, and the results also coincided to the previous analytical evaluation.

40|$|Application of {{computer}} technology in the Earth science {{has led to the}} creation and development of new scientific disciplines, particularly digital cartography and GIS. This paper describes the application of GIS from several points of view such as: multi-scale, multi-thematic, multi-viewing, accommodation to standard software platforms and multi-user data accesses. Introduction The premise of a successful usage of topographic data nowadays implies their disposal in a digital form and organisation in a modern way, suitable for further computer processing. It is a unanimous opinion that it can be successfully completed only through creating data basis of space developing GIS. The theme of the written work is the development and application of GIS, and management of topographic data in accordance with international standards and users' needs. Moving to digital technology of creating and using topographic data should not be literal translation of the analogue map into a digital picture or just the automation of the map making using digital technology. The new method implies the formation of the central topographic data base which would generate displays of arbitrary scales, desired volumes of content, changeable sheet dimensions, various thematic displays, altogether in accordance with users' demands and needs. Digital cartography and GIS The development and application {{of computer}}s in the area of earth sciences caused the creation of new definitions and disciplines among which are noticeable computer supported cartography and GIS. The computer-supported cartography was in its later phase called digital cartography and it can be used in two ways: like modern technology of date processing about space and like a new discipline. The main principle on which digital cartography as a discipline is based represents the processing and visualization of data about space but with computer supported technology. Application of GIS from various aspects Topographic maps have existed for many years in more or less similar or the same traditional form. By creating the basic data base about space through the application of GIS technology, a wide range of possibilities for dynamic selection of content appears. This content will further be shown on the screen or as a drawing on a piece of paper. The aspects of multidisciplinarity promote topographic data base as a significant part of general spatial data infrastructure. Application from the multiscale aspect There are different information levels which differ among themselves in quantity and content of data necessary for various levels of observation management and decision making. One of the principal tasks which emerges is a choice of the basic scale and resolution of the display for which the data are gathered. In cartography, that is a scale of 1 : 25, 000, based on which the topographic map (TM) is created. Mutual complement of GIS and WWW will completely change the classic delivery of spatial data. Various topographic and thematic maps will be created and obtained from the unique data base. Application from the multithematic aspect The main objective of the formation of spatial data infrastructure is the creation of the standard GIS platform but also the possibility of multi purpose application of GIS for environment (farming, forestry, waterpower engineering) land development (commercial and business), itinerary analysis, tracing of retail and wholesale routes distributional <b>nets</b> (<b>shops</b> and warehouse locations) media and marketing planning (locations, sales territory, sales prospects, market analysis according to users), finances - insurance (from the users aspect, investors and areas of low/high risk), healthcare (general healthcare, appearance of epidemic and its spreading) and non-productive activities (tourism, archaeology, environment protection). Application from the aspect of multidisplay Once formed, the spatial data base, or GIS, should offer to the user a lot of graphic, descriptive and other important information which is, in fact, a digital or traditional display in a form of a determined output. One of the ways of using GIS implies cartographic publishing (getting the reproductive originals and printing geographic map sheets) in a traditional form. Application from the aspect of adjustment to standard software platforms In the groundbreaking period of civilization with radical changes in a scientific - technological sphere, it was necessary to select a new, most suitable software platform with attaching hardware components. After thorough analyses (analyses of foreign and national literature and the usage of demo versions of various GIS software), the American company ESRI software platform was selected. Application from the aspect of multiusers data access Internet and Intranet are deeply rooted technologies and have been increasingly used as technologies to accomplish the growing number of distributed informational systems. Therefore, the above-mentioned technologies are needed for distributed work with spatial data. Maintenance of GIS data The maintenance of the topographic data denotes a process of updating old-fashioned content and entering new geospatial data as well as the elimination and the correction of details which are not in accordance with the real state on the field. In connection with the volume and the method of work, difference should be made between the spatial data maintenance aspects for the basic scale, which refer to the entire content and specific elements of the content. Regarding periods in which the present space data maintenance is done, there are continuous and periodical ones. Conclusion When establishing the unique GIS, we ought to apply a principle according to which all the data once gathered in one State institution can be used variedly as well as in many other institutions (military, administrative, economic, scientific, cultural, etc.). This principle does not apply only to the rationalization but also to uniqueness and quality of the research of common geospace. In the present state of the development, it is hard to predict the trends of cartographic and generally speaking GIS processes, but the most important is that topographic data have digital form the meaning of which is universal, regardless of the current development of technique and technology...|$|R
