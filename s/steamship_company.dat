By December 1935, West Ekonk had begun sailing for another subsidiary of Lykes Brothers, the Ripley <b>Steamship</b> <b>Company,</b> and continued sailing on the same Galveston–Liverpool route through September 1937. West Ekonks activities {{over the next three}} years are not recorded.|$|E
5|$|SS Montanan was a {{cargo ship}} built in 1912 for the American-Hawaiian <b>Steamship</b> <b>Company.</b> During World War I {{service for the}} United States Army Transport Service, she was known as USAT Montanan.

During the 1930s, Lykes Brothers operated cargo ships between Gulf Coast and Caribbean ports, and though there is little specific information available regarding West Cobalts movements, {{it is likely that}} she called at Gulf coast and Caribbean ports as well. One specific mention of the ship is found in a report in The New York Times in 1937, when the newspaper reported West Cobalts arrival in New York on 30 October, ten days after sailing from New Orleans.|$|E

The Great Western <b>Steamship</b> <b>Company,</b> which had opened its pioneer Bristol–New York service earlier that year, bid £45,000 for a monthly Bristol–Halifax–New York service using three ships of 450 horsepower. While British American, the other pioneer transatlantic <b>steamship</b> <b>company,</b> did not submit a tender, the St. George Steam Packet Company, owner of Sirius, bid £45,000 for a monthly Cork–Halifax service and £65,000 for a monthly Cork–Halifax–New York service. The Admiralty rejected both tenders because neither bid offered to begin services early enough.|$|E

5|$|On June 14, 1941, the Baltimore Steam Packet Company's owner, the Seaboard Air Line Railroad, {{entered into}} an {{agreement}} with a consortium of railroads and steamship companies to merge the Chesapeake <b>Steamship</b> <b>Company</b> into the Old Bay Line. The railroad group, consisting of the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad, Southern Railway, and the SAL, together controlled the Baltimore Steam Packet Company and the Chesapeake <b>Steamship</b> <b>Company.</b> As a result, the Old Bay Line took over the Chesapeake Line's business and assets and became the sole operator of passenger and freight steamship transportation between the important ports of Baltimore and Norfolk. As part of this agreement, half of the outstanding shares of the Baltimore Steam Packet Company was assigned to Chesapeake <b>Steamship</b> <b>Company,</b> which was one-third owned by Southern Railway and two-thirds owned by the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad. With the amalgamation, two of the Chesapeake Line's steamboats, the City of Norfolk and City of Richmond, were transferred to the Old Bay Line. As it turned out, these {{would be the last}} two vessels operated by the Old Bay Line when it went out of business in 1962. Robert E.

5000|$|In 1892, Chandler {{proposed}} a one-year ban on immigration, {{to keep out}} undesirables, which included cholera carriers, Anarchists, Nihilists, polygamists, Mafia members, illiterates, [...] "blind or crippled" [...] persons, persons without means, etc. Among the solutions Chandler proposed for addressing the [...] "evils which have been made apparent by the vast increase, within recent years, of degraded immigrants from Italy, Turkey, Hungary, Poland and Russia proper" [...] were the addition of an educational requirement and property qualification for all persons or families seeking to emigrate to the United States. [...] The strongest opponents of the bill were the <b>steamship</b> <b>companies,</b> who stood to lose {{a major portion of}} their business. A watered-down version of The Chandler Immigration and Contract Labor Bill became law on March 3, 1893. It simply required <b>steamship</b> <b>companies</b> to prepare lists of their passengers containing full information, and thus very likely served as a compromise to get the <b>steamship</b> <b>companies</b> to back down on Immigration Reform at this time.|$|R
5|$|The American Palestine Line was a <b>steamship</b> <b>company,</b> {{formed in}} 1924 in the U.S., {{for the purpose}} of {{providing}} direct passenger service from New York to Palestine. It was reportedly the first <b>steamship</b> <b>company</b> owned and operated by Jews. The company negotiated to purchase three ocean liners from the United States Shipping Board, but it was only able to purchase one, , a former North German Lloyd steamer that operated as Princess Alice before being seized by the United States during World War I. After refurbishing the liner, the company inaugurated service between New York and Palestine in March 1925, when President Arthur sailed on her maiden voyage. A crowd of 15,000 witnessed ceremonies that included songs, prayers, and speeches in English and Yiddish. The company claimed that President Arthur was the first ocean liner to fly the Zionist flag at sea and the first ocean liner ever to have female officers.|$|E
