50|$|The term audio/video {{receiver}} (AVR) or Home Theater Receiver is used {{to distinguish}} the multi-channel audio/video receiver (home theater receiver) from the simpler <b>stereo</b> <b>receiver,</b> though the primary function of both is amplification.|$|E
50|$|FM stereo radio {{stations}} broadcast in stereophonic sound (stereo), transmitting two sound channels representing {{left and right}} microphones. A <b>stereo</b> <b>receiver</b> contains the additional circuits and parallel signal paths to reproduce the two separate channels. While AM stereo transmitters and receivers exist, they have not achieved the popularity of FM stereo.|$|E
50|$|In 1983 dyras {{issued its}} first {{illustrated}} catalogue offering more than 2500 products including measuring instruments, consumer electronics, components, electromechanical parts, assembly kits and groups, tools, electric appliances and books. In 1984 dyras launched its new audio line comprising a multi-band <b>stereo</b> <b>receiver</b> with cassette recorder and linear-phase loudspeaker boxes both manufactured in Japan.|$|E
5000|$|... 1968 - The first joint tests {{between the}} Dutch and Belgian organisations {{included}} hairdryers, dishwashers, <b>stereo</b> <b>receivers</b> and model trains. A test of hotels in Majorca was also joined by Germany.|$|R

50|$|In 1993, the FCC {{declared}} Motorola's C-QUAM {{system the}} standard. To {{ensure that all}} AM <b>stereo</b> <b>receivers</b> maintained the same sound quality, the National Association of Broadcasters and the Electronic Industries Association started the AMAX certification program.|$|R
5000|$|WION-AM stereo began {{streaming}} it's 24/7 programming on February 1, 2013 on the 60th {{anniversary of}} the station. The source of the feed is the actual [...] "over the air" [...] AM stereo signal from a Carver-brand AM <b>stereo</b> <b>receiver.</b> Many comments about the remarkable sound of this station are posted on the station's own website on the [...] "comments" [...] page, from e-mails, Facebook and other sources.|$|E
50|$|If no 19 kHz {{pilot tone}} is present, then any signals in the 23-53 kHz range are ignored by a <b>stereo</b> <b>receiver.</b> A guard band of ±4 kHz (15-23 kHz) protects the pilot tone from {{interference}} from the baseband audio signal (50 Hz-15 kHz) {{and from the}} lower sideband of the double sideband stereo information (23-53 kHz). The third harmonic of the pilot (19&times;3, or 57 kHz) is used for Radio Data System.|$|E
5000|$|In 1985, RCA {{released}} a fully integrated audio system {{known as the}} [...] "RCA Audio System" [...] that used the MSR-140 <b>stereo</b> <b>receiver</b> as its center for control over all the components. This allowed all Dimensia audio components to be controlled and fully functional without the need of a Dimensia television set. The price of this system started at $1,500 and included the Digital Command Center remote control. It also used the Colortrak 2000 monitor.|$|E
5000|$|One of the longest-lived radio {{broadcasts}} was WQSR-FM [...] "Quad 102½" [...] in Sarasota, Florida. Throughout {{most of the}} 1970s this station broadcast a signal which could be tuned as two separate stations with conventional <b>stereo</b> <b>receivers.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... 1984: General Motors, Ford, Chrysler, and {{a number}} of import {{automakers}} begin installing C-QUAM AM <b>stereo</b> <b>receivers</b> in automobiles, beginning with the 1985 model year. Harris Corporation abandons its AM stereo system and puts its support behind C-QUAM (Harris continues to manufacture C-QUAM equipment today).|$|R
50|$|The Orion Scientific Production Association in Moscow {{is a major}} designer, developer, and {{manufacturer}} of high technology military and aerospace electronics. It also produces special electronics for the space industry, which are used in both space launchers and satellites. In 1991, Orion entered into an agreement with a Russian-French joint venture radio station to produce commercial <b>stereo</b> <b>receivers.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Model 2600 was {{the most}} {{powerful}} <b>stereo</b> <b>receiver</b> ever made by Marantz, {{and one of the}} most powerful receivers of the [...] "monster receiver" [...] era of the 1970s, among the Technics SA-1000, rated at 330 watts per channel, tied with the Sansui G-33000, and the Pioneer SX-1980. The 2600 was rated at 300 watts RMS per channel x2 channels at 8 ohms and 400 W.P.C. at 4 ohms. This model was produced from 1978 to 1980 and is considered especially rare.|$|E
50|$|In July 1983, KBLZ, “The Blitz”, began {{broadcasting}} over {{cable television}} on 93.7 FM. The cable radio station {{could only be}} heard by subscribers of Edmond Cablevision who had to purchase a CATV splitter and connect a <b>stereo</b> <b>receiver</b> from the cable box. Students programmed the station from 6 pm until midnight. The format was a blend of album-oriented rock (AOR) and Contemporary Hits. The station {{was made possible by}} the combined efforts of Dr. Mike Dunn, director of KCSC, Dr. Jack Deskin of CSU-2 television station and Barbara Norman, chair of the Oral Communications Department.|$|E
50|$|The Kahn-Hazeltine {{system also}} called ISB was {{developed}} by American engineer Leonard R. Kahn and the Hazeltine Corporation. This system used an entirely different principle—using independently modulated upper and lower sidebands. While a station using the system would sound best with proper decoding, it was also possible to use two standard AM radios (one tuned above and the other below the primary carrier) to achieve the stereophonic effect, although with poor stereo separation and fidelity compared to a proper Kahn system AM <b>stereo</b> <b>receiver.</b> One {{of the best known}} stations to use the Kahn system was 890/WLS, Chicago. WLS still transmits in AM stereo today but uses the Motorola C-QUAM system instead.|$|E
5000|$|A few {{of their}} {{innovations}} were very futuristic. From 1939 to 1941, they sold radios that were remotely operated by wireless controls, the one-tube [...] "Mystery Control", used on their 13-tube model 116RX-SU (or 39-116). This feature was not offered by any other maker until the 1970s <b>stereo</b> <b>receivers.</b> Philco ranked 57th among United States corporations {{in the value of}} World War II military production contracts.|$|R
50|$|There were regular columns for Citizens Band (CB), amateur {{radio and}} shortwave {{listening}} (SWL). These would show a reader with his radio equipment each month. (Almost {{all of the}} readers were male.) Lou Garner's Transistor Topics covers the new transistorized FM <b>stereo</b> <b>receivers</b> and several readers' circuits. John T. Frye's fictional characters, Carl and Jerry, use a PH meter to locate the source of pollution in a river.|$|R
5000|$|Of {{note was}} E. J. Korvette's {{venture into the}} home {{entertainment}} business. The retailer established a rather out of context series of high-end audio salons within selected stores. Korvettes {{went so far as}} to market its own [...] "XAM" [...] brand of <b>stereo</b> <b>receivers,</b> amplifiers (some manufactured by Roland Electronics of Japan), television sets, and speakers. XAM was rumored to be a tribute to the owner's deceased dog, Max.) ...|$|R
50|$|In {{spite of}} its many advantages, {{the high cost of}} {{implementing}} a Loran-C receiver made it uneconomical for many users. Additionally, as military users upgraded from Loran-A to Loran-C, large numbers of surplus Loran-A receivers were dumped on the market. This made Loran-A popular in spite of being less accurate and fairly difficult to operate. By the early 1970s the introduction of integrated circuits combining a complete radio receiver began to greatly reduce the complexity of Loran-A measurements, and fully automated units the size of a <b>stereo</b> <b>receiver</b> became common. For those users requiring higher accuracy, Decca had considerable success with their Decca Navigator system, and produced units that combined both receivers, using Loran to eliminate the ambiguities in Decca.|$|E
5000|$|In 1958, Harman Kardon {{introduced}} one of {{the first}} stereo receivers, the Festival TA230, once again aimed at non-technical users with the intention of making high-fidelity stereo widely available. Stereo sound was achieved by using one channel from the AM band, and one channel from the FM band. This early form of stereophonic reception was called simulcast stereo. Early FM broadcast signals did not have the stereo carrier (pilot) signal that carried the stereo left and right channels. After the stereo signal standard was established, a stereo multiplex circuit connected to or built into the receiver was used to decode the stereo signal. (The first true FM Multiplex <b>Stereo</b> <b>Receiver</b> was sold by H.H. Scott in 1961 with introduction of the Model 350 tuner.) ...|$|E
5000|$|A special run {{of twelve}} Diablo VT's was {{produced}} {{exclusively for the}} United States market in 1999 and called the Alpine Edition. As the Diablo had been utilizing Alpine stereo equipment since its inception, this very limited production was intended to showcase and celebrate the Lamborghini/Alpine connection. The Alpine Edition was a fairly standard Diablo VT with no engine modifications and some extra bits of carbon fiber trim in various locations, but the big news was the multimedia system. The <b>stereo</b> <b>receiver</b> was the top-end CVA-1005 model, with integrated navigation system; {{also included in the}} package was a DVD player, 6-disc CD changer, and Alpine's top quality tweeters, midrange drivers, and subwoofers, powered by [...] "Lamborghini" [...] badged Alpine amplifiers. Alpine logos adorned the seat headrests, floormats, and the special car cover included with this rare model.|$|E
5000|$|In the interim, the Garrard {{brand name}} was {{licensed}} to other {{companies in the}} USA, which imported many electronic items built by many different and unrelated Far Eastern manufacturers. Thus, one can find [...] "Garrard" [...] cassette decks, CD players, <b>stereo</b> <b>receivers,</b> boom-box radio/cassette machines, portable [...] "Walkman" [...] type cassette players, serial-port printer cables, universal TV/audio remote controls, and other miscellany, including turntables {{that had nothing to}} do with any original Garrard design.|$|R
50|$|The company debuted a hi-fidelity {{audio speaker}} in Japan in 1965 with the brand Technics. This line {{of high quality}} stereo {{components}} became worldwide favorites, the most famous products being its turntables, such as the SL-1200 record player, known for its high performance, precision and durability. Throughout the 1970s and early 1980s, Panasonic continued to produce high-quality specialized electronics for niche markets such as shortwave radios, and developed its successful line of <b>stereo</b> <b>receivers,</b> CD players and other components.|$|R
5000|$|... "Duophonic" [...] {{was used}} as a trade name for the process by Capitol Records for re-releases of mono {{recordings}} from June 1961 through the 1970s. Capitol employed this technique in order to increase their inventory of stereo LPs, to satisfy retailer demand for more stereo content (and help promote the sale of <b>stereo</b> <b>receivers</b> and turntables). For nearly ten years, Capitol used the banner [...] "DUOPHONIC - For Stereo Phonographs Only" [...] to differentiate their true stereo LPs from the Duophonic LPs.|$|R
5000|$|From {{the late}} 1970s to around 1980, the station used the call letters WRSW, until student {{management}} {{realized there was}} already a real WRSW licensed to Warsaw, Indiana. In addition to being heard in the dorms on 640 AM, local cable TV subscribers could get the station at 91.9 FM if they connected their cable to their home <b>stereo</b> <b>receiver.</b> During the spring of 1980, new student management began to explore {{the possibility of an}} actual FM station. In the fall of 1980, a petition was circulated on campus, and student government came up with the funds necessary to perform a frequency search for the new station. A company known as Educational FM associates did the search for a fee of $1800.00. A copy of the petition ( [...] the actual roots of today's WFNP) will be posted at a later date.|$|E
5000|$|FM {{broadcast}} radio sends music and voice with less noise than AM radio. It is often mistakenly thought that FM is higher fidelity than AM, {{but that is}} not true. AM is capable of the same audio bandwidth that FM employs. AM receivers typically use narrower filters in the receiver to recover the signal with less noise. AM stereo receivers can reproduce the same audio bandwidth that FM does due to the wider filter used in an AM <b>stereo</b> <b>receiver,</b> but today, AM radios limit the audio bandpass to 3-5 kHz. In frequency modulation, amplitude variation at the microphone causes the transmitter frequency to fluctuate. Because the audio signal modulates the frequency and not the amplitude, an FM signal is not subject to static and interference {{in the same way as}} AM signals. Due to its need for a wider bandwidth, FM is transmitted in the Very High Frequency (VHF, 30 MHz to 300 MHz) radio spectrum.|$|E
5000|$|The {{company was}} founded in 1961 by Ralph Yeomans, a {{concessionaire}} in Fedco (a discount membership store chain in southern California, until the chain closed in 1999). Early Soundcraftsmen components included tube-type receivers and amplifiers. Ralph Yeomans and Charles Gassett, a southern California audio equipment representative and international marketing entrepreneur selling Coastron Sherwood Electronic Laboratories receivers at the time, {{had an interest in}} expanding the brand nationwide. Yeomans and Gassett decided the first product was to be an equalizer, something not already on the market. They employed an electronics engineer, Paul Rolfes, in 1968 to design the equalizer. It was introduced by Gassett at the 1969 CES in New York. National distribution started in late 1970. In the mid-1970s they introduced their line of preamplifiers and power amplifiers, including the first preamplifier/equalizer combo. Soundcraftsmen equalizers and their compact [...] "brick" [...] style power amplifiers gained a sizable following among audiophiles during the 1970s and 1980s. All Soundcraftsmen equalizers and amplifiers were made at the company's Santa Ana, California facility. In the early 1970s they also sold a solid-state <b>stereo</b> <b>receiver,</b> but only through the Fedco stores. It was built by Electro-Voice but shipped with a Soundcraftsmen brand faceplate; no national distribution was sought for this product.|$|E
50|$|Through {{at least}} the 1980s, the phono input was widely {{available}} on consumer stereo equipment—even some larger boomboxes had them. By the 2000s only very sophisticated and expensive <b>stereo</b> <b>receivers</b> retained the phono input, since most users were expected to use digital music formats such as CD or satellite radio. Some newer low-cost turntables include built-in amplifiers to produce line-level (one volt) outputs; devices are available that perform this conversion for use with computers; or older amplifiers or radio receivers can be used. Nearly all DJ mixers have two or more phono inputs, together with two or more one-volt line inputs that also use RCA connectors.|$|R
50|$|The company {{used the}} National brand outside of North America from the 1950s to the 1970s (the {{trademark}} {{could not be}} used in the United States because it was already in use by the National Radio Company in a closely related product area). It sold televisions, VHS VCRs, high fidelity <b>stereo</b> <b>receivers,</b> multi-band shortwave radios and marine radio direction finders, often exported to North America under various U.S. brand names, such as Technics, Emerson, Curtis Mathes and of course Panasonic. The company also developed a line of home appliances such as rice cookers for the Japanese and Asian markets. Rapid growth resulted in the company opening manufacturing plants around the world.|$|R
50|$|Because of {{the limited}} audio quality of the {{majority}} of AM receivers, and also because AM <b>stereo</b> <b>receivers</b> are relatively scarce, relatively few AM stations employ stereo. Various modulation schemes are used for AM stereo, of which the best-known is Motorola's C-QUAM, the official method for most countries in the world that transmit in AM stereo. More AM stations are adopting digital HD Radio, which allows the transmission of stereo sound on AM stations. For Digital Audio Broadcasting, MP2 audio streams are used. DAB is one of the Digital Radio formats that is used to broadcast Digital Audio over terrestrial broadcast networks or satellite networks. DAB is extended to video, and the new format is called DMB.|$|R
