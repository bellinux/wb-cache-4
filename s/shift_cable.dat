50|$|Before the 1990s many {{manufacturers}} made derailleurs, including Simplex, Huret, Galli, Mavic, Gipiemme, Zeus, Suntour, and Shimano. However, {{the successful}} introduction {{and promotion of}} indexed shifting by Shimano in 1985 required a compatible system of shift levers, derailleur, sprockets, chainrings, chain, <b>shift</b> <b>cable,</b> and shift housing.|$|E
5000|$|The design, {{developed}} by Shimano, improves on their earlier Uniglide design (which used beveled gear teeth instead of ramps), and was introduced {{as part of}} a commercially viable index shifting system. The Hyperglide ramps, along with laterally floating derailleur jockey wheels, allows for enough [...] "slop" [...] in the system to make indexed shifting reliable, despite variations in <b>shift</b> <b>cable</b> adjustment and manufacturing or assembly tolerances. A Hyperglide freewheel or cassette on a bike with friction shifters can further improve shifting.|$|E

50|$|Most hub gears are {{operated}} {{in a similar}} manner, with a single twist, trigger or thumb-shifter. An exception is the older style of Sturmey-Archer 5-speed, which used a second <b>shift</b> <b>cable</b> to change between close and wide-range sun gears, effectively giving two 3-speed hubs in one unit. The middle gear in both ranges was direct drive, so there were five distinct gears. They could either be controlled with a special 5-speed shifter which operated both cables, or with a regular 3-speed shifter and a friction shifter.|$|E
5000|$|The linear {{movement}} of the inner cable is most often used to transmit a pulling force, although push/pull cables have gained popularity in recent years e.g. as gear <b>shift</b> <b>cables.</b> Many light aircraft use a push/pull bowden cable for the throttle control, {{and here it is}} normal for the inner element to be solid wire, rather than a multi-strand cable. Usually provision is made for adjusting the cable tension using an inline hollow bolt (often called a [...] "barrel adjuster"), which lengthens or shortens the cable housing relative to a fixed anchor point. Lengthening the housing (turning the barrel adjuster out) tightens the cable; shortening the housing (turning the barrel adjuster in) loosens the cable.|$|R

50|$|NBC play-by-play man Bob Costas {{believed}} that a large bulk {{of the regular season}} coverage beginning in the 1990s <b>shifted</b> to <b>cable</b> (namely, ESPN) because CBS, the network that was taking over from NBC the television rights beginning in 1990, didn't really want the Saturday Game of the Week.

The move came {{as part of a}} shift by broadcast television networks towards using their Saturday morning lineup solely to comply with the educational programming requirements mandated by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), along with the cultural <b>shift</b> towards <b>cable</b> and online video on demand viewing of children's and animated programming. Vortexx aired for the final time on September 27, 2014; it was the last Saturday morning block across the major American broadcast television networks that primarily featured non-educational programming aimed at children, until Sinclair Broadcast Group launches its children's programming block, KidsClick on July 1, 2017.|$|R

5000|$|The Shimano {{compatible}} {{family of}} derailleurs is stated {{as having a}} shift ratio of two-to-one (2:1), and since SRAM makes two families of components, the term has been widely adopted to distinguish it from SRAM's own one-to-one (1:1) ratio family of derailleurs. Notice that these family names do not give the exact shift ratios: the 2:1 shift ratio is in fact about 1.7 (Or 1.9 on the Dura Ace series up to 7400) rather than 2, and the native SRAM shift ratio is about 1.1. The family names of these standards are reversed by some in actuation ratio notation as opposed {{to that of the}} more common shift ratio. Thus, in Shimano systems a unit of <b>cable</b> <b>shifted</b> causes about twice as much movement of the derailleur.|$|R
50|$|For a time, CHCH {{broadcast}} local mid-week telecasts of NHL {{games from}} the Toronto Maple Leafs, and co-produced Buffalo Sabres games with Adelphia Cable and the Sabres' owners.

The station later reproduced World Wrestling Federation programs for Canadian audiences before the company's focus <b>shifted</b> entirely to <b>cable</b> television. For a number of years, CHCH also broadcast Sunday afternoon coverage of regular season games from the NFL's Buffalo Bills because CTV (and later, the Global Television Network) had to choose the Detroit Lions for its Ontario stations {{as part of that}} network's NFL coverage (the Bills are now seen primarily on Sportsnet Ontario; the Lions have returned to CTV).

40|$|The SPEAR 3 {{synchrotron}} lightsource at SLAC {{relies on}} a sophisticated radio frequency (RF) timing system to maintain current – electrons – in the storage ring. One problem SPEAR 3 operators have dealt with is the thermal expansion {{of one of the}} cables supporting this RF timing system. As the cable expands and contracts with the diurnal {{rise and fall of the}} sun, the phase of the RF in the <b>cable</b> <b>shifts.</b> This shifting phase affects the timing accuracy of electron injections into the storage ring. A common feedback control algorithm PID (Proportional Integral Derivative) has countless applications in engineering. PID feedback can solve this problem of diurnal phase shift nicely. In general, feedback control of a dynamic variable requires the completion of a feedback loop; the variable is fed as input to the controller, which in turn modifies the variable. These principles were used to write a software program that controls a phase modulation box to compensate for the thermal expansion of the RF timing cable. The software was written and compiled with MATLAB, and interfaces with the EPICS control system at SLAC to control the hardware. The system also provides diagnostic tools and software control of the phase in this part of the timing system...|$|R
40|$|Traditionally, extra {{high voltage}} (EHV) {{transmission}} systems consist exclusively of overhead lines (OHL) {{but in the}} recent years the utilization of high voltage AC (HVAC) power cables is increasing due to environmental, political and operational aspects. To study the impact of HVAC power cables on temporary overvoltages and slow front transients, a simulation model of the large-scale network is required. Guidelines concerning the modeling detail for the surrounding network need to be established to ensure sufficient accurate results. Existing guidelines for purely OHL transmission networks may not be adequate since the integration of HVAC power <b>cables</b> <b>shift</b> the harmonic impedance of the network to lower frequencies and that can affect the extent of the needed simulation model. Much effort can be saved from obtaining detailed data for an extensive but proper model, but a less detailed model might not describe the network behavior with sufficient accuracy. In this study, simplification options are considered, for which the time to construct and analyze a simulation model can be reduced. The simplification options are compared with the reference model (full detail), and judged based on three indicators for the level of accuracy: frequency and amplitude of the main resonance, and maximum over-voltage. As a result, guidelines on the extent of the simulated network and in which detail the model has to be built are proposed. The inverse approach, i. e. increasing level of detail until simulation results hardly change leads to similar results, but requires equivalent short-circuit networks {{for the rest of the}} grid. The method is tested for the Dutch 380 kV grid where an underground cable connection of 10. 8 km length is introduced in 2013 and a second connection is planned for 2017...|$|R
40|$|The sPHENIX {{detector}} at RHIC {{will contain}} an electromagnetic and a hadronic calorimeter {{used for the}} detection of particles in jets from heavy ion collisions. The hadronic calorimeter will be composed of layers of steel plates that are alternated with plastic scintillators. Within the scintillator panels, wavelength <b>shifting</b> fiber optic <b>cables</b> are embedded and coupled to silicon photo multipliers (SiPMs). The signal from the SiPMs pass through a preamp that shapes and amplifies the signal before passing it to an analog to digital converter (ADC) from which the energy deposited in the scintillator is determined. The scintillator panels are manufactured with a diffusive coating to improve reflection and increase sensitivity. With the test setup at the University of Colorado at Boulder, I explored the correlation between light uniformity and fiber geometry, fiber cladding, and diffusive coating density. Many measurements made in Heavy Ion experiments such as PHENIX at RHIC rely on knowledge of the geometrical configuration of the colliding nuclei to describe the evolution of collisions and gain insight into the quark-gluon plasma and the strong nuclear force. As part of this investigation, PHENIX has taken data in 2016 for deuteron on gold collisions at several energies. An acceptable collision frequency is achieved by injecting up to 120 separate bunches each with billions of ions into the storage ring, from which two, separate beams are made to collide. This method has a drawback as there is a chance for multiple pairs of nuclei to collide in a single bunch crossing. Data taken in a double event can not be separated into two independent events and has no clear interpretation. I develop an algorithm to flag multiple interaction events by examining the time dependence of data from the two Beam-Beam Counters – detectors surrounding the beam pipe on opposite ends of the interaction region. The algorithm is tested with data, in which events with double interactions are artificially produced...|$|R
5000|$|On 17 June 2015, Romania {{turned off}} analog {{broadcasting}}, and started broadcasting with DVB-T2 technology, but with very low coverage, {{and a very}} reduced number of broadcasts available. Because of low coverage, Romania will still broadcast TVR1 in analog format on VHF until 31 December 2015. DVB-T continues to be available for an undetermined period of time, only in Sibiu ( [...] Ch 47 and Ch 54) and Bucharest ( [...] Ch 54 and Ch 59). However, since the analogue turn-off, many people who were receiving TV on terrestrial <b>shifted</b> to a <b>cable</b> or DTH operator [...] To the present day, DVB-T and DVB-T2 are still in experimental broadcast. The delay of DVB-T launching is criticized by some people in Romania, {{as a form of}} sustaining the interest of cable and DTH providers, by delaying the stable launch of DVB-T and decreasing the number of channels ( [...] once, there were available 18 channels in DVB-T, even 3 in HD) but to the present day the number has fallen to only 6, and continues to be lower, especially since TVR announced that they will reduce the number of channels (TVR news will be shut down, probably because of low audience, the same for TVR 3, and the fate of TVR HD, {{which is one of the}} channels with the highes audience in TVR Group after TVR1, is unknown). Kanal D left terrestrial platform on 2 July 2015, and, Antena 3 is the only channel except TVR's available on terrestrial in DVB-T. It is unknown whether Antena 3 will remain available on DVB-T, will shift to DVB-T2, or fully leave the terrestrial platform [...] Antena Group channels were once available both analogue and digital in terrestrial. Also, many people in Romania are somehow surprised by the fact that Romania had regressed in terrestrial broadcasts, because in analogue there were, once, about 8 channels ( [...] in Bucharest), and decreasing to only 6 channels in Digital terrestrial is a regress. However, terrestrial TV was heavily surpassed both by DTH, or Cable, some people are even watching foreign FTA on satellite, because foreign broadcasts are having a more interesting content than Romanian channels. To the present day, DVB-T and T2 are still in tests. Although many TV sellers are marking DVB-T2 capable sets as being compatible with digital terrestrial television in Romania, by highlighting this feature with a sticker on the TV, buyers are mainly interested if the TV has digital cable tunner or digital satellite tuner, however TV sets without DVB-T2 continue to be sold with only DVB-T/C and sometimes S2, as cable and satellite compatibility presents most of interest.|$|R
