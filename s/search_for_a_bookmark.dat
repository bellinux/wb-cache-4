40|$|AbstractVisual <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{moving target}} among {{stationary}} distractors {{is more efficient}} than <b>searching</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> stationary target among moving distractors, and <b>searching</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> fast target among slow distractors is more efficient than vice versa. This indicates that the ease of <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> target with a particular motion is not determined simply by the difference between target and distractor velocities. We suggest <b>a</b> simple model <b>for</b> predicting ease of <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> unique motion, based upon a quantitative measure of target saliency. Essentially, search will be easier the more the target motion deviates from the general pattern of velocities in the scene. Our model predicts a number of well-known motion search phenomena, and suggests that one control for target saliency as well as target discriminability when drawing conclusions about visual system mechanisms from search experiments...|$|R
