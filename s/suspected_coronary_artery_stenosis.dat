40|$|Background/Aims: Obstructive {{sleep apnea}} hypoxia {{syndrome}} (OSAHS) {{is an independent}} risk factor for coronary artery disease (CAD). Treatment of OSAHS improves clinical outcome in some CAD patients, but the relationship between OSAHS and CAD is complex. Microparticles (MPs) are shed by the plasma membrane by either physiologic or pathologic stimulation. In the current study, we investigated the role of MPs {{in the context of}} OSAHS. Methods and Results: 54 patients with both <b>suspected</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>stenosis</b> and OSAHS were recruited and underwent both coronary arteriography and polysomnography. Circulating MPs were isolated and analyzed by flow cytometry. CAD+OSAHS patients exhibited greater levels of total MPs (Annexin V+), erythrocyte-derived MPs (CD 235 + Annexin V+), platelet-derived MPs (CD 41 + Annexin V+), and leukocyte-derived MPs (CD 45 + Annexin V+) compared to CAD alone patients or control. CAD+OSAHS patients expressed the greatest level of endothelial-derived MPs of all cellular origin types (CD 144 + Annexin V +). Treatment of human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) with MPs isolated from CAD+OSAHS patients markedly increased HAEC permeability (as detected by FITC-dextran), and significantly upregulated mRNA levels of ICAM- 1, VCAM- 1, and MCP- 1. Conclusion: OSAHS+CAD patients harbor increased levels of MPs, particularly the endothelial cell-derived subtype. When administered to HAECs, OSAHS+CAD patients MPs increase endothelial cell permeability and dysfunction...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: N- 13 ammonia uptake and {{retention}} in the myocardium {{is related to}} perfusion and metabolism. There are several potential advantages of N- 13 ammonia positron emission tomography (PET) to detect myocardial ischemia, such as higher spatial resolution, greater counting efficiencies, and robust attenuation correction. But there are few reports comparing Tc- 99 m myocardial perfusion single photon emission tomography (MPS) and N- 13 ammonia PET. We thus compared adenosine stress N- 13 ammonia PET/CT and Tc- 99 m sestamibi MPS in patients with <b>suspected</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>stenosis.</b> Materials and Methods: Seventeen patients (male 13 : 63 ± 11 years old) underwent adenosine stress N- 13 ammonia PET/CT (Discovery ST, GE), Tc- 99 m sestamibi MPS (dual head gamma camera, Hawkeye, GE) and coronary angiography within 1 week. N- 13 ammonia PET/CT and Tc- 99 m sestamibi MPS images were assessed with a 20 -segment model by visual interpretation and quantitative analysis using automatic quantitative software (Myovation, GE). Results: Both sensitivities and specificities of detecting an individual coronary artery stenosis were higher for N- 13 ammonia PET/CT than Tc- 99 m sestamibi MPS (PET/CT: 91 % / 89 % vs MPS: 65 % / 82 %). N- 13 ammonia PET/CT showed reversibility in 52 % of segments that were considered non-reversibile by Tc- 99 m sestamibi MPS.

40|$|Abstract Background Inflammation {{plays an}} {{important}} role in coronary artery disease from the initiation of endothelial dysfunction to plaque formation to final rupture of the plaque. In this study, we investigated the potential pathophysiological and clinical relevance of novel cytokines secreted from various cells including adipocytes, endothelial cells, and inflammatory cells, in predicting coronary artery disease (CAD) in asymptomatic subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Methods We enrolled a total of 70 asymptomatic type 2 diabetic patients without a documented history of cardiovascular disease, and determined serum levels of chemerin, omentin- 1, YKL- 40, and sCD 26. We performed coronary computed tomographic angiography (cCTA) in all subjects, and defined coronary artery stenosis[*]≥[*] 50 [*]% as significant CAD in this study. Results Subjects were classified into two groups: patients with <b>suspected</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>stenosis</b> on cCTA (group I, n[*]=[*] 41) and patients without any evidence of stenosis on cCTA (group II, n[*]=[*] 29). Group I showed significantly higher YLK- 40 levels and lower HDL-C levels than group II (p[*]=[*] 0. 038, 0. 036, respectively). Levels of chemerin, omentin- 1, and sCD 26 were not significantly different between the two groups. Serum YKL- 40 levels were positively correlated with systolic/diastolic BP, fasting/postprandial triglyceride levels, and Framingham risk score. Furthermore, YKL- 40 levels showed moderate correlation with the degree of coronary artery stenosis and the coronary artery calcium score determined from cCTA. In multivariate logistic analysis, after adjusting for age, gender, smoking history, hypertension, and LDL-cholesterol, YLK- 40 levels showed only borderline significance. Conclusions YKL- 40, which is secreted primarily from inflammatory cells, was associated with several CVD risk factors and was elevated in type 2 diabetic patients with suspected coronary artery stensosis on cCTA. These results suggest the possibility that the inflammatory biomarker YKL- 40 might be associated with coronary artery disease in asymptomatic patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. </p...|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to assess whether {{epicardial}} and paracardial adipose tissue volumes, as determined by computed tomography (CT), correlate with <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>stenosis</b> as determined by autopsy. The postmortem CT data and autopsy findings of 116 adult human decedents were retrospectively compared. Subjects were classified into three groups according to their degree of <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> stenosis: ≥ 50, < 50 %, and no stenosis. Epicardial and paracardial adipose tissue volumes were calculated based on manual segmentation after threshold based masking. In addition, epicardial adipose tissue thickness was measured using a caliper. All three parameters (thickness of epicardial fat and volumes of both epicardial and paracardial fat) were compared among the three groups and correlated with the degree of <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>stenosis.</b> The group with no <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>stenosis</b> showed the lowest mean values of epicardial adipose tissue volume, while the <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>stenosis</b> ≥ 50 % group showed the highest volume.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{compare the}} {{accuracy}} of dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) and simultaneous 99 mTc sestamibi (MIBI) single-photon emission CT (SPECT) imaging for the diagnosis of <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>stenosis</b> in women. PATIENTS: Seventy women with limited exercise capacity referred for evaluation of myocardial ischemia. METHODS: DSE (up to 40 microg/kg/min) was performed in conjunction with stress MIBI SPECT. Resting MIBI images were acquired 24 h after the stress test. Ischemia was defined as new or worsened wall motion abnormalities confirmed by DSE and as reversible perfusion defects confirmed by MIBI. Significant <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> disease was defined as > or = 50 % luminal diameter stenosis. RESULTS: DSE was positive for ischemia in 35 of 45 patients with <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>stenosis</b> and in 2 of 25 patients without <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>stenosis</b> (sensitivity = 78 % CI, 68 to 88; specificity = 92 % CI, 85 to 99; and accuracy = 83 % CI, 74 to 92). A positive MIBI study for ischemia occurred in 29 patients with <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>stenosis</b> and in 7 patients without <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>stenosis</b> (sensitivity = 64 % CI, 53 to 76; specificity = 72 % CI, 61 to 83; and accuracy = 67 % CI, 56 to 78 [p < 0. 05 vs DSE]). In the 59 vascular regions with <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>stenosis,</b> the regional sensitivity of DSE was higher than MIBI (69 % CI, 62 to 77 vs 51 % CI, 42 to 59, p < 0. 05), whereas specificity in the 81 vascular regions without significant stenosis was similar (89 % CI, 84 to 94 vs 88 % CI, 82 to 93, respectively).

MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 748 consecutive patients with suspected CAD, referred for coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA), were enrolled. The mean CACS was compared between patients with different severities of <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>stenosis.</b> The association between CACS and different CAD risk factors was determined as well. Different cutoff points of CACS for discriminating between different levels of <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>stenosis</b> was determined using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. RESULTS: The mean CACS was significantly different between different levels of <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>stenosis</b> (P< 0. 001) and there was a significant positive association between the severity of CAD and CACS (P< 0. 001,r= 0. 781).

The objective of the study is to investigate if breathing maneuvers can non-invasively detect inducible ischemia in an experimental animal model when the myocardium is imaged with oxygenation-sensitive cardiovascular magnetic resonance (OS-CMR). In 11 anesthetised swine with experimentally induced significant stenosis (fractional flow reserve < 0. 75) of the left anterior descending <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> (LAD) and 9 control animals, OS-CMR at 3 T was performed during two different breathing maneuvers, a long breath-hold; and a combined maneuver of 60 s of hyperventilation followed by a long breath-hold. The resulting change of myocardial oxygenation was compared to the invasive measurements of coronary blood flow, blood gases, and oxygen extraction. In control animals, all breathing maneuvers could significantly alter coronary blood flow as hyperventilation decreased coronary blood flow by 34 ± 23 %. A long breath-hold alone led to an increase of 97 ± 88 %, while the increase was 346 ± 327 % (p< 0. 001), when the long breath-hold was performed after hyperventilation. In stenosis animals, the coronary blood flow response was attenuated after both hyperventilation and the following breath-hold. This was matched by the observed oxygenation response as breath-holds following hyperventilation consistently yielded {{a significant difference in the}} signal of the MRI images between the perfusion territory of the stenosis LAD and remote myocardium. There was no difference between the coronary territories during the other breathing maneuvers or in the control group at any point. In an experimental animal model, the response to a combined breathing maneuver of hyperventilation with subsequent breath-holding is blunted in myocardium subject to significant <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>stenosis.</b> This maneuver may allow for detecting severe <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>stenosis</b> and have a significant clinical potential as a non-pharmacological method for diagnostic testing in patients with <b>suspected</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> disease...|$|R

Methods The study included 100 type 2 diabetic subjects (51 male and 49 female; mean age: 56 ± 7 years). Silent myocardial ischemia, as determined by CMR, was defined as evidence of inducible ischemia or myocardial infarction. Signal reduction or stenosis of ≥ 50 % in the vessel diameter {{was used as the}} criteria for significant <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>stenosis</b> on <b>coronary</b> magnetic resonance (MR) angiography. Results EAT thickness was positively correlated with body mass index (BMI), waist-to-hip ratio, systolic blood pressure, postprandial glucose, fasting/postprandial triglyceride (TG), serum glycated hemoglobin (HbA 1 c) level, and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) score. Significant <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>stenosis</b> was found in 24 patients, while 14 patients had silent myocardial ischemia in CMR (1 with silent myocardial infarction, 11 with inducible ischemia, and 2 with both). EAT thickness was greater in patients who had <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>stenosis</b> (13. 0 ± 2. 6 mm vs. 11. 5 ± 2. 1 mm, p = 0. 01), but did not differ between the subjects with or without silent myocardial ischemia on CMR images (12. 8 ± 2. 1 vs. 11. 7 ± 2. 3 mm, p = 0. 11).

40|$|Cardiovascular disease due to {{atherosclerosis}} is {{the leading}} cause of morbidity and mortality in the developed world. Atherosclerosis is a complex multifocal arterial disease which involves the interactions of multiple genetic and environmental factors. Advances in techniques of molecular genetics have revealed that genetic polymorphisms significantly influence susceptibility to atherosclerotic vascular diseases. In this project we studied the association of a few pre-selected genetic polymorphisms of CCL 2 and FCER 1 A with coronary atherosclerosis. The protein coded by CCL 2, monocyte chemoattractant protein- 1 (MCP- 1) is important in the initiation of atherosclerosis and crucial in monocyte recruitment into the subendothelial lesions. Since there are conflicting reports on the possible association of the CCL 2 rs 1024611 polymorphism with <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> disease, we investigated the role of this polymorphism. FCER 1 A influences several inflammatory biomarker levels, including MCP- 1 concentrations and may have apotential role in development of cardiovascular disease. The polymorphisms rs 2427827 and rs 2251746 related to this gene were studied. This study was conducted on a group of 234 persons who had <b>suspected</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> disease. On <b>coronary</b> angiography, 131 individuals were found to have significant coronary arterystenosis, and the remaining 103 individuals had normal <b>coronary</b> <b>arteries</b> or insignificant <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>stenosis.</b> The CCL 2 rs 1024611 polymorphism and FCER 1 A rs 2427827 and rs 2251746 polymorphisms were genotyped using the polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method. For the CCL 2 rs 1024611 polymorphism, there were significant differences between genotype frequencies in the patients with and without significant <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>stenosis</b> (p= 0. 008). For the FCER 1 A rs 2427827 (p= 0. 31) and rs 2251746 (p= 0. 63) polymorphisms we found no significant differences between the two groups. Our data, from the present study, demonstrate that the CCL 2 rs 1024611 polymorphism is associated with <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>stenosis,</b> whereas the FCER 1 A rs 2427827 and rs 2251746 polymorphisms are not. These findings need to be confirmed in future larger studies, especially in the case of rs 1024611, before its usefulness as a marker of risk of the development of atherosclerosis can be advocated. </p...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE To {{determine}} whether myocardial contrast echocardiography {{can be used}} to quantify collateral derived myocardial flow in humans. METHODS In 25 patients undergoing coronary angioplasty, a collateral flow index (CFI) was determined using intracoronary wedge pressure distal to the stenosis to be dilated, with simultaneous mean aortic pressure measurements. During balloon occlusion, echo contrast was injected into both main <b>coronary</b> <b>arteries</b> simultaneously. Echocardiography of the collateral receiving myocardial area was performed. The time course of myocardial contrast enhancement in images acquired at end diastole was quantified by measuring pixel intensities (256 grey units) within a region of interest. Perfusion variables, such as background subtracted peak pixel intensity and contrast transit rate, were obtained from a fitted gamma variate curve. RESULTS 16 patients had a left anterior descending <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>stenosis,</b> four had a left circumflex <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>stenosis,</b> and five had a right <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>stenosis.</b> The mean (SD) CFI was 19 (12) ...|$|R
40|$|SummaryBackgroundPost-ischemic {{myocardial}} diastolic stunning persists for a {{long time}} after transient ischemia even after systolic function has recovered. We sought to identify <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>stenosis</b> in clinical patients using strain imaging diastolic index (SI-DI) at rest. MethodsWe retrospectively examined 85 patients with <b>suspected</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> disease and preserved ejection fraction (EF; > 50 %) who underwent both echocardiography and coronary angiography. Speckle tracking strains were measured in 3 apical views and parasternal left ventricular (LV) short-axis views at the papillary muscle level. LV segments with inadequate image quality and deficit segments in the movie were excluded by the blinded observer. After strain analysis, LV segments were classified into no stenosis (≤ 50 %), mild stenosis (51 – 75 %), and severe stenosis (> 75 %) groups on the bases of the coronary angiogram. ResultsSI-DI decreased significantly in severe stenosis segments (p< 0. 05, ANOVA), but none of the peak strains showed significant difference. The area under the curve for predicting severe stenosis in radial, longitudinal, and transverse SI-DI was 0. 72, 0. 74, and 0. 80, respectively. A cut-off value of 49 for transverse SI-DI can predict LV segments with severe stenosis with sensitivity of 0. 79 and specificity of 0. 73. A screening cut-off value of 63 for transverse SI-DI shows sensitivity of 0. 95 and specificity of 0. 50. ConclusionSI-DI at rest is a novel marker in predicting coronary stenosis even in patients with preserved EF. This index can be used to screen patients with <b>suspected</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> disease in routine echocardiography and does not require stress provocation...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAimsPatients with {{diabetes}} mellitus (DM) {{are likely to}} develop asymptomatic myocardial infarction as a complication. However, <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> lesions are difficult to assess in internal medicine. This study aimed to develop a prediction formula for <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>stenosis,</b> as determined by coronary computed tomographic angiography (CCTA), by analyzing risk factors in patients with type 2 DM. MethodsA prediction formula was developed based on a multivariate analysis of common factors in patients with ⩾ 50 % <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>stenosis</b> in a cohort of 327 patients with type 2 DM who underwent CCTA between 2007 and 2009, and cutoff values were calculated (derivation study). The validity of the optimal cutoff value was confirmed in a separate cohort of 317 patients with type 2 DM who underwent CCTA between 2010 and 2011 (validation study). ResultsIn the derivation study, five predictive factors (presence/absence of hypertension, estimated glomerular filtration rate, maximum intima-media thickness [max-IMT], ankle-brachial index [ABI], and use/nonuse of diabetic medication) were used to develop a prediction formula. In the validation study, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of the cutoff value derived from the prediction formula were 53 % and 73 %, respectively. ConclusionsWe developed a novel formula to predict <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>stenosis</b> using five predictive factors. This formula is useful for determining whether computed tomography (CT) examination is necessary, even in clinical settings without CCTA equipment. Early detection of <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>stenosis</b> in patients with DM may also lead to better health outcomes...|$|R

Here we report a case of Behçet's disease with several cardiovascular complications, namely: pericarditis, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), TTP, <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>stenosis,</b> and a <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> pseudo aneurysm. A 37 -year-old female presented with sudden dyspnea and syncope at our emergency room and underwent pericardiectomy and pericardial window formation for the diagnosis of cardiac tamponade with acute hemorrhagic pericarditis. Thereafter, TTP and DVT complicated her illness. After confirmation of Behçet's disease {{on the basis of}} a history of recurrent oral and genital ulcers and erythema nodosum, remission was achieved after treatment with methylprednisolone pulse therapy, colchicine, catheter directed thrombolysis and thrombectomy. However, whilst maintaining anticoagulation therapy, a newly developed pericardial aneurysmal dilatation was noted on follow-up radiologic evaluation. Further evaluation revealed right <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>stenosis</b> and a left <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> pseudo aneurysm; these additional problems were treated with the nonsurgical insertion of an endovascular graft stent.

Sixteen-slice MSCT showed promising diagnostic accuracy in detecting <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> stenoses haemodynamically {{and the subsequent}} introduction of 64 -slice scanners promised excellent and fast results for <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> studies. This prompted us to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and the negative und positive predictive value of 64 -slice MSCT in the detection of haemodynamically significant <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> stenoses. Thirty-seven consecutive subjects with <b>suspected</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> disease were evaluated with MSCT angiography and the results compared with QCA. All vessels were considered {{for the assessment of}} significant <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>stenosis</b> (diameter reduction ≥ 50 %). Thirteen patients (35 %) were identified as having significant <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> stenoses on QCA with 6. 3 % (35 / 555) affected segments. None of the coronary segments were excluded from analysis. Overall sensitivity for classifying stenoses of 64 -slice MSCT was 69 %, specificity was 92 %, positive predictive value was 38 % and negative predictive value was 98 %. The interobserver variability for detection of significant lesions had a ĸ-value of 0. 43.

Methods: IR-SSFP was scanned on a 1. 5 -T MR scanner with a five element cardiac coil. One hundred and twenty-one subjects with known or <b>suspected</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> disease who had undergone X-ray coronary angiography (XCA) underwent <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> wall imaging using IR-SSFP sequences. In each coronary segment, the detection of the coronary wall was categorized, and contrast (signal of plaque minus signal of blood in the aorta divided by the signal of plaque plus signal of blood in the aorta) was calculated. Results: 422 of 517 segments (82 %) were successfully visualized, and the detection scores tended to be higher at the proximal <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> when compared with other segments of the <b>coronary</b> <b>artery.</b> High contrast (contrast ≥ 0. 75) areas were observed in 62 of 218 segments with ≥ 50 % <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>stenosis</b> by XCA but also in 25 of 299 segments without ≥ 50 % coronary stenosis.
