60|$|NETTIE HARDING {{had spent}} at least six weeks at Low Wood when she sat one {{afternoon}} on the lawn, gazing before her reflectively, with a book turned upside‐down upon her knee. She had at one time wondered why she lingered there, though she found the company of Hester Earle congenial, and Hester’s father had pressed her to extend her visit, while other reasons that appeared more or less convincing had not been wanting. The Northrop valley was very pretty, and the quiet, well‐ordered life her English friends led pleasant, as a change from the turmoil of commercial enterprise and the fierce activity of the <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>pleasure</b> she had been accustomed to in America. The tranquillity of the green, peaceful country appealed to her, and she found interesting the quietly spoken {{men and women who}} so decorously directed what was done in it, partly because the type was new to her.|$|E

Fortitude is a cardinal virtue and the fort signifies security in life that we find in the cross, our victory over difficulties. The wreath of laurels signifies St. Michael's conquest over all evil.

5000|$|The {{practice}} of mortification, {{a way of}} following Christ's advice to his disciples to [...] "renounce yourself, take up your cross, and follow me" [...] is also usually attacked as sado-masochism, a <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>pleasure</b> through pain. Catholics believe, on the other hand, that it is through suffering and pain that Christians [...] "complete in themselves the afflictions of Christ" [...] as St. Paul preached. This means Christians see themselves as forming the [...] "one mystical person" [...] with Christ, and therefore should help people by loving and obeying God by undergoing pains and sufferings, thus making up {{for the sins of}} men.|$|E

5000|$|Renaissance {{literature}} {{refers to}} European literature which {{was influenced by}} the intellectual and cultural tendencies associated with the Renaissance. The literature of the Renaissance was written by within the general movement of the Renaissance which arose in 14th-century Italy and continued until the 16th century while being diffused into the western world. It is characterized by the adoption of a humanist philosophy and the recovery of the classical Antiquity. It benefited from the spread of printing {{in the latter part of}} the 15th century. For the writers of the Renaissance, Greco-Roman inspiration was shown both in the themes of their writing and in the literary forms they used. The world was considered from an anthropocentric perspective. Platonic ideas were revived and put to the service of Christianity. The <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>pleasures</b> of the senses and a critical and rational spirit completed the ideological panorama of the period. New literary genres such as the essay (Montaigne) and new metrical forms such as the Spenserian stanza made their appearance.|$|R
50|$|The Melnibonéans are a {{humanoid}} race, {{but their}} psychological distance from humans is stressed throughout the series. With {{the exception of}} Elric, they lack a moral sense. Their actions are determined by tradition and by the <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>pleasure</b> and new sensations. Meerclar, Mistress of Catkind, compares the Imrryrian nature {{to the nature of}} her own kind in their sophistication and their love of cruelty and pleasure. Torture of slaves and prisoners is a common amusement. The otherness of the Melnibonéans is manifest in their aesthetics. They naturally prefer a mix of colors and elaborate, baroque decoration and architecture. The tall spires of Imrryr are every color of the rainbow.|$|E
50|$|All such {{activities}} appeared to Freud {{to contradict the}} organism's <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>pleasure,</b> and therefore 'to justify the hypothesis of a compulsion to repeat—something that seems more primitive, more elementary, more instinctual than the pleasure principle which it over-rides': 'a daemonic current/trait', 'a daemonic character', a 'daemonic compulsion', likely alluding to the Latin motto errare humanum est, perseverare autem diabolicum ("to err is human, to persist committing errors longer available is of the devil"). Following this line of thought, {{he would come to}} stress that ' an instinct is an urge inherent in organic life to restore an earlier state of things '; and so to arrive eventually at his concept of the death drive.|$|E

Tassini, citing the History of Italy by Botta, describes him as keeping the palace as a debauched serraglio, governed by the Countess Calori. Muratori in his Annals describes the Duke as always venturing to carnival of Venice to procure the glory of besting all in the <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>pleasure.</b> Others said all night long his palace was the scene of theatrical representations by dissolute women, with music and banqueting, so that he had a worse name than Sardanapalus of old.|$|E
40|$|Social mammals {{engage in}} affiliative {{interactions}} both when seeking relief from negative affect and when <b>searching</b> <b>for</b> <b>pleasure</b> and joy. These two motivational states are both modulated by µ-opioid transmission. The µ-opioid receptor (MOR) {{system in the}} brain mediates pain relief and reward behaviours, and is implicated in social reward processing and affiliative bonding across mammalian species. However, pharmacological manipulation of the µ-opioid system has yielded opposite effects on rodents and primates: in rodents, social motivation is generally increased by MOR agonists and reduced by antagonists, whereas the opposite pattern {{has been shown in}} primates. Here, we address this paradox by taking into account differences in motivational state. We first review evidence for µ-opioid mediation of reward processing, emotion regulation, and affiliation in humans, non-human primates, rodents and other species. Based on the consistent cross-species similarities in opioid functioning, we propose a unified, state-dependent model for µ-opioid modulation of affiliation across the mammalian species. Finally, we show that this state-dependent model is supported by evidence from both rodent and primate studies, when species and age differences in social separation response are taken into account...|$|R

50|$|Ida was {{the sister}} of the gods, giving {{consciousness}} to the entire mankind. For this reason, there is an Ida Karma in the Yagnas. This erudition of Ida created a rift between Shraddha and Manu. Then with the progressive intelligence <b>searching</b> <b>for</b> unbridled <b>pleasures,</b> the impasse was inevitable. This story is so very ancient that metaphor has wonderfully mingled with history. Therefore Manu, Shraddha and Ida while maintaining their historical importance may also express the symbolic import. Manu represents the mind with its faculties {{of the head and}} heart and these are again symbolized as Faith (Shraddha) and Intelligence (Ida) respectively. On this data is based the story of Kamayani.|$|R

5000|$|The root of {{the evil}} {{according}} to Pius XII, is a terrible temptation to materialism. This {{is not confined to}} materialistic (Marxist) philosophy. It exists also as [...] "a love of money which creates ever greater havoc, as modern enterprises expand, which, unfortunately, determines many of the decisions which weigh heavy on the life of the people. It finds expression in the cult of the body, in excessive desire for comforts, a flight from all the austerities of life, an unrestrained <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>pleasure,</b> a concept of life which regulates everything exclusively in terms of material prosperity and earthly satisfactions".

5000|$|Mão Morta is a Portuguese avant-garde {{rock band}} that started its {{activities}} in 1985 in Braga. The group's name means [...] "dead hand", {{based on a}} traditional Portuguese nursery rhyme. They are {{generally considered to be}} one of the most important bands in the Portuguese rock scene and have since reached a cult status. Since the start of their career, their live concerts became famous for their intensity and dark mood, due to their signature alternative rock sound and the performance of vocalist Adolfo Luxúria Canibal (a pseudonym, meaning Adolph Cannibal Lust), known for occasional onstage theatrics and his gravelly voice, half-sung, half-spoken singing style. Mão Morta's music is quite difficult to categorize as they seem to incorporate a variety of genres; from punk rock, metal, to industrial and experimental. Their sound, combined with Adolfo's lyrics, reflects urban violence, a human <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>pleasure,</b> freedom and a critique of contemporary consumerist society, often with sarcastic humour.|$|E

40|$|Funded {{through the}} Triangle Arts Trust in 2004, artist Dora Longo Bahia and I {{were invited to}} reside in Johannesburg whilst {{creating}} a new body {{of work to be}} exhibited at The Bag Factory Gallery. Through Johannesburg Daily Archive we built a body of video-based research which depicted the city through overlapping reflections and narrations, appropriating devices from documentary film and archival installation to develop a history of a place as we experienced it. Working in conjunction with one another on all aspects of creating the work, we used our positions as outsiders in Johannesburg to develop research that reflected the daily routine of an urban centre undergoing massive developments both structurally and sociologically. Assuming various roles including those of performers, tourists, filmmakers and facilitators, we composed an archive of our role-playing experiences that combined a wallpaper installation of daily newspaper headlines with a series of videos shown simultaneously on different monitors. The work manifests as a confusion of sound, text and image, with only moments of uncalculated quiet occurring during the rare pauses in the video sound feed. Significantly, this body of work became a portrait of an urban environment still recovering from decades of civil strife and uncertainty. The research mirrored the experience of the (ubiquitous) city itself, and points to the evolving and chaotic state of many urban centres: cities that have become meeting places of disparate people <b>searching</b> <b>for</b> <b>pleasure,</b> experience, work or simply a place to call home. The work has since been exhibited in Videometry at Galeria del Angels Barcelona in 2006, at Film:Basel as part of Art:Basel 36 International Art Show in 2005, and featured in Video de viagem (Travelogue), that took place in Paço das Artes, São Paulo June 2007.

5000|$|Yalom {{holds that}} the search for meaning is {{paradoxical}} in a similar sense as Frankl sees the <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>pleasure</b> to be paradoxical: it cannot be achieved if aimed at directly and must rather be pursued indirectly ("obliquely"). He states that, if a patient reports a lack of meaning in life, {{it is important for}} the therapist to first learn whether there are possibly other underlying issues (cultural issues, or issues relating to the concerns of death, freedom, and isolation), and addressing such issues, for example by helping the patient develop curiosity and concern for others within the framework of group therapy. Regarding [...] "pure meaninglessness", Yalom states that the desire to engage life is [...] "always there within the patient"—to engage in satisfying relationships, in social or creative engagement, in satisfying work, in religious or self-transcendent strivings, and other forms of engagement. Therefore, Yalom's proposed therapeutic answer to [...] "pure" [...] meaninglessness is to remove obstacles that prevent the patient from wholehearted engagement. Yalom {{holds that the}} therapist's best tool for this is the therapist's own engagement with the patient.|$|E

Inspired by Walter Benjamin, among other researchers, the author presents the narrow connection between the urban projects of Western cities and the forms of sensibility and the construction of the feeling of alterity. The article, using current scenes of daily life, underscores the singular characteristics of the production of subjectivities through contemporary capitalism, such as the disposability of social relations, the <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>pleasure</b> that is never satiated, the indifference, and the singular individualism of present day cities that predominates in the profusion of images of consumption and velocity...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{was to investigate the}} existence of an allurement towards virtuality, especially, towards cyberspace. For this, using resources of the psychoanalytic theory about the function of images in subjectivity. The theoretical study about the function of the image {{in the formation of the}} subjective realm revealed that the allurement is related mainly to the structuring and identifying power of image. The multiplicity of images nowadays and the growing technological virtuality have promoted the expansion of the imaginary register of subjectivity, with all its effects: a loss of the symbolic dimension which is translated in terms of the <b>search</b> <b>for</b> instant <b>pleasure</b> and a lack of interest towards activities that require efforts or the postponement of satisfaction, easy solutions, the building up of less frustrating social connections and the illusion of having "everything". To the extreme, this utilization of the virtual space may be conducive to a position of estrangement towards the fascinating image, with the ensuing loss of insights and of thought criticism...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Originally {{grounded}} in library and information science, {{the majority of}} infor-mation behaviour and information seeking theories focus on task-based scenarios where users try to resolve information needs. While other theories exist, such as how people unexpectedly encounter information for example, they are typically related back to tasks, motivated by work or personal goals. This research, however, focuses on casual-leisure scenarios that are typically motivated by hedonistic needs rather than information needs, where people engage in <b>searching</b> behaviours <b>for</b> <b>pleasure</b> rather than find information. This book chapter describes two studies on: 1) television information behaviour and 2) the casual information behaviours described by users of Twitter. The first study focuses on a specific casual-leisure domain that is familiar to many, while the second indicates that our findings generalise to many other casual-leisure sce-narios. The results of these two studies are then used to define an initial model of casual-leisure information behaviour, which highlights the key differences between casual-leisure scenarios and typical information behaviour theory. The chapter concludes by discussing how this new model of casual-leisure information behaviour challenges the way we design information systems, mea-sure their value, and consequently evaluate their support for users. 1...|$|R

40|$|By {{means of}} notorious chameleonic and {{metamorphic}} abilities, capitalism modifies societies, through silent historical pathways, indelible processes and accurate objectives. Following its nature, capitalism appropriates the formerly autonomous realm of arts, until then {{ruled by the}} independence and specific rules of the artists, bearers of control instruments, and specific mechanisms of choice and selection. The primal incompatibility between the artistic field and capitalism move into a stage where societies are steadily transformed in the consecration of an ‘artsy’ world, present in multiple dimensions, from the fashion industry to architecture, cinema and shopping malls, uttered in tasteless and swift changes. The authors reflect {{on the existence of}} a society based on hybridity, a constant <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>pleasure,</b> seduction and novelty, enterprising an impoverished artistic economy, disconnected from the erudite culture which reaches its climax in the ‘hypermodern epoch’, being characterised by ‘trans-aesthetic capitalism’ globally. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E
40|$|Through {{the whole}} of Marivaux' s work, from novels to theatre, taking in the {{theories}} in his journalism, there runs a reflection on pleasure, despite his official opinions. But {{the analysis of the}} 'Epicurean' <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>pleasure</b> is linked to a conception of the primacy of the heart, inspired by Pascal and Malebranche, which is extended to a criticism of vanity and of moral and social masks. In his comedy La Dispute, pleasure plays {{a central role in the}} characters' psyches, as they give themselves up to discontinuous, fluent and obscure feelings. Finally, the undefined anxiety of inconstancy and elsewhere (motives inspired by St Augustine) take over from the Epicurean démystification of passions and govern all the sentimental 'deviations'.

40|$|Fragonard {{and comic}} pleasure. The comic in {{paintings}} is generally studied through only two genres, namely caricature and {{the representation of}} comic scenes based on a theatrical model; {{in both cases the}} purpose is to denounce moral deviance. Fragonard however proposes a conception of the comic which is based instead on the <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>pleasure</b> by both the figures and the spectator; he adopts three methods which correspond approximately to three successsive periods of his creative output. During his Italian period, laughter is above all caused by exposing the innocence of beings, and complicity is more important than condemnation. In the 1760 s, his comic is based on a question of the very principles of the art of painting, following a reflexive approach. In the 1770 s, Fragonard emphasizes the delicate balance between innocent happiness and tragic burlesque, which is more and more evident. Jollet Étienne. Le rire chez Fragonard.

40|$|On {{the basis}} of my field {{observations}} made {{in the context of}} the elaboration of my master's thesis, I want to discuss the notion of Gay Culture. This notion is part of the common knowledge of the investigators in the area, but it shows – in some of its meanings – important weaknesses concerning the recognition of the diversity of cultural expressions related to the <b>search</b> <b>for</b> sexual <b>pleasures</b> between men in the urban space. Speaking merely of Gay Culture to refer the caracteristics of the people converging in the places where we develop our fieldworks, would involve a metonymy. Thus, the status of culture is being conceded to the peculiarities of one sector of the people among we investigate: the one that gets closest to the public image of the gay-consumer to whom the extensive offer of gay or gay-friendly products is directed. In the field I have observed the coexistence of the conventional gays with a considerable number of individuals who, although they visit the same places, do not group together inside of them, or they do so in a frontal contra position to the values, practices and ways of speaking commonly recognized as gay or "of the milieu". I mean to develop my exposition based on these observations and the analysis of other works made at the margins of the circuits of homosexual socialization...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAcross the lifespan, {{eating is}} a common {{everyday}} act driven by the <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>pleasure</b> and reinforced by experienced pleasure. Pleasure is an innate indicator of the satisfaction of physiological needs, {{in addition to other}} attributes. Pleasure from eating is also learned and contributes to the development of children's eating habits, which remain mostly stable until adulthood. Based on classical models of determinants of food consumption behaviour, we identified three dimensions of pleasure from eating learned during childhood: 1 /the sensory dimension, i. e., pleasure from sensory sensations during food consumption; 2 /the interpersonal dimension, i. e., pleasure from the social context of food consumption; and 3 /the psychosocial dimension, i. e., pleasure from cognitive representations of food. The objective of this narrative review is to explore whether these three dimensions {{may play a role in}} promotion of healthy eating behaviour among children. Up to now, it was assumed that providing nutritional information, pointing out which types of foods are "good" or "bad" for health, would drive healthier food choices in children. Today, we know that such strategies based on a cognitive approach toward eating have a limited impact on healthy choices and can even be counter-productive, leading children to avoid healthy foods. In the context of increasing rates of childhood obesity, new perspectives are needed to build efficient interventions that might help children adopt a healthy diet. This review suggests new directions for further research to test the efficacy of novel interventions that emphasize pleasure from eating...|$|E
40|$|The {{main concern}} {{of this study}} is the artist’s vision of society; its major theme is the {{relation}} between the individual and society resulting from the impact of social and political upheavals on individual life. By criticism of society I mean the novelist’s awareness of the social reality and of the individual’s response to it; the writers I deal with all proved alive to the changes that were taking place in English society between the two World Wars. Though the social attitudes of the inter-war years as well as the writers’ response to them were shaped by lasting and complex influences, such as trends in philosophy and science, the two Wars stand out as determining factors {{in the development of the}} novel: the consequences of the First were explored by most writers in the Twenties, whereas in the following decade the novelists felt compelled to voice the anxiety aroused by the threat of another conflict and to warn against its possible effects. After the First World War many writers felt keenly the social disruption: the old standards, which were thought to have made this suicidal War possible, were distrusted; the code of behaviour and the moral values of the older generation were openly criticized for having led to bankruptcy. Disparagement of authority increased the individual’s sense of isolation, his insecurity, his disgust or fear. Even the <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>pleasure</b> so widely satirized in the Twenties was the expression of a cynicism born of despair. The ensuing disengagement of the individual from his environment became a major theme in the novel: his isolation was at once a cause for resentment and the source of his fierce individualism...|$|E
40|$|It is {{well known}} that Locke’s {{political}} theory with regard to the concepts of the law of nature, the state of nature and the transition from it to the commonwealth is at best highly problematic, if not inconsistent. Locke’s incoherence has often been related to the combination of different approaches; he accepted the traditional metaphysical doctrine of natural law (which he found restated in Richard Hooker’s Ecclesiastical Polity), but combined it with naturalistic ethics of Epicurean origin centred on the ideas of self-preservation and of the <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>pleasure</b> and avoidance of pain as the basic motivations of human behaviour. In my essay I examine the notion of natural law and try to show the inadequacy of this theory to account for the transition from the state of nature to political society. I focus particularly on theologico-political issues related to the transgression of natural law, which is conceived both as an ideal rational norm and as a natural, practical principle. Locke’s texts conceal a dilemma which he never discussed, but which undermines his political theory: either natural law’s obligation is effective, and in this case rational human agents should live in a self-regulating natural society without need of building the commonwealth and its repressive apparatus; or natural law {{is no more than a}} postulated set of ideal values, unable to regulate the dominant forces of human actions, and in this case it is difficult to understand how the positive laws of the commonwealth should respect its supposed prescriptions. I conclude my essay arguing that the shaky theological foundation of Locke’s political theory is not merely related to Locke’s inconsistencies, but reveals the deficiency of the traditional notion of natural law when faced with the elements of realism which Locke includes in his theory and which he shares with modern political thought...|$|E
