50|$|The European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) was {{proposed}} by Robert <b>Schuman</b> in his <b>declaration</b> on 9 May 1950 and involved the pooling {{of the coal}} and steel industries of France and West Germany. Half of the project states, Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands, had already achieved a great degree of integration amongst themselves with the organs of Benelux and earlier bilateral agreements. These five countries were joined by Italy and they all signed the Treaty of Paris on 23 July 1952. These six members, dubbed the 'inner six' (as opposed to the 'outer seven' who formed the European Free Trade Association who were suspicious of such plans for integration) went on to sign the Treaties of Rome establishing two further communities, together known as the European Communities when they merged their executives in 1967.|$|R

In March 1969, he opposed Britain's joining the European Economic Community. Opposition to entry had hitherto been confined largely to the Labour Party but now, he said, it was clear to him that the sovereignty of Parliament was in question, as was Britain's very survival as a nation. This nationalist analysis attracted millions of middle-class Conservatives and others, and {{as much as anything else}} it made Powell the implacable enemy of Heath, a fervent pro-European; but there was already enmity between the two.|$|E

The ECSC was designed to bring the markets of coal and steel, the materials needed to wage war, under the control of a supranational authority with the aim of encouraging peace and economic development. It established the first institutions. At its core was an independent executive called the [...] "High Authority" [...] with supranational powers over the Community. The laws made by the Authority would be observed by a Court of Justice in order to ensure they were upheld and to arbitrate.|$|E
40|$|Every {{political}} power has {{to deliver a}} legitimization discourse to give sense to the order its creates. This discourse may take various forms 1. The publications edited by the Commission {{for the general public}} in the eleven European official langages is one meaningful example. These documents presents the European Union to the citizens in the diversity of its sectoral policies as well as an original institutional system or as a global historical process started with the “ <b>déclaration</b> <b>Schuman</b> ”, May 9 th 1950. Through text and image, these booklets describ a political panorama assigning his place to every actor and emphazing the necessity of integration. The Commission poses as the spokesman for Europe, as the translator of the “ hidden truth ” 2 which justifies the failures of the daily practice. The problem is to know, by the way, if the institution, either assumes totally the political dimension linked to the communautarian stakes, or is leaded to develop a technocratic rhetoric because of its position and its functions in the EU. The editorial policy of the Commission has undoubtly a political dimension following the three criterions established in introduction of the collective reflection: first, it represents a public intervention, the booklets being defined as “ a multiplicated writing whose editio...|$|R

A separate Assembly was introduced during negotiations on the Treaty as an institution which would counterbalance and monitor the executive while providing democratic legitimacy. The wording of the ECSC Treaty demonstrated the leaders' desire for more than a normal consultative assembly by using the term [...] "representatives of the people" [...] and allowed for direct election. Its early importance was highlighted when the Assembly was given the task of drawing up the draft treaty to establish a European Political Community. By this document, the Ad Hoc Assembly was established on 13 September 1952 with extra members, but after the failure of the proposed European Defence Community the project was dropped.|$|E

5000|$|The Declaration {{said that}} the ECSC marked {{the birth of the}} Europe as a political, {{economic}} and social entity, reflecting the principles that Robert Schuman had announced in the <b>Schuman</b> <b>Declaration</b> of 1950. It included the statement: ...|$|E
50|$|On 9 May 1950, these {{principles}} of supranational democracy were announced {{in what has}} become known as the <b>Schuman</b> <b>Declaration.</b> The text was jointly prepared by Paul Reuter, the legal adviser at the Foreign Ministry, his chef-de Cabinet, Bernard Clappier and Jean Monnet and two of his team, Pierre Uri and Etienne Hirsch. The French Government agreed to the <b>Schuman</b> <b>Declaration</b> which invited the Germans and all other European countries to manage their coal and steel industries jointly and democratically in Europe's first supranational Community with its five foundational institutions. On 18 April 1951 six founder members signed the Treaty of Paris (1951) that formed the basis of the European Coal and Steel Community. They declared this date and the corresponding democratic, supranational principles to be the 'real foundation of Europe'. Three Communities have been created so far. The Treaties of Rome, 1957, created the Economic community and the nuclear non-proliferation Community, Euratom. Together with intergovernmental machinery of later treaties, these eventually evolved into the European Union. The <b>Schuman</b> <b>Declaration,</b> was made on 9 May 1950 and to this day 9 May is designated Europe Day.|$|E
5000|$|With {{statements}} such as Winston Churchill's 1946 call for a [...] "United States of Europe" [...] becoming louder, the Council of Europe was established in 1949 as the first pan-European organisation. In the year following, on 9 May 1950, the French Foreign Minister Robert Schuman proposed a community to integrate the coal and steel industries of Europe - these being the two elements necessary to make weapons of war. (See: <b>Schuman</b> <b>declaration).</b>|$|E

50|$|The Declaration {{is viewed}} {{as one of the}} main {{founding}} events of the EU. In 1985, during Jacques Delors's tenure as President of the European Commission, the leaders of the European Council met in Milan to decide upon 'national' symbols for the Community. They adopted those chosen by the Council of Europe previously but they changed the date of Europe Day from 5 May to 9 May, in commemoration of the <b>Schuman</b> <b>Declaration.</b> The day is now also known as Schuman Day.|$|E

[...] The ECSC was created by the Treaty of Paris and, on 18 April 1951, the leaders of the six member countries (including Schuman) signed the Europe Declaration stating that [...] "marked the true foundation of Europe." [...] The supranational Community as the fruit of the Declaration provided five still-developing European institutions: the European Commission, the European Parliament, the Consultative Committees (representing organised civil society), the Council of Ministers and the European Court of Justice.|$|E

5000|$|Historically {{the concept}} was {{introduced}} and made a concrete reality by Robert Schuman when the French Government agreed to the principle in the <b>Schuman</b> <b>Declaration</b> and accepted the Schuman Plan confined to specific sectors of vital interest of peace and war. Thus commenced the European Community system beginning with the European Coal and Steel Community. The six founder States (France, Italy, Germany, The Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg) agreed on the goal: making [...] "war not only unthinkable but materially impossible". They agreed about the means: putting the vital interests, namely coal and steel production, under a common High Authority, subject to common democratic and legal institutions. They agreed on the European {{rule of law and}} a new democratic procedure.|$|E
5000|$|... 9 May {{is celebrated}} {{in various forms}} in most member states of the European Union and EU {{candidate}} countries such as Turkey. Due to the political nature of the day, it sees attempts at teaching people about the European Union and speaking in support of European integration. The flag as another symbol {{plays a major role}} in general celebrations. Despite a preference for 9 May, with the European Union's greater visibility, 5 May is still observed by some Europeans due to the Council's role in seeking to defend human rights, parliamentary democracy, and the rule of law. In contrast, the <b>Schuman</b> <b>declaration</b> was merely proposing the pooling of French and West German coal and steel.|$|E
50|$|The {{foundation}} of OEEC 1948 started {{to integrate the}} colonial realm of Europe. The Hague Congress (1948) laid the {{foundation of}} the Council of Europe 1949. Similar as the <b>Schuman</b> <b>Declaration,</b> which named the development of Africa as a central European task, it involved as well dealings with the European colonies. However, the colonial ambitions, especially of France and its illborn French Union didn't work well with reality. France failed in regaining its colonies in Asia mid term. The lost Battle of Dien Bien Phu and the start of the Algerian War within 1954 didn't help either with the French ambitions. The failure of the strongest leftover European colonial powers, Great Britain and France, in the Suez crisis 1956 was a major shock.|$|E
5000|$|Apart {{from the}} ideas of federation, confederation, or customs union, the {{original}} development of the European Union {{was based on a}} supranational foundation that would [...] "make war unthinkable and materially impossible" [...] and reinforce democracy amongst its members as laid out by Robert Schuman and other leaders in the <b>Schuman</b> <b>Declaration</b> (1950) and the Europe Declaration (1951). This principle {{was at the heart of}} the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) (1951), the Treaty of Paris (1951), and later the Treaty of Rome (1958) which established the European Economic Community (EEC) and the European Atomic Energy Community (EAEC). Both the ECSC and EEC were later incorporated into the European Union while the EAEC maintains a distinct legal identity despite sharing members and institutions.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Schuman</b> <b>Declaration</b> is the {{statement}} {{made by the}} French foreign minister Robert Schuman on 9 May 1950. It proposed to place French and German production of coal and steel under one common High Authority. This organization {{would be open to}} participation of Western European countries. This cooperation was to be designed {{in such a way as}} to create common interests between European countries which would lead to gradual political integration, a condition for the pacification of relations between them: “Europe will not be made all at once, or according to a single plan. It will be built through concrete achievements which first create a de facto solidarity. The coming together of the nations of Europe requires the elimination of the age-old opposition of France and Germany”.|$|E
50|$|The Council of Europe {{was founded}} on 5 May 1949, and hence it chose that day for its {{celebrations}} when it established the holiday in 1964. In 1985, the European Communities (which later became the European Union) adopted the European symbols of the Council of Europe such as the Flag of Europe. However, the Community leaders decided to hold their Europe Day in commemoration of the <b>Schuman</b> <b>Declaration</b> of 9 May 1950. The declaration proposed the pooling of French and West German coal and steel industries, leading {{to the creation of}} the European Coal and Steel Community, the first European Community, and hence is considered a principal founding moment. Hence, at the 1985 Milan European Council, 29 September was adopted as the EU's flag day.|$|E
5000|$|On 9 May 1950, the French Foreign Minister Robert Schuman (on {{the basis}} of a text {{prepared}} by Schuman's colleagues Paul Reuter and Bernard Clappier working with Jean Monnet, Pierre Uri and Etienne Hirsch) made his <b>Schuman</b> <b>declaration</b> at the Quai d'Orsay,. He proposed that: [...] "Franco-German production of coal and steel as a whole be placed under a common High Authority, within the framework of an organisation open to the participation of the other countries of Europe." [...] Such an act was intended to help economic growth and cement peace between France and Germany, who had previously been longtime enemies. Coal and steel were particular symbolic as they were the resources necessary to wage war. It would also be a first step to a [...] "European federation".|$|E
