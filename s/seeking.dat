The first HDD had an average <b>seek</b> time of about 600ms;. [...] Some early PC drives used a stepper motor to move the heads, and as a result had <b>seek</b> times as slow as 80–120ms, but this was quickly improved by voice coil type actuation in the 1980s, reducing <b>seek</b> times to around 20ms. <b>Seek</b> time has continued to improve slowly over time. [...] The fastest server drives today have a <b>seek</b> time around 4 ms. The average <b>seek</b> time is strictly the time to do all possible <b>seeks</b> divided by the number of all possible <b>seeks,</b> but in practice is determined by statistical methods or simply approximated as the time of a <b>seek</b> over one-third of the number of tracks.|$|R
