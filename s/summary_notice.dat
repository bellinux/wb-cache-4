I must bring this paper, perforce, to a conclusion, and this I cannot do better than by a <b>summary</b> <b>notice</b> of a very decent, but rather {{elaborate}} diddle, of which our own city was made the theatre, not very long ago, and which was subsequently repeated with success, in other still more verdant localities of the Union. A middle-aged gentleman arrives in town from parts unknown. He is remarkably precise, cautious, staid, and deliberate in his demeanor. His dress is scrupulously neat, but plain, unostentatious. He wears a white cravat, an ample waistcoat, made with an eye to comfort alone; thick-soled cosy-looking shoes, and pantaloons without straps. He has the whole air, in fact, of your well-to-do, sober-sided, exact, and respectable [...] "man of business," [...] Par excellence--one of the stern and outwardly hard, internally soft, sort of people that we see in the crack high comedies--fellows whose words are so many bonds, and who are noted for giving away guineas, in charity, with the one hand, while, in the way of mere bargain, they exact the uttermost fraction of a farthing with the other.|$|E

5000|$|In October 2005, Netflix {{proposed}} a settlement {{for those who}} had enrolled as a paid Netflix member prior to January 15, 2005. These earlier members would be able to renew their subscriptions with a one-month free membership, and those early members with current subscriptions would receive a one-month free upgrade to the next-highest membership level. Netflix's settlement denied allegations of any wrongdoing, and the case did not reach a legal judgment. Netflix estimated the settlement cost approximately US$4 million, which included up to US$2.53 million to cover plaintiff lawyer fees. A controversial aspect of the settlement offer was that the customer's account would continue at the renewed or upgraded membership level after the free month provided by the settlement, with customers being charged accordingly unless they opted out after the month-long free period ended. After Trial Lawyers for Public Justice filed a challenge to the proposed settlement and the Federal Trade Commission filed an amicus brief urging the rejection or modification of the settlement, Netflix offered to alter the settlement terms, requiring customers to actively approve any continuation after the free month. The final settlement hearing took place on March 22, 2006. Implementation of the settlement was delayed pending appeal in the California Appellate Courts. The settlement was affirmed on April 21, 2008, with the court stating, [...] "the trial court did not abuse its discretion in approving the amended class action settlement agreement, approving the notice given to class members, or determining the amount of fees." [...] The court approved email notice and an online claims submission process. The court said:The <b>summary</b> <b>notice</b> and long-form notice together provided all of the detail required by statute or court rule, in a highly accessible form. The fact that not all of the information was contained in a single e-mail or mailing is immaterial… Using a <b>summary</b> <b>notice</b> that directed the class member wanting more information to a Web site containing a more detailed notice, and provided hyperlinks to that Web site, was a perfectly acceptable manner of giving notice in this case… The class members conducted business with defendant over the Internet, and can be assumed to know how to navigate between the <b>summary</b> <b>notice</b> and the Web site. Using the capability of the Internet in that fashion was a sensible and efficient way of providing notice, especially compared to the alternative Vogel apparently preferred—mailing out a lengthy legalistic document that few class members {{would have been able to}} plow through.The settlement was criticized because it paid out $2.5 million to attorneys for fees and costs, while offering only coupons to the class members.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} been done to create models that predict the {{response}} of the human visual system (HVS) based on how the HVS processes an image. The most widely known of these models is the Gabor model, since the Gabor patterns closely resemble the receptive filters in the human eye. The work of this thesis examines the use of Symlets to represent the HVS, since Symlets provide the benefit of orthogonality. One major problem with Symlets is that the energy is not stable in respective Symlet channels when the image patterns are translated spatially. This thesis addresses this problem by up sampling Symlets instead of down sampling, and thus creating shift invariant Symlets. This thesis then compares the representation of Gabor versus Symlet approach in predicting the response of the HVS to detecting print defect patterns such as banding and graining. In <b>summary</b> we <b>noticed</b> that Symlet prediction outperforms the Gabor prediction thus Symlets would be a good choice for HVS response prediction. We also concluded that for banding defect periodicity and size are important factors that affect the response of the HVS to the patterns. For graining defects we noticed that size does not greatly affect the response of the HVS to the defect patterns. We introduced our result...|$|R

40|$|The {{essential}} postulates {{of classical}} thermodynamics are formulated, {{from which the}} second law is deduced as the principle of increase of entropy in irreversible adiabatic processes that take one equilibrium state to another. The entropy constructed here is defined only for equilibrium states and no attempt is made to define it otherwise. Statistical mechanics does not enter these considerations. One of the main concepts that makes everything work is the comparison principle (which, in essence, states that given any two states of the same chemical composition at least one is adiabatically accessible from the other) and we show {{that it can be}} derived from some assumptions about the pressure and thermal equilibrium. Temperature is derived from entropy, but at the start not even the concept of `hotness' is assumed.

40|$|Three epileptic {{children}} who had been treated with antiepileptic drugs (AED) including carbamazepine (CBZ) were eventually found to be suffering from acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Case 1, a boy, had been healthy until age 8, when generalized tonic-clonic seizures first occurred. Seizures persisted despite treatment with phenobarbital sodium (PB), phenytoin (PHT) and valproate sodium (VPA). At the age of 9, complex partial seizures (CPS) developed in this boy. CBZ was therefore added to the treatment regimen, and the previous prescription was stopped. Five months later, {{it was found that the}} boy was suffering from ALL. Case 2, also a boy, was born with complicating intraventricular hemorrhage in the neonatal period. An epileptiform EEG abnormality was noticed at age 2, when VPA administration was started. Despite this, an episode of CPS occurred at the age of 4, which prompted us to switch the treatment from VPA to CBZ. His later course was uneventful until the age of 8, when hematological problems became evident, and a diagnosis of ALL was made. Case 3, a boy, was initially treated with CBZ because of autism and EEG abnormality at 12 years of age. In addition to CBZ, haloperidol and promethazine hydrochloride were given at the age of 13 years. ALL developed at the age of 14 years 2 months. In <b>summary,</b> ALL was <b>noticed</b> in three epileptic boys on AED therapy, all of whom were receiving CBZ. No causal relationship between AED (especially CBZ) and ALL has been established. While these three cases may represent mere coincidence, they may also suggest that we should keep ALL in mind when treating children with AED therapy...|$|R

Officially the Department was divided into four sections: Press and Radio, Lecture and Reading, Scientific Section and Collections of book. There were also the committee and community events. The Department supervised as well the Little Forms Theatre called „Miniatury” as the Youth Sections till September 1945. The article presents the ventures of Peripheral Management in Lvov in the cultural and educational field. The ventures included such actions as taking part „Help Action” in Warsaw, collecting Polish books, creating common rooms for the young and organizing the Scientific Section and Radio Committee (since February 1, 1945 the people in Lvov could listen to Polish radio programs every day between 12 and 1 p. m.). The most imported initiatives of the Department were academies devoted to some important holidays and anniversaries like: Independence Day, May 1, May 3, Kościuszko celebrations, the anniversary of Lenino battle and October Revolution.

(The district was often a target in the Coventry Blitz of 1940-41.) At King Henry VIII School, he responded to the maverick style of headmaster A. A. C. Burton, but not to his conventional successor, H.Walker. He trained as a reporter on The Coventry Standard, under the painstakingly prosaic editorship of Edgar Letts, who was prone to ask of Shaw's copy, [...] "Is this true?". He then studied at The University of Leeds, supplementing his grant with work as a correspondent for the Manchester office of Melody Maker and as a freelance for the Yorkshire Evening Post. His honours degree included a [...] "first" [...] in English Literature. (Among his tutors was the much admired scholar G. Wilson Knight,whose tutorial speculations tended to centre on his spiritualist experiences. Another focus of literary interest was the Professor of English, Bonamy Dobree, regarded by many literary critics as the original of Professor Welch in Lucky Jim.) Shaw's two years as a conscript in the Army included periods at the Joint Services School for Linguists run by the Services' Intelligence arm, and, briefly, the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, on posting from which he reverted to private. His final year's service - at the Cavalry Barracks, York - was marked by offences [...] "against military order and good discipline". For some years he then taught English in schools and adult education for the Workers' Educational Association. From 1964 to 1968 he combined being Head of English and Sixth Form at the Leeds Modern School, with a part-time Tutorship at Leeds University and a Visiting Fellowship at The University of York. From 1968 to 1972 he was Lecturer at The University of Southampton. In 1972 he became a freelance, returning to Yorkshire, to the Pennine village of Haworth where his wife, the studio-potter Anne Shaw, had set up Haworth Pottery. He toured Britain, from the Isle of Wight to Pitlochry, giving [...] "readings" [...] of his poems, sometimes with jazz. Sponsors included W H Smith, The Arts Council of Great Britain, Boots UK, and The Department of Education. He also reviewed, wrote for television and radio, contributed literary criticism and edited The Yorkshire Review for the regional arts association.
