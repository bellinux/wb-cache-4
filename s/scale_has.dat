5|$|The {{existence}} of the different scales means that {{care must be taken}} when comparing large numbers between languages or countries, or when interpreting old documents in countries where the dominant <b>scale</b> <b>has</b> changed over time. For example, British English, French, and Italian historical documents can refer to either the short or long scale, depending on the date of the document, since each of the three countries has used both systems at various times in its history. Today, the United Kingdom officially uses the short scale, but France and Italy use the long scale.|$|E
5|$|A {{theodolite}} can {{be considerably}} more accurate if used correctly, {{but it is}} also considerably more difficult to use correctly. There is no inherent way to align a theodolite with North and so the <b>scale</b> <b>has</b> to be calibrated using astronomical observation, usually the position of the Sun. Because the position of celestial bodies changes with the time of day due to the Earth's rotation, the time of these calibration observations must be accurately known, or else there will be a systematic error in the measurements. Horizon altitudes can be measured with a theodolite or a clinometer.|$|E

5|$|Several scales {{exist to}} grade the {{severity}} of acne vulgaris, but no single technique has been universally accepted as the diagnostic standard. Cook's acne grading scale uses photographs to grade severity from 0 to 8 (0 being the least severe and 8 being the most severe). This scale {{was the first to}} use a standardized photographic protocol to assess acne severity; since its creation in 1979, the <b>scale</b> <b>has</b> undergone several revisions. The Leeds acne grading technique counts acne lesions on the face, back, and chest and categorizes them as inflammatory or non-inflammatory. Leeds scores range from 0 (least severe) to 10 (most severe) though modified scales have a maximum score of 12. The Pillsbury acne grading scale simply classifies {{the severity of}} the acne from 1 (least severe) to 4 (most severe).|$|E

Although enka is a genre of kayōkyoku, it is considered to be more expressive and emotional, though there is no clear consensus on the matter.|$|E

40|$|Background: Different scales {{claim to}} measure the {{construct}} ‘‘Sense of Coherence’’. Results from these <b>scales</b> <b>have</b> been compared without knowing whether they measure the same construct. This article compares two versions of Antonovsky’s original scale (SOC- 13 and SOC- 29), translated into Swedish, and a three-item scale (SOC- 3) that claims to measure Sense of Coherence. Methods: The data were analysed in a cross-sectional setting. The study consisted of university students studying social work (n = 395). Results: The original <b>scales</b> <b>had</b> no distribution problems in differentiating Sense of Coherence. The SOC- 3 had severe distribution problems.

25|$|The {{circle is}} {{commonly}} used to represent the relationship between diatonic scales. Here, the letters on the circle are taken to represent the major scale with that note as tonic. The numbers {{on the inside of}} the circle show how many sharps or flats the key signature for this <b>scale</b> <b>has.</b> Thus a major scale built on A has 3 sharps in its key signature. The major scale built on F has 1 flat.|$|E
25|$|The Kinsey <b>scale</b> <b>has</b> been {{praised for}} dismissing the dichotomous {{classification}} {{of sexual orientation}} and allowing for {{a new perspective on}} human sexuality. However, the <b>scale</b> <b>has</b> been criticized because it is still not a true continuum. Despite seven categories being able to provide a more accurate description of sexual orientation than a dichotomous scale it is still difficult to determine which category individuals should be assigned to. In a major study comparing sexual response in homosexual males and females, Masters and Johnson discuss the difficulty of assigning the Kinsey ratings to participants. Particularly, they found it difficult to determine the relative amount heterosexual and homosexual experience and response in a person's history when using the scale. They report finding it difficult to assign ratings 2-4 for individuals with a large number of heterosexual and homosexual experiences. When there are a substantial number of heterosexual and homosexual experiences in one's history it becomes difficult for that individual to be fully objective in assessing the relative amount of each.|$|E

In Japan, where space in homes is more limited, N scale is the most popular scale, and HO scale is considered large. Not all modellers select N because they have small spaces; some use N scale to build more complex or more visually expansive models.|$|E

40|$|Speed <b>scaling</b> <b>has</b> {{long been}} used as a power-saving {{mechanism}} at a chip level. However, in recent years, speed <b>scaling</b> <b>has</b> begun to be used as an approach for trading off energy usage and performance throughout all levels of computer systems. This wide-spread use of speed <b>scaling</b> <b>has</b> motivated significant research on the topic, but many fundamental questions about speed scaling are only beginning to be understood. In this chapter, we focus on a simple, but general, model of speed scaling and provide an algorithmic perspective on four fundamental questions: (i) What is the structure of the optimal speed scaling algorithm? (ii) How does speed scaling interact with scheduling? (iii) What is the impact of the sophistication of speed scaling algorithms? and (iv) Does speed <b>scaling</b> <b>have</b> any unintended consequences? For each question we provide a summary of insights from recent work on the topic in both worst-case and stochastic analysis as well as a discussion of interesting open questions that remain. ...|$|R
