30|$|For deep endometriosis (D) {{we suggest}} to {{classify}} them as D 1, D 2, and D 3 being {{the total volume}} corresponding to a nodule of less than 1  cm, between 1 and 3  cm and more than 3  cm in diameter. Since the importance for the associated pelvic pain, it is suggested to score in addition the localization, (rectovaginal, <b>sigmoid,</b> <b>bladder)</b> {{and the presence of}} hydronefrosis.|$|E
30|$|A 46 -year-old menopausal woman {{presented}} with haematuria and rectal bleeding. She was already {{known to have}} had endometriosis and had previously undergone a left salpingo-oophorectomy at age 23, followed by a total abdominal hysterectomy and right salpingo-oophorectomy at age 40. Although initially compliant with hormone therapy replacement (first estradiol implants, then Evorel 50 patches), she had stopped taking it 12  months prior to presentation. A cystoscopy was performed and bladder biopsies taken. These confirmed endometriosis. Subsequent imaging with computed tomography suggested a left-sided pelvic mass. She underwent laparotomy, where she {{was found to have}} a 5 -cm endometriotic nodule in the sigmoid that was adherent to the <b>bladder.</b> The affected <b>sigmoid</b> and <b>bladder</b> were excised and sent for histology. This revealed florid endometriosis with polypoid endometrial mucosal lesions with vascular invasion involving both bowel and bladder.|$|R
40|$|AbstractIntroductionA sliding hernia {{is a rare}} type of {{inguinal}} hernia in which the hernia sac is partially formed by {{the wall of a}} viscus, such as the <b>sigmoid</b> colon, <b>bladder,</b> cecum, or appendix. Sliding hernias involving the bladder often present with obstructive urinary symptoms that could potential lead to serious complications. Case presentationIn this case, we present a 37 -year-old male with a recurrent sliding hernia containing the dome of the bladder after prior laparoscopic repair of a direct {{inguinal hernia}} with mesh. DiscussionA TAPP approach is preferred over a TEP approach in the laparoscopic repair of a sliding hernia; however, an open Lichenstein repair should be used in cases of recurrent hernias with severe complications, such as extensive adhesions or incarceration. ConclusionThe surgical approach for repair of a sliding hernia must be individualized based on the patient’s clinical presentation and diagnostic findings...|$|R
40|$|The {{clinical}} {{course of}} a case of vesicosigmoidal fistula is presented. The patient, a 76 -year-old woman, became aware of terminal micturition pain and pollakisuria in February, 1985. She was first treated under the diagnosis of cystitis to be relieved of her subjective symptoms, {{although there was no}} improvement of pyuria. She also began to feel lower abdominal pain on April 3, 1985. After various examinations including intravenous pyelography, enteroclysis and cystoscopy the diagnosis of vesicosigmoidal fistula originating from sigmoid diverticulitis was established. Careful observation at operation revealed remarkable adhesion among the <b>sigmoid</b> colon, <b>bladder,</b> uterus and left ovary. The sigmoid colon, was resected followed by end-to-end anastomosis. Because of considerably extensive inflammatory changes over the mucosal membrane of the bladder, the hole of fistula on the vesical wall was simply closed from outside of the bladder without performing partial cystectomy. Histological examination only demonstrated non-specific inflammatory changes without evidence of malignancy. She had a favorable progress postoperatively...|$|R
40|$|Adenocarcinoma of the {{appendix}} is rare, usually being diagnosed intraoperatively when performing appendicectomy or at subsequent histological examination. Here we report a case with acute abdominal pain, rectal bleeding with haematuria being the presenting symptoms. Subsequent computerised tomography demonstrated a complex mass involving the ileum, right colon, <b>sigmoid</b> colon and <b>bladder</b> with {{inflammatory bowel disease}} being the most likely cause. At laparotomy a right hemicolectomy, sigmoid colectomy and partial cystectomy was performed with pathological specimens confirming an appendiceal adenocarcinoma as {{the primary source of}} the abdominal mass fistulating into adjacent structures. We conclude that although appendiceal tumours are rare – usually diagnosed at appendicectomy, they should be considered in the diagnosis of complex abdominal masses involving small bowel, large bowel and adjacent pelvic structures...|$|R
40|$|A 4 {{year old}} {{castrated}} male Pygmy goat {{presented to the}} Cornell University Farm Animal Hospital {{with a history of}} lethargy and dribbling urine. On presentation, the patient was alert but quiet and painful on abdominal palpation. Urinary obstruction was confirmed via abdominal ultrasound. Urethral process amputation and tube cystostomy were performed, but the patient remained uncomfortable and began to strain during the week following surgery despite multimodal pain management. Contrast cystourethrography revealed numerous radiopaque calculi obstructing the urethra {{at the level of the}} <b>sigmoid</b> flexure; no <b>bladder</b> or urethral rupture was evident. The patient was anesthetized and a perineal urethrostomy with penile amputation was performed. Analysis of the calculi obtained at the time of surgery revealed 100 % calcium carbonate. The patient was discharged to the care of his owners with a diet plan formulated to achieve weight loss and decrease the risk of recurrent urolithiasis...|$|R
40|$|A 74 -year-old {{woman was}} {{referred}} to our hospital with the chief complaints of pneumaturia, fecaluria and discharge of feces and urine from vagina. Fistulography on the vaginal side showed the presence of contrast medium both in the <b>sigmoid</b> colon and <b>bladder.</b> Colonoscopy revealed multiple diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon. Under diagnosis of colo-vesico-vaginal fistula due to sigmoid colon diverticulitis, a one-stage operation removing sigmoid colon, uterus-vaginal wall and urinary bladder wall including the fistula and careful reconstruction was performed. Postoperatively, urinary leakage from vagina in large amounts continued due to the recurrence of vesico-vaginal fistula. An attempt to use human fibrin glue in the recurrent fistula was successful, and the patient was asymptomatic at 21 months of follow-up. Colovesical fistula {{has been reported in}} about 10 - 20 % of patients undergoing surgery for complicated diverticulitis, but a combined fistula is a rare condition. Furthermore, we recommend the use of human fibrin glue for a recurrent fistula...|$|R
40|$|We report here a {{rare case}} of {{urethral}} fistula and scrotal abscess associated with colovesical fistula due to sigmoid colon cancer. An 84 -year-old male {{was referred to}} our hospital complaining of macrohematuria, fecaluria, pneumaturia and micturitional pain. Computed tomography (CT) showed colovesical fistula. Other examinations, including colonoscopy and cystoscopy, did not reveal a clear cause for the colovesical fistula. Only an elevated serum level of the tumor marker CA 19 - 9 suggested the possibility of sigmoid colon cancer. Eleven days after hospitalization, bilateral scrotal contents had swollen rapidly {{to the size of}} a goose egg. CT suggested urethral fistula with scrotal abscess formation. Drainage of scrotal abscess and colostomy were performed. Intraoperatively, the fistula of the bulbar urethra was revealed. Because increased serum CA 19 - 9 suggested a diagnosis of sigmoid colon cancer, cystectomy and sigmoid colectomy with right nephrectomy were performed. Pathological examination revealed adenocarcinoma of <b>sigmoid</b> colon with <b>bladder</b> invasion. His condition was improved with rehabilitation 6 months after operation...|$|R
40|$|Introduction The {{standard}} {{treatment of}} colo-vesical fistula is the exeresis of fistula, suture of bladder wall, colic resection {{with or without}} temporary colostomy. Usually the approach is open because conversion rates and morbidity are lower than laparoscopy. The aim of video is to show the steps of a new mini-invasive approach of colo-vesical fistula without colic resection. Materials and Methods A 69 years old male underwent laparoscopic conservative treatment of colo-vesical fistula due to endoscopic polipectomy in sigmoid diverticulum. 12 mm trocar for the camera was placed at the umbilicus, two 10 mm trocars were placed along bisiliac line and 5 mm port was placed along left emiclavear line; Trendelenburg position was 20 &# 176;. The fistulous loop was carefully isolated, clipped with Hem-o-lock&# 174; clips and removed. Since diverticular disease appeared slight and no inflammation signs were evident, colon resection was not performed. We sutured and sinked the sigmoid wall; after curettage of the fistula site, the bladder wall was sutured. Fat tissue was placed between <b>sigmoid</b> and <b>bladder</b> wall {{to reduce the risk}} of fistula recurrence. Results Operative time, estimated blood loss, catheterization time, time to flatus and hospital stay were respectively 210 minutes, 300 mL, 10 days, 48 h and 8 days. The histological examination showed colonic inflammatory and necrotic tissue. No complications or fistula recurrence occurred at 54 months follow-up. Conclusions The laparoscopic conservative treatment of colo-vesical fistula is a safe and feasible technique, in particular when the diverticular disease is limited and the fistula is not due to diverticulitis...|$|R
40|$|Endometriosis (Sampson, 1921) is the {{endometrium}} or {{the tissue}} originated from it, which including the isolated glands {{and the surrounding}} stroma of endometrial type, and grow and multiply beyond the uterine cavity. This tissue behaves in quite {{the same manner as}} the endometrium periodically according to the menstrual cycles. Some ectopic locations of this tissue are seen in ovaries, uterine ligaments (round, uterosacral), rectovaginal septum, pelvic peritoneum containing the uterus, tubes, rectum, <b>sigmoid</b> or <b>bladder,</b> umbillicus, scars after laparotomy, hernial sacs, appendix, vagina, vulva, cervix, tubal stumps, lymph gland, perineum, inguinal area, lung, etc. This dis e a se is observed mainly in the female genital organs. The existance of the disease in the urological organs is generally rare, although its frequency in the urinary bladder is commonly known. Judd (1 921) reported a case that was first recognized cystoscopically and that made a favorable turn after resection of the tumor. He suggested in his report that {{there might have been a}} complicated lesion in the upper urinary tract. Subsequently Kretschemer (1945), Beecham and McCrea (1957), Abeshouse and Abeshouse (1960) have made critical review of endometriosis in the field of urology on the clinical and pathological points of view. Our case, Who was a 39 years old female and para 2, v isited us with complaints of vesical symptoms (burning on urination, low abdominal pains) before and after the menses during the past one year. On urological examination, some scattered hemispheric cysts about the size of peas were demonstrated in the region of the trigone, among which were recognized several chocolate cysts, and a diagnosis of vesical endometriosis was made. After hysterooophorectomy and partial cystectomy, the vesical symptoms disappeared. The histological examination revealed the picture of endometriosis alone in the bladder. Based on our case, discussions were made mainly on defini t i on, pathogenesis, frequency of vesical endometriosis age, problems of whether primary or secondary, urological complications, clinical examinations of endometriosis in our country, and histological review of this differentiation between this disease and stromal endometriosis, and its malignant changes...|$|R
40|$|The epidemiology, {{clinical}} picture and pathology of {{an outbreak of}} urolithiasis in cattle in southern Brazil are described. The disease occurred in August 1999 in a feedlot beef cattle herd. Five out of 1, 100 castrated steers were affected. Clinical signs included colic and ventral abdominal distension. White, sand-grain-like mineral deposits precipitated on the preputial hairs. Affected cattle died spontaneously 24 - 48 hrs after {{the onset of the}} clinical signs. Only one animal recovered after perineal urethrostomy. Necropsy findings included calculi blocking the urethral lumen of the distal portion of the penile <b>sigmoid</b> flexure, urinary <b>bladder</b> rupture with leakage of urine into the abdominal cavity and secondary fibrinous peritonitis. Daily water intake was low since water sources were scarce and not readily available. The animals were fed rations high in grains and received limited amounts of roughage. Biochemical analysis revealed that the calculi were composed of ammonium phosphate. A calcium-phosphorus imbalance (0. 4 : 0. 6) was detected in the feedlot ration. For the outbreak, it is suggested that contributing factors to urolith formation include insufficient fiber ingestion, low water intake and high dietary levels of phosphorus. No additional cases were observed in that feedlot after preventive measures were established. Similar dietary mismanagement in fattening steers has been associated with obstructive urolithiasis in feedlot beef cattle in other countries...|$|R
30|$|Hysterectomy in frozen pelvis is a {{challenging}} surgical condition whether done by laparotomy or laparoscopy. We describe an alternative technique of total laparoscopic hysterectomy with retrograde adhesiolysis {{in patients with}} frozen pelvis. Total laparoscopic hysterectomy with retrograde adhesiolysis was done in 25 patients with frozen pelvis between October 2003 and May 2012. The mean (standard deviation; 95  % confidence interval) age of patients was 42.6 (6.00; 40.1 – 45.07). Body mass index was 27.48 (5.06; 25.3 – 29.57). Twenty (80  %) patients had previous abdominal surgery, and three (15  %) patients had previous failed surgeries for attempted hysterectomy. Twenty-three patients had frozen pelvis due to severe endometriosis, and two patients had severe abdominopelvic adhesions due to multiple previous surgeries. One patient had intraoperative injury to the <b>sigmoid</b> colon and <b>bladder</b> during adhesiolysis, and laparotomy conversion was performed. The median (range) operating time was 210 (120 – 300) min, and estimated blood loss was 400 (300 – 600) ml. Length of post-operative stay was 1 (1 – 6) days, and the post-operative period was uneventful except in two patients who had paralytic ileus. The median (range) follow-up at 1  month and 6  months was 100 and 68  % (17 of 25), respectively. Our technique of laparoscopic hysterectomy with retrograde adhesiolysis and subsequent removal of adnexa is an alternative technique for hysterectomy in frozen pelvis and limits the potential hazards of injury to vital organs; it is associated with fewer complications. We emphasize that adequate surgical experience and expertise still remain the prerequisites for performing hysterectomy in frozen pelvis.|$|R
40|$|Introduction Dose {{calculation}} of tumor and surrounding tissues is essential during prostate brachytherapy. Three radioisotopes, namely, 125 I, 103 Pd, and 131 Cs, are extensively {{used in this}} method. In this study, we aimed to calculate the received doses by the prostate and critical organs using the aforementioned radioactive seeds and to investigate the effect of scattering contribution for the legs on dose calculations. Materials and Methods The doses to organs of interest were calculated using MCNPX code and ORNL (Oak Ridge National Laboratory) phantom. Results Doses to the prostate {{as a source of}} radiation for 125 I, 103 Pd, and 131 Cs were approximately 108. 9, 97. 7, and 81. 5 Gy, respectively. <b>Bladder,</b> <b>sigmoid</b> colon, and testes received higher doses than other organs due to proximity to the prostate. Differences between the doses when tallying with the legs intact and with the legs voided were significant for testes, sigmoid colon contents, and sigmoid colon wall because of their proximity to the prostate. There was also a good consistency between our results and the data published by Montefiore Medical Center and Albert Einstein College of Medicine for the prostate. Conclusion Scattering from leg region had a significant effect on doses to testes, sigmoid colon contents, and sigmoid colon wall in the pelvic region, and prostate and the other organs were unaffected. Brachytherapy treatment plans using 131 Cs seeds allow for better sparing of critical tissues, with a comparable number of, or fewer, seeds required, compared to 125 I seeds...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} the potential clinical benefit from both target tailoring by excluding the tumour-free proximal part of the uterus during image-guided adaptive radiotherapy (IGART) and improved dose conformity based on intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT). The study included planning CTs from 11 previously treated patients with cervical cancer with a > 4 -cm tumour-free part of the proximal uterus on diagnostic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). IGART and robustly optimised IMPT plans were generated for both conventional target volumes and for MRI-based target tailoring (where the non-invaded proximal part of the uterus was excluded), yielding four treatment plans per patient. For each plan, the V 15 Gy, V 30 Gy, V 45 Gy and Dmean for <b>bladder,</b> <b>sigmoid,</b> rectum and bowel bag were compared, and the normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) for ≥grade 2 acute small bowel toxicity was calculated. Both IMPT and MRI-based target tailoring resulted in significant reductions in V 15 Gy, V 30 Gy, V 45 Gy and Dmean for bladder and small bowel. IMPT reduced the NTCP for small bowel toxicity from 25 % to 18 %; this was further reduced to 9 % when combined with MRI-based target tailoring. In four of the 11 patients (36 %), NTCP reductions of > 10 % were estimated by IMPT, and in six of the 11 patients (55 %) when combined with MRI-based target tailoring. This > 10 % NTCP reduction was expected if the V 45 Gy for bowel bag was > 275 [*]cm(3) and > 200 [*]cm(3), respectively, during standard IGART alone. In patients with cervical cancer, both proton therapy and MRI-based target tailoring lead to a significant reduction in the dose to surrounding organs at risk and small bowel toxicit...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{provide a}} fast {{computational}} method, {{based on the}} proximal graph solver (POGS) - a convex optimization solver using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), for calculating an optimal treatment plan in rotating shield brachytherapy (RSBT). RSBT treatment planning has more degrees of freedom than conventional high-dose-rate brachytherapy (HDR-BT) due to the addition of emission direction, and this necessitates a fast optimization technique to enable clinical usage. // Methods: The multi-helix RSBT (H-RSBT) delivery technique was considered with five representative cervical cancer patients. Treatment plans were generated for all patients using the POGS method and the previously considered commercial solver IBM CPLEX. The rectum, <b>bladder,</b> <b>sigmoid,</b> high-risk clinical target volume (HR-CTV), and HR-CTV boundary were the structures considered in our optimization problem, called the asymmetric dose-volume optimization with smoothness control. Dose calculation resolution was 1 x 1 x 3 mm^ 3 for all cases. The H-RSBT applicator has 6 helices, with 33. 3 mm of translation along the applicator per helical rotation and 1. 7 mm spacing between dwell positions, yielding 17. 5 degree emission angle spacing per 5 mm along the applicator. // Results: For each patient, HR-CTV D 90, HR-CTV D 100, rectum D 2 cc, sigmoid D 2 cc, and bladder D 2 cc matched within 1 % for CPLEX and POGS. Also, we obtained similar EQD 2 figures between CPLEX and POGS. POGS was around 18 times faster than CPLEX. Over all patients, total optimization times were 32. 1 - 65. 4 seconds for CPLEX and 2. 1 - 3. 9 seconds for POGS. // Conclusions: POGS substantially reduced treatment plan optimization time around 18 times for RSBT with similar HR-CTV D 90, OAR D 2 cc values, and EQD 2 figure relative to CPLEX, which is significant progress toward clinical translation of RSBT. POGS is also applicable to conventional HDR-BT. Comment: 9 pages, 3 figure...|$|R
