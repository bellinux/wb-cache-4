Here we reveal that during murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV 68) infection, rapidly induced SINE RNAs activate the antiviral NF-κB signaling path-way through both mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) -dependent and indepen-dent mechanisms.

PLoS ONE 11 (10) : e 0163215. [URL] families of <b>short</b> <b>interspersed</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>element</b> (SINE) sequences in the human pathogenic fungus Aspergillus fumigatus, clinical isolate Af 293, were identified and categorised into tRNA-related and 5 S rRNA-related SINEs. Eight predicted tRNA-related SINE families originating from different tRNAs, and nominated as AfuSINE 2 sequences, contained target site duplications of short direct repeat sequences (4 - 14 bp) flanking the elements, an extended tRNA-unrelated region and typical features of RNA polymerase III promoter sequences. The elements ranged in size from 140 - 493 bp and were present in low copy number in the genome and five out of eight were actively transcribed. One putative tRNAArg-derived sequence, AfuSINE 2 - 1 a possessed a unique feature of repeated trinucleotide ACT residues at its 3 '-terminus. This element was similar in sequence to the I- 4 _AO element found in A. oryzae and an I- 1 _AF long nuclear interspersed element-like sequence identified in A. fumigatus Af 293. Families of 5 S rRNA-related SINE sequences, nominated as AfuSINE 3, were also identified and their 5 '- 5 S rRNA-related regions show 50 - 65 % and 60 - 75 % similarity to respectively A. fumigatus 5 S rRNAs and SINE 3 - 1 _AO found in A. oryzae. A. fumigatus Af 293 contains five copies of AfuSINE 3 sequences ranging in size from 259 - 343 bp and two out of five AfuSINE 3 sequences were actively transcribed. Investigations on AfuSINE distribution in the fungal genome revealed that the elements are enriched in pericentromeric and subtelomeric regions and inserted within gene-rich regions. We also demonstrated that some, but not all, AfuSINE sequences are targeted by host RNA silencing mechanisms. Finally, we demonstrated that infection of the fungus with mycoviruses had no apparent effects on SINE activity...|$|E
40|$|A {{simple and}} {{effective}} method based upon semi-specific PCR followed by cloning has been developed. Chromosomal mapping of the generated fragment on a somatic cell hybrid panel identifies the chromosomal position, and yields a unique sequence tag for the site. Using this method, the chromosomal location of one {{porcine endogenous retrovirus}} (PERV) was determined. The porcine genomic sequences were first amplified by PCR using a PERV-specific primer and a porcine <b>short</b> <b>interspersed</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>element</b> (SINE) -specific primer. PCR products were cloned, and those sequences that contained PERV plus flanking regions were selected using {{a second round of}} PCR and cloning. Sequences flanking the PERV were determined and a PERV-B was physically mapped on porcine chromosome 17 using a somatic hybrid panel. The general utility of the method was subsequently demonstrated by locating PERVs in the genome of PERV infected human 293 cells. This method obviates the need for individual library construction or linker/adaptor ligation, and can be used to quickly locate individual sites of moderately repeated, dispersed DNA sequences in any genome...|$|E

Along with the primate Alu, the galago Alu type II, and the rodent B 1, these two families represent the fourth and fifth 7 SL RNA–derived SINE families to be identified. Furthermore, comparison of the Alu domains of Tu types I and II with those of other 7 SL RNA–derived SINEs reveals that the nucleotides responsible for stabilization of the Alu domain have been conserved during evolution, providing the possibility that these conserved nucleotides play an indispensable role in retropositional activity.

40|$|The Author(s) 2017. Published by Oxford University Press {{on behalf}} of Nucleic Acids Research. Short {{interspersed}} nuclear elements (SINEs) are retrotransposons evolutionarily derived from endogenous RNA Polymerase III RNAs. Though SINE elements have undergone exaptation into gene regulatory elements, how transcribed SINE RNA impacts transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation is largely unknown. This {{is partly due to}} a lack of information regarding which of the loci have transcriptional potential. Here, we present an approach (<b>short</b> <b>interspersed</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>element</b> sequencing, SINE-seq), which selectively profiles RNA Polymerase III-derived SINE RNA, thereby identifying transcriptionally active SINE loci. Applying SINEseq to monitor murine B 2 SINE expression during a gammaherpesvirus infection revealed transcription from 28 270 SINE loci, with ∼ 50 % of active SINE elements residing within annotated RNA Polymerase II loci. Furthermore, B 2 RNA can form intermolecular RNA-RNA interactions with complementary mRNAs, leading to nuclear retention of the targeted mRNA via amechanism involving p 54 nrb.

With regard to the carcass traits, the S allele pigs (S/-) evidenced significantly heavier carcass weights and thicker backfat than was measured in L/L homozygous pigs (P    0. 05). Consequently, the faster growth rate during the late period and backfat deposition rather than intramuscular fat deposition cause differences in pig productivity according to genotypes of the AGL gene.

We report that a genome-wide B 1 SINE (<b>Short</b> <b>Interspersed</b> <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Element)</b> retrotransposon (B 1 -X 35 S) has potent intrinsic insulator activity in cultured cells and live animals. This insulation is mediated by binding of the transcription factors dioxin receptor (AHR) and SLUG (SNAI 2) to consensus elements present in the SINE. Transcription of B 1 -X 35 S is required for insulation. While basal insulator activity is maintained by RNA polymerase (Pol) III transcription, AHR-induced insulation involves release of Pol III and engagement of Pol II transcription on the same strand. B 1 -X 35 S insulation is also associated with enrichment of heterochromatin marks H 3 K 9 me 3 and H 3 K 27 me 3 downstream of B 1 -X 35 S, an effect that varies with cell type. B 1 -X 35 S binds parylated CTCF and, consistent with a chromatin barrier activity, its positioning between two adjacent genes correlates with their differential expression in mouse tissues.

This genome-wide analysis on the time-scaled expansion of retroelements sheds light on the chronologically synchronous amplification peaks of each retroelement family in variable heights across human chromosomes. Especially, L 1 s and LTRs in the highest density on sex chromosomes Xq and Y, respectively, disclose peak activities that are obscured in autosomes. The periods of young L 1, Alu, LTR, and old L 1 peak activities calibrated based on sequence divergence coincide with the divergence of the three major hominoid divergence as well as early eutherian radiation while the amplification peaks of old MIR and L 2 account for the marsupial-placental split. Overall, the peaks of autonomous LINE (young and old L 1 s and L 2 s) peaks and non-autonomous SINE (Alus and MIRs) have alternated repeatedly for 150 million years. In addition, a single burst of LTR parallels the Cretaceous-Tertiary (K-T) boundary, an exceptional global event.

The SINE insertion was genotyped in 227 horses from 10 breeds belonging to different morphological types (brachimorphic, mesomorphic, meso-dolichomorphic and dolichomorphic). The presence of the insertion was confirmed in the Quarter Horse (SINE allele frequency of 0. 81) and in the Thoroughbred (0. 51), whereas the SINE allele did not segregate in any of the other analysed breeds.

40|$|The human {{chemokine}} receptor (CKR) genes CCR 2, CCR 6, CCR 7, CCR 9, CCR 10, CXCR 4, and CXCR 5 harbor {{one or two}} introns. CCR 7, CCR 9, CCR 10, and CXCR 5 introns, (but not CCR 2, CCR 6, and CXCR 4 introns) encompass retrovirus-like inserts {{with the}} characteristics of SINEs (<b>short</b> <b>interspersed</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>elements)</b> up to 300 nucleotides (nt) long. Other characteristic elements of the retroviral genome, such as long terminal repeats and gag, pol, and env genes, are lacking. The inserts likely derived from one (or more) of the following retroviruses: XA 34 (NCBI GenBank Nucleotides, U 29659), HERV-P-T 47 D (AF 087913), ERV FTD (U 27241), HERV-K (Y 17832), HML 6 p (U 86698), HERV-H/env 60 (AJ 289710), XA 38 (U 37066). Virus-like inserts are remarkably homogeneous in all CKR introns, with nt identities of about 80...|$|R
