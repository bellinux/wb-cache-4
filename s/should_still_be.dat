5|$|One {{surprising}} {{prediction of}} the permutation by duplication mechanism is that intermediate permutations can occur. For instance, the duplicated {{version of the}} protein <b>should</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> functional, since otherwise evolution would quickly select against such proteins. Likewise, partially duplicated intermediates where only one terminus was truncated should be functional. Such intermediates have been extensively documented in protein families such as DNA methyltransferases.|$|E
5|$|The Ubn–Au bond {{should be}} the weakest of all bonds between gold and an {{alkaline}} earth metal, but <b>should</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> stable. This gives extrapolated medium-sized adsorption enthalpies (−ΔHads) of 172kJ·mol−1 on gold (the radium value should be 237kJ·mol−1) and 50kJ·mol−1 on silver, the smallest of all the alkaline earth metals, that demonstrate {{that it would be}} feasible to study the chromatographic adsorption of unbinilium onto surfaces made of noble metals. The ΔHsub and −ΔHads values are correlated for the alkaline earth metals.|$|E

5|$|This concern {{led to an}} {{independent}} review of the project by the Committee on Civil Scientific Research and Development, which met on topic between July and September 1962. The Committee ultimately rejected the economic arguments, including considerations of supporting the industry made by Thorneycroft. Their report in October stated that it was unlikely there would be any direct positive economic outcome, but that the project <b>should</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> considered {{for the simple reason}} that everyone else was going supersonic, and they were concerned they would be locked out of future markets. Conversely, it appeared the project would not be likely to significantly impact other, more important, research efforts.|$|E
5|$|The Uue–Au bond {{should be}} the weakest of all bonds between gold and an alkali metal, but <b>should</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> stable. This gives {{extrapolated}} medium-sized adsorption enthalpies (−ΔHads) of 106kJ·mol−1 on gold (the francium value should be 136kJ·mol−1), 76kJ·mol−1 on platinum, and 63kJ·mol−1 on silver, the smallest of all the alkali metals, that demonstrate {{that it would be}} feasible to study the chromatographic adsorption of ununennium onto surfaces made of noble metals. The enthalpy of adsorption of ununennium on a Teflon surface is predicted to be 17.6kJ·mol−1, which would be the lowest among the alkali metals: this information would be very useful for future chemistry experiments on ununennium. The ΔHsub and −ΔHads values are not proportionally related for the alkali metals, as they change in opposite directions as atomic number increases.|$|E
5|$|The {{rotational}} {{period of}} each star {{can be measured}} by observing periodic variations in the doppler shifts of their spectral lines. The absolute rotational velocities of the two stars are known from their inclinations, rotation periods, and sizes, but the projected equatorial rotational velocities measured using doppler broadening of spectral lines are a standard measure and these are generally quoted. Capella Aa has a projected rotational velocity of 4.1±0.4 km per second, taking 104 ± 3 days to complete one rotation, while Capella Ab spins much more rapidly at 35.0±0.5 km per second, completing a full rotation in only 8.5 ± 0.2 days. Rotational braking occurs in all stars when they expand into giants, and binary stars are also tidally braked. Capella Aa has slowed until it is rotationally locked to the orbital period, although theory predicts that it <b>should</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> rotating more quickly from a starting point of a rapidly-spinning main sequence A star.|$|E

5|$|However, {{at least}} in the UK, there are signs that the courts may be moving towards showing more {{flexibility}} in granting advisory declarations. In R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Salem (1999), Salem, a citizen of Libya, was granted temporary admission to the UK to pursue an asylum claim. One month later, the Home Office recorded in an internal file that Salem's asylum claim had been refused, but did not communicate the decision to him. Salem only found out when his income support ceased, and the Benefits Agency told him that they had been informed that he had been refused asylum. Subsequently, Salem unsuccessfully sought leave to apply for judicial review of the Home Secretary's decision to notify the Department of Social Security that his asylum claim had been rejected. He then obtained leave to appeal the matter to the House of Lords, but was then granted refugee status. Before the House of Lords, Salem argued that his appeal <b>should</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> heard as the question of law in his case was one of general public importance. The court held that it had discretion to hear an appeal which concerns an issue involving a public authority as to a question of public law, even where {{there is no longer any}} live issue which would affect the rights and duties of the parties themselves. However, the court cautioned that this discretion has to be exercised with circumspection and entertained only where there was a good public interest reason to do so. It is not yet known whether the Singapore High Court will adopt a similar approach.|$|E
