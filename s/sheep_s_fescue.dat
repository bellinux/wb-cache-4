40|$|Abstract Background Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP), the causative {{agent of}} Johne's disease (JD) {{persistently}} infects and survives within the host macrophages. While it is established that substantial genotypic variation exists among MAP, {{evidence for the}} correlates that associate specific MAP genotypes with clinical or sub-clinical disease phenotypes is presently unknown. Thus we studied strain differences in intracellular MAP survival and host responses in a bovine monocyte derived macrophage (MDM) system. Results Intracellular survival studies showed that a bovine MAP isolate (B 1018) and a human MAP isolate (Hu 6) persisted in relatively higher numbers when compared with a <b>sheep</b> MAP isolate (<b>S</b> 7565) at 24 -hr, 48 -hr and 96 -hr post infection (PI). MDMs stimulated with B 1018 up-regulated IL- 10 at the transcript level and down-regulated TNFα at the protein and transcript levels compared with stimulations by the S 7565 and Hu 6. MDMs infected with Hu 6 showed a down regulatory pattern of IL- 10 and TNFα compared to stimulations by S 7565. Cells stimulated with B 1018 and Hu 6 had low levels of matrix metalloprotease- 3 (MMP 3) {{and high levels of}} tissue inhibitor of metalloprotease- 1 (TIMP 1) at 96 -hr PI relative to MDMs stimulated by S 7565. Conclusion Taken together, results suggest that the bovine (B 1018) and the human (Hu 6) MAP isolates lead to anti-inflammatory and anti-invasive pathways in the macrophage environment whereas the <b>sheep</b> (<b>S</b> 7565) MAP isolate induces a pro-inflammatory pathway. Thus the infecting strain genotype {{may play a role in}} polarizing the host immune responses and dictate the clinicopathological outcomes in this economically important disease. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{objective}} of the current field {{study was to examine}} the effect of nitrogen (N) application (0 -N 0 and 150 kg ha- 1 year- 1 -N 150) and rotational grazing by cattle (C) and <b>sheep</b> (<b>S)</b> on grassland dry matter (DM) yield and botanical composition. A higher total DM yield was obtained under sheep grazing (P< 0. 05) than under cattle grazing, whereas grazing by cattle resulted in higher values of dead plant material compared to grazing by sheep (P< 0. 01). Application of 150 kg ha- 1 N resulted in 19. 2 % higher grassland DM yield in comparison with N 0 (P< 0. 01). Sheep grazing was less detrimental to legumes DM yield than was cattle grazing (P< 0. 05), whereas omission of N application (N 0) resulted in higher legumes DM yield and their contribution to total DM yield compared to N 150 (P< 0. 01). A grazing management x N rate interaction (P< 0. 05) was recorded for legumes DM yield and their contribution to total DM yield. Application of 150 kg ha- 1 N resulted in 29 % higher grasses DM yield and 9 % in higher grasses contribution to total DM yield in comparison with N 0 (P< 0. 01).

All of the pigmented isolates exhibited one of three distinct PFGE profiles with SnaBI, designated 9, 10, and 11, and with SpeI, designated 7, 8, and 9, which generated three multiplex profiles designated [9 - 7], [10 - 8], and [11 - 9]. All of the pigmented isolates had the same IS 900 -RFLP BstEII and PvuII profiles. The IS 900 -RFLP BstEII profile was new, but the IS 900 -RFLP PvuII profile corresponded to PvuII type 6 of a sheep strain described by Cousins and colleagues (D. V. Cousins, S. N. Williams, A.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of three types of rotational pasture: isolated (I – grazing only by <b>sheep),</b> simultaneous (<b>S</b> – simultaneous grazing by cattle and sheep) and alternated (A – granzing by cattle and then by sheep) on the structural and chemical traits of grass. Twelve crossbreed heifers, weighing initially 207 kg, 30 Santa Inês lambs, weighing 23 kg, and 16 adult ewes weighing 47 kg were used. The following parameters were determined on the pasture: forage mass available per grazing cycle (FMC); proportion of leaf (PF); stalk (PS); dead material (PDM), leaf:stalk ratio (L/S); levels of dry matter (DM); mineral matter (MM); crude protein (PB); ether extract (EE); neutral detergent fiber (NDF); acid detergent fiber (ADF); inorganic phosphorus (Pi) and total digestible nutrients (TDN). The S and I systems presented the smallest values for PS and NDF, while their values for L/S, CP, EE and TDN were higher than in A system. Therefore, the results showed that the grass offered to <b>sheep</b> in <b>S</b> and I systems had better quality than in the A system.

The genotype had no significant effect on most of the monitored growth parameters. The highest daily gain (DG) in the interval from birth to 100 days of age was found out in S 75 T 25 (327 g) but the highest DG from birth until the end of the experiment was found in S 50 T 50 (199 g). By contrast, the lowest DGs in both above mentioned intervals were found out in S 100 (265 and 147 g, respectively). With regards to basic carcass characteristics, the genotype had a significant effect only on proportion of kidney. The highest carcass yield (44. 80 %) was found in S 50 T 50 and the lowest (37. 66 %) in S 100. The best conformation score was found in S 75 T 25 (3. 18) and the lowest fatness score in S 50 T 50.

An experimental infection {{was conducted to}} establish the effect of Map strain on the pathogenesis of ovine paratuberculosis. Twenty-four out of thirty 1. 5 -month-old Assaf lambs were divided into 4 groups of 6 and infected orally with three low passage field isolates, two of S- (22 G and the pigmented Ovicap 49) and one of C– (764) type, and the reference K- 10 strain (C type). The remaining six animals were unchallenged controls. Animals were euthanized at 150 and 390 days post-infection (dpi). Throughout the experiment, the peripheral immune response was assessed and histological and molecular (PCR) studies were conducted on samples of intestine and related lymphoid tissue. Specific antibody and IFN-γ production was significantly higher in animals infected with the C strains, while no consistent IFN- γ responses were observed in the S-type strain infected groups. A positive intradermal skin test response was detected in all infected groups. Lambs infected with S-type strains had granulomatous lesions restricted to the lymphoid tissue with no differences in the lesion intensity over time. In both C–type strain groups, lesions were more severe at 150 dpi while at 390 dpi lesions, characterized by well-demarcated granulomas with fibrosis, decreased in severity.

40|$|Grasspea (Lathyrus sativus L.; guaya in Ethiopia and gilban in Sudan) {{has long}} been known as a source of forage for animals. It grows mainly in north and {{north-east}} Africa, southern Europe, the Middle East and South Asia. It is rich in protein (30 %), improves the quality of <b>sheep</b> <b>s</b> wool, fixes nitrogen in the soil and is very drought resistant. Both foliage and seeds are used for forage and the latter also for human consumption. But the plant contains a neurotoxin which paralyses leg muscles in humans if eaten as a main source of food for more than 3 months. It is harmless for animals and less harmful for humans when eaten in small quantities and accompanied by vitamin A-rich green vegetables. Especially in times of drought, when the beans are the only source of food for many people in Ethiopia, India and Sudan, the irreversible disease (neurolathyrism, named after the plant) takes its toll. Researchers working at the International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA) harvested the first grasspea lines with low neurotoxin levels during trials in 2002. Four new lines resulted from a breeding programme, crossing low toxin Lathyrus varieties from the Middle East with varieties from Asia and Africa that contain higher levels of neurotoxin. Ethiopian researchers have now started developing locally adapted lines and seed production programmes.

It grows mainly in north and north-east Africa, southern Europe, the Middle East and South Asia. It is rich in protein [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Brucellosis {{has been}} {{recognized}} as a highly contagious disease of man and animals since Bruce discovered the cause of Malta fever (Br. melitensis) in 1887. Br. abortus was found to cause abortion in cattle twenty years later by Bang. Another species, Br. suis, was isolated from aborted swine fetuses by Traum in 1914. Brucellosis is now known to have a worldwide distribution, occurring {{in a variety of}} domestic species, sucha <b>s</b> <b>sheep,</b> goats, horses and dogs, as well as several wild animals...|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} gangliosides were {{isolated}} from cat and sheep erythrocytes {{for use in}} analyzing the specificity of a panel of human anti-heterophile monoclonal nti-bodies. The structures of these compounds were deter-mined {{by a combination of}} different procedures, in-cluding sugar analysis, glycosidase treatment, period-ate oxidation, TLC immunostaining, methylation analysis, and mass spectrometry. These methods iden-tified the cat erythrocytes gangliosides (C 1 and C 2) as N-glycolylneuraminic acid (NeuGc) -containing hema-tosides; C 1 was shown to be NeuGca 24 NeuGca 2 + 3 GalB 1 + 4 Glc-Cer ((N ~ u G c) & ~ ~) and C 2 to be NeuAca 2 + 8 NeuGca 2 + 3 GalBl+ 4 Glc-Cer ((NeuAc-NeuGc-) GD 3). The two <b>sheep</b> gangliosides (<b>S</b> 1 and S 2) were found to be novel glycolipids based on the par-agloboside sequence; S 1 was identified as NeuGca 2...|$|R
40|$|The {{number of}} total {{disulfide}} bonds in rabbit and <b>sheep</b> 7 <b>S</b> gamma globulin, {{before and after}} treatment with 2 -mercaptoethanol, has been measured by amperometric titration. Mercaptan reduction could diminish the complement-fixing efficiency of 7 S rabbit gamma globulin {{by no more than}} 90 per cent without any significant decrease in maximal complement-fixing ability. This was associated with the reduction of only 7 disulfide bonds, including 1 interchain disulfide bond [S—S(1) ]. The reduction of 7 disulfide bonds in 7 <b>S</b> <b>sheep</b> gamma globulin was associated with a 64 per cent decrease in complement-fixing efficiency, while reduction of 10 to 11 disulfide bonds decreased the complement-fixing efficiency by 90 per cent. Reduction of more disulfide bonds was not associated with any further decrease in complement-fixing efficiency, nor of any decrease in maximal complement-fixing ability. The reduction of more than 10 to 11 disulfide bonds in 7 <b>S</b> rabbit and <b>sheep</b> gamma globulins was associated with a decrease in precipitating ability. The disulfide bonds which are more labile to mercaptan reduction appear to be associated with complement-fixing efficiency while the disulfide bonds which are more resistant to mercaptan reduction appear to be associated with precipitating ability. The measurement of interpolypeptide chain disulfide bonds has been discussed. One easily reduced interchain disulfide bond [S—S(1) ] appears to be important for the complement-fixing efficiency of 7 S rabbit antibody. The integrity of this same bond is essential for the precipitating ability of 5 S rabbit antibody and may also be important for its complement-fixing ability...|$|R
