40|$|Lack {{of proper}} {{sanitation}} {{is linked to}} significant negative impacts on environmental and public health, economy, and human dignity. Despite the efforts made to reach the United Nations Millennium Development Goals, the world will miss its target of halving {{the percentage of people}} without access to improved sanitation by 2015; and there is general agreement within the field of sanitation that the sector has failed to deliver substantial improvements to the most needy. This global challenge of providing sanitation services to the underserved highlights the need to critically evaluate and change the way in which <b>sanitation</b> <b>planning</b> and service provision is approached. The overall objective of this thesis is to better understand the planning processes used in the field of sanitation and their importance for the sustainability of sanitation efforts. To achieve this, it attempts to bridge the professions of urban planners and sanitation engineers. Specifically it explores how <b>sanitation</b> <b>planning</b> processes are structured, to what extent participation plays a role in <b>sanitation</b> <b>planning,</b> and to what extent different perspectives of criteria for sustainable sanitation appear in the process. In order to unpack the planning process into these different elements this thesis develops an analytical framework (the SanPlan Scan) based on a mixture of theory and practice from planning and sanitary engineering. The performance of this framework is subsequently tested for its ability to identify interesting trends in participation levels, procedural planning modes, and criteria for sustainability in a number of case studies from sanitation projects in West Africa and popular <b>sanitation</b> <b>planning</b> guidelines. The resulting analyses identify critical differences between <b>sanitation</b> <b>planning</b> guidelines and practice in the field. For example, the guidelines consistently recommend more collaborative and participatory planning styles, especially including users, than was seen in the cases studied. The results also show that the process of designing sanitation options, and to some degree the selection process, remained dominated by expert-led planning styles, despite the abundance of rhetoric regarding the need for participation. The main conclusion that can be drawn from the multiple studies within this thesis is that more attention is needed to how the planning process itself is designed and conducted. This thesis supports the development of systematically adapted <b>sanitation</b> <b>planning</b> processes, by providing a starting point for discussing and understanding the practice of <b>sanitation</b> <b>planning...</b>|$|R

Drawing upon primary field research in Dakar, this paper presents a citywide <b>sanitation</b> <b>planning</b> framework that combines existing <b>sanitation</b> <b>planning</b> approaches with householders’ investment logic as a function of their tenure security and status.

The paper offers an approach for policymakers and practitioners to narrow the decision-making process for citywide sanitation service provision. It aims to target urban sanitation interventions that are appropriate to the urban tenure mix, including non-networked systems, and a greater emphasis on widening the scope of sanitation service provision to include tenure-neutral operational activities, such as faecal sludge management...|$|R
