40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of analytical studies in order to evaluate effects of viscous damping on inelastic earthquake response on the case in which damping ratio and type of viscous damping are made to change in the steel moment frame. And, the damping coefficient increase by the installation of hysteresis damper in steel moment frame when damping ratio dose not change. The authors examined the response analysis result when the <b>stiffeness</b> of hysteretic damper is not considered. The effect of viscous damping are described by using maximum story drift angles...|$|E
40|$|A {{cohort of}} 87 SLE female {{patients}} underwent non-invasive assessments (e. g., vascular ultrasound, pulse wave analysis with applanation tonometry and echocardiography with TDI). In addition, disease activity, organ damage and SLE-related lab markers were also evaluated. Forty female healthy subjects were included as normal control. In summary, pulse wave analysis and tissue Doppler imaging are sensitive and accurate to detect premature atherosclerosis and subclinical myocardial dysfunction. The current study demonstrated a close correlation of inflammatory burden (disease activity and organ damage) to premature atherosclerosis and subclinical myocardial dysfunction, which may implicate {{the importance of}} routinely monitoring and early treatment to attenuate cardiovascular involvement. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), an autoimmune-inflammatory disease, results in multi-organ damage of the body. Compared to Caucasian, Chinese in Hong Kong have high prevalence of SLE. Cardiovascular diseases are common manifestations of SLE, which have emerged {{to be one of}} main causes of mortality. Detection of premature atherosclerosis, arterial stiffening and subclinical myocardial impairment early {{in the course of the}} disease is important as there may be a role of early therapeutic intervention in these patients that might translate into better clinical outcomes. In this regard, newer non-invasive methods, such as, pulse wave analysis and tissue Doppler imaging (TDI), have gained clinical popularity due to their accurate, reliable and reproducible measurements for the early detection of subclinical cardiovascular complications. The main findings were as follows: (1) Increased arterial stiffness and premature atherosclerosis were demonstrated in SLE patients with mild disease and a low prevalence of end-organ damage and SLE itself was an independent risk factor of early atherosclerosis; (2) The abnormal vascular parameters correlated with disease activity; (3) SLE patients without overt cardiovascular involvement still have abnormal diastolic function with or without elevated LV filling pressure identified by a ratio of mitral Doppler inflow velocity to lateral annulus velocity (lateral E/E'> 10) on pulse-wave and tissue Doppler echocardiography; (4) Both pulmonary artery hypertension and organ-damage were the independent predictors of elevated LV filling pressure alter adjustment of traditional risk factors, with the former adding incremental predictive value to the latter; (5) There was evidence of subclinical LV systolic dysfunction in patients with SLE even when LV ejection fraction appeared to be normal; (6) The independent determinants of subclinical LV systolic dysfunction included long disease duration of > 10 years, active disease, reduced total arterial compliance as well as abnormal mid-wall fractional shortening, and the assessment of these factors provided incremental predictive value. This thesis applied the above non-invasive methods to SLE subjects with the following aims: (1) To ascertain whether there is evidence of preclinical atherosclerosis (as indicated by carotid intima-media thickness), and/or increased arterial <b>stiffeness</b> (as reflected by direct and indirect surrogate parameters, including pulse wave velocity, augmentation index and ankle-brachial index) in SLE; (2) To investigate the relationships of these noninvasive vascular parameters to inflammatory disease burden in terms of SLE disease activity and organ damage; (3) To assess whether there is evidence of subclinical myocardial diastolic dysfunction; (4) To determine the associations between various clinical and echocardiographic parameters, including presence of pulmonary arterial hypertension, SLE-related clinical data, and elevated LV filling pressure; (5) To detect whether there is evidence of subclinical myocardial systolic dysfunction by tissue Doppler echocardiography; (6) To determine various clinical and echocardiographic parameters in predicting subclinical LV longitudinal-axis systolic function.
