5000|$|Biscuits {{today can}} be savoury or sweet, {{but most are}} small at around 5 cm in diameter, and flat. The term biscuit also applies to sandwich-type biscuits, wherein a layer of [...] "creme" [...] or icing is {{sandwiched}} between two biscuits, such as the custard cream, or a layer of jam (as in biscuits which, in the United Kingdom, are known as [...] "Jammie Dodgers")Sweet biscuits are commonly eaten as a snack food, and are, in general, made with wheat flour or oats, and sweetened with sugar or honey. Varieties may contain chocolate, fruit, jam, nuts, ginger, or even be used to <b>sandwich</b> other <b>fillings.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A {{sandwich}} loaf is a stacked party entrée {{that looks}} like a cake. While rare today, the food was quite popular during the mid 20th century in the United States. To create a sandwich loaf, bread is cut horizontally and spread with layers of filling. Common fillings include egg salad, chicken salad, ham salad, tuna salad, and Cheez Whiz, but other fillings are possible, including peanut butter and jelly and mock egg salad made from tofu [...] In a simple <b>sandwich</b> loaf the <b>fillings</b> may all be the same, but in more complex creations each layer is different.|$|R

In June 2011, Deli Choices, {{a line of}} <b>sandwich</b> rolls with <b>fillings,</b> was released in the UK. Curry flavoured sauce is available for McNuggets in British and Irish restaurants. From 2003 to 2005, menus included the Quorn Premiere, a vegetarian burger with sweet chilli sauce, light Hellmann's mayonnaise, tomato, and lettuce in a focaccia bun. In 2015, McDonald's released a limited edition burger in the Republic of Ireland called the McMór. In 2016, this burger was brought back for six weeks. It features Ballymaloe Relish, Charleville cheddar and a potato bun. In 2016, McDonald's launched the brand new BBQ Smokehouse Range of burgers. The two burgers that were launched contained chicken and beef with bacon, cheese and BBQ Sauce.|$|R

The business has pledged that all in season potatoes, carrots, cabbage, swede, onions, parsnips and lamb will be British by 2018.|$|E
50|$|The first chilled {{foods in}} the 1960s were sliced meats and pies. By the next decade, {{household}} refrigerators were stocked with salad dressings and dairy desserts. In the 1980s, TV dinners, quiches, flans, sandwiches, pizzas, ethnic snacks, pastas, and soups were kept chilled. Nondairy desserts, <b>sandwich</b> <b>fillings,</b> dips, sauces, stocks, prepared fruit and vegetables, and leafy salads were commonly chilled in the 1990s, and speciality breads, condiments, sushi, and meal kits were typical by the 2000s (decade).|$|E
5000|$|Fillings are light, and are [...] "dainty" [...] or [...] "delicate" [...] in {{proportion}} to the amount of bread. Spreads might include butter, cream cheese or mayonnaise mixtures, and the sandwiches often feature fresh vegetables such as radishes, olives, cucumber, asparagus, or watercress. The cucumber tea sandwich in particular is considered the quintessential tea sandwich. Other popular tea <b>sandwich</b> <b>fillings</b> include tomatoes, pimento cheese, ham with mustard, smoked salmon, fruit jam, curried chicken, fish paste, and egg salad.|$|E
5000|$|The Spanish {{and later}} the French {{introduced}} a variety of wheat breads which have been adapted {{into a variety of}} street foods. Tortas are rolls with are cut to make thick <b>sandwiches</b> with various <b>fillings.</b> These include refried beans, cheese, various hot meats such as breaded chicken or pork, carnitas, egg and more or with cold cuts, along with avocado, onions and pickled jalapeños. [...] In Puebla, a similar sandwich is called a cemita, named after the style of bread used to make it. Molotes are a type of torta, bread with a filing and salsa which varies by region. In Hidalgo, they are cylindrical filled with chicken, cheese or beef. In Oaxaca, they are filled with chorizo sausage and potatoes and in Tlaxcala, they are shaped like a pointed oval. Pambazos are small tortas filled with various ingredients, with salsa covering the filling (in Veracruz) or coating the bread (in Mexico City). In the Yucatán, small tortas are called salbutes which are heated on comals, filled with tomatoes, cabbage, onions and meat. Another European derived dish is the empanada, which are flour or sometimes corn flour turnovers that enclose a filling and baked. In Hidalgo, they are called “pastes” after the English word “pasty.” ...|$|R
50|$|Left-over {{food from}} the Sunday roast has {{traditionally}} {{formed the basis of}} meals served on other days of the week. For example, meats might be used as <b>sandwich</b> <b>fillings,</b> roast beef may be chopped up with leftover roasted potatoes and some additional onion and then fried in a pan with a bit of oil and desired seasonings until somewhat crispy to make roast beef hash, lamb might be used in the filling for a shepherd's pie, and vegetables might form the basis for bubble and squeak.|$|E
5000|$|Likely {{even more}} {{important}} are differences with respect to what is eaten {{on top of a}} Butterbrot or in a sandwich. Although exceptions exist, a Butterbrot is commonly not expanded the way sandwiches are. One slice of cheese and one or (in case of thin slices) maybe two slices of cold meat are commonly considered sufficient; adding lettuce, tomato, pickles, onions, mustard, mayonnaise etc. happens only following individual preferences. Also the ratio of bread and [...] "topping" [...] is relatively constant, thick fancy <b>sandwich</b> <b>fillings</b> have almost no equivalent for the Butterbrot.|$|E
50|$|Subway {{sandwich}} bars {{provide an}} excellent example of how a business can integrate both process design and the servicescape into the customer's in-store experience. Like many fast food restaurants, Subway utilises a race to corral customers and move them in a one-way direction. Prominently displayed 'In' and 'Out' signage reinforces the direction of the desired traffic flow. Customers can peruse an overhead backlit menu while they are waiting in line which speeds up the order-taking process and reduces opportunities for bottlenecks. Other signage provides customers with information about the Subway process e.g. select bread, select filling, select sauce, pay and exit. The arrangement of food behind the glass counter not only displays the choice of <b>sandwich</b> <b>fillings,</b> but supports the process since customers must select their preferences in a specific sequence, as they inch their way towards the cash register. In Australia, the distinctive moves used by Subway customers as they shuffle along the race, selecting their sandwich breads and fillings has become affectionately known as the ‘Subway shuffle'. Every aspect of Subway's store design and layout reinforces the core objectives of customisation, volume-operations (i.e. rapid turnover) and operational efficiency.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background In {{addition}} to helping consumers make healthier food choices, front-of-pack nutrition labels could encourage companies to reformulate existing products and develop new ones with a healthier product composition. This {{is the largest}} study to date to investigate {{the effect of a}} nutrition logo on the development of healthier products by food manufacturers. Methods A total of 47 food manufacturers joining the Choices Foundation in the Netherlands (response: 39. 5 %) indicated whether their Choices products were newly developed, reformulated or already complied with the Choices criteria and provided nutrient composition data for their products (n = 821; 23. 5 % of the available Choices products in August 2009). Results Most products carrying the logo as a result of reformulation and new product development were soups and snacks. Sodium reduction was the most common change found in processed meats, sandwiches, soups and <b>sandwich</b> <b>fillings.</b> Dietary fiber was significantly increased in most newly developed Choices product groups; for example, in fruit juices, processed meats, dairy products, sandwiches and soups. Saturated fatty acids (SAFA) and added sugar were significantly decreased both in reformulated and newly developed dairy products. Caloric content was significantly decreased only in reformulated dairy products, <b>sandwich</b> <b>fillings</b> and in some newly developed snacks. Conclusions The results indicate that the Choices logo has motivated food manufacturers to reformulate existing products and develop new products with a healthier product composition, especially where sodium and dietary fiber are concerned. </p...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Childhood {{obesity is}} rising and dietary intake is a {{potentially}} modifiable factor that {{plays an important}} role in its development. We aim to investigate the association between dietary patterns, obtained through principal components analysis and gains in fat and lean mass in childhood. Design: Diet diaries at 10 years of age collected from children taking part in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. Body composition was assessed using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry at 9 and 11. Setting: Longitudinal birth cohort. Subjects: 3911 children with complete data. Results: There was an association between the Health Aware (positive loadings on high-fiber bread, and fruits and vegetables; negative loadings on chips, crisps, processed meat, and soft drinks) pattern score and decreased fat mass gain in girls. After adjusting for confounders, an increase of 1 standard deviation (sd) in this score led to an estimated 1. 2 % decrease in fat mass gain in valid-reporters and 2. 1 % in under-reporters. A similar decrease was found only in under-reporting boys. There was also an association between the Packed Lunch (high consumption of white bread, <b>sandwich</b> <b>fillings,</b> and snacks) pattern score and decreased fat mass gain (1. 1 % per sd) in valid-reporting but not under-reporting girls. The main association with lean mass gai...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} salt {{intensity}} on ad libitum intake of tomato soup was investigated when soup was {{served as a}} first course and as a second course. Also the effect of salt intensity in soup on subsequent sweet vs. savory choice of <b>sandwich</b> <b>fillings</b> was investigated. Forty-three healthy subjects consumed ad libitum a low-salt (LS), ideal-salt (IS) and high-salt (HS) tomato soup in both meal settings. The salt concentrations were selected on an individual basis, {{in a way that}} IS was most pleasant and LS and HS were similar in pleasantness. The ad libitum intake of IS soup was higher than that of LS and HS soup, and the ad libitum intake of LS soup was higher than that of HS soup. The meal setting, soup as a first or as a second course, did not affect ad libitum intake. Salt intensity in soup did not predict sweet vs. savory choice of fillings in grams or energy, although most sodium from fillings was consumed after intake of HS soup. In conclusion, a higher salt intensity lead to lower ad libitum intake of soup similar in palatability (LS vs. HS). In addition, salt intensity in soup does not predict sweet vs. savory food choice...|$|E
40|$|Studies {{of product}} {{positioning}} often use perceptual mapping techniques {{to study the}} cognitive dimensions that lie at the basis of product perception. As the metric assumptions at the basis of dimensional geometric presentations may be doubtful, perceptual analysis models based on qualitative features rather than quantitive dimensions are a useful alternative to consider. In the present paper we describe a latent class extension of a non-compensatory probabilistic feature-based model {{which can be used}} to model binary product-attribute associations on the basis of binary latent features, as well as to model differences in product perception among consumer segments. A fully Bayesian approach involving the computation of a sample of the posterior distribution is used for parameter estimation. Moreover, specific model checks are proposed to evaluate the fit of the model with posterior predictive checks. As an illustration, the models are applied to explain associations between <b>sandwich</b> <b>fillings</b> and filling characteristics on the basis of latent features. The results of the analysis indicate that models with consumer differences clearly fitted the data better than models without consumer differences. Moreover, the extracted features are meaningful and the identified consumer differences yield interesting insights with respect to differences in product perception. In particular, segments turn out to differ in the way they discriminate between products {{on the basis of a}} certain latent feature, such as whether fillings are 'healthy' and 'pure', or whether they are 'caloric', 'salty' and 'fat'. ...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{current study}} {{examined}} clustering of dietary intake and activity behaviours (i. e. physical activity (PA) and sedentary behaviour) in 5 -year-old children, {{as well as}} the longitudinal association with BMI and overweight development. DESIGN: Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to identify behavioural patterns. Backward regression analyses were used to examine the association of behavioural patterns with parent and child background characteristics, {{as well as the}} association of the patterns with BMI Z-score and overweight development up to ages 7 and 8 years. SETTING: The Netherlands. SUBJECTS: Data originated from the KOALA Birth Cohort Study (n 2074 at age 5 years). RESULTS: Four patterns emerged: a 'sedentary-snacking' pattern (including television viewing and snack consumption), a 'healthy intake' pattern (including healthy items such as fruit, vegetables and fish), a 'sandwich' pattern (including bread and <b>sandwich</b> <b>fillings)</b> and a 'sporty-traditional meal' pattern (including sports, meat and potatoes). The patterns were related to child gender, general appetite and various parental characteristics. The sedentary-snacking pattern was positively associated with longitudinal BMI development. CONCLUSIONS: Cross-behavioural energy balance-related behavioural patterns exist at age 5 years. Different activity types (e. g. sports, television viewing) clustered differently with the behavioural patterns, indicating the need to incorporate these different types instead of one general PA measure in energy balance-related pattern analyses. The clustering and potential synergy between activity behaviours and dietary intake, as well as the associations with weight status development, stress the importance of an integrated approach to PA and healthy nutrition promotion in preventing childhood overweight...|$|E
40|$|Information on foods {{patients}} like and dislike {{is the essential}} basis for planning menus which are acceptable to patients and promote adequate consumption. The {{aim of this study}} was to obtain quantitative data on the food preferences of inpatients at a large metropolitan public hospital for use in menu planning. Methodology was based on a study by Williams et al (1988), and included additional questions about appetite and taste changes. The survey used a 9 point hedonic scale to rate foods listed in random order and was modified to incorporate more contemporary foods than those used in the originalWilliams study. Surveys were conducted by final year University of Queensland dietetics students on Food Service Practicum at the Royal Brisbane and Women’s Hospital (929 beds) in 2012. The first survey (220 questions, n = 157) had a response rate of 61 %. The second included more <b>sandwich</b> <b>fillings</b> and salads (231 questions, n = 219, response rate 67 %). Total number surveyed was 376. Results showed the most preferred foods were roast potato, grilled steak, ice cream, fresh strawberries, roast lamb, roast beef, grapes and banana. The least preferred foods were grapefruit, soybeans, lentils, sardines, prune juice and grapefruit juice. Patients who reported taste changes (10 %) had similar food preferences to those who didn’t report taste changes. Patients who reported poor/very poor appetite (10 %) generally scored foods lower than those who reported OK (22 %), good/very good appetite (65 %).

40|$|Bread {{is a major}} {{contributor}} to sodium intake in many countries. Reducing the salt (NaCl) content in bread might be an effective way to reduce overall sodium intake. The objectives of this study were {{to examine the effects of}} gradually lowering the salt content in brown bread, with and without flavor compensation (KCI and yeast extract), on bread consumption and sodium intake compensation by choice of <b>sandwich</b> <b>fillings.</b> A total of 116 participants (age: 21 +/- 3 y; BMI: 22 +/- 2 kg/m(2)) consumed a buffet-style breakfast on weekdays for 4 wk. Participants received either regular bread (control group: n = 39), bread whose salt content was gradually lowered each week by 0, 31, 52, and 67 % (reduced group: n = 38), or bread whose salt content was also gradually lowered each week but which was also flavor compensated (compensated group: n = 39). A reduction of up to 52 % of salt in bread did not lead to lower consumption of bread compared to the control (P = 0. 57), whereas less bread was consumed when salt was reduced by 67 % (P = 0. 006). When bread was flavor compensated, however, a reduction of 67 % did not lead to lower consumption (P = 0. 69). Salt reduction in bread (with and without flavor compensation) did not induce sodium intake compensation (P = 0. 31). In conclusion, a salt reduction of up to 52 % in bread or even up to 67 % in flavor-compensated bread neither affected bread consumption nor choice of sandwich filling...|$|E
40|$|Little {{is known}} about changes in dietary {{patterns}} over time. The present study aims to derive dietary patterns using cluster analysis at three ages in children and track these patterns over time. In all, 3 d diet diaries were completed for children from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children at 7, 10 and 13 years. Children were grouped based on the similarities between average weight consumed (g/d) of sixty-two food groups using k-means cluster analysis. A total of four clusters were obtained at each age, with very similar patterns being described at each time point: Processed (high consumption of processed foods, chips and soft drinks), Healthy (high consumption of high-fibre bread, fruit, vegetables and water), Traditional (high consumption of meat, potatoes and vegetables) and Packed Lunch (high consumption of white bread, <b>sandwich</b> <b>fillings</b> and snacks). The number of children remaining in the same cluster at different ages was reasonably high: 50 and 43 % {{of children in the}} Healthy and Processed clusters, respectively, at age 7 years were in the same clusters at age 13 years. Maternal education was the strongest predictor of remaining in the Healthy cluster at each time point – children whose mothers had the highest level of education were nine times more likely to remain in that cluster compared to those with the lowest. Cluster analysis provides a simple way of examining changes in dietary patterns over time, and similar underlying patterns of diet at two ages during late childhood, that persisted through to early adolescence...|$|E
40|$|A key task of {{strategic}} marketing is {{to study the}} competitive structure of products. This type of analysis is most often based on a spatial configuration of the products or on a categorization of the products. Besides information on the similarity of products, an important goal of competitive structure analysis is to investigate to what extent distinct customer segments prefer a specific group of products, or whether {{the perception of the}} products depends on customer segments(DeSarbo, Grewal & Scott, 2008). Candel and Maris (1997) use a probabilistic feature model to categorize products on the basis of binary latent features. However, in this analysis no customer differences are taken into account. To solve this problem we develop a mixture of probabilistic feature models in which the categorization of the products in terms of latent features may differ across customer segments. A related but distinct approach for modelling rater differences was presented by Meulders, De Boeck, Kuppens and Van Mechelen (2002). A Gibbs sampling algorithm is used to compute a sample of the observed posterior distribution of the model. In addition, posterior predictive simulations are used to evaluate to what extent the model is able to capture observed differences in product perception. As an illustration, the model is used to analyze binary judgments of 191 first-year psychology students who indicated for 25 types of <b>sandwich</b> <b>fillings</b> and 14 fillings characteristics whether or not a certain sandwich filling has a certain characteristic.
