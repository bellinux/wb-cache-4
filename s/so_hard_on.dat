25|$|The {{first episode}} of Chef! was {{developed}} over two years, and so Peter Tilbury and I were really put through loads of hoops about character motivation. Why is this character such an arsehole? Is this {{the right kind}} of character for Lenny Henry to be playing? All that kind of stuff. Once we got through that and they greenlit the series, Peter then had something like eight or nine weeks to write the rest of it. The remaining five episodes were much easier to write because we'd had every argument about who, what, where, and how. The world had been mapped out. Actually, the very first episode of Chef! was the hardest one to watch for me because we'd worked <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> <b>on</b> it and you could see all the things that had been rewritten in the first episode.|$|E
25|$|Years {{go by and}} Rudolph {{has grown}} into adulthood. Returning home, he finds that his parents and Clarice {{have been looking for}} him for months. He sets out once again to find them, only to {{discover}} that they have been kidnapped by the Abominable Snow Monster. Rudolph tries to save Clarice from being eaten, but the monster hits him {{in the head with a}} stalactite, dazing him. Later, Hermey and Yukon return to Christmastown and go to save Rudolph. Hermey, oinking like a pig, lures the monster out of his cave and Yukon drops rocks on his head to knock him out. Hermey then pulls out all the monster's teeth. Realizing that the Abominable is now defenseless, Yukon drives the toothless monster back, only to fall over the cliff with all his pack dogs. Mourning Yukon's death, Rudolph, Hermey, Clarice, and the Donners return home where everyone apologizes to them. After hearing their story, Santa welcomes the group back to Christmastown, promises that he'll find homes for the Misfit Toys, Hermey opens his own dentist's office, and Donner apologizes for being <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> <b>on</b> Rudolph. Yukon then returns with a reformed Abominable Snow Monster whom he hired to be a tree decorator. Christmas Eve comes and while everybody's celebrating, Santa fears that he'll have to cancel Christmas if the storm doesn't let up. Santa is soon distracted by Rudolph's red nose and realizes that it's light could cut through the storm. He asks Rudolph to lead the sleigh and Rudolph agrees. The team then flies off to the island where the Misfit Toys to pick them up. The special ends with Santa wishing the viewers a merry Christmas as he and Rudolph fly off into the night.|$|E

500|$|The {{song was}} written by Stan herself, Șerban Cazan, LeAnna James, and Naz Tokio; the {{production}} was made by Cazan. It was composed during FonoCamp 2013, the first international songwriting camp in Romania which was organized by both Fonogram and HaHaHa Studios and held in Azuga. Fellow Romanian and international singers were also present at the two-weeks event, such as Delia Matache, Mohombi, Smiley and Deepcentral. The track was mixed for HaHaHa Production and recorded at Fonogram Studios and HaHaHa Studios. In an interview in Barcelona, Spain, Stan described the song as [...] "more oriental, {{with a lot of}} spiritual meaning". She continued to explain that [...] "Give Me Your Everything" [...] was written as a present for her Arabic and Asian fans due to the song's vibe. According to Pop Shock, the track is a Caucasian-flavoured mid-tempo ballad. Lyrically, Stan tells her unidentified boyfriend not to be <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> <b>on</b> her, and if he really loves her, he needs to give her his everything. The chorus of [...] "Give Me Your Everything" [...] consists solely of the phrase [...] "Don't you be <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> <b>on</b> me / If you love me, come and give me your everything".|$|E

500|$|The {{two parts}} of [...] "Stress Relief" [...] ran an hour long (including commercials), {{compared}} to the typical half-hour length of most The Office episodes. Since {{the end of the}} second season, the series had begun occasionally showing longer episodes (which they dubbed [...] "super-sized") on special occasions. Unlike other episodes of The Office, [...] "Stress Relief" [...] included an extended main title sequence that included the names and images of the entire supporting cast of the series, in order to afford them recognition in anticipation of the high post-Super Bowl viewership. The opening scene, in which the characters frantically scramble to escape the Dunder Mifflin office due to what they believe is a fire, took about a day-and-a-half to shoot. It took much longer than the average 45 minutes of shooting time for a scene of that length due to the amount of stunt work involved. Due to the pressure of following the Super Bowl, actress Jenna Fischer said, [...] "I don't think we've ever worked <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> <b>on</b> an episode in the history of our show." [...] The Office actor and writer B. J. Novak, who did not appear in [...] "Stress Relief", said of the episode, [...] "It's awesome. After this airs, people are going to refer to the Super Bowl as the Pre-Office Football Spectacular." ...|$|E
500|$|Fellini was {{a notorious}} perfectionist, {{and this could}} be trying for his cast. At an American Film Institute student seminar, Quinn spoke of Fellini's intransigence over {{selecting}} a box in which Zampanò carries his cigarette butts, scrutinizing over 500 boxes before finding just the right one: [...] "As for me, any of the boxes would have been satisfactory to carry the butts in, but not Federico". Quinn also recalled being particularly proud of a certain scene in which his performance had earned applause from onlookers on the set, only to receive {{a phone call from}} Fellini late that night informing him {{that they would have to}} re-do the entire sequence because Quinn had been too good: [...] "You see, you're supposed to be a bad, a terrible actor, but the people watching applauded you. They should have laughed at you. So in the morning we do it again." [...] As for Masina, Fellini insisted that she re-create the thin-lipped smile he had seen in her childhood photographs. He cut her hair by putting a bowl on her head and shearing off anything that wasn't covered up, afterwards plastering what remained with soap to give it a [...] "spiky, untidy look", then [...] "flicked talc into her face to give it the pallor of a kabuki performer." [...] He made her wear a World War I surplus cloak that was so frayed its collar cut into her neck. She complained: [...] "You're so nice and sweet to the others in the cast.

500|$|On {{the day of}} broadcast, The Mirror {{reported}} that EastEnders producers may have to re-write the episode or run a pre-recorded rehearsal tape rather than {{go ahead with the}} live transmission, as Turner was suffering from the flu and was unable to speak. In the event, Turner recovered enough to appear, though was given permission to whisper her lines if necessary. She was able to deliver her dialogue as planned, however was too ill to appear on EastEnders Live: The Aftermath following the episode. Turner commented that nothing could have stopped her from appearing in the episode, as the cast had worked <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> <b>on</b> it, and it was [...] "such a big part of TV history". Several errors were made during the transmission. Barbara Windsor as Peggy incorrectly called Janine [...] "June" [...] and Maslen stumbled over several of his lines. During the final scene, a camera was visibly jostled, sound became muffled and some zoom shots [...] "misfired". Following Bradley's fall, Wood was observed inserting his fingers into his throat to help him retch. The script called for Wood to be sick, though there was not enough time for him to put the liquid into his mouth, and he stated that a person would put their fingers into their throat anyway, [...] "to get it all out".

2500|$|In late 1895, to {{help improve}} his {{depleting}} finances, Rachmaninoff agreed to a three-month concert tour across Russia with a program shared by Teresina Tua, an Italian violinist. He did not enjoy the experience, and quit the tour early while sacrificing his performance fees which caused him to pawn his watch {{given to him by}} Zverev. In September 1895, before the tour started, Rachmaninoff completed his Symphony No. 1 (Op.13), a work conceived in January based on chants heard in Russian Orthodox church services. He worked <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> <b>on</b> the piece, he could not settle himself into composing again until he heard the piece performed. However, Rachmaninoff had to resume work in October 1896 in order to recoup his losses after [...] "a rather large sum of money" [...] that was not his, was stolen during a train journey. Among these were included Six Choruses for Women's or Children's Voices (Op. 15) and Moments Musicaux (Op. 16), his final completed composition for several months.|$|E
2500|$|Rabbi Levi {{taught that}} God told Moses [...] "enough!" [...] in [...] to repay Moses measure for measure for when Moses told Korah [...] "enough!"

The Gemara provided a third explanation of the word [...] "enough!": God was telling Moses not to petition him anymore, so that people should not say: [...] "How severe is the Master, and how persistent is the student." [...] The Gemara explained why God was <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> <b>on</b> Moses with a Baraita taught in the School of Rabbi Ishmael: according to the camel is the burden; that is, a stronger, more righteous one must bear a greater burden.|$|E
2500|$|Despite his esteem in {{the writing}} community, Serling found the series {{difficult}} to sell. Few critics felt that science fiction could transcend empty escapism and enter the realm of adult drama. In a September 22, 1959, interview with Serling, Mike Wallace asked a question illustrative of the times: [...] "...ou're going to be, obviously, working <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> <b>on</b> The Twilight Zone that, in essence, {{for the time being}} and for the foreseeable future, you've given up on writing anything important for television, right?" [...] While Serling's appearances on the show became one of its most distinctive features, with his clipped delivery still widely imitated today, he was reportedly nervous about it and had to be persuaded to appear on camera. Serling often steps {{into the middle of the}} action while the characters remain oblivious to him, but on one notable occasion, they are aware of his presence: In the episode [...] "A World of His Own", a writer (Keenan Wynn) with the power to alter his reality objects to Serling's narration, and promptly erases Serling from the show.|$|E

2500|$|Mantle died on August 13, 1995, at Baylor University Medical Center {{with his}} wife at his side, five months after his mother had died at age 91. The Yankees played Cleveland that day and honored him with a tribute. At Mantle's funeral, Eddie Layton played [...] "Somewhere Over the Rainbow" [...] on the Hammond organ because Mickey had once {{told him it was}} his {{favorite}} song. Roy Clark sang and played [...] "Yesterday, When I Was Young." [...] The team played {{the rest of the season}} with black mourning bands topped by a small number 7 on their left sleeves. Mantle was interred in the Sparkman-Hillcrest Memorial Park Cemetery in Dallas. In eulogizing Mantle, sportscaster Bob Costas described him as [...] "a fragile hero to whom we had an emotional attachment so strong and lasting that it defied logic." [...] Costas added: [...] "In the last year of his life, Mickey Mantle, always <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> <b>on</b> himself, finally came to accept and appreciate the distinction between a role model and a hero. The first, he often was not. The second, he always will be. And, in the end, people got it." [...] Richardson did oblige in reading the poem at Mantle's funeral, something he described as being extremely difficult. The same poem (God's Hall of Fame) which originated from a baseball fan, was recited by Richardson for Roger Maris during Maris' funeral.|$|E
