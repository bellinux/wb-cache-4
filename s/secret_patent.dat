Some of the technical personnel remained at the Patent Office in Berlin, some went to Heringen and others were scattered throughout Germany. The Patent Office building in Berlin was about one-third destroyed by a heavy bombing attack on February 5, 1945. US and British representatives reached Heringen in May 1945 and found some 50 former patent employees at work restoring and re-classifying the patent indexes and examination material.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} dynamic {{interactions}} and the spillovers that exist among patent application intensity, secret innovation intensity and stock returns of a well-defined technological cluster of firms. We study the differential behavior {{when there is}} an Innovation Leader (IL) {{and the rest of the}} firms are Innovation Followers (IFs). The leader and the followers of the technological cluster are defined according to their patent innovation activity (stock of knowledge). We use data on stock returns and patent applications of a panel of technologically related firms of the United States (US) economy over the period 1979 to 2000. Most firms of the technological cluster are from the pharmaceutical-products industry. Interaction effects and spillovers are quantified by applying several Panel Vector Autoregressive (PVAR) market value models. Impulse Response Functions (IRFs) and dynamic interaction multipliers of the PVAR models are estimated. <b>Secret</b> <b>patent</b> innovations are estimated by using a recent Poisson-type patent count data model, which includes a set of dynamic latent variables. We show that firms’ stock returns, observable patent intensities and <b>secret</b> <b>patent</b> intensities have significant dynamic interaction effects for technologically related firms. The predictive absorptive capacity of the IL is the highest and this type of absorptive capacity is positively correlated with good firm performance measures. The innovation spillover effects that exist among firms, due to the imperfect appropriability of the returns of the investment in R&D, are specially important for secret innovations and less relevant for observed innovations. The flow of spillovers between followers and the leader is not symmetric being higher from the IL to the IFs.

40|$|The {{problem of}} legal {{protection}} {{of scientific research}} results is of growing interest nowadays. However, {{none of the three}} hitherto existing rights (the right for trade <b>secrets,</b> <b>patent</b> and copyright) is able to fully take into account the characteristics of scientific activities. In Russia, the problem of legal protection of scientific research results has been developed actively since the 50 -ies of the last century, in connection with the introduction of the system of state registration of scientific discoveries. A further concept allowed for not only the registration of discoveries, but also the entire array of scientific results. However, theoretical applicability of exclusive rights institutions in the sphere of science remained unstudied. The article describes a new system, which is not fixed in legislation and remains unnoticed by the vast majority of researchers. That is the institution of scientific and positional rights, focused on the recognition procedure of authorship, priority, and other characteristics of intellectual scientific results value. In case of complex intellectual results, comprising scientific results, the recognition of result-oriented exclusive rights proves to be unsustainable. This circumstance urges us to foreground the institution of scientific and positional exclusive rights. Its scope is budget science where non-fee published scientific results are generated. Any exclusive right to use open scientific results is out of the question. The sphere of open (budget) science is dominated by scientific and positional exclusive rights, sanctioned both by the state (S-sanctioned), the bodies of the scientific community (BSC-sanctioned) and scientific community (SC-sanctioned) rights...|$|R
