5|$|Black drongos {{become active}} very early {{at dawn and}} roost later than many other birds. They feed mainly on insects such as grasshoppers, cicadas, termites, wasps, bees, ants, moths, beetles and dragonflies. They {{sometimes}} fly close to tree branches, attempting to disturb any insects that may be present. They congregate in fields that are being ploughed, picking up exposed caterpillars and beetle grubs. As many as 35 birds have been seen at such congregations. They are also attracted to fires in scrub and grasslands habitats where insects are disturbed. They appear to avoid flies. They associate with common mynas, cattle egrets and other birds that share a similar diet and habitat. Drongos benefit from this association and are more successful in their foraging. There is only partial overlap in the insect prey sought by mynas and drongos although in rare instances the drongos may rob prey from mynas. It is said that they imitate {{the call of the}} <b>Shikra</b> so as to put mynas to flight and then to steal prey. Similar behaviour, using false alarm calls, has been noted in the fork-tailed drongo. There are some cases of the black drongo preying on small birds, reptiles, or maybe even bats. They have also been on occasion seen feeding on fish Flowers of trees such as Erythrina and Bombax may be visited for water and nectar and they are sometimes known to feed on grains. They are only rarely known to take larger arthropods such as scorpions and centipedes. They feed on milkweed butterflies that are often avoided by other predators and are known to feed late in the evening or night, often on insects attracted to artificial lights.|$|E

50|$|Like other {{some other}} raptors, lizard buzzards are {{alternative}} nest users. Although {{they prefer to}} build nests in the subcanopy, when they occupy an existing nest this can occur in the canopy above. Lizard buzzards will also compete with <b>Shikras</b> for available nests, since these have a similar size, habitat preference and distribution.|$|R

50|$|The Indian {{golden oriole}} is a partial migrant. It breeds in central Asia and the Indian subcontinent. The Indian populations are largely {{resident}} {{while the other}} populations are migratory. The breeding season is April to August, the nest being a small cup placed in a fork {{near the end of}} a branch. Nests are often built {{in the vicinity of the}} nest of a black drongo. Two or three white eggs with reddish, brown and black speckling form the typical clutch. Both parents take part in nest and brood care, defending the nest against intruding birds such as <b>shikras</b> and crows.|$|R
5000|$|Their {{calls are}} {{extremely}} varied and include monotonously repeated whistles, metallic and nasal sounds {{as well as}} more complex notes and imitations of other birds. They begin calling from as early as 4 am in moonlight often with a metallic tunk-tunk-tunk series. They have an ability to accurately mimic alarm calls of other birds that are learnt through interactions in mixed-species flocks. This is quite unusual, as avian vocal mimicry has hitherto been believed to be ignorant of the original context of the imitated vocalization. African grey parrots are known to use imitated human speech in correct context, but do not show this behavior in nature. This drongo's context-sensitive use of other species' alarm calls is thus analogous to a human learning useful short phrases and exclamations in a number of foreign languages. A special alarm note is raised in the presence of <b>shikras</b> that has been transcribed as a loud kwei-kwei-kwei...shee-cuckoo-sheecuckoo-sheecuckoo-why!. They have been said to imitate raptor calls so as to alarm other birds and steal prey from them in the ensuing panic. They are also known to imitate the calls of species (known sometimes even to fluff up and moving head and body like a jungle babbler) that typically are members of mixed-species flocks such as babblers and {{it has been suggested that}} this has a role in the formation of mixed-species flocks. In some places they have been found to be kleptoparasitic on others in mixed-species flock, particularly laughingthrushes but they are most often involved in mutualistic and commensal relations. Several observers have found this drongo associating with foraging woodpeckers and there is a report of one following a troop of macaques.|$|R
5000|$|Like babblers, {{these birds}} are usually seen {{in small groups}} of five to fifteen, {{especially}} in the non-breeding season. They are usually found inside bushes, emerging {{up to the top}} of a stem and then diving back into cover to forage. They feed mainly on insects but take berries (Lantana and Salvadora) as well as nectar. When capturing insects, they may hold them down with their feet. The group constantly produces a series of cheeping or churring calls. During the breeding season, mainly the southwest monsoon (June to August) but sometimes during the receding monsoon, the song is a strong whistling twee-twee-ta-whit-chu, often delivered from a prominent perch. The colour of the inside of the mouth is said to turn from orange-brown to black during the breeding season. They appear to nest cooperatively, the nest being a deep cone made with grass and lined with fine fibre. The nest is wedged between upright stems, the vertical stems being incorporated into the wall of the nest. The outside of the nest is well covered in cobwebs. The usual clutch is four but varies from three to five. The eggs are pinkish white with chestnut-red patches. Both parents take part in incubation and feeding the young. The eggs hatch after about 15-16 days and the young birds fledge after about 13 days. Adult birds have been seen feigning injury presumably to detract predators. Birds roost communally in the centre of a bush, all facing in the same direction and sitting side by side. Members of a group will preen each other. In an apparent territorial display, a pair of birds were found to sing while facing another singing pair and they all simultaneously bobbed their heads while perching on legs held straight to appear tall. <b>Shikras</b> may sometimes attempt to prey on these birds.|$|R

500|$|The {{flight is}} a {{characteristic}} [...] "flap-flap-glide", with the glide creating an undulating pattern. This species {{is similar in}} size to the Levant sparrowhawk, but larger than the <b>shikra</b> (the calls are however different); the male is only slightly larger than the merlin. Because of the overlap in sizes, the female can {{be confused with the}} similarly-sized male northern goshawk, but lacks the bulk of that species. Eurasian sparrowhawks are smaller, more slender and have shorter wings, a square-ended tail and fly with faster wingbeats. A confusion species in China is the besra, although A. n. melaschistos is considerably larger.|$|E
2500|$|Black sparrowhawks prey {{primarily}} on mid-sized birds. Most prey is spotted from a foliage-concealed perch {{and then is}} killed in flight while on a short flying dash. Less often, they stoop or chase prey seen during low or high flight over open country or near the canopy of trees and, in some cases, may even pursue prey on foot. Although kills are often made in under a minute after the initial attack, occasionally this species may engage in a prolonged pursuit over several minutes. They {{have been known to}} scan for antswarms so they can predate birds attracted to them. Most birds preyed on by this species are in the size range of [...] However, they have taken guineafowl weighing up to [...] Doves are the primary prey of males, whereas females take a greater quantity of larger prey such as pigeons and francolins. They also feed on poultry found in rural villages, which have been inadvertently made available to them by humans. They also often take species such as rock pigeons that have flourished due to urban growth and settlement. It is, in fact, one of the species that have been able to adapt to a changing habitat due to afforestation and urbanization by taking advantage of the increase in dove and pigeon populations. [...] With some regularity, they prey on other raptor species, including <b>shikra,</b> Ovambo sparrowhawk, African goshawk and wood owl. [...] Very occasionally, they may supplement their diet with small mammals, such as bats, rodents and juvenile mongooses. Black sparrowhawks can carry their plucked, and decapitated prey up to , usually well above the canopy.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>shikra</b> (Accipiter badius) {{is a small}} bird of prey in {{the family}} Accipitridae found widely {{distributed}} in Asia and Africa where it is also called the little banded goshawk. The African forms may represent a separate species but have usually been considered as subspecies of the <b>shikra.</b> The <b>shikra</b> is very similar in appearance to other sparrowhawk species including the Chinese goshawk and Eurasian sparrowhawk. They have a sharp two note call and have the typical flap and glide flight. Their calls are imitated by drongos and the common hawk-cuckoo resembles it in plumage.|$|E
50|$|First {{described}} by Nikolai Alekseevich Severtzov in 1850, the Levant sparrowhawk {{is a small}} bird of prey in the genus Accipiter.

Along with the <b>shikra,</b> the Chinese sparrowhawk and the Nicobar sparrowhawk, it makes up a complex species group. It is known to have hybridised with the <b>shikra</b> and the Eurasian sparrowhawk. Despite its extensive range, it has no subspecies.|$|E
