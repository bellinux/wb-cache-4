50|$|The bastard {{sturgeon}}, fringebarbel sturgeon, <b>ship</b> <b>sturgeon,</b> spiny sturgeon, or {{thorn sturgeon}} (Acipenser nudiventris) is {{a species of}} fish in the Acipenseridae family. Formerly abundant in the Black, Aral and Caspian seas, its range is now primarily limited to the Ural River (in Russia and Kazakhstan), with a possible relict populations in the Rioni River in Georgia and the Safid Rud in Iran. The healthiest population is one in Lake Balkhash in Kazakhstan, well outside its natural range, where they were introduced in the 1960s for commercial purposes. It {{has been reported that}} this fish has the highest relative fecundity for any sturgeon species.|$|E
50|$|The Ili River {{discharges}} {{into the}} southeastern edge of Lake Balkhash, where {{it forms a}} large delta of about 8000 km2. The delta is situated between the Saryesik-Atyrau Desert and the Taukum Desert. Until 1948 the delta was a refuge of the extinct Turan tiger. A reintroduction project of the Siberian tiger to the delta has been proposed. Since the Siberian tiger {{has turned out to}} be the closest relative, it has been proposed to introduce this subspecies instead. Large populations of wild boar, which were a main prey base of the Turan tiger, can be still found in the swamps of the delta. There are also some roe deer and in the drier steppes to the south of Lake Balkhash live saiga antelopes and goitered gazelles. A reintroduction of the Buchara deer, which was once an important prey item is under consideration. Buchara deer live in the forests at the Kapchagay Reservoir. Another potential prey species, which is extinct in the area is the Asiatic wild ass. It could be reintroduced in the steppes adjoining the delta.An area of 9766 km2 within the delta has been designated as a Ramsar Site. This site has 427 species of plants and 345 species of animals, including important populations of rare species, like Dalmatian pelican, goitered gazelle, marbeled polecat, white-headed duck, red-breasted goose, and <b>ship</b> <b>sturgeon.</b> The delta has also become known for its Wels catfish, which can grow to over 300 lb. The Government of Kazakhstan plans to join the three sanctuaries Balkash, Karoy and Kukan, which are situated in the delta, into one National Park.|$|E

40|$|Atlantic and <b>ship</b> <b>sturgeon</b> The {{problem of}} the {{absolute}} decline and the begining of the complete extinction of the Atlantic sturgeon and the <b>ship</b> <b>sturgeon</b> from the Danube River occurred {{in the middle of}} the 20 th century (Ristić, 1963). The last specimens of the Atlantic sturgeon, in this part of the Danube River, were recorded during the period 1948 - 1954, two in 1948, one in 1950, one in 1952 and two in 1954 (Ristić, 1963). The <b>ship</b> <b>sturgeon</b> population is considered to be in the process of disappearing on the territory of Serbia. The last findings in 20 th century were in period 1948 - 1954, when only 5 individuals were recorded (Ristić, 1963). The only recent record of the <b>ship</b> <b>sturgeon</b> was in October 2003 (Simonović et al., 2005). Beluga, Russian and stellate sturgeon Stellate sturgeon and Russian sturgeon were once common in the fishermen catch. Maximum of the Russian sturgeon catch, for the last 50 years, was in 1975 (17, 6 t) and for the stellate sturgeon in 1965 (8, 6 t). Today, together with the Atlantic sturgeon, they are protected by the Decree on Natural Rarities ("Official Gazette of the Republic of Serbia", no. 50 / 93). Maximum of the beluga catch for the last 50 years were in 1966 and 1975 (20, 7 t) ...|$|E

40|$|Populations of six {{sturgeon}} {{species in}} the Danube River (Beluga, Russian sturgeon, Stellate sturgeon, Sterlet, <b>Ship</b> <b>sturgeon</b> and Atlantic sturgeon) have experienced severe decline during the last several decades, mostly due to the unsustainable fishery, river fragmentation and water pollution. In the present study, the question of viability of Danube sturgeon populations and the poor knowledge of their ecology have been addressed through three different research activities: 1) statistical methods that infer extinction based on sighting records {{have been used to}} assess probability of extinction of the Ship and Atlantic sturgeon, whose presence n the Danube basin is uncertain; 2) assessment of microelement accumulation in sturgeon pectoral fin rays, especially of strontium and calcium, has been conducted as a method that can reveal migration patterns of anadromous sturgeons; 3) population viability analysis in a Vortex simulation model has been conducted in order to assess the state of the six Danube sturgeon species, their future risk of extinction and to determine the most suitable conservation and management measures. Methods for inferring extinction based on sighting records provided a significant probability that the Atlantic sturgeon is extinct, with extinction occurring somewhere between 1966 and 1970, and that the <b>Ship</b> <b>sturgeon</b> is probably still present in the Danube basin, but that extinction may occur within a few decades. A new model has been also developed within the present study, able to infer probability of extinction based on the trends in sighting intervals, since this issue was not adequately considered in the existing models. Although the analysis of the strontium to calcium ratio in sturgeon pectoral fin rays has revealed changes that might indicate probable migration of juvenile fish from the river to the sea, further studies are needed for improvement of this method. Population viability analysis has revealed a large sensitivity of the Danube sturgeon populations to changes in the natural mortality, fecundity, age at maturity and spawning frequency. It was also confirmed that the sturgeons are highly susceptible to even moderate levels of commercial fishery, and that their recovery is a multi-decadal affair. Stocking with adult individuals was shown to produce considerably greater effect on population persistence than stocking with juveniles, but the latter approach is probably still preferable since it avoids many inherent problems of aquaculture cultivation. This study represents the first population viability analysis of the Danube sturgeons...|$|E

This shorter portion was dug by a private group headed by then-president of Chicago and North Western Railway, William B. Ogden, between July 8, 1872 and the late fall of 1881.
