Along with the new parkway, a brand-new local <b>street</b> <b>network</b> was proposed to help support the new alignment. These would minimize the pressure of traffic on Route31 and include better roads for bicycles and pedestrians. More direct routes to different portions of the community would be provided to maintain the community's character. The proposed parkway was to also help upgrade the sensitive history along the South Branch River. According to the 2008 highway plans, the South Branch Parkway would cost the state more than $2.2 million (2008 USD) in funds to put together the survey of lands in the proposed alignment. Some of these funds for the survey were originally intended to go towards the removal of the Flemington Circle.|$|E

5|$|The streets Volden (The Rampart) and Graven (The Moat) {{testify to}} the defences of the initial Viking {{settlement}} and Allégaderingen in Midtbyen roughly follows the boundaries of that settlement. The <b>street</b> <b>network</b> {{in the inner city}} formed during the Middle Ages with narrow, curved streets and low, dense housing by the river and coast. Vesterport (Westward Gate) still bears the name of a medieval city gate and the narrow alleyways Posthussmøgen and Telefonsmøgen are remnants of toll stations from that time. The inner city has the oldest preserved buildings, especially the Latin Quarter, with houses dating back to the early 17thcentury in Mejlgade and Skolegade. Medieval merchants' mansions with courtyards can be seen in Klostergade, Studsgade and Skolegade. By far, the largest part of the present day city was built during and after the industrialization of the late 1800s and the most represented architectural styles are historicism and modernism, especially Danish functionalism of which there are many fine examples.|$|E

40|$|Research {{interests}} in the studies of complex systems have been booming in many disciplines for the last decade. As the nature of geographic environment is a complex system, researches in this field are anticipated. In particular, the urban <b>street</b> <b>networks</b> in the Geographic Information System (GIS) as complex networks are brought forth for the thesis study. Meanwhile, identifying the scale-free property, which is represented as the power law distribution from a mathematical perspective, is a hot topic in the studies of complex systems. Many previous studies estimated the power law distributions with graphic method, which used linear regression method to identify the exponent value and estimate the quality that the power law fits to the empirical data. However, such strategy is considered to cause inaccurate results and lead to biased judgments. Whereas, the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) and the Goodness of fit test based on Kolmogorov-Smironv (KS) statistics will provide more solid and trustable results for the estimations. Therefore, this thesis addresses these updated methods exploring the topological patterns of urban <b>street</b> <b>networks</b> from an analytical perspective, which is estimating the power law distributions for the connectivity degree and length of the urban streets. Simultaneously, this thesis explores the <b>street</b> <b>networks</b> from a visual perspective as well. The visual perspective adopts the large network visualization tool (LaNet-vi), which is developed based on the k-core decomposition algorithm, to analyze the cores of the urban <b>street</b> <b>networks.</b> By retrieving the spatial information of the networks from GIS, it actually enables us {{to see how the}} urban <b>street</b> <b>networks</b> decomposed topologically and spatially. In particular, the 40 US urban <b>street</b> <b>networks</b> are reformed as natural <b>street</b> <b>networks</b> by using three "natural street" models. The results from analytical perspective show that the 80 / 20 principle still exists for both the street connectivity degree and length qualitatively, which means around 20 % natural <b>streets</b> in each <b>network</b> have a connectivity degree or length value above the average level, while the 80 % ones are below the average. Moreover, the quantitative analysis revealed {{the fact that most of}} the distributions from the street connectivity degree or length of the 40 natural <b>street</b> <b>networks</b> follow a power law distribution with an exponential cut-off. Some of the rest cases are verified to have power law distributions and some extreme cases are still unclear for identifying which distribution form to fit. The comparisons are made to the power law statement from previous study which used the linear regression method. Moreover, the visual perspective not only provides us the chance to see the inner structures about the hierarchies and cores of the natural <b>street</b> <b>networks</b> topologically and spatially, but also serves as a reflection for the analytical perspective. Such relationships are discussed and the possibility of combining these two aspects are pointed out. In addition, the future work is also proposed for making better studies in this field...|$|R

The spontaneous and unorganized growth of the aforementioned <b>street</b> <b>networks,</b> referred to as organic networks, forms a dense network of small, narrow and indirect streets that are not organized according to ideal geometric patterns of urban designers but emerged and were redirected according to the daily needs of the residents and included irregular and deformed shapes and intersection angels.|$|R
25|$|Much of Calgary's <b>street</b> <b>network</b> is on a grid where {{roads are}} {{numbered}} with avenues running east–west and streets running north–south. Until 1904 {{the streets were}} named; after that date, all streets were given numbers radiating outwards from the city centre. Roads in predominantly residential areas as well as freeways and expressways do not generally conform to the grid and are usually not numbered as a result. However, it is a developer and city convention in Calgary that non-numbered streets within a new community have the same name prefix as the community itself so that streets can more easily be located within the city.|$|E
25|$|A dilemma {{arises from}} trying to meet {{important}} planning objectives when using the grid: pedestrianism, cost efficiency and environmental responsiveness. To serve pedestrians well, a rectangular configuration and high frequency of streets and intersections is the preferred route, which the orthogonal grid geometry provides. To reduce development costs and environmental impact, lower frequency of streets is the logical path. Since these two design objectives are contradictory a balance needs to be struck. Such balance has been achieved in leading modern projects such as Vauban, Freiburg and Village Homes, Davis. Both score high in pedestrian and bike mode share and, at the same time, in reducing negative development externalities. Their layout configurations represent a fusion of the classic grid plan with recent <b>street</b> <b>network</b> patterns.|$|E

By the late 1970s and early 1980s, Soviet economists were calling for the construction of more roads to alleviate some of the burden from the railways and to improve the Soviet government budget. The <b>street</b> <b>network</b> and automotive industry remained underdeveloped, and dirt roads were common outside major cities. Soviet maintenance projects proved unable to take care of even the few roads the country had. By the early-to-mid-1980s, the Soviet authorities tried to solve the road problem by ordering the construction of new ones. Meanwhile, the automobile industry was growing at a faster rate than road construction. The underdeveloped road network led to a growing demand for public transport.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel concept of flow {{to measure the}} {{efficiency}} of urban <b>street</b> <b>networks</b> (a kind of complex networks) for travel or shipping goods.

The findings are illustrated using three urban <b>street</b> <b>networks</b> (two in the Europe and one in the USA), and three other non-spatial networks. We further conjecture that the flow capacity of living organisms is higher than that of static systems. In other words, living organisms are more efficient than static systems...|$|R

25|$|A <b>street</b> <b>network</b> pattern {{can affect}} the {{production}} of pollutants {{by the amount of}} car travel that it necessitates and the speed at which cars can travel. The grid plan with its frequent intersections may displace a portion of the local car trips with walking or biking due to the directness of route that it offers to pedestrians. But it also makes the same routes more direct for cars, which could be an enticement for driving. The potential car trip displacement would result in a reduction of pollutant emissions. The advantage of the intersection density for pedestrians, however, can have a contrary effect for cars due to its potential for reducing speeds. Low speeds below 20 mph have a significantly higher coefficient of pollutant production than above 30, though the coefficient after leveling off tends to increase gradually after 50 mph. This effect is accentuated with high traffic density in areas with commercial uses where speeds come to a crawl. Since the grid plan is non-hierarchical and intersections are frequent, all streets can be subject to this potential reduction of average speeds, leading to a high production of pollutants. Greenhouse and noxious gases can be detrimental to the environment and to resident health.|$|E

2500|$|As roads have {{typically}} been laid out along section boundaries spaced one mile (1.6km) apart, growing urban areas have adopted road grids with mile-long [...] "blocks" [...] {{as their primary}} <b>street</b> <b>network.</b> Such roads in urban areas are known as section line roads, usually designed primarily for automobile travel and limited in their use for non-motorized travel. [...] In post-World War II suburbs, commercial development has largely occurred along and at intersections of arterials, {{while the rest of}} the former square-mile sections have generally filled with residential development, as well as schools, religious facilities, and parks.

The use of the term Trails to describe major highways resulted from the development of early pioneer trails into the highways themselves. The original trails were named after the settlements to which they lead; for example, Edmonton Trail (part of the former Calgary and Edmonton Trail), (Fort) Macleod Trail, and Banff Trail (which combined with 24th Street W was later renamed Crowchild Trail). More recently developed local expressways were given the Trail moniker and have been named after important people from Calgary's history (Crowchild Trail, Marquis of Lorne Trail), native groups (Stoney Trail, Sarcee Trail, Blackfoot Trail) or again after their destination (Airport Trail).

2500|$|Another {{point of}} debate {{at that time}} was that of the merits of urbanism. Again, of {{importance}} here were opposing views from abroad, namely the picturesque theories of town planning proposed by Viennese city planner Camillo Sitte, as put forward in his influential book City Planning According to Artistic Principles (1889) and the opposing classical-rational urbanism point of view also proposed in Vienna by Otto Wagner, heavily influenced by the Parisian model - under the directorship of Baron Haussmann from 1858 to 1870 - of driving wide boulevards through the old labyrinthine city with the intent of modernising traffic and waste management, as well as enabling the greater social control of the population. This debate came to a head in Finland in the first ever town planning design competition in 1898-1900 for the Töölö district of Helsinki. Three entries were lifted out for recognition; first prize to Gustaf Nyström (together with engineer Herman Norrmén), second prize to Lars Sonck, and third prize to a joint entry by Sonck, Bertil Jung and Valter Thomé. Nyström's scheme represented classicism with wide main streets and imposing public buildings arranged in symmetrical axial compositions, and the other two in the Sittesque style, with the <b>street</b> <b>network</b> adapted to the rocky terrain and with picturesque compositions. A fantastic sketch accompanying Sonck's competition entry gives an indication of the imagery he was aiming for, inspired by his travels in Germany. Historian Pekka Korvenmaa makes the point that leading theme was the creation of the atmosphere of medieval urban environments - and Sonck later designed a similar proposal in 1904 to rearrange the immediate surroundings of St.Michael's Church in Helsinki, with numerous [...] "fantastic" [...] spired buildings. In the Töölö competition, undecided what course of action to take, however, the City Council asked the prize-winners to submit new proposals. When this led to further stalemate Nyström and Sonck were commissioned to work together on the final plan combining Nyström's spacious <b>street</b> <b>network</b> and elements of Sonck's Sittesque details. The final plan (1916) under the direction of Jung, made the scheme more uniform, while the architecture is seen as typical of the Nordic Classicism style. A typical street in the plan is that of Museokatu, with tall lines of buildings in a classical style along a curving street line. A still wider (24 metres) new tree-lined boulevard was that of Helsinginkatu, driven through the working-class district of Kallio, first outlined in 1887 by Sonck, but with further input from Nyström, and completed in around 1923.|$|E
