2500|$|The {{condition}} that v1, v2, ..., vn span V guarantees that each vector v {{can be assigned}} coordinates, whereas the linear independence of v1, v2, ..., vn assures that these coordinates are unique (i.e. {{there is only one}} linear combination of the basis vectors that is equal to v). In this way, once a basis of a vector space V over F has been chosen, V may be identified with the coordinate n-space Fn. Under this identification, addition and scalar multiplication of vectors in V correspond to addition and scalar multiplication of their coordinate vectors in Fn. Furthermore, if V and W are an n-dimensional and m-dimensional vector space over F, and a basis of V and a basis of W have been fixed, then any linear transformation T: V → W may be encoded by an m × n matrix A with entries in the field F, called the matrix of T with respect to these bases. Two matrices that encode the same linear transformation in different bases are called <b>similar.</b> <b>Matrix</b> theory replaces the study of linear transformations, which were defined axiomatically, by the study of matrices, which are concrete objects.
