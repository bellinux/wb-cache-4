5|$|My first {{memory of}} {{fragrance}} is my mother, {{and as a}} very young girl, hearing her footsteps... Her stilettos click, click, clicking on the hardwood floor and she wore a beautiful fragrance and she would walk past me and it would just stay in the room. It left a warm feeling every time I thought about her scent. I think about the icons that I respect {{and they all have}} their own fragrance <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> {{it was time for me}} to have my own.|$|E
25|$|In 1963, I {{worked in}} a Jewish school in Dublin, {{teaching}} French with an Irish accent to kids, primarily Lithuanians. The parents there gave me a trip to Israel as a present. I had no money, so I went and {{worked in a}} kibbutz – plucking chickens, picking oranges. My parents were very nervous; here I was {{going out to the}} Middle East by myself. I wrote to them regularly, telling them about the kibbutz. My father and mother sent my letters to a newspaper, which published them. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought,</b> It's not so hard to be a writer. Just write a letter home. After that, I started writing other travel articles.|$|E
25|$|Which was, you know, {{that was}} cool – {{somebody}} had to get it, I suppose. What happened actually was then I started to ring him up. I thought, here's the guy historically placed to give Lennon–McCartney a good deal at last, 'cos we got signed when we were 21 or something in a back alley in Liverpool. And the deal, it's remained the same, even though we made this company the most famous – hugely successful. So I kept thinking, {{it was time for}} a raise... I did talk to him about it, but he kind of blanked me on it. He kept saying, 'That's just business, Paul.' You know. <b>So,</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought,</b> 'Yeah, it is,' and waited for a reply, but we never kind of got to it... It was no big bust-up. We kind of drifted apart after that".|$|E

25|$|I {{grew up on}} the Jersey Shore, on {{a little}} barrier island. The Atlantic Ocean was on one side, the bay was on the other. Everyone there hunted and fished and clammed and got crabs out of the bay. And one day my brother told me someone had come down from the Bureau of Petty Harassment or {{something}} and they measured the temperature of the water and had decided it was a little too warm and a certain type of bacteria might incubate in it and there was a chance that might harm the clams. And so, from now on, no one was supposed to take clams out of the bay anymore. Which everyone ignored. And no one died. That was before the government got tenacious about this stuff. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> that was pretty stupid right there.|$|E
25|$|Bertrand Russell {{made the}} {{following}} {{comment on the}} Philosophical Investigations in his book My Philosophical Development:I have not found in Wittgenstein's Philosophical Investigations anything that seemed to me interesting and I do not understand why a whole school finds important wisdom in its pages. Psychologically this is surprising. The earlier Wittgenstein, whom I knew intimately, was a man addicted to passionately intense thinking, profoundly aware of difficult problems of which I, like him, felt the importance, and possessed (or at least <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought)</b> of true philosophical genius. The later Wittgenstein, on the contrary, seems to have grown tired of serious thinking and to have invented a doctrine which would make such an activity unnecessary. I do not for one moment believe that the doctrine which has these lazy consequences is true. I realize, however, that I have an overpoweringly strong bias against it, for, if it is true, philosophy is, at best, a slight help to lexicographers, and at worst, an idle tea-table amusement.Ernest Gellner wrote the book Words and Things, in which he was fiercely critical of the work of Ludwig Wittgenstein, J. L. Austin, Gilbert Ryle, Antony Flew, P. F. Strawson and many others. Ryle refused to have the book reviewed in the philosophical journal Mind (which he edited), and Bertrand Russell (who had written an approving foreword) protested in a letter to The Times. A response from Ryle and a lengthy correspondence ensued.|$|E
500|$|Gaga {{explained}} in the nineteenth episode of her [...] "Transmission Gagavision" [...] series, the main idea behind the music video of [...] "Poker Face". She said that [...] "I knew I {{wanted it to be}} sexy, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> no pants, because that's sexy, And I knew I wanted it to be futuristic, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> shoulder pads, because that's my thing." [...] The music video premiered on MTV UK on February 17, 2009. In some versions of the song, the words [...] "muffin" [...] (being a slang term for the woman's vagina), [...] "Russian Roulette" [...] and [...] "gun" [...] are censored out (bleeped). On June 21, 2009, the video won the Best International Artist Video at the 2009 MuchMusic Video Awards. The video received four nominations at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, in the categories of Video of the Year, Best New Artist, Best Female Video and Best Pop Video. Along with five other nominations for [...] "Paparazzi", Gaga was tied with Beyoncé for most nominations each for that year.|$|E

If you look at Madonna's history with fashion, that makes him an obvious choice. [...] always wants to push the envelope. There are no vanity considerations based on her age." ...|$|E

500|$|Teles {{said she}} {{would be open to}} {{returning}} for a sequel; she feels the film was [...] "set [...] up very nicely for" [...] one, and claims [...] "verybody's wondering" [...] if there will be a follow-up. On the possibility of a sequel, Lundgren said: [...] "I didn't consider [...] as a franchise, but when I was over there , I started thinking, 'How would I do this different? How would I stay close to the subject matter?' Organ trafficking is quite big as well, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> that could be interesting. We could follow up with some kind of other trade." ...|$|E

Prior to {{performing}} the song on the first tour date in Oakland, she said, [...] "I know it's taken me a little long to get , <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> I'd give you guys a first..." [...] Rolling Stone commented on Minogue's background singers during the song, saying they had [...] "the evening's most striking fashion innovation": neon pink wigs worn as shoulder pads. After the tour stop in Chicago, John Dugan of Time Out said that the performance was his [...] "favorite song of the night".|$|E
500|$|... "Too Dizzy" [...] was {{the first}} song Bowie and new {{collaborator}} Erdal Kizilcay wrote together for the album, and was written in homage to the 50s. Bowie said [...] "a real Fifties subject matter was either love or jealousy, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> I’d stick with jealousy because it’s a lot more interesting". Bowie at the time called the song a [...] "throwaway" [...] and seemed surprised that he included it on the album. The song has been deleted from subsequent reissues of Never Let Me Down. Despite Bowie's dislike for the song, EMI briefly considered it for release as a fourth single from the album, and in fact it did appear as a promo release in the US.|$|E
500|$|Hillenburg went to Humboldt State University, in Arcata, California, as a marine-science major. He also minored in art, {{and claimed}} that [...] " [...] blossomed as a painter in Humboldt." [...] In 1984, he earned his bachelor's degree in natural-resource {{planning}} and interpretation, with an emphasis in marine resources. He intended to take a master's degree, but {{said it would be}} in art: [...] "Initially I think I assumed that if I went to school for art I would never have any way of making a living, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> it might be smarter to keep art my passion and hobby and study something else. But by the time I got to the end of my undergrad work, I realized I should be in art." ...|$|E

500|$|Moore {{performed}} {{his first}} solo show {{at a small}} club in Istanbul on March 23, 2007. The hour-long show consisted primarily of material from Graveyard Mountain Home, which was accompanied by projections of the corresponding scenes from Age 13. [...] "I {{thought that it would}} be good for the first show to be sort of small and comfortable... <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> we [...] just have a hundred people," [...] Moore said. [...] "Everybody can see, everybody can be comfortable and sort of enjoy themselves. And if something goes horribly wrong, it only happens in front of a hundred people." [...] Moore hoped the show would form the basis of more elaborate, longer shows. He planned on playing more shows in Turkey, before touring Europe and the rest of the world.|$|E
500|$|The {{screenplay}} {{was written}} by Alun Owen, who was chosen because the Beatles were familiar with his play No Trams to Lime Street, and he had shown an aptitude for Liverpudlian dialogue. McCartney commented, [...] "Alun hung around with us and was careful to try and put words in our mouths that he might've heard us speak, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> he {{did a very good}} script." [...] Owen spent several days with the group, who told him their lives were like [...] "a train and a room and a car and a room and a room and a room"; the character of Paul's grandfather refers to this in the dialogue. Owen wrote the script from the viewpoint that the Beatles had become prisoners of their own fame, their schedule of performances and studio work having become punishing.|$|E
500|$|... "No One" [...] saw the {{reintroduction}} of Richard Dormer and Paul Kaye, who portrayed Beric Dondarrion and Thoros of Myr, respectively, in {{the third}} season, last appearing in the episode [...] "The Bear and the Maiden Fair", before returning for the sixth season. Dormer was previously asked about returning to Game of Thrones {{in an interview in}} February 2015, saying {{at the time that he}} was doubtful about coming back to the series, stating [...] "they haven't told me about it, so I don't think so." [...] He also noted about his portrayal of the character, [...] "Beric was a noble character, a leader of men. Kind of like Robin Hood. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought,</b> that's how I'll play the guy." [...] Paul Kaye's participation in the series was confirmed in mid-April 2016, with his agency posting about the casting shortly before the premiere of the sixth season.|$|E

500|$|Hugh Syme {{provided}} the artwork for Octavarium. The idea of depicting a giant Newton's cradle was {{born out of}} discussions between Syme and Portnoy. The two talked about how [...] "for everything you do in music you create either a cluster or triad", according to Syme. [...] "And then it became evident that for every action there is an opposite reaction. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> we could do something based on the Newton's cradle." [...] There are numerous references to the numbers five and eight throughout the artwork, alluding to the album's concept. For example, the Newton's cradle has eight suspended balls, and there are five birds on the cover. The album booklet features an octagonal maze, spider and octopus, among other references. The landscape on the cover is made up of a sky and grass from Indiana, and a background from the Lake District.|$|E
500|$|The media showed {{concern over}} the film's title, deeming it [...] "odd", and some people were shocked because of the title, which can be {{translated}} into English as [...] "mean". However, the makers said that [...] "kaminey" [...] is not a negative term and is actually a term of endearment. According to Bhardwaj, {{the idea for the}} title came from a scene from Gulzar's Ijaazat (1987), in which the lead actor (Naseeruddin Shah) refers to the actress in a loving manner; {{it was the first time}} that he heard the word used that way. Bhardwaj told Rediff, [...] "when the script of this film was written, it was like discovering your own mean side. The format of the film is of a caper and all the characters in this film, excluding one, has an agenda. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> it was an apt title for the film".|$|E

Liam threw his microphone and the band's award into the crowd. On 15 March 2010, Liam defended his actions at the awards ceremony, saying [...] "I'm sick of it all being about me and Noel, {{the last couple of}} months has pretty much been all about me and him <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> it was only right to mention the other lads who played on the album and the best fans in the world," [...] and [...] "I thought it was a nice gesture to give this to the fans, obviously it was misinterpreted as per usual."
