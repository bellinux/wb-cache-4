Further to cell and necessary relevant growth factor <b>selection,</b> <b>cell</b> delivery is an important issue. Indeed, the intracoronary route is the most straightforward cell delivery route as associated with intramyocardial cellular retention; rentention rates are however low, i.e. exceed 10%.

Other alternative injection routes have been studied, namely injection via sternotomy, endomyocardial and intracoronary routes. Nevertheless, all methods aforementioned have been associated with limited cardiac function improvements and limited cell survival once implanted in the fibrous myocardium.|$|E

Wound healing assay, immunofluorescence, Western blotting, and matrix metalloproteinase zymogen gel assay were utilized to investigate the phenotype changes of three oral squamous cancer cells (OC 3, OC 3 -I 5, and OC 3 -IV 2). Among these three cell lines, selective subpopulations of OC 3, OC 3 -I 5, and OC 3 -IV 2 have high migratory ability compared to OC 3 in a wound healing assay. Moreover, immunofluorescence showed that formation of actin dots and paxillin rings in OC 3 was less than in OC 3 -I 5 and OC 3 -IV 2. Minor differences of other adhesion molecules and matrix metalloproteinase activity have also been observed. Enhanced cell migration ability and increased invadosomes have been detected in both in vitro <b>selection</b> <b>cell</b> line OC 3 -I 5 and in vivo <b>selection</b> <b>cell</b> line OC 3 -IV 2, suggesting that there may be a correlation between migration activity and invadosome formation in invasive oral cancer cells.

The customary introduction of compound biological entities such as organisms, cells, genes, catalysts or motors, is largely descriptive and relies mostly on inductive reasoning.

We show that the <b>cell</b> <b>selection</b> rules in multi-antenna HetNets may differ significantly from the single-antenna HetNets due to the possible differences in multi-antenna transmission schemes across tiers. While {{it is challenging to}} derive exact <b>cell</b> <b>selection</b> rules even for maximizing signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) at the receiver, we show that adding an appropriately chosen tier-dependent <b>cell</b> <b>selection</b> bias in the received power yields a close approximation. Assuming arbitrary selection bias for each tier, simple expressions for downlink coverage and rate are derived. For coverage maximization, the required selection bias for each tier is given in closed form.

40|$|Carbon foams {{produced}} by the controlled thermal decomposition of inexpensive coal extracts exhibit a combination of structural and thermal properties that make them attractive for aerospace applications. Their thermal conductivity can be tailored between 0. 5 and 100 W/mK through precursor selection/modification and heat treatment conditions; thus, they can serve in either thermal protection or heat transfer systems such as heat exchangers. Because their structure is essentially a 3 D random network of graphite-like members, they also can be considered low-cost, easily fabricated replacements for multi-directional structural carbon fiber preforms. Strengths of over 4000 psi in compression are common. Their density can be designed between 0. 1 and 0. 8 g/cc, {{and they can be}} impregnated with a variety of matrices or used, unfilled, in sandwich structures.

40|$|A {{genome-wide}} {{screen of}} 4168 homozygous diploid yeast deletion strains has been performed to identify nonessential genes that {{participate in the}} bipolar budding pattern. By examining bud scar patterns representing the sites of previous cell divisions, 127 mutants representing three different phenotypes were found: unipolar, axial-like, and random. From this screen, 11 functional classes of known genes were identified, including those involved in actin-cytoskeleton organization, general bud site <b>selection,</b> <b>cell</b> polarity, vesicular transport, cell wall synthesis, protein modification, transcription, nuclear function, translation, and other functions. Four characterized genes that were not known previously to participate in bud site selection were also found to be important for the haploid axial budding pattern.

Deletion of one resulted in unipolar budding exclusively from the proximal pole, suggesting that this gene {{plays an important role}} in diploid distal budding. Mutations in 20 other novel BUD genes produced a random budding phenotype and one produced an axial-like budding defect.

40|$|Deletion of autoreactive thymocytes at the DP {{stage is}} the basis for {{tolerance}} to thymus-expressed self antigens. In this study we investigated whether distinct signalling pathways are induced in DP thymocytes as compared to mature T cells upon stimulation with antigen. Using triple transgenic mice expressing a TCR transgene, dominant negative ras/Mek proteins and a reporter gene construct with AP- 1 or NF-kappa B binding sites, we showed a complete lack of transcriptional activity of NF-kappa B but not AP- 1 in DP thymocytes, whereas both were transcriptionally active in mature T cells after antigenic stimulation. Lack of NF-kappa B induction correlated with increased death in response to antigen. AP- 1 induction was dependent on the integrity of the ras/Mek pathway indicating that this pathway was activated in the DP thymocytes. In contrast, we found a complete lack of constitutive expression of the epsilon isoform of Protein Kinase C (PKC) in DP thymocytes, although it was present in mature thymocytes and peripheral T cells. Taken together the results suggest that the lack of PKC epsilon in DP thymocytes could lead to the absence of NF-kappa B activity after antigenic stimulation contributing to negative <b>selection.</b> <b>Cell</b> Death and Differentiation (2000) 7, 1253 - 1262...|$|E

As a DNA-binding {{transcription factor}}, c-Myb regulates specific gene programs through activation of target genes. Still, our understanding of these programs is incomplete. Here, we report a set of novel c-Myb target genes, identified using a combined approach: specific c-Myb knockdown by 2 different siRNAs and subsequent global expression profiling, combined with the confirmation of direct binding of c-Myb to the target promoters by ChIP assays. The combination of these 2 approaches, as well as additional validation such as cloning and testing the promoters in reporter assays, confirmed that MYADM, LMO 2, GATA 2, STAT 5 A, and IKZF 1 are target genes of c-Myb. Additional studies, using chromosome conformation capture, demonstrated that c-Myb target genes may directly interact with each other, indicating that these genes may be coordinately regulated.
