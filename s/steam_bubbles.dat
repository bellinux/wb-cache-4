5|$|Ultimately, the {{temperatures}} {{near the bottom}} of the geyser rise to a point where boiling begins which forces <b>steam</b> <b>bubbles</b> to rise to the top of the column. As they burst through the geyser's vent, some water overflows or splashes out, reducing the weight of the column and thus the pressure on the water below. With this release of pressure, the superheated water flashes into steam, boiling violently throughout the column. The resulting froth of expanding steam and hot water then sprays out of the geyser vent.|$|E
25|$|Geysers: Geysers such as Old Faithful are {{a type of}} {{geothermal}} {{feature that}} periodically erupt scalding hot water. Increased pressure exerted by the enormous weight of the overlying rock and water prevents deeper water from boiling. As the hot water rises it is under less pressure and <b>steam</b> <b>bubbles</b> form. They, in turn, expand on their ascent until the bubbles are too big and numerous to pass freely through constrictions. At a critical point the confined bubbles actually lift the water above, causing the geyser to splash or overflow. This decreases {{the pressure of the}} system and violent boiling results. Large quantities of water flash into tremendous amounts of steam that force a jet of water out of the vent: an eruption begins. Water (and heat) is expelled faster than the geyser’s recharge rate, gradually decreasing the system’s pressure and eventually ending the eruption.|$|E
25|$|The first boilers {{suffered}} {{problems with}} the superheaters and with poor circulation for the tube rows in {{the centre of the}} bank, leading to overheating and tube failure. The circulation problems were addressed by re-arranging the feedwater pipes and by placing baffles inside the steam drum, so as to give a more clearly defined circulation. A circulation augmenter, a steel trough, was placed over the tops of the furnace-side tubes, encouraging a single central upwelling flow to above the water level, encouraging <b>steam</b> <b>bubbles</b> to escape and acting as a steam separator before the water re-circulated down the outer-side tubes. In a manner similar to work taking place around the same time on the LMS railway and the development of top feed for steam locomotives, the feedwater was also routed upwards through 'spray pots' and thus passed through the steam space as droplets. The cold feedwater was thus heated to the same temperature as the boiler water before mixing with it, avoiding disturbance to the circulation path.|$|E

When the liquid portion of the pressurizer becomes stratified, the lower layers of water (furthest from the <b>steam</b> <b>bubble)</b> are subcooled and as the <b>steam</b> <b>bubble</b> slowly condenses, pressurizer pressure will appear relatively constant but actually will be slowly lowering.

The local <b>steam</b> <b>bubble</b> velocity was determined by 3 SPN-detectors, moveable over the core-height, by applying correlation analysis. Furthermore a nethod is described by which the intensity of the fluctuating signal (RMS-values) is used to derive the local steam void content as fu~ction of core-height. The experimental results are compared to theoretical calculations and show very good agreement. Experimental Analysis [...] The experiments were performed in a near central fuel element position of the Lingen BUR. Three neutron detectors of the SPii-type /I / were located in different axial locations. In addition a U 235 Ionisation chamber could be used to determine the axial power profile. During operation at full power the signals from the various detector positions (which could be varied during operation) were stored on an analogue magnetic tape; the information was transforned into digital form for processing in a digital computer. 10 deternine the average <b>steam</b> <b>bubble</b> velocity, a cross-correlation analysis of the signals from detectors in neighbouring cooling channels at neigh-bouring axial positions was performed.

She is flat-lipped, having no mouth, she looks like a pool, fifty feet long and thirty wide, and there is no ornamentation about her. At irregular intervals she speaks, and sends up a column of water over two hundred feet high to begin with; then she is angry for a day and a half--sometimes for two days. Owing to her peculiarity of going mad in the night not many people have seen the Giantess at her finest; but the clamour of her unrest, men say, shakes the wooden hotel, and echoes like thunder among the hills.

6000|$|The {{internal}} {{surface is}} completely vitrified, glossy, and smooth. A small fragment examined {{under the microscope}} appeared, {{from the number of}} minute entangled air or perhaps <b>steam</b> <b>bubbles,</b> like an assay fused before the blowpipe. The sand is entirely, or in greater part, siliceous; but some points are of a black colour, and from their glossy surface possess a metallic lustre. The thickness of the wall of the tube varies from a thirtieth to a twentieth of an inch, and occasionally even equals a tenth. On the outside the grains of sand are rounded, and have a slightly glazed appearance: I could not distinguish any signs of crystallisation. In a similar manner to that described in the [...] "Geological Transactions," [...] the tubes are generally compressed, and have deep longitudinal furrows, so as closely to resemble a shrivelled vegetable stalk, or the bark of the elm or cork tree. Their circumference is about two inches, but in some fragments, which are cylindrical and without any furrows, it is as much as four inches. The compression from the surrounding loose sand, acting while the tube was still softened from the effects of the intense heat, has evidently caused the creases or furrows. Judging from the uncompressed fragments, the measure or bore of the lightning (if such a term may be used) must have been about one inch and a quarter. At Paris, M. Hachette and M. Beudant succeeded in making tubes, in most respects similar to these fulgurites, by passing very strong shocks of galvanism through finely-powdered glass: when salt was added, so as to increase its fusibility, the tubes were larger in every dimension. (3/11. [...] "Annales de Chimie et de Physique" [...] tome 37 page 319.) They failed both with powdered feldspar and quartz. One tube, formed with pounded glass, was very nearly an inch long, namely [...] .982, and had an internal diameter of [...] .019 of an inch. When we hear that the strongest battery in Paris was used, and that its power on a substance of such easy fusibility as glass was to form tubes so diminutive, we must feel greatly astonished at the force of a shock of lightning, which, striking the sand in several places, has formed cylinders, in one instance of at least thirty feet long, and having an internal bore, where not compressed, of full an inch and a half; and this in a material so extraordinarily refractory as quartz! ...|$|E

For the most common water hammer, <b>steam</b> <b>bubble</b> collapse induced water hammer, six conditions must be met in order for one to occur. These are: (1) the pipe must be almost horizontal; (2) the subcooling must be greater than 20 C; (3) the L/D must be greater than 24; (4) the velocity must be low enough so that the pipe does not run full, i. e., the Froude number must be less than one; (5) there should be void nearby; (6) the pressure must be high enough so that significant damage occurs, that is the pressure should be above 10 atmospheres.

5000|$|One is {{providing}} {{a place to}} monitor water level in the reactor coolant system. Since the reactor coolant system is completely flooded during normal operations, {{there is no point}} in monitoring coolant level in any of the other vessels. But early awareness of a reduction of coolant level (or a loss of coolant) is important to the safety of the reactor core. The pressurizer is deliberately located high in the reactor containment building such that, if the pressurizer has sufficient coolant in it, one can be reasonably certain that all the other vessels of the reactor coolant system (which are below it) are fully flooded with coolant. There is therefore, a coolant level monitoring system on the pressurizer and it is the one reactor coolant system vessel that is normally not full of coolant. The other secondary function is to provide a [...] "cushion" [...] for sudden pressure changes in the reactor coolant system. The upper portion of the pressurizer is specifically designed to NOT contain liquid coolant and a reading of full on the level instrumentation allows for that upper portion to not contain liquid coolant. Because the coolant in the pressurizer is quite hot during normal operations, the space above the liquid coolant is vaporized coolant (<b>steam).</b> This <b>steam</b> <b>bubble</b> provides a cushion for pressure changes in the reactor coolant system and the operators ensure that the pressurizer maintains this <b>steam</b> <b>bubble</b> at all times during operations. Allowing this <b>steam</b> <b>bubble</b> to disappear by filling the pressurizer to the top with liquid coolant is called letting the pressurizer [...] "go hard" [...] meaning there is no cushion and any sudden pressure change can provide a hammer effect to the entire reactor coolant system.

40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{model has been}} developed {{as an extension of}} single orifice bubble formation to investigate the growth and detachment of vapor/gas bubbles formed at two adjacent submerged orifices in inviscid fluids. The mathematical model treats the two bubbles as an expanding control volume moving to the line of centers above a wall. The movement of the bubbles is obtained by application of force balance acting on the bubble and accounts for surface tension, buoyancy, steam momentum and liquid inertia effects. The liquid inertia effects are determined by applying inviscid and irrotational flow assumptions to allow potential flow theory to calculate the liquid velocity field which then allows the pressure distribution to be calculated. The model is extended to include the mass and energy equations to model the <b>steam</b> <b>bubble</b> formation in sub-cooled water. The theoretical results are compared with the available experimental data of bubble formation during constant mass flow <b>steam</b> <b>bubble</b> formation at two submerged upward facing orifices in sub-cooled water. The model was validated by available experimental data for the growth and detachment processes of two adjacent 1 mm orifices at system pressures of 2 and 3 bars, flow rates of 1. 2 - 4 g/min at sub-cooling of 3. 5 - 35 ºC. The comparisons of theory and experiments indicate that the model successfully predicts the bubbles growth and detachment for the range of conditions studied...|$|R
5000|$|The rapidly {{expanding}} <b>steam</b> <b>bubbles</b> can also perform work by throwing large [...] "slugs" [...] of water inside the boiler {{in the direction}} of the opening, and at astonishing velocity.

50|$|Many shell-type boilers carry a large bath {{of liquid}} water which is heated {{to a higher}} {{temperature}} and pressure (enthalpy) than boiling water would be at atmospheric pressure.

5000|$|The reactor had a dangerously large {{positive}} void {{coefficient of}} reactivity. The void coefficient is a measurement {{of how a}} reactor responds to increased steam formation in the water coolant. Most other reactor designs have a negative coefficient, i.e. the nuclear reaction rate slows when <b>steam</b> <b>bubbles</b> form in the coolant, since as the vapour phase in the reactor increases, fewer neutrons are slowed down. Faster neutrons {{are less likely to}} split uranium atoms, so the reactor produces less power (a negative feedback). Chernobyl's RBMK reactor, however, used solid graphite as a neutron moderator to slow down the neutrons, and the water in it, on the contrary, acts like a harmful neutron absorber. Thus neutrons are slowed down even if <b>steam</b> <b>bubbles</b> form in the water. Furthermore, because steam absorbs neutrons much less readily than water, increasing the intensity of vaporization means that more neutrons are able to split uranium atoms, increasing the reactor's power output. This makes the RBMK design very unstable at low power levels, and prone to suddenly increasing energy production to a dangerous level. This behaviour is counter-intuitive, and this property of the reactor was unknown to the crew.|$|E

5000|$|Being a {{wet process}} with an {{intended}} liquid result, the water promoted the chain reaction by {{serving as a}} neutron moderator, whereby neutrons emitted from fissioned nuclei are slowed so they are more readily absorbed by neighboring nuclei, inducing them to fission in turn.

50|$|If {{the heat}} flux of a boiling system {{is higher than}} the {{critical}} heat flux (CHF) of the system, the bulk fluid may boil, or in some cases, regions of the bulk fluid may boil where the fluid travels in small channels.

This steam is routed to a large tank (or tanks) in the reactor containment building where it is cooled back into liquid (condensed) and stored for later disposition.
