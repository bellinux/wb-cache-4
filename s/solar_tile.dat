40|$|The 17 th Space Photovoltaic Research and Technology (SPRAT XVII) Conference {{was held}} September 11 - 13, 2001, at the Ohio Aerospace Institute (OAI) in Cleveland, Ohio. The SPRAT conference, {{hosted by the}} Photovoltaic and Space Environments Branch of the NASA Glenn Research Center, brought {{together}} representatives of the space photovoltaic community {{from around the world}} to share the latest advances in space solar technology. This year's conference continued to build on many of the trends shown in SPRAT XVI; the use of new high-efficiency cells for commercial use and the development of novel array concepts such as Boeing's <b>Solar</b> <b>Tile</b> concept. In addition, new information was presented on space environmental interactions with solar arrays...|$|E
40|$|In 1998, a new {{failure mode}} for space solar arrays was discovered. A {{flowchart}} for this failure mode is presented. Since {{the discovery of}} this arc failure mode, many tactics {{have been used to}} defeat it. The arc thresholds and arc mitigation strategies must be determined in vacuum-plasma tank testing on Earth. Results from these tests must then be extrapolated to the space plasma environment. Thus, the test conditions on Earth must be adequate to reproduce the important aspects of the phenomenon in space. At Glenn Research Center, we have been testing solar arrays for their arc thresholds and sustained arcing thresholds. In this paper, we detail the test conditions for a specific set of tests-those aimed at qualifying the Boeing <b>Solar</b> <b>Tile</b> solar arrays to operate in space at very high voltages (300 V or more) ...|$|E
40|$|Among {{the main}} {{challenges}} of our century, {{the climate change}} and the need of diversification of the energy sources are of most importance. Renewable energies undoubtedly {{have an important role}} to play, photovoltaic (PV) electricity being especially well suited to face these energy challenges. However, the current integration of PV panels often comes without architectural consideration. In this context, the Archinsolar project [1] aims to develop a new generation of photovoltaic elements based on silicon thin films technologies (amorphous and micromorph), ultra-reliable and manufacturable at a very low cost, allowing a unique architectural integration, respectful of the built environment and overall landscape. Here we will present our new developments on innovative PV elements including colored PV panels and a <b>solar</b> <b>tile</b> using a composite back-structure. GENERAL CONTEXT The renewed debate on nuclear energy following the recent events in Japan, the numerous political decisions made in favor of the development of renewable energies as well as the attitude of the public, which is always more concerned about environmental issues, lead t...|$|E

40|$|During {{the last}} decades, the {{photovoltaic}} (PV) modules and their associated architectural materials {{are increasingly being}} incorporated into {{the construction of the}} building envelope such as façade, roof and skylights in the urban centers. This paper analyzes the-state-of-the-art of the PV elements and construction materials which are advertised as BIPV-products at the most important companies in the world. For this purpose 136 companies and 445 PV elements have been investigated and analyzed from a technical and architectural point of view. Also, the study has been divided into two main groups according to industry which producing the product: BIPV-Modules, which comes from the PV modules manufacturers and consist of standard PV-modules with some variations in its aesthetic features, support or dimensions; and PV-Constructions Elements, which consist of conventional constructive elements with architectural features intentionally manufactured for photovoltaic integration. In advance for conclusions, the <b>solar</b> <b>tile</b> is the most common PV-constructions element, the Si-crystalline is the most widely used PV technology, and the BIPV-urban furniture is the fastest growing market experienced in recent years. However, it is clear the absences of innovative elements which meet at the same time both the constructive purpose as the quality standards of PV technology...|$|E
25|$|Tesla, Inc. (formerly Tesla Motors) is an American automaker, {{energy storage}} company, and solar panel {{manufacturer}} based in Palo Alto, California. Founded in 2003, the company specializes in electric cars, lithium-ion battery energy storage, and residential photovoltaic panels (through the subsidiary company SolarCity). The additional products Tesla sells include the Tesla Powerwall and Powerpack batteries, solar panels and <b>solar</b> roof <b>tiles.</b>|$|R
50|$|Dow Chemical Company began {{producing}} <b>solar</b> roof <b>tiles</b> in 2005, {{and several}} other manufacturers followed suit. They are similar in design to conventional roof tiles but with a photovoltaic cell within in order to generate renewable electricity. A collaboration between the companies SolarCity and Tesla produced a hydrographically printed tile {{which appears to be}} a regular tile from street level but is transparent to sunlight when viewed straight on.|$|R
50|$|The 25000 sq ft {{facility}} was powered, in part, by {{a fuel cell}} and a micro turbine, which turned natural gas into electricity. In addition, the building's photovoltaic <b>solar</b> roof <b>tiles</b> harnessed the <b>solar</b> power generated by the sun to create useful energy. MAREC then used a nickel metal hydride battery system to store some of the energy produced by these sources for use during peak energy consumption periods.|$|R

The company also {{operates}} a Destination Charging program, under which shops, restaurants and other venues are offered fast chargers for their customers. Although Tesla operates a number of production and assembly plants, the company's most iconic facility is the Gigafactory 1 near Reno, Nevada, where Panasonic builds 21-70 cells for Tesla batteries. Tesla also manufactures the Tesla Powerwall, Powerpack batteries, solar panels (in varying form factors) and <b>solar</b> roof <b>tiles</b> for home and industry applications.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{technological}} {{combination of}} {{solar thermal systems}} with heat pumps {{continues to be a}} highly topical subject in the market of sustainable domestic hot water and space heating systems. Nonetheless, objective performance test methods are not yet common standard. In this context field tests with six different combined solar and heat pump systems installed in single- and smaller multi-family houses in Germany have been performed under real operating conditions by the ITW/TZS. In this paper a novel heating system comprising <b>solar</b> roof <b>tile</b> collectors and so-called geothermal energy baskets is presented in detail and in-situ monitoring results are shown and discussed...|$|R
50|$|An orbital layer {{has been}} added to Beyond Earth. Satellites {{launched}} around a faction's orbital layer provide bonuses to the tiles below them. For example if a player launches a <b>solar</b> collector, any <b>tile</b> below this collector will provide the player with an additional energy bonus. In the later game, some satellites can serve as weaponry or can help transport units across the map. To counter orbital units artillery style units can shoot them down.|$|R
5000|$|In the August 2016 {{earnings}} call, Elon Musk {{announced that}} Solar City would be introducing {{a new product}} where the photovoltaic electrical energy generating devices and system would make up an entire roof surface, rather than merely be the mounting of solar panels on an existing roof, stating [...] "It’s not a thing on a roof. It is the roof," [...] as solar energy systems have generally been designed and installed during {{the early decades of}} terrestrial solar power. Assorted styles of <b>solar</b> roof <b>tiles,</b> made of glass, were unveiled at Universal Studios' Colonial Street backlot street set in late October 2016. Also unveiled was the Tesla Powerwall 2, a home battery product designed to store surplus power, either from the tiles or from the grid. Consumer Reports compared the estimated economy of solar roofs to traditional roofing.|$|R
40|$|In our {{paper we}} explore the {{opportunity}} of combining luminescent solar concentrating (LSC) materials and crystalline PV solar cells in a new design for a roof tile by design-driven research on the energy performance of various configurations of the LSC PV device and on the aesthetic appeal in a roof construction. We present the roof tile in a system and executed optical modeling of the <b>solar</b> roof <b>tile</b> by MonteCarlo/ray-tracing simulations by PVtrace. We determined the range of appropriate values for thickness and dye concentration for the conceptual design of roof tile LSCs. It can be concluded that thickness of PMMA sheet material could best be {{in the range of}} 4 to 6 mm and the concentration of BASF Lumogen Red dye in between 80 and 1000 ppm. Because of aesthetic considerations however various concentration values may be used.

50|$|In December 2005, the Butler family {{sold the}} company to Matthew Galvez (an 81% shareholder) and James Nichols (a 19% shareholder) in a {{transaction}} financed by Frost Bank with a Small Business Administration guarantee on {{a portion of the}} acquisition financing. Around the time of the transfer, the primary products manufactured and sold by Elgin-Butler were glazed brick and large structural clay tile for use in school construction, transportation terminals such as subway stations and airports, stadiums, food processing plants, jails, multi-unit housing, restaurants, and other commercial uses. Elgin-Butler also made fire brick, fireplace liners and <b>solar</b> screen <b>tile</b> at its plant in Elgin, Texas. Following the sale of the company, Elgin-Butler’s introduced thin glazed brick as well as it's subsidiaries, McIntyre Tile Company, Inc. and Trikeenan Tile Works, manufactured glazed thin brick, and art tile at their respective plants in Healdsburg, California and Hornell, New York. McIntyre and Trikeenan’s glazed thin brick and art tile were almost exclusively used in commercial applications.|$|R

30|$|Restriction {{landscape}} raises several issues: {{in terms}} of policies, e.g. to what degree and how territory government tools accept the idea of cultural landscape; or from a disciplinary point of view, such as analysis, interpretation and settlement methods of a potential intervention on the land. Moreover, given the historical density and geographic variety of Italian territory where it could be enforced, {{it seems like it}} won’t make room (literally) for the integration of renewable energies and those transformations aimed at achieving neither environmental, nor economic or social sustainability objectives. On one hand, the denial of transformation or transformability risks condemning the land to develop a “museum-like” aspect, immediately evoking the age-old opposition between valorisation and preservation; 1 on the other, further possible interpretations generated by the static-conservative approach leave some doubts about efficiency {{in terms of}} temporal continuity, and produce a landscape representing a culturally controversial and contradictory society from the legislation systems’ perspective. Mitigation landscape, in particular, forms several design choices or the good practice of some regulation tools, manifesting itself in the guise of both visual concealment—an unhistorical but efficient compromise between aesthetics and performance 2 —and mimesis, whose results are disparate but often very close to a camouflage of forms and materials sometimes verging on grotesque. 3 Unfortunately, the technological innovation developed by component producers moves even in this kind of market, offering hybrid and poorly integrated solutions—technological fakes such as <b>solar</b> <b>tiles,</b> imitation slate slabs or solar panels disguised as roof windows, where the relation shape/function is disrupted to the benefit of kitsch. At the same time, the technological pastiche responds both to a deviation of taste and the heterogeneity between local regulation (building codes, colour plans, etc.) and regional or national laws (legislation on energy efficiency) or among different but often neighbouring territorial scopes. In this respect, regulations on the installation of solar panels in areas subject to landscape and environmental restriction (from the historic centre to the restricted buffer zones near drainage basins) are a perfect example. First they’ve been forbidden, then submitted to the superintendent’s opinion—with all the resulting consequences—and finally used when applying to a regional administrative court in order to define the priority of “the discrepancies with landscape’s peculiarities” or “the overriding public interest” deriving from low-impact energy production.|$|R
40|$|Most ancient or {{traditional}} buildings in Italy show steep-slope roofs covered by red clay tiles. As the rooms immediately below the roof are often inhabited in historical or densely urbanized centres, {{the combination of}} low <b>solar</b> reflectance of <b>tile</b> coverings and low thermal inertia of either wooden roof structures or sub-tile insulation panels makes summer overheating a major problem. The problem can be mitigated by using tiles coated with cool colours, that is colours with the same spectral response of clay tiles in the visible, but highly reflecting in the near infrared range, which includes {{more than half of}} solar radiation. Cool colours can yield the same visible aspect of common building surfaces, but higher solar reflectance. Studies aimed at developing cool colour tile coverings f{{or traditional}} Italian buildings have been started. A few coating solutions with the typical red terracotta colour have been produced and tested inthe laboratory,using easily available materials. The spectral response and the solar reflectance havebeen measured and compared with that of standard tiles...|$|R
40|$|An {{effective}} {{solution to}} summer overheating of buildings {{is provided by}} “cool roofs”. These are building coverings with high reflectance to solar radiation and high emittance in the infrared range. They have been investigated extensively in the U. S. A., where certification procedures have already been developed by independent bodies, and certified products are commercially available. Common cool roof products have white or very light colors. As a result, they are difficult to use in most ancient or traditional south-European buildings, which typically have steep-slope roofs covered by red clay tiles. On the other hand, {{in places like the}} historical centers of Italian and other Mediterranean cities the rooms immediately below the roof are often inhabited, so that the relatively low <b>solar</b> reflectance of <b>tile</b> coverings makes summer overheating a major problem. This can be effectively addressed by using tiles coated with “cool colors”, that is colors with the same spectral response of clay tiles in the visible, but highly reflecting in the near infrared range, which includes about half of solar radiation. Cool colors can yield the same visible aspect of common building surfaces, but much higher solar reflectance. In the aim of verifying the potential of cool color tile coverings, an investigation was started at the DIMeC. Materials for cool color coating were analyzed in the laboratory, verifying their radiation properties as a function of composition and pigment content. Prototypes of red roof tiles have been built using easily available materials with solar reflectance almost twice that of conventional tiles...|$|R
40|$|This research, {{carried out}} during the PhD in Materials Engineering, deals with the {{creation}} of layers, with different functionality, deposited on a ceramic substrate, to obtain photovoltaic cells for electricity production. The research activities are included in the project PRRIITT, Measure 4 (Development of Networks), Action A (Research and Technology Transfer Laboratories), Thematic reference 3 (Advanced materials applications development), co-financed by the Emilia Romagna Region, for the creation of CECERBENCH laboratory, which aims to develop "Tiles with a functionalised surface”. The innovation lies in the study of materials and in the development of technologies to achieve a "photovoltaic surface", directly in the tiles production process. The goal is to preserve the technical characteristics, and to make available new surfaces, exploiting renewable energy sources. The realization of Building Integrated PhotoVoltaic (BIPV) is nowadays a more and more spread tendency. The aims of the research are essentially linked to the need to diversify the actual ceramic tile production (which is strongly present in the Emilia Romagna Region), and to provide a higher added value to the <b>tiles.</b> <b>Solar</b> energy production is the primary objective of the functionalization, and has a relevant ecological impact, taking into account the overwhelming global energy demand. The specific activities of the PhD were carried out according to the achievement of scientific and technological objectives of CECERBENCH laboratory, and involved the collaboration in design solutions, to obtain the cells directly on the tiles surface. The author has managed personally a part of the research project. Layers with different features were made: - Electrically conductive layers, directly on the ceramic tiles surface; - Layers to obtain the photovoltaic functionality; - Electrically insulating, protective layers (double function). For each layer, the most suitable materials have been selected. Among the technical application, the screen printing was used. This technique, widely used in ceramics, has many application areas, including the electronics and photovoltaic industries. It is an inexpensive technique, easy to use in industrial production lines. The screen printing technique was therefore studied in depth by theoretical considerations, and through the use of rheological measurements...|$|R
