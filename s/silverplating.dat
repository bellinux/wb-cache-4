40|$|The {{status of}} the laser-assisted solar cell {{metallization}} processing is described. Metallo-organic silver films were spun-on by argon ion laser beam pyrolysis. The metallo-organic decomposition (MOD) film was spun-on an evaporated Ti/Pd film to produce tood adhesion. In a maskless process, the argon ion laser writes the contact pattern. The film is then built up to obtain the required conductivity using conventional <b>silverplating</b> process. The Ti/Pd film {{in the field is}} chemically etched using the plated silver film as the mask. The width of the contact pattern is determined by the power of the laser. Widths as thin as 20 microns were obtained using 0. 66 W of laser power. Cells fabricated with the 50 micron line widths of 4 ohm-cm floating zone (Fz) silicon-produced efficiencies of 16. 6 % (no passivation) which were equivalent to the best cells using conventional metallization/lithography and no passivation...|$|E
5|$|In 1945, a B-29 bomber cost $782,000. It cost $32,000 {{to upgrade}} an {{aircraft}} to <b>Silverplate</b> configuration, so {{the total cost}} of a <b>Silverplate</b> bomber was $814,000. The total cost of the 65 wartime <b>Silverplate</b> B-29s was therefore $53 million. Adding $7 million for logistics, this put the estimated cost of the <b>Silverplate</b> project at around $60 million.|$|R
500|$|The 509th {{transferred}} {{four of its}} 14 training <b>Silverplate</b> B-29s to the 216th AAF Base Unit in February 1945. In April {{the third}} modification increment of <b>Silverplates,</b> which would be their combat aircraft, began coming off the Martin-Omaha assembly line. These [...] "fly-away" [...] aircraft were equipped with fuel-injected engines, Curtiss Electric reversible-pitch propellers, pneumatic actuators for rapid opening and closing of bomb bay doors and other improvements. The remaining 17 <b>Silverplate</b> B-29s were placed in storage. Each bombardier completed at least 50 practice drops of inert pumpkin bombs before Tibbets declared his group combat-ready.|$|R
5|$|Seventeen {{production}} <b>Silverplate</b> aircraft {{were ordered}} in August 1944 {{to allow the}} 509th Composite Group to train {{with the type of}} aircraft they would have to fly in combat, and for the 216th Army Air Forces Base Unit to test bomb configurations. These were followed by 28 more aircraft that were ordered in February 1945 for operational use by the 509th Composite Group. This batch included the aircraft which were used in the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945. Including the Pullman B-29, a total of 46 <b>Silverplate</b> B-29s were produced during and after World War II. An additional 19 <b>Silverplate</b> B-29s were ordered in July 1945, which were delivered between {{the end of the war}} and the end of 1947. Thus, a total of 65 <b>Silverplate</b> B-29s were made.|$|R

5|$|The {{only other}} United States Air Force combat unit {{to use the}} <b>Silverplate</b> B-29 was the 97th Bombardment Wing at Biggs Air Force Base in El Paso, Texas. In mid-1949 it {{received}} 27 of the aircraft from the 509th Bombardment Wing when the latter transitioned to B-50D bombers. The re-equipment of the 97th Bombardment Wing {{was part of an}} expansion of the atomic strike force to ten wings during 1949. Within a year all were converted to TB-29 trainers. One other <b>Silverplate</b> B-29, on temporary assignment in the United Kingdom, was converted into a weather reconnaissance aircraft (WB-29) and transferred to the 9th Bombardment Wing at Travis Air Force Base in California. The last <b>Silverplate</b> B-29 in service as a nuclear weapons carrier was reassigned to another role in November 1951, ending <b>Silverplate</b> after nearly eight years.|$|R
25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} famous B-29s were the sixty-five {{examples}} of the <b>Silverplate</b> series, which were modified to drop atomic bombs. They were also stripped of all guns, except the tail ones, {{in order to have}} a lighter plane. The <b>Silverplate</b> aircraft were handpicked by Lieutenant Colonel Paul W. Tibbets for the mission, straight off the assembly line at the Omaha plant that was to become Offutt Air Force Base. The <b>Silverplate</b> bombers differed from other B-29s then in service by having fuel injection and reversible props. Pilot Charles Sweeney credits the reversible props for saving Bockscar after making an emergency landing on Okinawa following the Nagasaki bombing.|$|R

It was originally equipped with five <b>Silverplate</b> B-29s, three flight crews and five maintenance crews. The Flight Test Section was commanded Major Clyde [...] "Stan" [...] Shields, who had piloted the [...] "Pullman" [...] prototype <b>Silverplate</b> B-29 in the initial drop tests at Muroc Army Air Field in February and March 1944. The Flight Test Section received five new <b>Silverplate</b> B-29s in April 1945. It retired three of its aircraft, and kept another three, leaving it with eight test aircraft.|$|R

Martin-Omaha produced 57 <b>Silverplate</b> B-29s. The other 8 were built by Boeing-Wichita. Of these 65 bombers, 31 were eventually converted to other configurations, 16 were placed in storage and later scrapped, and 12 were lost in accidents (including four of the Tinian bombers). The pair of historic weapons delivery aircraft, named Enola Gay and Bockscar, are today displayed in museums.|$|R

The British F-type bomb release and G-type attachment were installed, along with dual electrical and mechanical bomb release mechanisms. Early model B-29s were plagued by a host of engine problems, and the early <b>Silverplate</b> bombers were no exception. One was written off after being badly damaged {{as a result of an}} engine fire in February 1945. The fuel-injected Wright R-3350-41 engines in the later model bombers delivered in July and August 1945 were greatly improved and far more reliable.
