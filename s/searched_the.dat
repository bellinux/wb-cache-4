As Kiko traveled {{parallel to the}} coast, heavy rain affected the region for two days. In Kiko's rough seas {{off the coast of}} Mexico, a ship capsized with twenty-fivepassengers and crew. Continued effects from Kiko hampered rescue efforts, forcing officials to call off the rescue attempt.

Lamb was arrested at 15:30 on 26 June and charged with the capital murder of Edith Chaykoski. Under the terms of Canadian law at that time, he faced a mandatory death penalty if convicted. When Woloch's injuries also proved fatal at 14:45 on 11 July 1966, his murder was added to Lamb's charge.|$|E

They <b>searched</b> <b>the</b> University of Rennes and found some documents there on 9 August. On 11 August they reached the homes of Joliot-Curie, Francis Perrin, and Pierre Auger in the L'Arcouest area.

They {{were unable to}} find any, but on August 28 they arrested 100 local citizens. Most were released, although some were taken to Fort Mifflin. The soldiers continued heading into the northernmost reaches of the Fishing Creek watershed. Unable to find any evidence of a conspiracy, they returned to Bloomsburg and remained in the county until December 1864. The last of the prisoners were released from Fort Mifflin several months after their arrest.|$|E

A warrant for Lucan's arrest, to answer charges of murdering Sandra Rivett, and attempting to murder his wife, was issued on Tuesday 12November 1974.

The problem investigated in this study was the lack of a valid and reliable way to determine the effectiveness of students in <b>searching</b> <b>the</b> Internet, generally, and the effectiveness of the Palm Beach Community College 2 ̆ 7 s West Campus (PBCCWC) students, specifically.

This study can be characterized as quantitative-qualitative, and be categorized as a descriptive-phenomenological study. The methodology included creating an Internet Search Test (IST) as an evaluative instrument to differentiate between the PBCCWC students who can and cannot <b>search</b> <b>the</b> Internet effectively.
