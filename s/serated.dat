40|$|Among {{the highly}} {{fragrant}} rose species, R. centifolia, R. gruss an teplitz and R. borboniana have high commercial importance and value added potential. However, their large plant size, small flower size {{and lack of}} diversification in color detracts these species from recent trends of floriculture market. Therefore, this study aimed to produce reduced-stature plants and to improve flower color and size through in vitro mutagenesis using gamma irradiation, colchicine and somaclonal variation techniques. For this purpose cultures of R. gruss an teplitz, R. centifolia and R. borboniana were established by disinfestation of shoot tips with 0. 1 % HgCl 2. It gave maximum survival percentage with limited occurrence of bacterial and fungal contamination. BAP @ 1. 0 mgl- 1 and IBA @ 0. 50 mgl- 1 {{found to be the}} optimum concentrations for shoot proliferation and in vitro rooting respectively. Micropropagated shoot tips of R. gruss an teplitz, R. centifolia and R. borboniana were irradiated with gamma rays upto 120 Gy. Minimum survival percentage was recorded at 60, 30 and 50 Gy respectively. Above these doses of gamma rays there was a complete mortality. Moreover, plant height was decreased with reduction in color and size of flowers. During selection variegated, pink color and abnormal shape flowers were also found in R. gruss an teplitz. Influence of colchicine was found to be species specific and its response showed significant results. Shoot tips treated with colchicine solutions for three hours resulted in minimum survival percentage at the maximum level of colchicine (1100 mgl- 1). However, plant height was maximum in the plants of R. gruss an teplitz, R. centifolia and R. borboniana treated with colchicine solution at 900 and 1100 mgl- 1. Moreover, treated R. gruss an teplitz and R. centifolia produced large size flowers with more intensification of color. This technique resulted in generation of variegated, <b>serated</b> petals and abnormal shape flowers in R. gruss an teplitz. In another set of trial micropropagated shoot tip explants were incubated for 5, 7 and 11 days in MS media fortified with different concentrations of colchicine. It resulted minimum survival percentage with the increase in the colchicine concentration and incubation period. However, plant height, flower size and intensification of flower color were increased with increase in the concentration of colchicine upto 450 mgl- 1 with incubation period of 11 days. Use of colchicine in medium also yielded variegated flowers in R. gruss an teplitz species. Plants of R. gruss an teplitz obtained through regeneration via callus exhibited significant somaclonal variation than other regeneration methods. Genetic variation found in rose species was confirmed through RAPD analysis. Now these mutants need to be screened {{over the next few years}} for floral and vegetative characteristics. This study adds to the ongoing efforts to increase diversification in plant height, flower color and size of rose flowers. The outcome of the study will be helpful for future studies regarding induction of mutations in rose species...|$|E

40|$|Materials {{and methods}} Larvae were staged {{with respect to}} the {{development}} of the anterior spiracle and associated tracheal system [S 1]. Late second instar is defined as the stage, before the moult, at which the spiracle of the third larval instar can be seen wrapped around that of the second instar (characterized by a knob-like structure at the tip). At this stage, one can see a characteristic double-hose structure in the position of the spira-cle. If, instead of this ‘double spiracle’, one could only see the knob, the larva was deemed to be second instar. If the clear and diverse structure of the anterior spiracle was seen, the larva was deemed to be third instar. All of our preparations of early discs were based on these crite-ria, which were also used in Williams et al. [S 2]. Antibody stainings were performed with standards antibodies against <b>Serate</b> (provided by E. Knust), LacZ and Wingless (provided by S. Cohen).

30|$|A {{significant}} {{challenge in}} the fuel ethanol production is acute and chronic bacterial contamination, since the incoming substrate might contain microorganisms and the fermentation is carried out in non-aseptic conditions (Skinner and Leathers 2004). Bacterial contamination is predominantly due to lactic and acetic acid bacteria leading to loss of fermentable sugars and micronutrients, increased by-product formation (lactic acid and acetic acid), reduced ethanol yields and productivities and stuck fermentations (Beckner et al. 2011; Bischoff et al. 2009). Bacterial contamination has been studied extensively (Bischoff et al. 2009; Skinner and Leathers 2004) and several antimicrobial strategies, including usage of antibiotics, have been adopted in the first generation bioethanol production (Muthaiyan et al. 2011). These methods are expensive and some are environmentally invasive when used in large-scale fermentations (Muthaiyan et al. 2011). Contamination might pose a bigger threat to lignocellulosic ethanol owing to the versatility in sugar substrates. As Saccharomyces cerevisiae displays glucose repression, it takes longer time to assimilate other sugars including xylose and arabinose. Thus any contamination {{might be able to}} utilise the other sugars swiftly and more efficiently than S. cerevisiae leading to reduction in ethanol production. Several {{attempts have been made to}} study and control bacterial contamination in lignocellulosic ethanol production including: (1) adding NaCl and ethanol to wood hydrolysate (Albers et al. 2011), (2) high solid loading in simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) (Ishola et al. 2013), (3) usage of an antibiotic like gentamicin and biomass autoclaving (<b>Serate</b> et al. 2015), and (4) usage of bacteriophages (Worley-Morse et al. 2015). These strategies encounter challenges including: (1) additional cost and need for extensive fine tuning and testing of concentrations of NaCl and ethanol (Albers et al. 2011), (2) loss of cell viability due to mechanical stress caused by solid particles in high cell loading (Ishola et al. 2013), (3) cost and environmental challenges posed by gentamicin, energy expenditure and formation of inhibitors due to autoclaving (<b>Serate</b> et al. 2015), and (4) rise of bacteriophage-insensitive mutants and possibilities of gene transfer from bacteriophages to yeast (Worley-Morse et al. 2015). One of the potentially scalable and economically feasible solutions to control bacterial contamination is to run the lignocellulosic fermentation at low pH, around pH 4 where the growth and viability of bacteria are drastically reduced (Kádár et al. 2007). Additionally, yeast cells are recycled in several commercial ethanol production processes up to 6  months to reduce fermentation time and cost of yeast propagation, increasing the chances of contamination (Basso et al. 2011). To prevent contamination, yeast cells are treated with dilute sulphuric acid (H 2 SO 4) at pH between pH 1.8 and 2.5 for 1 – 2  h (Basso et al. 2011), which results in reduction in intracellular pH (Beales 2004), yeast viability and low ethanol yield (De Melo et al. 2010). Hence, it might be efficient to develop S. cerevisiae strains tolerant to lower pH induced by inorganic acids.|$|R
