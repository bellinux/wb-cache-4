5|$|Andrea Anders as Linda Katherine Zwordling: Linda is {{a tester}} {{in one of}} Veridian's departments. She finds herself very {{attracted}} to Ted, but maintains other relationships and reminds Ted repeatedly that he has rejected {{the idea of a}} workplace romance with her. <b>She</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a bit of an outsider to the corporate culture. Often she demands that Ted consider the horrible ramifications of the company policies or activities. Her relationship with the scientists is strained by her rejection of the weird things they do in the name of science. Despite this, she finds herself increasingly looking at Veronica as a mentor as the series progresses.|$|E

25|$|<b>She</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{friends with}} Yuki Fujitsuka who {{authored}} Toremoto Beat. Fujitsuka's name {{came up in}} Kaichō wa Maid-sama!s 5th volume during the closing credits and Fujiwara also listed her as 'Yuki-sama' in her official website. The author and Yuki Fujitsuka both won the same category in the 31st Hakusensha Athena Newcomers' Awards in year 2006.|$|E
25|$|Midori is an {{energetic}} girl in Tatsuya's class {{who has been}} one of his classmates since their first year in high school. She is the clarinet leader in the concert band at her school. <b>She</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> very desperate for Tatsuya's odd sign of affection or even perhaps noticing her once in a while. She is only available as a love interest in the PS2 and PSP versions of the game, and is otherwise a minor character.|$|E
25|$|They {{continued}} with The Yellow Canary (1943), co-starring Richard Greene and Margaret Rutherford. In this spy story, Neagle plays a German-sympathiser (or {{at least that}} is what <b>she</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> at first) who is forced to go to Canada for her own safety. In reality, of course, she's working as an undercover agent out to expose a plot to blow up Halifax Harbour in Nova Scotia. The Yellow Canary received positive comment for its atmospheric recreation of wartime conditions.|$|E

25|$|The blue-haired {{daughter}} of Soichi and Kaya Sasamiya, Saya is Ayato's childhood friend. She moved abroad {{six years ago}} due to her father's career. <b>She</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an air-headed stoic who has trouble {{waking up in the}} morning and is directionally-challenged. She uses a 38th generation Lux grenade launcher Helnekrom but later switches to a type 41 Gleaming Form - twin particle guns Waidenholt and Type 34 wave Motion heavy artillery Ark Van Ders for the Phoenix. Like Kirin, she enters the Phoenix for her father's sake.|$|E
25|$|The {{candles on}} a {{birthday}} cake in one memory indicate {{that she is}} about five years old when first introduced. By {{the time of the}} Dream story arc, she claims to be 902. In Sailor Moon Crystal, it is stated clearly that she is 900 years old. <b>She</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the equivalent of a 7 or 8 year old when she returns later. In the manga, after the Infinity Dream story arc, its mentioned she is in second grade; in the Stars story arc, she is in sixth grade; in the Sailor Moon Parallel story arc, she is in the ninth grade.|$|E
25|$|Kirin is a silver-haired {{student and}} a student at Seidoukan Academy. She is a shy and quiet girl who becomes the academy's top student as a 13-year-old and has not lost to anyone until Ayato {{challenges}} her a second time. Their first duel happens because Ayato stops her uncle Kouichiro from hitting her and challenges him to a duel. Kirin is his opponent and she uses her lightning speed to defeat him. <b>She</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> under Kouichiro's influence but her friendship with Ayato allows her to break free and Kirin eventually tells Kouichiro {{that she wants to}} decide things for herself from now on. Kirin enters the Phoenix to clear her father's name and release him. She does not have a personal lux but rather carries her katana called Senbakiri which often makes her greatly marveled by others as she tops the former top student position just by using a Senbakiri. She and Saya team up for the Phoenix tournament but they lose to Arlequint's Ardi and Rimsi in the semifinal. After Ayato's final match, she also attempts to vie for Ayato's attention by squeezing her chest on his head and declares she would make onigiri (rice balls) for him every day.|$|E

500|$|In the {{interactive}} gallery , the Queen appears alongside Maleficent and Judge Frollo in the villains' {{act of the}} show, where <b>she</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{the leader of the}} trio. On the cruise ship Disney Fantasy, the Queen, appearing with her raven, is one of the seven suspects (and sometimes the culprit) in {{the interactive}} gallery Midship Detective Agency's story [...] "The Case of The Plundered Paintings".|$|E
500|$|Most critics {{considered}} Barbery's narrative {{presentation to}} be essayistic; the individual chapters are {{more akin to}} essays than fiction, as The New York Times Caryn James expresses it, [...] "so carefully build in explanations for the literary and philosophical references that <b>she</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> assessing what a mass audience needs". The early pages of the novel contain a short critique by Renée {{on the topic of}} phenomenology.|$|E
500|$|... "I'm {{very proud}} of the book and I'm very {{disappointed}} at Madonna's reaction. I think the problem is that she wants control over everything – that's one of the themes of the book, and secondly <b>she</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> almost disowning her past at the moment. She's reinventing herself as an upper-class, English aristocrat, and the former vegetarian who now goes hunting, fishing and shooting. My door's always open – Madonna's welcome to my house for a cup of tea.|$|E

The camera follows Squires' gun to his desk drawer and we're kept aware of its presence thanks to Nina and Squires' [...] "If I’d shot you, here in the dark/With an empty gun? Good luck" [...] exchange. Nina is shown drinking from the poisoned cup one of two times she admiringly calls Squires [...] "devious" [...] (a hint at her true feelings about him) and once again when she emphasises the word [...] "plan". While Squires is telling the story of the Sphinx and <b>she</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> gazing at the statue of it, she's actually looking at the photograph of her brother on display directly below.|$|E
500|$|In [...] "Just a Perfect Day" [...] Maria finds Maddy stabbed and {{bleeding}} {{out on the}} floor in the Keller ward toilets. She immediately starts trying to resuscitate her. Linden rushes in to help. Three weeks have passed since Maddy was stabbed. She is in Holby Care and we hear her thinking about a letter she has written to her sister Hannah. <b>She</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> fully recovered and is desperately trying to get back to work and be interviewed for the ST3 job. Ric held the interviews open until Maddy was well enough, and today she's going to make sure she gets the job. Maddy's going to show them that they can throw anything at her and she'll cope...even after being stabbed. Linden wants Maddy to be careful and take things easy, as she nearly died, but Maddy wants to get back to work.|$|E
500|$|The Virgin {{holds an}} {{innovative}} and unusual position. <b>She</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> either rising or swooning as if having lost her balance, a divergence from her conventional seated or kneeling pose. Blum believes [...] "one may search in vain in other Netherlandish Annunciation panels {{of the fifteenth}} century of a Virgin positioned as she is here". Art historian Penny Jolly suggests the painting shows a birthing position, a motif van der Weyden experimented with in the Seven Sacraments Altarpiece, where the Virgin's collapse results in a childbirth-like posture, and with the Descent from the Cross, in which Mary Magdalen bends and crouches– similar to the position Memling's Magdalen assumes in his [...] Flanking the Virgin, and holding her, are two attendant angels. The one to the left lifts the Virgin's robe while the other gazes at the viewer, [...] "soliciting our response", according to Ainsworth. Both are small-statured, solemn, and according to Blum, in mood [...] "comparable to that of Gabriel." [...] Other than the presence of the angels, Memling shows a typical upper-merchant-class 15th-century Flemish bedchamber.|$|E
60|$|She {{closed her}} parasol {{and leaned back}} in her corner of the seat. <b>She</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{studying}} his expression.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{interested}} in Arthur, {{and asked him}} a great many questions, and all her questions were intelligent.|$|R

500|$|Ramirez {{described}} her character {{as someone who}} [...] "appears {{to be a certain}} way, but has some very complex issues going on behind the scenes. <b>She</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a very strong personality, someone who really believes in herself and has worked very hard to get where she is. She's very competitive but does have a sense of self, so she doesn't need to win all the time." [...] At Torres' initial appearance on the show, she was disliked by fans, due to her {{getting in the way of}} O'Malley and Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo)'s relationship. When asked of this, Ramirez said: [...] "You do run across a lot of people who are extremely invested in that story line. Obviously, I've heard some negative stuff." [...] The end of the show's fourth season saw Torres grow closer to cardiothoracic surgeon Erica Hahn, in a relationship referred to by the portmanteau [...] "Eri-Cal" [...] and later [...] "Callica" [...] by Michael Ausiello of Entertainment Weekly. Rhimes stated that: [...] "Callie and Erica have an undeniable chemistry, and watching the story unfold is something the writers are looking forward to. I wanted to illuminate their relationship in the same way we do all relationships on the show— it will be funny, sweet, honest, and a little bit dirty." ...|$|E
500|$|Lawrence played Serena Pemberton in Susanne Bier's depression-era drama Serena (2014), {{based on}} the novel of the same name by Ron Rash. In the film, she and her husband George (portrayed by Bradley Cooper) are a married couple who become {{involved}} in criminal activities after realizing that they cannot bear children. The project was filmed in 2012, and was released in 2014 to poor reviews. Lawrence then reprised the role of Mystique in , which served as a sequel to both [...] (2006) and X-Men: First Class (2011). The film received positive reviews and grossed $748.1 million worldwide, becoming the highest-grossing film in the X-Men series to that point. Justin Chang of Variety praised her look in the film but thought that she had little to do but [...] "glower, snarl and let the f/x artists do their thing". Lawrence's next two releases were in the final parts of The Hunger Games film series, [...] (2014) and [...] (2015). For the musical score of the former film, she sang the song [...] "The Hanging Tree", which charted on multiple international singles charts. In a review of the final film in the series, Manohla Dargis of The New York Times drew similarities between her rise to stardom and Everdeen's journey as a rebel leader, writing: [...] "Lawrence now inhabits the role as effortlessly as breathing, partly because, like all great stars, <b>she</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> playing a version of her 'real' self". Both films earned more than $650 million worldwide.|$|E
500|$|... "Hair" [...] has {{received}} mostly positive reviews. An hour before starting the final leg of The Monster Ball Tour, Gaga sent four tracks to Rolling Stone, including [...] "Scheiße", [...] "You and I", and [...] "The Edge of Glory", for a preview. Matthew Perpetua wrote a positive review of [...] "Hair", describing it as another inspirational {{song in the}} mold of [...] "Born This Way", but {{felt that it was}} a bit weirder. Perpetua concluded the review by jokingly adding that the song will become [...] "n anthem for salons everywhere." [...] Jody Rosen from the same publication felt that [...] "although Gaga is not the first singer to create a connection between self-esteem and liberation to free-flowing coiffure, <b>she</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the most committed to the idea." [...] Dan Martin from NME classified [...] "Hair" [...] as an empowerment anthem, using the [...] "simple image of the wind blowing through a person’s hair to illuminate the album’s Love-Yourself-And-Let-It-All-Hang-Out message way more effectively than the title track. It trumps it once again by being quite the gayest thing you will ever hear for a long time." [...] Tim Jonze from The Guardian felt that the message of [...] "Hair" [...] was not particularly a new one, since the 60's musical Hair also preached the same message. Although he described some of the lyrics as [...] "trite", Jonze opined that [...] "these weaknesses can also be strengths, and there's something admirable about the way the [...] address confused teenagers in search of their identity." [...] Writing for The Vancouver Sun, Leah Collins described the song as [...] "a pumping anthem designed to pump up your follicles with pride." [...] She added that the overall feel of the song was that of retro dance music.|$|E
