The sediment from these sources flowed along rivers into a perennial lake originating interbedded lacustrine, alluvial and fluvial sediments at the time of Arcovenator, when the climate was warm, subhumid with marked seasons.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to equip engineering geology with a new, independent tool of determination of zones of potential hazard in the linear direction in order to assess the influence induced by underground coal mining on future development. Currently, geodetic polygons, maintained by mining companies, are used to monitor subsidence and their evaluation results in how mining damage is assessed. However, the problem lies in the fact that the mining company is both the authority to monitor the conditions as well as the entity that compensates mining damage on buildings. The aspect of novelty in the paper is the proposed exploitation of regular geodetic monitoring of roads as an independent tool in the determination of zones of hazard in foundation engineering. The geodetic monitoring is carried out because of road maintenance in <b>subsidence</b> <b>basins.</b> However, so far, such monitoring has not been used to identify ground deformation parameters, on the basis of which building site categories could be determined and that could help to distinguish the zones of potential hazard before any buildings are constructed in <b>subsidence</b> <b>basins.</b> In the study area, a 9 -year geodetic measuring identified radically altered conditions, i. e., from more suitable building site group (category V— 87 %) in the actual year of monitoring to less suitable ones (categories I and II— 34 %) actual year. This methodology was found to be valid generally and may be applied in areas with <b>subsidence</b> <b>basins</b> induced by deep coal mining worldwide. Web of Science 7531044103...|$|R
40|$|Mardels, small closed depressions, are {{distinctive}} landforms on the Luxembourger Gutland plateau. In {{the present}} landscape most mardels are shallow fens, filled with colluvial sediments. The genesis of mardels {{has been studied}} intensively, inside and outside Luxembourg. Some researchers suggested a natural development and consider mardels as <b>subsidence</b> <b>basins</b> due to subsurface solution of gypsum veins, other researchers suggested cultural causes and consider mardels as prehistorical quarries. In the Gutland, mardels occur on various substrates. Mardels on the Strassen marls (li 3) are abandoned quarries, related to clay excavation in Roman Time. Mardels on the Luxembourger sandstone (li 2) are sinkholes, related to joint patterns in the sandstone formation.

40|$|The paper {{analyses}} the anthropogenic {{change in}} water {{bodies in the}} southern part of the Silesian Upland as exemplified by the town of Knurów. The assessment was based on topographic maps from the years 1827 - 1828, 1928 - 1936, 1960 and 1993, and on a 2011 orthophotomap. The cartographic materials used were processed as required for analysis purposes. Maps were calibrated in the Quantum GIS program on the basis of map corner coordinates and using the common points method. In Knurów, four main types of water bodies were distinguished with respect to their origins: reservoirs impounded by dams, flooded mineral workings, industrial water bodies and water bodies in <b>subsidence</b> <b>basins</b> and hollows. Historically, the first water bodies to appear were reservoirs impounded by dams, which dominated until the 1930 s. They later fell into disuse and were completely dismantled. Water bodies in mineral workings formed in the early 20 th century and were associated with the excavation of raw materials for producing bricks. The period of their greatest significance were the 1960 s, when they constituted slightly more than 46 % of water bodies in total and accounted for nearly 40 % of overall surface area. At the end of the 19 th and at the beginning of the 20 th century, industrial reservoirs began to appear. Within the town of Knurów, those were sedimentation tanks that held mine water, washery effluent, backfill and cooling water, fire-fighting water pools and tanks, tanks at sewage treatment plants, industrial water tanks and others. Presently, these account for 41. 4 % (29) of the total number of water bodies and have a total surface area of 32. 0 ha (25, 2 %). Within the study area, water bodies in <b>subsidence</b> <b>basins</b> and hollows only began to form in the second half of the 20 th century.

5000|$|The northeastern active fold belt of Iran, the Kopet Dagh, {{is formed}} on the Hercynian metamorphosed {{basement}} at the southwestern {{margin of the}} Turan Platform. The belt is composed of about 10 kilometres of Mesozoic and Tertiary sediments (mostly carbonates) and, like the Zagros, was folded into long linear northwest-southeast trending folds during the last phase of the Alpine Orogeny, in the Miocene and Plio-Pleistocene time. No magmatic rocks are exposed in Kopet Dagh except {{for those in the}} basement in the Aghdarband and some Triassic basic dikes. This basin was located in the northeastern Iran. From Middle Jurassic, it was covered with a vast continental shelf sea. In this period of time and due to transgression as well as rapid <b>subsidence</b> <b>basin,</b> the western part became deeper. In this basin, a thick sequence of continuous marine and continental sediments was deposited (about 10 km). No major sedimentary gap or volcanic activities during Jurassic to Miocene have ever been reported. This sedimentary complex provides suitable conditions for accumulation of hydrocarbons. Kopet Dagh sedimentary rocks were placed in their current position due to uplifting {{at the end of the}} Miocene. The Kopet Dag Range, itself, is made chiefly of Cretaceous rocks with a smaller portion of Jurassic rocks in the southeastern parts. The mountains were mainly formed in the Miocene during the Alpine orogeny. As the Tethys Sea was closed and the Arabian Plate collided with the Iranian Plate and was pushed against it, and with the clockwise rotation of the Eurasian Plate towards the Iranian Plate and their final collision, the Iranian Plate was pressed against the Turan Platform. This collision folded the entire rocks that had been deposited in this geosyncline or basin from the Jurassic to the Miocene and formed the Kopet Dag Mountains.|$|E

Carbonate occurrences within the upper Miocene-Pliocene deposits forming the <b>subsidence</b> <b>basins</b> surrounded by the Kırşehir massive, are described as caliche. These caliche deposits in the alluvial fan-meandering river and lacustrine environments are found in three different zones. In the measured, sections, conglomerate comprises the basement and is overlain by a transition zone made of sandy mudstone (Zone I). Above them is the rarely nodular carbonaceous zone with horizontal and vertical positions in the reddish mudstone-siltstone (Zone II). Finally, laminated caliche (calcrite) comprises the upper most part (Zone III). Carbonates in the basement, country rocks, and in the soil are dissolved in the acidic environment and become a solution saturated with calcium bicarbonate. This solution is transported to the sediments and capillary rises through the sediments during arid-semi arid seasons.

Here there was the most extensive underground exploitation of black coal in the north-east of the Czech Republic.

The two CSM and Paskov mine localities {{on the edge of the}} <b>subsidence</b> <b>basin</b> were selected for this study, since they could not have been affected by mining in neighbouring mines. On the grounds of the long-term levelling monitoring of points on the surface which started prior to mining, the horizontal distance between the mined out area and the undisturbed ground surface was identified. The impact of limit angle on the surface was calculated by means of the horizontal distance and the established mining depth. Such identified actual limit angles reached the values of 36 ° at the CSM Mine and 25 ° for the Paskov Mine. The calculated values are significantly lower when compared with the currently applied empirical values of 57 ° for the CSM Mine and 56 ° for the Paskov Mine. This means that the extent of the undermining effects is unambiguously wider by 611 m at the CSM Mine and by 883 m at the Paskov Mine. This study thus establishes the existence of a significantly vaster area influenced by coal deep mining than previously expected. The identified facts lead to the conclusion that regular revisions and follow-up updates of the empirically determined parameters are recommended. Web of Science 1243 - 413813...|$|E
