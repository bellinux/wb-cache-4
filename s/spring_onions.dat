40|$|Bio-concentration of {{elements}} such as Mo, As, Se, Fe, Cu, Zn, Ni and Pb was analyzed in <b>spring</b> <b>onion</b> (Allium fistulosum L.) in three different locations of central Punjab, Pakistan. At location GW, relatively low level of hazardous elements was found in <b>spring</b> <b>onion,</b> suggesting that groundwater is a safe source of water for irrigating food crops. The pH of soil at wastewater irrigation was found less acidic (pH 7. 4) than the other sites. The range of concentration in the different samples of <b>spring</b> <b>onion</b> was as follows: 6. 15 – 8. 16  mg kg− 1 for Mo, 2. 77 – 4. 28  mg kg− 1 for As, 0. 395 – 0. 705  mg kg− 1 for Se, 36. 73 – 48. 17  mg kg− 1 for Fe, 10. 58 – 16. 26  mg kg− 1 for Cu, 28. 87 – 39. 79  mg kg− 1 for Zn, 6. 66 – 8. 75  mg kg− 1 for Ni and 4. 33 – 6. 09  mg kg− 1 for Pb, respectively. High bio-concentration of Zn (15. 37) from soil to <b>spring</b> <b>onion</b> was found at canal water irrigated location. The estimated daily intake of metal for <b>spring</b> <b>onion</b> was less, but the health risk index was higher than 1 for Mo, As, Cu, Pb and Ni, respectively. This was due to higher proportion of <b>spring</b> <b>onion</b> in diet, which consequently increased the health risk index for metals. Therefore, it is recommended to avoid growing vegetables in untreated urban and rural wastewater containing elevated amounts of metals...|$|R

He incorporated raw vegetables such as cucumbers, purple artichokes, green peppers, fava beans, <b>spring</b> <b>onions,</b> black olives, basil and garlic, but no lettuce or vinegar. According to Rowley Leigh, Médecin believed that salade niçoise [...] "was {{a product of the}} sun and had to be vibrant with the crisp, sweet flavours of the vegetables of the Midi."
