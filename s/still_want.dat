5|$|Back in Scranton, Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) and Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) {{are both}} trying to sell girl scout cookies for their daughters. When Toby's {{requests}} clash with Darryl's, Darryl tells him they need their own sections of the office to sell {{to in order to}} not interfere with each other. Darryl takes accounting while Toby gets every other section. Darryl asks for accounting because Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) buys more cookies than everyone else put together. Toby eventually realizes Darryl's plan and the two end up fighting over who sells Kevin cookies, with Kevin coming up with absurd competition ideas. After doing a song and dance for Kevin, Kevin still can not make up his mind, so Darryl and Toby contemplate giving up until Kevin mentions he plans to buy hundreds of boxes of cookies, at which point continue the competition. They finally give up for good when Kevin wants to ride them like a pony, citing they <b>still</b> <b>want</b> to maintain their dignity and will not go beyond the limit to what they would do for their daughters.

She wants more from him (children), while he is happy just the way they are. They eventually break up. Robin wants to be a mother and decides to be a single mom. She and her friend, Dr. Kelly Lee (Minae Noji), put a list of possible sperm donors together. Robin picks people in Port Charles, because she feels that they have redeeming qualities she will like to pass on to her child, and does not like the idea of her child's father being a stranger. On November 30, 2007, Patrick tells Robin that he still loves and misses her. He just wants them to be together again and asks her to table the discussion of children for a year, and while she has stated that she has never been happier than when she was with him, she knows nothing would be different in a year - she would <b>still</b> <b>want</b> kids and he would not, to which he sadly replies that she is probably right, {{but it would have been}} a great year.|$|E

He would continue to occasionally substitute for Avory in the studio and play on several of the Kinks' early singles, including the early hits [...] "You Really Got Me", [...] "All Day and All of the Night" [...] and [...] "Tired of Waiting for You".

500|$|As such, {{executive}} producer and writer Russell T Davies {{had to come}} up with a story that had a good reason to keep the Doctor and Rose out.

Davies described the episode, [...] "It's an experimental script. Not so experimental that people will run away screaming from Saturday-night BBC1, because you can experiment too much.

But just as you think you know everything this programme can do, this puts a little bit of spin on it." [...] The episode had the working title of [...] "I Love the Doctor". The acronym [...] "LINDA" [...] was previously used on the British children's television programme Why Don't You?, which featured the [...] "Liverpool Investigation 'N' Detective Agency". Russell T Davies worked on the series for some years.|$|E

500|$|Sean Hayes {{was cast}} {{in the role of}} Jack.

Even though Hayes enjoyed the script when he read it, he threw it away as {{he did not want to}} spend money on a plane ticket to Los Angeles for the audition. However, a few weeks later when Hayes was in Los Angeles, he was sent the script again and decided to try out for the audition. If asked if he regrets accepting the role, Hayes said: [...] "If you're truly an actor, in the long run... I don't know that I would have done it either. I think of all the things that I <b>still</b> <b>want</b> to do, and I don't know if I'll get to do them."

500|$|Though Reitman {{has claimed}} in countless {{interviews}} {{that he wrote}} the parts specifically for George Clooney, Vera Farmiga, Anna Kendrick, Jason Bateman, Danny McBride, Melanie Lynskey, Amy Morton, Sam Elliott and Zach Galifianakis, some of the actors publicly stated their confusion in Reitman's assertion, if only because they knew he was meeting with other actors all along including his choice to fill his last lead role with Ellen Page (who starred in Reitman's previous film Juno) for the part that Kendrick ultimately played. On the part played by Farmiga, he cited her ability to walk {{a fine line between}} aggressiveness and femininity. On Kendrick, Reitman cited that he was inspired by her performance in Rocket Science. On Clooney, he said, [...] "If you're going to make a movie about a guy who fires people for a living and you <b>still</b> <b>want</b> to like him, that actor better be damn charming and I don't think there's a more charming actor alive than George Clooney. I was very lucky he said yes." [...] Reitman said, on the B.S. Report with Bill Simmons, that he considered Steve Martin for the part if Clooney declined the role. Reitman said that he would have changed the movie with Martin and given Martin [...] "his Lost in Translation." ...|$|E

It was confirmed that Jenny would still appear throughout the season in a [...] "flashback" [...] format. The first episode of the final season starts with Jenny's murder. However the final series focuses on the events leading up to her death. Chaiken revealed that each episode would focus and tease with another motive. She described how it would play out, stating: [...] "There's one character {{at the beginning of each}} show who comes forward with the motive of the moment. This would be my reason for killing Jenny." [...] The storyline was described as a [...] "sub-plot" [...] which would define the final season, but not [...] "overpower" [...] it. However, when the final episode aired there was no reveal to who killed Jenny. Showtime released a mini-series titled [...] "Interrogation Tapes" [...] online, via the official website. Each video featured a fellow character being interviewed over the death of Jenny - although the killer was still not revealed. Kate Aurthur of Los Angeles Times questioned if viewers would <b>still</b> <b>want</b> to watch the season after Jenny is killed. New York later gave a large amount of praise to Jenny commenting: [...] "Jenny Schecter is The L Word, and the death of her is the death of the show." [...] Diane Shipley of The Guardian stated her death was long overdue.|$|E
