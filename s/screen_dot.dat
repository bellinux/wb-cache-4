40|$|In the {{printing}} industry, {{one of the}} most common methods for reproducing halftone images using bilevel printing devices is clustered-dot ordered dithering. The images produced using this method are quite faithful to the original and are visually pleasing. Nevertheless, only rational angles are attainable with clustered-dot dithering, due to the discrete nature of the grids. This phenomenon can become detrimental in the case of four-color printing, when different screen angles and maybe even different screen frequencies are used for separate color planes, thus producing a so-called Moiré phenomenon. Another important drawback, the so-called banding or contouring effect, is related to the limited area of basic screen elements used in traditional dithering. In order to deal with these problems, we have developed, within the scope of our research, several new techniques for digital halftoning: (1) pseudo-random halftone screening, (2) a new method for generating clustered-dot halftone images having a number of reproducible gray or colour levels which is independent of the screen element size (CombiScreen), (3) rotated clustered-dot dithering, based on discrete one-to-one rotation, and (4) rotated dispersed-dot dither. A new method of pseudo-random halftone screening is described. It starts by obtaining the quasi-random distribution of tile centers according to some well-defined spectral characteristics. We then obtain the desired tesselation of the output device space by applying the Voronoi polygonization process. Then, an analytic black-dot curve is calculated according to the resampled input signal level and the area of each given tile. This analytic curve is scan-converted to obtain the blackened pixels. In the second approach, we associate threshold values to all pixels inside every tile according to some specially tailored analytic spot function. Then, the standard threshold comparison process is applied. Unlike known error-diffusion techniques, the pseudo-random halftone screening technique can be applied to a high resolution printing process. The characteristic screen element size can be properly chosen so as to ensure the best trade-off between {{the printing}} process constraints and the most precise printing. The described halftone algorithm seems to be appropriate for high-resolution color and black&white devices (above 1000 dpi). A new method (CombiScreen) is proposed for generating clustered-dot halftone images on raster printing devices having a number of reproducible gray or colour levels which is independent of the screen element size. The dither tiles generated by this method may contain several screen elements having any rational orientation and size. Threshold values are distributed among the cells of the dither tile so as to produce a large range of gray values, while at the same time preserving the clustered-dot behavior of individual screen elements. When rendering images at smoothly increasing intensity levels, this new method generates few contouring effects and other visible artifacts. The method works equally well for quadratic, rectangular, parallelogram and hexagonally shaped screen elements. Resulting dither tiles are generally either of parallelogram or of hexagonal shape. Since CombiScreen enables the <b>screen</b> <b>dot</b> frequency or orientation to be chosen independently of the number of gray levels, it has proven to be specially effective when printing at resolutions between 150 to 600 dpi with ink jet printers and at resolutions between 300 and 1200 dpi with xerographic printers. A new operator of discrete one-to-one rotation is described. It offers means previously unknown in the art for generating rotated screens which approximate irrational angles with high-precision, producing much less disturbing interferences and artifacts than other methods. Therefore, a carefully prepared dither tile incorporating screen elements with the desired period, initial orientation, and dither threshold values defining their <b>screen</b> <b>dot</b> shape growth behavior can be rotated by discrete one-to-one rotation and keep the desired screen element period, the number of cells per screen element and the threshold values associated with each screen element cell, thereby preserving the <b>screen</b> <b>dot</b> shape growth behavior of the original dither tile. Several different discrete one-to-one rotation variants are described: a small angle rotation technique valid for a subset of rational rotation angles, a rigid band technique and a technique based on discrete shearing transformations. The high-quality of the so rotated dither tile is due to the fact that discrete one-to-one rotation preserves the exact number of elementary cells per screen element and their exact dither threshold values. The described method provides a new range of solutions for obtaining high-quality digital angled halftone screens. High-quality solutions can be found for generating three digital angled halftone screens, each 30 ° apart from each other, as known from traditional photographic colour screening techniques. Further solutions minimizing Moiré effects may be obtained by halftone screens whose first order frequency component vectors sum up to zero. This new method has turned out to be particularly effective when printing with color ink jet printers at resolutions between 150 and 800 dpi as well as with xerographic printers at resolutions between 300 and 1200 dpi. Rotated dispersed-dot dither is based on the discrete one-to-one rotation of a Bayer dispersed-dot dither array. The halftone patterns produced by the rotated dither method therefore incorporate fewer disturbing artifacts than the horizontal and vertical components present in most of Bayer's halftone patterns. In grayscale wedges produced by rotated dither, texture changes at consecutive gray levels are much smoother than in error diffusion or in Bayer's dispersed-dot dither methods, thereby avoiding contouring effects. Due to its semi-clustering behavior at mid-tones, rotated dispersed-dot dither exhibits an improved tone reproduction behavior on printers having a significant dot gain, while maintaining the high detail rendition capabilities of dispersed-dot halftoning algorithms.

Les techniques de reproduction d'images noir et blanc ou couleur utilisées dans la plupart des imprimantes de bureau permettent de reproduire plus ou moins fidèlement des images, en mode tout-ou-rien. Cependant, ces techniques conventionnelles sont loin d'être parfaites: les unes souffrent d'un diapason dynamique trop limité, ce qui engendre un effet de bande ou d'autres structures visuellement gênantes; les autres produisent des effets de Moiré intolérables. Ce travail de thèse a été précédé par une analyse des problèmes liés à la nature répétitive des trames lors de la superposition de couches colorées et à la nature discrète des grilles de sortie des dispositifs de visualisation modernes. Cette analyse nous a permis d'identifier et de formuler un certain nombre de conditions à respecter, afin d'assurer une qualité de reproduction acceptable. Après avoir étudié l'état de l'art, nous avons décidé de mener notre recherche dans les directions suivantes: (1) méthode de reproduction d'images par trame pseudo-aléatoire regroupée, (2) technique combinée de génération de points de trame (CombiScreen), (3) méthode de reproduction en demi-ton par rotation discrète bijective d'une trame à points dispersés, et (4) méthode de reproduction en demi-ton par rotation discrète bijective d'une trame à points groupés. La méthode de reproduction d'images par trame pseudo-aléatoire regroupée, se prête bien à la reproduction couleur à haute résolution. Les épreuves en quadrichromie que nous avons pu faire, montrent une qualité acceptable dans la fidélité de rendu de nuances des teintes; elles donnent une bonne impression générale; il n'y pas d'effet de Moiré, ni d'autres artefacts visuels forts, sur les images obtenues. Par rapport à la plupart des implémentations commerciales existantes, notre méthode offre un contrôle accru sur la forme et la dispersion des éléments de trame. La méthode combinée de génération de points de trame (CombiScreen), permettant de minimiser l'effet de bandes, est utilisable dans la plupart des applications graphiques pour la reproduction d'images couleur ou noir et blanc. Cette technique permet d'obtenir des gradations de niveaux d'intensité extrêmement lisses, presque sans textures gênantes. Par ailleurs, elle permet d'utiliser des trames de base de différentes tailles, y compris de toutes petites trames, ce qui représente un avantage considérable. Les trames obtenues par la méthode CombiScreen peuvent également servir de base de départ pour d'autres méthodes de tramage, et, notamment, pour la méthode de reproduction en demi-ton par rotation discrète bijective. Un nouvel opérateur de rotation discrète bijective développé dans le cadre de cette recherche, permet d'appliquer des transformations proches des rotations, sur les ensembles discrets, et, notamment, sur les matrices de seuillage utilisées dans les algorithmes de reproduction. Trois types différents de rotations discrètes bijectives sont décrits en détail: la rotation discrète bijective par bandes rigides, la rotation discrète bijective de type a, b, b+ 1, et la rotation discrète bijective par cisaillements discrets successifs XYX. Grâce à cet opérateur, et en l'appliquant au plan des valeurs de seuil, on obtient plusieurs variantes de technique de reproduction en demi-ton par rotation discrète bijective, à points groupés ou dispersés. Les trames obtenues par ces techniques peuvent être appelées semi-régulières, car, tout en héritant d'un élément régulier des trames non-tournés, elles présentent une périodicité sur des périodes beaucoup plus grandes que celles de la trame de base. Les erreurs de dicrétisation, inhérentes à la rotation discrète bijective, perturbent la régularité initiale, sans la détruire complètement. La méthode de tramage régulier par matrice de seuillage dispersée tournée offre une qualité d'image améliorée. Les petits détails sont bien rendus et l'aspect visuel est assez plaisant. En outre, la courbe de reproduction obtenue par cette technique est nettement supérieure à celle de la méthode de Bayer, pour s'approcher des courbes de reproduction qui caractérisent les méthodes de reproduction par trame à points regroupés. Différentes méthodes de reproduction en demi-ton par rotation discrète bijective de la trame à points groupés permettent de satisfaire les critères de qualité de trames formulés au début de notre recherche, tels que l'élimination de l'effet de bande et la minimisation de l'effet de Moiré dans la reproduction en quadrichromie.

We propose an efficient juxtaposed color halftoning technique for placing any desired number of colorant layers side by side without overlapping.

In contrast to normal color printing which relies on the spectral absorption of light by the inks, at low concentration fluorescent inks behave additively, i. e. their light emission spectra sum up. We first analyze to which extent different fluorescent inks can be superposed. Due to the quenching effect, at high concentrations of the fluorescent molecules, the fluorescent effect diminishes. With an ink-jet printer capable of printing pixels at reduced dot sizes, we reduce the concentration of the individual fluorescent inks and are able to create from the blue, red and greenish-yellow inks the new colorants white and magenta. In order to avoid quenching effects, we propose a color halftoning method relying on diagonally oriented pre-computed <b>screen</b> <b>dots,</b> which are printed side by side.

However, it suffers from low spatial resolution and Moiré artifacts. Alternatively, popular FM halftoning methods, such as error diffusion, can achieve high spatial resolution and are free of Moiré artifacts but lack the print stability required for electro-photographic printing. In this paper, we present {{a new class of}} halftoning algorithms that simultaneously modulate both the size and density of printed dots. We call this new class of algorithms AM/FM halftoning.

The sensitivity and specificity of the ELISA were better than those of the chemical and cross-feeding assays, but the results of dot blot hybridization were the most reproducible. However, none of the Serratia and Enterobacter cloacae strains which produced aerobactin hybridized with the probe. We concluded that the best strategy for aerobactin detection is a two-step procedure that combines <b>screening</b> by <b>dot</b> blot hybridization with an ELISA for negative strains...|$|R
40|$|After {{almost half}} a {{millennium}} of technological development, printing technologies have achieved a level to fulfill their mission: to satisfy {{the demands of a}} faithful human reception of the whole variety of shape and color from nature by discrete colored <b>screen</b> <b>dots</b> on substrates (e. g. paper, foil). Nowadays improvements of industrial printing are more or less solely limited to improvements of the production efficiency. During the last decade, several R&D and business approaches have been published which employ printing technologies for the production of items with functionalities other than color images. In case of these new applications, the major advantage of printing technologies is the full additivity of the material deposition addressing exactly the geometrical areas where it is needed – without lithography. Beyond that, the digital printing technique inkjet allows the handling of smallest amounts of rare (and therefore costly) functional materials. In our paper we introduce our strategy of functional printing that exploits the potential of cutting-edge printing technologies for the digital fabrication of items with advanced – i. e. “not only graphical” – functionalities. The presented examples comprise concepts for printed energy storage devices, packages with RFID functionality, printed membranes and micro sieves, electrically conducting tracks and outline further approaches to manufacture devices and components of organic and large-area electronics. The implementation of functional printing requires well-directed interdisciplinary efforts to manufacture stacks of functional layers and to understand their structure-property relationships. In many cases the envisaged functionality is directly related rather to the nanoscopic structures than to bulk materials properties. We introduce the integrated research approach of Printed Functionalities in Chemnitz comprising Chemnitz University of Technology for science, the Fraunhofer Institution for Electronic Nanosystems (FhG ENAS) for applied science and industrialization as well as world-class companies on the Chemnitz Smart Systems Campus for the exploitation of future organic and large-area electronics products...|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} a {{combined}} photoluminescence imaging and atomic force microscopy study of single, isolated self-assembled InAs quantum dots (density 25 % of the time) {{in the vicinity of}} these features, but generally do not exhibit significant differences in their non-resonantly pumped emission spectra in comparison to quantum dots appearing in defect-free regions. This behavior is observed across multiple wafers produced in different growth chambers. Our characterization approach is relevant to applications in which single quantum dots are embedded within nanofabricated photonic devices, where such large surface features can affect the interaction with confined optical fields {{and the quality of the}} single-photon emission. In particular, we anticipate using this approach to <b>screen</b> quantum <b>dots</b> not only based on their optical properties, but also their surrounding surface topographies.

50|$|That evening, after {{shepherding}} the transports east to safety, the Sterett {{joined the}} van of the cruiser-destroyer force {{under the command}} of Rear Admiral Daniel J. Callaghan and steamed back through Lengo Channel to intercept Vice Admiral Hiroaki Abe's Japanese Navy task force. The Sterett and the other in the van, followed by five cruisers and a rear guard of four more destroyers, passed Lunga Point abeam, increased speed and, upon reaching a point about three miles (6 km) north of Tassafaronga, changed course. As the warships sped toward Savo Island, their radar <b>screens</b> were <b>dotted</b> by echoes from the Japanese ships. The Helena reported first contact at 01:30 on the 13th, and soon all the American ships were receiving reflections from the Japanese ships. The two forces were closing each other at a combined speed in excess of 40 knots (75 km/h).|$|R
40|$|The {{halftone}} {{process has been}} the conventional means of reproducing photographic artwork on newsprint. The use of relatively coarse screen rulings, dictated by the paper characteristics, produces an image with a noticeable dot pattern. Furthermore, the printing process is susceptible to extreme dot gain variation, which affects tone reproduction and the pictorial communication of the image. There were good reasons to suspect that a random <b>dot</b> <b>screen</b> could give more consistent tone rendition than a conventional halftone screen. A comparative study of the consistency of perception of conventional and randomly screened images when printed on newsprint {{has not yet been}} reported. The present study is an attempt to determine which screen can reproduce more consistently perceptible images when extreme dot gain occurs. To test this comparison, an original black and white photographic image, composed of geometric shapes of varying densities superimposed on backgrounds of varying densities, was reproduced from a computer generated slide. This test target, designed to encourage objective answers from observers, was photographed through 65 -and 85 -line conventional halftone screens, and 75 -and 150 - line mezzotint (random <b>dot)</b> <b>screens.</b> The production of film, plate, and the press run were the same for the four screened images. The pressman purposely varied the ink film thickness to simulate dot gain. Selected samples of minimum, average, and maximum dot gain were presented to observers, who were asked to identify geometric shapes on 12 printed images. The recorded responses were averaged, and the collected data was represented in graphs. In this manner it was possible to determine which screens can reproduce more consistent tonal distinctions. The results of the experiment proved that the random <b>dot</b> <b>screens</b> are not capable of reproducing more consistently perceptible images. The 65 -line conventional halftone screen produces more consistent perceptual responses in the highlights, while the 85 -line conventional halftone screen produces more consistent responses in the midtones...|$|R
5000|$|Sunday comics {{sections}} employed offset {{color printing}} with multiple print runs imitating {{a wide range}} of colors. Printing plates were created with four or more colors—traditionally, the CMYK color model: cyan, magenta, yellow and [...] "K" [...] for black. With a <b>screen</b> of tiny <b>dots</b> on each printing plate, the dots allowed an image to be printed in a halftone that appears to the eye in different gradations. The semi-opaque property of ink allows halftone dots of different colors to create an optical effect of full-color imagery.|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} {{experiments}} were made on human performance in controlling optical relative movement. The aim was to test the influence {{of different kinds of}} relative movement on visually controlled steering tasks. Within adjacent displays on a computer <b>screen</b> random <b>dot</b> patterns moved in a fixed direction at continually changing speeds (Exp. 1) or at constant speed and in continually changing directions (Exp. 2). The subject was required to compensate for the unpredictable modulations of the pattern movement by means of an isometric joystick. The task was to adjust relative movements involving pure translation, symmetric convergence, divergence, or shear. Analysis indicated that the task performance was not dependent on the special kind of relative movement. However, performance was significantly higher in tasks where directionally disturbed relative movement had to be controlled compared to those situations in which relative movement varied with respect to speed...|$|R
50|$|The {{disadvantage}} {{of this approach}} was that for any given amount of gun power, the shadow mask filtered out {{the majority of the}} energy. To ensure there was no overlap of the beam on the <b>screen,</b> the <b>dots</b> had to be separated and covered perhaps 25% of its surface. This led to very dim images, requiring much greater electron beam power in order to provide a useful picture. Moreover, the system was highly dependent on the relative angles of the beams between the three guns, which required constant adjustment by the user to ensure the guns hit the correct colors. In spite of this, the technical superiority of the RCA system was overwhelming compared to the CBS system, and was selected as the new NTSC standard in 1953. The first broadcast using the new standard occurred on New Year's Day in 1954, when NBC broadcast the Tournament of Roses Parade.|$|R

A snapshot of the camera feed {{at the time of the}} find is displayed, along with an arrow pointing from the launch site to the location, and a distance measurement. Immediately, the workers know which direction to go, how far to go, and what the site looks like from the air. Seeing that the location is fallen building with no visible signs of a survivor, two rescue workers immediately set out in that direction, knowing the survivor is likely buried in the rubble.|$|R
