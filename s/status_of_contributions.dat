During the last few years, it has been widely discussed in logistics research, {{as well as in}} other scientific fields which also approach and {{contribute to the development of}} RFID technology. In both logistics and related fields there are findings regarding RFID technology which influence logistics. However, an overall <b>status</b> <b>of</b> <b>contributions</b> in academic literature is lacking. The purpose of this paper is thus to review academic literature regarding RFID technology on a broad basis, in logistics and related fields, to analyse findings which impact on logistics or supply chain management. A general search for articles containing the search phrases radio frequency identification or RFID in the database called ABI Inform is conducted. An initial analysis of articles found resulted in sixty-four relevant articles. These are analysed from a logistics and SCM perspective. The literature review categorises and structures literature regarding RFID technology which influences logistics or SCM according to area of focus. The paper analyses developments reported in various industries, methods used, contexts covered, and main logistical and supply chain issues and areas dealt with as well as those which are omitted. The paper is valuable as it presents a comprehensive picture of the current status of findings which affect logistics and supply chain management and which have been reported within RFID technology.

30|$|Women {{entrepreneurs}} are {{key players in}} the economic development of societies in Sub-Saharan Africa. However, research has reported that business and technology incubators offer insufficient support to their enterprises. Consequently, this paper sets out to explore and highlight the present <b>status</b> <b>of</b> the <b>contribution</b> <b>of</b> business and technology incubators to women entrepreneurs’ businesses. The study collected data through exploratory focus group discussions, in-depth interviews, and structured questionnaires. The data were analysed and interpreted using the convergent parallel method. The findings indicate that business incubators provide women’s business with training and to some extend enhance their access to market information and business networks. However, the study also finds a lack of contextualisation in the business and technology incubators’ services to the real needs of the incubatees, which eventually makes their support less impactful. In this light, the study recommends the provision of incubators’ services tailored to the real needs of women businesses. Our work puts forward recommendations to support women entrepreneurs’ business development through the contextualisation of the incubators’ services tailored to the incubatees’ real needs including appropriate training beyond business management. Further investments for establishing new incubation centres are also recommended.|$|R

We discuss the current <b>status</b> <b>of</b> the hadronic <b>contributions</b> to some electroweak precision observables like the leading hadronic contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment a j (g Γ 2) = 2 [1] and the effective fine structure constant at the Z [...] resonance [2].

Relevant IRAS and ISO programmes are reviewed, addressing both the cluster galaxies and the still-very-limited evidence for an infrared-emitting intra-cluster medium. ISO made important advances in knowledge of both nearby and distant galaxy clusters, such as {{the discovery of a}} major cold dust component in Virgo and Coma cluster galaxies, the elaboration of the correlation between dust emission and Hubble-type, and the detection of numerous Luminous Infrared Galaxies (LIRGs) in several distant clusters. These and consequent achievements are underlined and described. We recall that, due to observing time constraints, ISO’s coverage of higher-redshift galaxy clusters to the depths required to detect and study statistically significant samples of cluster galaxies over a range of morphological types could not be comprehensive and systematic, and such systematic coverage of distant clusters will be an important achievement of the Spitzer Observatory.

40|$|Conventional Implicatures (CIs; in {{the sense}} of Potts 2005) are part of a larger class of {{projection}} phenomena. These phenomena also include presuppositions and anaphora, and can described as content that is not at-issue (cf. Simons, Tonhauser, Beaver & Roberts 2010). Despite the shared property of projection, CIs differ from other projection phenomena with respect to the information <b>status</b> <b>of</b> their <b>contribution.</b> Presuppositions, for instance, refer to established, or old information, whereas CIs contribute novel information to the discourse, like at-issue content. Here, we propose a unidimensional analysis of CIs and at-issue content, which highlights the similarity in projection behaviour of CIs, presuppositions, and anaphora. This analysis treats CIs as ‘piggybacking’ on their anchor; they introduce an anaphoric dependency on the interpretation site of their anchor, {{while at the same time}} requiring their anchor to refer to a specific referent in the discourse context. CIs are thus elaborations on the description of the referent referred to by their anchor. This analysis of CIs is formalized in Projective Discourse Representation Theory (PDRT; Venhuizen, Bos & Brouwer 2013), a representational framework in which the property of projection is accounted for by explicitly distinguishing between the introduction and interpretation site of semantic content. Our formal analysis explains the interpretational differences between CIs, presuppositions, anaphora, and at-issue content, without stipulating a fundamental distinction between them...|$|R

The EC system is being procured by 5 domestic agencies plus the ITER Organization (IO). F 4 E has the largest fraction of the EC procurements, which includes 8 high voltage power supplies (HVPS), 6 gyrotrons, the ex-vessel waveguides (includes isolation valves and diamond windows) for all launchers, 4 upper launchers and the main control system. F 4 E is working with IO to improve the overall design of the EC system by integrating consolidated technological advances, simplifying the interfaces, and doing global engineering analysis and assessments of EC heating and current drive physics and technology capabilities. Examples are the optimization of the HVPS and gyrotron requirements and performance relative to power modulation for MHD control, common qualification programs for diamond window procurements, assessment of the EC grounding system, and the optimization of the launcher steering angles for improved EC access.
