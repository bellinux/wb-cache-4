2500|$|The critic H. F. Chorley, who admired Lind, {{described}} her voice as having [...] "two octaves in compass – from D to D – having a higher possible note or two, available on rare occasions; {{and that the}} lower half of the register and the upper one were of two distinct qualities. The former was not strong – veiled, if not husky; and apt to be out of tune. The latter was rich, brilliant and powerful – finest in its highest portions." [...] Chorley praised her breath management, her use of pianissimo, her taste in ornament and her intelligent use of technique to conceal the differences between her upper and lower registers. [...] He thought her [...] "execution was great" [...] and that she was a [...] "skilled and careful musician", but felt that [...] "many of her effects on the stage appeared overcalculated" [...] and that <b>singing</b> <b>in</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>languages</b> impeded her ability to give expression to the text. [...] He felt, however, that her concert singing was more admirable than her operatic performances, although he praised some of her roles. [...] Chorley judged her finest work to be in the German repertoire, citing Mozart, Haydn and Mendelssohn's Elijah as best suited to her. [...] Miller concluded that although connoisseurs of the voice preferred other singers, her wider appeal to the public at large was not merely a legend created by Barnum, but was a mixture of [...] "a uniquely pure (some called it celestial) quality in her voice, consistent with her well-known generosity and charity." ...|$|R

Despite his familiarity with the language, he chose to communicate in the vernacular, which for him was German, for the purpose of communicating to the common people who would not have understood Latin. This is evidenced by the fact that his writings were written in German. Further evidence of this comes from this quote of his, [...] "The death of the Lord should be preached after any land’s tongue… It is much better that a single verse of the psalms be spoken in every land after the language of the common people than five entire psalms be <b>sung</b> <b>in</b> a <b>foreign</b> <b>language</b> and not be understood in the church." ...|$|R

Süden which means [...] "south" [...] in English {{was chosen as}} a metapher that not only relates to the Southern hemisphere {{but also to the}} origin of all three musicians, i.e. Sicily (Pollina) and Bavaria (Schmidbauer, Kälberer). It represents the idea of a certain mentality of people that were born in the Southern region of their countries of origin. Songs highlight the problems in the Southern hemisphere, they talk about the South as people's home but also about friendship and hope. Another particularity of this album is the use of different languages (Italian, Bavarian (which is a German dialect)) in the same song.

40|$|Sounding convincing when {{performing}} a vocal art from another culture requires attention to sound on many levels. Pronunciation and voice quality {{are as important}} as intonation, phrasing and idiomatic rhythm. The mechanics of how we use our voices can be so ingrained and habitual that changing and maintaining control of all these variables at one time can be difficult. Sung poetry is a core element in Javanese musical expression and essential to the performance of gamelan. Vocal training in Java, however, focuses entirely on content rather than technique, leaving the foreign student attempting to gradually adjust their sound by trial and error. In order to recreate a full gamelan sound with groups in the UK, one is faced with the challenges of helping non-singers attracted by the idea of a percussion orchestra to <b>sing</b> <b>in</b> a <b>foreign</b> <b>language</b> and singers with existing technique to change how they use their voice.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{describe}} the English phonological awareness that elementary school children might gain by <b>singing</b> English songs <b>in</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>language</b> activity classes. <b>In</b> this study, the author had investigated whether speech accents and rhythms were reflected in musical accents and rhythms. As a result of the investigation, it was observed that stressed syllables were likely to be matched with the higher and longer musical notes. This analysis leads to the conclusion that utilizing songs can be one of the effective resources for teaching English syllables, accents, and rhythms. The discourse analysis showed that some children described these phonological items in their own words during and after the singing activity, but at the same time, their descriptions were ambiguous. The teacher of this class did not pay attention to the difference between the linguistic definition of the term “rhythm” and the musicological one. Consequently, it might have led to their vague responses. Thus, it is important for elementary school teachers to construe children’ s intuitive utterances and descriptions by utilizing some fundamental pieces of knowledge of English phonology. It would enable teachers to have their children become more conscious of the phonological difference between Japanese and English...|$|R

Mandatory classes include Mathematical Modeling, Physics, Humanities, Computer Science, STEM (Science Technology Engineering and Math), Science and Technical Writing, and <b>Foreign</b> <b>Language.</b> STEM I is {{a class in}} which students take on an original research investigation that makes some contribution in that field. Students can either conduct science, math or engineering projects. This class culminates with a science fair in February. STEM II is an engineering class in which students work in three- and four-person teams to develop a piece of assistive technology. These projects are designed with a specific client in mind, usually a young student with a physical handicap. The <b>foreign</b> <b>language</b> classes are also different from most schools. In addition to grammar and translation, the class period consists of making a movie completely in either Spanish or French, <b>singing</b> songs written <b>in</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>language,</b> and discussion <b>in</b> the target language. Two days a week after school students participate in 1.5 hour elective periods, where students can take a class of their choosing.
