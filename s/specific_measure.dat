500|$|In a road network, {{congestion}} can {{be considered}} a <b>specific</b> <b>measure</b> of the time delay in a journey or time lost through traffic jams. Delays can be caused by some combination of traffic density, road capacity, and the delaying effects of other road users and traffic management schemes such as traffic lights, junctions, and street works. This can be measured as the extra journey time needed to traverse a congested route when compared to the same route with no such interference. [...] However, this technical definition of congestion as a measurement of delay can get confused and used interchangeably with traffic density in the public mind.|$|E
60|$|The Court of Directors so far {{ratified}} this establishment, (which was consonant {{enough to}} their general plan of government,) {{that they gave}} precise orders that no alteration should be made in it without their consent. So far from being apprised of any design against this constitution, they had reason to conceive that on trial it had been more and more approved by their Council-General, at least by the Governor-General, who had planned it. At {{the time of the}} revolution, the Council-General was nominally in two persons, virtually in one. At that time measures of an arduous and critical nature ought to have been forborne, even if, to the fullest council, this <b>specific</b> <b>measure</b> had not been prohibited by the superior authority. It was in this very situation that one man had the hardiness to conceive and the temerity to execute a total revolution in the form and the persons composing the government of a great kingdom. Without any previous step, at one stroke, the whole constitution, of Bengal, civil and criminal, was swept away. The counsellors were recalled from their provinces; upwards of fifty of the principal officers of government were turned out of employ, and rendered dependent on Mr. Hastings for their immediate subsistence, and for all hope of future provision. The chief of each council, and one European collector of revenue, was left in each province.|$|E
60|$|DURING {{the first}} six weeks of this famous {{committee}} the attendance of its members was not very regular, and its labours attracted little attention. The evidence on the East-India part of the question was closed and reported to the House {{by the end of}} February; after that period the evidence was reported to the House every week or ten days. Towards the end of March, rumours began to circulate of the extraordinary vigour and ability with which this investigation was pursued, and of the novel, authentic, and striking evidence that had been elicited. The proceedings were talked of in the House of Commons and on the Royal Exchange; the City men who were examined went back to their companions with wondrous tales of the energy and acuteness of Harcourt House, and the order, method, and discipline of the committee-room at Westminster. As time elapsed, the hopes of the colonial interest again revived. It was generally felt that Lord George had succeeded in establishing an irresistible case. It was rumoured that the government could not withstand it. Those who had originally murmured at the course which he had adopted of moving for a committee of inquiry, instead of proposing a <b>specific</b> <b>measure</b> of relief, and had treated an investigation as a mere means of securing inaction, now recanted their rash criticism, and did justice to his prescience and superior judgment, as well as to his vast information and indefatigable exertions. The week during which the committee sat on their report was a very anxious one; the divisions were known every day in the House of Commons; the alternations of success and discomfiture, and the balanced numbers that so often called for the interposition of the chairman, were calculated to sustain the excitement; and when, on the 29th of May, it was known that the report was at length agreed to, and that a committee of free traders had absolutely recommended a differential duty of 10s. in favour of our own produce, one might have fancied from the effect visibly produced, that a government was changed.|$|E

50|$|Although measure {{numbers are}} reused, {{the effect of}} this measure on the state was {{significant}} enough that when Oregonians speak of Measure 5, they are usually referring to the <b>specific</b> <b>measure</b> passed in 1990. Measure 5 is often seen as the beginning of the Oregon tax revolt. One effect of the measure was that funding for local schools was shifted from primarily local property tax funds to state funds. With this, it led to a general equalization of funding between districts as funds are now given to districts {{based on the number of}} students in each district. Schools with higher value property in their districts previously could fund local schools at a higher rate than more economically depressed areas.|$|E

50|$|Both the {{standard}} deviation and the mean absolute difference measure dispersion—how spread out are the values of a population or the probabilities of a distribution. The mean absolute difference is not {{defined in terms of}} a <b>specific</b> <b>measure</b> of central tendency, whereas {{the standard}} deviation is defined in terms of the deviation from the arithmetic mean. Because {{the standard deviation}} squares its differences, it tends to give more weight to larger differences and less weight to smaller differences compared to the mean absolute difference. When the arithmetic mean is finite, the mean absolute difference will also be finite, even when the standard deviation is infinite. See the examples for some specific comparisons.|$|E

50|$|The sievert unit {{is used in}} {{the report}} of the {{effective}} dose. The sievert unit, in the context of CT scans, does not correspond to the actual radiation dose that the scanned body part absorbs but to another radiation dose of another scenario, the whole body absorbing the other radiation dose and the other radiation dose being of a magnitude, estimated to have the same probability to induce cancer as the CT scan. Thus, as is shown in the table above, the actual radiation that is absorbed by a scanned body part is often much larger than the effective dose suggests. A <b>specific</b> <b>measure,</b> termed the computed tomography dose index (CTDI), is commonly used as an estimate of the radiation absorbed dose for tissue within the scan region, and is automatically computed by medical CT scanners.|$|E

40|$|Abstract OnlyIn {{this work}} we confront, by {{reviewing}} the literature, {{the definition of}} ecosystem-based management provided in the proposal for reform of the European Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) with the <b>specific</b> <b>measures</b> foreseen in it. These are: the sustainability objectives, the maximum sustainable yield target, the discard ban, transferable fishing concessions and regionalization. By analyzing the proposal of reform of the CFP {{by means of the}} ecosystem-based management framework, we conclude that {{there is a lack of}} social instruments to deal with the social sustainability objective while economic and ecological sustainability can be simultaneously achieved with the <b>specific</b> <b>measures</b> considered in the proposal. We also conclude that individually analysed, the <b>specific</b> <b>measures</b> could further the ecosystem based management implementation, although not all the observed or analysed consequences of the implementation of these measures move in this direction. In that sense we conclude that the success of the ecosystem based management depends much more on the specific implementation as well as on the accompanying incentives (structural funds) ...|$|R
