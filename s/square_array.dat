There was friction between the company and Wigner and his team. Major differences between Wigner's reactor design and DuPont's included {{increasing the number of}} process tubes from 1,500 in a circular array to 2,004 in a <b>square</b> <b>array,</b> and cutting the power from 500 MW to 250 MW. As it turned out, the design decision by DuPont to give the reactor additional tubes came in handy when neutron poisoning became a problem for the B Reactor at the Hanford Site. The extra tubes allowed a greater fuel load to overcome the poisoning. Without them the reactor would have had to be run at low power until enough of the boron impurities in the graphite had been burned up to allow it to reach full power, which would have delayed full operation by up to a year.|$|E

The ISS has taken {{hundreds of thousands of}} images of Saturn, its rings, and its moons. The ISS has a wide-angle camera (WAC) that takes pictures of large areas, and a narrow-angle camera (NAC) that takes pictures of small areas in fine detail. Each of these cameras uses a sensitive charge-coupled device (CCD) as its electromagnetic wave detector. Each CCD has a 1,024 <b>square</b> <b>array</b> of pixels, 12μm on a side. Both cameras allow for many data collection modes, including on-chip data compression. Both cameras are fitted with spectral filters that rotate on a wheel—to view different bands within the electromagnetic spectrum ranging from 0.2 to 1.1μm.|$|E

40|$|Aquaporin (AQP) water {{channels}} are {{abundant in the}} brain and spinal cord, where AQP 1 and AQP 4 are believed to play major roles in water metabolism and osmoregulation. Immunocytochemical analysis of the brain recently revealed that AQP 4 has a highly polarized distribution, with marked expression in astrocyte end-feet that surround capillaries and form the glia limitans; however, the structural organization of AQP 4 has remained unknown. In freeze-fracture replicas, astrocyte end-feet contain abundant <b>square</b> <b>arrays</b> of intramembrane particles that parallel the distribution of AQP 4. To determine whether astrocyte and ependymocyte <b>square</b> <b>arrays</b> contain AQP 4, we employed immunogold labeling of SDS-washed freeze-fracture replicas and stereoscopic confirmation of tissue binding. Antibodies to AQP 4 directly labeled ≈ 33 % of <b>square</b> <b>arrays</b> in astrocyte and ependymocyte plasma membranes in rat brain and spinal cord. Overall, 84 % of labels were present beneath square arrays; 11 % were beneath particle clusters that resembled <b>square</b> <b>arrays</b> that had been altered during fixation or cleaving; and 5 % were beneath the much larger areas of glial plasma membrane that were devoid of <b>square</b> <b>arrays.</b> Based on this evidence that AQP 4 is concentrated in glial <b>square</b> <b>arrays,</b> freeze-fracture methods may now provide biophysical insights regarding neuropathological states in which abnormal fluid shifts are accompanied by alterations in the aggregation state or the molecular architecture of <b>square</b> <b>arrays...</b>|$|R

2500|$|A {{geometric}} magic square, often {{abbreviated to}} geomagic square, is a generalization of magic squares invented by Lee Sallows in 2001. A traditional magic square is a <b>square</b> <b>array</b> of numbers (almost always positive integers) whose sum taken in any row, any column, or in either diagonal {{is the same}} target number. A geomagic square, on the other hand, is a <b>square</b> <b>array</b> of geometrical shapes in which those appearing in each row, column, or diagonal can be fitted together to create an identical shape called the target shape. [...] As with numerical types, it is required that the entries in a geomagic square be distinct. Similarly, the eight trivial variants of any square resulting from its rotation and/or reflection, are all counted as the same square. By the dimension of a geomagic square is meant the dimension of the pieces it uses. Hitherto interest has focused mainly on 2D squares using planar pieces, but pieces of any dimension are permitted.|$|E
