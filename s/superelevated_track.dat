5000|$|Another {{solution}} to this problem had been developed in the 1950s but not widely used: tilting trains. Tilting trains rock into the curve to tilt the passenger cars the same way that a <b>superelevated</b> <b>track</b> would tilt them inward. Tilting systems had been introduced in service by the Spanish Talgo, but this system was [...] "passive" [...] and took some time to respond to curves. A great improvement can be made by making the system [...] "active", reading the forces on the cars with sensors and quickly rotating them to the proper angle using hydraulic rams. British Rail ran an extensive experimental program on active tilt systems in the 1960s that was highly influential, and followed these studies in the 1970s with a new tilting train design, the Advanced Passenger Train (APT). The technical design objectives for the APT included a maximum speed 50% higher than existing trains, curving speeds 40% higher, all while running on existing tracks within the limits of existing signals.|$|E
