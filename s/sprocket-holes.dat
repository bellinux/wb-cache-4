50|$|He {{exhibited}} a large-scale multi-screen work, Labyrinth, at Expo 67 in Montreal. In {{the same year}} he co-founded the Multiscreen Corporation, which later became the IMAX Corporation. The Multivision process, which {{was a response to}} Kroitor's experiences at Expo 67, was developed for the Osaka Expo '70 and involved 70mm film projected horizontally rather than vertically. Each frame was as large as a postcard, with 15 <b>sprocket-holes.</b>|$|E
50|$|Both on and {{off-line}} printers were impact printers, {{capable of}} printing {{a line of}} either 120 or 160 characters, depending on the model They were single type-face, no lower case. Fan fold paper for the printers was continuous, with perforations between the pages, and <b>sprocket-holes</b> at {{each side of the}} paper for the paper-feed mechanism. Custom paper sizes, with pre-printed lines/text/colours etc. were common, especially for applications like payroll, and small paper-tape control loops were needed to match page-throw size to each paper type.|$|E
50|$|In {{order that}} these parts the film {{projector}} may operate as described, {{it is essential}} that the loop of slack film be maintained at all times ready for the intermittingly-acting device and also that the slack-manipulating and the intermittingly-moving devices be positively driven by mechanism which will absolutely insure the presence of the slack and the accurate movement of the film. The reason these parts and their arrangement and method of operation are such important and valuable features of the invention is because their action is necessarily exceedingly rapid, and if the intermittingly-feeding mechanism were heavy, so as to have much inertia, or if any considerable portion of the film or either of the reels which support it were stopped and started at each transition from picture to picture there would be such strain brought to bear on the <b>sprocket-holes</b> in the film as would speedily tear it adjacent to such holes, thus ruining it...|$|E
50|$|With some {{patience}} and ingenuity, most film cameras can be used. However, some cameras of the 1990s that used 35mm film have infrared <b>sprocket-hole</b> sensors that can fog infrared film (their manuals may warn {{against the use}} of infrared film for this reason). Other film cameras are not completely opaque to infrared light.|$|R
5000|$|The IMAX {{format is}} generically called [...] "15/70" [...] film, the name {{referring}} to the 15 sprocket holes or perforations per frame. The film's bulk requires horizontal platters, rather than conventional film reels. IMAX platters range from 1.2 to 1.83 m diameter to accommodate 1 to 2.75 hours of film. Platters with a 2.5 hour feature film weigh 250 kg. IMAX uses ESTAR-based print film in their 15/70 rolling-loop film projection systems. ESTAR-based print film provides greater precision. The chemical development process {{does not change the}} size or shape of ESTAR print film, and IMAX's pin registration system (especially the camera mechanism) does not tolerate either <b>sprocket-hole</b> or film-thickness variations. On September 1, 2016, it announced plans to include Virtual Reality into the IMAX theater experience with the opening of a new VR center in Los Angeles using a new StarVR headset created by Acer.|$|R
