30|$|Curb parking has adverse {{influences}} on operation safety of dynamic traffic. Among them, motor vehicle safety {{is determined by}} the severity of traffic conflict caused by curb parking. Non-motor vehicle safety {{is determined by the}} remaining lane width at the parking zone. The safety of crossing pedestrians is determined by whether the stopping sight distance of the driver is satisfied or not. The safety <b>setting</b> <b>distance</b> from parking zone to pedestrian crosswalk should be determined by the average travel speed of main traffic flow to a large extent. However, that value is much larger than that recommended in most of the currant design guidelines.|$|E

In this paper, integer mathematical programming model were developed to satisfy this oil transportation optimization problem. Specifically, it is dedicated to obtain refineries-to-depots optimal assignments by <b>setting</b> <b>distance</b> and cost minimization as the objective function. The adopted approach is to run the program using I-Log software. The used data was selected from some of the real case study. Thus, the outcomes of this study are highly feasible in reality to achieve the best refinery-to- depots assignments with the minimized total transportation distance as well as the total transportation cost...|$|E

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} infrared microscopic {{study of}} single tracks of atmospheric pressure plasma polymerised HMDSO is presented. The effects of different process parameters, i. e. the process gas, the nozzle <b>setting</b> (<b>distance</b> between discharge chamber and injection {{point of the}} monomer gas), and the nozzle speed, are investigated. It is shown that the chemical structure of singles tracks is not homogenous along the deposit. An increase of the oxygen content in the process gas or an increase of the excitation energy transferred to the monomer gas increase the relative content of SiOCH 3 and SiOH units within the bulk polymer network. The deposition of superposed tracks is studied as well and it is revealed that {{the structure of the}} coating is changed compared to the first track...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{effectively}} and precisely retrieve the desired images {{from a large}} image database, {{the development of a}} content-based image retrieval (CBIR) system has become an important research issue. This paper presents a method to extract color, texture and edge features of an image quickly for content-based image retrieval (CBIR) [1]. Color attributes like the mean value, the standard deviation, and the image bitmap of a color image are used as the features for retrieval. In addition, the entropy based on the gray level co-occurrence matrix and the edge histogram of an image is also considered. However, most of the proposed approaches emphasize on finding the best representation for different image features. Furthermore, very few of the representative works well consider the user's subjectivity and preferences in the retrieval process. Furthermore, to reduce the gap between the retrieval results and the user's expectation, the IGA (Interactive Genetic Algorithm) is employed to help the users identify the images that are most satisfied to the users' need by <b>setting</b> <b>distance</b> parameter to the image using IGA...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} {{study was to determine}} what prerequisite information a first-time student of a distance learning must be given in order to successfully participate in a distance learning course. A list of important items and a comparison grid were developed from an in-depth examination of current practices by major universities and an up-to-date literature review. Overview Distance Learning, sometimes referred to as ‘eLearning’, has become a very popular form of education and training that complements or is an alternative to the traditional classroom <b>setting.</b> <b>Distance</b> learning began as curriculum taught through media such as video cassettes, audiocassettes, books and workbooks that traditionally were sent via mail to students or delivered in a classroom-like setting. For decades, many universities have offered correspondence study programs or courses. Today, distance learning courses are based mostly on the Internet and its diverse capabilities for delivering materials, streaming video and audio, and providing instant feedback and assessments between the student and teacher. In order to successfully complete a course taught by distance learning, a student must first have som...|$|E

40|$|An {{exploration}} into computer aided digital map modeling of prehistoric site location preferences based on both cultural and environmental variables. Thesis (M. A.) [...] Humboldt State University, Social Science: Environment and Community, 2010 The {{focus of this}} thesis is a Geographic Information System (GIS) based predictive modeling process with results as applied to the Wiyot Cultural Area in Humboldt County, California. Predictive models aim to identify patterns that demonstrate a range of human activities, especially economic maximization and cognitive cultural decisions. This model relied on secondary document analysis in order to recreate the prehistoric environ and identify site type and use areas including historic maps, oral history, ethnographic documents and archaeological site records. Logistic regression was employed to discriminate significance values among the variables derived from the document analysis, selecting the strongest environmental and cultural variables for the modeling process. Topographic <b>setting,</b> <b>distance</b> to prairies, and distance to navigable waterways were selected as variables significant at the 0. 05 level. Distance to freshwater, elevation, and vegetation setting {{did not meet the}} criteria for significance and were excluded. A relative probability map was produced which indicated both site and non-site locations within the study area. Internal and statistical testing showed that although only three variables were employed, the model exhibited a 66...|$|E
40|$|The main {{disadvantage}} of most existing set kernels {{is that they}} are based on averaging, which might be inappropriate for problems where only specific elements of the two sets should determine the overall similarity. In this paper we propose a class of kernels for sets of vectors directly exploit-ing <b>set</b> <b>distance</b> measures and, hence, incorporating various semantics into set kernels and lending the power of regular-ization to learning in structural domains where natural dis-tance functions exist. These kernels belong to two groups: (i) kernels in the proximity space induced by <b>set</b> <b>distances</b> and (ii) <b>set</b> <b>distance</b> substitution kernels (non-PSD in gen-eral). We report experimental results which show that our kernels compare favorably with kernels based on averaging and achieve results similar to other state-of-the-art meth-ods. At the same time our kernels systematically improve over the naive way of exploiting distances. ...|$|R
