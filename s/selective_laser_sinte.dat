40|$|Background: Whitish {{spots are}} {{sometimes}} {{noted in the}} corneal endothelium after <b>selective</b> <b>laser</b> trabeculoplasty. To evaluate the corneal endothelium after <b>selective</b> <b>laser</b> trabeculoplasty, corneal specular microscopy was performed. Design: Prospective observational study in a private practice. Participants: Fifteen consecutive patients with open-angle glaucoma undergoing <b>selective</b> <b>laser</b> trabeculoplasty in February 2012 had their corneal endothelium examined with specular microscopy before and after treatment. Methods: <b>Selective</b> <b>laser</b> trabeculoplasty was done with 50 ± 5 shots to 180 degrees of meshwork using 0. 3 - 0. 9 mJ of power to achieve the reaction of a hint of microbubbles in 80 % of laser shots. Main Outcome Measures: Corneal specular microscopy photographs (0. 25 ± 0. 54 mm) were taken prior to, immediately after and 1 month after <b>selective</b> <b>laser</b> trabeculoplasty. These photographs were assessed and graded. Results: Of the 15 patients, three showed numerous, four showed few and eight showed no increase of dark spots after <b>selective</b> <b>laser</b> trabeculoplasty. All the dark spots resolved by 1 month. Conclusion: The effect of <b>selective</b> <b>laser</b> trabeculoplasty on the corneal endothelium may be transient, and long-term effects are probably negligible in normal corneas. However, in compromised corneas and corneas with pigment deposits on endothelium, {{there may be a}} risk of corneal endothelial compromise, especially after repeated <b>selective</b> <b>laser</b> trabeculoplasty. Larger and longer term studies with histopathological evaluation would be useful to evaluate the effect of <b>selective</b> <b>laser</b> trabeculoplasty on normal and subnormal corneal endothelium. Until further studies are done, {{it would be wise to}} minimize the number and energy of laser shots. 4 page(s...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND <b>Selective</b> <b>laser</b> trabeculoplasty {{has been}} found to be {{effective}} as an adjunct to topical medical therapy in glaucoma. This analysis examines the intraocular pressure lowering effect of laser trabeculoplasty in eyes with pseudoexfoliation on maximum medical therapy. MATERIAL AND METHODS A retrospective chart review was undertaken of 457 eyes of which 344 underwent a 360 ° <b>selective</b> <b>laser</b> trabeculoplasty treatment between 2008 and 2013. 94 of these eyes had pseudoexfoliation. Intraocular pressure values were analysed in 3 monthly intervals up to 60 months after <b>selective</b> <b>laser</b> trabeculoplasty. Exclusion criteria were narrow or closed angles as well as uveitic glaucoma and previous intraocular pressure lowering surgery. RESULTS Patients mean age was 71 years± 11. 0 [*]SD, 42. 7 % were male. At time point 12 months after <b>selective</b> <b>laser</b> trabeculoplasty the intraocular pressure lowering effect was significantly greater in eyes with pseudoexfoliation than in eyes without pseudoexfoliation (p= 0. 01; Mann-Whitney test). Up to 21 months after <b>selective</b> <b>laser</b> trabeculoplasty a significant intraocular pressure reduction of 2. 76 [*]mmHg± 3. 72 [*]SD compared to baseline values could be seen in eyes with pseudoexfoliation (p= 0. 01; Wilcoxon Test). CONCLUSIONS In this retrospective study a significant greater intraocular pressure lowering effect of <b>selective</b> <b>laser</b> trabeculoplasty could be seen in eyes with pseudoexfoliation compared to eyes without pseudoexfoliation only at time point 12 months after <b>selective</b> <b>laser</b> trabeculoplasty.

40|$|Abstract. Despite {{extended}} and substantial clinical experience with laser trabeculoplasty, {{it is used}} relatively infrequently. Reasons include associated significant tissue disruption with consequent reluctance from re-treatment, lack of full understanding of the mechanism by which intraocular pressure (IOP) is reduced, and known complications. <b>Selective</b> <b>laser</b> trabeculoplasty results in selective absorption of energy by trabecular pigmented cells, sparing adjacent cells and tissues from thermal damage. Morphologic studies demonstrated minimal tissue alteration following treatment with <b>selective</b> <b>laser</b> trabeculoplasty. Clinical studies suggest it is efficacious in lowering IOP, as initial treatment or when medical therapy is insufficient, with response rates after 1 year ranging from 59 % to 96 %. Average reduction in IOP has been reported from 18 % to 40 %. Comparative studies suggested similar IOP reduction by argon <b>laser</b> trabeculoplasty and <b>selective</b> <b>laser</b> trabeculoplasty. Observed side effects have been mostly transient and minor. We review the current knowledge of the mechanisms and clinical outcome of <b>selective</b> <b>laser</b> trabeculoplasty.

The range of materials commercially available for <b>selective</b> <b>laser</b> sintering merely includes some semi crystalline polymers mainly polyamides, which leads to an absence of realizable component properties.

The test specimens were generated at varied filler concentration, filler types and manufacturing parameter like laser power or scan speed. In addition to the characterization of the mixed powders, resulting melt depth were analyzed in order to investigate the beam material interaction.

40|$|Background Glaucoma is a {{major cause}} of {{blindness}} worldwide. The affected population was projected to increase from 60. 5 million in 2010 to 79. 6 million in 2020. Among the various types of glaucoma, primary open angle glaucoma will account for more than 70 % of this population. Treatment by lowering the intraocular pressure is the only proven method to reduce progression. This can be achieved via medication, surgery and <b>laser.</b> <b>Selective</b> <b>laser</b> trabeculoplasty is a relatively new type of laser that is reported to be equally efficacious to a first line medication and other established laser trabeculoplasty, namely argon laser trabeculoplasty. The evidence available, however, is limited to single trials, which may not reach adequate power to detect the difference. A systematic review and meta-analysis would add evidence to consider <b>selective</b> <b>laser</b> trabeculoplasty as an alternative treatment option in open angle glaucoma through assessing its efficacy and effectiveness in lowering the intraocular pressure and through testing for its non-inferiority when compared with other conventional treatment modalities. Method Literature search of Pubmed, EMBASE, CENTRAL, dissertation and thesis databases and hand search of relevant journals was performed for the use of <b>selective</b> <b>laser</b> trabeculoplasty in the treatment of open angle glaucoma. English and Chinese articles were included. Meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials comparing treatment efficacy of <b>selective</b> <b>laser</b> trabeculoplasty and other treatment modalities were performed where appropriate. Results 80 articles were identified to be relevant and provided sufficient data for interpretation for efficacy or safety assessment. It was estimated that <b>selective</b> <b>laser</b> trabeculoplasty resulted in a weighted pooled mean intraocular pressure reduction of 21. 9 to 23. 8 % at different follow-up durations. However, sensitivity analysis including only prospective studies with baseline IOP less than 21 mmHg did not show significant IOP lowering effect. Review on side effects of <b>selective</b> <b>laser</b> trabeculoplasty showed a good safety profile in general. Rare occurrences of more severe or long-term complications included persistent intraocular pressure spike requiring surgery, persistent macular edema and corneal haze. Meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials showed that <b>selective</b> <b>laser</b> trabeculoplasty is non-inferior to argon laser trabeculoplasty and medication in intraocular pressure reduction and also in achieving treatment success. Number of medication reduction is similar between <b>selective</b> <b>laser</b> trabeculoplasty and argon laser trabeculoplasty. Conclusion This report demonstrated comparable efficacy of <b>selective</b> <b>laser</b> trabeculoplasty with argon laser trabeculoplasty and medication therapy in the treatment of open angle glaucoma. published_or_final_versionPublic HealthMasterMaster of Public Healt...|$|R

Bulk titanium is the gold standard of metallic implant materials, but does not match the mechanical properties of the surrounding bone, potentially leading to problems of fixation and bone resorption. As an alternative, nickel–titanium alloys possess a unique combination of mechanical properties including a relatively low elastic modulus, pseudoelasticity, and high damping capacity, matching the properties of bone better than any other metallic material. With the ultimate goal of fabricating porous implants for spinal, orthopedic and dental applications, nickel–titanium substrates were fabricated by means of <b>selective</b> <b>laser</b> melting.
