40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a multi-frequency band receiver comprising a first receiving path, a second receiving path, a combiner, a code multiplex base band stage and an amplifier controller. The first receiving path receives and processes a first code <b>multiplex</b> <b>signal</b> {{and the second}} receiving path receives and processes a second code <b>multiplex</b> <b>signal.</b> For this purpose the first receiving path or the second receiving path has an amplifier having a variable amplification factor.

40|$|A novel compressive-sensing based <b>signal</b> <b>multiplexing</b> {{scheme is}} {{proposed}} {{in this paper}} to further improve the multiplexing gain for {{multiple input multiple output}} (MIMO) system. At the transmitter side, a Gaussian random measurement matrix in compressive sensing is employed before the traditional spatial multiplexing in order to carry more data streams on the available spatial multiplexing streams of the underlying MIMO system. At the receiver side, it is proposed to reformulate the detection of the <b>multiplexing</b> <b>signal</b> into two steps. In the first step, the traditional MIMO equalization can be used to restore the transmitted spatial <b>multiplexing</b> <b>signal</b> of the MIMO system. While in the second step, the standard optimization based detection algorithm assumed in the compressive sensing framework is utilized to restore the CS multiplexing data streams, wherein the exhaustive over-complete dictionary is used to guarantee the sparse representation of the CS <b>multiplexing</b> <b>signal.</b> In order to avoid the excessive complexity, the sub-block based dictionary and the sub-block based CS restoration is proposed. Finally, simulation results are presented to show the feasibility of the proposed CS based enhanced MIMO multiplexing scheme.

This shows that our antenna spacing satisfied {{the criterion for}} achieving the maximum MIMO capacity in LOS situations by proper positioning or spacing of the antenna elements {{in such a way}} to achieve orthogonality between spatially <b>multiplexed</b> <b>signals</b> of MIMO systems, resulting in a high-rank channel response matrix. In conclusion, all the maximum capacity values were achieved at near-range LOS and the measured capacity shows very close agreement with the theoretical values of optimal LOS MIMO capacity with very small variations which we attribute to minor inaccuracies in the positioning and orientation of the antenna elements. This validates the LOS maximum capacity criterion for achieving orthogonality between spatially <b>multiplexed</b> <b>signals</b> of MIMO systems in LOS channels by employing specifically designed antenna arrays.|$|R
40|$|When transmultiplexers with {{overlapping}} {{frequency bands}} {{are used for}} the transmission of data over non-ideal channels, intersymbol interference and crosstalk between different data channels will arise. This paper addresses the design of optimal linear networks that reduce the effects mentioned above. A receiver structure based {{on a combination of}} crosstalk reduction, memory truncation and Viterbi detection will be proposed. The filter design method presented here is based on the maximization of a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the detector input. The SNR will be defined for channel memories being truncated to arbitrary lengths. Thus, low-complexity Viterbi detectors working independently for all data channels can be used. The design of minimummean squares error (MMSE) equalizer networks is included in the framework. 1 INTRODUCTION Transmultiplexers are systems that convert time-division <b>multiplexed</b> <b>signals</b> into frequency-division <b>multiplexed</b> <b>signals</b> and vice versa.
