40|$|G r o w i n g and {{harvesting}} pupae Because bigger pupae {{are easier to}} dissect, it is convenient to allow larvae to grow fat in non-crowded conditions. Standard cornmeal or Wheeler-Clayton (Yoon, 1985; <b>see</b> <b>recipe</b> hereafter) medium is appropriate for D. melanogaster. Set 30 - 50 mature adults per glass vial (height: 10 cm; diameter: 2. 5 cm) and transfer them every other day. When many pupae have reached the desired stage, spread water on the vial wall, wait about 2 minutes and harvest them from the vial wall with a spatula. Clean them gently in a mesh basket with water using a squeeze bottle and sort them under the dissecting scope. Alternative method: After adult flies {{have been removed from}} the vial, use a spatula o r a glass wand to place a folded square of wet Acclaim or Kleenex facial tissue {{on the wall of the}} vial, about 1 mm above the food. Clean the tools, hands and work bench with 70 % ethanol before manipulation to prevent mold contamination. The square of tissue must be kept moist. Mature third instar larvae will crawl out of the food and pupate into the paper. The moisture will keep the pupae healthy and allow easy harvesting and staging of many clean pupae. Staging pupae The most accurate staging of pupae requires histological sections (Madhavan and Madhavan, 1980). However, reliable estimation is possible for some stages, based on external features that become apparent during pupal life.

40|$|In {{this work}} {{we intend to}} {{eliminate}} the idea that laboratory exercises seem like cookbooks. That is, exercises shall be presented as a problematic situation. Based on observation and experimentation, the students should determine the E-Z configuration of maleic and fumaric acids. The basis of this laboratory exercise is the acid-catalyzed isomerization of maleic acid to fumaric acid. Students are given the starting material, reagents and the experimental procedure. They are told that the starting material is a dicarboxylic acid containing a C=C double bond of formula C 4 H 4 O 4. Students determine melting points, solubilities, acidity and chromatographic patterns for both the starting material and the product, so that a configuration of each acid can be proposed. This type of experiment yields excellent results, because the students are left to deduce that maleic acid is less stable than fumaric acid. Additionally, they conclude that maleic acid is the "Z" isomer and fumaric acid is the "E" isomer. Finally, this laboratory exercise allows the students to develop simultaneously their critical-thinking skills with the respective laboratory techniques and not to <b>see</b> chemistry as <b>recipes</b> to be followed...|$|R

As this chimed in with Mr Dombey's own hope and belief, it gave that gentleman a still higher opinion of Mrs Pipchin's understanding; and as Mrs Pipchin, at the same time, bewailed the loss of her dear little friend (which was not an overwhelming shock to her, as she had long expected it, and had not looked, in the beginning, for his remaining with her longer than three months), he formed an equally good opinion of Mrs Pipchin's disinterestedness. It was plain that he had given the subject anxious consideration, for he had formed a plan, which he announced to the ogress, of sending Paul to the Doctor's as a weekly boarder for the first half year, during which time Florence would remain at the Castle, that she might receive her brother there, on Saturdays.

5000|$|Bane makes a cameo {{appearance}} in Batman Beyond. In the episode [...] "The Winning Edge", Bane's Venom formula is delivered in patch form as an influx called 'slappers' and distributed {{on the streets}} of the future version of Gotham and even given to teenagers, including Mason Forrest (voiced by Ian Ziering). The new Batman (Terry McGinnis) encounters Mason and his two friends burglarizing stores, resulting in Mason using some slappers to easily overpower Batman and make their escape. After Terry sees Mason acquiring slappers from a supplier, Bane is initially suspected to be the supplier. But after tracking him down, Batman learns that a lifetime of Venom usage has taken its toll on the once formidable villain and that he's now a frail old man using a wheelchair and reliant on an oxygen tank and the support of a nurse due to years of substance abuse. Meanwhile, Mason's addiction has only gotten worse. When Mason goes to the supplier's next drop off, Batman interrupts the delivery with Mason pathetically trying to run after the car and is easily apprehended. Batman eventually discovers the supplier is actually Jackson Chappell (voiced by Larry Drake), the nurse/caretaker that was entrusted with the Venom formula when Bane had gotten too addicted to even operate normally without the <b>recipe.</b> <b>Seeing</b> this as an opportunity for money, Chappell mass-produces and sells the slappers for a profit. To fight the second Dark Knight, Jackson induces himself with his own Venom patches to bulk himself up to defeat Batman only to be exposed to more Venom patches. As a result, Chappell is left brain-dead from the overdose. After Batman breaks up Chappell's slapper ring, Mason and his friends are arrested.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the {{ground-breaking}} research {{in the study of}} languages in doctoral education. It argues for democratizing the production and dissemination of original contributions to knowledge through activating and mobilizing multilingual Higher Degree Researchers’ (HDRs) capabilities for theorizing through them using their full linguistic repertoire. This paper contributes to this study’s development of post-monolingual research methodology which provides a theoretic-pedagogical framework for multilingual HDRs (a) to use their full linguistic repertoire in their research; (b) to develop their capabilities for theorizing and (c) to construct potentially valuable theoretical tools using metaphors, images, concepts and modes of critique. This paper is based on a longitudinal program of collaborative research whereby monolingual Anglophone and multilingual HDRs jointly developed their capabilities for theorizing through producing Anglo-Chinese analytical tools, and the associated pedagogies for using their languages in doctoral research. This longitudinal research program has been undertaken in the field of doctoral education to further a defining feature of democracy, namely linguistic diversity. This research has been conducted with the aims of promoting the multilingualism of Australian universities and activating linguistic communities of scholars to use their full linguistic repertoire in their research. The main finding arising from this program of research has been the development of post-monolingual research methodology which (a) uses the divergences within and between languages to undertake theorizing and (b) in co-existence with the tensions posed by monolingualism, especially the insistence on using extant theories available in only one language. Doctoral pedagogies of intellectual/racial equality provide multilingual HDRs with insights into the debates about the geopolitics governing the use of languages in the production and dissemination of theoretical knowledge and the capabilities for theorizing. Often, from an English-only monolingual mindset, difference and divergence are <b>seen</b> as a <b>recipe</b> for deficits and dissonance. However, this paper challenges such mistaken beliefs by showing that multilingual HDRs can deepen and extend their capabilities for theorizing by using their own linguistic repertoires. Post-monolingual research methodology is to be of enormous benefit to multilingual researchers and scholars engaged in intellectual labor in predominantly English-only monolingual universities...|$|R
40|$|A {{large amount}} of world's {{hydrocarbon}} reserves lies in reservoirs {{where one of the}} key features is the presence of a system of fractures spanning different length scales. Fractures may provide ways to drain the matrix, but they also drive gas and water towards wells. Fractures intensity, geometry and conductivity are characterised in conjunction with matrix properties using all possible data, such as production logging, mud-losses, image log, well test, geophysics and outcrops. This may lead to a geometrical characterisation in terms of a discrete fracture network (DFN), with the definition of a set of geometrical 2 D objects embedded in the matrix domain. A DFN is a computational challenge for conventional dual-porosity simulators, where a dual medium formulation is cast in a corner point geometry grid (CPG). In this context small, with respect to CPG grid spacing, fractures can be easily incorporated using some practical <b>recipes,</b> <b>see</b> Dershowitz et al. (2000), in single porosity or in dual-porosity models. On the other hand, long range, interconnected fractures cannot be integrated in the simulation model unless some crude approximation is implemented in order to fit the fracture network geometry into the Warren and Root (1963) dual media framework, at least as it is available in conventional commercial simulators, see e. g, Eclipse (2011). A more accurate solution is the implementation of unstructured gridding where the matrix is discretized by tetrahedral or more general polyhedra and the fractures are discretized using 2 D polygons. These grids can be used with finite volume, connectivity based reservoir simulators (see Karimi-fard et al. (2004)), but the approach is computationally inefficient for most of the commercial simulators, and this motivated the development of the EDFM by Li and Lee (2008). In this approach the intersections between fractures and matrix blocks define the degrees of freedom (DOFs) for the high connectivity medium. Then, 2 D flow between fracture DOFs and 1 D flow between fractures and matrix can be integrated with 3 D flow in the CPG grid representing the matrix. In a nut-shell, an unstructured grid for the fracture network is comined with a structured grid for the matrix. Differently from Li and Lee (2008), our implementation is not based on the customisation of the reservoir simulator. Rather, we exploit the capability of most commercial simulators to define non neighbouring connections across grid cells to implement EDFM in a non-invasive manner. Our results confirm that EDFM can be as effective as fully unstructured gridding but much more computationally efficient...|$|R
