No sign was discerned of a trend towards an increasing morbidity-risk for <b>senile</b> <b>psychosis</b> in the different age-groups, the increasing number of admissions to hospitals being due to other, mainly social and economic, causes. This finding is of interest {{in the light of the}} cautious conclusion reached in Sweden that the increased economic burden created by the growing number of old persons can largely be offset by an increase in the relative number of able-bodied persons in the higher age-groups...|$|E
