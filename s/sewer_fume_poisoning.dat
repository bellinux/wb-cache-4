40|$|ABSTRACT: Mine fire is a {{very complex}} {{physicochemical}} process. Once it happens, there are lots of poisonous and harmful gas ingredients while the oxygen density is greatly reduced. Such gas will cause poison, suffocation or death if it is inhaled. As we know, the main cause of great amount of person losses during mine fire is <b>fume</b> <b>poison</b> and suffocation. Additionally, the fume caused by the fire will block the vision and decrease the visibility, which will impede human evacuation and fire fighting. Moreover, due to the turbulent airflow of ventilation network during mine fire period, it is easy to cause the gas and coal dust explosion. So it is very important for the evacuation of miners and mining salvation to research the air flow control during mine fire. *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed...|$|R
5000|$|On {{the evening}} of January 10, 1940, {{in a hotel room}} in San Francisco, Gardner wrote four notes; one of them he {{attached}} to the door, warning: [...] "Do not open door. Poison gas. Call police." [...] He sealed the door from the inside, then killed himself by dropping cyanide into a glass of acid and inhaling the <b>poison</b> <b>fumes.</b>|$|R

They endeavored to establish a distinction, by the belief of which they hoped to keep the spirit of murder safely bottled up and sealed for their own purposes, without endangering themselves by the <b>fumes</b> of the <b>poison</b> which they prepared for their enemies.|$|R
50|$|The Baie de Baly National Park is {{the only}} known natural habitat of the {{critically}} endangered Angonoka tortoise or ploughshare tortoise (Astrochelys yniphora).Other rare animals found in this park is the Madagascan sideneck turtle (Erymnochelys madagascariensis), {{as well as the}} dugong, a marine mammal and the Madagascar fish eagle. There are also thirteen species of mammals, (six primates), 37 reptile species, eight amphibian species and 122 species of birds. There is also the Perrierbambus madagascariensis, an endemic bamboo. The poisonous tree, Erythrophleum couminga (locally named komanga) is also endemic to this region and can be found in and outside the park. It is a very hard wood but cannot be used for cooking as its <b>fumes</b> contain a <b>poison.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The fear {{of disease}} and spread of panic dates back many centuries and {{continues}} into the 21st century with diseases such as AIDS, Ebola, H1N1, Zika, and SARS. Cohen's idea of the [...] "folk devil" [...] and epidemics can be compared because of their role in spreading mass panic and fear. The intense concentration on hygiene emerged, before the 20th century, with a medical belief referred to as miasma. The miasma theory states that disease was {{the direct result of}} the polluting emanations of filth: <b>sewer</b> gas, garbage <b>fumes,</b> and stenches that polluted air and water, which results in an epidemic. The Great Stink of 1858 was blamed on miasma, along with reoccurring cholera epidemics during the Victorian era. Although the water was safe to drink in most parts of London, such a panic had arisen that very few people would dare drink the water.|$|R
5000|$|The French {{soldiers}} were naturally taken by surprise. Some got away in time, but many, alas! not understanding the new danger, {{were not so}} fortunate, and were overcome by the <b>fumes</b> and died <b>poisoned.</b> Among those who escaped nearly all cough and spit blood, the chlorine-attacking the mucous membrane. The dead were turned black at once. About 15 minutes after letting the gas escape the Germans got out of their trenches. Some of them were sent on in advance, with masks over their heads, to ascertain if the air had become breathable. Having discovered that they could advance, they arrived in large numbers in the area on which the gas had spread itself some minutes before, and took possession of {{the arms of the}} dead men. They made no prisoners. Whenever they saw a soldier whom the fumes had not quite killed they snatched away his rifle and advised him to lie down [...] "to die better."

50|$|Takemikazuchi's sword aided Jimmu in his subjugation of the east. At Kumano, {{the emperor}} and his troops were either struck {{unconscious}} {{by the appearance}} of a bear (Kojiki) or severely debilitated by the <b>poison</b> <b>fumes</b> spewed out by local gods (Nihon shoki). But a man named Takakuraji presented a gift of a sword, the emperor awoke, and without him hardly brandishing this weapon, the evil deities of Kumano were spontaneously cut down. When Jimmu inquired, Takkuraji explained that he had a vision in a dream where the supreme deities Amaterasu and Takamusubi were about to command Takemikazuchi to descend to earth once again to pacify the lands, this time to assist the emperor. However, Takemizuchi replied that it would be sufficient to send down the sword he used during his campaigns, and, boring a hole through Takakuraji's storehouse, deposited the sword, bidding the man to present it to Emperor Jimmu. That sword bore the names of Futsu-no-mitama ("August-Snap-Spirit"), Saji-futsu-no-kami ("Deity Thrust-Snap"), Mika-futsu no kami ("Deity Awful-Snap"). This sword is the main dedication (goshintai) kept at Isonokami Shrine.|$|R
60|$|Three {{bodies in}} Paris were, each of them, {{the centre of}} an {{influence}} that might at any moment become the triumphant rival of the Committee of Public Safety. These bodies were, first, the Convention; second, the Commune of Paris; and thirdly, the Jacobin Club. The jealousy thus existing outside the Committee would have made any failure instantly destructive. At one moment, {{at the end of}} 1793, it was only the surrender of Toulon that saved the Committee from a hostile motion in the Convention, and such a motion would have sent half of them to the guillotine. They were reviled by the extreme party who ruled at the Town Hall for not carrying the policy of extermination far enough. They were reproached by Danton and his powerful section for carrying that policy too far. They were discredited by the small band of intriguers, like Bazire, who identified government with peculation. Finally, they were haunted by the shadow of a fear, which events were by and by to prove only too substantial, lest one of their military agents on the frontier should make himself their master. The key to the struggle of the factions between the winter of 1793 and the revolution of the summer of 1794 is the vigorous resolve of the governing Committees not to part with power. The drama {{is one of the most}} exciting in the history of faction; it abounds in rapid turns and unexpected shifts, upon which the student may spend many a day and many a night, and after all he is forced to leave off in despair of threading an accurate way through the labyrinth of passion and intrigue. The broad traits of the situation, however, are tolerably simple. The difficulty was to find a principle of government which the people could be induced to accept. 'The rights of men and the new principles of liberty and equality,' Burke said, 'were very unhandy instruments for those who wished to establish a system of tranquillity and order. The factions,' he added with fierce sarcasm, 'were to accomplish the purposes of order, morality, and submission to the laws, from the principles of atheism, profligacy, and sedition. They endeavoured to establish distinctions, by the belief of which they hoped to keep the spirit of murder safely bottled up and sealed for their own purposes, without endangering themselves by the <b>fumes</b> of the <b>poison</b> which they prepared for their enemies.' This is a ferocious and passionate version, but it is substantially not an unreal account of the position.|$|R
