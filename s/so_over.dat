Such a system would cost an estimated $40 billion to build ($ billion in , about half the annual military budget).|$|E
5|$|Between 950,000–1,000,000 of all {{described}} {{species are}} insects, <b>so</b> <b>over</b> 50% of all described eukaryotes (1.8 million) are insects (see illustration). With only 950,000 known non-insects, if {{the actual number}} of insects is 5.5 million, they may represent over 80% of the total, and with only about 20,000 new species of all organisms being described each year, most insect species likely will remain undescribed, unless species descriptions greatly increase in rate. Of the 24 orders of insects, four dominate in terms of numbers of described species, with at least 670,000 species included in Coleoptera, Diptera, Hymenoptera and Lepidoptera.|$|E

5|$|KAL007's {{divergence}} {{prevented the}} aircraft from transmitting its position via shorter range {{very high frequency}} radio (VHF). It therefore requested KAL015, also en route to Seoul, to relay reports to air traffic control on its behalf. KAL007 requested KAL015 to relay its position three times. At 14:43UTC, KAL007 directly transmitted a change of {{estimated time of arrival}} for its next waypoint, NEEVA, to the international flight service station at Anchorage, but it did <b>so</b> <b>over</b> the longer range high frequency radio (HF) rather than VHF. HF transmissions are able to carry a longer distance than VHF, but are vulnerable to electromagnetic interference and static; VHF is clearer with less interference, and preferred by flight crews. The inability to establish direct radio communications to be able to transmit their position directly did not alert the pilots of KAL007 of their ever-increasing divergence and was not considered unusual by air traffic controllers. Halfway between Bethel and waypoint NABIE, KAL007 passed through the southern portion of the North American Aerospace Defense Command buffer zone. This zone is north of Romeo 20 and off-limits to civilian aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The risk of {{building}} an operational reactor running at criticality in a populated area {{was a significant}} issue, as there was a danger of a catastrophic nuclear meltdown blanketing one of the United States' major urban areas in radioactive fission products. But the physics of the system suggested that the pile could be safely shut down even {{in the event of}} a runaway reaction. When a fuel atom undergoes fission, it releases neutrons that strike other fuel atoms in a chain reaction. The time between absorbing the neutron and undergoing fission is measured in nanoseconds. Szilard had noted that this reaction leaves behind fission products that may also release neutrons, but do <b>so</b> <b>over</b> much longer periods, from microseconds to as long as minutes. In a slow reaction like the one in a pile where the fission products build up, these neutrons account for about three percent of the total neutron flux.|$|E

25|$|During the German {{occupation}} of the Channel Islands, there was limited resistance. The islands had a very high number of German soldiers compared to the civilian population, one soldier for every 2-3 civilians, which reduced options; this linked to the severe penalties imposed by the occupiers meant that only forms of non-lethal resistance were used by the population. Even <b>so,</b> <b>over</b> twenty civilians paid the ultimate price for resistance against the occupiers.|$|E

25|$|The pilots {{flew the}} aircraft, which can carry up to 46,860 pounds (21,255kg) of {{aviation}} fuel, in a figure eight pattern between Bob Hope Airport in Burbank and LAX {{for more than}} two hours in order to burn fuel and lower the risk of fire upon landing. This also served to lighten the plane, reducing potential stress on the landing gear and dramatically lowering landing speed as well.

25|$|Although not {{specifically}} prepared to conduct independent strategic air operations against an opponent, the Luftwaffe {{was expected to}} do <b>so</b> <b>over</b> Britain. From July until September 1940 the Luftwaffe attacked Fighter Command to gain air superiority {{as a prelude to}} invasion. This involved the bombing of English Channel convoys, ports, and RAF airfields and supporting industries. Destroying RAF Fighter Command would allow the Germans to gain control of the skies over the invasion area. It was supposed Bomber Command, Coastal Command, and the Royal Navy could not operate under conditions of German air superiority.|$|E
25|$|The {{reason is}} that the {{logarithm}} of the stock price is undergoing a random walk, <b>so</b> <b>over</b> time its probability distribution will get more and more broad and smooth (see above). (More technically, the central limit theorem says that multiplying more and more random variables will create a log-normal distribution with larger and larger variance, so eventually it covers many orders of magnitude almost uniformly.) To be sure of approximate agreement with Benford's Law, the distribution has to be approximately invariant when scaled up by any factor up to 10; a lognormally distributed data set with wide dispersion would have has this approximate property.|$|E
