In 1927 he abandoned his first name in favour of his middle name, and thereafter chose to be known as Richard Sickert. His style and subject matter also changed: Sickert stopped drawing, and instead painted from snapshots usually taken by his third wife, Thérèse Lessore, or from news photographs. The photographs were <b>squared</b> <b>up</b> for enlargement and transferred to canvas, with their pencil grids plainly visible in the finished paintings.|$|E
25|$|The Panorama Elite II range {{built on}} the success of the Panorama I and Panorama Elite. The front grill was <b>squared</b> <b>up</b> {{although}} it still used the same twin headlight layout. The first bay on the near side was tidied up so the top of the window was in line with all the other side windows. Parcel racks were redesigned so the supply of fresh air and light output was more readily available. The service units were now mounted front to back instead of side to side and were much slimmer to maximize on headroom when leaving the seats. Crash padding was provided along the inner side of the racks in the form of black PVC squares filled with padding. The dashboard was again improved as was the front cabinet. The rear of the vehicle still used the soup plates from the previous range.|$|E
25|$|The Consort {{was first}} {{shown at the}} 1956 Commercial Motor Show. It was a {{development}} of the Venturer, but {{in place of the}} previous oval the four-part grill was now enclosed by a near-trapezoidal outline (though actually hexagonal), wider at the top than the bottom, with the headlamps outside. Trim was revised to be much squarer in outline, featuring ribbed brightwork, and the curved rear quarter lights, first standardised on the Venturer III, were now incorporated into the main window line. However, a year later the Consort II was announced, re-introducing the oval grill outline of the Venturer – but now surrounding a plainer grill with chrome flash across the middle - while the trim lines so recently <b>squared</b> <b>up</b> were softened once again. The evident popularity of the oval- shaped grill then ensured its survival as a Plaxton hallmark for many years to come.|$|E

25|$|In July 1989, Plaxton {{bought the}} {{manufacturing}} {{rights for the}} coach products of its main domestic competitor, Duple for £4 million. This included the jigs for the Duple 300 and the Duple 425 integral. Duple Services Ltd., the spares and repair business, was also purchased. The 320 was re-worked by Plaxtons at Scarborough later in 1989 and 25 were built and sold as the Plaxton 321. Many components from the Paramount were used both internally and externally. Identifying traits being the <b>squared</b> <b>up</b> wheel arches and Paramount side mouldings. The 321 was around £6,000 cheaper than a comparable Paramount III. Further batches were considered {{but it is not}} known if they were actually built. The 321 was only available from Kirkby. The 340 with the higher floor was considered but none were built. A modified version of the 425 design was introduced in 1991 and was built by Carrosserie Lorraine, a French coachbuilder Plaxton had recently purchased from Iveco. Only 12 vehicles were manufactured, and Carrosserie Lorraine was subsequently closed in March 1992.|$|E
25|$|In 1971 Kilkenny faced Tipperary in the {{championship}} decider. In the first final broadcast in colour by RTÉ, Eddie Keher scored a record 2 goals and 11 points; however, he still {{ended up on the}} losing side as Tipp won on a score line of 5–17 to 5–14. 1972 saw the only 80-minute final between Kilkenny and Cork. Cork were in firm control in the second half and were eight points ahead. However, Kilkenny upped the ante and won the game by seven points. It was a remarkable fifteen-point turnaround in one of the all-time classic games. In 1973 Kilkenny <b>squared</b> <b>up</b> to Limerick in {{the championship}} decider {{for the first time since}} 1940. Injury, illness and emigration saw a depleted Kilkenny team take on the Munster champions and lose their status as All-Ireland champions. 1974 saw a Kilkenny-Limerick rematch. Limerick stormed into an early lead. However, ‘the Cats’ goalpower secured a 12-point win. In 1975 Kilkenny took on a Galway side that had stunned Cork in the All-Ireland semi-final. Galway led at half-time. However, the Kilkenny men fought back and secured a 12-point victory once again.|$|E

Johanneson had just come off his second defeat to Armenian Leva Kirakosyan, whom Gomez had knocked out in October 2004. Before the fight, Gomez was confident, stating [...] "You can't outbox me. I'll jab your head off. If he comes to have a fight with me {{it is going to}} be early Christmas for {{everyone}} because I don't know who's going to go but someone's going to go and it's not going to be me." [...] At the pre-fight press conference in Doncaster both fighters <b>squared</b> <b>up</b> to each other and promised to knock each other out; during the highly charged face off both fighters had to be kept apart by their promoter and trainers.|$|E

500|$|As {{the field}} was cleared, silence descended on the arena {{following}} the King's [...] instructions that anybody who interfered in the duel would be executed and that anyone who shouted or verbally interrupted the combat would lose a hand. Readying their steeds, the knights <b>squared</b> <b>up</b> and at the marshal's signal, charged towards one another. Their lances struck but failed to penetrate the thick hides covering their shields and the combatants wheeled and charged again, this time striking one another on their helms. Rounding once more, the knights charged a third time, again striking shields and this time both shattering their lances. Reeling from the impact, the warriors drew their axes and charged a fourth time. Slashing and kicking at {{one another in the}} centre of the field, they traded blows until Le Gris, the much stronger man, was able to drive his axe through the neck of Carrouges' horse. As the beheaded beast tumbled to the ground, Carrouges jumped clear and lashed out with his own weapon, disemboweling Le Gris' steed in turn.|$|E
2500|$|... 1966 Chevy IIs {{introduced}} an extensive sharp-edged restyle {{based in part}} on the Super Nova concept car. In general, proportions were <b>squared</b> <b>up</b> but dimensions and features changed little. Highlights included a bold grille and semi-fastback roofline. [...] "Humped" [...] fenders in an angular rear end were reminiscent of larger 1966 Chevrolets, though the 1966 Chevy II and Nova had vertical taillights and single headlights. The lineup again started with Chevy II 100 and Chevy II Nova 400 models.|$|E

[...] That delay proved fatal and was the main contributory cause {{to the loss of}} that magnificent ship and hundreds of lives.

2500|$|In 2004, Cork and Kilkenny <b>squared</b> <b>up</b> to {{the other}} in another All-Ireland final. ‘The Cats’ were going for an {{unprecedented}} three-in-a-row {{and the chance to}} top the all-time roll of honour. [...] Cork, on the other hand, were out to beat them. A rain-soaked day robbed the fans of a classic {{for the second time in}} five years and the first-half left a lot to be desired. Cork took command in the second period of play and scored nine points without reply in the final twenty-three minutes. A 0-17 to 0-9 score line gave Cork the victory and put an end to a Kilkenny treble.|$|E
2500|$|... cut {{and paste}} – taking text, a {{numerical}} table, or an image and pasting it into a document. The term originated when such compound documents were created using manual paste up techniques for typographic page layout. [...] Actual brushes and paste were later replaced by hot-wax machines equipped with cylinders that applied melted adhesive wax to developed prints of [...] "typeset" [...] copy. This copy was then cut out with knives and rulers, and slid into position on layout sheets on slanting layout tables. After the [...] "copy" [...] had been correctly positioned and <b>squared</b> <b>up</b> using a T-square and set square, it was pressed down with a brayer, or roller. The {{whole point of the}} exercise was to create so-called [...] "camera-ready copy" [...] which existed only to be photographed and then printed, usually by offset lithography.|$|E
2500|$|As styling {{development}} commenced it was realised that {{to design}} another coach {{to match the}} success of the Panorama Elite series was to be a challenge. Looking at the existing range of Panorama Elite III it was decided to use the Elite's most striking feature, notably the size of the windows and the curves that departed in every direction. The front of the coach was to follow closely with Elite by utilising the same double headlights with a panel between them (although the centre panel depended on the chassis requirements). The slats again horizontal but were fewer in number and thicker. The sides of the grill were <b>squared</b> <b>up</b> and were of stainless steel and not aluminium. A chrome bumper with [...] overriders at the bottom with two steps to allow access to the windscreen. Pantograph wipers with speed control were added. The dome was slatted on the early models but was not popular so was removed and simplified from Supreme IV. The side profile again had angles going in all directions although the main change to the side was that the windows curved into the cant rail almost like the Mercedes-Benz O302 bodies. The effect was to catch the light and highlighted the whole coach at roof level. The rear was like Panorama Elite with vertical lozenge shaped lights but the units themselves were slightly bigger, squared, more definite.|$|E
