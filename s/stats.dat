40|$|The JAK-STAT {{signaling}} pathway has {{been implicated in}} astrocyte differentiation. Both <b>STAT</b> 1 and <b>STAT</b> 3 are expressed in {{the central nervous system}} and are thought to be important for glial differentiation, as mainly demonstrated in vitro; however direct in vivo evidence is missing. We investigated whether <b>STAT</b> 1 and <b>STAT</b> 3 are essential for astrocyte development by testing the <b>STAT</b> responsiveness of astrocyte progenitors. <b>STAT</b> 3 was absent in the ventricular zone where glial progenitors are born but begins to appear at the marginal zone at E 16. 5. At E 18. 5, both phospho-STAT 1 and phospho-STAT 3 were present in glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) -expressing white matter astrocytes. Overexpression of <b>STAT</b> 3 by electroporation of chicks in ovo induced increased numbers of astrocyte progenitors in the spinal cord. Likewise, elimination of <b>STAT</b> 3 in <b>Stat</b> 3 conditional knockout (cKO) mice resulted in depletion of white matter astrocytes. Interestingly, elimination of <b>STAT</b> 1 in <b>Stat</b> 1 null mice did not inhibit astrocyte differentiation and deletion of <b>Stat</b> 1 failed to aggravate the glial defects in <b>Stat</b> 3 cKO mice. Measuring the activity of <b>STAT</b> binding elements and the gfap promoter in the presence of various <b>STAT</b> mutants revealed that transactivation depended on the activity of <b>STAT</b> 3 not <b>STAT</b> 1. No synergistic interaction between <b>STAT</b> 1 and <b>STAT</b> 3 was observed. Cortical progenitors of <b>Stat</b> 1 null; <b>Stat</b> 3 cKO mice generated astrocytes when <b>STAT</b> 3 or the splice variant <b>Stat</b> 3 b was supplied, but not when <b>STAT</b> 1 was introduced. Together, our results suggest that <b>STAT</b> 3 is necessary and sufficient for astrocyte differentiation whereas <b>STAT</b> 1 is dispensable...|$|R
40|$|Tyrosine {{phosphorylation}} regulates cytokine-induced dimerization of <b>STAT</b> proteins. Serine phosphorylation {{has also}} been found to occur {{in a number of}} <b>STAT</b> proteins, including <b>Stat</b> 1, Sat 3, <b>Stat</b> 4, <b>Stat</b> 5 a, <b>Stat</b> 5 b and <b>Stat</b> 6, and was shown to be important for maximal transcriptional activation mediated by <b>Stat</b> 1, <b>Stat</b> 3 and <b>Stat</b> 4, but not for <b>Stat</b> 5 a or <b>Stat</b> 5 b. As these latter proteins were studied in transiently transfected COS- 7 cells stimulated with prolactin, we sought to further investigate the signi®cance of their serine phosphorylation in a more physiologically based system in response to IL- 2. Both <b>Stat</b> 5 a and <b>Stat</b> 5 b were rapidly phosphorylated on serine in response to IL- 2 and the phosphorylation site in <b>Stat</b> 5 a was mapped to Ser 780, which is not conserved in <b>Stat</b> 5 b. In vitro studies with reporter constructs, and experiments in which wild-type and mutant <b>Stat</b> 5 a retroviruses were used to transduce <b>Stat</b> 5 a-de®cient splenocytes revealed that the serine mutant constructs were not diminished in their ability to mediate IL- 2 signaling and if anything exhibited augmented proliferative capability. Thus, in contrast to the apparent importance of serine phosphorylation for transcriptional activation by <b>Stat</b> 1, <b>Stat</b> 3 and <b>Stat</b> 4 in response to IFN, IL- 6 and IL- 12 respectively, serine phosphorylation of <b>Stat</b> 5 a does not enhance <b>Stat</b> 5 a-mediated signaling in response to IL- 2...|$|R
40|$|There {{are seven}} {{mammalian}} signal transducer and activator of transcription (<b>Stat)</b> proteins that act downstream of cytokine and growth factor receptors to mediate rapid changes in gene expression. The mammalian <b>Stat</b> 5 a and <b>Stat</b> 5 b genes show high sequence identity and lie adjacent in a head-to-head configuration {{next to the}} <b>Stat</b> 3 gene, apparently {{the result of a}} relatively recent mammal-specific gene duplication event. We have identified and characterized two <b>stat</b> 5 homologues that are expressed in zebrafish, named <b>stat</b> 5. 1 and <b>stat</b> 5. 2. The <b>stat</b> 5. 1 gene shows a high level of conservation with the single <b>stat</b> 5 gene found in other teleosts and lies next to the <b>stat</b> 3 gene, in the same relative orientation as the mammalian <b>Stat</b> 5 b gene. In contrast, the <b>stat</b> 5. 2 gene lies on a different chromosome to <b>stat</b> 5. 1 and <b>stat</b> 3, and has diverged from the <b>stat</b> 5 genes of other teleosts, with no apparent orthologue.

40|$|We {{previously}} {{developed a}} transcription factor decoy targeting signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (<b>STAT</b> 3) and reported antitumor activity in both in vitro and {{in vivo models}} of squamous cell carcinoma {{of the head and}} neck (SCCHN). Based on the known existence of <b>STAT</b> 1 -STAT 3 heterodimers, the high sequence homology between <b>STAT</b> 1 and <b>STAT</b> 3, as well as expression of both <b>STAT</b> 1 and <b>STAT</b> 3 in SCCHN, we examined whether the <b>STAT</b> 3 decoy interferes with <b>STAT</b> 1 signaling. SCCHN cell lines with different <b>STAT</b> 1 expression levels (but similar <b>STAT</b> 3 levels) were used. Both cell lines were sensitive to the growth-inhibitory effects of the <b>STAT</b> 3 decoy compared with a mutant control decoy. Intact <b>STAT</b> 1 signaling was demonstrated by interferon-γ (IFN-γ) -mediated induction of <b>STAT</b> 1 phosphorylation (Tyr 701) and interferon-regulatory factor- 1 (IRF- 1) expression. Treatment with the <b>STAT</b> 3 decoy (but not a mutant control decoy) resulted in inhibition of IRF- 1 protein expression in both cell lines, indicating specific inhibition of <b>STAT</b> 1 signaling by the <b>STAT</b> 3 decoy. Because <b>STAT</b> 1 is a potential tumor suppressor, we also investigated whether <b>STAT</b> 1 signaling mitigated the therapeutic efficacy of the <b>STAT</b> 3 decoy. In both PCI- 15 B and UM- 22 B cells, <b>STAT</b> 1 siRNA treatment resulted in decreased <b>STAT</b> 1 expression, without altering the antitumor activity of the <b>STAT</b> 3 decoy. Likewise, the antitumor effects of the <b>STAT</b> 3 decoy were not altered by <b>STAT</b> 1 activation upon IFN-γ treatment. These results suggest that the therapeutic mechanisms of <b>STAT</b> 3 blockade using a transcription factor decoy are independent of <b>STAT</b> 1 activation.

40|$|<b>Stat</b> 3 beta is a {{short form}} of <b>Stat</b> 3 that differs from the longer form (<b>Stat</b> 3 alpha) by the {{replacement}} of the C-terminal 55 amino acid residues of <b>Stat</b> 3 alpha by 7 residues specific to <b>Stat</b> 3 beta. In COS cells transfected with <b>Stat</b> 3 expression plasmids, both <b>Stat</b> 3 alpha and <b>Stat</b> 3 beta were activated for DNA binding and transcription by the same set of growth factors and cytokines and both, when activated, formed homodimers and heterodimers with <b>Stat</b> 1. Only <b>Stat</b> 3 beta was active in the absence of added cytokine or growth factor. Activation of each form, including constitutive activation of <b>Stat</b> 3 beta, was correlated with the phosphorylation of tyrosine 705. Activated <b>Stat</b> 3 beta in transfected COS cells was more stable and had greater DNA-binding activity than activated <b>Stat</b> 3 alpha. However, relative to DNA-binding activity, <b>Stat</b> 3 alpha showed greater transcriptional activity than <b>Stat</b> 3 beta. A mutant of <b>Stat</b> 3 alpha lacking its highly acidic C-terminal 48 amino acids had properties indistinguishable from <b>Stat</b> 3 beta. We conclude that <b>Stat</b> 3 alpha and <b>Stat</b> 3 beta have significantly different properties due to {{the presence or absence of}} the acidic C-terminal tail of <b>Stat</b> 3 alpha rather than the C-terminal sequence peculiar to <b>Stat</b> 3 beta. In addition to its effect on transcription, we speculate that the acidic tail may destabilize the active dimeric form of <b>Stat</b> 3 alpha, resulting in lower DNA-binding activity of the Y 705 -phosphorylated form compared to <b>Stat</b> 3 beta and in more rapid dephosphorylation...|$|R
40|$|The {{transcription}} factor <b>STAT</b> 1 {{is essential for}} interferon (IFN) -mediated immunity in humans andmice. <b>STAT</b> 1 function is tightly regulated, and both loss- and gain-of-functionmutations result in severe immune diseases. The two alternatively spliced isoforms, <b>STAT</b> 1 and <b>STAT</b> 1, differ with regard to a C-terminal transactivation domain, which is absent in <b>STAT</b> 1. <b>STAT</b> 1 {{is considered to be}} transcriptionally inactive and to be a competitive inhibitor of <b>STAT</b> 1. To investigate the functions of the <b>STAT</b> 1 isoforms in vivo, we generated mice deficient for either <b>STAT</b> 1 or <b>STAT</b> 1. As expected, the functions of <b>STAT</b> 1 and <b>STAT</b> 1 in IFN-/- and IFN [...] dependent antiviral activity are largely redundant. In contrast to the current dogma, however, we found that <b>STAT</b> 1 is transcriptionally active in response to IFN-. In the absence of <b>STAT</b> 1, <b>STAT</b> 1 shows more pro-longed IFN [...] induced phosphorylation and promoter binding. Both isoformsmediate protective, IFN [...] dependent immunity against the bacterium Listeria monocytogenes, although with remarkably different efficiencies. Our data shed new light on the potential contributions of the individual <b>STAT</b> 1 isoforms to <b>STAT</b> 1 -dependent immune responses. Knowledge of <b>STAT</b> 1 ’s function will help fine-tune diagnostic approaches and help design more specific strategies to interfere with <b>STAT</b> 1 activity...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAlternative {{splicing}} of {{the gene}} for <b>Stat</b> 3, a transcription factor activated by the IL- 6 family of cytokines, produces two isoforms: <b>Stat</b> 3 α and a dominant-negative variant, <b>Stat</b> 3 β. <b>Stat</b> 3 β-deficient mice were generated by gene targeting. Despite intact expression and phosphorylation of <b>Stat</b> 3 α, overall <b>Stat</b> 3 activity was impaired in <b>Stat</b> 3 β−/− cells. Global comparison of transcription in <b>Stat</b> 3 β+/+ and <b>Stat</b> 3 β−/− cells revealed stable differences. <b>Stat</b> 3 β-deficient mice exhibit diminished recovery from endotoxic shock and hyperresponsiveness of a subset of endotoxin-inducible genes in liver. The hepatic response to endotoxin in wild-type mice {{is accompanied by a}} transient increase in the ratio of <b>Stat</b> 3 β to <b>Stat</b> 3 α.

40|$|Abstract Background The Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (<b>STAT</b> 3) is {{activated}} in tumor cells, and <b>STAT</b> 3 -inhibitors {{are able to}} induce the death of those cells. Decoy oligodeoxynucleotides (dODNs), which bind to the DNA Binding Domain (DBD) of <b>STAT</b> 3, are efficient inhibitors. However, they also inhibit <b>STAT</b> 1, whose activity is essential not only to resistance to pathogens, but also to cell growth inhibition and programmed cell death processes. The {{aim of this study}} was to design <b>STAT</b> 3 -specific dODNs which do not affect <b>STAT</b> 1 -mediated processes. Results New dODNs with a hairpin (hpdODNs) were designed. Modifications were introduced, based on the comparison of <b>STAT</b> 3 - and <b>STAT</b> 1 -DBD interactions with DNA using 3 D structural analyses. The designed hpdODNs were tested for their ability to inhibit <b>STAT</b> 3 but not <b>STAT</b> 1 by determining: i) cell death in the active <b>STAT</b> 3 -dependent SW 480 colon carcinoma cell line, ii) absence of inhibition of interferon (IFN) γ-dependent cell death, iii) expression of <b>STAT</b> 1 targets, and iv) nuclear location of <b>STAT</b> 3 and <b>STAT</b> 1. One hpdODN was found to efficiently induce the death of SW 480 cells without interfering with IFNγ-activated <b>STAT</b> 1. This hpdODN was found in a complex with <b>STAT</b> 3 but not with <b>STAT</b> 1 using an original in-cell pull-down assay; this hpdODN also did not inhibit IFNγ-induced <b>STAT</b> 1 phosphorylation, nor did it inhibit the expression of the <b>STAT</b> 1 -target IRF 1. Furthermore, it prevented the nuclear transfer of <b>STAT</b> 3 but not that of IFNγ-activated <b>STAT</b> 1. Conclusions Comparative analyses at the atomic level revealed slight differences in <b>STAT</b> 3 and <b>STAT</b> 1 DBDs' interaction with their DNA target. These were sufficient to design a new discriminating hpdODN that inhibits <b>STAT</b> 3 and not <b>STAT</b> 1, thereby inducing tumor cell death without interfering with <b>STAT</b> 1 -dependent processes. Preferential interaction with <b>STAT</b> 3 depends on oligodeoxynucleotide sequence modifications but might also result from DNA shape changes, known to modulate protein/DNA interactions. The finding of a <b>STAT</b> 3 -specific hpdODN establishes the first rational basis for designing <b>STAT</b> 3 DBD-specific inhibitors. </p...|$|R
40|$|Signal {{transducer}} and activator of transcription 3 (<b>STAT</b> 3) is {{a latent}} cytoplasmic transcription factor {{that can be}} activated by cytokines and growth factors. It plays important roles in cell growth, apoptosis and cell transformation, and is constitutively active {{in a variety of}} tumor cells. In this study, we provide evidence that zipper-interacting protein kinase (ZIPK) interacts physically with <b>STAT</b> 3. ZIPK specifically interacted with <b>STAT</b> 3, and did not bind to <b>STAT</b> 1, <b>STAT</b> 4, <b>STAT</b> 5 a, <b>STAT</b> 5 b or <b>STAT</b> 6. ZIPK phosphorylated <b>STAT</b> 3 on serine 727 (Ser 727) and enhanced <b>STAT</b> 3 transcriptional activity. Small interfering RNA-mediated reduction of ZIPK expression decreased leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) - and IL- 6 -induced <b>STAT</b> 3 -dependent transcription. Furthermore, LIF- and IL- 6 -mediated <b>STAT</b> 3 activation stimulated ZIPK activity. Taken together, our data suggest that ZIPK interacts with <b>STAT</b> 3 within the nucleus to regulate the transcriptional activity of <b>STAT</b> 3 via phosphorylation of Ser 727...|$|R

40|$|Since its {{discovery}} in mice and humans 19 years ago, {{the contribution of}} alternatively spliced <b>Stat</b> 3, <b>Stat</b> 3 β, to the overall functions of <b>Stat</b> 3 has been controversial. Tyrosine-phosphorylated (p) <b>Stat</b> 3 β homodimers are more stable, bind DNA more avidly, are less susceptible to dephosphorylation, and exhibit distinct intracellular dynamics, most notably markedly prolonged nuclear retention, compared to pStat 3 α homodimers. Overexpression of {{one or the other}} isoform in cell lines demonstrated that <b>Stat</b> 3 β acted as a dominant-negative of <b>Stat</b> 3 α in transformation assays; however, studies with mouse strains deficient in one or the other isoform indicated distinct contributions of <b>Stat</b> 3 isoforms to inflammation. Current immunological reagents cannot differentiate <b>Stat</b> 3 β proteins derived from alternative splicing vs. proteolytic cleavage of <b>Stat</b> 3 α. We developed monoclonal antibodies that recognize the 7 C-terminal amino acids unique to <b>Stat</b> 3 β (CT 7) and do not cross-react with <b>Stat</b> 3 α. Immunoblotting studies revealed that levels of <b>Stat</b> 3 β protein, but not <b>Stat</b> 3 α, in breast cancer cell lines positively correlated with overall pStat 3 levels, suggesting that <b>Stat</b> 3 β may contribute to constitutive <b>Stat</b> 3 activation in this tumor system. The ability to unambiguously discriminate splice alternative <b>Stat</b> 3 β from proteolytic <b>Stat</b> 3 β and <b>Stat</b> 3 α will provide new insights into the contribution of <b>Stat</b> 3 β vs. <b>Stat</b> 3 α to oncogenesis, as well as other biological and pathological processes...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The {{transcription}} factor <b>STAT</b> 3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) is frequently activated in tumor cells. Activated <b>STAT</b> 3 forms homodimers, or heterodimers with other TFs such as NF-κB, which becomes activated. Cytoplasmic <b>STAT</b> 3 dimers are activated by tyrosine phosphorylation; {{they interact with}} importins via a nuclear localization signal (NLS) {{one of which is}} located within the DNA-binding domain formed by the dimer. In the nucleus, <b>STAT</b> 3 regulates target gene expression by binding a consensus sequence within the promoter. <b>STAT</b> 3 -specific decoy oligonucleotides (<b>STAT</b> 3 -decoy ODN) that contain this consensus sequence inhibit the transcriptional activity of <b>STAT</b> 3, leading to cell death; however, their mechanism of action is unclear. Results The mechanism of action of a <b>STAT</b> 3 -decoy ODN was analyzed in the colon carcinoma cell line SW 480. These cells' dependence on activated <b>STAT</b> 3 was verified by showing that cell death is induced by <b>STAT</b> 3 -specific siRNAs or Stattic. <b>STAT</b> 3 -decoy ODN was shown to bind activated <b>STAT</b> 3 within the cytoplasm, and to prevent its translocation to the nucleus, {{as well as that of}} <b>STAT</b> 3 -associated NF-κB, but it did not prevent the nuclear transfer of <b>STAT</b> 3 with mutations in its DNA-binding domain. The complex formed by <b>STAT</b> 3 and the <b>STAT</b> 3 -decoy ODN did not associate with importin, while <b>STAT</b> 3 alone was found to co-immunoprecipitate with importin. Leptomycin B and vanadate both trap <b>STAT</b> 3 in the nucleus. They were found here to oppose the cytoplasmic trapping of <b>STAT</b> 3 by the <b>STAT</b> 3 -decoy ODN. Control decoys consisting of either a mutated <b>STAT</b> 3 -decoy ODN or a NF-κB-specific decoy ODN had no effect on <b>STAT</b> 3 nuclear translocation. Finally, blockage of <b>STAT</b> 3 nuclear transfer correlated with the induction of SW 480 cell death. Conclusions The inhibition of <b>STAT</b> 3 by a <b>STAT</b> 3 -decoy ODN, leading to cell death, involves the entrapment of activated <b>STAT</b> 3 dimers in the cytoplasm. A mechanism is suggested whereby this entrapment is due to <b>STAT</b> 3 -decoy ODN's inhibition of active <b>STAT</b> 3 /importin interaction. These observations point to the high potential of <b>STAT</b> 3 -decoy ODN as a reagent and to <b>STAT</b> 3 nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling in tumor cells as a potential target for effective anti-cancer compounds. </p...|$|R
40|$|Rapid {{redistribution}} of <b>STAT</b> subcellular localization {{is an essential}} feature of cytokine signaling. To elucidate the molecular basis of <b>STAT</b> 3 function, which plays {{a critical role in}} controlling innate immune responses in vivo, we initiated studies to determine the mechanisms controlling <b>STAT</b> 3 nuclear trafficking. We found that <b>STAT</b> 3 is transported to the nucleus in the absence of cytokine treatment, as judged by indirect immunofluorescence studies in the presence of leptomycin B, an inhibitor of CRM 1 -dependent nuclear export, suggesting that the non-phosphorylated <b>STAT</b> 3 protein contains a functional nuclear import signal. An isoform lacking the <b>STAT</b> 3 N-terminal domain (Δ 133 <b>STAT</b> 3) retains the ability to undergo constitutive nuclear localization, indicating that this region is not essential for cytokine-independent nuclear import. Δ 133 <b>STAT</b> 3 is also transported to the nucleus following stimulation with interleukin- 6 (IL- 6). Interestingly, IL- 6 -dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of Δ 133 <b>STAT</b> 3 appears to be prolonged and the nuclear export of the protein delayed in cells expressing endogenous <b>STAT</b> 3, consistent with defective Δ 133 <b>STAT</b> 3 dephosphorylation. Endogenous <b>STAT</b> 3 does not promote the nuclear export of Δ 133 <b>STAT</b> 3, although dimerization between endogenous <b>Stat</b> 3 and Δ 133 <b>STAT</b> 3 is detected readily. Thus, the <b>STAT</b> 3 N-terminal domain is not required for dimerization with full-length <b>STAT</b> 3, yet appears {{to play a role in}} proper export of <b>Stat</b> 3 from the nucleus following cytokine stimulation. <b>STAT</b> 3 -deficient cells reconstituted with Δ 133 <b>STAT</b> 3 show enhanced and prolonged <b>Stat</b> 1 signaling in response to IL- 6, suggesting that induction of the <b>STAT</b> 3 -dependent negative regulator SOCS 3 is impaired. In fact, Δ 133 <b>STAT</b> 3 fails to induce SOCS 3 mRNA efficiently. These studies collectively indicate that the <b>STAT</b> 3 N-terminal region may be important for IL- 6 -dependent target gene activation and nuclear dephosphorylation, while dispensable for nuclear import. <b>STAT</b> 3 is an oncogene. <b>STAT</b> 3 is constitutively activated in primary tumors of many types. Thus far, research in the design of <b>STAT</b> 3 protein inhibitors has focused on the SH 2 and DNA-binding domains of <b>STAT</b> 3. Interference with these domains eliminates all signaling through <b>STAT</b> 3. If the N-terminal domain is involved in tetramerization on a subset of target genes, inhibition of this region may lead to a more selective inhibition of some <b>STAT</b> 3 functions while leaving others intact. ...|$|R
40|$|Signal {{transducer}} and activator of transcription (<b>Stat)</b> 4 is a signaling molecule {{required for}} normal responses to interleukin- 12 (IL- 12) and is critically involved in inflammatory responses. We have isolated an alternatively spliced isoform of <b>Stat</b> 4, termed <b>Stat</b> 4 β, which lacks 44 amino acids at the C-terminus, encompassing the putative transcriptional activation domain. To assess the in vivo roles of these <b>Stat</b> 4 isoforms, we generated transgenic <b>Stat</b> 4 -deficient mice expressing <b>Stat</b> 4 α or <b>Stat</b> 4 β. Our {{results indicate that}} T-cell-specific expression of <b>Stat</b> 4 α or <b>Stat</b> 4 β can mediate many aspects of IL- 12 signaling including the differentiation of Th 1 cells. However, <b>Stat</b> 4 α is required for normal levels of IL- 12 -induced interferon-γ production from Th 1 cells. Microarray analysis identified 98 genes induced by both <b>Stat</b> 4 isoforms, 32 genes induced only by <b>Stat</b> 4 α and 29 genes induced only by <b>Stat</b> 4 β. Some induced genes correlate with specific functions including the ability of <b>Stat</b> 4 β, but not <b>Stat</b> 4 α, to mediate IL- 12 -stimulated proliferation.

By electrophoretic mobility shift assay studies using nuclear extracts of UT 7 cells stimulated with erythropoietin, we showed that these four sequences bound to <b>STAT</b> 5 -containing complexes that exhibited different patterns and affinities: the three upstream <b>STAT</b> binding sequences bound to two distinct <b>STAT</b> 5 -containing complexes (C 0 and C 1) and the downstream <b>STAT</b> box bound only to the slower-migrating C 1 band. Using nuclear extracts from COS- 7 cells transfected with expression vectors for the prolactin receptor, <b>STAT</b> 5 A, and/or <b>STAT</b> 5 B, we showed that the C 1 complex was composed of a <b>STAT</b> 5 tetramer and was dependent {{on the presence of}} <b>STAT</b> 5 A. <b>STAT</b> 5 B lacked this property and bound with a stronger affinity than did <b>STAT</b> 5 A to the four <b>STAT</b> sequences as a homodimer (C 0 complex). This distinct biochemical difference between <b>STAT</b> 5 A and <b>STAT</b> 5 B was confirmed with purified activated <b>STAT</b> 5 recombinant proteins. Moreover, we showed that th...|$|R
40|$|<b>STAT</b> 2 is {{the quintessential}} {{transcription}} factor for type 1 interferons (IFNs), where it {{functions as a}} heterodimer with <b>STAT</b> 1. However, the human and murine <b>STAT</b> 2 -deficient phenotypes suggest important additional and currently unidentified type 1 IFN-independent activities. Here we show that <b>STAT</b> 2 constitutively bound to <b>STAT</b> 1, but not <b>STAT</b> 3, via a conserved interface. While this interaction was irrelevant for type 1 interferon signaling and <b>STAT</b> 1 activation, it precluded the nuclear translocation specifically of <b>STAT</b> 1 in response to IFN-γ, interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) and IL- 27. This is explained by the dimerization between activated <b>STAT</b> 1 and unphosphorylated <b>STAT</b> 2, whereby the semiphosphorylated dimers adopted a conformation incapable of importin-α binding. This, in turn, substantially attenuated cardinal IFN-γ responses including MHC expression, senescence, and antiparasitic immunity, and shifted the transcriptional output of IL- 27 from <b>STAT</b> 1 to <b>STAT</b> 3. Our results uncover <b>STAT</b> 2 as a pervasive cytokine regulator due to its inhibition of <b>STAT</b> 1 in multiple signaling pathways and provide {{an understanding of the}} type 1 interferon independent activities of this protein...|$|R
40|$|The {{signalling}} pathway of Janus tyrosine Kinases-Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription (JAKSTAT) {{is activated}} {{by a number}} of cytokines, hormones (GH, erythropoietin and prolactin), and growth factors. JAK-STAT signalling is involved in regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. These activities are due to different members of JAK-STAT family consisting of: JAK 1, JAK 2, JAK 3, Tyk 2 and <b>STAT</b> 1, <b>STAT</b> 2, <b>STAT</b> 3, <b>STAT</b> 4, <b>STAT</b> 5 a, <b>STAT</b> 5 b, <b>STAT</b> 6. Recent studies suggest a key role for <b>STAT</b> family proteins, in particular for <b>STAT</b> 3, in selectively inducing and maintaining a pro-carcinogenic inflammatory microenvironment, that promote tumour cells transformation. Moreover, a striking correlation between cancer development/progression and <b>STAT</b> 3 persistent activation exists, probably due to <b>STAT</b> 3 promoting of the pro-oncogenic inflammatory pathways, like NF-kB, IL- 6 and JAK family kinases. Recent study demonstrated that carbazoles can inhibit <b>STAT</b> 3 mediated transcription. From these evidences, <b>STAT</b> 3 represents a therapeutic target, so we have synthesized a new set of N-alkylcarbazole derivatives substituted in positions 2, 4 and 6, to evaluate their activity on <b>STAT</b> 3. Some of these compounds showed an interesting activity as <b>STAT</b> 3 selective inhibitors; in particular, compounds 9 a 9 b and 9 c revealed to inhibit the <b>STAT</b> 3 activation for the 50...|$|R
