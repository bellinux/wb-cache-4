It then explores the past and existing legal obstacles to the judicial resolution of the indigenous peoples 2 ̆ 7 claims and concludes with the proposition that unless the federal government intervenes to create new sovereign territory in substitution of aboriginal lands, specific relief is compelled.

40|$|Despite the {{continued}} production and overdependence of maize and wheat (traditional crops) as {{main source of}} income in Uasin-Gishu County, poverty among farmers has been increasing. To mitigate the poverty effects, farmers have tended to <b>substitute</b> <b>land</b> under the traditional crops for high yielding and high value crops, passion fruit inclusive. However, the uptake of passion fruit has been achieved with partial success. This study determined the extent of passion fruit adoption, factors affecting the adoption and its extent. Cross-sectional data from 100 randomly selected farmers were collected and subjected to Heckman two-step regression analysis to determine factors affecting passion fruit adoption {{as well as the}} extent of adoption. The results show that availability of water for irrigation (marginal effect = 0. 481), title deeds (marginal effect = 0. 316) and farming as main occupation (marginal effect = 0. 486) significantly and positively affected the adoption of passion fruit while age (marginal effect = 0. 009) was significant with negative effect. Private land ownership and access to extension services significantly and positively influenced the extent of adoption while age had significant negative effect. The results mean more incentives and innovative drivers are necessary for crop diversification and substitution in Kenya and not sufficient for adoption of the new crops.

40|$|The article analyses, on {{the basis}} of mass {{statistics}} data gathered by Chief Statistical Office, the changes in resources and relations of production factors in family farms in years 1961 - 1987 together with their productivity and the level of outlay on agricultural production. Besides, the above questions have been analysed with respect to area groups of farms from two extremely different regions. The analysis shews that productivity in family farms depends on the level and relations of production factors. The productivity is influenced mostly by the improvement of turnover means-land and durable goods-land relations, while the efficiency of labour is influenced mostly by the improvement of land-labour and durable goods-labour relations. The productivity of these two production factors in family farms in years 1961 - 1987 showed upward tendencies in consequence of a decrease in acreage of land and labour resources in those farms as well as in consequence of providing more means of production for agriculture. The latter increase was, however, insufficient and, as a result, the efficiency of total outlay on a unit of production depended mostly on land-labour relation, what manifested itself by a considerable participation of labour outlay in the overall structure of outlay. At the same time, as the acreage of farms grew, and in subsequent years, the participation of labour and land in the structure of outlay decreased while the turnover and durable goods outlays increased. Simultaneously, an increase in technical equipment of labour and a decrease in the level of outlay on production could be observed. Providing more means of production for family farms made it possible to <b>substitute</b> <b>land</b> and labour and increase the scale of agricultural output. However, it also brought a decrease in efficiency of utilization of those means, yet slower than a corresponding growth of productivity of labour and land.

The focus of the paper is to evaluate the sensitivity of the land use changes to different assumptions on the blending mix between ethanol and biodiesel for meeting the 5 % blending target of first generation biofuels, on the intensification level of agricultural production and on the available agricultural land.

40|$|Abstract: The {{abundance}} of water {{has certainly been}} a very important resource {{for the development of}} the Po Valley and has necessitated, more than once, interventions of regulation and drainage that have contributed strongly to imprint a particular conformation on the land. Already in Roman times there were numerous projects of canalisation and intense and diligent commitment to the maintenance of the canals, used for navigation, for irrigation and for the working of the mills. The need to control the excessive amount of water present was the beginning of the exploitation of this great font of rich-ness that was constantly maintained in subsequent eras. In the early Middle Ages, despite the condi-tions of political instability and great economic and social difficulty, the function of the canals con-tinued to be of great importance, also because the paths of river communication often <b>substituted</b> <b>land</b> roads, then left abandoned. After the 11 th century A. D. the resumption of agricultural activity was conducive to the intense task of land reclamation of the Lombardian countryside and of commitment by the cities to amplify their waterways with the construction of new canals and the improvement of those already existing. The example given by Milan, a city lacking a natural river, that equipped itself with a dense network of canal, used in various ambits of the city life (defence, hygiene, agriculture, transport, milling systems) and for connections with the surrounding territory, can be considered as emblematic. In the surrounding countryside, the activity of the Cistercian monks of Chiaravalle repre-sents one of the situations more indicative of how land reclamation and waterways contributed fun-damentally to the organisation of the territory over the span of the ages...|$|R

40|$|Abstract This study empirically investigates farmers’ {{decision-making}} on {{agricultural land}} use change in the Netherlands. Five driving factors influencing decision making on both on-farm land adjustments and changes {{to the size of}} the farm are selected: increased price volatility, milk quota, land prices, direct payments and insurance possibilities. By analysing the influence of increased output price volatility and risk on land use change, it is first shown that opposite effects between complementing and <b>substituting</b> <b>land</b> uses are present, leading to competition within the dairy sector and within crop production. Second, by employing a duration model over the period before, during and towards milk quota abolition, it is empirically shown that quota hamper the pace of change in land used for milk production on dairy farms. Third, the price of agricultural land is analysed by taking into account four categories that all influence the price of land: the direct influence via the returns from land, institutional regulations, the spatial environment and local market conditions. It is shown that the financial crisis leads to a decline in the effects of local market conditions, but the announcement of milk quota abolition in 2008 has led to an increase in the effects of the spatial environment. The last two driving factors analyse policy measures using a mathematical programming model. Fourth, it is found that the 2013 Common Agricultural Policy reforms will cause farmers to shift away from crops previously eligible for payments, with the initial shift of the direct payment reform enhanced by the move towards direct payments combined with a green payment. Fifth, small changes in land allocation towards more volatile crops are observed when the possibility of whole farm and crop-specific insurance is offered. In general it is found that when production risk is decreased, this opens the possibility to increase risk in other areas, such as farm expansion. When the total amount of farmland is treated as variable, changes to land cannot be explained by changes in revenues and risk alone. Land use change is now also influenced by long-term decision making based on expectations on future costs and revenues, and other factors such as farm characteristics, institutional and transaction characteristics and the influence of location and economic conjecture...|$|R

Nevertheless, numerous efforts are being made both {{by the government and}} non-governmental organizations to mitigate the situation in rural areas notably in Nyeri district which is a relatively poor district in central province with poverty rate standing at 30 % (CBS, 2008). Nyeri district has been a target of a non-governmental organization, The International Smallgroup and Tree Planting Program (TIST). Its objective is to help locals increase their income and conserve environment by planting trees. Farmers are increasingly joining the program <b>substituting</b> <b>land</b> previously allocated for food crops with tree planting enterprise. Despite presence of TIST, poverty still remains high in the region, with the statistics showing an increase in the population living below the poverty line from 29 % in 2000 to 33 % in 2006 (CBS, 2008). The main objective {{of the study was to}} determine the effects of TIST program on household income, environmental services and to determine factors that influence participation through a survey questionnaire. Multistage sampling was applied in selection of 120 farmers and analysis was done using SPSS and STATA. Heckman two stage sample selection model was used in analyzing factors that determine participation and log-log model was used to quantify the contribution of the program to household income upon participation. Descriptive statistics were used to determine the effects of the program on environmental services. The results showed no significant difference in income between participants and nonparticipants. Other socioeconomic and farm specific factors showed significant difference in household incomes. Farm sizes, access to micro-finance and program awareness positively influenced participation and were significant at 5 % level of significance. Farm size p>(z) value was 0. 048, access to micro finance(0. 018) and program awareness(0. 029). The program had a positive effect on a variety of environmental services.

Our analysis shows that previous slippage estimates likely stem from spurious correlation. Most land retired under CRP is of lower-than-average quality. Due to the marginal economic viability of these lands they also {{are more likely to}} move both into and out of agricultural production. CRP enrollments therefore will be spatially correlated with non-cropland to cropland conversions even if no slippage is present. Using time-series rather than cross-sectional variation in CRP enrollments, we obtain new slippage estimates that control for land heterogeneity using fixed and random effects. Contrary to previous findings, we find little or no slippage in the form of new plantings of commodity crops. Moderate CRP-induced plantings take the form of new hay plantings that arise mostly from converted pastureland, but these conversions create {{little in the way of}} unintended environmental damages. Total commodity production is reduced by less than the proportion of acres idled because land retired is of lower-than-average quality and because it sometimes stood fallow or in hay before it was enrolled in CRP.

40|$|Abstract: Globally {{and in the}} United States, {{agriculture}} is the major user not only of water but also of land. This paper compares trends in aggregate and per capita water and land use by the agricultural sector in the United States and the world during the 20 th century. It finds that although cropland use per capita has been declining in both areas since the early 1900 s, agricultural water use per capita only began declining {{in the latter half}} of that century. That the increases in efficiencies of agricultural water use lagged behind the increases in the efficiency of cropland use is consistent with the fact that farmers (and farming communities) have traditionally had stronger property rights to their land than to their water. As a result, through much of the 20 th century, farmers had a greater incentive to improve the efficiency of land use than that of water use and to <b>substitute</b> water for <b>land</b> (or irrigated land for dryland) in producing crops...|$|R
40|$|Although {{directed}} to the British system of land use planning this paper has relevance for many OECD countries. The paper starts by characterising the basic features of planning systems which seek to impose 'growth boundaries' {{as has been the}} case in Britain since 1947. In contrast to the planning literature this analyses such policies as an issue of resource allocation. A conclusion is that the system explicitly excludes any use of price signals from its decisions and effectively determines the supply of land for any use by fiat. Cumulatively over time the result has been to generate major distortions in land market prices. Because the planning system has deliberately constrained the supply of space, and space is an attribute of housing which is income elastic in demand, rising incomes not only drive rising real house prices but also mean that land prices have risen considerably faster than house prices. Several housing attributes other than garden space are to a degree <b>substitutes</b> for <b>land</b> but the underlying cause of the inelastic supply of housing in the UK is the constraint on land supply. The final section proposes a way of including the information embodied in the price premiums of neighbouring parcels of land zoned for different uses in determining land supply while safeguarding the underlying purposes of land use regulation. Such premiums signal the relative scarcity of land for different uses at each location and should become a key element in planning decision-making. If they were above some threshold, this should provide a presumption of development unless maintaining the land in its current use could be shown to be in the public interest. If combined with Impact Fees, such a change would not only make housing supply more elastic and the system more transparent but would help to distance land availability decisions from the political process. ...|$|R
40|$|Although {{directed}} to the British system of Town and Country Planning this paper has relevance for many OECD countries, including some with systems of land use regulation which evolved entirely independently of the British. The paper starts by characterising the basic features of the British land use planning system, viewed from the resource allocation {{point of view of}} an economist. A conclusion is that the system explicitly excludes any use of price signals from its decisions. The paper then summarises the problems which the exclusion of price information has given rise to. Because the UK planning system has deliberately constrained the supply of space, and space is an attribute of housing which is income elastic in demand, rising incomes not only drive rising real house prices but also mean that land prices have risen considerably faster than house prices. Several housing attributes other than garden space are to a degree <b>substitutes</b> for <b>land</b> but the underlying cause of the inelastic supply of housing in the UK is the constraint on land supply. The final section proposes a mechanism which would make use of the information embodied in the price premiums of neighbouring parcels of land zoned for different uses. Such premiums signal the relative scarcity of land for different uses at each location and should become a ‘material consideration’ in planning decision- making. If they were above some threshold, this should provide a presumption of development unless maintaining the land in its current use could be shown to be in the public interest. If combined with Impact Fees, such a change would not only make housing supply more elastic and the system more transparent but would help to distance land availability decisions from the political process. regulation; zoning; land use; housing supply...|$|R
40|$|L-band passive {{measurements}} (1. 4 GHz) over continental {{areas are}} known to be related to surface soil moisture. Two satellite missions were recently launched to measure land surface emissions at this frequency band (SMOS-Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity in 2009 and SMAP-Soil Moisture Active/Passive in 2015). In order to improve soil moisture retrievals from satellite data, ground-based radiometer systems operating at the same frequency were deployed over specified areas to investigate the L-band emission of various land covers under various climatological conditions. In this study, three years of L-band passive measurements from a radiometer installed on top of a steep mountain in the French Alps were analyzed and compared to L-band passive simulations. The innovative radiometer location led to large footprints due to the distance between the radiometer and the area under study. This experiment also produced microwave measurements affected by various potential difficulties typically encountered in SMOS/SMAP satellite missions: topography, heterogeneous footprints, dry/wet snow events, dew and vegetation litter. Based on in situ and modeling data, this paper investigates the potential of a radiative transfer model (L-band Microwave Emission of the Biosphere, L-MEB) to simulate L-band measurements and analyzes the differences with ELBARA observations. First, {{it was found that the}} topography generated a mixing of the horizontal and vertical polarizations. In addition, a large positive bias was found on ELBARA measurements (31 K and 12 K in horizontal and vertical polarizations respectively). Investigations showed that the sky reflection measured by the radiometer was partially <b>substituted</b> by <b>land</b> reflection coming from the surrounding topography. Second, the low-vegetation emission was investigated and highlighted the inability of the MODIS NDVI product to correctly represent the vegetation dynamics. Finally, dry snow conditions were found to have non-negligible impact at L-band and a particular signature was found during snow melting periods, with potential applications at the SMOS/SMAP spatial scales (similar to 40 km) ...|$|R
