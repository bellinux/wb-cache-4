40|$|AbstractThe impulse and <b>self</b> <b>starting</b> {{characteristics}} of a mixed-compression hypersonic inlet designed at Mach number of 6. 5 are studied by applying the unsteady computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method. The full Navier–Stokes equations are solved with the assumption of viscous perfect gas model, and the shear-stress transport (SST) k–ω two-equation Reynolds averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) model is used for turbulence modeling. Results indicate that during impulse starting, the flow field {{is divided into three}} zones with different aerodynamic parameters by primary shock and upstream-facing shock. The separation bubble on the shoulder of ramp undergoes a generating, growing, swallowing and disappearing process in sequence. But a separation bubble at the entrance of inlet exists until the freestream velocity is accelerated to the starting Mach number during <b>self</b> <b>starting.</b> The mass flux distribution of flow field is non-uniform because of the interaction between shock and boundary layer, so that the mass flow rate at throat is unsteady during impulse starting. The duration of impulse starting process increases almost linearly with the decrease of freestream Mach number but rises abruptly when the freestream Mach number approaches the starting Mach number. The accelerating performance of booster almost has no influence on the <b>self</b> <b>starting</b> ability of hypersonic inlet...|$|E

Results show that increased transonic to cruise corrected air flow ratio gives decreased range for missions dominated by supersonic cruise. It is also found important that inlets be designed to minimize spillage drag at subsonic cruise, {{because of the need}} for efficient performance for overland operations. The external compression inlet emerged as the probable first choice at Mach 2. 0, while the <b>self</b> <b>starting</b> inlet was the probable first choice at Mach 2. 3.

The model was created with airfoil modified from conventional NACA 0018 to be flexible at 15 ° from the main blade axis at the trailing edge located about 70 % of the blade chord length. Unsteady numerical simulations of the model were then conducted at low tip speed ratios, 0. 1, 0. 25, 0. 75 and 1.
