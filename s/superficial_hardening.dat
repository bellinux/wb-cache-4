30|$|Probably, the {{heat-resistant}} {{crust of}} these semiliquid foam pieces consists of dioxide, nitride and oxinitride of silicon. The slowed diffusion of oxygen into hot {{pieces of the}} silica-silicon foam through this superficial gradually hardening dioxide-oxynitride film guarantees the substantial lifetime of this ball-lightning-like phenomenon. Pieces of gradually oxidable semiliquid foam are slightly similar to the soap froth in your bath, but their <b>superficial</b> <b>hardening</b> film and extremely high temperature easily guarantee an opportunity for their elastic bouncing on a cold firm surface.|$|E

40|$|One of {{research}} methods in metal cutting {{process is to}} measure hardness in the contact zone between cutting tool and workpiece. The objective of the performed research was to determine thickness and hardness of the superficial layer of cut surface due to cutting process, both orthogonal and complex cutting. The most important finding was that thickness of the <b>superficial</b> <b>hardened</b> layer is very thin under considered conditions, less than 0. 01 … 0. 02 mm. This research should be continued...|$|R
2500|$|In {{contrast}} to nails, claws are typically curved ventrally (downwards in animals) and compressed sideways. They serve {{a multitude of}} functionsincluding climbing, digging, and fightingand have undergone numerous adaptive changes in different animal taxa. Claws are pointed at their ends and are composed of two layers: a thick, deep layer and a <b>superficial,</b> <b>hardened</b> layer which serves a protective function. The underlying bone is a virtual mold of the overlying horny structure and therefore has the same shape as the claw or nail. Compared to claws, nails are flat, less curved, and do not extend far beyond {{the tip of the}} digits. The ends of the nails usually consist only of the [...] "superficial", hardened layer and are not pointed like claws.|$|R
40|$|Super {{austenitic}} stainless steels are denominated as such because they present good resistance to pitting corrosion and, also, offer excellent mechanical properties, which makes them one of the options {{for the production of}} components used by the petroleum industry. However the <b>superficial</b> foundry <b>hardening</b> during the machining processes can change these properties. This paper aimed at investigating the effects of the machining operation {{on the surface of the}} super, austenitic steel ASTM A 351 CN 3 MN. Samples of the casted steel suffered wear due to cylindrical machining, with different cutting speeds, using indexable carbide inserts of varied geometries. The analysis of the microstructure on the casting surface was accomplished by optical microscopy and the foundry hardened surface was determined by micro-hardness. The mechanical properties of the steel were determined by traction assay. The wear in the cutting inserts was accomplished in a MEV...|$|R

40|$|The {{investigation}} {{of the dynamics of}} acetone effects induced to the superficial layer of acrylic teeth with time domain C Scan OCT is the main reason of this study. Acetone is one of the organic solvents used in order to improve the adhesion of acrylic teeth to denture base resin. The ridge lap area of 20 acrylic second upper molars was milled to flat. Afterwards the molars with the milled ridge lap area were cut in two halves. The artificial teeth were randomly assigned in 2 groups. : Group 1. (control) (without treatment), Group 2. Acetone treatment. The both sample groups were submitted to OCT C Scan (En Face) investigation for 200 seconds. The dynamical changes, induced to the superficial layer of acrylic teeth by acetone, among which the <b>superficial</b> layer <b>hardening,</b> were captured with C Scan OCT, proving the fact that time domain C scan OCT could be used in order to investigate the dynamics of the effects of this organic solvent to the polymeric acrylic teeth substrate...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This study {{examined}} the performance of abrasive jet polishing (AJP) on SKD 61 mold surfaces using wax-coated SiC abrasives fabricated by gas atomization and the comparison of surface quality achieved by revealing significant surface roughness reduced with wax-coated abrasives. The wax coating of SiC abrasives smooth the sharp surfaces of abrasive powders and provides a cushioning buffer. These two features contribute and improve the direct impact of heavy peening, thus preventing surface <b>hardening,</b> <b>superficial</b> embedment or deep scratches. Furthermore, compound additives including water wax and water {{were added to the}} wax-coated # 3000 SiC abrasives at a mix proportion of 500 : 1000 : 1500 (water wax: wax-coated SiC: water) for polishing micro-channels surfaces. The experimental results show that the compound additives provide addition cushioning effect facilitate the sliding and grinding of abrasives, resulting in fine polishing and good surface quality. The reflection properties of both linear and curved micro-channels were much enhanced by AJP using wax-coated # 3000 SiC abrasives with the compound additives...|$|R
