25|$|Weil made {{substantial}} {{contributions in}} a number of areas, the most important being his discovery of profound connections between algebraic geometry and number theory. This began in his doctoral work leading to the Mordell–Weil theorem (1928, and shortly applied in Siegel's theorem on integral points). Mordell's theorem had an ad hoc proof; Weil began the separation of the infinite descent argument into two types of <b>structural</b> <b>approach,</b> by means of height functions for sizing rational points, and by means of Galois cohomology, which would not be categorized as such for another two decades. Both aspects of Weil's work have steadily developed into substantial theories.|$|E
25|$|Early in the 20th century, Saussure {{introduced}} {{the idea of}} language as a static system of interconnected units, defined through the oppositions between them. By introducing a distinction between diachronic and synchronic analyses of language, he laid {{the foundation of the}} modern discipline of linguistics. Saussure also introduced several basic dimensions of linguistic analysis that are still foundational in many contemporary linguistic theories, such as the distinctions between syntagm and paradigm, and the langue- parole distinction, distinguishing language as an abstract system (langue) from language as a concrete manifestation of this system (parole). Substantial additional contributions following Saussure's definition of a <b>structural</b> <b>approach</b> to language came from The Prague school, Leonard Bloomfield, Charles F. Hockett, Louis Hjelmslev, Émile Benveniste and Roman Jakobson.|$|E

Progress {{in the use of}} <b>structural</b> <b>approaches</b> has been limited for several reasons: absence of a clear defi nition; lack of operational guidance; and limited data on the eff ectiveness of <b>structural</b> <b>approaches</b> to the reduction of HIV incidence. In this paper we build on evidence and experience to address these gaps.

2500|$|This {{first version}} of the method was {{originally}} called the oral method, the aural-oral method or the <b>structural</b> <b>approach.</b> The audio-lingual method truly {{began to take shape}} {{near the end of the}} 1950s, this time due government pressure resulting from the space race. [...] Courses and techniques were redesigned to add insights from behaviorist psychology to the structural linguistics and constructive analysis already being used. Under this method, students listen to or view recordings of language models acting in situations. Students practice with a variety of drills, and the instructor emphasizes the use of the target language at all times. The idea is that by reinforcing 'correct' behaviors, students will make them into habits.|$|E

50|$|The Panchronic {{program in}} {{phonology}} is a development from <b>structural</b> <b>approaches</b> to diachrony. <b>Structural</b> <b>approaches</b> to diachrony study {{the way in}} which phonological systems respond to the causes of change. A major source of change is the constant competition between the tendency towards phonological integration and the tendency towards phonetic simplicity. Phonological economy tends to fill structural gaps in phonological systems, and phonetic economy tends to create phonological gaps. Out of the pool of potential changes, the actual direction of evolution observed in a given language depends in part on the state of its phonological system, e.g. - again taking nasality as an example - which nasal phonemes it possesses (among consonants and vowels), which phonotactic constraints they are subject to, and what functional load they have in the system.|$|R
