Steady overvoltages can also arise when loads served by networks are reduced, and the problem can be exacerbated if lines supplying load centres are long. This paper reports on a study that was conducted {{to assess the impact}} of derating voltage of lines, by using <b>step</b> <b>down</b> <b>transformers</b> on the lowest load a network can accommodate without overvoltages. A program written in Python and using PSS/E to perform loadflows, was used to perform analyses at various load levels.

In 1888 Westinghouse also licensed Nikola Tesla's induction motor patent giving AC a much needed usable motor. This system was developed into the modern 3-phase system by Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky and Allgemeine Elektricitäts-Gesellschaft and Charles Eugene Lancelot Brown in Europe, starting in 1889. The simplicity of polyphase generators and motors meant that besides their efficiency they could be manufactured cheaply, compactly and would require little attention to maintain. Simple economics would drive the expensive, balky and mechanically complex DC dynamos to their ultimate extinction. As it turned out, the deciding factor in the War of Currents was the availability of low cost step up and <b>step</b> <b>down</b> <b>transformers</b> that meant that all customers regardless of their specialized voltage requirements could be served at minimal cost of conversion.

50|$|Since {{the advent}} of {{high-power}} semiconductors such as the {{insulated gate bipolar transistor}} (IGBT), it is now possible to build a switched-mode power supply capable of coping with the high loads of arc welding. These designs are known as inverter welding units.

The switching frequency is typically 10 kHz or higher. Although the high switching frequency requires sophisticated components and circuits, it drastically reduces the bulk of the <b>step</b> <b>down</b> <b>transformer,</b> as the mass of magnetic components (transformers and inductors) that is required for achieving a given power level goes down rapidly as the operating (switching) frequency is increased.

Three-wire single-phase systems, with a single center-tapped transformer giving two live conductors, is a common distribution scheme for residential and small commercial buildings in North America. This arrangement is sometimes incorrectly referred to as [...] "two phase". A similar method is used for a different reason on construction sites in the UK.

40|$|Due to {{an urgent}} need for an {{international}} protocol for power protection and substation automation, the International Electrotechnical Committee (IEC) and Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) agreed to collaborate together to advance the existing communication protocols for substation automation system (SAS). The objectives were to achieve interoperability and free configuration in a multi-vendor environment substation. The outcome of this agreement was to announce {{the first edition of}} the IEC 61850 Standard as an international standard in 2004. The standard incorporates the use of logical nodes to resolve problems related to interoperability and interchangeability in multi-vendor zone substation systems. The standard also initiated a cost-effective Generic Object Oriented Substation Event (GOOSE) messaging technology to replace the traditional copper wiring. The second edition of the IEC 61850 Standard was published in 2014 which is encapsulated in a series of 20 documents spanning over ten sections. The last few years has seen numerous studies pointing to the IEC 61850 as a worthwhile international standard for substation automation system. There is still, nevertheless, resistance from utilities to welcoming the IEC 61850 implementation. This may perhaps be {{due to the lack of}} knowledge that engineers have about the standard and/or because of several ambiguous topics that still are not addressed in detail in the context of IEC 61850. Furthermore, it should go without saying that, the GOOSE technology has brought several benefits to the power protection and communication systems in the field of substation automation. However, the lack of tools and knowledge to take advantage of the GOOSE messaging technology in IEC 61850 -based zone substations is tangible. For instance, in order to test an Intelligent Electronic Device (IED), isolating a GOOSE message from substation is a main industrial challenge for engineers. When an IED is isolated from live substation for test purposes, its GOOSE message is not isolated yet, and the IED under test is still publishing the GOOSE trip signal to other IEDs. In order to isolate the GOOSE trip signal for IED test purposes, each vendor implements its own method and they use their proprietary configurator tools. This means that, engineers are desperately dealing with a lack of comprehensive tool or method to isolate the GOOSE trip signal in a multi-vendor zone substation. These challenges led to the slow migration of the standard into substations. Having acknowledged these difficulties and challenges the spotlight is seemingly in the path of developing a tool or program to be utilised for GOOSE isolation and GOOSE management in a multi-vendor relay environment. In doing that, a 66 / 22 kV Distribution Terminal Zone Substation is implemented accompanied with a SCADA centre as a model of an IEC 61850 -based Substation. Two bays with separate 66 kV sub-transmission lines, 66 / 22 kV <b>step</b> <b>down</b> <b>transformers,</b> 22 kV Bus 1 with Bus Tie Circuit Breaker and three 22 kV feeders per bay have been considered for the simulation. In the construction of the Substation Simulator, the aim is to take advantage of the IEC 61850 GOOSE messaging technology for protection, control, monitoring and communication purposes. Hence, the hardwire connections are replaced by GOOSE signals through optic cables as much as possible. This thesis will not only provide the design and configuration procedures of this substation, but also will cover the difficulties that engineers may encounter in IEC 61850 -based substations systems in terms of device configuration, testing and maintenance. In order to fully understand the concept of the 66 / 22 kV Distribution Terminal Zone Substation, it is very essential to be familiar with the structure of communication protocols and the IEC 61850 Standard. This thesis starts by exploring a synopsis of communication protocols and their development over the time. It elucidates core elements of telemetry communications, structures of protocols and the significance of standards for communication protocols within substation automation systems. This is followed by a comprehensive exploration of the fundamentals of the IEC 61850 -based substations.
