In the next step of the reaction the electrophilic carbon atom attacks the ring primarily at the ortho position, thus forming two new intermediates.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the syntheses of a range of polyfluorinated biphenyl ether derivatives for use as dopants in commercial LC materials, so that overall display performance may be improved. Reactions of hexa– and penta–fluorobenzene with <b>sodium</b> <b>phenoxide</b> in polar aprotic solvents (MeCN, THF) and under mild reaction conditions (45 – 50 °C, 4 – 65 h) afford moderate yields of pentafluorophenoxybenzene and 1, 2, 4, 5 –tetrafluoro– 3 –phenoxybenzene, respectively. SNAr reactions of <b>sodium</b> <b>phenoxide</b> with less electrophilic 1, 2, 3, 4 –tetra– and 1, 2, 3, 5 –tetra–fluorobenzene under microwave irradiation (150 °C, 30 mins) furnish good yields of 1, 2, 4 –trifluoro– 3 –phenoxybenzene and 1, 2, 5 –trifluoro– 3 –phenoxybenzene, respectively. Similar SNAr methodology is used to access a series of 1, 2, 4, 5 –tetra– and 1, 2, 4 –tri–fluoro– 3 –(4 –n–alkylphenoxy) benzene derivatives in good yield. A two–step SNAr–hydrodebromination procedure to access trifluorophenoxybenzene systems from highly electrophilic dibromotetrafluorobenzene derivatives is also developed, and provides a practical synthetic route to 1, 2, 4 –trifluoro– 5 –phenoxybenzene. Finally, a three–step SNAr–diazotisation–reductive diazotisation pathway is developed for the syntheses of difluorophenoxybenzene derivatives, which are not accessible by direct SNAr reactions of <b>sodium</b> <b>phenoxide</b> with corresponding trifluorobenzene derivatives. The use of these polyfluorinated biphenyl ether systems as dopants for LC materials is assessed by a range of electro–optical measurements. Highly fluorinated nitrobenzene systems are compatible substrates for palladium–catalysed Suzuki–Miyaura and Heck–type cross–coupling reactions involving C–F bond activation. Cross–coupling reactions of pentafluoronitrobenzene with a range of boronic acids and protected ester equivalents bearing electron–withdrawing or electron–donating substituents in the meta– and para– positions, with respect to the C–B bond, are described. For example, Reaction of pentafluoronitrobenzene with 5, 5 –dimethyl– 2 –phenyl– 1, 3, 2 –dioxaborinane in the presence of catalytic quantities of Pd(PPh 3) 4 and using KF/alumina as the preferred base (DMF, 150 °C, 15 mins, μW) affords 2, 3, 4, 5 –tetrafluoro– 6 –nitrobiphenyl in good yield (80 %). The nitro group is crucial {{to the success of the}} cross–coupling processes and is believed to facilitate the oxidative addition step by directing the palladium catalyst into the adjacent C–F bond by a predominantly SNAr–type mechanism.

40|$|The {{kinetics}} of phase-transfer catalyzed etherification of <b>sodium</b> <b>phenoxide</b> with ethyl 2 -bromoisobutyrate {{to produce}} ethyl 2 -phenoxyisobutyrate in a solid-liquid {{system has been}} investigated. Being catalyzed by the quaternary 'onium salts, the reaction {{was carried out in}} a stirred batch reactor to explore the effects of various operating variables. At a temperature of 80 degrees C and a molar ratio of tetra-n-butylammonium bromide to <b>sodium</b> <b>phenoxide</b> equal to 0. 372, 94 % conversion was obtained after 4 h, and no other side products were observed. A kinetic model of pseudo-first-order reaction accompanied by catalyst deactivation was proposed to describe the overall reaction. A deactivation function was employed to evaluate the kinetic parameters. The decay of catalytic activity was mainly caused by the deposition of the salts produced on the surface of solid particles. The results show that the initial reaction rate was not influenced by the agitation rate when exceeding 350 rpm, but the deactivation rate increased with increasing stirring speed and the amount of catalyst used. The intrinsic organic reaction was conducted by the phase-transfer catalytic intermediate. The order of reactivity for different phase-transfer catalysts was determined as tetra-n-butylphosphonium bromide > tetra-lr-butylammonium bromide > tetra-n-butylammonium iodide approximate to tetra-n-butylammonium hydrogen sulfate approximate to Aliquat 336. The apparent activation energy for tetra-n-butylammonium bromide was estimated as 51. 4 kJ mol(- 1).

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study is}} to apply triphase catalytic technique to catalyze allylation of <b>sodium</b> <b>phenoxide</b> with allyl bromide for synthesizing ally phenyl ether by conducting nucleophilic substitutions in the organic solution in solid-liquid-liquid system. The product allyl phenyl ether is used in the production of insecticides, herbicides, delation agent of coronary artery, dropping agent of blood pressure, tranquilizer and thermoplastic resins. Macroporous and microporous polymer supports were prepared for the immobilization of different active functional groups. The triphase reaction was carried out in a stirred batch reactor under mild operating conditions. A kinetic model was also proposed to describe allylation in the solid-liquid-liquid triphase system and the experimental data were well described by the pseudo-first-order kinetics. For the experimental data shown, when the agitaton speed exceeds 350 rpm, the external mass transfer resistance can be ignored. The overall reaction rates decrease with increasing the mean particle size. This demonstrates that the allylation of <b>sodium</b> <b>phenoxide</b> is controlled by the combination of intraparticle diffusion and intrinsic reaction under triphase conditions. Moreover, the characteristics and structure of the catalyst support also affect the catalytic efficiency. With the same degree of crosslinking, macroporous catalysts have higher activities than microporous catalysts do. The reactivity of the recovered catalyst only loses less than 5 % of that of fresh catalyst after 5 times of recovery. This result indicates that the stability of the catalyst prepared in the present study is good {{to be used in the}} allylation of <b>sodium</b> <b>phenoxide.</b> Other factors influencing the performance of the supported catalyst were also studied. The ion-exchange reaction is one of the fundamental processes of S-L-L triphase reactions. In this work, we also proceed the ion-exchange reaction by triphase catalysts for <b>sodium</b> <b>phenoxide</b> solution. The kinetics for the ion-exchange reaction between triphase catalysts and imbibed organic solvent/water solution have been studied to understand triphase reaction mechanism in more detail. The kinetics model proposed can be applied to describe the experimental data of the ion-exchange process successfully. Under the intraparticle diffusion-controlled kinetics, three variables including concentration of the solution, reaction temperature and types of organic solvents have been identified important to affect the ion-exchange rate. 本研究主要探討以三相觸媒催化酚鈉鹽之丙烯化反應去合成丙烯基苯基醚。產物丙烯基苯基醚是一種用途非常廣泛的中間原料，由此化合物可合成殺蟲劑、除草劑等農藥化學品；冠狀動脈擴張劑、血壓下降劑、中樞神經鎮靜劑等醫藥化學品，以及高經濟價值的熱固性高分子樹脂等。而後，製備巨孔與微孔高分子擔體，進行不同活性官能基之觸媒固定化實驗，三相反應以一溫和操作條件在批式攪拌反應器中進行。提出一反應機構來描述固-液-液三相系統之醚化反應，且利用產率之虛擬一階方程式可以完整、清楚地解釋實驗結果。實驗結果：當攪拌速率超過 350 rpm 時，其外部質傳阻力可忽略不計。總反應速率隨平均粒徑的增加而降低，這顯示在三相反應系統下，酚鈉鹽之醚化反應同時受粒內擴散與本質反應之影響。然而，觸媒的特性與結構也影響著觸媒反應活性，相同交聯度下，巨孔隙觸媒活性較微孔隙觸媒活性佳。由觸媒回收反應性來看，結果顯示反應性依回收的次數依次緩慢降低，但差距並不是很大，約在 5 %左右，為頗佳之觸媒穩定性。而其他影響固定化觸媒性能之因素也有詳細的探討。 由於，離子交換反應是重要的三相反應過程之一，故使用三相觸媒對酚鈉鹽進行離子交換反應，探討三相觸媒在水-油溶液中進行離子交換反應之動力學，來充分瞭解三相反應之機制。經由實驗數據可導出一動力式來描述此離子交換之過程。在粒內控制下，下列三種變因即溶液起始濃度、反應溫度與有機溶劑效應等，對離子交換速率均有重要之影響。中文摘 [...] - I 英文摘要 [...] III 誌謝 [...] Ⅴ 目錄 [...] VI 圖目錄 [...] -VIII 表目錄 [...] XIV 符號說明 [...] XVI 第一章 緒論 1 1 - 1. 三相相間轉移催化反應簡介 [...] 1 1 - 2. 離子交換反應 [...] - 12 1 - 3. 醚化反應 [...] - 20 1 - 4. 研究目的與方法 [...] - 26 第二章 實驗藥品與設備 29 2 - 1. 實驗藥品 [...] - 29 2 - 2. 實驗裝置與儀器 [...] - 31 2 - 3. 校正曲線 [...] - 37 第三章 以高分子擔體製備三相觸媒及其特性分析 41 3 - 1. 前言 [...] - 41 3 - 2. 實驗步驟 [...] - 42 3 - 3. 實驗結果與討論 [...] - 53 3 - 4. 結論 [...] - 57 第四章 三相觸媒之離子交換反應動力學 59 4 - 1. 前言 [...] - 59 4 - 2. 實驗步驟 [...] - 60 4 - 3. 反應動力學模式 [...] - 62 4 - 4. 實驗結果與討論 [...] - 69 4 - 5. 結論 [...] - 94 第五章 三相觸媒催化酚鈉鹽之醚化反應動力學 97 5 - 1. 前言 [...] - 97 5 - 2. 實驗步驟 [...] - 99 5 - 3. 反應動力學模式 [...] - 100 5 - 4. 實驗結果與討論 [...] - 107 5 - 5. 結論 [...] - 161 第六章 總結 [...] - 165 參考資料 [...] - 171 自述 [...] - 17...|$|E

Using tetra-n-butylammonium bromide (TBAB) as the catalyst with the molar ratio to PhONa equal to 0. 1, the product yield was above 98 % within 1 h of reaction at 10 degrees C and 150 rpm. The benzoylation was observed strongly dependent on the agitation speed, and mainly occurred in the aqueous/organic interfacial region when non-polar organic solvent was used. The catalytic intermediate, tetra-n-butylammonium phenoxide (PhOQ), produced from PhONa with TBAB in the aqueous phase was not observed in the organic phase during the reaction using heptane as the solvent; while in dichlorobenzene, its amount was about 20 - 30 % of the initial usage of catalyst. The concentrations of PhOQ for different agitation speeds are near constant after 20 min of duration; thus the pseudo-first-order kinetics can be successfully applied to describe the reaction system. Extra additions of NaOH also affected the overall reaction rate significantly due to the extraction of PhOQ into the organic phase was influeznced by hydroxide anion. The concentration of PhOQ decreased with increasing amount of NaOH at a usage of greater than 0. 025 mol.

40|$|The {{stereoselectivity}} of {{isotopic exchange}} by the diastereotopic methylene protons was examined for two ketones: (a) the conformationally rigid biarylcycloheptadienone, 16; (b) the conformationally rigid tricycloketone, Twistan- 4 -one, 17. (a) The diastereotopic alpha-keto methylene protons in 16 {{were found to}} undergo H/D exchange with a rate ratio of 63 : 1 in methanol- 0 -d with sodium methoxide as base, the proton whose C-H bond is perpendicular to {{the direction of the}} C= 0 bond exchanging fastest. The ratio decreased to 34 : 1 with <b>sodium</b> <b>phenoxide</b> base and 7 : 1 with sodium 2, 6 -dimethylphenoxide as base (both in methanol- 0 -d), showing that the more labile proton is in the more sterically hindered position. The effect of internal return was evaluated qualitatively by measuring the rate ratio for H/D exchange in the presence of crown ether. No change in stereoselectivity was observed. Also, the rate ratio for the back exchange (D/H) was measured as 12 : 1, a change consistent with the absence of internal return. Attempts to quantitatively evaluate the effect of internal return by measurement of the primary isotope effects (kH/kT and kD/kT) gave unacceptable results, probably due to the large effect of experimental errors on the calculated internal return vales. The absence of internal return was therefore assumed. However, these primary isotope effects along with the D/H exchange ratio of 12 : 1 were used to estimate the kH/kD values and solvent isotope effects at the two diastereotopic positions. It was found that the two protons exhibit different primary isotope effects (kH/k D) and different solvent isotope effects. F or the fast position, kH/kD = 3. 8, kMeOD/kMeOH = 2. 6. For the slow positions, kH/kD = 2. 3, kMeOD/kMeOH = 1. 2. These results are consistent with the two protons having different exchange mechanisms and therefore with the stereoselectivity of H/D exchange being due to the stereoelectronic control effect. The secondary isotope effect for the fast exchanging position was measured as i = 1. 18. (b) The diasteriotopic alpha-keto methylene protons in 17 were found to undergo H/D exchange with a rate ratio of 300 : 1 in methanol- 0 -d with sodium methoxide as base and 340 : 1 with <b>sodium</b> <b>phenoxide</b> as base. It was therefore concluded that the diastereotopic protons were in sterically similar environments. Assuming no internal return and the same secondary and solvent isotope effects which had been measured directly for 16, the measured rate ratio for back exchange (D/H) for 17 of 52 : 1 was used to estimate KH/kD = 5. 8 for the fast position and kH/kD = 2. 9 for the slow position. These results are again consistent with differing mechanisms for exchange at the two diastereotopic positions and therfore with stereoelectronic control as the factor responsible for the high exchange ratio for these protons...|$|E

40|$|Liquid ammonia {{is known}} to be a useful solvent for {{aromatic}} nucleophilic substitutions reactions of reactive aromatics. Most of the prior work has been carried out at atmospheric pressure and low temperatures. The purpose of this work is to extend the scope of these studies to less reactive haloaromatic substrates that require elevated temperatures to give useful reaction rates. Equipment has been developed to permit the safe study of reactions in liquid ammonia in small (5 ml) stainless steel tube reactors at temperatures up to 120 oC (90 bar). Experimental techniques have been developed to permit meaningful sampling of solutions at high temperature and pressure. Sample capture into closed systems, either into a syringe containing quench solution, or directly into a HPLC sample loop, have been used to overcome problems due to flash precipitation and aerosol formation when sampling from high pressure. Activation parameters for the solvolysis of 4 -fluoronitrobenzene (4 -FNB) have been determined over the temperature range 20 o – 120 oC, and the rates of solvolysis of 2 chloropyrimidine, 4, 6 -dichloropyrimidine and 2 -chloro- 5 -trifluoromethylpyridine have been determined at appropriate temperatures. 2 -Fluoropyridine is inert to solvolysis even at 120 oC. Rates of some nucleophilic substitutions with sodium triazolate and <b>sodium</b> <b>phenoxide</b> have been measured. Useful selectivities towards nucleophilic substitution can be obtained for the reactions examined, and further work is planned to examine the wider scope of these reactions...|$|E

The reaction performed consisted of methylation of phenol, acetylation of methyl phenyl ether, reduction of p-methoxyacetophenone, and cyclization of p-methoxy-(1 -hydroxyethyl) benzene to form C-methyl- 4, 10, 16, 22 -tetramethoxycalix[4]-arene using BF 3 -methanol as the acid catalyst.  Methylation of phenol {{was done by}} reacting phenol with solution of NaOH to generate <b>sodium</b> <b>phenoxide</b> salt. This mixture was strirred at  reflux for 0. 5 hours. Dimethyl sulphate was added and the reflux was continued for 2, 5 hours. The product obtained was methyl phenyl ether, which was found as  a colorless liquid in 99. 0 % yield. Acetylation of methyl phenyl ether {{was carried out in}} chloroform using acetic anhydride as the acetylating agent and anhydrous aluminium chloride as the catalyst. The addition of acetic anhydride and anhydrous aluminium chloride was done in two portions. The first portion was 0. 967 g of acetic anhydride and 1. 4 g of anhydrous aluminium chloride. The second portion was 0. 54 g of acetic anhydride and 0. 6 g of anhydrous aluminium chloride. The product obtained was found as a reddish yellow liquid in 69. 6 % yield. Reduction of p-methoxyacetophenone as the acetylation product  was  done using NaBH 4 in ethanol at reflux for 2. 5 hours. From this reaction, p-methoxy-(1 -hydroxyethyl) benzene was obtained as a brown viscous liquid in 44. 9 % yield. Cyclization of p-methoxy(1 -hydroxyethyl) benzene was done using BF 3 -methanol as the acid catalyst for two days at room temperature. The product obtained from this cyclization was found as a brown very viscous liquid in 87. 3 % yield. Identification of reaction products were carried out using Infra Red (IR) Spectrophotometer, Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (1 H NMR) spectrometer and Gas Chromatography-Mass spectroscopy (GC-MS).        Keywords: synthesis, calix[4]arene, cyclization, and catalyst...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{objectives}} {{of the present study}} are to apply phase-transfer catalytic technique in synthesizing benzyl phenyl ether by conducting nucleophilic substitutions in the organic solution in solid-liquid system. The operating conditions for investigation include agitation speeds、reaction temperatures、catalyst amounts、types of solvents、molar ratio of reactants、type of phase-transfer catalysts、volume ratio of aqueous and solvent and so on. The reaction mechanism and apparent reaction rate constants were obtained from the experimental results. In PEG system, polyethylene glycols are widely used as the phase-transfer catalyst and commonly applied in the chemical processes and industries. The characteristics of binding for an alkali metal ion with polyethylene glycol, enabling to transport the reactive anion from the solid into the organic phase, is applied in solid-liquid phase-transfer catalysis, and PEG is used as the phase-transfer catalyst to catalyze the etherification of <b>sodium</b> <b>phenoxide</b> with benzyl bromide in this system. The formation of the binding site by solid reactant with PEG in the organic phase to produce the intermediate complex PEG-Na+ and the effects of operating parameters on the overall reaction were investigated. The experimental results show that the dependence of amounts of catalyst on the reaction rate for different molecular weight of PEG shows that the catalytic activites of PEG- 1000 and - 1500 are similar but higher than that of PEG- 600. Effects of different organic solvents for PEG series are carried out, and above 85 % yield of benzyl Phenyl ether is easily achieved within 2 h even using heptane as the solvent. The kinetics of pseudo-first-order reaction can be applied to describe the overall reaction rate successfully. The results show that PEGs are effective catalysts for the solid-liquid phase-transfer catalysis. In TBAB system, the product selectivity and kinetics of <b>sodium</b> <b>phenoxide</b> with benzyl bromide to produce benzyl phenyl ether via solid-liquid phase-transfer catalysis were investigated. The behavior of phase-transfer catalytic intermediate in the solid-liquid system was explored. The concentraction of catalytic intermediate increased as increasing molar quantity catalyst used after induction period. When the agitation speed exceeds 300 rpm，the mass transfer resistance at the solid-liquid interface can be ignored. Different phase-transfer catalysts were employed to compare their catalytic efficiency： TBPB>TBAB>PEG 1000 >TBAHS. Moreover，the addition of water would inhibit the overall reaction rates. A kinetic model was also proposed to describe the phase-transfer catalytic alkylation. The experimental data were well described by the pseudo-first-order kinetics. The apparent activation energy was obtained 53. 66 kJ/mol and the product yield wsa achieved as above 90 % for using tetra-n-butyl-ammonium bromide as the catalyst. 摘 要 本研究主要探討固-液相之溴化苯甲基與酚鈉鹽在相間轉移觸媒催化下，合成苯甲基苯基醚之取代反應。在反應系統中，除了兩相反應物因素外，各項探討的變因包括：攪拌效應、觸媒添加量效應、水量添加效應、有機溶劑種類效應、觸媒種類效應、溫度效應等，並進一步研究反應機構及求得反應動力學速率常數。 在聚乙二醇系統中，聚乙二醇在化學製程及工業上，已十分普遍的被應用。在固-液相系統中，利用聚乙二醇的結合基會和金屬離子形成鍵結的特性，可將固相反應物由固相質傳至油相。聚乙二醇利用此一特性便可催化酚鈉鹽與溴化苯甲基進行醚化反應。反應中錯合物PEG-Na+的形成及反應的操作變數皆有探討。實驗結果顯示反應速率隨著觸媒量的增加而增加。聚乙二醇的分子量效應方面，以PEG- 1000 與PEG- 1500 的反應活性較相近而 PEG- 600 較差。在有機溶劑效應方面，PEG系列的反應過程中，低極性的正庚烷反應 2 小時後苯甲基苯基醚的產率在 85 %以上。實驗結果顯示利用聚乙二醇在適當的條件下，能夠有效的進行固-液相之間的醚化反應。 在TBAB系統中，酚鈉鹽與溴化苯甲基在固-液相系統中反應生成苯甲基苯基醚，反應過程中相間轉移觸媒(TBAB) 和酚鈉鹽形成的觸媒中間體也會被探討。實驗結果：觸媒中間體在有機相中的濃度愈高則反應速率愈快。當攪拌速率超過 300 rpm 時，固-液相界面之間的質傳阻力可以忽略不計。不同觸媒反應活性大小為TBPB>TBAB>PEG 1000 >TBAHS。水量愈多則反應速率愈慢。實驗結果可以以虛擬一階方程式完整而清楚的解釋此一系統。以溴化四丁基銨為觸媒，溶劑氯苯得到的視反應活化能為 53. 66 kJ/mol而產物產率為 90 %以上。目 錄 中文摘要 [...] Ⅰ 英文摘要 [...] Ⅲ 誌謝目錄 [...] Ⅵ 圖目錄 [...] Ⅷ 表目錄 [...] ⅩⅢ 符號說明 [...] ⅩⅣ 第一章 緒論 [...] - 1 1 - 1. 相間轉移觸媒反應簡介 [...] 1 1 - 2. 聚乙二醇簡介 [...] 7 1 - 3. 固-液相反應 [...] - 9 1 - 4. 醚化反應 [...] 12 1 - 5. 研究目的與方法 [...] 15 第二章 實驗藥品及設備 [...] 19 2 - 1. 實驗藥品 [...] - 19 2 - 2. 實驗裝置與儀器 [...] - 22 2 - 3. 校正曲線 [...] - 23 第三章 以聚乙二醇為觸媒合成苯甲基苯基醚之反應動力學 [...] 27 3 - 1. 前言 [...] - 27 3 - 2. 實驗步驟 [...] 28 3 - 3. 理論模式 [...] 29 3 - 4. 實驗結果與討論 [...] 33 3 - 5. 結論 [...] 69 第四章 四級銨鹽為觸媒催化酚鈉鹽之醚化反應動力學 [...] - 70 4 - 1. 前言 [...] 70 4 - 2. 實驗步驟 [...] 74 4 - 3. 反應動力學模式 [...] 75 4 - 4. 實驗結果與討論 [...] 79 4 - 5. 結論 [...] 115 第五章 在氰甲烷中之聚乙二醇催化酚鈉鹽醚化反應之動力學- 117 5 - 1. 前言 [...] 117 5 - 2. 實驗步驟 [...] 118 5 - 3. 反應動力學模式 [...] 119 5 - 4. 實驗結果與討論 [...] 124 5 - 5. 結論 [...] 152 第六章 總結 [...] 153 參考文獻 [...] 156 附 錄 [...] 162 1. 苯甲基苯基醚之HNMR圖譜 [...] - 16...|$|E
