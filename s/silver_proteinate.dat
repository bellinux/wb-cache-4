5000|$|Silver {{compounds}} {{have been}} used in external preparations as antiseptics, including both silver nitrate and <b>silver</b> <b>proteinate,</b> which can be used in dilute solution as eyedrops to prevent conjunctivitis in newborn babies. Silver nitrate is also sometimes used in dermatology in solid stick form as a caustic ("lunar caustic") to treat certain skin conditions, such as corns and warts. [...] Silver is also used in bone prostheses, reconstructive orthopedic surgery and cardiac devices. Silver diamine fluoride appears to be an effective intervention to reduce dental caries (tooth decay). [...] Silver acetate {{has been used as a}} potential aid to help stop smoking; a review of the literature in 2012, however, found no effect of silver acetate on smoking cessation at a six-month endpoint and if there is an effect it would be small. Silver has also been used in cosmetics, intended to enhance antimicrobial effects and the preservation of ingredients.|$|E

40|$|The {{origin and}} {{distribution}} of glycogen in inclusions of Chlamydia trachomatis were demonstrated with <b>silver</b> <b>proteinate</b> stain for electron microscopy. Glycogen particles were detected in all developmental stages of C. trachomatis, as well as free in the inclusions. Intrachlamydial glycogen was most common in elementary bodies but was also detected in intermediate forms and reticulate bodies (RBs). Abnormal divisions and breakdown of cytoplasmic membranes were common in RBs. Cytoplasmic contents, including glycogen particles, were released into the inclusions after rupture of the outer membranes of abnormal RBs and intermediate forms. From these observations, we conclude that glycogen in inclusions of C. trachomatis originates in the organisms themselves...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{starvation}} {{on the cell}} morphology of Dictyostelium discoideum were studied with different cytochemical techniques, and with a morphometric method by which the surface areas of the cell membrane and of the digestive system can be determined. During the first 2 h, the cell membrane becomes very wrinkled and many phagocytic cups and filopods are formed. These changes are {{in accord with the}} 40 % increase in the cell surface area to cytoplasmic volume ratio observed, which is mainly due to a strong decrease in the cytoplasmic volume. At this time of starvation, cells are able to ingest twice as many yeast as during growth. Afterwards, while the phagocytic ability decreases, the phagocytic cups disappear, and all the cells become bristled with many thin filopods. In spite of these morphological changes, no quantitative or topological differences have been observed concerning the polysaccharide content of the plasma membrane, whether it was stained with phosphotungstic acid, <b>silver</b> <b>proteinate,</b> or ruthenium red...|$|E
40|$|Sulfated glycoconjugates in {{epithelial}} cells and mesenchymal cells were investigated after staining with high iron diamine-thiocarbohydrazide-silver proteinate. One {{purpose of the}} experiment was to apply a new physical developer to the staining. Instead of silver nitrate, silver lactate or silver bromide, we used silver acetate as an ion donor. This new method allowed physical development under normal lighting conditions, and resulted in the reduction of background staining even after amplification. As the developer did not contain gum arabic, troublesome treatment was not necessary. The time required for staining was very short and the electron density of the final reaction product was high and easily identifiable under the electron microscope. Fixing was not necessary. Very small amounts of reactive substance were detectable after physical development. This developmental procedure {{has been applied to}} both the preembedding staining and postembedding staining of sulfated glyococonjugates. The results obtained using this method are presented.

40|$|Small {{delicate}} structures {{found in}} the leaf bases in vegetative buds of the marine angiosperm Halophila ovalis (R. Br.) Hook. f. showed a fine structure of the component cells typical of secretory cells. They are rich in organelles particularly ER, dictyosomes, ribosomes and mitochondria. Endoplasmic reticulum occurs at two localities in each cell, one surrounding the central nucleus {{and the other in}} the peripheral regions close to the plasmalemma. Groups of dictyosomes occur between the two layers of ER and each group is separated from another by interconnecting strands of ER. A mucilaginous secretion accumulates on the cell surface and between the outer and inner layers of cell wall, particularly at the corners. The involvement of ER in the secretion of mucilage is discussed. Staining of ultrathin sections with <b>silver</b> <b>proteinate</b> after thiocarbohydrazide showed the presence of insoluble carbohydrates and histochemical tests with alcian dyes showed the secretion to contain non-sulphated acid polysaccarides. Staining of epoxy resin sections with Coomassie blue R 250 indicated that the mucilage secretion on the surface of and within the cell walls also contained proteins. Cellulase–gold complex marked the cellulose wall layers as distinct from the included secretion...|$|E

40|$|Rationale: The {{problem of}} the {{resistance}} of microorganisms to many classes of antimicrobial agents becomes increasingly threatening. This promotes the search of new formulations for prevention and treatment of infectious inflammation. Aim: To evaluate antibacterial effects of silver nanoparticle colloid solutions on gram-negative, gram-positive and fungal microflora compared to already known formulations based on silver salts and nitrates of other metals. Materials and methods: The effects of silver nanoparticle colloid solutions (with concentration of nanoparticles of 50 and 100 mg/mL, particle diameter of 15 ± 5 nm) on the microorganism growth were studied in Staphylococcus aureus (#  209 P), Escherichia coli (#  26941), Klebsiella pneumoniae (#  43062) and clinical isolates of Candida albicans. For comparison, <b>silver</b> <b>proteinate,</b> nitrofural, and solutions of NaNO₃, Sn(NO₃) ₂, Co(NO₃) ₂ and Zn(NO₃) ₂ at equimolar concentrations to AgNO₃ 1 % were used. Results: After the plates with test cultures were treated with silver nanoparticle solutions and with comparator solutions, there was sheer culture growth {{in the areas of}} silver nanoparticle application (at both concentrations) and no growth in the areas of the comparator solutions application. Conclusion: The results obtained indicate that silver nanoparticle colloid solutions 50 and 100 mg/mL do not influence the growth of the studied cultures, whereas the comparator solutions exert an advanced antibacterial effect...|$|E
40|$|A <b>silver</b> <b>proteinate</b> method {{developed}} by Takamatsu ci ’ at. (1963) was employed for visual {{demonstration of the}} active sites of proteinase in the spermatozoa of nine mammalian species (golden hamster, mouse, deer mouse, rat, guinea pig, rabbit, dog, bull, and human) and one avian species (cock). Proteinase activity was demonstrated only in the acrosomal caps of all mammalian species studied. Strong proteinase activity was observed in the acro-somes of cock spermatozoa. In the golden hamster, activity was demonstrated in the acro-somes of not only mature spermatozoa, but also of immature spermatozoa as well as early spermatids. The optimum activity of the acrosomal proteinase {{in all of these}} species was generally in the acidic range. Studies using golden hamster and rabbit spermatozoa showed that pro-teinase activity was not inhibited by soybean and lima bean trypsin inhibitors, but it was drastically inhibited by tetrabutylammonium iodide, and completely inhibited by HgCl 2, KCN, KMnO 4, heparin sodium salt, phosphorylated hesperidin and a hydroquinone sul-phonic acid-formaldehyde polymer. It was inferred that the hamster and rabbit sperm acrosomal proteinase demonstrable by this technique represents a proteinase conjugated with hyaluronidase. The function of such a proteinase was judged to be depolymerization of the matrix of the cumulus oophorus in close association with the action of hyaluronidase. The acrosomes of spermatozoa of various mammalian species contain proteinases or substances with proteolytic activity (Ya...|$|E
40|$|The root {{epidermal}} bulger 1 (reb 1) mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. {{is characterized}} by a reduced elongation rate of the primary root and by the bulging of many, but not all, root epidermal cells. In this study, we investigated cell wall structure of root epidermal cells in reb 1 - 1 by using serial sectioning, and light and electron microscopy in combination with immuno-cytochemistry and polysaccharide staining. We found that: (i) Cell bulging in the mutant was initiated in the zone of elongation of the root, and occurred exclusively in trichoblasts. (ii) reb 1 - 1 and wild-type root cells stained identically with anti-pectin antibodies, such as JIM 5. In contrast, the anti-arabinogalactan-protein antibodies, JIM 14 and LM 2, stained all epidermal cells in the wild type and trichoblasts preferentially, but in reb 1 - 1 they stained the atrichoblasts only. (iii) Compared to the wild type, mutant trichoblasts had a thinner outer epidermal cell wall, which presented abnormal periodic acid-thio carbohydrazide <b>silver</b> <b>proteinate</b> (PATAg) staining. In addition, we investigated the organization of cortical microtubules in a reb 1 - 1 mutant line expressing a green-fluorescent protein fused to a microtubule-binding domain from human microtubule-associated protein 4. Microtubules in the swollen trichoblasts of reb 1 - 1 were either disordered or absent entirely. Together our findings indicate that the reb 1 - 1 mutation results in an abnormal trichoblast cell wall, and suggest that cell surface arabinogalactan-proteins are required for anisotropic expansion and for orienting cortical microtubules...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} on ciliates, flagelates and opalinates have been widespread by {{the utilization of}} techniques employing silver impregnation (Protargol), modified by several authors. However, these are time consuming and its results are variable. The present work is {{a variant of the}} technique described by Tuffrau (1964, 1967) showing some adaptations made in our laboratory. The organisms can be preserved by different fixatives (alcoholic Bouin, Stieve's fluid, 2. 5 % glutaraldehyde and others) and then rinsed in destilled water followed by a fast clarification by 3 % sodium hypochloride. If the organism is very sensitive to hypochloride, 4 % sodium lauryl sulfate may be used and then washed 3 times in distilled water. The protista can be adhered to the glass slides with Mayer's glycerinated-albumin (1 glycerin vol. to 1 or 2 albumin vol.), diluted in water at a proportion of 1 : 10 Cv/v., or with 1 % polylysine followed by fast washes with distilled water. After the slide preparation, they were covered with a layer of 0, 8 % <b>Silver</b> <b>proteinate.</b> Right after that, the slide has to be placed in a glass tray lined with moist tissue and covered to prevent the proteinate to dry. The tray was placed in a incubator at 40 º- 50 ºC for 30 minutes. The slides are rinsed for 1 minute. with warm (35 ºC) distilled water. The development of the material should be done with 0. 4 % hydroquinone with a maximum incubation time of 1 minute. It should be developed gradually, controlling the silver impregnation intensity by observation under optical microscope. Next, rinse in distilled water for 1 minute, and then, fix in 2, 5 % Sodium thiosulfate. Rinse the slide for two minutes before dehydrating it in an alcoholic serial 50 - 100 º. Finally rinse the slides in xylene. Mount the slides with Entellan MerckTM or Canada balsam...|$|E
