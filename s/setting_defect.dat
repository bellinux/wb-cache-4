40|$|Grain <b>setting</b> <b>defect</b> 1 (GSD 1), a plant-specific remorin protein {{specifically}} localized at {{the plasma}} membrane and plasmodesmata of phloem companion cells, affects grain setting in rice through regulating {{the transport of}} photoassimilates. Here, we show new evidence demonstrating that GSD 1 is localized at the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane and a stretch of 45 amino acid residues at its C-terminal is required for its localization. Association with the plasma membrane is mediated by S-acylation of cysteine residues Cys- 524 and Cys- 527, in a sequence of 45 amino acid residues essential for GSD 1 function in rice. Furthermore, the coiled-coil domain in GSD 1 is necessary for sufficient interaction with OsACT 1. Together, these results reveal that GSD 1 attaches to the plasma membrane through S-acylation and interacts with OsACT 1 through its coiled-coil domain structure to regulate plasmodesmata conductance for photoassimilate transport in rice...|$|E

30|$|That {{off-line}} {{setting value}} is improper is main contributor to hidden defects of protection settings. The off-line setting values are mostly set and modified manually, thus easily result in security risks. Particularly, off-line settings if {{have not been}} modified for a long time, will deteriorated the performance of devices, and may be not adapt to the real-time operation mode of power grid. One of the solutions to get over off-line <b>setting</b> <b>defects</b> is on-line <b>setting</b> [30] for protection devices. An online intelligent early warning system of protective relaying [31] was developed and applied to the power grid of some domestic province. Based on the warning system Scholars at home checked <b>setting</b> hidden <b>defects</b> of protection online, and assessed the risk brought by these defects for the weak links of protection hidden failures. The early warning system sent signals about these weak links and associated measures could be taken timely {{for the security of}} power grid.|$|R
40|$|We study {{uniaxial}} energy minimizers {{within the}} Landau-de Gennes theory for nematic liquid crystals, subject to dirichlet boundary conditions. Topological defects in such minimizers {{correspond to the}} zeros of the corresponding equilibrium field. We consider two-dimensional and three-dimensional domains separately and study the correspondence between Landau-de Gennes theory and Ginzburg-Landau theory for superconductors. We obtain results for the location and dimensionality of the <b>defect</b> <b>set,</b> the minimizer profile near the <b>defect</b> <b>set</b> and study the qualitative properties of uniaxial energy minimizers away from the <b>defect</b> <b>set,</b> in the physically relevant case of vanishing elastic constant. In the three-dimensional case, we establish the C^ 1,α-convergence of uniaxial minimizers to a limiting harmonic map, away from the <b>defect</b> <b>set,</b> for some 0 <α< 1. Some generalizations for biaxial minimizers are also discussed. This work is motivated by the study of defects in liquid crystalline systems and their applications...|$|R

By studying the spectrum curves which is formed by ultrasonic transmitting at different thickness concrete panels can we get different time regular patterns of head waves formed by ultrasonic going through homogeneous concrete, compact grouting pore, grouting incompact pore, not grouting pore. All these provide a basis for predicting prestressed bellows pore grouting quality and judging whether there is interspace in pore.

40|$|In [AHL] Hardt, Lin and {{the author}} proved that the <b>defect</b> <b>set</b> of minimizers of the {{modified}} Ericksen energy for nematic liquid crystals consists locally of a finite union of isolated points and Hölder continuous curves with finitely many crossings. In this article, we show that each Hölder continuous curve in the <b>defect</b> <b>set</b> is of finite length. Hence, the <b>defect</b> <b>set</b> is locally rectifiable. For the most part, the proof follows the work of De Lellis, Marchese, Spadaro and Valtorta [DLMSV] on harmonic Q-valued maps closely.

The goal of this replication was to better understand the complementary aspects of the PBR perspectives. To this end, a brief discussion of the original study is provided as well as a more detailed description of the replication. A detailed statistical analysis is then provided along with analysis of the PBR perspectives. For the individual PBR perspectives, we saw an interesting dichotomy: In the original study there was little overlap among the <b>sets</b> of <b>defects</b> found by each of the three perspectives, while in the replication two of the three perspectives found similar <b>sets</b> of <b>defects</b> on one of the two documents used in the study. Interestingly this document was the only case where the users of PBR were not more effective than the users of a checklist. This result leads to a new hypothesis that the complementary aspect of the PBR perspectives is the characteristic that provides the benefit over other defect detection techniques...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND - During {{the last}} 10 years {{hundreds}} of different defect prediction {{models have been}} published. The performance of the classifiers used in these models {{is reported to be}} similar with models rarely performing above the predictive performance ceiling of about 80 % recall. OBJECTIVE - We investigate the individual defects that four classifiers predict and analyse the level of prediction uncertainty produced by these classifiers. METHOD - We perform a sensitivity analysis to compare the performance of Random Forest, Na??ve Bayes, RPart and SVM classifiers when predicting defects in 12 NASA data <b>sets.</b> The <b>defect</b> predictions that each classifier makes is captured in a confusion matrix and the prediction uncertainty is compared against different classifiers. RESULTS - Despite similar predictive performance values for these four classifiers, each detects different <b>sets</b> of <b>defects.</b> Some classifiers are more consistent in predicting defects than others. CONCLUSIONS - Our results confirm that a unique sub-set of defects can be detected by specific classifiers. However, while some classifiers are consistent in the predictions they make, other classifiers vary in their predictions.

The Conventions of the IERS lag developments in the IGS {{in a number of}} important respects. Recommendations are offered for changes in the IERS Conventions to recognize geocenter motion (as already implemented by the IGS) and to enforce greater model consistency in order to achieve higher precision for combined reference frame products. Despite large improvements in the internal consistency of IGS product <b>sets,</b> <b>defects</b> remain which should be addressed in future developments.

40|$|We have {{performed}} petrographic and spectroscopic studies of brown diamonds from an eclogite xenolith from the Udachnaya pipe (Yakutia, Russia). Brown diamonds are randomly intermixed with colorless {{ones in the}} rock and often located at the grain boundaries of clinopyroxene and garnet. Brown diamonds can be characterized by a <b>set</b> of <b>defects</b> (H 4. N 2 D and a line at 490. 7 nm) which are absent in colorless diamonds. This <b>set</b> of <b>defects</b> is typical for plastically deformed diamonds and indicates that diamonds were likely annealed for {{a relatively short period}} after deformation had occurred. Excitation of brown colored zones with a 632. 8 nm He-Ne laser produced the typical diamond band plus two additional bands at 1730 cm(- 1) and 3350 cm(- 1.) These spectral features are not genuine Raman bands, and can be attributed to photoluminescence at similar to 710 nm (1. 75 eV) and similar to 802 nm (1. 54 eV). No Raman peak corresponding to graphite was observed in regions of brown coloration. Comparison with previous reports of brown diamonds from eclogites showed our eclogitic sample to have a typical structure without signs of apparent deformation. Two mechanisms with regard to diamond deformation are proposed: deformation of eclogite by external forces followed by subsequent recrystallization of silicates or, alternatively, deformation by local stress arising due to decompression and expansion of silicates during ascent of the xenolith to surface conditions.

In this model we assume that (a) the S-wave inverse quality factor {{is related to the}} shear-modulus-versus-frequency dispersion by the same viscoelastic relation as the P-wave inverse quality factor (e. g., the standard linear solid) and (b) the shear-modulus-versus-frequency dispersion is linked to the compressional-modulus-versus-frequency dispersion. To model the latter link, we assume that the reduction in the compressional modulus between the high-frequency and low-frequency limits is due to the introduction of a hypothetical <b>set</b> of aligned <b>defects</b> or flaws (e. g., cracks). Next we assume that the same <b>set</b> of <b>defects</b> is responsible for the reduction in the shear modulus between the high-frequency and low-frequency limits. Finally, by using Hudson’s theory for cracked media we link the shear-modulus-versus-frequency dispersion to the compressional-modulus-versus-frequency dispersion and show that the proportionality coefficient between the two {{is a function of the}} P-to-S-wave velocity ratio (or Poisson’s ratio).
