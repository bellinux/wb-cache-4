40|$|Objectives: To {{explore the}} {{prevalence}} and pattern of neuropsychiatric symptoms in past users of <b>sheep</b> <b>dip</b> and other pesticides. Methods: From a postal survey of men born between 1933 and 1977 and resident in three {{rural areas of}} England and Wales (response rate 31 %), data were obtained on lifetime history of work with pesticides, neurological symptoms in the past month, current mental health and tendency to be troubled by non-neurological somatic symptoms (summarised as a somatising tendency score). Risk factors for current neuropsychiatric symptoms were assessed by modified Cox regression. Results: Data were available for 9844 men, including 1913 {{who had worked with}} <b>sheep</b> <b>dip,</b> 832 with other insecticides but not <b>sheep</b> <b>dip</b> and 990 with other pesticides but never with <b>sheep</b> <b>dip</b> or insecticides. Neurological symptoms were consistently 20 â€“ 60 % more common in past users of <b>sheep</b> <b>dip</b> than in men who had never worked with pesticides, but their prevalence was also higher in men who had worked only with pesticides other than <b>sheep</b> <b>dip</b> or insecticides. They clustered strongly within individuals, but this clustering was not specific to men who had worked with <b>sheep</b> <b>dip.</b> Reporting of three or more neurological symptoms was associated with somatising tendency (prevalence ratio (PR) 15. 0, 95 % CI 11. 4 to 19. 5, for the highest vs the lowest category of somatisation) and was more common in users of <b>sheep</b> <b>dip</b> (PR 1. 3, 95 % CI 1. 0 to 1. 6), other insecticides (PR 1. 4, 95 % CI 1. 0 to 1. 8) and other pesticides (PR 1. 3, 95 % CI 1. 0 to 1. 7) than in non-users. Among users of <b>sheep</b> <b>dip,</b> prevalence was higher in men who had dipped most often, but not in those who had worked with <b>sheep</b> <b>dip</b> concentrate. Past use of pesticides was not associated with current anxiety or depression. Conclusion: Neurological symptoms are more common in men who have worked with <b>sheep</b> <b>dip,</b> but the association is not specific to <b>sheep</b> <b>dip</b> or insecticides. A toxic cause for the excess cannot be ruled out, but several features of our observations suggest that psychological mechanisms have a role. <br/...|$|R

The seven bacteriostatic compounds selected for study were: lauryldimethylbenzylammonium chloride, a mixture of alkyl-, tolyl-, and methyl- trimethylammonium chlorides, 2 -hydroxypropylmethanethiosulphonate, 4 -chloro- 2 -cyclopentylphenol, 2, 2 '-dihydroxy- 3, 5, 6, 3 ', 5 ', 6 '-hexachlorodiphenylmethane, 3, 4, 4 '-trichlorocarbanilide, and an arsenical preparation containing sodium arsenite. They were evaluated against the following indicator organisms; Escherichia coli (Migula) Castellani and Chalmers 1919, a sulphur reducing strain of E. coli Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Schroeter) Migula 1919, Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae (Migula) Buchanan 1918, and Dermatophilus congolensis van Saceghem 1915, emend. 1916, 1934.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{measure the}} {{exposure}} {{of a group of}} farmers to organophosphate pesticide in sheep dip, and to record the incidence of symptoms after exposure. DESIGN: A prospective study of the autumn 1992 dipping period. Working methods were assessed by questionnaire. Absorption of organophosphate pesticide was estimated before, immediately after, and six weeks after dipping by measuring plasma cholinesterase, erythrocyte cholinesterase, and dialkylphosphate urinary metabolites of organophosphates. Symptoms were recorded by questionnaire {{at the same time as}} biological monitoring. Possible confounding factors were identified by medical examination of the subjects. SETTING: Three community council electoral wards in Powys, typical of hill sheep farming areas in Wales. SUBJECTS: All (38) men engaged in <b>sheep</b> <b>dipping</b> living in the three community council electoral wards. RESULTS: 23 sheep farmers and one dipping contractor completed the study [...] a response rate of 63 %. A sample of seven men who refused to enter the full study had similar working practices to the 24 subjects. Subjects reported inadequate handling precautions, and significant skin contamination with dip. Two men reported under diluting dip concentrate for use. Both had significant depression of erythrocyte cholinesterase after dipping. This indicated some absorption of organophosphate pesticide [...] but this did not reach levels usually associated with toxicity. It was not clear whether the symptoms of these two mens were caused by organophosphate exposure. Measurement of dialkylphosphate urinary metabolites in a single specimen of urine voided shortly after the end of dipping could not be correlated with individual exposure. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Sheep</b> <b>dipping</b> is strenuous and dirty work and sheep farmers find it difficult to wear personal protective equipment and avoid skin contamination with dip.

40|$|OBJECTIVESâ€”To {{investigate}} {{the hypothesis that}} chronic low level exposure to organophosphates (OPs) in sheep dips is related to clinically detectable measures of polyneuropathy. â€¨METHODSâ€”The design was a cross sectional exposure-response study of sheep dippers and other non-exposed groups. The study group consisted of 612 Â sheep dipping farmers, 53 Â farmers with no <b>sheep</b> <b>dipping</b> experience, and 107 Â ceramics workers. Retrospective exposure information was obtained by questionnaire based on stable and easily identifiable features of <b>sheep</b> <b>dipping</b> found during {{the first phase of}} the study; in particular, estimates of handling concentrate and splashing with dilute dip. Neurological assessments were based on a standard neuropathy symptoms questionnaire, and thermal and vibration quantitative sensory tests. â€¨RESULTSâ€”Adjusted for confounders there was a weak positive association between cumulative exposure to OPs and neurological symptoms, the significance of which was dependent on the inclusion of a few individual workers with extremely high exposure. There was no evidence of an association between cumulative exposure and the thermal or vibration sensory thresholds. However, separating the effects of exposure intensity and duration showed a higher prevalence of symptoms, primarily of a sensory type, among sheep dippers who handled the OP concentrate. There was also evidence that sensory and vibration thresholds were higher among concentrate handlers, the highest exposed group of dippers. â€¨CONCLUSIONSâ€”The findings showed a strong association between exposure to OP concentrate and neurological symptoms, but a less consistent association with sensory thresholds. There was only weak evidence of a chronic effect of low dose cumulative exposure to OPs. It is suggested that long term health effects may occur in at least some sheep dippers exposed to OPs over a working life, although the mechanisms are unclear. â€¨â€¨â€¨Keywords: organophosphates; sheep dippers; neuropath...|$|E

40|$|<b>Sheep</b> <b>dipping</b> was a {{historic}} agricultural practice where sheep were immersed into insecticides to eradicate external parasites. Historical {{use of pesticides}} has caused localised soil contamination at former <b>sheep</b> <b>dipping</b> sites. There is limited information on offsite contamination such as in stream sediments, groundwater, and surface water. Predominant contaminants at historic <b>sheep</b> <b>dipping</b> sites are arsenic (As) and organochlorine (OC) compounds. There {{are estimated to be}} 50, 000 former sheep dip sites in New Zealand, of which, over 10, 000 are estimated to be in the Waikato Region. Contamination at historical sheep dip sites is potentially concerning for human and environmental health. The objectives of this study were to (1) evaluate a range of historic sheep dips to identify sites that had the highest leaching potential; (2) characterise the selected study sites; (3) establish the extent of contamination in soil, sediments, and water; (4) evaluate the extent of offsite contamination; and (5) assess compliance to environmental guideline limits. Soil samples from two former sheep dip sites were analysed for arsenic, copper, and organochlorines at depths of up to 20 cm. Further soil samples were analysed for arsenic at depths of up to 7. 5 cm. Stream water and sediment samples were analysed for arsenic, copper, and organochlorines at upstream, downstream, and discharge point of a dip site located on a flood zone. Arsenic (0 - 2, 839 mg/kg), dieldrin (0 - 8. 60 mg/kg), lindane (including by-products) (0 - 0. 560 mg/kg), DDT (including metabolites) (0 - 1. 200 mg/kg), and endrin (0 - 0. 127 mg/kg) were the main contaminants detected in soil samples. Concentrations of As (0. 9 - 32 mg/kg), dieldrin (0 - 0. 038 mg/kg), and benzene hexachloride (Î±-BHC and Î²-BHC) (0 - 0. 0031 mg/kg) were detected in stream sediments. Organochlorine was not detected in surface water. As in surface water ranged from 0 to 0. 0021 g/m 3, which was well below the maximum acceptable value (MAV) of 0. 01 g/m 3 for potable drinking water supplies. Arsenic concentrations in 142 soil samples were well above environmental guidelines for human habitation (30 mg/kg). Dieldrin recorded low to moderate contamination in soils with one sample exceeding the environmental guideline of 6 mg/kg. Arsenic in 4 of the 18 stream sediment samples were above the interim sediment quality low level guideline (ISQG-Low) of 20 mg/kg. Dieldrin concentrations in surface sediments up to 13 cm deep were well above the interim sediment quality high level guideline (ISQG-High) of 0. 008 mg/kg. Î±-BHC and Î²-BHC had no ISQG guideline. The levels detected were above the lindane guideline (ISQG-High) of 0. 001 mg/kg in surface sediments. Evidence of sheep dip chemicals moving away from a sheep dip site included arsenic, dieldrin, and DDT up to 100 m downhill from a dip site located on the margins of a steep slope with an adjacent gully. Elevated As was detected in stream sediments up to 40 m downstream of a dip site located on a flood zone. High level contamination from dieldrin, Î±-BHC, and Î²-BHC were recorded in downstream sediments. This study recommends that sheep dips located within 15 m of a stream and margins of steep slopes with an adjacent gully should be regarded as priority sites for contaminated land investigations that should include a monitoring programme...|$|E
40|$|<b>Sheep</b> <b>dipping</b> with {{organophosphate}} or synthetic pyrethroid-based formulations {{is still}} widely used by {{farmers in the}} UK to control ectoparasites and results in 175 â€“ 220 million litres of spent sheep dip produced each year. Spent sheep dip may be diluted in animal slurry or water prior to disposal onto land. However, {{the effects of this}} practice on the microbial ecology of animal slurries, soil and aquatic systems are still relatively unknown. This paper investigated the effect of Bayticol (synthetic pyrethroid sheep dip) and Ectomort (organophosphate sheep dip) concentrations on (i) the survival of 15 protozoan species, (ii) the recovery of the four species of amoebae, and (iii) bacterial survival and growth. This investigation found that overall Bayticol was less toxic to protozoa than Ectomort, with minimum inhibitory concentrations ranging from 0. 01 to 0. 03 % (v/v) and 0. 005 to 0. 06 % (v/v), respectively. Amoebic cysts remained viable and emerged from dormancy, thereby pointing to the potential for recovery of protozoan communities in contaminated environments. The presence of sheep dips did not affect bacterial survival and growth on agar; however, the five test bacteria were not able to utilise the sheep dips as sole carbon sources. These findings have implications for the contamination of animal slurries, soil and aquatic systems, in that there is the potential for significant increases in microbial numbers, containing putative pathogens due to the diminution of bacteriophagous protozoan populations...|$|E
40|$|The {{practice}} of <b>sheep</b> <b>dipping,</b> which subjected livestock to inorganic and organic agricultural pesticides to eradicate pests such as lice and keds, {{is a historic}} practice; <b>sheep</b> <b>dipping</b> is no longer practiced in New Zealand today. Animals would be submerged in solid structures known as dips containing chemicals such as arsenicals and organochlorines with the leftover solution pumped onto surrounding soil. The use of pesticides such as these is now banned by law due to their persistence in the environment. Today an estimated 50, 000 contaminated sheep dip sites exist in New Zealand representing perhaps the countriesâ€™ most significant, but understated, environmental challenge. To determine whether this historic agricultural practice had led to contamination of the environment, {{an investigation into the}} extent of contamination resulting from <b>sheep</b> <b>dipping</b> at a known historic dip site in Te Mahia, New Zealand was carried out. Characterisation of the site by arsenic soil concentration mapping revealed that 500 m 2 of agricultural land has been contaminated with this metalloid and that arsenic exists at varying high concentrations through the soil profile. Environmental risk from these historic pesticides was established by analysing plant and water samples below the dip site. Staple Maori food varieties such as watercress were significantly contaminated with arsenic while water samples taken from the stream below the dip returned spiked arsenic concentrations. Based on this, it was justified that arsenic/organochlorine contamination would need to be managed to reduce their effect on these food sources. The design of a coupled remediation strategy using phytoextraction and biochar was utilized to reduce remediation times and is the basis of this thesis. Contaminated soil from the site was removed and amended with two types of biochar produced from willow feedstock. These biochars, known as 350 Â°C and 550 Â°C biochar were added into the soil at application rates of 30 t ha- 1 and 60 t ha- 1. During a series of 180 d glasshouse trials, the phytoextraction of arsenic into Lolium perenne (ryegrass) shoot tissue was analysed along with growth parameters of shoot and root biomass and corresponding response to arsenic at the molecular level. In soil; microbial activity, soil bacterial community, organochlorine concentration, and element dynamics were analysed as a function of biochar amendment. Soil microbial activity, analysed using the dehydrogenase assay (DHA), was significantly increased (P< 0. 01) under all biochar treatments compared to the control after 180 d during two glasshouse trials. Metagenomic analysis of the soil bacterial community revealed that biochar amended soils were selecting for bacterial species such as Chryseobacterium, Flavobacterium and Dyadobacter and the family Pseudomonadaceae which are known bioremediators of hydrocarbons. This resulted in isomers of the organochlorine hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH), particularly alpha-HCH and gamma-HCH (lindane), undergoing 10 -fold and 4 -fold reductions in soil concentrations respectively (2. 2 mg kg- 1 and 0. 4 mg kg- 1) compared to the control (25 mg kg- 1 and 1. 6 mg kg- 1 respectively). Amendment of soil with both biochars also caused a significant reduction (P< 0. 01) in soil DDT levels. Biochar promoted a 2 -fold increase in shoot dry weight (DW) and a 3 -fold increase in root DW after 180 d during one glasshouse trial while during the second trial only ryegrass root biomass was significantly increased as a function of biochar amendment. This increase was attributed, at least in part, to the fertility value of biochar. No negative effect of biochar amendments on ryegrass germination was observed. All biochar amendments resulted in significant increases in arsenic concentrations within ryegrass shoot material. Through extrapolation, 350 Â°C biochar amended soils was estimated to have the potential to increase ryegrass sward DW growth by 0. 68 t ha- 1 compared to ryegrass grown on unamended soils and would correspond to an increase in the extraction of total arsenic by 14, 000 mg ha- 1 compared to unamended soils and in doing so decrease soil remediation times by over 50 %. Increased arsenic uptake as a function of biochar amendment resulted in increased enzymic activity of components of the antioxidant pathway including SOD and APX in most biochar treatments but across all treatments a reduction in GPX activity was observed. Analysis of specific metabolites utilizing metabolomics also suggest a definitive metabolite profile under biochar amendment compared to contaminated control ryegrass samples. However, {{there was no significant difference}} (P< 0. 05) in chlorophyll content in response to the total arsenic concentration in ryegrass shoot tissue grown on contaminated soil. The observed increases in activity of SOD, APX and steady CAT activity is suggested to be efficiently catalysing the production of harmful ROS in this soil. A 6 -month field investigation into the effect of biochar amendment on the extraction of arsenic into a high biomass crop (Salix sp) resulted in significant increases of arsenic in stem biomass as a function of biochar amendment. When data was extrapolated to predict results of a long-term field trial and scale under willow treatment (stem) it was calculated that over 67. 7 g of arsenic could be extracted in soils amended with 350 Â°C biochar compared to 5. 9 g extracted under control treatment. This could result - assuming a similar rate of extraction with time - in levels of arsenic concentration in soils reaching background concentrations in as little as 6 years, a reduction in remediation times of 92 %...|$|E

Organophosphorus insecticides (OPs) are used {{all over the world}} for crop protection, for other agricultural practices such as <b>sheep</b> <b>dipping</b> and, in aquaculture, for the control of sea lice. Ops besides showing a specific neurotoxicity and have also been related to various modern diseases, including Creutzfeldtâ€“Jakob (CJD) and the Gulf War syndrome. Although OPs are less persistent than Organoclorine pesticides (OCs), they still constitute an environmental risks thus increasing the social concern about their levels in soils, surface waters, and ground waters. Degradation of OPs by microorganisms has been assessed for a few bacterial strains. In the present study the OPs degrading potential of indigenous soil microorganisms was investigated. Using enrichment cultures in which parathion was the only C and energy sources many bacterial strains were isolated from OPs contaminated and pristine agricultural soils characterized by different physico-chemical properties. More than 40 potential OPs degraders were isolated and grouped in operational taxonomic units (OTU) using analysis of polymorphism showed by the ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS). Partial sequencing of 16 S rRNA gene of representative isolates of each OTU revealed that most of them belong to Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria. All the analyzed soils showed the presence of putative OPs degraders: the highest diversity was found in organic cultivated soils, the lowest in chemically cultivated soils. Degradation of different OPs, characterized by different physical and chemical properties, was obtained by different selected representative strains using SPME GC-MS analysis on water and soil microcosms.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Australian {{farmers and}} their workers {{are exposed to}} a wide variety of pesticides. Organophosphate (OP) {{insecticides}} are a widely used class of pesticide used for animal husbandry practices (Naphthalophos for <b>sheep</b> <b>dipping,</b> jetting and drench), crop production for pest control (Dimethoate) and in public health (Maldison for head lice). Acute poisonings with this class of insecticide are reported among agricultural workers and children around the globe, due to the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE). Less is known about chronic exposures. Regular monitoring of erythrocyte AChE will enable farmers to identify potential exposure to organophosphate insecticides and take action to reduce exposures and improve their health and safety practices. This study aims to assess and improve the integration of AChE monitoring into routine point of care health clinics, and provide farming and non-farming people with a link between their AChE activity and their household chemical and agrichemical use. METHODS/DESIGN: The research will target individuals who work on mixed farming enterprises and routinely using OPs (nâ€‰=â€‰ 50) and non-farmers (nâ€‰=â€‰ 30). Baseline data are collected regarding demographic, health conditions and behaviours, Kessler 10 (K 10) scores, chemical use and personal protection. Baseline anthropometric measures include height, weight, hip and waist circumference, body fat analysis and, biochemical analysis of fasted total serum cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density cholesterol (LDL), high-density cholesterol (HDL) and blood glucose. Analysis of erythrocyte cholinesterase (EAChE) activity is also conducted using a finger prick test. Testing of EAChE is then repeated in all participants every 3 Â weeks for a maximum of three times over a period 10 Â weeks. Participants are provided with full feedback and counselling about their EAChE activity after each reading and a detailed summary provided to all participants at the completion of the study. Data will be analysed using repeated measures within a general linear model. DISCUSSION: This work will provide an evidence base and recommendations for the integration of EAChE monitoring into Australian rural health clinics, leading to research which will further quantify pesticide exposure both on the farm and in the home, highlighting the importance of sustaining and providing a safe work and home environment for farming communities.

These dips are redundant in the major sheep breeding countries, as the backliners and jetting provide a better alternative.|$|R
