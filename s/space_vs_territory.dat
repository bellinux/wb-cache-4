5000|$|Dealing with {{criminal}} matters, Campbell wrote opinions in Buffehr <b>v.</b> <b>Territory</b> of Arizona, 11 Arizona 165 (1907) which {{dealt with the}} theft of a fifty dollar gold certificate, the statutory rape case of Levy <b>v.</b> <b>Territory</b> of Arizona, 13 Arizona 425 (1911), and the attempted murder case of Williams <b>v.</b> <b>Territory</b> of Arizona, 13 Arizona 306 (1911). In Spence <b>v.</b> <b>Territory</b> of Arizona, 12 Arizona 20 (1910), Campbell ruled that testimony by an experienced big game hunter {{about the nature of}} inflicted wounds could be allowed during trial involving a right of self-defense argument. He also granted a retrial to a union organizer convicted of {{assault with a deadly weapon}} in Ryan <b>v.</b> <b>Territory</b> of Arizona, 12 Arizona 208 (1909). In other matters, Campbell sided with the territorial medical board in Aiton v. The Board of Medical Examiners, 13 Arizona 354 (1911) when the doctor claimed his [...] "mineral waters and preparations" [...] had medicinal benefit in the treatment of [...] "incipient tuberculosis, system catarrh, and catarrh of the head, Bright's disease, diabetes, rheumatism, and numerous other diseases". The justice found the territorial laws allowed a referendum on the prohibition of alcohol to be placed before the voters in Thalheimer v. Board of Supervisors of Maricopa County, 11 Arizona 430 (1908). Campbell also wrote opinion in Tribolet v. The United States, 11 Arizona 435 (1908), the only antitrust case to come before the territorial court.|$|R

5000|$|President Theodore Roosevelt {{appointed}} Nave {{to replace}} Eugene A. Tucker as Associate Justice on the Arizona Territorial Supreme Court on November 8, 1905. [...] He took his {{oath of office}} on November 17. [...] As a justice, Nave wrote a number of opinions with significant impact. In addition {{to a number of}} cases dealing with mining concerns, Nave's opinion in <b>Territory</b> of Arizona <b>v.</b> Ruval, 9 Arizona 415 (1906) dealt with the issue of double jeopardy while Maxwell <b>v.</b> <b>Territory</b> of Arizona, 10 Arizona 1 (1906) considered degrees of a crime with respect to a convicted cattle rustler. Ford v. United States, 12 Arizona 23 (1908) was concerned with charges of conspiracy to commit adultery within a brothel. Eytinge <b>v.</b> <b>Territory</b> of Arizona, 12 Arizona 131 (1909) dealt with murder by chloroform while Molina <b>v.</b> <b>Territory</b> of Arizona, 12 Arizona 14 (1908) involved a murder charge reduced to manslaughter.|$|R
50|$|The main {{example is}} the case that the real vector <b>space</b> <b>V</b> is a {{hermitian}} vector <b>space</b> (<b>V,</b> h), i.e., V is equipped with a complex structure J that is an orthogonal transformation with respect to the inner product g on V. Then V ⊗R C splits in the ±i eigenspaces of J. These eigenspaces are isotropic for the complexification of g and can be identified with the complex vector <b>space</b> (<b>V,</b> J) and its complex conjugate (V, −J). Therefore, for a hermitian vector <b>space</b> (<b>V,</b> h) the vector space Λ (as well as its complex conjugate ΛV) is a spinor space for the underlying real euclidean vector space.|$|R
