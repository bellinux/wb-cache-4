40|$|InGaAs/InP‐photodiodes from {{different}} manufacturers have got rather low noise level, a good response uniformity over the sensitive surface {{and a wide}} dynamic range. Therefore they are good devices to built radiometers in the NIR spectral region. As in any photodiode, the spectral short‐circuit responsivity {{is determined by the}} wavelength and the photodiode’s reflectance and internal quantum efficiency. Then if these quantities were known, the photodiode’s responsivity would be known without being compared to another standard radiometer; i. e. the photodiode would be an absolute radiometer for optical radiation measurements. This idea was firstly developed for silicon photodiodes in the eighties, once the technology was able to produce low defects photodiodes[1]. Following this reference, the reflectance could be approached from a superimposed thin layers model. By knowing the thicknesses of the layers and the optical constants of the materials, it is possible to determine the device reflectance. However, this information is not completely available for InGaAs/InP photodiodes: the actual thickness of the layers is not known and optical constants of materials are only approximately known for bulk. Nevertheless it’s possible to measure reflectance at some wavelengths and to fit the thicknesses of a layer model that would reproduce those experimental values. The internal quantum efficiency cannot be determined as in [2], since InGaAs photodiodes are hetero‐junctions rather than homo‐junctions as silicon photodiodes are. In the other hand, since the internal structure is not accurately known, {{it is not possible to}} model the internal quantum efficiency without having experimental values for it. Therefore the attainable scope at present is just to obtain a model to be able to calculate spectral responsivity values at any wavelength. To get this, a model has been developed to calculate reflectance values from experimental ones at some wavelengths and another model has been developed to interpolate <b>spectral</b> <b>internal</b> quantum efficiency values from some values got from reflectance and responsivity measurements at some wavelengths.

This paper presents a new, generic method to compare the information content of such a set of images, the "Stained Glass Procedure". It overcomes the stated problems by computing the scale-dependent, <b>internal</b> <b>spectral</b> variation in an image and by using this as an indicator for land cover information. The Stained Glass Procedure creates segments in the images and calculates the <b>internal</b> <b>spectral</b> variation in a high-spatial-resolution image for each segment.

By taking into account different collection probabilities for the excitons in the polymer and the fullerene, {{we are able to}} reproduce <b>absorptance,</b> <b>internal</b> and external quantum efficiency, as well as current/voltage curves of bulk heterojunction solar cells. We further investigate the influence of mobilities of the free excitons as well as the mobilities of the free charge carriers on the performance of bulk heterojunction solar cells. We find that, in general, the highest efficiencies are achieved with the highest mobilities. However, an optimum finite mobility of free charge carriers can result from a large recombination velocity at the contacts. In contrast, Langevin-type of recombination cannot lead to finite optimum mobilities even though this mechanism has a strong dependence on the free carrier mobilities.

Wavelet transforms are most popular with electrical and communication engineers to analyse the signals. From last few years, Wavelet transforms are in use for structural engineering problems, like solution of ordinary and partial differential equations. Dynamical problems in structural engineering fall under two categories, one involving low frequencies (structural dynamics problems) and the other involving high frequencies (wave propagation problems). Spectral Finite Element (SFE) method is a transform method to solve the high frequency excitation problems which are encountered in structural engineering. SFE based on Fourier transforms has high limitations in handling finite structures and boundary conditions. SFE based with wavelet transforms is a very good tool to analyse the dynamical problems and eliminate many limitations. In this project, a model for embedded de-laminated composite beam is developed using the wavelet based spectral finite element (WSFE) method for the de-lamination effect on response using wave propagation analysis. The simulated responses are used as surrogate experimental results for the inverse problem of detection of damage using wavelet filtering. The technique used to model a structure that, through width de-lamination subdivides the beam into base-laminates and sub-laminates along the line of de-lamination. The base-laminates and sub-laminates are treated as structural waveguides and kinematics are enforced along the connecting line.

Observations of 2018 targets in a magnitude-limited sample of 2911 objects to RAB = 24. 4 yield secure redshifts for a sample of 1440 galaxies and AGN plus 96 stars. In addition to redshifts and associated quality assessments, our catalog also includes photometric and astrometric measurements for all targets detected in our R-band imaging survey of the GOODS-N region.

Porous silicon is an attractive material for sensing applications due to its high surface area, readily modified surface chemistry, and optical signal transduction capability. This thesis describes the construction and chemical modification of porous silicon photonic crystals for use in chemical sensing. The specific aims of this work were to develop new methods to maximize sensor stability, remove background signal interference, and to induce chemical specificity into the sensor. This thesis begins with an introduction on porous silicon preparation methods and its sensing mechanisms, as well as different chemicals and biomolecules that have been detected and their detection limit. We show a multitude of chemical modifications of the porous silicon surface that produce long-term stability and induce analyte class specificity to the sensor. Next, a method to remove interfering effects of changing relative humidity from the response of porous silicon is developed. Two porous silicon films are separately etched and chemically modified into silicon, {{one on top of the}} other. The response of each film is measured simultaneously. Each film has a characteristic response towards water vapor. The effect of changing humidity can then be accounted for by calculating the weighted difference between the two layer responses.
