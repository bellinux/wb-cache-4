2500|$|For {{the purpose}} of network management, an IP address {{is divided into two}} logical parts, the network prefix and the host {{identifier}} or rest field. All hosts on a <b>subnetwork</b> have the same network prefix. This routing prefix occupies the most-significant bits of the address. The number of bits allocated within a network to the internal routing prefix may vary between subnets, depending on the network architecture. [...] While in IPv6 the prefix must consist of a set of contiguous 1-bits, in IPv4 this is not enforced, though there is no advantage to using non-contiguous 1-bits. The host part is a unique local identification and is either a host number on the local network or an interface identifier.|$|E
2500|$|The first testing {{television}} station in Mexico signed on in 1935. When KFMB-TV in San Diego signed on in 1949, Baja California {{became the first}} state to receive a commercial {{television station}} over the air. Within a year, the Mexican government would adopt the U.S. NTSC 525-line B/W 60-field-per-second system as the country's broadcast standard. In 1950, the first commercial television station within Mexico, XHTV in Mexico City, signed on the air, followed by XEW-TV in 1951 and XHGC in 1952. Those three were not only the first television stations in the country, but also the flagship stations of Telesistema Mexicano, which was formed in 1955. That year, Emilio Azcárraga Vidaurreta, who had signed on XEW-TV, entered into a partnership with Rómulo O'Farrill who had signed on XHTV, and Guillermo González Camarena, who had signed on XHGC. The earliest 3D television broadcasts in the world were broadcast over XHGC in 1954. Color television was introduced in 1962, also over XHGC-TV. One of Telesistema Mexicano's earliest broadcasts as a network, over XEW-TV, on June 25, 1955, was the first international North American broadcast in the medium's history, and was jointly aired with NBC in the United States, where it aired as the premiere episode of Wide Wide World, and the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. [...] Except for a brief period between 1969–1973, nearly every commercial television station in Mexico, with exceptions in the border cities, was expected to affiliate with a <b>subnetwork</b> of Telesistema Mexicano or its successor, Televisa (formed by the 1973 merger of Telesistema Mexicano and Television Independiente de Mexico). This condition would not be relaxed for good until 1993, when Imevision was privatized to become TV Azteca.|$|E

40|$|SummaryA {{fundamental}} {{challenge in}} studying the frontal lobe is to parcellate this cortex into “natural” functional modules {{despite the absence of}} topographic maps, which are so helpful in primary sensory areas. Here we show that unsupervised clustering algorithms, applied to 96 -channel array recordings from prearcuate gyrus, reveal spatially segregated <b>subnetworks</b> that remain stable across behavioral contexts. Looking for natural groupings of neurons based on response similarities, we discovered that the recorded area includes at least two spatially segregated <b>subnetworks</b> that differentially represent behavioral choice and reaction time. Importantly, these <b>subnetworks</b> are detectable during different behavioral states and, surprisingly, are defined better by “common noise” than task-evoked responses. Our parcellation process works well on “spontaneous” neural activity, and thus bears strong resemblance to the identification of “resting-state” networks in fMRI data sets. Our results demonstrate a powerful new tool for identifying cortical <b>subnetworks</b> by objective classification of simultaneously recorded electrophysiological activity...|$|R
40|$|Network based {{analyses}} {{are commonly used}} as powerful tools to interpret the findings of genome-wide as-sociation studies (GWAS) in a functional context. In particular, identification of disease-associated functional modules, i. e., highly connected protein-protein interaction (PPI) <b>subnetworks</b> with high aggregate disease association, are shown to be promising in uncovering the functional relationships among disease-associated genes and proteins. An important issue {{in this regard is}} the scoring of <b>subnetworks</b> by integrating two quanti-ties that are not readily compatible: disease association of individual gene products and network connectivity among proteins. Current scoring schemes either disregard the level of connectivity and focus on the aggregate disease association of connected proteins or use a linear combination of these two quantities. However, such scoring schemes may produce arbitrarily large <b>subnetworks</b> which are often not statistically significant, or require tuning of parameters that are used to weigh the contributions of network connectivity and disease association. Here, we propose a parameter-free scoring scheme that aims to score <b>subnetworks</b> by assessing the disease association of pairwise interactions and incorporating the statistical significance of network connec-tivity and disease association. We test the proposed scoring scheme on a GWAS dataset for type II diabetes (T 2 D). Our results suggest that <b>subnetworks</b> identified by commonly used methods may fail tests of statis-tical significance after correction for multiple hypothesis testing. In contrast, the proposed scoring scheme yields highly significant <b>subnetworks,</b> which contain biologically relevant proteins that cannot be identified by analysis of genome-wide association data alone. ...|$|R

Specifically, the three <b>subnetworks</b> generate bar profiles, beat profiles and notes in turn, and the output of the high-level <b>subnetworks</b> are fed into the low-level <b>subnetworks,</b> serving as guidance for generating the finer time-scale melody components. Two human behavior experiments demonstrate the advantage of this structure over the single-layer LSTM which attempts to learn all hidden structures in melodies.

40|$|It {{has been}} widely {{accepted}} that attention {{can be divided into}} three <b>subnetworks</b> - alerting, orienting and executive control (EC), and the <b>subnetworks</b> of attention are linked to distinct brain regions.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} "critical path" networks {{which are}} used for the planning and scheduling of projects that consist of well defined sequences of individual activities. When the number of activities is large, it becomes difficult to prepare a network for the project as one unit, and {{it may also be}} difficult to store the network in the high speed memory of a digital computer. Also, in the cases where there are two or more independent projects, which are weakly inter-related by common activities, the problem of efficient scheduling of all the projects becomes quite difficult.

40|$|We {{describe}} {{the use of}} the matrix eigenvalue decomposition (EVD) and pseudoinverse projection and a tensor higher-order EVD (HOEVD) in reconstructing the pathways that compose a cellular system from genome-scale nondirectional networks of correlations among the genes of the system. The EVD formulates a genes × genes network as a linear superposition of genes × genes decorrelated and decoupled rank- 1 <b>subnetworks,</b> which can be associated with functionally independent pathways. The integrative pseudoinverse projection of a network computed from a “data” signal onto a designated “basis” signal approximates the network as a linear superposition of only the <b>subnetworks</b> that are common to both signals and simulates observation of only the pathways that are manifest in both experiments. We define a comparative HOEVD that formulates a series of networks as linear superpositions of decorrelated rank- 1 <b>subnetworks</b> and the rank- 2 couplings among these <b>subnetworks,</b> which can be associated with independent pathways and the transitions among them common to all networks in the series or exclusive to a subset of the networks.
