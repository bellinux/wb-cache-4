40|$|The {{general purpose}} {{tool of the}} Australian Aborigines, usually known as a stone axe, is more {{correctly}} termed a hatchet since it conforms to the design requirements of a tool made for one-handed use. Similar implements not so conforming appear to be special purpose tools. A geometrical feature common to all these tools and perhaps to other types is the 'median plane' which determines {{the position of the}} edge and governs some of its operational properties. Some dynamical features of stone hatchet heads, the design of handles for them and their <b>security</b> <b>of</b> <b>mounting</b> are examined and compared with the features of modern steel hatchets...|$|E

The prison has held {{a variety of different}} categories of prisoners, both male and female over the course of its history. Between 1869 and 1958, 95 judicial executions took place on the gallows at Durham prison or the court house.In 1832, protests over working conditions in the South Shields workhouse were supported by miner strikes. Soldiers were sent to evict striking miners from their pubs. One miner was convicted of the murder of a local magistrate near Jarrow Slake. He was hanged amid heightened <b>security</b> <b>of</b> 50 <b>mounted</b> Hussars and 50 infantrymen to protect the gallows. His body was gibbeted after death.|$|R
