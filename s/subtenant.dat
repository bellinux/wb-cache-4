25|$|Patent Rolls {{and similar}} reveal the Vale was {{originally}} a farm with several tenants and later it became {{in effect a}} single farm (Langley Bottom Farm) and that after the Black Death or at least after the 14th century it started to disappear from the map. In a document dated 1255/1268 the land appears to be held by a William de Langley. John at Ley from Headley takes it on in 1331/2 and again in 1333/4, succeeding John de Langley. In 1347/8 the tenant is a John at Ley then the records give out. In 1435/6 another John Langley is tenant as <b>subtenant</b> of a William de Langhead of Epsom. The manorial survey of 1496 suggests it was being farmed as a single holding.|$|E

50|$|The {{premises}} {{in question}} was operated as a grocery store by a <b>subtenant</b> beginning October 20, 1960. However, the shopping centre was not successful and was never fully leased. By March 24, 1962, the <b>subtenant</b> gave notice that it intended to close down its business. It did so and began to remove its goods.|$|E
50|$|In {{real estate}} law, {{sublease}} (or, less formally, sublet) {{is the name}} given to an arrangement in which the lessee (e.g. tenant) in a lease assigns the lease to a third party, thereby making the old lessee the sublessor, and the new lessee the sublessee, or <b>subtenant.</b> This means {{they are not only}} leasing the property, but also subleasing it simultaneously. For example, if a company leases an office space directly from a landlord, the lessor, and subsequently outgrows the office, then the company can sublease the smaller office space to another company, the <b>subtenant,</b> and enter into a new lease for a larger office space, thereby hedging their real estate exposure.|$|E

50|$|To {{circumvent}} {{privity of estate}} {{which is}} the general principle flowing from privity of contract, laws exist in several jurisdictions to bind <b>subtenants</b> {{to some of the}} restrictive covenants (terms) of the headlease, for instance in England and Wales those which have been held by courts to touch and concern the land.|$|R

50|$|In {{residential}} real estate, it {{is sometimes}} illegal to charge the <b>subtenant</b> more than the original amount in the sublessee's contract (for instance, in a rent control situation where the rental amount is controlled by law). Subletting of social housing is generally illegal, whatever the rent charged to the subtenant; in the UK it is officially described as a category of housing fraud.|$|E
50|$|On July 16, 1962, the {{landlord}} {{filed suit against}} the tenant.

On that date {{the landlord}} took possession of the premises and attempted to find a new tenant.|$|E
50|$|The hamlet was not {{mentioned}} in Domesday Book in 1086 because it formed part of the manor of Monks Risborough. It was later subinfeudated (i.e. granted as a feudal sub-manor) to a military <b>subtenant</b> and was held by knight-service by the 13th century. It continued as a separate sub-manor, paying a quit-rent to the manor of Monks Risborough until copyhold tenure was abolished in 1925.|$|E
5000|$|The area is {{referred}} to in a 1732 survey of the Murray-Hamilton estate, of which {{it was a small}} part (see public records office Belfast).

50|$|Evidence of the {{inadequacy}} of the settlement for the poorest residents comes from the legal challenge they made in 1630 to express dissatisfaction with the proceedings. Only 30 of the 184 complainants were entitled to compensation. The others were tenants on lands cleared without permission or <b>subtenants</b> who had no right of common. These residents were the main obstacle to reaching agreement on disafforestation. The area lacked important industries, so large numbers of cottagers had settled in the forest and survived by using the common.|$|R
50|$|Lieutenant-General Sir Edwin Alderson (1859-1927) had {{his home}} at The Glen as a <b>subtenant</b> {{in the years}} 1914 to 1916, coinciding with his period {{commanding}} the Canadian Expeditionary Force in World War I.

5000|$|Housing. Housing was inter-related with electoral representation, and {{therefore}} political power at local and Stormont levels. The general vote {{was confined to}} the occupier of a house and his wife. Occupiers' children over 21 and any servants or <b>subtenants</b> in a house were excluded from voting. So the allocation of a public authority house {{was not just the}} allocation of a scarce resource: it was the allocation of two votes. Therefore, whoever controlled the allocation of public authority housing effectively controlled the voting in that area.|$|R
5000|$|The area {{is known}} as [...] "Collegeland" [...] (or [...] "College Land") because it was {{formerly}} the property of Trinity College, Dublin. In 1859, the lease of the Collure estate (as it was then known) was inherited at his father's death by John Howard Parnell, elder brother of Charles Stewart Parnell. In 1879, John Parnell, financially strapped, offered his <b>subtenants</b> terms on which to purchase their own farms, according to the [...] "John Bright Clauses" [...] of the Landlord and Tenant (Ireland) Act 1870.|$|R
50|$|The town of Lenzburg {{immediately}} {{surrendered to}} the advancing army on 20 April, but the castle for the moment remained untouched by the conflict. Konrad of Weinsberg, the king's representative, attempted to secure it for the Empire and had it prepared for a siege. But by August he saw the futility of this plan and in 1418 returned the castle to {{the control of the}} Schultheiss family. After lengthy negotiations, Bern was able to secure control of the County of Lenzburg as <b>subtenants</b> in 1433 and finally in 1442 of the castle.|$|R
5000|$|Frank Dobson {{has been}} the subject of {{controversy}} for living in a council flat whilst on a six figure ministerial salary.

Here he took residence in 1958 as a <b>subtenant</b> farmer, immersing himself in local politics. Beginning in 1958, with the help of students from the Cuzco University, Blanco’s Quechua federation mobilized the allegados against the hacendados and arrendires.|$|E
5000|$|As {{farmland}} {{became more}} commercialised in Scotland during the 18th century, land was often rented through auctions. This {{led to an}} inflation of rents that priced many tenants out of the market. [...] Furthermore, changes in agricultural practice meant the replacement of part-time labourer or <b>subtenants</b> (known as cottars, cottagers, or bondsmen) with full-time agricultural labourers who lived either on the main farm or in rented accommodation in growing or newly founded villages. This led many contemporary writers and modern historians to associate the Agricultural Revolution with the disappearance of cottars and {{their way of life}} from many parts of the southern Scotland.|$|R
50|$|The ''''Charter of 1606'''', {{also known}} as the First Charter of Virginia, is a {{document}} from King James I of England to the Virginia Company assigning land rights to colonists for the stated purpose of propagating the Christian religion. The land is described as coastal Virginia and islands near to the coast, but the surveying numbers correspond to modern day South Carolina to Canada. The land itself would remain the property of the King, with the London Company and the Plymouth Company (the two divisions of the Virginia Company) as the King's tenants, and the settlers as <b>subtenants.</b> The colony's government at first consisted of a council residing in London. The document designated the London Company as responsible for financing the project, which included recruiting settlers and providing for their transport and supplies.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to give an account of the life and times of Denis KilBride in as {{balanced}} a fashion as possible. KilBride had a long and varied career and lived to be seventy-six years of age. The study concentrates on his life and times, which included the Luggacurren evictions of which he played a major part, his path to political life and his representation of three constituencies, south Kerry, north Galway and south Kildare for a period of thirty-one years. As a result of the prolonged depression in agriculture, KilBride, an educated and politically active gentlemen tenant farmer with his own <b>subtenants</b> and labourers, in an era of rising expectations, was to experience insurmountable financial difficulties, which culminated in his eventual eviction from an 868 acre farm on the Lansdowne estate at Wood House, Luggacurren. The Luggacurren evictions took place during the turbulent agrarian agitation years of the plan of campaign from cl 886 - 1906...|$|R
