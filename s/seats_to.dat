5|$|As Duke and Duchess of York, George and May {{carried out}} a variety of public duties. In 1897, she became the patron of the London Needlework Guild in {{succession}} to her mother. The guild, initially established as The London Guild in 1882, was renamed several times and was named after May between 1914 and 2010. Samples of her own embroidery range from chair <b>seats</b> <b>to</b> tea cosies.|$|E
5|$|In January 1874, Gladstone {{called a}} general election, {{convinced}} that if he waited longer, he would do worse at the polls. Balloting was spread over two weeks, beginning on 1 February. Disraeli devoted much of his campaign to decrying the Liberal programme {{of the past five}} years. As the constituencies voted, {{it became clear that the}} result would be a Conservative majority, the first since 1841. In Scotland, where the Conservatives were perennially weak, they increased from seven <b>seats</b> <b>to</b> nineteen. Overall, they won 350 <b>seats</b> <b>to</b> 245 for the Liberals and 57 for the Irish Home Rule League. The Queen sent for Disraeli, and he became Prime Minister for the second time.|$|E

5|$|The 1950 United States Senate {{election}} in California followed a campaign characterized by accusations and name-calling.

5|$|The ECSC {{was founded}} by the Treaty of Paris in 1951; however, there was no {{decision}} on where to base {{the institutions of the}} new community.

50|$|Bowen {{ran for a}} <b>seat</b> <b>to</b> Edmonton City Council for {{the first}} time in the 1919 Edmonton {{municipal}} election. He won the fifth-place <b>seat</b> <b>to</b> earn his first two-year term on council as an Alderman.|$|R

5|$|The {{most common}} serious {{injuries}} were multiple lower leg fractures and dislocations, spinal fractures, hip fractures, head injuries, and multiple lacerations and contusions. The NTSB investigators found severe {{damage on the}} floor of the cabin, leading many of the passengers' <b>seats</b> <b>to</b> fracture where the legs met the floor track. This fracturing permitted many of the <b>seats</b> <b>to</b> come loose during the impact and aggravated the passengers' injuries. The report posits that the passengers' legs hit the lower seat frames in front of them. At the same time, the seats collapsed and twisted downward and to the left, likely causing hip and spinal fractures. As the impact progressed, the seats, now separated, flung passengers forward into each other as well as into other wreckage, causing head injuries and lacerations. Passengers holding onto infants reported being unable to either prevent their children from being ejected from their grasp in the impact or locate their children in the darkness afterward. The NTSB held that, had the children been in Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)-approved child seats, many injuries might have been mitigated. Rescuers remarked that some infants were found smiling or seemingly unharmed. The NTSB was unable to accurately chart where individual passengers were seated because Avianca only assigned <b>seats</b> <b>to</b> a few passengers and many who were assigned reported moving after takeoff.|$|E
5|$|The {{state is}} governed by a {{parliamentary}} system of representative democracy. Uttar Pradesh {{is one of the}} seven states in India, where the state legislature is bicameral, comprising two houses: the Vidhan Sabha (Legislative Assembly) and the Vidhan Parishad (Legislative Council). The Legislative Assembly consists of 404 members who are elected for five-year terms. The Legislative Council is a permanent body of 100 members with one-third (33 members) retiring every two years. Since Uttar Pradesh sends the largest number of legislators to the national Parliament, it is often considered {{to be one of the}} most important states with respect to Indian politics. The state contributes 80 <b>seats</b> <b>to</b> the lower house of the Indian Parliament, Lok Sabha and 31 <b>seats</b> <b>to</b> the upper house of the Indian Parliament, Rajya Sabha.|$|E
5|$|These trends were {{continued}} into the next election in May 2014, in which Labour gained three <b>seats</b> <b>to</b> take their total to 31, the Green Party won two more seats, the Conservative party gained one seat, and UKIP won their first-ever seat on the council. The Liberal Democrats lost a further seven seats.|$|E

25|$|Another vote in 1869 {{rejected}} {{an appeal}} to move the county <b>seat</b> <b>to</b> Eureka. A dubious recount in a third election held in November 1873 again overturned an apparent result to move the Woodford County <b>seat</b> <b>to</b> Roanoke. A fourth election in 1884, again proposing relocation to Roanoke, failed miserably. It was only in 1894 when a final election provided a decisive majority in favor of moving the county <b>seat</b> <b>to</b> Eureka that Metamora lost its status as county seat.|$|R

5|$|Besides the Conservatives' {{ties to the}} CPR, Rutherford's Liberals {{enjoyed the}} incumbent's {{advantage}} of controlling the levers of patronage, and the election's result was never really in doubt. Before the election, Talbot predicted {{that the government would}} win 18 of the province's 25 seats. Immediately after the election it appeared that the Liberals had won 21; when all the votes had been counted they had won 23 <b>seats</b> <b>to</b> the Conservatives' two. Bennett himself was defeated in his Calgary riding. When the outcome was clear, the people of Strathcona feted Rutherford with a torchlight procession and bonfire.|$|E

50|$|Sunderland North was {{the next}} to declare, {{followed}} by Houghton and Washington East, both Labour holds but with reductions in the incumbent majorities of up to 9%. The first Scottish <b>seat</b> <b>to</b> declare was Rutherglen and Hamilton West — another safe Labour seat, also a Labour hold, but with the majority reduced by 4%. The first <b>seat</b> <b>to</b> change hands was Putney, where Labour's majority of around 2,500 fell to a strong Conservative challenge, with a total swing of about 5,000 (6.2%). This {{was also the first}} <b>seat</b> <b>to</b> be declared for the Conservatives. The first Liberal Democrat <b>seat</b> <b>to</b> be declared was North East Fife, the constituency of LibDem deputy leader Sir Menzies Campbell which he had held since 1987.|$|R

5|$|Bracken {{was elected}} to the Commons in the 1945 general election, {{and for the first time}} in five years the Tories had their party leader in the House of Commons.

Diefenbaker {{increased}} his majority to over 1,000 votes, and had the satisfaction of seeing Mackenzie King defeated in Prince Albert—but by a CCF candidate. The Prime Minister was returned in an Ontario by-election within months.|$|E
5|$|By 1982, the Old Strathcona Foundation was {{confident}} {{enough in the}} theatre’s prospects to purchase the building outright from Towne Cinema. By this time, the asking price for the building had dropped to $425,000, which {{was estimated to be}} $8000 below its real market value. The Foundation began to make major upgrades and repairs to the interior of the building. A fundraising drive in 1987 allowed 422 modern sized plush <b>seats</b> <b>to</b> be installed, lowering the theatre’s original seating capacity by almost 240. In 1989, a soundproofed cry room was installed with an independent sound system, allowing patrons with small children to come to films without worry.|$|E
