40|$|The {{presence}} of highly non-linear friction damping in the suspensions of many freight vehicles reduces prediction accuracy when using traditional kinematic gauging techniques. These techniques, {{which are often}} applied to the more linear behaving passenger vehicles, {{are based on the}} quasi-static suspension behaviour.

30|$|Some {{research}} {{has been carried out}} to establish the relationship between speed and lateral (or transverse) clearance maintained by interacting vehicles. Pal and Mallikarjuna [2] collected data and evaluated the average lateral gap versus percentage area occupancy relationship in heterogeneous traffic. In a later study [3], it was found that lateral gaps maintained by vehicles vary with respect to their speeds and vehicle types. A commercial software ‘TRAZER’ which automatically collects traffic data based upon image processing of a recorded traffic stream was used in this research; however, data extracted from this software suffers from serious accuracy issues at different levels. A continuum model by Nair et al. [10] or a pore space model by Ambarwati et al.

These models do not consider vehicle speeds in developing relationships of distances <b>between</b> <b>vehicles</b> with other traffic parameters like area occupancy. Linear relationship between LC and speed was assumed in many heterogeneous simulation models, such as the HETEROSIM model developed by Arasan and Koshy [12], the CASIM model by Maurya and Chakraborty [13] and the unidirectional model by Metkari et al. [14]. Validation of these models was limited to macroscopic parameters only. Potential field model (conceived by Chakraborty et al. [15]) can also be extended for heterogeneous conditions, if different vehicle-type parameters are introduced and lateral parameters are calibrated properly.|$|R

In these cases {{it can be difficult}} for vehicles and pedestrians to share the road safely, particularly at intersections where vehicle-pedestrian conflicts (and the risk of vehicle–pedestrian crashes) can be a frequently recurring situation even with low pedestrian volume. In a sustainable safety vision road system planning and design must include engineering choices that help to improve the sharing of road <b>space</b> <b>between</b> <b>vehicles</b> and pedestrians, as well as for other vulnerable users.

40|$|A {{control scheme}} for {{emergency}} braking of vehicles is designed. The tire/road friction {{is described by}} a LuGre dynamic friction model. The control system output is the pressure in the master cylinder of the brake system. The controller utilizes estimated states for a feedback control law that achieves a near maximum deceleration. The state observer is designed using linear matrix inequality (LMI) techniques. The analysis shows that using the wheel angular speed information exclusively {{is not sufficient to}} rapidly estimate the velocity and relative velocity, {{due to the fact that}} the dynamical system is almost unobservable with this measurement as output. Findings are confirmed by simulation results that show that the estimated vehicle velocity and relative velocity converge slowly to their true values, even though the internal friction state and friction parameters converge quickly.

40|$|In Automated Highway Systems (AHS), {{vehicles}} {{are equipped with}} automatic control systems to govern the accelerating, steering and braking functions {{in order to maintain}} an appropriate speed and spacing with respect to the surrounding vehicles. One concept of AHS suggests the implementation of vehicle platoons with small <b>spacing</b> <b>between</b> <b>vehicles.</b> With vehicles moving closely together in platoons, the hazards of "chain-reaction" collisions become a concern. The benefits of small delta-V need to be weighed against the number of collisions in such feared "chain-collision" scenarios. This report discusses the effects of collisions in vehicle-following operations, especially for short-spacing scenarios. In this study, the collision analysis is conducted with a two-dimensional simulation program by which the translational and rotational movements of vehicles can be fully represented. For example, a greater delta-V of the initial collisions or a larger lateral offset between the vehicles can cause the greatest deviations from the specified path. Also presented in this report are simulation scenarios where control actions are taken in post- impact conditions. Vehicle maneuvers in these simulations include steering and braking inputs to perform lane-following and lane changing. The potential implications and the effects of these maneuvers on the vehicle trajectories are discussed. The studies of these post-impact maneuvers offer a perspective on the possible actions for vehicles in automated modes. The current and future work of this study should provide insights for the evaluation of the safety hazards and control strategies in AHS.

40|$|The {{vehicles}} in a platoon will experience transient aerodynamic forces as vehicles leave {{and join the}} platoon at various locations. A platoon of scale vehicle models is placed in a wind tunnel and measurements are made of the transient forces and moments {{as one of the}} vehicles is moved {{into and out of the}} platoon. The results from the wind tunnel experiments will allow the computer vehicle control algorithms to better predict the transient aerodynamics the {{vehicles in}} the platoon will encounter during leaving and joining maneuvers. Since a lane change (either leaving or joining a platoon) maneuver occurs on the same time scale as changes in the flow field, characterization of the transient forces and moments becomes of paramount importance. In these experiments, one vehicle is moved out of and into the platoon at six different accelerations to simulate lane changes at six different time scales, the longest (smallest acceleration) representing the static case and the shortest (largest acceleration) representing half of the nominal time of an actual lane change. Measurements are made with the displaced vehicle as each of the four members of the platoon. The increase in the drag on the remaining cars in the platoon as one vehicle leaves confirms that the close <b>spacing</b> <b>between</b> <b>vehicles</b> in a platoon results in streamlined flow. All of the cars experience side forces and yawing moments resulting from the interrupted flow field caused by the displaced car.
