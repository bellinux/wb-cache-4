40|$|The {{management}} of risk within {{a nursing home}} environment is widely viewed as an undertaking perfom 1 ed by the owners or managers of nursing homes. The residents of these homes are reliant upon the owners and managers to keep them safe, {{due in part to}} a traditional belief that they are the experts and have a greater understanding of risk. To establish risk it is first a requirement to have an understanding of levels of risk and risk management techniques. Risk appreciation is often influenced by heuristic representativeness, as well as social and cultural influences. The higher level of risk within a nursing home environment {{is due in part to}} the demographic of the residents as well as health issues experienced by elderly people.

40|$|The {{residents}} of aged care nursing homes are reliant upon {{the owners and}} managers for their safety. However, there are issues that support fire and life safety non-compliance, such as government funding of nursing homes linked with self assessed assurance. In addition, most aged nursing homes are facility managed by on-site care personnel as a secondary role, emergency agencies no longer complete scheduled audits, auditing by government funding agencies is restricted, and fire and life safety are not considered {{by the majority of}} residents or visitors. The higher level of risk within a nursing home environment is due to the demographic of the residents. Such increase in risk places a greater importance on risk mitigation systems, with fire and smoke doors being a pivotal component. The study measured fire and <b>smoke</b> <b>door</b> maintenance compliance by undertaking a statistical random audit of 160 doors in 22 nursing homes in Western Australia, demonstrating a non-compliance level of 87 % on the audited doors with a total of 935 failures identified. As a result of the study’s findings, assumptions were able to be drawn such as a lack of suitably qualified staff, a lack of industry-focused skills and knowledge, the absence of any recognised licensing regime or legislative directives and the fire industry’s inability to provide a level of self governance to supervise practitioners. The study demonstrated that despite the requirement for nursing homes to be Government accredited and audited, supported with Australian national standards, there are still high levels of non-compliance...|$|E
50|$|The risks {{inherent}} in flammable scenery and props were recognized even in 1903. Two features, a safety curtain that confines {{fire to the}} stage area and <b>smoke</b> <b>doors</b> that allow <b>smoke</b> and heat to escape through the roof above the stage, combine to increase fire safety in theaters. This arrangement creates negative pressure; the stage area becomes a chimney, and fresh, breathable air is sucked through the exit doors into the audience area.

Patrons waiting to exit will have fresh breathing air until the exit doors close. The exit doors which open out will be drawn closed tightly by this draft once they are no longer held open by evacuees. Once the doors are closed, the fire loses its oxygen source.

40|$|This report {{details the}} {{prescriptive}} and performance based analyses {{performed on the}} Orfalea College of Business building, located on the Cal Poly San Luis Obispo campus. Designed {{in accordance with the}} 1985 Uniform Building Code (UBC), this building is evaluated for compliance with the requirements prescribed under relevant codes in place as of 2016. The main function of this building is to serve both academic and administrative purposes, including classrooms and staff offices. Aspects of the building analyzed include: Egress Systems, Structural Fire Protection, Smoke Management, Fire Detection, Fire Notification, and Fire Suppression The prescriptive analysis demonstrates the lack of compliance in two general areas: egress systems and passive fire protection. Obstructions in corridors will impede egress travel, while propped open doors compromise the designed passive fire protection. The rest of the building features were deemed compliant based on the 2013 CBC. A performance based analysis was performed on the building using tenability criteria justified by relevant scientific research. Thresholds for visibility, temperature, and toxicity were considered in determining the Available Safe Egress Time (ASET). This analysis intended to evaluate the building based on Method 2 found in the 2015 Life Safety Code (LSC), where ASET must be greater than the Required Safe Egress Time (RSET). The results of the analysis revealed that both temperature and toxicity were not a concern for a fire scenario in what is deemed one of the most potentially hazardous areas in the building. Visibility, however, would drop below its minimum threshold at 300 seconds after fire ignition. The RSET was determined using justified pre-movement times and calculated egress times. The RSET proved to be 444 seconds, which is more than 2 minutes greater than the ASET. Thus, the performance criterion is not met. The building will maintain an acceptable level of protection if obstructions are removed from paths of egress and all fire and <b>smoke</b> <b>doors</b> are maintained in their proper position. The installation of sprinklers would greatly reduce the impact of a hazardous scenario, as it is nearly impossible to ensure that all doors required to be closed are closed {{due to the nature of}} the building...|$|R
50|$|Having become {{indispensable}} on branchline use, it {{was decided}} to modernise the Teho type, and in 1925-26 local engineers developed a derivative locomotive. The result was the Tehoro class, the first of which was built in July 1927 and the second in October of the same year, both at the Gyeongseong Works. These featured a single-stage compressor, and improvements included the expansion of the heat transfer area, improved power transfer and brakes, an automated <b>smoke</b> box <b>door,</b> and other improvements. The Tehoro class was designed for use on both passenger and freight trains, and was used primarily on the Gyeongui and Gyeongbu lines. The next thirteen came in 1929, five from Gyeongseong and four each from Mitsubishi and Hitachi's Kasato works; the last of these became the largest producer of Tehoro class locomotives. Another eighteen were delivered in 1937, nine each from Hitachi Kasato and Kawasaki, and in 1938, as part of Sentetsu's general renumbering, the Tehoro class locomotives in service received numbers テホロ1 through テホロ39.

The building functions are primarily administrative and academic in nature, with various lecture halls, offices, and labs located throughout the building. The Business Building was constructed in 1989 following the 1985 Uniform Building Code (UBC). For {{the purposes of this}} report, the building will be evaluated using the 2015 International Building Code, NFPA Life Safety Code Handbook (Thirteenth Edition), SFPE Handbook (4 th and 5 th Editions), and the NFPA handbooks relevant to each individual section. The prescriptive fire safety features that will be examined in the building will be divided into categories including egress analysis, fire detection, alarm and communication systems, water based fire suppression, structural fire protection, and tenability. The performance-based design of the building will be carried out with the goals outlined in the Life Safety Code (13 th edition) including ASET 3 ̆eRSET with minimal loss of life and property damage. The performance criteria of the FDS model will be based on methods 1 and 2 for performance-based design outlined in the LSC Handbook (13 th edition) The performance-based design will be carried out using Pathfinder and FDS to simulate a design fire that was selected to reflect a serious threat to the occupants in the building Following the performance based design criteria outlined in methods 1 and 2 of the LSC (13 th edition), the proposed design fire ensures that incapacitation does not occur, however visibility is lost. This satisfies method 1 of the performance based design which states that no occupant shall be incapacitated by the effects of fire for the duration required for the required safe egress time. Method 2 of the design fails because this performance goal is to ensure that the toxic gas layer does not fall below 6 feet at any point during the simulation. In order to maintain the functionality of <b>smoke</b> <b>doors</b> and barriers, doors that are not designed to be help open should be kept closed. Hallway obstructions on the third and fourth floors should be removed to ensure a clear egress route.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{establish}} the Facility Management knowledge categories within the life cycle of a building context. The significance of the study stemmed from research undertaken into the compliance to Australian Standards 1851 - 17 : 2005 Maintenance of Fire and <b>Smoke</b> <b>Doors</b> within West Australian nursing homes, which demonstrated 87 per cent non-compliance. The level of non-compliance appeared to identify a lack of knowledge, and appropriately qualified and experienced personnel involved within the management of nursing homes (Doleman, 2008). The issues identified prompted the question on how facility management knowledge categories evolves and develops throughout the life cycle of a building. The research used a three Phase, Grounded Theory interpretive analysis of the Facility Management knowledge construct. Phase One involved the examination of 21 international tertiary undergraduate Facility Managers courses. The course content was analysed and assessed through linguistic analysis to extract the knowledge categories and subordinate concepts. The findings identified 14 primary knowledge categories which were presented to 10 Facility Management experts for validation. Phase Two presented the findings of Phase One in a Multi Dimensional Scaling (MDS) survey instrument to Facility Management experts for dissimilarity assessments. The results from the 56 completed surveys were embedded within MDS software to present spatial knowledge proximity cluster analysis. The final phase was the validation of the research findings through semi-structured interviews of 10 industry experts, selected with consideration of heterogeneity in order to validate the findings of the previous phase. The outcome of this study was to develop an understanding of the Facility Management knowledge categories within the life cycle of a building context and the identification of 14 core knowledge base, required as a Facility Manager practitioner. Core knowledge categories included Finance as a central theme within the Facility Management domain with Building Services and Business providing an indication as to the broad nature of Facility Management knowledge construct. Also identified within the research was the lack of legislative harmonisation between different states and territories within the Facility Management domain and the disparity between Facility Management practitioners with regards to knowledge context and application. The role of Facility Management and their involvement within the lifecycle of a building was also identified within the research as being little or none during the design and construction phases of the building. The handover and management of the buildings to Facility Managers occurs within the occupancy phase of the buildings life cycle meaning that the building was inherited without due consideration of continued operational efficiencies or functionality affecting the overall cost effectiveness of the building. Such outcomes lead to a number of recommendations such as a the introduction of central knowledge standard in order to provide context of definitions and well as the continued development and drive of Facility Management practitioners and associations to establish the Facility Management profession as a respected body...|$|R
