In OpenBSD, the ports and base operating system are developed and released together for each version: this means that the ports or packages released with, for example, 4.6 are not suitable for use with 4.5 and vice versa.|$|E

50|$|Numerous FTN mailers like FrontDoor, D'Bridge, and BinkleyTerm were {{supported}}. Also supported were various Bulletin Board <b>System</b> <b>packages</b> like RemoteAccess, Maximus, QuickBBS, and T.A.G.

BBS users handling mail offline could also use FastEcho, as QWK and Blue Wave users did. This method was a bit more complicated but allowed the BBS user to operate much like any other FTN mail system and reap its benefits.|$|E

The operation can also be performed by using the diskutil command-line utility. In El Capitan, the user can instead use two command-line utilities: pkgutil to repair particular packages or /usr/libexec/repair_packages to repair a standard set of <b>system</b> <b>packages.</b> In both cases, the user has to disable System Integrity Protection to change permissions of system files and directories. In macOS Sierra, /usr/libexec/repair_packages is not available.|$|E

5000|$|Until {{they were}} removed from the Maemo {{operating}} system application installer in January 2010, certain advanced features were unlocked by a [...] "Red Pill Mode" [...] Easter egg to prevent accidental use by novice users but make them readily available to experienced users. This was activated by starting to add a catalog whose URL was [...] "matrix" [...] and then choosing to cancel. A dialog box would appear asking [...] "Which pill?" [...] with the choices [...] "Red" [...] or [...] "Blue", allowing the user to enter red pill mode. In [...] "Red Pill" [...] mode, the installer allows the user to view and reconfigure <b>system</b> <b>packages</b> whose existence it normally does not acknowledge. In Blue Pill mode the installer displays only software installed by a user, creating the illusion that system software does not exist on the system.|$|E
50|$|The {{third one}} is that {{installing}} DMFAS is less expensive than developing a wholly new system for reasons of cost and workability. Compared with designing, programming, and maintaining an entirely new <b>system,</b> <b>packages</b> can be relatively inexpensive. DMFAS designers {{with the help of}} users have debugged the available systems {{to the point where they}} are likely to have fewer operating problems than custom-made systems. They can be implemented quickly, and the maintenance is centralised, creating high economies of scale: the implementation of DMFAS, for instance, varies from 6 months to 3 years, in order to cover the full database depending on its complexity; this is fast compared to an in-house development. The maintenance of a system is of vital importance; it has been proven that the personnel turnover in the IT Department—which is an observed characteristic of a developing country DMO as pointed out above—makes domestically developed systems very vulnerable. Choosing a standard software package like DMFAS also decreases the need to maintain a full group of developers within the DMO’s IT department, there are only needs for maintenance and service for daily work, database management, and security procedures like regular backups.|$|E
50|$|HIS {{developments}} {{began to}} accelerate {{since the early}} 1990s. All level of health administrations, hospitals and some information development companies invested huge personnel and money into HIS developing. Especially in developed regions such as Beijing, Shanghai, Guangdong, Shandong, Jiangsu, the HIS achieved success and have larger scale. Yet the reasons those without plans {{as a whole and}} control for HIS by the related health administrations, without standards to comply with and without surveillance by some related administrations leadto non-normative HIS developing processes. These are two poor results. The first one is that HIS were developed free, the software had no standards, the developed platform therefore varied. The second problem is that the HIS develop companies were in different levels, and many of them didn’t specialize in HIS develop, they were not familiar with the style of hospital management and workflows, or they only knew some specific hospitals. Furthermore, some companies have the idea of eager for quick success and instant benefit, and only considered the current benefits without long term investment. Some companies even thought that HIS market had potential, so they made some simple <b>system</b> <b>packages</b> together, and took some measures to deceive the users. All above brought severe negative influence to HIS development.|$|E
