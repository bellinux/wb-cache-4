The co-movements can affect the balancing strategies of country market portfolios as they indicate opportunities and risks. The strategic choice of alternative market presence, such as market entry via export marketing or a full ownership and marketing may need to match with the type of financial resources. The co-movements of and the linkages between the U. S. <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> and Asian <b>stock</b> <b>markets</b> <b>have</b> been studied extensively. However, little attention has been given to the co-movements of Asian <b>stock</b> <b>markets</b> and the lead/lag linkages between them. In this paper, we study this issue with the principal components analysis (PCA) and Granger-causality (G-C) statistical techniques. We find that the contemporaneous co-movements of Asian <b>stock</b> <b>markets</b> <b>have</b> become closer and portfolio diversification benefits with Asian <b>stock</b> <b>markets</b> <b>have</b> diminished over time during the January 1, 2001 -January 1, 2011 period.

We divide this 10 -year period into two consecutive 5 -year periods and we apply principal components analysis to each sub-period separately. We find seven statistically significant principal components for the 2001 - 2005 period and only three statistically significant principal components for the 2006 - 2010 period.
