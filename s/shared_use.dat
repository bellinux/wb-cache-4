5|$|In 1997, {{the airport}} {{introduced}} Common Use Terminal Equipment (CUTE), {{becoming the first}} airport {{in the country to}} do so. With multiple airlines serving McCarran, it became inefficient to have separate facilities for each airline. CUTE allows for <b>shared</b> <b>use</b> of ticket counters and gates; an airline can overflow to inactive facilities during peak times.|$|E
5|$|Opposite the Kenilworth Stand is the Oak Road End, which bears an {{electronic}} scoreboard on its roof and can seat {{a maximum of}} 1,800 fans. Originally a home section, the Oak Road End {{was turned into a}} stand for away fans only {{at the start of the}} 1991–92 season. Early in the 2013–14 season, the Oak Road End was re-opened for home supporters for fixtures where visiting support was predicted to be especially low, with the section for away fans moved to A Block of the Kenilworth Stand for these games. Later that season, it was announced that the stand was available for <b>shared</b> <b>use</b> between both home and away supporters, increasing Kenilworth Road's home capacity by 15%. The Oak Road End has an entrance that is often considered unusual, requiring spectators to go through an entrance built into the row of houses and up stairs to the stand.|$|E
5|$|After Watkin's {{retirement}} from management, {{relations between the}} MR and GCR deteriorated rapidly over <b>shared</b> <b>use</b> of Baker Street station and the congested route into London, and soon broke down completely. On 30 July 1898 John Bell, General Manager of the Metropolitan Railway, {{took control of the}} Quainton Road signal box himself and refused to allow a GCR train onto MR-owned tracks {{on the grounds that it}} was scheduled to take the Great Western rather than the Metropolitan route south of Aylesbury, while on one occasion in 1901 King Edward VII was travelling home after visiting a friend in Wendover; the MR signalman allowed a slow goods train to run in front of the royal train, causing the King to arrive late back in London. The MR management also refused the GCR permission to install points to connect their engine shed at Aylesbury to the railway line, on the grounds that the land for the shed had been bought clandestinely. Eventually a parallel set of tracks was built for the GCR between Harrow and London, running alongside the MR to a separate terminus at Marylebone, a short distance from Baker Street. The GCR continued to share the less-congested section between Quainton Road and Harrow—including Chalfont Road station—with the MR.|$|E

25|$|There {{have been}} a lot of studies on the safety of all types of bikeways.

Opponents point out the increased risk from various types of infrastructure including <b>shared</b> <b>use</b> paths.|$|E
25|$|Some bikeways are {{separated}} from motor traffic by physical constraints (e.g. barriers, parking or bollards)—bicycle trail, cycle track—but others are partially separated only by painted markings—bike lane, buffered bike lane, and contraflow bike lane.

25|$|The Lawrance A-3 or Lawrance Model A was an American {{twin-cylinder}} aircraft piston engine.

40|$|This paper {{indicates}} {{that there is an}} inverse relationship between collateralised shares and firm performance. We further show that this inverse relationship exists only in conglomerate firms. These findings imply that agency problems resulting from <b>shares</b> <b>used</b> as collateral by boards of directors are more serious in conglomerate firms than in non-conglomerate firms. Moreover, we provide evidence that monitoring by institutional investors, creditors and dividend policy can effectively reduce the agency problems of <b>shares</b> <b>used</b> as collateral and thus can improve firm performance.

25|$|Despite city {{funding and}} some private support, the library had {{suffered}} from reduced funding from external sources, including {{the federal government}} and Local Government Aid (LGA) from the State of Minnesota. In the recession of the 2000s following the Dot-com bubble, hours were drastically cut and money for acquisitions sharply declined.
