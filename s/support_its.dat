5|$|An avid golfer {{and tennis}} player, Graham partnered with New York Yankees great Joe DiMaggio in {{numerous}} golf tournaments later in life. He retired {{to a house}} {{on a golf course}} in Florida. Graham overcame colon cancer in 1977, but was later plagued by heart ailments and other health problems. He was diagnosed as being {{in the early stages of}} Alzheimer's disease in 2001, and died of a heart aneurysm in Sarasota, Florida, on December 17, 2003. He had two sons and a daughter with his wife Beverly. In 2013, Northwestern's fundraising department created The Otto Graham Society to honor his achievements at the school and <b>support</b> <b>its</b> athletics programs. In 2014, a new gymnasium at Waterford Country School was dedicated to Otto Graham's memory.|$|E

The NVA 130mm and 152mm artillery pieces, and 122mm rockets, had a longer range than the Marine artillery support which consisted of 105mm and 155mm howitzers. This range overmatch was used by the North Vietnamese to avoid counter-battery fire. They were assisted in their emplacement efforts by the continuing bad weather of the winter monsoon.|$|E

To man the Albanian battlefront, the Greek command was forced to withdraw forces from Eastern Macedonia and Western Thrace, because Greek forces could not protect Greece's entire border. The Greek command decided to <b>support</b> <b>its</b> success in Albania, regardless of the risk of a German attack from the Bulgarian border.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Dean {{emerged into}} the Bay of Campeche as a Category1 {{hurricane}} {{on the afternoon}} of August21. Its inner core was largely disrupted, so although a ragged eye reformed over the warm waters of the bay, the hurricane no longer had the structure to <b>support</b> <b>its</b> previous strength. Nevertheless, the warm waters of the bay proved conducive for some development and the eye contracted overnight, indicating that the hurricane was regaining structure. With better structure came stronger winds of 100mph (160km/h), and the storm was re-categorized as a Category2 hurricane.|$|E
5|$|In 1619, King James I {{decreed that}} the American colonists of Jamestown {{would need to}} step up efforts to do their fair share towards {{supporting}} England. The Virginia Company enacted the decree, asking Jamestown's land owners to grow and export 100 hemp plants to help support England's cause. Later the colonists would grow it to <b>support</b> <b>its</b> expansion in the Americas. George Washington grew hemp at Mount Vernon {{as one of his}} three primary crops. The use of hemp for rope and fabric later became ubiquitous throughout the 18th and 19th centuries in the United States. Medicinal preparations of cannabis became available in American pharmacies in the 1850s following an introduction to its use in Western medicine by William O'Shaughnessy a decade earlier in 1839.|$|E
5|$|KC-33A – A {{proposed}} 747 {{was also}} adapted as an aerial refueling tanker and was bid against the DC-10-30 during the 1970s Advanced Cargo Transport Aircraft (ACTA) program {{that produced the}} KC-10A Extender. Before the 1979 Iranian Revolution, Iran bought four 747-100 aircraft with air-refueling boom conversions to <b>support</b> <b>its</b> fleet of F-4 Phantoms. There is a report of using a KC-33A in H-3 airstrike during Iran–Iraq War. It is unknown whether these aircraft remain usable as tankers. Since then, other proposals have emerged for conversion of later 747-400 aircraft for this role.|$|E
