40|$|Soil erosion {{is one of}} the {{important}} causes of land degradation. Many <b>soil</b> <b>and</b> water conservation practices have been implemented in order to decrease <b>soil</b> erosion <b>and</b> prevent land degradation for a long period in Yanhe River Basin which is characteristic of serious soil erosion for concentrated rainfall, erodible <b>soil</b> <b>and</b> hilly <b>and</b> gully terrain. <b>Soil</b> <b>and</b> water conservation practices cannot only reduce <b>soil</b> <b>and</b> water loss but also change the situation of the land surface and influence the structure and functions of the eco-system. This study tried to quantitatively assess influence on ecosystem service caused by <b>soil</b> <b>and</b> water conservation with the index of ecosystem service value. Ecosystem service value was calculated using the data of precipitation, <b>soil,</b> terrain <b>and</b> <b>soil</b> <b>and</b> water conservation practice with the guidance of the theory of <b>soil</b> <b>and</b> water conservation science and science of ecological economics based on GIS. For the study area the ecological service value of eco-system was 13. 693 billion and 24. 464 billion RMB, respectively, in 1997 and 2006 in the initial state of <b>soil</b> <b>and</b> water conservation and 14. 264 and 25. 620 billion RMB in the end state.

5|$|B. pendula is {{distinguished}} from the related downy birch (B. pubescens, the other common European birch) in having hairless, warty shoots (hairy and without warts in downy birch), more triangular leaves with double serration on the margins (more ovoid and with single serrations in downy birch), and whiter bark often with scattered black fissures (greyer, less fissured, in downy birch). It is also distinguished cytologically, silver birch being diploid (with two sets of chromosomes), whereas downy birch is tetraploid (four sets of chromosomes). Hybrids between the two are known, but are very rare, and being triploid, are sterile. The two have differences in habitat requirements, with silver birch found mainly on dry, sandy <b>soils,</b> <b>and</b> downy birch more common on wet, poorly drained sites such as clay <b>soils</b> <b>and</b> peat bogs. Silver birch also demands slightly more summer warmth than does downy birch, which is significant in the cooler parts of Europe. Many North American texts treat the two species as conspecific (and cause confusion by combining the downy birch's alternative vernacular name 'white birch', with the scientific name B. pendula of the other species), but they are regarded as distinct species throughout Europe.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) {{models are}} {{sensitive}} to predictions of <b>soil</b> moisture <b>and</b> evapotranspiration at the land surface. This paper compares simulations of the stand-alone VB 95 land surface model with various <b>soil</b> <b>and</b> vegetation parameter sets against <b>soil</b> moisture <b>and</b> <b>soil</b> temperature observations across the Murrumbidgee River catchment. The {{results indicate that the}} simulations {{are sensitive to}} the <b>soil</b> <b>and</b> vegetation parameters. In general, VB 95 can model the temporal fluctuation in <b>soil</b> moisture, <b>and</b> therefore the moisture fluxes, realistically. However, the model exhibits a significant bias in the absolute <b>soil</b> moisture <b>and</b> <b>soil</b> temperature, highlighting the need to improve the model formulation or our estimates of <b>soil</b> <b>and</b> vegetation properties for modelling applications...|$|R

5|$|Hardy and versatile, B.integrifolia {{will grow}} in clay, sand, acid and even {{alkaline}} <b>soils,</b> <b>and</b> it shows good resistance to wind and salt, making it suitable for seaside planting. It is therefore highly {{regarded as a}} low-maintenance garden tree, although its large size makes it unsuitable for smaller gardens. Its hardiness may however forewarn weed potential, as some evidence of weediness has been seen in Western Australia and New Zealand. When growing near bushland within its native habitat, it is recommended to obtain local provenance seed or plants if available.|$|E
5|$|Lambertia formosa {{is readily}} grown in {{cultivation}} given a sunny position and fair drainage, though it tolerates {{a range of}} <b>soils</b> <b>and</b> some shade.

Seeds germinate within 25 to 60 days of sowing, and firm young growth makes the best cutting material for propagation. Fertilisers generally are not needed, but slow release low-phosphorus fertilisers are tolerated. The species is frost-hardy and grows in temperate to subtropical climates.|$|E

40|$|AbstractConstruction {{in urban}} areas implies use of {{construction}} materials from quarries <b>and</b> excavation of <b>soil</b> <b>and</b> rock. From a resource perspective, there could be benefits from using excavated <b>soil</b> <b>and</b> rock as a construction material. The aim {{of this paper is}} to describe the material flow and management practices of urban excavated <b>soil</b> <b>and</b> rock from the perspective of resource efficiency. A conceptual model for the urban flow of excavated <b>soil</b> <b>and</b> rock was developed and a literature review concerning the management of excavated <b>soil</b> <b>and</b> rock was conducted. The conceptual model was subsequently used to clarify the different perspectives of the scientific literature and knowledge gaps. Conclusions drawn are that there is little knowledge about the quantities and the fate of excavated <b>soil</b> <b>and</b> rock {{in urban areas}}. Current research is focusing on the waste flows of construction material and little is known about the overall management practices of excavated <b>soil</b> <b>and</b> rock. Clearly, excavated <b>soil</b> <b>and</b> rock are often disposed at landfills and the recycling rate for high quality purposes is low. There is a need to evaluate the potential for an increased use of excavated <b>soil</b> <b>and</b> rock as construction material. However, the overall efficiency of urban construction material management can only be evaluated and improved by also including construction materials produced in quarries...|$|R

5|$|Sundews {{generally}} grow in seasonally moist or {{more rarely}} constantly wet habitats with acidic <b>soils</b> <b>and</b> {{high levels of}} sunlight. Common habitats include bogs, fens, swamps, marshes, the tepuis of Venezuela, the wallums of coastal Australia, the fynbos of South Africa, and moist streambanks. Many species grow in association with sphagnum moss, which absorbs much of the soil's nutrient supply and also acidifies the soil, making nutrients less available to plant life. This allows sundews, which do not rely on soil-bound nutrients, to flourish where more dominating vegetation would usually outcompete them.|$|E
