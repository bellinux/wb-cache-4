40|$|<b>System</b> <b>call</b> {{monitoring}} is {{a technique}} for detecting and controlling compromised applications by checking at runtime that each <b>system</b> <b>call</b> conforms to a policy that specifies the program’s normal behavior. Here, {{a new approach to}} <b>system</b> <b>call</b> monitoring based on authenticated <b>system</b> <b>calls</b> is introduced. An authenticated <b>system</b> <b>call</b> is a <b>system</b> <b>call</b> augmented with extra arguments that specify the policy for that call and a cryptographic message authentication code (MAC) that guarantees the integrity of the policy and the <b>system</b> <b>call</b> arguments. This extra information is used by the kernel to verify the <b>system</b> <b>call.</b> The version of the application in which regular <b>system</b> <b>calls</b> have been replaced by authenticated calls is generated automatically by an installer program that reads the application binary, uses static analysis to generate policies, and then rewrites the binary with the authenticated calls.

30|$|Since the <b>system</b> <b>calls</b> of malware {{variants}} {{which are}} in the same families share similar distributions, and there exist a significant difference of the distributions between malware and benign (Jang et al. 2015), some <b>system</b> <b>calls</b> are used more often in malware variants. We propose to extract a series of sensitive <b>system</b> <b>calls,</b> embed their frequencies into a vector and adopt deep learning method to solve these problems. Some recent researches also used deep learning for vulnerability or malware detection, which achieve better accuracy, such as (Li et al. 2018; Kolosnjaji et al. 2016), etc. We first extract a series of <b>system</b> <b>calls</b> which is more sensitive to malicious behaviours based information entropy theory. We <b>call</b> these <b>system</b> <b>calls</b> as sensitive <b>system</b> <b>calls</b> which reduce a degree of obfuscation. Then we embed the <b>system</b> <b>calls</b> to a vector by using occurrence frequency. The sensitive <b>system</b> <b>calls</b> will later be sent to a neural network for training or classification. Next we prefer to use multi-layers neural networks to train a model. Finally we use the model to detect and classify malware variants.|$|R
