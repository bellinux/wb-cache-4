25|$|Publix is {{organized}} into departments grouped based on similar skills, expertise, work activities, and resource use, such as human resources, marketing, public affairs, manufacturing, and distribution. All the departments have <b>specific</b> <b>resources</b> that help it reach the organizational task, and each department only deals with their specific area and problems. Stores {{are made up}} of seven departments (Customer Service, Grocery, Meat, Produce, Deli, Bakery, Pharmacy) and are run by a department manager or assistant manager of that department. All departments are overseen by a Store Manager and Assistant Store Manager. When both of these managers are absent, operations are left to a Manager in Charge, typically a department manager or assistant department manager from Customer Service or Grocery.|$|E
25|$|As theorists such as Ronald Coase {{have pointed}} out, all {{business}} organizations represent {{an attempt to}} avoid certain costs associated with doing business. Each is meant to facilitate the contribution of <b>specific</b> <b>resources</b> - investment capital, knowledge, relationships, and so forth - towards a venture which will prove profitable to all contributors. Except for the partnership, all business forms are designed to provide limited liability to both {{members of the organization}} and external investors. Business organizations originated with agency law, which permits an agent to act on behalf of a principal, in exchange for the principal assuming equal liability for the wrongful acts committed by the agent. For this reason, all partners in a typical general partnership may be held liable for the wrongs committed by one partner. Those forms that provide limited liability are able to do so because the state provides a mechanism by which businesses that follow certain guidelines will be able to escape the full liability imposed under agency law. The state provides these forms because it has an interest in the strength of the companies that provide jobs and services therein, but also has an interest in monitoring and regulating their behavior.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the era of}} European imperialism, {{periphery}} {{countries were}} often set up as specialized producers of <b>specific</b> <b>resources.</b> Although these specializations brought the periphery countries temporary economic benefit, the overall effect inhibited the industrial development of periphery territories.

30|$|Figure  1 shows {{a case of}} {{a failure}} {{situation}} where the adaptive mechanism must be engaged. To start executing his task, User 4 needs to acquire a <b>specific</b> <b>resource</b> provided by a specific provider (for example: a spare part provider of a specific motors company, a specific software provider…etc.). This provider exists in our cloud federation but User 4 makes his request to Broker “C”. The problem is that Broker “C” cannot provide this <b>specific</b> <b>resource</b> to User 4 because he has no contact with the specific provider who can allocate the needed resource. In such case, the Broker organization must be capable of self-reorganizing and adapting its behavior to solve the failure situation. Therefore, the self-organization mechanism is automatically started by Broker “C” and starts the multi criterion process of choosing the neighbor destination. After that, the <b>specific</b> <b>resource</b> request migrates from Broker “C” to Broker “A” who {{is in a position to}} satisfy directly the <b>specific</b> <b>resource</b> request of User 4.|$|R

2500|$|Dietary {{segregation}} is the second-most {{common type}} of resource partitioning. [...] High degrees of morphological specializations or behavioral differences allow organisms to use <b>specific</b> <b>resources.</b> [...] The size of nets built by some species of invertebrate suspension feeders, for example, can filter varying particle size of FPOM from the water (Edington et al. 1984). [...] Similarly, members in the grazing guild can specialize in the harvesting of algae or detritus depending upon the morphology of their scraping apparatus. [...] In addition, certain species seem to show a preference for specific algal species.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{question}} as to whether defense is a public good. Murray Rothbard argues, [...] "'national defense' is surely not an absolute good with only one unit of supply. It consists of <b>specific</b> <b>resources</b> committed in certain definite and concrete ways—and these resources are necessarily scarce. A ring of defense bases around New York, for example, cuts down the amount possibly available around San Francisco." [...] Jeffrey Rogers Hummel and Don Lavoie note, [...] "Americans in Alaska and Hawaii could very easily be excluded from the U.S. government's defense perimeter, and doing so might enhance the military value of at least conventional U.S. forces to Americans in the other forty-eight states. But, in general, an additional ICBM in the U.S. arsenal can simultaneously protect everyone within the country without diminishing its services".|$|E
2500|$|Aché foragers in the pre-contact period {{lived in}} small bands ranging from 3-4 {{families}} {{to a couple}} dozen families (median band size is approximately 50 individuals). [...] But these residential units often subdivided {{for a few days}}, and occasionally coalesced into large gatherings, thus the composition of reported bands in systematic interviews ranges from 3 to 160 individuals. During club-fighting rituals, three or four bands might unite, resulting in temporary camps of 200 or more individuals that might camp together for 5–15 days before dispersal. More frequently bands of many families would break up into temporary task groups that would leave children and older band members in a permanent camp, while younger adults traveled to distant areas for a few days in search of <b>specific</b> <b>resources</b> that were depleted nearby. On such forays, successful task groups would return to the main camp laden with smoked meat and other goodies.|$|E
