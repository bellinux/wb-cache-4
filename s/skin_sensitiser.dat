40|$|This is the 64 th Report of {{a series}} of workshopsorganised by the European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods (ECVAM). The main {{objective}} of ECVAM, as defined in 1993 by its Scientific Advisory Committee (ESAC), is to promote the scientific and regulatory acceptance of alternative methods, which have scientific relevance and which reduce, refine or replace the use of laboratory animals. One of the first priorities set by ECVAM was the implementation of procedures that would enable it to become well informed about the state-of-the-art of non-animal test development and validation, and the opportunities for the possible incorporation of alternative methods into regulatory procedures. It was decided that this would be best achieved through a programme of ECVAM workshops, each addressing a specific topic, at which selected groups of independent international experts would review the current status of various types of in vitro tests and their potential uses, and make recommendations about the best way forward. A workshop on Chemical Reactivity Measurement and the Predictive Identification of <b>Skin</b> <b>Sensitisers</b> was held at ECVAM on 23 ¿ 25 May 2007, under the chairmanship of Frank Gerberick. The workshop was attended by experts from academia, national organisations, and industries. The aim of the workshop was to review the state-of-the-art of methods for the identification of <b>skin</b> <b>sensitisers</b> based on measurements of chemical reactivity. Furthermore, consideration was given as to how such methods could contribute to integrated testing strategies for the eventual replacement of in vivo testing. A number of recommendations listed {{at the end of the}} report are intended to promote the progress of relevant and reliable methods toward prevalidation and validation. JRC.

40|$|Vitamin K {{describes}} {{a group of}} lipophilic vitamins that exist naturally in two forms: vitamin K 1 (phylloquinone, found in green plants) and vitamin K 2 (a group of menaquinones synthesised by bacteria in the intestine). Vitamin K 3 (or menadione) is a synthetic form of vitamin K without a side chain. To become active, menadione needs to undergo prenylation. Vitamins K 1, K 2 and K 3 are metabolically activated in the liver to become co-factors in the activation of vitamin K-dependent proteins, which are important for normal blood coagulation, and normality of bones and arteries (Gla proteins). Acute toxicity of menadione or its derivatives is reached at levels exceeding the requirements {{by a factor of}} at least 1   000. Menadione sodium bisulphite (MSB) and menadione nicotinamide bisulphite (MNB) are safe for all animal species at practical use levels in feed. The use of MSB in water for drinking is likely to increase the exposure of target animals to chromium(VI). Therefore, the FEEDAP Panel has concerns about the safety of MSB when administered by this route. The use of MSB and MNB in animal nutrition does not give rise to safety concerns for consumers. MSB is an eye irritant; in the absence of adequate data, the additive should be considered as a <b>skin</b> <b>sensitiser.</b> In the absence of data, MNB should be considered as irritant to skin and eyes and as a <b>skin</b> <b>sensitiser.</b> Considering the high dusting potential of MSB and MNB, the absence of data on inhalation toxicity and the chromium(VI) content of dust, inhalation exposure resulting from handling of MSB and MNB could be hazardous. The use of MSB and MNB in animal nutrition does not pose a risk to the environment. MSB and MNB are regarded as effective sources of vitamin K in animal nutrition...|$|E
40|$|The current opinion {{concerns}} {{only one}} of the compounds belonging to chemical group 29, 3 -acetyl- 2, 5 -dimethylthiophene. 3 -Acetyl- 2, 5 -dimethylthiophene is genotoxic in vitro and in vivo. The FEEDAP Panel considers 3 -acetyl- 2, 5 -dimethylthiophene to be not safe when used as a feed flavouring for all animal species. The FEEDAP Panel concludes that 3 -acetyl- 2, 5 -dimethylthiophene is mutagenic and therefore is considered not safe for the target species and for the consumer of animal products. In the absence of data, the FEEDAP Panel considered it prudent to treat this compound under assessment as an irritant to the skin and eyes, as a <b>skin</b> <b>sensitiser</b> and as hazardous by inhalation. The FEEDAP Panel concludes that 3 -acetyl- 2, 5 -dimethylthiophene is mutagenic and therefore any exposure is considered not safe for the user. The FEEDAP Panel considers that the application of 3 -acetyl- 2, 5 -dimethylthiophene at 0. 05  mg/kg feed for all species does not pose a risk for the environment. Since this compound is used in food as flavouring, and its function in feed is essentially the same as that in food, no further demonstration of efficacy is necessary...|$|E
40|$|Zinc oxide {{is a safe}} {{source of}} zinc for all animal species and no {{concerns}} for consumer safety are expected {{from the use of}} zinc oxide in animal nutrition, considering the maximum contents for total zinc in feedingstuffs set by EU legislation. Zinc oxide is not an irritant to skin and eyes; it is not a <b>skin</b> <b>sensitiser.</b> The zinc oxide under application is considered a compound with high dusting potential, which may result in a critical exposure of users by inhalation, affecting the respiratory system. The authorised use of zinc oxide as a feed additive does not pose a direct concern for the agricultural soil compartment. However, there is a potential environmental concern related to groundwater, drainage and the run-off of zinc to surface water. Acid sandy soils are most vulnerable to these processes. In order to draw a final conclusion, some further refinement to the assessment of zinc-based feed additives in livestock needs to be considered, for which additional data would be required. The use of zinc-containing additives in aquaculture up to maximum authorised zinc level in feeds is not expected to pose an appreciable risk to the environment. Zinc oxide is efficacious in meeting animal zinc requirements...|$|E
40|$|Refi nery {{workers are}} exposed to many metals, {{including}} cobalt and nickel, {{both of which are}} <b>skin</b> <b>sensitisers,</b> causing allergic contact dermatitis. Dermal exposure, and changes in skin barrier function [skin hydration, transepidermal water loss (TEWL) and skin surface pH] from start to end of shift, of base metal refi nery workers co-exposed to cobalt and nickel, were assessed. Changes in SH were inconsistent, while TEWL generally increased and SS-pH decreased. The decrease in SS-pH is most likely due to direct skin contact with sulphuric acid. Dermal exposure was variable even though workers wore personal protective gloves, highlighting the limitations of personal protective clothing in controlling exposure. None of the workers presented with allergic contact dermatitis (ACD). The small sample size of this study limits the interpretation of the absence of ACD, but the healthy worker effect and ethnic differences in skin structure and function may be contributing factors.

40|$|Glycine betaine (betaine) {{acts as a}} methyl group donor in transmethylation {{reactions}} in organisms. Betaine occurs in numerous vertebrate tissues as an osmolyte, ensuring osmoprotection. Betaine is safe for piglets at the maximum supplementation rate of 2 000 mg/kg complete feed with a margin of safety below 5. This conclusion is extended to all pigs and extrapolated to all animal species and categories. The use of betaine anhydrous and betaine hydrochloride as feed additives up to a supplementation rate of 2 000 mg betaine/kg complete feed is unlikely to pose concerns for consumer safety. In the absence of data, betaine anhydrous and betaine hydrochloride should be considered hazardous by inhalation, as irritant to skin, eyes and mucous membranes, and <b>skin</b> <b>sensitisers.</b> The supplementation of feed with betaine anhydrous and betaine hydrochloride does not pose a risk to the environment. Betaine {{has the potential to}} become efficacious in all animal species and categories when administered via feed or water for drinking. Betaine anhydrous and betaine hydrochloride are considered as nutritionally equivalent sources of betaine. The FEEDAP Panel made some recommendations on (i) introduction of a maximum content for supplemental betaine in complete feed and water for drinking; (ii) avoidance of simultaneous use of betaine in feed and water for drinking; (iii) avoidance of simultaneous inclusion of betaine and choline chloride in premixtures; and (iv) protection of users when handling the additives...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of non-animal testing methods {{for the assessment}} of skin sensitisation potential is an urgent challenge within the framework of existing and forthcoming legislation. Efforts have been made to replace current animal tests, but so far no alternative methods have been developed. It is widely recognised that alternatives to animal testing cannot be accomplished with a single approach, but rather will require the integration of results obtained from different in vitro and in silico assays. The argument subjacent to the {{development of}} in vitro dendritic cell (DC) -based assays is that sensitiser-induced changes in the DC phenotype can be differentiated from those induced by irritants. This assumption is derived from the unique capacity of DC to convert environmental signals encountered at the skin into a receptor expression pattern (MHC class II molecules, co-stimulatory molecules, chemokine receptors) and a soluble mediator release profile that will stimulate T lymphocytes. Since signal transduction cascades precede changes in surface marker expression and cytokine/chemokine secretion, these phenotypic modifications are a consequence of a signal transduction profile that is specifically triggered by sensitisers and not by irritants. A limited number of studies have addressed this subject and the present review attempts to summarise and highlight all of the signalling pathways modulated by <b>skin</b> <b>sensitisers</b> and irritants. Furthermore, we conclude this review by focusing on the most promising strategies suitable for inclusion into a cell-based in vitro alternative approach to hazard identification...|$|R

It is produced by a genetically modified strain of Escherichia coli. Neither the production strain nor its recombinant DNA was detectable in the final product. The final product does not raise safety concerns {{with regard to the}} genetic modification. l-Threonine, technically pure, is considered safe for the target animals when used to meet the requirements. The toxicological studies, including mutagenicity tests, performed with the additive or other sources of l-threonine did not reveal any toxic effect. Since the composition of tissues and products of animal origin will not be changed by the use of l-threonine in animal nutrition, and considering the high purity of the product under assessment, no risks are expected for the consumer from the use of l-threonine, technically pure, as a feed additive. The product is not irritating to the skin or eyes and {{is not likely to be}} a <b>skin</b> <b>sensitiser.</b> Although there is a potential for user exposure by inhalation, there is no evidence of acute toxicity by the inhalation route. The use of the product as a feed additive does not represent a risk to the environment. l-Threonine, technically pure, is considered as an efficacious source of threonine for all animal species.

40|$|Potassium sorbate is {{intended}} {{to be used as a}} technological additive to improve the ensiling process in the range of 90 to 300  mg/kg fresh material. The application of potassium sorbate in the preparation of silage up to the maximum proposed dose of 300  mg/kg forage is safe for the target animals. The additive, when used in silage, is not expected to increase substantially consumer exposure to potassium sorbate. Therefore, the FEEDAP Panel concludes that potassium sorbate, when used as a silage additive, is safe for consumers of food products from animals fed treated silage. Potassium sorbate is a skin and eye irritant and a potential irritant to the respiratory tract. Potassium sorbate is not regarded as a <b>skin</b> <b>sensitiser.</b> The dusting potential of the preparation tested indicates that exposure of users via inhalation is possible. In view of the irritancy of potassium sorbate and the absence of information on its inhalation toxicity, exposure to such dust is considered hazardous. There are no safety concerns for the environment resulting from the use of potassium sorbate as a silage additive. Seven laboratory-scale ensiling studies were reported, each lasting at least 90 days and using forages of different origins. Once silos were opened, aerobic stability was determined. Potassium sorbate has the potential to improve aerobic stability of silage with dry matter content between 21 and 38 % when used at the minimum concentration of 90  mg/kg fresh material...|$|E
40|$|Quinoline Yellow {{is applied}} as a {{colourant}} to add colour to feedingstuffs for non food-producing animals at the maximum dose of 500 mg/kg feed. In {{the absence of}} specific data, the safe feed concentration for non food-producing animals could be derived from an established no observed adverse effect level of a chronic rat study applying a safety factor of 100. The resulting maximum safe concentration was calculated for dogs and cats and was extrapolated to other non food-producing animals. The maximum safe concentration was 25 mg Quinoline Yellow/kg complete feed for all non food-producing animals. Since no information regarding dusting potential was available, it would be prudent to regard both the powder and the granulated forms as hazardous if inhaled. In the absence of data on irritancy and sensitisation, {{it would also be}} prudent to treat Quinoline Yellow as an irritant and <b>skin</b> <b>sensitiser.</b> Although, in principle, no efficacy data would be required for authorised food additives, if the intended effect in feed is the same as in food, evidence of an effect in feed is needed considering the variety of feed materials and the low safe level for target animals (25 mg/kg). In the absence of any information, the efficacy of Quinoline Yellow, with respect to the dose {{and the nature of the}} feedingstuffs and their processing, could not be assessed. The derived maximum safe concentration in complete feedingstuffs (25 mg/kg) was recommended as a maximum content of Quinoline Yellow...|$|E
40|$|Copper chelate of L-lysinate-HCl, {{provided}} as powder and as granulate, {{is intended for}} use as a copper source in animal nutrition. Tolerance studies with chicken for fattening and weaned piglets, allowed the FEEDAP Panel to conclude that copper chelate of L-lysinate-HCl is a safe source of copper for all animal species, provided that the maximum copper contents authorised in feed are respected. The supplementation of feeds with copper from copper chelate of L-lysinate-HCl up to the maximum authorised copper levels is not expected to result in a different copper deposition in edible tissues/products than the standard inorganic source cupric sulphate pentahydrate. No concerns for consumer safety will arise from the use of the additive in animal nutrition, provided that the maximum copper contents authorised in feed are respected. The powder form of copper chelate of L-lysinate-HCl should be considered as a risk by inhalation; exposure by inhalation should be minimised. Neither form of the additive is a dermal irritant but the powder form is an eye irritant. In the absence of data, it is considered prudent to regard both forms as potential <b>skin</b> <b>sensitisers.</b> Copper chelate of L-lysinate-HCl is intended to be a substitute for other authorised copper additives; it will therefore not further increase the environmental burden from copper. Copper chelate of L-lysinate-HCl is an efficacious source of copper in meeting animal requirements. The Panel made some recommendations regarding the Description and Conditions of use of the additive and the maximum residue limits established for copper in animal tissues and products...|$|R
40|$|Three {{strains of}} Pediococcus pentosaceus are each {{intended}} {{to improve the}} ensiling process at a dose of 1 x 108 CFU/kg fresh matter. This speciesis considered by EFSA to be suitable for the {{qualified presumption of safety}} approach to safety assessment. As the identity of the strains has been established and as no resistance to antibiotics of human and veterinary clinical significance was detected, the use of the strains in the production of silage is presumed safe for livestock species, consumers of products from animals fed the treated silage and for the environment. In the absence of evidence, these additives should be regarded as skin and eye irritants and potential <b>skin</b> <b>sensitisers.</b> Given the proteinaceous nature of the active agents, the FEEDAP Panel considers it prudent to treat these additives as respiratory sensitisers. Given the high dusting potential of the preparations tested, there is the need to take measures to minimise inhalation exposure of workers. Eight studies with laboratory-scale silos were conducted with P. pentosaceus applied at 1 x 108 CFU/kg forage. In all the studies, which lasted for at least 90 days, the effects of adding the additive to forage were compared to untreated control materials. All three strains of P. pentosaceus have the potential to improve the production of silage by reducing the pH and increasing lactic acid concentration, resulting in an increased preservation of dry matter. There was also evidence of a significant reduction in protein breakdown as shown by the change in the ratio of ammonia/total N. This was shown in easy and moderately difficult to ensile forage materials with a dry matter content ranging between 20 and 33 %...|$|R
40|$|Chemical group 16 {{consists}} of aliphatic and alicyclic ethers, of which four are currently authorised {{for use as}} flavours in food. The FEEDAP Panel was unable to perform an assessment of 1, 5, 5, 9 -tetramethyl- 13 -oxatricyclo[8. 3. 0. 0. (4. 9) ]tridecane and theaspirane because of {{issues related to the}} purity of the compounds. The FEEDAP Panel concludes that: i) 1, 8 -cineole is safe at the high use level proposed by the applicant (5 mg/kg complete feed) for all animal species with a margin of safety of 5. 6 to 28. 2; ii) 2 -(2 -methylprop- 1 -enyl) - 4 -methyltetrahydropyran (Class II) is safe at a maximum of 0. 3 mg/kg complete feed for cattle, salmonids and non food producing animals and of 0. 5 mg/kg complete feed for pigs and poultry. The absence of a margin of safety would not allow the simultaneous administration in feed and water for drinking of these substances. The total dose from all sources should not exceed that recommended when given in feed alone. No safety concern would arise for the consumer from the use of compounds belonging to CG 16 up to the highest safe level in feedingstuffs for all animal species. The FEEDAP Panel considers it prudent to treat both compounds under assessment as irritants to skin, eyes and respiratory tract, and as <b>skin</b> <b>sensitisers.</b> The FEEDAP Panel considers that the concentrations of the compounds belonging to CG 16 in the environment are not expected to exceed levels of concern when used in animal feeds at the levels considered to be safe to the target species.

It is currently authorised for use in chickens for fattening, pigs for fattening, piglets, sows, calves, turkeys for fattening, cats and dogs in various formulation. The product is intended for use with dogs at a minimum dose of 4. 5 x 106 and a maximum dose of 2. 0 x 109 CFU/kg feed and with cats at a minimum dose of 5. 0 x 106 and a maximum dose of 8. 0 x 109 CFU/kg feed. The Cylactin® strain does not contain marker genes typical of hospital-associated isolates responsible for clinical infections and is susceptible to clinically relevant antibiotics, except for kanamycin, which is considered of no concern. Cylactin® is safe for dogs and cats at the recommended dose range. The additive is not a skin/mucosal irritant or a <b>skin</b> <b>sensitiser.</b> As this formulation has a large particle size and the dusting potential is low, the potential for exposure via the respiratory route is considered minimal. Three studies carried out in dogs demonstrated that the additive {{has the potential to}} produce a beneficial effect in dogs, when added to feedstuffs at a dose of 2. 5 x 109 CFU kg, by increasing the intestinal or serum concentration of IgA.

This speciesis considered by EFSA to be suitable for the {{qualified presumption of safety}} approach to safety assessment. As the identity of the strain has been established and as no antibiotic resistance of concern was detected, the use of the strain in the production of silage is presumed safe for livestock species, for consumers of products from animals fed the treated silage and for the environment. The active agent is not an eye or skin irritant or a <b>skin</b> <b>sensitiser.</b> Given the proteinaceous nature of the active agent and the high dusting potential of the product tested, the FEEDAP Panel considers it prudent to treat this additive as a respiratory sensitiser. A total of 20 laboratory-scale ensiling studies were conducted with L. plantarum applied at 1 x 109 or 1 x 108 CFU/kg forage. In all the studies, forage containing the additive was compared with untreated control materials, and the duration of the studies was at least 90 days. L. plantarum has the potential to improve the production of silage by increasing lactic acid content and the preservation of dry matter, by reducing the pH and protein degradation. This was demonstrated in a range of easy and moderately difficult to ensile forage materials at a minimum concentration of 1 x 108 CFU/kg fresh material and also in difficult to ensile forage materials when added at a concentration of 1 x 109 CFU/kg fresh material...|$|E

Consequently it is concluded that the zinc chelate of amino acids hydrate is a safe source of zinc for all animal species, considering the maximum authorised contents for total zinc in feedingstuffs. The use of zinc chelate of amino acids hydrate as feed additive {{is not expected to}} modify the current consumer exposure to zinc. Therefore, no concerns for consumer safety are expected from the use of zinc chelate of amino acids hydrate in animal nutrition up to the maximum authorised levels of total zinc in feedingstuffs.

40|$|Toxicity of keratinocytes, {{the major}} cell {{type in the}} epidermis, is found in several skin {{inflammatory}} diseases. Environmental influences such as chemicals, UV light, mechanical insult, or extreme temperatures can cause necrosis of keratinocytes leading to failure of local homeostasis, breaching of the skin barrier, {{and the potential for}} infection. In such situations dermal dendritic cells (DCs) may be the important sentinels by responding to danger signals released by the dying cells and potentially activating the adaptive immune system. The aim of this project is the development of a human two cell model to study the influence of <b>skin</b> <b>sensitisers</b> and irritants on DCs in the presence of keratinocytes and test the hypothesis that DCs can respond directly to keratinocyte damage via the release of Interleukin- 1 alpha (IL- 1 α) from the dying cells. The coculture of sensitiser/irritant treated HaCaT cells with human monocytederived DCs led to activation (upregulation of cell surface markers and cytokine/chemokine production), and an increase in T cell stimulatory activity for the sensitisers and the irritants. The supernatant produced by sensitiser and irritant-labelled HaCaT cells was sufficient to induce DC maturation, again showing no difference between sensitisers and irritants. Both HaCaT cells and primary keratinocytes (EpiDermTM) released IL- 1 α after chemical exposure. IL- 1 α neutralising antibodies attenuated DC maturation induced by chemical-treated HaCaT supernatants. Furthermore the effect of IL- 1 α on DCs was studied. Our in vitro model studying the interaction between keratinocytes and DCs suggests that both sensitisers and irritants can lead to cell damage in the skin which is associated with the release of IL- 1 α and possibly other danger signals. These can activate DCs in the underlying dermis and lead to activation of the adaptive immune system causing the clearance of infections or resulting in allergic reactions...|$|R
40|$|Chemical group 20 {{consists}} of aliphatic and aromatic mono- and di-thiols and mono-, di-, tri-, and polysulphides {{with or without}} additional oxygenated functional groups, of which 31 are currently authorised for use as flavours in food. The FEEDAP Panel was unable to perform an assessment of six compounds (methanethiol, methyl propyl disulphide, dipropyl trisulphide, 3 -mercaptobutan- 2 -one, 3 -(methylthio) butanal and 3 -methyl- 1, 2, 4 -trithiane) because of {{issues related to the}} purity of the compounds. The FEEDAP Panel concludes that the following 25 compounds are safe for the target species at the proposed maximum dose level (0. 05 mg/kg complete feed) : 3 -(methylthio) propionaldehyde, methyl 3 -(methylthio) propionate, allylthiol, dimethyl sulphide, dibutyl sulphide, diallyl disulphide, diallyl trisulphide, dimethyl trisulphide, dipropyl disulphide, allyl isothiocyanate, dimethyl disulphide, 2 -methylbenzene- 1 -thiol, S-methyl butanethioate, allyl methyl disulphide, 3 -(methylthio) propan- 1 -ol, 3 -(methylthio) hexan- 1 -ol, 1 -propane- 1 -thiol, diallyl sulphide, 2, 4 -dithiapentane, 2 -methyl- 2 -(methyldithio) propanal, 2 -methylpropane- 1 -thiol, methylsulfinylmethane, propane- 2 -thiol, 3, 5 -dimethyl- 1, 2, 4 -trithiolane and 2 -methyl- 4 -propyl- 1, 3 -oxathiane. No safety concern for the consumer would arise from the use of these 25 compounds of CG 20 up to the highest safe level in feedingstuffs for all animal species, with the exception of allyl isothiocyanate. Although additional exposure to this substance through its low use level in animal feeds would not substantially increase consumer exposure, the FEEDAP Panel notes that the estimated exposure of consumers is already higher than the acceptable daily intake (ADI). All compounds should be considered irritant to skin, eyes and respiratory tract and as <b>skin</b> <b>sensitisers.</b> The proposed concentration of 0. 05 mg flavour/kg feed is not expected to cause detrimental effects to the environment, except for 2 -methylpropane- 1 -thiol, for which 0. 04 mg/kg is expected to be safe.

The safe use level for pigs and dairy cows is 20, for piglets 12 and for poultry 10 mg/kg complete feed. The high use level of 5 mg/kg complete feed for linalyl acetate, linalyl butyrate, linalyl formate, linalyl propionate, linalyl isobutyrate, terpineol, α-terpineol and terpineol acetate and 4 -terpinenol is safe for all species with a margin of safety of 1. 2 to 12. For nerolidol, 2 -methyl- 1 -phenylpropan- 2 -ol and 2 -(4 -methylphenyl) propan- 2 -ol, the maximum safe concentration is 1 mg/kg complete feed for pigs and poultry and 1. 5 mg/kg complete feed for all other species. The absence of a margin of safety would not allow the simultaneous administration in feed and water for drinking of the following compounds: linalool, nerolidol, 2 -methyl- 1 -phenylpropan- 2 -ol and 2 -(4 methylphenyl) propan- 2 -ol. No safety concern would arise for the consumer from the use of compounds belonging to CG 6 up to the highest safe level in feedingstuffs for all animal species. All compounds should be considered as irritants to skin, eyes and respiratory tract, and as <b>skin</b> <b>sensitisers.</b> All compounds of CG 6 are predicted to be safe to the soil compartment when used at levels safe to the target species. Using predictions based on chemical structure, 2 -methyl- 1 -phenylpropan- 2 -ol and 2 -(4 -methylphenyl) propan- 2 -ol were estimated to be safe to aquatic compartments. In the absence of experimental data, safety to aquatic compartments could not be established for linalyl butyrate, linalyl isobutyrate, terpineol acetate, 4 -terpinenol, linalyl formate and linalyl propionate.

40|$|Patent Blue V (E 131) is {{intended}} to add colour to feedingstuffs. It is applied for use in non food-producing animals only. The assessment is therefore limited to its safety for the target animals and the users and its efficacy. As no tolerance data were available, the safe feed concentration for target animals was derived from a NOAEL (no observable adverse effect level) from a chronic toxicity study in mice. The maximum safe feed concentration of Patent Blue V is 250 mg/kg complete feed for non food-producing animals. Patent Blue V is not genotoxic. This conclusion is limited to Patent Blue V having a minimum purity of 90 % and containing not more than 1 % of leuco base. Patent Blue V is poorly absorbed and has low systemic toxicity. In the absence of data on irritancy, sensitisation and inhalation toxicity, it would be prudent to treat Patent Blue V as an irritant and a <b>skin</b> <b>sensitiser</b> and as toxic by inhalation. Although a demonstration of efficacy is not required for additives that are used for the same function in food, an assessment of efficacy with respect to different doses {{and the nature of}} the feedingstuffs and their processing was not possible. The safety assessment is based on a Patent Blue V with a specification different from that currently used for the food additive. It is strongly recommended that the specification should be adjusted to match that of the product used in the critical genotoxicity study (in vivo comet assay). The specification for the feed additive should be: Patent Blue V with a minimum purity of 90 % and containing not more than 1 % of leuco base...|$|E
40|$|Report of a EPAA/CEFIC LRI cross sector workshop, 4 th February 2013 In a {{previous}} EPAA-Cefic LRI workshop in 2011, issues surrounding {{the use and}} interpretation of results from the local lymph node assay were addressed. At the beginning of 2013 a second joint workshop focused greater attention on the opportunities {{to make use of}} non-animal test data, not least since a number of in vitro assays have progressed to an advanced position in terms of their formal validation. It is already recognised that information produced from non-animal assays can be used in regulatory decision-making, notably in terms of classifying a substance as a <b>skin</b> <b>sensitiser.</b> The evolution into a full replacement for hazard identification, where the decision is not to classify, requires the generation of confidence in the in vitro alternative, e. g. via formal validation, the existence of peer reviewed publications and the knowledge that the assay(s) are founded on key elements of the Adverse Outcome Pathway for skin sensitisation. It is foreseen that the validated in vitro assays and relevant QSAR models can be organised into formal testing strategies to be applied for regulatory purposes by the industry. To facilitate progress, the European Partnership for Alternative Approaches to animal testing (EPAA) provided the platform for cross-industry and regulatory dialogue, enabling an essential and open debate on the acceptability of an in vitro based integrated strategy. Based on these considerations, a follow up activity was agreed upon to explore an example of an Integrated Testing Strategy for skin sensitisation hazard identification purposes in the context of REACH submissionsJRC.

40|$|Selenium is a {{trace element}} that is {{essential}} for vertebrates and involved in series of vital metabolic functions. Considering {{the purity of the}} L-selenomethionine (L-SeMet) under application and the metabolic pathways of SeMet, the FEEDAP Panel considers the use of L-SeMet as safe for all animal species, provided that the maximum total selenium level authorised in feed is respected. The use of in animal nutrition is expected to result in a similar increase in selenium deposition in animal tissues/products as that resulting from other sources of SeMet. To ensure consumer safety from consumption of food originating from animals fed L-SeMet, the FEEDAP Panel concludes that dietary selenium supplementation from the additive should not exceed a maximum of 0. 2 mg Se/kg complete feed. In the absence of specific data, the additive should be considered as an irritant to skin and eyes, as a <b>skin</b> <b>sensitiser</b> and as potentially harmful by inhalation. The FEEDAP Panel considers that the use of L-SeMet in feed does not pose an additional risk to the environment, compared with other sources of selenium for which it will substitute, as long as the maximum authorised content in feedingstuffs is not exceeded. L-SeMet is an efficient source of selenium for all species. This conclusion is derived from studies with laying hens and pigs for fattening and, in the case of ruminants, from literature describing the microbial incorporation of selenium from organic sources in the rumen. The FEEDAP Panel made some recommendations concerning (i) the specification, (ii) the use of the compound in premixtures, (iii) the use in water for drinking and (iv) risk reduction when handling the additive...|$|E
40|$|Lactobacillus kefiri is {{intended}} to improve the ensiling process at a dose of 5 x 107 CFU/kg fresh material. This species is considered by EFSA to be suitable for the {{qualified presumption of safety}} approach to safety assessment. As the identity of the strain has been established and no resistance to antibiotics of human and veterinary clinical significance was detected, the use of the strain in the production of silage is presumed safe for livestock species, consumers of products from animals fed the treated silage and for the environment. Given the proteinaceous nature of the active agent and the high dusting potential of the preparation tested, the FEEDAP Panel considers it prudent to treat this additive as a <b>skin</b> and respiratory <b>sensitiser.</b> It is also considered an irritant. The results of three efficacy studies indicated that L. kefiri has the potential to improve the aerobic stability of silage from forages with dry matter content above 40 % at the inclusion level of 5 x 107 CFU/kg forage...|$|R
40|$|One {{strain of}} Lactobacillus brevis and four strains of Lactobacillus buchneri are each {{intended}} to improve ensiling at proposed doses ranging from 5 × 107 to 1 × 108 CFU/kg fresh material. Both bacterial species are considered by EFSA to {{be suitable for}} the Qualified Presumption of Safety approach to safety assessment. As the identity of all strains was clearly established and as no antibiotic resistance of concern was detected, {{the use of these}} strains in silage production is presumed safe for livestock species, consumers of products from animals and the environment. Given the proteinaceous nature of the active agents and the high dusting potential of the products tested, the FEEDAP Panel considers it prudent to treat these additives as <b>skin</b> and respiratory <b>sensitisers.</b> They are also considered irritants. The efficacy of L. brevis to improve the preservation of nutritive value or increase the aerobic stability of silage was not demonstrated [...] One strain of L. buchneri has the potential to improve the production of silage from easy, moderately difficult and difficult to ensile materials by reducing the pH and ammonia nitrogen and by increasing the preservation of dry matter. The remaining three strains of L. buchneri showed the potential to improve the aerobic stability, one in all forages and two in easy to ensile materials...|$|R
40|$|The {{additive}} Endofeed® DC contains endo- 1, 3 (4) -beta-glucanase and endo- 1, 4 -beta-xylanase {{from the}} fermentation product {{produced by a}} non-genetically modified strain of Aspergillus niger. The applicant seeks the re-evaluation of the product and the extension of its use to pigs for fattening, minor poultry and porcine species. Tolerance trials in chickens for fattening, laying hens and pigs showed that the animals tolerated well 100 -fold the recommended dose. Therefore, the FEEDAP Panel concludes that the additive is safe for these target species. The conclusions reached on those species can be extrapolated to minor poultry species and to minor porcine species for fattening. In the absence of adequate studies, the FEEDAP Panel cannot conclude on the safety of Endofeed® DC for the consumer. No specific studies were provided regarding the safety for the user. Therefore, Endofeed® DC {{should be considered a}} potential skin and eye irritant, and a potential <b>skin</b> and respiratory <b>sensitiser.</b> The results obtained in efficacy studies performed in chickens for fattening, laying hens and pigs for fattening showed that the additive has the potential to improve the performance of the animals. The nominal dose at which the potential of the enzyme preparation is demonstrated is the recommended dose. The conclusions on the efficacy on the major poultry species and on pigs for fattening can be extrapolated to minor poultry species and minor porcine species for fattening, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Vitamin C is {{essential}} for primates, guinea pigs and fish. Vitamin C, {{in the form of}} ascorbic acid and its calcium and sodium salts, ascorbyl palmitate, sodium calcium ascorbyl phosphate and sodium ascorbyl phosphate, is safe for all animal species. Setting a maximum content in feed and water for drinking is not considered necessary. Data on the vitamin C consumption of consumers are based on the levels of vitamin C in foodstuffs, including food of animal origin, produced in accordance with current EU legislation on the supplementation of feed with vitamin C. The exposure is far below the guidance level. Any potential contribution of the use of vitamin C in feed is therefore already considered in the above data. Consequently, the use of vitamin C in animal nutrition is not of concern for consumer safety. In the absence of inhalation toxicity studies it would be prudent to assume that inhalation of dust from the additives presents a health hazard to workers. Sodium calcium ascorbyl phosphate is not an irritant to skin and eyes and is unlikely to be a <b>skin</b> <b>sensitiser.</b> This conclusion is extrapolated to sodium ascorbyl phosphate. In the absence of data, ascorbic acid, sodium ascorbate, calcium ascorbate and ascorbyl palmitate should be considered as irritant to skin and eyes and as dermal sensitisers. The supplementation of feed with vitamin C does not pose a risk to the environment. Ascorbic acid, sodium calcium ascorbyl phosphate and sodium ascorbyl phosphate are regarded as effective sources of vitamin C when added to feed or water for drinking. Since ascorbic acid, sodium ascorbate, calcium ascorbate and ascorbyl palmitate are authorised for use as antioxidants in food and their function in feed {{is essential}}ly the same as that in food, no further demonstration of efficacy is considered necessary...|$|E
40|$|The safety {{assessment}} of the additive {{is based on the}} separate consideration of its two constituents, bentonite and sepiolite. The currently authorised maximum contents for bentonite and sepiolite when used individually (20   000 mg/kg complete feed) are considered safe for all animal species. In consequence, Toxfin® Dry would be safe for all animals species and categories up to a maximum concentration of 20   000 mg/kg complete feed. Bentonite and sepiolite, in common with other clays, are not absorbed to any measurable extent. Consequently, {{it is unlikely that the}} consumption of edible tissues/products of treated animals would expose the consumer to harmful amounts of residues of any chemical component derived from Toxfin® Dry. The FEEDAP Panel considers that there is no concern for the safety of consumers of food products derived from animals fed diets containing the additive. Dust generated from Toxfin® Dry during normal handling has the potential to expose the whole of the respiratory tract of users to potentially harmful substances (bentonite, sepiolite and crystalline silica) for which no safe levels of exposure have been identified. Measures must be taken to limit exposure of users to dust. In the absence of data for sepiolite, it would be prudent to treat ToxFin® Dry as a skin and eye irritant and a <b>skin</b> <b>sensitiser.</b> Bentonite and sepiolite are naturally occurring clays widely distributed in the environment. Therefore, it is not expected that the use of the additive in animal nutrition would adversely affect the environment. Since only one in vivo study in chickens has been provided, the FEEDAP Panel considers that there is insufficient evidence to conclude on the efficacy of the additive as a substance for reduction of contamination of feed with mycotoxins...|$|E
40|$|The {{additive}} hydroxy-analogue of selenomethionine {{consists of}} synthetic R,S- 2 -hydroxy- 4 -methylselenobutanoic acid (HMSeBA) and {{is intended to}} be used as a source of the essential trace element selenium for all animal species/categories. Based on data from tolerance studies in chickens and turkeys for fattening and piglets, the additive is considered as safe for all species/categories up to the maximum authorised total selenium level in complete feed. After being absorbed, HMSeBA is metabolised to selenomethionine; consequently, no residues of the compound itself occur in animal tissues and products. Compared with inorganic selenium sources, the use of HMSeBA in animal nutrition would result in a similar increase in selenium deposition in animal tissues/products as that resulting from selenised yeast. To ensure consumer safety from consumption of food originating from animals supplemented with HMSeBA, the FEEDAP Panel concluded that selenium supplementation from the additive should not exceed a maximum of 0. 2 mg Se/kg complete feed. The additive should be regarded as an eye irritant, but should not be classified as skin irritant or <b>skin</b> <b>sensitiser.</b> Inhalation exposure poses a hazard to users; the FEEDAP Panel concludes, therefore, that the formulation and conditions of use of the solid form of the additive should minimise user exposure by inhalation. The use of HMSeBA in feed does not pose an additional risk to the environment, compared to other sources of selenium for which it will substitute, as long as the maximum authorised content in feedingstuffs is not exceeded. Based on the response of plasma glutathione peroxidase activity and the plasma/liver concentration of selenium in chickens for fattening and pigs for fattening, the FEEDAP Panel considers that HMSeBA is an efficaceous source of selenium for all animal species/categories. HMSeBA does not modify the quality of meat as measured by physico-chemical properties...|$|E
40|$|Hostazym C is {{an enzyme}} {{preparation}} of endo- 1, 4 -beta-glucanase {{produced by a}} non-genetically modified strain of Trichoderma citrinoviride. The results of an in vitro chromosomal aberration test and of an in vivo comet assay indicate the presence of genotoxic activity in the product. The tolerance studies provided in target species did not indicate any adverse effect of the additive. However, due to the genotoxic hazard from the product, the FEEDAP Panel cannot conclude on {{the safety of the}} additive for the target species. The results obtained in a repeated-dose oral toxicity study did not indicate any concern for consumer safety. However, the identity and fate of the substance causing the genotoxic effect is unknown; therefore, the source of the risk to the consumer cannot be established. Thus, the FEEDAP Panel cannot conclude on the safety of the additive for the consumer. The product should be considered a potential skin and eye irritant, and a potential <b>skin</b> and respiratory <b>sensitiser.</b> Due to the presence of genotoxic activity in the product, any level of exposure to the additive by any route is considered hazardous. No risks to the environment are expected to result from the use of the additive in feed, and, therefore, no further environmental risk assessment is required. Based on the results obtained in the efficacy studies, the FEEDAP Panel concludes that the additive {{has the potential to be}} efficacious in chickens for fattening at a dose of 500 CU/kg feed and in weaned piglets at 350 CU/kg. Conclusions on the efficacy can be extrapolated to minor poultry species for fattening...|$|R
40|$|The {{additive}} formaldehyde is an {{aqueous solution}} containing 37 % formaldehyde and 14 % methanol. It {{is intended for}} use in all animal species at concentrations between 68 and 680 mg active substance/kg complete feed. Free and reversibly bound formaldehyde is readily absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract and joins the pool of endogenous formaldehyde. It is rapidly oxidised to formic acid further on to carbon dioxide and water. Formaldehyde is a carcinogen by inhalation. While local irritation is expected to strongly promote carcinogenesis, lower local concentrations of formaldehyde are known to produce DNA adducts. Therefore, the FEEDAP Panel deems it prudent not to consider the exposure to non-irritant concentration as totally riskless. Moreover, {{on the basis of}} the present knowledge, a causal association between formaldehyde exposure and leukaemia cannot be ruled out. The FEEDAP Panel estimated the oral intake of formaldehyde of consumers from food of animal origin to be 4 mg per person per day. A reliable additional exposure of consumers to formaldehyde from supplementing feedingstuffs cannot be calculated. However, the FEEDAP Panel considers that the proposed use of formaldehyde as a feed additive would not increase consumer exposure and consequently would not pose an additional risk for the consumer. A safe feed concentration for all animal species and categories could not be determined. Formaldehyde is a strong irritant, a potent <b>skin</b> and respiratory <b>sensitiser.</b> Measures should be taken to ensure that the respiratory tract, skin and eyes of any person handling the product are not exposed to any dust, mist or vapour generated by the use of formaldehyde. The use of formaldehyde in animal nutrition is not expected to pose a risk for the environment. Formaldehyde in concentrations between 340 and 680 mg/kg feed (compound feed and/or feed material) has the potential to be an efficacious preservative...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{estimate}} {{the occurrence of}} hand eczema in hairdressers in Sweden. Methods: The occurrence of hand eczema was estimated in a Swedish longitudinal retrospective cohort study including all female graduates from vocational schools for hairdressers from 1970 to 1995. A stratified sample {{from the general population}} acted as controls. A self-administered questionnaire including questions on the occurrence of hand eczema, skin atopy, working periods and number of hair treatments performed per week was sent to the participants. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) of hand eczema were estimated. Results: The incidence rate of hand eczema in hairdressers was 23. 8 cases/ 1000 person-years, whereas in hairdressers who were aged, 25 years it was 37. 1 / 1000 person-years. The corresponding IRR for hairdressers compared with controls was 2. 5 (95 % confidence interval (Cl) 2. 2 to 2. 8), and that for younger hairdressers was 3. 1 (95 % Cl 2. 6 to 3. 5). The mean age at onset of hand eczema was 21. 6 years for hairdressers and 21. 2 years for controls. The 1 -year prevalence of hand eczema was 18. 0 % for hairdressers and 12. 1 % for controls. A large number of hair treatments involving exposure to <b>skin</b> irritants and <b>sensitisers</b> were reported. The incidence rate of hand eczema was higher among individuals with a history of childhood eczema, both for hairdressers and for controls, giving an (age-adjusted) IRR of 1. 9 and 2. 2, respectively. The attributable fraction of hand eczema from skin atopy was 9. 6 %. A synergistic effect of skin atopy and hairdressing was found on the occurrence of hand eczema. The relative excess risk due to interaction was 1. 21 (95 % Cl 0. 21 to 2. 21; p = 0. 01). Conclusion: Hairdressers are highly exposed to skin-damaging substances. The self-reported incidence of hand eczema was substantially higher in female hairdressers than in controls from the general population and than that found previously in register-based studies. For many individuals, onset of hand eczema occurs early in life. Only about 10 % of the hand eczema cases among hairdressers would be prevented if no one with skin atopy entered the trade...|$|R
