5|$|The pale {{crag martin}} is much drabber than most African swallows, and {{confusion}} is unlikely except with other crag martins or with sand martins {{of the genus}} Riparia. It is 15% smaller, paler and greyer than the Eurasian crag martin, and has smaller tail spots. It is smaller, paler, and has a more contrasting throat than the rock martin. In the far east of its range, the pale crag martin always has lighter underparts than the dusky crag martin. Although only slightly larger than the <b>sand</b> <b>martin</b> and brown-throated <b>sand</b> <b>martin,</b> the pale crag martin is more robust, has white tail spots, and lacks a breast band. Separation of similar species in flight may be complicated by the difficulty of judging colours accurately in strong desert light, particularly with juveniles. The fast flight of the brown-throated <b>sand</b> <b>martin</b> also makes identification more difficult.|$|E
5|$|These drab martins {{can only}} be {{confused}} with each other, or with sand martins of the genus Riparia. Even the smaller Ptyonoprogne species are slightly larger and more robust than the <b>sand</b> <b>martin</b> and brown-throated <b>sand</b> <b>martin,</b> and have the white tail spots which are absent from the Riparia martins. Where the ranges of Ptyonoprogne species overlap, the Eurasian crag martin is darker, browner and 15% larger than the rock martin, and larger and paler, particularly on its underparts, than the dusky crag martin. The white tail spots of the Eurasian crag martin are significantly larger than those of both its relatives. In the east of its range, the rock martin always has lighter, more contrasted underparts than the dusky crag martin.|$|E
5|$|More than 40 beetle {{species have}} been {{recorded}} in common house martin nests, but most are either typical of the locality or found in the nests of other birds. The typical number of individuals, around 200, is relatively low compared to other bird species (1,400 individual beetles for house sparrow, 2,000 for <b>sand</b> <b>martin).</b> The beetles {{have no effect on}} the nesting birds, and the reason for their comparatively low numbers is unknown, although the numbers of specific parasites found in house martin's nests is also quite small.|$|E

5|$|The crag martins {{are four}} species of small {{passerine}} {{birds in the}} genus Ptyonoprogne of the swallow family. They are the Eurasian crag martin (P.rupestris), the pale crag martin (P.obsoleta), the rock martin (P.fuligula) and the dusky crag martin (P.concolor). They {{are closely related to}} each other, and have formerly sometimes been considered to be one species. They are closely related to the Hirundo barn swallows and are placed in that genus by some authorities. These are small swallows with brown upperparts, paler underparts without a breast band, and a square tail with white patches. They can be distinguished from each other on size, the colour shade of the upperparts and underparts, and minor plumage details like throat colour. They resemble the <b>sand</b> <b>martin,</b> but are darker below, and lack a breast band.|$|E
25|$|The {{coast from}} Bridlington {{in the north}} to Spurn Point is an {{interesting}} complex of coastal processes. The soft cliffs of Holderness are subject to rapid erosion whilst the eroded material is being deposited on the Spurn peninsula. The speed of erosion along the glacial till cliffs prohibits colonisation of anything but sparse ruderal vegetation. Coltsfoot is particularly common and <b>sand</b> <b>martin</b> colonies have become established in places.|$|E
500|$|No other {{streaked}} swallow species {{occur within}} the island breeding {{range of the}} Mascarene martin, and in Africa the lesser striped swallow is larger, has a deeply forked tail and a very different plumage, with dark blue upperparts, a red rump and a chestnut head. The brown-throated <b>sand</b> <b>martin</b> [...] has similar structure and plumage colour to the Mascarene martin, but has plain, unstreaked underparts. The small Mascarene swiftlet has longer, narrower wings than the martin, and a much lighter flight. The Brazza's martin is smaller, has a plainer back and finer dashing on the throat and chest, {{but there is no}} range overlap.|$|E
5000|$|Linnaeus already {{remarked on}} this species' {{breeding}} habits: Habitat in Europae collibus arenosis abruptis, foramine serpentino - [...] "it lives in Europe, in winding holes in sheer sandy hills". It {{has been observed}} that <b>sand</b> <b>martins</b> favour loess as {{a particular type of}} ground to nest in. <b>Sand</b> <b>martins</b> are generally found near larger bodies of water, such as rivers, lakes or even the ocean, throughout the year.|$|R

500|$|On {{the eastern}} {{outskirts}} of Bath a toll bridge near the George Inn links Bathampton to Batheaston, {{on the north}} bank of the canal. When the A46 Bathampton by-pass was built, the [...] Bathampton Meadow was created to provide additional flood relief. The resultant wet meadows and oxbow lake have proved attractive {{to a number of}} migrants; wading birds such as dunlin, ringed and little ringed plover, and green and common sandpiper are frequent visitors in spring and autumn. <b>Sand</b> <b>martin</b> and kingfisher have been seen regularly by the lake, and other migrants have included yellow wagtail, whinchat and hobby. The canal turns south into a valley between Bathampton Wood and Bathford Hill which includes Brown's Folly, a [...] biological and geological Site of Special Scientific Interest.|$|E
500|$|The four Ptyonoprogne {{species are}} members of the swallow family of birds, and are classed as members of the Hirundininae {{subfamily}} which comprises all swallows and martins except the very distinctive river martins. DNA studies suggest that there are three major groupings within the Hirundininae, broadly correlating with the type of nest built. The groups are the [...] "core martins" [...] including burrowing species like the <b>sand</b> <b>martin,</b> the [...] "nest-adopters", which are birds like the tree swallow that utilise natural cavities, and the [...] "mud nest builders". The Ptyonoprogne species construct an open mud nest and therefore belong to the latter group; Hirundo species also build open nests, Delichon house martins have a closed nest, and the Cecropis and Petrochelidon swallows have retort-like closed nests with an entrance tunnel.|$|E
500|$|The Eurasian {{tree sparrow}} reaches {{breeding}} maturity {{within a year}} from hatching, and typically builds its nest in a cavity in an old tree or rock face. Some nests are not in holes as such, but are built among roots of overhanging gorse or similar bush. Roof cavities in houses may be used, and in the tropics, the crown of a palm tree or the ceiling of a verandah {{can serve as a}} nest site. [...] This species will breed in the disused domed nest of a European magpie, or an active or unused stick nest of a large bird such as the white stork, white-tailed eagle, osprey, black kite or grey heron. It will sometimes attempt to take over the nest of other birds that breed in holes or enclosed spaces, such as the barn swallow, house martin, <b>sand</b> <b>martin</b> or European bee-eater.|$|E

500|$|The three Delichon {{species are}} members of the swallow family of birds, and are classed as members of the Hirundininae {{subfamily}} which comprises all swallows and martins except the very distinctive river martins. DNA studies suggest that there are three major groupings within the Hirundininae, broadly correlating with the type of nest built.

The Delichon species construct a closed mud nest and therefore belong to the latter group; they appear to be intermediate between the Hirundo and Ptyonoprogne species that make open cup nests, and the Cecropis and Petrochelidon swallows, which have retort-like closed nests with an entrance tunnel. The genetic evidence suggests a close relationship between Hirundo and Delichon, which is further supported by the frequency of interbreeding between two widespread species, the barn swallow and the common house martin, despite being their being in different genera. The suggested taxonomic sequence of the mud-building swallows has been recommended by at least two European taxonomic committees.|$|E

The genus Ptyonoprogne is closely related to the larger swallow genus Hirundo into which it is often subsumed, but a DNA analysis showed that a coherent enlarged Hirundo genus should contain all the mud-builder genera. Although the nests of the Ptyonoprogne crag martins resembles those of typical Hirundo species like the barn swallow, the DNA research showed that if the Delichon house martins are considered to be a separate genus, as is normally the case, Cecropis, Petrochelidon and Ptyonoprogne should also be split off.|$|E
2500|$|The {{most common}} [...] plumage is glossy dark {{blue or green}} above and plain or {{streaked}} underparts, often white or rufous. Species which burrow or live in dry or mountainous areas are often matte brown above (e.g. <b>sand</b> <b>martin</b> and crag martin).
