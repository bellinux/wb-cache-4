40|$|To detect genomic {{instability}} {{caused by}} Ac elements in transgenic tomatoes, {{we used the}} incompletely dominant mutation Xanthophyllic- 1 (Xa- 1) as a whole plant marker gene. Xa- 1 is located on chromosome 10 and in the heterozygote state causes leaves to be yellow. Transgenic Ac-containing tomato plants which differed in the location and number of their Ac elements were crossed to Xa- 1 tester lines and F(1) progeny were scored for aberrant somatic <b>sectoring.</b> Of 800 test and control F(1) progeny screened, only four plants had aberrantly high levels of somatic <b>sectors.</b> Three of the plants had twin <b>sectors</b> consisting of green tissue adjacent to white tissue, and the other had twin <b>sectors</b> comprised of green tissue adjacent to tissue more yellow than the heterozygote background. <b>Sectoring</b> was inherited and the two <b>sectoring</b> phenotypes mapped to opposite homologs of chromosome 10; the green/yellow <b>sectoring</b> phenotype mapped in coupling to Xa- 1 while the green/white <b>sectoring</b> phenotype mapped in repulsion. The two <b>sectoring</b> phenotypes cosegregated with different single, non-rearranged Acs, and loss of these Acs from the genome corresponded {{to the loss of}} <b>sectoring.</b> <b>Sectoring</b> was still observed after transposition of the Ac to a new site which indicated that <b>sectoring</b> was not limited to a single locus. In both <b>sectored</b> lines, meiotic recombination of the <b>sectoring</b> Ac to the opposite homolog caused the phenotype to switch between the green/yellow and the green/white phenotypes. Thus the two different <b>sectoring</b> phenotypes arose from the same Ac-induced mechanism; the phenotype depended on which chromosome 10 homolog the Ac was on. We believe that the twin <b>sectors</b> resulted from chromosome breakage mediated by a single intact, transposition-competent Ac element...|$|R

40|$|The study {{explores the}} {{structure}} of the Indian economy with an input based scheme of classification of <b>sectors.</b> On the basis of the factors of production (natural resource, research & development and labour & capital) intensively used in the production process, all economic activities are classified into three broad categories- Ricardo <b>sectors</b> (natural resource intensive), High-Technology <b>sectors</b> (high-technology intensive) and Heckscher – Ohlin <b>sectors</b> (capital-labour intensive). In order to explore {{the structure of}} the Indian economy Input – Output technique developed by Leontief, has been used as it offers important insights into the structure of an economy. The relative strength of linkages of the three categories of <b>sectors</b> have been studied and the key <b>sectors</b> of the Indian economy are identified. Rasmussen’s most widely used methods of measuring forward and backward linkages are used to identify the key <b>sectors.</b> Forward linkages of different <b>sectors</b> are also measured within the Ghosian framework where a matrix of fixed output coefficients is used for this purpose. When we use Rasmussen’s method for measuring both forward and backward linkages, key <b>sectors</b> are mostly Hecksher – Ohlin (H-O) <b>sectors.</b> Among the ten key <b>sectors,</b> the numbers of the Ricardo and High Technology (H-T) <b>sectors</b> are two and one respectively.

40|$|A greedy {{heuristic}} algorithm for combining under-utilized airspace <b>sectors</b> {{to conserve}} {{air traffic control}} resources is suggested and analyzed. Simulations using historical air traffic data suggest that systematically combining under-utilized airspace <b>sectors</b> within centers can lead to significantly fewer <b>sectors</b> and therefore a more efficient utilization of air traffic control resources. The efficiency gains are more modest when <b>sectors</b> are only allowed to combine with <b>sectors</b> in the same controller area of specialization.

40|$|Little {{is known}} about the total factor {{productivity}} of the non-tradable <b>sectors</b> in China. In this paper we estimate productivity growth of the non-tradable <b>sectors</b> by studying the relative price movements of the non-tradable <b>sectors</b> vis-à-vis the tradable <b>sectors,</b> i. e. changes in the internal real exchange rate. We find that prices of the non-tradable <b>sectors</b> have risen significantly faster than those of the tradable <b>sectors,</b> and China’s internal real exchange rate has appreciated at a faster pace than the renminbi real effective exchange rate. We also find the non-tradable <b>sectors</b> have seen much lower productivity growth than the tradable <b>sectors,</b> and such productivity differentials are large when compared to other economies. We argue that if productivity growth in the non-tradable <b>sectors</b> remains slow, China will likely see more difficulty in rebalancing its growth pattern and higher inflationary pressures in the medium term.
