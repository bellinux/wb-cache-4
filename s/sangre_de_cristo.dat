5|$|The idea of {{locating}} Project Y {{with the}} Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago, {{or at the}} Clinton Engineer Works in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, was considered, {{but in the end}} it was decided that a remote location would be best. A site in the vicinity of Los Angeles was rejected on security grounds, and one near Reno, Nevada as being too inaccessible. On Oppenheimer's recommendation, the search was narrowed to the vicinity of Albuquerque, New Mexico, where Oppenheimer owned a ranch in the <b>Sangre</b> <b>de</b> <b>Cristo</b> Range. The climate was mild, there were air and rail connections to Albuquerque, it was sufficiently distant from the West Coast of the United States for a Japanese attack not to be an issue, and the population density was low.|$|E
5|$|In October 1942, Major John H. Dudley of the Manhattan Engineer District (the {{military}} {{component of the}} Manhattan Project) surveyed sites around Gallup, Las Vegas, La Ventana, Jemez Springs, and Otowi, and recommended the one near Jemez Springs. On 16 November, Oppenheimer, Groves, Dudley and others toured the site. Oppenheimer feared that the high cliffs surrounding the site would make his people feel claustrophobic, while the engineers were concerned {{with the possibility of}} flooding. The party then moved on to the Otowi site, the vicinity of the Los Alamos Ranch School. Oppenheimer was impressed and expressed a strong preference for the site, citing its natural beauty and views of the <b>Sangre</b> <b>de</b> <b>Cristo</b> Mountains, which, he hoped, would inspire those who would work on the project. The engineers were concerned about the poor access road, and whether the water supply would be adequate, but otherwise felt that it was ideal.|$|E

25|$|In southmost Colorado is {{the large}} San Luis Valley, where the {{headwaters}} of the Rio Grande are located. The valley sits between the <b>Sangre</b> <b>De</b> <b>Cristo</b> Mountains and San Juan Mountains, and consists of large desert lands that eventually run into the mountains. The Rio Grande drains due south into New Mexico, Mexico, and Texas. Across the <b>Sangre</b> <b>de</b> <b>Cristo</b> Range to the east of the San Luis Valley lies the Wet Mountain Valley. These basins, particularly the San Luis Valley, lie along the Rio Grande Rift, a major geological formation of the Rocky Mountains, and its branches.|$|E
25|$|The Taos Mountain Trail was the {{historic}} pathway for trade and business exchanges between agrarian Taos (New Mexico) and the Great Plains (Colorado) from pre-history (1100 A.D.) through the Spanish Colonial period {{and into the}} time of the European and American presence. The Taos Mountain Trail, between northern New Mexico and southern Colorado, connected the high mountain traders and their trading partners north and south of the <b>Sangre</b> <b>de</b> <b>Cristo</b> Mountains. Also called the Trapper's Trail, the pathway was only wide enough for people on foot or horses in single file, but it shortened a trip from Taos to the plains farther north from nearly two weeks to three days in good weather. The Taos Mountain Trail was also known as the <b>Sangre</b> <b>de</b> <b>Cristo</b> Trail and the Aztec Trail.|$|E
25|$|During the {{railroad}} expansion era (1848-1853), the Taos Mountain Trail, {{also called the}} <b>Sangre</b> <b>de</b> <b>Cristo</b> Pass, was considered for a railway route. E.G. Beckwith was sent to survey the area in 1853. Richard Kern, a topographer and expeditionary artist, traveled with Beckwith to illustrate the land for the report. Although the trail was not chosen for {{the railroad}} as it was too steep, the report did provide documentation of the Taos Mountain Trail.|$|E
50|$|The tallest {{point is}} known as Greenhorn Mountain, which has {{multiple}} peaks, the highest of which reaches 12346 ft. Greenhorn Peak, St. Charles Peak, and North Peak all reach above tree line. The range provides the eastern boundary of the Wet Mountain Valley, bordered on the west by the <b>Sangre</b> <b>de</b> <b>Cristos.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The peak is {{accessed}} by Trail 251, the Skyline Trail, which climbs to a saddle about 1000 ft below the summit; the remaining distance {{is covered by}} a steep unofficial trail along the ridgeline. Under good conditions the summit is a simple [...] "walk-up" [...] climb, but the <b>Sangre</b> <b>de</b> <b>Cristos</b> are unusually prone to lightning, and during the summer months, the wise hiker is off Santa Fe Baldy and other high summits in the range by noon, to avoid afternoon thunderstorms.|$|R
5000|$|Kit Carson {{can also}} be reached from {{the east side of}} the <b>Sangre</b> <b>de</b> <b>Cristos</b> via the South Colony Lakes access. (A four-wheel drive road {{currently}} provides relatively a high elevation trailhead; however this road will be closed half way up on October 13, 2009.) This route starts by using part of the trail for Humboldt Peak, and then traverses a ridge and plateau toward Kit Carson. A sub-peak named Columbia Point (informally known as [...] "Kat Carson") is climbed on the way to the main summit.|$|R

In 1936, he accepted a professorship in Philosophy at Wheaton College, Illinois, where he remained until 1943 when he accepted the Chairmanship of the Philosophy Department at Butler University in Indianapolis. After his retirement from Butler in 1973, he taught at Covenant College in Lookout Mountain, Georgia, and <b>Sangre</b> <b>de</b> <b>Cristo</b> Seminary in Westcliffe, Colorado.|$|E
25|$|The New Mexican {{landscape}} {{ranges from}} wide, rose-colored deserts to broken mesas to high, snow-capped peaks. Despite New Mexico's arid image, heavily forested mountain wildernesses cover {{a significant portion}} of the state, especially towards the north. The <b>Sangre</b> <b>de</b> <b>Cristo</b> Mountains, the southernmost part of the Rocky Mountains, run roughly north-south along the east side of the Rio Grande in the rugged, pastoral north. The most important of New Mexico's rivers are the Rio Grande, Pecos, Canadian, San Juan, and Gila. The Rio Grande is tied for the fourth-longest river in the United States.|$|E
25|$|In March Sibley sent a Confederate {{force of}} 200-300 Texans {{under the command}} of Maj. Charles L. Pyron on an advance {{expedition}} over the Glorieta Pass, a strategic location on the Santa Fe Trail at the southern tip of the <b>Sangre</b> <b>de</b> <b>Cristo</b> Mountains southeast of Santa Fe. Control of the pass would allow the Confederates to advance onto the High Plains and make an assault on Fort Union, a Union stronghold on the route northward over Raton Pass. Sibley sent six companies {{under the command of}} Col. Tom Green to block the eastern end of Glorieta Pass, turning any Union defensive position in the Sangre de Cristos.|$|E
50|$|According to the United States Census Bureau, {{the town}} has a total area of 4.7 sq mi, all land. Clayton has an {{elevation}} of approximately 5050 ft. above sea level.

This region stretches to the <b>Sangre</b> <b>de</b> <b>Cristos</b> Mountains down to the Guadalupe Mountains.Clayton is located in the northeast corner of New Mexico, 10 miles from the border of Texas and 11 miles from the border of the Oklahoma panhandle. Clayton is also located near two parks, Clayton Lake State Park, and Capulin Volcano National Monument. A Carbon Dioxide Field called Bravo Dome can be found near Clayton and stretches nearly 1 million acres.|$|R
5000|$|Generally climbs of Crestone Peak or Crestone Needle {{start from}} a base camp at South Colony Lakes, {{east of the}} peak, {{accessed}} from the Wet Mountain Valley on the northeast side of the range. This route involves nearly [...] of elevation gain, and ascends to a large relatively flat area called [...] "The Pool Table" [...] (a few large rocks lie on the tundra, as if billiard balls) or the [...] "Bears' Playground." [...] Then it ascends a long gully on the northwest side of Crestone Peak, which involves some rockfall danger (hence a climbing helmet is suggested). Crestone Peak {{is one of the}} more dangerous fourteener climbs in Colorado; accidents occur often in the Crestones, some caused by falls or lightning (a daily summer occurrence in the <b>Sangre</b> <b>de</b> <b>Cristos).</b>|$|R
50|$|The Rio Grande {{follows a}} course through the {{southern}} valley from Del Norte southeastward via Alamosa to New Mexico. South of Alamosa it {{is joined by}} several streams from the west including the Alamosa River and the Conejos River and Culebra Creek from the east. Most of the northern valley is an endorheic basin called the San Luis Closed Basin. Generally, within the Closed Basin the major streams such as Saguache Creek, San Luis Creek, and the streams from the west face of the <b>Sangre</b> <b>de</b> <b>Cristos</b> flow only a short distance onto the valley floor as surface streams. Only in very wet years, perhaps every 20 years, does the stream system in the Closed Basin flow as a connected unit into San Luis Lake at the low point of the Closed Basin west of the Great Sand Dunes.|$|R
25|$|The {{settlement}} of Santa Fe was {{established at the}} foot of the <b>Sangre</b> <b>de</b> <b>Cristo</b> Mountains, the southernmost subrange of the Rocky Mountains, around 1608. The city, along with most of the settled areas of the state, was abandoned by the Spanish for 12 years (1680–92) as a result of the successful Pueblo Revolt. After the death of the Pueblo leader Popé, Diego de Vargas restored the area to Spanish rule. While developing Santa Fe as a trade center, the returning settlers founded Albuquerque in 1706 from existing surrounding communities, naming it for the viceroy of New Spain, Francisco Fernández de la Cueva, 10th Duke of Alburquerque.|$|E
25|$|At {{the turn}} of the 19th century, the extreme northeastern part of New Mexico, north of the Canadian River and east of the <b>Sangre</b> <b>de</b> <b>Cristo</b> Mountains, was still ruled by France, which sold it in 1803 to the United States as part of the Louisiana Purchase. The United States {{assigned}} this portion of New Mexico as part of the Louisiana Territory until 1812; that year Louisiana was admitted as a state. The US then reclassified this area as part of the Missouri Territory. This region of the state (along with territory that makes up present-day southeastern Colorado, the Texas and Oklahoma Panhandles, and southwestern Kansas) was ceded to Spain under the Adams-Onis Treaty in 1819.|$|E
25|$|Philmont Scout Ranch is a large, rugged, mountainous ranch {{located near}} the town of Cimarron, New Mexico, {{covering}} 140,177 acres (219 sq mi; 567km²) of wilderness in the <b>Sangre</b> <b>de</b> <b>Cristo</b> Mountains of the Rocky Mountains of northern New Mexico. The ranch, formerly the property of oil baron Waite Phillips and now that of the Boy Scouts of America, is a National High Adventure Base in which crews of Scouts and Venturers take part in backpacking expeditions and other outdoor activities. It is the one of the largest youth camps in the world in land area. Between June 8 and August 22 around 22,000 Scouts and adult leaders backpack across the Ranch's extensive backcountry while over 1,130 seasonal staff personnel maintain the Ranch's summer operations.|$|E

25|$|Within the {{interior}} of the Rocky Mountains are several large parks or high broad basins. In the north, {{on the east side of}} the Continental Divide is North Park. North Park is drained by the North Platte River, which flows north into the northwest state of Wyoming. Just south but on the west side of the Continental Divide is Middle Park, drained by the Colorado River. South Park is the headwaters of the South Platte River. To the south lies the San Luis Valley, the headwaters of the Rio Grande, which drains into New Mexico. Across the <b>Sangre</b> <b>de</b> <b>Cristo</b> Range to the east of the San Luis Valley lies the Wet Mountain Valley. These basins, particularly the San Luis Valley, lie along the Rio Grande Rift, a major tectonic feature. See Rift.|$|E
25|$|The {{eastern edge}} of the Rockies rises {{dramatically}} above the Interior Plains of central North America, including the <b>Sangre</b> <b>de</b> <b>Cristo</b> Mountains of New Mexico and Colorado, the Front Range of Colorado, the Wind River Range and Big Horn Mountains of Wyoming, the Absaroka-Beartooth ranges and Rocky Mountain Front of Montana and the Clark Range of Alberta. In Canada geographers define three main groups of ranges: the Continental Ranges, Hart Ranges and Muskwa Ranges (the latter two flank the Peace River, the only river to pierce the Rockies, and are collectively referred to as the Northern Rockies). The Muskwa and Hart Ranges together comprise {{what is known as the}} Northern Rockies (the Mackenzie Mountains north of the Liard River are sometimes referred to as being part of the Rocky Mountains but this is an unofficial designation).|$|E
25|$|Don Juan de Oñate led {{the first}} European effort to colonize {{the region in}} 1598, {{establishing}} Santa Fe de Nuevo México as a province of New Spain. Under Juan de Oñate and his son, {{the capital of the}} province was the settlement of San Juan de los Caballeros north of Santa Fe near modern Ohkay Owingeh Pueblo. New Mexico's second Spanish governor, Don Pedro de Peralta, however, founded a new city {{at the foot of the}} <b>Sangre</b> <b>de</b> <b>Cristo</b> Mountains in 1607, which he called La Villa Real de la Santa Fe de San Francisco de Asís, the Royal Town of the Holy Faith of Saint Francis of Assisi. In 1610, he designated it as the capital of the province, which it has almost constantly remained, making it the oldest state capital in the United States.|$|E

25|$|St. John's Santa Fe {{campus is}} located at the foot of Monte Sol, on the eastern edge of Santa Fe. It was opened in 1964 in {{response}} to the increase in qualified applicants at the Annapolis campus. The College chose to open a second campus rather than increase the size of the Annapolis campus. The second campus {{was part of a larger}} project, championed by then-college president Richard Weigle, which called for six campuses to be built across the country. St. John's abandoned the concept when it later sold a tract of land it owned in Monterey, California. The Santa Fe campus offers students a more secluded atmosphere than the Annapolis campus, with the vast Pecos Wilderness and <b>Sangre</b> <b>de</b> <b>Cristo</b> Mountains on its doorstep. The campus also boasts an expansive view of Santa Fe that extends to Los Alamos to the west.|$|E
25|$|In 1610, Pedro de Peralta, a later {{governor}} of the Province of New Mexico, established the settlement of Santa Fe near {{the southern end of}} the <b>Sangre</b> <b>de</b> <b>Cristo</b> mountain range. Missions were established to convert the locals, and manage the agricultural industry. The territory's indigenous population resented the Spanish prohibition of their traditional religion, and the encomienda system of forced labor. The unrest led to the Pueblo Revolt in 1680, forcing the Spanish to retreat to Paso del Norte (modern-day Ciudad Juárez.) After the return of the Spanish in 1692, the final resolution included a marked reduction of Spanish efforts to eradicate native culture and religion, the issuing of substantial communal land grants to each Pueblo, and a public defender of their rights and for their legal cases in Spanish courts. In 1776 the Province came under the new Provincias Internas jurisdiction. In the late 18th century the Spanish land grant encouraged the settlement by individuals of large land parcels outside Mission and Pueblo boundaries, many of which became ranchos.|$|E

Washington State Route 904 was renamed Lt. Michael P. Anderson Memorial Highway, as it runs through Cheney, Washington, the town where he graduated from high school. A newly constructed elementary school located on Fairchild Air Force Base near Spokane, Washington, was named Michael Anderson Elementary School. Anderson had attended fifth grade at Blair Elementary, the base's previous elementary school, while his father was stationed there. A mountain peak near Kit Carson Peak and Challenger Point in the <b>Sangre</b> <b>de</b> <b>Cristo</b> Range was renamed Columbia Point, and a dedication plaque {{was placed on the}} point in August, 2003. Seven dormitories were named in honor of Columbia crew members at the Florida Institute of Technology, Creighton University, The University of Texas at Arlington, and the Columbia Elementary School in the Brevard County School District. The Huntsville City Schools in Huntsville, Alabama, a city strongly associated with NASA, named their most recent high school Columbia High School as a memorial to the crew. A Department of Defense school in Guam was renamed Commander William C. McCool Elementary School. The City of Palmdale, California, the birthplace of the entire shuttle fleet, changed the name of the thoroughfare Avenue M to Columbia Way. In Avondale, Arizona, the Avondale Elementary School where Michael Anderson's sister worked had sent a T-shirt with him into space. It was supposed to have an assembly when he returned from space.
