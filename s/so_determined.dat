5|$|In 1529 the Chuj city of San Mateo Ixtatán (then {{known by}} the name of Ystapalapán) was given in encomienda to the conquistador Gonzalo de Ovalle, a {{companion}} of Pedro de Alvarado, together with Santa Eulalia and Jacaltenango. In 1549, the first reduction (reducción in Spanish) of San Mateo Ixtatán took place, overseen by Dominican missionaries, in the same year the Q'anjob'al reducción settlement of Santa Eulalia was founded. Further Q'anjob'al reducciones were in place at San Pedro Soloma, San Juan Ixcoy and San Miguel Acatán by 1560. Q'anjob'al resistance was largely passive, based on withdrawal to the inaccessible mountains and forests from the Spanish reducciones. In 1586 the Mercedarian Order built the first church in Santa Eulalia. The Chuj of San Mateo Ixtatán remained rebellious and resisted Spanish control for longer than their highland neighbours, resistance that was possible owing to their alliance with the lowland Lakandon Ch'ol to the north. The continued resistance was <b>so</b> <b>determined</b> that the Chuj remained pacified only while the immediate effects of the Spanish expeditions lasted.|$|E
5|$|In 1915, {{at a party}} held in Athens by court marshal Theodore Ypsilantis, Alexander became re-acquainted {{with one}} of his {{childhood}} friends, Aspasia Manos. She had just returned from education in France and Switzerland, and was reckoned as very beautiful by her acquaintances. She was the daughter of Constantine's Master of the Horse, Colonel Petros Manos, and his wife Maria Argyropoulos. The 21-year-old Alexander was smitten, and was <b>so</b> <b>determined</b> to seduce her that he followed her to the island of Spetses where she holidayed that year. Initially, Aspasia was resistant to his charm; although considered very handsome by his contemporaries, Alexander had a reputation as a ladies' man from numerous past liaisons. Despite this, he finally won her over, and the couple were engaged in secret. However, for King Constantine I, Queen Sophia and much of European society of the time, it was inconceivable for a royal prince to marry someone of a different social rank.|$|E
5|$|Willoughby {{appealed to}} Pym for {{assistance}} and Pym brought Sirius, Iphigenia and Magicienne to support Nereide, launching {{an assault on}} Grand Port on 23 August. Pym had failed to properly reconnoitre the channel and Duperré had had the warning buoys removed, so that Pym's squadron was blindly sailing into a complicated system of reefs and channels. Sirius and Magicienne were soon irretrievably grounded while Iphigenia struggled to find a passage {{and was unable to}} close with the French squadron. Only Nereide reached Duperré's line and Willoughby's initial attack was <b>so</b> <b>determined</b> that the entire French squadron was rapidly driven ashore, only Bellone remaining in a position to exchange fire with the British frigate. A fortunate shot from Bellone cut Nereides anchor cable and the British frigate swung around, presenting her stern to the French ships which raked her repeatedly. Willoughby managed to mitigate some of the effects by cutting the other anchor cable, which brought some of his guns within range of the French, but the balance of the battle had shifted. Over the next few hours his frigate was battered from the French ships and from guns ashore until she was a dismasted, battered hulk with over 220 of her crew killed or wounded.|$|E

The Oilers scored a grand total of 446 goals as a team, an NHL record. The Oilers were <b>so</b> <b>determined</b> to win the Stanley Cup that they hired Roger Neilson as a video analyst.

Written in modern prose, the episode relocates the story to contemporary London, where Katherine (Shirley Henderson) is an abrasive career politician who is told she must find a husband {{if she wants to}} become the party leader. Meanwhile, her supermodel sister Bianca (Jaime Murray) has fallen in love with Lucentio (Santiago Cabrera) and wants to marry him, but Bianca's manager, Harry (Stephen Tompkinson), has long believed she will marry him. To put him off, Bianca announces she will not marry until her sister is married (as she believes Katherine will never marry). Harry then arranges a meeting between his friend Petruchio (Rufus Sewell) and Katherine. Harry bets Petruchio that he {{will not be able to}} woo Katherine, <b>so,</b> <b>determined</b> to prove him wrong, Petruchio sets out to win her over. At the end of the episode, Katherine's 'submission' speech is triggered when Bianca is annoyed that Lucentio refuses to sign a pre-nuptial agreement. Katherine states it is a woman's duty to love and obey her husband, but with the requirement that he do precisely the same for her.

500|$|On 20 April, the {{commander}} of Greek forces in Albania—General Georgios Tsolakoglou—accepted the hopelessness {{of the situation and}} offered to surrender his army, which then consisted of fourteen divisions. [...] Generals Ioannis Pitsikas and Georgios Bakos had already warned General Papagos on 14 April that morale in the Epirus Army was wearing thin, and regrettably combat stress and exhaustion had resulted in officers taking the decision to put deserters before firing squads. Nevertheless, Papagos condemned Tsolakoglou for his decision to not continue fighting. General Blamey also criticized at the time, Tsolakoglou's decision to surrender without permission from General Papagos. Historian John Keegan writes that Tsolakoglou [...] "was <b>so</b> <b>determined...</b> to deny the Italians the satisfaction of a victory they had not earned that... he opened [...] quite unauthorised parley with {{the commander}} of the German SS division opposite him, Sepp Dietrich, to arrange a surrender to the Germans alone." [...] On strict orders from Hitler, negotiations were kept secret from the Italians and the surrender was accepted. [...] Outraged by this decision, Mussolini ordered counter-attacks against the Greek forces, which were repulsed, but at some cost to the defenders. The Germans Air Force intervened in the renewed fighting, and Ioannina was practically destroyed by Stukas. It took a personal representation from Mussolini to Hitler to organize Italian participation in the armistice that was concluded on 23 April. Greek soldiers were not rounded up as prisoners of war and were allowed instead to go home after the demobilisation of their units, while their officers were permitted to retain their side arms.|$|E

500|$|As {{part of her}} {{argument}} that women should not be overly influenced by their feelings, Wollstonecraft emphasises {{that they should not}} be constrained by or made slaves to their bodies or their sexual feelings. This particular argument has led many modern feminists to suggest that Wollstonecraft intentionally avoids granting women any sexual desire. Cora Kaplan argues that the [...] "negative and prescriptive assault on female sexuality" [...] is a [...] "leitmotif" [...] of the Rights of Woman. For example, Wollstonecraft advises her readers to [...] "calmly let passion subside into friendship" [...] in the ideal companionate marriage (that is, in the ideal of a love-based marriage that was developing at the time). It would be better, she writes, when [...] "two virtuous young people marry [...] [...] [...] if some circumstances checked their passion". According to Wollstonecraft, [...] "love and friendship cannot subsist in the same bosom". As Mary Poovey explains, [...] "Wollstonecraft betrays her fear that female desire might in fact court man's lascivious and degrading attentions, that the subordinate position women have been given might even be deserved. Until women can transcend their fleshly desires and fleshly forms, they will be hostage to the body." [...] If women are not interested in sexuality, they cannot be dominated by men. Wollstonecraft worries that women are consumed with [...] "romantic wavering", that is, they are interested only in satisfying their lusts. Because the Rights of Woman eliminates sexuality from a woman's life, Kaplan contends, it [...] "expresses a violent antagonism to the sexual" [...] {{while at the same time}} [...] "exaggerat the importance of the sensual in the everyday life of women". Wollstonecraft was <b>so</b> <b>determined</b> to wipe sexuality from her picture of the ideal woman that she ended up foregrounding it by insisting upon its absence. But as Kaplan and others have remarked, Wollstonecraft may have been forced to make this sacrifice: [...] "it is important to remember that the notion of woman as politically enabled and independent [...] fatally linked [...] to the unrestrained and vicious exercise of her sexuality." ...|$|E
