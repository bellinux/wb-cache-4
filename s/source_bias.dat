40|$|The {{application}} of Monte Carlo (MC) to large-scale fixed-source problems has recently become possible with new hybrid methods that automate generation of parameters for variance reduction techniques. Two common variance reduction techniques, weight windows and <b>source</b> <b>biasing,</b> have been automated and popularized by the consistent adjoint-driven importance sampling (CADIS) method. This method uses the adjoint solution from an inexpensive deterministic calculation {{to define a}} consistent set of weight windows and source particles for a subsequent MC calculation. One of the motivations for source consistency is to avoid the splitting or rouletting of particles at birth, which requires computational resources. However, {{it is not always}} possible or desirable to implement such consistency, which results in inconsistent <b>source</b> <b>biasing.</b> This paper develops an original framework that mathematically expresses the coupling of the weight window and <b>source</b> <b>biasing</b> techniques, allowing the authors to explore the impact of inconsistent source sampling on the variance of MC results. A numerical experiment supports this new framework and suggests that certain classes of problems may be relatively insensitive to inconsistent source sampling schemes with moderate levels of splitting and rouletting...|$|R

As recent reviews highlight, this heterogeneity makes likely that video games have {{both positive and}} negative consequences for child development. This study investigated the associations between gaming frequency and psychosocial health among children younger than 12 years of age, an understudied cohort in this field. Both parents and children reported children's gaming frequency, with parents also reporting on children's psychosocial health. Given that children may be too young to report the time they spend playing video games accurately, children's reports were scaffolded by a developmentally appropriate measure. We further investigated the potential bias of having parents report both their children's gaming frequency and their children's psychosocial health (i. e., a single <b>source</b> <b>bias).</b> Parental reports of children's gaming frequency were higher than their children's reports. However, a direct test of the potential single <b>source</b> <b>bias</b> rendered null results. Notably, however, while parental reports showed negative associations between gaming and psychosocial health, children's reports showed no associations. Specifically, based on parent reports, children's gaming was associated with more conduct and peer problems, and less prosocial behavior. As children's reports produced no associations between gaming and psychosocial health, parental reports in this study may belie an erroneous set of conclusions. We therefore caution against relying on just one reporter when assessing children's gaming frequency...|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} {{characterization}} of the local luminosity-color, bi-variate distribution of IRAS galaxies from the 1. 2 Jy sample, selected at 60 µm. The R(60, 100) infrared color is used as the best single parameter description of the IR spectral energy distribution of galaxies. We derive an analytical form of the distribution {{and use it to}} constrain the effect of the IR color distribution on evolution models for high redshift, farIR luminous galaxies. Our adopted evolution retains the locally observed correlation between luminosity and color, such that the larger characteristic luminosities at higher redshift have a warmer characteristic color. The width of the color distribution at a given luminosity remains constant for all redshifts. We demonstrate that there is the potential for both hotter and colder sources to be missed in cosmological surveys. An evolving bi-variate luminosity function coupled with the cold <b>source</b> <b>bias</b> of sub-mm selected surveys suggests the existence of a large population of cold sources appearing in such surveys. Likewise, a hot <b>source</b> <b>bias</b> for most SIRTF wavebands together with a bi-variate model suggests an excess of hot sources being selected. We test the evolutionary form against available data for higher redshift, farIR galaxies. The data do not reveal evidence for any strong evolution in the characteristic luminositycolor distribution as a function of redshift over 0 < z < 1. However, there is marginal evidence for a broadening of the color distribution at higher redshifts, consistent with our locally characterized trend of a broadening in the IR color distribution at the highest luminosities...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2011 Adjoint-derived weight {{windowing}} is {{a hybrid}} deterministic/Monte Carlo method to simulate radiation transport. In adjoint-derived weight windowing, a deterministic adjoint solution {{is used to}} create weight windows for a Monte Carlo simulation. The intent of this work is to identify factors that reduce the Figure of Merit (FOM) of Monte Carlo simulations using adjoint derived weight windowing. The method {{used in this study}} pairs Transpire's deterministic code Attila™ and MCNP 5. Two computationally difficult source/detector problems of interest to nuclear nonproliferation are used as case studies to determine the factors that affect the FOM. Test Case I is an active interrogation problem similar to many radiography problems. The model is used in two sets of trials: in the first, the quality of the deterministic adjoint solution is varied to observe the effect of adjoint solution quality on the FOM. In the second, the shielding density is varied to determine the effect of increased shielding on the FOM. Results from Test Case I suggest that weight windows that decrease monotonically along relevant paths from the source to the detector maximize the FOM. The results also suggest that weight windowing is susceptible to false convergence that could be avoided using a different hybrid method, such as the Local Importance Function Transform (LIFT). A more sophisticated method for generating weight windows relevant to the forward Monte Carlo simulation is described for future work. Test Case II is a detailed model of a detector array passively interrogating a uranium hexafluoride cylinder. Test Case II is used to test the effect of appropriate <b>source</b> <b>biasing</b> on the FOM. Results from Test Case II confirm prior work, that <b>source</b> <b>biasing</b> is important for problems in which the adjoint function varies widely in the source domain. Since spectral information from the detector is very useful for nonproliferation purposes, a new use of the forward weighted consistent adjoint driven importance sampling (FW-CADIS) method is described to model the energy-dependent flux in a region of interest. Properly modeling Test Case II also requires the use of rejection sampling of the source position paired with <b>source</b> <b>biasing,</b> which currently cannot be used together in MCNP 5. The new use for the FW-CADIS method and a method to allow the use of rejection sampling with <b>source</b> <b>biasing</b> are described for future work...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. This article {{reviews the}} {{significance}} of the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) to practitioners and researchers in clinical gerontology, more than 10 years after the scale was introduced to the scientific community. This report summarizes findings from the most relevant validation studies in which this self-report for assessing depression in elderly people has been tested. Included is discussion of the use of the GDS with specific populations (elderly medical inpatients, nursing home residents, and dementia populations), with description of the scale’s psychometric properties and its utility when used with them. This article also provides data {{on the use of the}} GDS from more recent studies, including additional information on psychometric properties, influence of <b>source</b> <b>bias,</b> and the international dissemination of the GDS. We conclude that the GDS is a relevant self-report for the assessment of depression in the elderly, given its advantage over other self-reports that are not as easily administered to this age group, its utility in the detection of depression, and its adequate psychometric properties. However, the GDS does not maintain its validity in demented populations because it fails to identify depression in persons with mild to moderate dementia. Finally, some suggestions for future research are made. Depression in old age is a topic that has produced a great aniount of literature that has substantially contributed to the improvement of the assessment process. The ambiguity of the definition of depression in old age, its differentiation from other disorders (e. g., dementia), and the role that other related factors play in the diagnosis (e. g., medication intake) have been identified as common problems that should be investigated. Difficulties regarding assessment procedures are as important as those previously mentioned. There is a fair amount of literature about the influence of <b>source</b> <b>bias</b> on self-report. However, the self-report (meaning source of information: self rather than informant) is more traditional at measuring depression than other assessment procedures, because the charac-teristics of depression are largely subjective (e. g., dysphoric mood) (Rehni...|$|E

Moreover, the effect did not depend on the MZI paths difference. We argue that these effects may be a new many-body manifestation of particle-wave duality of quantum mechanics. When biasing the interferometer sources beyond the linear response regime, quantum shot-noise (a particle phenomena) must affect the interference pattern of the electrons that creates it, as a result from a simple invariance argument. An approximate solution of the interacting Hamiltonian indeed shows that the interference visibility has a lobe pattern with applied bias with a period proportional to the average path length and independent of the paths difference, together with a phase rigidity.
