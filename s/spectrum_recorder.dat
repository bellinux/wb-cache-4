40|$|This {{article will}} focus on details of the Ka-band and X-band {{observations}} acquired during the May 1998 solar conjunction experiment at solar elongation angles below 3 deg. For the link study, the Ka-band data were recorded open loop using the full <b>spectrum</b> <b>recorder</b> (FSR), {{and most of the}} X-band data were obtained from the closed-loop Block V receivers of the operational Deep Space Network. In addition, a few selected passes were conducted where open-loop FSR data were recorded at X-band. Among the solar coronal e#ects on signal propagation presented will be intensity scintillation and spectral broadening. Also presented are frequency data results acquired using DSS 13 's experimental tone tracke...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—It is {{well known}} that planet Jupiter {{produces}} strong radio bursts at decametric wavelengths from regions of temporary radio emission in its magnetosphere. Like the man made radio signals, these signals do interfere in the low frequency radio telescope data while observing a different extraterrestrial source. Identification and characterization of this interfering signal is important in radio astronomy. In most of the radio astronomy sites, spectrum monitoring stations are available for such purposes. These instruments record any strong signal within the band and also aim to locate its position. Depending on the properties of different categories of sources, special modules can be attached to these instruments for obtaining a more detailed picture. These modules can be added at {{the front end of the}} instrument using a selector switch and can be connected whenever necessary. Construction of one such module for capturing and recording the Jupiter radio bursts has been described with all the engineering details. It consists of an antenna system followed a receiver (connected to a <b>spectrum</b> <b>recorder).</b> An improvement in the antenna system has been made as compared to the contemporarily available single antenna Jupiter radio telescopes, thereby enabling to record the radio emissions over a larger period using a fixed beam. The receiver system has been designed to process the low frequency Jovian signals from 18 to 25 MHz. The back end is that of a spectrum monitoring system which serves as an automated data analyzer and 128 Joardar and Bhattacharya recorder. It offers flexibility and various setup choices to the user. The mathematical analysis of the instrument and computed system characteristics have been produced in detail for ease of reproductions, direct use in radio astronomy and future design developments. 1...|$|E

30|$|X-ray powder {{diffraction}} (XRD) {{patterns were}} collected with an X′ Pert Pro diffractometer (Cu Kα radiation; λ[*]=[*] 0.15418  nm, operation voltage 40  kV, current 40  mA). A JEM- 2010 {{transmission electron microscope}} (TEM) was performed to observe the morphology and microstructure of various products. X-ray photoelectron spectroscope (XPS) analysis was performed on an Axis Ultra multifunctional X-ray photoelectron spectrometer, using Al Kα excitation radiation (hv[*]=[*] 1486.6  eV). Raman <b>spectra</b> were <b>recorder</b> on a Renishaw inVia spectrometer, laser excitation light at 532  nm. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential thermal analysis (DTA) were conducted with a DSC 6200 thermal analyzer at the scanning rate of 10  °C/min. A JF- 3 oxygen index meter was employed to measure the LOI values of the specimens with dimensions of 100 [*]×[*] 6.5 [*]×[*] 3  mm 3. A WDW- 10 D microcomputer control electronic universal testing machine (Jinan Test Machine Company Limited; Jinan, China) was performed to determine the tensile strength of PVC-matrix composites. Cone calorimeter (Fire Testing Technology, UK) tests were conducted following the procedures described in ISO 5660. Each specimen with the dimensions of 100 [*]×[*] 100 [*]×[*] 3  mm 3 was exposed to 35  kW/m 2 heat flux. The dispersion state of the additives in PVC matrix and the topography of residue chars were observed with a Nova Nano SEM 450 scanning electron microscope (SEM). An UV accelerated weathering tester (UV-II, Shanghai Pushen Chemical Machinery Co. Ltd.; Shanghai, China) was run to evaluate the photocatalytic degradation behavior of the rectangular PVC-matrix nanocomposite film (size 7.5  cm[*]×[*] 15  cm) under 45  °C and 40 % humidity.|$|R
50|$|New tape {{formulations}} were introduced. Chromium dioxide (referred to as CrO2 or Type II) was {{the first}} tape designed for extended high frequency response, but it required higher bias. Later, as the IEC Type II standard was defined, a different equalization settings was also mandated to reduce hiss, thus giving up some extension {{at the high end}} of the audio <b>spectrum.</b> Better-quality cassette <b>recorders</b> soon appeared with a switch for the tape type. Later decks incorporated coded holes in the shell to autodetect the tape type. Chromium dioxide tape was thought to cause increased wear on the heads, so TDK and Maxell adapted cobalt-doped ferric formulations to mimic CrO2. Sony briefly tried FerriChrome (Type III) which claimed to combine the best of both; some people, however, stated that the reverse was true because the Cr top layer seemed to wear off quickly, reducing this type to Fe in practice. Most recent decks produce the best response and dynamic headroom with metal tapes (IEC Type IV) which require still higher bias for recording, though they will play back correctly at the II setting since the equalization is the same.|$|R
