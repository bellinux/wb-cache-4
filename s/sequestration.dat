5|$|Among the {{important}} botanical {{questions of the}} 21st century are the role of plants as primary producers in the global cycling of life's basic ingredients: energy, carbon, oxygen, nitrogen and water, and ways that our plant stewardship can help address the global environmental issues of resource management, conservation, human food security, biologically invasive organisms, carbon <b>sequestration,</b> climate change, and sustainability.|$|E
5|$|NuScale is {{expected}} to be the first SMR to market, because its cooling is similar to the systems used in conventional power plants. However, alternative cooling systems using molten metals are expected to operate at higher, more efficient temperatures once approved. The company estimates a twelve-unit NuScale plant would cost $5,000 per kilowatt. In comparison, the Energy Information Administration in 2011 estimated costs to be $4,700 per kilowatt for conventional nuclear power, $4,600 for a carbon <b>sequestration</b> coal plant and $931 at a gas-fired plant or in excess of $1,800 for a gas-fired plant with carbon <b>sequestration.</b> David Mohre, executive director of NRECA's Energy and Power Division, said SMR's like NuScale's are ideal for rural towns that need small power plants and do not have access to natural gas. NuScale power plants are also expected to take less time, materials and space to construct than other power sources and can be expanded incrementally to meet changing power needs.|$|E

They may also be attractive sites for deep-sea fishing, and extraction of oil and gas and other minerals. Future deep-sea waste disposal activities that could be significant by 2025 include emplacement of sewage and sludge, carbon-dioxide <b>sequestration,</b> and disposal of dredge spoils.|$|E
5|$|Johnnetta Cole, an {{anthropologist}} {{and former president}} of Spelman and Bennett College, became the museum's director in 2009. Her tenure became associated with a controversial 2015 exhibit that featured works from comedian Bill Cosby's private collection just as allegations of sexual assault against him became public. Two years earlier, the 2013 federal budget <b>sequestration</b> closed one of the museum's permanent exhibitions. Cole retired in March 2017 and will be succeeded by British filmmaker and curator Gus Casely-Hayford in February 2018.|$|E

5|$|On 29 July 2013, Army Chief of Staff General Ray Odierno {{warned that}} the Ground Combat Vehicle program might be delayed or {{possibly}} even cancelled because of the <b>sequestration</b> budget cuts. Although he specifically said it could be delayed, he did {{not rule out the}} possibility of cancellation. The GCV was high-priority for the Army to give better protection than the M2 Bradley, but because of the sequester cuts everything was being considered. On 1 August 2013, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel outlined two basic results if the effects of <b>sequestration</b> continued: modernization programs like the GCV would be cut to maintain troop levels, or high-end capability efforts like the GCV would be preserved to continue modernization and keep equipment technologically advanced with troop levels being cut. Odierno was committed to balancing soldiers, readiness, and modernization, and was intent on the need for the Ground Combat Vehicle. Suggested alternative options, such as further upgrading the Bradley and buying currently available infantry fighting vehicles like the German Puma, were recommended as cost-saving measures. Army leaders said the Puma's low troop-carrying capacity would require buying five vehicles to replace every four Bradleys, and that upgrading the Bradley would essentially be engineering a new vehicle. While these options would offer no improvement over the fleet's current capability, not pursuing the GCV would allow the money to be spent elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|Sales {{of country}} estates became common around the 1920s. The annual tax payable had spiralled and was twenty {{times greater than}} in 1870 {{resulting}} in the break-up of many larger land-holdings. Pitfour was no exception and the dispersal of the estate continued piecemeal after the <b>sequestration</b> of George Arthur, the sixth laird. The main estate policies including the lake and other land were purchased by Bernard Drake in November 1926 when he bought Saplinbrae, the former minister's house. Drake was {{a partner in the}} electrical engineering company, Drake and Gorham.|$|E
5|$|Shakur's {{attorneys}} {{sought a}} new trial {{on the grounds that}} one jury member, John McGovern, had violated the jury's <b>sequestration</b> order. Judge Appleby rejected Kunstler's claim that the juror had violated the order. McGovern later sued Kunstler for defamation; Kunstler eventually publicly apologized to McGovern and paid him a small settlement. Additionally, in his autobiography, Kunstler alleged that he later learned from a law enforcement agent that a New Jersey State Assembly member had addressed the jury at the hotel where they were sequestered, urging them to convict Shakur.|$|E

5|$|The {{trial judge}} has an {{obligation}} to ensure an impartial jury, especially vis-a-vis juror biases and media coverage by such means as jury selection (including voir dire and for-cause challenges), jury <b>sequestration,</b> and jury instructions. For example, this may require the court to permit voir dire {{on the subject of the}} juror's potential racial prejudice. In some circumstances, the Sixth Amendment even requires the trial judge to grant a defendant's change of venue motion if an impartial jury cannot be obtained otherwise.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{legislative}} session, Beshear began to address his agenda related to energy production. In April 2008, {{he announced that}} he would divide the state's Environmental and Public Protection Cabinet to form a new Energy and Environmental Cabinet. The move essentially reversed the consolidation of Environmental, Public Protection, and Labor Cabinets effected under Beshear's predecessor, Ernie Fletcher. Later in the year, Beshear released what he called the state's first-ever comprehensive energy plan. The plan called for expansion of solar, wind, and biomass energy generation, as well as more speculative ventures such as coal gasification and carbon capture and <b>sequestration.</b> Although the plan called for an exploration of the use of nuclear power, Beshear stopped short of advocating an end to the state's ban on the construction of nuclear reactors.|$|E
5|$|Henry quickly took {{revenge on}} his enemies after the Battle of Evesham. He {{immediately}} ordered the <b>sequestration</b> {{of all the}} rebel lands, triggering a wave of chaotic looting across the country. Henry initially rejected any calls for moderation, but in October 1266 he was persuaded by the Papal Legate, Ottobuono de' Fieschi, to issue a less draconian policy, called the Dictum of Kenilworth, which allowed {{for the return of}} the rebels' lands, in exchange for the payment of harsh fines. The Statute of Marlborough followed in November 1267, which effectively reissued much of the Provisions of Westminster, placing limitations on the powers of local royal officials and the major barons, but without restricting central royal authority. Most of the exiled Poitevins began to return to England after the war. In September 1267 Henry made the Treaty of Montgomery with Llywelyn, recognising him as the Prince of Wales and giving substantial land concessions.|$|E

5|$|In 2013, <b>sequestration</b> {{budget cuts}} {{cast doubt on}} the USAF's ability to {{complete}} the Combat Avionics Programmed Extension Suite (CAPES), a part of secondary programs such as Taiwan's F-16 upgrade. ACC's General Mike Hostage stated that if he only had money for SLEP (service life extension program) or CAPES, he would fund SLEP to keep the aircraft flying. Lockheed Martin responded to talk of CAPES cancellation with a fixed-price upgrade package for foreign users. CAPES {{was not included in the}} Pentagon's 2015 budget request. The USAF said that the upgrade package will still be offered to Taiwan, and Lockheed said that some common elements with the F-35 will keep the radar's unit costs down. In 2014 the USAF issued a RFI to SLEP 300 F-16 C/Ds.|$|E
5|$|In {{reviewing}} {{the sweep of}} botanical history it is evident that, {{through the power of}} the scientific method, most of the basic questions concerning the structure and function of plants have, in principle, been resolved. Now the distinction between pure and applied botany becomes blurred as our historically accumulated botanical wisdom at all levels of plant organisation is needed (but especially at the molecular and global levels) to improve human custodianship of planet earth. The most urgent unanswered botanical questions now relate to the role of plants as primary producers in the global cycling of life's basic ingredients: energy, carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen, and ways that our plant stewardship can help address the global environmental issues of resource management, conservation, human food security, biologically invasive organisms, carbon <b>sequestration,</b> climate change, and sustainability.|$|E
5|$|Reports {{suggest that}} {{imbalance}} of brain metal homeostasis {{may be a}} cause of PrPSc-associated neurotoxicity, though the underlying mechanisms are difficult to explain based on existing information. Proposed hypotheses include a functional role for PrPC in metal metabolism, and loss of this function due to aggregation to the disease-associated PrPSc form {{as the cause of}} brain metal imbalance. Other views suggest gain of toxic function by PrPSc due to <b>sequestration</b> of PrPC-associated metals within the aggregates, resulting in the generation of redox-active PrPSc complexes. The physiological implications of some PrPC-metal interactions are known, while others are still unclear. The pathological implications of PrPC-metal interaction include metal-induced oxidative damage, and in some instances conversion of PrPC to a PrPSc-like form.|$|E

5|$|The {{first three}} lairds {{transformed}} the estate into a valuable asset. Lord Pitfour, the second laird, purchased additional lands including Deer Abbey and Inverugie Castle. Pitfour's son, James Ferguson, {{who became the}} third laird, continued to improve and expand the estate by adding the lake and bridges, and establishing planned villages. The third laird died a bachelor with no children, so the estate passed to the elderly George Ferguson, who was only in possession of the property for a few months. George was already a wealthy man, owning lands in Trinidad and Tobago, but despite not directly improving the Pitfour estate he added considerable value to the inheritance passed to his illegitimate son. The extravagant lifestyles of the fifth and sixth lairds led to the <b>sequestration</b> of the estate, which was sold off piecemeal to pay their debts.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanism}} that {{is thought to}} have a significant influence on delayed effects involves formed blood cells and chemical mediators, which cause brain lipid peroxidation (degradation of unsaturated fatty acids). Carbon monoxide causes endothelial cell and platelet release of nitric oxide, and the formation of oxygen free radicals including peroxynitrite. In the brain this causes further mitochondrial dysfunction, capillary leakage, leukocyte <b>sequestration,</b> and apoptosis. The result of these effects is lipid peroxidation, which causes delayed reversible demyelinization of white matter in the central nervous system known as Grinker myelinopathy, which can lead to edema and necrosis within the brain. This brain damage occurs mainly during the recovery period. This may result in cognitive defects, especially affecting memory and learning, and movement disorders. These disorders are typically related to damage to the cerebral white matter and basal ganglia. Hallmark pathological changes following poisoning are bilateral necrosis of the white matter, globus pallidus, cerebellum, hippocampus and the cerebral cortex.|$|E

Disregarding the controversy about lesion nomenclature and classification, it is widely accepted that congenital lung lesions result from perturbations in lung and airway embryogenesis. It is generally accepted that both place (level in the tracheobronchial tree) and timing (gestational age) of the embryologic insult correlates with the type of lesion and histopathology that is manifested. The objective of this review is to briefly review normal lung development and to analyze the known molecular mechanisms underlying those diseases...|$|R
