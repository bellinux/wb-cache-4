5|$|Cultured mysids {{are thought}} to provide an ideal food source for many marine organisms. They are often fed to cephalopods, fish larvae, and {{commercial}} farmed shrimp due to their small size and low cost. Their high protein and fat content also makes them a good alternative to live enriched Artemia when feeding juveniles (especially those {{that are difficult to}} maintain such as young <b>seahorses)</b> and other small fauna.|$|E
5|$|At Fontainebleau, Catherine {{arranged}} entertainments {{that lasted}} for several days, including fancy-dress jousting and chivalrous events in allegorical settings. On Mardi Gras, {{the day after the}} banquet in the meadow, knights dressed as Greeks and Trojans fought over scantily clad damsels trapped by a giant and a dwarf in a tower on an enchanted island. The fighting climaxed with the tower losing its magical properties and bursting into flames. In another spectacle, singing sirens swam past the king, and Neptune floated by in a chariot drawn by <b>seahorses.</b>|$|E

5|$|Tiktaalik {{generally}} had {{the characteristics}} of a lobe-finned fish, but with front fins featuring arm-like skeletal structures more akin to those of a crocodile, including a shoulder, elbow, and wrist. The fossil discovered in 2004 did not include the rear fins and tail. It had rows of sharp teeth indicative of a predator fish, and its neck could move independently of its body, which is not common in other fish (Tarrasius, Mandageria, placoderms, and extant <b>seahorses</b> being some exceptions; see also Lepidogalaxias and Channallabes apus). The animal had a flat skull resembling a crocodile's; eyes on top of its head, suggesting that it {{spent a lot of time}} looking up; a neck and ribs similar to those of tetrapods, with the ribs being used to support its body and aid in breathing via lungs; well developed jaws suitable for catching prey; and a small gill slit called a spiracle that, in more derived animals, became an ear.|$|E

50|$|<b>Seahorse</b> ROUV program {{begun in}} 2008 and Professor Ma Xia-Fei (马厦飞) is the program manager, {{and the general}} {{designers}} of <b>Seahorse</b> ROUV are Professor Lian Lian (连琏) and Professor Ren Ping (任平). <b>Seahorse</b> ROUV is designed to dive to a maximum depth of forty-five hundred meters, and from April 20, 2014 thru April 22, 2014, <b>Seahorse</b> UAV conducted more than seventeen dives in three different phases of sea trial, reaching the maximum designed depth to 4502 meter. After the successful sea trials, state certification is received soon after, and there are plans to develop different models based on the original <b>Seahorse.</b> <b>Seahorse</b> ROUV is designed to perform a variety of research missions and it is equipped with sonar, cameras, mechanical arms, {{and in addition to}} research missions, <b>Seahorse</b> ROUV is also capable of performing maintenance work on scientific equipment on seabed. <b>Seahorse</b> utilizes modular design concept to enable different tools to be replaced rapidly based on mission needs while sharing a common chassis. During deployment, <b>Seahorse</b> ROUV is usually carried by Chinese scientific research vessel Ocean 6 (Hai-Yang or Haiyang 6, 海洋6号), though it can also be carried by other Chinese ships equipped to handle ROUVs.|$|R

25|$|Concerns {{have also}} arisen {{over the use}} of {{pangolin}} scales, turtle plastron, <b>seahorses,</b> and the gill plates of mobula and manta rays. Poachers hunt restricted or endangered species animals to supply the black market with TCM products. There is no scientific evidence of efficacy for tiger medicines. Concern over China considering to legalize the trade in tiger parts prompted the 171-nation Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) to endorse a decision opposing the resurgence of trade in tigers. Fewer than 30,000 saiga antelopes remain, which are exported to China for use in traditional fever therapies. Organized gangs illegally export the horn of the antelopes to China. The pressures on <b>seahorses</b> (Hippocampus spp.) used in traditional medicine is enormous; tens of millions of animals are unsustainably caught annually. Many species of syngnathid are currently part of the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species or national equivalents.|$|E
25|$|Parts of {{endangered}} species used as TCM drugs include tiger bones and rhinoceros horn. Poachers supply the black market with such substances, and the black market in rhinoceros horn, for example, has reduced the world's rhino population by more than 90 {{percent over the past}} 40 years. Concerns have also arisen over the use of turtle plastron and <b>seahorses.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Seahorses</b> fourth war patrol was {{conducted}} in the Marianas. She departed Pearl Harbor on 16 March and intercepted a large enemy convoy on 8 April. After nightfall, the submarine launched four torpedoes at overlapping targets, sinking the converted seaplane tender, Aratama Maru. Shortly thereafter, her second spread of torpedoes sank the cargo ship, Kizugawa Maru. Although a counterattack by escorting destroyers drove the submarine from the vicinity, she quickly regained contact and continued the chase into the following day, sinking the cargo ship, Bisaku Maru.|$|E
2500|$|In August 1809, Charles Baudin, {{recently}} {{promoted to}} Lieutenant, {{was appointed to}} command Renard. On 22 August 1810, while cruising off Tuscany with the brig Ligurie, under Lieutenant Serra, Renard encountered the frigate HMS <b>Seahorse.</b> Renard, the better sailor of the two, allowed <b>Seahorse</b> to chase her while Ligurie sought her escape by sailing close to shore. After a while, Renard and <b>Seahorse</b> found themselves becalmed; when the wind returned, it was to favour <b>Seahorse,</b> and Renard narrowly avoided capture by catching a breeze and running into the Gulf of La Spezia, eventually beaching herself while a storm broke out. As good weather returned, so did <b>Seahorse,</b> and Renard had to endure her bombardment until the evening, although she did not sustain serious damage. <b>Seahorse</b> departed {{in the evening and}} Renard, refloated, limped back to Genoa. En route, Renard again met <b>Seahorse,</b> but sought refuge under the shore batteries of Levanto which, although in bad shape, proved sufficient to deter the frigate.|$|R
5000|$|The knobby <b>seahorse</b> or short-head <b>seahorse</b> (not to be {{confused}} with the Short-snouted <b>seahorse),</b> Hippocampus breviceps, is a species of fish in the Syngnathidae family. It is endemic to Australia. Its natural habitats are open seas, shallow seas, subtidal aquatic beds, coral reefs, estuarine waters, intertidal flats, coastal saline lagoons, and karsts.|$|R
25|$|The Japanese <b>seahorse</b> (in Japanese, kitano-umi-uma and sangotatsu) or lemur-tail <b>seahorse</b> (Hippocampus mohnikei) is {{a species}} of fish in the Syngnathidae family. The Japanese <b>seahorse</b> reaches a maximum length of 8.0cm, is usually dark brown and has a {{relatively}} long tail, a ridgelike coronet and flattened spines. Many <b>seahorse</b> species look similar, so in addition to any distinguishing features, individual specimens are identified using a series of specific measurements and counts of anatomical features such as spines and tail rings.|$|R
25|$|Male {{pregnancy}} is the incubation {{of one or}} more embryos or fetuses by male members of some species. In nearly all heterogamous animal species, offspring are ordinarily carried by the female until birth, but in fish of the Syngnathidae family (pipefish, <b>seahorses</b> and the leafy seadragon), males perform this function. There are different ideas concerning whether a human male could become pregnant, and, by some definitions of gender identity, humans that identify as men have become pregnant. Male humans incubating fetuses are also a recurring theme in speculative fiction.|$|E
25|$|Some copepods have {{extremely}} fast escape responses when {{a predator}} is sensed, and can jump with high speed {{over a few}} millimetres. Many species have neurons surrounded by myelin (for increased conduction speed), which is very rare among invertebrates (other examples are some annelids and malacostracan crustaceans like palaemonid shrimp and penaeids). Even rarer, the myelin is highly organized, resembling the well-organized wrapping found in vertebrates (Gnathostomata). Despite their fast escape response, copepods are successfully hunted by slow-swimming <b>seahorses,</b> which approach their prey so gradually, it senses no turbulence, then suck the copepod into their snout too suddenly for the copepod to escape.|$|E
25|$|Ian Brown, John Squire and Mani {{have all}} had {{successful}} careers since the Roses' breakup. Squire formed The <b>Seahorses,</b> who released one album before breaking up, {{as well as}} releasing two solo albums. In 2007 he told a reporter that he was giving up music for good to focus on {{his career as a}} painter. Brown has released six solo albums, a remixes and a greatest hits collection all but one of which have charted in the top 5 of the UK Albums Chart. Mani joined Primal Scream as bassist in 1996 and remained in the band until the Stone Roses reunited.|$|E

50|$|The dwarf <b>seahorse</b> only {{reaches up}} to 5 cm {{in length and}} is not an {{aggressive}} feeder. Therefore, it is typically kept in small aquariums (20 to 40 L). The dwarf <b>seahorse</b> can be fed brine shrimp nauplii, although it will also eat copepods and other shrimp larvae. Because of its short digestive tract, food must be available to them all day, making it a difficult species to keep. Unlike most marine fish, it will readily breed in the aquarium. The <b>seahorse</b> fry can be kept in the same aquarium as the adults in a dwarf <b>seahorse</b> dedicated tank. The dwarf <b>seahorse</b> has a gestation period of 10-14 days and can live up to over 2 years in captivity.|$|R
50|$|The spiny <b>seahorse</b> (Hippocampus histrix), also {{referred}} to as the thorny <b>seahorse,</b> is a marine fish belonging to the Syngnathidae family, native from the Indo-Pacific area.|$|R
