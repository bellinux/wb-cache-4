5|$|In 1937, Heikkinen won the {{starting}} job at right guard, but the team finished 44, and were outscored by opponents 11054. They were <b>soundly</b> defeated by Minnesota, 396, and Ohio State, 210.|$|E
5|$|After {{spending}} {{a decade in}} the state legislature, Slaughter was elected the fourth Lieutenant Governor, serving under Charles Scott. With the War of 1812 looming {{at the end of}} his tenure, Slaughter ran for governor against Isaac Shelby, the state's first governor and a noted military leader. Shelby beat Slaughter <b>soundly.</b> Four years later, Slaughter was again elected as lieutenant governor, serving under George Madison.|$|E
5|$|Another pet project Johnson {{supported}} {{was prompted}} by his friendship with John Cleves Symmes, Jr., who proposed that the Earth was hollow. In 1823, Johnson proposed in the Senate that the government fund an expedition {{to the center of}} the Earth. The proposal was <b>soundly</b> defeated, receiving only twenty-five votes in the House and Senate combined.|$|E
5|$|During {{the summer}} of 1836, Congress {{proposed}} a compromise whereby Michigan gave up its claim to the strip in exchange for its statehood and approximately three-quarters of the Upper Peninsula. The compromise was considered a poor outcome for Michigan. Voters in a state convention in September <b>soundly</b> rejected the proposal.|$|E
5|$|Karl Ernst Adolf Anderssen (July 6, 1818 – March 13, 1879) was a German chess master. He is {{considered}} {{to have been the}} world's leading chess player for much of the 1850s and 1860s. He was quite <b>soundly</b> defeated by Paul Morphy who toured Europe in 1858, but Morphy retired from chess soon after and Anderssen was again considered the leading player.|$|E
5|$|When Bellingham {{received}} {{news of his}} forthcoming trial {{he asked}} Harmer to arrange {{for him to be}} represented in court by Brougham and Peter Alley, the latter an Irish lawyer with a reputation for flamboyance. Confident of his acquittal, Bellingham refused to discuss the case further with Harmer, and spent the afternoon and evening making notes. After drinking a glass of porter, he went to bed and slept <b>soundly.</b>|$|E
5|$|Aberhart's {{government}} was re-elected in the 1940 election with a reduced majority of 36 of 63 seats. Among the defeated incumbents were dissident leader Brown, the convicted Unwin, the expelled Barnes, and the Provincial Treasurer Low. Aberhart won re-election by running in Calgary; his replacement as Social Credit candidate in Okotoks–High River was <b>soundly</b> defeated. Aberhart died in 1943 {{and was replaced}} as Premier by Ernest Manning, who steered the Social Credit League in a more conservative and conventional direction until his 1968 retirement.|$|E
5|$|However, lacking {{requested}} reinforcements from McClellan, now {{commanding the}} Army of the Potomac, Pope was <b>soundly</b> defeated at the Second Battle of Bull Run {{in the summer}} of 1862, forcing the Army of the Potomac to defend Washington for a second time. The war also expanded with naval operations in 1862 when the CSS Virginia, formerly the USS Merrimack, damaged or destroyed three Union vessels in Norfolk, Virginia, before being engaged and damaged by the USS Monitor. Lincoln closely reviewed the dispatches and interrogated naval officers during their clash in the Battle of Hampton Roads.|$|E
5|$|In February 1828, {{shortly before}} his 41st birthday, Etty <b>soundly</b> {{defeated}} John Constable by 18 votes to five to become a full Royal Academician, {{at the time the}} highest honour available to an artist. By this time, complaints about his supposed indecency were beginning to resurface. All but one of the 15 paintings Etty exhibited at the Royal Academy in the 1820s had included at least one nude figure, and Etty was acquiring a reputation for using respectable themes as a pretext for nudity.|$|E
5|$|On 1 October Welensky was <b>soundly</b> {{defeated}} by his RF opponent, with 633 votes to Dupont's 1079. In December he resigned {{the leadership of}} his party. When the RF declared unilateral independence on 11 November 1965, Welensky was upset at the constitutional break with Britain. He believed that Rhodesia was entitled to her independence, and disagreed with the British government's demand for 'no independence before majority rule', but was opposed to illegal action.|$|E
5|$|On March 3, the Texians {{watched from}} the walls as {{approximately}} 1,000 Mexicans marched into Béxar. The Mexican army celebrated loudly throughout the afternoon, both in honor of their reinforcements and at the news that troops under General José de Urrea had <b>soundly</b> defeated Texian Colonel Frank W. Johnson at the Battle of San Patricio on February 27. Most of the Texians in the Alamo believed that Sesma had been leading the Mexican forces during the siege, and they mistakenly attributed the celebration {{to the arrival of}} Santa Anna. The reinforcements brought the number of Mexican soldiers in Béxar to almost 3,100.|$|E
5|$|Prohibited by the Kentucky Constitution from {{succeeding}} {{himself as}} lieutenant governor, Slaughter {{ran for governor}} of Kentucky in 1812. The impending war with England, however, drew military hero and former governor Isaac Shelby into the race. Despite Shelby's immense popularity, Slaughter refused {{to withdraw from the}} race and was <b>soundly</b> beaten by more than a two-to-one margin. Following his defeat, Slaughter took a two-year hiatus from public life, and engaged in farming at his estate in Mercer County.|$|E
5|$|The devastation in Dobrudzha at {{the hands}} of the Magyars {{indicated}} how vulnerable Bulgaria was to attacks from the north under the influence of the Byzantine diplomacy. That experience paid off well in 917, when Simeon managed to counter the Byzantine efforts to ally with the Serbs or the Pechenegs, and forced them to fight alone in the battle of Achelous, where the Byzantines were <b>soundly</b> defeated in one of the biggest disasters in Byzantine history.|$|E
5|$|The {{election}} for the Legislative Assembly held on 2 April 1955 was a lively and closely fought affair, with several new political parties joining the fray. Unlike previous elections, voters were automatically registered, expanding the electorate to around 300,000. The SPP was <b>soundly</b> {{defeated in the}} election, winning only four seats. The newly formed, left-leaning Labour Front was the biggest winner with ten seats and it formed a coalition government with the UMNO-MCA Alliance, which won three seats. Another new party, the leftist People's Action Party (PAP), won three seats.|$|E
5|$|Winning 52 games, the Pistons comfortably {{entered the}} 1987 NBA Playoffs. They swept the Washington Bullets and <b>soundly</b> beat the Atlanta Hawks in five games, but bowed out in seven matches against the archrival Boston Celtics {{in what was}} {{called one of the}} {{physically}} and mentally toughest series ever. Rodman feuded with Celtics guard Dennis Johnson and taunted Johnson in the closing seconds when he waved his right hand over his own head. When the Celtics took Game Seven, Johnson went back at Rodman in the last moments of the game and mimicked his taunting gesture.|$|E
5|$|After Thermopylae, all of Boeotia and Attica {{fell to the}} Persian army, which {{captured}} and burnt Athens. However, a larger Allied army fortified the narrow Isthmus of Corinth, protecting the Peloponnesus from Persian conquest. Both sides thus sought a naval victory that might decisively alter {{the course of the}} war. The Athenian general Themistocles succeeded in luring the Persian navy into the narrow Straits of Salamis, where the huge number of Persian ships became disorganised, and were <b>soundly</b> beaten by the Allied fleet. The Allied victory at Salamis prevented a quick conclusion to the invasion, and fearing becoming trapped in Europe, Xerxes retreated to Asia leaving his general Mardonius to finish the conquest with the elite of the army.|$|E
5|$|As the Democratic Convention of 1860 approached, some asked Pierce {{to run as}} a {{compromise}} candidate that could unite the fractured party, but Pierce refused. As Douglas struggled to attract southern support, Pierce backed Cushing and then Breckinridge as potential alternatives, but his priority was a united Democratic Party. The split Democrats were <b>soundly</b> defeated for the presidency by the Republican candidate, Lincoln. In the months between Lincoln's election, and his inauguration on March 4, 1861, Pierce looked on as several southern states began plans to secede. He was asked by Justice Campbell to travel to Alabama and address that state's secession convention. Due to illness he declined, but sent a letter appealing {{to the people of}} Alabama to remain in the Union, and give the North time to repeal laws against southern interests and to find common ground.|$|E
5|$|Blaine {{spent the}} summer of 1892 at his Bar Harbor cottage, and did not involve himself in the presidential {{campaign}} other than to make a single speech in New York in October. Harrison was defeated <b>soundly</b> in his rematch against former president Cleveland and when Blaine returned to Washington at the close of 1892, he and Harrison were friendlier than they had been in years. Blaine’s health declined rapidly in the winter of 1892–1893, and he died in his Washington home on January 27, 1893. After a funeral at the Presbyterian Church of the Covenant, he was buried in Oak Hill Cemetery in Washington. He was later re-interred in Blaine Memorial Park, Augusta, Maine, in 1920.|$|E
5|$|Cross ran as a Liberal in the 1925 federal {{election}} in the riding of Athabaska, and defeated Donald Ferdinand Kellner, the Progressive incumbent from Edmonton East. Stewart, who had also left provincial politics, was elected in the adjacent Edmonton West. The Liberals, under incumbent Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King, won fewer seats than the Conservatives, but King decided to remain as Prime Minister anyway. As a result, Cross sat in the Canadian House of Commons throughout the King-Byng Affair. In the ensuing 1926 election, Cross was <b>soundly</b> defeated in a rematch with Kellner. Charles Wilson Cross {{died of a heart}} attack June 2, 1928, in Calgary.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{claiming}} the premiership in 1945, Eastern Suburbs {{failed to make}} the finals for the following seven seasons. A runners-up finish in 1960 was the closest the club came to {{claiming the}} premiership during this era. Eastern Suburbs were <b>soundly</b> defeated 31–6 in the grand final that year, by the famous record-beating St George outfit. In 1966, the club fell to new depths and was winless {{for the first time in}} its history. It was also the last occasion in which the Roosters won the wooden spoon until claiming it again in the 2009 season. It ended a poor run for Eastern Suburbs; from 1963 to 1966, they won 8 of 72 matches, finishing second to last in 1964 and last in the other three years. The club underwent a renaissance in 1967 after appointing Jack Gibson as coach (1967–68), and introducing a new emblem on the playing jerseys, the rooster.|$|E
5|$|During the 1973–1975 biennium, {{pressure}} {{was put on}} Kappa Kappa Psi chapters by their host institutions to admit women to comply with Title IX. The issue was again brought up at the 1975 national convention, and a joint committee consisting of {{an equal number of}} members from Kappa Kappa Psi and Tau Beta Sigma was formed to explore the legal possibilities of a corporate merger of the two organizations, with the results of their investigation to be read at the 1977 convention. At the 1977 national convention, votes were cast by the Kappa Kappa Psi and Tau Beta Sigma delegations for a merger—Kappa Kappa Psi voted 211 against, 9 for; Tau Beta Sigma voted 104 against, 4 for. With the idea of a merger <b>soundly</b> defeated, the delegation voted to remove all references to gender from the constitution, allowing women to become active members in full and regular standing.|$|E
5|$|Gloucestershire {{went over}} the Pennines to Sheffield and began the next game against Yorkshire at Bramall Lane on Monday, 29 July. Gloucestershire were <b>soundly</b> beaten by 244 runs, a big margin at the time. Yorkshire scored 158 and 360; Gloucestershire scored 201 to claim a good first innings lead but were then bowled out for 73 and crashed to a heavy defeat. Grace batted quite well, scoring 62 and 35. With the ball, he took 2–48 and 4–128. They were undone by the bowling of Billy Bates who took 11 wickets in the match, {{including}} 7–38 in the second innings; while George Ulyett and Ephraim Lockwood both scored centuries in Yorkshire's second innings. The match was played {{for the benefit of}} Tom Emmett, who received £616 13s 1d.|$|E
5|$|In 1297 he {{accompanied}} Edward I on {{a campaign}} to Flanders, and {{seems to have been}} knighted by this time. With his French connections he was in the following years a valuable diplomat in France for the English King. He also served as military commander in occupied Scotland. In 1298 at Blackearnside, a forest of alders, to the east of the village of Newburgh in Fife, he suffered an ignominious defeat from a force commanded by Wallace, Guardian of Scotland. In 1306 at the Battle of Methven, he won the day over Robert the Bruce only to be <b>soundly</b> defeated by Bruce at Loudoun Hill the next year.|$|E
5|$|In June 1844, the Senate, {{with its}} Whig majority, <b>soundly</b> {{rejected}} the Tyler–Texas treaty. The pro-annexation Democrat Polk narrowly defeated anti-annexation Whig Henry Clay in the 1844 presidential election. In December 1844, lame-duck President Tyler called on Congress to pass his treaty by simple majorities in each house. The Democratic-dominated House of Representatives complied with his request by passing an amended bill expanding on the pro-slavery {{provisions of the}} Tyler treaty. The Senate narrowly passed a compromise version of the House bill (by the vote of the minority Democrats and several southern Whigs), designed to provide the incoming President-elect Polk the options of immediate annexation of Texas or new talks to revise the annexation terms of the House-amended bill.|$|E
5|$|Jackson's successor, President Martin Van Buren, viewed Texas {{annexation}} as {{an immense}} political liability that would empower the anti-slavery northern Whig opposition – especially if annexation provoked {{a war with}} Mexico. Presented with a formal annexation proposal from Texas minister Memucan Hunt, Jr. in August 1837, Van Buren summarily rejected it. Annexation resolutions presented separately in each house of Congress were either <b>soundly</b> defeated or tabled through filibuster. After the election of 1838, new Texas president Mirabeau B. Lamar withdrew his republic's offer of annexation due to these failures. Texans were at an annexation impasse when John Tyler entered the White House in 1841.|$|E
5|$|On {{his return}} from injury a month later, Bolt {{asserted}} himself with a 100 m win at the Athletissima meeting in Lausanne (9.82 seconds) and a victory over Asafa Powell at Meeting Areva in Paris (9.84 seconds). Despite this run of form, he suffered only the second loss {{of his career in}} a 100 m final at the DN Galan. Tyson Gay <b>soundly</b> defeated him with a run of 9.84 to Bolt's 9.97 seconds, and the Jamaican reflected that he had slacked off in training early in the season while Gay had been better prepared and in a better condition. This marked Bolt's first loss to Gay in the 100 m, which coincidentally occurred in the same stadium where Powell had beaten Bolt for the first time two years earlier.|$|E
5|$|One {{day while}} Wayne is walking {{home in the}} rain and hail, Homer sees Wayne and he reluctantly agrees to let Homer drive him to Moe's Tavern for a drink. While Wayne is in the bathroom, Snake {{dramatically}} crashes through the door on his motorcycle to rob everyone. As soon as Wayne comes out, he <b>soundly</b> beats up Snake. The story spreads quickly and a news segment that features an interview with Wayne by Kent Brockman and a computer animated Taiwanese dramatization of the incident soon airs on television. It is discovered that Wayne is a highly trained former CIA black ops agent, who decided to go into hiding in Springfield. He is plagued by recurring flashbacks from his previous missions, which cause him to act or shout them out, as evidenced when he unintentionally attacks Mr. Burns, the boss of the power plant, which results in Wayne being fired.|$|E
5|$|When Vardanes II of Parthia {{rebelled against}} his father Vologeses I in 55AD, Vologeses withdrew his forces from Armenia. Rome quickly {{attempted}} {{to fill the}} political vacuum left behind. In the Roman–Parthian War of 58–63AD, the commander Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo achieved some military successes against the Parthians while installing Tigranes VI of Armenia as a Roman client. However, Corbulo's successor Lucius Caesennius Paetus was <b>soundly</b> defeated by Parthian forces and fled Armenia. Following a peace treaty, Tiridates I traveled to Naples and Rome in 63 AD. At both sites the Roman emperor Nero (r.54–68AD) ceremoniously crowned him king of Armenia by placing the royal diadem on his head.|$|E
5|$|Already {{considered}} washed up, the Giants {{intended to}} have Tittle share quarterback duties with 40-year-old Charlie Conerly, {{who had been}} with the team since 1948. The players at first remained loyal to Conerly, and treated Tittle with the cold shoulder. Tittle missed the season opener due to a back injury sustained before the season. His first game with New York came in week two, against the Steelers, in which he and Conerly each threw a touchdown pass in the Giants' 17–14 win. He became the team's primary starter {{for the remainder of the}} season and led the revitalized Giants to first place in the Eastern Conference. The Newspaper Enterprise Association (NEA) awarded Tittle its Jim Thorpe Trophy as the NFL's players' choice of MVP. In the 1961 NFL Championship Game, the Giants were <b>soundly</b> defeated by Vince Lombardi's Green Bay Packers, as they were shut-out 0–37. Tittle completed six of twenty passes in the game and threw four interceptions.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of 1998, Ferraro left Crossfire {{and ran for the}} Democratic {{nomination}} again in the 1998 United States Senate election in New York. The other candidates were Congressman Charles Schumer and New York City Public Advocate Mark J. Green. She had done no fundraising, out of fear of conflict of interest with her Crossfire job, but was nonetheless immediately perceived as the front-runner. Indeed, December and January polls had her 25percentage points ahead of Green in the race and even further ahead of Schumer. Unlike the previous campaigns, her family finances never became an issue. However, she lost ground during the summer, with Schumer catching up in the polls by early August and then soon passing her. Schumer, a tireless fundraiser, outspent her by a five-to-one margin, and Ferraro failed to establish a political image current with the times. In the , 1998 primary, she was beaten <b>soundly</b> by Schumer by a 51percent to 26percent margin. Unlike 1992, the contest was not divisive, and Ferraro and third-place finisher Green endorsed Schumer at a unity breakfast the following day. Schumer would go on to decisively unseat D'Amato in the general election.|$|E
5|$|Building for the 1975–76 {{campaign}} {{he signed}} Phil Boersma from Liverpool to replace Murdoch, but Boersma never settled {{at the club}} and was frequently injured. They finished in 13th place, {{and went on to}} win the Anglo-Scottish Cup with a 1–0 win over Fulham. They also reached the semi-finals of the League Cup, and took a 1–0 lead over Manchester City into the second leg at Maine Road, where they were <b>soundly</b> beaten 4–0. However teams had begun to learn how to combat Charlton's attack strategy and left their centre-backs on the outside of the penalty box to neutralise the threat of Foggon. Despite the team's steady progress the club's board voted to sack Charlton in July 1976 after becoming increasingly concerned that he was overstepping his authority in negotiating business deals on behalf of the club and choosing the club's strip. However, the club chairman overruled the decision and Charlton remained in charge.|$|E
5|$|In 444 BC, the {{conservative}} {{and the democratic}} factions confronted {{each other in a}} fierce struggle. The ambitious new leader of {{the conservative}}s, Thucydides (not {{to be confused with the}} historian of the same name), accused Pericles of profligacy, criticizing the way he spent the money for the ongoing building plan. Thucydides initially managed to incite the passions of the ecclesia regarding these charges in his favor. However, when Pericles took the floor, his resolute arguments put Thucydides and the conservatives firmly on the defensive. Finally, Pericles proposed to reimburse the city for all questionable expenses from his private property, with the proviso that he would make the inscriptions of dedication in his own name. His stance was greeted with applause, and Thucydides was <b>soundly,</b> if unexpectedly, defeated. In 442BC, the Athenian public voted to ostracize Thucydides from the city for 10 years and Pericles was once again the unchallenged ruler of the Athenian political arena.|$|E
5|$|On Thursday, 5 September, the Australians {{arrived at}} Clifton for what {{promised to be}} an {{explosive}} encounter. Midwinter did not play for Gloucestershire due to his hand injury but his absence probably counted for little as the Australians took due revenge on the Graces and beat Gloucestershire <b>soundly</b> by 10 wickets inside two days. Spofforth had 12 wickets in the match, taking 7–49 and 5–41 as Gloucestershire struggled to 112 and 85, Grace making 22 and 5. As it happened, Spofforth did not get his wicket, though he caught Grace off Boyle in the first innings. In the second, Grace was lbw to Garrett. Grace could take only 1–90 in the Australian first innings of 183, in which Spofforth, who really did have a score to settle, top-scored with 44. To completely make his point, Spofforth then opened the Australian second innings in which he and Bailey scored the necessary 17 without loss. It {{was the first time}} Gloucestershire, formed in 1870, had been beaten in a home match.|$|E
5|$|There is an {{extensive}} {{body of research}} demonstrating a significant association between attachment organizations and children's functioning across multiple domains. Early insecure attachment does not necessarily predict difficulties, {{but it is a}} liability for the child, particularly if similar parental behaviours continue throughout childhood. Compared to that of securely attached children, the adjustment of insecure children in many spheres of life is not as <b>soundly</b> based, putting their future relationships in jeopardy. Although the link is not fully established by research and there are other influences besides attachment, secure infants are more likely to become socially competent than their insecure peers. Relationships formed with peers influence the acquisition of social skills, intellectual development and the formation of social identity. Classification of children's peer status (popular, neglected or rejected) has been found to predict subsequent adjustment. Insecure children, particularly avoidant children, are especially vulnerable to family risk. Their social and behavioural problems increase or decline with deterioration or improvement in parenting. However, an early secure attachment appears to have a lasting protective function. As with attachment to parental figures, subsequent experiences may alter the course of development.|$|E
5|$|While {{serving in}} Congress, Jennings's health {{continued}} to decline {{as he struggled}} with alcohol addiction and suffered from severe rheumatism. In 1827 ceiling plaster from Jennings's Washington D.C. boarding room fell on his head, severely injuring him, and ill health limited his ability to visit his constituents, but he continued to remain a popular politician in Indiana. In the congressional election of 1826, Jennings ran unopposed. He won reelection in 1828, <b>soundly</b> defeating his opponent, Indiana's lieutenant governor, John H. Thompson. Jennings did not publicly favor a presidential candidate and won the Second District seat with support from voters who favored Jackson and Adams. During Jennings's final term in office House journals show that he introduced no legislation, was frequently not present to vote on matters, and only once delivered a speech. Jennings's friends, led by Senator John Tipton, took note of his situation and took action to block Jennings's reelection bid when his drinking became a political liability. John Carr, anti-Jackson man, opposed Jennings in a six-way race for the congressional seat and won the election. Tipton had arranged for others to enter the race and divide Jennings's supporters. Jennings left office on March 3, 1831.|$|E
