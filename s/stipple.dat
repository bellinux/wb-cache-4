25|$|On 4 August 1772, Blake was apprenticed to {{engraver}} James Basire of Great Queen Street, at {{the sum of}} £52.10, for a term {{of seven}} years. At {{the end of the}} term, aged 21, he became a professional engraver. No record survives of any serious disagreement or conflict between the two during the period of Blake's apprenticeship, but Peter Ackroyd's biography notes that Blake later added Basire's name to a list of artistic adversaries – and then crossed it out. This aside, Basire's style of line-engraving was of a kind held at the time to be old-fashioned compared to the flashier <b>stipple</b> or mezzotint styles. It has been speculated that Blake's instruction in this outmoded form may have been detrimental to his acquiring of work or recognition in later life.|$|E
25|$|The use of {{asbestos}} in new construction projects has been banned for health and safety reasons in many developed countries or regions, including the European Union, Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, and New Zealand. A notable exception is the United States, where asbestos continues {{to be used in}} construction such as cement asbestos pipes. The 5th Circuit Court prevented the EPA from banning asbestos in 1991 because EPA research showed the ban would cost between $450 and 800 million while only saving around 200 lives in a 13-year timeframe, and that the EPA did not provide adequate evidence for the safety of alternative products. Until the mid-1980s, small amounts of white asbestos were used in the manufacture of Artex, a decorative <b>stipple</b> finish, however, some of the lesser-known suppliers of Artex were still adding white asbestos until 1999.|$|E
25|$|He {{was born}} in Chelsea, London. His father, a native of Lanark, {{had served as a}} soldier, losing an arm at the Battle of Fontenoy, and was admitted, first as an inmate, and {{afterwards}} as an outdoor pensioner, at Chelsea Hospital. Gillray commenced life by learning letter-engraving, at which he soon became adept. This employment, however, proved irksome to James, so he wandered about for a time with a company of strolling players. After a very checkered experience, he returned to London and was admitted as a student in the Royal Academy, supporting himself by engraving, and probably issuing a considerable number of caricatures under fictitious names. His caricatures are almost all in etching, some also with aquatint, and a few using <b>stipple</b> technique. None can correctly be described as engravings, although this term is often loosely used to describe them. Hogarth's works were the delight and study of his early years. Paddy on Horseback, which appeared in 1779, is the first caricature which is certainly his. Two caricatures on Admiral Rodney's naval victory at the Battle of the Saintes, issued in 1782, were among the first of the memorable series of his political sketches.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} rendering color videos using a non-photo-realistic art form technique commonly called <b>stippling.</b> <b>Stippling</b> {{is the art}} of rendering images using point sets, possibly with various attributes like sizes, elementary shapes, and colors. Producing nice <b>stippling</b> is attractive not only for the sake of image depiction but also because it yields a compact vectorial format for storing the semantic information of media. Moreover, <b>stippling</b> is by construction easily tunable to various device resolutions without suffering from bitmap sampling artifacts when resizing. The underlying core technique for <b>stippling</b> images is to compute a centroidal Voronoi tessellation on a well-designed underlying density. This density relates to the image content, and is used to compute a weighted Voronoi diagram. By considering videos as image sequences and initializing properly the <b>stippling</b> of one image by the result of its predecessor, one avoids undesirable point flickering artifacts and can produce <b>stippled</b> videos that nevertheless still exhibit noticeable artifacts. To overcome this, our method improves over the naive scheme by considering dynamic point creation and deletion according to the current scene semantic complexity, and show how to effectively vectorize video while adjusting for both color and contrast characteristics. Furthermore, we explain how to produce high quality <b>stippled</b> ``videos'' (eg., fully dynamic spatio-temporal point sets) for media containing various fading effects, like quick motions of objects or progressive shot changes. We report on practical performances of our implementation, and present several <b>stippled</b> video results rendered on-the-fly using our viewer that allows both spatio-temporal dynamic rescaling (eg., upscale vectorially frame rate).

500|$|The folio and the {{illustrated}} Shakespeare edition were [...] "by far {{the largest}} single engraving enterprise ever undertaken in England". As print collector and dealer Christopher Lennox-Boyd explains, [...] "had there not been a market for such engravings, {{not one of the}} paintings would have been commissioned, and few, if any, of the artists would have risked painting such elaborate compositions". Scholars believe that a variety of engraving methods were employed and that line engraving was the [...] "preferred medium" [...] because it was [...] "clear and hardwearing" [...] and because it had a high reputation. <b>Stipple</b> engraving, which was quicker and often used to produce shading effects, wore out quicker and was valued less. Many plates were a mixture of both. Several scholars have suggested that mezzotint and aquatint were also used. Lennox-Boyd, however, claims that [...] "close examination of the plates confirms" [...] that these two methods were not used and argues that they were [...] "totally unsuitable": [...] mezzotint wore quickly and aquatint was too new (there would not have been enough artists capable of executing it). Most of Boydell's engravers were also trained artists; for example, Bartolozzi was renowned for his stippling technique.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Stippling</b> is a {{consequence}} of the microscopic elevations and depressions of the surface of the gingival tissue due to the connective tissue projections within the tissue. [...] "The degree of keratinization and the prominence of <b>stippling</b> appear to be related." [...] To be more specific, <b>stippling</b> occurs at sites of fusion of the epithelial ridges (also known as rete pegs) and correspond to the fusion of the valleys created by the connective tissue papillae.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} fast {{hardware-accelerated}} <b>stippling</b> method {{which does not}} require any preprocessing for placing points on surfaces. The surfaces are automatically parameterized in order to apply <b>stippling</b> textures without major distortions. The mapping process is guided by a decomposition of the space in cubes. Seamless scaling with a constant density of points is realized by subdividing and summarizing cubes. Our mip-map technique enables arbitrarily scaling with one texture. Different shading tones and scales are facilitated by adhering to the constraints of tonal art maps. With our <b>stippling</b> technique, it is feasible to encode all scaling and brightness levels within one self-similar texture. Our method is applied to surfaces extracted from (segmented) medical volume data. The speed of the <b>stippling</b> process enables <b>stippling</b> for several complex objects simultaneously. We consider application scenarios in intervention planning (neck and liver surgery planning). In these scenarios, object recognition (shape perception) is supported by adding <b>stippling</b> to semi-transparently shaded objects which are displayed as context information.

6000|$|... [29] It {{is to be}} remembered, however, {{that these}} truths present [...] {{themselves}} in all probability under very different phases to [...] individuals of different powers of vision. Many artists who appear [...] to generalize rudely or rashly are perhaps faithfully endeavoring to [...] render the appearance which nature bears to sight of limited range. [...] Others may be led by their singular keenness of sight into [...] inexpedient detail. Works which are painted for effect at a certain [...] distance must be always seen at disadvantage by those whose sight is [...] of different range from the painter's. Another circumstance to which [...] I ought above to have alluded is {{the scale of the}} picture; for there [...] are different degrees of generalization, and different necessities [...] of symbolism, belonging to every scale: the <b>stipple</b> of the miniature [...] painter would be offensive on features of the life size, and the [...] leaves with Tintoret may articulate on a canvas of sixty feet by [...] twenty-five, must be generalized by Turner on one of four by three. [...] Another circumstance of some importance is the assumed distance of [...] the foreground; many landscape painters seem to think their nearest [...] foreground is always equally near, whereas its distance from the [...] spectator varies not a little, being always at least its own [...] calculable breadth from side to side as estimated by figures or any [...] other object of known size at the nearest part of it. With Claude [...] almost always; with Turner often, as in the Daphne and Leucippus, [...] this breadth is forty or fifty yards; and as the nearest foreground [...] object must then be at least that distance removed, and may be [...] much more, it is evident that no completion of close detail is in [...] such cases allowable, (see here another proof of Claude's erroneous [...] practice;) with Titian and Tintoret, on the contrary, the foreground [...] is rarely more than five or six yards broad, and its objects [...] therefore being only five or six yards distant are entirely [...] detailed.|$|E
