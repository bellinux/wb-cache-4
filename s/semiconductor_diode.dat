25|$|In modern sets, a <b>semiconductor</b> <b>diode</b> is {{used for}} the detector, which is much more {{reliable}} than a cat's whisker detector and requires no adjustments. Germanium diodes (or sometimes Schottky diodes) are used instead of silicon diodes, because their lower forward voltage drop (roughly 0.3V compared to 0.6V) makes them more sensitive.|$|E

25|$|A diode is a two-terminal {{electronic}} component that conducts current primarily {{in one direction}} (asymmetric conductance); it has low (ideally zero) resistance in one direction, and high (ideally infinite) resistance in the other. A <b>semiconductor</b> <b>diode,</b> {{the most common type}} today, is a crystalline piece of semiconductor material with a p–n junction connected to two electrical terminals. A vacuum tube diode has two electrodes, a plate (anode) and a heated cathode. Semiconductor diodes were the first semiconductor electronic devices. The discovery of crystals' rectifying abilities was made by German physicist Ferdinand Braun in 1874. The first semiconductor diodes, called cat's whisker diodes, developed around 1906, were made of mineral crystals such as galena. Today, most diodes are made of silicon, but other materials such as selenium and germanium are sometimes used.|$|E

2500|$|The cat's-whisker {{detector}} was {{the earliest}} type of <b>semiconductor</b> <b>diode.</b> [...] It {{consisted of a}} crystal of some semiconducting mineral, usually galena (lead sulfide), with a light springy wire touching its surface. [...] Invented by Jagadish Chandra Bose and developed by G. W. Pickard around 1906, it served as the radio wave rectifier in the first widely used radio receivers, called crystal radios. [...] Its fragility and limited current capability made it unsuitable for power supply applications.

2500|$|Coherent light {{emission}} from a gallium arsenide (GaAs) <b>semiconductor</b> <b>diode</b> (the first laser diode) was demonstrated in 1962 by two US groups led by Robert N. Hall at the General Electric research center and by Marshall Nathan at the IBM T.J. Watson Research Center. There has been ongoing debate {{as to whether}} IBM or GE invented the first laser diode which was largely based on theoretical work by William P. Dumke at IBM Labs in Yonkers, NY. [...] The priority is given to General Electric group who have obtained and submitted their results earlier; they also went further and made a resonant cavity for their diode. [...] It was initially speculated, by MIT's Ben Lax among other leading physicists, that silicon or germanium {{could be used to}} create a lasing effect, but theoretical analyses convinced William P. Dumke that these materials would not work. Instead, he suggested Gallium Arsenide as a good candidate. The first visible wavelength GaAs laser diode was demonstrated by Nick Holonyak, Jr. later in 1962.|$|E
