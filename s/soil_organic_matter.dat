The traditional agricultural system practiced by tribes in the Amazon is based on swidden cultivation (also known as slash-and-burn or shifting cultivation) and is considered a relatively benign disturbance. In fact, {{when looking at the}} level of individual swidden plots a number of traditional farming practices are considered beneficial.

25|$|A {{relatively}} {{new approach to}} restoring land is to inoculate soil with AM fungi when reintroducing vegetation in ecological restoration projects (phytoremediation). It has enabled host plants to establish themselves on degraded soil and improve soil quality and health. Soils' quality parameters were significantly improved long-term when a mixture of indigenous arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi species was introduced compared to noninoculated soil and soil inoculated with a single exotic species of AM fungi. The benefits were increased plant growth, increased phosphorus uptake and soil nitrogen content, higher <b>soil</b> <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> content, and soil aggregation, attributed to higher legume nodulation {{in the presence of}} AMF, better water infiltration, and soil aeration due to soil aggregation.|$|E
25|$|Topography in the Great Plains {{actually}} affects soil {{composition in}} areas of different elevation. Higher accumulations of <b>soil</b> <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> are found in lower landscape positions such as grasslands than in higher landscape positions such as buttes, mesas, and escarpments found throughout the north western areas of the ecoregion. In the short grass regions such as the High Plains of the Great Plains, soil typically stores no moisture annually because vegetation depends on whatever water exists in the soil during dry spells. Soil in this region is typically drained, composed of loam and clay. Specialized plants such as various species of forbs and shrubs utilize this soil. Some adaptations that plants have acquired in this region include massive and intricate root systems that make up around 90 percent of the plants biomass. This allows the plants to stay securely planted in ground and have roots that reach moisture in the deepest sections of the soil. In tall grass prairies, water is less scarce and the soil contains more moisture resulting a smaller root biomass.|$|E

25|$|Pyridine {{might also}} have minor neurotoxic, genotoxic, and clastogenic effects. Exposure to {{pyridine}} would normally lead to its inhalation and absorption in the lungs and gastrointestinal tract, where it either remains unchanged or is metabolized. The major products of pyridine metabolism are N-methylpyridiniumhydroxide, which are formed by N-methyltransferases (e.g., pyridine N-methyltransferase), as well as pyridine N-oxide, and 2-, 3-, and 4-hydroxypyridine, which are generated {{by the action of}} monooxygenase. In humans, pyridine is metabolized only into N-methylpyridiniumhydroxide. Pyridine is readily degraded by bacteria to ammonia and carbon dioxide. The unsubstituted pyridine ring degrades more rapidly than picoline, lutidine, chloropyridine, or aminopyridines, and a number of pyridine degraders have been shown to overproduce riboflavin in the presence of pyridine. Ionizable N-heterocyclic compounds, including pyridine, interact with environmental surfaces (such as soils and sediments) via multiple pH-dependent mechanisms, including partitioning to <b>soil</b> <b>organic</b> <b>matter,</b> cation exchange, and surface complexation. Such adsorption to surfaces reduces bioavailability of pyridines for microbial degraders and other organisms, thus slowing degradation rates and reducing ecotoxicity.|$|E

Others are detritivores that help to break down forest litter and dead organic matter such as skin cells. Others still are plant feeders and may damage crops. Damage to crops {{is perhaps the most}} costly economic effect of mites, especially by the spider mites and their relatives (Tetranychoidea), earth mites (Penthaleidae), thread-footed mites (Tarsonemidae) and the gall and rust mites (Eriophyoidea). Some parasitic forms affect humans and other mammals, causing damage by their feeding, and can even be vectors of diseases such as scrub typhus and rickettsial pox. A well-known effect of mites on humans is their role as an allergen and the stimulation of asthma in people affected by the respiratory disease. The use of predatory mites (e.g. Phytoseiidae) in pest control and herbivorous mites that attack weeds is also important. An unquantified, but major positive contribution of the Acari is their normal functioning in ecosystems, especially their roles in the decomposer subsystem.|$|E
25|$|The {{planting}} of Eucalyptus sp. has been criticised {{because of concerns}} that soil would be degraded by nutrient depletion and other biological changes. During the last ten years, in the northwestern regions of Uruguay the Eucalyptus sp. plantations have reached annual forestation rates of 300%. That zone has a potential forested area of 1,000,000 hectares, approximately 29% of the national territory dedicated to forestry, of which approximately 800,000 hectares are currently forested by monoculture of Eucalyptus spp. It is expected that the radical and durable substitution of vegetation cover leads {{to changes in the}} quantity and quality of <b>soil</b> <b>organic</b> <b>matter.</b> Such changes may also influence soil fertility and soil physical and chemical properties. The soil quality effects associated with Eucalyptus sp. plantations could have negative effects on soil chemistry; for example: soil acidification, iron leaching, allelopathic activities and a high C:N ratio of litter. Additionally, as most scientific understanding of land cover change effects is related to ecosystems where forests were replaced by grasslands or crops, or grassland was replaced by crops, the environmental effects of the current Uruguayan land cover changes are not well understood. The first scientific publication on soil studies in western zone tree plantations (focused on pulp production) appeared in 2004 and described soil acidification and soil carbon changes, similar to a podzolisation process, and destruction of clay (illite-like minerals), which is the main reservoir of potassium in the soil. Although these studies were carried out in an important zone for forest cultivation, they cannot define the current situation in the rest of the land area under eucalyptus cultivation. Moreover, recently Jackson and Jobbagy have proposed another adverse environmental impact that may result from Eucalyptus culture on prairie soils: stream acidification.|$|E
50|$|The production, {{accumulation}} {{and degradation}} of <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> are greatly dependent on climate. Temperature, soil moisture and topography {{are the major}} factors affecting the accumulation of <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> in <b>soils.</b> <b>Organic</b> <b>matter</b> tends to accumulate under wet or cold conditions where decomposer activity is impeded by low temperature or excess moisture which results in anaerobic conditions. Conversely, excessive rain and high temperatures of tropical climates enables rapid decomposition of <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> and leaching of plant nutrients; forest ecosystems on these soils rely on efficient recycling of nutrients and plant matter to maintain their productivity. Excessive slope may encourage {{the erosion of the}} top layer of soil which holds most of the raw organic material that would otherwise eventually become humus.|$|R

2500|$|Soil-conservation farming {{involves}} no-till farming, “green manures” {{and other}} soil-enhancing practices. [...] Such farming methods attempt {{to mimic the}} biology of barren lands. They can revive damaged soil, minimize erosion, encourage plant growth, eliminate the use of nitrogen fertilizer or fungicide, produce above-average yields and protect crops during droughts or flooding. The result is less labor and lower costs that increase farmers’ profits. No-till farming and cover crops act as sinks for nitrogen and other nutrients. This increases the amount of <b>soil</b> <b>organic</b> <b>matter.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Grasslands {{contribute}} to <b>soil</b> <b>organic</b> <b>matter,</b> stored mainly in their extensive fibrous root mats. Due {{in part to}} the climatic conditions of these regions (e.g. cooler temperatures and semi-arid to arid conditions), these soils can accumulate significant quantities of organic matter. This can vary based on rainfall, the length of the winter season, and the frequency of naturally occurring lightning-induced grass-fires. [...] While these fires release carbon dioxide, they improve the quality of the grasslands overall, in turn increasing the amount of carbon retained in the humic material. [...] They also deposit carbon directly to the soil in the form of char that does not significantly degrade back to carbon dioxide.|$|E
2500|$|Erosion is {{strongly}} related to human activity. For example, roads which increase impermeable surfaces lead to streaming and ground loss. Agriculture also accelerates soil erosion (increase of field size, correlated to hedges and ditches removal). Meadows are in regression to the profit of plowed lands. [...] Spring cultures (sunflower, corn, beet) surfaces are increasing and leave the ground naked in winter. Sloping grounds are gradually colonized by vine. Lastly, use of herbicides leaves the ground naked between each crop. New cultural practices, such as mechanization also increases the risks of erosion. Fertilization by mineral manures rather than organic manure gradually destructure the soil. [...] Many scientists observed a gradual decrease of <b>soil</b> <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> content in soils, {{as well as a}} decrease of soil biological activity (in particular, in relation to chemical uses). Lastly, deforestation, in particular, is responsible for degradation of forest soils.|$|E
40|$|The {{production}} potential in Andisols {{is limited by}} the high P-retention capacity. Farmers commonly use <b>organic</b> <b>matter.</b> Sugarcane filter cake (blothong, Indonesian, SFC) and rice husk ash (RHA) are locally available in Coban Rondo, Malang, East Java and hence potentially used for soil amendment. To study the effects of SFC and RHA on P availability, P uptake and plant growth (Brassica sp.), soil samples were taken from 0 - 20 cm depth, incubated with SFC (21. 37 Mg. ha - 1) and RHA (44. 64 Mg. ha - 1). Total P, P-available, pH, organic carbon, exchangeable cations (K, Na, Ca, Mg), and P retention curve were determined at 0, 15, 30, and 45 days after incubation. Crop parameters (height, number of leaves, total dry weight) and P-uptake were also measured at 2, 4, 6 weeks after planting. The results showed that RHA was more effective than SFC to decrease P retention and increase P availability (120 % on RHA; and 78 % on SFC). <b>Soils</b> having higher <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> tended to have higher P availability. As a consequence, RHA and SFC increased P-uptake respectively 3 and 2 times in <b>soil</b> rich in <b>organic</b> <b>matter,</b> and 1. 9 and 2. 7 times in <b>soil</b> low in <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> compared to untreated soil.
