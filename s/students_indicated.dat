25|$|A 2008 {{study of}} 227 {{undergraduate}} and graduate students enrolled in web-enabled courses at the Naval War College (NWC) and a public university found that social loafing not only exists, but may also be prevalent in the online learning classroom. Although only 2% of NWC and 8% of public university students self-reported social loafing, 8% of NWC and 77% of public university <b>students</b> <b>indicated</b> the perception of others engaging in social loafing. Additional findings generally verify face-to-face social loafing findings from previous studies. The researchers conclude that injustice {{in the distribution of}} rewards increases social loafing, and suggest that self-perceived dominance negatively affects individual participation in group activities.|$|E
25|$|A {{secondary}} {{analysis of}} a series of surveys conducted for the AAUW and administered to a representative sample of 2,064 8th through 11th-grade American students in 2000 showed that 9.6% of the students reported educator sex abuse. The students were asked if and how often they had experienced 14 types of behaviors which constitute sexual harassment. They then indicated who harassed them (students, teachers, school employees). Nonphysical sexual abuse (e.g., making sexual jokes) was more prevalent than physical abuse (8.7 and 6.7%). Girls {{were more likely to report}} educator sexual harassment than boys (10.3 and 8.8%). 12.3% of black, 12.2% of Latino, 8.4% of white and 1,8 % of Asian <b>students</b> <b>indicated</b> that they had experienced sexual harassment by teachers.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, UC San Diego found that its {{existing}} Student Center in Muir College was unequipped {{to handle the}} more than 12,000 students that were enrolled at the university. As a result, UC San Diego suffered from reduced student involvement {{and a sense of}} apathy across campus. Additionally, the lack of on-campus social space contributed to the fact that nearly 60% of UCSD students at the time commuted to school. In November 1983, a survey of 2,000 UCSD <b>students</b> <b>indicated</b> a pressing need for a new student union. That same school year, students passed a referendum that raised their student fees from $12.50 per quarter to $37.50 per quarter, for the purpose of constructing a University Center that would house fast food restaurants, a movie theater, and offices for student organizations. The proposed University Center, sited southeast of the existing Central Library, was originally estimated to cost $9 million to construct, but the Kaplan McLaughlin Diaz design approved by the UC Regents would be an $18.6 million facility with an added pub, ballroom, and bookstore.|$|E

Avedon, who had written for The Donna Reed Show and been a regular writer for Bewitched, accepted his request. Avedon visited Jefferson High School and later said of the experience, [...] "I was horrified. Locker doors were hanging off their hinges. There wasn't a blade of grass in sight." [...] Avedon expressed amazement over the script the students produced and helped them revise it and expand its length so it would sustain a full half-hour episode. She promised the students that no changes would {{be made to the}} script unless they approved. It was because of her recommendation that the story was reformulated as a Christmas episode, which she suggested because the script [...] "was so imbued with the spirit." [...] She said that one of the <b>students</b> <b>indicated</b> a desire to write for Bewitched because the series deals with miscegenation by way of a marriage between a witch and a mortal. [...] The final script credited the teleplay to Avedon and Asher, and the story to all 26 students, who were listed on screen in alphabetical order.|$|E
