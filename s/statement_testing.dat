40|$|Abstract—Finding {{the cause}} of a program’s failure from a causal-analysis {{perspective}} requires, for each <b>statement,</b> <b>tests</b> that cover the <b>statement</b> and <b>tests</b> that do not cover the statement. However, in practice the composition of test suites can be detrimental to effective fault localization for two reasons: (1) lack-of-balance, which occurs if the coverage characteristics of tests that cover a <b>statement</b> differ from <b>tests</b> that do not cover the statement, and (2) lack-of-overlap, which occurs if test cases that reach the control-dependence predecessor of a statement cover or do not cover the statement. This paper addresses these two problems. First, the paper presents empirical results that show that, for effective fault localization, the composition of test suites should exhibit balance and overlap. Second, the paper presents new techniques to overcome these problems—matching to address lack-of-balance and causal-effect imputation to overcome lack-of-overlap—and presents empirical evidence that these techniques increase the effectiveness of fault localization.

40|$|The {{operation}} of machining by lathe {{is one of}} the most common operations in automobile and machinery industries. The process is able to generate cylindrical bars under a wider variety of diameters/staggerings and using different materials, metallic's or non-metallic's (cupper, wood, aluminum, brass, steel, etc.). However, when more complex geometries are required, additional machines are used, like milling machine and/or machines under numerical control (CNC) and multiple axles. The possibility of joining circles, polygons, angular motion and synchronism, open the mind to multiple figures (shapes) and movements, which can generate different geometries. This paper aims to demonstrate that both operations (turning and milling), can be made at the same time and at the same machine, special but simpler lathe. The studies of geometry, associated with calculus (trigonometry) and angular motion give basis and sustain this <b>statement.</b> <b>Tests</b> in bench materialize the idea and reinforce this thesis...|$|R

Consistent with the evidence presented by Dechow et al.

40|$|The authors {{introduce}} {{a framework for}} organizing conceptualizations of social identity along four dimensions: perception of the intergroup context, in-group attraction, interdependency beliefs, and depersonalization. The authors suggest that {{the extent to which}} each dimension is evoked or assessed {{will have an impact on}} the consequences attributed to social identity. Two studies test hypotheses derived from the framework and investigate the psychometric properties of several scales. In Study 1, participants completed four social identity scales, two group cohesion scales, and a measure of allocentrism. Interscale commonalities were tested through a secondary factor analysis, and the scales and secondary factors were used to predict in-group pride and intergroup bias. Study 2 included additional predictors (interdependency, conflict, competition) and outcome measures (in-group and out-group evaluations, perceived group homogeneity, and the twenty <b>statements</b> <b>test).</b> Consistent with predictions, two types of social identity were empirically extracted and were differentially related to the outcome measures.
