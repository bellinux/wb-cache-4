5|$|Although Sunnydale {{has long}} been {{familiar}} with demons and monsters who have inhabited the town and fed off its residents, in this episode the conventions by which societal functions are so disrupted by the unexplained silence that significant chaos results, enough to warrant both Riley and Buffy going on patrol to keep order. Buffy and Willow walk down a familiar street, arm-in-arm and easily <b>startled,</b> <b>and</b> see a bank closed and patrons running into a liquor store that is obviously open. The breakdown of order also causes sudden religious fervor; {{a group of people}} have gathered on the street to read the Bible (Revelation 15:1 is written on a signboard—an allusion to the seven angels with seven plagues as there are seven Gentlemen, according to author Nikki Stafford). Opportunistic capitalist fervor results in a man selling overpriced dry erase boards. Community, notes Patrick Shade (citing sociologist George Herbert Mead), consists of institutions such as language, religion, and economics. When one institution disappears, Sunnydale residents begin to depend more heavily on the others. Mostly, however, individuals are isolated from one another during the silence. Even the Scoobies find their bonds shaken, as they are unable to use the witty banter that has marked them as a group thus far. (This awkwardness extended even to the actors: the first silent scene the entire cast attempted was the Scoobies gathering in Giles' apartment following the discovery that all of Sunnydale's denizens had lost their voices. It took several rehearsals as the scene came out mistimed, with all of the actors having trouble playing off one another without the use of verbal cues, or all pantomiming over one another.) Without a common language to fall back upon the Scoobies are forced to depend on their shared history to help them recover well {{enough to be able to}} take action.|$|E
5|$|Atlantic puffins are {{cautious}} {{when approaching}} the colony and no bird likes {{to land in}} a location where other puffins are not already present. They make several circuits of the colony before alighting. On the ground they spend much time preening, spreading oil from their preen gland and setting each feather in its correct position with beak or claw. They also spend time standing by their burrow entrances and interacting with passing birds. Dominance is shown by an upright stance, with fluffed chest feathers and cocked tail, an exaggerated slow walk, head jerking and gaping. Submissive birds lower their head and hold their body horizontal and scurry past dominant individuals. Birds normally signal their intention to take off by briefly lowering their body before running down the slope to gain momentum. If a bird is <b>startled</b> <b>and</b> takes off unexpectedly, a panic can spread through the colony with all the birds launching themselves {{into the air and}} wheeling around in a great circle. The colony is at its most active in the evening, with birds standing outside their burrows, resting on the turf or strolling around. Then the slopes empty for the night as the birds fly out to sea to roost, often choosing to do so at fishing grounds ready for early morning provisioning.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, Liz {{returns to}} Harmony in {{response}} to a telephone call from Diana; she tells Liz about her true identity as Sheridan, her engagement to Luis, and Antonio's terminal illness. While visiting Antonio in the hospital, Liz is <b>startled</b> <b>and</b> angry to find Eve in Harmony. She plots to reveal Eve's past to her husband T. C. Russell and her children Whitney and Simone Russell in order to replace her sister as the head of her family. Between 2002 and 2004, Liz makes bolder moves to expose Eve and coerce T. C. to have sex with her. In 2003, Liz buys the Blue Note, a jazz club Julian constructed as a copy of the place where he first met Eve, as a cover to stay in Harmony longer without raising suspicion. The storyline culminates in July 2004 when Liz brings Eve's aunt Irma Johnson to tell T. C. the truth about Eve's past relationship with Julian and their child. The characters also find out that Eve, not Julian, was responsible for the car accident ending T. C.'s tennis career. In retaliation, Eve tells everyone in Harmony about Liz's true identity as her sister. T. C. later divorces Eve after finding himself unable to forgive her for lying about her past. Following the signing of the divorce papers, he openly begins a romantic relationship with Liz.|$|E

25|$|A myotonic goat, {{otherwise}} known as the fainting goat, is a domestic goat that freezes for roughly 3 seconds when it feels panic. Though painless, this generally results in the animal collapsing on its side. The characteristic {{is caused by a}} hereditary genetic disorder called myotonia congenita. When startled, younger goats will stiffen and fall over. Older goats learn to spread their legs or lean against something when <b>startled,</b> <b>and</b> often they continue to run about in an awkward, stiff-legged shuffle.|$|E
25|$|The Tramways Committee met {{nearly every}} two weeks and the minutes record a {{constant}} stream of accidents and claims on the committee for damages too numerous to list here. There are complaints by shopkeepers against tramcar drivers who let their horses and cars stand outside the shop. There are records of payments to tramcar drivers who acted bravely in restraining horses which were <b>startled</b> <b>and</b> bolted. Despite the imminent introduction of electric cars, the horse tram rails still required maintenance, and the minute book records that the track outside the Mechanics Institute was replaced at the end of 1897.|$|E
25|$|During {{the late}} 1950s and early 1960s Frank Stella was a {{significant}} figure {{in the emergence of}} Minimalism, Post-Painterly Abstraction and Color Field painting. His shaped canvases of the 1960s like Harran II, 1967, revolutionized abstract painting. One of the most important characteristics of Stella's paintings is his use of repetition. His Black Pin Stripe paintings of 1959 <b>startled</b> <b>and</b> shocked an art world that was unused to seeing monochromatic and repetitive images, painted flat, with almost no inflexion. During the early 1960s Stella made several series' of notched Aluminum Paintings and shaped Copper Paintings before making multi-colored and asymmetrical shaped canvases of the late 1960s. Frank Stella's approach and relationship to Color Field painting was not permanent or central to his creative output; as his work became more and more three-dimensional after 1980.|$|E

40|$|LY 354740 is a conformationally {{constrained}} analog of gluta-mate {{which is}} a potent agonist for group II cAMP coupled metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs). The discovery of this novel pharmacological agent has allowed {{the exploration of the}} functional consequences of activating group II mGluRs in vivo. In an effort to evaluate the clinical utility of LY 354740 as an anxiolytic, we examined its effects in the fear potentiated <b>startle</b> <b>and</b> elevated plus maze models of anxiety and compared the results with the clinically prescribed anxiolytic diazepam. In the fear potentiated <b>startle</b> <b>and</b> elevated plus maze models, both LY 354740 and diazepam produced significant anxiolytic activ-ity (ED 50 values of 0. 3 and 0. 4 mg/kg p. o. for fear potentiated <b>startle</b> <b>and</b> 0. 2 and 0. 5 mg/kg for the elevated plus maze, respectively).

25|$|While in the garden, the {{children}} are surprised to see Ben Weatherstaff looking over the wall on a ladder. <b>Startled</b> <b>and</b> angry to find {{the children}} in the secret garden, he admits that he believed Colin to be a cripple. Colin stands up from his chair and finds that his legs are fine, though weak from long disuse. Colin soon spends every day in the garden, sometimes with Dickon as company. The children conspire to keep Colin's recovering health a secret, so as to surprise his father, who is travelling abroad. As Colin's health improves, his father sees a coinciding increase in spirits, culminating in a dream where his late wife calls to him from inside the garden. When he receives a letter from Mrs Sowerby, he takes the opportunity finally to return home. He walks the outer garden wall in his wife's memory, but hears voices inside, finds the door unlocked, and is shocked to see the garden in full bloom, and his son healthy. The servants watch, stunned, as Mr Craven and Colin walk back to the manor together.|$|E

500|$|There is {{a plaque}} on a {{monument}} in the Cimetière des Chiens pet cemetery which states, [...] "Il sauva la vie à 40 personnes.

The story goes that news had come that a Swiss soldier {{was lost in the}} mountains. Barry was searching for the soldier and had picked up the scent, some forty-eight hours old, and finally stopped before a large bank of ice. He dug until he reached the soldier, and then licked him as he was trained. The Swiss soldier awoke <b>startled</b> <b>and</b> mistook Barry for a wolf and fatally stabbed him with his bayonet. James Watson in his 1906 work The Dog Book attributed the rumour to fellow author Idstone, also known as Reverend Thomas Pearce.|$|E

Paul McCartney remembered going around to John Lennon's house in Weybridge to hear the song. According to McCartney, [...] "It seemed {{to go on and}} on forever. It was just beautiful... He showed all of us {{that it was possible to}} go a little further." [...] Frank Zappa had a more extreme reaction: [...] "When I heard 'Like a Rolling Stone', I wanted to quit the music business, because I felt: 'If this wins and it does what it's supposed to do, I don't need to do anything else...' But it didn't do anything. It sold but nobody responded to it in the way that they should have." [...] Nearly forty years later, in 2003, Elvis Costello commented on the innovative quality of the single. [...] "What a shocking thing to live in a world where there was Manfred Mann and the Supremes and Engelbert Humperdinck and here comes 'Like a Rolling Stone'".|$|E
500|$|In {{this chapter}} Beddard {{discusses}} the warning coloration (aposematism) of animals, which he notes [...] "have a precisely opposite tendency" [...] to camouflage, [...] "viz., to render their possessor conspicuous". He at once {{says that the}} explanation was [...] "first devised by Mr. Wallace" [...] for insects. The chapter therefore begins with the insects, often using English species as examples. He examines critically whether eye-like markings and other warnings actually work. He discusses experiments by Poulton on the elephant hawk-moth, where a Sand lizard is only briefly <b>startled,</b> <b>and</b> his own at the London zoo using a range of predators and different insects. Beddard is only partially convinced, flirting with Dr. Eisig's theory that the pigments creating the colours of caterpillars are inherently distasteful, and hence that [...] "the brilliant colours (i.e. the abundant secretion of pigment) have caused the inedibility of the species, rather than that the inedibility has necessitated the production of bright colours as an advertisement." [...] So Beddard suggests that [...] "the advent of bird-life proved a disastrous event for these animals, and compelled them to undergo various modifications", except when they were already by luck warning coloured and distasteful.|$|E
500|$|Claims that Bury {{could have}} been the Ripper began to appear in {{newspapers}} shortly after Bury's arrest. Like Bury, the Ripper had inflicted abdominal wounds on his victims immediately after their deaths, and Bury lived in Bow, near Whitechapel, from October 1887 to January 1889, which placed him fairly near the Whitechapel murders at the appropriate time. The Dundee Advertiser of 12 February claimed that the Burys' [...] "neighbours were <b>startled</b> <b>and</b> alarmed at the idea that one whom in their terror they associated with the Whitechapel tragedies had been living in their midst." [...] The New York Times of the same day connected Bury directly to the atrocities and reported the theory that William had murdered Ellen to prevent her from revealing his guilt, a story picked up and repeated by The Dundee Courier the following day. The Courier alleged that Bury admitted to Lieutenant Parr that he was Jack the Ripper, but Parr's version of the story says only that Bury said he was afraid he would be arrested as Jack the Ripper. Bury denied any connection, despite making a full confession to his wife's murder. Nevertheless, the executioner James Berry promoted the idea that Bury was the Ripper. Berry did not include Bury or the Ripper in his memoirs, My Experiences as an Executioner, but Ernest A. Parr, a journalist in the Suffolk town of Newmarket, wrote to the Secretary of State for Scotland on 28 March 1908 that Berry [...] "told me explicitly that Bury was known to have been Jack the Ripper".|$|E

40|$|Acoustic <b>startle</b> {{response}} <b>and</b> freezing {{were measured}} in a potentiated startle paradigm {{in which a}} startle stimulus was presented either alone or {{in the presence of}} a light conditioned stimulus (CS) which had been paired previously with either 1 -mA or 3 -mA footshock. During the CS the 1 -mA group had higher <b>startle</b> amplitudes <b>and</b> a higher percentage of freezing than the 3 -mA group. Startle amplitude was positively correlated with freezing under all conditions. The nonmonotonic relation between potentiated <b>startle</b> <b>and</b> shock intensity replicated Davis and Astrachan's (1978) study. However, rather than suppressing startle, as they suggested, freezing facilitated <b>startle</b> <b>and,</b> like <b>startle</b> amplitude, was non-monotonically related to shock intensity. Experiment 2 replicated these results and showed a regularly decreasing monotonic extinction function for potentiated <b>startle</b> <b>and</b> shock-associated freezing for both shock-level groups. Brown, Kalish, and Farber (1951) reported that the magnitude of the acoustic startle response was increased when the startle-elic-iting stimulus was presented in conjunction with a stimulus previously paired with shock. This phenomenon, now commonly called the potentiated startle effect, has been frequently replicated (Davis, 1979; Davis & Astrachan, 1978; Kurtz & Siegel, 1966). The phenome-non is typically considered, following Brown et al., as evidence that startle is increased by fear, and it has been recommended as a paradigm for studying Pavlovian fear condi-tioning and the effects of fear-reducing drug...|$|R
