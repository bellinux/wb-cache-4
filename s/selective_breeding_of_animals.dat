40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the reasons for}} keeping small ruminants and investigates {{the areas in which}} technological improvements are likely to have most impact in increasing the output from sheep and goat enterprises in hot climates. The most important areas in which biological manipulation can raise productivity lie in the areas of improved nutrition and increased survival of young animals. Nutritional studies of animals receiving diets of natural tropical grazing and browse may not reflect the rations actually consumed due to the ability of animals to select high quality forage from what is on offer. One suggestion is made as to how this selection can be exploited to increase the productivity of the herd as a whole. Improved health care offers the largest potential for increases in productivity by reducing the large mortality of young animals seen in many tropical production schemes. Much of this mortality has its roots in parasite infection. Anthelmatics have proved valuable for short term therapy but the speed at which parasites become resistant to drugs indicates that <b>selective</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> with resistance to parasites is a more valuable long term solution...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} the development of haematological indices in the MeLiM strain of miniature pigs. MeLiM minipigs in group M were affected with hereditary malignant melanoma and received 100 mg Fe 3 + dextran i. m. on day 3 of age. Group H contained melanoma-free MeLiM minipigs that were supplemented with iron as in group M. Melanoma-free MeLiM minipigs without iron supplementation till the week 5 of age were included in group A. Development of haematological indices in group H was compared to literature data from other breeds and strains of minipigs.

40|$|<b>Selective</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> for {{increased}} disease resistance {{is an effective}} strategy to reduce mortality in aquaculture. However, implementation of selective breeding programs is limited by an incomplete understanding of host resistance traits. We previously reported results of a rainbow trout selection program that demonstrated increased survival following challenge with Flavobacterium psychrophilum, the causative agent of bacterial cold water disease (BCWD). Mechanistic study of disease resistance identified a positive phenotypic correlation between post-challenge survival and spleen somatic-index (SI). Herein, we investigated the hypothesis of a genetic correlation between the two traits influenced by colocalizing QTL. We evaluated the inheritance and calculated the genetic correlation in five year-classes of odd- and even-year breeding lines. A total of 322 pedigreed families (n = 25, 369 fish) were measured for disease resistance, and 251 families (n = 5, 645 fish) were evaluated for SI. Spleen index was moderately heritable in both even-year (h 2 = 0. 5660. 18) and odd-year (h 2 = 0. 6060. 15) lines. A significant genetic correlation between SI and BCWD resistance was observed in the even-year line (rg = 0. 4560. 20, P = 0. 03) {{but not in the}} odd-year line (rg = 0. 1660. 12, P = 0. 19).

30|$|The {{domestication}} {{of animals}} and plants has had an important impact {{on the progress of}} human civilization (Diamond 2002). The discovery and domestication of plants and animals transformed human civilization from the primitive hunting lifestyle to the traditional pattern of agricultural farming, greatly promoting the development of human civilization (Zeder 2015; Zohary and Hopf 2000). The <b>selective</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> and plants during the process of domestication has significantly altered their genes and traits compared to those of wild populations (Bruford et al. 2003; Giuffra et al. 2000; Rubin et al. 2010). Canines are carnivores whose wide distribution is closely related to humans. Some studies have shown that dogs, the first domesticated vertebrate, were domesticated by humans from wolves in East Asia approximately 15, 000  years ago (Savolainen et al. 2002). However, recent findings suggest that the domestication of dogs may have occurred earlier, during the late Pleistocene in modern day Belgium (Germonpré et al. 2009), the Czech Republic (Germonpré et al. 2012), and southwestern Siberia (Ovodov et al. 2011). Therefore, the timing and location of dog domestication is still unclear (Larson et al. 2012; Perri 2016). In dogs, genes for digestion, metabolism, nerves and tumors show a coevolutionary trend with humans (Wang et al. 2013), and the increased ability of dogs to digest starch in food relative to wolves has been demonstrated at the genome level (Axelsson et al. 2013). A mitochondrial genomes study for present-day dogs and wolves and fossil canids suggested that wolves may come into contact with European hunters and share the food from hunters, thus, Europeans domesticated wolves and turned them into dogs (Thalmann et al. 2013). Bosch et al. (2015) suggested that as real carnivores, the main food source of wild wolves were mammals including ungulates and non-ungulates. Although wild wolves sometimes choose to eat some vegetations, the amount of vegetal matters they eat is negligible compared to the amount of meat they eat. Gao et al. (1996) and Yan et al. (2006) found that in China, the main food sources of wild wolves lived in Inner Mongolia were ungulates, including a considerable number of livestock. Unlike wild wolves, present-day dogs have a more diverse diet, mainly including starch food, fat and protein (Lasater and Mooers 1993; Rowe et al. 1997). However, although the whole genome characteristics of wolves and domestic dogs has been well studied, the differences in the structure and function of digestive tract flora between wolves and domestic dogs remains open to question.|$|E
40|$|Designing and {{implementing}} sustainable breeding management programmes {{is one of}} the most practical means of improving efficiency in livestock production, particularly in developing countries. The success or failure of an improvement programme hinges strongly on the compatibility of the programme with the objectives of the farming community targeted. This report contributes to a better understanding of the pre-existing breeding management strategies within cattle-keeping communities of the EADD project sites, and will help in the definition of appropriate breeding objectives and the design and implementation of a sustainable breeding programme for the small holder farmers. The farmers in the three countries rear a variety of cattle, classified into two broad categories as exotic and indigenous breed-types. More exotic breed-types are reared in Kenya than in Rwanda and Uganda. Among the exotic breed-types reared, the Holstein-Friesian is most popular in all the countries. The Ayrshire breed-type is also very popular in Kenya. In Uganda, the most common type of cattle are the indigenous Ankole, while in Rwanda, various crosses are popular. There are no written records available on individual animals. The breed-type of animal raised on a farm is significantly influenced by the age and level of education of the head of the household. On average, in households headed by older and more educated people, there are more exotic breed-types of animals reared. These households also live in areas with higher human population density. Farmers implement some form of controlled mating, either to minimize inbreeding, or to seek better mates among the population available. There is also some degree of planned cross-breeding taking place in all the countries. On most farms, animals calved down for the first time when they were above 27 months old, with exotic animals calving at a younger age than indigenous ones. Calving intervals were on average longer in Kenya than in the other countries. Indigenous animals tended to calve for the first time at close to four years of age in Uganda where malnutrition was noted as a key factor requiring to be addressed. More than 10 % of the animals on farms within the three countries were culled in a 12 month period with a replacement rate of less than 5 %, implying an overall reduction in herd size over time. The most desirable traits in exotic animals raised in all three countries were high milk production and good body conformation. In the indigenous breed-types reared, adaptability was the most important trait in all the countries. An interesting observation was that not all farmers raised the breed-type of animal that they admired most. It was clear that the farmers were knowledgeable to some degree on several aspects related to <b>selective</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals.</b> To effect change in the existing production systems, in addition to availing improved breeding materials at an affordable cost, capacity development using simplified messages targeted to address specific knowledge gaps concerning breed choice, reproduction and selection decisions is required.

40|$|As an {{approach}} to investigating mechanisms of anesthetic action, studies using <b>selective</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> stocks with different anesthetic sensitivity have increased during recent years.

Infected lambs have a reduced ability to absorb nutrients from the gastrointestinal tract, resulting in morbidity and occasional mortality. The current chemo-dominant approach to nematode control is considered unsustainable due to the increasing incidence of anthelmintic resistance. In addition there is growing consumer demand for food products from animals not subjected to chemical treatment. Future mechanisms of nematode control must rely on alternative, sustainable strategies such as vaccination or <b>selective</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>of</b> resistant <b>animals.</b> Such strategies take advantage of the host's natural immune response to nematodes. The ability to resist gastrointestinal nematode infection is considered to be dependent on the development of a protective acquired immune response; although the precise immune mechanisms involved in initiating this process remain to be fully elucidated.

40|$|ABSTRACT: A new hairless mutant of Peromyscus callfomlcus Inslgnls Is described.

Animals destined to become completely hairless are bom with a coat of hair that is indistinguishable from that of normal mice until 2 to 3 weeks of age. However, following this period, the pelage be-comes thinner In a given area, with some of the mice becoming completely hairless within 4 to 8 months. The homozygous hairless stock of this strain has been reared and maintained In labora-tory conditions for nine years. THE FIRST REPORT of hairless Peromyscus (American deer mice) was by Sumner 7 in 1924. The hairless mice, P. maniculatus gambelii, appeared in two apparently independent lines of descent. In one case, the first hairless animal was only one generation distant from one of its wild ancestors, while in the other there had been a lapse of four generations. The hairlessness in P. m. gambelii is a simple autosomal recessive characteristic.

While the <b>selective</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>of</b> terrestrial <b>animals</b> has been essential to the human success story, the <b>breeding</b> <b>of</b> aquatic organisms has only recently received serious attention. Aquaculture research urgently needs both specific genetic resources for existing aquatic species, and generalised workflows and pipelines for the generation of resources for newly cultivated species.

The resultant single nucleotide polymorphisms were filtered according to quality, property and suitability for probe-based high-throughput genotyping technology. The final SNP panel consisted of 94 mass genotyping assays that gave 100 % accurate parentage in independent samples of known pedigree.

40|$|Infectious {{diseases}} in farm <b>animals</b> are <b>of</b> major concern because <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> welfare, production costs, and public health. Farms undergo huge economic losses due to infectious disease. The costs of infections in farm animals are mainly due to production losses, treatment <b>of</b> infected <b>animals,</b> and disease control strategies. Control strategies, however, {{are not always}} successful. <b>Selective</b> <b>breeding</b> for the animals that can mount a defence against infection could therefore be a promising approach. Defensive ability <b>of</b> an <b>animal</b> has two main mechanisms: resistance (ability to control the pathogen burden) and tolerance (ability to maintain performance when pathogen burden increases). When {{it is difficult to}} distinguish between resistance and tolerance, defensive ability is measured as resilience that is the ability to maintain performance during a disease outbreak regardless of pathogen burden. Studies have focused on the genetics of resistance and resilience with little known about the genetics of tolerance and its relationship with resistance and resilience. The objectives of this thesis were to: 1) estimate the genetic variation in resistance, tolerance, and resilience to infection in order to assess the amenability of these traits for <b>selective</b> <b>breeding</b> in farm animals, 2) estimate the genetic correlation between resistance, tolerance and resilience and 3) detect genomic regions associated with resistance, tolerance, and resilience. In chapter 2, we studied the variation among sows in response to porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS). First a statistical method was developed to detect PRRS outbreaks based on reproduction records of sows. The method showed a high sensitivity (78 %) for disease phases. Then the variation of sows in response to PRRS was quantified using 2 models on the traits number of piglets born alive (NBA) and number of piglets born dead (LOSS) : 1) bivariate model considering the trait in healthy and disease phases as different traits, and 2) reaction norm model modelling the response of sows as a linear regression of the trait on herd-year-week estimates of NBA. Trait correlations between healthy and disease phases deviated from unity (0. 57 ± 0. 13 – 0. 87 ± 0. 18). The repeatabilities ranged from 0. 07 ± 0. 027 to 0. 16 ± 0. 005. The reaction norm model had higher predictive ability in disease phase compared to the bivariate model. In chapter 3 we studied 1) the genetic variation in resistance and tolerance of sheep to gastrointestinal nematode infection and 2) the genetic correlation between resistance and tolerance. Sire models on faecal nematode egg count (FEC), IgA, and pepsinogen were used to study the genetic variation in resistance. Heritability for resistance traits ranged from 0. 19 ± 0. 10 to 0. 59 ± 0. 20. A random regression model was used to study the reaction norm of sheep body weight on FEC as an estimate of tolerance to nematode infection. We observed a significant genetic variance in tolerance (P< 0. 05). Finally a bivariate model was used to study the genetic correlation between resistance and tolerance. We observed a negative genetic correlation (- 0. 63 ± 0. 25) between resistance and tolerance. In chapter 4, we studied the response to selection in resistance and tolerance when using estimated breeding values for resilience. We used Monte Carlo simulation to generate 100 half-sib families with known breeding values for resistance (pathogen burden) and tolerance. We used selection index theory to predict response to selection for resistance and tolerance: 1) when pathogen burden is known and selection is based on true breeding values for resistance and tolerance and 2) when pathogen burden is unknown and selection is based on estimated breeding values for resilience. Using EBV for resilience in absence of records for pathogen burden resulted in favourable responses in resistance and tolerance to infections, with more emphasis on tolerance than on resistance. However, more genetic gain in resistance and tolerance could be achieved when pathogen burden was known. In chapter 5 we studied genomics regions associated with resistance, resilience, and tolerance to PRRS. Resistance was modelled as sire effect on area under the PRRS viremia curve up to 14 days post infection (AUC 14). Resilience was modelled as sire effects on daily growth of pigs up to 28 days post infection (ADG 28). Tolerance was modelled as the sire effect on the regression of ADG 28 on AUC 14. We identified a major genomics region on chromosome 4 associated with resistance and resilience to PRRS. We also identified genomics regions on chromosome 1 associated with tolerance to PRRS. In the general discussion (chapter 6) I discussed: 1) response to infection as a special case of genotype by environment interaction, 2) random regression model as a statistical tool for studying response to disease, 3) advantages and requirements of random regression models, and 4) <b>selective</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>of</b> farm <b>animals</b> for resistance, tolerance, and resilience to infections. I concluded that random regression is a powerful approach to estimate response to infection in animals. If the adequate amount of data is available random regression model could estimate <b>breeding</b> values <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> more accurately compared to other models. I also concluded that before including resistance and tolerance into breeding programs, breeders should make sure about the added values of including these traits on genetic progress. <b>Selective</b> <b>breeding</b> for resilience could be a pragmatic approach to simultaneously improve resistance and tolerance...|$|R
