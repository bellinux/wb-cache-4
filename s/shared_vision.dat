5|$|A playable demo of Final Fantasy XIII was {{included}} in the Japanese version of , released on April 16, 2009. Toriyama stated that the release of the demo, which was not in the original development schedule, helped the team recognize a <b>shared</b> <b>vision</b> for what the game should look and feel like, a problem which had been plaguing the development team up until then. It helped the team prioritize the work that still needed to be done, which increased the development speed {{for the remainder of the}} project. The game was intended to appeal to both Western and Japanese audiences, and focus groups from both regions were used. The English localization began while development was still in progress to lessen the delay between the Japanese and worldwide releases. The game was initially going to be released solely for the PlayStation 3, but an Xbox 360 version was announced late in the game's development cycle. The Xbox version, due to technical limitations, runs at a lower resolution (720p maximum) than the PlayStation version and is spread across 3 discs.|$|E
