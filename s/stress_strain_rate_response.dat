Data was obtained at high <b>strain</b> <b>rates</b> and large <b>strains</b> using the split Hopkinson pressure bar technique. This information, plus additional data from the literature, was used to critically evaluate {{the ability of the}} Johnson Cook material model to represent the deformation and failure response of Ti- 6 AMV and 2024 -T 3 under conditions relevant to simulations of engine containment and the influence of uncontained engine debris on aircraft structures. This model is being used in the DYNA 3 D finite element code, which is being developed/validated for evaluating aircraft/engine designs relative to the federal airworthiness standards and for improving mitigation/containment technology. The results of the experimental work reported here were used to define a new set of material constants for the strength component of the Johnson Cook model for Ti- 6 Al- 4 V and 2024 -T 3. The capabilities and limitations of the model are reviewed. The model can accurately represent the stress-strain response of the materials.

40|$|As cast cadmium rods were slid against alumina at {{a load of}} 50 N {{and sliding}} speeds from 0. 1 ms^- 1 to 4 ms^- 1. The wear {{characteristics}} of cadmium were related to its <b>strain</b> <b>rate</b> <b>response</b> under uniaxial compression between <b>strain</b> <b>rates</b> of 0. 001 s^- 1 to 100 s^- 1 and temperatures {{in the range of}} 323 K to 573 K. In uniaxial compression, cadmium undergoes adiabatic shear banding at <b>strain</b> <b>rates</b> > 10 s^- 1 and temperature up to 423 K. The intensity of this adiabatic shear banding reduces as the temperature is increased or the <b>strain</b> <b>rate</b> is reduced. This adiabatic shear banding is the only major microstructural response, in the present test region, that promotes cracking. At temperatures greater than 473 K the flow becomes homogeneous and no adiabatic shear banding is observed. The <b>strain</b> <b>rates</b> and temperatures existing during sliding are estimated using a simple non-iterative procedure and superimposed on the <b>strain</b> <b>rate</b> <b>response</b> map. At sliding speeds < 1. 0 ms^- 1 the near surface regions are likely to undergo adiabatic shear banding induced cracking. As the velocity of sliding increases the subsurface temperature increases making the regions close to the surface move towards regions of lower adiabatic shear banding intensity and finally to regions of homogeneous flow. It is seen that wear rates when the near surface <b>strain</b> <b>rate</b> <b>response</b> is expected to be adiabatic shear banding, which promotes cracking, is higher than when the near surface regions are in the homogeneous flow region. This indicates that when the <b>strain</b> <b>rate</b> <b>response</b> of a material promotes cracking at near surface regions the wear rates are higher.

The sliding speed was varied from 0. 01 to 1. 4 ms(- 1), normal load was varied from 15. 3 to 76 N and with a sliding distance of 1500 m. It was seen that dry sliding wear behavior of titanium was governed by combination of tribo-oxidation and <b>strain</b> <b>rate</b> <b>response</b> in near surface region of titanium. <b>Strain</b> <b>rate</b> <b>response</b> of titanium was recorded by conducting uni-axial compression tests at constant true <b>strain</b> <b>rate</b> of 100 s(- 1) in the temperature range from 298 to 873 K.

This trend was confirmed by performing series of dry sliding tests under vacuum condition of 2 x 10 (- 4) Torr.

40|$|During {{agitated}} drying {{and mixing}} processes, particle beds {{are exposed to}} shear deformation. This leads to particle attrition, the extent of which {{is dependent on the}} prevailing <b>stresses</b> and <b>strains</b> in the bed. The distributions of shear <b>stresses</b> and <b>strain</b> <b>rates</b> within the bed are highly non-uniform, requiring attention to localised conditions. Therefore a narrow angular sector of the bed is divided radially and vertically into a number of measurement cells, within which the <b>stresses</b> and <b>strain</b> <b>rates</b> are calculated throughout one rotation by the Distinct Element Method. These are then used in an empirical relationship of material breakage to predict the extent of attrition due to agitation. Here we investigate the influence of the measurement cell size on the estimated <b>stresses</b> and <b>strain</b> <b>rates,</b> and the subsequent effect on the predicted attrition. The measurement cell size is altered by varying the measurement sector size and the number of radial and vertical divisions within it. The median particle size is also varied to establish its influence on the predicted attrition. An increase in the average number of particles in a given cell, by varying the particle size or measurement cell dimensions, leads to a reduction in the estimated <b>stresses</b> and <b>strain</b> <b>rates,</b> and therefore a reduction in the predicted attrition. Comparison of the predicted attrition with the experimental breakage in the agitated vessel shows that the prediction method is accurate when the cell dimensions are comparable to the width of a naturally occurring shear band...|$|R

This unique tribological behavior of titanium is likely {{due to the fact that}} titanium undergoes adiabatic shear banding at high <b>strain</b> <b>rates,</b> which creates pathways for lower resistance shear planes.

40|$|Titanium (Ti) {{and copper}} (Cu) pins were slid against alumina in a {{pin-on-disk}} machine at {{a load of}} 50 N and sliding speeds varying from 0. 1 to 4 ms^- 1. The evolution of the microstructure in the subsurface of the material and the wear rate was co-related to the <b>strain</b> <b>rate</b> microstructural <b>response</b> of the material in uniaxial compression, at different <b>strain</b> <b>rates</b> (0. 1 - 100 s^- 1) and temperatures (298 - 673 K). The <b>strain</b> <b>rates</b> and temperatures in the plastically deforming zone near {{the surface of the}} pins were determined using noniterative methods. The <b>strain</b> <b>rates</b> were found to be in the region of 100 s^- 1 near the surface and decreases as one moves into the sub-surface of the pin. The temperatures increased as the speed increased. These estimated <b>strain</b> <b>rates</b> and temperatures were superimposed on the <b>strain</b> <b>rate</b> microstructural <b>response</b> maps of these materials. The uniaxial compression test results of Ti showed adiabatic shear banding as a microstructural mechanism that evolves at high <b>strain</b> <b>rates</b> (≥ 10 s^- 1) and lower temperatures (< 575 K). Adiabatic shear bands are sites of easy crack nucleation and propagation. When Ti is slid at low speeds the near surface region of the pins deform in the adiabatic shear banding regions in the <b>strain</b> <b>rate</b> microstructural <b>response</b> map. At such speeds the wear rate is found to be high and reduces as the sliding speed is increased, when the material undergoes a more homogeneous deformation. The microstructural response of Cu under uniaxial compression showed that the material undergoes flow banding at intermediate <b>strain</b> <b>rates</b> (1 s^- 1) and temperatures of up to 473 K. The subsurface microstructure of the pins slid at low speeds showed subsurface cracking and sheet like debris formation. This happen at lower speeds because the flow banding and crack nucleation is expected in the subsurface where the <b>strain</b> <b>rates</b> and temperatures are lower. The present test results show a clear relation to exist between the <b>strain</b> <b>rate</b> <b>response</b> of the material in uniaxial compression and its subsurface microstructural evolution and wear rate...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Master) [...] İzmir Institute of Technology, Materials Science and Engineering, İzmir, 2002 Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves: 73 - 76) Text in English; Abstract: Turkish and Englishx, 84 leavesA numerical {{investigation has}} been conducted on the <b>strain</b> <b>rate</b> dependent compression mechanical behavior of a SiC-particulate reinforced Al (2024 -O) metal matrix composite. The effect of particle volume fraction on the <b>strain</b> <b>rate</b> sensitivity of the composite was determined using axisymmetric Finite Element unit cell models, where the particles are treated as elastic spheres embedded within a visco-plastic matrix, implemented in LUSAS Finite Element Analysis program. Particles are taken to be elastic, equal-sized, spherical and uniformly distributed in the matrix. The <b>strain</b> <b>rate</b> dependent constitutive behavior of the matrix material uses a linear relation between <b>stress</b> and <b>strain</b> <b>rate</b> formulation and is obtained from independent experimental results on the matrix. The flow stress of the composites is predicted over a range of <b>strain</b> <b>rates</b> for different particle volume fractions. Numerical results of the flow <b>stress</b> and <b>strain</b> <b>rate</b> sensitivity of the composite were also {{compared with those of}} experimental results, for 15 % SiC particle reinforced 2024 -O Al metal matrix composite. Influence of particle shape on the behavior of the MMC at high <b>strain</b> <b>rates</b> is also investigated. A unit cell, which is an elastic cylinder embedded within a visco-plastic matrix, is used. It is also shown that the rate dependent flow stress and local stress in the microstructure are influenced by particle shape. If reinforcement edge sharpness increases, local stress increases at that area. The results show that both the flow <b>stress</b> and the <b>strain</b> <b>rate</b> sensitivity increase with increasing volume fraction of the reinforcement due to the constraining effect of the reinforcement. Numerical calculations have shown an increased <b>strain</b> <b>rate</b> sensitivity of the composite over the matrix alloy. The discrepancy found between numerical and experimental results was finally discussed based on geometrical and microstructural parameters that might affect the composite flow <b>stress</b> and <b>strain</b> <b>rate</b> sensitivity...|$|R
40|$|High {{intensity}} stress waves {{resulting from}} impact loading {{are known to}} increase the possibility of failure in many engineering structures. Elastomeric materials such as rubber {{have been used in}} such cases as stress wave attenuators with varying degree of success. Stress wave theory offers a practical approach to study the dynamic behaviour of such systems and suggests criteria for an appropriate design. This paper presents an analysis of high intensity stress waves in a simulated structural system to study the effects of <b>stresses</b> and <b>strain</b> <b>rates</b> due to transient waves. A geometric modelling approach is used to develop an equivalent simplified model of the structural system and to determine the <b>stress</b> and <b>strain</b> <b>rate</b> attenuation factors. Theoretical analysis and results agree well with the experimental results obtained from the actual system...|$|R
