5|$|A common {{assumption}} in mammalogy is {{that small}} mammals cannot subsist entirely on plant material {{and must have}} a high-calorie diet in order to <b>survive.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> result, {{it was thought that}} the diet of tiny primates must be high in protein-containing insects (insectivory). Research has shown, however, that mouse lemurs, the smallest living primates, consume more fruit than insects, contradicting the popular hypothesis.|$|E

However, Mari was allowed to <b>survive</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> small village under Babylonian administration, an act that Hammurabi considered merciful. Later, Mari became part of Assyria and was listed among the territories conquered by the Assyrian king Tukulti-Ninurta I (reigned 1243–1207 BC). Afterward, Mari constantly changed hands between Assyria and Babylon.|$|E

5|$|While the Lingbao {{school did}} not <b>survive</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{distinct}} entity, its ritual apparatus did, and it {{forms the basis}} for present-day Daoist ritual practice. In addition, many of the innovations introduced by the Lingbao School have survived to the present, including its division of the Daozang into three sections corresponding to different teachings, with the Dongzhen corresponding to the Shangqing School, the Dongxuan to the Lingbao School, and the Dongshen to the Sanhuang teaching. The integration of Buddhism within Lingbao practices and beliefs ensured that Buddhist elements would remain {{an important aspect of}} later Daoism, and also aided in integrating Buddhism into all levels of society in China.|$|E
5|$|Originally, {{the plant}} {{consisted}} of the company offices and the large Manufacturing Building. The Mason house, which would become the company office was originally constructed in 1861. It is a two-story brick Italianate style house that was converted {{to be used as}} an office building and significantly modified throughout the years. The 1929 addition added a wing that connected it to the metal products building which was built that year. In 1942, a two-story front addition was added and another addition to the west was added around 1950. These additions also resulted in the removal of the cupola, brick chimneys, front entry, and veranda. The Manufacturing building, constructed from 1912 to 1913, is three stories high on the river side and two stories on the east. It is divided into 31 bays with pilasters. At each end of the building are stairs and elevator towers. The structural remains of the original glass house <b>survive</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> sub-basement in a one-story extension {{at the south end of}} the building.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the early}} hours of September6, Nate became quasi-stationary under a weak {{steering}} pattern between Hurricane Maria and a disturbance over The Bahamas. Satellite imagery indicated that the cloud pattern continued to organize with excellent outflow surrounding the storm. Late on September6 a developing banding eye feature became evident. Tropical Storm Nate strengthened further and became a hurricane at 1200 UTCon September7, as it began to turn away from Bermuda. Some models indicated that Nate could have been either absorbed by or merged with the larger Hurricane Maria, but the National Hurricane Center (NHC) forecast that Nate would <b>survive</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> separate system, which it did. The large low to the northeast of The Bahamas gradually opened into a broad trough as a shortwave trough approached from the northwest. The larger trough slowly became elongated in a northeast–southwest manner late on September7. At the same time, the shortwave trough moved southward along {{the west side of the}} other trough. The increasing southwesterly flow along the southeast side of the broad trough caused Nate to accelerate northeastward. Nate reached its peak intensity of 90mph (145km/h) late on September8 as it passed 120miles (205km) southeast of Bermuda, while its strongest winds remained well offshore.|$|E

She was the first female publishing sales representative in Canada. Leaving J.M. Dent in 1930, Davidson spent a year attempting to <b>survive</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> writer. During this time she wrote articles for The Globe and Mail and Chatelaine magazine. In 1931 she was hired by William Perkins Bull to coordinate the publication of a 12-volume edition of Canadiana. She worked on the project for seven years. By the time it was completed she was in charge of a staff of 70 researchers.|$|E

25|$|Rice, a monocot, is {{normally}} grown as an annual plant, although in tropical areas it can <b>survive</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> perennial and {{can produce a}} ratoon crop for up to 30 years. Rice cultivation is well-suited to countries and regions with low labor costs and high rainfall, as it is labor-intensive to cultivate and requires ample water. However, rice can be grown practically anywhere, even on a steep hill or mountain area {{with the use of}} water-controlling terrace systems. Although its parent species are native to Asia and certain parts of Africa, centuries of trade and exportation have made it commonplace in many cultures worldwide.|$|E
25|$|In various {{speeches and}} articles, Swamy has {{expressed}} his admiration for, and solidarity with, the State of Israel and has credited its retaliatory capacity {{for its ability}} to <b>survive</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> nation in a hostile Arab environment. Swamy made pioneering efforts towards India's establishment of diplomatic relations with Israel. In 1982, Swamy became the first Indian political leader to make a well-publicised trip to Israel, where he met with several important Israeli leaders such as Yitzhak Rabin and then-Prime Minister Menachem Begin. His efforts at normalising relations with Israel have borne fruit with both India as well as Israels decision, in 1992, to facilitate the building of embassies in their respective countries.|$|E
25|$|The Nintendo DS spinoff {{is titled}} Spore Creatures, {{focusing}} on the Creature phase. The game is a 2D/3D story-based role-playing game as the gamer plays a creature kidnapped by a UFO and forced {{to survive in a}} strange world, with elements of Nintendogs. Another Spore title for the DS called Spore Hero Arena was released in 2009. Spore Origins is the mobile phone/iPhone/iPod spinoff of Spore, and as with the Nintendo DS version, focuses on a single phase of gameplay; in this case, the cell phase. The simplified game allows players to try to <b>survive</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> multicellular organism in a tide pool, similar to flow. The iPhone version takes advantage of the device's touch capabilities and 3-axis accelerometer.|$|E

25|$|The Lacandons are descendents of {{the ancient}} Maya. Since the 16th century, {{they have been able}} to <b>survive</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> culture by living deep in the rainforest, with many {{communities}} out of contact with the rest of the world until the 20th century. Before the Conquest, the Lacandon dominated about a million hectares of these lands, but since then they have been encroached upon, mostly by indigenous from other areas of Chiapas since the early 20th century. This has dramatically altered their lifestyle and worldview. Today the Lacandon Maya are primarily found in three villages called Naja, Lacanja Chansayab and Metzobok. near the ruins of Bonampak and Yaxchilan. Local lore states that the gods resided here when they lived on earth.|$|E
25|$|The terms {{substrate}} and superstrate {{are often}} used when two languages interact. However, the meaning of these terms is reasonably well-defined only in second language acquisition or language replacement events, when the native speakers of a certain source language (the substrate) are somehow compelled to abandon it for another target language (the superstrate). The outcome of such an event is that erstwhile speakers of the substrate will use some version of the superstrate, at least in more formal contexts. The substrate may <b>survive</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> second language for informal conversation. As demonstrated by the fate of many replaced European languages (such as Etruscan, Breton, and Venetian), {{the influence of the}} substrate on the official speech is often limited to pronunciation and a modest number of loanwords. The substrate might even disappear altogether without leaving any trace.|$|E
25|$|Sea lice, {{particularly}} Lepeophtheirus salmonis {{and various}} Caligus species, including C. clemensi and C. rogercresseyi, can cause deadly infestations of both farm-grown and wild salmon. Sea lice are ectoparasites which feed on mucus, blood, and skin, and migrate and latch onto {{the skin of}} wild salmon during free-swimming, planktonic nauplii and copepodid larval stages, which can persist for several days. Large numbers of highly populated, open-net salmon farms can create exceptionally large concentrations of sea lice; when exposed in river estuaries containing large numbers of open-net farms, many young wild salmon are infected, and do not <b>survive</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> result. Adult salmon may survive otherwise critical numbers of sea lice, but small, thin-skinned juvenile salmon migrating to sea are highly vulnerable. On the Pacific coast of Canada, the louse-induced mortality of pink salmon in some regions is commonly over 80%.|$|E
