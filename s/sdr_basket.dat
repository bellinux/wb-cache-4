2500|$|During {{the week}} of 10 August 2015, against the {{background}} of a slowing Chinese economy and appreciation of the U.S. dollar, the People's Bank of China devalued the renminbi by about 5%. The devaluation was accomplished by pegging the official rate to closing market rates. A market-based [...] "representative" [...] exchange rate against the U.S. dollar is one of the requirements for designation of a currency as one with Special Drawing Rights (SDR) by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), one of China's goals. Since the late-2000s, China has sought to internationalize the renminbi. As of 2013, the RMB is the 8th most widely traded currency in the world.

While inflation-linked bonds and derivatives {{have been developed to}} hedge the effects of inflation, their limited supply and liquidity lead many investors to continue to rely on the indirect hedging properties of traditional asset classes. In this paper, we assess these properties over different time horizons, {{in the context of a}} diversified portfolio. Using a vector error correction model, we find that effective short-run hedges, such as commodities, may not work over longer horizons and that tactical asset allocation could enhance investment returns following inflation surprises.

The SDR is an artificial currency created in 1969 to implement the U. S. dollar as an reserve asset. The SDR has been used as the unit of account in IMF. Currently, the SDR consists of four currencies: $, €, £, and ¥. These four currencies are also the major reserve currencies held by the central banks. Two questions arise: Is the RMB ready to be a major reserve currency? What are the benefits and costs of being a reserve currency...|$|E

Published monthly since 1948, the International Financial Statistics (IFS) database is the principal statistical publication of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and is the standard source for all aspects of international and domestic finance. The database contains approximately 32, 000 time series for over 200 countries and geographical areas. It reports, for most countries, time series data on exchange rates, balance of payments, international liquidity, money and banking, interest rates, prices, production, international transactions, government accounts, national accounts and population. Selected data, including data on Fund accounts, international reserves and international trade, are also aggregated into regional and world tables. Data are reported {{in a mixture of}} indexes, national currencies, US Dollars and <b>SDRs</b> (the <b>basket</b> currency the IMF uses as a unit of account). Most annual data begin in 1948; quarterly and monthly data generally begin in 1957; most balance of payments data begin in 1970. This database was first provided by the UK Data Service in December 2003. The UK Data Service web site includes further information on its IMF IFS holdings, including a dataset user guide and details of latest database updates.

40|$|With {{the recent}} formal {{inclusion}} of the Renminbi (RMB) into the IMF’s Special Drawing Right (<b>SDR)</b> currency <b>basket,</b> prospects for further internationalization of the RMB are improving. However, as China attempts to simultaneously undergo an economic transition into a more balanced growth model, and the internationalization of its currency, pressures are mounting from the impossible trinity. The latter {{is based on the}} Mundell-Flemming model. The latter posits a policy-choice problem in which a country cannot simultaneously have unfettered capital movement, an independent monetary policy, and a fixed exchange rate system. Naturally, three baskets of policy combinations are possible. Historical events such as the Asian financial crisis (1997 - 1998) have demonstrated that countries are strictly bound by the impossible trinity. The paper posits that China should opt for the policy basket of a fully liberalized capital account, fully liberalized interest rates, and maintain its current basket peg exchange rate regime but eventually allow for a greater spread. The policy sequence should begin with the liberalization of the interest rates while maintaining the current level of capital controls. Once adequate time has been given to allow the domestic financial and economic system to adjust and consolidate itself, the liberalization of the capital account should be the next goal. Finally, the basket peg exchange rate regime should be allowed a greater float. While the interest rates and the capital account are undergoing liberalization, the exchange rate should operate as a policy tool so as to minimize shocks to the domestic economic system. The policy basket and sequence have been chosen because they are conducive to a risk-averse economic transition from the current export-led growth model. The paper visits the cases of Hong Kong, the United States, and the European Union to examine their policy choice vis-à-vis the impossible trinity {{in order to make a}} case for why China should opt for the suggested policy basket...|$|R

40|$|Reform of the {{international}} monetary system is under discussion after three decades of apathy. Tectonic shifts in the balance of international power have made reform more urgent. However, in the short term, there is little chance of a grand redesign of {{the international}} monetary system. Nevertheless, concrete steps should be taken. First, consensus is needed on exchange rates, capital flows and reserves. Second, financial safety nets must be improved so that countries do not have to self-insure by accumulating reserves or rely on possible bilateral swap lines to access liquidity. Third, a change in the composition of the Special Drawing Right should be planned for, to strengthen the multilateral framework. The most workable short-term deliverables seem to be (i) guidelines on and surveillance of capital controls; (ii) a new regime for deciding on SDR allocations that would facilitate more frequent use of this instrument; and (iii) the inclusion of the renmimbi in the <b>SDR</b> <b>basket.</b> These reforms would be a partial move, preparing the ground for further developments...|$|E
40|$|The SDR {{has enjoyed}} renewed {{attention}} lately {{in the context}} of debates on international monetary reform. To be sure, the term SDR has been used to refer to three different concepts—(i) a composite reserve asset created in 1969 : the “official SDR ” as defined in the Fund’s Articles; (ii) a potential new class of reserve assets: tradable SDRdenominated securities issued by the Fund or an investment vehicle backed by a subset of the Fund’s membership; and (iii) a unit of account, which could be used to price internationally traded assets (e. g., sovereign bonds) and goods (e. g., commodities), to peg currencies, and to report balance of payments data. All three are discussed here. � In these different roles, the SDR might help serve respectively the following objectives: reducing the extent and costs of international reserve accumulation; augmenting the supply of safe global assets and facilitating diversification; and reducing the impact of exchange rate volatility among major currencies. Expanding the <b>SDR</b> <b>basket</b> to major emerging market currencies presents trade-offs, but could further support these objectives. � In order {{to make a difference in}} any of these areas, the role played by the SDR would need to be enhanced considerably from its current insignificant level.
