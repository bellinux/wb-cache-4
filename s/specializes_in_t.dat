In addition there are subtypes <b>specialized</b> <b>in</b> <b>T</b> follicular helper-like function and Il-10 dependent regulatory functions. Once activated iNKT cells can impact the type and strength of an immune response. They engage in cross talk with other immune cells, like dendritic cells, neutrophils and lymphocytes.

40|$|Neutrophils use {{immunoglobulins}} {{to clear}} antigen, but {{their role in}} immunoglobulin production is unknown. Here we identified neutrophils around the marginal zone (MZ) of the spleen, a B cell area <b>specialized</b> <b>in</b> <b>T</b> cell–independent immunoglobulin responses to circulating antigen. Neutrophils colonized peri-MZ areas after postnatal mucosal colonization by microbes and enhanced their B cell–helper function after receiving reprogramming signals, including interleukin 10 (IL- 10), from splenic sinusoidal endothelial cells. Splenic neutrophils induced immunoglobulin class switching, somatic hypermutation and antibody production by activating MZ B cells through a mechanism that involved the cytokines BAFF, APRIL and IL- 21. Neutropenic patients had fewer and hypomutated MZ B cells and a lower abundance of preimmune immunoglobulins to T cell–independent antigens, which indicates that neutrophils generate an innate layer of antimicrobial immunoglobulin defense by interacting with MZ B cells. 0 SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

IMGT ® is {{the international}} reference in immuno-genetics and immunoinformatics. IMGT ® combines sequence databases (IMGT/LIGM-DB, IMGT/PRIMER-DB, IMGT/PROTEIN-DB, IMGT/MHC-DB), a genome database (IMGT/ GENE-DB), and a three-dimensional (3 D) structure database (IMGT / 3 Dstructure-DB) with interactive analysis tools (IMGT/V-QUEST, IMGT/JunctionAnalysis) and Web resources com-prising 8000 HTML pages (IMGT Repertoire). The accuracy and consistency of IMGT data are based on IMGT-ONTOLOGY, available for biologists and IMGT users in the IMGT Scientific chart and for computer scientists in IMGT-ML, in XML format.

40|$|The {{biosynthesis}} of MHC class II/peptide complexes involves classical, cell surface MHC {{products as}} well as the intracellular component H 2 -M, required for the removal of invariant chain-derived CLIP and for peptide loading. The function of another intracellular class II heterodimer, H 2 -O, is the matter of some controversy. The physical association of H 2 -O with H 2 -M and co-localization in class II+ vesicles suggest a related function in peptide exchange. Furthermore, the distinctive thymic distribution of H 2 -O raises the possibility of a <b>specialized</b> role <b>in</b> <b>T</b> cell thymic selection. To investigate the role of H 2 -O in vivo we generated mice carrying a targeted disruption in the H 2 -Oa gene. No evidence was obtained for a defect in removal of CLIP. However, the array of endogenous peptides bound by class II was altered and a defect in antigen presentation through H 2 -A to T cells was seen on the 129 /Sv/ C 57 BL/ 6 mixed strain background but not in 129 /Sv pure strain mice. Furthermore, H 2 -O-null mice showed enhanced selection of CD 4 + single positive thymocytes. The findings indicate that H 2 -O interacts with H 2 -M in peptide editing but that the genetic background in which H 2 -O deficiency is manifest is also important. Overall, the experiments indicate that H 2 -O/HLA-DO should be regarded as neither up-regulating nor down-regulating the DM-dependent release of CLIP, but as a modulator of peptide editing, determining the presenting cell type specific peptide profile able to retain stability in the class II groove...|$|R
