40|$|Using {{annual data}} from 1981 to 2002, the {{relationship}} between harvesting and processing of fish {{and the effects of}} imports on processing in New England were analyzed. Additionally, cause and effect relationships between harvesting and processing and between processing and imports were examined using Granger causality tests. Output from the fish processing sector is jointly driven by local fish landings and fish imports and unidirectional causalities exist from local landings to processing and from processing to imports. Generally, processors optimize business operations over multiple species and multiple supply sources. Rebuilding the groundfish stock would not lead to a dramatic and immediate increase in the processing industry. Instead, the actual growth in the processing sector would be relatively smaller than that in the harvesting <b>sector.</b> <b>Fish</b> processing, fish harvesting, fish imports, causality., Q 2, Q 22, L 66, Resource /Energy Economics and Policy,...|$|E

40|$|Designating {{small-scale}} fishing cooperatives as key actors in rights-based fisheries management represents a viable strategy for reconciling biological conservation with social objectives. Cooperatives are democratically-controlled enterprises designed {{to pursue the}} common interests of their members. In {{small-scale fishing}} communities, cooperatives provide a way for fishers to pool resources and engage in collective action towards social objectives including obtaining higher prices for fishers, investing in infrastructure, providing loans to members, {{and a range of}} community benefits. However, many aspects of the contemporary political and economic context of small-scale fisheries present barriers to the success of fishing cooperatives, such as competition with private <b>sector</b> <b>fish</b> buyers and middlemen and fewer opportunities for government subsidies and loans. Providing fishing cooperatives with exclusive fishing rights can bolster the success of fishing cooperatives by generating a strong incentive for members to actively participate in cooperatives instead of work independently or for individual fish buyers. I present a case study of fishing cooperatives from Yucatán, Mexico that highlights multiple social benefits arising from cooperatives’ participation in rights-based fisheries management. In Yucatán, exclusive 20 -year fishing concessions for spiny lobster have underpinned the success of large, successful, and long-lasting fishing cooperatives. These cooperatives have, in turn, promoted important social and conservation outcomes in small-scale fishing communities. They serve as livelihood opportunities and social safety nets for fishing families and enhance the broader well-being of fishing communities. Furthermore, they have played an important role as stewards of fishery conservation for multiple species and encourage fishers’ active participation in management...|$|E
40|$|European water {{legislation}} enforces increasingly restrictive measures {{with regards}} to reduction of water consumption and waste emission in order to minimise the potential environmental impact of the agro industry <b>sector.</b> <b>Fish</b> farms are particularly concerned, but legislation covering effluent discharge varies significantly from country to country. However, recommendations and directives from institutional, national or regional bodies suggest the enforcement of increasingly strict waste reduction measures {{and the development of}} waste treatment. Before treatment, it is necessary to evaluate waste production in terms of composition and quantity. The waste quantification methods used today for fish culture systems are either based on direct measurements of nutrient and suspended solid fluxes or on indirect evaluation based on the digestibility coefficients of the feed constituents. The objective of the present study is to evaluate the waste of a freshwater flow through farm using both approaches and to discuss their applicability, drawbacks and advantages from the viewpoints of fish farmers and control authorities. Waste production on the farm was monitored during several 24 hour cycles in order to characterise the effluents of the system. The predictions and measurements for the total nitrogen (TN) parameter were well correlated, but measured and predicted suspended solids (SS) and total phosphorus (TP) values presented a weaker correlation coefficient. The hydrobiological method gives details on the N and P forms of waste but this method is heavy {{and it is difficult to}} obtain representative samples and flow rate measurements. The nutritional method is the simplest to use, provided that feed data are available. (C) 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

The hake fish workers condition of employment, security of employment, social security issues, remunerations and their living conditions forms part of the social, economic and political dimensions in hake fisheries. The need for ensuring sustainable long-term utilisation of the hake resource and to manage, prevent and reduce all adverse effects of harvesting the hake stock through knowledge based intervention is crucial to this study. Sustainable fisheries management can use the working and living conditions of fish workers as indicators for effective management of fisheries. Fish workers issues, which include their conditions of service, contractual agreements, work safety, income, working hours and other human dimensions, may {{have an effect on}} the effective sustainable management. Ecosystems approaches takes into consideration the human dimensions and ecological consideration for effective fisheries management. Knowledge of the historical and economic importance of the hake sector is crucial for the planning and future of the fisheries. Applying the concept of the ecosystems approaches to hake fisheries management is also critical in understanding the human dimensions in hake fisheries. The qualitative methodology of field work was used in understanding the human dimensions in commercial hake fisheries. The investigation into the fish workers labour issues and living conditions through a field work highlighted that the labour issues such as type of employment (permanent or casual), conditions of employment (social security, regulated hours of work, good working conditions), stagnation in terms of promotion, remuneration and issues surrounding labour brokers are some of the social issues in the hake sector. The living conditions of fish workers, stagnation and improved remuneration should be attended to in the <b>sector.</b> <b>Fish</b> workers in the hake sector rely on wages for their livelihood.

40|$|The fishing {{industry}} in the Philippines was tantamount to a marine capture fishery in the 1950 s to 1960 s. Aquaculture and inland fishery production were not significant. Only during the 1970 s did aquaculture and inland capture fisheries contribute significantly to fish production. From 250 000 t fish production in 1951, this increased substantially to 1. 6 million t in the 1990 s. An average 4. 3 % was contributed by fisheries to {{the gross domestic product}} from 1988 - 98. Fisheries export earnings reached P 12 billion in the 1990 s. Exports of fishery products include tuna, shrimps, prawns and seaweed. Fishing industry employees in the Philippines are distributed thus: 70 % in the municipal (artisanal) sector, 25 % in aquaculture and 5 % in the commercial <b>sector.</b> <b>Fish</b> and fish products comprise more than 50 % of total animal protein intake vis-Î±-vis meat and meat products and poultry. However per capita consumption of food fish decreased from 40 kgâ•–year- 1 in 1988 to 36 kg in 1998. In the Philippines, small scale fishing is defined as fishing within municipal waters using fishing vessels of 3 GT or less, or fishing without vessels. In 1948, there were 63 005 fishers rising to 743 544 in 1995. There was a declining trend in catch per unit effort (CPUE) from 2. 10 tâ•–HP- 1 in 1948 to 0. 29 tâ•–HP- 1 in 1985. Time-series data from 1976 - 87 showed that small pelagics accounted for 38 % of total catch followed by demersals, 26 %; tuna, 16 %; seaweeds, 14 %; large pelagics, 6 % and invertebrates, 9 %. The most important fishing gear in terms of contribution to total catch are gillnets (30 %), hook and line (24 %) and beach seine (8 %). Hook and line accounts for almost 60 % of tuna catch while hook and line, gillnets, and fish corrals account for 60 % of demersal catch. Commercial fishing can be classified into: (a) small scale commercial fishing (fishing with passive or active gear and utilizing vessels of 3. 1 GT up to 20 GT); (b) medium-scale commercial fishing (fishing with active gear and utilizing vessels of 20. 1 GT up to 150 GT); and (c) large scale commercial fishing (fishing with active gear and vessels of more than 150 GT). In the 1950 s the three dominant types of gear were bag net, the trawl (including beam and otter types) and the round haul seine. The larger tonnage category (more than 100 GT) became more significant in the 1980 s. There are 35 species comprising 70 - 95 % of total commercial fish production grouped as demersals, small pelagics and large pelagics. Roundscads dominated the small pelagics, followed by slipmouth, a demersal species. Declining catches, disappearance of high value species and increasing volume of juveniles are indications that the fishery is biologically over-fished. This translates as declining profit for the fishery sector. It also means that the fishery employs excess labor and utilizes capital {{that could be used in}} other economic sectors.
