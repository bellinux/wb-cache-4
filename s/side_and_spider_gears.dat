5000|$|A {{variation}} on the Savage X, the Savage X SS, has a [...]28ci (4.6cc) engine that has 10% more displacement than the S-25 Model. The Savage X SS also features a hardened steel spur gear, chromed dog bones <b>and</b> 6 <b>gear</b> <b>spider</b> diffs for enhanced drivetrain durability {{to cope with the}} extra power of the [...]28 engine. With this engine the SS version will easily pull wheel stands and an optional wheelie bar is available for the Savage to prevent it from flipping over backwards under hard acceleration.|$|R
50|$|A {{center axle}} {{disconnect}} system or CAD {{is an alternative}} to locking hubs. CAD systems are typically used in front drive axles on four wheel drive vehicles. A CAD system works by having an axle shaft (typically the longer shaft) split into two pieces. One piece {{is connected to the}} carrier, the other connected to the wheel. This reduces drag on the axle by allowing only the <b>spider</b> <b>and</b> <b>side</b> <b>gears</b> to spin, while the differential carrier, pinion and drive shaft are at rest. The axle is engaged by connecting the two split axle shafts. The ends of the axles are typically splined and use a collar to connect the two shafts together by sliding over both shafts.|$|R
5000|$|The two crown wheels {{interface}} to the <b>spider</b> <b>gears</b> {{at different}} diameters, and so produce different torque when turned by the <b>spider</b> <b>gears.</b> This is engineered {{to produce a}} 40:60 static torque split front and rear.|$|R
50|$|The {{clutch type}} has {{a stack of}} thin clutch-discs, half of which are coupled {{to one of the}} drive shafts, the other half of which are coupled to the <b>spider</b> <b>gear</b> carrier. The clutch stacks may be present on both drive shafts, or on only one. If on only one, the {{remaining}} drive shaft is linked to the clutched drive shaft through the <b>spider</b> <b>gears.</b> In a cone type the clutches are replaced by a pair of cones which are pressed together achieving the same effect.|$|R
50|$|Although {{a widely}} used system, {{this system is}} not as {{efficient}} as a system with locking hubs. A CAD system spins the axle shafts, <b>spider</b> <b>gears,</b> <b>and</b> <b>side</b> gears in the carrier during normal driving. Locking hubs disengage the axle at the wheels, allowing all of the axle to be at rest during normal driving. Not as efficient as locking hubs, a CAD system still makes for much less drag than having the axle completely locked in.|$|R
50|$|The {{internal}} <b>spider</b> <b>gears</b> {{of an open}} differential {{can also}} be welded {{together to create a}} locked axle; this method is not recommended as the welding process seriously compromises the metallurgical composition of the welded components, and can lead to failure of the unit under stress. If it is desirable to have a spooled axle, the better option is to install either a mini-spool or a full spool.|$|R
5000|$|Geared, torque-sensitive {{mechanical}} limited-slip differentials use {{worm gears}} and spur gears to distribute and differentiate input power between two drive wheels or {{front and back}} axles. This is a completely separate design from the most common beveled <b>spider</b> <b>gear</b> designs seen in most automotive applications. As torque {{is applied to the}} gears, they are pushed against the walls of the differential housing, creating friction. The friction resists the relative movement of the outputs and creates the limiting torque Trq d [...]|$|R
5000|$|Unlike other friction-based LSD {{designs that}} combine a common <b>spider</b> <b>gear</b> [...] "open" [...] {{differential}} {{in combination with}} friction materials that inhibit differentiation, the torque sensing design is a unique type of differential, with torque bias inherent to its design, not as an add-on. Torque bias is only applied when needed, and does not inhibit differentiation. The result is a true differential that does not bind up like LSD and locking types, but still gives increased power delivery under many road conditions.|$|R
5000|$|One {{method for}} {{creating}} the clamping force {{is the use of}} a cam-ramp assembly such as used in a Salisbury/ramp style LSD. The <b>spider</b> <b>gears</b> mount on the pinion cross shaft which rests in angled cutouts forming cammed ramps. The cammed ramps are not necessarily symmetrical. If the ramps are symmetrical, the LSD is 2 way. If they are saw toothed (i.e. one side of the ramp is vertical), the LSD is 1 way. If both sides are sloped, but are asymmetric, the LSD is 1.5 way. (See the discussion of 2, 1.5 and 1 way below) ...|$|R
40|$|Fear-relevant stimuli, such as snakes, <b>spiders</b> <b>and</b> heights, {{preferentially}} capture {{attention as}} compared to nonfear-relevant stimuli. This is said to reflect an encapsulated mechanism whereby attention is captured by the simple perceptual features of stimuli that have evolutionary significance. Research, using pictures of snakes <b>and</b> <b>spiders,</b> has found some support for this account; however, participants may have had prior fear of snakes <b>and</b> <b>spiders</b> that influenced results. The current research compared responses of snake <b>and</b> <b>spider</b> experts who had little fear of snakes <b>and</b> <b>spiders,</b> <b>and</b> control participants across a series of affective priming and visual search tasks. Experts discriminated between dangerous and nondangerous snakes <b>and</b> <b>spiders,</b> <b>and</b> expert responses to pictures of nondangerous snakes <b>and</b> <b>spiders</b> differed from those of control participants. The current results dispute that stimulus fear relevance is based purely on perceptual features, and provides support {{for the role of}} learning and experience...|$|R
40|$|Theories of nonassociative fear {{acquisition}} {{hold that}} humans have an innate predisposition for some fears, such as fear of snakes <b>and</b> <b>spiders.</b> This predisposition may be mediated by an evolved fear module (Ohman & Mineka, 2001) that responds to basic perceptual features of threat stimuli by directing attention preferentially and generating an automatic fear response. Visual search and affective priming tasks {{were used to}} examine attentional processing and implicit evaluation of snake <b>and</b> <b>spider</b> pictures in participants with different explicit attitudes; controls (n = 25) <b>and</b> snake <b>and</b> <b>spider</b> experts (n = 23). Attentional processing and explicit evaluation were found to diverge; snakes <b>and</b> <b>spiders</b> were preferentially attended to by all participants;, however, they were negative only for controls. Implicit evaluations of dangerous and nondangerous snakes <b>and</b> <b>spiders,</b> which have similar perceptual features, differed for expert participants, but not for controls. The authors suggest that although snakes <b>and</b> <b>spiders</b> are preferentially attended to, negative evaluations are not automatically elicited during this processing...|$|R
