The cavalry next attempted the passage, but with even less success, for the hoofs of the horses broke through the hard upper crust of the old snow and the animals sank in to their bellies. Seeing {{that it was impossible to}} pass this obstacle, Hannibal turned back the head of the column until they reached the top of the ascent down which they had just come. There he cleared away the snow and erected a camp; all the infantry were then brought down into the pass and set to work to build up a road along the side of the ravine.|$|E
60|$|The {{outer edge}} of the reef on the western or leeward side of the island is tolerably well defined, and is a little higher than any other part. It chiefly {{consists}} of large strongly branched corals, of the genus Madrepora, which also form a <b>sloping</b> <b>bed</b> some way out to sea: the kinds of coral growing in this part will be described in the ensuing chapter. Between the outer margin and the beach, there is a flat space with a sandy bottom and a few tufts of living coral; in some parts it is so shallow, that people, by avoiding the deeper holes and gullies, can wade across it at low water; in other parts it is deeper, seldom however exceeding ten or twelve feet, so that it offers a safe coasting channel for boats. On the eastern and windward side of the island, which is exposed to a heavy surf, the reef was described to me as having a hard smooth surface, very slightly inclined inwards, just covered at low-water, and traversed by gullies; it appears to be quite similar in structure to the reefs of the barrier and atoll classes.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The form of {{the free}} surface in {{two-dimensional}} groundwater flow over a plane impermeable bed, induced by percolating rainfall or irrigation, {{has been the subject}} of considerable study since the 1960 's. The earlier analyses were related to drainage design, but more recently, and particularly for the case of a <b>sloping</b> <b>bed,</b> the motivation has been the development of models of hillslope hydrology, and there has been particular interest in linearisation of the Boussinesq equation. This paper first develops a quasi-analytical solution for the maximum water-table height in the case of a horizontal bed, and compares this with the Boussinesq and linearised Boussinesq solutions. In the case of a <b>sloping</b> <b>bed,</b> it is shown that the Boussinesq equation can be reduced to a single dimensionless form, dependent on the system of coordinates and the direction of the recharge. Numerical solutions are given for the steady flow case, indicating the conditions under which the linearised solutions depart markedly from the Boussinesq equation...|$|E

30|$|The {{movement}} of groundwater depends considerably on the stratigraphical and structural {{units of the}} region. In hillslope terrains, the flow of groundwater inherits certain unique features that are seldom seen in horizontal strata. Most importantly, aquifers in hillslope regions are underlain by sloping impervious beds. In such cases, approximation of groundwater flow {{based on the assumption}} that the streamlines are nearly parallel to the <b>sloping</b> <b>bed</b> (Dupuit–Forchheimer assumption) yields more accurate results. Childs (1971) formulated the unsteady groundwater flow in skewed coordinate system (along and perpendicular to the sloping base) by a nonlinear Boussinesq equation. Chapman (1980) converted this approximation in rectangular coordinate system. Analytic solutions of linearized Boussinesq equation under varying hydrologic conditions are presented by a number of investigators (Brutsaert 1994; Verhoest and Troach 2000; Upadhyaya and Chauhan 2001; Bansal and Das 2009, 2011; Bansal 2012). Using finite Fourier transform, effects of localized recharge from single basin on the evolution of groundwater mound in downward sloping aquifers of rectangular shape were analyzed by Ram and Chauhan (1987), Singh et al. (1991) and Ramana et al. (1995). By considering varying hydraulic conductivities along x- and y-axes, Chang and Yeh (2007) analyzed two-dimensional transient groundwater flow in a sloping aquifer due to time-varying recharge from single recharge basin and extraction from multi-wells. Closed form analytic expressions for spatio-temporal variations in water head over semi-infinite <b>sloping</b> <b>bed</b> due to localized recharge is presented by Bansal and Das (2010) and Bansal (2013). The aforementioned studies highlight the importance of bed slope in the determination of transient profiles of phreatic surface; however, the results are either exceedingly complicated or suffer from slow convergence.|$|E

Based on a staggered computational mesh, an explicit numerical algorithm is employed with a predictor-corrector procedure of pressure and velocity field computation. To track the free surface movement with wave breaking, the volume of fluid (VOF) method is implemented. Coupling the VOF and the embedding method, the treatment on free surface problem and complex bottom topography can be easily accomplished. Comparing with the existing experiments, a good agreement is found between numerical results and measured data. 1...|$|E

Turbidity currents derive this driving force from the sediment in suspension.

40|$|Abstract: The {{potential}} {{relevance of}} wave skewness and <b>sloping</b> <b>beds</b> on morphodynamic predictions is investigated. Based on a comparison with measurements {{it was shown}} that the phase lag is potentially important for modeling nearshore bar dynamics as it influences the suspended wave related transports (magnitude and direction). Velocity skewness results in a phase shift between the orbital motion and the instantaneous bed shear stress increasing onshore bed load transport. It was seen that its influence is relatively small but does affect bar migration and helps to predict the observed asymmetric bar shape. The <b>bed</b> <b>slope</b> affecting the initiation of motion and sediment bed-load transport magnitude and direction are investigated by comparing scour hole predictions. The initiation of motion, which is also included on the suspended transports, only has an effect for somewhat steeper slopes.

The use of a radiation condition at the shoreline that removes reflected waves there both simulates energy dissipation in the shoaling region and allows comparisons to be made with the case of constant water depth. The model applies equally to floating sea ice and ‘very large floating structures’. A Green’s function approach reduces the underlying boundary value problem to a pair of coupled integral equations to which Galerkin’s method is applied.

40|$|Bed surface {{particle}} size patchiness {{may play a}} central role in bedload and morphologic response to changes in sediment supply in gravel-bed rivers. Here we test a 1 -D model (from Parker ebook) of bedload transport, surface grain size, and channel profile with two previously published flume studies that documented bed surface response, and specifically patch development, to reduced sediment supply. The model over predicts slope changes and under predicts average bed surface grain size changes because it does not account for patch dynamics. Field studies reported here using painted rocks as tracers show that fine patches and coarse patches may initiate transport at the same stage, but that much greater transport occurs in the finer patches. A theory for patch development should include grain interactions (similar size grains stop-ping each other, fine ones mobilizing coarse particles), effects of boundary shear stress divergence, and sort-ing due to cross-stream <b>sloping</b> <b>bed</b> surfaces...|$|E
