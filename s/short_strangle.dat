5000|$|A <b>short</b> <b>strangle</b> is {{effectively}} a long iron condor, {{but without the}} wings. It is constructed by writing an out-of-the-money put and an out-of-the money call. A <b>short</b> <b>strangle</b> with the same short strikes as an iron condor is generally more profitable, but unlike a long iron condor, the <b>short</b> <b>strangle</b> offers no protection to limit losses should the underlying instrument's spot price change dramatically.|$|E
50|$|Returning to {{the long}} box-spread, {{we see that the}} leading {{diagonal}} is a long gut combination, and the other diagonal is a <b>short</b> <b>strangle</b> combination. Hence a long box-spread may be created as a coupling of a long gut with a <b>short</b> <b>strangle.</b>|$|E
50|$|Neutral trading {{strategies}} that are bearish on volatility profit when the underlying stock price experiences little or no movement. Such strategies include the short straddle, <b>short</b> <b>strangle,</b> ratio spreads, long condor, long butterfly, and long Calendar or Double Calendar.|$|E

50|$|From 1769 it {{was used}} as a workhouse and in 1794 started to keep French prisoners of war. In 1803, it became a provincial prison for inmates who had {{sentences}} of up to 10 years of imprisonment. In 1847 to 1848 and from 1869 to 1872, it was greatly enlarged. Toward the end of World War II the prison was bombed twice, which killed 14 guards and 107 prisoners. In 1946, the British executioner Albert Pierrepoint travelled to Karlau to train an Austrian executioner and two assistants in the British method of long drop executions. Until then, condemned prisoners were hanged with <b>short</b> drops, effectively <b>strangling</b> them to death. Under the British method, Pierrepoint, the Austrian executioner and the two assistants hanged eight young men on September 24, 1946. A method which was continued until Austria abolished capital punishment on June 30, 1950.The prison was renamed Graz-Karlau on November 1, 1993.|$|R
5000|$|A short {{straddle}} {{is effectively}} a long iron butterfly without {{the wings and}} is constructed simply by writing an at-the-money call and an at-the-money put. Similar to a <b>short</b> <b>strangle,</b> the short straddle offers no protection to limit losses and similar to a long iron butterfly, the straddle requires the underlying instrument's spot price to remain virtually unchanged {{over the life of}} the contract in order to retain the full net credit.|$|E
50|$|The <b>short</b> <b>strangle</b> {{strategy}} {{requires the}} investor to simultaneously sell both {{a call and}} a put option on the same underlying security. The strike price for the call and put contracts must be, respectively, {{above and below the}} current price of the underlying. The assumption of the investor (the person selling the option) is that, {{for the duration of the}} contract, the price of the underlying will remain below the call and above the put strike price. If the investor's assumption is correct the party purchasing the option has no advantage in exercising the contracts so they expire worthless. This expiration condition frees the investor from any contractual obligations and the money (the premium) he or she received at the time of the sale becomes profit. Importantly, if the investors assumptions are incorrect the strangle strategy leads to modest or unlimited loss.|$|E
50|$|In finance, a {{strangle}} is {{an investment}} strategy involving the purchase or sale of particular option derivatives that allows the holder to profit based on how much {{the price of the}} underlying security moves, with relatively minimal exposure to the direction of price movement. A purchase of particular options is known as a long strangle, while a sale of the same options is known as a <b>short</b> <b>strangle.</b> As an options position strangle is a variation of a more generic straddle position. Strangle's key difference from a straddle is in giving investor choice of balancing cost of opening a strangle versus a probability of profit. For example, given the same underlying security, strangle positions can be constructed with low cost and low probability of profit. Low cost is relative and comparable to a cost of straddle on the same underlying.Strangles can be used with equity options, index options or options on futures.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} method for {{effectively}} implementing the pyramid strategy. The pyramid strategy {{is based on the}} <b>short</b> <b>strangle</b> strategy and adopts the multiple-entry approach. Risk management is an essential element of derivatives trading, and the pyramid strategy is very efficient because it combines mutual and dynamic hedging. However, in operating the pyramid strategy, choosing a specific exercise price results in significant differences in terms of profitability and stability. This paper analyzes theta—measurement of decreasing time-value of an option—to propose {{a method for}} achieving profitability and stability simultaneously. The proposed approach involves adding stability by selecting deep out-of-the-money (OTM) options in early monthly contracts, and moving to near OTM options with high theta values in late monthly contracts to pursue profitability. To verify the validity of the proposed method, automatic strangle trades was simulated based on real data of Korean option information system. The simulation was performed using the multi-chart automatic trading analysis tool. The results of simulation using April 2012 contracts confirmed that the proposed method produces higher returns and offers greater stability than conventional methods...|$|E
