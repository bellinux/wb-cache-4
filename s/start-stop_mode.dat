50|$|Also in September 1975 IBM {{announced}} the IBM 5100 Communications Adapter, {{that allowed the}} 5100 to transmit data to and receive data from a remote system. It made the 5100 appear the same as an IBM 2741 Communications Terminal and {{was designed to be}} able to communicate with IBM 2741 compatible machines in <b>start-stop</b> <b>mode</b> using the EBCD (Extended Binary Coded Decimal) notation. EBCD was similar to the more common IBM EBCDIC code, but not identical.|$|E
5000|$|Another problem {{faced by}} early [...] "packeteers" [...] {{was the issue}} of {{asynchronous}} versus synchronous data transfer. At the time, most personal computers had asynchronous RS-232 serial ports for data communications between the computer and devices such as modems. The RS-232 standard specifies an asynchronous, <b>start-stop</b> <b>mode</b> of data transmission where data is sent in groups (characters) of 7 or 8 bits. Unfortunately, the simple AFSK modems typically used to provide no timing signal to indicate {{the start of a}} packet frame. That led to the need for a mechanism to enable the receiver to know when to start assembling each packet frame. The method used is called asynchronous framing. The receiver looks for the [...] "frame boundary octet," [...] then begins decoding the packet data that follows it. Another frame boundary octet marks the end of the packet frame.|$|E
40|$|Web guiding used in roll-to-roll {{material}} processing machinery {{is connected with}} a number of issues including the maintenance of the web tension, the precision of the lateral web displacement, the accuracy of transport positioning of the web, and the selection of web transport velocity. The article presents the precision of the lateral web displacement issue during the start-stop work mode of the web transport. A model of a system for automatic web guiding is shown. The requirements of the lateral web guiding for transporting material over rollers in a processing machine working in a <b>start-stop</b> <b>mode</b> are presented. The control system is discussed, particularly its hardware structure and behaviour. The obtained functionality of the control system enables its application in roll-to-roll {{material processing}} machines, working either in the <b>start-stop</b> <b>mode</b> or continuously...|$|E
40|$|Abstract – The {{fusion of}} {{information}} gathered from multiple sources {{is essential to}} build a comprehensive situation picture for ground surveillance. In this paper, an approach which performs data correlation and fusion for ground moving target indicator (GMTI) radar data and SALUTE reports is described. GMTI data are simulated based on the ground truth of a military exercise and processed by a GMTI group tracker employing a Cardinalized Probability Hypothesis Den-sity (CPHD) Filter. Multi source fusion is performed by combining the GMTI tracker and report tracker using our data fusion architecture. The scenario used in the experiment is tracking of closely spaced ground targets by GMTI, supplemented with some collected SALUTE reports. The challenges include tracking ground targets moving across foliage and tactical movement (<b>start-stop</b> <b>mode).</b> Using the designed test scenarios, this paper looks into different aspects of benefits by performing cross fusion with GMTI data and SALUTE reports...|$|E
40|$|Oil {{injected}} {{screw compressors}} used for air applications and refrigeration are usually installed in simple packages which {{often do not}} include oil pump for supply of oil to the bearings and the working chamber. The period of an unlubricated operation depends {{on the size of}} the oil system and the length of the discharge piping. When the back pressure reaches the chamber pressure, a normal mode of lubrication will start. Due to the lack of lubrication, rotors will be in direct contact with insufficient or no oil film between them, while the pressure in the compression chamber will increase causing the temperature to rise. The leakage flow will be higher than normal which will increase the overall temperature in the compression chamber. It is expected that some surface damage may occur on the rotors. In a case of a frequent <b>start-stop</b> <b>mode,</b> such operation may cause quick wear and rapid decrease in thecompressor performance. This paper is expected to address such issues and to define a scope of work required to understand the oil flooded compressor process in a transient operation mode. This will allow prediction of wear in such compressors and will give some insight to the required modifications to prevent these issues and increase the compressor reliability...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Arrival time of {{particles}} in an extensive air shower (EAS) {{is a key}} physical parameter to determine its direction. EAS direction is useful for studies of anisotropy and composition of cosmic rays, and search for multi-TeV γ-rays sources. Accurate timing {{may be used to}} search exotic phenomena such as production of new particles at extremely high energies available during early stages of development of EAS and also for detecting sub-relativistic hadrons in EAS. Time to digital converters (TDCs) are used to perform this task. Traditional TDCs operate in the <b>START-STOP</b> <b>mode</b> with limited dynamic range and single-hit capability. With the advent of high luminosity collider LHC, need for TDCs with large dynamic range, multi-hit capability and TRIGGERED mode of operation became necessary. A 32 channel TDC was designed for the GRAPES- 3 experiment on a CAMAC platform around TDC 32, an ASIC developed by micro-electronics group at CERN, Geneva. Four modules were operated in the GRAPES- 3 experiment. Here, we present details of the circuit design and their performance over several years. The multi-hit feature of this device was used to study the time structure {{of particles}} in the EAS on time scale of ∼ 1 μs. The distribution of time intervals in th...|$|E
