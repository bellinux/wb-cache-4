The results indicate that low punch speed, short reheating duration or low reheating temperature often produces the defect of cold shuts or <b>shrinkage</b> <b>porosities.</b> On the contrary, gas pores can easily form. In addition, the reheating duration or temperature also has obvious effects on the primary particle size, fraction and morphology.

40|$|Abstract. The {{distribution}} of <b>shrinkage</b> <b>porosities</b> in sand cast Mg-Y-RE (WE 54) alloy castings was characterized through density measurement and calculated by Archimedes’s principle. The effect of porosity on mechanical properties of sand cast WE 54 alloy was investigated through tensile tests and microstructure observation. It {{was found that}} the <b>shrinkage</b> <b>porosities</b> distributed mainly {{in the middle of the}} plate where the liquid feeding was quite inconvenient. And the porosities were formed along grain boundaries when secondary phases formed at the end of solidification. Hardness tests showed that the vikers hardness declined linearly with increasing porosity volume fraction. While the tensile strength and nominal yield strength declined exponentially as the porosity volume fraction increased. Microstructure observation showed that the fracture cracks propagated along the grain boundaries where porosities and secondary phases gathering together in as-cast WE 54 alloy. The tiny porosities distributed in the secondary phases were observed, which could reduce the tensile strength of cast specimens significantly. The heat treatment strengthening effects were significantly weakened by porosities, and even no heat treatment strengthening effect was detected when the porosity volume fraction was higher than 1 %. The microstructure observation also proved that no heat treatment strengthening effect existed in samples containing porosities...|$|R

Shrinkage and variations in porosity are the common micro and microstructural changes that take place during the drying of mostly the food materials. Although extensive research has been carried out on the prediction of <b>shrinkage</b> and <b>porosity</b> over the time of drying, no single model exists which consider both material properties and process condition in the same model. In this study, an attempt has been made to develop and validate <b>shrinkage</b> and <b>porosity</b> models of food materials during drying considering both process parameters and sample properties. The stored energy within the sample, elastic potential energy, glass transition temperature and physical properties of the sample such as initial porosity, particle density, bulk density and moisture content have been taken into consideration.

40|$|The {{presence}} of defects is of major {{concern in the}} production of grey iron castings. Some defects are merely an aesthetic problem while others can be detrimental for the performance of the component. Among the several possible defects, <b>shrinkage</b> <b>porosity</b> {{is one of the more}} challenging to understand and avoid. This type of defect can penetrate through the casting as a three-dimensional network. The purpose of this work has been to develop knowledge and understanding about the foundry process in order to increase product quality by eliminating or at least minimising the {{presence of}} <b>shrinkage</b> <b>porosity</b> {{in the production of}} vital engine components. This was done by developing fundamental knowledge concerning factors known to influence the presence of <b>shrinkage</b> <b>porosity.</b> Initially, an investigation was carried out in order to characterize <b>shrinkage</b> <b>porosity</b> commonly occurring in cylinder heads. Factors found to be important and contributing to the formation of <b>shrinkage</b> <b>porosity</b> were identified. It was found that this type of defect is formed at hot spots that have migrated during solidification. Knowledge of the migrating hot spot was used as a design criterion in the development of a geometry with the purpose of deliberately generating porosity. Based on this geometry a mechanism for the formation of this type of <b>shrinkage</b> <b>porosity</b> was proposed. The formation of <b>shrinkage</b> <b>porosity</b> depends on gases dissolved in the melt. In this work, their levels and variations in the melting process were investigated. It was shown how the solubility of oxygen depends on the temperature but not on the method used to produce the iron. On the other hand, the total amount of oxygen depends on the process but not on temperature. The discussion about gases also included hydrogen and nitrogen. The solidification of grey cast iron is complex. It is during the solidification that not only the final properties of the component but also the conditions for defect formation are established. <b>Shrinkage</b> <b>porosity</b> is formed due to volumetric changes followed by an inability to supply material to the contracting areas. The solidification of grey iron starts with nucleation and growth of the primary austenite followed by nucleation of eutectic cells. It was found that the microstructural constituents are interconnected. The importance of the macrostructure was also discussed and it was shown that <b>shrinkage</b> <b>porosity</b> can be found not only between eutectic cells but also between equiaxed crystals...|$|E

Different from the periodic symmetry defects or certain distribution defects, <b>shrinkage</b> <b>porosity</b> presents a random “cloud-like” configuration, which brings difficulties in quantifying the effective performance of defected casting. In this paper, the influences of random <b>shrinkage</b> <b>porosity</b> on the equivalent elastic modulus of QT 400 - 18 casting were studied by a numerical statistics approach. An improved random algorithm was applied into the lattice model to simulate the “cloud-like” morphology of <b>shrinkage</b> <b>porosity.</b> Then, a large number of numerical samples containing random levels of shrinkage were generated by the proposed algorithm. The stress concentration factor and equivalent elastic modulus of these numerical samples were calculated. Based on a statistical approach, the effects of shrinkage porosity’s distribution characteristics, such as area fraction, shape, and relative location on the casting’s equivalent mechanical properties were discussed respectively. It is shown that the approach with randomly distributed defects has better predictive capabilities than traditional methods. The following conclusions can be drawn from the statistical simulations: (1) the effective modulus decreases remarkably if the <b>shrinkage</b> <b>porosity</b> percent is greater than 1. 5 %; (2) the average Stress Concentration Factor (SCF) produced by <b>shrinkage</b> <b>porosity</b> is about 2. 0; (3) the defect’s length across the loading direction plays a more important role in the effective modulus than the length along the loading direction; (4) the surface defect perpendicular to loading direction reduces the mean modulus about 1. 5 % more than a defect of other position...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT:- From an {{engineering}} point of view, the fatigue strength variability of cast aluminium alloy components requires a detailed {{understanding of the}} inconsistency of cast defect distribution. Cast aluminium alloys are not generally homogeneous; they may contain two or more types of common casting defects, which are gas and <b>shrinkage</b> <b>porosities,</b> oxide films, and inclusions. Each defect type has its own distribution of sizes; and multiple cast components of presumably the same material may have different histories and therefore different cast defect populations. A number of statistical analyses of fatigue data assume that a single distribution of casting defect is present uniformly throughout the cast aluminium alloys. As a result, fatigue data are statistically not correctly described. By relaxing the assumptions of a single cast defect distribution, of uniformity throughout the material and of uniformity from specimen to specimen, Weibull statistical analysis for multiple defect distributions have been applied to correctly describe the fatigue life data of aluminium alloy castings having multiple cast defects competing to initiate fatigue cracks...|$|R

Results indicate that fin affects severely on solidification time and this influence is more severe in castings produced in moulding materials such as carboceramics which can absorb more moisture.
