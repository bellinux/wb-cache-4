50|$|Bituah Leumi {{runs the}} state old-age pension system, paid {{to those who}} paid {{insurance}} contributions {{for a minimum of}} 12 years. The basic old-age pension is NIS 1,531 a month, which rises to NIS 1,617 a month after the pensioner turns 80. A <b>seniority</b> <b>increment</b> is added based on the amount of years the pensioner paid contributions, up to a maximum of 50% of the basic pension. Additional increments are available to those living with spouses who do not qualify for an old-age pension, dependent children, and those who are not entitled to a pension or only a small pension which they must first waive. Income supplements to ensure a minimal standard of living are available to those with no additional sources of income other than an old-age pension. Health insurance contributions are deducted from pensions, as well as increments and supplements. Salaried employees not covered by collectively-bargained pension plans with unions are legally required to have private pension plans to which employers must contribute to, and most self-employed persons are also legally required to have private pensions.|$|E
50|$|The state-run old age {{pension system}} is {{administered}} by Bituah Leumi (National Insurance Institute). All residents aged 18 or older are {{required by law to}} pay insurance contributions to Bituach Leumi as part of the old age insurance system. One must have paid contributions for at least 12 years to be able to claim a pension. Upon reaching retirement age and claiming the pension, contributors are means-tested, with those above certain income levels entitled to only a partial pension or no pension at all until age 70. The basic old age pension is NIS 1,531 for an individual. In the case of a couple where one of them is not eligible for an old age pension, the pension is NIS 2,301, composed of the pension for an individual with an increment for the spouse. Upon reaching age 80, this increases to NIS 1,617 for an individual and NIS 2,387 for a couple. A <b>seniority</b> <b>increment</b> is added to the basic pension, calculated according to the years of insurance contributions accumulated up to a maximum of 50% of the basic pension. Additional increments are available to pensioners living with dependant spouses and children, {{as well as those who}} are entitled to no pension or only a small pension which the pensioner must waive to receive the increment. Pensioners who have no other sources of income are entitled to income supplements to ensure a minimal standard of living. Health insurance contributions are deducted at rates of NIS 196 for individual pensions and NIS 283 for a couple's pension. Those entitled to income supplements also have NIS 103 deducted from them monthly.|$|E
