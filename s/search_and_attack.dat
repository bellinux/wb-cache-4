25|$|After delivery, Malachite was {{assigned}} to the 13th Squadron based at La Spezia. In 1937 she undertook a training campaign near the Greek coast, in the Dodecanese and around Tobruk. During the Spanish Civil War, the submarine conducted a special mission between 24 August and 4 September 1937, and on August 29 she was subject to a anti-submarine <b>search</b> <b>and</b> <b>attack.</b>|$|E
25|$|The radar suite {{includes}} a Raytheon SPS-49(V)8 ANZ radar for aerial search and long-range surveillance, a Saab 9LV 453 Target Indication Radar for air and surface search, an Atlas Elektronik 9600 ARPA navigational radar, {{and a second}} Saab 9LV 453 unit for fire control. All ships were initially fitted with a ThomsonSintra Spherion B hull-mounted bow sonar, for active <b>search</b> <b>and</b> <b>attack</b> operations. From Warramunga onwards, ships were launched with a Petrel Mine and Obstacle Avoidance Sonar system. this was later retrofitted to Anzac. All ships were fitted for but not with a towed-array sonar, with the RAN and RNZN following separate acquisition programs for these. The frigates were also fitted for but not with SATCOM and a Helo datalink.|$|E
500|$|Both sides' {{aircraft}} {{were operating}} in adverse conditions. Argentine aircraft {{were forced to}} operate from the mainland because airfields on the Falklands were only suited for propellor-driven transports. [...] In addition, fears partly aroused by the bombing of Port Stanley airport by a British Vulcan bomber added to the Argentinians' decision to operate them from afar. As most Argentine aircraft lacked in-flight refuelling capability, {{they were forced to}} operate at the limit of their range. The Sea Harriers also had limited fuel reserves due to the tactical decision to station the British carriers out of Exocet missile range and the dispersal of the fleet. The result was that an Argentine aircraft could only allow five minutes over the islands to <b>search</b> <b>and</b> <b>attack</b> an objective, while a Sea Harrier could stay near to 30 minutes waiting in the Argentine approach corridors and provide Combat Air Patrol coverage for up to an hour.|$|E
5000|$|... 15 June 1945: The rest of VPB-17 {{remained}} in Lingayen Gulf at Port Sual, Philippines, still aboard USS Tangier. Night <b>searches</b> <b>and</b> <b>attack</b> patrols were conducted from this location against enemy positions and ships until 30 June, when {{the remainder of}} the squadron rejoined the detachment at Lingayen. The reunited squadron was relocated aboard USS Currituck.|$|R
25|$|Between 3 March 1941 and May 1941, the {{squadron}} was on loan to RAF Coastal Command and stationed at RAF Leuchars. Its duties while in Coastal Command were various: shipping strikes, convoy duties, coastal patrols, submarine <b>searches</b> <b>and</b> <b>attacks</b> on enemy airfields and harbours. These were quite hazardous as {{the squadron}} lost two COs during these operations, Wing Commander Cameron in April and Wing Commander Birch on 4 May 1941.|$|R

2500|$|Four boats of {{the class}} — Torbay, Trenchant, Talent and Triumph — have been fitted with the Sonar 2076 system, which Thales {{describes}} as having [...] a [...] "reputation as the world’s most advanced, fully integrated, passive/active <b>search</b> <b>and</b> <b>attack</b> sonar suite". Beginning in 2014, the last four boats {{of the class}} underwent a communications package upgrade.|$|E
2500|$|Trigger met {{submarine}} [...] on 14 April {{and exchanged}} information by line gun. The next day, Trigger’s executive officer went on board Tang by a rubber boat, to borrow an air compressor part {{and to make}} plans for a coordinated <b>search</b> <b>and</b> <b>attack.</b> On 18 April, Tang’s executive officer delivered spare parts for the air compressor to Trigger, and she continued on patrol.|$|E
2500|$|In October 1942, Feightner was {{assigned}} to VF-10, the Grim Reapers, aboard [...] flying the Grumman F4F Wildcat. The commanding officer of VF-10 was James H. Flatley whom Feightner described as [...] "a true leader [...] epitomizes {{what you think of}} as a squadron commander." [...] Enterprise left Pearl Harbor on October 16, 1942 for the South Pacific as part of Task Force King. Less than ten days later, Feightner performed his first night carrier landing after the <b>search</b> <b>and</b> <b>attack</b> group for which he provided cover became lost and did not return to the carrier until after dark. On October 26, 1942, during the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands, Feightner shot down his first enemy aircraftan Aichi D3A dive bomber that was attacking Enterprise. He was also credited with a probable kill of another aircraft. Feightner was awarded an Air Medal and gold award star for his actions that day.|$|E
50|$|After {{the attacks}} on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon on 11 September 2001, the {{battalion}} once again saw active overseas service. From January to August 2002 the Iron Rakkasans deployed to Afghanistan as part of Operation Enduring Freedom, where it participated in numerous <b>search</b> <b>and</b> <b>attacks,</b> raids, <b>and</b> air assaults against the elusive remnants of the Taliban near the Pakistan border, helping to stabilize the country. For its actions, the battalion earned the Afghanistan campaign streamer.|$|R
