5|$|Back in the present, Chandler apologizes to Monica. Rachel reveals that's not {{the story}} <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>referring</b> <b>to.</b> The flashbacks {{continue}} to 1988; Ross and Chandler arrive for dinner {{to find that}} Monica has slimmed down, and Chandler now finds her attractive. Monica tells Rachel {{that she wants to}} humiliate Chandler for calling her fat, so Rachel suggests tricking him into taking off his clothes. Monica tries to seduce Chandler by rubbing various objects, including a knife, against her skin. She drops the knife and severs his toe. He is rushed to hospital to have it reattached but, in the commotion, Monica mixes up the digit with a carrot. In the present, Chandler becomes upset after learning that he had lost his toe because he called Monica fat, and angrily leaves. When Monica comes by his apartment seeking his forgiveness by putting a turkey on her head, he inadvertently tells her he loves {{her for the first time}} in their relationship. A tag scene shows another of Phoebe's past life memories as she serves in a World War I field hospital and again lost an arm.|$|E
500|$|The {{mass media}} has often speculated about a romantic {{relationship}} between Vidya and her co-actors, but she has strongly denied these reports. In 2009, Vidya {{was involved in a}} controversy when she mentioned a previous relationship in which [...] "caustic remarks" [...] were made at her due to her weight. She said, [...] "If someone who matters to you takes you down, it can break you. That someone whose approval mattered to me started to constantly find faults with me. At that point of time, it was important to walk away from that relationship." [...] Though she refused to name the person, tabloid reports suggested that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>referring</b> <b>to</b> Shahid Kapoor (her co-star in Kismat Konnection). Kapoor, however, denied the allegations. During an interview in May 2012, Vidya announced that she was dating Siddharth Roy Kapur, the CEO of UTV Motion Pictures. On 14 December 2012, the couple were married in a private ceremony in Bandra, Mumbai.|$|E

I just wanted it to be played on the radio and they’ve already had to edit it so much." ...|$|E

2500|$|Before Hamilton {{had settled}} on a name, the guitarist Peter Mengede's then-girlfriend Reyne Cuccuro [...] {{suggested}} the Germanic name [...] "Helmuth". Hamilton misinterpreted her and mistakenly believed that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>referring</b> <b>to</b> the form of protective gear. Hamilton then thought excitingly that Helmet had [...] "sounded like a pretty cool name for a band" [...] and opted for the Anglicized spelling.

2500|$|Another {{recurring}} {{subject in}} Bradstreet's work is mortality. In {{many of her}} works, she writes about her death {{and how it will}} affect her children and others in her life. The recurrence of this mortality theme can be viewed as autobiographical. Because her work was not intended for the public, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>referring</b> <b>to</b> her own medical problems and her belief that she would die. In addition to her medical history (smallpox and partial paralysis), Bradstreet and her family dealt with a major house fire that left them homeless and devoid of all personal belongings. She hoped her children would think of her fondly and honor her memory in her poem, [...] "Before the Birth of One of Her Children." ...|$|E

2500|$|Hester Thrale Piozzi, in her British Synonymy Book 2, did not {{joke about}} Johnson's {{possible}} madness, and claimed, {{in a discussion}} on Smart's mental state, that Johnson was her [...] "friend who feared an apple should intoxicate him". She made it clear who <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>referring</b> <b>to</b> when she wrote in Thraliana that [...] "I don't believe the King has ever been much worse than poor Dr Johnson was, when he fancied that eating an Apple would make him drunk." [...] To Hester Thrale, what separated Johnson from others who were placed in asylums for madness—like Christopher Smart—was his ability to keep his concerns and emotions to himself. However, Johnson was receiving a treatment of sorts, {{and it is possible}} that it involved a set of fetters and padlock. John Wiltshire later determined that these instruments were not symbolic, but actually used in private treatment.|$|E

2500|$|Mandisa Hundley {{was voted}} out after country week, whereby her {{rendition}} of [...] "Any Man of Mine" [...] {{was not well}} received as a good song choice.
