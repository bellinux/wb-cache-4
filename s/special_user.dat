40|$|Companies need to {{consistently}} gather external information {{in order to}} stay competitive. <b>Special</b> <b>users</b> and customers often are important sources of information and frequently play key roles during different phases of the innovation and marketing process. As these <b>special</b> <b>users</b> are typically hidden within a considerably larger population, traditional screening searches for their identification are often inefficient. Pyramiding has been advocated as a comparatively more efficient search strategy when target persons are very rare. However, little empirical work has been done on investigating this acclaimed superiority of pyramiding relative to screening. This study contributes to the literature on pyramiding search by empirically investigating its performance in varying settings. Firstly, we study how pyramiding efficiency is influenced by the visibility of the special quality being sought. Secondly, we examine the impact {{of the size of the}} population being searched on the efficiency of pyramiding. We analyze data collected from some 940 pupils in 42 school classes. First, in line with previous results, we find pyramiding search to be significantly more efficient in identifying rare individuals with special qualities. Second, we analyzed the efficiency of pyramiding search for (1) search attributes of varying levels of visibility and in (2) networks of different sizes and find both variables to significantly affect the performance of pyramiding search. We find that the level of visibility of the focal search criterion is positively associated with the efficiency of pyramiding. Further, the relativ...|$|R

5000|$|On Unix-like systems, the {{superuser}} (commonly {{known as}} 'root') owns all the privileges. Ordinary users are granted only enough permissions to accomplish their most common tasks. UNIX systems have built-in security features. Most users cannot {{set up a}} new user account nor do other administrative procedures. The user “root” is a <b>special</b> <b>user,</b> something called super-user, which can do anything at all on the system. This high degree power is necessary to fully administer a UNIX system, but it also allows its user to make a mistake and cause system problems.|$|E

50|$|In computing, the {{superuser}} is a <b>special</b> <b>user</b> account {{used for}} system administration. Depending {{on the operating}} system (OS), the actual name of this account might be root, administrator, admin or supervisor. In some cases, the actual name of the account is not the determining factor; on Unix-like systems, for example, the user with a user identifier (UID) of zero is the superuser, regardless {{of the name of}} that account; and in systems which implement a role based security model, any user with the role of superuser (or its synonyms) can carry out all actions of the superuser account.The principle of least privilege recommends that most users and applications run under an ordinary account to perform their work, as a superuser account is capable of making unrestricted, potentially adverse, system-wide changes.|$|E

5000|$|Prison {{libraries}} {{have existed}} in Germany since the 19th century and were {{run by the}} clergy.

[...] However, it wasn’t until professional librarians began operating inside prison libraries that they began to really develop. [...] Unfortunately, not all German prison libraries employ a professional librarian. [...] The purpose of the prison library is to provide recreation, support education, and help with the personal development of inmates. [...] Every inmate {{has the right to}} access a library and most prisons have a library. [...] However, the law makes no specifics about the organization or contents of the library.

50|$|Trainz Railway Simulator 2006 (known as Trainz Railroad Simulator 2006 in the USA), or TRS2006, was an {{transitional}} release, {{incorporating the}} stable Auran JET based TRS2004 GUI modules with only some graphics improvements, but introducing the data base manager Content Manager Plus (CMP) {{as a new}} core technology. ContentManager.exe (now called just CM) combines data base management, and secure FTP upload and download facilities and <b>special</b> <b>user</b> definable filters all in one integrated system. By defining a good filter, the user could 'selectively not see' the clutter of regional items in the Surveyor asset selection menus saving user time when world building. This important filtering feature was further improved in Trainz 2009, becoming far more powerful and easier to use. In addition to these improvements, several new routes were included, such as Hawes Junction (representing a small section of the Settle and Carlisle Railway and serving as a demo for TC3), Toronto Rail Lands 1954 (representing Toronto's sprawling railyard in 1954), and Marias Pass Approach (representing the BNSF Marias Pass line between Shelby, Montana and Cut Bank, Montana and serving as a demo for the full Marias Pass payware route). TRS2006 was published in September 2005, and the base release with its single service pack formed {{the core of the}} regional releases (most are joint ventures with 'Trainz Partners' combining payware content provider's products with the base Trainz software) {{over the next four years}} until the introduction of new technologies in TC3 and TRS2009.
