The coordination productivity indicator is decomposed into a coordination technical inefficiency change component and a coordination technical change component. This decomposition allows assessment of reallocation impacts on the different sources of productivity growth. The empirical application focuses on a large panel of English and Welsh farms over the period 2007 – 2013. The results show that coordination inefficiency significantly increases with the proportion of resources allocated to livestock production in economic and <b>statistical</b> terms. <b>Coordination</b> inefficient farms should generally allocate more land to crop production.

The estimation of such distributions requires the utilization of complex numerical programs. In this paper a simplified method which takes into account a typical configuration in a power system “overhead line – cable line – transformer ” is introduced. The results, although in a general form, highlight that the {{knowledge of}} an overvoltage reduction factor, estimated once for all for different cables and power system configurations, {{can be used to}} evaluate in an easy way the distribution of the overvoltages stressing the insulation of a cable line starting from the statistical distribution of the overvoltages impinging the cable line.

Historically Vattenfall concluded that it is too expensive to use shield wires for the 132 kV grid due to the high soil resistivity in Sweden. Today the situation is different with sensitive industrial loads and the current Vattenfall standard is to build portal tower with one shield wire. The shield wire is however not used {{to reduce the amount of}} lightning faults, it is used to ground the cross arm and reduce the amount of short circuits. In this project the lightning performance of different tower configurations used in the 132 kV grid is investigated using <b>statistical</b> insulation <b>coordination</b> in the softwares LPE and PSCAD. The optimal placement of the shield wires on towers located on flat ground is determined. Furthermore, the shield wire configuration of a new portal tower with two shield wires and typical Swedish conditions is proposed and compared to a portal tower with one shield wire. The demand is that the amount of lightning faults should be reduced by half compared to the case with a portal tower without shield wires. It is concluded that in order to achieve this decrease in the amount of faults a portal tower with one shield wire requires a tower foot resistance of 16. 5 while a portal tower with two shield wires requires a tower foot resistance of 35. 1. The distribution between single line to ground faults and short circuits for both configurations is estimated, where a second shield wire proved to reduce the amount of short circuits. Furthermore, it is concluded that every cross arm needs to be grounded properly in order to achieve the desired lightning performance. A cost estimation based on an average 132 kV line with average loading showed that a second shield wire could not cover its own costs. It is important to remember that the cost estimation is based on an average 132 kV line and it does not consider important industries or costs of groundings. If this would be included a second shield wire could be profitable in some cases. Therefore it is recommended to consider the local conditions when deciding if a new transmission line is built with one or two shield wires...|$|R

However, estimates of the coefficients of variation (CV) of several provincial estimates indicate that the resulting poverty measures are not reliable. Making a decision based on unreliable poverty statistics is very risky especially if the decision to be made relates to the welfare of poor families. Such unreliable poverty statistics may also lead to incorrect targeting of the right beneficiaries of the poverty alleviation program. Hence, this paper provides alternative ways of coming up with subnational statistics (i. e., provincial and municipal/city-level data) that yield lower CVs than those of the official ones. This refers to the small area estimation (SAE) technique, a model-based approach to produce provincial or even municipal-level data. With a good predicting model, the SAE technique has a lot of potential in providing reliable subnational estimates for poverty reduction efforts. poverty statistics, small area estimates (SAE), synthetic estimation, composite estimation, regression-synthetic, empirical best linear unbiased prediction estimator (EBLUP), Elbers, Lanjouw, and Lanjouw (ELL) estimation procedure...|$|E
