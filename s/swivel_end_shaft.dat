50|$|The {{second of}} Limerick's River Shannon {{crossings}} {{is now called}} Sarsfield Bridge, to commemorate Patrick Sarsfield, the Earl of Lucan, who is renowned in Limerick {{for his role in}} the Williamite War and the 1691 siege and Treaty of Limerick in particular. The bridge was opened as Wellesley Bridge on 5 August 1835, following 11 years of construction. It was designed by the Scottish engineer Alexander Nimmo and based on the Pont de Neuilly in Paris. It was a particularly important development for the city as it allowed expansion to the northern shore of the river. The bridge itself consists of five large and elegant elliptical arches with an open balustrade, running from a man-made island, originally called Wellesley Pier but now known as Shannon Island, to the northern shore, and a simple flat, swivel deck with iron lattice railings crossing a canal and road from the island to what was known as Brunswick Street, now Sarsfield Street. The <b>swivel</b> <b>end</b> is no longer functional, although some of its heavy machinery is still intact underneath the roadway. A lock system has replaced the swivel section to allow for the passage of smaller boats. Apart from this, the bridge has remained largely unchanged since it opened and still has its original lamp standards.|$|R

5000|$|Shaft [...] - [...] {{straight}} {{or slightly}} angled, typically wider front-to-back than side-to-side, {{flat on the}} sides and smoothly rounded on the <b>ends.</b> Traditional <b>shafts</b> were made of wood, but are now almost exclusively of lightweight metals (such as aluminum, titanium and steel alloys) or composites (including fiberglass, Kevlar or carbon filament).|$|R
50|$|Example: A shaft {{is created}} by {{extruding}} a circle 100 mm. A hub is assembled to the <b>end</b> of the <b>shaft.</b> Later, the shaft is modified to be 200 mm long (click on the shaft, select the length dimension, modify to 200). When the model is updated the shaft will be 200 mm long, the hub will relocate to the <b>end</b> of the <b>shaft</b> to which it was assembled, and the engineering drawings and mass properties will reflect all changes automatically.|$|R

50|$|A {{motor-generator}} set, {{mainly of}} historical interest, {{consists of an}} electric motor and generator coupled together. A dynamotor combines both functions into a single unit with coils for both the motor and the generator functions wound around a single rotor; both coils share the same outer field coils or magnets. Typically the motor coils are driven from a commutator on one <b>end</b> of the <b>shaft,</b> when the generator coils output to another commutator on the other <b>end</b> of the <b>shaft.</b> The entire rotor and shaft assembly is smaller in size than a pair of machines, and may not have any exposed drive shafts.|$|R
50|$|While a {{motor-generator}} set may consist of distinct motor and generator machines coupled together, a single unit dynamotor (for dynamo-motor) has the motor coils and the generator coils wound around a single rotor; both the motor and generator therefore {{share the same}} outer field coils or magnets. Typically the motor coils are driven from a commutator on one <b>end</b> of the <b>shaft,</b> while the generator coils provide output to another commutator on the other <b>end</b> of the <b>shaft.</b> The entire rotor and shaft assembly is smaller, lighter, and cheaper than a pair of machines, and does not require exposed drive shafts.|$|R
