These bioengineered structures are suitable platforms for repetitive high density presentation of foreign epitope modules. However, due to the module’s diverse physicochemical properties, modularisation of capsomeres and VLPs requires tailoring of the physicochemical environment specific to each module to maintain protein stability against aggregation. Here, we report a high-throughput technique for <b>screening</b> <b>buffer</b> components to stabilize capsomeres, based on light scattering analysis. This screening method was applied to modular capsomeres presenting peptide epitopes from the rotavirus spike protein VP 8 subunit domain, engineered as a next-generation rotavirus vaccine candidate. Among various additives tested, non-ionic detergents, such as Triton X- 100, Tween- 80 and Tween- 20, were able to stabilize modular capsomeres, either alone or in combination with l-arginine, as confirmed with high-resolution size exclusion chromatography. Results demonstrate that tailoring the nature of the environment surrounding self-assembling proteins using small organic molecules can enhance the bioprocessing of modular vaccine capsomeres. The developed screening method potentially provides a powerful approach for rapid tailoring of processing conditions specific to antigenic modules displayed on next-generation recombinant capsomere and VLP vaccines, for low-cost vaccine delivery at global scale...|$|R

Thus, the computer's <b>screen</b> <b>buffer</b> only stores and knows about the underlying text characters (hence the name [...] "text mode") and the only location where the actual pixels representing those characters exist as a single unified image is the screen itself, as viewed by the user (thanks to the phenomenon of persistence of vision).|$|E

Hence, if determination of plasma fibrinogen is to achieve its potential usefulness in clinical medicine, more suitable analytical methods must be devised.

40|$|International audienceAmong noncovalent forces, {{electrostatic}} {{ones are}} {{the strongest and}} possess a rather long-range action. For these reasons, charges and counterions play {{a prominent role in}} self-assembly processes in water and therefore in many biological systems. However, the complexity of the biological media often hinders a detailed understanding of all the electrostatic-related events. In this context, we have studied the role of charges and counterions in the self-assembly of lanreotide, a cationic octapeptide. This peptide spontaneously forms monodisperse nanotubes (NTs) above a critical concentration when solubilized in pure water. Free from any <b>screening</b> <b>buffer,</b> we assessed the interactions between the different peptide oligomers and counterions in solutions, above and below the critical assembly concentration. Our results provide explanations for the selection of a dimeric building block instead of a monomeric one. Indeed, the apparent charge of the dimers is lower than that of the monomers because of strong chemisorption. This phenomenon has two consequences: (i) the dimer-dimer interaction is less repulsive than the monomer-monomer one and (ii) the lowered charge of the dimeric building block weakens the electrostatic repulsion from the positively charged NT walls. Moreover, additional counterion condensation (physisorption) occurs on the NT wall. We furthermore show that the counterions interacting with the NTs play a structural role as they tune the NTs diameter. We demonstrate by a simple model that counterions adsorption sites located on the inner face of the NT walls are responsible for this size control...|$|R
40|$|Constraint {{modeling}} is {{a necessary}} step in construction planning. The basic CPM approach provides a simple and practical means for resolving time-related precedence constraints between activities. However, most CPM-based tools do not support dealing with the constraints regarding resource and information availabilities at the productionlevel planning phase. When these constraints are concealed in the work plan, {{it is difficult to}} assure that they are removed in time so that work takes place as planned. Consequently, the reliability of work plans/assignments will be reduced. This paper presents a scheduling tool called integrated production scheduler (IPS) to handle the nonprecedence constraints in supply chain and information flow. The IPS has three main objectives to be fulfilled. The first is to promote work plan reliability. The second is to increase resource utilization and throughput based on the estimated resource profile. The third is to maintain a stable work flow through reducing uncertainties in the supply chain and information flow. To further facilitate reliable planning, a set of schedule buffers are established to help manage the constraints. Specifically, the working buffer and the shielding buffer ensure quality assignments by removing resource conflicts and supply chain uncertainties. The pulling <b>buffer</b> and the <b>screening</b> <b>buffer</b> increase resource and information availabilities by managing the delivery issues in advance. With the proposed schedule buffer management, it is feasible to enhance the reliability of look-ahead plans and consequently achieve lean process management...|$|R
50|$|In packed pixel or chunky framebuffer organization, {{the bits}} {{defining}} each pixel are grouped together.

The latter example is as opposed to storing perhaps half of the bits—2 bits—for each of four pixels in one byte {{and the other two}} bits for each of those four pixels in another byte or bytes. It is also as opposed to interleaving the bits of the two pixels within the byte. As this illustrates, packed pixel organization can be directly contrasted with planar organization.|$|E

The data sent over the bus was examined by the Z80 on the card, which then ran a selected subroutine contained in its ROM to place data into the frame buffer.

This change in programming methods resulted in many DOS TUI programs. The win32 console environment is notorious for its emulation of certain EGA/VGA text mode features, particularly a random access to the text buffer, even if the application runs in a window. On the other hand, programs running under Windows (both native and DOS applications) have much less control of the display and keyboard than Linux and DOS programs can have, because of aforementioned win32 console layer.|$|E

Here, {{the effect of}} the use of <b>screening</b> <b>buffer</b> layers on the epitaxial growth on such polar surfaces is investigated. Both transmission electron microscopy and in situ reflective high energy electron diffraction data imply that the buffer layers, SrRuO 3 or LaAlO 3, restore a near bulk-like termination at growth temperature, allowing for coherent growth of BiFeO 3 and CaTiO 3 for all deposited unit cell layers of the film material. An important crystalline orientation in the perovskite system, in terms of the ability to use strain engineering and to fabricate superlattices, is the (111) direction (A schematic drawing of a (111) oriented perovskite is shown in Figure 1 (a)). For example, if superlattices of perovskites are grown in the (111) orientation, it is possible to build artificial double perovskites. 1, 2 Another example is work done by Xiao et al., 3 which shows {{that it is possible to}} build a topological insulator by growing in the (111) direction. A lot of knowledge within the field of oxide thin films has been gained by the many heteroepitaxial systems involving cubic (001) substrates like SrTiO 3 in which case the surface and interface with the film perovskite structure has been well studied. From these studies, it has become clear that a good perovskite substrate surface fulfills three important criteria: (1) single termination; (2) a stable interface with air/vacuum without major reconstructions; and (3) a stable interface with the film material...|$|R

This new filtering, Depth Filter, can be implemented by adding a simple hardware in front of the per-pixel operation pipeline. m e Depth Filter is a filtering block which decides whether a pixel is shaded by celiain plane. The plane is the mask which has the history that a pixel has appeared in front of the plane. If the pixel is shaded, the pixel can be removed. The simulation shows that Depth Filter reduces the number of pixels to the next stage up to 62. 1 percent in random scene. As a result, 62. 1 % of memory bandwidth is saved with simple extra hardware. 1. INTRODUCTlON Consumer-oriented 3 D graphics hardware rapidly incorporates algorithms that increase flexibility and quality of per-pixel color processing; a recent example is a pixel shader [I]. However, determination if a pixel is visible and needs to be processed by a shader still relies on the <b>screen</b> Z <b>buffer</b> algorithm [2]. If the scene is more and more complex, depth buffer test also becomes a burden to the rendering engine. Consider, for example, an interactive walk-through of a detailed geometric database describing an entire city, complete with vegetation, buildings, Furniture inside the buildings and the contents of the furniture. Traditional visibility test which runs on current graphics hardware, the <b>screen</b> 2 <b>buffer</b> algorithm, is not capable of rendering very complex images at interactive rates because of the shortage of memory bandwidth. The vast memory bandwidth is used in the 2 buffer algorithm because every pixel requests the depth value stored in the depth buffer and the depth of every pixels survived in the depth test must be updated to the depth buffer...|$|R

In this study, we use the latest developments in the differential scanning fluorimetry guided refolding approach as an analytical method to detect correctly refolded protein. We describe a systematic <b>buffer</b> <b>screen</b> that contains a 96 -well primary pH-refolding screen in conjunction with a secondary additive screen.
