25|$|Following Israel's {{victory in}} the six day war, the war of {{attrition}} at the Suez Canal began. The Egyptians began firing in provocation against the Israeli forces posted on {{the eastern part of}} the canal. Haim Bar Lev, Israel's chief of staff, suggested that Israel construct a border line to protect its southern border. A wall of sand and earth raised along almost the entire length of the Suez Canal would both allow observation of Egyptian forces and conceal the movements of Israeli troops on the eastern side. This line, named after the chief of staff Haim Bar Lev, became known as the Bar Lev Line. It included at least thirty strong points <b>stretching</b> <b>over</b> almost 200 kilometers.|$|E
25|$|Twentieth-century {{views on}} the {{composition}} of Ezra revolved around whether the author was Ezra himself (and who may have also authored the Books of Chronicles) or was another author or authors (who also wrote the Chronicles). More recently it has been increasingly recognised that Ezra, Nehemiah and Chronicles all have extremely complex histories <b>stretching</b> <b>over</b> many stages of editing, and most scholars now are cautious of assuming a unified composition with a single theology and point of view. As {{an indication of the}} many layers of editing which Ezra has undergone, one recent study finds that Ezra 1–6 and Ezra 9–10 were originally separate documents, that they were spliced together at a later stage by the authors of Ezra 7–8, and that all have undergone extensive later editing.|$|E

25|$|Numerous {{secondary}} bundle burials of {{the bones}} of individuals previously stored in a charnel house were also made into the mound. After a few final intrusive burials into the southwestern edge, Sub3 and Sub1 were covered over in a blanket of earth and given its distinctive ridgetop shape. All of the burials in the mound are located within an area circumscribed by the arc of the woodhenge circle. In total roughly 272 individuals had been interred in Mound 72. In all six separate episodes of burial had happened at the mound, <b>stretching</b> <b>over</b> roughly one hundred year period. Researchers theorize that this could represent the lineage of a prominent family along with many retainers and sacrifices. Scholars believe almost 62 percent of the over 270 people interred in the mound were sacrificial victims, based on signs of ritual execution, method of burial, and other factors.|$|E
25|$|European rock {{drawings}} and cave paintings reveal that moose have been hunted since the Stone Age. Excavations in Alby, Sweden, {{adjacent to the}} Stora Alvaret have yielded moose antlers in wooden hut remains from 6000BCE, indicating {{some of the earliest}} moose hunting in northern Europe. In northern Scandinavia one can still find remains of trapping pits used for hunting moose. These pits, which can be up to 4×7m wide and 2m deep, would have been camouflaged with branches and leaves. They would have had steep sides lined with planks, making it impossible for the moose to escape once it fell in. The pits are normally found in large groups, crossing the moose's regular paths and <b>stretching</b> <b>over</b> several kilometers. Remains of wooden fences designed to guide the animals toward the pits have been found in bogs and peat. In Norway, an early example of these trapping devices has been dated to around 3,700BC. Trapping elk in pits is an extremely effective hunting method, and as early as the 16thcentury the Norwegian government tried to restrict their use. Nevertheless, the method was in use until the 19thcentury.|$|E
