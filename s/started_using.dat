5|$|In 2000, NSB <b>started</b> <b>using</b> Class 93 diesel {{multiple}} units on intercity trains, retiring the Di3. In March 2000, NSB announced {{the closing of}} several stations for the commuter train service. Fifty percent of the stations were responsible for only {{two percent of the}} traffic, and NSB instead wanted buses to transport people to the closest railway station, which would reduce overall transport time for most passengers. From 7 January 2001, a fixed, hourly headway was introduced on the trains from Steinkjer to Trondheim. Mære, Østborg, Rinnan and Elberg were closed, but HiNT Røstad opened. From June 2001, NSB introduced additional rush-hour trains between Trondheim and Steinkjer, giving a half-hour headway. The Nordland Line had not received NSB's first generation of train radio, Scanet, so was among the first lines to receive GSM-R from 1 December 2004. In 2010, CargoNet <b>started</b> <b>using</b> Vossloh Euro locomotives. Sykehuset Levanger Station was closed on 11 December 2010. Despite generating some 90,000 annual patrons and being one of the busiest stations on the line, it was located too close to Levanger Station to meet safety requirements.|$|E

By 2000, it had a staff of 65 people, up from 13 shortly after its foundation.

5|$|The Rhodes piano {{became a}} popular {{instrument}} in jazz {{in the late}} 1960s, particularly for several sidemen who played with Miles Davis. Herbie Hancock first encountered the instrument in 1968 while booked for a session with Davis. He immediately became an enthusiast, noting that the amplification allowed him to be heard much more easily in groups {{when compared to the}} piano. Hancock continued to experiment with the Rhodes over the next few years, including playing it through a wah wah. Another former Davis sideman, Chick Corea <b>started</b> <b>using</b> the Rhodes prominently during the 1970s, as did Weather Report founder Joe Zawinul. From 1969's In a Silent Way and Bitches Brew onwards, the Rhodes became the most prominent keyboard on Davis's recordings until the mid-1970s. Vince Guaraldi <b>started</b> <b>using</b> a Rhodes in 1968, and toured with both a piano and a Rhodes. He achieved particular prominence with his soundtrack music for A Charlie Brown Christmas and other Peanuts / Charlie Brown films.|$|E
5|$|Widerøe reintroduced direct {{flights to}} Oslo on 10 May 2010. Statoil <b>started</b> <b>using</b> {{scheduled}} services {{instead of their}} previous charter flights on 2 January 2011. This caused Widerøe {{to increase the number}} of direct flights to Oslo to three per day on 1 April 2011. Widerøe introduced irregular charter flights to Manchester in April 2012, largely targeting English tourists traveling on holidays and Norwegian football patriots.|$|E
5|$|Activity at Alta Airport {{peaked in}} the {{following}} years. SAS served Alta with up to ten daily services; at peak hours six aircraft were at the airport simultaneously, including two from Widerøe. From 1992, SAS reintroduced direct services from Kirkenes to Oslo, and aircraft in eastern Finnmark again started feeding into Kirkenes. The hub paradigm was thus gradually abandoned by SAS. Flights at Alta gradually decreased, hitting a low of 4,935 movements (landings and take-offs) in 2000. The North Cape Tunnel opened in 1999, connecting Honningsvåg and Nordkapp to the mainland. This reduced travel time to Alta and people from Nordkapp <b>started</b> <b>using</b> Alta more for long-haul flights {{at the expense of}} Honningsvåg Airport.|$|E

5|$|Although condoms {{effectively}} {{prevent the}} sexual transmission of HIV, several factors have limited widespread condom distribution and uptake in Malawi. People living in non-urban areas often have difficulty accessing condoms, and condoms are not typically available at bars {{and other social}} locations where {{they could have a}} significant impact on HIV prevention. Many people oppose condoms because they believe that condoms make sex less enjoyable or because they question their ability to prevent the transmission of HIV. However, despite these factors, many unmarried couples have <b>started</b> <b>using</b> condoms more consistently as concern and fear about the HIV/AIDS epidemic have increased.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, a {{wildlife}} monitoring organization, WildTrack, <b>started</b> <b>using</b> JMP with the Footprint Identification Technology (FIT) system to identify individual endangered animals by their footprints. In 2009, the Chicago Botanic Garden used JMP to analyze DNA data from tropical breadfruit. Researchers {{determined that the}} seedless, starchy fruit {{was created by the}} deliberate hybridization of two fruits, the breadnut and the dugdug. The Herzenberg Laboratory at Stanford has integrated JMP with the Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorter (FACS). The FACS system is used to study HIV, cancer, stem-cells and oceanography.|$|E

For the health sector, phase zero involved 40 communication centers, of which 20 were emergency rooms, 16 casualty wards at hospitals, one air ambulance coordination center and three emergency health communication centers, in addition to radios in the 150 ambulances that serves the region.|$|E

In January 2010 the rebels claimed to have shot down an Apache; this was denied by the Saudi military. In late January 2010, the leader of the Shiite rebels announced their withdrawal from Saudi territory, this announcement followed a key battle on 12 January when Saudi forces reportedly took control of the border village of Al Jabiri.|$|E
5|$|Major-thirds tuning has {{a smaller}} scope than {{standard}} guitar-tuning, and so Patt <b>started</b> <b>using</b> seven-string guitars, which enabled major-thirds tuning {{to have the}} E-e' range of the standard tuning. He first experimented with a wide-neck Mango guitar from the 1920s, which he modified to have seven strings in 1963. In 1967 he purchased a seven-string by José Rubio. Patt used major-thirds tuning when he performed as a session musician in New York City after 1965.|$|E
5|$|Major-thirds tuning was {{introduced}} in 1964 by jazz-guitarist Ralph Patt. He was studying with Gunther Schuller, whose twelve-tone technique was invented for atonal composition by his teacher, ArnoldSchoenberg. Patt was also inspired by the free jazz of OrnetteColeman and JohnColtrane. Seeking a guitar-tuning that would facilitate improvisation using twelve-tones, he introduced major-thirds tuning by 1964, perhaps in 1963. To achieve the E-E open-string range of standard (Spanish) tuning, Patt <b>started</b> <b>using</b> seven-string guitars in 1963, before settling on eight-string guitars with high G (equivalently A) as their highest open-notes. Patt used major-thirds tuning during all of {{his work as a}} session musician after 1965 in New York. Patt developed a webpage with extensive information about major-thirds tuning.|$|E
