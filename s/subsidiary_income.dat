In this study, based on principal-agent, firstly we analyses cooperative management factors in supply chain including leading enterprise expected utilities, <b>subsidiary</b> enterprise expected <b>incomes</b> and leading enterprise agency cost, then the incentive contract model is constructed; Secondly {{the model is}} solved {{in the case of}} symmetric information and asymmetric information; At last, in order to make clear of the model, this paper does mathematical analysis of leading enterprise expected utilities, <b>subsidiary</b> enterprise expected <b>incomes</b> and leading enterprise agency cost. Some important conclusions are obtained: subsidiary enterprise ability, cost coefficient, absolute risk aversion factor and output variance has the same influence on leading enterprise expected utilities and subsidiary enterprise expected incomes; subsidiary enterprise ability, cost coefficient has the same influence on leading enterprise expected utilities, <b>subsidiary</b> enterprise expected <b>incomes</b> and leading enterprise agency cost; leading enterprise expected utilities and <b>subsidiary</b> enterprise expected <b>incomes</b> become bigger and bigger, but leading enterprise agency cost becomes smaller and smaller with absolute risk aversion factor and output variance decreased. etc. Leading enterprise can take on incentive measures (improving subsidiary enterprise ability, decreasing subsidiary enterprise cost coefficient. etc) to optimize supply chain management based on the common factors...|$|R

5000|$|The tax law of many countries, {{including}} the United States, does not tax a shareholder of a corporation on the corporation's income until the income is distributed as a dividend. Prior to U.S. CFC rules, {{it was common}} for publicly traded companies in the United States to form foreign subsidiaries in tax havens and shift [...] "portable" [...] <b>income</b> to those <b>subsidiaries.</b> <b>Income</b> shifted included investment income (interest and dividends) and passive income (rents and royalties), as well as sales and services income involving related parties (see transfer pricing). U.S. tax on this income was avoided until the tax haven country paid a dividend to the shareholding company. This dividend could be avoided indefinitely by loaning the earnings to the shareholder without actually declaring a dividend. The CFC rules of Subpart F were intended to cause current taxation to the shareholder where income was of a sort that could be artificially shifted or was {{made available to the}} shareholder. At the same time, such rules were intended not to interfere with active business income or transactions with unrelated parties.|$|R

In order to discuss the different opinions regarding the consolidation theories we used the descriptive approach. As a result we tried to explain how these theories appeared and developed, respectively what consequences have their use in preparing consolidated financial statements. The results of the study suggest that every theory has certain aspects which differentiate it from the others in terms of recognition of <b>subsidiary</b> <b>income</b> and reporting net assets of the subsidiary. However, from all theories analyzed, the entity theory takes into account several guidelines of maximum importance when preparing consolidated financial statements: “You can’t own yourself!”, “You can’t owe yourself money!”, “You can’t make money selling to yourself. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper applies {{a dynamic}} panel model to explore whether the low-income {{countries}} 'catch up' {{with the rich}} ones by examining the threshold effects of per capita income on the convergence behavior of growth rates. Empirical evidence from 121 Penn World Table economies and 48 US states indicates that income levels have substantial impacts on the convergence behavior. First, convergence is insignificantly found in the lowest-income regimes, which is interpreted that these poor countries persist at their income levels, which cause possible income barriers-to-growth. That is, the poor countries {{may not be able}} to catch up with the rich ones easily, unless an income threshold is overcome. Second, convergence is significantly found beyond the lowest-income regime, implying that the low-income countries catch up with the rich. We conclude that when a certain income threshold is overcome, the poor countries catch up with the rich ones; hence a <b>subsidiary</b> <b>income</b> policy can be helpful.

40|$|Proposals for {{the reform}} of the {{taxation}} of cross-border income are evaluated within the general context of the corporate tax in an open economy. We focus on the various behavioral decisions that can be affected such as the location of income and its repatriation. The two income tax proposals considered are: (1) dividend exemption and (2) burden neutral worldwide taxation in which all foreign <b>subsidiary</b> <b>income</b> is included currently in the U. S. worldwide tax base, {{and at the same}} time the corporate tax rate is lowered and overhead allocations to foreign income are eliminated so as to keep the overall U. S. tax burden on foreign income the same. We also consider the attractiveness of destination-based and origin-based consumption taxes. Our evaluation of reform options makes use of the best available information. We also present new information on the burden of the current system. However, there are many important unknown behavioral parameters required to judge international tax systems and this missing information, some of which may ultimately be unknowable, makes it difficult to make definitive recommendations. The burden neutral worldwide option seems to offer greater efficiency gains among the two income tax options, particularly because of reduced incentives for income shifting which wastes resources and distorts effective tax rates on investment. To be sure, the burden neutral worldwide option would increase effective tax rates on investment in low-tax countries while not increasing the average U. S. tax rate on foreign source income. The option requires a substantial reduction in the U. S. corporate tax rate. We suggest that increased capital mobility makes changing the mix of corporate and personal level taxation of business income appropriate even apart from the special issues of cross-border taxation such as repatriation taxes and income shifting opportunities that are the main subject of the paper. international taxation, multinational corporations, tax reform...|$|E

The Simplified Income Tax (SIT) Plan recommends moving toward a territorial-based income tax system that would exempt active foreign-source business income of foreign branches and controlled foreign subsidiaries at the corporate level and would tax mobile foreign-source income. The Growth and Investment Tax (GIT) Plan recommends moving toward a consumption-based tax system that would tax U. S. businesses on total sales less certain inputs.

40|$|Sericulture is {{labour-intensive}} and well-suited {{to small}} and marginal farms with surplus labour, especially female labour. Ample labour {{and a small}} land-base encourage farmers to practise sericulture as a <b>subsidiary</b> occupation. While <b>income</b> from crop production is seasonal, sericulture provides a year-round income, which is an important incentive for small farmers to take up sericulture. The agricultural production is seasonal, while consumption is evenly spread over the years. Under such circumstances, the planners and policymakers are confronted {{with the challenge of}} formulating a suitable agricultural production policy with which the desired growth of agricultural production can be achieved. In the present study, optimum cropping patterns for different categories of sericulturists have been suggested by selecting Siddlaghatta in Kolar and Kollegal talukas in Mysore as study areas. The primary data have been collected using the personal interview method. The deterministic linear programming technique has been employed to work out the maximum attainable returns by small, medium and large farmers through the optimum allocation of various crops, sericulture and livestock (dairy), using the available resources. The model has suggested fewer crops in the cropping pattern of both the areas. The model has also suggested shifting of the cropping pattern from subsistence-dominated crops like ragi to commercial crops like bivoltine sericulture in the Kolar area and crossbreed sericulture in the Musore area. The suggested cropping patterns have increased the gross income in the range of 83. 55 to 388. 68 per cent in the Kolar area and 2. 71 to 10. 70 per cent in the Kollegal area.

40|$|M. Comm. The {{objective}} {{of the study is}} to critically evaluate the process of implementation of the residence—based system of taxation in South Africa and to evaluate whether the South African Revenue Service achieved their goals mentioned above through the implementation of this complex, sophisticated system of taxation. A well known cross border preference share structure will be utilised to illustrate the effect of the changes from a source to a residence taxation system. In order for a residence-based taxation system to be effective, it is essential that it draws into the tax net income earned by South Africanowned foreign entities (principally South African-owned foreign <b>subsidiaries).</b> If such <b>income</b> is not taxed, it is easy for South African residents to avoid tax by shifting their income to foreign entities in tax havens and preferential regimes, in which event the income earned by the foreign entity will be subjected to South African taxation only when repatriated as a dividend (Jooste, 2001 : 473 - 502). An efficient residence-based system spurns such a delay or deferral of taxation because taxpayers often delay repatriation for years, or never repatriate funds at all. This was exactly what the South African Revenue Service wanted to achieve through the introduction of the full-blown residence-based taxation system. The South African taxation system was based on a pure source system. Gradual changes in the economic environment necessitated certain amendments to the South African Income Tax Act to ensure that South Africa protects its tax base. Even though the residence based system of taxation was implemented {{over a number of years}} since 1997, numerous problems are still being encountered with the practical application of this complex system of taxation. South Africa's participation as a global player is examined from a tax perspective and practical application issues are examined. The taxation of foreign dividends introduced with effect 22 February 2002 serves as an example of the major impact that these changes had on cross-border structuring. Although this only serves as an example of the extent of the impact, various other cross-border structuring have been drastically impacted by these changes...|$|R
