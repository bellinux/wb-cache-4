5000|$|The [...] "Allround" [...] {{most closely}} resembles the P226 the range is built on. It is an X-Five with a DA/SA trigger assembly, {{and has the}} normal SIG Sauer decocker and {{internal}} <b>safeties.</b> The <b>pistol</b> is, amongst other things, intended for the IPSC Production division.|$|R
5000|$|The Model 745, {{built from}} 1986-1990, was a single-action target {{version of the}} Model 645, with a match barrel, Novak sight (an {{adjustable}} rear sight was optional), an adjustable trigger stop, stainless frame,walnut grip panels and blued slide. It does not have ambidextrous controls, but does have a half-cock <b>safety.</b> The <b>pistol</b> is rollmarked [...] "IPSC 10th Anniversary 1976-1986".|$|R
50|$|The trigger {{mechanism}} features a drop <b>safety.</b> If the <b>pistol</b> is dropped, this prevents inertia from causing the trigger {{to fire the}} weapon, thus preventing accidental discharge.|$|R
50|$|Smith & Wesson 410, part of Smith & Wesson's American Pride Series of pistols, was {{designed}} as an affordable handgun for the American market. The SA/DA semi-automatic pistol's controls include an external hammer, trigger, slide-release, magazine-release, and a safety located on the slide. Engagement of the safety also de-cocks the hammer. As an additional <b>safety,</b> the <b>pistol</b> will only fire if the magazine is locked in place. Factory sights and grip are plastic.|$|R
50|$|Tokyo Marui's {{electric}} blowback pistols (commonly {{referred to}} as EBBs) are powered by four AAA batteries and typically fire at 160 ft/s with a 0.12 gram BB. Some models may be select fire, and most models have an additional grip safety that must be held {{in order for the}} pistol to fire, {{with the exception of the}} Combat Delta models that use the gun's usual grip <b>safety.</b> The <b>pistols</b> feature a very weak blowback, and the slide usually only moves a third of the distance that it would on a typical GBB or real firearm.|$|R
50|$|The CZ 2075 BD model {{replaces the}} manual safety with a decocker, {{allowing}} {{the user to}} safely lower the hammer and prevent accidental firing. The decocker mechanism integrates a catch between the uncocked and fully cocked position {{that is designed to}} keep the hammer from striking the firing pin during the event the thumb should slip off the hammer prematurely during cocking. Pulling the trigger disables this <b>safety,</b> allowing the <b>pistol</b> to discharge.|$|R
5000|$|Most {{traditional}} semi-automatic double-action/single action (DA/SA) pistols {{are designed}} to be carried with the hammer down (uncocked) on a chambered round, with or without a manual <b>safety</b> engaged. The <b>pistol</b> is considered safe in this state as the [...] "double-action" [...] pull that both cocks and fires the firearm is both longer and heavier than the [...] "single-action" [...] pull that simply releases the cocked hammer, and thus an inadvertent trigger pull is less likely.|$|R
5000|$|A {{relevant}} discussion {{attends the}} use of magazine-safeties in semi-automatic <b>pistols.</b> Such <b>safeties</b> prevent the <b>pistol</b> from firing {{if there is a}} round in the chamber, but the magazine is removed. Some self-defense experts dislike this feature, as it may allow the pistol to be [...] "disabled" [...] unexpectedly during a struggle, so that the pistol fails when needed. Others feel that it may improve user safety and prevent some accidental discharges. Both semi-auto pistol designs, with and without magazine-safeties, are currently manufactured.|$|R
5000|$|The HP22A and HP25A {{are small}} {{semi-automatic}} pistols chambered in the [...]22 Long Rifle or [...]25 ACP cartridge, respectively. they are blowback operated pistols and come with 3 inch barrels. Optional 5 inch barrels are available. The frame is alloy with a steel barrel and alloy slide. They are single-action pistols. The HP22 feeds from a staggered 10-round magazine, and the HP25 feeds from a staggered 9-round magazine. They {{have a unique}} slide mounted firing pin block {{in addition to a}} regular manual <b>safety.</b> The <b>pistol</b> includes a magazine disconnect feature, which prevents the gun from firing without a magazine. The magazine cannot be removed without engaging the manual safety. The HP22A/HP25A have a shotgun-style ventilated rib along the top and feature a blade front sight with windage-adjustable notch-type rear sight. They are available in nickel or blued finish.|$|R
50|$|The actions {{available}} are double-action only (DAO) or double/single action (DA/SA), {{as well as}} {{the newer}} DAK trigger system developed for law enforcement, which functions as a DAO trigger with a 6.5 lb (29 N) trigger pull. DA/SA pistols have a de-cocking lever {{on the left side of}} the frame in front of the slide-release. This lever lowers the hammer from cocked to de-cocked and engages a firing-pin <b>safety,</b> making the <b>pistol</b> safer to carry. With the hammer in the down position, the pistol can be fired by just pulling the trigger.|$|R
50|$|The trigger group, manual <b>safety</b> and <b>pistol</b> grip {{consist of}} one {{detachable}} module attached under the receiver. This group {{consists of a}} fully adjustable two-stage trigger featuring an adjustable trigger pull weight of 1.5 to 2.5 kg (3 to 5 lb) and a trigger path that can be externally adjusted without disassembly of the unit. An ambidextrous manual safety is conveniently located above the pistol grip. The APR308 has a side-folding stock which {{is attached to the}} lower receiver with a rugged steel hinge. It offers an adjustable butt plate and length of pull spacer system. The cheek-rest is also fully adjustable. These adjustment options allow shooters of various sizes and shapes to tailor the APR folding stock to their personal preferences, which is an uncommon feature for folding stocks. An additional folding height-adjustable monopod is attached {{to the rear of the}} buttstock and allows the shooter to rest the rifle during extended periods of observation.|$|R
50|$|The grip of this pistol {{features}} a built-in cocking lever {{located at the}} front of the grip. Before the pistol can be fired, this lever must be squeezed; thus this lever acts as a <b>safety.</b> The <b>pistol</b> is striker fired. Squeezing the cocking lever with a force of 70 N cocks the firing pin. Once fully depressed, only 2 pounds of force are required to keep the weapon cocked. The weapon is then fired by pressing the single stage trigger rated at approximately 20 N As long as the lever is depressed, the weapon fires like any other semi-automatic pistol. If the lever is released, the weapon is immediately de-cocked and rendered safe. This method of operation dispensed the need for a manual safety selector while providing safety for the user carrying the pistol with a chambered round, and increased the speed with which the pistol could be deployed and fired. The trigger and firing mechanism's method of operation (and the unique slide catch) were protected by , issued on January 2, 1979.|$|R
50|$|The A-100 is a recoil-operated, locked breech {{design with}} {{improved}} Browning-style linkless locking. The lock up {{is similar to}} the Browning High Power or CZ-75 with locking lugs {{on the top of the}} barrel which mate with lugs in the slide (not with a single lug in the ejection port like a SIG P22X.) The <b>pistol's</b> <b>safety</b> features include a manual decocking lever, firing pin block, and hammer safety. The A-100 lacks a manual safety, but depends entirely on a deliberate pull of its trigger to fire it; in this way it {{is similar to the}} SIG P22X series of pistols. The double-action trigger pull is relatively long and heavy, thereby precluding the need for a safety as the probability of an inadvertent discharge is low.|$|R
5000|$|The Bren Ten {{is a short}} recoil operated, locked breech {{semi-automatic}} pistol {{that uses}} a Browning Hi-Power style linkless system. The pistol has the capability of being fired single- or double action and feature an ambidextrous frame-mounted combat [...] "switch" [...] style manual safety that locks the sear so the trigger cannot be moved rearward {{as well as an}} internal firing pin block safety which stops the firing pin from traveling forward. The manual <b>safety</b> allows the <b>pistol</b> to be carried with the hammer back, ready for use just by switching the safety off, a configuration known as condition one. The Bren Ten has adjustable iron sights with three dots for increased visibility. The Bren Ten standard grips are made by Hogue from black textured nylon.|$|R
50|$|On 16 February 1982 she {{was arrested}} in Paris by French police {{together}} with Bruno Bréguet, a Swiss citizen who had served a prison sentence in Israel for possession of explosives. When a policeman noticed their Peugeot car was improperly parked and asked to see their papers Breguet attempted to shoot him but had forgotten to release his <b>pistol's</b> <b>safety</b> catch and was overpowered. Kopp, who had bolted, was cornered {{a block away from}} the scene and surrendered. Five kilos of Penthrit (pentaerythritol tetranitrate) were found in the car as well as false passports and other incriminating documents including sketch plans of various locations. Under interrogation it was established that they were planning to blow up the offices of the exiled Arabic political magazine Al Watan Al Arabi because it had annoyed Syria's President Hafez el-Assad who had granted Kopp, Carlos and other terrorists asylum in Damascus.|$|R
50|$|While the Hi-Power {{remains an}} {{excellent}} design, {{since the early}} 1990s it has been eclipsed somewhat by more modern designs which are often double-action and are manufactured using more modern methods. It remains in service throughout the world. As of 2017, the MK1 version remained the standard service pistol of the Canadian Armed Forces, with the SIG Sauer P226 being issued to specialised units along with the SIG Sauer P225. The weapon is the standard sidearm of the Belgian Army, Indian Army, Indonesian Armed Forces, Australian Defence Force, Argentine Army, Luxembourg Army, Israel Police, and Venezuelan Army, among others. The Irish Army replaced its Browning Pistols (known popularly as BAPs, or Browning Automatic Pistols) with the Heckler & Koch USP in 2007. From 2013 the British Army is replacing the Browning with the polymer-framed Glock 17 Gen 4 pistol, due to concerns about weight and the external <b>safety</b> of the <b>pistol.</b>|$|R
25|$|The Model 1910 fires from {{a locked}} breech. When fired, the barrel and bolt recoil together. The barrel will stop in a {{rearward}} position. The bolt, unlocking itself, will then continue forward, stripping the chamber and driving the barrel forward again. After this action, a wedge will {{rise from the}} frame and lock the entire frame back into position. This firing system wasn't strong and had to fire cartridges weaker than the comparable 9×19 Parabellum caliber. The screw {{at the front of}} the frame, when undone will allow the removal of a plate on the left side of the pistol granting access to the moving parts within the pistol. This design was not stiff enough to sufficiently support the left side of the barrel extension and after prolonged firing, the left plate was prone to loosening. The only <b>safety</b> on the <b>pistol</b> was a small lever set in front of the grip.|$|R

5000|$|The PF-9 is {{manufactured}} in Cocoa, Florida, by Kel-Tec CNC Industries. Featuring {{extensive use of}} computer numerical control (CNC) manufacturing techniques, its six main components consist of the barrel, slide, frame, grip, trigger group, and magazine. The barrel is manufactured of SAE/AISI 4140 steel hardened to 48 RHC, and the slide is constructed of the same steel. The frame, which houses the trigger group, consists of a solid machined 7075-T56 aluminum billet. A transfer bar system connects the hammer and trigger. A hammer block safety is incorporated which helps prevent accidental discharge if the pistol is dropped. The long double-action-only trigger pull provides an additional <b>safety</b> feature. The <b>pistol</b> includes a slide hold-open feature which locks the slide in its rearmost position after the last round is fired. The grip is made of DuPont ST-8018 polymer and holds the steel, 7-round, single-column magazine. [...] The sights consist of a fixed front blade and a windage-adjustable notched rear sight. Three white dots highlight the sights for optimum visibility in low-light conditions.|$|R
2500|$|Siddiqui {{insisted on}} testifying {{at the trial}} {{against the advice of}} her lawyers. According to at least one source (Deborah Scroggins), Siddiqui [...] "avoided the {{question}} of where she had been for the last five years" [...] and her replies under cross examination [...] may have damaged her credibility in jurists' eyes. In answer to prosecutor's questions she stated that [...] the documents in her bag on terror plans and weapons had been given to her, and that she did not know that the boy who was with her in Ghazni was her son. When it was pointed out that the document in her bag were in her own handwriting, she stated [...] "in a vague and halting manner" [...] that she had been forced to copy them out of a magazine so that her children would not be tortured. When questioned about taking a firearms course she stated that [...] "everyone used to take it". The <b>pistol</b> <b>safety</b> instructor then testified that he remembered teaching her how to fire [...] "hundreds of rounds." [...] In his closing arguments the prosecutor told the jury that Siddiqui had [...] "raised her right hand" [...] and [...] "lied to your face".|$|R
5000|$|The Tanfoglio Force {{is a short}} recoil operated, locked breech {{semi-automatic}} pistol {{that uses}} a Browning Hi-Power style linkless system. Most models have the capability of being fired single- and double-action and feature an ambidextrous frame-mounted combat [...] "switch" [...] style manual safety that locks the sear so the trigger cannot be moved rearward {{as well as an}} internal firing pin block safety which stops the firing pin from travelling forward. The manual <b>safety</b> allows the <b>pistol</b> to be carried with the hammer back, ready for use just by switching the safety off, a configuration known as condition one. Unlike most other semi-automatic pistols, the slide rides inside the frame rails rather than outside similar to the SIG P210. This provides a very tight slide-to-frame fit, very good barrel lock-up and contributes to good accuracy. A new slide with a slide-mounted safety/decocker lever (similar to the Tanfoglio T95 Standard) is available for the Force 99 as a factory option. Most variants have fixed iron sights with three dots for increased visibility. Fully adjustable micrometer competition sights that can be adjusted for windage are fitted to some variants. The Tanfoglio Force models feature high-capacity [...] "double-stack" [...] magazines. It {{is also one of the}} few production semi-automatic pistols available in the 10mm Auto chambering.|$|R
40|$|When {{the word}} punk is invoked, a {{majority}} of people – in the UK, at least – will think of the Sex <b>Pistols,</b> <b>safety</b> pins through the nose and other such bands and signifiers from the late 1970 s. The purpose of this research, in large part, {{is to show that}} punk has in fact been a persistent and consistent tradition in the decades since. Power and tradition are the two concepts, above all others, which the thesis will assess {{in the light of the}} punk case. Four notable micro-scenes from this tradition are explored in case-studies. In each of these micro-scenes, elements of novelty have been apparent and seem to have empowered the participants in the scene precisely by giving them a sense of being subjects with clear differences from the larger tradition. Since this notion of subjectivity is based on a faith in novel difference as qualifier of identity, the thesis will employ philosophical work on difference, novelty and subjectivity in order to critically engage this aspiration. Does bringing something markedly new to the tradition truly empower the punks in their various micro-scenes? Alternatively, could fidelity to tradition perhaps lead to a greater empowerment in which the punk scene could gain greater influence within the macro-scene of popular music as well as, perhaps, encouraging political change in wider macro-social terms?EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
5000|$|SPAS-12 models feature two safeties: (i) a {{lever style}} or push button style safety, and (ii) a [...] "quick {{employment}} safety". Lever safeties were recalled by Franchi and were replaced through the importer American Arms {{in the early}} 1990s. There {{are two types of}} push-button safeties. The earliest version would release the hammer on safe up to 1/4in. of travel when the trigger was depressed; this would cause a lockup of the action that would require the user to relock the bolt assembly to the rear to reset the hammer and then reload the chamber. The later version installed a detent and machined hole in the trigger group frame to prevent an action lock; the detent would prevent the hammer from engaging when the trigger was depressed and would prevent an action lock from occurring. The quick employment safety, which is {{on the left side of}} the trigger guard, disconnects the trigger when put into safe mode. The quick employment safety can be disengaged with the trigger finger when ready to fire and is intended for competition or tactical use. A third <b>safety</b> type, a <b>pistol</b> grip <b>safety</b> similar to the later-developed SPAS-15, is known to have been developed by Franchi for the SPAS-12, however the <b>pistol</b> grip <b>safety</b> was not offered for sale to the general public.|$|R
5000|$|The Walther PPX is a {{semi-automatic}} pistol {{developed by}} the German company Carl Walther GmbH Sportwaffen of Ulm as a low cost duty pistol.
