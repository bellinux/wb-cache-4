[...] However, when Veeck was asked for proof of his allegations against Landis, he stated, [...] "I have no proof of that. I can only surmise."

2500|$|The Ancient Greek word [...] "μήλον" [...] (mēlon), now a loanword in English as melon {{or water}} melon did not mean, in Homer's time, apple, the pomaceous fruit, but sheep or goat.

Toyota extended its floor mat recall on 25 November to reconfigure the accelerator pedal, replace the all-weather floor mats, and install a brake override system to prevent sudden unintended acceleration. Toyota issued a fourth unwanted acceleration-related recall for the Camry on 21 January 2010, this time in response to reports of accelerator pedals <b>sticking</b> <b>in</b> models without floor mats. Evaluations by Car and Driver and Edmunds found that the Camry's brakes were powerful enough to overcome the accelerator in all tests, bringing the car safely to a stop.|$|E

2500|$|The use of {{the hook}} in angling is descended, historically, from what would today be called a [...] "gorge." [...] The word [...] "gorge", in this context, comes from the French word meaning [...] "throat." [...] Gorges were used by ancient peoples to capture fish and animals like seal, walrus and birds. A gorge was a long, thin piece of bone or stone {{attached}} by its midpoint to a thin line. The gorge would be baited {{so that it would}} rest parallel to the lay of the line. When the game would swallow the bait, a tug on the line would cause the gorge to orient itself at right angles to the line, thereby <b>sticking</b> <b>in</b> the fish or animal's throat or gullet. [...] Some laws and regulations require hooks to be barbless. [...] This rule is commonly implemented to protect populations of certain species. [...] A barbed hook could kill a fish if it were to penetrate the gills.|$|E

Norman Yardley, barely {{recognised}} as a change bowler by Yorkshire, took 3/19; [...] "It was always amusing to watch the Englishmen when Yardley took a wicket. The first time he succeeded they seemed faintly amused, but when he was regularly breaking partnerships their enthusiasm knew no bounds..." [...] The MCC made a pedestrian reply with 9 batsmen getting into double figures, but only two passing 50. Hutton (42) and Washbrook (40) made 65 together, Denis Compton 55 and Bill Edrich 64 not out. Ian Johnson opened the bowling with 4/53 and Colin McCool took 6/105 (Hutton, Washbrook, Gibb, Hammond, Yardley and Bedser) and the tourists were out for 310. Queensland batted for a declaration hitting 230/6 in 177 minutes, Ken Mackay <b>sticking</b> <b>in</b> for 33 not out while Len Johnson hit 75 at the other end.

2500|$|Camilla Pia of The Fly {{magazine}} raved, [...] "Packed full of sparkling pop with a folky {{heart and}} an electronic edge, the debut is ridiculously infectious; swooping choruses and lyrics of all-consuming love and losing it <b>sticking</b> <b>in</b> your head from first listen." [...] The Independent critic Andy Gill noted that [...] "despite the occasional furtive flourish of acoustic guitar, {{her work on}} this debut album is more akin to the retro-synthpop of Little Boots and La Roux, thanks to the thoroughness with which production partner Fin Dow-Smith has smothered her folkie origins under a welter of busily cycling synths and programmed beats." [...] Spins Caryn Ganz referred to the album as [...] "hiny, wholesome dance-pop, {{with a dash of}} saucy" [...] on which Goulding [...] "glides through blippy anthems , pumping disco , and delicate grooves [...] with a pixie-ish voice that's one notch sweeter than Metric's Emily Haines." [...] Pitchfork Media's Stephen Troussé wrote, [...] "Outside of its immediate context, Lights is a sometimes great, always promising debut. It's an album about leaving home, and it works best when the contrast between the folk singer and the pop production chimes with the tensions between the pull of home and the allure of the city." [...] Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone expressed that Goulding has [...] "a classic British folkie's voice—the kind of tremulous soprano that evokes a wintry day on a fog-swaddled moor. But Lights places her vocals and minor-key melodies against producer Starsmith's club-ready mix of synths and brisk, busy electro rhythms. The results are moody , pretty [...] and uniformly catchy." ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{his time}} as the {{commander}} of the Army of the Occupation in France, Woodford engaged in archaeological excavations on the supposed site of the Battle of Azincourt. During these excavations, Woodford found numerous artefacts, and these finds were reported by newspapers at the times, including the Caledonian Mercury on 25 May 1818 and The Morning Chronicle on 20 April 1818. They included bones, arrow-heads and upwards of sixty coins. One such coin was in a high state of preservation, on the one side the arms of France and the inscription Karolus Dei Gracia Francorum Rex (translated from Latin as Charles, by God's Grace, King of the French) and on the reverse PC Regnat, PC Imperat ('PC' standing for the Latin per Christum, 'regnat' for 'reign' or 'rule' and 'imperat' for 'command', 'rule' or 'impose'). Fragments of iron, two lance-heads (one six, the other eight inches long), a spur, buckles, 'other insignia of the fray' and several rings. These rings, some of which were gold, had inscriptions on them, and were thought to be pledges, which were 'given to the Knights by their fair Dames, on departing to the wars'. One ring is enamelled and on the outside has the words pleine amitie (roughly translated from French as 'solid friendship') and inside a flower like a rose, with 'belle' after it. It is thought this could create the name of a lady, Rosabelle. Another ring, made of brass, was found with a finger bone <b>sticking</b> <b>in</b> it. Unfortunately the present-day locations of these finds are unknown.|$|E

Winger David Booth was {{scheduled}} {{to return to the}} line-up {{for the first time since}} an ankle injury ended his previous season in March. During the morning practice he suffered a groin injury but returned for the game. Jordan Schroeder became the first casualty of shot blocking suffering a hairline fracture in his foot after being struck by a Nail Yakupov shot. Jensen was checked hard into the boards and sustained a shoulder injury. Dale Weise delivered a check to Taylor Hall striking the Oilers' forward in the head. Hall later said that the hit was [...] "probably a mistake on both parts" [...] and [...] "I have to have my head up". Hall was uninjured on the play and stayed in the game. The hit was reviewed by the NHL's Senior Vice President, and disciplinarian, Brendan Shanahan who suspended Weise for the remaining three games of the preseason. Later in the game Zack Kassian attempted to deliver a body check to Sam Gagner, who made a hard stop to avoid contact. Kassian began a spin move while swinging his stick towards Gagner, lost his balance so that it hit Gagner's head. He suffered a broken jaw, eventually missing the first 13 games of the season. Kassian was assessed a double minor penalty for high <b>sticking.</b> <b>In</b> a post game interview, Oilers head coach Dallas Eakins called the action [...] "a disturbing play by a disturbing player". During his disciplinary review of the play, Shanahan said that he accepted Kassian's claim that he did not intend to strike Gagner in the head, but that he was responsible for his actions. He suspended Kassian for eight games – the remaining three pre-season, and five regular season games.|$|E

The other wife had eight children. [...] "In a fight with the Crows, Chief Black Fox was shot below the right eye with an arrow.

[...] The arrow-point was <b>sticking</b> <b>in</b> the back of his skull. [...] It was rusted. [...] We took it home with us." [...] Kicking Bear (c. 1846-c. 1880) was Flying Hawk's full and older brother. Kicking Bear was a noted warrior and leader of the Ghost Dance. [...] Black Fox II ("Young Black Fox") was Flying Hawk's half-brother and named for his father. Crazy Horse was the first cousin of Flying Hawk.
