The UK based aircraft were sent out to work all over the world. The company undertook aerial surveys for local authorities within the UK and for many overseas Governments. Maps were also published under the Fairey-Falcon imprint. Over the years the companies names were changed to reflect Fairey ownership and operated into the late 1970s, later becoming Clyde <b>Surveying</b> <b>Services</b> Ltd.

The thesis deals with the part of the <b>surveying</b> <b>services</b> during the construction of buildings, as regulated in Slovenia; the focus is primarily on the operations of the cadastral pre editing and recording the new situation in the official real estate records. The analysis of the legal framework and procedures of <b>surveying</b> <b>services</b> involves the various phases of the construction project. This is especially emphasized in the preparation of the surveying basis for the purposes of project documentation, project implementation and registration of the final state in surveying records. As a practical example, a project of surveying works at the international border crossing Sočerga, is presented. The project includes cadastral surveying and other work in the cadastral editing area of the border crossing and the building and recording of a new facility at the site in the land cadastre and buildings cadastre...|$|E

40|$|Successful {{knowledge}} transfer {{is an important}} process which requires continuous improvement in today's knowledgeintensive economy. However, improving {{knowledge transfer}} processes represents a challenge {{for most of the}} small and medium size consulting firms. In recent years, the terminology 'knowledge management' initiative has been introduced. The concept of knowledge management (KM) is seen as the solution through the inculcation of knowledge sharing via various tools and techniques in managing the knowledge within parties in construction. Through intranet as one of the KM tools, the organisations are able to create, acquire and transfer knowledge. The aim of this research paper was to investigate how quantity surveying (QS) consulting firms is exploiting intranet technology in facilitating knowledge management in order to deliver quantity <b>surveying</b> <b>services</b> efficiently. A qualitative approach through semi-structured interviews was adopted as the method used to establish current knowledge management practices and the tools used for sharing knowledge and learning. The study finds that the use of intranet has not been used to its fullest potential due to the barriers and challenges in using intranet as KM tools. Thus has created some problems with regard to deliver quantity <b>surveying</b> <b>services</b> efficiently. A discussion is also included on the future research direction {{for the development of a}} conceptual framework to support the integration of quantity's surveyor services with relevant knowledge management initiative. © 2012 IEEE...|$|E
