50|$|Though {{there are}} several {{molecules}} that fall {{into the category of}} <b>steviol</b> <b>glycoside,</b> synthesis follows a similar route.

50|$|According {{to basic}} research, <b>steviol</b> <b>glycosides</b> and steviol {{interact}} with a protein channel called TRPM5, potentiating the {{signal from the}} sweet or bitter receptors, amplifying the taste of other sweet, bitter and umami tastants.

5000|$|<b>Steviol</b> <b>glycosides</b> from Stevia rebaudiana {{have been}} {{reported}} to be between 30 and 320 times sweeter than sucrose, although there is some disagreement in the technical literature about these numbers. They are heat-stable, pH-stable, and do not ferment. [...] Additionally, they do not induce a glycemic response when ingested, because humans can not metabolize stevia. This making them attractive as natural sugar substitutes for diabetics and other people on carbohydrate-controlled diets. <b>Steviol</b> <b>glycosides</b> stimulate the insulin secretion through potentiation of the β-cell, preventing high blood glucose after a meal. [...] The acceptable daily intake (ADI) for <b>steviol</b> <b>glycosides,</b> expressed as steviol equivalents, has been established to be 4 mg/kg body weight/day, and is based on no observed effects of a 100 fold higher dose in a rat study.|$|E

50|$|Stevia {{is widely}} grown for its sweet leaves, {{which are the}} source of {{sweetener}} products known generically as stevia and sold under various trade names. The chemical compounds that produce its sweetness are various <b>steviol</b> <b>glycosides</b> (mainly stevioside and rebaudioside), which have 250-300 times the sweetness of sugar.|$|E
50|$|The active {{compounds}} of stevia are <b>steviol</b> <b>glycosides</b> (mainly stevioside and rebaudioside), {{which have}} up to 150 times the sweetness of sugar, are heat-stable, pH-stable, and not fermentable. Stevia's taste has a slower onset and longer duration than that of sugar, {{and some of its}} extracts may have a bitter or licorice-like aftertaste at high concentrations.|$|E
50|$|Rebaudioside A has {{the least}} {{bitterness}} {{of all the}} <b>steviol</b> <b>glycosides</b> in the Stevia rebaudiana plant. To produce rebaudioside A commercially, stevia plants are dried and subjected to a water extraction process. This crude extract contains about 50% rebaudioside A. The various glycosides are separated and purified via crystallization techniques, typically using ethanol or methanol as solvent.|$|E

5000|$|Rebiana is {{the trade}} name for high-purity rebaudioside A, a <b>steviol</b> <b>glycoside</b> that is 200 times {{as sweet as}} sugar.

40|$|AbstractStevioside, {{a potent}} {{sweetener}} obtained from leaves of Stevia rebaudiana (Bertoni), is the glycone of steviol. However, despite its natural origin, {{there has been}} concern about stevioside toxicity due to hydrolysis to the carcinogenic steviol. To approve it as an additive, the FAO/WHO committee on food additives has required further information about hydrolytic stability of the <b>steviol</b> <b>glycoside</b> in acidic foods and beverages. In this study, aqueous solutions of stevioside at different pH values were monitored in real time by direct infusion ESI-MS. Owing to the high speed and sensitivity of ESI-MS monitoring, fast hydrolysis of the stevioside molecule to steviol in aqueous acidic solutions was observed, particularly in acidic juices...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the keys}} for {{successfully}} developing drugs against the broad spectrum of cancer cell types is structural diversity. In the current study, we focused on a family of isosteviol derivatives as potential novel antitumor agents. Isosteviol is a tetracyclic diterpenoid obtained by acid hydrolysis of <b>steviol</b> <b>glycoside</b> extracts isolated from abundant Stevia rebaudiana plants. In this work, we have designed and synthesized a panel of isosteviol triazole conjugates using “click” chemistry methodology. Evaluation of these compounds against a series of cancer cell lines derived from primary and metastatic tumors demonstrated that these conjugates exhibit cytotoxic activities with IC 50 in the low μM range. In addition, their anti-proliferative activities are cancer cell type specific. Taken together, our studies underscore the importance of structural diversity in achieving cancer cell type specific drug development...|$|R
40|$|This {{study focused}} on the agronomic, {{physiological}} and biochemical response of Stevia rebaudiana Bertoni grown under different nitrogen (N) rates.

The results demonstrate that using an appropriate N rate it is possible to improve rebaudioside A content, rebaudioside A/stevioside ratio, photosynthetic CO 2 assimilation, stomatal conductance, PNUE, Rubisco activity and PSII efficiency. Our study highlights that through N it is possible to modulate the SG biosynthesis, with {{a significant increase in the}} rebaudioside A content and in the ratio between rebaudioside A and stevioside...|$|R
