5|$|Interspecific {{predation}} among pinnipeds does occur. The {{leopard seal}} {{is known to}} prey on numerous other species, especially the crabeater seal. Leopard seals typically target crabeater pups, which form {{an important part of}} their diet from November to January. Older crabeater seals commonly bear scars from failed leopard seal attacks; a 1977 study found that 75% of a sample of 85 individual crabeaters had these scars. Walruses, despite being specialized for feeding on bottom-dwelling invertebrates, occasionally prey on Arctic seals. They kill their prey with their long tusks and eat their blubber and skin. Steller sea lions have been recorded eating the pups of harbor seals, northern fur seals and California sea lions. New Zealand sea lions feed on pups of some fur seal species, and the <b>South</b> <b>American</b> <b>sea</b> <b>lion</b> may prey on South American fur seals.|$|E

500|$|Adult male {{pinnipeds}} {{have several}} strategies to ensure reproductive success. Otariids establish territories containing resources that attract females, such as shade, tide pools or access to water. Territorial boundaries are usually marked by natural {{breaks in the}} substrate, and males defend their territorial boundaries with threatening vocalizations and postures, but physical fights are usually avoided. Individuals also return to the same territorial site each breeding season. In certain species, like the Steller sea lion and northern fur seal, a dominant male can maintain a territory {{for as long as}} 2–3 months. Females can usually move freely between territories and males are unable to coerce them, but in some species such as the northern fur seal, <b>South</b> <b>American</b> <b>sea</b> <b>lion</b> and Australian sea lion, males can successfully contain females in their territories and prevent them from leaving. In some phocid species, like the harbor seal, Weddell seal and bearded seal, the males have underwater territories called [...] "maritories" [...] near female haul-out areas. These are also maintained by vocalizations. The maritories of Weddell seal males can overlap with female breathing holes in the ice.|$|E

Thus, five of these parasites were zoonotic (Diphyllobothriidae gen. sp., Anisakidae gen. sp., Giardia, Cryptosporidium, and Balantidium). Overall, these parasitological findings included four new parasite records for Otaria flavescens, that is, Giardia, Cryptosporidium, Balantidium, and Otostrongylus.

40|$|Our {{understanding}} of how air-breathing marine predators cope with environmental variability is limited by our inadequate knowledge of their ecological and physiological parameters. Due to their wide distribution along both coasts of the sub-continent, <b>South</b> <b>American</b> <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> (Otaria byronia) provide a valuable opportunity to study the behavioral and physiological plasticity of a marine predator in different environments. We measured the oxygen stores and diving behavior of <b>South</b> <b>American</b> <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> throughout most of its range, allowing us to demonstrate that diving ability and behavior vary across its range. We found {{no significant differences in}} mass-specific blood volumes of <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> among field sites and a negative relationship between mass-specific oxygen storage and size, which suggests that exposure to different habitats and geographical locations better explains oxygen storage capacities and diving capability in <b>South</b> <b>American</b> <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> than body size alone. The largest animals in our study (individuals from Uruguay) were the most shallow and short duration divers, and had the lowest mass-specific total body oxygen stores, while the deepest and longest duration divers (individuals from Southern Chile) had significantly larger mass-specific oxygen stores, despite being much smaller animals. Our study suggests that the physiology of air-breathing diving predators is not fixed, but that it can be adjusted, to a certain extent, depending on the ecological setting and or habitat. These adjustments {{can be thought of as}} a "training effect" as the animal continues to push its physiological capacity through greater hypoxic exposure, its breath holding capacity increases...|$|R

40|$|Marine predators may undergo {{remarkable}} dietary changes {{through time}} {{as a result of}} both anthropogenic and natural changes in the environment, but this variability is often difficult to tackle and seldom incorporated into ecosystem models. This paper uses the stable isotope ratios of carbon and nitrogen in skeletal material of <b>South</b> <b>American</b> <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> from Brazilian scientific collections to investigate whether these animals modified their diet from 1986 to 2009, as reported for other marine predators in the region. Stable isotope ratios indicated that demersal potential prey were always enriched in 13 C as compared with pelagic prey. Accordingly, the absence of any statistically significant correlation between stranding year and the δ 13 C values of adult males indicated no major increase in the consumption of pelagic prey from 1986 to 2009. Likewise, the results of the mixing model SIAR revealed a mixed diet including pelagic and demersal prey, with a central role for demersal fishes throughout the whole period. Furthermore, SIAR suggested no major changes in the proportion of pelagic and demersal prey in the diet of adult male <b>South</b> <b>American</b> <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> during the past three decades. Demersal fishes were also relevant prey for juvenile <b>South</b> <b>American</b> <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> during the whole period, but they always consumed a larger proportion of pelagic prey than the adults did. These results suggest no major changes in the diet of male <b>South</b> <b>American</b> <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> during the past three decades in southern Brazil, contrary to what has been reported for other to predators in the regions and for the species in northern Patagonia.

40|$|Whisker {{samples were}} {{collected}} from grey seals from North Rona and from Isle of May in 1997 - 1999, from southern elephant seals from Pensinsular Valdes, Patagonia, from 1998 and 1999 and from <b>South</b> <b>American</b> <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> also from Pensinsular Valdes in 1999. The whiskers were sub-sampled along their length and analysed for stable isotopes of δ(^ 13) C and δ(^ 15) N. There were {{significant differences between the}} two populations of grey seal and between years for each of the populations. Isotopic variations seen along the length of some of the whiskers were greater than could be attributed to background variation, indicating some seasonal variation. Possible prey items were herring, sandeels, some species of flat fish and gadoids. A strong temporal shift in apparent prey choice was seen only for the Isle of May, and the shift over a period of three years diminished the difference between the two populations. This could reflect changing prey choice or prey abundance in the North Sea over this time period. Male and female southern elephant seals showed significant differences in their isotopic values, with the male seals showing three different isotopic clusters that were distinct from one another and from the female seals.

25|$|<b>South</b> <b>American</b> <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> are {{observed}} to make various vocalizations and calls which differ between sexes and ages. Adult males make high-pitched calls during aggressive interactions, barks when establishing territories, growls when interacting with females, and exhalations after antagonistic encounters.

40|$|The {{evolution}} of resource specializations is poorly understood, especially in marine systems. The {{southern elephant seal}} (Mirounga leonina) is {{the largest of the}} phocid seals, sexually dimorphic, and thought to prey predominantly on fish and squid. We collected vibrissae from male and female southern elephant seals, and assessed stable C and N isotope ratios {{along the length of the}} vibrissae. Given that whiskers grow slowly, this sampling strategy reflects any variation in feeding behaviour over a period of time. We found that isotopic variation among females was relatively small, and that the apparent prey choice and trophic level of females was different from that for males. Further, males showed a very broad range of trophic/prey choice positions, grouped into several clusters, and this included isotopic values too low to match a broad range of potential fish and cephalopod prey tested. One of these clusters overlapped with data for <b>South</b> <b>American</b> <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> (Otaria flavescens), which were measured for comparison. Both male southern elephant seals and southern <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> forage over the continental shelf, providing the potential for competition.

5|$|Pinnipeds mostly feed on {{fish and}} cephalopods, {{followed}} by crustaceans and bivalves, and then zooplankton and warm-blooded prey (like sea birds). Most species are generalist feeders, {{but a few}} are specialists. They typically hunt non-schooling fish, slow-moving or immobile invertebrates or endothermic prey when in groups. Solitary foraging species usually exploit coastal waters, bays and rivers. When large schools of fish or squid are available, pinnipeds hunt cooperatively in large groups, locating and herding their prey. Some species, such as California and <b>South</b> <b>American</b> <b>sea</b> <b>lions,</b> may forage with cetaceans and sea birds.|$|R
