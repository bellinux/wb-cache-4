40|$|Abstract Purpose. <b>Skew</b> <b>ray</b> {{ambiguity}} {{is present}} in most videokeratoscopic measurements when azimuthal components of the corneal curvature are not taken into account. There have been some reported studies based on theoretical predictions and measured test surfaces suggesting that <b>skew</b> <b>ray</b> ambiguity is significant for highly deformed corneas or decentered corneal measurements. However, the effect of <b>skew</b> <b>ray</b> ambiguity in ray tracing through videokeratoscopic data has not been studied in depth. Methods. We have evaluated {{the significance of the}} <b>skew</b> <b>ray</b> ambiguity and its effect on the analyzed corneal optics. This has been achieved by devising a procedure in which we compared the corneal wavefront aberrations estimated from 3 D ray tracing with those determined from 2 D (meridional based) estimates of the refractive power. The latter was possible due to recently developed concept of refractive Zernike power polynomials which links the refractive power domain with that of the wavefront. Simulated corneal surfaces as well as data from a range of corneas (from two different Placido disk-based videokeratoscopes) were used to find the limit at which the difference in estimated corneal wavefronts (or the corresponding refractive powers) would have clinical significance (e. g., equivalent to 0. 125 D or more). Results. The inclusion/exclusion of the <b>skew</b> <b>ray</b> in the analyses showed some differences in the results. However, the proposed procedure showed clinically significant differences only for highly deformed corneas and only for large corneal diameters. Conclusions. For the overwhelming majority of surfaces, the <b>skew</b> <b>ray</b> ambiguity is not a clinically significant issue in the analysis of the videokeratoscopic data indicating that the meridional processing such as that encountered in calculation of the refractive power maps is adequate...|$|E

Fiber-optic SPR sensor is easy for miniaturization, so {{it is commonly used}} in the development of portable detection equipment. It can also be used for remote, real-time, and online detection. In this study, a wavelength modulation fiber-optic SPR sensor is designed, and theoretical analysis of optical propagation in the optical fiber is also done. Compared with existing methods, both the transmission of a <b>skew</b> <b>ray</b> and the influence of the chromatic dispersion are discussed. The resonance wavelength is calculated at two different cases, in which the chromatic dispersion in the fiber core is considered. According to the simulation results, a novel multi-channel fiber-optic SPR sensor is likewise designed to avoid defaults aroused by the complicated computation of the <b>skew</b> <b>ray</b> as well as the chromatic dispersion.

A {{theoretical}} framework to formulate and {{solve the problem}} of obtaining the objective refraction of an eye from aberrometric data is presented. Matrix formalism was applied to represent lens power and beam vergences in standard clinical, sphere+cylinder S+C refraction, and to describe the vergence error of a general aberrated <b>skew</b> <b>ray.</b> The vergence error matrix of each ray passing through the pupil is obtained, and the global refractive error is obtained by simple pupil average. The 2 2 vergence error matrix of a <b>skew</b> <b>ray</b> can be decomposed into the sum of two even-symmetric and odd-symmetric contributions. The even symmetric part corresponds to classic S+C refractive errors. The odd component can not be corrected with standard lenses. All odd components have zero mean over pupil, and do not contribute to the global refractive error, which is completely determined by S+C components. The contributions of wavefront Zernike modes to the global vergence error were obtained: The contributions of odd orders are zero, but all even HOA, but spherical aberration, contribute to refractive error. The matrix formulation of power and vergence errors provided a direct, simple way to use aberrometers as objective refractometers.

We showed that the light rays inside the optical fiber trace a polygonal helical path characterized by three invariants that relate successive reflections inside the fiber: the ray path distance, the difference in axial distances, and the difference in the azimuthal angles.

40|$|Abstract—A {{multimode}} {{photonic crystal}} fiber (PCF) fluorom-eter interrogated by a spectrometer is investigated. By adding a glass tip {{at the end}} of the PCF, we found that this fluorometer significantly enhances the fluorescent light collection efficiency (CE).

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} {{a new approach}} to calibrating the spectral-spatial response of a wide-field spectrograph using a fibre etalon comb. Conventional wide-field instruments employed on front-line telescopes are mapped with a grid of diffraction-limited holes cut into a focal plane mask. The aberrated grid pattern in the image plane typically reveals n-symmetric (e. g. pincushion) distortion patterns over the field arising from the optical train. This approach is impractical {{in the presence of a}} dispersing element because the diffraction-limited spots in the focal plane are imaged as an array of overlapping spectra. Instead we propose a compact solution that builds on recent developments in fibre-based Fabry-Perot etalons. We introduce a novel approach to near-field illumination that exploits a 25 cm commercial telescope and the propagation of <b>skew</b> <b>rays</b> in a multimode fibre. The mapping of the optical transfer function across the full field is represented accurately (< 0. 5 % rms residual) by an orthonormal set of Chebyshev moments.

40|$|For {{infrared}} sensors {{located at}} the nose of a missile or a projectile, an age-old problem occurs. A conflict between optical quality and aerodynamic drag exists. A new approach for solving this problem is being developed using gradient refractive index, GRIN, for lens design. The equations for lens design incorporating GRIN are formulated for the special case of spherically symmetrical GRIN. A computer code for designing a GRIN lens and for determining aberrations has been developed. A different program (LENS) calculates lens design and lens performance for the case of homogeneous refractive index. Results of this program provide {{a check on the}} more complex program which includes GRIN. The computed program calculates the spot diagram for both meridianal and <b>skew</b> <b>rays.</b> The spot diagram, which is the intersection of rays with the focal plane, is plotted, and the Oj-j^g and centroid location of the spot diagram are calculated. Also a cumulative energy diagram is obtained from the program. The computer code has been organized to calculate the items enumerated above for either a circular cone for the inside or outside surface of the pointed lens. For homogeneous refractive index, both cases are included in the program discussed in this report. However, for the GRIN case, only the complete program for a lens with a conical surface on the outside is reported here. The alternate case is being developed by a thesis student. Features of the computer program include the following: use of many subroutines for clarity and for easy modification, and use of program structure for easy integration into an optimization code. Sample lens designs and lens performance are presented. The computer code provides the tools for lens design. Considerables additional work is needed for selecting the best lens design.
