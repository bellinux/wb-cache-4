50|$|Cancer {{begins as}} cells that grow uncontrollably, usually {{as a result}} of an {{internal}} change or oncogenic mutations within the cell. Cancer develops and progresses as the microenvironment undergoes dynamic changes. The <b>stromal</b> <b>reaction</b> in cancer is similar to the <b>stromal</b> <b>reaction</b> induced by injury or wound repair: increased ECM and growth factor production and secretion, which consequently cause growth of the tissue. In other words, the body reacts similarly to a cancer as it does to a wound, causing scar-like tissue to be built around the cancer. As such, the surrounding stroma plays a very important role in the progression of cancer. The interaction between cancer cells and surrounding tumor stroma is thus bidirectional, and the mutual cellular support allows for the progression of the malignancy.|$|E

The tumor microenvironment of pancreatic cancer harbors a wide spectrum of cell types and a complex network of mechanisms which all serve to promote tumor progression. It is clear that the symbiotic relationship between pancreatic cancer cells and stellate cells is the chief factor creating this unique tumor milieu. Pancreatic stellate cells play critical roles in evasion of cancer cell apoptosis, invasion and metastases, angiogenesis, and promotion of an immunosuppressive environment, all key hallmarks of malignancy. Existing treatments for pancreatic cancer focus on targeting the cancer cells rather than the whole tumor, of which cancer cells represent a small proportion.

40|$|Human carcinomas {{frequently}} exhibit significant <b>stromal</b> <b>reactions</b> such as {{the so-called}} “desmoplastic stroma” or “reactive stroma”, which is characterised by the existence {{of large numbers of}} stromal cells and extracellular matrix proteins. Carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which are rich in activated fibroblast populations exemplified by myofibroblasts, are among the predominant cell types present within the tumour-associated stroma. Increased numbers of stromal myofibroblasts are often associated with high-grade malignancies with poor prognoses in humans. CAF myofibroblasts possess abilities to promote primary tumour development, growth and progression by stimulating the processes of neoangiogenesis as well as tumour cell proliferation, survival, migration and invasion. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that CAFs serve as a niche supporting the metastatic colonisation of disseminated carcinoma cells in distant organs. Their contribution to primary and secondary malignancies makes these fibroblasts a potential therapeutic target and they also appear to be relevant to the development of drug resistance and tumour recurrence.

40|$|Background. Recent {{studies have}} shown that <b>stromal</b> <b>reaction</b> in cancer has a more {{important}} diagnostic and prognostic significance than previously thought. CD 34 -positive stromal cells and myofibroblasts may {{play an important role in}} host response to invasive cancer. The aim of our studies was therefore to analyze the distribution and immunohistochemical phenotype of stromal cells in epithelial hyperplastic lesions (EHL) and squamous carcinoma (SC) of the larynx, and to establish their diagnostic and prognostic significance. Methods. We investigated samples of 62 resected larynxes with SC, 50 laryngeal biopsies of EHL and SC, and 5 samples of normal laryngeal mucosa. Immunohistochemistry was performed using antibodies against vimentin, a-smooth muscle actin (SMA), desmin, CD 34 and leucocyte common antigen (LCA). Results. The stroma of normal laryngeal mucosa and EHL contained scattered CD 34 -positive cells, but there were no SMApositive myofibroblasts. In contrast, the stroma of SC contained SMA-positive cells but there were no CD 34 -positive stromal cells. We observed two patterns of <b>stromal</b> <b>reaction</b> in SC: one was characterised by a marked proliferation of myofibroblasts and desmoplasia, with scarce lymphocytic infiltration; this pattern tended to be associated with well or moderately differentiated SC. The other was characterised by few myofibroblasts, weak desmoplasia, and dense lymphocytic infiltration; the latter pattern tended to be associated with moderately or poorly differentiated SC. Conclusions. Our studies show that disappearance of CD 34 positive cells and appearance of SMA-positive myofibroblasts in the stroma is associated with transformation of laryngeal EHL to SC. This pattern of <b>stromal</b> <b>reaction</b> should be regarded as an additional marker of invasion. Our results also suggest that characteristics of <b>stromal</b> <b>reaction</b> in SC could be of prognostic significance. </p...|$|E

40|$|Stromal cells, {{together}} with extracellular matrix components, provide a tumor microenvironment that is pivotal for cancer cell growth and progression. In our previous study using a conditional {{transgenic mouse model}} of breast cancer, the overproduction of hyaluronan, a major extracellular constituent, accelerated tumor angiogenesis through stromal cell recruitment. This finding led us to investigate the role of hyaluronan in the lymphatic vessel system. Here, {{we have found that}} microenvironmental hyaluronan promoted tumor lymphangiogenesis concurrently with the formation of stromal structures. Additionally, lymphatic vessels frequently penetrated and accumulated into stromal compartments, and up-regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor-C and -D was detected at tumor-stromal interfaces. To assess the contribution of stromal cells to lymphangiogenesis in vivo, we established tumor-associated fibroblasts from hyaluronan-overproducing mammary tumors and implanted them {{together with}} carcinoma cells from control tumors or MCF- 7 human breast carcinoma cells in nude mice. Carcinoma cells grew rapidly in association with marked <b>stromal</b> <b>reactions</b> and lymphangiogenesis.

In basal cell carcinoma, previous findings on stromelysin- 3 have been inconclusive in this respect. Our study was undertaken to determine the pattern of stromelysin- 3 production in relation to different histologic subtypes and <b>stromal</b> <b>reactions</b> in basal cell carcinoma. By in situ hybridization, stromelysin- 3 mRNA was detected in stromal fibroblastic cells in 51 / 56 samples. Furthermore, there was a significant correlation between strong signal for stromelysin- 3 mRNA and infiltrative tumor growth. In all tumors, there was ongoing collagen synthesis as shown by a signal for procollagen I mRNA; this signal co-localized with stromelysin- 3 around tumor nests. Our findings suggest a link between stromelysin- 3 and fibrotic stromal response, which prompted us to evaluate the expression of stromelysin- 3 in other fibrotic skin tumors. Interestingly, stromelysin- 3, co-localizing with procollagen I mRNA, was consistently expressed in lesional cells in dermatofibromas (19 / 19), but not in dermatofibrosarcomas (0 / 7). Thus, our results indicate that in addition to being a marker for malignant disease, stromelysin- 3 {{is produced}} by fibroblastic cells associated with benign fibrosis.

Here, we report {{the design of a}} vector expressing the soluble form of VEGF receptor- 2 (sVEGFR 2) driven by a hypoxia-responsive element (HRE) -regulated promoter. To enable in vivo imaging by infrared visualization, mCherry and IFP 1. 4 coding sequences were built into the vector. Plasmid construction was validated through transfection into embryonic human kidney HEK 293 and murine B 16 F 10 melanoma cells. sVEGFR 2 was expressed in hypoxic conditions only, confirming that the gene was regulated by the HRE promoter. sVEGFR 2 was found to bind efficiently and specifically to murine and human VEGF-A, reducing the growth of tumor and endothelial cells as well as impacting angiogenesis in vitro. The hypoxia-conditioned sVEGFR 2 expression was shown to be functional in vivo: Tumor angiogenesis was inhibited and, on stable transfection of B 16 F 10 melanoma cells, tumor growth was reduced. Enhanced expression of sVEGFR 2 was accompanied by a modulation in levels of VEGF-A. The resulting balance reflected the effect on tumor growth and on control of angiogenesis. A concomitant increase of intratumor oxygen tension also suggested an influence on vessel normalization.

Since growing tumors recruit local cells, as well as supplemental cells from the circulation, such as fibroblasts and endothelial precursors, the question arises if {{it would be possible to}} access circulating stromal cells to modify the tumor microenvironment for therapeutic benefits.

Several reports have demonstrated that MSC can incorporate into sites of wound healing and tissue repair, due to active tissue remodeling and local paracrine factors, and given the similarity between wound healing and the carcinoma induced stromal response one can hypothesize that MSC have the potential to be recruited to sites of tumor development. In addition, gene-modified MSC could be used as cellular vehicles to deliver gene products into tumors. My results indicate that MSC home to and participate in tumor stroma formation in ovarian tumor xenografts in mice. Additionally, once homed to tumor beds, MSC proliferate rapidly and integrate.

Material and methods: All consecutive PTMC cases, sized ≥ 5 mm, registered at the Department of Pathology, Tîrgu-Mureș Emergency County Hospital from January 2002 to December 2013 were re-evaluated. The following histological features were noted: the multifocality, the extrathyroidal extension, the histologic variant, the tumor’s border (well circumscribed versus infiltrative), the PTC nuclear features (well developed versus subtle), the tumor associated <b>stromal</b> <b>reaction</b> (fibrosis/desmoplasia/sclerosis versus none of these changes), the presence of “plump pink” cells, psammoma bodies, intratumoral lymphocytic infiltrate, cystic change, back-to-back arrangement, intratumoral multinucleated giant cells and lymph node involvement. Results: Our study included 72 PTMC cases, summing up to a total of 80 PTMC foci. We have shown that extrathyroidal extension is significantly associated with the presence of “plump pink”cells (p= 0. 0019), well developed nuclear features of PTC (p= 0. 018) and tumor associated <b>stromal</b> <b>reaction</b> (fibrosis/dezmoplazia/sclerosis) (p< 0. 0001).

Conclusion: Our results pointed out the importance of a distinct set of morphological microscopical parameters, predictive for extrathyroidal extension in PTMC cases (“plump pink” cells, well developed PTC nuclear features, tumor associated <b>stromal</b> <b>reaction,</b> infiltrative tumor borders and conventional PTC histology). All these parameters are important to be mentioned in the histopathological reports, as they might be associated with a more aggressive biological behaviour...|$|E

Results were compared with a series of 19 nonaggressive BCC. The aggressive BCC showed discontinuous staining for laminin and type IV collagen, a marked myofibroblastic response, and increased stromal fibronectin. Conversely, the nonaggressive BCC showed a continuous basement membrane and a total lack of staining for fibronectin and myofibroblastic markers in all but three cases. This report suggests that a combined analysis of {{extracellular matrix}} components and myofibroblastic markers may be useful for evaluating the clinical behavior including the metastatic capability of aggressive BCC...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Needle core biopsy, {{often in}} {{conjunction}} with ultrasonic or stereotactic guided techniques, is frequently used to diagnose breast carcinoma in women. Confocal scanning laser microscopy (CSLM) is a technology that provides real-time digital images of tissues with cellular resolution. This paper reports the progress in developing techniques to rapidly screen needle core breast biopsy and surgical specimens {{at the point of}} care. CSLM requires minimal tissue processing and has the potential to reduce the time from excision to diagnosis. Following imaging, specimens can still be submitted for standard histopathological preparation. Methods Needle core breast specimens from 49 patients were imaged at the time of biopsy. These lesions had been characterized under the Breast Imaging Reporting And Data System (BI-RADS) as category 3, 4 or 5. The core biopsies were imaged with the CSLM before fixation. Samples were treated with 5 % citric acid and glycerin USP to enhance nuclear visibility in the reflectance confocal images. Immediately following imaging, the specimens were fixed in buffered formalin and submitted for histological processing and pathological diagnosis. CSLM images were then compared to the standard histology. Results The pathologic diagnoses by standard histology were 7 invasive ductal carcinomas, 2 invasive lobular carcinomas, 3 ductal carcinomas in-situ (CIS), 21 fibrocystic changes/proliferative conditions, 9 fibroadenomas, and 5 other/benign; two were excluded due to imaging difficulties. Morphologic and cellular features of benign and cancerous lesions were identified in the confocal images and were comparable to standard histologic sections of the same tissue. Conclusion CSLM is a technique with the potential to screen needle core biopsy specimens in real-time. The confocal images contained sufficient information to identify <b>stromal</b> <b>reactions</b> such as fibrosis and cellular proliferations such as intra-ductal and infiltrating carcinoma, and were comparable to standard histologic sections of the same tissue. Morphologic and cellular features of benign and cancerous lesions were identified in the confocal images. Additional studies are needed to 1.) establish correlation of the confocal and traditional histologic images for the various diseases of the breast; 2.) validate diagnostic use of CSLM and; 3.) further define features of borderline lesions such as well-differentiated ductal CIS vs. atypical hyperplasia. </p...|$|R

The purpose of the present work was to determine whether the products of a newly described LO-like gene (LOXL) that encodes a close homolog of LO, the LO-like (LOL) protein, is associated with extracellular matrix remodeling during fibrotic disorders. Specific antibody against LOL identified proteins of approximately 30, 42, 52 and 68 kd in various cells and in bovine aorta. These proteins were immunochemically distinct from the recombinant LO expressed by fibroblasts and from the bovine aorta LO. The LO gene (LOX) and LOXL were transiently up-regulated at early stages of liver granuloma development in Schistosoma mansoni-infected mice, although the peak of LOL mRNA synthesis preceded that of LO. LOL protein and LO were colocalized at sites of fibrogenesis in human lung fibrosis and in the <b>stromal</b> <b>reaction</b> of bronchiolo-alveolar carcinomas and of in situ ductal breast tumors. In conclusion, the LOL protein was identified as a secreted protein and localized in the extracellular matrix in active fibrotic diseases and in the early <b>stromal</b> <b>reaction</b> of breast cancer.

40|$|A {{very special}} {{connective}} tissue surrounds and interweaves solid tumors, the tumor stroma. Initially thought to {{only have a}} passive role, there is now more and more evidence accumulating that the tumor stroma plays an active function {{in the process of}} tumor progression as well as tumor initiation. Activated stromal cells express pro-proliferative paracrine signals to the epithelial cells, stimulate angiogenesis and can even show loss of tumor suppressor genes. Therefore, understanding the complex crosstalk between the epithelium and the tumor stroma might reveal novel therapeutic targets. Tenascin-C is known to be specifically expressed in the stroma of a variety of tumors triggering different <b>stromal</b> <b>reactions</b> required for tumorigenesis such as angiogenesis. We found in the stroma of mouse mammary tumors the induction of a second member of the tenascin family, tenascin-W. Moreover, we detected human tenascin-W in different human neoplasms, and could correlate its expression in breast cancers with tumor grade. Tenascin-W is enriched in low-grade breast cancers whereas the presence of tenascin-C does not correlate with tumor grade. Functionally, we could show that presence of tenascin-W does influence the cellular behavior of cancer cells. Fibroblasts adhere on tenascin-W in a β 1 -integrin-dependent way, and cancer cell migration towards fibronectin is stimulated by addition of tenascin-W. In order to evaluate the significance of tenascin-W to act as tumor marker, we established a sensitive sandwich-ELISA to measure serum tenascin-W levels. By screening sera of healthy volunteers and sera from cancer patients, we could detect elevated serum tenascin-W levels in non-metastatic colorectal and non-metastatic breast cancer patients. However, not all cancer patients did show this increase. Furthermore, we found high tenascin-W expression in a large fraction of colorectal cancer extracts, but complete absence in normal colon mucosae. This suggests that tenascin-W is a better tumor marker for colorectal cancer than tenascin-C, which is also expressed in the normal colon mucosa. These observations warrant a follow-up study to evaluate the potential diagnostic or prognostic relevance of tenascin-W in colorectal cancer. Glioblastomas are very aggressive human cancers. We found that glioblastomas frequently harbor amplifications at the Notch 2 locus and express high levels of Notch 2 protein, which coincided with the presence of tenascin-C, an established prognostic marker for glioblastomas. A conserved potential RBPJk binding motif was found in the tenascin-C promoter sequence, and by luciferase assays we could identify tenascin-C as a new RBPJkdependent Notch- 2 target. Furthermore, we could induce endogenous tenascin-C by transfecting fibroblasts with the intracellular Notch 2 domain. These data imply a novel oncogenic function of Notch 2 by inducing tenascin-C, a molecule enhancing cancer cell motility...|$|R
