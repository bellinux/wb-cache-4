40|$|In this article, we briefly {{review the}} {{aetiology}} {{and symptoms of}} nasal <b>septal</b> <b>perforations,</b> and focus on a surgical reconstruction technique of which the results were retrospectively studied. The technique described, involves the interposition of a connective tissue graft between differently designed local mucoperichondrial and/or mucoperiosteal flaps {{on each side of}} the perforation, thereby preventing opposing suture lines. On one side a rotation/advancement flap is derived from the septum, the nasal floor and lateral nasal wall while in the opposite nasal passage, bipedicled flaps from the septum and nasal floor and/or from the superior septum and under-surface of the upper lateral cartilage are created. Of the 43 patients included in this study, 40 had their perforation permanently closed, while three experienced a non-symptomatic recurrence. We conclude that the use of differently designed, mucoperichondrial or mucoperiosteal bilateral intranasal flaps with non-opposing suture lines, and interposition of Alloderm or autogenous connective tissue with cartilage, especially with adequate exposure through an external approach, can lead to excellent results in the majority of case...|$|R
5|$|Frequent nosebleeds can be {{prevented}} in part by keeping the nostrils moist, and by applying saline solution, estrogen-containing creams or tranexamic acid; these have few side effects and may have a small degree of benefit. A number of additional modalities {{has been used to}} prevent recurrent bleeding if simple measures are unsuccessful. Medical therapies include oral tranexamic acid and estrogen; the evidence for these is relatively limited, and estrogen is poorly tolerated by men and possibly carries risks of cancer and heart disease in women past the menopause. Nasal coagulation and cauterization may reduce the bleeding from telangiectasias, and is recommended before surgery is considered. However, it is highly recommended to use the least heat and time to prevent <b>septal</b> <b>perforations</b> and excessive trauma to the nasal mucosa that are already susceptible to bleeding. Sclerotherapy is another option to manage the bleeding. This process involves injecting a small amount of an aerated irritant (detergent such as sodium tetradecyl sulfate) directly into the telangiectasias. The detergent causes the vessel to collapse and harden, resulting in scar tissue residue. This is the same procedure used to treat varicose veins and similar disorders.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the improvement of nasal flow and the fall of nasal resistance in 50 patients that underwent rhinoseptoplasty in our department and discuss the relative importance of valvular and septal deformities in nasal airway obstruction. Fifty consecutive patients underwent rhinoseptoplasty to improve nasal obstruction caused by severe septal deviation, external or internal valvular incompetence, or any combination of the three. We excluded patients with minor <b>septal</b> curvatures, <b>septal</b> <b>perforations,</b> or turbinate hypertrophy. Preoperative and postoperative rhinomanometry was performed on all 50 patients. In all 50 patients, septal and/or valvular surgery lowered nasal resistance in 90 % of cases. Septoplasty alone with medial and basal osteotomies did not improve nasal flow (p < 0. 4), whereas the correction of valvular obstruction alone increased nasal airflow in a statistically significant way (p < 0. 0001). Moreover, patients with both valvular incompetence and septal deviation represented the group in which the greatest preoperative obstruction and the greatest postoperative improvement occurred. Nasal valvular function should be assessed with rhinomanometry in all preoperative rhinoplasty patients with airway obstruction. In many cases, valvular effects may surpass septal deviation as the primary cause of nasal airflow obstruction...|$|R
50|$|For {{those that}} are {{determined}} to be medically cleared for surgery, the anatomical location {{and size of the}} perforation must be determined. This is often done with a combination of a CT scan of the sinuses without contrast and an endoscopic evaluation by an Ear Nose and Throat doctor. Once dimensions are obtained the surgeon will decide if it is possible to close the perforation. Multiple approaches to access the septum have been described in the literature. While sublabial and midfacial degloving approaches have been described, the most popular today is the rhinoplasty approach. This can include both open and closed methods. The open method results in a scar on the columella, however, it allows for more visibility to the surgeon. The closed method utilizes an incision all {{on the inside of the}} nose. The concept behind closure includes bringing together the edges of mucosa on each side of the perforation with minimal tension. An interposition graft is also often used. The interposition graft provides extended stability and also structure to the area of the perforation. Classically, a graft from the scalp utilizing temporalis fascia was used. Kridel, et. al., first described the usage of acellular dermis so that no further incisions are required; they reported an excellent closure rate of over 90%. Overall perforation closure rates are variable and often determined by the skill of the surgeon and technique used. Often surgeons who claim a high rate of closure choose perforations that are easier to close. An open rhinoplasty approach also allows for better access to the nose to repair any concurrent nasal deformities, such as saddle nose deformity, that occur with a <b>septal</b> <b>perforation.</b>|$|E

We wanted {{to establish the}} etiology and size of nasal septal perforations {{in an attempt to}} implement preventive measures. Methods This is an open, prospective clinical study of patients seen at our hospital from 1981 to 2005. The clinical data of size, gender and etiology have been recorded consecutively. Results One hundred and ninety seven patients (100 male, 97 female) were evaluated. Between 1981 and 1995 nasal <b>septal</b> <b>perforation</b> was caused by surgery in 40 of 102 (39. 2 %). In the period 1995 to and inclusive of 2005 this percentage decreased as septal resection has been replaced by septo/septorhinoplasty. The latter was the cause for <b>septal</b> <b>perforation</b> in 14. 7 % in the last period. Nasal steroid and decongestive sprays have emerged as an important cause (28. 4 %) during the last ten years particularly in females.

The {{aim of this study}} is to review our experience in treating large nasal perforations using a closed approach with endoscopic assistance, undertaking a 3 -layer reconstruction of the septum. We reviewed 14 consecutive patients with large (2 - 4 cm) nasal <b>septal</b> <b>perforations,</b> who were treated using an endonasal/endoscope-assisted approach. In these cases, the mucosal defect was reconstructed through a horizontal advancement of the bipedicled mucoperichondrial flaps and sutured using absorbable sutures.

40|$|Background Nasal packing is {{routinely}} used after septoplasty {{because it is}} believed to decrease risk of postoperative bleeding, hematomas, and adhesions. Multiple studies have shown, however, that there are numerous complications associated with nasal packing. The purpose of this work was to perform a meta-analysis on the existing literature to evaluate the role of nasal packing after septoplasty. Methods Two independent reviewers conducted a literature search using EMBASE, OVID, Medline, PubMed, Google scholar, Cochrane Library, and reference list review from 1966 to August 2010 to identify studies assessing nasal packing after septoplasty. All papers were reviewed for study design, results, and were assigned an Oxford level of evidence grade, Detsky score, and Methodological Index for Nonrandomized Studies (MINORS) score. Results Sixteen papers were identified that met the inclusion criteria. Eleven papers were randomized control trials, 3 were prospective, and 2 were retrospective studies. Nasal packing did not show benefit in reducing postoperative bleeding, hematomas, <b>septal</b> <b>perforations,</b> adhesions, or residual deviated nasal septum. There was, however, an increase in postoperative infections. Two studies using fibrin products as nasal packing showed a decreased bleeding rate.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Recent {{reports have}} shown that, {{although}} rare, findings of mucosal ulcers and perforations {{of the nasal}} septum in some cases {{may be associated with}} the use of topical nasal glucocorticosteroids (GCS). It can been speculated that, a reduction in septal mucosal blood flow causing ischemia may eventually induce <b>septal</b> <b>perforations.</b> AIM: To evaluate whether a single dose of a potent nasal GCS given in a clinically recommended dose may acutely reduce the mucosal blood flow on the nasal septum. METHODS: Six healthy subjects received in a randomised double blind placebo controlled crossover procedure one dose of 64 micrograms budesonide aqueous nasal spray (Rhinocort aqua, AstraZeneca R&D, Lund, Sweden) and placebo. One dose was delivered into each nasal cavity by means of a pump spray. As a positive control 140 micrograms of xylometazoline (Nezeril, AstraZeneca R&D, Lund, Sweden) was sprayed in the same way, but in an open fashion. A wash-out period of at least 3 days followed each session. Blood flow was measured on the nasal septum with Laser Doppler flowmetry up to 20 min after administration. RESULTS: Budesonide did not affect the nasal septal mucosal blood flow as compared to placebo, but xylometazoline reduced the septal mucosal blood flow by 60. 9 +/- 7. 1 % measured from baseline values.
