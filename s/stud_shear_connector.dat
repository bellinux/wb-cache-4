In this work, nonlinear finite element model has been developed to simulate the failure process of the shear connector under shear loading. The stress distribution, deformation, crack propagation and failure mode were analyzed. The material nonlinearities of rubber, headed stud, concrete were considered in the material model. The rubber was assumed as a perfect material with no defect, and a modified reduced polynomial form of strain energy including an energy limiter and a new constant was introduced into the user material subroutine VUANISOHYPER-INV of ABAQUS software. Damaged plasticity model was used to model the concrete material. A tri-linear elastic-plastic curve was used in stud material model. Comparing the results obtained from the finite element analysis with those from push-out test, good agreement is highlighted in the capacity, ductility and failure mode of rubber-sleeved headed <b>stud</b> <b>shear</b> <b>connector...</b>|$|E
40|$|Push-out {{shear test}} of <b>stud</b> <b>shear</b> <b>connector</b> specimens, {{subjected}} to sustained shear and compression forces in advance, were conducted {{and the influence}} of the sustained forces on shear force-slip displacement relationship was examined. Slip displacement drastically increased due to sustained shear force for 30 days, which corresponds to 30 % and 60 % of shear capacity. However, residual slip displacement after unloading seemed to be uniquely governed by the experienced maximum slip displacement even under sustained shear force. The influence of instantaneous and sustained compression forces corresponding to 30 % and 45 % of compression capacity of concrete blocks was also examined on shear force-slip relationships. It was clarified that compression force to concrete block influenced on the shape of hysteresis curves, in addition to increase residual slip displacement of the stud connector, regardless of the time duration of applied compression force...|$|E

40|$|In this study, {{the effect}} of {{corrosion}} on the static behavior of stud shear connectors was investigated. An innovative test setup for single stud shear connectors was designed and established. Two series of specimens having different stud diameters were fabricated and tested.

Static loading tests were then performed to obtain the load-slip curves and ultimate strengths of the corroded test specimens. The actual corrosion rates were measured from the studs obtained from the tested specimens. The test results were compared with the push out test specimens having similar corrosion rates.

40|$|When {{construction}} elements made {{of steel}} and concrete are connected this is called composite construction which has been investigated very intensely since 1930. The greatest steps {{in the development of}} this type of construction were made when the headed <b>stud</b> <b>shear</b> <b>connector</b> was introduced, the slim floors were launched and the high-strength materials were utilized. The coaction of high-strength steel and high-strength concrete in composite girders with solid slabs for building construction and the impact on the bearing- and the deformation-behaviour are researched in this thesis based on tests and numerical calculations. In addition to that the design of a new single push-out test allowed the systematic investigation of the behaviour of one single <b>stud</b> <b>shear</b> <b>connector</b> under pure shear loading. The thesis is structured as follows: * Tests with nine composite girders under positive and negative moments for the determination of the ultimate bearing capacity and ductility. * Push-out tests with 62 specimens in order to describe the bearing- and the deformation-behaviour of headed studs in high-strength concrete. * Proposal of a new design method for headed studs in high-strength concrete which allows for a resistance of the welded collar and a resistance of the stud’s shank. * Parametric study to find ways to increase the ductility of headed studs in high-strength concrete. * Critical interpretation of the Standard push-out test as given in Eurocode 4 based on numerical studies. * Development of a procedure to correct the plastic design with regard to the stress-strain distributions of the high-strength materials. * Systematic investigation of the longitudinal shear stress distribution subjected to stiffness- and loading-conditions. * Formulation of new limits for the minimum degree of longitudinal shear connection depending on the span length, the loading and the cross section with regard to the low ductility of the connectors in high-strength concrete. Based on the new perceptions practical design rules are proposed, which allow an economic use of high-strength materials in composite construction. Promising applications are highly loaded components in industrial and bridge constructions. Future investigations regarding high-strength materials in composite structures should include the bearing behaviour of shear connectors under dynamic loads, the further development of numerical methods to simulate the material behaviour of the concrete and the bearing behaviour of partially or totally concrete encased steel members...|$|E
40|$|Almost all <b>stud</b> <b>shear</b> <b>connectors</b> in {{composite}} steel-concrete bridge beams {{are subjected}} to bi-directional cyclic loading at some stage during the fatigue life of the structure. In the assessment of an existing structure, it is desirable to predict the extent of fatigue damage experienced by the <b>stud</b> <b>shear</b> <b>connectors</b> as accurately as possible as this component of the structure can not be visually inspected. However, very {{little research has been}} carried out to quantify the fatigue behaviour of <b>stud</b> <b>shear</b> <b>connectors</b> subjected to bi-directional cyclic loading. This paper presents a new push-pull specimen that was developed to provide {{a better understanding of the}} bidirectional cyclic fatigue behaviour of <b>stud</b> <b>shear</b> <b>connectors.</b> The tests confirmed that for a given range of load, the fatigue life of connectors subjected to bi-directional cyclic loading is longer than those subjected to unidirectional loads only, and that the strength and stiffness of the connectors reduce immediately upon cyclic loading and continues to do so throughout the fatigue life. It was also shown that the rate of increase in slip per cycle is constant over most of the fatigue life with a rapid increase near the end so that, if monitored, can be used to provide adequate warning of failure.

H 577 P CEE 2017 Zhaoxxxii, 329 pages :color illustrationsHybrid fibre-reinforced polymer (FRP) -concrete-steel double-skin tubular members (DSTMs) are a {{new form}} of hybrid members {{developed}} at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU). A hybrid DSTM consists of an outer tube made of FRP and an inner tube made of steel, with the space between them filled with concrete. The existing studies on hybrid DSTMs have been mainly focused on their use as compression members, with only a very limited number of studies on their use as flexural members [i. e., hybrid double-skin tubular beams (DSTBs) ]. The limited existing studies on DSTBs have generally been limited to the testing of small-scale specimens without <b>shear</b> <b>connectors.</b> Against this background, this thesis presents a systematical study, both experimentally and theoretically, aimed at the development of an in-depth understanding of the structural behaviour of large-scale DSTBs with headed <b>stud</b> <b>shear</b> <b>connectors.</b> The research project mainly consisted of two parts: the first part was on the behaviour and modelling of headed <b>stud</b> <b>shear</b> <b>connectors</b> in hybrid DSTBs and the second part was on the behaviour and modelling of large-scale hybrid DSTBs with headed <b>stud</b> <b>shear</b> <b>connectors.</b> In the first part, the behaviour of headed <b>stud</b> <b>shear</b> <b>connectors</b> was investigated experimentally using a modified push-out test set-up. A three-dimensional (3 D) finite element (FE) approach using ABAQUS was developed to predict the behaviour of headed <b>stud</b> <b>shear</b> <b>connectors.</b> The main advantage of the proposed FE approach over existing approaches lies in the use of a reliable constitutive model for confined concrete under a general state of multiaxial stresses. The effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed FE approach were demonstrated by comparing its predictions with the test results. A parametric study was then carried out using the verified FE approach to clarify the effects of various parameters on the behaviour of headed <b>stud</b> <b>shear</b> <b>connectors.</b> Based on the parametric study, new equations for the load-slip behaviour of headed <b>stud</b> <b>shear</b> <b>connectors</b> were proposed. In the second part, four large-scale hybrid DSTBs with headed <b>stud</b> <b>shear</b> <b>connectors</b> under three-point/four-point bending were first tested. Four different cross-sectional configurations, including a DSTB/FRP-reinforced deck unit, were included in the tests. A 3 D FE approach with ABAQUS/Explicit was then proposed for the modelling of hybrid DSTBs, in which the relative slips between the concrete and the steel tube were duly considered. The bond mechanisms in hybrid DSTBs were investigated using the FE approach to clarify the effects of key parameters. The FE approach was shown to be able to accurately predict both the global load-deflection response and the local relative slips between steel and concrete in hybrid DSTBs. In addition, a force-based fibre-section beam/column element model, which is capable of accounting for the relative slips between the concrete and the steel tube, was developed to model hybrid DSTBs. The accuracy of the beam/column element model was demonstrated to be comparable to that of the 3 D FE approach but the former is much more computationally efficient than the latter.

40|$|Composite action {{between the}} {{concrete}} slab and steel beam {{in a building}} frame is typically achieved by using headed <b>stud</b> <b>shear</b> <b>connectors</b> that are welded to the top flange of the steel beam to produce robust shear connection, but their demolition necessarily is associated with much waste and uses considerable energy. Moreover, the slab is usually cast in situ onto profiled steel decking with conventional reinforcement placed on site, which is time consuming and labour intensive and which can increase the construction costs considerably. This paper describes the results of three push-out tests conducted to determine the load-slip behaviour of deconstructable bolted <b>shear</b> <b>connectors</b> for precast concrete slabs in a configuration {{which can be used}} in composite beams and joints.

In some structures, however, headed studs could be subjected to huge tensile loading during life-span of structures. In this paper, the pull-out behaviour of <b>stud</b> <b>shear</b> <b>connector</b> is studied using both experimental and numerical methods. In experimental study, a standard pull-out test procedure was proposed and twelve full-scale specimens were manufactured and tested to determine pull-out load-displacement curves. Depending on the stud heights, all specimens were divided into four groups with 3 specimens in each group. In each group, two specimens were carried out under a monotonic loading and one was conducted subjected to a repeated loading pattern. Two kinds of failure mode, concrete cone failure and stud shank failure, were observed in these tests. The resulting monotonic load-displacement mechanism is studied as a 3 D problem using finite element analysis software, DIANA. The FEA results are found in good agreement with the test results.

The shear connectors provides the enhancement as established in current design codes. In this paper, the shear connection mechanism was proposed using high strength bolted shear connector to provide composite action between concrete and the steel section. The conventional headed <b>stud</b> <b>shear</b> <b>connector</b> was eliminated since Cold-formed steel (CFS) was used and welding was not practically possible due to thinness nature of the CFS section. Therefore, in this study investigation was carried out on the strength capacity, ductility and the ultimate flexural capacity of the proposed high strength bolted shear connector and the composite beam specimens respectively. Four push-out and two full-scale composite beam specimens were fabricated using high strength M 16 bolted shear connector of Grade 8. 8 connected to the top flanges of the CFS I-section and tested to failure using push-out and four-point bending tests respectively. The results show that ultimate load and ultimate moment capacities of the proposed system were significantly improved by using the proposed connectors.

In conclusion, compared results proved that the ultimate moment capacity of the proposed composite beams can be estimated efficiently by using the constitutive laws as prescribed by Eurocodes and British standards...|$|E

A finite element analysis program was developed which allowed for the interaction between the tensile and compressive failure of concrete and hence predicted the variation in the bearing strength of concrete prisms of varying size and with varying amounts of lateral restraint, when subjected to concentrated loads. A combination of-theoretical and empirical analyses was used to determine the load at which the stud broke, the strength of concrete prisms which were subjected to patch loads of varying size and eccentricity and hence the strength of concrete slabs, the effect of lateral forces and transverse reinforcement on the strength of the stud and the slab, the-strength of shear connections in which the reinforcement is looped around the stud and the load-slip curve for a <b>stud</b> <b>shear</b> connection...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation of}} the ultimate strength and behaviour of {{a new type of}} composite beam called CSCC beam (Confined Steel Concrete Composite Beam) is a concrete beam shuttered with cold formed steel sheet which acts as a composite beam by means of <b>shear</b> <b>connectors</b> and bracings. <b>Stud</b> <b>shear</b> <b>connectors</b> are used to take up the bond between sheet and concrete. The passive confinement by the cold formed sheet in the sides and bottom influences the strength and ductility of the system. These beams are provides very good confinement of concrete. Totally eight CSCC beams are tested and the entire behaviour of the beams are monitored to predict the physical response of the beams under three different types loading such as pure bending, pure torsion and combined bending and torsion. Two point loading was obtained for pure bending. The deformation criteria (deflection, moment and flexural rigidity) are also included in the investigation throughout the entire load history experimentally. The results obtained by the experimental values which are found to be in good agreement. Keywords—composite beams; pure bending 1...|$|R
40|$|Headed stud {{are quite}} popular type of <b>shear</b> <b>connector</b> {{that is often}} used in {{composite}} structure. <b>Shear</b> <b>connectors</b> were used to resist longitudinal shear forces on the surfaces between steel and concrete. An accurate non-linear finite element model of the push-out test has been developed to investigate the capacity of large <b>stud</b> <b>shear</b> <b>connectors</b> (25 mm and above) and the failure mode. The main objective {{of this study is}} to discover the effect of changes in stud diameter affect the shear resistance and the failure model on headed stud. There were four model in this analysis which designated as PT 1, PT 2, PT 3, PT 4 and PT 5 with stud diameter size 22 mm, 25 mm, 27 mm, 29 mm and 30 mm respectively. The load per stud for PT 1, PT 2, PT 3, PT 4 and PT 5 were 103. 57 kN, 133. 08 kN, 162. 47 kN, 195. 07 kN and 226. 44 kN respectively. Based on the FEA result, the larger size stud diameter, will produce higher shear resistance.

40|$|The use of {{composite}} beam in buildings has {{known to be}} more economical compared to bare steel beams with hot-rolled steel section, as the composite action between steel and concrete results in significant savings in steel weight and reduce the beam depth. However, the use of {{composite beam}} with cold-formed steel of lipped C-channel {{is yet to be}} established as the structural behavior of such beam is not well understood. This study presents and discusses the behavior of composite beam with cold formed steel section and innovative <b>shear</b> <b>connectors.</b> The composite beam comprises two cold formed steel of lipped C-sections oriented back to back to form I-steel beam and perpendicular metal decking concrete slab. Three types of bracket <b>shear</b> <b>connectors</b> namely single bracket (SBSC), double bracket (DBSC) and hot rolled plate (HPSC) <b>shear</b> <b>connectors</b> were developed and used; the proposed <b>shear</b> <b>connectors</b> were fixed to the web of steel beam by bolts. In addition, headed <b>stud</b> (HSSC) <b>shear</b> <b>connector</b> welded to the top flange of cold formed steel beam was also investigated. Push tests in accordance with Eurocode 4 were carried out to determine the strength capacity and ductility of the proposed <b>shear</b> <b>connectors.</b> Sequentially, full-scale beam tests were conducted to investigate the actual behavior of the composite beam with the proposed <b>shear</b> <b>connectors.</b> The length of full-scale specimen between supports is 4000 mm. Theoretical validation for the experimental results was performed based on the plastic analysis of composite beam. The experimental results of push tests showed very good strength with extreme deformation capacity for all bracket <b>shear</b> <b>connectors</b> suggesting that they are strong and ductile enough to provide composite action between steel beam and concrete slab. Also, it was observed that strength capacity of <b>shear</b> <b>connector</b> increases as the thickness of steel beam increases. For headed <b>stud</b> <b>shear</b> <b>connectors,</b> the <b>stud</b> possess strength capacity as high as its predicted strength. The results of full-scale beam tests showed very good agreement as compared to theoretical values that predicted based on push test results. The bending resistance and stiffness of the composite beams were improved up to 170 % and 270 % respectively as compared to non-composite cold formed steel beam. Composite beam with HSSC <b>shear</b> <b>connectors</b> showed the best performance as compared to composite beams with SBSC, DBSC and HPSC <b>shear</b> <b>connectors.</b> Also, the results showed that the bending resistance of the composite beam increases as the thickness of steel beam increases. It is concluded that the proposed composite beams with cold formed steel section are strong enough to be used in small and medium size buildings...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} of this thesis is to develop effective 3 -dimensional finite element models to trace the behaviour of headed <b>stud</b> <b>shear</b> <b>connectors</b> in composite girders with solid slabs and precast hollow core slabs. The finite element package ABAQUS was used to conduct the analysis. Push-off tests with both types of slabs were simulated taking into consideration all material nonlinearities of the components. The models are able to predict the headed <b>shear</b> <b>stud</b> capacity, the load-slip characteristic of the shear connection and modes of failure. The results obtained show good agreement with specified data from Codes of practice and results of available numerical and experimental literature. Parametric {{studies were carried out}} using both models to investigate the effects of the change in different parameters on the behaviour of shear connections. Full-scale push-off tests with solid and precast hollow core slabs have been carried out to verify the finite element models. The shear connection capacity, load-slip curves and modes of failure were detected from experimental investigation. Both numerical and experimental results were compared and good agreement has been achieved. The comparison has shown that the model is able to predict accurately the behaviour of headed studs in composite girders with both types of slabs. The non-linear load-slip characteristics of the headed <b>shear</b> <b>stud</b> <b>connector</b> obtained from FE models of push-off tests were used in modelling the structural behaviour of composite steel-solid slab concrete and steel-precast hollow core slab girders. A finite element model has been developed for the analysis of each type. The models took into account the non-linear behaviour of concrete slab, steel beam and <b>shear</b> <b>connectors.</b> The accuracy and efficiency of the models have been demonstrated by comparing finite element results with available published experimental and numerical research. An effective parametric study for the evaluation of the effective width for steel-precast concrete slab composite girders is presented. ...|$|R
