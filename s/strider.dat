He gives up and returns to City 17 in the following strip, as Gordon Freeman finally arrives in the city, linking the comic's time frame with the start of Half-Life 2. He is then drafted into the resistance after failing to disrupt its operations, and unintentionally signals the start of the resistance's uprising after one of his Antlions accidentally kills a Combine police officer. During the fighting, he accompanies Freeman himself and mingles with resistance members, aids the Combine in the capture of Alyx Vance, one of Freeman's allies, and reunites with Norman Frohman, his long-lost assassin twin brother, only to promptly witness his death {{at the hands of a}} <b>Strider,</b> a large tripodal assault synth.|$|E

50|$|The Southern California <b>Striders</b> (also SoCal <b>Striders</b> or SC <b>Striders)</b> is a {{track and}} field {{athletics}} club based in Los Angeles, California. From its foundation in 1955 through the 1980s it was an elite club producing numerous national and Olympic champions. For {{a time in the}} 1970s it was called the Tobias <b>Striders</b> for sponsorship reasons. From the 1990s to 2006 the club was restricted to masters athletics and still produces national champions in older age classes. After 2006 it became a nonprofit open to all ages.|$|R
5000|$|At the 1978 Sun Devil Relays, USC Trojans set a 4 × 200 m {{world record}} (1m 20.26s) despite {{losing to the}} Tobias Striders: the Striders' mark (1m 20.23s) was ineligible as a record because the team was of mixed nationality: Guy Abrahams (Panama), Michael Simmons (USA), Don Quarrie (Jamaica), and James Gilkes (Guyana). [...] By 1980 Tobias <b>Striders</b> had absorbed Angel's Flight <b>Striders</b> and resumed the name SoCal <b>Striders.</b>|$|R
50|$|Veliidae is {{a family}} of predatory insects in the {{suborder}} Heteroptera. They {{are commonly known as}} riffle bugs, smaller water <b>striders</b> or broad-shouldered water <b>striders</b> because the segment immediately behind the head is wider {{than the rest of the}} abdomen, unlike in the typical water <b>striders</b> (Gerridae), close relatives which are also in superfamily Gerroidea. Unlike some Gerridae, riffle bugs are small, typically about 4.5 mm in length.|$|R
5|$|To promote Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3, special retailer-exclusive costume packs were {{available}} as pre-order bonuses. If {{the game was}} pre-ordered from GameStop, the players received the Femme Fatale Pack (Chun-Li, Morrigan, Storm, X-23). Amazon offered the New Age of Heroes Costume Pack (Akuma, Doctor Doom, Sentinel, <b>Strider</b> Hiryu), while Best Buy gave access to the Villains Costume Pack (C. Viper, M.O.D.O.K., Super-Skrull, Wesker). After the game's launch, several other costume packs became available for purchase on specific dates through the Xbox Live Marketplace and PlayStation Network. The Ancient Warriors Costume Pack, consisting of Arthur, Firebrand, Hulk, and Magneto, was originally planned {{to be released in}} December 20, 2011. However, on December 19, 2011, Capcom announced that the pack would be delayed until March 6, 2012, due to existing controversy with Magneto's alternate costume. The costume in question, which was based on Magneto's appearance in Marvel's House of M series, bore similarities to the attire of the King of Spain, Juan Carlos I, and was later removed from the pack.|$|E
25|$|Death's Head makes a cameo {{appearance}} in <b>Strider</b> Hiryu's ending in Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3. He is shown helping <b>Strider</b> and the X-Men {{in a battle}} against the Reavers.|$|E
25|$|Hiryu also {{stars in}} the second arcade game in the series, titled <b>Strider</b> 2 (released in 1999, almost {{ten years after the}} first game). In it, the Grandmaster has {{returned}} to life and has reconquered the Earth, and so Hiryu must once again fight against the Grandmaster and his minions, as well as Hien, a former <b>Strider</b> and Hiryu's rival.|$|E
50|$|Sudden {{increases}} in salt {{concentration in the}} water of gerrid habitats can trigger migration of water <b>striders.</b> Water <b>striders</b> will move to areas of lower salt concentration, resulting in the mix of genes within brackish and freshwater bodies. Nymphal density also affects the dispersal of water <b>striders.</b> The higher density of water <b>striders</b> in the nymphal stage results in {{a higher percentage of}} brachypterous adults developing flight muscles. These flight muscles allow for the water <b>striders</b> to fly to neighboring bodies of water and mate, resulting in the spread of genes. This spread and mixing of genes can be beneficial due to a heterozygotic advantage. Generally, water <b>striders</b> will try to disperse in such a way to lower the density of gerrids in one area or pool of water. Most do this by flight, but those that lack wings or wing muscles will rely on the current of their water body or flooding. Eggs in Halobates are often laid on floating ocean debris and thus spread across the ocean by this drifting matter.|$|R

25|$|A Capcom artist {{known as}} Harumaru {{redesigned}} the character for <b>Strider</b> 2, inspired by American comics {{he had found}} at a bookshelf of the Design Office (among them DC Comics, Mike Mignola, Simon Bisley, and Spawn by Todd McFarlane). In 2014's <b>Strider</b> Hiryu's scarf serves as a visual cue for the Cypher upgrade the player is using (Reflect, Explosive, Cold, Magnetic), changing colors accordingly.|$|E
25|$|The Hobbits {{reach the}} town of Bree, where they {{encounter}} a Ranger named <b>Strider,</b> whom Gandalf had mentioned in a letter. <b>Strider</b> persuades the hobbits to take him on as their guide and protector. Together, they leave Bree after another close escape from the Black Riders. On the hill of Weathertop, they are again attacked by the Black Riders, who wound Frodo with a cursed blade. <b>Strider</b> fights them off with fire and leads the hobbits towards the Elven refuge of Rivendell. Frodo falls deathly sick from the wound. The Black Riders nearly overtake Frodo at the Ford of Bruinen, but flood waters summoned by Elrond, master of Rivendell, rise up and overwhelm them.|$|E
25|$|The manga <b>Strider</b> Hiryu by Tatsumi Wada and Tetsuo Shiba was {{serialized}} in {{the monthly}} magazine Comic Computique from May to October 1988, spanning six issues.

25|$|According to biophysicist David L. Hu, {{there are}} at least 342 species of water <b>striders.</b> As <b>striders</b> {{increase}} in size, their legs become proportionately longer, with Gigantometra gigas having a length of over 20 cm requiring a surface tension force of about 40 millinewtons.|$|R

50|$|Water <b>striders</b> {{are able}} to walk on top of water due to a {{combination}} of several factors. Water <b>striders</b> use the high surface tension of water and long, hydrophobic legs to help them stay above water. Water molecules are polar and this causes them to attract to each other.|$|R
25|$|A new <b>Strider</b> game {{developed}} by Double Helix, was announced by Capcom in July 2013, {{and was released}} for the PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Xbox 360 and Microsoft Windows on February 18, 2014.|$|E
25|$|According to Kouichi Yotsui, the planner of the {{original}} <b>Strider</b> coin-op game, the <b>Strider</b> Hiryu franchise was conceived as a multimedia collaboration between video game company Capcom and manga collective Moto Kikaku, the two companies previously collaborated {{with each other to}} work on the video game versions of the manga Tenchi wo Kurau. Moto Kikaku produced the manga version, while Capcom developed two separate video game versions, a coin-operated video game and a console version for the NES. All three works share common plot elements, while featuring their differences as well. Because of Moto Kikaku's involvement in the character's creation, his name appears alongside Capcom's in the copyrights byline of the character.|$|E

Afraid that he will reveal too much, Frodo climbs on a table and begins to sing and dance to {{distract}} the crowd. However, he slips, and the Ring lands on his finger, turning him invisible. An angry ranger takes the hobbits into another room, warning them they are drawing too much attention to themselves. He introduces himself as <b>Strider</b> (Daran Norris) and asks if he may join them on their journey. At this point, the innkeeper, Barliman Butterbur (Daran Norris), arrives with a letter from Gandalf which informs Frodo that <b>Strider</b> is really Aragorn, a trusted friend. Attracted by Frodo's accidental use of the Ring, the Nazgûl come to Bree, but Aragorn successfully hides the hobbits.|$|E

25|$|Surface living {{animals such as}} {{the water}} <b>strider</b> {{typically}} have hydrophobic feet covered in small hairs that prevent the feet from breaking the surface and becoming wet. Another insect known {{to walk on the}} water surface is the ant species Polyrhachis sokolova. The pygmy gecko (Coleodactylus amazonicus), due to its small size and hydrophobic skin is also able to walk on the water surface.|$|E
25|$|Hiryu {{made his}} first video game {{appearance}} in the arcade game <b>Strider</b> (1989) Since his debut, he has appeared in various video games produced by Capcom, notably in the Marvel vs. Capcom series. Several publications and polls have regarded {{him as one of}} the most popular Capcom characters, one of the top ninja characters in video games, or even one of the best heroes in all of gaming.|$|E
50|$|The Gerridae are {{a family}} of insects in the order Hemiptera, {{commonly}} known as water <b>striders,</b> water bugs, pond skaters, water skippers, or jesus bugs. Consistent with the classification of the Gerridae as true bugs (i.e., suborder Heteroptera), gerrids have mouthparts evolved for piercing and sucking, and distinguish themselves by having the unique ability to walk on water. Gerridae, or water <b>striders,</b> are anatomically built to transfer their weight {{to be able to}} run on top of the water's surface. As a result, one could likely find water <b>striders</b> present in any pond, river, or lake. Scientists have identified over 1,700 species of gerrids, 10% of them being marine.|$|R
