The {{aim of this}} study was to examine in 6 itro whether <b>supernatant</b> <b>solutions</b> and various fractions of bacterial cells influence DNA synthesis in an epithelial cell line of human colon (LS 123). Methods: Strains of Gram-positive (Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus fermentum) and Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli K 12 and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron) were selected. In addition to <b>supernatant</b> <b>solutions,</b> bacterial cell fractions containing either cell wall:membranes, cytosol, nonsoluble intracellular components or dead bacteria were separated by means of multistep centrifugation, French press, and microfiltration. DNA synthesis (labelling index) was estimated on autoradiographs of LS- 123 cells. These cells had previously been labelled with tritiated thymidine following incubation with different concentrations of the <b>supernatant</b> <b>solutions</b> and fractions described above (1 : 2000 – 1 : 250). Results: The supernatant and all the fractions of E. coli significantly increased the labelling index in LS- 123 cells (pB 0. 0001). Only the highest concentration of the fraction of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron containing whole bacterial cells increased the labelling index (pB 0. 001). The cytosolic fraction of Lactobacillus acidophilus significantly increased DNA synthesis at the higher dose range (pB 0. 001). Conclusions: The microflora contains bacterial strains possessing hitherto unknown factor(s) that stimulate DNA synthesis in intestinal epithelial cells in 6 itro. Our results suggest that at least the cell wall of E. coli K 12 and the cytosol of the Gram-positive strain Lactobacillus acidophilus are sources of epithelial cell mitogen(s). Key words...|$|R

Under suitable reducing conditions, e. g. in the presence of an iron(II) containing solid phase which can act as an electron donor, technetium is considered immobile due to the formation of a sparsely soluble hydrous Tc(IV) precipitate. 1 Due to the previously demonstrated association of Tc(IV) eigencolloids with mobile humic substances (HS) or the formation of Tc(IV) -HS complexes, the mobility of reduced Tc species may be drastically enhanced. 2 The recent discovery of very stable Tc(IV) complexes with pyrogallol, a humic substance model compound, is a strong indication for the existence of similar complexes in natural systems containing dissolved organic matter. These pyrogallol complexes, readily formed at pH 11 and stable towards technetium colloid or precipitate formation necessitate a renewed research effort into the potential existence of Tc(IV) -HS complexes. 3 Since the formation of such complexes indicates an extra potential for migration of Tc(IV), their existence would impose a strong incentive for the re-evaluation of today’s safety case associated with high-level radioactive waste disposal. The formation of stable Tc(IV) -NOM complexes was investigated as function of pH using dissolved Boom Clay organic matter. Pertechnetate was pre-reduced in <b>supernatant</b> <b>solutions</b> containing natural BC organic matter at different pH. After the pre-reduction and re-setting of the supernatant pH to pH 8. 2, the predominant pH in the Boom Clay system, the <b>supernatant</b> <b>solutions</b> were contacted with the Boom Clay solid phases.

40|$|AbstractSuppression of the {{acrosome}} reaction of sperm on fertilized oocytes inhibits sperm–oocyte binding {{and is considered}} one of the three mechanisms responsible for polyspermy block in oocytes of the musselMytilus edulis(Togoet al., 1995). When unfertilized oocytes were inseminated in the presence of aminopeptidase inhibitors and the fertilized oocytes were inseminated again, neither the {{acrosome reaction}} nor sperm binding to fertilized oocytes were suppressed, suggesting that aminopeptidase-like protease participates in suppression of the acrosome reaction. The <b>supernatant</b> <b>solution</b> obtained after centrifuging a suspension of fertilized oocytes hydrolyzed aminopeptidase substrates, and these activities were inhibited strongly or effectively by aminopeptidase inhibitors. When unfertilized oocytes were incubated with this <b>supernatant</b> <b>solution</b> and inseminated, both the number of sperm bound and the acrosome reaction rate decreased, and these effects were reversed by conducting this treatment in the presence of aminopeptidase inhibitors.

The modifications of such early changes resulting from a concomitant administration of promethazine together with the carbon tetrachloride were also investigated. The microsomal components studied were: cytochromes P- 450 and b 5; inorganic pyrophosphatase; NADH– and NADPH–cytochrome c reductases; NADH– and NADPH–neotetrazolium reductases; a lipid-peroxidation system associated with the oxidation of NADPH and stimulated by ADP and Fe 2 +. NAD– and NADP– DT-diaphorases were measured in the <b>supernatant</b> <b>solution</b> remaining after isolation of liver microsomes, {{and the distribution of}} RNA phosphorus between the microsomes and <b>supernatant</b> <b>solution</b> was also determined. Carbon tetrachloride produced a rapid fall in inorganic pyrophosphatase activity, a rather slower decrease in cytochrome P- 450 content of the microsomes and small increases in the activities of NADH–cytochrome c reductase and neotetrazolium reductases. The activities of NADPH–cytochrome c reductase, the NADPH–ADP/Fe 2 +-linked lipid-peroxidation system, DT-diaphorases and the content of cytochrome b 5 in the microsomes were unchanged. There was also a loss of RNA phosphorus from the microsomes into the <b>supernatant</b> <b>solution.</b> The RNA phosphorus redistribution, the decrease in inorganic pyrophosphatase and the increases in neotetrazolium reductase activities were at least partially prevented by a concomitant dosing with promethazine.

EHEC serotypes may express one or two classes of serologically defined but structurally and functionally-related Shiga toxins called Stx 1 and Stx 2. Of these, Stx 2 appears to be linked to higher rates of HUS than Stx 1. To investigate a possible reason for this, we exposed human macrophage-like THP- 1 cells to Stx 1 or Stx 2 and then used the Luminex multiplex system to assess cytokine/chemokine concentrations in culture <b>supernatant</b> <b>solutions.</b> This analysis revealed that, relative to Stx 1, Stx 2 significantly caused increased expression of GRO, G-CSF, IL- 1 β, IL- 8 and TNFα in macrophage-like THP- 1 cells. This was determined to not be due to a difference in cytotoxicity since both Stx 1 and Stx 2 displayed similar cytotoxic activities on macrophage-like THP- 1 cells. These observations indicate that, in vitro, Stx 2 can provoke a greater pro-inflammatory response than Stx 1 in macrophages and provides a possible partial explanation for higher rates of HUS in patients infected with EHEC strains expressing Stx 2. To begin to determine a mechanism for Shiga toxin-mediated cytokine production, we exposed macrophage-like THP- 1 cells to Stx 1 or Stx 2 A and B subunits.
