25|$|None of the Peugeots {{finished}} the race, despite Peugeot being favourite {{to win the}} race. The #3 car retired just two hours into the race with a suspension failure, resulting in a broken chassis tub with Pedro Lamy behind the wheel. Sébastien Bourdais the pole-setter did not even get to drive the car. The #2 Peugeot retired with engine problems {{in the early morning}} and an exploding turbocharger while leading the race. This left the sole remaining #1 Peugeot to defend the marque's title. By that time, the #1 Peugeot was running 6th, after dropping 3 laps to replace its alternator. In the closing hour, The #1 Peugeot ran at extremely fast qualifying pace to chase the Audis and eventually overtook the #8 Audi for second position and was on the pace of catching the leading #9 Audi. Unfortunately, the #1 Peugeot also suffered an engine failure, almost identical to its sister car. In a post-race analysis by Peugeot, the #3 damage was the <b>suspension</b> <b>mounting</b> point separating from the carbon fiber tub, causing an undetected structural problem that forced the #3 to retire. The #2 and #1 car, as well as the #4 Oreca that suffered the same engine failure as the other two about slightly over an hour left in the race, was caused by the increased stress of the engines (particularly the connecting rod) that caused the engine failures, partially because of the pace the Audis were going at. In particular this race had perfectly dry weather and therefore no rain would slow the pace of these LMP1, which might have also put too much stress to the Peugeot engines as well as the reason for the distance record.|$|E

50|$|The WRX Type RA STi {{was dropped}} {{for a new}} WRX STi Spec C. This model was much lighter than the WRX Type RA as it {{received}} lighter glass and body panels. The Spec C's handling was much improved due {{to an increase in}} caster (from 3.5 degrees to 5 degrees). This was achieved not by changing the <b>suspension</b> <b>mounting</b> point, but by lengthening the wheelbase (15 mm). This was done by including different control arms. This increased caster significantly helped the turn-in capabilities of the car. The Spec C also has a steering rack ratio of 13:1. The transmission is supplied with its own oil cooler.|$|E
50|$|The Fiat {{frame was}} {{abandoned}} {{in favor of}} a new space-frame chassis built by Devin that weighed just 40 lb. This frame duplicated the locations of the original unit's <b>suspension</b> <b>mounting</b> points, allowing the original Fiat front and rear suspension to be reused. That suspension was a transverse leaf spring with A-arms and tube-shocks in front and semi-trailing arms with coil springs and tube-shocks in the rear. The stock drum brakes were replaced by 12 in disks made by Cagle. The engine was rotated 180 degrees from its rear-engine location in the original car to a mid-engine layout in the Roosevelt-Devin. The Fiat 600 transaxle also received a set of Harley Klentz Quick Change Gears.|$|E
50|$|Although {{the chassis}} monocoques for 701/2 and 701/4 had been {{manufactured}} by March, the final buildup {{of the cars}} was by Tyrrell mechanics. As a result, the blue Tyrrell cars incorporated {{a significant number of}} differences and tweaks in their configuration to the cars run by the works March team and those supplied to other customers. The first major difference was the specification of Dunlop tyres, rather than the Firestone rubber with which the works cars were equipped and the 701 had been designed around. In an attempt to develop the car and improve its handling the Tyrrell team made adjustments to the position of the <b>suspension</b> <b>mounting</b> points and added a damper to the steering system. More subtle variations related to the positioning of exhaust pipe brackets, wing struts, the oil radiator, and the pipe runs for lubrication and coolant fluids.|$|E

50|$|In 1982, Dome {{built the}} RC82 as their first {{effort in the}} new Group C {{category}} of sports car racing. The chassis was built by March Engineering, whilst the engine was a 3.3-litre Cosworth DFL V8 engine. Dome, with sponsorship from Amada, debuted the car at the 1982 6 Hours of Silverstone, and selected Chris Craft, Raul Boesel and Eliseo Salazar to drive it. It would not {{prove to be a}} successful debut, as the car succumbed to fuel pressure issues after 116 laps. Dome then entered Craft and Salazar at the 24 Hours of Le Mans, but the <b>suspension</b> <b>mounting</b> failed after 85 laps, and the team were forced to retire. The RC82 was not used again until the 1983 24 Hours of Le Mans; Nick Mason joined the team, but the car lasted 75 laps before succumbing to clutch failure. Following the race, the RC83 made its debut in the 1000 km of Fuji, with the factory phasing out the RC82.|$|E

This would mark the first time that none of the Peugeot 908s finished at the end of the 24-hour classic. Proving its reliability compared to the 908's engine issues, Audi's revised R15 TDI plus swept the podium while breaking a new distance record previously set in , despite the four 908s ran faster in a single lap than any of the three R15s. A post-race analysis found out that the #3 had a <b>suspension</b> <b>mounting</b> point separating from the carbon fiber tub, while the other three (#1, #2, #4) had failures of the new titanium connecting rods that caused the engine failures. This race was also run in perfectly dry weather allowing for incredibly fast qualifying-pace lap times. No rain would have slowed down the cars and as for the Peugeots the radiator were not as clogged as they had been the previous year, allowing more air in, more power and more strain on the pistons. Peugeot did prove themselves to be the fastest ever LMP car with Loïc Duval setting a 3:19.000 in the race and the #1 car chasing down the leading #9 Audi from 3 laps down to a mere minute. Peugeot entered 2 cars at the 2010 Silverstone 1000 km and won the race. Peugeot entered two cars at the 2010 Petit Le Mans, qualifying 1-2 for the race, and finishing 1-2 ahead of the 2 Audi R15s.
