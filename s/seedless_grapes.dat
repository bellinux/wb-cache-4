500|$|The new hybrid {{was tested}} and {{scrutinized}} for 17years {{before it was}} declared ready for growers and gardeners and was released on [...] [...] Around 2008, trials outside of California were just beginning. [...] Thomcord quickly became a hit at farmers' markets while it was being tested, and it {{has appeared in the}} fresh-fruit section at supermarkets. This continued the long-standing success of the ARS' grape-breeding research in California, which has developed {{some of the most popular}} <b>seedless</b> <b>grapes</b> on the market as well as red, white, and black grapes varieties for hobbyists and professional growers since 1923.|$|E
500|$|In 1983, {{research}} horticulturist David W. Ramming and technician Ronald L. Tarailo—Californian grape breeders {{working for}} the ARS, the chief scientific research agency of the USDA—crossed Thompson Seedless and Concord in order to answer a technical question about a newly developed procedure for breeding novel, superior <b>seedless</b> <b>grapes.</b> [...] The researchers wanted to demonstrate that plants created from embryo culture were derived from fertilized eggs (zygotic) instead of the maternal tissue (somatic). [...] From 1231emasculations (removal of male flower parts to control pollination) of Thompson Seedless, the researchers produced 130ovules using embryo rescue procedures. [...] From these, 40embryos developed and three seedlings were planted. [...] The original seedling of Thomcord was planted in 1984 in plots in cooperation with California State University, Fresno. [...] It was later selected in 1986 by Ramming and Tarailo and tested in the San Joaquin Valley under the name A29-67, and was introduced as [...] "Thomcord." ...|$|E

2500|$|Grape {{juice is}} {{obtained}} from crushing and blending grapes into a liquid. The juice is often sold in stores or fermented and made into wine, brandy, or vinegar. [...] Grape juice {{that has been}} pasteurized, removing any naturally occurring yeast, will not ferment if kept sterile, and thus contains no alcohol. [...] In the wine industry, grape juice that contains 7–23% of pulp, skins, stems and seeds {{is often referred to}} as [...] "must". In North America, the most common grape juice is purple and made from Concord grapes, while white grape juice is commonly made from Niagara grapes, both of which are varieties of [...] grapes, a different species from European wine grapes. In California, Sultana (known there as Thompson <b>Seedless)</b> <b>grapes</b> are sometimes diverted from the raisin or table market to produce white juice.|$|E
2500|$|It {{took time}} for the Californian wine {{industry}} to recover from this setback. By the 1960s, California was primarily known for its sweet port-style wines made from Carignan and Thompson <b>Seedless</b> <b>grapes.</b> However {{a new wave of}} winemakers soon emerged and helped usher in a renaissance period in California wine with a focus on new winemaking technologies and emphasizing quality. Several well-known wineries were founded in this decade including Robert Mondavi, Heitz Wine Cellars and David Bruce Winery. As the quality of Californian wine improved, the region started to receive more international attention. A [...] moment for the industry occurred in 1976 when British wine merchant Steven Spurrier invited several Californian wineries to participate in a blind tasting event in Paris. It was to compare the best of California with the best of Bordeaux and Burgundy - two famous French wine regions. In an event known as The Judgment of Paris, Californian wines shocked the world by sweeping the wine competition in both the red and white wine categories. Throughout the wine world, perspectives about the potential of California wines started to change. The state's wine industry continued to grow as California {{emerged as one of the}} world's premier wine regions.|$|E
50|$|The {{fruit of}} <b>seedless</b> <b>grapes</b> {{is smaller than}} normal because seeds produce the plant hormone gibberellin, which causes fruit enlargement.

A new cultivar, 'Melissa', has naturally larger fruit so does not require gibberellin sprays.|$|E

5|$|Thomcord grape is {{a hybrid}} of Thompson <b>Seedless</b> <b>grape</b> (Vitis vinifera, or Sultanina), which is popular in {{supermarkets}} during the summer, and seeded Concord grape (Vitis labrusca), commonly used to make grape juice and jelly. It is a plump, juicy, <b>seedless</b> table <b>grape</b> and is slightly firmer than Concord. Thomcord has a blue-black skin with medium thickness and a whitish bloom. Unlike Concord, whose tough skin separates easily from the fruit, Thomcord has a more edible skin that clings to the flesh, much like Thompson Seedless. It has an aromatic flavor, similar to the Concord in taste ("labrusca"), though lighter due to the sweet, mild taste from Thompson Seedless.|$|R
40|$|This article compares {{diffusion}} models used {{to describe}} <b>seedless</b> <b>grape</b> drying at low temperature. The models were analyzed, assuming the following characteristics of the drying process: boundary conditions {{of the first and}} the third kind; constant and variable volume, V; constant and variable effective mass diffusivity, D; constant convective mass transfer coefficient, h. Solutions of the diffusion equation (analytical and numerical) were used to determine D and h for experimental data of <b>seedless</b> <b>grape</b> drying. Comparison of simulations of drying kinetics indicates that the best model should consider: 1) shrinkage; 2) convective boundary condition; 3) variable effective mass diffusivity. For the analyzed experimental dataset, the best function to represent the effective mass diffusivity is a hyperbolic cosine. In this case, the statistical indicators of the simulation can be considered excellent (the determination coefficient is R 2 = 0. 9999 and the chi-square is χ 2 = 3. 241 × 10 – 4 ) ...|$|R
