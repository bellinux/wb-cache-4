500|$|When {{introducing}} the composition to Lennon, McCartney {{assured him that}} he would [...] "fix" [...] the line [...] "the movement you need is on your shoulder", reasoning that [...] "it's a stupid expression; it sounds like a parrot." [...] Lennon replied: [...] "You won't, you know. That's the best line in the song." [...] McCartney retained the phrase; he later said of his subsequent live performances of the song: [...] "that's the line when I think of John, and <b>sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> a little emotional during that moment." ...|$|E
500|$|Clarkson {{continued}} feuding with Tedder in 2010. In December 2009, Tedder {{said that}} he was no longer angry over the accusations Clarkson made, but warned, [...] "fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me. [...] I don't wanna get some crazy-ass backlash or get my head snapped off for writing a hit song." [...] He later told The Denver Post that he had gotten over the situation and is working on new material for Clarkson's fifth album. Clarkson, however, told the Daily Star that she is writing and recording new songs with new, low-profile producers. [...] "I don’t like working with people who have worked with everyone. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> blackmailed into doing so by my label," [...] she said, [...] "but I prefer collaborating with people who aren't on the grid. I don’t want to sound exactly like other people's records." [...] In May, an unreleased electro-pop song by Clarkson called [...] "Wash, Rinse, Repeat" [...] was leaked on the Internet. The song contains auto tuned lyrics that Idolator say are likely written about Tedder: [...] "I can't take the pressure of new. Give me old, rip it off. / Let's see if it sticks to the wall again. / Does it sound familiar? Does it linger in your ear? / Like something you remember from just last year?" [...] and [...] "Music from the past, from the present, well, just last week / We will change a note and get away with it, wait and see." [...] Tedder {{said that he}} thinks the song was written about him, too, but admitted he likes the song. [...] "I think Kelly speaks her mind regardless of anything. She's great with lyrics, and I love that she is her own person. She's no puppet." ...|$|E
2500|$|In December 2006, O'Donnell criticized Donald Trump {{for holding}} {{a press conference}} to {{reinstate}} Miss USA Tara Conner, who had violated pageant guidelines, accusing him of using her scandal to [...] "generate publicity for the Miss USA Pageant" [...] (to which he owns the rights) by announcing he was giving her a second chance. O'Donnell commented that due to Trump's multiple marital affairs and questionable business bankruptcies, he was not a moral authority for young people in America. She stated, [...] "Left the first wife, had an affair. Left the second wife, had an affair – but he's the moral compass for 20-year-olds in America." [...] In response, Trump began a [...] "vicious" [...] mass media blitz in which he appeared on various television shows, either in person or by phone, threatening to sue O'Donnell (he never did). He called her names, threatened to take away her partner Kelli, and claimed that Barbara Walters regretted hiring her. Walters was stuck in the middle as a social acquaintance of Trump's, and said O'Donnell didn't feel like Walters defended her enough, which led to what both women agreed was an unfortunate confrontation in one of the dressing rooms. [...] "I had pain and hurt and rejection," [...] O'Donnell said, [...] "sometimes [...] overwhelm me. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> flooded." [...] Walters denied that she was unhappy with O'Donnell, saying, [...] "I have never regretted, nor do I now, the hiring of Rosie O'Donnell." ...|$|E

5000|$|He {{frequently}} addressed political {{themes in}} his artwork.

I admit I fall down in sympathy <b>sometimes.</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> so dog-gone impatient with people that can't stand the gaff. You'd be good for a fellow that was too serious.

6000|$|... 'I am in {{the mosaic}} department. Oh, Miss Gillian, I am so {{grateful}} to Miss Merrifield.

I began only as the girls do who are mere hands, and now I have to prepare all the designs for them, and have a nice little office of my own for it. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> one of my own designs taken, and then I am paid extra.' ...|$|E

There are others--many others--who speak more convincingly, but no one feels more than I feel, no one prays for the better times more fervently than I.

5000|$|Many of the {{characters}} Epstein portrayed were troubled types. He said, [...] "I'm a pretty upbeat person. <b>I</b> think <b>I</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>get</b> cast as these brooding types because I bring light and joy, which hopefully makes them more likable." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But if we {{do wrong}} we get ours, don't we?" [...] Mary persisted. [...] "That's what they all say, except Bert. He says he don't care what he does, he'll never get his, because when he dies he's dead, an' when he's dead he'd like to see any one put {{anything}} across on him that'd wake him up. Ain't he terrible, though? But it's all so funny. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> scared when I think God's keepin' an eye on me all the time. Do you think he knows what I'm sayin' now?

6000|$|... "I {{sleep in}} cheap lodging houses," [...] the Bishop went on. [...] "But I am afraid, and never stay long in one place. Also, I rent two rooms in workingmen's houses in {{different}} {{quarters of the}} city. It is a great extravagance, I know, but it is necessary. I {{make up for it}} in part by doing my own cooking, though <b>sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> something to eat in cheap coffee-houses. And I have made a discovery. Tamales* are very good when the air grows chilly late at night. Only they are so expensive. But I have discovered a place where I can get three for ten cents.

6000|$|... 'I do {{not read}} much here this time, so much of every day is taken up with talking to the people about me. That is all right, and I {{generally}} can turn the talk to something that I wish them to hear, so it is all {{in the way of}} business here. And I am glad to say that my school, and conversations and lessons, need some careful preparation. I have spent some time in drawing up for myself a little scheme of teaching for people in the state of my friends here. I ought of course to have done it long ago, and it is a poor thing now. I cannot take a real pleasure in teaching, and so I do it badly. I am always, almost always, glad when school is over, though <b>sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> much interested myself, though not often able to interest others.|$|E

5000|$|Besides children, adults also {{gather around}} here for conversations and social bonding. Madam Yee, a {{resident}} of more than 35 years, said, “What I like most about this place is the friendship that I’ve forged throughout the years. I live alone and it’s good that my neighbours check up on me when they have the time. <b>Sometimes</b> if <b>I</b> <b>get</b> bored, <b>I</b> {{go down to the}} playground and chitchat with them.

6000|$|... "This pilgrimage of ours," [...] he said, presently, [...] "has {{made for}} magnanimity. This day {{particularly}} {{has been a}} good day. When we stood on this old wall here in the sunset I seemed to be standing outside myself in an immense still sphere of past and future. I stood with my feet upon the Stone Age and saw myself four thousand years away, and all my distresses as very little incidents in that perspective. Away there in London the case is altogether different; after three hours or so of the Committee one concentrates into one little inflamed moment of personality. There is no past any longer, there is no future, there is only the rankling dispute. For all those three hours, perhaps, I have been thinking of just what I had to say, just how I had to say it, just how I looked while I said it, just how much I was making myself understood, how I might be misunderstood, how I might be misrepresented, challenged, denied. One draws in more and more as one is used up. At last one is reduced to a little, raw, bleeding, desperately fighting, pin-point of SELF.... One goes back to one's home unable to recover. Fighting it over again. All night <b>sometimes....</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> up and walk about the room and curse.... Martineau, how is one to get the Avebury frame of mind to Westminster?" ...|$|E

My writing is very honest, I just try to capture that moment as best as I can.|$|E
2500|$|Isis {{were the}} opening act for Tool's late 2006 North American tour {{in support of}} their new album, 10,000 Days. This led to {{increased}} exposure for the band; however, the band members are not particularly comfortable with fame, and tend to keep their affairs private. Turner has stated that [...] "We never imagined that Isis would become as successful or as popular as it has", and confesses: [...] " [...] taking a deeply personal interest in who I am, it fucking freaks me out. And I really do feel like <b>sometimes</b> when <b>I</b> <b>get</b> approached, I'm retreating into my shell." ...|$|R
5000|$|Ternasky's {{death was}} an {{incredibly}} significant event {{for both the}} skateboarding community and those people who were intensively involved with the Plan B brand; Johnson stated in a December 2012 interview, [...] "Mike was always like, to me, he definitely installed in {{me a lot of}} stuff that is permanently in me. When I'm really pushing myself <b>sometimes,</b> <b>I</b> have to remember sometimes, like, you know, I really will bring him up in my head and remember certain things he used to say to me and, and, that's, you know, <b>sometimes</b> how <b>I</b> <b>get</b> shit done." [...] Mullen has also spoken publicly about his relationship with Ternasky and explained in a 2002 interview, [...] "He was such a great person. He would lift you so high and that is why Plan B was what it was. And it was clear once Mike was gone that it was never the same." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don Ramon is <b>sometimes</b> discreet; <b>I</b> didn't <b>get</b> {{much from}} him. The Commandancia people are {{his friends and}} so far I reckon they have not made trouble about the men Musgrave left in Africa. However, he stated that Don Arturo would shortly arrive from Liverpool {{to see if he}} could settle the coaling dispute, and I imagine Don Ramon would sooner leave the thing to his chief." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "You're Out Doing What I'm Here Doing Without" [...] {{is a song}} {{written by}} Allen Frizzell and Bo Roberts, and {{recorded}} by American country music artist Gene Watson.

5000|$|... "Forgive me Lord but <b>sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> {{tired of}} being a citizen. The city tires me, the offices, my family and the economy.

Forgive me Lord but sometimes I think you have something better than this for me. Forgive me Lord, I don't {{want to be a}} citizen, I want to be a man, Lord, like you created me." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "I {{can spot}} traces {{of other people}} on this album, us included," [...] remarked Alice Cooper, [...] "but that's all they are: traces. They were a really {{original}} band. This is their peak album, where they really went out on a limb. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> {{so caught up in}} these songs, I can actually feel the band pushing themselves to their limits.

2500|$|When {{reporters from}} the Associated Press {{compared}} {{the show to}} the Disney Channel musical comedy series Hannah Montana, Michael Wolff remarked, [...] "The boys are natural musicians who {{just happen to be}} on TV." [...] Tom Asheim, the executive {{vice president and general manager}} for Nickelodeon, also said, [...] "This is our version of The Monkees. Nat Wolff wrote all the music, which I think distinguishes the show. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>I</b> think you <b>get</b> a sense from bands that they are [...] like Milli Vanilli.

500|$|Although Milian was a {{songwriter}} since her teenagers years, she only felt real growth during the production sessions when Dre told her, [...] "there are no rules". Previously, Milian would write songs that followed rules, {{where she would}} have a hook, a verse, and another verse with similar sound and melody. For So Amazin, she wrote with a [...] "no rules theory", which was her biggest obstacle while recording the album. She said, [...] "It was just, you know what? I can change up the melody I can do different things. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>I</b> might <b>get</b> stuck but wait half an hour and it'll come to you and end up being hot. So that's probably my biggest obstacle, just stepping away from doing the usual that I know and stepping into something new. Once I got past all that, it was just easy. With flying colors, I started writing all the records." ...|$|R
2500|$|During {{performances}} Bob Log {{will often}} call audience members (both male and female) on stage {{to sit on}} his knee while he plays. Log credits years of drumming with his feet {{for his ability to}} simultaneously drum and support the weight of multiple people: [...] "My legs are huge now. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>I</b> can <b>get</b> a girl on each knee and bounce 'em along." [...] Log has distinctively used breasts as a theme in his performance and hired two [...] "professional women" [...] to use their breasts as percussion instruments on his song [...] "Clap Your Tits". Log {{is quick to point out}} that all of these acts are carried out between consenting adults and individuals familiar with his brand of humor, stating, [...] "First of all, if you come to my show knowing I've got a song called [...] "Boob Scotch" [...] and you get offended, I'm sorry but I've got to say just get out." ...|$|R
