500|$|The next year, CTV, Canada's first private TV {{network and}} a fledgling {{competitor}} of his father's network, hired the 24-year-old Jennings as co-anchor of its late-night national newscast. While reporting for CTV, {{he was the}} first Canadian journalist to arrive in Dallas after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. In 1964, CTV sent Jennings to cover the Democratic National Convention in Atlantic City, New Jersey. There, he ran into Elmer Lower, then president of ABC News, who offered him a job as a correspondent for the American network, an opportunity Jennings initially rejected. [...] "The job was pretty intimidating for a guy like me in a tiny city in Canada," [...] Jennings later recalled. [...] "I thought, What if I <b>screw</b> <b>up?</b> What if I fail?" [...] Three months later though, he changed his mind and moved to the United States.|$|E
500|$|Jean became show runner of The Simpsons at {{the start}} of the third season (1991) {{together}} with Reiss. A show runner has the ultimate responsibility of all the processes that an episode goes through before completion, including the writing, the animation, the voice acting, and the music. When Jean began his tenure as show runner, the only thing he thought to himself every day was [...] "Don't blow it and <b>screw</b> <b>up</b> this thing everyone loves." [...] The first episode Jean and Reiss ran was [...] "Mr. Lisa Goes to Washington" [...] (aired September 19, 1991), and they felt a lot of pressure on them to make it good. They were so pressured that they did six to seven rewrites of the script in order to improve its humor. Jean said he [...] "kept thinking 'It's not good enough. It's not good enough.'" [...] Reiss added that [...] "we were definitely scared. We had never run anything before, and they dumped us on this." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{his book}} Somebody Scream!: Rap Music's Rise to Prominence in the Aftershock of Black Power, Marcus Reeves said that Fear of a Black Planet [...] "was {{as much a}} musical assault on America's racism {{as it was a}} call to blacks to {{effectively}} react to it". According to Greg Kot, the album was [...] "hardly a black power manifesto for world domination, but a statement about racial paranoia. Though he spares virtually no one with his withering raps, Public Enemy's Chuck D is harshest of all on his fellow blacks, expounding on everything from history to fashion: Use your brain instead of a gun. Drugs are death. Know your past so you won't <b>screw</b> <b>up</b> the future. Gold chains worn around the neck demean the brotherhood in South Africa." [...] Kot wrote of Chuck D's perspective and the theme of fear, [...] "It's fear that divides us, he says; understand me better and you won't run. Fear of a Black Planet is about achieving that understanding, but on Public Enemy's terms. In presenting their view of life from an Afro-centric, as opposed to Euro-centric, perspective, P.E. challenges listeners to step into their world." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{majority}} of backing tracks {{on the first}} three sides of the album were recorded at I.D. Sound Studios, Los Angeles, engineered by James Lowe with assistance from John Lee. The studio {{was one of the}} first independent units in LA, and Lowe believes Rundgren chose it due to the ability to work hands-on without record company interference and having all the latest technology and equipment. Rundgren played every instrument in turn, starting with the drums, noting it [...] "was the logical place to start," [...] with the others individually laid down on top. While recording the drums, Rundgren would try and hum the song in his head to remember where he was, but [...] "if I would <b>screw</b> <b>up,</b> then I would change the song afterwards, to fit the mistake that I had made, because it was easier than going back and fixing it." [...] In retrospect, Rundgren felt he might have performed better with a click track, being a novice drummer at the time, but concluded that the end result [...] "sound like a band". He didn't think his lack of technical proficiency on the instrument was a particular handicap, saying that [...] "people comprehend what you're playing, and it has a greater impact." [...] Engineering the album, Lowe recalled he was [...] "mostly working in the dark", and that Rundgren would leave spaces for instruments during recording, spontaneously developing a song as it was being recorded. [...] "I was never sure exactly where the song was going until we'd put down about four or five tracks." ...|$|E

2500|$|The issue many {{took with}} Lost Odyssey was its {{deliberately}} old-school gameplay mechanics, particularly the traditional combat system, which several critics {{found to be}} dull and dated, {{as well as the}} game's use of random battles, which were further deemed an issue by their purportedly lengthy load times. Xbox Focus gave the game a 4/5 rating, declaring its story as profound, but taking an issue with the camera control and the odd character design. Unlike other critics, however, Xbox Focus's Alex Yusupov deemed the combat and random battles as exhilarating, and that [...] "it's better to take a tried and true technique and make it better than introduce a completely new idea that could possibly <b>screw</b> <b>up</b> an entire game." [...] IGN found that the ring-building system, immortals, and skill system added a fresh feel to the game's otherwise traditional combat, and 1UP.com praised the [...] "timed button press" [...] aspect of the battles, saying it makes them [...] "more engaging than you'd think." ...|$|E

2500|$|On October 28, 1962, {{during the}} peak of the Cuban Missile Crisis, U.S. {{strategic}} forces were at Defense Condition Two (DEFCON 2). According to missile technicians who witnessed events, the four MACE B missile sites on Okinawa erroneously received coded launch orders to fire all of their 32 nuclear cruise missiles at the Soviets and their allies. Quick thinking by Capt. William Bassett who questioned whether the order was [...] "the real thing, or the biggest <b>screw</b> <b>up</b> we will ever experience in our lifetime” delayed the orders to launch until the error was realized by the missile operations center. According to witness John Bordne, Capt. Bassett was the senior field officer commanding the missiles and was nearly forced to have a subordinate lieutenant who was intent on following the orders to launch his missiles shot by armed security guards. No U.S. Government record of this incident has ever been officially released. Former missileers have refuted Bordne's account.|$|E

She describes her family as [...] "poor" [...] people living as outsiders in an impoverished area of London, who [...] "kept their heads down and tried to assimilate". Her father, Alfred, was a dress salesman, her mother, Mabel, ran a children's clothes shop and both were committed Labour voters. [...] She has stated that her father was [...] "gentle, kind and innocent", an [...] "overgrown child", and that [...] "as my other parent he just wasn’t there", which taught her [...] "how the absence of proper fathering could <b>screw</b> <b>up</b> a child for life". She was educated at Putney High School, a girls' fee-paying independent school in Putney, London. Later she read English at St Anne's College, Oxford.|$|E

[...] Ratcliff was also critical that Sue was not more of a feminist: [...] "I was under the impression she'd become more assertive. I had visions of a bunch of feminists walking into the cafe one day {{right in the middle of}} a typical Sue and Ali fight, and them asking her why she puts up with him. No doubt Sue would <b>screw</b> <b>up</b> her nose and ask: 'What do you mean?'

I'm not a big believer in luck, but that was pretty unlucky. It was really too bad." [...] In an interview six days later, Sanchez described the play again: [...] "It's embarrassing. You <b>screw</b> <b>up</b> the play and I'm trying to do the right thing. It's not like I'm trying to force something.
