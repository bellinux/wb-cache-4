5|$|We made it {{very clear}} we were not doing another record for TVT. But they made it pretty clear they weren't ready to sell. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> like, well, I've finally got this thing going but it's dead. Flood and I had to record Broken under a {{different}} band name, because if TVT found out we were recording, they could confiscate all our shit and release it. Jimmy Iovine got involved with Interscope, and we kind of got slave-traded. It wasn't my doing. I didn't know anything about Interscope. And I was real pissed off at him at first because it was going from one bad situation to potentially another one. But Interscope went into it like they really wanted to know what I wanted. It was good, after I put my raving lunatic act on.|$|E
25|$|I {{was getting}} so heavy that even my vocalizing was getting heavy. I was tiring myself, I was perspiring too much, and I was really working too hard. And I wasn't really well, as in health; I couldn't move freely. And then I {{was tired of}} playing a game, for {{instance}} playing this beautiful young woman, and I was heavy and uncomfortable to move around. In any case, it was uncomfortable and I didn't like it. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> now if I'm going to do things right—I've studied all my life to put things right musically, so why don't I diet and put myself into a certain condition where I'm presentable.|$|E
500|$|Fox {{said that}} while filming her highly {{anticipated}} kissing scene with Seyfried that Seyfried was [...] "extremely uncomfortable" [...] but that she herself was not. [...] "I feel much safer with girls, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> more comfortable kissing [...] than kissing {{any of the other}} people that I had to kiss", she said. Seyfried's uneasiness in the scene caused [...] "giggling fits" [...] between takes. Seyfried said that neither of them wanted to do the kiss because they felt it was just for promotional purposes. She agreed with Fox that she was uneasy about acting out the scene. [...] "It was my first time doing a real kissing scene with a woman", she stated. [...] "It is just weird. It is a woman. With a woman's smell—soft and floraly—and maybe the pheromones are different. Something about it felt uncomfortable for me." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{duet with}} Gomez in [...] "Bidi Bidi Bom Bom" [...] had a mixed reception. The Belfast Telegraph wrote that Gomez had done an [...] "amazing job". At the Billboard Latin Music Awards in Miami, A.B. told E! that Gomez gave a [...] "fantastic vocal {{performance}} on the record". Gomez told JustJared.com, [...] "I was completely honored when {{they asked me to}} be on the tribute CD and when I went into the studio to record they actually had her vocals in the booth that she was in, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> like she was singing right next to me, it gave me chills! It was incredible {{and it was a great}} experience and it was a great song." [...] Domingo Banda of the Semana News called [...] "Bidi Bidi Bom Bom" [...] a [...] "standout track". Guerra, however, wrote that the new version of [...] "Bidi Bidi Bom Bom" [...] was ...|$|E
500|$|The {{album cover}} {{features}} {{a photograph of}} Dylan with Suze Rotolo. It was taken in February 1963—a few weeks after Rotolo had returned from Italy—by CBS staff photographer Don Hunstein {{at the corner of}} Jones Street and West 4th Street in the West Village, New York City, close to the apartment where the couple lived at the time. In 2008, Rotolo described the circumstances surrounding the famous photo to The New York Times: [...] "He wore a very thin jacket, because image was all. Our apartment was always cold, so I had a sweater on, plus I borrowed one of his big, bulky sweaters. On top of that I put on a coat. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> like an Italian sausage. Every time I look at that picture, I think I look fat." [...] In her memoir, A Freewheelin' Time, Rotolo analyzed the significance of the cover art: ...|$|E
500|$|Wright's hire {{occurred}} while Moggach was on {{her third}} draft. Despite her desire {{to work closely with}} Austen's dialogue, Wright made an effort to not [...] "be too reverential to [...] I don't believe people spoke like that then; it's not natural." [...] While a few scenes, such as the discussion over accomplished women, aligned closely with the author's original dialogue, many others [...] "substituted instead a mixture of modern idiom and archaic-sounding sentence structure". One alteration concerned politeness; Wright noted that while Austen's work had characters waiting before speaking, he believed that [...] "particularly in big families of girls, everyone tends to speak over each other, finishing each other's sentences, etc. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> that the Bennet family's conversations would be overlapping like that." [...] Sense and Sensibility actress and screenwriter Emma Thompson aided in script development, though she opted to be uncredited. She advised the nervous director about adapting Austen for the screen and made dialogue recommendations, such as with parts of the Collins-Charlotte storyline.|$|E
25|$|I {{told people}} the {{complete}} opposite. I told them I raised it up 140 volts. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>so</b> bad. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>so</b> f—ing horrible, man. They said, “Please don’t attempt what Eddie Van Halen {{said in the}} last interview, because everyone was blowing their amps.” Everyone fried their amps ’cause of me. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>so</b> bad. <b>I</b> never lied again after that.|$|R
6000|$|... "I couldn't help it, sir," [...] the man declared. [...] "I couldn't, indeed. <b>I</b> was <b>so</b> scared, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> {{must speak}} {{about it to}} some one. And then there were these shares. There was nowhere I could keep 'em safe." ...|$|R

500|$|This is {{followed}} by [...] "Pretty as a Swastika", a [...] "mosh pit-ready" [...] heavy metal song. Manson described {{it as one of}} his proudest moments lyrically. According to Manson, its title was [...] "something I said to a girl because of her complexion—with black hair, red lips and pale skin. I mean, it was a complex and poetic statement which soon led to intercourse, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> no reason for it to be seen as hateful or destructive." [...] At the insistence of Interscope Records, the song was re-titled on the album's back cover. Manson was critical of this censorship, saying: [...] "Rather than take it off the album, I decided to produce it on the sleeve with a different name, so it'll be sold in Walmart or wherever stores sell guns but are afraid to deal with lyrics. So I put [...] "Pretty as a ($)", because all of their motivations are based on money." [...] "Leave a Scar" [...] was written by Manson [...] "about and for Evan on the day we broke up. Maybe some of the things I say in the song are cruel, but it is how I felt at the time." ...|$|E
500|$|Shortly before Christmas of 2011, Christopher Nolan invited several {{prominent}} directors, including Edgar Wright, Michael Bay, Bryan Singer, Jon Favreau, Eli Roth, Duncan Jones and Stephen Daldry, to Universal CityWalk's IMAX theatre {{for a private}} screening of the first six minutes of The Dark Knight Rises, which had been shot on IMAX film and edited from the original camera negative. Nolan, feeling {{that the use of}} film stock in cinema is currently being phased out due to the introduction of digital cinematography and projection, used this screening to make a case for the continued use of film, which he asserts still offers superior image quality to any digital format, and warned the filmmakers that unless they continued to assert their choice to use film in their productions, they may eventually lose it as an option. Nolan explained; [...] "I wanted to {{give them a chance to}} see the potential, because I think IMAX is the best film format that was ever invented. It's the gold standard and what any other technology has to match up to, but none have, in my opinion. The message I wanted to put out there was that no one is taking anyone's digital cameras away. But if we want film to continue as an option, and someone is working on a big studio movie with the resources and the power to insist [...] film, they should say <b>so.</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> as if I didn't say anything, and then we started to lose that option, it would be a shame. When I look at a digitally acquired and projected image, it looks inferior against an original negative anamorphic print or an IMAX one." ...|$|E
2500|$|Resnais {{was often}} {{linked with the}} group of French filmmakers who made their {{breakthrough}} as the New Wave or nouvelle vague in the late 1950s, but by then he had already established a significant reputation through his ten years of work on documentary short films. He defined his own relationship by saying: [...] "Although I was not fully part of the New Wave because of my age, there was some mutual sympathy and respect between myself and Rivette, Bazin, Demy, Truffaut... <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> friendly with that team." [...] He nevertheless acknowledged his debt to the New Wave because it created the conditions of production, and particularly the financial conditions, which allowed {{him to make a}} film like Hiroshima mon amour, his first feature film.|$|E
60|$|Nevertheless, {{the power}} and pathos of this picture cannot be too much praised. The {{coloring}} is beautiful, and though it pained me <b>so</b> much, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> {{that it was one}} of the most striking works of art I had seen.|$|R

2500|$|As a boy, Schwarzenegger played several sports, heavily {{influenced}} by his father. He picked up his first barbell in 1960, when his soccer coach took his team to a local gym. At the age of 14, he chose bodybuilding over soccer as a career. He later said, [...] "I actually started weight training when I was 15, but I'd been participating in sports, like soccer, for years, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> that although I was slim, I was well-developed, at least enough so that I could start {{going to the gym}} and start Olympic lifting." [...] However, his official website biography claims that [...] "at 14, he started an intensive training program with Dan Farmer, studied psychology at 15 (to learn more about the power of mind over body) and at 17, officially started his competitive career". During a speech in 2001, he said, [...] "My own plan formed when I was 14 years old. My father had wanted me to be a police officer like he was. My mother wanted me to go to trade school." ...|$|E
2500|$|In August 2001, Fallon Bowman left Kittie. Bowman {{explained}} why {{she left the}} band, saying: [...] "I was unhappy with some things in the band <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> that maybe {{it was time for}} me to depart. I think it was for the best". On October 30, 2001, Kittie released their second album Oracle. Sounding more aggressive than [...] "Spit", the album features elements of death metal and thrash metal. Morgan Lander noted how the band members were only 14 years old when writing their debut album and said [...] "We haven't written in 4 or 5 years." [...] She acknowledged a change in influence from their early days, stating, [...] "Then we listened to bands like Nirvana, Silverchair, and Alice in Chains. Now we listen to stuff like Cannibal Corpse and Nile." [...] However, the band would continue to write in the same fashion by first composing the music and then using that [...] "as the backdrop behind the vocals." [...] The album Oracle was recorded with Morgan Lander as the sole guitarist. Fallon's position as guitarist was filled by Jeff Phillips who worked as Kittie's guitar technician. In 2002, Talena Atfield left the band and was replaced on bass by Jennifer Arroyo. In 2004, the group added guitarist Lisa Marx, and Jeff Phillips went to work full-time on his side project, Thine Eyes Bleed. On July 27, 2004, Kittie released their third studio album Until the End.|$|E

6000|$|Jack waited. The fiery grip of {{the brandy}} relaxed; the genial warmth of it was wafted through him persuasively from head to foot. He took another sip. His eyes began to glitter. [...] "What divine being made this?" [...] he asked. Without waiting to be answered, he tried it again, and emptied the cup. [...] "More!" [...] he cried. [...] "I never <b>felt</b> <b>so</b> big, <b>I</b> never <b>felt</b> <b>so</b> strong, <b>I</b> never <b>felt</b> <b>so</b> clever, as <b>I</b> feel now!" ...|$|R

60|$|Let the {{mangrove}} foliage be as gay {{and green}} as it may--and it is gay and green--a mangrove swamp is a sad, ugly, evil place; and <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> that {{one to be}} that day.|$|E
60|$|I {{could see}} by the {{expression}} of the old man's face that my words had hurt him; but I noticed that he didn't offer to get in himself, and <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> less contrition than I might otherwise.|$|E
60|$|A soft purr, {{like that}} of a great cat, {{indicated}} that Woola understood, and then, with a word to him to follow, I turned to the right along the ledge, but scarcely had <b>I</b> done <b>so</b> than <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> his mighty fangs tugging at my leathern harness.|$|R
60|$|Kantos Kan {{had shown}} me {{a trick of}} gearing, which is known only to the navy of Helium, that greatly {{increased}} the speed of our machines, <b>so</b> that <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> sure <b>I</b> could distance my pursuers if I could dodge their projectiles for a few moments.|$|R

6000|$|... "I thought <b>so.</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> {{sure that}} some {{uncommon}} eye must have picked that girl out. She {{really is a}} marvel. A dolly sort of beauty perhaps," [...] says Miss Volumnia, reserving her own sort, [...] "but in its way, perfect; such bloom I never saw!" ...|$|E
60|$|No {{sense of}} fatigue {{overpowered}} me. I had no wish, after my {{long hours of}} reading and thinking, to lie down and sleep. It was strange, but it was <b>so.</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> as if I had slept, and had now just awakened--a new woman, with a new mind.|$|E

60|$|Her voice sank to a whisper. Her breath fanned my cheek, <b>so</b> that <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> half mad {{with the}} desire to hold her in my arms, if only for a moment. I think that she must have seen the light flash in my eyes, but she ignored it altogether.|$|R
5000|$|Serling later claimed, [...] "I {{was writing}} <b>so</b> much, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> {{had begun to}} lose my {{perspective}} on what was good and what was bad."
