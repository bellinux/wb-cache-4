5000|$|Additional sizing agents, {{including}} resins, glue, or starch, can {{be added}} to the web to alter its characteristics. Sizing improves the paper's water resistance, decreases its ability to fuzz, reduces abrasiveness, and improves its printing properties and surface bond strength. These may be applied at the wet (internal sizing) or on the dry end (surface sizing), or both. At the dry end sizing is usually applied with a <b>size</b> <b>press.</b> The <b>size</b> <b>press</b> may be a roll applicator (flooded nip) or Nozzle applicator [...] It is usually placed before the last dryer section. Some paper machines also make use of a 'coater' to apply a coating of fillers such as calcium carbonate or china clay usually suspended in a binder of cooked starch and styrene-butadiene latex. Coating produces a very smooth, bright surface with the highest printing qualities.|$|E

5000|$|In the dry {{end of the}} {{papermaking}} process, {{the paper}} web is rewetted with a starch based solution. The process is called surface sizing. Starches used have been chemically, or enzymatically depolymerized at the paper mill or by the starch industry (oxidized starch). The size/starch solutions are applied to the paper web by means of various mechanical <b>presses</b> (<b>size</b> <b>presses).</b> Together with surface sizing agents the surface starches impart additional strength to the paper web and additionally provide water hold out or [...] "size" [...] for superior printing properties. Starch is also used in paper coatings {{as one of the}} binders for the coating formulations which include a mixture of pigments, binders and thickeners.

40|$|Abstract The {{adaptive}} Helmholtz resonator for decreasing harmonic {{pulsating pressure}} in a low-pressure hydraulic system {{is presented in}} this study. Adaptivity is executed by both open loop and closed loop controls so that continuous - 20 dB attenuation of the peak-to-peak value of the amplitude of pressure is reached. The study begins by a theory review including the theory of effective bulk modulus, sound velocity measurements, adjustable dynamic vibration absorbers and control methods of dynamic vibration absorbers. The main target of the paper, the Helmholtz resonator, is presented in its own chapter, albeit it is noted to be one application of the dynamic vibration absorber. The review is completed by the analytical model of the hydraulic pipe with a T-filter or Helmholtz resonator. After the theory review, the test equipment and its characteristics are presented. The main parts of the test equipment were a main pipe and an adjustable Helmholtz resonator, which were both developed for this study. Certain properties of the hydraulic oils used were determined experimentally to increase understanding of the system. The experimental section includes sound velocity measurements, sonic bulk modulus definitions, measurements of the resonant frequencies of the adaptive Helmholtz resonator in the test equipment, and tests of the open loop and closed loop control of the resonator. Control is verified to maintain - 20 dB attenuating of pressure pulsations in the system. The presented Helmholtz resonator and controls are available for installation into a hydraulic system to damp out harmonic vibrations at low frequency. For example, the roll in the <b>size</b> <b>press</b> of a paper machine might become excited to vibrate at its resonance frequency after the paper wad has washed through the nip. In that case, tuned Helmholtz resonators in the hydraulic cylinders of the <b>size</b> <b>press</b> would damp out the pulsating pressures, and if the resonators are adaptive, as presented in this study, they can operate in a wider frequency range...|$|E
40|$|Abstract：A fatty acid-starch complex was {{prepared}} to apply in the linerboard surface treatment (sizing). Compared with the raw corn starch and commercial <b>size</b> <b>press</b> cationic starch, the fatty acid-starch complex displayed better water resistance, higher tensile strength and higher bending stiffness of treated samples. Two different fatty acids of C 16 like palmitic acid and C 18 like stearic acid were compared. Both C 16 and C 18 fatty acids showed similar results. Small amount of clay addition to the complex could increase the tensile strength and bending stiffness of sized samples, while keeping the good water resistance. PCC also could increase the tensile strength with {{the small amount of}} addition to the fatty acid-starch complex as surface sizing agent in our study. The SEM pictures of surface treated samples using the complex with and without clay and PCC were taken and the bonding characteristics and surface film formation were investigated...|$|E
40|$|In this study, microfibrillated {{cellulose}} (MFC) {{was applied}} {{in an aqueous}} suspension as a coating material on paper substrates. Two different coating techniques were used: rod coating and <b>size</b> <b>press.</b> The MFC suspension used has a high water content and water is known to deteriorate {{the properties of the}} paper, so water treated paper substrates were prepared as references to give an indication of the effects that the processing has on the final properties of the coated papers. The structure of the MFC coating and associated surface properties were evaluated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and by measuring the thickness and the roughness of the coated substrates. A tool to visualise the distribution of the MFC was developed and the tensile properties ofthe MFC coated substrates were characterised. Resistance to air, oxygen and water vapour permeationas well as water and grease absorption were used to describe the barrier properties of the coated papers. The MFC coated paper substrates exhibited a higher roughness than the reference paper substrate. This was due to the sensitivity of the substrate to water and not from the coating material it self since the water treated paper substrates showed an even higher roughness than the MFC coated substrates. The latter showed slightly increased tensile properties compared to the reference paper substrates, and most importantly, reduced air permeance and grease absorption (- 100 % and - 84 % respectively); for the rod coated paper substrate with 3 g⁄m 2 coat weight. The water vapour transmission rate was also decreased with the applied MFC coatings. Advantages and drawbacks were identified for the coating techniques. The rod coating allowed a good control of the coat weight in a range of 1 to 3 g⁄m 2. However, the Mayer rod and the high viscosity of the MFC suspension caused poor MFC distribution and a coating which reproduced the rod pattern. With the <b>size</b> <b>press,</b> coat weights around 1 g⁄m 2 were reached. The MFC did not build a coating layer on the paper substrate surface but was impregnated into the paper substrate by the rollers...|$|E

40|$|Fluorescent {{whitening}} agents (FWAs) are {{the most}} widely used functional chemicals for the manufacture of printing and writing grades of paper. FWAs are used as internal or external additives for the surface treatment on the <b>size</b> <b>press</b> and coater. In spite of the extensive use of FWAs, no method has been established to analyze the FWA content in process water and paper products. Samples are typically exposed to UV light in order to detect the presence of FWAs. This method is based on the fluorescence exhibited by FWAs under a UV-lamp. The observation of fluorescence with the naked eye is highly subjective. Thus, it is essential to develop a more scientific and objective to the quantitative analysis of FWA optical effects. Water and paper samples containing FWAs were prepared in a laboratory. Quantitative analysis was carried out with a spectrofluorometer, a spectrophotometer, and an image restoration microscope. Using these analytical instruments, fluorescence was observed. Regression equations were obtained from the relationship between the fluorescence intensity and the FWA optical effects of the samples...|$|E
40|$|The {{yellowing}} {{of mechanical}} pulps {{is a major}} drawback that limits them mainly {{to the production of}} lower value products. To prevent the yellowing, one method consists in applying specific molecules, yellowing inhibitors, directly onto the pulp. Yellowing inhibitors can be added in the pulp stock, on the wet-web or even at the <b>size</b> <b>press</b> of the papermaking process. The affinity of yellowing inhibitors for pulp and their adsorption kinetics are important in the determination of the optimal process strategy. It is the objective of this study to quantify the adsorption of inhibitors on pulp and to elucidate their adsorption mechanism. First, a method for characterising the affinity of model yellowing inhibitors for pulp has been tested. Two inhibitors were used: a sulfonated inhibitor and a quaternary ammonium inhibitor. The sorption of two dyes was investigated to elucidate the adsorption mechanism. Brilliant yellow, an anionic direct dye, has a low affinity for pulp fibers while toluidine blue, a cationic basic dye, has a high affinity for pulp fibers. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{application}} of fillers {{at the surface}} of cellulosic paper is an interesting and industrially-commercialized but not very well-known concept, in which the filler particles are essentially added to the voids of the fibrous matrixes.

As an easily practicable process, surface filling has some advantages over direct wet-end addition of fillers, such as minimizing the adverse effects of filler addition on paper strength. Efficient surface filling is somewhat dependent on the specific characteristics of both fillers and fibrous matrixes. Surface filling may provide interesting possibilities for the papermaking discipline; for example, it would open the door to maximizing the cost-effectiveness of paper mills, and efficiently adding new functionalities to cellulosic paper. From both practical and fundamental points of view, systematic exploration and understanding of surface filling of cellulosic paper would be of great significance to the papermaking industry...|$|E
