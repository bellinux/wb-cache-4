40|$|The {{introduction}} of information technology, or IT, has brought increased possibilities to work {{outside of the}} traditional office. One of these possibilities is telework. Telework refers to work carried out away from the usual place of business, often via electronic means. This investigation provides a unique contribution {{to the lack of}} empirical studies on telework in France. Despite its predicted growth, telework has not developed in the French public sector. This study uses role set analysis to assess the experiences of part-time teleworkers (who telework on average two days per week as part of their full-time schedules) at the Conseil Général du Finistère, or CGF, a regional government in Brittany, France. Role set analysis claims that the expectations of role <b>set</b> <b>holders</b> can be evaluated. In this exploratory case study, role <b>set</b> <b>holders</b> are represented by teleworkers, their non-teleworking colleagues and their line managers. Questionnaires, containing attitude scales and open-ended questions, were distributed in three versions to each group of role <b>set</b> <b>holders</b> to gather data. The use of frequency tables and the extraction of Meaning Units, or MUs, indicated perceived advantages and disadvantages of telework, which were revealed through the lenses of role expectations. Teleworkers experienced more advantages due to role complexity: temporal and spatial flexibility were beneficial to teleworkers, despite increased difficulties for non-teleworking colleagues and line managers. Non-teleworkers experienced more disadvantages due to increased role expectations: working with part-time teleworkers generated increased logistical and co-ordination difficulties. Line managers experienced more disadvantages due to multiplied role expectations: managing teleworkers and non-teleworkers in the same departments meant increased burdens in terms of work organisation, control and resentment from non-teleworkers. From an academic viewpoint, the analysis of role sets through a tripartite perspective brings to light thresholds which regulate perceived advantages and disadvantages of telework and reveals that role <b>set</b> <b>holders</b> do not interact in a static fashion. In terms of business practice, the findings argue that telework upsets work relationships in the French context because it relies on less face-to-face contact. Results also suggest that despite the perceived success of the telework programme, the CGF has not adopted a remote working culture...|$|R

40|$|Napkin <b>Holders</b> <b>Set</b> {{comprises}} six napkin holders in {{sterling silver}} {{designed specifically for}} the exhibition ‘Fit for Purpose’ and bears the unique hallmarks for the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee year. De Quin exhibited the object within a group show of contemporary silverwork by members of Contemporary British Silversmiths. De Quin’s piece represents her response to the exhibition title ‘Fit for Purpose’. The exhibition was displayed within the V&A’s Silver Galleries and was timed {{to coincide with the}} V&A’s major exhibition ‘British Design 1948 to 2012 : Innovation in the Modern Age’ (2012). ‘Fit For Purpose’ was designed to function as a complementary display. The object captures de Quin’s interest in exploring the traditional technique of chasing {{within the context of a}} design that considers the demands of functional tableware for contemporary dining. De Quin first used this technique in a one-off work, Tall and Small, in which decorative elements in non-precious metal are used as a passive device for considering the scale, proportion and orientation of two precious-metal vessels. The elements take the form of single curved walls, contrasting with the more complex form of the two containers. Napkin <b>Holders</b> <b>Set</b> uses chasing as both decorative and functional form. Containment offers an opening that requires the fit of a folded napkin to complete it within a table <b>setting.</b> Napkin <b>Holders</b> <b>Set</b> is given added dimension through the use of a hardwood stand which considers the practice of storage and offers additional opportunity for display when the pieces are not in use. This research extends the formal experiments of Enclosure (de Quin REF Output 3), bringing contemporary innovation to the more traditional silverware design of the V&A displays and collection.
