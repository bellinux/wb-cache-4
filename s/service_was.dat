5|$|All {{day train}} <b>service</b> <b>was</b> {{restored}} from Burlington to Whitby, and peak <b>service</b> <b>was</b> finally brought to Oshawa in 2000, {{but this would}} be only one indicator of things to come. A large initiative to expand the GO Transit network in the mid-2000s under the GO Transit Rail Improvement Plan, or GO TRIP. $1 billion was invested in multiple rail and bus projects, making it the largest commuter rail project in Canadian history. This was later dwarfed by a further slate of new GO infrastructure proposed in MoveOntario 2020, the provincial transit plan announced by Premier Dalton McGuinty in the leadup to the 2007 provincial election. With significant re-investment in regional transit, GO experienced significant growth in its train network: all day <b>service</b> <b>was</b> restored to Oshawa in 2006 and Aldershot in 2007; <b>service</b> <b>was</b> expanded to Barrie South in 2007, to Lincolnville in 2008 and to Kitchener in 2011; and an excursion train now operates on summer weekends to Niagara Falls.|$|E

5|$|Discussion about {{splitting}} the route into two {{started in the}} early in 1960s. The Public Roads Administration {{felt that it was}} unnecessary to have a cross-fjord service, as at the time there was a road from Vangshylla to Levanger which sufficed. The administration was also in the process of building a road from Kjerringvik to Venneshamn, which would allow the ferry to drop that service. On 1 June 1964, the <b>service</b> <b>was</b> split in two: VangshyllaâKjerringvik and HokstadâLevanger. At the same time, the <b>service</b> <b>was</b> upgraded to a national road connection, and the full responsibility for funding was transferred to the ministry. The VangshyllaâKjerringvik <b>service</b> <b>was</b> taken over by Innherredsferja, while the HokstadâLevanger <b>service</b> <b>was</b> taken over by Innherredsferja II. In 1968, the state granted sufficient guarantees to allow a new ferry to be purchased. In the same year, the road from Framverran via Venneshamn to Kjerringvik was opened. The new ferry was similar to Innherredsferja II; it was built in Kristiansund for NOK1,555,000 and originally named Skarnsund. Innherredsferja was sold to an operator in Agder for NOK50,000. At the same time, Fremverran and Venneshamn were transferred from the municipality of Verran to Mosvik, while YtterÃ¸y, Skogn and Frol merged with Levanger.|$|E
