Jay-Z said he was inspired by the power of Kuti's work and his life story, which resulted in his interest to help produce the musical.

Wet clutches, however, tend to lose some energy to the liquid. Since the surfaces of a wet clutch can be slippery (as with a motorcycle clutch bathed in engine oil), stacking multiple clutch discs can compensate for the lower coefficient of friction and so eliminate slippage under power when fully engaged.The Hele-Shaw clutch was a wet clutch that relied entirely on viscous effects, rather than on friction.|$|R

The IBR-KS is similar to the OBKS except that the optimization is relative to the prior distribution π(θ). To design an IBR-KS, one can use the OBKS equations in Table 1 with expectations relative to the prior distribution rather than the posterior distribution. Therefore, for the IBR-KS the MCMC step is not needed. The IBR-KS approach provides optimal <b>smoothing</b> <b>performance</b> relative to the prior distribution.|$|R
40|$|Visually guided {{catch-up}} saccades {{during the}} pursuit of a moving target are highly influenced by <b>smooth</b> pursuit <b>performance.</b> For example, the decision to execute a saccade and its amplitude is driven by the difference in velocity between the eye and the target. In previous studies, we have demonstrated that the predictive saccades that occur during the blanking of the moving target compensate for the variability of the smooth pursuit response. Therefore, we wondered whether the predictive smooth pursuit response during target blanking influenced the occurrence of predictive saccades, which is the case for visually guided catch-up saccades. To answer this question, we asked subjects to track visually a target moving along a circular path. From time to time, the target was unexpectedly blanked for some randomized durations and disappeared from the screen. Surprisingly, we did not find any differences in <b>smooth</b> pursuit <b>performance</b> between the blanks that did and those that did not contain predictive saccades. In addition, during the blanks, the differences in <b>smooth</b> pursuit <b>performance</b> across the sessions or across the subjects did not correlate with the differences in the number of predictive saccades. Therefore, this study demonstrates that <b>smooth</b> pursuit <b>performance</b> does not influence the occurrence of predictive saccades. We interpret these results in light of the possible minimization of position error at target reappearance, which heavily depends on the saccadic amplitudes but not on their timing. status: publishe...|$|R
