40|$|Certain ergolines are potent and {{selective}} 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HTh receptor antagonists. Previous studies with two ergoline esters, LY 53857 and <b>sergolexole,</b> documented their potency as 5 -HT 2 receptor antagonists and their metabolism in rats {{to a less}} active metabolite, 1 -isopropyl dihydrolysergic acid. LY 21 5840, an ergoline amide, {{has been identified as}} a potent 5 -HT 2 receptor antagonist that is not hydrolyzed to 1 -isopropyl dihydrolysergic acid. In the rat jugular vein, LY 2 I 5840 (3 x 1 to 1 O M) blocked 5 -HT 2 receptors mediating contraction to 5 -HT in vitro. After i. v. and p. o. administration to rats, LY 21 5840 was a potent 5 -HT 2 receptor antagonist, documented by its ability to block the pressor response to 5 -HT administered i. v. Furthermore, after i. v. and p. o. administration of LY 215840, blockade of vascular 5 -HT 2 receptors persisted in excess of 2 and 6 hr, respectively...|$|E
