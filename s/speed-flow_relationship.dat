40|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} the <b>speed-flow</b> <b>relationship</b> for a highway section, a number of parameters must be estimated. These include the free-speed, speed-at-capacity, the capacity, as well as the jam density. Due to fluctuations in demand, variations in driver behaviour, as well as geometric and environmental conditions, these parameter values may vary both spatially for different stations and temporally for different days. If these speed-flow relationships are to be utilized to estimate link travel times, diversion capacities, or {{if they are to be}} used in incident detection algorithms, it is important that these spatial and temporal variations in the <b>speed-flow</b> <b>relationship</b> be quantified so that accurate estimates of the relevant traffic parameters can be made. This paper presents a statistical analysis of the variability of free-speed estimates for 24 stations along a section of I- 4 in Orlando, Florida during a four month time period. This analysis is a first step in performing similar analyses of capacity, speed-at-capacity, and jam density.

40|$|The Swedish Road Administration is {{planning}} to install median barriers on narrow two-lane rural roads with paved carriageway widths down to 9 m. Overtaking lanes will be added on the road sections where barriers are installed. The added overtaking lanes {{will make it possible}} to overtake on at least 15 per cent of the road length. The narrow roads with median barrier will therefore mostly get one lane per direction. The result will be a "sparse" 2 + 1 -road as opposed to the conventional Swedish 2 + 1 -design with a continuous overtaking lane that is alternating between the two driving directions. VTI has, by commission of the Swedish Road Administration, constructed <b>speed-flow</b> <b>relationships</b> for "sparse" 2 + 1 -roads with different percentages of the road lengths including an overtaking lane.

40|$|Speed-flow {{relationships}} {{have traditionally been}} used to describe non-interrupted traffic operations on basic freeway segments. Such relationships typically show that when traffic flow is stable, speed reduces as traffic flow increases up to the maximum flow or capacity of the freeway. However, when traffic flow is unstable, the inverse of the above relationships is obtained. In this paper, an innovative approach to the traditional <b>speed-flow</b> <b>relationship</b> is discussed. It is shown that the traffic on freeways can be analysed in terms of travelling queues or platoons. The queue or platoon lengths are dependent on the traffic flow and it is therefore possible to develop queue length- flow relationships. Speeds {{can be related to}} the queue length and it is therefore possible to develop speed-queue relationships. The combination of these relationships provides the traditional <b>speed-flow</b> <b>relationship.</b> The advantage of the queuing approach is that {{it can be used to}} explain and clarify many of the operational characteristics of freeways. Queues or platoons form because of speed differentials between fast and slow vehicles. Faster vehicles therefore travel at lower speeds in these queues with the result that the average speed of the traffic stream reduces. Long queues create the problem that any disturbances along a freeway typically result in shock waves within the queues and in unstable flow. Various factors can contribute to such unstable flows, such as accidents and other incidents. Mostly, however, unstable flow occurs typically at interchanges where large volumes of traffic enter the freeway or where queues of traffic spill back from the interchange onto the freeway. Unstable flow can also occur on steep upgrades on which climbing lanes have not been provided. 1...|$|E

40|$|AbstractVariable {{speed limits}} are applied {{on a number}} of heavily trafficked freeway {{sections}} in Germany. Besides the impact on road safety, variable speed limits harmonize traffic flow at high volumes and hence influence freeway capacity. The paper reports empirical findings obtained for several freeway sections with different speed control conditions in Germany. The capacity of each cross section is determined by analyzing the <b>speed-flow</b> <b>relationship</b> as well as by applying methods for stochastic capacity analysis. The results show that the main effect of variable speed limits is a significantly reduced variance of the capacity distribution function. Hence, the application of variable speed limits leads to a lower risk of a traffic breakdown at moderate volumes. In highway capacity guidelines, this effect can be considered by applying different thresholds of LOS E for freeway sections with and without variable speed limits...|$|E

The following paper explores and statistically verifies these variations using detector data and a combination of complementary techniques based on data collected for 30 days at 27 detector stations in May of 1994 along the Queen Elizabeth Way freeway near Toronto, Ontario. The analysis indicates that considerable volume dependencies exist at each site, and that these dependencies are site-specific.

Analytical demand functions tailed for congestion pricing are, however, difficult to establish in practice even with advanced transport modeling techniques.

We propose such an iterative toll adjustment procedure based on the method of successive averages, and present a rigorous theoretical proof of its convergence. The iterative procedure presented here allows for a traffic planner to estimate easily the socially optimal congestion tolls in a network without resorting to demand functions. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

However, traffic operations on long steep downgrades on two-lane highways are becoming increasingly important due to increasing volumes and the higher percent of slow moving vehicles such as recreational vehicles and heavy trucks in the traffic stream.

Compared with regular freeway facilities, HOT lane systems demonstrate unique characteristics in facility capacity, driver behavior, travel pattern, demand modeling, and trip reliability. This study aims at conducting a comprehensive performance analysis on two representative HOT lane systems of State Route 167 in Washington and I- 394 MnPass in Minnesota based on the field data collected from traffic sensors and transponder toll tags. Performance measurements are proposed to quantify the quality of service for HOT lane operations.

Since {{the presence of other}} drivers affects the latter two cost components and hence the Nash equilibrium speed, a 'behavioural' <b>speed-flow</b> <b>relationship</b> results for which external congestion costs include expected accident costs and fuel costs, in addition to the time costs considered in the conventional model. It is demonstrated that the latter in fact even cancel in the calculation of optimal congestion tolls. The overall welfare optimum in our model is found to be off the speed-flow function, and off the average and marginal cost functions derived from it in the conventional approach. This full optimum requires tolls to be either accompanied by speed policies, or to be set as a function of speed.

Five airflow estimation methods were studied. The Reference Method was a fan corrected airflow to fan corrected speed calibration from an uninstalled engine test. In-flight airflow estimation methods utilized the average, or individual, inlet duct static- to total-pressure ratios, and the average fan-discharge static-pressure to average inlet total-pressure ratio. Correlations were established at low distortion conditions for each method relative to the Reference Method. A range of distorted inlet flow conditions were obtained from - 10 deg. to + 60 deg. angle of attack and - 7 deg. to + 11 deg. angle of sideslip. The individual inlet duct pressure ratio correlation resulted in a 2. 3 percent airflow spread for all distorted flow levels with a bias error of - 0. 7 percent. The fan discharge pressure ratio correlation gave results with a 0. 6 percent airflow spread with essentially no systematic error. Inlet-generated total-pressure distortion and turbulence had no significant impact on the P 404 -GE 400 engine airflow pumping. Therefore, a <b>speed-flow</b> <b>relationship</b> may provide the best airflow estimate for a specific engine under all flight conditions...|$|E
40|$|Evaluation of the {{efficiency}} of congestion relief schemes on expressways has generally been based on average travel time analysis. However, road authorities are {{much more interested in}} knowing the possible impacts of improvement schemes on safety and travel time reliability prior to implementing them in real conditions. A methodology is presented to estimate travel time reliability based on modeling travel time variations as a function of demand, capacity and weather conditions. For a subject expressway segment, patterns of demand and capacity were generated for each 5 -minute interval over a year by using the Monte-Carlo simulation technique, and accidents were generated randomly according to traffic conditions. A whole year analysis was performed by comparing demand and available capacity for each scenario and shockwave analysis was used to estimate the queue length at each time interval. Travel times were estimated from refined <b>speed-flow</b> <b>relationships</b> and buffer time index was estimated as a measure of travel time reliability. it was shown that the estimated reliability measures and predicted number of accidents are very close to observed values through empirical data. After validation, the methodology was applied {{to assess the impact of}} two alternative congestion relief schemes on a subject expressway segment. one alternative was to open the hard shoulder to traffic during the peak period, while the other was to reduce the peak period demand by 15 %. The extent of improvements in travel conditions and safety, likewise the reduction in road users' costs after implementing each improvement scheme were estimated. it was shown that both strategies can result in up to 23 % reduction in the number of occurred accidents and significant improvements in travel time reliability. Finally, the advantages and challenging issues of selecting each improvement scheme were discussed...|$|R
30|$|An {{understanding}} of the fundamental relationship between flow - speed - density {{is important in the}} planning, design and operation of pedestrian facilities. The shape of the fundamental diagram is characterised by type of facility, gender, age, space requirements for the pedestrians and so on. In the early stage of pedestrian research, linear relationship between speed - density was assumed but with different linear relationships for different type of pedestrians. The linear speed-density relationship was used to develop a speed-space relationship and finally converted into <b>speed-flow</b> and flow-density <b>relationship</b> [1].|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to gain in-depth knowledge of speed relationships for urban streets. The speed characteristics were examined using a number of methods for data collection. Throughout the research, a special focus was placed on capturing the influence on driver speed of interactions with pedestrians, cyclists and other road users, called sidefriction events in this study. First, driver behaviour and travel time data was collected from field and driving simulator studies for a range of street types and traffic conditions. The collected data was used to calibrate a microscopic traffic simulation model. Production runs with this model were performed for various traffic conditions. Second, aggregated speed data was collected at the link level, i. e. the macro level, for three street types. In combination with street site variables, speed and flow data was analysed using multiple regression techniques with space mean speed as dependent variable. This analysis was also performed for average travel speed data produced by microscopic traffic simulation. Two central results were attained and utilized for the model development: - In-depth knowledge of which factors influence speed choice on urban street links with minor intersections, on a micro and macro level. - A comprehensive research methodology for study of speed characteristics on urban streets in which the knowledge gained at the micro and macro level was applied. Results from the micro study showed that Average number of crossing pedestrians and Traffic flow had significant impact on average travel speed (R 2 = 0. 91). Results from the macro study performed for three street types showed that Street function and Number of lanes also had a high degree of explanation (R 2 close to 0. 70). The variables Separated bicycle lane, Roadside parking permitted and Number of minor intersections per 1 km were significant for some of the street types modelled in the macro study. The variables Ratio of through vehicles and Gender of the driver were also investigated and were found not to influence space-mean speed. The macro study demonstrated that speed choice and driver behaviour were consistent for each street type investigated regardless of city type and population size. The <b>speed-flow</b> <b>relationships</b> of the micro model for an urban street type showed good agreement with the macro model for traffic flows in the upper range. In conclusion, the research effort showed that the included side-friction variables added explanatory value to the estimation of speed, and thus can enhance the knowledge of traffic impacts of different urban street designs.
