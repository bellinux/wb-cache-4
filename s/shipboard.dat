5|$|On 15 February 1960, Triton went to sea to do a final {{check of}} all <b>shipboard</b> equipment. Except for a {{malfunctioning}} wave-motion sensor, Triton was deemed {{ready for her}} shakedown cruise.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the episode, {{concerns}} arise over <b>shipboard</b> fraternization. After Captain Janeway and Chakotay (Robert Beltran) {{discuss whether}} {{the ship is}} an appropriate place to raise children, Ensign Samantha Wildman (Nancy Hower) announces that she is pregnant by her husband, who {{is still in the}} Alpha Quadrant.|$|E
5|$|Drache {{was also}} used for <b>shipboard</b> trials with the Flettner Fl 282 Kolibri (Hummingbird) helicopter. She {{embarked}} the V6 and V10 prototypes for a period in 1942 and in January–February 1943. They used the small platform abaft the funnel to take-off and land. The Kriegsmarine (German navy) wished to evaluate their potential for anti-submarine warfare and mine reconnaissance, but visual detection proved to be possible only in clear weather.|$|E
5|$|During the 1980s naval {{versions}} of the AH-64A for the United States Marine Corps and Navy were examined. Multiple concepts were studied with altered landing gear arrangements, improved avionics and weapons. The USMC was very interested and conducted a two-week evaluation of the Apache in September 1981, including <b>shipboard</b> operation tests.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, {{there were}} two further fatal crashes, killing a total of 19 marines, and the V-22 was again {{grounded}} while the cause of these crashes was investigated and various parts were redesigned. In June 2005, the V-22 successfully completed its final operational evaluation; this had included long range deployments, high altitude, desert and <b>shipboard</b> operations. The problems identified in various accidents had reportedly been addressed.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, the EH101 {{was entered}} into a Canadian {{competition}} to replace the <b>shipboard</b> Sea King fleet, but the Sikorsky CH-148 Cyclone was selected. In 2013, following difficulties with the CH-148 procurement, the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) {{was reported to be}} seriously considering canceling the contract with Sikorsky and was investigating the possibility of procuring the AW101 instead.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s the United States Maritime Administration funded {{a special}} program to train a {{contingent}} of 50 Seattle firefighters to provide land-based support in the control and extinguishing of dockside and <b>shipboard</b> conflagrations. The effort, which was studied by the Stanford Research Institute, later became {{a model for other}} waterfront cities.|$|E
5|$|Mackintosh's first Antarctic {{experience}} was as second officer on Shackleton's Nimrod Expedition, 1907–09. Shortly {{after his arrival}} in the Antarctic, a <b>shipboard</b> accident destroyed his right eye, and he {{was sent back to}} New Zealand. He returned in 1909 to participate in the later stages of the expedition; his will and determination in adversity impressed Shackleton, and led to his Ross Sea party appointment in 1914.|$|E
5|$|Only one of {{the small}} {{detachment}} of marines on board participated in the mutiny. While the half-dozen remaining were too outnumbered and taken by surprise to fulfill their role of <b>shipboard</b> police and oppose the mutineers, they did insist on being treated as prisoners of war by the Spanish and were accordingly exchanged six months later, along with the surviving warrant officers.|$|E
5|$|Starting 10 December 2011, the USS Iowa {{was open}} for weekend tours. The Battleship Expo at the Port of Richmond {{included}} <b>shipboard</b> access and other exhibits such as 16-inch shells, a short {{film about the}} battleship, and other exhibits. On 30 April 2012, the USS Iowa was officially donated to the Pacific Battleship Center in Los Angeles by the United States Navy.|$|E
5|$|The German-built {{seaplane}} tender Zmaj {{was commissioned}} into the KJRM in 1930, but was {{converted to a}} minelayer in 1937. Captured by the Germans in April 1941, she saw service in the seaplane tender, aircraft rescue and troop transport roles as Drache. In late 1942, she was re-commissioned as a minelayer, and was used for <b>shipboard</b> trials with helicopters in 1943 before being sunk in September 1944.|$|E
5|$|Among the Strangers were Myles Standish, {{who was the}} colony's {{military}} leader; Christopher Martin, who {{had been}} designated by the Merchant Adventurers to act as <b>shipboard</b> governor during the trans-Atlantic trip; and Stephen Hopkins, a veteran of a failed colonial venture that may have inspired Shakespeare's The Tempest. The group who later became the Leiden Leaders after the merging of ships included John Carver, William Bradford, Edward Winslow, William Brewster, and Isaac Alberton.|$|E
5|$|On one 1903 voyage, a young officer named Charles Lightoller was {{assigned}} to crew Suevic as a punishment. During the voyage, he met an 18-year-old woman who was returning to her home in Sydney, and after a <b>shipboard</b> courtship, the two were married in Sydney on 15 December 1903. Lightoller would later become the second officer on board the RMS Titanic, and the most senior of her crew to survive the disaster.|$|E
5|$|Prince of Wales {{remained}} {{anchored in}} Sydney Cove {{for five months}} after her voyage, while her stores were unloaded. A <b>shipboard</b> inspection during this time found her hull was rotten with shipworm and on 23 May 1788 she was careened on the beach for repairs. In July she was released from government service and set sail for England on the 14th of that month, in convoy with her First Fleet sister ships Alexander, Borrowdale and Friendship, and under the overall command of Lieutenant John Shortland in Alexander.|$|E
5|$|Prior to any {{transfer}} of cargo, the chief officer must develop a transfer plan detailing {{specifics of the}} operation such as how much cargo will be moved, which tanks will be cleaned, and how the ship's ballasting will change. The next step before a transfer is the pretransfer conference. The pretransfer conference covers issues such as what products will be moved, the order of movement, names and titles of key people, particulars of <b>shipboard</b> and shore equipment, critical states of the transfer, regulations in effect, emergency and spill-containment procedures, watch and shift arrangements, and shutdown procedures.|$|E
5|$|The Dutch Navy {{had already}} {{acquired}} {{a quantity of}} the Hispano Suiza 20mm guns before the war for mounting in torpedo boats and other craft and 6 of these were mounted in the cruiser Jacob van Heemskerck when she made her escape to Britain in 1940. The Hispano fired similar 20 × 110 ammunition to the Oerlikon but had a higher rate of fire and slightly higher muzzle velocity. The Hispano Suiza however was to prove insufficiently durable for <b>shipboard</b> use and would find its niche as a highly successful aircraft gun.|$|E
5|$|The Martin AM Mauler (originally XBTM) was a single-seat <b>shipboard</b> attack {{aircraft}} {{built for}} the United States Navy. Designed during World War II, the Mauler encountered development delays and did not enter service until 1948 in small numbers. The aircraft proved troublesome and remained in frontline service only until 1950, when the Navy switched to the smaller and simpler Douglas AD Skyraider. Maulers remained in reserve squadrons until 1953. A few were built as AM-1Q electronic-warfare aircraft with an additional crewman in the fuselage.|$|E
5|$|After {{one final}} match in Adelaide, {{which was the}} last time South Australia needed odds (i.e., extra men) to compete, the {{tourists}} left Melbourne on 11 March 1884 aboard the P & O steamer Sutlej and arrived at Plymouth on 29 April. With a programme of 32 fixtures arranged, the first game in England began on 12 May at Sheffield Park, Uckfield and the last game against the South of England was completed on 12 September. The team travelled home on the SS Mirzapore and reached Melbourne again in early November. Murdoch enjoyed a <b>shipboard</b> romance on the return voyage with an heiress called Jemima Watson whom he married at Fitzroy, Victoria in December, only {{a few weeks after the}} Mirzapore berthed.|$|E
5|$|Among {{her most}} famous roles were Anna Leonowens {{in the film}} version of the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical The King and I (1956); and {{opposite}} Cary Grant as his <b>shipboard</b> romantic interest Terri McKay in the bittersweet love story An Affair to Remember (1957). She reunited with Grant and Mitchum for a sophisticated comedy, The Grass Is Greener (1960), and then joined Dean Martin and Frank Sinatra in a love triangle for a romantic comedy, Marriage on the Rocks (1965). In 1966, the producers of Carry On Screaming! offered her a fee comparable to that paid {{to the rest of the}} cast combined, but she turned it down in favor of appearing in an aborted stage version of Flowers for Algernon.|$|E
5|$|Design {{work on the}} Type 34-class destroyers {{began in}} 1932, around the time that Weimar Germany renounced the {{armament}} limitations of the Versailles Treaty that had ended World War I. Initial designs were for large ships {{more powerful than the}} French and Polish destroyers then in service, but the design grew as the Kriegsmarine now expected it to serve as a small cruiser. The design work appears to have been rushed and not well-thought out as the short forecastle and lack of flare at the bow compromised the ships' seakeeping ability and their stability was inadequate. The only real innovative part of the design, the high-pressure boilers, were an over-complicated design that received almost no <b>shipboard</b> testing before being installed in the Type 34s and frequently broke down throughout the life of the ships.|$|E
5|$|During {{the spring}} of 1717, Stede Bonnet {{decided to become a}} pirate, despite having no {{knowledge}} of <b>shipboard</b> life. He contracted a local shipyard to build him a sixty-ton sloop, which he equipped with ten guns and named the Revenge. This was unusual, as most pirates seized their ships by mutiny or boarding, or else converted a privateer vessel to a pirate ship. Bonnet enlisted a crew of more than seventy men. He relied on his quartermaster and officer for their knowledge of sailing, and as a result, he was not highly respected by his crew. In another break from tradition, Bonnet paid his crew wages, not shares of plunder as most pirates did. Royal Navy intelligence reported that he departed Carlisle Bay, Barbados under cover of darkness.|$|E
5|$|Ernst Lindemann was {{frustrated}} by the fact that—as commander of the Naval Gunnery School—he would never come into {{direct contact with the}} enemy. When he received the news that he had been selected to be the first commander of the battleship , he was honoured by the trust that had been bestowed on him but doubted that {{he would be able to}} get Bismarck ready for action before the war was over. His doubts suggest that he was confident the war would end in a favourable outcome for Germany by mid-1940. Prior to commanding Bismarck, Lindemann had never held any <b>shipboard</b> command, a situation rare if not unique in the Kriegsmarine. Nevertheless, Lindemann had served exclusively on ships with a gun calibre of at least , and he was Germany's leading gunnery expert. In 1940, he ranked second out of Crew 1913 and was considered an outstanding leader.|$|E
5|$|In ancient Egypt, cats were sacred animals, {{with the}} goddess Bastet often {{depicted}} in cat form, sometimes {{taking on the}} war-like aspect of a lioness. The Romans are often credited with introducing the domestic cat from Egypt to Europe; in Roman Aquitaine, a first- or second-century engraving {{of a young girl}} holding a cat is one of two earliest depictions of the Roman domesticated cat. However, cats possibly were already kept in Europe prior to the Roman Empire, as they may have been present in Britain in the late Iron Age. Domestic cats were spread throughout {{much of the rest of}} the world during the Age of Discovery, as ship's cats were carried on sailing ships to control <b>shipboard</b> rodents and as good-luck charms.|$|E
5|$|The Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) and Load Line (LL 66) {{conventions}} {{focus on}} <b>shipboard</b> safety issues. Originally developed {{in response to}} the sinking of RMS Titanic, SOLAS sets regulations on lifeboats, emergency equipment and safety procedures, including continuous radio watches. It has been updated to include regulations on ship construction, fire protection systems, life-saving appliances, radio communications, safety of navigation, management for the safe operation of ships, and other safety and security concerns. , the Bolivian, Lebanese, and Sri Lankan flags of convenience have not ratified the SOLAS treaty. LL 66 sets standards for minimum buoyancy, hull stress, and ship's fittings, as well as establishing navigational zones where extra precautions must be taken. , the Bolivian, Georgian and Sri Lankan governments have not ratified LL 66.|$|E
5|$|The Yugoslav {{minelayer}} Zmaj (Dragon) {{was built}} in Germany as a seaplane tender for the Royal Yugoslav Navy in 1928–30. She {{does not appear to}} have been much used in that role and was converted to a minelayer in 1937. Captured by the Germans in 1941, she was renamed Drache (Dragon) and redesignated as an aircraft tender and later as a troop transport, before she was rebuilt as a minelayer in 1942. She laid one minefield in 1943 that sank two Allied destroyers and badly damaged a third in the Aegean Sea. Drache was also used by the Germans to evaluate the <b>shipboard</b> use of helicopters for reconnaissance purposes. She was sunk by Allied aircraft in 1944 at Samos and scrapped in place after the end of World War II.|$|E
5|$|The {{start of}} {{production}} is not clear. A commercial transport ship, the Victoria, took {{the cast and crew}} from Seattle, Washington, to Nome, Alaska. There, the schooner Nanuk was rented by the studio to take the production team farther north. Originally known as the Pandora, the schooner would next be used in the 1935 production of Mutiny on the Bounty, and rerigged for the 1937 film Maid of Salem. The Nanuk acted as a mobile base of operations, and as a set for the <b>shipboard</b> scenes. MGM bought the schooner outright during the production. On-screen credits for the film claim filming began in April 1932, but The Hollywood Reporter said it began in July and the New York Times said June.|$|E
5|$|Triton had {{a number}} of {{attributes}} that made her a potential NECPA platform. Her size allowed ample room for additional <b>shipboard</b> systems and personnel accommodations. Her designed speed provided the capability for rapid transit, and her nuclear power plant offered virtually unlimited endurance and range. The Combat Information Center (CIC) provided substantial command and control capabilities as did the communication buoy system that could receive and send radio transmissions while submerged. As she was a submarine, Triton offered superior protection against nuclear-biological-chemical (NBC) contaminants over surface ships or an airborne command centre. However, the record remains unclear if such an explicit NECPA conversion was ever undertaken for Triton.|$|E
5|$|Two <b>shipboard</b> {{accidents}} {{occurred during}} Tritons post-launch fitting-out. On 2 October 1958, {{prior to the}} nuclear reactor fuel being installed, a steam valve failed during testing, causing a large cloud of steam that filled the number two reactor compartment, and on 7 April 1959, a fire broke out during the testing of a deep-fat fryer and spread from the galley into the ventilation lines of the crew's mess. Both incidents, neither nuclear related, were quickly handled by ship personnel, with Lt. Commander Leslie B. Kelly, the prospective chief engineering officer, being awarded the Navy and Marine Corps Medal for his quick action during the incident on 2 October.|$|E
5|$|When {{the first}} {{prototype}} Jaguar flew on 8September1968, {{it was also}} the first flight for the engine. In its initial development the Adour engine had complications with the stability of the afterburner system, and <b>shipboard</b> testing showed slow throttle response times, problematic in the situation of an aborted landing; engine improvements rectified these problems prior to the Jaguar coming into service. In French service, the Jaguars were introduced using the original Mk.101 engine. RAF Jaguars entered service using the Mk.102 engine, mainly featuring better afterburner-throttle control over the Mk.101. The RAF later had its Jaguars re-engined around 1981 with the improved Adour Mk.104, and again in 1999 with the Mk.106, each providing greater performance.|$|E
5|$|With no {{prospect}} of Tony's money, Beaver loses interest in Brenda, who is left adrift and in poverty. Meanwhile, Tony has met an explorer, Dr. Messinger, and joins him on an expedition {{in search of}} a supposed lost city in the Amazon rainforest. On the outward journey, Tony engages in a <b>shipboard</b> romance with Thérèse de Vitré, a young girl whose Roman Catholicism causes her to shun him when he tells her he has a wife. In Brazil, Messinger proves an incompetent organiser; he cannot control the native guides, who abandon him and Tony {{in the depths of the}} jungle. Tony falls ill, and Messinger leaves in their only canoe to find help, but is swept over a waterfall and killed.|$|E
5|$|Following overhaul, Texas resumed duty {{with the}} Atlantic Fleet early in 1919. On 10 March, {{she became the}} first American {{battleship}} to launch an airplane when Lieutenant Commander Edward O. McDonnell flew a British-built Sopwith Camel off the warship. Later in 1919 Texass captain, Nathan C. Twining, successfully employed naval aircraft to spot the fall of shells during a main battery exercise. The results were that aircraft-borne gunfire spotters were significantly more accurate than <b>shipboard</b> spotters. In testimony to the Navy General Board, Lieutenant Commander Kenneth Whiting attested that the increase in gunfire effectiveness with air spotting was likely to be as great as 200%. As a result of these first experiments, the Navy would add floatplanes to all of the fleet's battleships and newer cruisers. In May 1919, Texas served as a plane guard and navigational aid for the successful attempt by Navy Curtiss NC flying boat NC-4 to become the first airplane to cross the Atlantic. On 26 July 1919 Texas entered the Pacific Ocean as part of the newly formed Pacific Fleet and she would spend the next five and half years as a part of Pacific Fleet. On 17 July the following year, she was designated BB-35 under the Navy's newly adopted alpha-numeric system of hull classification symbols.|$|E
5|$|She {{was used}} for {{experiments}} evaluating <b>shipboard</b> operation of seaplanes {{before the start of}} World War I. The ship was based at Brindisi when Italy declared war on the Central Powers on 23 May 1915. That night, the Austro-Hungarian Navy bombarded the Italian coast in an attempt to disrupt the Italian mobilization. Of the many targets, Ancona was hardest hit, with disruptions to the town's gas, electric, and telephone service; the city's stockpiles of coal and oil were left in flames. All of the Austrian ships safely returned to port, putting pressure on the Regia Marina to stop the attacks. When the Austrians resumed bombardments on the Italian coast in mid-June, Admiral Paolo Thaon di Revel responded by sending San Marco and the other armoured cruisers at Brindisi—the navy's newest—to Venice to supplement the older ships already there. Shortly after their arrival at Venice, Amalfi was sunk by a submarine on 7 July and her loss severely restricted the activities of the other ships based at Venice. San Marco later participated in the bombardment of Durazzo (now known as Durrës) on 2 October 1918 which sank one merchantman and damaged two others.|$|E
5|$|The first open {{clash between}} the mutineers and {{officers}} {{came on the}} morning of 3 December, when a small group of sailors gathered on the forecastle and, refusing orders to leave, began to argue with the officers. Captain Eyles asked to know their demands, which were an assurance that Temeraire would not go to the West Indies, but instead would return to England. Eventually Rear Admiral Campbell came down to speak to the men, and having informed them that the officers did not know the destination of the ship, he ordered them to disperse. The men went below decks and the incipient mutiny appeared to have been quashed. The ringleaders, numbering around a dozen, remained determined however, and made discreet inquiries among the rest of the crew. Having eventually determined {{that the majority of the}} crew would, if not actually support a mutiny, at least not oppose it, and that the Temeraires crew would be supported by the ship's marines as well as the crews of some of the other warships in Bantry Bay, they decided to press ahead with their plans. The mutiny began with the crew closing the ship's gunports, effectively barricading themselves below deck. Having done so, they refused orders to open them again, jeered the officers and threatened violence. The crew then came up on deck and once again demanded to know their destination and refused to obey orders to sail for anywhere but England. Having presented their demands they returned below decks and resumed the usual <b>shipboard</b> routine as much as they could.|$|E
