5000|$|A shark with a {{structure}} on its back, {{such as an}} stethacanthid, could not have possibly been a fast swimmer. The first dorsal fin and spine could have produced a considerably amount of drag during fast locomotion. This suggests that Stethacanthids may have been rather sluggish bottom dwellers.

40|$|Objective-Several {{reports have}} shown that the {{direction}} of the postural responses induced by vestibular stimulation is affected by the positions of the neck and torso. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate whether the postural responses to vibratory proprioceptive stimulation of the calf muscles are affected by the position of the head and thus by proprioceptive and vestibular information from the neck and head. Material and Methods-Ten normal subjects were exposed to vibratory proprioceptive stimulation of the calf muscles when the head was maintained in five different positions: in a neutral position facing forwards, with the head turned to the right or left sides or with the <b>head</b> <b>tilted</b> backwards or <b>forwards.</b> Body movements were evaluated by analyzing the anteroposterior and lateral torques induced towards the supporting surface. Results-The analysis showed that only the anteroposterior body sway was significantly affected by the position of the head. The anteroposterior postural responses were primarily increased during the tests with the <b>head</b> <b>tilted</b> backwards or <b>forwards,</b> whereas the postural responses were unaffected by head torsion towards the sides. The lateral responses were primarily affected by vision and not by the position of the head. Conclusions-The findings suggest that the responses evoked by vibratory proprioceptive stimulation of the calf muscles may be affected by different mechanisms, either by purely proprioceptive information or by an interaction between proprioceptive and vestibular information. Moreover, the increasing difference between the test conditions over time suggests that fatigue of the neck muscles may be one of the factors affecting the responses induced by the perturbations...|$|R

50|$|Published {{literature}} on ocular torsion in physiologic ocular counter-roll {{are usually not}} very clear {{on the type of}} <b>head</b> <b>tilt</b> inducing the torsion, i.e., initial <b>head</b> <b>tilt</b> causing a tilt in the SVV or the compensatory <b>head</b> <b>tilt</b> to realign SVV with the true vertical.

40|$|Background: Compensatory ocular counter-torsion (COCT) is {{supposed}} to maintain the eyes aligned with the visual environment following <b>head</b> <b>tilt.</b> Because of some recent controversies the functional capacity of this phenomenon was defined according {{to the extent of}} induced astigmatic axis error following <b>head</b> <b>tilt.</b> Materials and Methods: Objective autorefractometry was performed on 70 eyes with a regular astigmatism of ≥ 2 D at vertical, right <b>head</b> <b>tilt</b> and left <b>head</b> <b>tilt</b> positions of 5 °, 10 °, 15 °, 20 ° and 25 °. Astigmatic axis error was calculated according to the difference between the defined axis at each <b>tilted</b> <b>head</b> position and the defined axis at the vertical head position. A tiltometer was used for this purpose to show the angle of <b>head</b> <b>tilt</b> without disturbing the process of refractometry. Results: The mean astigmatic axis error was 3. 2 ° ± 1. 5 ° and 18. 4 ° ± 4. 2 ° at the <b>head</b> <b>tilt</b> angles of 5 ° and 25 ° respectively. The mean percentage of tilt angle compensation by COCT was 36 % and 26 % at the <b>head</b> <b>tilt</b> angles of 5 ° and 25 ° respectively. There was a direct relation between the <b>head</b> <b>tilt</b> angle and the induced astigmatic axis error (ANOVA, P < 0. 001, 95 % of confidence interval [CI]). Astigmatic axis error values at right <b>head</b> <b>tilt</b> were significantly lower than their corresponding values at left <b>head</b> <b>tilt</b> (ANOVA, P = 0. 04 95 % CI). Conclusion: Any minimal angle of <b>head</b> <b>tilt</b> may cause erroneous measurement of astigmatic axis and should be avoided during refraction. One cannot rely on the compensatory function of ocular counter-torsion during the refraction...|$|R

40|$|When <b>tilting</b> the <b>head</b> {{towards the}} {{shoulder}} {{there are numerous}} mechanisms influencing on the generation and maintenance of ocular counter-roll. Each of these mechanisms has its own temporal and spatial characteristics which influences on the counter-rolled eye position. We described a fast transient anti-compensatory torsion movement (torsion peak) as the first response to the <b>head</b> <b>tilting</b> which most certainly has its origin in the vestibular organ and the utricular maculae. Superimposed on this torsion peak we described nystagmus beats with the fast phase directed {{in the same direction}} as the <b>head</b> <b>tilt</b> movement suggesting a paralleled activation of the vertical semicircular canals. Synchronous with the torsion peak a fast vertical vergence eye movement was seen. The vertical vergence was always with left eye over right eye in the rightward <b>head</b> <b>tilt</b> and always with right eye over left eye the leftward <b>head</b> <b>tilts,</b> thus inducing a physiological skew deviation. The aetiology for this fast vertical vergence response is currently unknown but could probably be explained by a similar vestibular mechanism as for the torsion peak. A substantial amount of ocular counter-rolling (OCR) was a consistent finding in all subjects and test conditions during static <b>head</b> <b>tilt.</b> The OCR increased with <b>head</b> <b>tilt</b> but the relative compensation to the amount of <b>head</b> <b>tilt</b> decreased. For example, a 15 ° <b>head</b> <b>tilt</b> induced 3 ° OCR which corresponds to a gain of 0. 20. A 30 ° <b>head</b> <b>tilt</b> induced an even larger OCR (5 °) which corresponds to a gain of 0. 16. A consistent finding was an OCR disconjugacy of the right and left eye which increased with <b>head</b> <b>tilt.</b> For instance, a rightward <b>head</b> <b>tilt</b> induced a larger ex-cyclo of the left eye than incyclo of the right eye leading to an ex-cyclovergence. The underlying mechanism might be the increased saccular impact in extreme <b>head</b> <b>tilts.</b> Sacculus has been suggested to induce disconjugate OCR while utriculus is thought to induce conjugate OCR. The static <b>head</b> <b>tilt</b> induced a vertical disconjugacy (i. e. vertical vergence) that increased with the <b>head</b> <b>tilt.</b> The direction of the eye position was however not consistent. Some subjects demonstrated a right eye over left eye position in the rightward <b>head</b> <b>tilts</b> while others demonstrated the opposite outcome. This might be explained by a difference in the ocular visual and torsional axes. To maintain binocularity the eyes are forced into vergence and depending on the position of the axes the direction of the vergence movement will differ. When holding the <b>head</b> in a <b>tilted</b> position the torsional position is found to drift. Initially this drift was directed away from the reference position thus increasing the amount of OCR. After a minute the drift was found to change direction and heading towards the reference position, thus decreasing the OCR. The OCR increasing drift might be explained by a decline in the leftward utricular discharge, induced by macula inertia during the initial interaural translation, in favour of the rightward utricular gravitational discharge. The OCR decreasing drift might be explained by an adaptation of the utricular maculae. Other possible explanations might be a leaky neural integrator or a vestibular memory loss which could induce the OCR decreasing drift found during a sustained <b>head</b> <b>tilt...</b>|$|R
