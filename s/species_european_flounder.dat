40|$|Levels of {{polychlorinated biphenyls}} (PCBs), polybrominated {{diphenyl}} ethers (PBDEs) and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) were determined in the sediment {{and in several}} <b>species</b> (<b>European</b> <b>flounder,</b> Platichthys flesus; common sole, Solea solea; Chinese mitten crab, Eriocheir sinensis; shore crab, Carcinus maenas; brown shrimp, Crangon crangon; blue mussel, Mytilus edulis and bristle worms, Polychaeta) from 7 locations in the Scheldt estuary (SE, the Netherlands–Belgium). Overall POP levels in the sediment were low. The average PCB and PBDE concentrations were respectively 31. 5 and 115 ng/g dry weight (dw). The highest sediment loads were measured {{in the vicinity of}} Antwerp (368 ng PCBs/g dw), a location with intense harbor and industrial activities. Pollution concentrations in the tissues of biota were species-specific. European flounder reached the highest contamination levels (from 12. 9 to 285 ng PCBs/g ww, from 0. 25 to 3. 97 ng PBDEs/g ww). The lowest tissue loads were measured in brown shrimp (from 3. 27 to 39. 9 ng PCBs/g ww, from 0. 05 to 0. 47 ng PBDEs/g ww). The PCB congener profile in most of the species was similar to the pattern found in the sediment. PCB 153 was the most abundant congener (16. 5 – 25. 7 % in biota, 10. 4 % in sediment). In the sediment, the total amount of PBDEs consisted of more than 99 % of BDE 209. Congener BDE 47 had the highest concentrations in all sampled species (38. 5 – 70. 1 %). Sediment POP loadings and tissue concentrations were poorly correlated, indicating that a simple linear or non-linear relationship is insufficient to describe this relationship, possible caused by the complexity of the bioaccumulation processes and the variability in exposure. Because of the high PCB levels, regular consumption of fish and seafood, especially mussels, from the Scheldt estuary should be avoided...|$|E
40|$|Hepatocellular fibrillar {{inclusions}} (HFI) are {{an unusual}} pathology of unknown aetiology affecting the flatfish <b>species</b> <b>European</b> <b>flounder</b> (Platichthys flesus) and have previously {{been observed in}} UK estuaries impacted by endocrine disrupting chemicals. Using a multidisciplinary approach, this study explores the hypothesis that induction of vitellogenin {{as a result of}} exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals is associated with the development of HFI. Thus HFI could serve as a potential histological biomarker of endocrine disruption in male P. flesus. Liver samples (n= 200) were collected from P. flesus at selected UK estuaries during autumn 2010, processed for histopathology and examined for incidences of HFI. The prevalence of HFI in UK estuaries was ranked in the following order: Mersey (79. 3 %) > Tyne (78. 6 %) > Thames (63. 6 %) > Medway (44. 7 %) > Humber > (34. 5 %) > Alde (3. 7 %). The severity of HFI was evaluated using a qualitative scoring index and revealed that severity appeared to be more pronounced in those estuaries with higher prevalence of HFI (r= 0. 98). The data also demonstrated that male fish exhibited a higher prevalence of HFI compared to females (p= < 0. 001). No association between HFI and P. flesus age was observed (p= 0. 648). Electron microscopy examination confirmed that HFI were the result of extensive disorganisation and proliferation of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER). The P. flesus from the Mersey and Tyne provided robust biological material for further study and were collectively categorised into biological groups of HFI severity stages. Real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) demonstrated no significant differences between biological groups and transcription of vitellogenin (VtG) (p= 0. 3098) and choriogenin (CHR) (p= 0. 5317). Plasma VtG concentrations greater than 1 µg ml- 1 were only observed in 10 fish during the entire study and 6 of these originated from the Tyne and Mersey (range 1. 7 - 1944. 0 µg ml- 1). The low level of gene transcription accompanied by near background concentrations of plasma VtG made it difficult to identify relationships between gene transcription, HFI formation and protein translation. Despite this, immunohistochemistry (IHC) successfully identified VtG with an immediate association with HFI. The IHC labelling was clear and distinct exhibiting no unspecific binding of primary antibody. This study was unable to confirm previous reports of microtubules within HFI using IHC incorporating a α/β- tubulin polyclonal primary antibody for zebrafish. Whilst this study was unable to provide conclusive evidence concerning the implication of endocrine disruption on HFI development, the detection of VtG within HFI of male fish does highlight endocrine disruption as a potential avenue for future laboratory studies concerning the pathogenesis of HFI. However, until laboratory experiments are able to establish links, {{it is important to remember}} that other mechanisms may still be implicated...|$|E
40|$|A {{survey was}} {{undertaken}} to identify rnetazoan ectoparasite <b>species</b> on the <b>European</b> <b>flounder,</b> Platichthys flexus (Linnaeus, 1758), in 4 different locations off the north-central Portuguese coast. Parasites of 7 different taxa were found: Caligus diaphanus, Caligus sp [...] and Lepeophtheirus pectoralis (Copepoda: Caligidae); Acanthochondria cornuta (Copepoda: Chondracanthidae) Holobomolochus confusus (Copepoda: Bomolochidae) : Nerocila orbignyi (Isopoda: Cymothoidae) : and praniza larvae (Isopoda: Gnathiidae).

40|$|Identifying nursery {{habitats}} is {{of paramount}} importance to define proper management and conservation strategies for flatfish species. Flatfish nursery studies usually report upon habitat occupation, but few attempted to quantify the importance of those habitats to larvae development. The reliance of two sympatric flatfish <b>species</b> larvae, the <b>European</b> <b>flounder</b> Platichthys flesus and the common sole Solea solea, on the estuarine food web (benthic versus pelagic), was determined through carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analysis. The organic matter sources supporting the production of P. flesus and S. solea larvae biomass originates chiefly in the benthic food web. However, these species have significantly different d 13 C and d 15 N values which suggest that they prey on organisms that use a different mixture of sources or assimilate different components from similar OM pools (or both).

40|$|A {{conspicuous}} part of {{the parasite}} fauna of marine fish are ectoparasites, which attach mainly to the fins or gills. The abundant copepods have received much interest due to their negative effects on hosts. However, for many localities the copepod fauna of fish is still poorly known, and we know little about their temporal stability as long-term observations are largely absent. Our study provides the first inventory of ectoparasitic copepods on fish from the western Wadden Sea (North Sea) based on field data from 1968 and 2010 and additional unpublished notes. In total, 47 copepod parasite species have been recorded on 52 fish host species to date. For two copepod <b>species</b> parasitizing the <b>European</b> <b>flounder</b> (Platichthys flesus), a quantitative comparison of infection levels between 1968 and 2010 was possible. Whereas Acanthochondria cornuta did not show {{a change in the}} relationship between host size and infection levels, Lepeophtheirus pectoralis shifted towards the infection of smaller hosts, with higher infection levels in 2010 compared to 1968. These differences probably reflect the biology of the species and the observed decrease in abundance and size of flounders during the last decades. The skin-infecting L. pectoralis can probably compensate for dwindling host abundance by infecting smaller fish and increasing its abundance per given host size. In contrast, the gill cavity inhabiting A. cornuta probably faces a spatial constraint (fixed number of gill arches), thus limiting its abundance and setting a minimum for the host size necessary for infections...|$|R

Morphological {{similarity between the}} two {{makes it difficult to}} identify their hybrids, so species misclassification can generate errors in defining stocks in terms of their conservation and management. Flounder and plaice popu-lations from the North Sea and the Baltic Sea were studied. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) was used to confirm the morphological species identification. The set of molecular markers, two mitochondrial (cytochrome b and D-loop) and two nuclear (the ribosomal marker ITS and parathyroid hormone-related protein gene), was constructed to identify the two flatfish species and their hybrids. “Pure ” flounder (P. flesus) were observed in the Bay of Gdańsk, Baltic Sea, and off the coast of Denmark in the North Sea. The fishing area near Bornholm in the Baltic is rich in P. flesus P. platessa hybrids. The length difference of the amplified D-loop fragment was used for species identification.

40|$|Although {{the use of}} {{tributyltin}} in antifouling paints {{has been}} banned, this compound is still a serious pollutant of the marine environment. This paper describes a unique study in which <b>European</b> <b>flounder</b> (Platichthys flesus) were chronically (8 months) exposed to bis(tri-n-butyltin) oxide (TBTO) in the water under controlled laboratory conditions. Residue levels in selected tissues (liver, muscle) and general health status indices were measured and the effects on several organs (gills, liver, mesonephros, ovary/testis, spleen, and gastrointestinal tract) were examined histopathologically. Additionally, morphometric analysis of the thymus was performed. The major finding is that exposure of flounder to 5 μg TBTO/l {{over a period of}} 8 months, resulting in body burdens comparable to high field levels, induced significant reduction of thymus volume, possibly affecting immunocompetence of the animals. Chronic exposure of <b>European</b> <b>flounder</b> to tributyltin is therefore likely to affect the general health status of this species in heavily polluted aquatic environments. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

In eosinophilic foci, growth advantage was achieved by increased production of NADPH and pentoses for biosynthesis and cell proliferation due to increased G 6 PDN capacity during the fir sr steps of clonal adaptation. Simultaneously, oxyradical production by CYP 450, phase I was reduced. Overexpression of P-gp mediating multi-xenobiotic resistance was noted in basophilic cell types which persisted during progression towards carcinomas. This was accompanied by increased protein levels of oxyradical scavenging GST-A.

50|$|Lepeophtheirus pectoralis is {{a species}} of {{parasitic}} copepod.

50|$|The <b>European</b> <b>flounder</b> leaves {{freshwater}} in {{the autumn}} and can often be caught in estuaries when the first frosts occur. Then the fish move into deeper water for the winter. In the spring it migrates to the spawning grounds, travelling at three to four miles (five to seven kilometres) per day and not eating en route. Spawning takes place between February and May being later in more northerly latitudes. The female liberates about a million eggs which are lighter than water. The male liberates sperm which also floats and both eggs and sperm rise to the surface. Here the eggs are fertilised and hatch after six to eleven days depending on the water temperature. The developing larvae are planktonic and drift towards the coast with juvenile flounders living in shallow waters and estuaries. Young flounders become mature when still small, the males when they measure 11.5 cm and the females when they measure 18 cm. The <b>European</b> <b>flounder</b> sometimes hybridises with European plaice (Pleuronectes platessa) and, particularly in the western Baltic Sea, the hybrid is common.|$|R

50|$|Hybrids {{are well}} known in flatfishes. The Pleuronectidae, of marine fishes, have {{the largest number of}} {{reported}} hybrids.

40|$|<b>European</b> <b>flounder</b> (Platichthys flesus. L.) is a {{euryhaline}} flatfish species {{which can}} actively migrate towards {{and cope with}} low salinity environments. A laboratory experiment was undertaken to analyse the effect of salinity on condition and growth of metamorphosing <b>European</b> <b>flounder.</b> The working hypothesis was that flounder, which preferentially settle in low salinity habitats, would display accelerated development and/or enhanced growth and condition at lower salinities. The fish used in the experiment were in the late stages of metamorphosis. At {{the end of the}} 21  day laboratory rearing period no significant difference in ontogenetic development was found between exposures (salinity of 0, 10, 20 and 30). No significant differences in somatic growth rate, somatic condition or standard length were observed between treatments. There was no correlation between RNA:DNA ratio and somatic condition. Contrary to expectations, mean RNA:DNA ratios (measure of short-term well being) tended to increase with salinity and were significantly higher in the 30 salinity exposure compared to the 0 salinity exposure. The working hypothesis was, therefore, rejected. The results demonstrate that laboratory observations can fail to capture the complex ecological interactions at play in field environments. The preference for low salinity environments may be driven by other environmental factors such as predator/competition avoidance and food supply...|$|R
50|$|The <b>European</b> <b>flounder</b> {{can also}} be found in {{estuaries}} where it is tolerant of low salinity levels and, unlike other species of Pleuronectidae, it often spends part of its life cycle in freshwater and regularly makes its way into rivers. In the British Isles, it has been found as far inland as Montgomeryshire on the River Severn, Dinas Mawddwy on the River Dovey and Garstang on the River Wyre. Unlike the Atlantic salmon, it feeds in the rivers and makes its way out to sea again before spawning.|$|R

40|$|Rhythmic {{vertical}} migration {{is a widespread}} feature among teleost species and the ultimate reasons for this behaviour could be as diverse as transport, feeding, predator avoidance or reproduction strategies. A rhythmic {{vertical migration}} implies that a fish will experience associated cyclic pressure changes. We examined the effect of 14 -day exposure to cyclic variations in hydrostatic pressure (HP) and to elevated constant HP on pituitary levels of two types of gonadotropin, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), in maturing but not ovulating female <b>European</b> <b>flounder</b> (Platichthys flesus). Fish were exposed to cyclic HP with a tidal period of 12. 4 h and an amplitude of 600 kPa, between 200 and 800 kPa (environmentally realistic vertical migration), to constant absolute HP of 800 kPa, and to a maximum 1 m height water column. Flounder pituitary FSH content was remarkably higher under cyclic HP conditions than under constant normal or elevated HP conditions. In fact, pituitary FSH levels were undetectable, irrespective of the constant HP regimen. By contrast, pituitary LH levels showed {{no significant differences between}} the different groups at the end of the experimental period. This study describes an important alteration of the brain-pituitary-gonad (BPG) axis provoked by exposure to HP fluctuations, which mimic conditions in nature.

40|$|The genetic {{structure}} of the flounders #Platichthys flesus$ L. and #P. stellatus$ Pallas was investigated on different spatial scales trough analysis of allozyme variation at 7 to 24 polymorphic loci in samples collected from different regions (Baltic Sea, North Sea, Brittany, Portugal, western Mediterranean, Adriatic Sea, Aegean Sea and Japan) in 1984 to 1987. No geographic variation was evident within a region. Some pattern of differentiation by distance was infered within the Atlantic, while the Mediterranean comprised three geographically isolated populations and was itself geographycally isolated from the Atlantic (fixed allele differences at up to three loci were found among #P. flesus$ populations from the Atlantic, the western Mediterranean, the Adriatic Sea, the Aegean Sea and also #P. stellatus$ from the coast of Japan).

Genetic distances among <b>European</b> <b>flounder</b> populations (#P. flesus$) were higher than, or of the same magnitude as, the genetic distance between Pacific (#P. stellatus$) and <b>European</b> <b>flounder</b> populations, suggesting that #P. flesus$ is paraphyletic and/or there is no phylogenetic basis to recognising #P. stellatus$ as a different species. The divergence between #P. flesus$ and #P. stellatus$ was thus inferred to be more recent than the divergence between the present #P. flesus$ populations from the NE Atlantic and eastern Mediterranean.

40|$|As a {{first stage}} in {{developing}} a DNA array-based approach to investigating the effects of pollutants on an environmentally relevant <b>European</b> fish <b>species,</b> we have constructed a 160 -gene custom microarray for <b>European</b> <b>flounder.</b> Degenerate primers were used to amplify 110 different fragments of stress-related and other genes from <b>European</b> <b>flounder</b> cDNA and genomic DNA. Additionally, 22 fragments were obtained by suppressive subtractive hybridisation (SSH). These fragments were cloned and sequenced, then, with additional control genes, {{used to create a}} cDNA microarray for flounder. After optimisation of the arraying process, hepatic mRNA was isolated from flounder caught in the polluted Tyne and relatively unpolluted Alde estuaries. Fluorescent cDNA probes were synthesised from the mRNA and used in dual-colour hybridisations to the microarray. A number of transcripts were differentially expressed between Tyne and Alde female flounder but these changes were not significant, due to high inter-individual variation. However, in comparisons between Tyne and Alde male flounder, 11 transcripts were found to significantly differ in expression (PB/ 0. 05). Seven transcripts were more highly expressed in the Tyne male fish (CYP 1 A, UDPGT, a- 2 HS-glycoprotein, dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase, Cu/Zn SOD, aldehyde dehydrogenase and paraoxonase). Four transcripts (Elongation factor 1 (EF 1), EF 2, Int- 6 and complement component C 3) were found to be significantly less abundant in the Tyne male fish. Selected genes were assayed by real-time PCR, then normalised to a-tubulin. These assays confirmed the significance of the array results for CYP 1 A, UDPGT and EF 1, but not for Cu/Zn SOD. This study provides a link between traditional single-gene biomarker studies and the emerging field of eco-toxicogenomics, demonstrating the utility of microarray studies on environmentally sampled, non-model organisms...|$|R
