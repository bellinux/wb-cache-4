5|$|A <b>steam</b> {{devil is}} a {{rotating}} updraft between 50 and 200 meters wide that involves <b>steam</b> or smoke. These formations {{do not involve}} high wind speeds, only completing a few rotations per minute. <b>Steam</b> devils are very rare.

The phenomenon can occur over water, when cold arctic air passes over relatively warm water.|$|E

5|$|Evans {{had first}} begun to {{consider}} the potential applications of <b>steam</b> power for transportation while still an apprentice in the 1780s, and had developed rudimentary designs for 'steam carriages' in the 1790s. In 1801, Evans definitively began work on making his long-held dream of a <b>steam</b> carriage into reality. Early <b>steam</b> engineers, most notably Watt contemporary William Murdoch, had developed plans for a steam-propelled carriage incorporating a heavy flywheel, in which pressure was converted directly to rotary power, however it became apparent in experimentation that a low-pressure, rotary <b>steam</b> engine would never be powerful enough to propel a carriage of any weight forward. Evans's attention thus turned to a reciprocating engine, not only for his <b>steam</b> carriage ideas, but also for industrial application. Importantly, Evans became an early proponent of 'strong steam' or high-pressure engines, an idea long resisted by Watt and earlier <b>steam</b> pioneers because the necessary iron making and metal working technology was lacking. Evans recognized that a high-pressure <b>steam</b> engine would be essential {{to the development of}} a <b>steam</b> carriage because they could be built far smaller while providing similar or greater power outputs to low-pressure equivalents. Some experiments with high-pressure <b>steam</b> engines had been made in Europe, most notably an unsuccessful <b>steam</b> tractor developed by Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot. However the prevailing fear of early <b>steam</b> engineering was that no boiler could safely contain high-pressure <b>steam.</b> Evans ignored potential drawbacks, and developed radically different designs which called for engines operating at high-pressure and the elimination of the condenser—a central component of conventional designs. His designs also incorporated a grasshopper beam, a double-acting cylinder, and four <b>steam</b> valves. Each valve was independently operated by one of four cams. The resulting design was a high-pressure <b>steam</b> engine that had a higher power-to-weight ratio that prevailing designs, making locomotives and steamboats practical. It was also mechanically simpler than condensing engines, making it less costly to build and maintain, and did not require large volumes of condensing water. These features would make it similarly suited for a variety of industrial applications.|$|E

40|$|Background: <b>Steaming</b> of ginseng {{is known}} to change its {{chemical}} composition and biological activity. This study was carried out to investigate the effect of different <b>steaming</b> time-scales on chemical constituents and antiproliferative activity of Vietnamese ginseng (VG). Methods: VG was <b>steamed</b> at 105 °C for 2 – 20  h. Its saponin constituents and antiproliferative activity were studied. The similarity of chemical compositions between <b>steamed</b> samples at 105 °C and 120 °C were compared. Results: Most protopanaxadiol and protopanaxatriol ginsenosides lost the sugar moiety at the C- 20 position with 10 – 14  h <b>steaming</b> at 105 °C and changed to their less polar analogues. However, ocotillol (OCT) ginsenosides were reasonably stable to <b>steaming</b> process. Antiproliferative activity against A 549 lung cancer cells was increased on <b>steaming</b> and reached its plateau after 12  h <b>steaming.</b> Conclusion: <b>Steaming</b> VG at 105 °C showed a similar tendency of chemical degradation to the <b>steaming</b> VG at 120 °C except the slower rate of reaction.

40|$|AbstractIt {{is a novel}} idea to make <b>steamed</b> bread {{by adding}} potato flour into wheat flour {{considering}} the production and nutritional factors of potato. In this study, the influence of potato flour (0 – 35 %) on dough rheology and quality of <b>steamed</b> bread were investigated. Potato flour addition significantly influenced the dough rheological properties and <b>steamed</b> bread quality, such as increased water absorption, the maximum gaseous release height, total volume of CO 2 and hardness, while decreased dough stability and specific volume of <b>steamed</b> bread. Moreover, correlation analysis suggested that dough height at the maximum development time, dough stability, water absorption and the phase tangent {{can be used for}} predicting the technological quality of <b>steamed</b> bread. Potato-wheat <b>steamed</b> bread had higher dietary fibre, ash content and antioxidant activity than those of wheat <b>steamed</b> bread. The estimated glycemic index decreased from 73. 63 (0 %) to 60. 01 (35 %). Considering the sensory evaluation, the <b>steamed</b> bread with 20 % potato flour is acceptable.

40|$|Slow <b>steaming</b> is an {{efficient}} way of reducing fuel consumption and related costs. Slow <b>steaming</b> {{is not simply}} a matter of reducing speed. It has far reaching consequences and affects supply chains. Current available research mainly focuses on the mathematical aspects of slow <b>steaming.</b> This research reveals stakeholders‟ attitudes and motivations for slow <b>steaming.</b> Slow <b>steaming</b> is considered to be a social phenomenon and a qualitative approach was applied. A content analysis was conducted on articles selected from a global news source. The factor time was taken into account by comparing results with the findings of prior research. While only a small number of samples were used the research resulted in a rich picture of slow <b>steaming</b> from a stakeholder‟s point of view. Slow <b>steaming</b> is used by different sectors and types of ships. However, container shipping companies are particularly well represented. Container ships are indicated to have a relatively large demand for energy. The results show that the major motivation for applying slow <b>steaming</b> is to reduce fuel consumption and related costs. Environmental benefits are also mentioned but are mainly considered to be subordinate. These findings are consistent with earlier research from 2010. Initial caution which related to the technical implications of slow <b>steaming</b> have changed into concerns related to the impact of slow <b>steaming</b> on supply chains. It is indicated that slow <b>steaming</b> to a certain limit does not cause engine damage and requires only minor modifications. The findings also show that slow <b>steaming</b> varies with fuel prices and freight rates. An increasing number of stakeholders expect that slow <b>steaming</b> is here to stay. However, this may indicate that stakeholders have restrained expectations of the development of fuel prices and freight rates in the near future.
