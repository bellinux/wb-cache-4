This article reports on a recently developed nondestructive method using an eddy current test and X-rays to accurately detect chilled structures on a cam-shaft <b>sensor</b> <b>plate.</b> 1. Summary In the manufacturing process of a cam-shaft for the internal-combustion engine that primarily includes casting and machining, the cam tip’s structures are chilled locally to increase durability and resistance to abrasion with other areas that are de-chilled in order to raise machinability. When hard chilled structures are in areas other than a cam, they could exert harmful influence on the manufacturing line due to bite damage, etc. However, since the surface of a cam-shaft immediately after casting is covered with oxide scales (black scales), it is difficult to confirm chilled structures from appearance. In our research, we conducted a basic examination to develop an optimum evaluation system for the actual cam-shaft manufacturing line. As a result, we succeeded in developing a system that can detect structures with a nondestructive method, even on a cam-shaft covered with a rough casting surface. Our report follows below. 2.

The system is assembled from concatenated SAW vibration sensors based on a SAW delay line manufactured on a surface of a piezoelectric plate. Vibrations of the plate are transformed into electric signals that allow identification of the sensor and localization of a threat. The theoretical study of sensor vibrations leads us to the simple isotropic model with one degree of freedom. This model allowed an explicit description of the <b>sensor</b> <b>plate</b> movement and identification of the vibrating sensor. Analysis of frequency response of the ST-cut quartz <b>sensor</b> <b>plate</b> and a damping speed of its impulse response has been conducted. The analysis above was the basis to determine the ranges of parameters for vibrating plates to be useful in electronic warning systems. Generally, operation of electronic warning systems with SAW vibration sensors is based on the analysis of signal phase changes at the working frequency of delay line after being transmitted via two circuits of concatenated four-terminal networks. Frequencies of phase changes are equal to resonance frequencies of vibrating plates of sensors. The amplitude of these phase changes is proportional to the amplitude of vibrations of a <b>sensor</b> <b>plate.</b> Both pieces of information may be sent and recorded jointly by a simple electrical unit...|$|E
