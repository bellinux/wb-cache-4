Peace was secured by two marriages. Casimir was married to Yaroslav's sister, while Casimir gave his own sister Gertruda to Yaroslav's son, Izyaslav.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the defeat}} to Seattle, United had a two-match homestand against 2005 {{expansion}} teams, Chivas USA and Real Salt Lake. Against Chivas USA, United went up 2–0 before conceding twice to <b>settle</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> 2–2 draw. Against Real Salt Lake, Dwayne De Rosario netted a hat trick in the match {{within the first}} 31 minutes, scoring the fastest hat trick in MLS history, earning him Player of the Week honors. In addition to De Rosario's three goals, he assisted to Andy Najar, and the club won 4–1 over Salt Lake.|$|E
5|$|In {{the later}} part of 1186, {{after the death}} of King Henry's son Geoffrey– who was Duke of Brittany– King Philip II of France demanded that Geoffrey's daughters be placed in the French king's custody, and that the duchy of Brittany, which Geoffrey had ruled in right of his wife, be {{surrendered}} into French royal custody. Coutances was one of the negotiators sent by King Henry to secure a settlement, but they had to <b>settle</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> temporary truce. In January 1188 Coutances took the cross when he pledged to go on Crusade along with King Henry and King Philip of France.|$|E

5|$|In {{the second}} half, Chris Turner hit Darrius Heyward-Bey {{for a short}} bubble screen pass behind the line of scrimmage, and Heyward-Bey ran it 63yards for the score. During the next series, the Terrapins were held three-and-out, but the punt was fumbled and {{recovered}} by Maryland on the Hokies 11-yard line. However, the Terrapins were again forced to <b>settle</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> field goal, which made it a one-possession lead for VT at 20–13with 2:29left in the third quarter. In the final quarter, the Hokies managed another field goal and held onto the lead for a final result of 23–13.|$|E
5|$|The Aggies {{scored on}} their opening {{possession}} with a 35-yard touchdown with a screen pass from Stephen McGee to Mike Goodson. The Longhorns mustered twofirst downs, but {{were forced to}} punt. Texas A ended their subsequent drive three plays later with a punt of their own. The Longhorns again successfully penetrated into Texas A territory, but Mack Brown opted to call a pooch punt by Colt McCoy on fourthdown and four from the Aggie 37-yard line. The Aggies answered with an eighteen-play drive that stalled on the UT-14 yardline and the Aggies had to <b>settle</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> 31-yard field goal by Matt Szymanski.|$|E
5|$|The Crimson Tide {{scored on}} its next two {{possessions}} as well, and McCarron completed touchdown passes to running backs Kenyan Drake and Jalston Fowler. With the lead at 35–0 {{late in the}} second quarter, Alabama played its reserves {{for much of the}} remainder of the game. After the Crimson Tide defense forced another punt from the Panthers, McCarron was replaced by backup quarterback Blake Sims. On his first possession at the helm of Alabama's offense, Sims led the team to the Georgia State one-yard line, but a pair of false starts forced Alabama to <b>settle</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> field goal that increased the lead to 38–0 at halftime.|$|E

5|$|After Georgia Tech's post-score kickoff, Wake Forest {{continued}} to struggle on offense. Quarterback Riley Skinner was sacked, threw an 18-yard completion, then three incomplete passes. Wake {{was forced to}} punt the ball away again, allowing the Yellow Jackets the possibility of expanding their lead. On Tech's first play after the punt, however, Reggie Ball's pass was intercepted, allowing Wake Forest another chance on offense. The play turned {{the momentum of the}} game in favor of Wake Forest, who proceeded to move the ball with slightly more effectiveness. During the Wake Forest drive, Skinner completed a 39-yard pass to John Tereshinski, who drove the Deacons inside Georgia Tech territory, where the drive continued. Though Wake Forest was forced to <b>settle</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> 33-yard field goal from kicker Sam Swank, the score tied the game at 66 with 7:59 remaining in the game.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{excellent}} field position, Virginia Tech seemed in position for an easy score. However, after a quick Tech first down, the Georgia defense stiffened and Tech was forced to <b>settle</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> field goal. The 28-yard kick by Brandon Pace cut Georgia's lead to 31–24, but only 3:42 remained on the clock. Due to the short time remaining, Virginia Tech was forced to attempt an onside kick in order to have another chance at offense. The kick was recovered by Georgia, however, and the Bulldogs proceeded to rush the ball in three consecutive plays, forcing the Hokies to use their last timeout in order to conserve time for one final drive.|$|E
5|$|In 1868 and 1869, judgements {{went against}} the Met {{in a number of}} hearings, finding {{financial}} irregularities such as the company paying a dividend it could not afford and expenses being paid out of the capital account. In 1870, its directors were found guilty of a breach of trust and ordered to compensate the company. Although they all appealed and were allowed in 1874 to <b>settle</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> much lower amount, to restore shareholders' confidence the directors had all been replaced by October 1872 and Edward Watkin appointed chairman.

5|$|Oklahoma's next drive ran 18 {{plays and}} 87 yards taking up 7:26. Once again, the Sooners stalled {{in the red}} zone and were again forced to <b>settle</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> field goal, this time a 24-yarder by Michael Hunnicutt. The next two drives by Texas A and Oklahoma both ended in interceptions thrown by Manziel and Jones respectively. Texas A took over at the Oklahoma 48 yardline {{following}} Jones' interception. A trick play to start the drive resulted in senior wide receiver Kenric McNeal throwing a 20-yard pass to Mike Evans. On the next play, running back Ben Malena running the ball 23 yards to the five yardline. Manziel ran for a 5-yard touchdown on the next play to make the score 14–6. Oklahoma's next drive lasted 13 plays and 83 yards that culminated in a 6-yard touchdown pass from Jones to Justin Brown.|$|E
5|$|On {{the first}} play of the fourth quarter, Thurman Thomas ran for a 31-yard {{touchdown}} that put the Bills back in front, 19–17. A few possessions later, the Giants drove down to the Bills 4yard line, but were unable to score and had to <b>settle</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> 21-yard field goal by Matt Bahr that gave the Giants a 20–19 lead. Both teams exchanged possessions before the Bills began one final drive. The Bills drove down to the Giants 30-yard line to set up {{what would be a}} potentially game-winning 47-yard field goal attempt by Scott Norwood. Just before the kick, ABC showed a graphic indicating that, on grass that season, Norwood had made just 3–of–7 field goals from at least 40yards.

5|$|The secondquarter {{started with}} the Longhorns driving only sixyards and being forced to punt again. The Aggies {{continued}} to press their advantage and drove down the field until Stephen McGee threw an ill-timed pass that was intercepted by Deon Beasley at the Longhorn 25. Two first-downs later, Texas was forced to punt and pinned Texas A on their own fiveyard line. Stephen McGee led the offense with several long passes and the Aggies drove to the Texas 5 but again were held short on 3rd down. On 4th and three, the Aggies faked the field goal and the placeholder, T.J. Sanders, ran the ball in for his firstcareer touchdown giving the Aggies a 17–0 lead. The Longhorns started their next drive on their own 20-yard line, where Colt McCoy threw a 62-yard pass to Jamaal Charles. The drive stalled and the Longhorns had to <b>settle</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> field goal and went to halftime trailing their arch-rival, 17–3.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with another}} newly formed London club Chelsea, Palace applied {{to join the}} Second Division of the Football League. But {{unfortunately}} for Palace, it was Chelsea that were accepted, and Palace were forced to <b>settle</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> place in the Southern League Second Division. To {{increase the number of}} club fixtures, they also joined the mid-week United Counties League. Robson established a team of sixteen professionals, mainly drawn from Middlesbrough. The club's inaugural campaign, which consisted mainly of other clubs' reserve sides alongside Southall, Southern United, St. Leonards United and Grays United was a successful one. Their opening match was against Southampton Reserves, and approximately 3,000 people paid 6d to stand or a shilling to sit. Palace led 3–0 after 30 minutes, before fading and losing 3–4. However, that was the club's only defeat in the league all season, and Palace won the championship and were promoted to the Southern League First Division. The season included a run of seventeen straight victories, one of them being a 9–1 win over Grays United. The crowd attendances for the season were regularly between 2,000 and 3,000 although 4,000 attended the 4–0 defeat of Watford Reserves in March.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal {{entered the}} {{competition}} in the third round, receiving a bye as a Premier League club. Their opening match was a goalless draw against First Division club Port Vale at home, meaning the game was replayed at Vale Park, eleven days later. In the replay, Arsenal won 4–3 on a penalty shoot-out, having drawn 1–1 in extra time. In the fourth round, Arsenal played Middlesbrough at the Riverside Stadium. Overmars scored the opening goal inside 68 seconds for the visitors and Parlour added a second to give Arsenal a commanding lead, going into the interval. Although Paul Merson scored {{in the second half}} for Middlesbrough, Arsenal did enough to progress into the fifth round. A 0–0 draw at home against Crystal Palace meant Arsenal needed to play a fifth round replay at Selhurst Park on 25 February 1998. Goals from Anelka and Bergkamp ensured victory for an understrength Arsenal team. Against West Ham United in the quarter-finals, Arsenal conceded the first goal when Frank Lampard's corner kick was converted into the goal net by Stuart Pearce, through a first-time shot. Although Bergkamp scored a penalty to equalise, Arsenal had to <b>settle</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> replay, staged at Upton Park, where it ended 4–3 on penalties after another draw. A goal by Wreh against Wolverhampton Wanderers in the semi-finals meant Arsenal reached their 13th FA Cup final.|$|E

5|$|Bayern coach Ottmar Hitzfeld {{announced}} his team's line-up {{for the final}} two full days ahead of the match. Injuries also impacted on his selections, with French left-back Bixente Lizarazu and Brazilian forward Élber having suffered season-ending knee injuries. Élber's absence resulted in Bayern playing a three-man attack of Mario Basler, Carsten Jancker and Alexander Zickler, while Lizarazu was replaced on the left flank by Michael Tarnat playing in a wing-back role opposite Markus Babbel on the right. Babbel was originally intended to play a man-marking role on Ryan Giggs, with his defensive abilities earning him selection ahead of the more attack-minded Thomas Strunz; however, this was nullified by Giggs' selection on the right wing, where he would play against Tarnat. The Bayern defence was anchored around sweeper Lothar Matthäus, who played behind Thomas Linke and Ghana international Samuel Kuffour – the only non-German in the Bayern side (by comparison, Manchester United had four Englishmen in their team); Linke and Kuffour's partnership at centre-back meant club captain Thomas Helmer had to <b>settle</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> place on the bench. Stefan Effenberg and Jens Jeremies played in central midfield for Bayern, with Jeremies man-marking David Beckham.|$|E
5|$|Following the Tech kickoff, Miami began a {{drive at}} its 20-yard line and went three and out. Following the Hurricanes' punt, Tech's offense began work at its 22-yard line. Despite having {{a chance to}} take the lead with a {{successful}} drive, the Hokies also went three and out, punting back to Miami and allowing the Hurricanes to begin a possession at their 33-yard line. This possession was more successful than Miami's first of the second half. Kelly ran for four yards, then completed a six-yard pass for a first down. Tech committed a 15-yard grabbing-the-facemask penalty, and Kelly completed a 15-yard pass that pushed the Miami offense to the Tech 22-yard line. Young picked up 12 yards and a first down with a rush to the left, but Kelly was sacked for a loss of 13 yards, negating the gain. Unable to gain another first down or a touchdown, Miami was forced to <b>settle</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> field goal attempt. The 31-yard attempt was good, and Miami expanded its lead to 1710 with 29 seconds remaining in the quarter.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Albulena was {{significant}} for the southern resistance against the Ottoman Empire. Franz Babinger, a historian of the Ottoman Empire, describes the battle as Skanderbeg's most brilliant victory. The battle of Albulena strengthened the morale of Skanderbeg's men who afterwards rarely, if at all, deserted his army as Hamza had. Hamza himself was sent as a prisoner to Naples in Alfonso's realm after being captured. An Ottoman envoy was sent to ransom the standard bearers and forty of the distinguished prisoners. The envoy also tried to <b>settle</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> truce between Mehmed and Skanderbeg, but the latter responded that he would only accept if Svetigrad and Berat, which had been lost in 1448 and 1450 respectively, were restored to his state. Seeing that Mehmed would not accept such terms, Skanderbeg strengthened his garrisons {{in the area around}} Svetigrad. The victory still bought Albania and Italy time; in 1460, Mehmed and Skanderbeg signed an armistice that lasted three years. This gave Skanderbeg the opportunity to land in Italy and help out Alfonso's son, Ferdinand I of Naples, who had been crowned after his father had died. The battle thus opened a new phase in the Ottoman-Albanian war which saw the high-water mark of the Albanian resistance and the fiercest Ottoman invasions of Albania in the war. The war would last until the fall of Krujë in 1478.|$|E
