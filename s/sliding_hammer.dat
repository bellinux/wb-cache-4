50|$|One {{variant of}} the Halligan has a heavy sliding collar on the shaft. Once the prying end of the tool is wedged into position, the sliding 'hammer' is used to force the wedge, {{allowing}} for proper seating before prying. The adze end is also assisted by using the <b>sliding</b> <b>hammer</b> to generate forced traction on a hooked cylinder. Another variant has an end that resembles a lever-type can opener, used for making large holes for access or ventilation in sheet metal.|$|E
30|$|The DCP used in {{this study}} has the {{following}} accessories: a steel rod with a cone at one end with a base diameter of 20  mm and apex angle of 60 °. It is driven into the subgrade by a <b>sliding</b> <b>hammer</b> weighing 8  kg from a height of 575  mm. Two people are usually required to penetrate the equipment into soil. However, the manpower can be reduced to one person by using an electronic device to record the data. According to ASTM D 6951 method, apex angle 60 ° is better than 30 ° and became more popular in the recent past due to its durability in high-strength materials.|$|E
40|$|Finding {{evidence}} {{for life on}} Mars will likely require accessing the subsurface since the Martian surface is both hostile to life and to preservation of biosignatures due to the cold dry conditions, the strong W environment, {{and the presence of}} strong oxidants. Systems are needed to probe beneath the sun and oxidant baked surface of Mars and return samples to the surface for analysis or to bring the instrument sensing underground. Recognizing this need, the European Space Agency incorporated a small subsurface penetrometer or Mole onto the Beagle 2 Mars lander. Had the 2003 landing been successful, the Mole would have collected samples from 1 - 1. 5 m depth and delivered them to an organic analysis instrument on the surface. The de- vice called the Planetary Underground Tool (PLUTO), also measured soil mechanical and thermophysical properties. Constrained by the small mass and volume allowance of the Beagle lander, the PLUTO mole was a slender cylinder only 2 cm diameter and 28 cm long equipped with a small sampling device designed to collect samples and bring them to the surface for analysis by other instrument. The mass of the entire system including deployment mechanism and tether was 1 / 2 kg. sensor package underground to make in situ measurements. The Mars Underground Mole (MUM) is a larger Mole based on the PLUTO design but incorporating light collection optics that interface to a fiber optic cable in the tether that transmits light to a combined stimulated emission Raman Spectrometer and Short Wave Infrared (SWIR) reflectance Spectrometer with sensitivity from 0. 7 to 2. 5 micrometers. This instrument is called the Dual Spectral Sensor and uses a Digital Array Scanning Interferometer as the sensor technology, a type of fourier transform interferometer that uses fixed element prisms and thus is highly rugged compared to a Michaelson interferometer. Due to the size limitations of an on-Mole instrument compartment, and the availability of a tether, the sensor head, light sources, and control electronics for the instrument are on the surface. The DSS sensor is capable of sensing a wide range of minerals relevant to Mars Astrobiology objectives including hydrated minerals, clays, carbonates, sulfates, and ice. Additionally, Raman spectroscopy is effective for detecting organics. The MUM is designed to achieve a maximum depth of penetration of 5 m in Mars regolith and can be repeatedly deployed and retrieved. The ability to perform repeated sampling, combined with the low mass and power requirements, means that Moles could be incorporated into a rover mission as well as used on a stationary platform. The Mole mechanism is a pointed slender cylinder that advances into soil by way of an internal <b>sliding</b> <b>hammer</b> mechanism. Part of the energy released by the spring-loaded hammer with each shock is transferred to the Mole casing and from there to the soil, resulting in penetration by displacing and compressing the surrounding soil. A backwards-directed impulse as a re- action to each forward shock is transferred via a suppressor mass against a second weaker spring allowing forward motion without requiring reactive forces provided by the lander. The Mole tip can be opened to collect soil samples. The Mole casing is tethered to a supporting mechanism that supplies power. Components supporting the Mole on the surface include a launch tube, tether reel and winch for pulling in tether, in addition to the tether itself...|$|E

50|$|Fingering {{techniques}} {{and how they}} are taught depends largely on the personal preferences of musicians rather than on the basis of school affiliation. Radhika Mohan Maitra, for example, used the index, middle and ring finger of his left hand to stop the string, just like followers of Allauddin Khan do. Maitra, however, made much more extensive use of the third fingernail for <b>slides</b> and <b>hammers.</b> Amjad Ali Khan, while a member of approximately the same stylistic school as Radhika Mohan, prefers to use just the index and middle fingers of his left hand. Amjad Ali is, however, pictured circa 1960 playing with all three fingers.|$|R
50|$|The {{standard}} K100 has {{a barrel}} length of 108 mm and operates in both single- and double-action mode.

5000|$|Alec Stone Sweet {{describes}} the clawhammer technique in the liner notes to [...] "Tumblin' Gap: Clawhammer Guitar Solos": [...] "There are five {{characteristics of the}} way I play clawhammer. First, every specific note played by the right hand is produced either by the index finger or the thumb. Second, no note is ever plucked; each is played either with the thumb, or by striking down on a string with the nail of the index finger. Third, the index finger never plays off the beat, and the thumb never plays on the beat. This feature of clawhammer technique gives the music a heavier - and, to my ear, more natural - drive {{than it would have}} if it were played, say, as melody over an alternating bass. There is one exception to this rule: variations on a common clawhammer banjo lick (that you can hear on the climatic high notes of the second part of Polly Put the Kettle On, and the third part of Joke on the Puppy) when the thumb plays on beat. Fourth, for any piece, most of the notes are produced by the left hand, in combinations of <b>slides,</b> <b>hammers,</b> and pull-offs; slurs can occur on or off the beat. Fifth, I play in multiple tunings, and sometimes replace the sixth string bass with a high sixth string treble (of the same gauge employed for the first string). The banjo player will realize that I use my thumb on the bass strings to obtain drones, much as a clawhammer player uses the banjo’s high fifth string; indeed, when I string the guitar with a high treble in place of the sixth-string bass, it is partly to imitate the fifth string of the banjo. In many of the tunes, I keep multiple drones going, on different strings. To sum up, in my version of clawhammer guitar, the thumb plays off the beat, even when it plays harmony bass notes or bass lines; no strings are ever plucked; with respect to the right hand, only the index finger and the thumb sound notes, but never at the same time. What is incredible is how much full textured sound one finger, one thumb, and left hand slurs can generate." ...|$|R
5000|$|The Tanfoglio Combat/Standard {{is a short}} recoil operated, locked breech {{semi-automatic}} pistol {{that uses}} a Browning Hi-Power style linkless system.All T95 Standard and Combat models have the capability of being fired single- and double-action.The T95 Combat models feature an ambidextrous frame-mounted combat [...] "switch" [...] style manual safety that locks the sear so the trigger cannot be moved rearward {{as well as an}} internal firing pin block safety which stops the firing pin from traveling forward. The manual safety allows the Combat models to be carried with the hammer back, ready for use just by switching the safety off, a configuration known as condition one. The T95 Standard models feature <b>slide</b> mounted <b>hammer</b> drop safety/decocker lever (ambidextrous as an option).Unlike most other semi-automatic pistols, the Tanfoglio Combat/Standard slide rides inside the frame rails rather than outside, similar to the SIG P210. This provides a very tight slide-to-frame fit, very good barrel lock-up and contributes to accuracy. A new slide with a slide-mounted safety/decocker lever is available as a factory option. Most variants have fixed iron sights with three dots for increased visibility that can be adjusted for windage. The Tanfoglio Combat/Standard models feature high capacity [...] "double stack" [...] magazines.|$|R
50|$|The P9S trigger {{operates}} as a traditional double action. There is a lever {{on the left side}} of the pistol grip to both decock a cocked hammer or to manually re-cock it for a single action first shot, a feature first observed on the Sauer 38H. A further function of the decocking lever is to release the <b>slide</b> stop. The <b>hammer</b> is concealed within the slide (also similar to the Sauer) with a protruding pin at the rear of the slide as a cocking indicator. The operating spring surrounds the barrel, allowing for a lower bore axis than pistols such as John Browning's M1911 that have the operating spring below the barrel. A manual firing-pin safety is located at the left rear of the slide; putting it in the down position locks the firing pin and flipping it up to level position unlocks it.|$|R
5000|$|Common {{tools for}} tuning pianos include the tuning lever or [...] "hammer", {{a variety of}} mutes, and a tuning fork or {{electronic}} tuning device. The tuning lever is used to turn the tuning pins, increasing or decreasing the tension of the string. Mutes are used to silence strings that are not being tuned. While tuning the temperament octave, a felt strip is typically placed within the temperament (middle) section of the piano; it is inserted between each note's trichord, muting its outer two strings so that only the middle string is free to vibrate. After the center strings are all tuned, the felt strip can be removed note by note, tuning the outer strings to the center strings. Wedge-shaped mutes are inserted between two strings to mute them, while a Papps mute is sometimes used for tuning the high notes in upright pianos because it <b>slides</b> easily between <b>hammer</b> shanks.|$|R
50|$|A core {{element of}} the game is how the player fires and reloads the handgun. The gun has to be used in a semi-realistic fashion, meaning that all aspects of {{reloading}} the gun have to be enacted individually with different key presses. Rather than finding magazines as seen in most shooters, the player finds cartridges which must be individually loaded into the revolver chambers or pistol magazines. In-game actions mapped to individual key presses include, but are not limited to: removing the magazine from the pistol, inserting a cartridge into a magazine, inserting a magazine into the pistol, pulling back the <b>slide,</b> cocking the <b>hammer,</b> toggling the safety, inspecting the chamber, releasing the slide stop, and spinning the cylinder of the revolver. To emphasize understanding of the firearm, the player's handgun will start in a random condition; the magazine or chamber may be loaded or empty, the slide may be locked or unlocked, and the safety may be on or off.|$|R
50|$|The Browning Hi-Power BDA is a {{semi-automatic}} short recoil operated locked breech firearm. It has a vertically tilting delayed camming action. This {{locking mechanism}} was {{borrowed from the}} Browning Hi-Power. The handgun features a double-action trigger which cocks and then releases the hammer. The recoil of the <b>slide</b> recocks the <b>hammer,</b> and all consecutive shots are fired from the single-action mode. A disconnector ensures the pistol fires in semi-automatic mode only. The spring-loaded external claw extractor is mounted in the slide, while the fixed ejector - inside the pistol’s frame. The BDA is secured against unintentional firing with an automatic firing pin safety which blocks the firing pin and is released only when the trigger is pulled to fire. Immediately after a round is fired, the safety reengages itself even if the trigger is not released. The BDA also has a decocking safety that safely releases and captures the hammer in a safety notch. A decocking lever is mounted {{on each side of}} the pistol’s frame.|$|R

5000|$|In {{his review}} for Allmusic, Scott Yanow notes that [...] "Some of the originals find the unusual group {{resembling}} {{a high school}} band a bit while other pieces are quite explorative and interesting. The fact that the spirited group sounds complete {{much of the time}} is particularly notable". On AllAboutJazz Tom Johnson said [...] "What makes it most fun is that the band seems to be hell-bent for making the biggest, rudest noises they can. Eskelin's sax farts and spits, Swell's trombone slips and <b>slides,</b> and Baron <b>hammers</b> out his usual trademark intense, tuneful, and humorous drumming. Even without a bassist, the three find a groove and they'll ride it just long enough to come right up to the edge of overdoing it—and then they'll swerve right into something else. And more often than not, they'll find something as incongruous as possible, something that seems too odd and unmanageable, and take it on with such abandon that it's almost impossible to stifle the giddy laughter you'll feel when you realize they pulled it off".|$|R
50|$|The PM has a DA/SA trigger mechanism. Engaging {{the manual}} safety {{simultaneously}} decocks the hammer if cocked, and prevents movement of <b>slide,</b> trigger and <b>hammer.</b> Both carrying with safety engaged, or with safety disengaged and hammer uncocked are considered safe. The DA trigger pull is heavy, requiring a strong squeeze, trading first shot accuracy for safety. Racking the slide, manually cocking the hammer or firing a cartridge all cock the hammer, setting the trigger {{for the next}} shot to single action. The PM is a semi-automatic firearm, therefore its rate of fire depends on how rapidly the shooter squeezes the trigger. Spent cartridges are ejected some 5.5-6 meters away to the shooter's right and rear. After firing the last round, the slide is held back by the slide stop lever/ejector. Magazines can {{be removed from the}} gun via the heel release, located {{on the bottom of the}} grip. After loading a fresh magazine, the slide can be released by pressing the lever on the left side of the frame or by racking the slide and releasing it; either action loads a cartridge into the chamber and readies the pistol to fire again.|$|R
5000|$|The trigger {{comes from}} the factory with a [...] single-action pull, and is capable of both single-action and double-action. Pulling back the <b>slide</b> sets the <b>hammer</b> {{backwards}} and downwards to its single-action position, making for a very short trigger pull, with minimal take-up. The double-action pull is longer and more stiff. It has no external safeties, though {{it does have a}} de-cocking lever positioned just above the right-handed shooter's thumb, {{on the left side of}} the grip. The lever provides for a safe method of lowering the hammer from its full-cocked, single-action position, to a [...] "half-cock", double-action safe position where the hammer itself falls forward to a locking point about an eighth of an inch from the rear of the firing pin. Once de-cocked, it is physically impossible for the hammer to drop completely and contact the firing pin, which would otherwise greatly increase the risk of the unintentional discharge of a chambered round. In order for the round to discharge, the full double-action pull would have to be completed, which allows for the pistol to be carried reasonably safely with a round chambered. In addition, the SIG P232 has an automatic firing pin safety.|$|R
