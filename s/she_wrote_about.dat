5|$|Also {{like her}} mother, whose Letters from Sweden was {{foundational}} {{to the writing}} of both History of a Six Weeks' Tour and Rambles, Shelley emphasised her maternal role in the text. She describes herself as a conventional figure, worrying about her son. Rather than the scandal-ridden young woman of her youth, which <b>she</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>about</b> in the Tour, she is now a demure, respectable, middle-aged woman.|$|E

5|$|David's {{first five}} books, {{particularly}} the earlier works, contained recipes interspersed with literary quotation {{and descriptions of}} people and places that inspired her. By {{the time of her}} third book, Italian Food, David had begun to add sections {{about the history of the}} cuisine and the particular dishes that <b>she</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>about.</b> Her interest in the history of cooking led her in her later years to research the history of spices, baking, and ice.|$|E

5|$|All five of David's early books {{remained}} in print {{half a century}} later, and her reputation among cookery writers such as Nigel Slater and Clarissa Dickson Wright is of enormous influence. The historian of food Panikos Panayi suggests that this is because she consciously brought foreign cooking styles into the English kitchen; she did this with fine writing, and with practical experience of living and cooking in the countries <b>she</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>about.</b> She deliberately destroyed the myths of restaurant cuisine, instead describing the home cooking of Mediterranean countries. Her books {{paved the way for}} other cookery writers to use foreign recipes. Post-David celebrity chefs, often ephemeral, included Philip Harben, Fanny Cradock, Graham Kerr ("the galloping gourmet"), and Robert Carrier.|$|E
5|$|Ramones is {{the debut}} studio album by American punk rock band the Ramones, {{released}} on April 23, 1976 by Sire Records. After Hit Parader editor Lisa Robinson saw the band at a gig in New York City, <b>she</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>about</b> {{them in an}} article and contacted Danny Fields, insisting that he be their manager. Fields agreed and convinced Craig Leon to produce Ramones, and the band recorded a demo for prospective record labels. Leon persuaded Sire president Seymour Stein {{to listen to the}} band perform, and he later offered the band a recording contract. The Ramones began recording in January 1976, needing only seven days and $6,400 to record the album. They used similar sound-output techniques to those of the Beatles and used advanced production methods by Leon.|$|E

Margot took a shorthand course by correspondence in Bep Voskuijl's name and received high marks.

As her confidence in her writing grew, and as she began to mature, she wrote of more abstract subjects such as her belief in God, and how she defined human nature.|$|E
5|$|Following her {{departure}} from parliament at the 2013 election, Gillard has remained engaged with the Labor Party.

Prior to the 2016 election campaign, Gillard offered her assistance to the Labor party, whereby a video was released of her endorsing and seeking donations for the party's education policy. She later joined former Labor Prime Ministers Bob Hawke and Paul Keating at Bill Shorten's Labor campaign launch on 19 June 2016.|$|E

She considers herself a feminist to the bone and looks upon civil movements with sympathy and enthusiasm. However she has resisted offers to become formally involved in political positions. She became involved in Andrés Manuel López Obrador’s 2005 presidential campaign. <b>She</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>about</b> the seven-week occupation of the Zócalo that followed López Obrador's loss in 2006.

25|$|Now that Howe was in {{the public}} eye, she {{produced}} eleven issues of the literary magazine, Northern Lights, in 1867. That same year <b>she</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>about</b> her travels to Europe in From the Oak to the Olive. After the war she focused her activities on the causes of pacifism and women's suffrage. By 1868, Julia’s husband no longer opposed her involvement in public life, so Julia decided to become active in reform. She helped found the New England Women's Club and the New England Woman Suffrage Association. She served as president for nine years beginning in 1868. In 1869, she became co-leader with Lucy Stone of the American Woman Suffrage Association. Then, in 1870, she {{became president of the}} New England Women's Club.

25|$|Parnok left Moscow in {{late summer}} 1917 and spent the Russian Civil War years in the Crimean town of Sudak with Erarskaya. Soon after their arrival, she was {{approached}} by Alexander Spendiaryan (known in Russia as Alexander Spendiarov) and asked to prepare the libretto for a 4-act opera Almast, based on an Armenian legend. Parnok immediately set to work, sourcing her dramatic verse on the epic poem, The Taking of Tmuk Fortress, by Hovhannes Tumanyan and using Erarskaya as her inspiration. She finished the libretto by the winter of 1918, long before Spendiaryan had completed the musical score, and returned to reading Sappho. At that time in Russia, as elsewhere, Sappho was considered a heterosexual poet because <b>she</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>about</b> desire. Both physical love and desire, were perceived as masculine traits, thus women poets who wrote erotic lyrics without shame, regardless of their sexual orientation, were often given the label Sapphic. Simultaneously, she and Eugenia Gertsyk, Adelaida's sister, became closer friends, reveling in their spiritual quest. She viewed her relationship with Eugenia as that of an older and wiser guide, who could help her mature spiritually and break her addiction to love.|$|E
25|$|The Zephyrettes {{were hired}} in Chicago, first by McPeek {{and later by}} her successor, Mary Lou Gordon. While the California Zephyr was jointly {{operated}} by the Burlington, the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad, and the Western Pacific Railroad, the Zephyrettes were technically Western Pacific employees and thus paid in San Francisco. At any one time, there were 10 or 11 Zephyrettes who were actively employed, with six in transit aboard trains (three heading in either direction) and two on layovers (one in San Francisco {{and the other in}} Chicago), and perhaps also an occasional trainee. A typical itinerary for a Zephyrette consisted of the two and a half day trip on the eastbound California Zephyr, a night layover at the Hilton Chicago, another two and a half day trip westbound, and then two and a half days off in San Francisco. Over the course of a month, a Zepyhrette would generally make three round trips. Some Zephyrettes worked other jobs while not aboard the California Zephyr: one, Rita Pelz, modeled for I. Magnin. The average tenure of employment for a Zephyrette was one and a half years, but some served much longer: Nellie O'Grady was already in her seventh year with the California Zephyr when <b>she</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>about</b> her experiences in the December 1955 issue of The Saturday Evening Post.|$|E
