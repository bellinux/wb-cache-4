40|$|Presented to the 11 th Annual Symposium on Graduate Research and Scholarly Projects (GRASP) {{held at the}} Heskett Center, Wichita State University, April 24, 2015. Research {{completed}} at Department of Human Performance Studies, College of EducationModern day consumer electronics are incorporating Micro Electro-Mechanical Systems nanoaccelerometers that measure the instantaneous acceleration of an object. These devices are used to measure movement from any point on the body. One such device is the iPod and iPhone developed by Apple. A company named SWAY Medical LLC developed an application using these accelerometers to assist in measuring balance to manage concussions. A recent update to the SWAY Balance application included the measurement of reaction time. This is the first mobile application to assess this neurological response with a handheld device. Currently, there is no cost-effective field assessment for determining reaction time. With this application, {{there is a possibility}} of determining reaction time. Purpose: The {{purpose of this study was}} to assess the consistency and effectiveness of the application for measuring reaction time. Methods: 50 subjects participated in 3 different trials of reaction time testing. The individuals came in and read an informed consent. The test was explained to them and asked if there were any questions. From here, the individuals were told to <b>stand</b> <b>legs</b> spread shoulder width apart. The device was placed into their hands. They held the device with straight arms and reacted to the screen color change from white to orange. This was done five times. Sex, general health, and whether or not they were student athletes was recorded, participants were also asked if they played video games. Each participant was asked to test their reaction time in 3 trials with 5 times per trial. The participants overall did the test 15 times. Results: ANOVA determined that there was no significant difference between the first test and the second test, but between the first and third there was a significant difference. Conclusion: Currently, there is no data on baseline reaction time for the mobile application. The Reaction Time App has the potential to be a very cost-effective and fast method to assessing reaction time. Further studies are needed comparing the mobile application to validated laboratory equipment to determine its clinical value. Graduate School, Academic Affairs, University Librarie...|$|E

40|$|The {{conceptual}} design and preliminary engineering calculations {{have been completed}} for a two cassette cryostat. This report summarizes the design. A cryocooler is permanently mounted {{in the center of}} a stainless steel, 0. 75 inch thick top lid. The cryocooler sits upon a spacer which raises the cooling stage elevations to favorably match the cassette heat intercept elevations. The top lid (32. 0 -inch outside diameter) mates to a 24 -inch pipe size flange with o-ring. The 24 -inch pipe size vacuum vessel with end plate has a minimum internal depth of 16 -inch to give adequate clearance for the depth of the cryocooler and multilayer insulation blankets. Support <b>stand</b> <b>legs</b> elevate the container to a convenient height and allow for placement of the AFE power supply underneath. Two cassette slots are located on either side of the cryocooler. The slots are positioned parallel to each other, 10. 5 -inch center to center (6 standard cassette slot widths) so that the standard 8 slot AFE backplane can be used. The slot opening through the lid is approximately 1. 422 -inch x 16. 782 -inch. A 0. 016 -inch thick titanium (Ti- 6 AI- 4 V) envelope with sealing lip is inserted through lid and defines the gas helium boundary that the VLPC cassette resides. The internal dimensions of the titanium envelope are 1. 390 -inch x 16. 75 -inch x 10. 531 -inch deep. When the cassette is inserted the clearances will be 0. 015 -inch on the long side, 0. 063 -inch on the short side, and 0. 032 -inch at the bottom. The cassette gasket seals against the top lip of the titanium envelope. A soft gasket or thin vacuum sealant tape seals the underside of the titanium envelope to the top surface of the lid. A clamping hold down bar may be necessary to make this vacuum seal. Gas helium for the cassette space is supplied through a fitting and port that is added to the cassette bulkhead assembly. This is the only modification necessary the standard D-Zero cassette. Evacuation and backfilling and then stagnant positive pressure are achieved through this one port. After the titanium envelope/pocket and cassette are mounted to the top lid, the lid is raised so that assembly work can be accomplished below. Three pneumatic cylinders mounted to the lid are pressurized (with air or the gas helium source) to raise the lid. Safety linkages are installed to prevent accidental lowering of the lid while work is being performed. Honeycomb sandwich panels are attached to the titanium envelope to support the thin envelope against the pressure differential. A thin thermoplastic mesh placed between the honeycomb panel and titanium envelope helps to insulate the panel so it is not a significant parallel heat path down the wall. There are two panel sets for each cassette. One for the area above the upper intercept and one set for the area below. It is reasonable that a 0. 40 -inch thick panel will suffice. A high conductance thermal link is made between the first stage of the cryocooler and the uppermost intercept location. This is solid OFHC copper part with a short section of flexible copper braid that connects to bars that clamp solidly to the long sides of the cassette envelope. Apiezon 'N' grease is used at assembly to enhance heat transfer at the clamp bar to titanium envelope interface. A second high conductance thermal connection is made between the second stage of the cryocooler and the bottom of the cassette envelope. The link is mostly solid OFHC copper along with a short flexible braid section in between. The two piece clamping bar encases the bottom 1. 75 -inch of the cassette. Thermal grease is used at the interface...|$|E

40|$|Single leg loading {{tests are}} used {{clinically}} to examine balance and loading strategies in individuals with lower limb pain. Interpretation {{of these tests}} is through pain responses and comparisons with the asymptomatic leg. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine normal differences in trunk and pelvic movement between legs during the single <b>leg</b> <b>stand,</b> single <b>leg</b> squat, hip hitch and hip drop tests, and to compare observational and quantitative assessments of trunk movement during the single leg squat test. Thirty-one asymptomatic females (age = 21. 7 ± 3. 1 years) performed each test in a random sequence and quantitative analysis of coronal plane trunk lean (magnitude and direction), and femoro-pelvic angle was conducted using photographic image analysis. Within- and between-side minimal significant differences (MD) for femoro-pelvic angle were defined for each test. All tests had excellent within-side reliability (intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) = 0. 87 - 0. 97, standard error of measurement (SEM) = 0. 6 - 1. 2 °). The between-side MD for femoro-pelvic angle was 6. 3, 6. 5, 9. 7, and 6. 7 ° for the single <b>leg</b> <b>stand,</b> single <b>leg</b> squat, hip hitch and hip drop tests respectively. The magnitude of trunk lean was small, increased with test complexity and was not consistent in relation to the stance leg. Excellent agreement (87 - 93 %) for the direction of trunk movement between observers, and between observational and quantitative analysis (80 - 96 %) was established for the single leg squat test. The patterns of trunk motion, and thresholds for significant difference in femoro-pelvic angle established in this study, will assist the interpretation of single leg loading tests in individuals with lower limb pain disorders...|$|R
