500|$|The {{station is}} {{described}} by the MTA {{as the centerpiece of}} the Hudson Park and Boulevard, {{as well as of the}} entire Hudson Yards project, which developers <b>say</b> <b>could</b> not have been started without the 7 subway extension. Horodniceanu stated that [...] "this new, modern station will be the lifeline of Manhattan's newest neighborhood. It will make it possible for thousands of residents, employees and visitors to get to Hudson Yards easily and quickly. Without the extension, this new development would not have been possible." [...] The completion of the High Line and the Hudson Boulevard, as well as the Javits Center renovation, are boosting development in the area as well. Although Hudson Yards was not finished at the time of the station's opening, the High Line and the Javits Center immediately became popular destinations for station patrons.|$|E
500|$|Despite her isolation, Charlotte found life at Cranbourne Lodge {{surprisingly}} agreeable, {{and slowly}} became reconciled to her situation. [...] At {{the end of}} July 1814, the Prince Regent visited Charlotte in her isolation and informed her {{that her mother was}} about to leave England for an extended stay on the Continent. [...] This upset Charlotte, but she did not feel that anything she might <b>say</b> <b>could</b> change her mother's mind, and was further aggrieved by her mother's casualness in the leavetaking, [...] "for God knows how long, or what events may occur before we meet again". [...] Charlotte would never see her mother again. [...] In late August, Charlotte was permitted to go to the seaside. [...] She had asked to go to fashionable Brighton, but the Prince Regent refused, sending her instead to Weymouth. [...] As the Princess's coach stopped along the way, large, friendly crowds gathered to see her; according to Holme, [...] "her affectionate welcome shows that already people thought of her as their future Queen". [...] On arrival in Weymouth, there were illuminations with a centrepiece [...] "Hail Princess Charlotte, Europe's Hope and Britain's Glory". [...] Charlotte spent time exploring nearby attractions, shopping for smuggled French silks, and from late September taking a course of heated seawater baths. [...] She was still infatuated with her Prussian, and hoped in vain that he would declare his interest in her to the Prince Regent. If he did not do so, she wrote to a friend, she would [...] "take the next best thing, which was a good tempered man with good sence ... that man is the P of S-C" [...] In mid-December, shortly before leaving Weymouth, she [...] "had a very sudden and great shock" [...] when she received news that her Prussian had formed another attachment. [...] In a long talk after Christmas dinner, father and daughter made up their differences.|$|E

The identity of the victim—whose remains, forensics experts <b>say,</b> <b>could</b> have been in the barrel for 20 years or more—and Robinson's possible involvement, remain open questions. [...] Kansas and Missouri police note that long stretches of Robinson's time remain unaccounted for, and they fear that there are additional undiscovered victims.

2500|$|The Windows {{version of}} Street Fighter IV {{includes}} all the features {{found in the}} PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 and some extras, that Capcom representatives <b>say</b> <b>could</b> make it [...] "the definitive version" [...] of the game. The game features online play via Games for Windows - LIVE, with built-in voice chat and PC-exclusive achievements, but no cross-platform playability would be available with Xbox 360 players. Also, the game features higher resolutions, and three new freely selectable visual styles, named [...] "Ink", [...] "Watercolor" [...] and [...] "Posterize". There are also two bundles of the game: regular (game only, $39.99) and a bundle that includes the Mad Catz FightPad (with the Ryu design) that is currently sold separately for the Xbox 360 version. Those who pre-ordered the game at Best Buy received a DVD with an Eagle One animated comic (this {{is not the same}} as The Ties That Bind that comes in the collector's editions of the console versions). Additionally, Svensson has stated on the Capcom Unity forums that the retail version uses disc-based SecuROM as its main form of copy protection for the North American release.|$|E
