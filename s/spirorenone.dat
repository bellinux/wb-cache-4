25|$|Spironolactone {{is closely}} {{structurally}} related to other clinically used spirolactones such as canrenone, potassium canrenoate, drospirenone, and eplerenone, {{as well as}} to the never-marketed spirolactones SC-5233 (6,7-dihydrocanrenone; 7α-desthioacetylspironolactone), SC-8109 (19-nor-6,7-dihydrocanrenone), spiroxasone, prorenone (SC-23133), mexrenone (SC-25152, ZK-32055), dicirenone (SC-26304), <b>spirorenone</b> (ZK-35973), and mespirenone (ZK-94679).|$|E
50|$|In {{clinical}} trials, <b>spirorenone</b> {{was found}} to be 4- to 10-fold as potent as spironolactone as an antimineralocorticoid, and {{is said to be the}} most active antimineralocorticoid identified to date. However, it was serendipitously and unexpectedly found that low doses of <b>spirorenone</b> lowered testosterone levels in men during clinical studies. This was determined to be due to metabolic conversion of <b>spirorenone</b> into drospirenone (1,2-dihydrospirorenone) by the enzyme Δ1-hydrase, a transformation that occurs only in monkeys and humans. Unlike <b>spirorenone,</b> drospirenone {{was found to}} be a highly potent progestin and antiandrogen in addition to antimineralocorticoid, with 8-fold the potency of spironolactone as an antimineralocorticoid and 0.3 times the potency of cyproterone acetate as an antiandrogen. Subsequently, investigation of <b>spirorenone</b> was discontinued and drospirenone was developed and eventually introduced instead as a contraceptive.|$|E
50|$|<b>Spirorenone</b> (INN) (developmental {{code name}} ZK-35973) is a steroidal antimineralocorticoid of the spirolactone {{group that was}} never marketed. <b>Spirorenone</b> {{possesses}} 5-8 times the antimineralocorticoid activity of spironolactone in animal studies. The initial discovery of <b>spirorenone</b> was deemed a great success, as no compound with greater antimineralocorticoid activity had been developed since spironolactone in 1957. Moreover, <b>spirorenone</b> itself has virtually no affinity for the androgen receptor while its progestogenic activity shows species differences, being somewhat {{greater than that of}} spironolactone in rabbits but absent in mice and rats. As such, it was characterized as a highly potent antimineralocorticoid with far fewer hormonal side effects relative to spironolactone.|$|E
5000|$|Many spirolactone antimineralocorticoids {{that were}} never marketed like dicirenone, mespirenone, mexrenone, prorenone, SC-5233 (spirolactone), <b>spirorenone,</b> and {{spiroxasone}} also show varying degrees of activity as AR antagonists.|$|E
50|$|Spironolactone {{is closely}} {{structurally}} related to other clinically used spirolactones such as canrenone, potassium canrenoate, drospirenone, and eplerenone, {{as well as}} to the never-marketed spirolactones SC-5233 (6,7-dihydrocanrenone; 7α-desthioacetylspironolactone), SC-8109 (19-nor-6,7-dihydrocanrenone), spiroxasone, prorenone (SC-23133), mexrenone (SC-25152, ZK-32055), dicirenone (SC-26304), <b>spirorenone</b> (ZK-35973), and mespirenone (ZK-94679).|$|E
50|$|The spirolactones {{include the}} marketed drugs {{spironolactone}} (SC-9420; Aldactone), canrenone (SC-9376; Cantaren, Luvion), potassium canrenoate (SC-14266; Venactone, Soldactone), eplerenone (SC-66110, CGP-30083; Inspra), and drospirenone (ZK-30595; Yasmin). Spirolactones {{that were not}} ever marketed include SC-5233, SC-8109, SC-11927 (Catatoxic Steroid 1; CS-1), spiroxasone, prorenone (SC-23133), prorenoate potassium (SC-23992), 7α-thiospironolactone (SC-24813), mexrenone (SC-25152, ZK-32055), dicirenone (SC-26304), 7α-thiomethylspironolactone (SC-26519), mexrenoate potassium (SC-26714), <b>spirorenone</b> (ZK-35973), ZK-91587 (15β,16β-methylenemexrenone), mespirenone (ZK-94679), and ZK-97894 (7α-thiomethylmespirenone). Oxprenoate potassium (RU-28318) is not a spirolactone by definition but is a closely related antimineralocorticoid that was never marketed.|$|E
