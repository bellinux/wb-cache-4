5|$|In 1864, Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa Grove {{of giant}} sequoia trees were {{transferred}} from federal to <b>state</b> <b>ownership.</b> Yosemite pioneer Galen Clark became the park's first guardian. Conditions in Yosemite Valley were made more hospitable {{to people and}} access to the park was improved in the late 19th century. Naturalist John Muir and others became increasingly alarmed about the excessive exploitation of the area. Their efforts helped establish Yosemite National Park in 1890. Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa Grove were added to the national park in 1906.|$|E

Annually, more than 4,000 volunteers contribute over 175,000 hours of effort on the Appalachian Trail, an effort coordinated largely by the Appalachian Trail Conservancy (ATC) organization. In total, the AT passes through eight national forests and two national parks.|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} we {{investigate}} {{the role played by}} the state as controlling shareholder in setting CEO incentives. Analyzing listed telecommunication companies from 13 European countries during 1999 - 2013, we measure the difference between the state and a private dominant shareholder in setting CEO compensation packages. We find that state control curbs the level of CEO compensation and this effect weakens as the <b>state’s</b> <b>ownership</b> stake increases. When we focus on CEO incentive compensation, we report that CEO pay for performance sensitivity is higher for state controlled firms than for private firms. However, as the <b>state’s</b> <b>ownership</b> stake increases, differences in sensitivity tend to disappear, but the effect of governance variables commonly used to proxy entrenchment becomes statistically significant...|$|R
5|$|Some of the privatised industries, {{including}} gas, water, and electricity, were natural monopolies {{for which}} privatisation involved little increase in competition. The privatised industries that demonstrated improvement sometimes did so while still under <b>state</b> <b>ownership.</b> British Steel Corporation had made great gains in profitability while still a nationalised industry under the government-appointed MacGregor chairmanship, which faced down trade-union opposition to close plants and halve the workforce. Regulation was also significantly expanded {{to compensate for}} the loss of direct government control, with the foundation of regulatory bodies such as Oftel (1984), Ofgas (1986), and the National Rivers Authority (1989). There was no clear pattern to the degree of competition, regulation, and performance among the privatised industries; in most cases privatisation benefited consumers in terms of lower prices and improved efficiency, but the results overall are said to have been mixed.|$|E
5|$|After the Texas Revolution ended, the {{original}} {{draft of the}} letter was given to Travis's family in Alabama. Several prominent Texians {{are known to have}} visited Travis's estranged wife shortly after the hostilities ended, but historians are unsure which of these men might have delivered the letter. Travis's daughter Susan (aged five {{at the time of his}} death) passed the letter down to her descendants; it eventually reached her great-grandson, John G. Davidson. In February 1891, Davidson lent the letter to the Texas Department of Agriculture, Insurance, Statistics, and History. Two years later, Davidson offered to sell the letter to the state of Texas for $250 ($ today). This represented half of the annual sum allocated for collecting historical manuscripts, and the state was hesitant to agree. After negotiations, Davidson agreed to accept $85 ($ today) for the letter, and on May 29 it officially passed into <b>state</b> <b>ownership.</b>|$|E
5|$|During {{a cabinet}} meeting in September 1936, Göring and Hitler {{announced}} that the German rearmament programme must be sped up. On 18 October, Hitler named Göring as Plenipotentiary of the Four Year Plan to undertake this task. Göring created a new organisation to administer the Plan and drew the ministries of labour and agriculture under its umbrella. He bypassed the economics ministry in his policy-making decisions, {{to the chagrin of}} Hjalmar Schacht, the minister in charge. Huge expenditures were made on rearmament, in spite of growing deficits. Schacht resigned on 8 December 1937, and Walther Funk took over the position, as well as control of the Reichsbank. In this way, both of these institutions were brought under Göring's control {{under the auspices of the}} Four Year Plan. In July 1937, the Reichswerke Hermann Göring was established under <b>state</b> <b>ownership</b> – though led by Göring – with the aim of boosting steel production beyond the level which private enterprise could economically provide.|$|E

5|$|In {{this book}} I {{maintained}} that a sphere of freedom is still desirable {{even in a}} socialist state, but this sphere has to be defined afresh and not in liberal terms. This doctrine I still hold. The thesis of this book seems to me important, and I hoped that it would attract more attention than it has done. It {{was intended as a}} refutation both of Marx and of the classical economists, not on a point of detail, but on the fundamental assumptions that they shared. I argued that power, rather than wealth, should be the basic concept in social theory, and that social justice should consist in equalisation of power to the greatest practicable degree. It followed that <b>State</b> <b>ownership</b> of land and capital was no advance unless the State was democratic, and even then only if methods were devised for curbing the power of officials. A part of my thesis was taken up and popularised in Burnham's Managerial Revolution, but otherwise the book fell rather flat. I still hold, however, that what it has to say is of very great importance if the evils of totalitarianism are to be avoided, particularly under a Socialist régime.|$|E

25|$|The 1863 state buyout of the Troy and Greenfield Railroad {{opened the}} way for {{competition}} through the tunnel. The Boston, Hoosac Tunnel and Western Railway was organized in 1877 to build from near the Massachusetts/Vermont border, where <b>state</b> <b>ownership</b> ended, parallel to the Troy and Boston Railroad to near Johnsonville, New York and then west via Schenectady to Rotterdam Junction on what became the New York, West Shore and Buffalo Railway in 1880.

25|$|Fascist {{governments in}} both Italy and Germany privatized {{state-owned}} enterprises at certain times. These privatizations {{were carried out}} {{in the early stages of}} both regimes (1922-25 for Italy and 1934-37 for Germany), and represented a reversal of the policies of the democratic governments which had preceded them. The democratic governments had brought a number of industries under <b>state</b> <b>ownership,</b> and the fascists decided to return them to private ownership. In doing so, they went against the mainstream economic trends of their time, when most Western governments were increasing <b>state</b> <b>ownership.</b> Fascist privatization policies were driven by a desire to secure the support of wealthy industrialists, as well as by the need to increase government revenues in order to balance budgets. Significantly, fascist governments were among the first to undertake large-scale privatizations in modern times.|$|E
25|$|After {{three decades}} of reform, China's economy {{experienced}} one of the world's biggest booms. Agriculture and light industry have largely been privatized, while the state still retains control over some heavy industries. Despite the dominance of <b>state</b> <b>ownership</b> in finance, telecommunications, petroleum and other important sectors of the economy, private entrepreneurs continue to expand into sectors formerly reserved for public enterprise. Prices have also been liberalized.|$|E

25|$|Another {{criticism}} is that IMF programs are only {{designed to address}} poor governance, excessive government spending, excessive government intervention in markets, and too much <b>state</b> <b>ownership.</b> This assumes that this narrow range of issues represents the only possible problems; everything is standardised and differing contexts are ignored.

40|$|The {{cognitive}} agent model {{presented in}} this paper generates prior and retrospective <b>ownership</b> <b>states</b> for an action based on principles from recent neurological theories. A prior <b>ownership</b> <b>state</b> is affected by prediction of the effects of a prepared action, and exerts control by strengthening or suppressing actual execution of the action. A retrospective <b>ownership</b> <b>state</b> depends on whether the sensed consequences co-occur with the predicted consequences, and is the basis for acknowledging authorship of actions, for example, in social context. It is shown how poor action effect prediction capabilities can lead to reduced retrospective <b>ownership</b> <b>states,</b> as in persons suffering from schizophrenia. ...|$|R
30|$|In {{addition}} to awareness <b>states,</b> <b>ownership</b> <b>states</b> for an action are also considered in this paper.

The structure of the paper organised with a conceptual basis that includes evidences from cognitive neuroscience which followed with a model description in which a detail explanation of the model together with its mathematical basis and formal specification will be presented. To validate the workings of the proposed model, eight scenarios are simulated through a unique parameter value set which was estimated using a systematic approach. Finally, a discussion will be presented highlighting the usefulness of a model in this nature and future works.|$|R
25|$|While {{most of the}} Palestinian Arab {{population}} that remained in Israel after the war was granted an Israeli citizenship, Arab Israelis were subject to martial law up to 1966.

25|$|In 1946, the North {{implemented}} land reforms by confiscating private property, Japanese and pro-Japanese owned {{facilities and}} factories, {{and placed them}} under <b>state</b> <b>ownership.</b> Demand for land reform in the South grew strong, and it was eventually enacted in June 1949. Koreans with large landholdings were obliged to divest most of their land. Approximately 40 percent of total farm households became small landowners.

Rather than holding to an apocalyptic view of attaining socialism through armed revolution, editor Mengshoel was influenced by the ideas of writers Laurence Gronlund and Edward Bellamy, emphasizing the functional superiority of the economic form of <b>state</b> <b>ownership</b> and the implication that evolution to socialist production and distribution would be a protracted, inevitable, evolutionary process.|$|E
