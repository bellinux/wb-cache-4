We developed a simple linear model to estimate the contribution of individual cows to the genomic DNA present in the tank milk from 1) the known genotypes of individual cows for the interrogated SNP and 2) the ratio of SNP alleles in the tank milk. Using simulations, we estimate that 3, 000, 50, 000, and 700, 000 SNP are sufficient to accurately (R(2) > 0. 98) estimate individual SCC in tanks containing milk from 25, 100, and 500 cows, respectively.

This trend is unlike that of microfiltration, where it has been observed that TGF-β 2 was equally distributed between casein and whey proteins. The concentration obtained by vacuum evaporation showed a concentration factor less than 1 for TGF-β 2 once the constituents other than TGF-β 2 became more concentrated.

Viable counts obtained from milk bottle rinses indicated that bottle washing was often unsatisfactory, and on one occasion Y. frederiksenii was isolated from the pooled rinse water of six bottles.

40|$|Meat {{and dairy}} {{products}} are a key source of human exposure to persistent lipophilic organic contaminants (e. g. PCBs, PCDD/Fs). The primary source of these contaminants to beef and dairy cows is the ingestion of contaminated herbage and supplementary feeds. In turn, herbage is primarily supplied with such contaminants via atmospheric deposition. An in-depth understanding of the transfer of semi-volatile contaminants (SOCs) from air–grass–cow–human is therefore required to quantify and manage this exposure pathway. This paper is concerned with modelling/predicting milk and tissue contaminant burdens, given information on measured herbage concentrations. As a result of numerous studies on the transfer of organic contaminants within agricultural foodchains (e. g.

In order to investigate any resulting impact on the Irish population, these contaminants were measured in pooled breast milk samples from 109 first-time mothers, collected in 2010. A comparison of the results with similar data from 2002 revealed generally lower concentrations of PCDD/Fs and dioxin-like PCBs in the 2010 samples, confirming the declining trend reported by many authors. Contaminant concentration levels for both 2002 and 2010 were generally slightly lower than those reported internationally, with a mean combined PCDD/F and PCB WHO-TEQ of 9. 66 pgg(- 1) fat, for an overall pooled <b>sample</b> <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> from 2010.

It is improbable, however, that any single test can be evolvedI which would fulfil all these conditions {{and at the same time}} be reliable. Since the only satisfactory basis, from a commercial point c: view, upon which to judge the cleanliness of a milk, is by the tinle which elapses before it actually sours, this question must receive primary consideration. Milk may be of high food value and free from pathogenic bacteria, but if it sours within a few hours of delivery, it is of little use. The keeping quality of milk is inti...|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed at}} {{comparing}} the colostrum composition {{and production of}} Alentejano Swine Breed (AL) to modern sows (LW x LR) (LL). Ten sows from each genotype were used. All farrowings were attended. Colostrum samples were collected at birth of the first piglet and at regular intervals during 36 h after the onset of farrowing. One <b>sample</b> <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> was also collected at d 15 of lactation. Piglets were weighed at birth and at 24 h of age. AL sows had lower gestation length (p < 0. 001) and litter size (p < 0. 05). Piglets from AL sow were lighter at birth (p < 0. 001), gained less weight (p < 0. 001) and consumed less colostrum (p < 0. 001) than LL piglets between birth and 24 h of age. AL sows produced less colostrum (p < 0. 001) than LL sows. Within each genotype colostrum consumption of piglets was dependent on birth weight (p < 0. 001). Production of colostrum was dependent on litter weight (piglets born alive) at birth but not on litter size. Mortality rate between birth and weaning averaged 24. 3 % for AL piglets and 14. 3 % for the LL piglets, with most of losses occurring within 3 days after birth. In both genotypes, piglets dying before weaning were lighter at birth and consumed less colostrum than survivors. Further studies are required to determine the respective role of birth weight and colostrum consumption in post-natal mortality and to determine the immune quality of colostrum...|$|E
40|$|The {{potential}} {{presence of}} toxic metals in food is being {{recognized as a}} priority by standards organizations and constitutes an analytical challenge. The toxic metal content <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> and dairy products is due to several factors: environmental conditions, the manufacturing process and the possible contamination during several steps of the manufacturing processes. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate <b>samples</b> <b>of</b> raw <b>milk</b> with fat contents 3. 8 % obtained at randomly from animal farms in around Nitra, western Slovakia region and ultra – heat treated cow milk (UHT) with fat contents 1. 5 % commercially available from local market in Nitra. <b>Samples</b> <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> were analysed for metal contents using atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS). UHT milk showed higher levels of cadmium, nickel and iron. Higher levels of zinc, copper were detected in raw milk. Significant differences in the concentration of copper between raw and UHT cow milk were found...|$|R
40|$|The culture <b>of</b> a <b>sample</b> <b>of</b> {{bulk tank}} <b>milk</b> {{may be a}} useful {{technique}} by which to screen herds for major mastitis pathogens. Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae, if identified on a culture <b>of</b> a <b>sample</b> <b>of</b> bulk <b>milk,</b> reliably indicate infection of the udder. Environmental bacteria, such as the other streptococci and coliforms, {{are unlikely to be}} indicative of the proportion of cows infected with these organisms...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{available}} online at www. jprhc. in Streptococcus {{is considered to be}} one of the most dangerous causes of Clinical mastitis in cows. The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of extracts prepared from different parts of the flowing plants: Oleaeuropea Linn(Oleaceae), Myrtuscommunis Linn (Liliaceae),thymus vulgaris Linn (Laminaceae), Rosemery Linn(Laminaceae), Ficuscarica Linn (Moraceae), and Achilleafalcata Linn(Asteraceae) against resistant Streptococcus in 1371 <b>Samples</b> <b>of</b> <b>milk.</b> This work was achieved in four stages: First of all, the presence of Streptococcus in 1371 <b>Samples</b> <b>of</b> <b>milk,</b> by using blood agar, Bile Esculin agar, and some bio-chemical tests were investigated. Secondly, the antibacterial activity of many antibiotics on these bacteria by using disc diffusion method were determined. Thirdly, the plants were extracted with water, absolute alcohol, and petroleum Ether by using soxhlet apparatus and rotary vacuum evaporator. Fourthly, the antibacterial activity of the extractions on resistant Streptococcus was determined by using disc diffusion method. This study has shown the presence of different antibacterial effectiveness of the extracts prepared from different parts of those plants. The extract of thymus vulgaris is more effective when compared to the extract of Oleaeur opaea against resistant Streptococcus...|$|R
