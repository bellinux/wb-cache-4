40|$|Abstract A {{conservative}} discretization of {{the ocean}} primitive equations for global ocean dynamics is formulated on an unstructured grid. The grid consists of triangular cells with a C-type staggering of variables, where scalar variables are located at centers of grid cells and normal components of velocity are placed at cell boundaries. Reconstructions, necessitated by the staggering of variables, are chosen from a set of admissible reconstructions such that the discrete equations obey a weighted weak form, which guarantees discrete conservation properties. At {{the same time a}} spurious mode, specific to the triangular C-grid, is controlled {{in a way that is}} compatible with conservation properties. The conservation properties of the discrete model are verified. Numerical simulations are presented, ranging from idealized geophysical flows to an ocean simulation at eddy-permitting resolution, in order to <b>substantiate</b> the <b>statement</b> that global ocean dynamics can be formulated on triangular C-grids...|$|R

While the typical forms of action of these movements, the acampada, were not very widespread in Italy in 2011, there were mobilisations for social justice and participatory democracy which indeed resonated with the frames that developed in Spain, Greece and the United States. Research based on surveys at three protest events indicates in fact that, in Italy too, protest concerning social issues is linked with extremely low and declining levels of trust in institutions, but also with calls for more political intervention to address social inequalities. After briefly presenting the methodology used in the surveys, the authors empirically <b>substantiate</b> this <b>statement</b> by looking at the political positions as well as the framing processes of the protestors interviewed.

In this paper, we compare RSOA-FCLs with alternative colorless sources, namely the amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) spectrum-sliced and the externally seeded RSOAs. We compare the differences in output power, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), relative intensity noise (RIN), frequency response and transmission characteristics of these three sources.
