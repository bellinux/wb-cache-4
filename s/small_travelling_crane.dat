40|$|The {{serious problem}} in <b>travelling</b> <b>cranes</b> maintenance, crane {{supporting}} beams and other carrying elements of material handling facilities in foundry shops is phenomenon of permanent deformations. There are known many ways to eliminate these deformations like mechanical compression by tension members however a disadvantage of such methods is work consuming process of railways rectification. One of technological methods relies on application of shrinkage of compression plates welded with box girder. Regeneration {{with the use of}} such method can be executed for the <b>travelling</b> <b>cranes</b> box girders but also with <b>travelling</b> <b>crane</b> support beams that have permanent deformations in both vertical or horizontal planes. In this paper different variants of such process execution are presented, depending on the kind and dimension of the permanent deformation...|$|R
