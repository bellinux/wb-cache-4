Nevertheless, efforts are underway to study the non-gravimetric accelerations on the spacecraft, in the hopes of having them well modeled for the long cruise to Pluto after the Jupiter fly-by that occurred in February 2007.

40|$|<b>Spin-stabilised</b> {{control was}} a pioneer {{spacecraft}} control method before a three-axis stabilised control was widely used. <b>Spin-stabilised</b> spacecraft, or spinner, uses this simple but robust method in controlling or manoeuvring {{the body in the}} microgravity environment. Surrey Space Centre (SSC) is currently spearheading the research in this area for a prolate shape spinner {{as a result of its}} involvement in the Moon Lightweight Interior and Telecoms Experiment (LITE) surface penetrator mission development funded by Astrium. The penetrator is a missile-shaped spacecraft used for delivering required mission equipment to the subsurface of the intended planet or celestial body. It is <b>spin-stabilised</b> after release from the orbiter before it is slewed to achieve a desired angle while free falling to the surface. The work described in the thesis is the ongoing development of the slew control algorithms by SSC as mentioned above. State-of-the-art algorithms have been developed, namely the Half-Cone (HC) derived family and pulse-train family. These algorithms have been proven theoretically, but implementation in a real-time mission is yet to be done, except for the Rhumb Line slew control. In particular, this thesis addresses the issue of the asymmetric shape of the developed prolate spacecraft where, in theory, it has been assumed as perfectly symmetric. Three new algorithms based on the HC-derived family that consider this asymmetric factor are discussed. The significant improvement made by these novel algorithms is the mass reduction of the final residual nutation in an average of one tenth of the current algorithm. Further analysis is done to these new algorithms in terms of accuracy, energy efficiency, slew time, the effect of thruster response time and gravity. The performance of these new algorithms in controlling an extreme asymmetric case is described first before it is applied to a common prolate-shaped spacecraft. An attempt to develop a testbed is also discussed within the work...|$|E
40|$|While solar sails {{are capable}} of {{providing}} continuous low thrust propulsion the size and flexibility of the sail structure poses difficulties to their attitude control. Rapid slewing of the sail can cause excitation of structural modes, resulting in flexing and oscillation of the sail film and a subsequent loss of performance and decrease in controllability. Disk shaped solar sails are particularly flexible as they have no supporting structure and so these spacecraft must be spun around their major axis to stiffen the sail membrane via the centrifugal force. In addition to stiffening the structure this spin stabilisation also provides gyroscopic stiffness to disturbances, aiding the spacecraft in maintaining its desired attitude. A method is applied which generates smooth reference motions between arbitrary orientations for a <b>spin-stabilised</b> disk sail. The method minimises the sum square of the body rates of the spacecraft, therefore ensuring that the generated attitude slews are slow and smooth, while the spin stabilisation provides gyroscopic stiffness to disturbances. An application of Pontryagin’s maximum principle yields an optimal Hamiltonian which is completely solvable in closed form. The resulting analytical expressions are a function of several free parameters enabling parametric optimisation {{to be used to}} provide reference motions which match prescribed boundary conditions on the initial and final configurations. The generated reference motions are utilised in the repointing of a 70 m radius <b>spin-stabilised</b> disk solar sail in a heliocentric orbit, with the aim of assessing the feasibility of the motion planning method in terms of the control torques required to track the motions...|$|E
40|$|The {{attitude}} {{dynamics and}} manoeuvre survey {{in this paper}} is performed for a mission scenario involving a penetrator-type spacecraft: an axisymmetric prolate spacecraft spinning around its minor axis of inertia performing a 90 spin axis reorientation manoeuvre. In contrast to most existing spacecraft only one attitude control thruster is available, providing a control torque perpendicular to the spin axis. Having only one attitude thruster on a spinning spacecraft could be preferred for spacecraft simplicity (lower mass, lower power consumption etc), {{or it could be}} imposed in the context of redundancy/ contingency operations. This constraint does yield restrictions on the thruster timings, depending on the ratio of minor to major moments of inertia among other parameters. The Japanese Lunar-A penetrator spacecraft proposal {{is a good example of}} such a single-thruster <b>spin-stabilised</b> prolate spacecraft. The attitude dynamics of a spinning rigid body are first investigated analytically, then expanded for the specific case of a prolate and axisymmetric rigid body and finally a cursory exploration of non-rigid body dynamics is made. Next two well-known techniques for manoeuvring a <b>spin-stabilised</b> spacecraft, the Half-cone/Multiple Half- cone and the Rhumb line slew, are compared with two new techniques, the Sector-Arc Slew developed by Astrium Satellites and the Dual-cone developed at Surrey Space Centre. Each technique is introduced and characterised by means of simulation results and illustrations based on the penetrator mission scenario and a brief robustness analysis is performed against errors in moments of inertia and spin rate. Also, the relative benefits of each slew algorithm are discussed in terms of slew accuracy, energy (propellant) efficiency and time efficiency. For example, a sequence of half-cone manoeuvres (a Multi-half-cone manoeuvre) tends to be more energy-efficient than one half-cone for the same final slew angle, but more time-consuming. As another example, the new Sector-Arc Slew and Dual-cone techniques are designed to overcome a specific restriction on attainable slew angle that is associated with the half-cone manoeuvre, giving one additional degree of freedom for designers to fine-tune. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd...|$|E
40|$|In {{the field}} of {{attitude}} dynamics and control, passive spacecraft attitude control by spin-stabilisation can already be considered a venerable technique, almost as old as spaceflight itself thanks to its simplicity. Even today it is still used {{in a variety of}} missions, ranging from stabilisation during an orbit boost, e. g. the deployment of the first two Galileo IOV spacecraft, to deep-space astronomy, e. g. the Planck space telescope. Mission concepts have been proposed for <b>spin-stabilised</b> penetrator-like spacecraft targeting non-atmospheric celestial bodies such as the Moon, in the Japanese Lunar-A and the British MoonLITE mission proposals, or Jupiter's Galilean moon Europa in the joint NASA-ESA Europa-Jupiter System Mission (EJSM) proposal, which has recently been extensively remodelled to the mainly European Jupiter Icy Moon Explorer (JUICE). However, the same gyroscopic stability that resists unwanted disturbance torques also has an impact on the commanded manoeuvres. Several techniques have been developed to take into account and whenever possible benefit from the gyroscopic phenomena exhibited by a spinning spacecraft. This thesis will give an overview of the PhD project on single-thruster attitude control of a prolate axisymmetric spacecraft, <b>spin-stabilised</b> around its minimum moment of inertia axis. Having only one attitude thruster on a spinning spacecraft could be preferred for spacecraft simplicity (less mass, less power consumption etc.), or it could be imposed in case of e. g. contingency operations. First of all, the current state-of-the-art slew algorithms Halfcone, Multi-cone, Rhumb Line and the newer Astrium algorithm Sector-Arc Slew have been investigated and qualified. Next, two novel slew algorithms have been identified and developed. One of these is the Extended Halfcone, based on previous sse work. As the name implies, its intention is to extend the usual Half-cone slew algorithm with a mild form of error correction. Another novel algorithm, the Dual-cone slew was designed to overcome the Half-cone limitations regarding attainable slew angles. It is capable of reaching almost any slew angle using two Half-conesj its energy and time consumption performance is comparable to a Multi-cone slew.

40|$|The static {{deflection}} {{profile of a}} large <b>spin-stabilised</b> space reflector due to solar radiation pressure acting on its surface is investigated. Such a spacecraft consists of a thin reflective circular film, which is deployed from a supporting hoop structure in an untensioned, slack manner. This paper investigates {{the use of a}} variable reflectivity distribution across the surface to control the solar pressure force and hence the deflected shape. In this first analysis, the film material is modelled as one-dimensional slack radial strings with no resistance to bending or transverse shear, which enables a semi-analytic derivation of the nominal deflection profile. An inverse method is then used to find the reflectivity distribution that generates a specific, for example, parabolic deflection shape of the strings. Applying these results to a parabolic reflector, short focal distances can be obtained when large slack lengths of the film are employed. The development of such optically controlled reflector films enables future key mission applications such as solar power collection, radio-frequency antennae and optical telescopes...|$|E
40|$|The idea of {{exploiting}} {{solar radiation}} pressure for space travel, or solar sailing, {{is more than}} a 100 years old, and yet most of the research thus far has considered {{only a limited number of}} sail configurations. However solar sails do not have to be inertially-pointing squares, <b>spin-stabilised</b> discs or heliogyros: there is a range of different configurations and concepts that present some advantageous features. This chapter will show and discuss three non-conventional solar sail configurations and their applications. In the first, the sail is complemented by an electric thruster, resulting in a hybrid-propulsion spacecraft which is capable to hover above the Earth’s Poles in a stationary position (pole-sitter). The second concept makes use of a variable-geometry pyramidal sail, naturally pointing towards the sun, to increase or decrease the orbit altitude without the need of propellant or attitude manoeuvres. Finally, the third concept shows that the orbit altitude can also be changed, without active manoeuvres or geometry change, if the sail naturally oscillates synchronously with the orbital motion. The main motivation behind these novel configurations is to overcome some of the engineering limitations of solar sailing; the resulting concepts pose some intriguing orbital and attitude dynamics problems, which will be discussed...|$|E

The measurements will be made from geostationary orbit and will complement those planned from instruments in low Earth polar orbits. The data from GERB will provide the first consistent measurements of the hour-by-hour variation of clouds and simultaneous measurements of the radiation balance, and will allow climate models to be further developed and validated. The instrument will accumulate images of the Earth disc every 15 minutes in wavebands of 0. 32 - 4. 0 m and 0. 32 - 30 m with a nadir resolution of 50 km. The detector for this instrument consists of a 256 pixel linear array of thermoelectric (TE) elements. The TE array operates at room temperature and is blacked to give a flat spectral response over the 0. 32 - 30 m band.

40|$|The {{subject of}} the project Continuum Methods for Large Flexible Structures is the {{improvement}} of the Dynamic Stiffness Method (DSM) for application to large flexible spacecraft, e. g. satellites with flexible appendages. The method is especially suitable for use in modal analysis. The DSM may also be helpful during pre-design of structures as a fast as well as highly accurate tool. With respect to numerical procedures non-linear effects as well as gyroscopic ones in case of <b>spin-stabilised</b> satellites have to be presented. Externally applied effects like gravity or thermal loading in space have not been considered. Within the DSM forces and moments acting on a structure are related by the dynamic stiffness matrix, often called impedance matrix, to the translational and rotational system degrees of freedom. It has been among others developed and used at ESA/ESTEC since the mid seventies. It was incorporated into a fast and easily applicable computer programmes (DISTEL, VAMP) containing an element library and algorithms of solution procedures. The state of development and application at ESA/ESTEC is illustrated by examples. The inherent capacity of extending the DSM to more complex spacecraft configurations, especially to rotating ones has been examined. Surveying the theoretical background of analytical dynamics the important methods in use are compared with the DSM to show its advantages in modal analysis. Consequently, the existing discrete and continuous elements developed for use within the DSM are presented and extended by flexible booms attached to spinning spacecraft. On the basis of the non-linearly pre-deformed, quasi-static equilibrium state the dynamic stiffness matrices to analyse small vibration about this state have been derived. The element library has also been extended by procedures to include measured relations to a stiffness matrix. Rules of assembling structures of several elements, procedures to determine the equilibrium state, to assess stability of a dynamic structural system, and the problem of transcendental eigenvalues and modes have been discussed by presenting the available solution methods...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{describes the}} development and implementation of a computer-based photometric data acquisition system for the Mt Canopus telescope. The high-speed photometric system allows continuous acquisition of data, for up to — 69 min with a maximum sample rate of 9. 8 kHz, while providing a real time display of the counts. The system was thoroughly tested with a pulsing LED source and with observations of the Crab pulsar. The results from several observational programs, suited to the system's capabilities, are also presented. The observational programs involved a study of the DQ Her type cataclysmic variable EX Hydrae, a fast photometric study of geostationary <b>spin-stabilised</b> satellites, a monitoring program on SN 1987 a, and an occultation program which culminated in a successful observation of a Pluto occultation and the detection of an atmosphere on this planet. The Mark I version of the fast-photometer system was used for the photoelectric study program on the eclipsing cataclysmic variable EX Hya. This program demonstrated the continued secular decrease in the period of its 67 min modulation. The observed rate of change of the 67 min period implies a mass transfer rate of the order of — 3 x 10 - 11 Mo yr- 1 and a magnetic moment around 8 x 10 32 G cm 3. Two variations in the eclipse timings are also identified. Firstly, one sees a long-term variation that has been fitted with an — 20 yr period sinusoid. Secondly, one sees a short-term variation which is correlated with the phase of the 67 min cycle. This second variation has been interpreted in terms of the eclipse of an accretion column or arc in the region above the magnetic pole of the white dwarf. Supplementary to the photometric data, high time resolution spectroscopic data from an eclipse of EX Hya were obtained with the Anglo-Australian telescope. These data are compatible with the general spectral characteristics noted by other workers. The V/R ratio of the spectral lines, around orbital phase 098 = 0, is consistent with the eclipse of an accretion disk. A sharp peak in the equivalent width of the Balmer lines is seen at the time of the eclipse. It is comparable in width to the X-ray eclipses, and narrower than the optical eclipses. Finally, the accretion curtain model of EX Hya is shown to accommodate, in a qualitative sense, all the observational constraints that must be imposed on any model of the system...|$|E
40|$|Equator-S is a {{scientific}} satellite {{for the investigation}} of the magnetosphere of the earth under the responsibility of the Max-Planck-Institute für extraterrestrische Physik (MPE) in Garching, Germany. Mission Operations are performed by DLR's German Space Operations Center. The spacecraft has been launched on Dec. 4, 1997 into a final highly eccentric 500 x 65000 km orbit where it was <b>spin-stabilised</b> with magnetic torquers to control both spin rate and spin axis direction. The torquing maneuvers took place within 2, 5 Earth radii altitude around perigee. After separation from the Ariane- 4 launcher the main attitude maneuvers were the changes of the spin axis attitude from nearly parallel to the ecliptic up to 90 °. There is a constraint for the sun-aspect-angle of the solar panels mounted on the surfaces of the cylindrical spacecraft. Therefore it is urgent to control not only the final spin axis orientation but also the trajectory from the initial to the final attitude. For this process the often used Shigehara algorithm had been implemented which uses the actual attitude, a selectable target attitude, orbit information and a model of the earth's magnetic field. By reducing the error in the angular momentum using an asymptotic stability criteria a switching function for the magnetic coils for periods around perigee is derived. Originally this strategy requires attitude determination and commanding capability once per orbit (every 22 h for Equator-S) to feed the Shigehara algorithm. In order to reduce ground station time and operator workload a different approach was implemented by using dedicated flight dynamics simulation and attitude determination algorithms. As described in earlier papers an object oriented approach for the flight dynamics simulation had been developed for mission analysis and preparation. The capabilities of this system {{turned out to be the}} key for low cost attitude operations. Its performance had been validated to be precise enough to predict the attitude dynamics for 4 to 6 days. I. e. the crucial torquer and antenna switching commands could be prepared in advance for usually 4 days. The simulation results were cross-checked and the system parameters validated using attitude determination results despite downlink intervals less frequent than planned. In this paper the results of this more offline-oriented low cost operations strategy are presented and it is shown how precise the attitude control requirements could be met. It is demonstrated how operational resources can be saved by efforts in mission preparations and sophisticated flight dynamics systems even and especially for small satellite missions...|$|E
