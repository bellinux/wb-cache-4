This is {{particularly}} evident with minimal or no post-reconstruction filtering, {{which has been}} <b>shown</b> <b>in</b> <b>phantom</b> studies with numerical observers to provide greater lesion detectability [28]-[30]. Changes to SUVmax {{as a consequence of}} PSF modelling present a challenge as changes to defined local practice for reporting may be required such as changing the thresholds used for the discrimination of malignancy. The scanner used in this study has been part of a multi-site network of scanners for routine FDG oncology imaging since 2009. SUVmax is the reported uptake metric, and the consensus amongst local reporting clinicians within the network is that lesions with SUVmax > 5.0 are considered highly suspicious of malignant disease.|$|E
30|$|As {{could be}} <b>shown</b> <b>in</b> <b>phantom</b> measurements, a {{reduction}} of the image length is a valuable way of reducing the dose to the fetus. Sparing the lung bases yields significant fetal dose reduction [65, 72]. Emboli that could be missed on CT sparing the lung bases {{are to be found}} in a subsegmental distribution. The clinical significance of subsegmental pulmonary embolism is still debated controversially. It has been suggested that emboli in the subsegmental pulmonary arteries do not contribute substantially to morbidity and mortality, and taking into account the uncertainty regarding the necessity of treating patients with isolated subsegmental PE, the clinical impact of the depiction of subsegmental clots still remains unclear [73 – 75]. Based on this assumption protocols can be used covering not the whole lung but sparing the lung bases to maximise the distance between the fetus and the edge of the image [65, 76].|$|E
40|$|Positron Emission Tomography (PET) {{images are}} prone to motion {{artefacts}} due to the long acquisition time of PET measurements. Recently, simultaneous magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and PET have become available in {{the first generation of}} Hybrid MR-PET scanners. In this work, the elimination of artefacts due to head motion in PET neuroimages is achieved by a new approach utilising MR-based motion tracking in combination with PET list mode data motion correction for simultaneous MR-PET acquisitions. The method comprises accurate MR-based motion measurements, an intra-frame motion minimising and reconstruction time reducing temporal framing algorithm, and a list mode based PET reconstruction which utilises the Ordinary Poisson Algorithm and avoids axial and transaxial compression. Compared to images uncorrected for motion, an increased image quality is <b>shown</b> <b>in</b> <b>phantom</b> as well as in vivo images. In vivo motion corrected images show an evident increase of contrast at the basal ganglia and a good visibility of uptake in tiny structures such as superior colliculi...|$|E

Imbert et al. [21] reported the following classification of measured central spatial resolution: DNM 530 c (6.7  mm) and DSPECT (8.6  mm). These results are concordant with previous findings by Bailliez et al.

30|$|For {{segmentation}} {{of prostate}} cancer lesions, all mpMRI series were reviewed on a PACS workstation (McKesson, San Francisco, CA, USA). Two fellowship-trained expert prostate MRI readers were tasked to contour the histologically known significant prostate cancer on the T 2 w sequence simulating a target volume definition for focal prostate cancer treatment. For this purpose, the readers had full knowledge of the prior reports of the in vivo mpMRI scans {{as well as all}} histological reports of prior biopsies, including targeted biopsies based on mpMRI lesions identified. The readers were blinded to the segmentation of the other reader as well as blinded to the results from 18 F-choline PET, the ex vivo specimen MRI scans, and the final histology from prostatectomy. After identification of a candidate lesion, an individual tumor volume of interest (VOI) was defined based on the basis of visual perception of the lesion borders on a MIM Maestro (MIM Software, Cleveland, OH, USA) workstation and assigned as seg 1 (reader 1) and seg 2 (reader 2) for each case. A semiautomatic gradient-based segmentation method (PETEdge, MIM Software, Cleveland, OH, USA) without manual adjustments was used to determine the borders of the MRI-identified lesions on 18 F-choline PET (assigned as seg 3) [25]. Furthermore, all three segmentation volumes of a given tumor were spatially combined (union of seg 1, seg 2, seg 3 [*]=[*]seg 4) for further analysis. Gradient edge detection identifies tumor {{on the basis of a}} change in SUV at the tumor border. The particular gradient method used calculates spatial derivatives along tumor radii then defines the tumor edge on the basis of derivative levels and continuity of the tumor edge. This well-established method has been <b>shown</b> <b>in</b> <b>phantom</b> studies to be more accurate and reproducible compared to manual segmentation as well as threshold methods determining the tumor border on the basis of a percentage of the maximum activity within the tumor [26].|$|E
40|$|To {{develop a}} {{chemical}} shift encoding (CSE) approach for fluorine- 19 MRI of perfluorocarbons {{in the presence}} of multiple known fluorinated chemical species. A multi-echo CSE technique is applied for spectral separation of the perfluorocarbon perfluoro- 15 -crown- 5 -ether (PFCE) and isoflurane (ISO) based on their chemical shifts at 4. 7 [*]T. Cramér-Rao lower bound analysis is used to identify echo combinations with optimal signal-to-noise performance. Signal contributions are fit with a multispectral fluorine signal model using a non-linear least squares estimation reconstruction directly from k-space data. This CSE approach is tested <b>in</b> fluorine- 19 <b>phantoms</b> and <b>in</b> a mouse with a 2 D and 3 D spoiled gradient-echo acquisition using multiple echo times determined from Cramér-Rao lower bound analysis. Cramér-Rao lower bound analysis for PFCE and ISO separation shows signal-to-noise performance is maximized with a 0. 33 ms echo separation. A linear behavior (R(2) [*]=[*] 0. 987) between PFCE signal and known relative PFCE volume is observed in CSE reconstructed images using a mixed PFCE/ISO phantom. Effective spatial and spectral separation of PFCE and ISO is <b>shown</b> <b>in</b> <b>phantoms</b> and <b>in</b> vivo. Feasibility of a gradient-echo CSE acquisition and image reconstruction approach with optimized noise performance is demonstrated through fluorine- 19 MRI of PFCE with effective removal of ISO signal contributions.

However, {{the effect of}} longer path length photons is typically unknown and poses a limitation towards absolute quantification. In this work, LSI is integrated with spatial frequency domain imaging (SFDI) to suppress multiple scattering and absorption effects. First, depth sensitive speckle contrast is <b>shown</b> <b>in</b> <b>phantoms</b> by separating a deep source (4 mm) from a shallow source (2 mm) of speckle contrast by using a high spatial frequency of illumination (0. 24 mm− 1). We develop an SFD adapted correlation diffusion model and show that with high frequency (0. 24 mm− 1) illumination, doubling of absorption contrast results in only a 1 % change in speckle contrast versus 25 % change using a planar unmodulated (0 mm− 1) illumination. Similar absorption change is mimicked in vivo imaging a finger occlusion and the relative speckle contrast change from baseline is 10 % at 0. 26 mm− 1 versus 60 % at 0 mm− 1 during a finger occlusion. These results underscore the importance of path length and optical properties in determining speckle contrast. They provide an integrated approach for simultaneous mapping of blood flow (speckle contrast) and oxygenation (optical properties) {{which can be used}} to inform tissue metabolism...|$|R

30|$|Making the antecubital vein {{as large}} as {{possible}} increases the chances of cannulating the vessel on the first attempt. Two tourniquets were placed around the patient's upper arm as he isometrically squeezed his fist. Witting has shown that patients with antecubital veins measured less than 4 mm (they did not specify external vs. internal diameter vein measurements) had a 61 % overall ultrasound guided antecubital catheterization failure rate [15]. Although Blaivas et al. have shown that novice ultrasound users were able to obtain vascular access faster using the short-axis approach <b>in</b> a vascular <b>phantom</b> model [2], Sierzenski et al. and Stone et al. have <b>shown</b> <b>in</b> vascular <b>phantom</b> models that novice ultrasound users had improved accuracy of identifying the needle tip with a long-axis ultrasound transducer orientation [13, 16].

40|$|In {{combined}} clinical optoacoustic (OA) and ultrasound (US) imaging, epi-mode irradiation and detection {{integrated into}} one single probe offers flexible imaging {{of the human}} body. The imaging depth in epi-illumination is, however, strongly affected by clutter. As <b>shown</b> <b>in</b> previous <b>phantom</b> experiments, the location of irradiation {{plays an important role}} in clutter generation. We investigated the influence of the irradiation geometry on the local image contrast of clinical images, by varying the separation distance between the irradiated area and the acoustic imaging plane of a linear ultrasound transducer in an automated scanning setup. The results for different volunteers show that the image contrast can be enhanced on average by 25 % and locally by more than a factor of two, when the irradiated area is slightly separated from the probe. Our findings have an important impact on the design of future optoacoustic probes for clinical application...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} pulse {{sequence}} that combines a displacement-encoded stimulated echo with rapid sampling of k-space by means of turbo spin echo imaging. The stimulated echo {{enables the use of}} long observation times between the two pulsed field gradients that sample q-space completely. Propagators, constructed with long observation times, could discriminate slowly flowing protons from diffusing protons, as <b>shown</b> <b>in</b> a <b>phantom</b> <b>in</b> which a plug flow with linear velocity of 50 &mgr;m/s could clearly be distinguished from stationary water. As a biological application the apparent diffusion constant in longitudinal direction of a transverse image of a maize plant stem had been measured as a function of observation time. Increasing contrast in the apparent diffusion constant image with increasing observation times were caused by differences in plant tissue: although the plant stem did not take up any water, the vascular bundles, concentrated in the outer ring of the stem, could still be discerned because of their longer unrestricted diffusional pathways for water in the longitudinal direction compared to cells in the parenchymal tissue. In the xylem region of a tomato pedicel flowing water could be distinguished from a large amount of stationary water. Linear flow velocities up to 0. 67 mm/s were measured with an observation time of 180 ms...|$|R
40|$|Chronic pain {{is usually}} underestimated in children, {{due to lack}} of {{knowledge}} and its specific signs. In addition to suffering, chronic pain causes a physical, psychological, emotional, social, and financial burden for the child and his family. Practitioners may find themselves in a situation of failure with depletion of medical resources. Some types of chronic pain are refractory to conventional systemic treatment and may require the use of regional anesthesia. Cancer pain is common in children and its medical management is sometimes insufficient. It is accessible to neuroaxial or peripheral techniques of regional anesthesia if it is limited to an area accessible to one of these techniques and no contraindications (e. g., thrombopenia) are present. Complex regional pain syndrome 1 is not rare in children and adolescents, but it often goes undiagnosed. Regional anesthesia may contribute to the treatment of complex regional pain syndrome 1, mainly in case of recurrence, because it provides rapid effective analgesia and allows rapid implementation of intensive physiotherapy. These techniques have also <b>shown</b> interest <b>in</b> <b>phantom</b> limb pain after limb amputation, but they remain controversial for erythromelalgia pain or chronic abdominopelvic pain. Finally, the treatment of postdural puncture headache due to cerebrospinal fluid leak can be treated by performing an epidural injection of the patient’s blood, called a blood-patch. Finally, the management of children with chronic pain should be multidisciplinary (pediatrician, physiotherapist, psychologist, surgeon, anesthesiologist) to support the child and her problem in its entirety. 2013 Published by Elsevier Masson SAS...|$|R

These relatively fast changes (in seconds) in water tissue content are difficult to explain in physiological terms.
