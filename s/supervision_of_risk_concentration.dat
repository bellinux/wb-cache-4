Consequently, measurement <b>of</b> <b>concentration</b> <b>risk</b> needs to take into account borrowers’ heterogeneity. One way to proceed is to extend the standard asymptotic single factor framework by introducing additional factors <b>of</b> systematic <b>risk</b> varying between groups of borrowers. Using a generalized linear mixed model, the paper extends the standard one factor credit risk model to the multi-factor framework taking into account industry effects. The paper uses a large database containing ratings history of more than 600. 000 French SME over the 1999 - 2008 period.

40|$|Risk {{and loss}} are common words {{that need to}} be clearly defined when embarking on the task <b>of</b> {{assessing}} operational <b>risks.</b> Financial institutions may rush into implementing the methodologies proposed by Basel in the hope <b>of</b> achieving better <b>risk</b> management – or simply to satisfy a regulatory request – but without giving enough thoughts to this enterprise. We show that the methodologies proposed by Basel to assess risks and calculate capital requirements are indeed poorly defined and, as far as they can be understood, misconceived. When restricting our attention to operational risks we find that their impact {{in the vast majority of}} cases is negligible compared to other risks, be they credit, market or general business risks. A few truly exceptional operational <b>risks</b> may, <b>of</b> course, lead to catastrophic consequences, but then the answer is not in an extra capital buffer that would have to be enormous to be of any use. An attempt to aggregate purely operational risks, as proposed by Basel in the so-called Advanced Measurement Approaches, is as futile as it is difficult. What matters in risk management is balancing all risks, whatever they are, against costs and revenues. And risks do not add up; it is the interaction between operational risks and other risks and the risk/reward trade-off that is of interest. Basel recognises this broader aspect <b>of</b> operational <b>risk</b> management in its guidance notes for the development <b>of</b> an operational <b>risk</b> management framework and the <b>supervision</b> <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> management.

First, in the sphere <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> identification and assessment, the main tasks will be assessing network effects, enhancing stress tests, expanding the supervisory scope to include nonbank financial intermediaries and distilling the findings from various analytical strands into an overall perspective on systemic risks. Second, although some systemic elements have been embedded in the “Basel III” framework, experience in implementing macroprudential policies is scarce and implementation is highly dependent on national circumstances, i. e. legal mandates and feasibility as well as authorities’ readiness to act. Third, in addition to the newly established European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB), some European (as well as non-European) countries have made considerable progress in establishing national systemic risk boards with extended legal rights and responsibilities for macroprudential {{regulation and}} supervision.
