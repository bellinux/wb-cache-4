40|$|We have {{different}} kinds of signal processing everywhere around us in our everyday life, in our cellphones, when we are listening to music, watching TV etc. This makes signal processing a very interesting and important technical area, where the demand of skilled engineers sets the limit of what is possible. Working with signal processing requires in-depth knowledge {{in areas such as}} mathematics, physics, electronics, and other related areas. For this, it has traditionally been demanded by a talented developer to also master the advanced programming languages such as C / C + + and Assembler. This has begun to change; today there are several companies that offer graphical development environments for signal processing, environments where programming skills are not needed anymore, and the focus can be on signal processing instead. The goal with this project is to build a corresponding graphical development environment to reach an understanding of what is required of these systems, and also to grasp what opportunities that are available within graphic programming. Inspiration for the work has partly arise from some of the tools available on the market, and partly from previous theses that have been written about graphic programming. The challenge lies in creating a program that can execute signal diagrams in real time from given signal blocks, and be able to handle feedback loops in an efficient way and to do so at the lowest "cost" in terms of clock cycles as possible. This should also be compared against to code, compile and run a complete <b>signal</b> <b>diagram</b> directly. To increase the usability it should also be possibility to externally manage in real time the parameters of the <b>signal</b> <b>diagram</b> during execution. The interface is a separate program, which is to some extent similar to Matlab Simulink, where a <b>signal</b> <b>diagram</b> is drawn up graphically by connecting wires between different signal blocks. This signal scheme is then executed in an additional program that serves as a runtime environment. In this report, the term "signal engine" is used for this program. Signal engine is equivalent to the program that should have been run directly into a standalone DSP (Digital Signal Processor) if a more classic design had been selected, but now runs as a separate process in Windows...|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} a novel modus operandi {{to survey the}} ocean floor. We utilize the eruption of submarine volcanoes as a light source. The electromagnetic radiation emitted by such eruptions illuminate the ocean floor and thus provides information about the barythmetric topology, and a geostationary satellite can monitor this. Since the wavelength of the electromagnetic radiation is many orders of magnitude shorter {{than that of the}} acoustic wave, finer details of the bathymetric features can be obtained. We show that a topographical representation of the seabed can be derived from the <b>Signal</b> <b>Diagram</b> by a simple transformation (a mirror reflection). In this case the radiation is emitted by water molecules stimulated by the heat of the volcanic eruption, in contradistinction to the case of tsunami radiation, where the water molecules are stimulated by mutual collisions at high speed. We give two examples: Illapel, Chile and Chichi-shima, Japan. We have also shown that water molecules in the ocean, when stimulated by the heat of submarine volcanic eruption, will emit infrared radiatio...|$|E

40|$|We study {{interference}} {{effects in the}} production channel ZZ + jet, in particular focusing {{on the role of}} the Higgs boson. This production channel receives contributions both from Higgs boson-mediated diagrams via the decay H → ZZ (<b>signal</b> <b>diagrams),</b> as well as from diagrams where the Z-bosons couple directly to a quark loop (background diagrams). We consider the partonic processes gggZZ and gq q̅ ZZ in which interference between <b>signal</b> and background <b>diagrams</b> first occurs. Since interference is primarily an off-resonant effect for the Higgs boson, we treat the Z-bosons as on-shell. Thus our analysis is limited to the region above threshold, where the invariant mass of the Z-pair, m_ZZ, satisfies the condition m_ZZ> 2 m_Z. In the region m_ZZ > 300 GeV we find that the interference in the ZZ + jet channel is qualitatively similar to interference in the inclusive ZZ channel. Moreover, the rates are sufficient to study these effects at the LHC once jet-binned data become available. Comment: 18 pages, 6 figure...|$|R

From this block diagram the mathematical model of eye movement was developed.

An electrical circuit of the model was developed and output was checked. Finally, the condition of the stability of the model and the steady state error were determined both from the simulation and practically developed circuit. The model can describe the normal operation of the eye and can also describe the eye diseases like hypermetropia and myopia.

Taking into account decays of the top quarks and the light Higgs boson leads to reactions with 8 fermions in the final state which, in the framework of the standard model, receive contributions typically from many thousands Feynman diagrams. An overwhelming majority of the diagrams comprises the off resonance background to the resonant signal of associated production and decay of the top quark pair and Higgs boson. We address the signal and background issue by comparing cross sections calculated with the <b>signal</b> <b>diagrams</b> only and with the complete sets of the diagrams.

40|$|In my {{graduation}} thesis I {{first of}} all shortly mentioned frequency–selection filters and their utilisations. However, the base point of this project was to acquaint with different types of <b>signal</b> flow <b>diagrams</b> with whom I should design and analyse frequency-selection filtres with conventional and also innovative active components. As the first I created <b>signal</b> flow <b>diagrams</b> for both voltage and current conveyors. These modern active components are well known today and enable the construction of circuits with better properties than circuits with traditional differentiating amplifiers with voltage feedback. Thereinafter I made <b>signal</b> flow <b>diagrams</b> for OTA component. Transconductancal amplifiers are well known active components used in various areas of analog signal processing. OTA amplifier {{is in fact the}} current source controlled by voltage difference, which is characterised by gm transconductance. Ulterior components were IOZ and IZN models of voltage amplifier with voltage gain A. The last component was COA amplifier. It is a current operational amplifier. COA model is fully dual component to VOA, which is classical voltage amplifier. In my project I used filters with two OTA components. This filter offers functions like low-pass filter, band-pass filter, high-pass filter, band-stop filter and two-phase network. Following this I used circuits with two GCC conveyors. These offer band-pass filter, low-pass filter, high-pass filter, band-stop filter and two-phase network. Ultimately I designed filters with COA components, which offer three transmission functions simultaneously (DP, PP and HP). Analysis of these filters was made with a help of PSpice computer programme...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} electroweak {{production}} {{of all possible}} four-fermion states in $e^+e^-$ collisions with non-standard triple gauge boson couplings. All $CP$ conserving couplings are considered. It {{is an extension of}} the methods and strategy, which were recently used for the Standard Model electroweak production of four-fermion final states. Since the fermions are taken to be massless the matrix elements can be evaluated efficiently, but certain phase space cuts have to be imposed to avoid singularities. Experimental cuts are of a similar nature. With the help of the constructed event generator a number of illustrative results is obtained for $W$-pair production. These show on one hand the distortions of the Standard Model angular distributions caused by either off-shell effects or initial state radiation. On the other hand, also the modifications of distributions due to anomalous couplings are presented, considering either <b>signal</b> <b>diagrams</b> or all diagrams.
