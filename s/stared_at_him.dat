5|$|Aciu Widjaja, now President-Director of Air Asia, {{described}} Chrisye as {{a simple}} man and said that one time, when he, Chrisye, and several others had gone overseas Chrisye {{was the only one}} who did not look for brand-name clothing or world-class restaurants; instead he ate at a food court and bought what he felt was comfortable. In his biography, Chrisye noted that he enjoyed eating at roadside foodstalls well after his marriage and would be perplexed when people <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> Guruh recalled that Chrisye would sleep anywhere during extended planning sessions, including under the piano.|$|E
5|$|Merrick was {{becoming}} a greater financial burden on his family and eventually, his father secured him a hawker's licence which enabled him to earn money selling items from the haberdashery shop, door to door. This endeavour was unsuccessful, since Merrick's facial deformities rendered his speech increasingly unintelligible and prospective customers reacted with horror to his physical appearance. Housewives refused to open doors for him and now people not only <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> but began to follow him out of curiosity. Merrick failed to make enough money as a hawker to support himself. On returning home one day in 1877, he was severely beaten by his father and he left home for good.|$|E
500|$|Quintanilla, Jr. held {{a meeting}} on March 9, 1995, with Selena and Suzette Quintanilla at Q-Productions to confront Saldívar. Quintanilla, Jr. {{presented}} Saldívar with evidence concerning the missing funds. He said Saldívar simply <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> without answering any of his questions. Quintanilla, Jr. told Saldívar he would involve police {{if she did not}} produce evidence that disproved his accusations. When Quintanilla, Jr. asked her why fans were not receiving the promised gift packages, Saldívar said those fans were trying to get the items for free. Quintanilla, Jr. discovered Saldívar had opened the fan club's bank account under her sister's name, [...] "Maria Elida". When asked why she had done this, she replied that the bank would not allow her to open an account in her name; she did not know the reason for this refusal. Saldívar abruptly left the meeting. Quintanilla, Jr. then banned Saldívar from contacting Selena. However, Selena did not want to end their friendship; she felt Saldívar was essential to the success of her clothing line in Mexico. Selena also wanted to keep Saldívar close because she had bank records, statements, and financial records necessary for tax purposes.|$|E

500|$|The A.V. Club Todd VanDerWerff {{gave it a}} [...] "B", {{and wrote}} that he [...] "finally got a sense that, yes, this second season has been {{building}} toward something and {{has been trying to}} tell an emotional story, as well as a humorous one. 'Born This Way', {{for the first time in}} a long time, made me feel like I could say I was a fan of Glee without a million qualifiers." [...] Gary Mills of the Florida Times-Union felt that the episode didn't live up to its hype, but also said that he wasn't disappointed. Brett Berk of Vanity Fair reacted positively, and noted that by [...] "focusing on what makes these lovable dorks, well, lovable dorks—and not pop, or high-school, superstars—tonight's episode, if a bit tidily, reminded us that these are supposed to be kids". Matt Zoller Seitz of Salon thought that [...] "Born This Way" [...] was [...] "the show's best episode to date", and [...] "an epic about a hero returning from a long journey, walking serenely through halls that once scared him, and performing with such skill and sincerity that his friends <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> with love and awe." [...] Aly Semigran of MTV had mixed emotions. She criticized the abrupt changes of the storylines in the episode, and thought that the episode [...] "was a noble effort" [...] but [...] "it didn't quite work the way it was supposed to." [...] Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal stated that the episode [...] "sounded just the perfect notes" [...] and called it [...] "the best episode yet". He continued: [...] "The night held wonderful gems: A clear message. Witty repartee (…). Great character build up. And tailored songs that carried emotional heft." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bikel's close {{friendship}} with Seeger was sometimes tested {{as a result}} of the festival's choice of performers. On one occasion, Seeger became infuriated and wished he had an ax to cut the electrical cables because of the poor audio during Bob Dylan's legendary performance accompanied by the Paul Butterfield Blues Band. Seeger expected Bikel to support him: [...] "Theo, for Chrissake—tell them. Set them straight!" [...] Bikel stepped forward and told Seeger, [...] "Peter, this band, these rebels—they are us. They are what we were twenty years ago. Remember?" [...] Seeger <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> [...] "like a trauma victim", as Bikel succeeded in calming Seeger down enough to let the group finish their songs. In 1965, Bikel, as well as Seeger, was shocked when Bob Dylan turned electric at the Festival, an event some call [...] "Dylan's declaration of musical independence." ...|$|E
2500|$|A Hamas spokesman, said {{allegations}} that militants {{had used the}} school to attack Israeli forces were baseless. Abdel Minaim Hasan who lost his eldest daughter, Lina, 11, wept by her body wrapped in a Hamas flag. The New York Times reported that he cried out: [...] "From now on I am Hamas! ... I choose resistance!" [...] He also cursed the Arab nation, shouting, [...] "The Arabs are doing nothing to protect us!" [...] Huda Deed who lost nine members of her extended family, ages 3 to 25, was also weeping and standing before {{the bodies of the}} dead remarked, [...] "Look, they’ve lined them up like a ruler!" [...] When asked for an interview by Al-Aqsa TV, the Hamas channel, she refused. Mushir al-Masri, a senior Hamas official who emerged from hiding to attend the funeral, commended the dead and called them martyrs. According to the New York Times, some parents greeted him by shaking his hand while others <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> coldly.|$|E

2500|$|After {{four years}} Wingate left Charterhouse and in 1921 he was {{accepted}} at the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich, the Royal Artillery's officers' training school. For committing a minor offence against the rules, a first-year student would {{be subjected to}} a ragging ritual named [...] "running". [...] This ritual consisted of the first-year being stripped and forced to run a gauntlet of senior students, all of whom wielded a knotted towel which was used to hit the accused on his journey along the line. On reaching the end, the first-year would then be thrown into an icy-cold cistern of water. When {{it came time for}} Wingate to run the gauntlet, for allegedly having returned a horse to the stables too late, he walked up to the senior student {{at the head of the}} gauntlet, <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> and dared him to strike. [...] The senior refused. Wingate moved to the next senior and did the same; he too refused. In turn, each senior declined to strike; coming to the end of the line, Wingate walked to the cistern and dived straight into the icy-cold water.|$|E
2500|$|To the {{astonished}} Masha, {{he explains}} that, {{in the winter}} of 1812, he was trying to rejoin his regiment, when a terrible blizzard came on. [...] Riding in a troika with a guide, they became lost in unfamiliar country. [...] Seeing a light in the distance, they drove toward it and found themselves at a village church where people were crying out [...] "This way!" [...] When he stopped at the church, he was told that the bride had fainted and that the priest {{did not know what to}} do. [...] When they saw the young soldier, they asked him if he was ready to proceed. [...] Burmin, the young rake, noticed the attractiveness of the bride and decided to play a prank by going through with the ceremony. [...] The church was dark, lit only by a few candles, and everyone in it was little more than a shadow. [...] When, at the end, he was told to kiss his bride, she realized that it was not her intended and fainted dead away. [...] As the witnesses <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> in horror, he raced out and drove off.|$|E
2500|$|Grandi followed, {{speaking}} for {{one and a}} half hours. He read out and explained his document, concluding his speech with Mussolini's citation of 1924 [...] "Let perish all the factions, so that the Nation can live". After Grandi spoke Farinacci, who explained that his criticism ran opposite to Grandi's: in fact, while Grandi contended that Mussolini had betrayed the constitution, the real victim of betrayal was Fascism. Farinacci continued saying that in order to win the war it was necessary to wipe out the democrats and liberals still nested in the Party, as well as the generals; to give back to the King the supreme command of the armed forces; to unify the war direction with the Germans; to strengthen the Party. At the end of his speech he read his proposed OdG, which summarized all these points. After some minor interventions spoke Bottai, the Fascist intellectual, who made a purely political speech, defending the OdG. Then came Ciano, who spoke boldly, summarizing the history of the alliance with the Germans, and declaring that the Italians were not the traitors, but the betrayed. At 23:30 Galbiati, the chief of the MVSN (the Fascist militia) winked at Scorza, who whispered something to Mussolini. The Duce announced that, due to the length of the meeting, some comrades had asked for a postponement to the next day. At this point, Grandi jumped from his chair crying that none could go out before they had voted on his OdG, and that it was shameful to go to sleep when Italian soldiers were dying for their fatherland. Mussolini <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> but unwillingly agreed. Never before in the 20-years long history of the assembly had anyone dared to ask for a vote: since fascism was strongly anti-parliamentary, in all previous meetings only discussions summarized by the Duce had taken place. At midnight the meeting was suspended for 10 minutes: while the others drank lemonade and coffee substitutes, Mussolini, who suffered from an ulcer, drank a cup of milk. In the meantime, Grandi collected the signatures to his OdG.|$|E

2500|$|One of the {{passengers}} of the bus approached Treviño Morales weeping and saying: [...] "Please, sir. I {{do not want to}} do this. I will give you all the money I have and my own house, but please let us go." [...] Treviño Morales <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> firmly, took away his club and then said, [...] "Okay, stupid asshole. Leave," [...] and while the crying man was walking away, Treviño Morales swung his bat and hit him {{in the back of the}} head—and then struck him more than 20 times until his head was completely destroyed. He then turned around and said to the kidnapped victims: [...] "This is what you have to do. Have some balls (courage). Anyone who does not want to can tell me and I will beat the hell out of you." [...] All of the men started fighting. Several other Zeta members, who were still on a bus with other passengers, ordered the women whom they considered the most beautiful to descend the vehicle so they could rape them. Then they took away the children from their mothers, and shot the rest of the bus passengers. The women were taken to a warehouse where many other women were held captive. Inside a dark room, the women were reportedly raped and beaten, while one heard the screams of the women and of the children being put in acid. A driver of one of the buses was then asked to turn on the bus engine, and then ordered to move the bus to where the kidnapped victims were handcuffed and laid down on the dirt floor. [...] "Drive on top of them," [...] one of the killers told the bus driver, who stood there motionless. [...] "Drive on top of them or I will put you there too, asshole," [...] the killer repeated. As the driver rode over his passengers with the bus, he felt like the vehicle was passing over speed bumps, but the only difference was that the bus driver and {{the passengers}} could actually hear the cries of the people as they were being run over. The gunmen, once the driver was finished, shot him in the head and shot the rest on board. The bus was then set on fire by the Zetas. Treviño Morales then gathered all the Zetas and said, [...] "We have had enough fun for tonight. Bring the winners." [...] His men brought all of those who had passed the gladiator-like competitions, and they were gathered in front of Treviño Morales.|$|E
