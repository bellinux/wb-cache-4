5|$|A third {{story is}} set in San Diego, where an {{undercover}} DEA investigation led by Montel Gordon (Cheadle) and Ray Castro (Guzmán) leads {{to the arrest of}} Eduardo Ruiz (Ferrer), a high-stakes dealer posing as a fisherman. Ruiz decides to take the dangerous road to immunity by giving up his boss: drug lord Carl Ayala (Bauer), the biggest distributor for the Obregón brothers in the United States. Ayala is indicted by a tough prosecutor, hand-selected by Robert Wakefield to <b>send</b> <b>a</b> <b>message</b> <b>to</b> the Mexican drug organizations.|$|E

5|$|Brown did {{not attend}} the opening {{ceremony}} of the 2008 Summer Olympics on 8 August 2008 in Beijing, and instead attended the closing ceremony on 24 August 2008. Brown had been under intense pressure from human rights campaigners to <b>send</b> <b>a</b> <b>message</b> <b>to</b> China, concerning the 2008 Tibetan unrest. His decision not to attend the opening ceremony was not an act of protest; the decision was made several weeks in advance of the Games.|$|E
5|$|The Internet is a {{worldwide}} network {{of computers and}} computer networks that {{communicate with each other}} using the Internet Protocol. Any computer on the Internet has a unique IP address that can be used by other computers to route information to it. Hence, any computer on the Internet can <b>send</b> <b>a</b> <b>message</b> <b>to</b> any other computer using its IP address. These messages carry with them the originating computer's IP address allowing for two-way communication. The Internet is thus an exchange of messages between computers.|$|E
5|$|Another {{reason is}} the {{protection}} of star players. Fighting within the game can also <b>send</b> <b>a</b> <b>message</b> <b>to</b> players and coaches from other teams that cheap shots, dirty plays, and targeting specific players {{will not be tolerated}} and there will be consequences involved. Fighting can provide retribution for a team's player getting targeted or injured. Overall, fighting is known to be a beneficial policing that the game needs to keep players in line. Over the history of hockey, many enforcers have been signed simply to protect players like Gretzky, who was protected by Dave Semenko, Marty McSorley, and others, and Brett Hull, who was protected by Kelly Chase and others. Many believe that without players protecting each other, referees would affect the game play by having to call more penalties, and the league would have to suspend players for longer periods.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} August, all of Bonanza Creek {{had been}} claimed by miners. A {{prospector}} then advanced up {{into one of the}} creeks feeding into Bonanza, later to be named Eldorado Creek. He discovered new sources of gold there, which would prove to be even richer than those on Bonanza. Claims began to be sold between miners and speculators for considerable sums. Just before Christmas, word of the gold reached Circle City. Despite the winter, many prospectors immediately left for the Yukon by dog-sled, eager to reach the region before the best claims were taken. The outside world was still largely unaware of the news and although Canadian officials had managed to <b>send</b> <b>a</b> <b>message</b> <b>to</b> their superiors in Ottawa about the finds and influx of prospectors, the government did not give it much attention. The winter prevented river traffic, and it was not until June 1897 that the first boats left the area, carrying the freshly mined gold and the full story of the discoveries.|$|E
5|$|During {{the court}} case, Huseby {{stated that he}} wanted help from society and {{attention}} drawn to his cause. However, he stated that he regretted doing this by hijacking. He stated that {{all he wanted was}} to <b>send</b> <b>a</b> <b>message</b> <b>to</b> the minister of justice and prime minister that he needed help, and that he did not intend that the other passengers be aware of his threats. Huseby stated that the hijacking was spontaneous and that he planned to make an armed robbery or take hostages at the Radisson SAS hotel in Oslo. His defence lawyer argued that Huseby did not commit a hijacking in the letter of the law, but had instead taken hostages, which would result in a lesser sentence. The court psychologists stated that Huseby had a difficult childhood, and had been defined as an alcoholic at the age of 17. They considered him to have very underdeveloped ability to make rational decisions and weak mental health. They also stated that he committed crimes to identify himself due to his low self-esteem. On 29 May 1986, Huseby was found guilty of hijacking in Eidsivating Court of Appeal. He was sentenced to three years prison and five years of preventive supervision.|$|E

25|$|Opposition {{politics}} {{found their}} way into film, too, with statesman Pridi Phanomyong producing King of the White Elephant, in 1940. With all the dialogue in English, Pridi hoped to <b>send</b> <b>a</b> <b>message</b> <b>to</b> the outside world that he was unhappy with the militaristic direction his country was taking.

25|$|On the {{outskirts}} of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León on 13 May 2012, authorities discovered 49 decapitated bodies dumped on a highway.

Morales however, had ordered the henchmen and the local boss of the Zeta cell to toss the bodies in the town's square and not outside the city limits, which supports the hypothesis that members in Los Zetas were disobeying their superiors.|$|E

25|$|In many animals, {{aggression}} can {{be linked}} to pheromones released between conspecifics. In mice, major urinary proteins (Mups) have been demonstrated to promote innate aggressive behavior in males, and can be mediated by neuromodulatory systems. Mups activate olfactory sensory neurons in the vomeronasal organ (VNO), a subsystem of the nose known to detect pheromones via specific sensory receptors, of mice and rats. Pheremones have also been identified in fruit flies, detected by neurons in the antenna, that <b>send</b> <b>a</b> <b>message</b> <b>to</b> the brain eliciting aggression; it has been noted that aggression pheremones have not been identified in humans.|$|E
