5000|$|Accuracy is {{increased}} by spinning the projectile. This is achieved for a bullet by being forced against spiral rifling grooves in the barrel.

40|$|Lignin/lignin blends {{were used}} to improve fiber <b>spinning,</b> <b>stabilization</b> rates, and {{properties}} of lignin-based carbon fibers. Organosolv lignin from Alamo switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) and yellow poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera) were used as blends for making lignin-based carbon fibers. Different ratios of yellow poplar:switchgrass lignin blends were prepared (50 : 50, 75 : 25, and 85 : 15 w/w). Chemical composition and thermal properties of lignin samples were determined. Thermal properties of lignins were analyzed using thermogravimetric analysis and differential scanning calorimetry. Thermal analysis confirmed switchgrass and yellow poplar lignin form miscible blends, as a single glass transition was observed. Lignin fibers were produced via melt-spinning by twin-screw extrusion. Lignin fibers were thermostabilized at different rates and subsequently carbonized. Spinnability of switchgrass lignin markedly improved by blending with yellow poplar lignin. On the other hand, switchgrass lignin significantly improved thermostabilization performance of yellow poplar fibers, preventing fusion of fibers during fast stabilization and improving mechanical properties of fibers. These results suggest a route towards a 100 % renewable carbon fiber with significant decrease in production time and improved mechanical performance...|$|R

5000|$|The entire {{space vehicle}} {{itself can be}} spun up to {{stabilize}} the orientation of a single vehicle axis. This method is widely used to stabilize {{the final stage of}} a launch vehicle. The entire spacecraft and an attached solid rocket motor are spun up about the rocket's thrust axis, on a [...] "spin table" [...] oriented by the attitude control system of the lower stage on which the spin table is mounted. When final orbit is achieved, the satellite may be de-spun by various means, or left spinning. <b>Spin</b> <b>stabilization</b> of satellites is only applicable to those missions with a primary axis of orientation that need not change dramatically over the lifetime of the satellite and no need for extremely high precision pointing. It is also useful for missions with instruments that must scan the star field or Earth's surface or atmosphere. See spin-stabilized satellite.|$|E
50|$|There are {{advantages}} and disadvantages to both <b>spin</b> <b>stabilization</b> and three-axis stabilization. Spin-stabilized craft provide a continuous sweeping motion that is desirable for fields and particles instruments, {{as well as some}} optical scanning instruments, but they may require complicated systems to de-spin antennas or optical instruments that must be pointed at targets for science observations or communications with Earth. Three-axis controlled craft can point optical instruments and antennas without having to de-spin them, but they may have to carry out special rotating maneuvers to best utilize their fields and particle instruments. If thrusters are used for routine stabilization, optical observations such as imaging must be designed knowing that the spacecraft is always slowly rocking back and forth, and not always exactly predictably. Reaction wheels provide a much steadier spacecraft from which to make observations, but they add mass to the spacecraft, they have a limited mechanical lifetime, and they require frequent momentum desaturation maneuvers, which can perturb navigation solutions because of accelerations imparted by the use of thrusters.|$|E

40|$|Carbon fibers {{contain more}} than 90 wt. % carbon. They have low density, high {{specific}} strength and modulus, and good temperature and chemical resistance. Therefore, {{they are important}} candidate as reinforcement materials. Carbon fiber is made by pyrolysing precursor polymers. Polyacrylonitrile (PAN) which {{has been used as}} precursor to produce high strength carbon fiber is used as precursor in this study. The theoretical tensile strength of carbon fibers can reach over 100 GPa. Currently, the best commercial carbon fibers reach only 7. 5 GPa. To make good quality carbon fiber and to narrow the gap between theoretical values and currently achieved experimental properties, the entire manufacturing process including fiber <b>spinning,</b> <b>stabilization</b> and carbonization, needs to be improved optimized. In this dissertation, the stabilization processes of gel-spun PAN/carbon nanotubes (CNTs) composite fibers are studied. PAN/CNT (1 wt. % CNT) composite fibers are spun by dry-jet gel-spinning. Three types of CNTs with different number of walls and varying catalyst content are used as additives. The effect of different types of CNTs on the properties of the stabilized fibers was compared. It is found that the CNTs with the highest surface area shows the best reinforcement efficiency on the tensile modulus, and reduces the formation of β-amino nitrile. The residual catalyst in the range of 1 to 4 wt. % shows little effect on the mechanical properties of the stabilized fibers. Stabilization involves complex chemical reactions, including cyclization, oxidation, dehydration, and cross-linking. These complex reactions are separated by using different gas environments during stabilization. The cross-linking reaction has the highest activation energy among all stabilization reactions, and requires a temperature higher than 300 DegC to be completed. The effect of applied tension on the stabilized fiber properties are investigated, and it is found that higher tension leads to better properties for the stabilized fiber, including higher Young's modulus, higher orientation, less formation of β-amino nitrile, and less shrinkage. The relationship between stabilization conditions and the mechanical properties of the carbonized fiber is investigated, and the methods to identify optimum stabilization conditions are proposed. It is observed that the highest tension should be applied during both stabilization and carbonization, and the mechanical properties of the resulting carbon fibers are increased if fibers are further stabilized at a temperature of ~ 320 DegC to improve the cross-linking degree as compared with the fibers only stabilized at 255 DegC. The optimum stabilization time depends on both the stabilization temperature and on the applied tension. A new characterization method by monitoring the dynamic mechanical properties, while stabilization is in progress is used to narrow down the range of the optimum stabilization time. Also, the effect of carbonization temperature on the ultimate carbon fiber properties is studied in the batch process carbonization. Preliminary studies are carried out to find the relationship between the structure and properties of precursor fibers and the tensile strength of carbon fibers, including mechanical properties and co-monomers of precursor fibers.

5000|$|The {{original}} designer Robert Mainhardt {{enlisted the}} help of his friend Nick Minchakievich of Pleasanton, California, before 1962, in helping to stabilize the projectiles or ammunition. Minchakievich first developed retractable fins after rear ignition proved too dangerous. But the retractable fins proved too expensive, requiring advanced machining during production. The two experimental calibers with retractable fins were 6mm and 13mm. (Livermore Labs, p. 42.) Rushed for a solution due to the possibility of large government contracts, Minchakievich then quickly and ingeniously invented diagonal vented ports to make the projectiles or ammunition spin while advancing, thus relatively stabilize the projectiles using centrifugal force. This method was used in all the Mainhardt calibers for the Gyrojet. Minchakievich warned Mainhardt that rushing the project would only make the pistol shoddy and unreliable. Working for free out of his Livermore Aerospace Plastics Lab, Minchakievich requested six more months to perfect an accurate projectile, and make the Gyrojet more famous than the Colt Peacemaker. Mainhardt and the Air Force declined as current ordnance and technology was in demand for Vietnam. Minchakievich even attempted a marketing strategy by enlisting the help of Gene Roddenberry in using the pistol on Star Trek. Although Roddenberry loved the Gyrojet, he wanted a [...] "ray gun" [...] and not a pistol that merely shot a rocket projectile, no matter how advanced for the twentieth century.

40|$|My M. Phil {{program is}} {{mainly on the}} studies of organic {{reactions}} using computational methods. The subjects include the substituent effects on the bond dissociation energy and the mechanism and stereochemical control of Cu(I) -catalyzed cyclopropanation. The origin of the substituent effect on the bond dissociation energy (BDE) of Si-H is first introduced in Chapter I. The calculated BDEs agree with experimental measurements and previous ab initio calculation. The calculated substituent effect is well correlated with the calculated Hirshfeld charge and spin density variations on the Si radical center. The {{results show that the}} substituent effect is mainly caused by the spin delocalization and inductive effect. In Chapter II, density functional studies of a series of 13 substituted silanes on the bond dissociation energies of para-substituted toluenes and a series of 33 substituted methanes are reported. Both local density functional and non-local density functional methods quite accurately calculate the substituent effect on the bond dissociation energy (BDE). Almost every substituent can cause a reduction in the C-H BDE in toluene and methane. This is mainly due to a dominant <b>spin</b> delocalization <b>stabilization</b> on the radical by the substituent. Once again, electron-withdrawing inductive effect increases the C-H BDE, and electron-donating inductive effect decreases the C-H BDE. In the case of substituted methanes, a steric effect also reduces the C-H BDE. It is demonstrated that the substituent effect on the bond dissociation energy can be correlated well with calculated variations in physical properties. In Chapter III, the catalytic cyclopropanation by using Copper (I) catalyst is studied. Quantum mechanics calculations on the reactions of ethylene with [(NH 3) [2 Cu(I) =CHR]+ (R=H, COOCH 3) and [(NH=CH-CH 2 -CH=NH) Cu(I) =CH 2 + reveal that a Cu(I) -carbenoid favors a perpendicular structure. The most favorable transition structure is derived from alkene addition to the perpendicular structure. The transition structure is in a triangular structure with the inner C [...] -C bond formed to a larger extent. This transition structure leads directly to the formation of cyclopropane product without the formation of a metallocyclobutane intermediate. A molecular mechanics force-field has been developed based on the quantum mechanics transition structures. The stereoselectivities observed experimentally can be reproduced by the force-field calculations...|$|R
40|$|Numerical {{simulations}} {{are often}} resorted to, {{in order to}} understand the attitude response and control characteristics of a rigid body. However, this approach in performing sensitivity and/or error analyses may be prohibitively expensive and time consuming, especially when a large number of problem parameters are involved. Thus, there is an important role for analytical models in obtaining an understanding of the complex dynamical behavior. In this dissertation, new analytic solutions are derived for the complete attitude motion of spinning rigid bodies, under minimal assumptions. Hence, we obtain the most general solutions reported in the literature so far. Specifically, large external torques and large asymmetries are included in the problem statement. Moreover, problems involving large angular excursions are treated in detail. A new tractable formulation of the kinematics is introduced which proves to be extremely helpful in the search for analytic solutions of the attitude history of such kinds of problems. The main utility of the new formulation becomes apparent however, when searching for feedback control laws for stabilization and/or reorientation of spinning spacecraft. This is an inherently nonlinear problem, where standard linear control techniques fail. We derive a class of control laws for <b>spin</b> axis <b>stabilization</b> of symmetric spacecraft using only two pairs of gas jet actuators. Practically, this could correspond to a spacecraft operating in failure mode, for example. Theoretically, it is also an important control problem which, because of its difficulty, has received little, if any, attention in the literature. The proposed control laws are especially simple and elegant. A feedback control law that achieves arbitrary reorientation of the spacecraft is also derived, using ideas from invariant manifold theory. The significance of this research is twofold. First, it provides a deeper understanding of the fundamental behavior of rigid bodies subject to body-fixed torques. Assessment of the analytic solutions reveals that they are very accurate; for symmetric bodies the solutions of Euler's equations of motion are, in fact, exact. Second, the results of this research have a fundamental impact on practical scientific and mechanical applications in terms of the analysis and control of all finite-sized rigid bodies ranging from nanomachines to very large bodies, both man made and natural. After all, Euler's equations of motion apply to all physical bodies, barring only the extreme limits of quantum mechanics and relativity...|$|R
40|$|Using the Becke- 3 -LYP functional, we have {{performed}} band structure calculations {{on the high}} temperature superconductor parent compound, La 2 CuO 4. Under the restricted spin formalism (rho(alpha) equal to rho(beta)), the R-B 3 LYP band structure agrees well with the standard LDA band structure. It is metallic with a single Cu x 2 -y 2 /O p(sigma) band crossing the Fermi level. Under the unrestricted spin formalism (rho(alpha) not equal to rho(beta)), the UB 3 LYP band structure has a spin polarized antiferromagnetic solution with a band gap of 2. 0 eV, agreeing well with experiment. This state is 1. 0 eV (per formula unit) lower than that calculated from the R-B 3 LYP. The apparent high energy of the spin restricted state is attributed to an overestimate of on-site Coulomb repulsion which is corrected in the unrestricted <b>spin</b> calculations. The <b>stabilization</b> of the total energy with spin polarization arises primarily from the stabilization of the x 2 -y 2 band, such that {{the character of the}} eigenstates {{at the top of the}} valence band in the antiferromagnetic state becomes a strong mixture of Cu x 2 -y 2 /O p(sigma) and Cu z 2 /O' p(z). Since the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem requires the spin restricted and spin unrestricted calculations give exactly the same ground state energy and total density for the exact functionals, this large disparity in energy reflects the inadequacy of current functionals for describing the cuprates. This calls into question the use of band structures based on current restricted spin density functionals (including LDA) as a basis for single band theories of superconductivity in these materials.
