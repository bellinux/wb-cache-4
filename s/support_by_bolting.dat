Frame support is the only activity which is not mechanized and it has {{an important part in}} the production costs. Therefore the possibility of <b>supporting</b> <b>by</b> <b>bolts</b> and wire mesh has been developed.

40|$|The report {{discusses}} the excavation method in underground bauxite {{exploitation of the}} Bauxite Mine Posušjc, {{as well as the}} experiences in crossing support of drifts and crosscuts till now, where it came in about 6 % cases to the breakage of the frame support and to crossing ceiling caving. On the basis of such biggest caving, the estimate and dimensioning of critical support elements (runner and bar) were performed. The possibility of <b>supporting</b> <b>by</b> <b>bolting</b> and stell plate was also considered. For {{the central part of the}} crosscut the use of bolts was assumed, which are fixed in the up-face. and for the rest of crossing the expansion shell anchors. For the latter, the estimate for anchoring elements was elaborated. Technical, safety and economic advantage of the bolts support is proved when compared with the frame support (the paper is published in Croatian) ...|$|R

30|$|Roadways <b>supported</b> <b>by</b> <b>bolts</b> contain <b>support</b> {{structures}} that are {{built into the}} rock surrounding the roadway, referred to as reinforced rocks in this paper. Using physical model simulation, the paper investigates the bearing characteristics of the reinforced rock under different bolt parameters with incrementally increased load. The experimental {{results show that the}} stress at the measurement point inside the structure varies with the kinetic pressure. The stress increases slowly as the load is initially applied, displays accelerated growth {{in the middle of the}} loading application, and decreases or remains constant in the later stage of the loading application. The change in displacement of the surrounding rock exhibits the following characteristics: a slow increase when the load is first applied, accelerated growth in the middle stage, and violent growth in the later stage. There is a good correlation between the change in the measured stress and the change in the surrounding rock displacement. Increasing the density of the bolt support and the length and diameter of the bolt improves the load-bearing performance of the reinforced rock, including its strength, internal peak stress, and residual stress. Bolting improves the internal structure of the surrounding rocks, and the deterioration of the surrounding rock decreases with the distance between the bolt supports.|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. The large ductile {{deformation}} {{response and}} rupture of thin circular metal plates subjected to central blast loading is investigated using the ABAQUS general purpose finite element code. The finite element code incorporates non-linear geometry and material effects {{as well as}} strain rate sensitivity. A material failure model is also incorporated. The SA. XI axisymmetric sheet elements are used to model the plate. The shell element uses a theory that includes shear deformation effects but degenerates to the Kirchoff classical thin shell theory for thin shell elements. An explicit time integration scheme is considered more suitable than an implicit scheme for the analysis. A uniform mesh with 1000 elements is used in modelling the experiments. The mesh size is chosen to satisfy the conditions for numerical stability in the explicit analysis scheme. Two boundary conditions are considered; a plate clamped to its <b>supports</b> <b>by</b> <b>bolts</b> and a plate fully built-in. The pressure loading from the explosive charge {{is assumed to be}} uniform over the loaded area and decaying exponentially to the plate boundary. The pressure pulse is assumed to be rectangular. Material parameters are obtained from uniaxial quasi-static material tensile test results. The predicted plate responses; mid-plate permanent deflections, permanent deformation shape, strain rate dependence, strain predictions, response time and rupture are compared to experimental data and/or analytical and other numerical solutions. The predicted responses compare reasonably well with measured experimental results and/or with reported analytical and other numerical predictions...|$|R

However, the use of explosives produced large quantities of high-pressure gas which penetrated the surrounding rock and weakened it, {{and it appears that}} too much explosive may have been used. This has led to the surrounding rock fragmenting on a large scale, causing the Second World War tunnels to suffer from fracturing requiring them to be scaled periodically to clear away loose rock. Some of the tunnels have had to be sealed permanently as they are now too unsafe to enter. Others have needed to be <b>supported</b> <b>by</b> rock <b>bolts,</b> weld mesh, props, arches or tunnel linings, and their integrity is monitored by carrying out scanline surveys.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} support {{requirements for}} the proposed monorail system {{to be used in}} decline development. The monorail drilling and loading systems are systems that move on the rail (monorail) installed in the roof of the decline and <b>supported</b> <b>by</b> roof <b>bolts,</b> suspension chains and steel supports. However, due to the weight of the components of the two systems, it is imperative that the force in each roof bolt, suspension chain and steel support capable of suspending the weight of the heaviest component is determined. Numerical models that relate the weight of the monorail drilling and loading components to the required strength in the support system have been developed. Using these developed models, numerical values of the forces in each roof bolt, suspension chain and steel support, required to suspend the weight of the heaviest component of the monorail drilling and loading systems are determined.

30|$|Since {{the time}} bolting was {{determined}} to be an effective method for securing rocks surrounding a roadway, a number of studies examined the performance of rock bolts both in the laboratory and in the field (Aydan 1989; Farmer 1975; Peng and Tang 1984; Stille et al. 1989; Sun 1984; Kang et al. 2015; Zhang et al. 2015). Analytical studies were also conducted to examine the influence of relevant parameters and to understand the interaction between the rock and the bolt (Dight 1982; Indraratna and Kaiser 1990; Holmberg 1991; Li and Stillborg 1999; Bobet 2002; Cai et al. 2004; Carranza-Torres 2009; Bobet and Einstein 2011). And there have been many investigations on bolting mechanisms, ranging from the initial suspension theory to the subsequent composite beam theory, compound arch theory, strength hardening theory and maximum horizontal principal stress theory (Hou and Gou 2000; Mark et al. 2007), and loosing-circle theory of surrounding rocks (Dong et al. 1994). The conclusion that bolting improves the load-bearing capability of the surrounding rock has been stated and confirmed in many studies. For roadways <b>supported</b> <b>by</b> <b>bolts</b> in the rock, different support structures for the surrounding rock have been suggested: e.g., the surrounding rock bearing circle proposed by Kang (1996, 1997), the internal and external bearing circle proposed by Li (2008), the support structure inside the roadway’s coal roof proposed by Zhang and Li (1999), the compound arch bearing structure by Yu et al. (2010), and reinforced rock by Song and Mu (1997), among others (Wu and Chai 1997; Zhu et al. 2000; Zhang et al. 2015; Cheng et al. 2015).However, few studies have investigated the load-bearing characteristics of a structure formed from both bolts and the surrounding rocks and the effect of the structure on the overall load-bearing capacity of the surrounding rocks. There are even fewer studies considering the effect of the bolt parameters on the load-bearing characteristics of such a structure.|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} and numerical {{study has been}} conducted to study the deformation time history behaviour of square aluminium alloy AA 5083 -H 116 plates <b>supported</b> <b>by</b> a <b>bolted</b> frame subjected to low velocity impact. A gas gun projectile launching system was used to strike a 37. mm diameter rigid bar at the centre of 300. mm x 300. mm square aluminium plates of 3. mm, 5. mm and 6. mm thicknesses with velocities {{in the range of}} 5 - 15. m/s. In this study, a finite element model (FEM) of the complete experimental setup has been developed and analysed. A high strain rate test program on aluminium alloys was carried out in order to obtain the material parameters for the Johnson-Cook material model that has been used for the FEM analysis. A modified analytical model has been presented by incorporating the non-linear strain hardening behaviour of the aluminium alloy. Good agreement of the deflection time histories has been found between the analytical predictions, numerical predictions and experimental observations. The modified analytical model predicts the plate's central plastic deformation with reasonable accuracy...|$|R

40|$|AbstractMOIL is {{producing}} annually around 1. 13 million tones of manganese ore. It operates 7 underground and 3 opencast mines {{in the state}} of Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra. The underground mines are operated at shallow to moderate depths. Asia's largest and oldest underground manganese mine is being operated by MOIL at Balaghat, Madhya Pradesh. Horizontal cut and fill mining with passive timber square set support has been replaced with advanced technique of pre-mining <b>support</b> <b>by</b> Cable <b>bolting</b> for reinforcement underground structures. The change in technology has enabled to transform the manual post filling of rock to hydraulic sand stowing operation in all the underground mines of the MOIL. With the available underground stopes, the panel working has been started with phased mechanization. The Side discharge loaders (SDL) has been introduced for mechanical handling of ROM in the stope and Load, haul and dump (LHD) machines for drivage development. These rapid mining operations have imposed the need for change in level interval for higher productivity. Presently below 12 th level, level interval has been changed from exiting 30 m to 45 m at Balaghat Mine. Moreover, Single boomer electro hydrostatic crawler mounted drill jumbo has been introduced for drivage development at Balaghat Mine. The paper describes the phased rock mechanics investigations and its application in the underground mining for mechanized stoping operations at Balaghat mine of MOIL for better safety and productivity...|$|R

The actuator is pivotally connected {{to the end of}} the <b>support</b> arm <b>by</b> a <b>bolt</b> which has an extension allowed to pass through a slot in the fixed mounting bracket. An actuator rod extends from the servo actuator to a crank arm which turns a control shaft. A short linear thrust of the rod pivots the crank arm through about 90 for full-on control with the rod contracted into the servo actuator, and full-off control when the rod is extended from the actuator. A spring moves the servo actuator and actuator rod toward the control crank arm once the actuator rod is fully extended in the full-off position. This assures the turning of the control shaft to a full-off position. A stop bolt and slot are provided to limit pivot motion. Once fully extended, the spring pivots the motion...|$|R
