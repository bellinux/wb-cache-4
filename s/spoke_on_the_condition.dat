50|$|On November 7, 2009, while Hasan was communicative, {{he refused}} to talk to investigators. On November 12 and December 2, respectively, Hasan was charged with 13 counts of premeditated murder and 32 counts of {{attempted}} murder under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, thus making him eligible for the death penalty if convicted. Although authorities did not specify at that time if they would seek the death penalty in the case, a senior military official who <b>spoke</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>condition</b> of anonymity said that Colonel Michael Mulligan would serve as the Army's lead prosecutor. Mulligan served as the lead prosecutor on the Hasan Akbar case, in which a soldier was sentenced to death for the murder of two officers.|$|E

5000|$|One of {{the first}} times Dr. Narramore heard about the Gospel was {{as a young boy}} {{attending}} a country church in his hometown. <b>The</b> minister <b>spoke</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> human <b>condition</b> being one of sin and separation from God without Christ. These words made Narramore deeply uncomfortable. As a result, he avoided eye contact with the minister and hid behind a stove pipe. Years later at age eleven, Clyde was riding his horse by an irrigation ditch thinking about his life. According to his autobiography, Narramore's heart became so heavy that he slid off his horse, bent his knees and began to pray. He confessed his sins and asked Christ to save him.
