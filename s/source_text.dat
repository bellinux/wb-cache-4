5|$|By {{the late}} 1940s Benjamin Britten had {{established}} himself as a leading composer of English opera, with several major works to his credit. In 1947 he suggested to his librettist Eric Crozier that they should create a children's opera, based on a bible story. Crozier gave Britten a copy of Pollard's book, as a possible source of material. Nothing came of this project immediately; instead, Britten and Crozier wrote the cantata Saint Nicolas (1948), the first of several works in which Britten combined skilled performers with amateurs. The cantata involves at least two children's choirs, and incorporates two congregational hymns sung by the audience. Britten also used this fusion of professional with amateur forces in The Little Sweep (1949), which forms the second part of his entertainment for children, Let's Make an Opera, that he devised with Crozier. Again, child singers (also doubling as actors) were used, and the audience sings choruses at appropriate points. In 1952, although Britten's collaboration with Crozier had ended, he used the Chester plays book as the <b>source</b> <b>text</b> for his Canticle II, based on the story of Abraham and Isaac.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} the {{putative}} artifact goes back almost a century. The earliest record goes back to a Chinese doctor named Xue Shenwei, who sometime prior to 1928 was shown {{a photo of a}} rubbing of one of the bones by an antiquities dealer named Zhang Yi'an. Although not able to view the bones at that time, Xue Shenwei later acquired one of them from another antiquities dealer named Wang Dongting in 1935 and then the second via a personal connection named Ke Yanling around 1940. While Xue did not recognize the script on the bones he guessed at its antiquity and buried the bones for safekeeping during the Cultural Revolution. Then, in 1983 Xue presented the bones to the Palace Museum in Beijing where Liu Jiuan and Wang Nanfang of the State Administration of Cultural Heritage undertook their study. These officials identified the script as cuneiform and asked the Assyriologists Chi Yang and Wu Yuhong to work on the inscriptions. Identification of the <b>source</b> <b>text</b> proceeded slowly until 1985, when Wu Yuhong along with Oxford Assyriologist Stephanie Dalley and Oliver Gurney recognized the text in one bone as coming from the Cyrus Cylinder. One year later Wu Yuhong presented his findings at the 33rd Rencontre Assyriologique and published them in a journal article.|$|E

40|$|What is the translator's {{impact on}} the {{information}} structure (IS) of causal expressions? This study proposes a description method for the internal IS of causal expressions with connectors and their translations. We implement Lambrecht's view (1990) that IS relates to interlocutors' 'mental states' and look upon information structuring as a cognitive patterning of linguistic elements {{with varying degrees of}} manifestness. These degrees are hypothesized to be determined by a set of at least five different features, three of which have been investigated in a parallel corpus of Dutch, French and English causal expressions: the presence of a causal connector, clause status and clause position. Primary results indicate that about one fifth of explicit causal constructions in the Dutch <b>source</b> <b>texts</b> have been rendered without their explicit causal connector in the target texts both in French and in English. In addition, the internal clause manifestness in causal sequences turns out to show more differences between the Dutch <b>source</b> <b>texts</b> and the English target texts than between the Dutch <b>source</b> <b>texts</b> and the French target texts, which mirror the Dutch <b>source</b> <b>texts</b> more closely...|$|R

25|$|The translators {{took the}} Bishop's Bible as their <b>source</b> <b>text,</b> {{and where they}} {{departed}} from that in favour of another translation, this was most commonly the Geneva Bible. However, {{the degree to which}} readings from the Bishop's Bible survived into final text of the King James Bible varies greatly from company to company, as did the propensity of the King James translators to coin phrases of their own. John Bois's notes of the General Committee of Review show that they discussed readings derived {{from a wide variety of}} versions and patristic sources; including explicitly both Henry Savile's 1610 edition of the works of John Chrysostom and the Rheims New Testament, which was the primary source for many of the literal alternative readings provided for the marginal notes.|$|E

25|$|The strong {{influence}} of the Aeneid has been identified {{in the development of}} European vernacular literatures—some English works that show its influence being Beowulf, Layamon's Brut (through the <b>source</b> <b>text</b> Historia Regum Britanniae), The Faerie Queene, and Milton's Paradise Lost. The Italian poet Dante Alighieri was himself profoundly influenced by the Aeneid, so much so that his magnum opus The Divine Comedy, itself widely considered central to the western canon, includes a number of quotations from and allusions to the Aeneid and features the author Virgil as a major character – the guide of Dante through the realms of the Inferno and Purgatorio. Another continental work displaying the {{influence of the}} Aeneid is the 16th-century Portuguese epic Os Lusíadas, written by Luís Vaz de Camões and dealing with Vasco de Gama's voyage to India.|$|E
25|$|No Christian tradition, {{other than}} some Syriac ones, has ever adopted a {{harmonized}} Gospel text {{for use in}} its liturgy. However, in many traditions, {{it was not unusual}} for subsequent Christian generations to seek to provide paraphrased Gospel versions in language closer to the vernacular of their own day. Frequently such versions have been constructed as Gospel harmonies, sometimes taking Tatian's Diatessaron as an exemplar; other times proceeding independently. Hence from the Syriac Diatessaron text was derived an 11th-century Arabic harmony (the source for the published versions of the Diatessaron in English); and a 13th-century Persian harmony. The Arabic harmony preserves Tatian's sequence exactly, but uses a <b>source</b> <b>text</b> corrected in most places to that of the standard Syriac Peshitta Gospels; the Persian harmony differs greatly in sequence, but translates a Syriac text that is rather closer to that in Ephrem's commentary.|$|E
25|$|An 'Old Latin' {{version of}} Tatian's Syriac text {{appears to have}} {{circulated}} in the West from the late 2nd century; with a sequence adjusted to conform more closely {{to that of the}} canonical Gospel of Luke; and also including additional canonical text (such as the pericope of the adulteress), as well, possibly, as non-canonical matter from the Gospel of the Hebrews. With the gradual adoption of the Vulgate as the liturgical Gospel text of the Latin Church, the Latin Diatessaron was increasingly modified to conform to Vulgate readings. In 546 Victor of Capua discovered such a mixed manuscript; and, further corrected by Victor so as to provide a very pure Vulgate text within a modified Diatessaron sequence and to restore the two genealogies of Jesus side-by-side, this harmony, the Codex Fuldensis, survives in the monastic library at Fulda, where it served as the <b>source</b> <b>text</b> for vernacular harmonies in Old High German, Eastern Frankish and Old Saxon (the alliterative poem 'Heliand'). The older mixed Vulgate/Diatessaron text type also appears to have continued as a distinct tradition, as such texts appear to underlie surviving 13th–14th century Gospel harmonies in Middle Dutch, Middle High German, Middle French, Middle English, Tuscan and Venetian; although no example of this hypothetical Latin sub-text has ever been identified. The Liège Diatessaron is a particularly poetic example. This Latin Diatessaron textual tradition has also been suggested as underlying the enigmatic 16th century Islam-influenced Gospel of Barnabas (Joosten, 2002).|$|E

40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. This study aims at {{analysing}} three translations of Shakespeare by Can Yücel using Raymond van den Broeck’s method regarding the analytic function of translation. The poetics, the ideology, {{the language and}} the discourse universe of both <b>source</b> and target <b>texts</b> were examined. Can Yücel’s own ideas on translation were also taken into consideration during the analytical process. The target texts by Can Yücel, namely Bahar Noktası (1980), Fırtına (1991) and Hamlet (1992) were compared with the <b>source</b> <b>texts</b> by Shakespeare, entitled A Midsummer Night’s Dream (1595 - 6), The Tempest (1610 - 1611) and Hamlet (1600 - 1601) and were analysed. I reached the conclusion that Can Yücel aimed at translating the <b>source</b> <b>texts</b> without sacrificing their sense and form. I also concluded that Can Yücel did not disregard {{the fact that the}} <b>source</b> <b>texts</b> were originally performance texts and that their function of performability should be taken into account. Can Yücel meant to translate the <b>source</b> <b>texts</b> to the target language in a form which would also be a performance text. The term “loyalty” had a new perspective in this analysing process and I argued that the target texts by Can Yücel were “loyal” both according to Raymond van den Broeck’s method and in the frame of Yücel’s own translation principles.
