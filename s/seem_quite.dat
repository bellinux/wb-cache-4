500|$|Jaher {{opined that}} the book became antiquated as America evolved an {{understanding}} of industrial problems, and found Hay's view of labor superficial. Accordingly, the book had little lasting influence, and is remembered only for its onetime popularity and controversy. According to Dalrymple, [...] "the anti-labor novels fail to hold up particularly well. None is a masterpiece of language, plotting, or characterization. Ideologically all <b>seem</b> <b>quite</b> heavy-handed, choosing to make their points with a nearly complete lack of subtlety." ...|$|E
500|$|A Billboard staff {{reviewer}} {{noted that}} the story [...] "turned out {{to be less than}} pure fiction when the singer later went through personal problems in the very public eye." [...] Jarett Wieselman of the New York Post rated the video a C+ and stated that: [...] "Britney's first Hollywood cautionary tale video didn't <b>seem</b> <b>quite</b> as telling at the time, but with a little distance, the lyrics and concept seem so much sadder". A writer of Rolling Stone said that [...] "Lucky" [...] is best known for [...] "being the first Spears video to focus on what would become a recurring theme: her conflicted relationship to fame".|$|E
500|$|Peter Thompson, {{the head}} of the U.K. Electoral Observation Mission in the country for the election, {{described}} the situation {{on the night of the}} coup as [...] "a very large presence of the military in the streets.

People are staying home. I do know that the army has taken control of the state media and state television, and they haven't released anything official." [...] There was speculation on Senegal's RFM radio by reporter Noah Mankali that Gomes Júnior had been assassinated by the army during the night by soldiers from the same Balanta ethnic group as Ialá Embaló.|$|E

500|$|Gil Kaufman from MTV News {{called the}} video [...] "geektastic". Popjustice also gave the video a {{positive}} review, saying: [...] "The video's {{a riot of}} costume changes, makeovers, multiple 'scenarios' and Christina even seems to look like she's having fun. We'd sort of forgotten the single was even coming out, but the video makes it all <b>seem</b> <b>quite</b> exciting." [...] The Sun commented that [...] "has done the impossible – made the blue rinse sexy". Anna Pickard from The Guardian heavily compared Aguilera to Britney Spears in the video, saying: [...] "We're at a final count of four Christinas to five Britneys. [...] We can't be seen to have achieved a perfect Xtina/Britney balance. [...] We'd probably need a guest appearance from Madonna for that". She also felt that [...] "the 30-second Target advert {{is better than the}} whole video. But still: any release that makes it compulsory to type 'Christina Aguilera Keeps Getting Better' is surely a clever ploy".|$|E
500|$|The {{incident}} {{helped push}} their romance into [...] "top gear". Kate {{went to the}} police station to see Mark and they ended up kissing in front of his colleagues. McGregor called his first on-screen kiss with Brewer [...] "awkward". Mark liked Kate as she was [...] "a pretty easy-going girl who doesn't let too much get to her", but McGregor told TV Week that Mark was wary of starting a relationship with her because of Declan and his commitment to his work. He was also hesitant because of the age gap between them. McGregor told Holy Soap, [...] "Kate's 19 and my character is about 25. It's funny because a few friends of mine have mentioned it, but I think it's because of what they do and where they are in life. At one point Kate's having driving lessons, and I'm working as a detective who's moved up through the ranks quickly, so we do <b>seem</b> <b>quite</b> different in age, but it's better left unsaid I think!" [...] He added that Mark and Kate's relationship [...] "may not be the easiest of rides." ...|$|E
500|$|The second aria, [...] "" [...] ("My all in all, my eternal good"), {{again with}} strings, is a dance-like {{movement}} in free da capo form, A B A'. The unusually long text, of four lines for the A section and {{two for the}} B section, results in Bach's solution to repeat {{the end of the}} first line (my eternal good) after all text of A, and then after the middle section B repeat only the first line as A', thus ending A and A' the same way. In this modified repeat, the voice holds a long note on the word [...] ("peace"), after which the same theme appears in the orchestra and again in the continuo. The musicologist Tadashi Isoyama notes the passepied character of the music, reminiscent of secular Köthen cantatas. Mincham describes: [...] "Bach's expression of the joy of union with Christ can often <b>seem</b> <b>quite</b> worldly and uninhibited", and summarises: [...] "The 3/8 time signature, symmetrical phrasing and rapid string skirls combine to create a sense of a dance of abandonment." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{comparing}} {{the film to}} its predecessor, Dr. No, Richard Roud, writing in The Guardian, said that From Russia with Love [...] "didn't <b>seem</b> <b>quite</b> so lively, quite so fresh, or quite so rhythmically fast-moving." [...] He {{went on to say}} that [...] "...the film is highly immoral in every imaginable way; it is neither uplifting, instructive nor life-enhancing. Neither is it great film-making. But it sure is fun." [...] Writing in The Observer, Penelope Gilliatt noted that [...] "The way the credits are done has the same self-mocking flamboyance as everything else in the picture." [...] Gilliatt {{went on to say that}} the film manages [...] "to keep up its own cracking pace, nearly all the way. The set-pieces are a stunning box of tricks". The critic for The Times wrote of Bond that he is [...] "the secret ideal of the congenital square, conventional in every particular... except in morality, where he has the courage—and the physical equipment—to do without thinking what most of us feel we might be doing..." [...] The critic thought that overall, [...] "the nonsense is all very amiable and tongue-in-cheek and will no doubt make a fortune for its devisers".|$|E
500|$|In {{his review}} of the seventh season for DVD Talk, Ian Jane wrote that the series [...] "is {{one of those rare}} {{animated}} shows that can be enjoyed equally as much by both adults and children." [...] He described the concept of the show as [...] "utterly ludicrous." [...] He cited the episodes [...] "SpongeBob's Last Stand" [...] and [...] "Tentacle-Vision" [...] as [...] "interesting stand outs," [...] while the episodes [...] "The Inside Job", [...] "Back To The Past", [...] "Gary in Love", and [...] "The Abrasive Side" [...] as [...] "memorable episodes this time around." [...] However, Jane said that the season is not as good as the previous seasons, writing [...] "It's not that this more recent material isn't fun, because it is, but by this point in time storylines are beginning to get a little repetitive and as such, the series doesn't <b>seem</b> <b>quite</b> as fresh and original as it once did." [...] Jane [...] "recommended" [...] the DVD set, writing [...] "This latest collection of episodes is not a high point in the series but it's still decent enough family friendly entertainment, even if it does get too repetitive for its own good." ...|$|E

2500|$|Beinn a’ Chuallaich is a {{sizeable}} and extensive hill which can <b>seem</b> <b>quite</b> inconspicuous {{when viewed from}} certain places, especially from the south. This is {{mainly because of the}} close proximity of the more eye catching and higher Schiehallion which lies seven km to the SE across Dunalastair Water and dominates Strath Tummel. However Beinn a' Chuallaich is well seen from the head of Glen Errochty where it shows its long NE ridge and its craggy eastern corrie. The hill reaches a height of 892 metres (2926feet) and qualifies as a Corbett and a Marilyn.|$|E

2500|$|The {{series has}} also {{received}} {{its fair share}} of criticism, led by the very same agencies who have praised it. CraveOnline was not pleased with the new Johnny Cage, rating the episode a 4 out of 10, claiming Mullins' Johnny Cage [...] "doesn't quite have the right look, a good delivery or impressive martial arts moves". IGN noted of episode one that the [...] "production values don't <b>seem</b> <b>quite</b> as tight and concise as [...] " [...] in addition to light story and [...] "flat" [...] editing and performances.|$|E
2500|$|Richard Gillmore {{states that}} [...] "the {{previous}} Coen brothers movie {{that has the}} most in common with No Country for Old Men is, in fact, Fargo (1996). In Fargo there is an older, wiser police chief, Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) {{just as there is}} in No Country for Old Men. In both movies, a local police officer is confronted with some grisly murders committed by men who are not from his or her town. In both movies, greed lies behind the plots. Both movies feature as a central character a cold-blooded killer who does not <b>seem</b> <b>quite</b> human and whom the police officer seeks to apprehend." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{contrast}} to other contemporary travel writers, such as Thomas Pennant, Gilpin included little history, and few facts or anecdotes. Even Gilpin's descriptions can <b>seem</b> <b>quite</b> vague, concentrating on how scenery conformed to picturesque principles {{rather than its}} specific character. In one much-quoted passage, Gilpin takes things to an extreme, suggesting that [...] "a mallet judiciously used" [...] might render the insufficiently ruinous gable of Tintern Abbey more picturesque. In the same work he criticises [...] John Dyer's description of the view from Grongar Hill for describing a distant object in too much detail. Such passages were easy pickings for satirists such as Jane Austen demonstrated in Northanger Abbey {{as well as many}} of her other novels and works. (Elizabeth Bennet, in Pride and Prejudice, notably refuses to join Mr. Darcy and the Bingley sisters in a stroll with the teasing observation, [...] "You are charmingly group'd, and...The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth.") ...|$|E
