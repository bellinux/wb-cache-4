25|$|Then again, Castelao {{seemed to}} have gained a sympathy {{for the idea of}} full {{independence}} for Galicia {{in the last years of}} his life, as succinctly mentioned in <b>Sempre</b> in Galiza and in a number of late texts and letters.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} his life, and as {{expressed}} in the final parts of <b>Sempre</b> en Galiza, Castelao became somewhat disappointed with the Spanish Republican politicians in exile, and began to discuss the advantages of a completely independent Galician State.|$|E
25|$|From 1930 Rodríguez Castelao's {{political}} activism intensifies even further. His {{life and work}} always revolved around politics and his Galician nationalist ideas. In his book <b>Sempre</b> en Galiza he states that all his works, talent and efforts would always {{be used for the}} profit of the Galician cause.|$|E

The owner of Helium decided that 'Eduardo Lincoln' was not commercial enough as a name, and released the album as Ao Teu Ouvido (In Your Ear) by Ed Lincoln. The album was re-released {{at various times}} under other titles including Boite, Impacto and Ontem Hoje e <b>Sempre.</b>|$|E
25|$|He {{became a}} member of the Royal Galician Academy in 1933, and shortly after that, in 1935, he was forced into exile by the Spanish {{government}} to the Spanish city of Badajoz, in Extremadura, where he worked as a civil servant. It was then where he began to write what would become his key work, <b>Sempre</b> en Galiza. In 1936 he gained a seat at the Spanish parliament, this time representing the Popular Front coalition, which included the Galicianist Party.|$|E
25|$|In 1987, Fulci accused Sacchetti of {{stealing}} a story idea of his, a project {{which they were}} planning to do together in 1983 after Fulci returned from Mexico. He claimed that Sacchetti later allowed director Lamberto Bava to direct the project (under the title Per <b>Sempre</b> / Until Death) in 1987 without Fulci's knowledge that the film was even being made. Luca M. Palmerini and Gaetano Mistretta's book Spaghetti Nightmares, publishes two full interviews, one with Fulci and one with Sacchetti, explaining {{the reasons for the}} fallout.|$|E
25|$|The quartet {{that follows}} the episode begins with a {{similarly}} sweet statement by Desdemona, asking for Otello to forgive her if she has done anything. This is overshadowed by the aside brooding of Otello about his perception of her guilt, which is marked by shorter, more separated phrases in the strings. Meanwhile, as Iago and Emilia join into the music with their quarrel, the music darkens until it is strangely sad towards the end, even when the orchestral accompaniment ends. After {{the end of the}} quartet proper, the music once again regains its sweet nature, as Desdemona's farewell statements are accompanied by the violins and oboe, however soon after her departure, it rapidly darkens, Otello broods to the incessant notes of the bassoons and lower violin statements. However, this is immediately transferred into an anger towards Iago which is reflected in the accented statements made by the full orchestra. Otello's distress is reflected by his farewell to fame and glory ("Ora e per <b>sempre</b> addio"). Repeated lower chords on the harp along with triplet movement in the lower strings give the portion a dark tone, despite the majestic interludes of the brass and the melody (which would, on its own, be cheerful).|$|E

2500|$|In 1944, {{while in}} Buenos Aires, he {{finished}} and published {{a work of}} Galician political theory: <b>Sempre</b> en Galiza (lit. [...] "Always in Galicia"), which {{was in fact a}} compilation of three books (three parts) {{and a number of other}} texts. <b>Sempre</b> en Galiza has been considered one of the most advanced political texts of its time. Also in that year he became the first president of the Consello de Galiza, the Government of Galicia in exile. In 1945, together with Catalan and Basque intellectuals in exile, he founded the magazine Galeuzca as an evocation of the political alliance of 1933 between Galicia, Catalonia and the Basque Country. In 1946 he was appointed as Minister of the Spanish Republican government in exile, living in Paris. In 1947, back in Buenos Aires and after being diagnosed with lung cancer, he published As cruces de pedra na Galiza.|$|E
2500|$|Sacchetti's version differs: [...] "When I {{proposed}} to Lucio my original treatment for Per <b>Sempre,</b> which {{was nothing more}} than a sequel to The Postman Always Rings Twice in which a dead man returns to life, he became really enthusiastic and had my story read by a producer friend of his who then commissioned me to write a finished script. At that time, Fulci assumed that he would direct it. Later, for various reasons, problems arose and the film was never made. Four years later, (Lamberto) Bava used my script to make Per <b>Sempre</b> and Fulci, who was not working much at the time, got angry with me and started hurling these accusations. It's one thing for him to say that we were originally supposed to make the film together, but to claim that he originated the story and that I stole it from him is pure science fiction".|$|E
2500|$|After {{the guests}} leave, Violetta wonders if Alfredo could {{actually}} be the one in her life (Violetta: È strano! ... Ah, fors'è lui – [...] "Ah, perhaps he is the one"). But she concludes that she needs freedom to live her life (Violetta, Alfredo: <b>Sempre</b> libera – [...] "Always free"). From off stage, Alfredo's voice is heard singing about love as he walks down the street.|$|E
2500|$|In 1930, {{he founded}} the Galician Republican Federation at Lestrove Palace and participated in the {{meetings}} of the Galician Nationalist Republican Party and in the assembly for the Federal State of Galicia. The next year he published the book Nós and became the official representative of the Galicianist Party to the Cortes Generales. In 1934, he published Retrincos, [...] Os dous de <b>sempre</b> and the a re-edition of Cousas.|$|E
2500|$|Of the two, Zeca Afonso {{was more}} {{prolific}} and more {{identified with the}} movement, {{so much so that}} another of his songs was the first choice for the code [...] "Venham mais 5" [...] (Let 5 more come). Other artists also used some craft to hide their meanings in the song or went into exile. One example is Adriano Correia de Oliveira that masked the explicit lyrics with the vocal tone making it difficult to distinguish the critical verse, from the refrain or even other verses. In no other song is this more noted that the ballad [...] "Trova do Vento que Passa" [...] (Song/Poem of the Passing Wind), whose lyrics by the writer Manuel Alegre were a direct criticism of the state. The music was by António Portugal but Correia used a typical Fado rhythm to hide such provocative verses as [...] "Mesmo na noite mais triste/em tempo de sevidão/há <b>sempre</b> alguém que resiste/há <b>sempre</b> alguém que diz não" [...] (even in the saddest night/in time of servitude/there is always someone who stands up/there is always someone who says No).|$|E
2500|$|Castelao was a Galician {{nationalist}} (heir of {{the early}} Galicianism), federalist, pacifist, progressist and internationalist. He accepted the autonomy granted to Galicia by the Second Spanish Republic {{as a tool to}} construct a possible Galician State, in federation with other Iberian nations. He was also a convinced pro-European. He wrote in <b>Sempre</b> en Galiza that one of his dreams was to [...] "one day see the emergence of a 'United States of Europe' [...] ".|$|E
2500|$|The Spanish {{composer}} Julian Arcas (1832–1882) wrote a [...] "Fantasía sobre motivos de La traviata". The arrangement {{opens with}} a paraphrase of the opera's prelude. The rest of the work consists of arrangements of Violetta's three arias, each featuring special techniques of the guitar. Addio, del passato bei sogni ridenti features a brief tremolo passage; Ah fors'è lui is in harmonics; and the closing arrangement of <b>Sempre</b> libera features fast scales that suggest a new genre of [...] "coloratura guitar." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although bilingual in Galician and Spanish, Castelao always {{wrote and}} {{published}} in Galician, with very rare exceptions. He was a keen defender of Galician culture and considered the language {{to be the key}} element of cohesion among the Galician people. In <b>Sempre</b> en Galiza he stated [...] "If we are Galician that is because of the language". Castelao often criticised the imposition of Spanish language in Galicia, and demanded for Galician to become an official language and thus the preferred language in the administration and education.|$|E
2500|$|A {{new version}} of the album was {{released}} in November 2014 for the hispanophone market. The new edition includes a duet with Thalía in [...] "Sino a ti", a {{new version of}} [...] "Entre tu y mil mares", featuring Melendi, and a re-recording of [...] "Donde quedo solo yo", performed with Alex Ubago. The latter was also recorded under the title [...] "Jo <b>sempre</b> hi seré", becoming Pausini's first Catalan song. This version was included in El disc de La Marató 2014, a compilation album related to the telethon organized by Catalan channel TV3, with the purpose to raise money against cardiovascular diseases.|$|E
2500|$|Screenwriter Julian P. Gardner {{created a}} musical {{production}} number, [...] "Big Surprise" [...] {{as the children}} at Weekum's orphanage plead Santa Claus for more toy cats. Other songs include the chorus [...] "Babe in the Woods" [...] and the powerful chant, [...] "Ora e <b>Sempre</b> (Today and Forever)" [...] representing the immortals. Bernard Hoffer composed the music, as well as setting a quatrain by Baum inspired by Claus's famous laugh. The presentation of the Christmas tree is different; Claus, realizing his death is imminent, decorates a tree with ornaments and suggests it should be his memorial.|$|E
2500|$|The {{concluding}} ensemble {{delivers the}} moral of the opera – [...] "Such {{is the end of the}} evildoer: the death of a sinner always reflects his life" [...] ("Questo è il fin di chi fa mal, e de' perfidi la morte alla vita è <b>sempre</b> ugual"). As mentioned above, the final ensemble was customarily omitted from productions for over a century beginning with the original run in Prague, but it started to be performed again frequently in the 20th century and is now is usually included in productions of the opera. The return to D major and the innocent simplicity of the last few bars conclude the opera.|$|E
2500|$|By a giant oak tree, Giacomo prays for {{the safety}} of his {{daughter}} Giovanna, who before she falls asleep by a [...] nearby shrine offers prayers to be chosen to lead the French forces. (Aria: <b>Sempre</b> all'alba ed alla sera – [...] "always at dawn and in the evening"). Suddenly, Charles arrives, prepared to lay down his arms {{at the base of the}} tree. [...] Meanwhile, the sleeping Giovanna has visions in which angels ask her to become a soldier and lead France to victory (Tu sei bella, the Demons' Waltz). She cries out that she is ready to do so. [...] Charles overhears her and thrills at her courage. [...] Her father Giacomo weeps, believing that his daughter has given her soul to the Devil out of her devotion to the future King.|$|E
2500|$|Otello {{dismisses the}} others, and {{declares}} {{that he now}} believes that Desdemona may be deceiving him (Otello: Ora e per <b>sempre</b> addio sante memorie / [...] "Now and forever farewell, holy memories"). Iago returns, and the jealous Otello demands proof of Desdemona's infidelity. Iago says that once, when he and Cassio were sleeping in the same room, he heard Cassio talking to Desdemona in a dream. In the dream, says Iago, Cassio told Desdemona {{that they must be}} careful to conceal their love. (Iago: Era la notte, Cassio dormia / [...] "It was night, Cassio was sleeping".) Iago says that dreams don't prove anything, but remarks that he saw Cassio carrying Desdemona's strawberry-embroidered handkerchief just the day before. Otello swears vengeance on Desdemona and Cassio, and Iago joins him in his vow (Otello, Iago: Sì, pel ciel marmoreo giuro / [...] "Yes, by the marble heavens I swear").|$|E
2500|$|When Mary {{is brought}} in by Talbot, Elizabeth reacts with hostility (È <b>sempre</b> la stessa: superba, orgogliosa / She is always the same, proud, overbearing") and, after each {{character}} collectively expresses his or her feelings, Mary approaches and kneels before the Queen (Aria: Morta al mondo, ab! morta al trono / [...] "Dead to the world, and dead to the throne… I come to beg your pardon"). The confrontation soon becomes hostile. Elizabeth accuses Mary of having murdered her husband, Lord Darnley, as well as acts of treason and debauchery, all the while Leicester attempting to calm both sides. Stung by Elizabeth's false accusations, Mary calls her the Figlia impura di Bolena ("Impure daughter of Boleyn") and continues with the final insult: Profanato è il soglio inglese, vil bastarda, dal tuo piè! ("The English throne is sullied, vile bastard, by your foot"). Elizabeth is horrified and demands that the guards take Mary away, declaring [...] "The axe that awaits you will show my revenge". Mary is returned to captivity.|$|E
