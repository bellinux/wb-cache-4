30|$|The {{increasing}} demand for wireless multimedia and interactive Internet <b>services</b> <b>incurs</b> intensive research efforts on design of novel wireless communication systems for high-speed, reliable, and cost-effective transmission solutions. Upcoming cellular standards like the 3 GPP LTE Advanced are targeting universal frequency reuse {{in a bid}} to increase peak data rates. This could, however, lead to high levels of intercell interference (ICI) due to simultaneous transmissions on the same frequency by neighboring base stations (BSs). The ICI can significantly reduce data rates and cause outages in cellular systems especially at cell edges. In order to solve this problem, cooperative multicell transmission has emerged as a promising technique to effectively reduce the ICI, enhance cell-edge throughput, and increase whole system throughput for cellular communication system [1, 2].|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a technique to}} provide seamless communications in mobile wireless networks. The goal of seamless communication is to provide disruption free service to a mobile user. A disruption in service could occur due to active handoffs (handoffs during an active connection). Existing protocols either provide total guarantee for disruption free <b>service</b> <b>incurring</b> heavy network bandwidth usage (multicast based approach), or do not provide any guarantee for disruption free service (forwarding approach). There are many user applications {{that do not require}} a "total" guarantee for disruption free service but would also not tolerate very frequent disruptions.

The main advantage of the staggered multicast approach is that it exploits the performance guarantees provided by the multicast approach and also provides the much required savings in the static network bandwidth.

40|$|Abstract. With the {{emergence}} of Web service technologies, it has become possible to use high level megaprogramming models and visual tools to easily build distributed systems using Web services as reusable components. However, when attempting to apply the Web service composition paradigm in practical settings, some limitations become apparent. First of all, all kinds of existing “legacy ” components must be wrapped as Web <b>services,</b> <b>incurring</b> in additional development, maintenance, and unnecessary runtime overheads. Second, current implementations of Web service protocols guarantee interoperability at high runtime costs, which justifies the composition of only coarse-grained Web services. To address these limitations and support the composition of also fine-grained services, {{in this paper we}} generalize the notion of service by introducing an open service meta-model. This offers freedom of choice between different types of services, which also include, but are not limited to, Web services. As a consequence, we argue that service composition – defined at the level of service interfaces – should be orthogonal from the mechanisms and the protocols which are used to access the actual service implementations. ...|$|R
40|$|In many online systems, {{individuals}} {{provide services}} for each other; {{the recipient of}} the service obtains a benefit but the provider of the <b>service</b> <b>incurs</b> a cost. If benefit exceeds cost, provision of the service increases social welfare and should therefore be encouraged [...] but the individuals providing the service gain no (immediate) benefit from providing the service and hence have an incentive to withhold service. Hence there is scope for designing a system that improves welfare by encouraging exchange. To operate successfully {{within the confines of the}} online environment, such a system should be distributed, practicable, and consistent with individual incentives. This paper proposes and analyzes a simple such system that relies on the exchange of tokens; the emphasis is on the design of a protocol (number of tokens and suggested strategies). We provide estimates for the efficiency of such protocols and show that choosing the right protocol will lead to almost full efficiency if agents are sufficiently patient. However, choosing the wrong protocols may lead to an enormous loss of efficiency. Comment: 55 pages, 4 figure...|$|R

40|$|We {{present an}} actor {{platform}} for {{wireless sensor networks}} (WSNs). A typical WSN may consist of hundreds {{to tens of thousands}} of tiny nodes embdedded in an environment. Hence, manual reprogramming of nodes for development, fixing bugs and updating features is an arduous process; moreover, in some cases physical access to nodes is simply out of the question. In an attempt to address this problem, network reprogramming tools such as Deluge and MNP [10, 14] have been developed. Unfortunately, these bulk reprogramming <b>services</b> <b>incur</b> significant costs in terms of energy usage, latency, and loss of sensing coverage when nodes are rebooted into a new program image. ActorNet, in contrast, provides an environment for lightweight concurrent object-oriented mobile code on WSNs. As such, actorNet enables a wide range of new dynamic applications on WSNs, including support for fully customizable queries and aggregation functions, in-network interactive debugging facilities, and high-level concurrent programming on the inherently parallel sensor network platform. Moreover, actorNet cleanly integrates all of these features into a fine-tuned, multi-threaded embedded Scheme interpreter which supports compact, maintainable programs – a significant advantage over primitive stack-based virtual machines [15, 8]. ...|$|R

40|$|The free-riding problem occurs if the presales {{activities}} {{needed to}} sell a product can be conducted separately from the actual sale of the product. Intuitively, free riding should hurt the retailer that provides that service, but the author shows analytically that free riding benefits not only the free-riding retailer, but also the retailer that provides the service when customers are heterogeneous {{in terms of their}} opportunity costs for shopping. The service-providing retailer has a postservice advantage, because customers who have resolved their matching uncertainty through sales <b>service</b> <b>incur</b> zero marginal shopping cost if they purchase from the service-providing retailer rather than the free-riding retailer. Moreover, allowing free riding gives the free rider less incentive to compete with the service provider on price, because many customers eventually will switch to it due to their own free riding. In turn, this induced soft strategic response enables the service provider to charge a higher price and enjoy the strictly positive profit that otherwise would have been wiped away by head-to-head price competition. Therefore, allowing free riding can be regarded as a necessary mechanism that prevents an aggressive response from another retailer and reduces the intensity of price competition. free riding, sales service, selling cost, channel conflict, retail competition, competitive strategy, game theory...|$|R
