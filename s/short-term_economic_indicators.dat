40|$|This paper {{uses the}} INTIMO {{model of the}} Italian economy to analyze the {{economic}} impacts of a reduction in social security contributions. This manoeuvre is intended to reduce the {{tax wedge on labour}} cost. There is a wide choice of ways to neutralize the revenue effects of a lower tax yield, because several of the existing taxes could be increased and new ones could be introduced. In this study, alternative financing coverages are developed and applied in the model. The results of the study show that substituting different taxes for social security contributions affects the cost of production, and impacts vary with industries. A reduction in contributions compensated for by an increase in value-added tax produces the best results in terms of <b>short-term</b> <b>economic</b> <b>indicators,</b> but the improvement in environmental conditions—not analyzed in this study—achieved by energy taxes could be a very important target and could justify the recourse to this tool.

40|$|The U. S. economy {{continued}} {{to expand in}} the first half of 2005 despite the strong impact of a further rise in oil prices. However, according to OECD estimates, Hurricane Katrina will dampen economic growth by 0. 5 percentage point to 3. 1 % for the whole year 2005. The Japanese economy remained on its growth path in the second quarter of 2005. The other Asian economies — especially dynamic China — also expanded further. Conversely, GDP growth in the euro area slowed down in the second quarter of 2005. Hit by energy price increases, private consumption generated a marginally negative contribution to growth, while foreign trade and investment made only small positive contributions to growth. Whereas the leading indicators had sent out positive signals since May, these signals recently reversed, so that the outlook for the second half of 2005 deteriorated. Once again, energy price developments are the main culprit; they are also the reason for the persistently high level of inflation. Growth in most of the Central European new Member States (NMS) as well as the EU candidate countries slowed in the first quarter of 2005 compared to the full year 2004. Only in Bulgaria and in the Czech Republic did GDP growth accelerate somewhat. In the second quarter of 2005, economic activity picked up in all Central EuropeanNMSsave Slovakia, where it remained stable at a high level. After the upward pressure on prices experienced in 2004 — largely as a consequence of EU accession — 2005 is marked by positive base effects, which have helped slow down inflation in the NMS. The Austrian economy, which had enjoyed robust export-driven growth in 2004, lost momentum in the first quarter of 2005 but regained speed in the second quarter. The OeNB's <b>short-term</b> <b>economic</b> <b>indicator</b> points to 1. 8 % real GDP growth for the full year 2005, which corresponds to a downward revision by 0. 2 percentage point compared with the forecast that the OeNB published in June.

The Monthly Inquiry into the Distribution and Services Sector (MIDSS) is {{designed to meet the}} Government need for the production of a monthly Index of Services (IoS) and the Index of Distribution (IoD) which is a component of the IoS. Turnover data are collected monthly and, additionally, employment data are collected quarterly. It is used to estimate the change in turnover (and employment) in the service and distribution industries (excluding retail). MIDSS provides 40 % of the current turnover data used in the compilation of the IoS and 45 % of the data used to estimate the number of employees in the distribution and service industries. Both of these measures are key <b>short-term</b> <b>economic</b> <b>indicators.</b> The MIDSS also provides 30 % per cent of the output measure of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and feeds into the income measure of GDP along with other labour market data. There is no other official source of short-term economic data for distribution and service sectors with the comprehensive coverage of the MIDSS. MIDSS covers the following sectors: motor trades, wholesale, hotels and restaurants, transport and postal services (excluding national post activities), renting, computer and related services, research and development, business services (e. g. labour recruitment and accounting), sewage and refuse disposal, recreation, and other services.

40|$|The {{world economy}} has {{overcome}} the cyclical trough. On {{the back of}} extensive economic stimulus programs, most economies returned to positive growth rates {{in the second half}} of 2009, with emerging countries taking the lead. The rate of the recovery, however, diverges strongly across the different regions. Not only the emerging Asian countries grew at a vigorous pace; the U. S. economy, too, posted healthy quarter-on-quarter growth at a rate last seen six years ago. Yet, recentconfidence <b>indicators</b> suggest that <b>economic</b> growth will continue at a slower pace. While the world economic recovery gained momentum in the fourth quarter of 2009, the development of economic activity in the euro area remained below expectations. In comparison with the previous quarter, the economy of the single currency area grew by 0. 1 % in the fourth quarter of 2009, with growth driven exclusively by the positive contribution of net exports. Euro area domestic demand is unlikely to give growth a genuine boost in the quarters to come. Current forecasts generally point to a gradual recovery of economic activity in the euro area, which will, however, be weaker than the U. S. revival. Euro area HICP inflation returned to positive levels in November 2009. This was due primarily to base effects stemming from commodity prices. The disinflation process of core items, however, is continuing. Given the sluggish recovery in economic activity, the annual core inflation rate fell to a record low of 0. 8 % in February 2010. The latest forecasts predict that there will be no risks to price stability until the end of 2011. Especially thanks to a slight recovery in international demand, the Central, Eastern and Southeastern (CESEE) EU Member States entered a period of economic stabilization {{in the second half of}} 2009, recording – once again – moderately positive average growth rates (on a quarterly basis). However, cyclical developments still vary significantly across the countries of the region. The economic downturn caused current account balances to improve throughout the entire region and brought down inflation rates in several countries. After undergoing the deepest and longest recession in post-war history, Austria registered moderate economic growth in the second half of 2009, supported by the revival of international economic activity, the Austrian government stimulus packages and the inventory cycle. According to recent results of the <b>short-term</b> <b>economic</b> <b>indicator</b> of the Oesterreichische Nationalbank (OeNB), growth is set to remain stable. Real GDP is expected to grow by 0. 5 % in both the first and the second quarters of 2010 (seasonally and working day adjusted, quarter on quarter). For the entire year 2010 the OeNB expects a real GDP growth rate of about 1 ½%. global outlook, euro area, central and (south-) eastern Europe, Austria...|$|R

40|$|Most of the Euro-zone <b>economic</b> <b>short-term</b> <b>indicators</b> are {{computed}} through aggregation from Member States data. The {{seasonally adjusted}} figures {{can be calculated}} by seasonally adjusting the aggregate (direct approach) or aggregating the seasonally adjusted national data (indirect approach). Statistical and practical considerations to choose the right strategy are given in the paper. An application to the Euro-zone GDP is presented. The same aggregation problem encountered {{in the case of}} seasonal adjustment will persist when extracting the business cycle. Moreover, since raw figures imply problems in terms of excessive noise of the series, analysts generally prefer the use of seasonally adjusted time series. As a consequence, the problem of choosing between direct and indirect both in seasonal adjustment and in business cycle extraction appears to be closely linked. In fact, the approach chosen to seasonally adjust the data can in theory lead to different results when the cyclical component has to be extracted from sea-sonally adjusted data. After a review of different filters widely used in the literature, we extracted the cycle indicator for the Euro-zone employing the Baxter-King filter to data coming from both direct and indirect seasonally adjustment approach and then compared the relative results. ...|$|R
