5|$|In 1875, Elizabeth Johnson {{discovered}} {{the remains of}} a Pawnee village in Republic County, Kansas. <b>She</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> it might be the site of Pike's flag incident; but hearing of another village in Webster County, Nebraska, she dispatched her husband and another man to investigate this site. Because the surface had been altered by cultivation, they found little evidence of habitation, and Johnson was persuaded that the Republic County site was Pike's village. She prevented its being plowed on several occasions, and eventually purchased the land.|$|E
5|$|Jinnah was {{the central}} figure of the 1998 film Jinnah, {{which was based on}} Jinnah's life and his {{struggle}} for the creation of Pakistan. Christopher Lee, who portrayed Jinnah, called his performance the best of his career. The 1954 Hector Bolitho's book Jinnah: Creator of Pakistan prompted Fatima Jinnah to release a book, titled My Brother (1987), as <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> Bolitho's book had failed to express the political aspects of Jinnah. The book received positive reception in Pakistan. Jinnah of Pakistan (1984) by Stanley Wolpert is {{regarded as one of the}} best biographical books on Jinnah.|$|E
5|$|Norio Tsukudani based Himegoto on {{an earlier}} four-panel manga she drew for fun during her time as a student. At that time, the main {{characters}} {{that make up the}} student council were instead members of the drama club. However, Tsukudani decided to change this when developing Himegoto to be serialized in Ichijinsha's Waai! magazine, and she decided {{it would be easier to}} manage a cross-dressing character if he was in the student council. Before creating Himegoto, Tsukudani read various works of fiction that featured cross-dressing boys, but many of them featured the boys being paired with other boys. When she proposed the idea of Himegoto, she wanted to pair a cross-dressing boy with girls, which Tsukudani herself wanted to read. In this way, <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> a variety of different people would enjoy it.|$|E

5|$|She was {{assigned}} {{to try to stop}} the MTV Movie Awards from featuring a South Park satire which poked fun at Scientology and the film based on a book by its founder L. Ron Hubbard, titled Battlefield Earth. Christman repeatedly called the New York City office of MTV in an attempt to get them to stop the satire from airing. In the eventual broadcast, which ran June 8, 2000, the South Park character Cartman was shown using a Scientology personality test as toilet paper. Christman believed she had succeeded in her mission, for <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> her efforts prevented the book Dianetics from being used by Cartman, instead of the personality test.|$|E
5|$|Tracey Macleod ate at Pétrus for The Independent {{shortly after}} {{it opened in}} 1999. <b>She</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> certain touches would impress the Michelin inspectors, and that the dishes were {{suitably}} elaborate. Jay Rayner visited the restaurant whilst {{it was at the}} Bekerley Hotel in 2003 for The Observer. He thought that the menu was over complicated, and not all the elements of the dishes worked together. Gillian Glover of The Scotsman thought in 2005 that some of the food served was forgettable, but stand out elements included frog leg lolipops which came with her main course of baked seabass with garlic puree.|$|E
5|$|In 1969, Marcella Saunders, a 23-year-old {{teacher at}} Jefferson High School in Los Angeles, found that her ninth-grade {{students}} {{were unable to}} read the short stories and poetry in the class textbook. <b>She</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that,</b> because her students were more familiar with television than poetry or short stories, she would have more success in teaching her students if she taught them {{by way of a}} television series. She found that her students liked Bewitched, Room 222, and Julia, so she contacted the corresponding television studios to tell them about her idea. Only Bewitched responded. Having gained an audience with Montgomery and her husband William Asher, Saunders told the couple that most students at the school were unable to read, write, or comprehend at a high school level, with 44% reading at a third grade level and very few students reading at a level much higher than that; less than 1% were reading at a ninth grade level. Saunders added that Bewitched was the students' favorite television series.|$|E

5|$|In September 1990, Dugard and {{her family}} moved from the Los Angeles County city of Arcadia, to Meyers, a rural town south of South Lake Tahoe, California, because {{they thought it was}} a safer community. At the time of the abduction, Dugard was in the fifth grade and, because of her shyness, was {{worrying}} about an upcoming field trip. She was close to her mother, Terry Probyn, and her infant half sister Shayna who was born in 1990. Her biological father, Ken Slayton, did not know he had fathered a child. Although her mother married a man named Carl Probyn, Dugard was never close to her stepfather. On June 10, 1991, Dugard's mother, who worked as a typesetter at a print house, left for work early in the day. Eleven-year-old Dugard, wearing her favorite all-pink outfit, walked up the hill from her house, against traffic, to catch the school bus. When she was halfway up the hill, a car approached her. <b>She</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> the man in the car would ask for directions. When he rolled down the window, he shocked her unconscious with a stun gun and abducted her. The man was Phillip Greg Garrido. Nancy, who the District Attorney in the Dugard case believes scouted Dugard as a prize for Garrido, held Dugard down in the car as she drifted {{in and out of consciousness}} during the three hour drive from her home to the Garrido home in Antioch. The only time Dugard spoke was when she pleaded that her parents could not afford a ransom.|$|E

25|$|Flora Solomon {{claims in}} her {{autobiography}} that in August 1962, during a {{reception at the}} Weizmann Institute, she told Rothschild that <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> Tomás Harris and Kim Philby were Soviet spies.|$|E
25|$|Schlafly {{joined the}} John Birch Society, but quit because <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> the main {{communist}} {{threats to the}} nation were external rather than internal.

25|$|In 1887 Zitkála-Šá {{returned}} to the Yankton Reservation {{to live with her}} mother. She spent three years there. She was dismayed to realize that, while she still longed for the native Sioux traditions, she no longer fully belonged to them. In addition, <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> many on the reservation were conforming to the dominant white culture.|$|E

25|$|In 1897 in Munich, Rainer Maria Rilke met {{and fell}} in love with the widely travelled, {{intellectual}} woman of letters Lou Andreas-Salomé. Rilke changed his first name from “René” to “Rainer” at Lou's urging because <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> name to be more masculine, forceful, and Germanic. His relationship with this married woman, with whom he undertook two extensive trips to Russia, lasted until 1900. But even after their separation, Lou continued to be Rilke's most important confidante until the end of his life. Having trained from 1912 to 1913 as a psychoanalyst with Sigmund Freud, she shared her knowledge of psychoanalysis with Rilke.|$|E
25|$|In 1949 {{at the age}} of 31, she {{graduated}} from Dickinson College with another bachelor's degree in math after studying for one year. Her math professor gave her a chance to continue her studies in the University of Chicago in math department. However, she studied solid state physics at the University of Pennsylvania. <b>She</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> compared with math, physics was more applicable and more useful for China at that period. She graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1955 {{at the age of}} 37 with the doctorate in solid state physics, becoming the first Chinese to earn a doctorate degree from this university.|$|E
25|$|During the {{serialization}} of Angel Sanctuary, she mistakenly {{titled the}} Gehenna story arc as the Yetzirah arc, and {{was unable to}} correct it as several chapters had already appeared under the title; she corrected it for the tankōban release. As the manga takes place in July 1999, Yuki expressed a goal to complete the series by then. For the conclusion, she originally had planned to use a tragic ending, but decided against it in favor of a happy one, because <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> it would be too upsetting for the fans to read after twenty volumes. She wrote in her final afterword that Setsuna and Sara have reached emotional maturity after their adventures and will live happily together.|$|E

25|$|When the manga began serialization, Arakawa was {{considering}} several major plot points, including the ending. She wanted the Elric brothers to recover their bodiesat least partly. As the plot continued, <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> some characters were maturing {{and decided to}} change some scenes. Arakawa said the manga authors Suihō Tagawa and Hiroyuki Eto are her main inspirations for her character designs; she describes her artwork as a mix of both of them. She found that the easiest of the series's characters to draw were Alex Louis Armstrong, and the little animals. Arakawa likes dogs so she included several {{of them in the}} story. Arakawa made comedy central to the manga's story because she thinks it is intended for entertainment, and tried to minimize sad scenes.|$|E
25|$|At a Management Unit {{meeting on}} 24 November, Anna's case manager said that <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> Anna was not German {{at all but}} an Australian with German parents. Other staff at Baxter, as well as DIMIA staff in Canberra, were {{informed}} of this opinion. Previously, on 12 November, the German Consulate in Melbourne had {{decided to try to}} identify Anna. They contacted an officer of the Victoria Police, who, in turn, contacted the DIMIA headquarters in Canberra. DIMIA contacted the Consulate on 6 December, but neither had made any progress. Meanwhile, on 22 December, police in Manly, New South Wales contacted DIMIA, without providing photographs or other information, to see if Rau had used her Australian passport to leave the country.|$|E
25|$|Rochester {{opposed the}} {{election}} of William and Mary as king and queen, raising his voice {{for the establishment of}} a regency on behalf of the exiled James. But he soon reconciled himself to the new order, perhaps because he could not retain his pension unless he took the oaths of allegiance. After this he was quickly in the royal favour and again a member of the Privy Council. He advised the queen in ecclesiastical matters, and returned to his former position as the leader of the High Church party. Rochester tried to mediate in the quarrel between Princess Anne and the King and Queen, but with little success. Anne, who could be a bitter enemy, thanked him for his expressions of goodwill, but added sarcastically that she would have valued them much more if <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> they had been sincere.|$|E
60|$|And Dea Flavia smiled because already <b>she</b> guessed--or <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> guessed--what {{would follow}} the tying of her shoe--a humble kiss upon her foot, the natural homage of a man to her beauty and to her power.|$|R
