50|$|Numismatic {{evidence}} {{reveals the}} existence of independent rulers of Panchala during the post-Mauryan period. Most of the coins issued by them are found at Ahichatra and adjoining areas. All the coins are round, made of a copper alloy and have a set pattern on the obverse-a deeply incised <b>square</b> <b>punch</b> consisting of a row of three symbols and the ruler's name placed in a single line below them. The reverse bears depictions of the deities or sometimes of their attributes, whose names form {{a component of the}} issuers' names (for example, coins of Agnimitra bear the depiction of Agni). The names of the rulers found on these coins are Vangapala, Yajnapala, Damagupta, Rudragupta, Jayagupta, Suryamitra, Phalgunimitra, Bhanumitra, Bhumimitra, Dhruvamitra, Agnimitra, Indramitra, Vishnumitra, Jayamitra, Prajapatimitra, Varunamitra, Anamitra, Bhadraghosha and Yugasena (the reverse of the coins of Varunamitra, Yugasena and Anamitra do not exhibit any deity). Shaunakayaniputra Vangapala, ruler of Ahichatra, whom Vaidehiputra Ashadhasena mentioned as his grandfather in his Pabhosa inscription, is identified with king Vangapala, known from his coins. The name of Damagupta is also found on a clay sealing.|$|E

The process has a simple tooling set in which a circular blank can be easily deformed by a flat headed <b>square</b> <b>punch</b> through a conical die with a square aperture. Finite element analysis (FEA) was used to study the influences of the geometric parameters on the formability of square cup {{in order to find}} out the optimum setup dimensions of the present process. The effects of die fillet radius, die corner radius, die throat length, punch profile radius; punch corner radius, punch shape factor, relative die clearance and blank thickness on the drawability of square cup were mainly investigated. Cup drawability was also studied with the change of material strain hardening exponent, n, strength coefficient, K, average anisotropy, R, and friction coefficients between die-sheet-punch to find the best operating conditions. The limiting drawing ratio (LDR) was used to evaluate the effects of all these parameters on the square cup drawability. The LDR's, maximum drawing loads, cup thickness, cup height and modes of failure were predicted. The analysis reveals that the determination of the optimum setup dimensions of our developed process has increased the drawing ratio up to 3. 1 for brass alloy (67 / 33 Cu-Zn) and 3. 15 for aluminum (Al 99. 5 w) in a single-drawing stroke. Experiments have been also done in order to compare and verify the FE-predictions. Successful square cups with drawing ratio of 3. 07 for brass and 2. 93 for aluminum were produced. These LDR's are significantly higher than that of the improved conventional methods with blank holder...|$|E
40|$|In this article, a {{new process}} for {{increasing}} the drawability of square cups has been developed. A circular blank is pushed by a flat-headed <b>square</b> <b>punch</b> through a conical die with a square aperture. The deformed blank conforms to the square shape of the die throat and finally a square cup is obtained. The developed technique has a simple tooling set in which the drawing process can be efficiently preformed in a single-acting stroke without using draw beads or blankholder. A commercial finite element simulation package, DYNAFORM, is used to investigate the developed setup {{in order to determine}} the optimum die cone angle. An experimental setup is built accordingly with a half cone angle of 18 degrees. Brass alloy (67 / 33 Cu-Zn) and commercially pure aluminum (Al 99. 5 w) sheets are used in the experimentations. The effects of the original blank thickness (t(0) = 1, 1. 5, 2, 2. 5, and 3 mm) and the orientation of the blank rolling direction (0 degrees, 22. 5 degrees, 45 degrees, and 67. 5 degrees) to the punch side on the limiting drawing ratio (LDR) and punch load are experimentally investigated. The present process successfully produces square cups with drawing ratios of 2. 92 for brass and 2. 74 for aluminum. The new process has shown superiority over the conventional methods through achieving high drawing ratio especially for thick sheets (2 - 3 mm). Comparison between experimental results and the available published work showed that the required punch force in the new process is significantly reduced while the LDR is increased.

40|$|In {{the present}} dissertation, a {{numerical}} model able {{to study the}} non-linear behaviour of structures on elastic half-space is presented. The work takes into account for first the geometric non-linearity of beams and frames on elastic half-plane, namely in plane strain or plane stress condition. This problem is important in many engineering fields {{and it has been}} studied in the past by many researchers for the design of sandwich panels in aerospace industry. Recently, this problem has been studied in relation to the buckling of thin films on elastic supports for electronic design. The problem is solved by means of a mixed variational formulation, which assumes as independent fields the displacements of the structure and the contact pressures between foundation and halfspace. The relation between surface displacement and pressure is given by the Flamant solution, which furnishes the half-plane displacement generated by a concentrated force. The second order effects due to axial loads applied on the structure are added to the total potential energy of the system in order to perform buckling analyses. Then, the model is discretized by subdividing the structure into finite elements (FEs) and simplifying contact pressures by a piecewise constant function. Hence, the stationarity conditions of the total potential energy written in discrete form furnish a system of equations which can be solved easily. A soil-structure interaction (SSI) parameter taking into account both the slenderness of the foundation beam and the stiffness of the soil is introduced. The present model was introduced for the first time by Tullini and Tralli (2010) but it was limited to linear elastic analysis. In this case, the model is extended for studying the stability of beams on elastic half-plane, considering both Euler-Bernoulli and Timoshenko beam. In the first chapter, the present model for an Euler-Bernoulli beam on elastic half-plane is compared with a traditional model characterized by the half-space modelled by two-dimensional (2 D) FEs. The present model turns out to be efficient and faster than the traditional model. Then, the stability of beams with finite length and with different end restraints is deeply discussed by determining critical loads and the corresponding mode shapes, varying the SSI parameter. Numerical examples are in good agreement with analytic solutions for the case of the beam with sliding ends. Critical loads converge to the values of a beam with infinite length on elastic half-plane and on a set of equidistant supports. The cases of beam with pinned and free ends furnish new estimates of critical loads, which are less than that for the beam with sliding ends and which are characterized by mode shapes with great deflections close to beam ends. In the second chapter, the stability of Timoshenko beams on elastic half-space is discussed. The present model is compared with a traditional model where both beam and half-plane are modelled by 2 D FEs. For stiff or quite stiff beams on soft half-plane, the present model is fast and efficient, whereas for slender beams on stiff half-plane, the present model gives critical loads greater than the ones obtained with the traditional model. Differences are caused by the second order effects of the half-plane, which are taken into account in the traditional model. Then, in the third chapter, structures on half-plane are studied taking into account the material nonlinearity for the structure. A lumped plasticity model is considered and flexural plastic hinges are introduced into the discrete model of slender beams and frames on elastic half-plane. For simplicity, a rigid-perfectly plastic moment-rotation relationship is adopted for describing the behaviour of plastic hinges. Material nonlinearity is introduced into the discrete model following an efficient approach adopted for representing semi-rigid connections of frames. The approach gives the possibility to keep the same number of beam FEs and degrees of freedom of the original model, whereas potential plastic hinges are added to beam FE ends by simply modifying the corresponding stiffness matrices. Hence, incremental analyses of beams and frames are performed by placing potential plastic hinges close to concentrated loads and at beam-column connections. In the fourth chapter of the thesis, the discrete model of a beam on elastic half-plane is extended to the three-dimensional case for performing static and buckling analysis of foundation beams. Beams on 3 D half-space are important in civil engineering field and they may adopted for representing shallow foundations on elastic soil. In this case, the relation between surface displacements and contact pressure is given by Boussinesq solution. The flexibility matrix of the soil is first determined for solving the Galerkin boundary element method, in order to study the indentation of the half-space by a rigid <b>square</b> <b>punch</b> and determining the displacements generated by uniform pressure distributions over rectangular areas. In both cases, the half-space surface is discretized in both plane directions adopting power graded meshes characterized by very small surface discretizations close to surface edges. Then, Euler-Bernoulli and Timoshenko beams on 3 D halfspace subject to different loads are studied and displacements, surface pressures and bending moments are determined. Finally, the stability of Euler-Bernoulli beams on 3 D half-space with finite length and different end restraints is considered. Critical loads and mode shapes are similar to those obtained for the 2 D case in the fist chapter, however in this case, results are strictly dependent on the ratio between beam length and width...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis {{experimental}} work concerns {{the study of}} the preforming of a specific highly double curved geometry with a triple point (case corner) by the sheet forming process using powdered interlock reinforcement (G 1151 ®). Three different <b>punches</b> (<b>square</b> box, prism, tetrahedron) were used in this study, each of them presenting highly double curved geometry with a case corner. A specific sheet forming device specially designed for the preforming of textile reinforcement was used. The expected shapes with the three punches have been obtained with an optimized blank-holder pressure. No classical defaults such as wrinkling or yarn damage are present in the useful zone of the preforms. However, a new default, not observed for spherical or hemispherical shape has been identified. It concerns the out of plane buckling of yarns. This phenomenon not observed on the square box is visible on some faces and edges of the prismatic and tetrahedron shapes. For the square box, it is easily possible to control the orientation of the yarn within the preform in the faces, whereas this is not possible for triangular faces of the prismatic and tetrahedron shapes. The <b>square</b> box <b>punch</b> is therefore more adapted to preform the highly doubled curved shape with the case corner...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The contact {{behavior}} {{between a}} transversely isotropic piezoelectric material and a rigid-conducting punch of flat-end was analyzed under {{the condition that}} there is no biased-electric potential applied to the punch. Two limiting cases were studied; one was for semi-infinite piezoelectric materials and the other for piezoelectric films with contact radius much larger than the film thickness. Analytical relationships were derived between the indentation load and the indentation depth and between the indentation-induced potential and the indentation depth. Both the indentation load and the indentation-induced potential are proportional to the indentation depth. For the adhesive contact, the pull-off force is proportional to the 3 / 2 power of the punch radius for semi-infinite piezoelectric materials and to the <b>square</b> of the <b>punch</b> radius for piezoelectric films. The piezoelectric charge coefficient determined from the contact deformation of a piezoelectric film with contact radius much larger than the film thickness is only dependent on dielectric constant and piezoelectric constant...|$|R

Forming of titanium sheet was tried by multistage deep drawing. In the experiment, the material was pure titanium sheets of the JIS grade 2. The initial thickness of the blank was 0. 5 mm in thickness. In the deep drawing process, the sheets were employed and a flat sheet blank is formed into a <b>square</b> by a <b>punch.</b> Various cups were drawn by exchanging the punch and die. The die was taper without a blankholder in the subsequent stages. For the prevention, pure titanium sheets were treated by heat oxide coating. The fresh and clean titanium is not in direct contact with the die during the forming due to the existence of the oxide layer. The effect of the plastic anisotropic on the occurrence of seizure in square cup deep drawing was also examined. The square cups were successfully drawn by heat oxide coating. The coating of titanium sheet has sufficient ability in preventing the seizure in multistage deep drawing operation. It was found that the square pure titanium cups were successfully formed by using heat oxide coating treatment...|$|R

The instrument proposed is an ultra-lightweight telescope, featuring a novel optical concept based on diffraction focussing.

The Fresnel array proposed here is a 3. 6 × 3. 6 m <b>square</b> opaque foil <b>punched</b> with 105 to 106 void “subapertures”. Focusing is achieved with no other optical element: the shape and positioning of the subapertures (holes in the foil) is responsible for beam combining by diffraction, and 5 % to 10 % of the total incident light ends up into a sharp focus. The consequence of this high number of subapertures is high dynamic range images. In addition, as it uses only a combination of vacuum and opaque material, this focussing method is potentially efficient over a very broad wavelength domain. The focal length of such diffractive focussing devices is wavelength dependent. However, this can be corrected. We have tested optically the efficiency of the chromatism correction on artificial sources (500 < λ < 750 nm) : the images are diffraction limited, and the dynamic range measured on an artificial double source reaches 6. 2 10 ‑ 6.
