40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{the sum of}} <b>squares</b> <b>in</b> linear {{regression}} is reduced to sum of <b>squares</b> <b>in</b> semi-parametric regression. We indicated that different sums of <b>squares</b> <b>in</b> the {{linear regression}} are similar to various deviance statements in semi-parametric regression. In addition to, coefficient of the determination derived in linear regression model is easily generalized to coefficient of {{the determination of the}} semi-parametric regression model. Then, it is made an application in order to support the theory of the linear regression and semi-parametric regression. In this way, study is supported with a simulated data example...|$|R

5|$|Freedom Square {{was located}} {{on the corner of}} Victoria and Morris Streets. It was famous in the 1950s for the {{political}} meetings held there.
