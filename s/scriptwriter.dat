5|$|Cartier became {{involved}} in the film industry in 1929, when he successfully submitted a script to a company based in Berlin, Germany. He then became a staff <b>scriptwriter</b> for UFA Studios, the primary German film company of the era, for which he worked on crime films and thrillers. While at UFA, he worked with noted writers, directors and producers including Ewald André Dupont and Erich Pommer. In 1933 he became a film director, overseeing the thriller Unsichtbare Gegner for producer Sam Spiegel.|$|E

Arai and Yonesaka returned respectively as director and <b>scriptwriter.</b> Takahashi provided the scenario draft and supervised the writing. Episode III released in 2006 in Japan and North America. Episode III was the last game released in the Xenosaga series.|$|E
50|$|<b>Scriptwriters</b> and {{directors}} of Korean dramas are often {{as well known}} as actors are. An overwhelming majority of <b>scriptwriters</b> (90% according to the Beijing Metro Reader) are women, who not only write love stories but action series as well. Compared to Korean cinema, television is more appealing for <b>scriptwriters</b> as contract conditions are better, acknowledgment is greater, and the salary is higher.|$|R

5|$|In 1977, Vargas Llosa {{was elected}} {{as a member}} of the Peruvian Academy of Language, a {{membership}} he still holds today. That year, he also published Aunt Julia and the <b>Scriptwriter</b> (La tía Julia y el escribidor), based in part on his marriage to his first wife, Julia Urquidi, to whom he dedicated the novel. She later wrote a memoir, Lo que Varguitas no dijo (What Little Vargas Didn't Say), in which she gives her personal account of their relationship. She states that Vargas Llosa's account exaggerates many negative points in their courtship and marriage while minimizing her role of assisting his literary career. Aunt Julia and the <b>Scriptwriter</b> is considered one of the most striking examples of how the language and imagery of popular culture can be used in literature. The novel was adapted in 1990 into a Hollywood feature film, Tune in Tomorrow.|$|E
5|$|In January or February 1939, Metzger, now a <b>scriptwriter</b> for Terra Filmkunst, {{mentioned}} his idea to Wolfgang Ebbecke {{with whom he}} was working on the script for Central Rio. Ebbecke shot down the idea, raising a number of objections including the fact that Mendes had already done a film on the same topic in England and the concern that German audiences might confuse the proposed film with Feuchtwanger's novel which was not antisemitic.|$|E
5|$|Sarah-Jane Abigail Lancashire {{was born}} on 10 October 1964 in Oldham, Lancashire.

5|$|Inspired by Super Mario 64, {{the team}} {{set out to}} create a 3D game that {{ultimately}} exceeded {{the capabilities of the}} platform. Along the way, the team changed its console focus from the Super Famicom to the Nintendo 64 and its 64DD expansion peripheral, for which the game was expected to be a 1998 launch title. Upon the commercial failure of the 64DD, the game was converted to the cartridge-only format. Itoi developed the game's concept during Mother 2 development and built a 12-chapter story with player-characters that rotated between chapters. Having been a producer during Mother 2, Itoi served as a <b>scriptwriter</b> during Mother 3 development.|$|E
5|$|Kurosawa {{entered the}} Japanese film {{industry}} in 1936, following a brief {{stint as a}} painter. After years of working on numerous films as an assistant director and <b>scriptwriter,</b> he made his debut as a director during World War II with the popular action film Sanshiro Sugata (a.k.a. Judo Saga). After the war, the critically acclaimed Drunken Angel (1948), in which Kurosawa cast then-unknown actor Toshiro Mifune in a starring role, cemented the director's {{reputation as one of}} the most important young filmmakers in Japan. The two men would go on to collaborate on another 15 films.|$|E
5|$|Pauline Fowler is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from the BBC soap opera EastEnders, a long-running serial drama about working class {{life in the}} fictional London borough of Walford. She was played by actress Wendy Richard between the first episode on 19 February 1985 and 25 December 2006. Pauline was created by <b>scriptwriter</b> Tony Holland and producer Julia Smith as one of EastEnders' original characters. She made her debut in the soap's first episode on 19 February 1985, and remained for twenty-one years and ten months, making her the second longest-running original character, surpassed only by her nephew, Ian Beale.|$|E

5|$|Vargas Llosa rose to fame in the 1960s with novels such as The Time of the Hero (La ciudad y los perros, {{literally}} The City and the Dogs, 1963/1966), The Green House (La casa verde, 1965/1968), and {{the monumental}} Conversation in the Cathedral (Conversación en la catedral, 1969/1975). He writes prolifically across {{an array of}} literary genres, including literary criticism and journalism. His novels include comedies, murder mysteries, historical novels, and political thrillers. Several, such as Captain Pantoja and the Special Service (1973/1978) and Aunt Julia and the <b>Scriptwriter</b> (1977/1982), have been adapted as feature films.|$|E
5|$|Alan Pattillo, a {{longtime}} <b>scriptwriter</b> and director for APF, was appointed the company's first official script editor in late 1964. This move was aimed {{to reduce the}} burden on Gerry Anderson who, while reserving his producer's right to overall creative control, had grown weary of revising scripts himself. Direction of episodes was assigned in pairs: veterans Pattillo and David Elliott alternated with the less-experienced Desmond Saunders and newcomer David Lane for each month's filming. Due to the difficulties of setting up takes, progress was slow: even on a productive day, it was rare for the crew to complete more than two minutes of puppet footage. In a contemporary interview, Hill noted that Thunderbirds contained several times as many shots as a typical live-action series. He explained that rapid editing was necessary {{on account of the}} characters' lack of facial expression, which made it difficult to sustain the viewer's interest {{for more than a few}} seconds per shot.|$|E
5|$|Asher {{broke off}} the {{engagement}} in early 1968, after {{coming back from}} an acting assignment in Bristol to find McCartney in bed with another woman, Francie Schwartz. McCartney and Asher later attempted to mend their relationship, but finally broke up in July1968. Asher has consistently refused to publicly discuss {{that part of her}} life. Schwartz, a twenty three year old New York <b>scriptwriter,</b> had travelled to London trying to interest Apple Corps in a film script. Schwartz was then asked by McCartney to move into his Cavendish Avenue house, and was given a job working for Derek Taylor at Apple, which was then based in Wigmore Street, London. She attended many sessions during the recording of the White Album, and was living with McCartney when Lennon and Yoko Ono were also invited to live there. Shortly after, Schwartz sold the story of her time at Cavendish Avenue to Rolling Stone magazine.|$|E

5|$|Digital Devil Saga began {{development}} pre-2002 under the working title New Goddess. The game's concept and original draft {{were written by}} Japanese author Yu Godai, but she withdrew from the project for personal reasons, {{and was replaced by}} Atlus <b>scriptwriter</b> Tadashi Satomi. The gameplay concept of the characters transforming into demons was based on an unused idea for Shin Megami Tensei. The second game {{began development}} immediately after the first, with the main development effort going into refining and improving the gameplay. While their commercial performances varied, both games were praised by critics for their story, graphics and gameplay. Since release, the game has inspired a mobile prequel, and Godai wrote a series of novels based on her original premise for the story.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 1970s {{developments}} {{were reported}} on the project under the name James Bond of the Secret Service, but when producer Jack Schwartzman became involved and cleared a number of the legal issues that still surrounded the project he brought on board <b>scriptwriter</b> Lorenzo Semple, Jr. to work on the screenplay. Connery was unhappy with some aspects of the work and asked Tom Mankiewicz, who had rewritten Diamonds Are Forever, to work on the script; however, Mankiewicz declined as he felt he was under a moral obligation to Cubby Broccoli. Connery then hired British television writers Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais to undertake re-writes, although they went uncredited for their efforts because of a restriction by the Writers Guild of America.|$|E
5|$|When Broccoli and Saltzman {{bought the}} rights to {{existing}} and future Fleming titles, it did not include Casino Royale, which had already been sold to producer Gregory Ratoff, with the story having been adapted for television in 1954. After Ratoff's death, the rights were passed on to Charles K. Feldman, who subsequently produced the satirical Bond spoof Casino Royale in 1967. A legal case ensured that the film rights to the novel Thunderball were held by Kevin McClory as he, Fleming and <b>scriptwriter</b> Jack Whittingham had written a film script upon which the novel was based. Although Eon Productions and McClory joined forces to produce Thunderball, McClory still retained {{the rights to}} the story and adapted Thunderball into 1983's Never Say Never Again. The current distribution rights to both of those films are held by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, the studio which distributes Eon's regular series.|$|E

5|$|In 1992, Cecil and Noirin Carmody {{met with}} Sean Brennan, then-head of {{publishing}} at Virgin Interactive, and spoke {{about how the}} Knights Templar would make an ideal subject to base a game on. Later, Virgin agreed to issue the game. In a September 1992 interview for French magazine Génération 4, Charles Cecil stated that he had begun working on a scenario for Revolution's third game, after 1992's Lure of the Temptress and 1994's then-upcoming Beneath a Steel Sky. The game would be set in Paris with a Templar story line. The following month, Cecil visited Paris to research the Templars; after reading The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail, he was certain there was enough known about the Templars to make them a good subject for a game. Cecil, Dave Cummins, and Jonathan Howard began work on the story and design. Cecil and Cummins attended a film-writing course and their script was read by Alan Drury, a senior BBC <b>scriptwriter</b> and dramatist. Revolution artist Steve Ince created initial location sketches for the game before working on Beneath a Steel Sky. He was promoted to producer halfway through the project.|$|E
5|$|On 14 November 2007, it was {{announced}} that former EastEnders <b>scriptwriter</b> Tony Jordan had been contacted by Controller of BBC Drama Production John Yorke with an idea for an episode and that Jordan had returned to EastEnders having written the script for the episode. The single-hander episode {{was announced}} the next day, the first episode of any soap opera to feature just one character. Jordan had wanted to write a solo episode for EastEnders – well known for its two-hander episodes – for some time, but the opportunity had never arisen until Bardon had a stroke in real life, which was reflected in storyines when Jim was said to have suffered a stroke when visiting relatives off screen. Cast and crew were grateful for the opportunity to make the episode but were aware it had come about due to the suffering of somebody they loved. Brown was initially sceptical that her character could carry an entire episode by herself, but stated that Dot has a lot of history so there was a lot to call upon.|$|E
5|$|The {{works of}} Mario Vargas Llosa {{are viewed as}} both modernist and postmodernist novels. Though {{there is still much}} debate over the {{differences}} between modernist and postmodernist literature, literary scholar M. Keith Booker claims that the difficulty and technical complexity of Vargas Llosa's early works, such as The Green House and Conversation in the Cathedral, are clearly elements of the modern novel. Furthermore, these earlier novels all carry a certain seriousness of attitude—another important defining aspect of modernist art. By contrast, his later novels such as Captain Pantoja and the Special Service, Aunt Julia and the <b>Scriptwriter,</b> The Real Life of Alejandro Mayta, and The Storyteller (El hablador) appear to follow a postmodernist mode of writing. These novels have a much lighter, farcical, and comic tone, characteristics of postmodernism. Comparing two of Vargas Llosa's novels, The Green House and Captain Pantoja and the Special Service, Booker discusses the contrast between modernism and postmodernism found in the writer's works: while both novels explore the theme of prostitution as well as the workings of the Peruvian military, Booker points out that the former is gravely serious whereas the latter is ridiculously comic.|$|E
