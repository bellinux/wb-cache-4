25|$|In June 2013, the University of Maine {{made history}} with its VolturnUS 1:8, a 65-foot-tall {{floating}} turbine prototype that is 1:8th {{the scale of}} a 6-megawatt (MW), 450-foot rotor diameter design. VolturnUS 1:8 was the first grid-connected offshore wind turbine deployed in the Americas. The VolturnUS design utilizes a concrete <b>semisubmersible</b> floating hull and a composite materials tower designed to reduce both capital and Operation & Maintenance costs, and to allow local manufacturing throughout the US and the World. The VolturnUS technology {{is the culmination of}} collaborative research and development conducted by the University of Maine-led DeepCwind Consortium. U.S. Senators Susan Collins and Angus King announced in June 2016 that Maine’s New England Aqua Ventus I floating offshore wind demonstration project, designed by the DeepCwind Consortium, has been selected by the U.S. Department of Energy to participate in the Offshore Wind Advanced Technology Demonstration program.|$|E

50|$|The Troll B Platform is a semi-submersible {{designed}} by Doris and fabricated from concrete; {{thought to be}} the only concrete <b>semisubmersible.</b> This platform came into production in 1995.|$|E
5000|$|In 1999, Cal Dive International {{approached}} Bennett & Associates {{to complete}} the basic design (and later the detailed design) of a <b>semisubmersible.</b> In 2000, Richard Michel from Bennett & Associates and William Strong of Cal Dive jointly presented a paper at the Offshore Technology Conference showcasing {{the capabilities of the}} [...] "Quantum 4000" [...] (or Q4000). The <b>semisubmersible</b> was delivered in 2002. In 2010, the Q4000 was one of the auxiliary drilling platforms supporting the well containment efforts during the Deepwater Horizon incident. It retrieved the failed BOP from the well for further investigation.|$|E
50|$|Since 1993, RRDA {{engineers}} have contracted HECSALV software to model more than 2,000 vessels including floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) units, tankers, bulk carriers, gas carriers, <b>semisubmersibles</b> and spars classed {{by the major}} classification societies. Teams have responded to more than 180 worldwide incidents ranging from tank explosions, groundings, collisions and fires to minor structural damage, flooding, trimming to replace stern seals, emergency drydockings and structural evaluation with missing structure in repair situations.|$|R
50|$|From {{the late}} 1970s the yard focused {{mainly on the}} {{offshore}} industry. Thus, the company designed, constructed and delivered 14 <b>semisubmersibles</b> from its facilities in Gothenburg. Seven units of the GVA series have also been built by yards all over the world, in different sizes and for various requirements. The units built at the yard in Gothenburg were adapted for duties such as production, drilling, diving support and accommodation/service. The deliveries included six Pacesetter type units and eight GVA designs.|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} types of facilities from which offshore drilling operations take place. These include bottom founded drilling rigs (jackup barges and swamp barges), combined drilling and production facilities either bottom founded or floating platforms, and deepwater mobile offshore drilling units (MODU) including semi-submersibles and drillships. These are capable of operating in water depths up to 3000 m. In shallower waters the mobile units are anchored to the seabed, however in deeper water (more than 1500 m the <b>semisubmersibles</b> or drillships are maintained at the required drilling location using dynamic positioning.|$|R
50|$|These estimations are {{conservative}} and for large ships/rigs they may deviate significantly from reality.A {{plot of the}} dynamic factor versus significant wave height for a crane mounted on a <b>semisubmersible</b> and lifting from supply boat is shown above to the right.|$|E

30|$|The sample-based ViBe {{algorithm}} performs {{significantly better}} than the parametric methods we applied to our test sequences, which is particularly interesting given its complete lack of prior assumptions regarding the scene. In rough seas, the method performs less ideally due to the great similarity between waves and target. While the algorithm could be adapted to incorporate these waves into the background model, this would not allow it to detect targets at thermal equilibrium with the ocean. On the other hand, the algorithm would be exceptionally fit to the detection of targets radiating at a different temperature than the surface, such as swimmers, shipwreckees, small boats, or a <b>semisubmersible's</b> exhaust.|$|R
5000|$|During {{the last}} years of her career as an Assistant U.S. Attorney, Klapper was the lead prosecutor, working with ICE and DEA agents {{domestically}} in New York, Tampa, and Colombia, Mexico and Argentina, of the Luis Caicedo Organization. Klapper and the agents identified, obtained indictments of and convicted the entire hierarchy of this organization, from its leaders to its suppliers, transporters and money laundering, thereby dismantling an organization that became known as the Super Cartel because of the staggering quantity of cocaine it exported to the United States and Europe. Conservative estimates are that this organization sent approximately 800,000 kilograms of cocaine from Colombia to the U.S. and laundered approximately $4 billion during a six-year period. Over 20 individuals were convicted, approximately $173 million in drug money was seized, approximately 3,800 kilos was seized, and several fast boast and <b>semisubmersibles</b> were seized.

40|$|As {{the search}} for oil in the Gulf of Mexico (GoM) moves into deeper waters, {{floating}} platforms such as <b>semisubmersibles</b> are in increasing demand. As semi-submersibles increase in size, the effect of vortex-induced motions (VIMs) becomes a significant problem in their design. VIMs stem from transverse forces caused by the current affecting the platform, with vortexes moving downstream {{on either side of}} the structure. The loop/eddy current phenomenon in the GoM leads to a constant current being present in the area, with speeds of up to 1. 8 m/s. The accurate prediction of the vertical and transverse motions of semi-submersibles is crucial for the design of the riser systems. It is therefore beneficial to investigate the hydrodynamic forces acting on the geometry, and means of reducing these forces. A common method of reducing transverse forces is the addition of column appendages, such as helical strakes. In this paper, full-scale computational fluid dynamic analyses are carried out to examine the transverse forces caused by this vortex shedding using realistic current velocities in the GoM. Helical strakes are attached to the geometry to break up the coherence of the vortex shedding and the performance of these strakes is investigated numerically...|$|R

These standards cover mobile offshore drilling units (such as jackup rigs, <b>semisubmersible</b> rigs, and drill ships), floating offshore production installations (spars, tension leg platforms, semisubmersibles and FPSOs/FSOs), fixed offshore installations, pipelines, risers, and single point moorings.|$|E
40|$|Internal waves {{near the}} ocean surface have been {{observed}} {{in many parts of}} the world including the Andaman Sea, Sulu Sea and South China Sea. The factors that cause and propagate these large-amplitude waves include bathymetry, density stratification and ocean currents. Although their effects on floating drilling platforms and their riser systems have not been extensively studied, in the past these waves have seriously disrupted offshore exploration and drilling operations. In particular, a drill pipe was ripped from the Blow-Out Preventer (BOP) and lost during drilling operations in the Andaman Sea. Drilling riser damages were also reported from the South China Sea and other places. The motivations of this study were to find a valid numerical model conforming to the physics of internal waves and to study the effects on offshore drilling <b>semisubmersibles,</b> different types of offshore hull forms and riser systems, including the large diameter cold water pipe of floating Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) systems. The influence of internal waves on offshore systems was studied through nonlinear fully coupled time-domain analysis. The numerical model was implemented in a coupled analysis program where the hull, moorings and riser were considered an integrated system. The program HARP was modified and then utilized to study the effects of the internal wave on the platform global motions and riser system integrity. The study could be useful as future guidance for offshore exploration and operations in areas where the internal wave phenomenon is prominent...|$|R
