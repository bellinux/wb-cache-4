5|$|CryoSat-2 {{was built}} as a {{replacement}} for CryoSat-1, whose Rokot carrier rocket was unable to achieve orbit, resulting in the loss of the satellite. Compared to its predecessor, CryoSat-2 features <b>software</b> <b>upgrades,</b> greater battery capacity and an updated instrument package. Its main instrument is an interferometric radar range-finder with twin antennas, which measures the height difference between the upper surface of floating ice and surrounding water. This is often known as 'free-board'.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, the F-22 was {{upgraded}} with {{a backup}} oxygen system, <b>software</b> <b>upgrades</b> and oxygen sensors {{to address the}} frequent oxygen deprivation issues and normalize operations. In 2013, the faulty flight vest valves were replaced and altitude restrictions lifted; distance restrictions will be lifted once a backup oxygen system is installed. In April 2014, the USAF stated in Congressional testimony that installation of automatic backup oxygen systems on the F-22 fleet would be completed within twelve months.|$|E

25|$|On 16 September 2013, the CS100 {{made its}} maiden flight from Mirabel Airport. Over 14,000 data points were {{gathered}} on this first flight, and after some reconfigurations and <b>software</b> <b>upgrades,</b> the aircraft flew {{for the second}} time on 1 October 2013. On 16 January 2014, the planned entry-into-service date was delayed again, due to difficulties with certification flight testing, by at least 12 months, to the second half of 2015; the CS300 was still to follow approximately six months after the CS100.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to periodic <b>software</b> <b>upgrades</b> {{and the introduction}} of new radar-absorbent materials across the fleet, the B-2 has had several major upgrades to its avionics and combat systems. For battlefield communications, both Link-16 and a high frequency satellite link have been installed, compatibility with various new munitions has been undertaken, and the AN/APQ-181 radar's operational frequency was shifted in order to avoid interference with other operator's equipment. The arrays of the upgraded radar features were entirely replaced to make the AN/APQ-181 into an active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar.|$|E
25|$|A further {{major upgrade}} {{programme}} from the GR7 standard was conducted; the Harrier GR9. The GR9 was developed via the Joint Update and Maintenance Programme (JUMP), which significantly upgraded the Harrier fleet's avionics, communications systems, and weapons capabilities during scheduled periods of maintenance in an incremental manner. The {{first of these}} increments started with <b>software</b> <b>upgrades</b> to the communications, ground proximity warning and navigation systems, followed by {{the integration of the}} AGM-65 Maverick air-to-ground missile. Capability C added the RAF's Rangeless Airborne Instrumentation Debriefing System (RAIDS), Raytheon's Successor Identification Friend or Foe (SIFF) system and the Paveway guided bombs. The Digital Joint Reconnaissance Pod (DJRP) was added as part of Capability D.|$|E

25|$|Although Cisco was not {{the first}} company to develop and sell {{dedicated}} network nodes, {{it was one of the}} first to sell commercially successful routers supporting multiple network protocols. Classical, CPU-based architecture of early Cisco devices coupled with flexibility of operating system IOS allowed for keeping up with evolving technology needs by means of frequent <b>software</b> <b>upgrades.</b> Some popular models of that time (such as Cisco 2500) managed to stay in production for almost a decade virtually unchanged—a rarity in high-tech industry. Although Cisco was strongly rooted in the enterprise environment, the company was quick to capture the emerging service provider environment, entering the SP market with new, high-capacity product lines such as Cisco 7000 and Cisco 8500.|$|E
25|$|Android's {{source code}} is {{released}} by Google under an open source license, although most Android devices ultimately ship {{with a combination}} of free and open source and proprietary software, including proprietary software required for accessing Google services. Android is popular with technology companies that require a ready-made, low-cost and customizable operating system for high-tech devices. Its open nature has encouraged a large community of developers and enthusiasts to use the open-source code as a foundation for community-driven projects, which deliver updates to older devices, add new features for advanced users or bring Android to devices originally shipped with other operating systems. The extensive variation of hardware in Android devices causes significant delays for <b>software</b> <b>upgrades,</b> with new versions of the operating system and security patches typically taking months before reaching consumers, or sometimes not at all. The success of Android has made it a target for patent and copyright litigation between technology companies.|$|E

It also improves the radar's existing computer with a new high-reliability multi-processor and rewrites the software to facilitate future maintenance and enhancements. [...] The RSIP kit, built principally by Northrop Grumman Electronic Systems, Baltimore, MD, under a subcontract to Boeing, consists of a new radar computer, a radar control maintenance panel as well as <b>software</b> <b>upgrades</b> to the radar and mission system programs.|$|E
2500|$|The Eurofighter {{operates}} automatic Emission Controls (EMCON) {{to reduce}} the Electro-Magnetic emissions of the current CAPTOR mechanically scanned Radar. The Captor-M has three working channels, one intended for classification of jammer and for jamming suppression. A succession of radar <b>software</b> <b>upgrades</b> have enhanced the air-to-air capability of the Captor-M radar. [...] These upgrades have included the R2P programme (initially UK only, and known as T2P when 'ported' to the Tranche 2 aircraft) which is being followed by R2Q/T2Q. R2P was applied to eight German Typhoons deployed on Red Flag Alaska in 2012.|$|E
2500|$|Optical Supervisory Channel (OSC). This is {{data channel}} which uses an {{additional}} wavelength usually outside the EDFA amplification band (at 1,510nm, 1,620nm, 1,310nm or another proprietary wavelength). The OSC carries {{information about the}} multi-wavelength optical signal as well as remote conditions at the optical terminal or EDFA site. It is also normally used for remote <b>software</b> <b>upgrades</b> and user (i.e., network operator) Network Management information. It is the multi-wavelength analogue to SONET's DCC (or supervisory channel). ITU standards suggest that the OSC should utilize an OC-3 signal structure, though some vendors have opted to use 100 megabit Ethernet or another signal format. [...] Unlike the 1550nm multi-wavelength signal containing client data, the OSC is always terminated at intermediate amplifier sites, where it receives local information before re-transmission.|$|E

2500|$|An {{issue that}} affects all the {{international}} {{partners in the}} F-35 involves access to the computer software codes for the aircraft. The F-35 relies heavily on software for operation of radar, weapons, flight controls and also maintenance. The US military has stated that [...] "no country involved {{in the development of}} the jets will have access to the software codes" [...] and has indicated that all <b>software</b> <b>upgrades</b> will be done in the US. The US government acknowledges that Australia, Britain, Canada, Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway and Turkey have all expressed dissatisfaction with that unilateral US decision. The UK specifically indicated they might cancel its entire order of F-35s without access to the coding, without which the nation will be unable to maintain its own aircraft. Allen Sens, a defence analyst at the University of British Columbia stated in November 2009: [...] "What has happened is really quite unusual because we're talking about some of America's very close allies. You would have thought they could build in some maintenance codes that could be accessible to their allies." [...] Sens indicated that the decision could be as a result of concerns about software security and also pressure from Congress to protect jobs in the US.|$|E
