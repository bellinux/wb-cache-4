25|$|Every day {{she begged}} {{to be able}} to enter a temple and become a nun instead of marrying. Her father {{eventually}} allowed her to work in the temple, but asked the monks to give her the toughest chores in order to discourage her. The monks forced Miaoshan to work all day and all night while others slept in order to finish her work. However, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> good person that the animals living around the temple began to help her with her chores. Her father, seeing this, became so frustrated that he attempted to burn down the temple. Miaoshan put out the fire with her bare hands and suffered no burns. Now struck with fear, her father ordered her to be put to death.|$|E
25|$|Madhubala {{was quite}} another matter. I {{knew she was}} very sick even before I married her. But a promise is a promise. So I kept my word and brought her home as my wife, even though I knew she was dying from a {{congenital}} heart problem. For 9 long years I nursed her. I watched her die before my own eyes. You can never understand what this means until you live through this yourself. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> beautiful woman and she died so painfully. She would rave and rant and scream in frustration. How can such an active person spend 9 long years bed-ridden? And I had to humour her all the time. That's what the doctor asked me to. That's what I did till her very last breath. I would laugh with her. I would cry with her.|$|E

500|$|Jackson {{describes}} Lena Horne as {{a profound}} inspiration, for entertainers of several generations {{as well as}} herself.

It's 27 years later. And I have to say, I love Lydia Deetz so much. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> huge part of me. I would be really interested in what she is doing 27 years later." [...] Ryder confirmed that she would only consider making a sequel if Burton and Keaton were involved. In December 2014, Burton stated, [...] "It's a character that I love and I miss actually working with Michael. There's only one Betelgeuse. We're working on a script and I think it's probably closer than ever and I'd love to work with him again." [...] In January 2015, writer Grahame-Smith told Entertainment Weekly that the script was finished and that he and Burton intended to start filming Beetlejuice 2 {{by the end of the}} year, and that both Keaton and Ryder would return in their respective roles. In August 2015, on Late Night with Seth Meyers, Ryder confirmed she would be reprising her role in the sequel. In May 2016, Burton stated, [...] "It's something that I really would like to do in the right circumstances, but it's one of those films where it has to be right. It's not a kind of a movie that cries out , it's not the Beetlejuice trilogy. So it's something that if the elements are right—because I do love the character and Michael's amazing as that character, so yeah we'll see. But there's nothing concrete yet." ...|$|E

2500|$|The first {{eleven years}} of Indira's {{position}} {{as prime minister}} saw her evolving from the perception of party leaders to the one with iron resolve to split the party for her policy positions or {{to go to war}} with Pakistan to liberate Bangladesh.

Second unit director Peter Medak said Welch [...] "was {{at that time}} quite inexperienced, exactly {{like one of those}} American drum majorettes. But she tried very hard and went to see the rushes each day, gradually improving. 'Who's this dumb broad?' people used to say. But I said: 'You wait. I'll bet she makes it.' I liked her very much because <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> genuine person. And she had a beautiful body which always helps." [...] Welch said her role was [...] "a blown up Barbie doll." [...] Reviewing her performance, the Los Angeles Times film critic said that [...] "each new Raquel Welch picture brings further proof that when Maria Montez died they didn't break the mold. Like Maria, Raquel can't act from here to there, but both ladies seem to have been born to be photographed... this sappiest of spy pictures." ...|$|E
