5|$|A {{very active}} trough of low {{pressure}} persisted along the equator {{in the middle}} of November, with westerly surface winds and windspread convection located along the trough from 140° W to 140° E. An organized circulation developed near Palmyra Atoll on November 18, and steadily developed as it drifted westward.

The storm tracked slowly northward after forming and initially remained a weak tropical storm.
