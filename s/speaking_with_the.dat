The case has been cold for three months, but he is made to feel guilty by his partner Bolander (Ned Beatty) into reexamining it. Munch makes no progress after <b>speaking</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> family and reexamining notes. Based on witness accounts of a man with long blond hair and a black car, Munch spends all night looking through suspect photos until he finds a man with a black car with front end damage and long black hair, but blond eyebrows. Munch and Bolander question him, believing the suspect (Joe Hansard) to have dyed his hair to change his appearance after killing the woman.

On both occasions, instead of giving the documents to the Prime Minister, as he was not party to the treaty agreements, they were handed by the chiefs to the Queen, who, after <b>speaking</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> First Nations representatives, then passed the list and letter to Chrétien for him and the other ministers of the Crown to address and advise the Queen or her viceroy on how to proceed.|$|E
