5|$|Later {{on in the}} day, Mary Margaret finds a dove in {{the forest}} trapped in some wire mesh. The town vet (Kwesi Ameyew) at the shelter where David works tells her the bird will be okay but only if she returns to her flock. David offers to help Mary Margaret return the dove but she declines. He follows her anyway {{and is able to}} save her from falling off a cliff. It starts to pour so the two take shelter in an empty cabin. David asks Mary Margaret what is wrong and she admits she still has {{feelings}} for him, and he is the reason she goes to Granny's at 7:15. David replies that he goes to Granny's to see her. They nearly kiss but Mary Margaret stops it because she knows about Kathryn's pregnancy test. David explains that his feelings for Kathryn are memories but his feelings for Mary Margaret are real. <b>She</b> <b>says</b> <b>they</b> have to forget each other.|$|E
25|$|However, {{there is}} {{disagreement}} {{about whether it}} marked a permanent change in values. Cowie and Salvatore in 2008 {{argued that it was}} a response to depression and did not mark a commitment to a welfare state because America has always been too individualistic. MacLean rejected the idea of a definitive political culture. <b>She</b> <b>says</b> <b>they</b> overemphasized individualism and ignored the enormous power that big capital wields, the Constitutional restraints on radicalism, and the role of racism, antifeminism, and homophobia. She warns that accepting Cowie and Salvatore's argument that conservatism's ascendancy is inevitable would dismay and discourage activists on the left. Klein responds that the New Deal did not die a natural death; it was killed off in the 1970s by a business coalition mobilized by such groups as the Business Roundtable, the Chamber of Commerce, trade organizations, conservative think tanks, and decades of sustained legal and political attacks.|$|E
500|$|Magali Cornier Michael criticises {{this reading}} of the text, saying that the novel's {{overwhelming}} reliance on male perspectives on women and feminism prevents the novel from meeting feminist objectives. Similarly, Michelle Phillips Buchberger argues that The French Lieutenant's Woman, along with Fowles' two earlier novels The Collector (1963) and The Magus (1965), proclaimed a [...] "pseudo-feminism" [...] while advocating some feminist ideas; but, <b>she</b> <b>says,</b> <b>they</b> are permeated by a [...] "fetishism [...] perpetuates the idea of woman as 'other'". Alice Ferrebe also notes that, despite Fowles' attempts to critique masculine values, his novels remain male fantasies demonstrative of the [...] "compromises and contradictions" [...] created by the gendered situation {{in which he was}} writing. Other literary critics, such as William Palmer, Peter Conradi, Bruce Woodcock and Pamela Cooper, have also critiqued Fowles' claims to a feminist perspective and representation.|$|E

2500|$|Heading for the Wall, Bran {{speaks to}} Jojen Reed while Osha and Hodor set up camp. Osha {{continues}} to grow suspicious of the Reeds, calling Jojen's visions [...] "black magic". When <b>she</b> <b>says</b> <b>they</b> {{have to continue to}} the Wall, Jojen reveals that the three-eyed raven is north of the Wall, and that is their destination. Osha refuses to allow them to go north of the Wall, relating to them the story of her husband's death and resurrection as a wight.|$|E
2500|$|A {{contemporary}} {{source of}} inspiration was Collins' recent fascination with reality television programs. <b>She</b> <b>says</b> <b>they</b> are like The Hunger Games because the Games are not just entertainment but also a reminder to the districts of their rebellion. On a tired night, Collins says that while she was channel-surfing the television, she saw people competing for some prize and then saw footage of the Iraq war. She described how the two combined in an [...] "unsettling way" [...] to create her first ideas for the series.|$|E

2500|$|The {{third season}} begins with Grayson proposing to Jules {{in the season}} premier. With {{the help of the}} Cul-de-sac Crew, Grayson tricks Jules into being less {{predictable}} in her day-to-day life, but when she fails, Grayson is able to plan ahead and propose to her outside at night under a teepee'd tree. The season follows {{the ups and downs of}} their engagement, including their many trips to a new psychiatrist (played by guest star Nicole Sullivan). Laurie guilts Jules into letting her be Co-Maid of Honor (Co-Mo's!) with Ellie, much to Ellie's dismay. Travis gets into a skateboarding accident while being pulled by Dog Travis, and goes into the hospital. His injury causes him to wear a helmet for six episodes. Laurie falls for a guy via Twitter, a soldier from Iraq named Wade. Meanwhile, Bobby falls for Travis photography professor Angie (recurring guest star Sarah Chalke). In [...] "A One Story Town", Jules and the gang decide Bobby needs help with Angie so they start [...] "operation kiss-the-girl". With help from Ted and his a'capella group, they pull it off and Bobby and Angie get together. (This episode also signifies a special Scrubs cast reunion including: Christa Miller, Sarah Chalke, Bob Clendenin, Ken Jenkins, Sam Lloyd, Robert Maschio, and Zach Braff). One of Grayson's old hookups, Holly, returns with news that Grayson is the father of her baby. Although Jules is extremely upset at first, she comes to terms with the fact that baby girl Tampa will be in Grayson's life from now on. Bobby soon finds out that Angie is cheating on him, although <b>she</b> <b>says</b> <b>they</b> never agreed to be exclusive, and they break up. Ellie's mom is introduced, and no one will believ Ellie when she tries to tell the crew that her mother is a sociopath. When a hurricane strikes Gulfhaven, Travis and Laurie get closer than ever when Laurie can't decide what to do about her army boyfriend Wade. Although he has feelings for her, Travis wants to see Laurie happy, so he tells her to try to make it work with Wade. [...] The hurricane destroys Grayson's house, causing him to move in with Jules. Grayson wants his and Jules's relationship to be more private and suggests that they elope to Napa, but Jules invites the whole group. While there, Travis and Laurie almost kiss but are interrupted when her boyfriend Wade comes back from Iraq to see her. The night of Travis's 21st birthday he gets drunk, strips, and tells Laurie that he has feelings for her and she is being unfair to him. Because Grayson's daughter isn't with them, Jules and Grayson decide not to elope, instead getting married on the beach near their home, but because beach weddings aren't legal there, it becomes a wedding on the go, and they walk down the beach as they say their vows.|$|E

6000|$|There {{are many}} Christies, willing to work, yet unable {{to bear the}} contact with coarser natures which makes labor seem degrading, or to endure the hard {{struggle}} for the bare necessities of life when life has lost all that makes it beautiful. People wonder when such as <b>she</b> <b>say</b> <b>they</b> can find little to do; but to those who know nothing of the pangs of pride, the sacrifices of feeling, the martyrdoms of youth, love, hope, and ambition that go on under the faded cloaks of these poor gentle-women, who tell them to go into factories, or scrub in kitchens, for there is work enough for all, the most convincing answer would be, [...] "Try it." ...|$|R
