40|$|Rapid {{changes in}} the total solar {{irradiance}} from space borne sensors are {{largely due to the}} passage of large sunspots across the disk. The effect of sunspots has often been modeled, using ground-based observations, by the use of a <b>sunspot</b> <b>index</b> such as the PSI, which assumes that all sunspots have the same thermal structure, which remains constant with time. In this paper, we report on photometric observations of sunspot groups that show significant differences in their mean bolometric contrast (up to a factor of 2) and some of which show cooling or warming during their disk transit. Most of these changes can be ascribed to the changing ratio of umbral-to-prenumbral area. By measuring the mean temperature or bolometric contrast, together with corrected (hemispherical) areas, we can determine the instantaneous solar luminosity fluctuation and its diurnal change due to individual sunspot groups.

As we showed in previous papers, dispersions of sunspot latitude distributions are tightly related to <b>sunspot</b> <b>indices,</b> so we can estimate the level of solar activity in this epoch by a method which is not based on direct calculation of sunspots and is weakly affected by loss of observational data. The latitude distributions of sunspots in the time of transition from the Maunder minimum to the common regime of solar activity proved to be wide enough. It gives evidences in favor of, first, not very low cycle No. - 3 (1712 - 1723) with the Wolf number in maximum W= 100 ± 50, and, second, nonzero activity in the maximum of cycle No. - 4 (1700 - 1711) W= 60 ± 45. Therefore, the latitude distributions in the end of the Maunder minimum are in better agreement with the traditional Wolf number and new revisited indices of activity SN and GN than with the GSN; the latter provide much lower level of activity in this epoch.

The Schumann Resonance signal intensity is modulated and highly correlated with solar activity and the electron concentrations in the lowest layers of the ionosphere. The enhanced or weakened solar activity moves the level of the SR signal outside the normal homeostatic range and, through the Melatonin mechanism, causes health problems and enhanced death rates in large human populations.

40|$|Whether the Sun has {{significantly}} influenced the climate {{during the last}} century has been under extensive debates for almost two decades. Since the solar irradiance varies very little in a solar cycle, it is puzzling that some geophysical parameters show proportionally large variations which appear to be responding to the solar cycles. For example, variation in low altitude clouds is shown correlated with solar cycle, and the onset of Forbush decrease is shown correlated with {{the reduction of the}} vorticity area index. A possible sun-climate connection is that galactic cosmic rays modulated by solar activities influence cloud formation. In this paper, we apply wavelet transform to satellite and surface data to examine this hypothesis. Data analyzed include the time series for solar irradiance, <b>sunspots,</b> UV <b>index,</b> temperature, cloud coverage, and neutron counter measurements. The interactions among the elements in the Earth System under the external and internal forcings give out very complex signals. The periodicity of the forcings or signals could range widely.

The interrelationships of the timing characteristics of spotless days and their comparison with sunspot cycle parameters are explored, in some cases finding very strong correlations. Such is the case for the relationship between the minimum time between spotless days either side of a given solar maximum and the maximum time between spotless days either side in the previous solar minimum, with r = - 0. 91 and a p-value < 0. 001. However, the predictions for SC 24 or 23 made by other authors in previous works using the spotless days as a predictor of solar activity are not good since it has not been fulfilled.
