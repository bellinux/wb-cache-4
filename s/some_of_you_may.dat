2500|$|On 4 September 2008, it was {{announced}} via a MySpace blog post that Gareth Davies had left the band, {{to be replaced by}} Gavin Burrough (Hondo Maclean, Ghostlines, The Future). [...] "As <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>may</b> know, Gareth has been living in America {{for the past couple of}} years, and recently got married. Ultimately, the strain of travelling between continents has taken its toll and Gareth made the decision that it would be in the best interests of himself, his family and Funeral to leave the band. We totally respect and understand his choice, wish him all the best in his future and we thank him for being part of our lives for the past 6 years." [...] The first interview to surface with Burrough in the band appeared on the Rocklouder webzine in the week of the Memory and Humanity release. In the 24 January 2009 issue of Kerrang! magazine, it was stated that the band were currently filming the video for the third single off the album, Rules and Games. The single was released on 23 March 2009. They will also be going on tour with We Are the Ocean supporting to coincide with its release.|$|E

60|$|<b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> here <b>may</b> not {{understand}} this text at all. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>you,</b> perhaps, <b>may</b> misunderstand it; {{for it is}} not an easy one. Let us, then, begin, by finding out the meaning of each word in it; and, let us first see what is the meaning of the spirit of bondage unto fear. Bondage means slavery; and the spirit of bondage means the spirit which makes men look up to God as slaves do to their taskmaster. Now, a slave obeys his master from fear only; not from love or gratitude. He knows that his master is stronger than he is, and he dreads being beaten and punished by him; and therefore, he obeys him only by compulsion, not of his own good will. This is the spirit of bondage; the slavish, superstitious spirit in religion, into which all men fall, in proportion as they are mean, and sinful, and carnal, fond of indulging themselves, and bearing no love to God or right things. They know that God is stronger than they; they are afraid that God will take away comforts from them if they offend Him; they have been taught that He will cast them into endless torment if they offend Him; and, therefore, they are afraid to do wrong. They love what is wrong, and would like to do it; but they dare not, for fear of God's punishment. They do not really fear God; they only fear punishment, misfortune, death, and hell. That is better, perhaps, than no religion at all. But it is not the faith which WE ought to have.|$|R
