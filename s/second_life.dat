5|$|Comparatively, machinimists using pre-made virtual {{platforms}} like <b>Second</b> <b>Life</b> {{have indicated}} that their productions can be made quite successfully with no cost at all. Creators like Dutch director Chantal Harvey, producer of the 48 Hour Film Project Machinima sector, have created upwards of 200 films using the platform. Harvey's advocacy of the genre {{has resulted in the}} involvement of film director Peter Greenaway who served as a juror for the Machinima category and gave a keynote speech during the event.|$|E

5|$|Generally, {{companies}} want to retain creative {{control over their}} intellectual properties and are wary of fan-created works, like fan fiction. However, because machinima provides free marketing, they have avoided a response demanding strict copyright enforcement. In 2003, Linden Lab was praised for changing license terms to allow users to retain ownership of works created in its virtual world <b>Second</b> <b>Life.</b> Rooster Teeth initially tried to release Red vs. Blue unnoticed by Halos owners because they feared that any communication would force them to end the project. However, Microsoft, Bungie's parent company at the time, contacted the group shortly after episode 2, and allowed them to continue without paying licensing fees.|$|E
5|$|In 1006 Ælfheah succeeded Ælfric as Archbishop of Canterbury, taking Swithun's {{head with}} him as a relic for the new location. He went to Rome in 1007 to receive his pallium—symbol of his status as an archbishop—from Pope John XVIII, but was robbed during his journey. While at Canterbury he {{promoted}} the cult of Dunstan, ordering {{the writing of the}} <b>second</b> <b>Life</b> of Dunstan, which Adelard of Ghent composed between 1006 and 1011. He also introduced new practices into the liturgy, and was instrumental in the Witenagemot's recognition of Wulfsige of Sherborne as a saint in about 1012.|$|E
5|$|Since {{opening its}} first store in 1998, the NBA has seen {{increasing}} business opportunities in foreign markets mainly {{due to the}} influx of new international players. The biggest growth has been in China, where players Yao Ming and Yi Jianlian, combined with the interest generated by the 2008 Summer Olympics, created enough demand to open two new stores. The NBA has also expanded into games like <b>Second</b> <b>Life</b> where it created a virtual NBA Store in 2007.|$|E

5|$|Game {{developers}} {{have continued to}} increase support for machinima. Products such as Lionhead Studios' 2005 business simulation game The Movies, Linden Research's virtual world <b>Second</b> <b>Life,</b> and Bungie's 2007 first-person shooter Halo 3 encourage the creation of user content by including machinima software tools. Using The Movies, Alex Chan, a French resident with no previous filmmaking experience, took four days to create The French Democracy, a short political film about the 2005 civil unrest in France. Third-party mods like Garry's Mod usually offer the ability to manipulate characters {{and take advantage of}} custom or migrated content, allowing for the creation of works like Counter-Strike For Kids that can be filmed using multiple games.|$|E
5|$|Although the Larry O'Brien Trophy {{has been}} {{compared}} with the National Hockey League's (NHL) Stanley Cup, {{it has never been}} as prominent as the NHL trophy. To reduce this discrepancy, the NBA has been actively promoting the O'Brien Trophy in recent years to generate more recognition and an iconic status for the trophy. After the Detroit Pistons won the NBA Finals in 2004, the trophy was toured around the state of Michigan, marking the first time the trophy toured around the state of the winning team. In 2005, the NBA Legends Tour was launched in New York City. As part of the tour, the O’Brien Trophy was showcased in various cities—including those that were hosting the playoffs—for fans' autograph and photo sessions. It was escorted by many former players, including Julius Erving, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Bill Russell. In May 2007, the NBA unveiled the NBA Headquarters on <b>Second</b> <b>Life,</b> an Internet-based virtual reality environment. With this launch, fans could take pictures with the championship trophy in the virtual Toyota Larry O'Brien Trophy Room. In August, the trophy traveled to Hong Kong {{for the first time as}} part of the NBA Madness Asia Tour.|$|E
