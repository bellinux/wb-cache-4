5|$|On June 19, 2013, Microsoft {{announced}} (in {{response to}} the negative reaction) that it would reverse its changes to Xbox One's DRM and game licensing model. As with Xbox 360, users {{would be able to}} share and resell physical games without restrictions, and beyond a mandatory software update upon the console's initial <b>setup</b> <b>process</b> to enable playback of Blu-ray and DVD video, the console would not require a permanent internet connection to operate. These changes required the family sharing features, along with the ability to play games without their disc after installation, to be dropped. Xbox One chief product officer Marc Whitten stated that the family sharing feature may return in the future, but could not be implemented on launch due to time restraints. Don Mattrick, the then president of Microsoft's Interactive Entertainment Business, stated that the licensing changes were in {{response to the}} negative public reaction. Other analysts believed that the change was in direct response of Sony's aggressive position during its E3 press conference. Mattrick, who had been a leader in Xbox One development, announced his departure from Microsoft on July 1, 2013, to become CEO of Zynga. Analysts speculated that his departure was predicated on the poor response and subsequent reversal of the plans for Xbox One.|$|E

Though Windows XP did have limited accounts, the majority of home users did not change to an account type with fewer rights– partially due to the number of programs which unnecessarily required administrator rights– and so most home users ran as administrator all the time.|$|E
25|$|In 1993 Indigo {{launched}} the E-Print 1000 at IPEX trade show. The E-Print 1000 eliminated the expense and labor of the plate-printing <b>setup</b> <b>process,</b> printing {{directly from a}} computer file, and enabled inexpensive short-run color printing. Images not only could be readily changed, they could be changed from page to page, requiring neither additional setup or pauses in the print run. Instead of printing to metal plates, the E-Print created a latent image on the Photo Imaging Plate or PIP {{through the use of}} an electrostatic charge. This charged area would then attract the charged ElectroInk, which would in turn be transferred to the ITM or blanket, and then again transfer from the blanket to the paper or other substrate. Because 100% of the ink transfers from PIP to blanket to substrate, a different image and color could be printed with each rotation of the press. At the same time, Indigo's ElectroInk-based color inks offered print quality rivaling that of traditional printing processes. Almost 20 years later, and despite the numerous technological improvements, Indigo presses are still based on this core technology.|$|E

Famitsu rated the game 38 out of 40. Computer and Video Games Magazine {{noted that it}} was one of the most welcoming MMORPGs despite the cumbersome initial registration and setup. IGN called it a well done but unoriginal game and also noted that North American players were forced to play with already much more experienced Japanese players who had already completed the game's various quests. GameSpot criticized it at release for having an unconventional control system, a lengthy installation, and having no player versus player (PvP) aspects. Other elements receiving criticism include the EXP grind, which involves constant battles to access different parts of the game, and overcrowded camp sites. [...] The expansions have been mostly positively received, with praise for the amount of content added, but increasing signs that the graphics of the game are becoming outdated. IGN review of the Xbox 360 release was similar, noting that it was a large amount of game content, but had a protracted <b>setup</b> <b>process</b> and elements of the game design that require a large time investment. [...] It has also been noted that this game is the first to move in a wildly different direction while remaining in the main numbering line, as opposed to the Tactics and Crystal Chronicles games which became their own side series.|$|E

The build included minor UI changes, most notably improvements to the Media Center, new Aero and Aurora effects, a faster <b>setup</b> <b>process,</b> some new Sidebar gadgets, and slight improvements in overall performance and stability. Paint was also slightly improved, there's a new screenshot snapping/saving tool included, and a slightly redesigned Network Center.

40|$|Fixturing {{strategies}} {{during the}} {{different stages of}} manufacturing of a part strongly affect the final geometrical outcome on both part level and assembly level. Different manufacturing <b>setups,</b> <b>processes</b> and operations allow for, and put requirements on, the fixturing strategy. In this article, different fixturing strategies during cutting of stamped sheet metal parts are discussed and evaluated with respect to minimized variation in critical features. The strategies are discussed from a theoretical point of view. Geometrical decoupling philosophies are used to minimize the number of variation sources during cutting. The strategies are also illustrated using an industrial case study consisting of laser cutting of a stamped sheet metal part. Some general guidelines, based on the results, for fixturing during sequences of operations are formulated. In this article, fixturing during laser cutting followed by fixturing during assembly are in focus, but the strategies should be generalizable to other sequences of manufacturing operations as well...|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} three {{different}} algorithms such as Brute Force Delaunay Triangulation and k-d Tree are analyzed on matching comparison for 3 D shape representation.

To determine 3 D pose of moving objects some tracking system may require full 3 D pose estimation of arbitrarily shaped objects in real time. In order to perform 3 D pose estimation in real time each step in the tracking algorithm must be computationally efficient. This paper presents method comparison for the computationally efficient registration of 3 D shapes including free-form surfaces. Matching of free-form surfaces are carried out by using geometric point matching algorithm ICP. Several aspects of the ICP algorithm are investigated and analyzed by using specified surface setup.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Even {{though the}} body of {{literature}} {{in the area of}} cutting and packing is growing rapidly, research seems to focus on standard problems in the first place, while practical aspects are less frequently dealt with. This is particularly true for <b>setup</b> <b>processes</b> which arise in industrial cutting processes whenever a new cutting pattern is started (i. e. a pattern is different from its predecessor) and the cutting equipment has to be prepared {{in order to meet the}} technological requirements of the new pattern. Setups involve the consumption of resources and the loss of production time capacity. Therefore, consequences of this kind must explicitly be taken into account for the planning and control of industrial cutting processes. This results in extensions to traditional models which will be reviewed here. We show how setups can be represented in such models, and we report on the algorithms which have been suggested for the determination of solutions of the respective models. We discuss the value of these approaches and finally point out potential directions of future research...|$|R
