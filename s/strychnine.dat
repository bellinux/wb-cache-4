5|$|The {{reaction}} {{has been}} used in a number of notable total syntheses including the Danishefsky Taxol total synthesis, which produces the chemotherapeutic drug taxol, and the Kuehne <b>Strychnine</b> total synthesis which produces the pesticide <b>strychnine.</b>|$|E
5|$|This latter {{method has}} enjoyed greater {{success as a}} {{synthetic}} tool, most notably in the Shibasaki total synthesis of the famous poison <b>Strychnine.</b>|$|E
5|$|Most {{traditional}} {{or historical}} first-aid treatments for redback spider bites are either useless or dangerous. These include making incisions and promoting bleeding, using ligatures, applying alkaline solutions, providing warmth, and sucking the venom out. In modern first aid, incising, sucking, applying bandages and tourniqueting are strongly discouraged. In 1893, the Camperdown Chronicle {{reported that a}} doctor noticed that a severely ill benumbed victim got much better overnight following treatment using injections of <b>strychnine</b> and cocaine; <b>strychnine</b> had been popular as a snake bite antidote, {{but it was not}} effective. As of 2011, administration of magnesium sulphate was reported to have had some benefit though evidence of effectiveness is weak.|$|E
5|$|Orangutans {{are thought}} to be the sole fruit {{disperser}} for some plant species including the climber species Strychnos ignatii which contains the toxic alkaloid <b>strychnine.</b> It {{does not appear to have}} any effect on orangutans except for excessive saliva production.|$|E
5|$|Pesticides {{derived from}} plants include nicotine, rotenone, <b>strychnine</b> and pyrethrins. Plants such as tobacco, cannabis, opium poppy, and coca yield psychotropic chemicals. Poisons from plants include atropine, ricin, hemlock and curare, {{though many of}} these also have {{medicinal}} uses.|$|E
5|$|Cleopatra {{is said to}} have {{poisoned}} {{herself with}} an asp after hearing of Marc Antony's demise. Prior to her death, she was said to have sent many of her maidservants to act as guinea pigs to test different poisons, including belladonna, henbane, and the <b>strychnine</b> tree's seed.|$|E
5|$|In Nuenen, Van Gogh {{focused on}} {{painting}} and drawing. Working outside and very quickly, he completed sketches and paintings of weavers and their cottages. From August 1884, Margot Begemann, a neighbour's daughter ten years his senior, joined {{him on his}} forays; {{she fell in love}} and he reciprocated, though less enthusiastically. They wanted to marry, but neither side of their families were in favour. Margot was distraught and took an overdose of <b>strychnine,</b> but survived after Van Gogh rushed her to a nearby hospital. On 26 March 1885, his father died of a heart attack.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, many Olympic athletes began using drugs {{to improve their}} {{athletic}} abilities. For example, in 1904, Thomas Hicks, a gold medallist in the marathon, was given <b>strychnine</b> by his coach. The only Olympic death linked to performance enhancing occurred at the 1960 Rome games. A Danish cyclist, Knud Enemark Jensen, fell from his bicycle and later died. A coroner's inquiry {{found that he was}} under the influence of amphetamines. By the mid-1960s, sports federations started to ban the use of performance-enhancing drugs; in 1967 the IOC followed suit.|$|E
5|$|The {{pharmaceutical}} industry has {{roots in the}} apothecary shops of Europe in the 1800s, where pharmacists provided local traditional medicines to customers, which included extracts like morphine, quinine, and <b>strychnine.</b> Therapeutically important drugs like camptothecin (from Camptotheca acuminata, used in traditional Chinese medicine) and taxol (from the Pacific yew, Taxus brevifolia) were derived from medicinal plants. The Vinca alkaloids vincristine and vinblastine, used as anti-cancer drugs, were discovered in the 1950s from the Madagascar periwinkle, Catharanthus roseus.|$|E
5|$|Alkaloids {{are derived}} from various amino acids. Over 3000 known {{alkaloids}} exist, examples include nicotine, caffeine, morphine, cocaine, colchicine, ergolines, <b>strychnine,</b> and quinine. Alkaloids have pharmacological effects on humans and other animals. Some alkaloids can inhibit or activate enzymes, or alter carbohydrate and fat storage by inhibiting the formation phosphodiester bonds involved in their breakdown. Certain alkaloids bind to nucleic acids and can inhibit synthesis of proteins and affect DNA repair mechanisms. Alkaloids can also affect cell membrane and cytoskeletal structure causing the cells to weaken, collapse, or leak, and can affect nerve transmission. Although alkaloids act on a diversity of metabolic systems in humans and other animals, they almost uniformly invoke an aversively bitter taste.|$|E
5|$|Another {{important}} {{application of}} samarium {{and its compounds}} is as catalyst and chemical reagent. Samarium catalysts assist decomposition of plastics, dechlorination of pollutants such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), {{as well as the}} dehydration and dehydrogenation of ethanol. Samarium(III) triflate (Sm(OTf)3, that is Sm(CF3SO3)3), {{is one of the most}} efficient Lewis acid catalysts for a halogen-promoted Friedel–Crafts reaction with alkenes. Samarium(II) iodide is a very common reducing and coupling agent in organic synthesis, for example in the desulfonylation reactions; annulation; Danishefsky, Kuwajima, Mukaiyama and Holton Taxol total syntheses; <b>strychnine</b> total synthesis; Barbier reaction and other reductions with samarium(II) iodide.|$|E
5|$|With the Orca slowly sinking, {{the trio}} attempt a riskier approach. Hooper puts on scuba gear {{and enters the}} water in a shark-proof cage, {{intending}} to lethally inject the shark with <b>strychnine</b> using a hypodermic spear. The shark demolishes the cage before Hooper can inject it, but he manages to escape to the seabed. The shark then attacks the boat directly, killing Quint. Trapped on the sinking vessel, Brody stuffs a pressurized scuba tank into the shark's mouth, and, climbing the mast, shoots the tank with Quint's rifle, destroying it. The resulting explosion kills the shark. Hooper resurfaces, and he and Brody paddle to Amity Island clinging to boat wreckage.|$|E
5|$|Although the Robbins Report did {{not receive}} the same {{recognition}} as the Leopold Report, it reached similar conclusions. However, unlike the Leopold Report, the Robbins Report criticized the NPS for its lack of scientific research and made recommendations for sweeping changes {{in the structure of}} the NPS, with a proposal for a strong focus on a science-based approach. In 1972, the far more detailed Cain Report was released; amounting to 207 pages in comparison to the Leopold Report's scant 28, its committee was chaired by Stanley A. Cain, who also worked on the Leopold Report. Although this report made similar recommendations to the one primarily written by Leopold, it stated that little had been done to advance the previous report's findings, especially in terms of predator control. As a result of the Cain Report's recommendations, President Richard Nixon signed Executive Order 11643, which restricted the usage of poisons such as <b>strychnine</b> and sodium cyanide for predator control.|$|E
5|$|In 1990 {{scientists}} {{preparing the}} skins of the hooded pitohui for museum collections experienced numbness and burning when handling them. It {{was reported in}} 1992 that this species and two other pitohuis contained a neurotoxin called homobatrachotoxin, a derivative of batrachotoxin, in their tissues. This made them the first documented poisonous birds, other than some reports of coturnism caused by consuming quails (although toxicity in quails is unusual), and the first bird discovered with toxins in the skin. The same toxin had previously only been found in Colombian poison dart frogs from the genus Phyllobates (family Dendrobatidae). The batrachotoxin family of compounds are the most toxic compounds by weight in nature, being 250 times more toxic than <b>strychnine.</b> Later research found that the hooded pitohui had other batrachotoxins in its skin, including batrachotoxinin-A cis-crotonate, batrachotoxinin-A and batrachotoxinin-A 3′-hydroxypentanoate.|$|E
25|$|Also {{used was}} <b>strychnine,</b> which in small doses {{tightened}} tired muscles. A track rider {{of the era}} said he had developed such a tolerance to the drug that he took doses large enough to kill smaller men. The use of <b>strychnine,</b> far from being banned, was thought necessary to survive demanding races, says the sports historian Alain Lunzenfichter.|$|E
25|$|Caffeine, as {{do other}} alcaloids such as cinchonine, quinine or <b>strychnine,</b> {{precipitates}} polyphenols and tannins.This property {{can be used}} in a quantitation method.|$|E
25|$|Historically, {{poisoning}} {{was very}} successful in reducing wolf populations, particularly in the American West and Imperial Japan. <b>Strychnine</b> was {{the most frequently used}} compound. The poison would be typically mixed in lard or tallow, and spread on bits of meat, or placed within incisions on the bait. Though effective, the method had the disadvantage of greatly loosening the fur of the dead wolf, causing it to shed easily. Wolves killed by <b>strychnine</b> were typically skinned immediately after death, {{in order to avoid the}} fur absorbing too much of the poison.|$|E
25|$|When sterics {{allow for}} attack on only the {{appropriate}} carbon (the terminal carbon {{as opposed to}} the second carbon), direct attack by an intramolecular nitrogen is effective, {{as is the case with}} <b>strychnine</b> synthesis.|$|E
25|$|A related myth {{is that a}} {{new type}} of gang {{initiation}} requires the initiate to put a mixture of LSD and <b>strychnine</b> on the buttons of as many payphones as possible. This too, is debunked by the urban legends website Snopes.com.|$|E
25|$|In toxicology, Harley made {{researches}} {{into the}} action of <b>strychnine,</b> and on Calabar bean; and in 1864 read a paper to the British Association poisoned arrows. He demonstrated that strychnia and wourali have the property of reciprocally neutralising the toxic effects of one another.|$|E
25|$|In 1931 {{the staff}} at Frimley Cottage Hospital were unable {{to save the life}} of Lieutenant Hubert Chevis, who had been admitted, along with his wife Frances, after eating {{poisoned}} partridge meat. He died of <b>strychnine</b> poisoning. The case remains an unsolved murder mystery.|$|E
25|$|Many {{individuals}} and groups, especially those within the mainstream medical profession, attempted {{to analyze the}} Keeley Cure for its ingredients and reports varied widely as to their identity. <b>Strychnine,</b> alcohol, apomorphine, willow bark, ammonia, and atropine were among the many suggested chemicals.|$|E
25|$|<b>Strychnine</b> {{has indeed}} rarely been {{discovered}} mixed with LSD {{and other drugs}} in a few samples recovered by law enforcement agencies, but these were all found in murder or attempted murder investigations where someone was being specifically targeted for poisoning, and not associated with recreational LSD use.|$|E
25|$|The {{residents}} of Styles wake to find Emily Inglethorp dying of <b>strychnine</b> poisoning. Hastings, a house guest, enlists {{the help of}} his friend Hercule Poirot, who is staying in the nearby village, Styles St. Mary. Poirot pieces together events surrounding the murder. On the day she was killed, Emily Inglethorp was overheard arguing with someone, either her husband Alfred or her stepson John. Afterwards, she seemed quite distressed and, apparently, made a new will — which no one can find. She ate little at dinner and retired early to her room with her document case. The case was later forced open by someone and a document removed. Alfred Inglethorp left Styles earlier in the evening and stayed overnight in the nearby village, so was not present when the poisoning occurred. Nobody can explain how or when the <b>strychnine</b> was administered to Mrs. Inglethorp.|$|E
25|$|During {{the late}} 1940s, Woodward {{synthesized}} many complex natural products including quinine, cholesterol, cortisone, <b>strychnine,</b> lysergic acid, reserpine, chlorophyll, cephalosporin, and colchicine. With these, Woodward {{opened up a}} new era of synthesis, sometimes called the 'Woodwardian era' in which he showed that natural products could be synthesized by careful applications of the principles of physical organic chemistry, and by meticulous planning.|$|E
25|$|The next day, Palmer began {{collecting}} bets {{on behalf of}} Cook, bringing home £1,200. He then purchased three grains of <b>strychnine</b> from the surgery of Dr Salt, and put the grains into two pills, which he then administered to Cook. On 21 November, not long after Palmer administered two ammonia pills, Cook died in agony at about 1:00 AM, screaming that he was suffocating.|$|E
25|$|The {{cause of}} Pisciotta's death, as {{revealed}} by the autopsy, was the ingestion of 20mg of <b>strychnine.</b> All Italy was alive with theories about who killed Pisciotta. Both {{the government and the}} Mafia were suggested as being behind the murder of Pisciotta, but no one was ever brought to trial. The fascist and Communist press did their best to put it on newly appointed Premier Scelba's administration, but had no evidence to go on.|$|E
25|$|Bummer was a {{black-and-white}} Newfoundland or Newfoundland cross who established himself outside the saloon of Frederick Martin in 1860 and quickly {{proved to be}} an exceptional rat-killer. His ratting talent spared him the fate of the former owner of the territory, Bruno, who had been poisoned with <b>strychnine</b> shortly before Bummer's arrival. He scraped a living begging scraps from passers-by and the patrons of the saloon and other establishments along Montgomery Street.|$|E
25|$|When the {{two sets}} of {{measurements}} were compared, the authorities concluded that the headless woman could not possibly have been Belle Gunness, even when the ravages of the fire on the body were taken into account. (The flesh was badly burned but intact). Moreover, Dr. J. Meyers examined the internal organs of the dead woman. He sent stomach contents of the victims to a pathologist in Chicago, who reported months later that the organs contained lethal doses of <b>strychnine.</b>|$|E
25|$|Some {{scholars}} {{believe that}} the evidence {{should not have been}} enough to convict him, and that the summing up of the judge, John Campbell, 1st Baron Campbell, was prejudicial. On 20 May 1946, The Sentinel published a final piece of evidence not included in the trial, found by Mrs E. Smith, widow of the former coroner for South West London; it was a prescription for opium written in Palmer's handwriting, on the reverse of which was a chemist's bill for 10d worth of <b>strychnine</b> and opium.|$|E
25|$|In 1966 {{wildlife}} writer Roger A. Caras {{published a}} book called The Custer Wolf, which {{tells the story of}} a family of wolves in the Custer area through the eyes of one of the wolves. Beginning in a world of natural harmony, the wolves' lives and those of all other animals are disturbed when iron ore from Michigan and coal from Pennsylvania are turned into guns and traps; <b>strychnine</b> is imported from India, all to make war on the wolf. The book ends with H.P. Williams's reflection on the animals he killed.|$|E
25|$|Owing {{the wide}} overall range Geranoaetus melanoleucus is {{considered}} a Species of Least Concern by the IUCN. While it is rare and declining in places – e.g. in Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina states in Brazil, or in parts of Argentina – its habitat requirements mean that it will to some degree benefit from deforestation and it has for example colonized regions of the former Mata Atlântica forest in Alagoas. The declines in Argentina {{have been attributed to}} poisoning by <b>strychnine</b> baits deployed by sheep farmers trying to eradicate pests.|$|E
25|$|She had 100m season's bests of 11.17 in 1990 then 11.26 {{seconds in}} 1991. The 1991 World Championships in Athletics marked her second outing {{at the global}} level, and she again reached the semi-final stage of the 100m. However, she was banned for three months from the sport after giving a {{positive}} doping test for <b>strychnine</b> – this was an unusual substance to be banned for, as it had largely fallen out of use after the early 20th century. Slyusar became only the sixth athlete to be disqualified for doping at the World Championships in Athletics, and the first from the Soviet Union.|$|E
25|$|While {{serving his}} {{sentence}} {{he wrote his}} autobiography awaiting a new trial at which he would be charged with killing Giuliano. Some authorities were beginning to take his evidence more seriously, and perjury and other charges were made against police and Carabinieri. Pisciotta realised {{that he had been}} abandoned and was threatening to reveal much more than at the first trial, in particular who signed the letter which had been brought to Giuliano just before the attack. On February 9, 1954, he took a cup of coffee with {{what he thought was a}} tuberculosis medicine. Instead someone had replaced it with <b>strychnine.</b> Within an hour he was dead and his autobiography disappeared.|$|E
25|$|Carolyn Nadine Davis, 14 years old, {{ran away}} from her home outside Anderson in Shasta County on February 6, 1973 but {{disappeared}} July 15 after being dropped off by her grandmother at the Garberville Post Office. She was last seen hitchhiking that afternoon near the Highway 101 ramp, southbound, in Garberville. Her body was discovered on July 31 just three feet from where the remains of Sterling and Weber had been recovered seven months prior. Cause of death was <b>strychnine</b> poisoning 10–14 days before discovery. It could not be determined {{if she had been}} raped. Investigators postulated that her body had been thrown from the road as the hillside brush appeared undisturbed.|$|E
25|$|At first, Alfred is {{the prime}} suspect. He has the most to gain financially from his wife's death, and, since he is much younger than Emily was, the Cavendishes already suspect him as a fortune hunter. Evelyn Howard, Emily's companion, seems to hate him. His {{behaviour}} is suspicious; he openly purchased <b>strychnine</b> in the village before Emily was poisoned, and although he denies it, he refuses to provide an alibi. Inspector Japp is keen to arrest him, but Poirot intervenes by proving {{he could not have}} purchased the poison. Inspector Japp arrests John Cavendish. He inherits under the terms of her will, and there is evidence to suggest he had obtained poison.|$|E
