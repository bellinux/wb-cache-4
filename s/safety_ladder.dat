At 0733 hours {{many of the men}} were below decks having breakfast when [...] commanded by Oberleutnant zur See Johann-Otto Krieg fired two torpedoes. Accounts differ as to what followed. U-boat historian Guðmundur Helgason states that one torpedo hit Yoma, but Second World War blogger Martin Cherrett states that both of them hit her, one in her engine room and the other in her number 4 hold, sinking her within five minutes. Either way, the Chief Officer, A Olding, reported that she sank rapidly. Olding stated that the explosion destroyed the after engine room bulkhead, rapidly flooding the engine room, boiler room and no. 5 hold and blowing the hatches of nos. 3 and 4 holds. As men scrambled for <b>safety,</b> the <b>ladders</b> on No. 2 mess deck collapsed, trapping many men below decks.|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{describe}} {{the characteristics of}} patients who presented to the ED from a ladder-related fall and their injuries, highlight the impact of ladder-related falls on the ED, identify contributing factors of ladder falls and draw recommendations to improve <b>ladder</b> <b>safety.</b> Methods: A prospective observational {{study was conducted in}} two EDs. Patients 2 ̆ 7 demographics and ED services used were obtained from medical records. A 53 -item questionnaire was used to gather information about the type of ladder used, ladder activity, circumstances of the fall, contributing factors and future recommendations. Results: A total of 177 patients were recruited for this study. The typical patient was male, over the age of 50 and using a domestic ladder. The ED length of stay was between 30 min and 16 h, and was longer if patients were transferred to the short stay unit. Services most utilised in the ED included diagnostic tests, procedures and referrals to other healthcare teams. Most falls occurred because of ladder movement and slips or misstep. The major contributing factors identified were a combination of user features and flaws in ladder setup. Conclusions: Ladder-related falls carry a considerable burden to the ED. Recommendations include <b>ladder</b> <b>safety</b> interventions that target ladder users most at risk of falls: men, ≥ 50 years old and performing domestic tasks. Safety interventions should emphasise task avoidance, education and training, utilisation of safety equipment and appropriate ladder setup...|$|R

Missus and John-the-dig agreed not to tell anybody, so that they and the girls could {{continue}} as they always had. Adeline discovered Charlie's body in the woods, where he had apparently shot himself, but she said nothing to the others. Both Missus and John-the-dig fell to their deaths; Missus over three flights over a bannister, and John off an unsecure ladder. Though it looked like an accident, Adeline could tell the <b>ladder's</b> <b>safety</b> catch had been toyed with. Fearing what might have happened if she told the authorities they were alone, Adeline pretended Charlie was merely on holiday in Peru. She was assisted in this lie by Ambrose, a boy John had hired to help out after Missus died.|$|R

In the 3rd and 4th Competitions, it was to climb up a 10 m tower using ladder rungs attached {{to the sides of}} the walls, then climb a 5 m pole to a landing and the finishing button. In the 5th Competition, the ladder rungs alternated, making it more difficult for the competitor to reach the end, since they would have to climb the opposite wall every few steps. For the 6th Competition, the tower was replaced by a 10 m Climbing Wall.In the 7th Competition, the wall tower was replaced with a 12 m Net Climb.In the 8th Competition competitors must complete 10 mSurvival Climb (consisting of a series of metal bars), before climbing two vertically aligned (and opposite) Climbing Walls (3m+3m) to reach the goal.Unlike Sasuke, Kunoichi's Final Stage competitors are not dropped into a free fall if they fail to finish before time runs out.

40|$|The Traumatic Injury Prevention Pro- gram aims {{to reduce}} the {{incidence}} of physical trauma in the workplace, whether it is caused by unintentional injury or by violence. This snapshot highlights our recent accomplish- ments and some upcoming work. What are our priorities? The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) Traumatic Injury Prevention Pro-gram works with partners from industry, labor, trade associations, professional organizations, and academia. The program addresses these areas: 1. Decreasing the leading causes of work-related injuries. 2. Decreasing work-related injuries among high-risk occupations and vulnerable worker groups. What do we do? 1. Conduct research to develop an evidence base for: a. Preventing falls at work, and protecting workers from injury when falls happen. b. Preventing motor vehicle-related injuries, and protecting workers from injury during motor vehicle incidents. c. Preventing workplace violence by evaluating measures designed to reduce such violence, and making recommendations to reduce risk factors. d. Identifying and evaluating ways to reduce traumatic injuries among high-risk occupations and vulnerable worker groups, and making recommendations to reduce risk factors. These groups may include fire fighters; law enforcement officers; workers in construction, transportation, healthcare and fishing industries; young workers; older workers; racial/ethnic minorities; and others. 2. Share research findings and evidence-based recommendations with partners who can put the information into practice. These partners include manufacturers, consensus standard committees, employers, workers, and government agencies. 3. Conduct effective surveillance for occupational injuries, and share data with the re-search community, employers, and workers to guide future research and prevention efforts. What have we accomplished? 1. Released upgraded version of the award-winning NIOSH <b>Ladder</b> <b>Safety</b> smartphone app, which has been downloaded more than 50, 000 times. 2. Adoption of ambulance test methods by the General Services Administration's (GSA) purchase specifications for ambulances, and the National Fire Prevention Association standard. These test methods were developed by NIOSH and partners to improve ambulance crashworthiness. 3. Nearly 15, 000 healthcare personnel completed a free online workplace violence training course between August 2013 and December 2015. The course was developed by NIOSH and partners. 4. Published contemporary anthropometry (body size and dimensions) data for fire fighters and truck drivers on the NIOSH website, and encouraged use of these data in equipment and workspace design (e. g. fire fighter gloves, truck cabs). 5. Raised awareness of an upward trend in suicides in the workplace through analysis of surveillance data. 6. A manufacturer used NIOSH research to create an innovative personal flotation device for commercial fishermen that is comfortable enough to be worn continuously on deck while still providing flotation protection. It won an industry safety award, and more than 2, 000 units were sold in the first year. What's next? 1. Release a web-based simulator that will allow users to test and view the stability of aerial lifts under different worksite conditions, such as high winds and uneven ground. 2. Release a NIOSH Fact Sheet with recommendations to improve the safety of older drivers in the workplace. 3. Complete analyses evaluating workplace violence prevention interventions. 4. Publish findings on research into the underreporting of occupational injuries and its implications. NIOSHTIC No 2004815...|$|R
