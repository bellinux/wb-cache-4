40|$|Abstract—The network {{mobility}} (NEMO) basic support proto-col provides collective mobility {{for a group}} of nodes in vehicular area networks. Since the NEMO basic <b>support</b> <b>protocol</b> always performs the same operations regardless of a mobile network’s characteristics, it cannot achieve the optimal performance. We propose an adaptive NEMO <b>support</b> <b>protocol</b> based on Hier-archical Mobile IPv 6. The proposed protocol jointly optimizes binding update traffic and tunneling overhead by employing the adaptive binding update strategy depending on the session-to-mobility ratio (SMR). Specifically, both the mobile router (MR) and visiting mobile nodes (VMNs) configure two care-of-addresses: on-link care-of address (LCoA) and regional care-of address (RCoA). If the SMR is lower than a pre-defined threshold, the MR and VMNs respectively perform RCoA and LCoA binding update procedures to their HAs. Otherwise, LCoA and RCoA binding update procedures are conducted by the MR and VMNs, respectively. Via analytical models, we evaluate the performance of the adaptive NEMO <b>support</b> <b>protocol</b> against other NEMO <b>support</b> <b>protocols,</b> and derive the optimal SMR threshold. Numerical results demonstrate that the adaptive NEMO <b>support</b> <b>protocol</b> is a valuable solution for promising NEMO applications.
