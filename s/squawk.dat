5|$|Ruffed lemurs use alarm {{calls that}} {{differentiate}} between ground and aerial predators. For instance an abrupt roar or huff alerts {{the group to}} an avian predator, and a pulsed <b>squawk</b> or growl-snort communicates {{the existence of a}} mammalian ground predator. When sounding these calls, such as the pulsed <b>squawk,</b> adults direct them at the predator after moving to a safe position. Once the alarm call is sounded by one individual, the resulting chorus can even reach the furthest ranging community members.|$|E

5|$|The {{calls of}} ruffed lemurs vary only {{slightly}} {{between the two}} species. In fact, in captivity, {{it has been documented}} that red ruffed lemurs understand and even join in the alarm calls of black-and-white ruffed lemurs. One minor difference between the vocal repertoires of these two species is in the pulse rate and frequency of the pulsed <b>squawk,</b> which is much faster and higher in red ruffed lemurs than in black-and-white ruffed lemurs. The difference in this vocalization is only interspecific, showing no signs of significant sexual dimorphism within each species.|$|E

5|$|Carnaby's black {{cockatoo}} communicates by auditory {{and visual}} displays. The voice is generally noisy with several calls; loudest and most frequent is a wailing wy-lah, which is uttered by both sexes and often heard before the birds themselves are seen. There is usually an interval of 0.4 {{seconds before the}} call is repeated. This call is made by birds in flight, before taking off and returning to the nest. Carnaby's black cockatoos {{that are not in}} flight may answer with this call when they hear it. The call is often shortened or chopped off three-quarters of the way through as the bird takes off. The call varies between individual Carnaby's black cockatoos, and older nestlings can distinguish their parents' calls. Saunders labelled a variant of the wy-lah as the interrogative call—it is drawn out and ends with an inflection. Birds often utter a soft chuck call when alone. Females make a whistling call composed of two notes of varying volume when perched or about to take off. They also utter a softer version that is 0.6 seconds long, as well as a long single-noted whistle when alone. The male makes a soft shot wy-lah call in similar situations. Birds may also make a harsh screeching alarm call when they notice something is out of place. They <b>squawk</b> loudly in disputes with their own kind, when other animals enter breeding territory, or when they are handled by people in captivity. Males can utter a harsh chattering squeak when arguing with other males.|$|E

25|$|At 10:12:03, JP550 {{called the}} Zagreb middle-sector {{controller}} to inform {{them that the}} aircraft was out of flight level 310. The last instructions given by Erjavec to JP550 were to call the upper-sector controller on 134.45MHz and to stop squawking the assigned <b>squawk</b> code. By instructing JP550 to <b>squawk</b> Standby, Erjavec simply released a code allocated for the middle sector. The data tag for the DC-9 would now disappear from his screen and the aircraft would become merely a point among many others. If everything about this handover had been normal, the DC-9 would {{have been given a}} new code on initial contact with the upper sector controller and would have been positively identified on the upper sector screen with its flight number and altitude readout. But this had not been a normal handover because of the ill-handled co-ordination for the climb. Also, Tasić was busy with other traffic and JP550 did not immediately contact the upper-sector controller. This could have been because the frequency was busy, but the pilots might also have delayed the call for some unknown reason.|$|E

500|$|The Puerto Rican amazon is diurnal, {{typically}} beginning its day half an {{hour after}} sunrise. It is generally secretive when inside its nest, using its green plumage as camouflage. In contrast, it may be vocal and noisy when outside the nest. Upon taking flight, its color pattern provides some contrast to the forest. The flight mechanism of this species {{is similar to the}} one found in other amazons, and involves strokes below the body axis, unlike most birds whose wings flow above their bodies in flight. Amazons can fly moderately fast, reaching a top speed of approximately , and are fairly agile when evading predators in mid-air. When in search of food, the parrots group in pairs. Couples and their fledged young display a tendency to stay together. The amazon makes two flight calls, a take-off <b>squawk</b> which consist of a pattern of long squawks, and a loud [...] "bugle", commonly used in flight and which may have several meanings depending on the circumstances when it is used.|$|E
500|$|... "Judas" [...] was {{generally}} well received by most music critics.

MTV's James Dinh noted that the song was very similar in its composition to [...] "Bad Romance". Popjustice also compared it to [...] "Bad Romance" [...] describing it as [...] "a highly evolved, Titanium-plated 'Bad Romance' from the year 2511 travelling half a millennium {{back in time to}} save music from a tidal wave of 'in the club'-obsessed pop drivel, and that's 'Judas'." [...] Kevin O'Donnel from Spin felt that the song sounded like a rowdy, industrial-disco banger, and described Gaga's performance as [...] "insanely over the top: She alternates between rapping, a robotic monotone, and a crow-like <b>squawk</b> — before gliding into a more conventional chorus that hews closer to 'Bad Romance'." [...] He complimented the primal energy of the music of [...] "Judas," [...] and felt that the breakdown was one of the weirdest moments to hit the pop music scene in 2011. Slant Magazine's Eric Henderson noted that the disconnection and deviation from Gaga's previous single [...] "Born This Way" [...] was more pronounced with [...] "Judas". Musically he felt that [...] "Judas" [...] had the same [...] "glitter-jackhammer level as 'Born This Way', though the big anthemic chords are almost inverted—not unlike Inner City's Big Fun vs. Good Life. It's a good twin, evil twin thing." [...] Henderson continued that the song conjured the imagery of a disturbed vision of hell, and in a warped sense the song seemed more forward-thinking to him and less of a message, [...] "than the 'gay = great' equation at the heart of 'Born This Way'." ...|$|E
