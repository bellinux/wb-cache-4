5|$|Castro's guerrillas {{increased}} their attacks on military outposts, forcing {{the government to}} withdraw from the Sierra Maestra region, and by spring 1958, the rebels controlled a hospital, schools, a printing press, slaughterhouse, land-mine factory and a cigar-making factory. By 1958, Batista was under increasing pressure, a result of his military failures coupled with increasing domestic and foreign criticism <b>surrounding</b> <b>his</b> administration's press censorship, torture, and extrajudicial executions. Influenced by anti-Batista sentiment among their citizens, the U.S. government ceased supplying him with weaponry. The opposition called a general strike, accompanied by armed attacks from the MR-26-7. Beginning on April 9, it received strong support in central and eastern Cuba, but little elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|Commentators noted McCotter's lack of name {{recognition}} hindered his chances for nomination.

J. Heale, who finds that scholars now concur that Reagan rehabilitated conservatism, turned the nation to the right, practiced a considerably pragmatic conservatism that balanced ideology and the constraints of politics, revived faith in the presidency and in American exceptionalism, and contributed to victory in the Cold War.|$|E

Richard's brother, Prince John (later King John), came to Wales in September and tried to make peace. He persuaded Rhys to raise the siege of Carmarthen and accompany him to Oxford to meet Richard. Rhys arrived at Oxford to discover that Richard was not prepared to travel there to meet him, and hostilities continued.|$|E

Following Henry's death Rhys revolted against Richard I and attacked the Norman lordships <b>surrounding</b> <b>his</b> territory, capturing a number of castles. In his later years Rhys had trouble keeping control of his sons, particularly Maelgwn and Gruffydd, who maintained a feud with each other. Rhys launched his last campaign against the Normans in 1196 and captured a number of castles. The following year he died unexpectedly and was buried in St David's Cathedral.|$|E

5|$|Johnson's {{early works}} and early life have been {{neglected}} topics within Johnson scholarship. As a result, he is primarily {{known for the}} events <b>surrounding</b> <b>his</b> later life and later works like A Dictionary of the English Language.

In particular, Boswell ignored Johnson's early politics and political writings which show a concern with Sir Robert Walpole's political administration.|$|E

5|$|Sculpturally, Rodin {{possessed a}} unique ability to model a complex, turbulent, deeply {{pocketed}} surface in clay. Many {{of his most}} notable sculptures were roundly criticized during his lifetime.

Rodin's most original work departed from traditional themes of mythology and allegory, modeled the human body with realism, and celebrated individual character and physicality. Rodin was sensitive to the controversy <b>surrounding</b> <b>his</b> work, but refused to change his style. Successive works brought increasing favor {{from the government and}} the artistic community.|$|E
