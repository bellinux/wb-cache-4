5000|$|Midnight green (sometimes called Eagle green) {{is a dark}} <b>shade</b> <b>of</b> green. It is also a dark <b>shade</b> <b>of</b> cyan. This can {{be readily}} ascertained by noting {{the fact that this}} color's red value is zero, and also that its green and blue values are almost equal. Therefore, midnight green is a <b>shade</b> <b>of</b> cyan.|$|R
5000|$|Dark {{green is}} a dark <b>shade</b> <b>of</b> green. A {{different}} <b>shade</b> <b>of</b> green has been designated as [...] "dark green (X11)" [...] for certain computer uses.|$|R
5|$|Snow {{camouflage}} {{is the use}} of a coloration or {{pattern for}} effective camouflage in winter, often combined with a different summer camouflage. Summer patterns are typically disruptively patterned combinations of <b>shades</b> <b>of</b> browns and greys, up to black, while winter patterns are dominated by white to match snowy landscapes.|$|E
5|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} this and other Hydnellum species are prized by {{mushroom}} dyers. The colors may range from beige when no mordant is used, to various <b>shades</b> <b>of</b> blue or green depending on the mordant added.|$|E

50|$|The {{result of}} a {{metameric}} failure would be for example {{an image of a}} green tree which shows a different <b>shade</b> <b>of</b> green than the tree itself, a different <b>shade</b> <b>of</b> red for a red apple, a different <b>shade</b> <b>of</b> blue for the blue sky, and so on. Color management (e.g. with ICC profiles) can be used to mitigate this problem within the physical constraints.|$|R
5|$|Although the {{relatively}} large fruiting bodies of R.pulcherrimus are distinctive, {{they might be}} confused with superficially similar species, such as Rubroboletus eastwoodiae; the latter species has a much thicker stalk. Another similar species is R.haematinus, which may be distinguished by its yellower stem and cap colors that are various <b>shades</b> <b>of</b> brown. Its darker cap and lack of reticulation on the stipe differentiate it from R. satanas.|$|E
5|$|Camouflage is an {{important}} defense strategy enabled by changes in body shape, colour and markings. Some lepidopterans blend with the surroundings, making them difficult to be spotted by predators. Caterpillars can be <b>shades</b> <b>of</b> green that match their host plant. Others resemble inedible objects, such as twigs or leaves. The larvae of some species, such as the common Mormon and the western tiger swallowtail look like bird droppings.|$|E

Each train has two <b>shades</b> <b>of</b> green and pink on the bottom section while the seats and over-the-shoulder restraints are also pink. Each seat has an over-the-shoulder harness with an interlocking seatbelt. The trains have no floor as the riders' legs can dangle above the track.|$|E
2500|$|Because {{of the use}} of {{the word}} 'cyan' ( [...] , [...] ), which can also mean 'blue' in Greek, the exact <b>shade</b> <b>of</b> blue remains ambiguous. Although it implies the use <b>of</b> a light <b>shade</b> <b>of</b> blue, such as on the flag of the United Nations, the colours of the Greek flag tend to be darker, {{especially}} during the dictatorship and in recent years, with the exception of the years of the rule of King Otto, when a very light <b>shade</b> <b>of</b> blue was used. Consequently, the <b>shade</b> <b>of</b> blue is largely left to the flagmakers to decide, as shown in the table below.|$|R

5|$|Like most rare-earth elements, {{praseodymium}} most readily {{forms the}} +3 oxidation state, {{which is the}} only stable state in aqueous solution, although the +4 oxidation state is known in some solid compounds and, uniquely among the lanthanides, the +5 oxidation state is attainable in matrix-isolation conditions. Aqueous praseodymium ions are yellowish-green, and similarly praseodymium results in various <b>shades</b> <b>of</b> yellow-green when incorporated into glasses. Many of praseodymium's industrial uses involve its ability to filter yellow light from light sources.|$|E

5|$|The biographer Eugen Segnitz {{wrote in}} 1922 {{that the work}} was not only {{singular}} in the composer's work, but in the sacred music of its period, with a rare intense power of expression ("intensive Ausdruckskraft") and a convincing musical exegesis of the biblical text and also its turns and manifold <b>shades</b> <b>of</b> emotion ("überzeugende musikalische Auslegung des biblischen Textes, wie auch seiner Wendungen und mannigfaltigen Gefühlsschattierungen").|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{shown at the}} 1994 Cannes Film Festival and {{broadcast}} on British television in 1995. Although originally intended for theatrical release, it failed to find a theatrical distributor, and was released straight to video in the United States in 1997 under the title <b>Shades</b> <b>of</b> Fear. The film received mixed to negative reviews from critics, and while the lesbian sub-plot in particular was generally well received, Winterson's scripting was a focal point of criticism.|$|E
5000|$|At zero saturation, {{lightness}} {{controls the}} resulting <b>shade</b> <b>of</b> gray. A value of zero still produces black, and full lightness still produces white.
