40|$|Congenital malformations {{have become}} more {{frequent}} in large animal clinics. <b>Anal</b> <b>atresia</b> is a congenital malformation that has been previously reported in several species and it is normally associated with other malformations, such as urethrorectal fistula, pseudohermaphoroditism, rectovaginal fistula, accessory scrotum, diphallia, renal agenesis, renal and ureteral fusion and skeletal malformations as well. This case report describes the multiple congenital malformations of a Nellore calf. Some of the malformations observed in this case were different from those reported in the literature, especially the failure {{in the formation of}} ventral midline structures of the animal. Radiographic examination was of great importance for the diagnosis and especially to assess the involvement of other structures. Due to multiple malformations and the poor prognosis, the calf was euthanized and it was concluded that cases of <b>anal</b> <b>atresia</b> must be further investigated for associated problems that could risk life or productivity of the animal.

40|$|<b>Anal</b> <b>atresia</b> is a {{rare and}} severe {{disorder}} in swine occurring with an incidence of 0. 1 – 1. 0 %. A whole-genome scan based on affected half-sibs was performed to identify susceptibility loci for <b>anal</b> <b>atresia.</b> The analysis included 27 families {{with a total of}} 95 animals and 65 affected piglets among them. Animals were genotyped for 126 microsatellite markers distributed across the 18 autosomal porcine chromosomes and the X chromosome, covering an estimated 2080 cM. Single-point and multipoint nonparametric linkage scores were calculated using the computer package ALLEGRO 1. 0. Significant linkage results were obtained for chromosomes 1, 3, and 12. Markers on these chromosomes and additionally on chromosomes for which candidate genes have been postulated in previous studies were subjected to the transmission disequilibrium test (TDT). The test statistic exceeded the genomewide significance level for adjacent markers SW 1621 (P = 7 × 10 − 7) and SW 1902 (P = 3 × 10 − 3) on chromosome 1, supporting the results of the linkage analysis.

40|$|Oesophageal atresia (OA) is a {{congenital}} defect associated with additional malformations in 30 - 70 % of the cases. In particular, OA is {{a component of}} the VACTERL association.

40|$|Abstract: A 29 -year-old {{man with}} {{vertebral}} defects, <b>anal</b> <b>atresia,</b> cardiac defects, tracheoesophageal fistula, renal defects, and limb defects (VACTERL) presented with headache, photophobia, and worsening nystagmus. He had near-normal visual acuity and visual fields, absent stereopsis, and see-saw nystagmus. Brain MRI revealed a thin {{remnant of the}} optic chiasm but normal-sized optic nerves. Functional MRI during monocular visual stimulation demonstrated non-crossing of the visual evoked responses in the occipital cortex, confirming achiasma. These findings have not previously been reported in VACTERL. (J Neuro-Ophthalmol 2009; 29 : 000 – 000) The formation of the optic chiasm by the optic nerves has fascinated anatomists for centuries {{and continues to be}} vigorously studied today (1). In congenital achiasma, there are few or no crossing fibers, leading to decreased vision, strabismus, and nystagmus (2 – 7). Although achiasma usually occurs in the absence of other developmental anomalies, we report a case of achiasma in the setting of a congenital syndrome involving vertebral defects, <b>anal</b> <b>atresia,</b> cardiac defects, tracheoesophageal fistula with atresia, renal defects, and limb defects (VACTERL), a finding not previously described...|$|R

40|$|Introduction. <b>Anal</b> <b>atresia</b> is a {{congenital}} anomaly, very {{life threatening}} and urgent. Surgical treatment of this anomaly consists of colostomy first, {{and then of}} anal reconstruction. Case report. We presented a 31 -year old female with the surgery treatment of <b>anal</b> <b>atresia</b> in the early childhood. In the reproductive period, due to tubal infertily, the patient {{was included in the}} program of in vitro fertilization (IVF), in the Clinic for Gynecology and Obstetrics 'Narodni front', Belgrade. Within this program a long protocol of ovarian stimulation was performed. Ultrasonographic and color Doppler monitoring of the patient was applied by the use of an ultrasonographic apparatus type Siemens Acuson X 150, while any hormonal examinations were performed by an Architect Abbott unit. During the IVF program, the growth of follicules was controlled by the use of ultrasonography, microcirculation of the ovaries and the uterus was marked by a power-pulsating color Doppler, and hormonal examination was performed starting from the day of stimulation up to the day of injecting Pregnyl®. The patient was administered Suprefact® (buserelin) sc from the 21 st day of the menstrual cycle, {{as well as from the}} 3 rd day of the cycle, for totally 11 days. The patient was given 29 ampoules of Gonal F® (recombinant human FSH) 75 IJ im and 15 ampoules of Menopur® (menotrophin) im. Due to a modified pelvic anatomy, the left ovary aspiration was disabled, while the right ovary aspired seven oocytes successfully. Three embryos were inserted in the uterus. The delivery was performed by cesarean section. Conclusion. In the reported patient with a modified pelvic anatomy due to four corrective surgeries of <b>anal</b> <b>atresia,</b> and tubal infertility in the reproductive period, the method of choice for the realization of pregnancy was the IVF procedure. The realized pregnancy and the delivery could be considered highly successful in regard to possible risks...|$|R
40|$|Anorectal {{anomalies}} occurring {{with other}} anomalies or {{as part of}} syndromes were analyzed to determine how their epidemiological characteristics differed from those of isolated anal anomalies. Almost 15 % of cases were chromosomal, monogenic or teratogenic syndromes, whereas the rest were of unknown cause including sequences (9. 3 %), VACTERL associations (15. 4 %) and multiple congenital anomalies (MCA) (60. 2 %). Almost half of babies with MCA had one or two VACTERL anomalies with distribution frequencies that did not differ significantly from those in babies with the full VACTERL association. There were considerable differences in the frequency of the VACTERL association among babies with different types of anorectal anomaly. Babies with anal anomalies occurring with sequences, VACTERL or MCA showed the same sex differences as babies with isolated anal anomalies, namely male predominance in <b>anal</b> <b>atresia</b> without fistula or cloaca, no sex difference in <b>anal</b> <b>atresia</b> with fistula, and female predominance in ectopic anus and congenital anal fistula. These anomalies, however, were associated with significantly lower mean gestational lengths and birth weights, and higher frequencies of fetal death and pregnancy termination than babies with isolated anal anomalies. Twins were more frequent in sequences, VACTERL and MCA than in isolated anomalies, monogenic syndromes or chromosome anomalies. Five cases were conjoined twins, representing 15 % of all cases of twin pregnancies with an anal anomaly. Indeterminate sex was more frequent in babies with <b>anal</b> <b>atresias</b> without fistula than in those with fistula. Anal anomalies are defects of blastogenesis attributable to disorders in expression of pattern determining genes. The differential sex involvement in different types of anal anomaly may be manifestations of expression of the HY/SRY genes during blastogenesis or of X-linkag...|$|R
