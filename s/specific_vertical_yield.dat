The dredged clays investigated had {{a wide spectrum of}} liquid limits within 55. 6 % to 100 % a predominant clay mineral of illite. It is found that <b>vertical</b> <b>yield</b> stresses develop notably during ageing. The developed <b>vertical</b> <b>yield</b> stresses vary within the range of 1. 2 to 1. 8 times the specifically assigned vertical effective stress under which ageing is allowed for 15 to 105 days. But the corresponding ageing volumetric strains are small, varying within the range of 0. 6 % to 3. 4 % with most being less than 2 %. The test results obtained also allow proposing an empirical equation of assessing <b>vertical</b> <b>yield</b> stress. The changing law of <b>vertical</b> <b>yield</b> stress with stress level for ageing, ageing time, soil properties is investigated based on the empirical equation. Moreover, it is found that the structural resistance of dredged clays developed during ageing for a period of consolidation time up to 105 days is weak compared with the sedimentation compression line of natural clays developed during long geological ageing. But the compression curves of dredged clays with ageing converge slowly to the intrinsic compression line over a wide range of stresses, like natural clays subjected to the effect of soil structure developed during long depositional post-depositional processes.

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} {{the growth of}} InP nanowires on Si(111) using a thin InP buffer layer. The buffer layer is grown using a two-step procedure. The initial layer formation is ensured by using a very low growth temperature. An extremely high V/III ratio is necessary to prevent In droplet formation at this low temperature. The second layer is grown on the initial layer at a higher temperature and we find that post-growth annealing of the buffer layer does not improve its crystal quality significantly. It is found that the layers inherently have the (111) B polarity. Nanowires grown on this buffer layer have the same morphology and optical properties as nanowires grown on InP (111) B substrates. The <b>vertical</b> <b>yield</b> of the nanowires grown on the buffer layer is over 97 % and we also find that crystal defects in the buffer layer do not affect the morphology, <b>vertical</b> <b>yield</b> or optical properties of the nanowires significantly...|$|R

We show that boiling the substrate in ultrapure water leads to a significant improvement in the <b>vertical</b> <b>yield</b> of NWs (realizing 80 %) grown on substrates patterned by electron-beam lithography (EBL). Tentatively, we attribute this improvement to a reduction in atomic roughness of the substrate in the mask opening. On this basis, we transfer our growth results to substrates processed by a technique that enables the efficient patterning of large arrays, nano imprint lithography (NIL). In order to obtain hole sizes below 50 nm, we combine the conventional NIL process with an indirect pattern transfer (NIL-IPT) technique. Thereby, we achieve smaller hole sizes than previously reported for conventional NIL and growth results that are comparable to those achieved on EBL patterned substrates...|$|R

40|$|In {{the past}} years the Norwegian PV market has grown substantially. The {{importance}} {{of data on}} how PV systems perform in Norway is therefore also increasing. In this thesis several Norwegian PV systems are analyzed mainly in terms of annual specific yields. The systems are located in western and southeastern Norway and near horizontal, tilted and vertical modules are looked at. Results show pretty similar performance of the near horizontal systems, so-called east/west applications, with 700 kWh/kWp being an approximate average annual <b>specific</b> <b>yield.</b> <b>Vertical</b> systems show large variations in yield due to shading losses and suboptimal orientations. Nonetheless, vertical systems having been placed well show great potential, having annual specific yields {{on the order of}} 700 kWh/kWp while producing far better than near horizontal systems in winter months. Not surprisingly systems tilted 30 or more give the highest yields, slighty above 900 kWh/kWp seeming like a fair approximation for the annual specific yield of such systems in southern Norway. The measured yields have also been compared to estimated yield, giving a rough average deviation of 5 %. Irradiation data from 57 locations in Norway has also been gathered, confirming that the average annual irradiation lies somewhere between 700 and 1000 kWh/m 2. The three irradiation models/databases Meteonorm 7. 1, PVGIS and NASA SSE have been compared to this data by the means of RMS errors, indicating that Meteonorm and PVGIS perform similarly while the NASA database is less precise. Large local differences are observed though, making some models preferable in certain locations. Simulations performed in PVsyst using average global and diffuse irradiation data from Trondheim, Bergen and Ås show that the increase in yield gotten from tilting a PV system varies not only with latitude but also the amount of diffuse irradiation at each location. Results indicate that the overall relative increase in yield gotten from tilting is the lowest in Bergen and highest in Ås, while the increase from tilting modules 10 is highest in Trondheim...|$|R
