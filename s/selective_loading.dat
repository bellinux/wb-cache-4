40|$|Selfish genes {{demonstrate}} transmission {{bias and}} invade sexual populations despite conferring no benefit to their hosts. While the molecular genetics and evolutionary dynamics of selfish genes are reasonably well characterized, {{their effects on}} hosts are not. Homing endonuclease genes (HEGs) are one well-studied family of selfish genes that {{are assumed to be}} benign. However, we show that carrying HEGs is costly for Saccharomyces cerevisiae, demonstrating that these genetic elements are not necessarily benign but maybe parasitic. We estimate a <b>selective</b> <b>load</b> of approximately 1 - 2 in 'natural' niches. The second aspect we examine is the ability of HEGs to affect hosts' sexual behaviour. As all selfish genes critically rely on sex for spread, then any selfish gene correlated with increased host sexuality will enjoy a transmission advantage. While classic parasites are known to manipulate host behaviour, we are not aware of any evidence showing a selfish gene is capable of affecting host promiscuity. The data presented here show a selfish element may increase the propensity of its eukaryote host to undergo sex and along with increased rates of non-Mendelian inheritance, this may counterbalance mitotic <b>selective</b> <b>load</b> and promote spread. Demonstration that selfish genes are correlated with increased promiscuity in eukaryotes connects with ideas suggesting that selfish genes promoted the evolution of sex initially.

If this is the case, then depletion of myocyte Na+ should inhibit Ca 2 + uptake, and collapse of the mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) would inhibit the uniporter. To test these hypotheses, isolated rat myocytes were exposed to metabolic inhibition, to mimic hypoxia, and [Ca 2 +]m and [Ca 2 +]c determined by <b>selective</b> <b>loading</b> of indo- 1 into these compartments.

40|$|Abstract — Impending voltage {{collapse}} {{can often}} be avoided by appropriate control of loads. However the traditional form of load control (shedding) is unpopular due to the resulting consumer disruption. Advances in communications and computer systems allow more <b>selective</b> <b>load</b> control though. Individual loads that are sacrificeable in the short-term can be switched with minimal consumer disruption. The paper considers {{the use of such}} non-disruptive load control for improving voltage stability. A control strategy that is based on model predictive control (MPC) is proposed. MPC utilizes an internal model to predict system dynamic behaviour over a finite horizon. Control decisions are based on optimizing that predicted response. MPC is a discretetime form of control, so inaccuracies in predicted behaviour are corrected at the next control interval. A standard 10 bus voltage collapse example is used to illustrate this control strategy...|$|R

We now report that, in addition to their established roles as fusion accelerators, SM proteins Sly 1 and Vps 33 directly shield SNARE complexes from Sec 17 - and Sec 18 -mediated disassembly. In vivo, wild-type Sly 1 and Vps 33 function are required to withstand overproduction of Sec 17. In vitro, Sly 1 and Vps 33 impede SNARE complex disassembly by Sec 18 and ATP.

A load value predictor is an architectural enhancement which speculates over {{the results of}} a micro-processor load instruction to speedup the execution of the following instructions. The proposed architectural enhancement differs from a classic predictor due to an improved selection scheme that allows to activate the predictor only when a miss occurs in the first level of cache. We analyze the effectiveness of the selective predictor in terms of overall energy reduction and performance improvement. To this end, we show how the proposed predictor can produce benefits (in terms of overall cost) when the cache size of the SMT architecture is reduced and we compare it with a classic non-selective load value prediction scheme.

Three reactions, 7 Li(p,n) Ep= 2. 5 MeV, 9 Be(p,n) Ep= 3. 0 - 4. 0 MeV, and 9 Be(d,n) Ed= 2. 6 MeV are investigated here. Complete data for the 9 Be(p,n) reaction were not previously available.

Therefore, IAA and a wide survey of cytokinins (CKs), were examined along with abscisic acid (ABA) and polyamines (PAs) in released buds, tissue surrounding buds and xylem sap at 1 and 4 h after apex removal, when lateral buds of chickpea are known to break dormancy. Three potential lateral bud growth inhibitors, IAA, ABA and cis-zeatin 9 -riboside (ZR), declined sharply in the released buds and xylem following decapitation.

Spent SCR catalyst mainly consists of TiO 2 and other oxides (6. 37 % W, 1. 57 % vanadium (V), and 2. 81 % silicon (Si), etc.). The ground catalyst was leached at the optimal conditions, as follows: NaOH concentration of 0. 3 kg/kg of catalyst, pulp density of 3 %, leaching temperature of 70 °C, particle size of − 74 μm, and leaching time of 30 min. In this study, the leaching rate values of V and W under the above conditions were 87 wt %, and 91 wt %, respectively.

The {{erythrocyte}} cytoplasm has very low [Ca 2 +] (< 100 nM), which {{is very different from the}} extracellular environment encountered by most eukaryotic cells. The absence of extracellular Ca 2 + is usually incompatible with normal cell functions and survival. In the present work, we have tested the possibility that Plasmodia overcome the limitation posed by the erythrocyte intracellular environment through the maintenance of a high [Ca 2 +] within the parasitophorous vacuole (PV), the compartment formed during invasion and within which the parasites grow and divide. Thus, Plasmodia were allowed to invade erythrocytes in the presence of Ca 2 + indicator dyes. This allowed <b>selective</b> <b>loading</b> of the Ca 2 + probes within the PV. The [Ca 2 +] within this compartment was found to be ∼ 40 μM, i. e., high enough to be compatible with a normal loading of the Plasmodia intracellular Ca 2 + stores, a prerequisite for the use of a Ca 2 +-based signaling mechanism. We also show that reduction of extracellular [Ca 2 +] results in a slow depletion of the [Ca 2 +] within the PV. A transient drop of [Ca 2 +] in the PV for a period as short as 2 h affects the maturation process of the parasites within the erythrocytes, with a major reduction 48 h later in the percentage of schizonts, the form that re-invades the red blood cells...|$|E

Under control conditions EDHF-type relaxations evoked by acetylcholine (ACh) in rabbit iliac arteries were transient, but {{in the presence of}} the cAMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX) or the cell permeant cAMP analog 8 -bromo-cAMP, relaxations became sustained with their maxima potentiated ≈ 2 -fold. Relaxation was associated with transient ≈ 1. 5 -fold elevations in smooth muscle cAMP levels with both mechanical and nucleotide responses being abolished by interrupting gap junctional communication with the connexin-mimetic peptide Gap 27 and by endothelial denudation. However, IBMX induced a sustained endothelium-independent ≈ 2 -fold rise in cAMP levels, which was not further amplified by ACh, suggesting that the contribution of cAMP to the EDHF phenomenon is permissive. After <b>selective</b> <b>loading</b> of the endothelium with calcein AM, direct transfer of dye from the endothelium to the media was enhanced by IBMX or 8 -bromo-cAMP, but not by 8 -bromo-cGMP, whereas Gap 27 promoted sequestration within the intima. ACh-induced hyperpolarizations of subintimal smooth muscle in arterial strips with intact endothelium were abolished by Gap 27 and the adenylyl cyclase inhibitor 2 ′, 5 ′-dideoxyadenosine but were unaffected by IBMX. By contrast, in strips partially denuded of endothelium, IBMX enhanced the transmission of hyperpolarization from the endothelium to remote smooth muscle cells. These findings support the hypothesis that endothelial hyperpolarization underpins the EDHF phenomenon, with cAMP governing subsequent electrotonic signaling via both myoendothelial and homocellular smooth muscle gap junctions...|$|E
40|$|Type II {{restriction}} modification systems (RMSs) {{have been}} regarded either as defense tools or as molecular parasites of bacteria. We extensively analyzed their evolutionary role {{from the study}} of their impact in the complete genomes of 26 bacteria and 35 phages in terms of palindrome avoidance. This analysis reveals that palindrome avoidance is not universally spread among bacterial species and that it does not correlate with taxonomic proximity. Palindrome avoidance is also not universal among bacteriophage, even when their hosts code for RMSs, and depends strongly on the genetic material of the phage. Interestingly, palindrome avoidance is intimately correlated with the infective behavior of the phage. We observe that the degree of palindrome and restriction site avoidance is significantly and consistently less important in phages than in their bacterial hosts. This result brings to the fore a larger <b>selective</b> <b>load</b> for palindrome and restriction site avoidance on the bacterial hosts than on their infecting phages. It is then consistent with a view where type II RMSs are considered as parasites possibly at the verge of mutualism. As a consequence, RMSs constitute a nontrivial third player in the host–parasite relationship between bacteria and phages. Classic type II restriction modification systems (RMSs) comprise pairs of enzymes with matching DNA se-quence specificity. The modification enzyme is a DN...|$|R
40|$|Certain {{laboratory}} measurements {{require the}} use of a selective audio frequency amplifier. The limitations of physical size on conventional circuits become important in this frequency range. It is necessary to consider selectivity ease of tuning, economy of components, and stability, in the comparison of various types of amplifiers which operate in the range below 20, 000 cycles per second. At radio frequencies, use of the parallel resonant circuit as a <b>selective</b> <b>load</b> impedance for a vacuum tube is highly satisfactory. (Figure 1) When the frequency of resonance is decreased, the product of the inductance and capacitance must be increased inversely as the square of the frequency. It becomes difficult to produce variable condensers with a large enough capacity to cover the range desired. In order to obtain the required value of inductance, iron cored inductors must be used. These have greater losses than air cored inductances, and require careful design to avoid change of inductance due to variable permeability. It becomes essential at low audio frequencies to employ other circuits. Inverse feedback or degenerative amplifiers, (Figure 2) using selective networks that reject one frequency fulfill the requirements. The gain of a feedback amplifier is (la, 2 a) : G = A / 1 - ßA.

40|$|High {{precision}} {{demands in}} manual tasks {{can be expected}} to cause more selective use of a part of the muscular synergy involved. To test this expectation, load sharing of the index finger and middle finger was investigated during a pinching task. Myoelectric activation of lower arm and neck-shoulder muscles was measured to see if overall level of effort was affected by precision demands. Ten healthy female subjects performed pinching tasks with three levels of force and three levels of precision demands. The force level did not significantly affect the relative contribution of the index and middle finger to the force. Higher precision demands, however, led to higher contribution of the index finger to the pinch force. Consequently, a more <b>selective</b> <b>load</b> of the forearm and hand occurs during tasks with high precision demands. The variability of the force contribution of the fingers increased during the task. No effects of precision demand on the activation of forearm and neck-shoulder muscles were found. Force level did affect the EMG parameters of several muscles. The effects were most apparent in the muscles responsible for the pinch force, the forearm muscles. Activation of these muscles was higher at higher force levels. In the trapezius muscle at the dominant side EMG amplitudes were lower at the high pinch force compared to the low force and median force conditions. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.
