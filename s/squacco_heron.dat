50|$|The forest {{situated}} between Shishmantsi and Bolyarino is declared as protected territory, {{in order}} to preserve the location of very rare birds, such as little egret, <b>squacco</b> <b>heron,</b> black-crowned night heron, glossy ibis.|$|E
50|$|Veliko Blato is {{inhabited}} by 120 species of birds. There {{is a mixed}} colony of heron species which consists of little egrets, <b>squacco</b> <b>herons,</b> grey herons, night herons and purple herons. The colony was discovered only in June 2013 {{and is the only}} nesting heron colony on the urban territory of Belgrade, with several dozens of nesting couples. Other birds include Eurasian coot, great cormorant, pygmy cormorant, Caspian gull, black-headed gull, diving duck, common pochard, mallard, tufted duck. Largest European eagle, white-tailed eagle, nests in the other parts of Belgrade (Great War Island, Ada Huja), but feeds in the area. The lake is an internationally important area for the bird protection.|$|R
50|$|Nesting is {{critical}} to the survival of this species so its behaviour in this area is well studied. Nesting tends to be done along the coast and the foraging for food is performed well inland away from the nests. In fact, the closest that an individual heron will get to another apart from breeding is during roosting in their nests. Habitat degradation has resulted in closer roosting and has become integrated with other heron species such as Cattle Egrets and <b>Squacco</b> <b>Herons.</b>|$|R
40|$|Capsule A {{newly created}} wetland has been {{beneficial}} for the breeding of five heron species {{and for the}} settlement and expansion of Glossy Ibises in the region. Aim To determine whether created wetland {{would lead to the}} establishment of a heron and ibis breeding colony, and if so, to determine its effects on the distribution of these species in the wider region. Methods Number of pairs breeding at the new wetland and in the region were estimated annually from 1996 to 2008. We investigated whether the growth of the new colony was explained by redistribution of breeding pairs within the region. Results Purple <b>Herons,</b> <b>Squacco</b> <b>Herons</b> and Glossy Ibises colonised the new wetland in 1996. Black- crowned Night Herons settled in 1998, while Cattle and Little Egrets were the last species to establish in the mixed colony in 2001. The population increase was particularly marked for Glossy Ibises (which had bred in Don˜ana only sporadically through the 20 th century). Our findings suggest that simple redistribution of pairs does not explain the formation and growth of the new colony. Since the first year of establishment numbers of Glossy Ibises and Purple Herons have shown a significant growth trend at both the new colony and in Don˜ana. Conclusion The creation and management of a new wetland has been successful for the conservation of heron and egret species and promoted the expansion of the Glossy Ibis population across the western Mediterranean region.

50|$|Lesser-disturbed {{wetlands}} {{which are}} important breeding areas for many bird species are most significant biodiversity of the ecoregion. Examples are grey heron, purple heron, great egret, little egret, <b>squacco</b> <b>heron,</b> cattle egret, great bittern, little bittern, pygmy cormorant and ferruginous duck.|$|E
50|$|The <b>squacco</b> <b>heron</b> (Ardeola ralloides) {{is a small}} heron, 44 - 47 cm long, {{of which}} the body is 20 - 23 cm, with 80 - 92 cm wingspan. It is of Old World origins, {{breeding}} in southern Europe and the Greater Middle East.|$|E
50|$|Little egrets are sociable {{birds and}} are often seen in small flocks. Nevertheless, {{individual}} birds do not tolerate others coming too close to their chosen feeding site, though this depends on the abundance of prey. They {{use a variety of}} methods to procure their food; they stalk their prey in shallow water, often running with raised wings or shuffling their feet to disturb small fish, or may stand still and wait to ambush prey. They make use of opportunities provided by cormorants disturbing fish or humans attracting fish by throwing bread into water. On land they walk or run while chasing their prey, feed on creatures disturbed by grazing livestock and ticks on the livestock, and even scavenge. Their diet is mainly fish, but amphibians, small reptiles, mammals and birds are also eaten, as well as crustaceans, molluscs, insects, spiders and worms.Little egrets nest in colonies, often with other wading birds. On the coasts of western India these colonies may be in urban areas, and associated birds include cattle egrets (Bubulcus ibis), black-crowned night herons (Nycticorax nycticorax) and black-headed ibises (Threskiornis melanocephalus). In Europe, associated species may be <b>squacco</b> <b>herons</b> (Ardeola ralloides), cattle egrets, black-crowned night herons and glossy ibises (Plegadis falcinellus). The nests are usually platforms of sticks built in trees or shrubs, or in reed beds or bamboo groves. In some locations such as the Cape Verde Islands, the birds nest on cliffs. Pairs defend a small breeding territory, usually extending around 3 to 4 m from the nest. The three to five eggs are incubated by both adults for 21 to 25 days before hatching. They are oval in shape and have a pale, non-glossy, blue-green shell colour. The young birds are covered in white down feathers, are cared for by both parents and fledge after 40 to 45 days.|$|R
5000|$|The fishes of {{the lake}} are common carp and {{northern}} pike as well as Turkish crayfish. The birds {{of the lake}} are Eurasian bittern, Eurasian coot, Eurasian spoonbill, Ferruginous duck, greater sand plover, gull-billed tern, purple heron, pygmy cormorant, <b>squacco</b> <b>heron</b> and white-headed duck ...|$|E
5000|$|Blithfield {{reservoir}} walks give {{members of}} the public the chance to enjoy the area and its wildlife. [...] The reservoir has been visited by many scarce and rare migrant birds, including an inland Arctic warbler (1993), Bonaparte's gull (1994 and 1996), blue-winged teal (1996 and 2000) and <b>squacco</b> <b>heron</b> (2004).|$|E
5000|$|The ponds {{have become}} the most {{important}} bird overwintering area in Nottinghamshire for shoveler and diving ducks. The species count since 1966 is now over 250 bird species. [...] Among the nationally rare birds seen at the reserve are penduline tit (1994), <b>squacco</b> <b>heron</b> (1998 and 2011), purple heron (2003) and sora (2004).|$|E
50|$|The <b>squacco</b> <b>heron</b> is a migrant, {{wintering}} in Africa. It is rare {{north of}} its breeding range. This is a stocky species {{with a short}} neck, short thick bill and buff-brown back. In summer, adults have long neck feathers. Its appearance is transformed in flight, when it looks very white due to the colour of the wings.|$|E
50|$|Most {{shores of}} the lake are covered in {{submerged}} plants, {{and it has the}} most extensive white water lily beds in Turkey. Ulubat Lake is one of the breeding areas for the endangered pygmy cormorant (Phalacrocorax pygmeus). The latest DHKD (Society for the Protection of Nature Turkey) survey in June 1998 found 823 pygmy cormorant pairs, 105 night heron pairs, 109 <b>squacco</b> <b>heron</b> pairs, and 48 spoonbill pairs breeding on Ulubat.|$|E
50|$|Animals in {{the region}} include the Syrian brown bear, wild boar, gray wolf, the golden jackal, Indian crested porcupine, the red fox, goitered gazelle, Eurasian otter, striped hyena, Persian fallow deer, onager, mangar and the Euphrates {{softshell}} turtle. Bird species found {{in the region}} include, the Dead Sea sparrow, eastern rock nuthatch, European nightjar, hooded crow, masked shrike, Menetries's warbler, pale rockfinch, rufous-tailed scrub robin, see-see partridge and <b>squacco</b> <b>heron,</b> among others.|$|E
50|$|Lake Işıklı is an {{important}} site for breeding waterbirds and large numbers of wintering wildfowl. It has been proposed as an Important Bird Area. Some of the species that breed or migrate through Lake Işıklı are; greater white-fronted goose (Anser albifrons), red-crested pochard (Netta rufina), common pochard (Aythya ferina), ferruginous duck (Aythya nyroca), <b>squacco</b> <b>heron</b> (Ardeola ralloides), pygmy cormorant (Phalacrocorax pygmeus), common coot (Fulica atra), gull-billed tern (Sterna nilotica), whiskered tern (Chlidonias hybrida).|$|E
50|$|An equally {{dangerous}} {{threat to}} their survival is competition with the <b>squacco</b> <b>heron</b> which are spreading vigorously and also {{seem to be more}} adaptable to man-made structures and icons that encroach on their habitat. This form of heron greatly outnumbers the Malagasy pond heron in Madagascar and appears to have increased while endemic species has declined. Although they are vastly outnumbered, the Malagasy pond heron is presumed to dominate in the interspecific interactions.|$|E
50|$|They appear stocky {{with a short}} neck, short thick {{bill and}} buff-brown back. In summer, adults have long neck feathers. Its {{appearance}} is transformed from their dull colours when they take to flight, when {{the white of the}} wings makes them very prominent. It is very similar to the <b>squacco</b> <b>heron,</b> Ardeola ralloides, but is darker-backed. To the east of its range, it is replaced by the Chinese pond heron, Ardeola bacchus.|$|E
50|$|The {{order of}} Ciconiiformes is {{represented}} by birds like western reef heron (Egretta gularis), little egret (Egretta garzetta), woolly-necked stork (Ciconia episcopus), hammerkop (Scopus umbretta), <b>squacco</b> <b>heron</b> (Ardeola ralloides), little bittern (Ixobrychus minutus), Goliath heron (Ardea goliath), great egret (Egretta alba, marabou (Leptoptilos crumeniferus), night heron (Nycticorax nycticorax), grey heron (Ardea cinerea), cattle egret (Bubulcus ibis) and the sacred ibis (Threskiornis aethiopicus). With their long legs, this division of birds searches the river banks for food.|$|E
50|$|The Malagasy pond heron (Ardeola idae) is {{a species}} of heron {{belonging}} to the Ardeidae family. They are primarily seen in the outer islands of the Seychelles, Madagascar and countries {{on the east coast}} of Africa such as Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda. Being endemic to Madagascar, this species {{is often referred to as}} the Madagascar pond heron or Madagascar <b>squacco</b> <b>heron.</b> The population of this heron is estimated at 2,000-6,000 individuals, with only 1,300-4,000 being mature enough for reproductive activities.|$|E

50|$|This {{ecoregion}} is {{an important}} resting area for birds migrating between Russia and Africa and is thus a key habitat for many bird species. Some outstanding birds {{that can be found}} here are the greylag goose (Anser anser), white-fronted goose (Anser albifrons), Little bustard (Tetrax tetrax), glossy ibis (Plegadis falcinellus), Eurasian spoonbill (Platalea leucorodia), night heron (Nycticorax nycticorax), red-breasted goose (Branta ruficollis), peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus), Dalmatian pelican (Pelecanus crispus), buff-backed heron (Bubulcus ibis), <b>squacco</b> <b>heron</b> (Ardeola ralloides), greater flamingo (Phoenicopterus roseus), white-headed duck (Oxyura leucocephala), and Caspian snowcock (Tetraogallus caspius).|$|E
50|$|Pond herons (Ardeola) are herons, {{typically}} 40 - 50 cm {{long with}} an 80 - 100 cm wingspan. Most breed {{in the tropical}} Old World, but the migratory <b>squacco</b> <b>heron</b> occurs in southern Europe and the Middle East and winters in Africa. The scientific name comes from Latin ardeola, a small heron (ardea). These pond herons are stocky species with a short neck, short thick bill, typically buff or brownish back, and coloured or streaked fore neck and breast. In summer, adults may have long neck feathers. Ardeola herons are transformed in flight, looking very white due to the brilliant white wings.|$|E
5000|$|Actually, {{it is an}} {{important}} Special Protection Area (SPA) for wild birds. (In Spanish: Zona Especial de Protección para las Aves, ZEPA.) A lot of it -migrant o permanent birds- can be watched in the reservoir waters or nearness of it: white stork (Ciconia ciconia), lesser kestrel (Falco naumanni), purple heron (Ardea purpurea), <b>squacco</b> <b>heron</b> (Ardeola ralloides), black-crowned night heron (Nycticorax nycticorax), little bittern (Ixobrychus minutus), osprey (Pandion haliaetus), cattle egret (Bubulcus ibis), great cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo), purple swamphen (Porphyrio porphyrio). This is, perhaps, the bird symbol of Arrocampo Reservoir SPA). The list is practically endless.|$|E
50|$|This {{natural habitat}} is a reminiscence {{of the old}} swamps that covered these lands until the 8th century. The lush {{vegetation}} represents a very good camouflage during the nesting season, and the reservation is home to large numbers of protected birds including the pied avocet (Recurvirostra avosetta), the little egret (Egretta garzetta), the great egret (Egretta alba), the black-winged stilt (Himantopus himantopus), the grey heron (Ardea cinerea), the <b>squacco</b> <b>heron</b> (Ardeola ralloides), the little bittern(Ixobrychus minutus), the purple heron (Ardea purpurea) and the black-crowned night heron (Nycticorax nycticorax).Foxes, rabbits, deers and wild boars can also be seen.|$|E
5000|$|It {{is one of}} six {{species of}} birds known as [...] "pond herons" [...] (genus Ardeola). It is parapatric (or nearly so) with the Indian pond heron (A. grayii) {{to the west and}} the Javan pond heron (A. speciosa) to the south, and these three are presumed to form a superspecies. As a group they are {{variously}} affiliated with the <b>squacco</b> <b>heron</b> (A. ralloides) or the Malagasy pond heron (A. idae). As of mid-2011 there are no published molecular analyses of pond heron interrelationships and osteological data is likewise not analyzed for all relevant comparison taxa.|$|E
50|$|The {{probability}} of long-time isolation from other wetlands {{is suggested by}} a fish endemic to the lake, the Jipe tilapia. Jipe's waters are teeming with big fish, principally siluriforms and cyprinoids. Jipe forms a biodiversity rich ecosystem also known for the water birds that frequent its reedy shores; these include storks, egrets, pelicans, spur-winged plovers, ducks, and Egyptian geese. Lesser jacana and the purple gallinule are common on the lake despite being rare {{in other parts of}} Africa and Madagascar <b>squacco</b> <b>heron,</b> black heron, African darter and African skimmers are often seen. The vicinity of the lake is frequented by herds of game. Hippopotami and crocodiles are plentiful.|$|E
50|$|According to the Bulgarian Society for the Protection of Birds, {{the island}} {{is one of the}} five most {{important}} nesting areas in the country for the great cormorant, the black-crowned night heron and the common spoonbill, making it a site of international ornithological importance. A total of 21 nationally protected species nidificate on the island. Of the 75 bird species that can be observed on Vardim Island, 31 are of European importance: 2 fall into category SPEC1, 11 in SPEC2 and 18 in SPEC3. The sea eagle can be seen on the island, and until 1985 other species to be observed on it included the <b>squacco</b> <b>heron,</b> glossy ibis and pygmy cormorant.|$|E
50|$|It nests {{along the}} margins of flood plains, usually when the water inundates the forests. It appears to prefer thicket {{vegetation}} in which it nests solitarily or in small groups. Although not usual, they have been seen to nest near <b>squacco</b> <b>heron</b> and rufous-bellied heron. The nest is a platform of twigs lined with coarse grass, 23 x 38 cm across and 7 cm deep. The nest is placed near the central trunk of the tree, on a branch or in bushes overhanging the water, at a height of over 0.5 - 4 m above the water. They often use thorn bushes for nesting. The dwarf bittern builds its nest quickly (Tarboton 1980).|$|E
50|$|There are 28 {{species of}} trees. The lake's easily visible {{wildlife}} include birds, freshwater fish, reptiles, and mammals. Reptiles {{found in the}} park include the Iberian emerald lizard, the ocellated lizard, and Mediterranean pond turtles. Mammals that reached it were the southwestern water voles and weasels. Common and easily visible birds are mallards, Egyptian geese, great cormorants, domestic geese and swans, much of which bred in the park. Other common species include blackbirds, the moorhen, the coot, the black-winged stilt, the magpie, and several other species. Making it a spot for birdwatchers who photograph other species such as the <b>squacco</b> <b>heron,</b> the cattle egret, the hoopoe, the gadwall, the northern shoveler, the wryneck, and the tufted duck.|$|E
50|$|The {{breeding}} of the Malagasy pond heron is colonial meaning {{that a large}} congregation occurs at a particular location for mating. However, both colony size and location numbers have dwindled over the past thirty years. Colony size has dropped from 700 individuals to around 50 whilst breeding locations are limited to only a few colony sites. In Madagascar, colonies are located in phragmite reedbeds, typha, papyrus and Cyprus stands with coastal islands being of extreme importance also. Moreover, breeding in Madagascar results in a mixed colony of heron species that include {{but are not limited}} to the Black Crowned Night heron, Little egret, Cattle egret, Great egrets and the <b>Squacco</b> <b>heron.</b> The largest colony of the Malagasy pond heron on record was around 500 pairs in Imerimanjaka Cyperus marsh, near Antananarivo. These 500 pairs were also mixed with 1,500 pairs of Squacco herons resulting in the largest breeding colony of African herons in 1940. Unfortunately, current day pairs usually never exceed 10.|$|E
50|$|The {{wetlands}} at {{and near}} the delta of the Ural River are especially important to migrating birds as an important stop-over along the Asian flyway. They host many endemic and endangered species, such as great white pelican, Dalmatian pelican, pygmy cormorant, cattle egret, little egret, greater flamingo, white-headed duck, ferruginous duck, Eurasian spoonbill, glossy ibis, houbara bustard, great black-headed gull, slender-billed gull, <b>squacco</b> <b>heron,</b> common crane, demoiselle crane, slender-billed curlew, black stork, red-breasted goose, lesser white-fronted goose, lesser kestrel, whooper swan, tundra swan, osprey, pallid harrier, short-toed eagle and many others. The pygmy cormorant was observed sporadically before 1999 and more regularly after that. Cattle egret is observed since 1990 between April and September (as most other migratory birds in this area), with {{the total population of}} several dozen couples. It feeds on frogs, mollusks and small fish. Upstream, there are more of the stationary bird species, such as grouse, wild pigeon and partridge.|$|E
50|$|Various aquatic species {{exist in}} the lagoons such as eels, grey mullet, fresh water shrimp and above all the Spanish toothcarp which is endemic to the Spanish Mediterranean region. But without any doubt the parks best known feature is the bird life. The most notable of the many species present in the park are the marbled duck and the white-headed duck with the park {{containing}} two of the largest worldwide populations. A large number of herons are present during the breeding season particularly the purple heron, the night heron and the <b>squacco</b> <b>heron.</b> It is also possible to find other species such as the avocet, the black-winged stilt, the collared pratincole, the crested coot, the European penduline tit and the moustached warbler. Birds of prey include osprey, marsh harrier and (in winter) greater spotted eagle. An Estonia-born greater spotted eagle wearing a transmitter has been hibernating {{in the park and}} its surroundings each winter since 2008/2009.|$|E
50|$|The {{swamps and}} wetland {{forests of the}} park contain a number of {{endangered}} species such as roe deer, boar, otter and Triturus vittatus, and more recently a population of coypu has been introduced. It {{is home to the}} Caucasian subspecies of common treefrog and lake frog and numerous types of snake, including ring snake, dice snake, slowworm, and more rarely the Aesculapian snake. The European marsh turtle and Artwin wood lizard are also found as are common and eastern crested newts. Several species of dolphins including Delphinus delphis, Tursiops truncates and Phocoena phocoena inhabit the marine habitat of the park while 194 different bird species are found in the national park, including 21 species who use the area during seasonal migration. Some of the birds endemic to the park are on the IUCN and Georgian Red Book list because they are verging on extinction in the area, including the black stork, crane and great white egret. The great crested grebe, red-necked grebe, black-necked grebe, great cormorant, <b>squacco</b> <b>heron,</b> Eurasian spoonbill, glossy ibis, lesser white-fronted goose, ruddy shelduck, marsh sandpiper, great snipe, and a diversity of ducks, waders, coots, gulls and terns are common to the park during season and a number of white-tailed sea eagles have been recorded in the park, although these are very rare.|$|E
50|$|During construction, the Welsh Harp {{attracted}} uncommon birds. James Edmund Harting and Frederick Bond were regular {{visitors and}} shot many birds. Harting documented these in his 1866 book the Birds of Middlesex. They included rare vagrants to the UK such as little bittern, <b>squacco</b> <b>heron</b> and white-rumped sandpiper. This started {{an interest in}} the birds of the Welsh Harp that continues until today, giving a unique historical perspective of a site in London. The next prominent ornithologist was William Glegg from the 1920s onwards and he wrote a paper for the London Naturalist in 1930 called 'The Birds of Middlesex since 1866, then a follow-up book to Harting's in 1935, called A History of the Birds of Middlesex. After the Second World War, a new generation of ornithologists took an interest, such as Professor Warmington, and Eric Simms, who lived just south of the reservoir in Dollis Hill. They were joined by Dr Leo Batten in the late 1950s. He still visits the reservoir today {{and was one of the}} movers in setting up the Welsh Harp Conservation Group (WHCG) in 1972 to fight off development. The WHCG has worked to protect the area as a nature reserve, including preventing a golf course and driving range from being built. The WHCG produces an annual report and also published a book about the reservoir - Birds of Brent Reservoir - in 2000, which includes chapters on the social history, the effects of urbanisation, the habitats, as well as a study of the birds and other wildlife. The WHCG organise management work, such as annual refurbishment of the tern rafts and work with Brent and Barnet councils on site management, including applying for National Lottery bids.|$|E
