Meucci has been further credited with the invention of an anti-sidetone circuit. However, examination showed that his solution to <b>sidetone</b> was to maintain two separate telephone circuits and thus use twice as many transmission wires.

50|$|<b>Sidetone</b> is {{valuable}} for the hearing impaired. The amount of <b>sidetone</b> typically found on land-lines is 8%, and is 4% for cellular phones. <b>Sidetone</b> can be, and often is, amplified for land-line phones for the hearing impaired. In VOIP {{technologies such as}} Skype, <b>sidetone</b> has been experimented with but has not been formally adopted by software or hardware & accessories creators. Several software packages and wiring workarounds have been developed that replicate <b>sidetone,</b> but feedback looping remains a problem.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sidetone</b> is {{also used}} on voice radio {{equipment}} to give the radio operator confidence that they are transmitting over the radio. The <b>sidetone</b> audio is typically derived from the transmit audio circuitry.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—In an {{opportunistic}} dynamic spectrum access environment, individual nodes {{sense the}} local spectrum and choose their operating frequencies and bandwidth {{in collaboration with}} the other participating nodes. To make their spectrum access decisions, the nodes need to communicate with the existing nodes operating in the area. In this paper we propose an approach which establishes this first connection with a minimum risk of interference. We propose a link rendezvous strategy which relies on frequency domain decision statistics. Nodes wishing to join the network are emitting and scanning for a simple carrier with a small number of <b>sidetones.</b> We describe the strategy in the context of collaborative spectrum sensing. To validate our approach, we describe a series of experiments using the GNU Radio software defined radio toolkit. We show that an attention signal of length equivalent to a single FFT frame can be detected in a high noise environment using two <b>sidetones.</b> Index Terms—Dynamic spectrum allocation, link rendezvous and evolution I...|$|R
40|$|The {{wideband}} FM {{scheme for}} the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite (TDRS) system is discussed. The technique achieves a spread-spectrum advantage against multipath and interference through {{the inclusion of}} a large deviation FM subcarrier. The signal also permits co-channel spread-spectrum multipath access (SSMA) on the downlink from mission spacecraft to TDRS. Each user is assigned a unique combination of carrier and subcarrier which allows the ground receiver to separate user signals with overlapping spectra. The system was modified by the addition of a low-deviation fine range tone to both the uplink and the downlink, separate from the wide-deviation subcarrier. The magnitude of the interference components due to other SSMA signals are analyzed. A carrier and subcarrier frequency plan was worked out based on the modified signal format. A configuration to accommodate 42 and 60 users is described. The inclusion of ambiguity resolving ranging <b>sidetones</b> is also discussed...|$|R
50|$|<b>Sidetone</b> in 19th century {{telephones}} varied {{until the}} carbon transmitter was used, which produced a distinct <b>sidetone</b> that discouraged speaking loudly enough, and occasionally so loud as {{to cause the}} instrument to produce uncontrolled oscillations, resulting in howling audio effects. <b>Sidetone</b> is disabled when phones of any kind are running in speakerphone mode, due to perpetual and almost immediate feedback. Anti-sidetone circuitry incorporating {{the principle of the}} hybrid coil brought <b>sidetone</b> under control in the early 20th century, leaving enough feedback signal to assure the user that the phone is really working, and allowing the use of a unitized telephone handset. In cellular technologies, one of the many benefits of sidetone-enabled phones is that a user knows a call has been dropped or ended if he or she no longer hears <b>sidetone.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In {{wireless}} telegraphy (WT) and amateur radio, <b>sidetone</b> is the audible {{indication of a}} continuous wave (CW) signal as the operator sends Morse Code. As in telephony, <b>sidetone</b> serves as feedback to the operator that what they are sending is what is intended.|$|E
5000|$|Almost all {{land-line}} (wired and wireless) phones {{have employed}} <b>sidetone,</b> so naturally {{it was an}} expected convention for cellular telephony but is not standard by any means. Usability experts believe that lack of adequate <b>sidetone</b> causes some people to shout or speak too loudly when using a cell phone (this behavior is {{sometimes referred to as}} [...] "cell yell").|$|E
50|$|Another hurdle to the {{acceptance}} of a common handset model was that audio from the receiver was picked up acoustically by the transmitter and amplified, resulting in howling tones, called acoustic feedback, due to the hollow handles providing an acoustic channel between receiver and transmitter. The problems were aggravated by the signal boosting circuitry used in the subscriber set {{which resulted in a}} strong signal (<b>sidetone)</b> at the receiver of the speech of the user. <b>Sidetone</b> is desirable only to some fraction of volume so that the user has the assurance that the telephone is working correctly. Strong <b>sidetone</b> may cause users to lower the voice to unacceptable levels, so that the recipient receives insufficient signal level.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Sidetone</b> is audible {{feedback}} {{to someone who}} is speaking. The term is most used in the telecommunication field.|$|E
50|$|Concurrently to the {{mechanical}} advances, the electronic makeup of Western Electric telephones saw advances in <b>sidetone</b> reduction. <b>Sidetone</b> is an electronic feedback phenomenon {{by which the}} users of the telephone would hear their own voice very loudly in the receiver. This caused most users to lower their voice volume to unacceptable levels. The first production volumes of both the B1 and D1 mounts contained only the older electronics, without <b>sidetone</b> suppression. Such telephone models where designated with the assembly code 102 (Model 102 telephone), while later models starting in 1930, containing anti-sidetone circuitry, were the Model 202 telephone set. These early desktop telephones {{did not have any}} electronics within the mounting base itself, but instead relied on an external subscriber set (subset) containing the ringer with gongs, and the electronics (induction coils, capacitors) to interface with the telephone network. These subscriber sets were typically mounted on a wall near the operating location for the phone.|$|E
50|$|A similar {{concept is}} that of <b>sidetone,</b> the effect of sound that is {{picked up by a}} telephone's {{mouthpiece}} and introduced (at low level) into the earpiece of the same handset, acting as feedback.|$|E
5000|$|In telephony, <b>sidetone</b> is {{the effect}} of sound picked up by the telephone's {{transmitter}} (mouthpiece) and instantly introduced at a low electronic signal level into the receiver (earpiece) of the same handset, a form of feedback.|$|E

50|$|When a commentator, announcer, or MC for {{a public}} event may {{otherwise}} {{be able to hear}} their own voice in the delayed output from the loudspeakers, they may opt to use a headset which provides instant <b>sidetone</b> of their own voice, thus removing the distracting effect of greatly delayed feedback from the loudspeakers.|$|E
5000|$|Audio {{frequency}} {{receiver output}} and modulator <b>sidetone</b> impedance for the ARA/ATA and the AN/ARC-5 is 300 to 600 ohms. In the SCR-274-N [...] "-A" [...] version, {{the receiver and}} modulator impedance is 4000 ohms, while [...] "-B" [...] and later version units have a 250 ohm tap on the AF transformers which can be connected.|$|E
50|$|The 102 {{telephone}} {{was plagued}} by problems with excessive <b>sidetone,</b> resulting in a poor experience for users hearing their own voice very loudly, and in extreme cases in early versions also unstable feedback from the receiver into the transmitter. This resulted in users lowering their voice {{to the point where}} the other party found them difficult to hear. This problem was resolved when the 102 was upgraded in approximately 1930 to the 202 telephone.|$|E
50|$|The model 202 {{telephone}} was {{a desktop}} telephone produced by Western Electric from 1930 through ca. 1937, {{as well as}} by Northern Electric in Canada. Refurbished units appeared into the 1950s. It was {{a modified version of the}} 102-type telephone, and contained newly developed anti-sidetone circuitry to reduce electronic feedback from the transmitter (mouthpiece) to the receiver (earpiece). This <b>sidetone</b> created an unpleasant experience for users, hearing their own voice very loudly, and causing them to lower their own speech volume to unacceptable levels.|$|E
50|$|Delayed Auditory Feedback (DAF), {{also called}} delayed <b>sidetone,</b> {{is a type}} of altered {{auditory}} feedback that consists of extending the time between speech and auditory perception. It can consist of a device that enables a user to speak into a microphone and then hear his or her voice in headphones {{a fraction of a second}} later. Some DAF devices are hardware; DAF computer software is also available. Most delays that produce a noticeable effect are between 50-200ms. DAF usage (with a 175 millisecond delay) has been shown to induce mental stress.|$|E
50|$|In {{aviation}} the loudness of the <b>sidetone</b> {{heard in}} a pilot's helmet or headset may be adjusted to suit personal comfort, although this may lead to communication problems since the pilot will be largely unaware of how his transmission sounds to the recipient. The ideal level for the right psychoacoustic behaviour {{is reported to be}} about 7dB below the received audio, according to RTCA specification DO-214. If the headset signal level is set too high, the pilot will inevitably speak more softly, resulting in too low a level of modulation to the radio transmitter.|$|E
50|$|In use, the B-type {{telephone}} base proved unstable during dialing, and {{was replaced}} with the D-type handset mounting in 1930. A wider, oval base improved its stability. While the D1 mounting base was initially deployed electrically identical to the prior models, advances in the anti-sidetone audio circuitry soon reached production quality, so that D1 sets are most commonly identified as the 202-type telephone. The assembly codes 102 and 202 referred whence to the electrical capabilities of the sets, the 102 having no <b>sidetone</b> reduction, and the 202 containing the anti-sidetone improvements. Thus, {{some of the early}} oval D mounts, would still be designated as model 102 if they did not yet have the anti-sidetone circuitry.|$|E
50|$|The first {{versions}} of the 202 were produced by installing into existing model 102s newly developed circuitry that electrically cancels a major fraction of <b>sidetone</b> feedback into the receiver. The first generation of 102 and 202-type telephones featured a circular base, {{referred to as the}} B1 handset mounting. It was a redesigned shape of its predecessor the A1 which was a direct derivative of the candlestick telephone with a shortened vertical shaft. The circular base proved unstable during dialing, and therefore a new, wider, elliptical base was developed and introduced in 1930, referred to as the D1 mounting. This new D1 base remained the handset mounting paired with the E1 handset {{for the remainder of the}} 202 production run.|$|E
50|$|The cradle can {{accommodate}} the earlier F1 handset from the 302 or the newer, wider G-type of the 500. A special G-type handset, {{commonly referred to}} as GF but labeled G1, produced for the model 5302 consisted of Bakelite and was completed by August 1955. It used an F1 transmitter and contained a plastic insert to allow for the use of an HA receiver, as in the 302. The use of the old transmitter and receiver avoided elevating <b>sidetone</b> on short loops as was the result with the more efficient G handset when used without equalization circuitry. When issued with the G1 handset, as in the 500 model phone, the handset contained U1 and T1 elements.|$|E
5000|$|In telephony, [...] "echo" [...] is {{very much}} like what one would {{experience}} yelling in a canyon. Echo is the reflected copy of one's voice heard some time later and a delayed version of the original. On a telephone, if the delay is fairly significant (more than a few hundred milliseconds), it is considered annoying. If the delay is very small (10s of milliseconds or less), the phenomenon is called <b>sidetone,</b> and while not objectionable to humans, can interfere with the communication between data modems. If the delay is slightly longer, around 50 milliseconds, humans cannot hear the echo as a distinct sound, but instead hear a chorus effect which sounds like talking in a tunnel or cave.|$|E
50|$|A major {{expense of}} {{wire-line}} telephone service is the outside wire plant. Telephones transmit both the incoming and outgoing speech signals on {{a single pair of}} wires. A twisted pair line rejects electromagnetic interference (EMI) and crosstalk better than a single wire or an untwisted pair. The strong outgoing speech signal from the microphone (transmitter) does not overpower the weaker incoming speaker (receiver) signal with <b>sidetone</b> because a hybrid coil (A3) and other components compensate the imbalance. The junction box (B) arrests lightning (B2) and adjusts the line's resistance (B1) to maximize the signal power for the line length. Telephones have similar adjustments for inside line lengths (A8). The line voltages are negative compared to earth, to reduce galvanic corrosion. Negative voltage attracts positive metal ions toward the wires.|$|E
50|$|Telephone systems {{also use}} matched {{impedances}} to minimise echo on long-distance lines. This {{is related to}} transmission-line theory. Matching also enables the telephone hybrid coil (2- to 4-wire conversion) to operate correctly. As the signals are sent and received on the same two-wire circuit to the central office (or exchange), cancellation is necessary at the telephone earpiece so excessive <b>sidetone</b> is not heard. All devices used in telephone signal paths are generally dependent on matched cable, source and load impedances. In the local loop, the impedance chosen is 600 ohms (nominal). Terminating networks are installed at the exchange to offer the best match to their subscriber lines. Each country has its own standard for these networks, but they are all designed to approximate about 600 ohms over the voice frequency band.|$|E
5000|$|A {{telephone}} hook or switchhook is {{an electrical}} switch which indicates {{when the phone}} is hung up, often with a lever or magnetic button inside the cradle or base where a telephone handset resides. It {{takes its name from}} old wooden wall telephones and candlestick telephones, where the mouthpiece was mounted on the telephone box and, due to <b>sidetone</b> considerations, the receiver was separate, on a cable. When the telephone was not in use, the receiver was hung on a spring-loaded hook; its weight would cause the hook to swing down and open an electrical contact, disconnecting something, but not the telephone from the line or the phone could not ring. When the handset is on the cradle, the telephone is said to be [...] "on-hook", or ready for a call. When the handset is off the cradle, the telephone is said to be [...] "off-hook", or unable to receive any (further) calls.|$|E
50|$|To equip US Army Air Corps planes, the US Army {{adopted in}} 1941 a reduced set of radios from the ARA/ATA range. Designated SCR-274-N, these Army radios were {{electrically}} {{almost identical to}} their ARA/ATA counterparts, except for receiver output and modulator <b>sidetone</b> audio transformer output impedance. Structurally and in appearance, they were virtually identical except for most later units being left unpainted aluminum {{in contrast to the}} black wrinkle finish of the Navy sets. The designation SCR-274-N is a pre-World War II Army equipment nomenclature. The Army never acquired the ARA 1.5 to 3.0 MHz receiver, nor the ATA 2.1 to 3.0 MHz transmitter. Initially, it did not acquire the 3.0 to 4.0 MHz transmitter, nor the 0.52 to 1.5 MHz receiver, but the need to communicate on the common civil airfield frequency of 3.105 MHz plus the anticipated USAAF use of the AN/ARR-1 homing adapter (see below) compelled adding these units to the SCR-274-N. Early Army units were made by Aircraft Radio Corporation, but the vast majority was made by Western Electric, plus a few by Colonial Radio and others.|$|E
50|$|When Western Electric had {{sufficiently}} developed modern handset {{design in}} the 1920s, the Western Electric candlesticks were superseded {{by a series of}} new desktop models, starting with the A1 mount in the mid 1920s. This was essentially a candlestick telephone that had its vertical tube-shaft shortened to about 1+1/2 in in height above the round base, and had a cradle on top of it, designed to hold a combined handset with both the receiver and the transmitter in the same unit. The cradle contained a plunger that operated the hookswitch in the base below. The A1 was only distributed for a very short time until the B-type telephone mount (model 102 telephone) was completed in 1927, a streamlined design that replaced the tube-shaft with a sculpted cone shape. By 1930 this round base was redesigned into the oval-footprint D-mounting to avoid instability of the unit when dialing. At the same time the electric circuitry was upgraded to produce the model 202 telephone, which reduced the strong <b>sidetone</b> characteristic of earlier designs.|$|E
5000|$|Telephone hybrids {{are used}} in {{telephone}} exchanges to convert the 4-wire appearance to the 2-wire last mile connection to the subscriber's telephone. A different kind of hybrid is used in telephone handsets to convert the four wires of the transmitter (earpiece) and receiver (microphhone) to the 2-wire line connection. This kind of hybrid is more commonly called an induction coil due to its derivation from high-voltage induction coils. It does not produce a high voltage, but like the high-voltage variety, it is a step-up transformer in order to impedance match the low-impedance carbon button transmitter to the higher impedance parts of the system. The simple induction coil later evolved into a form of hybrid as a <b>sidetone</b> reduction measure, or volume of microphone output that was fed back to the earpiece. Without this, the phone user's own voice would be louder in the earpiece than the other party's. [...] Today, the transformer version of the hybrid {{has been replaced by}} resistor networks and compact IC versions, which use integrated circuit electronics to do the job of the hybrid coil.|$|E
50|$|The new {{millennium}} brought {{the next big}} development for Setcom, {{the creation of the}} SuperMic. Not only did this development introduce a sleeker version of the typical police shoulder-microphone, it was a safer alternative, designed to auto-sync and move with the officer as multiple duties were performed. After its introduction in 2002 the SuperMic {{became one of the most}} popular communication devices used by motor officers throughout the US. Wireless communication for motor officers came about in the early 2000s and in 2005 Setcom launched the Liberator Wireless system. Converting to this wireless system allowed motor officers with a portable radio to take away the cable connecting them to their motorcycle, creating a much safer riding environment. New features such as waterproofing and <b>sidetone,</b> a feature allowing users to hear their own voice transmissions especially when travelling at high speeds, were continually added to the Liberator system to make it safer and easier to use. 2009 brought the launch of Setcom’s new wireless system, the Liberator Wireless for mobile-portable radios. This system seamlessly allowed for rapid transition from using the mobile radio while on the motorcycle to using the portable radio while off the motorcycle.|$|E
50|$|The 300 series {{equipment}} {{was introduced in}} 1937. The Tele. 332 ASTIC, Handset Micro Telephone was the standard telephone instrument issued by the GPO from 1937 until 1959, although 242Ls continued to be supplied for pay-on-answer kiosks. Essentially it was a redesign of the 232/bellset 26 combo. The term ASTIC indicates {{the use of an}} anti-sidetone induction coil, to permit only a small, controlled amount of speech signal back to the talker's ear to provide necessary <b>sidetone</b> for a natural communication experience. It continued in production until the mid-1960s. This was usually only available in black although ivory, red and, the especially rare, green were also produced. Although 332 is the generic for this model, by dint of superior numbers, there were four other models in the range. The glossy, sharp styled 332 gestated from the much poorer quality 330. Though similar, the quality and finish of the 330s moulding was poor, by comparison. Then there were the button phones. A 332 with the facility for one button is a 312, two buttons a 328 and three buttons a 314. For this reason, in the photos below the instrument on the left is, strictly speaking, a 314 and the one on the right a 312, despite the fact that their full potential is not being utilised.The Tele. 332L shown on the left is a bedside extension from an Extension Plan 1A. Note the addition of the BELL ON - BELL OFF push buttons, forward of the switchook cradle. The centre button position is filled with a blanking stud and only a 2 way label is installed. The instrument on the right is a Tele 312, but has its single button hole fitted with a blanking stud. The label screws are sitting redundant in their holes.|$|E
40|$|In {{our field}} {{deployments}} of mobile remote presence (MRP) systems in offices, we observed that remote operators of MRPs often unintentionally spoke too loudly. This disrupted their local co-workers, {{who happened to}} be within earshot of the MRP system. To address this issue, we prototyped and em-pirically evaluated the effect of <b>sidetone</b> to help operators self regulate their speaking loudness. <b>Sidetone</b> is the inten-tional, attenuated feedback of speakers ’ voices to their ears while they are using a telecommunication device. In a 3 -level (no <b>sidetone</b> vs. low <b>sidetone</b> vs. high <b>sidetone)</b> within-participants pair of experiments, people interacted with a con-federate through an MRP system. The first experiment in-volved MRP operators using headsets with boom microphones (N= 20). The second experiment involved MRP operators us-ing loudspeakers and desktop microphones (N= 14). While we detected the effects of the <b>sidetone</b> manipulation in our audio-visual context, the effect was attenuated in compari-son to earlier audio-only studies. We hypothesize that the strong visual component of our MRP system interferes with the <b>sidetone</b> effect. We also found that engaging in more social tasks (e. g., a getting-to-know-you activity) and more intellectually demanding tasks (e. g., a creativity exercise) in-fluenced how loudly people spoke. This suggests that test-ing such <b>sidetone</b> effects in the typical read-aloud setting is insufficient for generalizing to more interactive, communica-tion tasks. We conclude that MRP application support must reach beyond the time honored audio-only technologies {{to solve the problem of}} excessive speaker loudness...|$|E
40|$|An {{algorithm}} for {{detection and}} cancellation of <b>sidetone</b> oscillations in mobile phones is presented. The <b>sidetone</b> signal {{is represented by}} a 4 th order LPC polynomial, whose root structure is analysed by a computationally efficient twostage approach. In difference to LMS based adaptive filters this approach offers a fast and reliable detection of evolving oscillations. A notch filter with small bandwidth is used for cancellation and therefore almost no distortion is introduced to the speech signal. 1...|$|E
40|$|A {{distinction}} is proposed between auditory feedback effects and <b>sidetone</b> effects. Audi-tory feedback effects involve variations in self-hearing that are contingent upon initial speech behaviour. These effects impair speech. <b>Sidetone</b> effects involve variations in, or supplements to, self-hearing {{that are not}} contingent upon initial speech behaviour. Side-tones, in contrast to feedbacks, tend to enhance speech. However, the two have been conceptualized together by assimilating <b>sidetone</b> effects to feedback effects. This {{has led to a}} failure to recognize that sidetones can enhance, rather than impair, speech intelligibility. It is argued here that it is the contingency of the variation in the true feedbacks that makes them disruptive, while the noncontingency of the variation in the sidetones increases the overall level of auditory interference and enhances speakers ’ intelligibility as they try to overcome it. This proposition was tested by comparing contingent and noncontingent forms of a self-hearing variation, laryngeal self-hearing (LSH). LSH is obtained by recording the signal from laryngograph electrodes and returning it in audible form to the speaker. In Experiment I, phoneticians judged speech produced with contingent LSH to be more abnormal than speech with noncontingent LSH. In Experiment II, a panel of lay listener...|$|E
