40|$|Abstract — Gasification {{of biomass}} and coal is an {{attractive}} technology for {{combined heat and power}} production, as well as for synthesis processes such as the production of liquid and gaseous biofuels. The allothermal steam blown gasification process yields a high calorific product gas, practically free of nitrogen. Originally, the system was designed for biogeneous fuels and residues but it can also handle a large number of other fuels such as several types of coal. To demonstrate the influence on the system performance of hard coal {{as an example of a}} <b>solid</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>fuel</b> a fuel blend of wood pellets and hard coal was fed into the DFB gasifier. The fuel blend ratio was 20 % coal in terms of energy. The DFB pilot plant was operated at a fuel power of 78 kW and a steam to fuel ratio of 1. 0 kg/kgdb during the investigations. The system was operated at gasification temperatures between 830 and 870 °C.

50|$|The {{interest}} in co-firing {{and the use}} of this term sprung up in the 1980s in the U.S. and Europe, and referred specifically to the use of waste solid residues (paper, plastic, solvents, tars, etc.) or biomass in coal power stations that were designed only for the combustion of coal, and attempted, because of the existence of those new opportunity fuels, to carry out a combined combustion in order to increase benefit margins. This {{interest in}} co-firing has grown in the last decade mainly due to increasing social concern about global warming and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The consequences of this concern are new policies on energy and the environment aimed at reducing emissions. Co-firing is regarded as a great opportunity for replacing coal (<b>solid</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>fuel)</b> used for power generation with renewable fuels (biomass) with lower costs and a direct decrease in greenhouse gas emissions. During the last few decades research has provided very diverse solutions for co-firing biomass in coal power stations with a limited impact on efficiency, operation and lifespan.|$|R

40|$|Oil shale is an {{important}} energy resource alternative. Despite its recognition as an unconventional oil source, oil shale is also considered as {{an important}} <b>solid</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>fuel</b> alternative to coal and lignites due to the solid form and remarkable extent of organic content. Utilization possibilites, similar to coal and lignites, have been considered in the past decades and direct use of oil shales in thermal power production has been possible in countries like Estonia and China. In the perspective of utilization of oil shales {{in a similar manner}} to coal and lignites, problems and restrictions related to the inorganic ash-making and potentially pollutant constituents are applied. In this respect, cleaning of this important energy source through mineral processing methods, particularly by flotation, is an outstanding option. However, on the basis of unique features and distinctive characteristics, treatment of oil shales like a type of coal is a big perception and may be highly misleading. This paper discusses specific challenges regarding flotation behavior of oil shales with reference to the surface characteristics and behavior of oil shale entities – probably the most important aspect that determines the efficiency and success of the flotation based cleaning process...|$|R

This thesis utilizes Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) with extensive PAH datasets, and compares the results with local and national emission inventories. An atmospheric chemical reactivity study for PAH is also investigated; highlighting the importance of taking reactivity into consideration when applying source apportionment models.

40|$|An {{extended}} {{overview of}} the chemical composition of biomass was conducted. The general considerations and some problems related to biomass and particularly the composition of this fuel are discussed. Reference peer-reviewed data for chemical composition of 86 varieties of biomass, including traditional and complete proximate, ultimate and ash analyses (21 characteristics), were {{used to describe the}} biomass system. It was shown that the chemical composition of biomass and especially ash components are highly variable due to the extremely high variations of moisture, ash yield, and different genetic types of inorganic matter in biomass. However, when the proximate and ultimate data are recalculated respectively on dry and dry ash-free basis, the characteristics show quite narrow ranges. In decreasing order of abundance, the elements in biomass are commonly C, O, H, N, Ca, K, Si, Mg, Al, S, Fe, P, Cl, Na, Mn, and Ti. It was identified that the chemical distinctions among the specified natural and anthropogenic biomass groups and sub-groups are significant and they are related to different biomass sources and origin, namely from plant and animal products or from mixtures of plant, animal, and manufacture materials. Respective chemical data for 38 <b>solid</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>fuels</b> were also applied as subsidiary information for clarifying the biomass composition and for comparisons. It was found that the chemical composition of natural biomass system is simpler than that of <b>solid</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>fuels.</b> However, the semi-biomass system is quite complicated as a result of incorporation of various non-biomass materials during biomass processing. It was identified that the biomass composition is significantly different from that of coal and the variations among biomass composition were also found to be greater than for coal. Natural biomass is: (1) highly enriched in Mn > K > P > Cl > Ca > (Mg, Na) > O > moisture > volatile matter; (2) slightly enriched in H; and (3) depleted in ash, Al, C, Fe, N, S, Si, and Ti in comparison with coal. The correlations and associations among 20 chemical characteristics are also studied to find some basic trends and important relationships occurring in the natural biomass system. As a result of that five strong and important associations, namely: (1) C¿H; (2) N¿S¿Cl; (3) Si¿Al¿Fe¿Na¿Ti; (4) Ca¿Mg¿Mn; and (5) K¿P¿S¿Cl; were identified and discussed.

However, the technical options for the reduction of CO 2 emissions will define the extent of their share in the future energy mix. The production of synthetic or substitute natural gas (SNG) from <b>solid</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>fuels</b> seems to be a very attractive process: coal and lignite can be upgraded into a methane rich gas which can be transported and further used in high efficient power systems coupled with CO 2 sequestration technologies. The aim of this paper is to present a modeling analysis comparison between substitute natural gas production from coal by means of allothermal steam gasification and autothermal oxygen gasification. In order to produce SNG from syngas several unit operations are required such as syngas cooling, cleaning, potential compression and, of course, methanation reactors. Finally the gas which is produced has to be conditioned i. e. removal of unwanted species, such as CO 2 etc. The heat recovered from the overall process is utilized by a steam cycle, producing power. These processes were modeled with the computer software IPSEpro™. An energetic and exergetic analysis of the coal to SNG processes have been realized and compared. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd...|$|E

40|$|The {{success of}} a Chemical Looping Combustion (CLC) process for solid fossil fuel {{combustion}} is critically affected by {{the performance of the}} oxygen carrier and by proper design and operation of the fuel reactor. In this study, a novel configuration of the fuel reactor for chemical looping combustion with oxygen uncoupling of <b>solid</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>fuels</b> is proposed. The configuration is based on a two-stage reactor with the aim of overcoming the main drawbacks of the single-stage design: limited conversion, slip of unburnt volatiles, extensive elutriation of char fines. The two stages of the configuration operate in series and accomplish different tasks. The bottom bed is mainly devoted to conversion of the char, taking advantage of the full oxidative power of the oxygen carrier coming from the air reactor. The top reactor exploits the residual oxidative power of the oxygen carrier to oxidize volatile matter and gasification products as well as the unconverted char issuing from the bottom bed. A mathematical model has been developed with the aim of assessing the performances of the two-stage fuel reactor varying operating conditions in comparison with a benchmark case consisting of a single-stage fuel reactor.

30|$|The {{consumption}} of <b>solid</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>fuel</b> is gaining importance in world energy production. There {{has been an}} increase in studies on coal since it is an alternative to petrol and has a high reserve. The pulverized coal injection is used to obtain high heat capacity and high burning efficiency in thermal reactors and boilers based on coal. For this purpose, coals are ground at a micron size and then sent to boilers to achieve maximum calorific value. Comminution of coal is essential for effective utilization through combustion, carbonization, gasification and/or beneficiation (Prasher 1987). Preheating a coal in an oven has been shown to reduce grind strength, although it is unlikely that this would be an economically viable method, at least not through associated energy requirements (Harrison and Rowson 1997). The grindability of coal is an important practical and economical property to coal handling and utilization aspects. Thus engineering experiments wish to find the grinding conditions under which a certain process reaches its response optimum. The optimum could be either a maximum or a minimum of a function of the design parameters. One of the methodologies is the surface response methodology (Kwak 2005). Grinding media charge ratio in a conventional grinding system is approximately 40  %. This leads to a better delivery of the grinding energy (Kincl et al. 2005; Lester et al. 2005; Barranco et al. 2006). Grinding in a ball mill has shown that the ball charge has a significant effect on the product fineness for same specific energy consumption and increases power draws of the mill linearly (Tuzun 1994 and Jankovic 2001). The ball size should be just heavy and large so that the charge should be grinded efficiently. In the present work the ball size is kept constant and these are considered to be efficient for the grinding media. In the grinding of Turkish coal and ore, the charge ratio, Bond work index and the ball diameter were taken as the variables in the experiments however, time of grinding is also a significant parameter in the grinding experiments (Aslan and Cebeci 2007; Edadnejad et al. 2013).|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Biomass and {{municipal}} solid waste offer sustainable sources of energy; for example to meet heat and electricity demand {{in the form of}} combined cooling, heat and power. Combustion of biomass has a lesser impact than <b>solid</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>fuels</b> (e. g. coal) upon gas pollutant emissions, whilst energy recovery from {{municipal solid waste}} is a beneficial component of an integrated, sustainable waste management programme. Concurrent combustion of these fuels using a fluidised bed combustor may be a successful method of overcoming some of the disadvantages of biomass (high fuel supply and distribution costs, combustion characteristics) and characteristics of municipal solid waste (heterogeneous content, conflict with materials recycling). It should be considered that combustion of municipal solid waste may be a financially attractive disposal route if a 'gate fee' value exists for accepting waste for combustion, which will reduce the net cost of utilising relatively more expensive biomass fuels. Results Emissions of nitrogen monoxide and sulphur dioxide for combustion of biomass are suppressed after substitution of biomass for municipal solid waste materials as the input fuel mixture. Interactions between these and other pollutants such as hydrogen chloride, nitrous oxide and carbon monoxide indicate complex, competing reactions occur between intermediates of these compounds to determine final resultant emissions. Conclusions Fluidised bed concurrent combustion is an appropriate technique to exploit biomass {{and municipal}} solid waste resources, without the use of fossil fuels. The addition of municipal solid waste to biomass combustion has the effect of reducing emissions of some gaseous pollutants. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Regardless of {{the type}} of fuel and {{organization}} of the combustion process, usage of air as an oxidizer in this process is a source of nitrogen oxides emission. Significant increase in the emission occurs when fuel is itself a source of nitrogen. The nitrogen oxides formed in combustion processes, conducted in industrial processes, in power industry as well as in households pose a serious threat to the environment and human health when released to the atmosphere. Apart from <b>solid</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>fuels,</b> solid biomass is being increasingly used for energy purposes. However, it does contain significant amounts of nitrogen, usually exceeding the amount of nitrogen found in coal, in the form of organic bases and amino acids. Combustion of biomass, on the one hand, could lead to significant reduction in the growth of CO 2 emission into the atmosphere, however; on the other hand it could become a significant factor in the increase in global emission of nitrogen oxides. Use of techniques and technologies that protect the atmosphere from an inflow of additional stream of nitrogen oxides would, therefore, seem inevitable. Besides methods involving chemical reduction of NOx in flue gases in isolation from the area where is the source of flue gases, methods for reducing amount of nitrogen oxides in the exhaust fumes carried in the combustion zone, are also known and applied.

40|$|The {{characterization}} of <b>solid</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>fuels</b> by chemical and spectroscopic methods requires extensive modelling in less complex systems for chemical proof of principle and technique development. In previous work coal was fluorinated with dilute, elemental fluorine under conditions that {{were expected to}} lead to materials that contain only fluoromethine moieties. The solid state, cross polarization/magic angle spinning (CP/MAS) {sup 13 }C NMR spectra of the fluorinated coal are complex, indicating more chemical modification than originally anticipated. Our goal in the coal derivatization was to sequentially increase {{the severity of the}} fluorination and observe by {sup 19 }F and {sup 13 }C NMR the type and concentration of fluorine functional groups created in the coal milieu. This requires the ability to discriminate between C, CF, CF{sub 2 }, and CF, moieties in the coal matrix. The task can be accomplished by implementing the spectral editing technique of Wu and Zilm which distinguishes different kinds of carbon resonances, especially CH and CH{sub 2 } resonances. These experiments utilize cross polarization (CP) and polarization inversion (PI) to effect the discrimination. Our version of this experiment is a triple resonance experiment that incorporates {sup 19 }F-{sup 13 }C CP, PI, and simultaneous {sup 1 }H and {sup 19 }F dipolar decoupling. In order to evaluate the elemental fluorine chemistry in a matrix simpler than coal, fluorinated graphite was prepared.

In contrast to the related chemical-looping combustion (CLC) technology where gaseous or gasified fuels react directly with oxygen carriers, CLOU processes require oxygen carrier materials {{to be able to}} release oxygen in the fuel reactor and to regenerate by re-oxidation in oxygen-rich atmosphere in the air reactor at elevated temperature. Oxygen uncoupling properties and reactivities for methane combustion of 12 oxygen carrier particles, produced from mixtures of manganese and magnesium oxides with optional addition of titanium dioxide or calcium hydroxide, are investigated in a quartz batch reactor at 810 degrees C, 850 degrees C, 900 degrees C and 950 degrees C. All investigated oxygen carriers have oxygen release characteristics. The addition of calcium hydroxide facilitates oxygen release and combustion of methane, whereas addition of titanium dioxide does not have a pronounced effect on either oxygen uncoupling or reactivity of the oxygen carrier.

Definitions of coal (< 50 % ash) and coal seam (thickness and depth limits) are examined {{in view of}} an international agreement regarding new concepts for a common reserves and resources evaluation using the same nomenclature. The 50 % ash limit, already adopted by UN-ECE for coal definition, allows {{the creation of a}} new category—the organic shales (50 – 75 % ash) —comprising energetic materials still valuable for thermal use (coal shales) or to be retorted for oil production (oil shales). Geological relations between coals, oil shales, solid bitumen, liquid hydrocarbons, natural gas, and coalbed methane are also examined together with environmental problems. As a final synthesis of all topics, the paper discusses the problems related with a modern geological classification of all solid sedimentary fuels based on: various rank parameters (moisture content, calorific value, reflectance), maceral composition, and mineral matter content (and washability). Finally, it should be pointed out that the paper is presented as series of problems, some of them old ones, but never resolved until now. In order to facilitate the next generation of coal geologists to resolve these problems on the basis of international agreements, all sections begin with documented introductions for further questions opening an international enquiry.

This paper reviews the application of chemical looping to the combustion of <b>solid</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>fuels.</b> There is little doubt that chemical looping combustion for the combustion of gaseous fuels could be brought to the industrial scale readily; however, further research on the important topic of solid fuels is needed. In principle, there are three options for coping with solid fuels. (i) The solid fuel is gasified separately and the synthesis gas burnt in a conventional chemical looping arrangement for gaseous fuels. (ii) The solid fuel is gasified in situ in the presence of a batch of metal oxide in a single reactor. As the metal oxide becomes depleted, the feed of fuel is discontinued, the inventory of fuel is reduced by further gasification and then the contents are re-oxidised by the admission of air to the reactor. (iii) The solid fuel is gasified in situ in the presence of the metal oxide, as in (ii), but the unburnt fuel is separated from the spent oxide, with the latter being recycled through an oxidation reactor. In each case, the gasifying agent would need to be free from nitrogen, e. g. a mixture containing CO 2 and steam only. The advantages and disadvantages of each are discussed, and some research on option (ii) at Cambridge is surveyed. This paper also examines a modification of chemical looping, involving the oxides of iron in packed bed reactors, to produce hydrogen of high purity from low-grade synthesis gas. This offers substantial benefits and, indeed, might be a low cost option for the initial industrial realisation of the looping technique. It is concluded that the chemical looping of solid fuels has been demonstrated to be feasible at the small scale and that it is timely for there to be a major European initiative to work on the scale-up and industrial demonstration of the technique. 1...|$|E
40|$|This PhD thesis {{presents}} the work {{carried out by}} kinetic modeling incorporated with particle simulation on selected plant based biomass during pyrolysis and gasification followed by an experimental investigation of those processes under entrained flow to satisfy the engineering requirement. Renewable energy sources are becoming {{a significant part of}} the primary energy share for mitigating the CO₂ emission along with addressing the issue of fossil fuel depletion. According to the lifecycle of biomass, it is CO₂ neutral and can be a potential replacement for fossil fuels. Being a solid fuel, it can be consumed using the existing technology for <b>solid</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>fuels,</b> however, with modification. To modify any available technology, significant research effort is needed in both fundamental and engineering level to find out optimum reaction conditions. One appropriate technology for solid fuel conversion is entrained flow gasification which uses a high heating rate and low residence time to produce high energy gas. Non-conventional biomass (e. g. algae) along with woody biomass might be consumed by this technology. At the same time, fossil fuel (coal) can be potentially replaced by blending biomass with it. To model the inherent kinetics involved in the pyrolysis process, a new algorithm was proposed for higher order distributed activation energy model. The new algorithm was found to be versatile in estimating the intrinsic pyrolysis kinetics for different types of biomass (algae, sawdust, and coconut shell) along with predicting the pyrolysis behavior of the blends of one those biomass samples and coal. To link this fundamental development to the engineering application, entrained flow pyrolysis experiments on biomass were performed on biomass by varying different operating conditions. After that, a particle model was developed for this process to predict the conversion profile of the solid biomass particle using apparent kinetics which showed good agreement with the experimental data. A guideline was also generated on the basis of parametric study (particle size, temperature, gas velocity, residence time etc.) to design a laminar entrained flow reactor for pyrolysis. Further development of the particle model was achieved by incorporating the intrinsic kinetic parameters obtained by the newly developed algorithm. It was proposed that inclusion of pyrolysis heat of reaction would improve the prediction of the model if intrinsic kinetic parameters were to be used. At the same time, effect of operating parameters (temperature, particle size) and species variation on entrained flow pyrolysis was evaluated. The study was limited to the particle size ranges under 600 µm (suitable particle size for entrained flow gasification) and up to a temperature of 1000 °C. Among all the parameters, particle size was found to be the most critical because of its influence on both residence time and heating rate. Also, temperature was found be very important for achieving full conversion in case of larger particle size. At 1000 °C, pyrolysis of all types of biomass under consideration reached completion. In case of a lower temperature (800 °C), some unconverted particles were observed for larger size (500 - 600 µm). Tar production was minimized at 1000 °C for the smaller particle size (150 - 250 µm). At a higher temperature, the gas yield was also increased considerably due to the increase in conversion efficiency. Morphological study on the char particles showed that sawdust experienced a molten phase during its pyrolysis and due to the gas release from inside, the smaller particles were converted into cenospheres where no morphology of the parent particle was visible. This resulted in highly reactive char with an extremely porous structure. However, this observation could not be generalized as algae and coconut shell char showed different morphological development. As the char obtained from the entrained flow pyrolysis process were different from fixed bed chars, they were studied for their reactivity and kinetics under CO₂. Generally, gasification kinetics of most of the chars was predicted well by random pore model. Only the algal char obtained from rapid pyrolysis was different because of its low amount of gasifiable mass attached to the surface which did not show any porous structure, therefore, followed the volumetric reaction model. Along with the fixed bed chars, only coconut shell char from entrained flow reactor showed very low reactivity. This difference in the reactivity was attributed to the lack of mesopores along with the variation of indigenous alkali in the ash among the biomass species to a lesser extent. This low reactivity of coconut shell char resulted in the entrained flow gasification experiments which were performed by varying the temperature, particle size and also concentration of gasifying agent (CO₂). The char from coconut shell did not show any significant increase in conversion due to the decrease in particle size whereas a steady linear increase was observed for temperature. In contrast, the sawdust char was highly reactive and reached its highest conversion (50 %) at 1000 °C under 20 % CO₂ for a reactor length of 1. 885 m. Remarkable increase in the conversion was observed with decrease in the particle size and increase of temperature. The increase in reactor length also showed positive effect on char conversion and gas production. These findings have important implications on the gasifier design and sample preparation meaning there will be no benefit of reduced particle size on conversion if the sample itself is less reactive in the first place. Also it was revealed that if raw biomass was gasified, these effects would have been indistinguishable because of the dominance of pyrolysis. No tar was observed during char gasification process at 1000 °C as most of it removed during the pyrolysis process. Along with the above studies, a new analytical technique (Synchrotron based Infrared spectrum) was used to study the pyrolysis process of biomass. The study delineated the evolution of functional groups from the surface of biomass along with the effect of heating rate during the process. This was a preliminary study which opened up new possibilities in energy research considering in situ gasification of biomass...|$|E
