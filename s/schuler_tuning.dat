This principle, called <b>Schuler</b> <b>tuning,</b> is used in inertial guidance systems in ships and aircraft that operate on the surface of the Earth. No physical pendulum is used, but the control system that keeps the inertial platform containing the gyroscopes stable is modified so the device acts as though it is attached to such a pendulum, keeping the platform always facing down as the vehicle moves on the curved surface of the Earth.|$|E

Since the LN-3/PHI-4 {{navigation}} {{system is to}} be used around the globe of the earth, some systematic corrections for use on this rotating spheroid are implemented in the LN-3 : Earth rate, Transport rate, and Coriolis correction.

Receiving the precise flight parameters information about the flying vehicle velocities and location (e. g. available from Differential Global Position System), then by recording installed on an aircraft flying within the indicated range of altitudes and velocities, the accelerometers data it can be separated the inertial components so leave only the gravitational ones. Airborne gravimetry is conducted using either sea/air gravimeters on a <b>Schuler</b> <b>tuned</b> stabilized platform for scalar gravimetry, or with an Inertial Navigation System mainly Strapdown INS for scalar or vector gravimetry. In both cases, {{the separation of the}} gravitational and kinematic accelerations from the systems is crutial in estimating the gravity field. Results of scalar airborne gravimetry survey using gravimeters, modified for high dinamics of the aircraft in Greenland and Switzerland show that the accuracy of 3 to 5 mGal and a resolution of 10 km wavelenght is achievable [1]. The main error source in this case is insufficient platform stabilization. Another tes...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Schuler</b> <b>tuning</b> is a {{modification}} to the {{electronic control system}} used in inertial navigation systems that accounts for the curvature of the Earth. An inertial navigation system, used in submarines, ships, aircraft, and other vehicles {{to keep track of}} position, determines directions with respect to three axes pointing [...] "north", [...] "east", and [...] "down". To detect the vehicle's orientation, the system contains an [...] "inertial platform" [...] mounted on gimbals, with gyroscopes that keep it pointing in a fixed orientation in space. However, the directions [...] "north", [...] "east" [...] and [...] "down" [...] change as the vehicle moves on the curved surface of the Earth. <b>Schuler</b> <b>tuning</b> describes the modifications necessary to an inertial navigation system to keep the inertial platform always pointing [...] "north", [...] "east" [...] and [...] "down", so it gives correct directions on Earth.|$|E
5000|$|To {{implement}} <b>Schuler</b> <b>tuning,</b> {{the feedback}} loop {{is modified to}} tilt the platform as the vehicle moves in the north-south and east-west directions, to keep the platform facing [...] "down". [...] To do this, the torquers that rotate the platform are fed a signal proportional to the vehicle's north-south and east-west velocity. The turning rate of the torquers {{is equal to the}} velocity divided by the radius of the Earth R: ...|$|E

He {{was born in}} Zweibrücken and died in Munich.In his quest to navigate to the North Pole by submarine, he {{became interested in the}} concept of the gyrocompass. In 1905 he founded, with Friedrich Treitschke, the first firm to manufacture gyroscopic navigation instruments, which he designed. One of his staff was Maximilian Schuler, who made the fundamental discovery of <b>Schuler</b> <b>tuning.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A {{pendulum}} {{the length}} of the Earth's radius is impractical, so <b>Schuler</b> <b>tuning</b> doesn't use physical pendulums. Instead, the electronic control system of the inertial navigation system is modified to make the platform behave as if it were attached to a pendulum. The inertial platform is mounted on gimbals, and an electronic control system keeps it pointed in a constant direction with respect to the three axes. As the vehicle moves, the gyroscopes detect changes in orientation, and a feedback loop applies signals to torquers to rotate the platform on its gimbals to keep it pointed along the axes.|$|E
