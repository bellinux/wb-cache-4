40|$|The {{behaviour}} of an incompressible dielectric liquid {{subjected to}} a laminar planar Couette flow with unipolar charge injection is investigated numerically in two dimensions. The computations show new morphological characteristics of roll structures that arise in this forced electro-convection problem. The charge and velocity magnitude distributions between the two parallel electrodes are discussed {{as a function of}} the top wall velocity and the EHD Rayleigh number, T for the case of strong charge injection. A wide enough parametric space is investigated such that the observed EHD roll structures progress through three regimes. These regimes are defined by the presence of a single or double-roll free convective structure as observed elsewhere (Vazquez et al 2008 J. Phys. D 41 175303), a sheared or <b>stretched</b> <b>roll</b> structure, and finally by a regime where the perpendicular velocity gradient is sufficient to prevent the generation of a roll. These three regimes have been delineated {{as a function of the}} wall to ionic drift velocity Uw/kE, and the T number. In the stretched regime, an increase in Uw/kE can reduce charge and momentum fluctuations whilst in parallel de-stratify charge in the region between the two electrodes. The <b>stretched</b> <b>roll</b> regime is also characterised by a substantial influence of Uw/kE on the steady development time, however in the traditional non-stretched roll structure regime, no influence of Uw/kE on the development time is noted...|$|R

5000|$|Engineers have {{developed}} an electroluminescent [...] "skin" [...] that can stretch more than six times its original size while still emitting light. This hyper-elastic light-emitting capacitor (HLEC) can endure {{more than twice the}} strain of previously tested stretchable displays. It consists of layers of transparent hydrogel electrodes sandwiching an insulating elastomer sheet. The elastomer changes luminance and capacitance when <b>stretched,</b> <b>rolled</b> and otherwise deformed. In addition to its ability to emit light under a strain of greater than 480 percent its original size, the group's HLEC was shown to be capable of being integrated into a soft robotic system. Three six-layer HLEC panels were bound together to form a crawling soft robot, with the top four layers making up the light-up skin and the bottom two the pneumatic actuators. The discovery could lead to significant advances in health care, transportation, electronic communication and other areas.|$|R

Up to two pairings of the dominant spanwise rollers have been simulated. When the flow is sufficiently three-dimensional, a pairing can cause the mixing layer to undergo a transition to small-scale turbulence. This small-scale transition is accompanied by increased mixing of a passive scalar, similar to observations of the mixing transition in experiments. As part of the transition process, thin vortex sheets are generated by vortex <b>stretching</b> and <b>roll</b> up in a two-dimensional mixing layer.

60|$|One of {{the most}} {{fascinating}} bits of animal study is to begin {{at the very beginning of}} fox education, i.e., to find a fox den, and go there some afternoon in early June, and hide at a distance, where you can watch the entrance through your field-glass. Every afternoon the young foxes come out to play in the sunshine like so many kittens.

For hours at a <b>stretch</b> they <b>roll</b> about, and chase tails, and pounce upon the quiet old mother with fierce little barks. One climbs laboriously up the rock behind the den, and sits on his tail, gravely surveying the great landscape with a comical little air of importance, as if he owned it all.

40|$|The {{spontaneous}} spreading of a thin volatile film {{along the}} surface of a deep fluid layer of higher surface tension provides a rapid and efficient transport mechanism for many technological applications. This spreading process is used, for example, as the carrier mechanism in the casting of biological and organic Langmuir–Blodgett films. We have investigated the dynamics of spontaneously spreading volatile films of different vapor pressures and spreading coefficients advancing over {{the surface of}} a deep water support. Laser shadowgraphy was used to visualize the entire surface of the film from the droplet source to the leading edge. This noninvasive technique, which is highly sensitive to the film surface curvature, clearly displays the location of several moving fronts. In this work we focus mainly on the details of the leading edge. Previous studies of the spreading dynamics of nonvolatile, immiscible thin films on a deep liquid layer have shown that the leading edge advances in time as t 3 / 4 as predicted by laminar boundary layer theory. We have found that the leading edge of volatile, immiscible spreading films also advances as a power law in time, talpha, where alpha ~ 1 / 2. Differences in the liquid vapor pressure or the spreading coefficient seem only to affect the speed of advance but not the value of the spreading exponent, which suggests the presence of a universal scaling law. Sideview laser shadowgraphs depicting the subsurface motion in the water reveal the presence of a single <b>stretched</b> convective <b>roll</b> right beneath {{the leading edge of the}} spreading film. This fluid circulation, likely caused by evaporation and subsequent surface cooling of the rapidly spreading film, resembles a propagating Rayleigh–Bénard convective roll. We propose that this sublayer rotational flow provides the additional dissipation responsible for the reduced spreading exponent...|$|R

[...] Although {{there is no evidence of}} hibernation, the squirrels are not bothered by the cold and can survive temperatures below freezing, in their burrows. They are not early risers and are usually not seen until after sunrise, however it does forage in the morning and evening, avoiding the midday heat. Around noon the squirrels disappear into their burrows and are not seen again until about 2 pm at the earliest. On moderate days, the squirrels will take their time foraging, in contrast to bringing as much food back to their burrows as quickly as possible on hot or cold days.

40|$|P. Wolff, S. Rockwood, R. Jepsen, W. M. Silvers Whitworth University, Spokane WA Evidence {{to support}} the {{positive}} effects of static stretching (SS) on range of motion (ROM) is long withstanding. However, researchers have consistently found negative effects on performance after SS sessions. Recently, there has been increased interest in self-myofascial release (SMR) via foam rolling (FR). It appears that FR has the potential to improve ROM without eliciting a detrimental effect on force output and athletic performance. However, few studies have directly compared the effects of SS and FR on ROM and athletic performance. PURPOSE: The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare the effects of acute sessions of SS and FR on ankle dorsiflexion ROM and vertical jump (VJ) force output. METHODS: Fifteen healthy, recreationally active, college-aged males and females (nm = 3; nf = 12; age: 19 - 22 y; ht: 169. 7 ± 10. 7 cm; wt: 70. 8 ± 15. 9 kg) completed separate sessions of FR or SS, followed immediately by ROM and force output tests. Each gastrocnemius muscle-tendon group was <b>stretched</b> statically or <b>rolled</b> for three bouts of 30 s, with 30 s rest between sets. Goniometry was used to assess active, static ankle dorsiflexion ROM at baseline (CON) and post-SS/FR. A VJ test on a force plate was used to assess baseline and post-SS/FR force output. A repeated measures ANOVA (significance level p ≤ 0. 05) was utilized to determine the existence of significant differences between experimental conditions for each dependent variable. RESULTS: No statistical difference was found in VJ performance between conditions (CON: 1530. 4 ± 450. 7 N, SS: 1537. 5 ± 489. 4 N, FR: 1524. 5 ± 467. 8 N; p = 0. 830). For the right leg ROM measurements, there was no statistical difference between conditions (CON: 59. 5 ± 7. 8 o, SS: 60. 7 ± 8. 7 o, FR: 59. 9 ± 9. 4 o; p = 0. 748). However, for left leg ROM measurements there was a statistical difference between CON, SS and FR (CON: 57. 6 ± 9. 3 o SS: 62. 2 ± 8. 3 o, FR: 62. 6 ± 8. 0 o; p = 0. 013). CONCLUSIONS: Under the present research conditions, an acute session of SS or FR elicited no significant changes in VJ force output compared to CON. For the left ankle, FR and SS increased ROM compared to CON; however, this result was not observed bilaterally as in previous research. One possible explanation for the ROM differences between ankles was that left leg dominance of participants may have increased tightness of the muscle-tendon unit. Such tightness may have increased the susceptibility for change in left ankle ROM in response to FR and SS sessions. Future research should utilize larger samples, varied intervention times, and multiple sessions for further investigation of SS versus FR effects on joint ROM and athletic performance...|$|R
