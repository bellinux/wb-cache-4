5000|$|Limit mics {{have two}} anvils and two spindles, {{and are used}} like a <b>snap</b> <b>gauge.</b> The part being checked must pass through the first gap and must stop at the second gap {{in order to be}} within specification. The two gaps {{accurately}} reflect {{the top and bottom of}} the tolerance range.|$|E
50|$|Nocturnal penile tumescence (NPT):It {{is normal}} {{for a man}} to have five to six erections during sleep, {{especially}} during rapid eye movement (REM). Their absence may indicate a problem with nerve function or blood supply in the penis. There are two methods for measuring changes in penile rigidity and circumference during nocturnal erection: <b>snap</b> <b>gauge</b> and strain gauge. A significant proportion of men who have no sexual dysfunction nonetheless do not have regular nocturnal erections.|$|E
5000|$|Snap gauges {{are often}} used when a large {{quantity}} of work pieces must be inspected. The <b>snap</b> <b>gauge</b> has four anvils or jaws, the first one or pair (outermost) are set using the upper limit (tolerance) of the part and the inner set adjusted to the lower limit of the part. A correctly machined part will pass {{the first set of}} jaws and stop at the second [...] - [...] end of test. In this manner, a part may be checked in one action, unlike the plug gauge that needs to be used twice and flipped to access the second gauge. The first go/no-go snap gage for checking thread rolls was invented in 1943 to speed production of parts during WWII.|$|E

50|$|Another {{feature of}} the Valmet M62/76 series rifles is the flash suppressor. It resembles an {{enlarged}} version of the suppressor on the original M16. Directly under the flash suppressor is a bayonet lug to accommodate the knife-style bayonet manufactured by Fiskars and Hackman. The flash suppressor has some sharp edges along its longitudinal cuts for wire cutting. A soldier slides the barbed wire into the flash suppressor and simply rotates his rifle around until it <b>snaps</b> the small <b>gauge</b> wire. For thicker wire, the soldier inserts the wire, gives a half turn and fires the rifle, which will snap the wire. On the M16 the prong type flash suppressor was abandoned for the bird cage type because the prongs tended to snag on vegetation in the field. While {{this is still a}} problem with the M62/76, the sharper edges help to cut through some of the vegetation.|$|R
5000|$|The {{surfaces}} which {{define the}} edges of the aperture are the anvils, which may be made of separate pieces of hard material such as tungsten carbide for wear resistance. Two apertures are frequently used to provide Go/No-Go testing and are often arranged such that a part being measured can pass through the two apertures in sequence; a part that is within tolerance will pass through the first maximum size limit aperture but {{will not be able to}} pass through the minimum size limit aperture. A <b>snap</b> <b>gauge</b> usually has a [...] "C" [...] shaped frame with the aperture(s) at the opening of the [...] "C". Snap gages may be machined and ground out of a single block of metal or adjustable snap gages, which have movable anvils that may be adjusted over a limited range of sizes, may be used. They may also be of built up construction in which one or more gage blocks or feeler gauges are sandwiched between two anvils. Adjustable snap gages may be reset to compensate for wear or re-tasked for measuring a different dimension and can be purchased off the shelf and set rather than needing to be fabricated from scratch when a new gage is needed. Gauge blocks would typically be used to initially set the width of the measuring aperture(s).|$|E
40|$|The {{behavior}} of the plain <b>snap</b> <b>gauge</b> of Epoxy Resin under the tension load are studied qualitatively by photoelastic showing the fringe order, the isochromatic lines and the isoclinics. As the results, the distribution curves of the fringe order are greatly influenced by the length, the width and {{the shapes of the}} gauge arm. Some singular points are observed in an U notch type, and double notch type has one more singular point compare with a single notch type. The expanse of several types in practical materials under the tension load are measured by strain meter and micro meter. As the results the authors find that U notch type has minimum value in testing pieces. ...|$|E
