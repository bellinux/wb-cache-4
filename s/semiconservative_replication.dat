50|$|DNA was {{extracted}} periodically and {{was compared}} to pure 14N DNA and 15N DNA. After one replication, the DNA {{was found to have}} intermediate density. Since conservative replication would result in equal amounts of DNA of the higher and lower densities (but no DNA of an intermediate density), conservative replication was excluded. However, this result was consistent with both semiconservative and dispersive replication. <b>Semiconservative</b> <b>replication</b> would result in double-stranded DNA with one strand of 15N DNA, and one of 14N DNA, while dispersive replication would result in double-stranded DNA with both strands having mixtures of 15N and 14N DNA, either of which would have appeared as DNA of an intermediate density.|$|E

This was inconsistent with dispersive replication, which {{would have resulted in}} a single density, lower than the intermediate density of the one-generation cells, but still higher than cells grown only in 14N DNA medium, as the original 15N DNA would have been split evenly among all DNA strands.

Immunoblots show that quiescent cells lack Cdc 6 and that minichromosome maintenance (MCM) proteins are not associated with chromatin. Competence of G 1 phase nuclei to replicate in vitro coincides with maximum Cdc 6 accumulation and MCM protein binding to chromatin in vivo. Addition of recombinant Cdc 6 to permeabilized, but not intact, G 1 nuclei causes up to 82 % of the nuclei to initiate and accelerates G 1 progression, making nuclei competent to replicate prematurely...|$|R
40|$|The intranuclear {{distribution}} of telomere DNA-binding protein and telomerase RNA in hypotrichous ciliates was revealed by indirect fluorescent antibody staining and in situ hybridization. The Oxytricha telomere protein colocalized with DNA, both being dispersed throughout the macronucleus except for numerous spherical foci that contained neither DNA nor the protein. Surprisingly, the telomerase RNA was concentrated in these foci; therefore, much of telomerase does not colocalize with telomeres. These foci persist through the cell cycle. They may represent sites of assembly, transport or stockpiling of telomerase and other ribonucleoproteins. During S phase, the macronuclear DNA replication machinery is organized into a disc-shaped structure called the replication band.
