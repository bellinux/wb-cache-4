Stottlemeyer is often irritated by Monk's behavior, but respects his friend and former colleague's amazing insight and {{observational}} abilities, as does Disher. Ever since childhood, Monk's obsessive attention to detail has allowed him to spot tiny discrepancies, find patterns, and make connections that others often miss. Something <b>someone</b> <b>says</b> or does usually triggers Monk to make the connection.|$|E

She stated that for her, saying [...] "goodbye" [...] is sufficient because it expresses the same well-wishing farewell sentiment. Leil Lowndes {{wrote in her}} 2009book How to Instantly Connect with Anyone that if <b>someone</b> <b>says</b> [...] "have a nice day", the recipient should refrain from sarcastically responding [...] "Thanks, but I have other plans" [...] or [...] "Gee, I was planning on having a miserable one, but {{now that you mention}} it, I think I'll have a nice one."

500|$|On {{songs such as}} [...] "Subway Train" [...] and [...] "Trash", Johansen used {{ambiguity}} as a lyrical mode. In Kogan's opinion, Johansen sang in an occasionally unintelligible {{manner and}} wrote in a perplexing, fictional style that was lazy yet ingenious, as it provided his lyrics an abundance of [...] "emotional meaning" [...] and interpretation: [...] "David never provides an objective framework, he's always jumping from voice to voice, so you're hearing a character addressing another character, or the narrator addressing the character, or the character or the narrator addressing us, all jammed up together so you're hearing bits of conversation and bits of subjective description in no kind of chronological order. But as <b>someone</b> <b>says</b> in 'Vietnamese Baby': 'Everything connects.'" [...] On [...] "Trash", Johansen undercut his vaguely pansexual beliefs {{with the possibility of}} going to [...] "fairyland" [...] if he took a [...] "lover's leap" [...] with the song's subject.|$|E

Although he has {{generally}} tried to keep his personal life private, Booker {{has in the past}} described himself as a [...] "straight male" [...] and has said that he is trying to date more in hopes of finding someone to settle down with. [...] In a 1990 column in the Stanford Daily, Booker admitted that as a teenager he had [...] "hated gays". [...] Booker has himself been the target of rumors about being gay and has generally refused to address these on principle, which he explained in 2013: Because I want to challenge people on their homophobia. I love seeing on Twitter when <b>someone</b> <b>says</b> I'm gay, and I say, [...] "So what does it matter if I am? So be it.

In discussing his failed attempts to control his own addictive behavior in the past, Downey told Oprah Winfrey in November 2004 that [...] "when <b>someone</b> <b>says,</b> 'I really wonder if maybe I should go to rehab?' Well, uh, you're a wreck, you just lost your job, and your wife left you. Uh, you might want to give it a shot." [...] He added that after his last arrest in April 2001, when he knew he would likely be facing another stint in prison or another form of incarceration such as court-ordered rehab, [...] "I said, 'You know what? I don't think I can continue doing this.' And I reached out for help, and I ran with it. You can reach out for help in kind of a half-assed way and you'll get it and you won't take advantage of it.

500|$|Poe chose a raven as {{the central}} symbol in the story because he wanted a [...] "non-reasoning" [...] {{creature}} capable of speech. He decided on a raven, which he considered [...] "equally capable of speech" [...] as a parrot, because it matched the intended tone of the poem. Poe said the raven is meant to symbolize [...] "Mournful and Never-ending Remembrance". He was also inspired by Grip, the raven in [...] by Charles Dickens. One scene in particular bears a resemblance to [...] "The Raven": {{at the end of}} the fifth chapter of Dickens's novel, Grip makes a noise and <b>someone</b> <b>says,</b> [...] "What was that– him tapping at the door?" [...] The response is, [...] "'Tis someone knocking softly at the shutter." [...] Dickens's raven could speak many words and had many comic turns, including the popping of a champagne cork, but Poe emphasized the bird's more dramatic qualities. Poe had written a review of Barnaby Rudge for Graham's Magazine saying, among other things, that the raven should have served a more symbolic, prophetic purpose. The similarity did not go unnoticed: James Russell Lowell in his A Fable for Critics wrote the verse, [...] "Here comes Poe with his raven, like Barnaby Rudge / Three-fifths of him genius and two-fifths sheer fudge." [...] The Free Library of Philadelphia has on display a taxidermied raven that is reputed to be the very one that Dickens owned and that helped inspire Poe's poem.|$|E
500|$|In 2005, Gosling {{appeared}} as a disturbed young art student in Stay, a psychological thriller film co-starring Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor. In an uncomplimentary review of the film, Manohla Dargis of The New York Times said that Gosling [...] "like his fans, deserves better." [...] Todd McCarthy of Variety felt that the [...] "capable" [...] McGregor and Gosling [...] "deliver nothing new from what they've shown before". The film grossed $8 million worldwide. Gosling was unfazed by the negative reaction: [...] "I had a kid {{come up to me}} on the street, 10 years old, and he says, 'Are you that guy from Stay? What the f--- was that movie about?' I think that's great. I'm just as proud if <b>someone</b> <b>says,</b> 'Hey, you made me sick in that movie,' as if they say I made them cry.” Gosling next starred in 2006's Half Nelson as a drug-addicted junior high school teacher who forms a bond with a young student. To prepare for the role, Gosling moved to New York for one month before shooting began. He lived in a small apartment in Brooklyn and spent time shadowing an eighth grade teacher. Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times described [...] "a mesmerizing performance ... that shows the kind of deep understanding of character few actors manage." [...] Ruthe Stein of the San Francisco Chronicle drew comparisons with Marlon Brando and declared that [...] "nobody who cares about great acting will want to miss his performance". Roger Ebert felt the performance [...] "proves he's one of the finest actors working in contemporary movies." [...] He was nominated for an Academy Award. The film grossed $4 million at the worldwide box office. In 2007, he was invited to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.|$|E
