5|$|A notable recent {{development}} in Philosophy of Psychology is Functional Contextualism or Contextual Behavioural Science (CBS). Functional Contextualism {{is a modern}} philosophy of science rooted in philosophical pragmatism and contextualism. It is most actively developed in behavioral <b>science</b> <b>in</b> general, the field of behavior analysis, and contextual behavioral <b>science</b> <b>in</b> particular (see the entry for the Association for Contextual Behavioral Science). Functional contextualism serves {{as the basis of}} a theory of language known as relational frame theory and its most prominent application, acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT). It is an extension and contextualistic interpretation of B.F. Skinner's radical behaviorism first delineated by Steven C. Hayes which emphasizes the importance of predicting and influencing psychological events (including thoughts, feelings, and behaviors) with precision, scope, and depth, by focusing on manipulable variables in their context.|$|E

5|$|Although {{at various}} times the Byzantines made {{magnificent}} achievements {{in the application of}} the sciences, and are responsible for preserving much of ancient knowledge, some authors have argued that Byzantine scholars made few novel contributions to <b>science</b> <b>in</b> terms of developing new theories or extending the ideas of classical authors.|$|E
5|$|Comte's {{positivism}} {{established the}} initial philosophical foundations for formal sociology and social research.
