Spectral phase information is impractical to obtain in these instances, due to the relatively short wavelength involved. In this paper a new algorithm for image reconstruction from localized spectral magnitude is presented. The algorithm is based on localized Fourier transform magnitudes and a single <b>spatial</b> <b>sample</b> to fully reconstruct an image. The process reconstructs successively larger image blocks, until the entire image is restored, using the <b>spatial</b> <b>sample</b> as initial data.

5000|$|<b>Spatial</b> <b>sampling</b> {{involves}} determining {{a limited}} number of locations in geographic space for faithfully measuring phenomena that are subject to dependency and heterogeneity. [...] Dependency suggests that since one location can predict the value of another location, we do not need observations in both places. But heterogeneity suggests that this relation can change across space, and therefore we cannot trust an observed degree of dependency beyond a region that may be small. Basic <b>spatial</b> <b>sampling</b> schemes include random, clustered and systematic. These basic schemes can be applied at multiple levels in a designated spatial hierarchy (e.g., urban area, city, neighborhood). It is also possible to exploit ancillary data, for example, using property values as a guide in a <b>spatial</b> <b>sampling</b> scheme to measure educational attainment and income. Spatial models such as autocorrelation statistics, regression and interpolation (see below) can also dictate sample design.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{three new}} {{algorithms}} for signal reconstruction from spectral magnitude are presented.

The process reconstructs equal-sized image blocks, until the entire image is restored, using the <b>spatial</b> <b>sample</b> as initial data. The third scheme is a modification of the Gerchberg-Saxton iterative approach to image reconstruction.
