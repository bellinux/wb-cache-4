40|$|This study {{estimates}} and evaluates the <b>social</b> <b>costs</b> of highways in Japan. Five kinds of <b>social</b> <b>costs</b> of vehicular transport are considered: traffic accidents, air pollution, noise, global warming, and traffic congestion. Major {{findings of this}} study are as follows. First, <b>social</b> <b>costs</b> increase at an accelerated rate as traffic volume increases. Second, the largest component of vehicular transport’s <b>social</b> <b>costs</b> on highways is traffic congestion, accounting for about 64 %. The second largest component is traffic accidents, accounting for 24 %. Third, among vehicle types, the <b>social</b> <b>costs</b> of buses are largest, at 105 yen per vehicle-km, about 16 times higher than the <b>social</b> <b>costs</b> of regular cars. Last, total <b>social</b> <b>costs</b> for whole highway networks are about 678, 212 million yen, or about 0. 13 % of Japan’s GDP.

40|$|This paper {{estimates}} the <b>social</b> <b>costs</b> of job loss due to environmental regulation. Per job lost, potential <b>social</b> <b>costs</b> of job loss are high, plausibly over $ 100, 000 in present value costs (2012 dollars) per permanently lost job. However, these <b>social</b> <b>costs</b> will typically {{be far less}} than the earnings associated with lost jobs, because labor markets and workers adjust, increased leisure has some value, and employers benefit from wage reductions. A plausible range for <b>social</b> <b>costs</b> is 8 - 32 percent of the associated earnings of the lost jobs. <b>Social</b> <b>costs</b> will be higher for older workers, high-wage jobs, and in high unemployment conditions. Under plausible estimates of job loss for most environmental regulations, the <b>social</b> <b>costs</b> of job loss will typically be less than 10 percent of other measured <b>social</b> <b>costs</b> of regulations. Therefore, adding in job loss is unlikely to tip many regulatory benefit-cost analyses...|$|R

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this paper is to {{estimate}} and evaluate the <b>social</b> <b>costs</b> of highways in Japan. In general, with more people concerned about protecting the environment at both local and global levels, dependence on vehicular transportation in cities has brought about problems. Too much dependence on autos causes air pollution, which has detrimental health effects. Furthermore, traffic congestion wastes time, money, and energy. The most concerning issue related to continuing dependence on car use is global warming. In order to implement transport policies conducive to creating a sustainable environment, it is necessary to measure correctly the <b>social</b> <b>costs</b> of vehicular transport such as traffic accidents, air pollution, noise, global warming, and traffic congestion. By using a data set from Japan, this paper aims to estimate the <b>social</b> <b>costs</b> of vehicular transport on highways and to evaluate how extensive these <b>social</b> <b>costs</b> are by comparing, for example, highway fares relative to GDP. Our study has several distinguishing characteristics. The most important point is that we estimate each individual highway 8 ̆ 1 fs <b>social</b> <b>costs</b> by considering average speed at the peak period, total traffic volume, types of vehicular transport and so on. Second, this study distinguishes five kinds of <b>social</b> <b>costs</b> of vehicular transport for individual highways in Japan: 1) traffic accidents, 2) air pollution, 3) noise, 4) global warming, and 5) traffic congestion. Third, by using a data set of over 50 individual highways in Japan in 2005, we analyze the relationship between the <b>social</b> <b>costs</b> of vehicular transport and traffic volumes in general. Last, by comparing highway fares, the degree of GDP, the fuel tax level, and other factors, we assess the magnitude of <b>social</b> <b>costs,</b> for the purpose of creating prudent transport policy. In order to attain the objectives mentioned above, we organize our study as follows. First, we summarize previous studies, with special attention to the kinds of <b>social</b> <b>costs</b> used, the kinds of sub-items considered in estimating <b>social</b> <b>costs,</b> the aggregate level, the method of estimation, and the magnitude of the <b>social</b> <b>costs</b> of vehicular transport. Second, we explain our method for estimating <b>social</b> <b>costs.</b> In this section, we describe specific equations for the five main categories of highways 8 ̆ 1 f <b>social</b> <b>costs.</b> Third, based on these equations, by using a data set for highways in Japan, we estimate the <b>social</b> <b>costs</b> of vehicular transport on highways. Last, by comparing highway fares, and GDP and so on, we evaluate how extensive highways 8 ̆ 1 f <b>social</b> <b>costs</b> actually are. In this section, we also summarize our major findings...|$|R

25|$|Of great {{importance}} {{in the theory of}} marginal cost is the distinction between the marginal private and social costs. The marginal private cost shows the cost associated to the firm in question. It is the marginal private cost that is used by business decision makers in their profit maximization goals. Marginal <b>social</b> <b>cost</b> is similar to private cost in that it includes the cost of private enterprise but also any other cost (or offsetting benefit) to society to parties having no direct association with purchase or sale of the product. It incorporates all negative and positive externalities, of both production and consumption. Examples might include a <b>social</b> <b>cost</b> from air pollution affecting third parties or a social benefit from flu shots protecting others from infection.|$|E

30|$|There are two {{important}} reasons that these figures {{may differ from}} true <b>social</b> <b>costs.</b> Because the program provides some services that would be obtained elsewhere, it reduces expenses—either by participants or others— {{that would otherwise be}} incurred; this causes <b>social</b> <b>costs</b> to be smaller than actual direct costs. In their benefit-cost analysis of the JTPA program, Orr et al. (1996) find that such substitution is important; they estimate that it reduces <b>social</b> <b>costs</b> by nearly half of the total of training and other program costs (see Orr et al., pp. 97, 189, 269). On the other hand, some <b>social</b> <b>costs</b> are omitted from our direct cost measures. Individuals receiving certain WIA services may draw on other subsidies, such as when they receive training at publicly-subsidized community colleges. Orr et al. include such subsidies in their analysis, whereas the expenses we present above do not. Hence, the measures we cite are subject to biases in both directions, and it would not be surprising if our estimates of costs differed from true <b>social</b> <b>costs</b> by 30 percent in either direction.|$|R
25|$|Several states, {{including}} California, New York, Rhode Island, and Wisconsin, {{have consistently}} deployed energy efficiency innovations. Their state planning officials, citizens, and industry leaders, have found these very cost-effective, often providing greater service at lower personal and <b>social</b> <b>cost</b> than simply adding more fossil-fuel based supply. This {{is the case}} for several reasons. Energy efficient technologies often represent upgrades in service through superior performance (e.g. higher quality lighting, heating and cooling with greater controls, or improved reliability of service through greater ability of utilities to respond to time of peak demand). So these innovations can provide a better, less expensive service.|$|E
25|$|An {{alternative}} approach {{to having a}} Pigouvian tax is one based on property rights. A practical example {{of this would be}} a system of emissions trading, which is essentially a privatization of the atmosphere (Hepburn, 2007). The idea of using property rights in response to an externality was put forward by Coase (1960). Coase's model of <b>social</b> <b>cost</b> assumes a situation of equal bargaining power among participants and equal costs of making the bargain (Toth et al.., 2001:668). Assigning property rights can be an efficient solution. This {{is based on the assumption}} that there are no bargaining/transaction costs involved in buying or selling these property rights, and that buyers and sellers have perfect information available when making their decisions.|$|E
25|$|Gulls are monogamous {{and colonial}} breeders that display mate {{fidelity}} that usually lasts {{for the life}} of the pair. Divorce of mated pairs does occur, but it apparently has a <b>social</b> <b>cost</b> that persists for a number of years after the break-up. Gulls also display high levels of site fidelity, returning to the same colony after breeding there once and even usually breeding in the same location within that colony. Colonies can vary from just a few pairs to over a hundred thousand pairs, and may be exclusive to that gull species or shared with other seabird species. A few species nest singly, and single pairs of band-tailed gulls may breed in colonies of other birds. Within colonies, gull pairs are territorial, defending an area of varying size around the nesting site from others of their species. This area can be as large as a 5-m radius around the nest in the herring gull to just a tiny area of cliff ledge in the kittiwakes.|$|E
