40|$|Recent investigations. 6, 12. 17 ' Indicate that clay {{minerals}} {{are not only}} important in cation exchange reactions in soils but they are perhaps a. major factor in governing the availability of phosphate in many 8011 s. From these data. {{it appears that the}} kind of clay mineral predominating in the soil is of considerable importance. Soils In which montmorillonite predominates have a high cation exchange capacity, while kaolinite clays have a high anion exchange. Kaolinitic soils have a high capacity to remove phosphate from solution and to fix applied soluble phosphate fertilizers. The recovery of superphosphate by crops is frequently not over 20 per cent, and a recovery of less than 3 per cent has been re-ported 12 where data showed the predominating clay mineral present in the soil was kaolinitic In character. The <b>silica-sesquioxide</b> <b>ratio</b> of the colloid is not an entirely reliable index as to the type of clay present but is highly indicative of it. In kao-linitic clays 14 the <b>silica-sesquioxide</b> <b>ratio</b> is approximately 2. Gile 6 re-ports data showing low efficiency of superphosphate when applied to solls in which the colloid present has a low <b>silica-sesquioxide</b> <b>ratio</b> and a much greater efficiency when the ratio was higher. The types of {{clay minerals}} prE-sent were not further identified. Gans 4, about twenty-five years ago, suggested a relationship between colloid composition and phosphate avail-ability. Roszmann 16 suggested the possibility of phosphate retention by clays in 1927. Highly weathered soils are very often kaolinitic in character. In many soil series 1. 11 more than one type of clay mineral is present. This is to be expected. trom the reports 6. 11. 14. 16 on clay mineral formation.

40|$|This work {{involved}} onsite {{observation of}} the production process; determination of physical properties and chemical composition of the soil sample used for production of Makurdi burnt bricks (MBB). A total of 22 brick specimens, of the MBB was examined in the laboratory for compressive strength, water absorption and abrasion resistance. The results reveal the soil sample as a true laterite having a <b>Silica-Sesquioxide</b> <b>ratio</b> of 1. 01, Silica content of 42. 95 and clay content of 27. 38 and total clay + silt content of 30. 78. The Atterberg’s limit test gave the liquid limit as 36. 79; plastic limit, 26. 11 and plastic index, 10. 68. Compressive strength was 3. 46 N/mm 2 and 11. 75 N/mm 2 for Samples A and B respectively; Average water absorption for Sample B (16. 49 %) was double that of Sample A (8. 58 %) while the Abrasion resistance ability of Sample B (33. 67 %) was four times better than Sample A (9. 32 %) ...|$|E
40|$|This is {{the final}} {{published}} version. It was first published by IISTE at [URL] ambiguity {{of the use of}} the term ‘laterite’ to generally classify tropical soils especially for engineering purposes needed to be addressed. An attempt was made to analyze the <b>silica-sesquioxide</b> <b>ratio</b> of some Niger Delta soils to establish whether these soils which are formed in the tropic are indeed laterites. This ratio is used because it is generally accepted as a parameter in the classification and specification of laterites and can be measured with some degree of accuracy in the laboratory. This study revealed that these soils (except the ferralsols) which were soft when wet and significantly hard when air-dried could not be called laterite soils because of the high silica-sesquioxide ratios. It is envisaged that this study would help the engineers in the region to have a better understanding of the soils which are erroneously acclaimed and handled as laterite soils...|$|E
40|$|The soils of {{the lower}} Mississippi Delta are derived from the Mississippi or Red River {{depositions}} {{or some combination of}} these two. Profiles of the Iberia, Baldwin, Buxin, Sharkey, and Mhoon were selected for the study. The comparative results indicate that the Sharkey was highest in cation ex-change capacity and exchangeable calcium and magnesium. Base saturation was highest in the Iberia and lowest in the Baldwin. The variation in cation exchange capacity was possibly due, in general, to the differences in texture, except for the Iberia. The clay fraction of the Iberia contained slightly larger quantities of high cation exchange capacity minerals than the other soil series of the study. Silica was highest in the Baldwin while the oxides of aluminum, iron, magnesium, and potassium were highest in the Buxin. liberia was highest in calcium oxide. Silica-sesquioxide and silica-ferric oxide ratios were highest in the Sharkey and lowest in the Buxin. The silica-alumina ratio was highest in the Baldwin and lowest in the Buxin. The comparison of the Buxin with soils of the Mississippi River deposition indicates that the Red River depositions were generally lower in <b>silica-sesquioxide</b> <b>ratios</b> and total calcium oxide and higher in total magnesia nd potash. The X-ray patterns indicate that montmorillonite and illite were the dominant clay minerals present. The greatest quantities of montmorillonite were generally found in the Iberia profiles, although this was not always true. Also, in general, the content of montmorillonite increased and illite decreased with profile depth. Secondary minerals were halloysite, kaolinite, vermiculite, and chlorite. The cation exchange capacity of the clay fraction also indicated the higher content of montmorillonite or associated minerals in the Iberia than in the Buxin, Baldwin, Sharkey or Mhoon soils...|$|R
40|$|In {{addition}} to previous {{work done by}} Enaworu et al., (2016) on the geochemical and geotechnical (compaction) analysis of lateritic soils located at Okpanam area in the Anambra Basin, this paper presents further work done on lateritic soils at a different location (Azagba – Ogwashi area). The major elements geochemistry and compaction characteristics of lateritic soils in Azagba – Ogwashi area, located in the Anambra Basin were investigated. This was {{with a view to}} ascertain their <b>silica-sesquioxide</b> <b>ratio</b> in order to classify them into lateritic soils and assessing the suitability of these lateritic soils as highway sub-base and sub-grade construction materials. Bulk samples of soil were collected from two separate horizons – A and B at depths of 1. 08 m and 3. 42 m respectively from an outcrop. The major elements geochemical analysis was carried out by means of Atomic Absorption Spectrometry (AAS). The geotechnical (compaction) analysis, was executed by following the modified American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) test (T- 180). The amount of total irons in terms of iron III oxide ranged from 6. 75 % - 8. 91 % in depths 1. 08 m and 3. 42 respectively. Silica-sesquioxide of iron and aluminum molar ratios at depths of 1. 08 m and 342 m were between 1. 77 and 1. 64 respectively. Compaction characteristics values for this area varied with sampling depth, at a Maximum Dry Density (MDD) range of 1. 86 g/cm 3 to 1. 91 g/cm 3 and an Optimum Moisture Content (OMC) range of 16. 0 % to 14. 5 % for depths 1. 08 m and 3. 42 respectively. With these values, the soils can be compacted at specific optimum moisture contents thereby ensuring the subsequent use of these soils as sub-grade and sub-base highway construction materials...|$|E
40|$|In the {{development}} of a liming program for the acid soils of the Hawaiian Islands, it was found that soils of the various great soil groups varied greatly in their lime requirement for correction of similar degrees of acidity. This variation in lime requirement appeared {{to be associated with the}} differences in the buffering capacities of the soils. Titration curves were made on more than a hundred soils selected from the typical profiles of the soil families belonging to the various great soil groups. The results of this study have justified the following conclusion regarding the nature of the titration curves and buffering capacities of the tropical and subtropical soils of the Hawaiian Islands: The buffering capacity of Hawaiian soils was much lower than that found for soils of the temperate regions. The buffering capacity of the soils of the different great soil groups varied greatly; however, there was very little variation in the degree of buffering exhibited by the soils of the different soil families of each group. Each soil group has a typical titration curve. The soils of the low humic latosol and humic ferruginous latosol have the lowest buffering capacity, and the soils of the hydroI humic latosol and brown forest groups exhibit the greatest degree of buffering. The organic matter fraction of the soil affects the degree of buffering above soil reaction of pH 5. 5. It is most "active" in neutral and alkaline portions of the titration curves. However, the organic matter fraction does not influence the nature of the curve. The general character of the titration curve is determined by the nature of the clay minerals. The kaolinite and iron oxide clays give rise to titration curves having a low buffering capacity and montmorillonite and hydrated aluminum oxide clays give titration curves having a high buffering capacity. The <b>silica-sesquioxide</b> <b>ratio</b> of the clay fraction of the soil or the quantity of clay in the soil was not related to the degree of buffering exhibited by the titration curve of the soil. This is probably due to the large amount of "free oxides" found in these soils. There is a direct relation ship between the cation exchange capacity of the soil and its buffering capacity. The higher the cation exchange capacity the greater buffering would be exhibited by the titration curve of the soil...|$|E
