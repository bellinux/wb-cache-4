5|$|The {{diploid number}} of {{chromosomes}} in the cheetah is 38, {{the same as}} in most other felids (though for the ocelot and the margay the number is 36). A remarkable feature of the cheetah is its unusually low genetic variability in comparison to other felids. Consequently, individuals show considerable genetic similarity to one another, as illustrated by skin grafts, electrophoretic evidence and reproductive surveys. A prolonged period of inbreeding, following a genetic bottleneck during the last ice age, {{is believed to be the}} reason behind this anomaly. The consequences of such genetic uniformity might include a low sperm count, decreased <b>sperm</b> <b>motility,</b> deformed flagella, difficulty in captive breeding and susceptibility to disease.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} 2. 45 GHz Microwave (MW) radiation exposures on the reproductive functions in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Materials and methods: 36 rats obtained from the College of Medicine animal house, weighing between 0. 100 and 0. 120 kg, grouped into 6 and acclimatized for 2 weeks were used. Each group was exposed to specific absorption ratio (SAR) of 0. 00 (control), 0. 48, 0. 95, 1. 43, 1. 91 and 2. 39 W kg- 1 respectively in the irradiation chamber. Variations in the bodyweights, organ weights, <b>sperm</b> gross <b>motility,</b> <b>sperm</b> morphology and sperm counts were determined for various values of applied SARs using standard methods. Results: MW exposures reduced the growth rates and organ weights in a proportion that depended on the applied SAR. Exposures reduced the <b>sperm</b> concentration, gross <b>motility</b> and increased abnormal sperm cells. The highest increases in body weight and the lowest <b>sperm</b> gross <b>motility</b> were observed in the youngest age group exposed to 0. 48 W kg- 1. This same trend was observed in sperm counts and changes in sperm morphology. The live to dead ratio from the semen analysis of smears showed that low SARs MW exposure caused death of sperm cells as demonstrated by cell membrane taking up the eosin-nigrosin vital stain. Conclusion: MW radiation exposures caused reduction in <b>sperm</b> counts and <b>motility</b> and increased the proportion of abnormal sperm cells and induced reduction in <b>sperm</b> count and <b>motility</b> while increasing the proportion of abnormal sperm cells. ...|$|R

40|$|Background: Infertility can {{be caused}} by {{prolonged}} use of paracetamol that leads to a decrease in the <b>sperm</b> concentration, <b>motility,</b> and morphology.

Methods: An experimental study was conducted in the Laboratory of Cell Biology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Padjadjaran, during October–November 2012.

40|$|Objectives. To {{quantify}} semen {{quality in}} the Greenlandic population. Study design. A cross-sectional study including recently proven fertile men from four regions including nine municipalities and one settlement in Greenland. Methods. The samples were analysed for sperm cell concentrations and mo-tility using standard methods. Results. In total 201 semen samples were collected. The median sperm cell concentration of fertile men in Greenland was 53 x 106 sperm cells/ml, with a median sperm cell vo-lume of 3. 2 ml, a total sperm count of 185. 6 x 106 sperm cells and a median motility of 60 %. Regionally there were no statistical significant difference in sperm counts, but the <b>sperm</b> cell <b>motility</b> differed among regions, with the lowest <b>sperm</b> cell <b>motility</b> found in semen samples collected on the east coast. Overall sperm cell concentration and total sperm count in Greenland {{seems to be in}} the lower range compared to studies from Europe, USA and Japan. Conclusion. Within Greenland the sperm cell concentration appears to be similar in different regions, but <b>sperm</b> cell <b>motility</b> tends to be lower in men from the east coast.

40|$|Introduction. This study aims to {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of Tualang honey on sperm parameters, erectile function, and hormonal and safety profiles. Methodology. A randomized control trial was done using Tualang honey (20 grams) and Tribestan (750 [*]mg) over a period of 12 weeks. Sperm parameters including <b>sperm</b> concentration, <b>motility,</b> and morphology were analyzed and erectile function was assessed using IIEF- 5 questionnaire. Hormonal profiles of testosterone, FSH, and LH were studied. The volunteers were randomized into two groups and the outcomes were analyzed using SPSS version 18. Results. A total of 66 participants were involved. A significant increment of mean sperm concentration (P< 0. 001), motility (P= 0. 015) and morphology (P= 0. 008) was seen in Tualang honey group. In Tribestan group, a significant increment of mean sperm concentration (P= 0. 007), and morphology (P= 0. 009) was seen. No significant differences of <b>sperm</b> concentration, <b>motility,</b> and morphology were seen between Tualang honey and Tribestan group and similar results were also seen in erectile function and hormonal profile. All safety profiles were normal and no adverse event was reported. Conclusion. Tualang honey effect among oligospermic males was comparable with Tribestan in improving <b>sperm</b> concentration, <b>motility,</b> and morphology.

40|$|Background: The aim of {{this study}} was to detect Chlamydia trachomatis, Mycoplasma hominis and Ureaplasma urealyti¬cum from semen samples of {{infertile}} men by Multiplex PCR and investigation of influence of bacteriospermia on semen parame¬ters. Methods: Semen samples of 200 infertile men were evaluated by Multiplex PCR. In addition, analysis of semen parameters was performed according to the WHO guidelines. Results: All the patients were without clinical symptoms of urogenital tract infection. Thirty three percent of cases showed at least one bacterium. We found a noticeable relation between the presence of bacteriospermia and the rate of non motile and morphologically abnormal sperms (P 0. 05).

50|$|Sperm {{movement}} is activated {{by changes in}} intracellular ion concentration. The changes in ion concentration that provoke motility are different among species.
