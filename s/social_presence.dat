25|$|Another {{interesting}} line {{of research}} is that which examines women's mate preferences across the ovulatory cycle. The theoretical underpinning {{of this research is}} that ancestral women would have evolved mechanisms to select mates with certain traits depending on their hormonal status. For example, the theory hypothesizes that, during the ovulatory phase of a woman's cycle (approximately days 10–15 of a woman's cycle), a woman who mated with a male with high genetic quality would have been more likely, on average, to produce and rear a healthy offspring than a woman who mated with a male with low genetic quality. These putative preferences are predicted to be especially apparent for short-term mating domains because a potential male mate would only be offering genes to a potential offspring. This hypothesis allows researchers to examine whether women select mates who have characteristics that indicate high genetic quality during the high fertility phase of their ovulatory cycles. Indeed, studies have shown that women's preferences vary across the ovulatory cycle. In particular, Haselton and Miller (2006) showed that highly fertile women prefer creative but poor men as short-term mates. Creativity may be a proxy for good genes. Research by Gangestad et al. (2004) indicates that highly fertile women prefer men who display <b>social</b> <b>presence</b> and intrasexual competition; these traits may act as cues that would help women predict which men may have, or would be able to acquire, resources.|$|E

[...] Nick Yee in his PhD thesis at Stanford discovered that real world proxemic distances also were applied in the virtual world of Second Life Other studies demonstrate that implicit behavioral measures such as body posture can be a reliable measure of the user's sense of presence in virtual environments. Similarly, personal space may be a more reliable measure of <b>social</b> <b>presence</b> than a typical ratings survey in immersive virtual environments.|$|E

60|$|Such, as I say, is our easy {{relation}} {{to the sound of}} a voice raised, even however allusively and casually, on behalf of that great national and <b>social</b> <b>presence</b> which has always most oppositely, most sensibly, most obsessively, as I surely may put it, and above all most dazzlingly, neighboured and admonished us here: after such a fashion as really to have made the felt breath of its life, across an interval constantly narrowing, a part of our education as distinguished from our luck. Our luck in all our past has been enormous, the greatest luck on the whole, assuredly, that any race has ever had; but it has never been a conscious reaction or a gathered fruition, as one may say; it has just been a singular felicity of position and of temperament, and this felicity has made us observe and perceive and reflect much less than it has made us directly act and profit and enjoy: enjoy of course by attending tremendously to all the business involved in our position. So far as we have had reactions, therefore, they have not sprung, when they have been at all intensified, from the extraordinary good fortune of our state. Unless indeed I may put it that what they have very considerably sprung from has been exactly a part of our general prodigy--the good fortune itself of our being neighboured by a native genius so different from our own, so suggestive of wondrous and attaching comparisons, as to keep us chronically aware of the difference and the contrast and yet all the while help us to see into them and through them.|$|E
60|$|FERDINAND {{returned}} to his hotel in no very good humour, revolving in his mind Miss Temple's advice about optimism. What could she mean? Was there really a conspiracy to make him marry his cousin, and was Miss Temple one of the conspirators? He could scarcely believe this, {{and yet it was}} the most probable, deduction from all that had been said and done. He had lived to witness such strange occurrences, that no event ought now to astonish him. Only to think that he had been sitting quietly in a drawing-room with Henrietta Temple, and she avowedly engaged to be married to another person, who was present; and that he, Ferdinand Armine, should be the selected companion of their morning ride, and be calmly invited to contribute to their daily amusement by his <b>social</b> <b>presence!</b> What next? If this were not an insult, a gross, flagrant, and unendurable outrage, he was totally at a loss to comprehend what was meant by offended pride. Optimism, indeed! He felt far more inclined to embrace the faith of the Manichee! And what a fool was he to have submitted to such a despicable, such a degrading situation! What infinite weakness {{not to be able to}} resist her influence, the influence of a woman who had betrayed him! Yes! betrayed him. He had for some period reconciled his mind to entertain the idea of Henrietta's treachery to him. Softened by time, atoned for by long suffering, extenuated by the constant sincerity of his purpose, his original imprudence, to use his own phrase in describing his misconduct, had gradually ceased to figure as a valid and sufficient cause for her behaviour to him. When he recollected how he had loved this woman, what he had sacrificed for her, and what misery he had in consequence entailed upon himself and all those dear to him; when he contrasted his present perilous situation with her triumphant prosperity, and remembered that while he had devoted himself to a love which proved false, she who had deserted him was, by a caprice of fortune, absolutely rewarded for her fickleness; he was enraged, he was disgusted, he despised himself for having been her slave; he began even to hate her. Terrible moment when we first dare to view with feelings of repugnance the being that our soul has long idolised! It is the most awful of revelations. We start back in horror, as if in the act of profanation.|$|E
50|$|<b>Social</b> <b>presence</b> theory classifies {{different}} communication media along a one-dimensional {{continuum of}} <b>social</b> <b>presence,</b> where {{the degree of}} <b>social</b> <b>presence</b> is equated {{to the degree of}} awareness of the other person in a communication interaction (Sallnas, Rassmus-Grohn, & Sjostrom, 2000). According to <b>social</b> <b>presence</b> theory, communication is effective if the communication medium has the appropriate <b>social</b> <b>presence</b> required for the level of interpersonal involvement required for a task. On a continuum of <b>social</b> <b>presence,</b> the face-to-face medium is considered to have the most <b>social</b> <b>presence,</b> and written, text-based communication the least. It is assumed in <b>social</b> <b>presence</b> theory that in any interaction involving two parties, both parties are concerned both with acting out certain roles and with developing or maintaining some sort of personal relationship. These two aspects of any interaction are termed interparty and interpersonal exchanges (Short, Williams, & Christie, 1976).|$|E

5000|$|Trying {{to define}} <b>social</b> <b>presence</b> is a {{difficult}} matter as researchers are not in agreement themselves over what this phenomenon encompasses. There is no consistent definition for <b>social</b> <b>presence</b> within research literature yet. <b>Social</b> <b>presence</b> {{has been defined as}} [...] "a measure of the feeling of community that a learner experiences in an online environment" [...] (Tu and McIssac, 2002). Other researchers have defined <b>social</b> <b>presence</b> as the awareness of others in an interaction combined with an appreciation of the interpersonal aspects of that interaction (Short, Williams, and Christie, 1976; Rice, 1993; Walther, 1992). Gunawardena (1995) argued that <b>social</b> <b>presence</b> varied in perception and was a subjective issue based upon objective qualities. Yet despite these variations, the role of <b>social</b> <b>presence</b> in the success of students is agreed upon and the need to design for it is in agreement.|$|E
50|$|As {{computer-mediated}} communication {{has evolved}} a more relational view of <b>social</b> <b>presence</b> has emerged. <b>Social</b> <b>presence</b> {{has come to}} be viewed as the way individuals represents themselves in their online environment. It's a personal stamp that indicates that the individual is available and willing to engage and connect with other persons in their online community. <b>Social</b> <b>presence</b> is demonstrated by the way messages are posted and how those messages are interpreted by others. <b>Social</b> <b>presence</b> defines how participants relate to one another which in turn affects their ability to communicate effectively (Kehrwald, 2008).|$|E
50|$|<b>Social</b> <b>presence</b> {{refers to}} {{the degree to which}} a medium permits communicators to {{experience}} others as being psychologically present or {{the degree to which a}} medium is perceived to convey the actual presence of the communicating participants. Tasks that involve interpersonal skills, such as resolving disagreements or negotiation, demand high <b>social</b> <b>presence,</b> whereas tasks such as exchanging routine information require less <b>social</b> <b>presence.</b> Therefore, face-to-face media like group meetings are more appropriate for performing tasks that require high social presence; media such as email and written letters are more appropriate for tasks that require low <b>social</b> <b>presence.</b>|$|E

50|$|<b>Social</b> <b>presence</b> is a {{significant}} feature for improving instructional effectiveness in any setting, {{and one of the}} most significant features of distance education. Tu (2000,2001) argued that within distance learning, <b>social</b> <b>presence</b> rests upon three dimensions, social context, online communication, and interactivity. Social contexts contribute to a predictable degree of perceived <b>social</b> <b>presence.</b> Social contexts involve task orientation (Steinfield, 1986), privacy (Steinfield, 1986), topics (Argyle and Dean, 1965; Walther, 1992), social relationships (Walther, 1992) and social process (Walther, 1992). As an example, when a conversation is task based and public without a sense of community being in place, the perception of <b>social</b> <b>presence</b> is low and affective filter (a communication blockage brought about by negative emotional feelings) is high.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Social</b> <b>presence</b> theory (Short, et al., 1976) is {{a seminal}} {{theory of the}} social effects of {{communication}} technology. Its main concern is with telephony and telephone conferencing (the research {{was sponsored by the}} British Post Office, now British Telecom). It argues that the social impact of a communication medium depend on the <b>social</b> <b>presence</b> it allows communicators to have. <b>Social</b> <b>presence</b> is defined as a property of the medium itself: the degree of acoustic, visual, and physical contact that it allows. The theory assumes that more contact will increase the key components of [...] "presence": greater intimacy, immediacy, warmth and inter-personal rapport. As a consequence of <b>social</b> <b>presence,</b> social influence is expected to increase. In the case of communication technology, the assumption is that more text-based forms of interaction (e-mail, instant messaging) are less social, and therefore less conducive to social influence.|$|E
