25|$|The Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA) {{was set up}} in 1842 with {{a mission}} to provide an {{education}} program and healthy sports to young men. The YMCA was responsible for providing swimming classes to countless numbers of American boys and teenagers. This included swimming in indoor pools. <b>Swimming</b> <b>trunks</b> were not permitted in their pools. In Lincoln, Nebraska in 1958, for example, learners were told just to bring a towel and not to bring trunks. In Sheboygan, Wisconsin in 1954, the Recreation Department reported that 404 youngsters had attended an 11-day swimming course where the boys were unhampered by bathing suits. When the YMCA began to admit females in the early 1960s, the wearing of bathing suits became a requirement.|$|E

500|$|Rod Pont (also {{known as}} Steve Day in Steve Day and the Drifters) remembered Storm {{arriving}} at the Orrell Park Ballroom for a concert with a boil on his face. When told about it, Storm pulled out a black velvet hood which had slits for his eyes and mouth, and played the whole concert with the hood on. At one concert at Bankfield House Youth club, Garston, Liverpool, in 1965, the stage lighting failed between sets. Storm was upset until someone walked in with a torch, which Storm used to finish the concert. He occasionally used a pet monkey {{in some of the}} group's performances, as it attracted more people. At a New Brighton swimming baths performance for 1,600 people in 1963, Storm climbed to the top diving board, undressed to a pair of <b>swimming</b> <b>trunks,</b> and then dived into the water {{at the end of a}} song. In January 1964, during a performance at the Majestic Ballroom, Birkenhead, he climbed up one of the columns supporting the balcony, but slipped and fell [...] to the floor below, fracturing his leg. At another performance on the New Brighton Pier, Storm made his way onto the Pavilion roof but fell through the glass skylight.|$|E

500|$|Sil first {{tries to}} mate with a man she meets at a nightclub (Anthony Guidera), but after sensing that he is diabetic, she rejects him. Unsatisfied, he [...] tries to rape her, {{prompting}} her to kill him by puncturing his skull with her tongue. She then tries {{to mate with}} John Carey (Whip Hubley), a man she meets after a car accident. They swim in Carey's pool where Sil forces him to open his <b>swimming</b> <b>trunks</b> in order to mate, but he refuses. This act is interrupted by Preston and Laura. She kills Carey, morphing into her alien form, a bipedal mutant with tentacles on her shoulders and back, and flees naked into a forest without being seen by the team. She pretends to be a rape victim to kidnap a woman (Marliese K. Schneider) in order to assume her identity. Sitting in the car near Carey's home, she reads Fitch's lips, as she had done earlier, learning of their plan to stake out the Nightclub for her return. There, she is seen by Dan, prompting a car chase. She fakes her death by crashing the car, which she has previously filled with gasoline containers, into a high-voltage transformer, using the kidnapped woman as a stand-in for her own body.|$|E

British manufacturers and retailers claim that most British men prefer [...] "trunks", or short boxer briefs. The director of menswear of major British retailer Marks & Spencer (M), which sells 40 million pairs of men's underpants a year, {{was quoted as saying}} that while boxer shorts were still the most popular at M, demand was easing off in favour of hipster trunks similar in design to the <b>swimming</b> <b>trunks</b> worn by actor Daniel Craig in the James Bond film Casino Royale (2006).|$|E

Microfiber can be made into Ultrasuede, an animal-free imitation suede leather-like product that is cheaper and easier to clean and sew than natural suede leather.|$|R
2500|$|... "On paper, {{it should}} never have happened. Hunt is Seventies man writ large {{and we should be}} {{grateful}} that species is extinct. He wears a vest and his hair looks like it was styled during a power cut. He runs along towpaths in skimpy orange <b>swimming</b> <b>trunks</b> and has a torso that's closer to a Party Seven than six pack. He has no concept of innocent until proved guilty and thinks it's acceptable to turn up to a swingers' evening with a prostitute he's just busted. He's racist, disablist and homophobic, and he calls his only female detective Flash Knickers. (And he means it as a compliment.) In fact when you see Hunt's qualities spelled out like that, it looks appalling. [...] the fact remains: Gene Hunt is my guilty secret, and I know scores of other women feel the same." ...|$|E
60|$|By {{the end of}} an hour a snug {{camp was}} completed. The {{blankets}} were spread, a supply of firewood was chopped from the seasoned driftwood, and over a fire the coffee pot had begun to sing. Saxon called to Billy, who was improvising a table from a wave-washed plank. She pointed seaward. On the far point of rocks, naked except for <b>swimming</b> <b>trunks,</b> stood a man. He was gazing toward them, and they could see his long mop of dark hair blown by the wind. As he started to climb the rocks landward Billy called Saxon's {{attention to the fact that}} the stranger wore tennis shoes. In a few minutes he dropped down from the rock to the beach and walked up to them.|$|E
60|$|In {{the week}} that {{followed}} at Papeete Grief caught numerous and bizarre glimpses of Aloysius Pankburn. So did {{everybody else in the}} little island capital; for neither the beach nor Lavina's boarding house had been so scandalized in years. In midday, bareheaded, clad only in <b>swimming</b> <b>trunks,</b> Aloysius Pankburn ran down the main street from Lavina's to the water front. He put on the gloves with a fireman from the Berthe in a scheduled four-round bout at the Folies Bergères, and was knocked out in the second round. He tried insanely to drown himself in a two-foot pool of water, dived drunkenly and splendidly from fifty feet up in the rigging of the Mariposa lying at the wharf, and chartered the cutter Toerau at more than her purchase price and was only saved by his manager's refusal financially to ratify the agreement. He bought out the old blind leper at the market, and sold breadfruit, plantains, and sweet potatoes at such cut-rates that the gendarmes were called out to break the rush of bargain-hunting natives. For that matter, three times the gendarmes arrested him for riotous behaviour, and three times his manager ceased from love-making long enough to pay the fines imposed by a needy colonial administration.|$|E

He often wore battered baseball caps of his favorite sports team, the Detroit Tigers.|$|R

5000|$|But culture clashes aside, Filif {{is a very}} personable sort of individual: curious, friendly, {{and very}} easy-going.

His favorite discoveries so far are baseball hats and bright colors, even if his fashion sense is, to put it politely, nonexistent. He calls them [...] "decorations" [...] and prefers bright orange <b>swim</b> <b>trunks</b> and Victoria's Secret lingerie. He is very magically powerful and excels at writing new spells, as well as designing illusions.|$|R

Andre, with jovial cruelty, makes the women serve his drink while he stands in the water, ruining their [...] "fine stilletto heels" [...] as he puts it.

2500|$|Men's swimsuits {{developed}} roughly {{in parallel}} to women's during this period, with the shorts covering progressively less.

Typically these are more popular in more tropical regions; however, {{they may also be}} worn at public swimming pools and inland lakes. But in the 1990s, longer and baggier shorts became popular, with the hems often reaching to the knees. Often called boardshorts and <b>swim</b> <b>trunks,</b> these were often worn lower on the hips than regular shorts.|$|R
