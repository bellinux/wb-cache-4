500|$|In {{writing a}} musical about film making in Hollywood, Sparks were also {{informed}} {{by their own}} past film projects. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, they had spent six years {{trying to get their}} film Mai, the Psychic Girl produced. Based on a Japanese manga comic, the film was at one time supposed to be directed by Tim Burton. Although the music had been completed, the film failed to materialise, an experience that coloured their portrayal of the studio head in The Seduction of Ingmar Bergman. Earlier, Sparks had worked with French director Jacques Tati on Confusion, another film project that remained uncompleted. Having had numerous meetings with Tati {{over the course of a}} year, they were aware that, like other great European directors, Tati had been wooed by Hollywood: [...] "He <b>showed</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> letter from Paramount", Ron Mael recalled. [...] "He said: 'Oooh! They take me to Hollywood and they have a limousine for me.' But it was kind of mocking of the whole similar situation to our fantasy Bergman thing. He could see Hollywood for what it was." ...|$|E

2500|$|In the {{beginning}} of January I delivered a small piece thereof to John Baptista Agnello, not telling what nor from whence, but prayed him to prove what metal was therein. And within three days I came to him for answer. He <b>showed</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> very little powder of gold, saying it came thereout, and willed me to give him another piece {{to make a better}} proof. [...] I did so, and within three days again he showed me more powder of gold. [...] I told him I would not believe it without better proof. He asked another piece to make a better proof, saying that he would make anatomy thereof. I gave it him saying that I marvelled much of his doings sith I had given pieces to other 3 to make proof who could find no such thing there. He answered me, Bisogna sapere adulare la natura.|$|E
2500|$|It {{must have}} been late 1941 or early 1942. Jews were {{required}} to wear the Star of David and to obey a 6p.m. curfew. I had gone {{to play with a}} Christian friend and had stayed too late. I turned my brown sweater inside out to walk the few blocks home. As I was walking down an empty street, I saw a German soldier approaching. He was wearing the black uniform that I had been told to fear more than others – the one worn by specially recruited SS soldiers. As I came closer to him, trying to walk fast, I noticed that he was looking at me intently. Then he beckoned me over, picked me up, and hugged me. I was terrified that he would notice the star inside my sweater. He was speaking to me with great emotion, in German. When he put me down, he opened his wallet, <b>showed</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> picture of a boy, and gave me some money. I went home more certain than ever that my mother was right: people were endlessly complicated and interesting. (Kahneman, 2003, p. 417) ...|$|E
2500|$|Recording for {{the album}} began in 1991, and {{continued}} into 1992, while {{taking place at}} Ian London Studios, North Shore Soundworks, and Power Play Studios. During this time, Redman did another collaboration with EPMD on their fourth album Business Never Personal (1992). As EPMD member Parish Smith was often credited for mentoring Hit Squad artists Das EFX and K-Solo, Erick Sermon helped mentor Redman throughout the album, while receiving co-production credits {{for most of the}} album's songs. In spite of this, Redman was still left alone throughout the majority of the writing and recording process. He later recollected [...] "For that whole album I was {{under a lot of pressure}} to learn, and learn quickly. Erick <b>showed</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> couple of recording moves, then threw me in the studio and just left me there. I had to learn and do it myself. Erick was always there if I really needed him, so it wasn't that bad. But he had his own shit to deal with and he figured I was okay on my own." [...] Redman further stated [...] "When I first started doing the album I was mad at Erick for leaving me in the studio. I was like 'what the fuck am I doing here?' I had an album to hit the world with, and it was just up to me. But I'm glad he did it, because I learned everything that I needed to." ...|$|E
