When she thinks she has finally made it, the band announces they have finished their career and the mall closes, leaving her in the dark.|$|E
5|$|Frank {{meets with}} Congressman Donald Blythe (Reed Birney), a {{committed}} progressive liberal {{who has long}} pushed for education reform, with whom the Walker administration wants {{to work on a}} bill. Frank dismisses his proposal as too ambitious and asks him to rewrite it. Frank secretly passes a copy of Blythe’s proposal to Zoe. He then meets with Senator Catherine Durant (Jayne Atkinson) and suggests that <b>she</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> consider seeking the nomination for Secretary of State. He also privately confronts Congressman Russo about his arrest and checkered history of substance abuse and soliciting prostitutes, and demands Russo’s loyalty in exchange for making the incident disappear.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} two weeks since Sheriff Graham's (Jamie Dornan) death, and the {{citizens}} of Storybrooke continue to mourn. Mr. Gold (Robert Carlyle) convinces Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison) <b>she</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> be sheriff, but Regina (Lana Parrilla) has already appointed Sidney Glass (Giancarlo Esposito) for the job. Henry (Jared S. Gilmore) suspects Regina is responsible for Graham's death and starts to believe good cannot defeat evil because good plays by the rules. Gold offers Emma his support and reveals to her the town charter which states the Mayor can only choose a candidate for Sheriff and therefore an election must be held. Emma decides to run, so Regina declares Sidney Glass will as well. Henry becomes worried when he finds out Gold is Emma's benefactor, considering how dangerous it is to owe him one favor, let alone two. Regina is furious that Gold would work against her.|$|E

25|$|Jane was {{appointed}} as a {{lady of the}} Queen's bedchamber on 15 July 1851. Although hard-working, loyal and devoted, she lacked the knowledge and discretion required for the role. In 1855, Mary Bulteel, later {{the wife of the}} Queen's private secretary Sir Henry Ponsonby, disapproved of Jane's conduct, and commented that “Lady E. is more utterly the reverse from what <b>she</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> be on this occasion than anybody can possibly conceive. I mean, I see she is preparing to be foolishly cringing to all the little miseries of etiquette...I quite long for somebody as the Queen's first lady with more natural dignity”. Despite her shortcomings, the Queen came to rely heavily on “Dearest Jane”, as she was referred to. The Queen required the utmost effort and devotion from her servants, and Jane followed this code of conduct with total deference to her royal mistress. However, her health suffered as a result, and it remained a constant burden throughout her waiting. In a letter from Henry Ponsonby to Sir Thomas Biddulph, another courtier, he reported that Jane “was principally taken up with her own health”. Jane was also concerned about her own health, and in 1876, she confided to Ponsonby that “she cannot go on as it is, that it is killing her”, and he advised her to write to the Queen threatening to resign if her position was not made easier. The Queen relented, but continued to impose restrictions on Jane's contact with the outside world. Jane's son, who became the 4th Marquess on {{the death of his father}} in 1857, was anxious to visit, but the Queen would not allow him to. Instead, he requested an interview with Ponsonby about his mother's arduous duties; Ponsonby accepted, but Jane said “oh no, perhaps the Queen would not like it”. Ponsonby referred to this fear of the Queen as absurd, knowing that the Queen would not be angry with him for paying a visit to Jane's son.|$|E

The lid {{of one of}} them (dated 1578) was {{returned}} to the church in 2010 by an antiques dealer who had purchased it several years before, thinking it to be a Tudor sugar lid. [...] Further investigations showed that it had once belonged to a nearby closed church that had transferred its silver to St Cwyllog's. A chance conversation between the antiques dealer and a local clergyman at an archeology group led to the discovery that the lid had the same silversmith's mark and fitted one of the chalices, and the dealer thereafter decided that <b>she</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> return it to the church.|$|E

500|$|A {{handsome}} riverboat gambler, Gaylord Ravenal, {{appears on}} the levee and is taken with eighteen-year-old Magnolia ("Nolie") Hawks, an aspiring performer and the daughter of Cap'n Andy and his wife Parthenia Ann (Parthy). Magnolia is likewise smitten with Ravenal ("Make Believe"). She seeks advice from Joe, a black dock worker aboard the boat, who has returned from buying flour for his wife Queenie, the ship's cook. He replies that there are [...] "lots like [...] on the river." [...] As Magnolia goes inside the boat to tell her friend Julie about the handsome stranger, Joe mutters that <b>she</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> ask the river for advice. He and the other dock workers reflect on the wisdom and indifference of [...] "Ol' Man River", who doesn't seem to care what the world's troubles are, but [...] "jes' keeps rollin' along".|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{political}} controversies and their age difference—he was fifteen years her senior—Helena {{was happy with}} Christian and was determined to marry him. As a younger son of a non-reigning duke, {{the absence of any}} foreign commitments allowed him to remain permanently in Britain—the Queen's primary concern—and she declared the marriage would go ahead. Helena and Christian were actually third cousins in descent from Frederick, Prince of Wales. Relations between Helena and Alexandra remained strained, and Alexandra was unprepared to accept Christian (who was also a third cousin to Alexandra in descent from King Frederick V of Denmark) as either a cousin or brother-in-law. The Queen never forgave the Princess of Wales for accusations of possessiveness, and wrote of the Waleses shortly afterwards: [...] "Bertie is most affectionate and kind but Alix [...] is by no means what <b>she</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> be. It will be long, if ever, before she regains my confidence." ...|$|E
500|$|Her media {{appearances}} were criticised {{for their}} awkwardness. In September 2012, Richard Seymour of The Guardian described how she [...] "fluffed her lines" [...] {{during an interview}} with STV reporter Bernard Ponsonby following her announcement of Labour's public service policy review. Peter Ross of The Scotsman cites another interview, {{in which she was}} repeatedly questioned about her views on the UK Trident programme. But he describes her in person as [...] "articulate, reflective, self-deprecating and at times very funny. It would be unfair to condemn her for not being a sound-bite politician; <b>she</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> be applauded for it, but the trouble is we live in a sound-bite age." [...] Mandy Rhodes of Holyrood magazine writes, [...] "despite a reputation as being a bit of a fierce one, [...] is actually, really rather entertaining, engaging and wonderfully self-deprecating." [...] The BBC's Marianne Taylor describes Lamont as [...] "Quietly spoken and more humorous in person than she comes across on television".|$|E

500|$|Early in {{the autumn}} of 1908, Potter wrote her {{publisher}} Harold Warne that she had several ideas for new books. She sent him the text of The Faithful Dove, a tale set in Rye she had composed years earlier and for which she had produced a group of sketches. With it, she included a sequel to The Tale of Benjamin Bunny starring Benjamin's offspring, The Flopsy Bunnies. Though she had complained at times that the rabbit characters had become [...] "wearisome", she had written a young fan, William Warner, that children liked her rabbits best and that <b>she</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> write another rabbit book. The third tale she sent Warne was about the village shop in Sawrey. [...] "I should like to get rid of one of them," [...] she wrote Warne about her story ideas, [...] "When a thing is once printed I dismiss it from my dreams! & don't care what becomes of the reviewers. But an accumulation of half finished ideas is bothersome." [...] The Tale of the Flopsy Bunnies and the story about the shop (eventually The Tale of Ginger and Pickles) were chosen for publication in 1909. [...] The Tale of the Flopsy Bunnies was finished in March 1909 and published in July of the same year.|$|E
500|$|In {{the book}} Skáldskaparmál, Idunn is {{mentioned}} {{in its first}} chapter (numbered as 55) as one of eight ásynjur (goddesses) sitting in their thrones at a banquet in Asgard for Ægir. In chapter 56, Bragi tells Ægir about Iðunn's abduction by the jötunn Þjazi. Bragi says that after hitting an eagle (Þjazi in disguise) with a pole, Loki finds himself stuck to the bird. Loki is pulled further and further into the sky, his feet banging against stones, gravel, and trees. Loki feels that his arms might be pulled out from his shoulders. Loki shouts and begs the eagle for a truce, and the eagle responds that Loki would not be free unless he made a solemn vow to have Iðunn come outside of Asgard with her apples. Loki accepts Þjazi's conditions and returns to his friends Odin and Hœnir. At the time Þjazi and Loki agreed on, Loki lures Iðunn out of Asgard into [...] "a certain forest", telling {{her that he had}} discovered some apples that she would find worth keeping, and told Iðunn that <b>she</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> bring her own apples with her so that she may compare them with the apples he has discovered. Þjazi arrives in eagle shape, snatches Iðunn, flies away with her and takes her to his home, Þrymheimr.|$|E
2500|$|After Jenkins and Dame Vera Lynn were {{together}} at centre {{stage at the}} 60th Anniversary of VE Day in 2005 during the song [...] "We'll Meet Again", the newspapers dubbed Jenkins [...] "the new Forces' Sweetheart", a nickname given to Lynn during World War II. Lynn had said to Jenkins that <b>she</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> [...] "go out and entertain the troops," [...] which Jenkins promised she would. In December 2005 and 2006 Jenkins travelled to Iraq to entertain the soldiers for Christmas. On her first visit to Iraq in 2005, when travelling to Shaibah, the largest British base in Southern Iraq, the helicopter she was travelling in was targeted by missiles. Anti-missile flares were deployed and the group landed safely.|$|E

The two decide that their friendship {{is more important than}} love and renounce their claims to her ("Though p'r'aps I may incur thy blame").

2500|$|Bobby Fryer, who had {{produced}} the Jean Brodie film, had collaborated with Katharine Hepburn {{to make the}} film version of Graham Greene's Travels with My Aunt (1972), specifically for George Cukor to direct. Cukor for some reason wasn't getting any work and Hepburn was casting around for projects. They asked Allen to come on board for the script, but she was busy and instead suggested Hugh Wheeler. After a few months, Fryer and Hepburn still weren't happy with Wheeler's script, so Allen agreed to work on the project and wrote a very straightforward script for them. But Hepburn had just starred in the disastrous adaptation of Madwoman of Chaillot and didn't want, in Allen's words, [...] "to play another crazy old lady." [...] Hepburn was reluctant to let Cukor down and wouldn't admit her reservations and began to find fault with the script, even rewriting many sections herself. Consequently, Allen finally gave up the endeavor, telling Hepburn that <b>she</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> write it herself, which the actress did. Eventually, Hepburn provoked the studio into making her quit the project, leaving Fryer free to bring Jean Brodies Maggie Smith on board to make the picture. One speech of Allen's remains in the script, otherwise it is all Hepburn's product. The Writer's Guild refused to put Hepburn's name on the script since she wasn't a guild member; Fryer refused to let Allen take her name off since she was the one he paid, and Wheeler was just burned that he received no credit at all.|$|E
