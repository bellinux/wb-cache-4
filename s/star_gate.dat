500|$|Clarke and Kubrick {{wrote the}} novel and {{screenplay}} simultaneously. Clarke opted for clearer explanations of the mysterious monolith and <b>Star</b> <b>Gate</b> in the novel; Kubrick made the film more cryptic by minimising dialogue and explanation. Kubrick said the film is [...] "basically a visual, nonverbal experience" [...] that [...] "hits the viewer at an inner level of consciousness, just as music does, or painting".|$|E
500|$|The script {{went through}} many stages.

By October 17, Kubrick had come up with what Clarke called a [...] "wild idea of slightly fag robots who create a Victorian environment to put our heroes at their ease." [...] HAL 9000 was originally named Athena after the Greek goddess of wisdom and had a feminine voice and persona.|$|E

The live-action landscape shots in the 'Star Gate' sequence were filmed in the Hebridean islands, the mountains of northern Scotland, and Monument Valley. The coloring and negative-image effects were achieved {{by the use of}} different color filters in the process of making duplicate negatives.|$|E
