40|$|The {{initiating}} somatic genetic {{events in}} chordoma development {{have not yet}} been identified. Most cytogenetically investigated chordomas have displayed near-diploid or moderately hypodiploid karyotypes, with several numerical and structural rearrangements. However, no consistent <b>structural</b> <b>chromosome</b> <b>aberration</b> has been reported. This is the first array-based study characterising DNA copy number changes in chordoma. Array comparative genomic hybridisation (aCGH) identified copy number alterations in all samples and imbalances affecting 5 or more out of the 21 investigated tumours were seen on all chromosomes. In general, deletions were more common than gains and no high-level amplification was found, supporting previous findings of primarily losses of large chromosomal regions as an important mechanism in chordoma development. Although small imbalances were commonly found, the vast majority of these were detected in single cases; no small deletion affecting all tumours could be discerned. However, the CDKN 2 A and CDKN 2 B loci in 9 p 21 were homo- or heterozygously lost in 70 % of the tumours, a finding corroborated by fluorescence in situ hybridisation, suggesting that inactivation of these genes constitute an important step in chordoma development.

Eggs {{were exposed to}} the inhibitor (10 μM) at various times after parthenogenetic stimulation, and chromosomes of them were analyzed at the first cleavage metaphase. When eggs {{were exposed to the}} inhibitor during the period from metaphase II to anaphase II, a significant increase in incidences of <b>structural</b> <b>chromosome</b> <b>aberrations</b> (51. 1 % versus 1. 3 % in the control) and aneuploidy (30. 3 % versus 0. 7 % in the control) was found. <b>Structural</b> <b>chromosome</b> <b>aberrations</b> were observed in 10 – 20 % of eggs following treatments during telophase II, but there was no increased incidence of aneuploidy in treatments during this meiotic stage. When pronuclear eggs at S phase were targeted by the inhibitor, no significant increase in <b>chromosome</b> <b>aberrations</b> was found. Interestingly, when chromatids moved to each pole during anaphase II in the presence of ICRF- 193, most of them oriented their centromeres toward the spindle equator as if moving backwards. Moreover, lagging chromatids with the centromeres present were observed in more than 50 % of treated eggs. However, chromosomal bridges that resulted from chromosome stickiness did not appear in any egg. These findings indicate that ICRF- 193 can induce <b>structural</b> <b>chromosome</b> <b>aberrations</b> and aneuploidy in mouse secondary oocytes in meiotic stage-dependent manner. The induction of aneuploidy is due to disruption of the separation of sister centromeres at anaphase II.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The in¯uence {{of culture}} media or {{centrifugation}} on chromosomes of immotile human sperm was examined using ICSI into mouse oocytes. METHODS: In experiment 1, immotile and motile human sperm retrieved directly from ejaculates were injected into mouse oocytes. In experiment 2, immotile human sperm {{were exposed to}} seminal plasma or one of four kinds of culture media (HEPES-BWW, modi®ed-BWW, modi®ed-human tubal ¯uid (HTF) and Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline) for 1. 5 ± 2. 5 h at 18 °C in air before microinjection. In experiment 3, immotile human sperm were centrifuged along with HEPES-BWW before microinjection. In experiment 4, frozen±thawed immotile human sperm washed with seminal plasma or HEPES-BWW were injected into mouse oocytes. The hybrid oocytes were prepared for chromosome slides at ®rst cleavage metaphase and were then exam-ined cytogenetically. RESULTS: In experiment 1, there was no signi®cant difference in the incidences of <b>structural</b> <b>chromosome</b> <b>aberrations</b> between motile and immotile sperm (4. 3 % versus 5. 8 %). In experiment 2, culture media caused more frequent <b>structural</b> <b>chromosome</b> <b>aberrations</b> (14. 3 ± 32. 6 %) in immotile sperm than did seminal plasma (5. 4 %). In experiment 3, <b>structural</b> <b>chromosome</b> <b>aberrations</b> were found in 48. 1 % of the centrifuged immotile sperm, and a live/dead sperm viability test intimated that the aberrant sperm were probably dead. In experiment 4, the incidence of <b>structural</b> <b>chromosome</b> <b>aberrations</b> in frozen±thawed immotile sperm was signi®cantly higher in HEPES-BWW (62. 2 %) than in seminal plasma (17. 2 %). CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that immotile sperm do not have signi®cantly more DNA lesions than motile sperm, although DNA of immotile sperm appears to be vulnerable to damage caused by different culture media.

40|$|Background: Interaction between {{chemicals}} and genetic material results principally in {{two types of}} dezoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) alterations: first, changes in single genes {{at the molecular level}} and, second, chromosomal aberrations derived from breakage in the near coherence of chromosomes. Too {{little is known about the}} chromosomal effects of metal exposure. The aim of this study was to detect cytogenetic damage in mine workers working in a lead–zinc mine, which could be associated with a combined exposure to lead, zinc and cadmium like heavy metals and to determine risk factors for the frequencies of structural chromosomal aberrations (SCA) in peripheral blood lymphocytes of mine workers. The present article attempts to synopsize current knowledge of the chromosomal effects caused by heavy metal exposure, point out the existing gaps in this knowledge and discuss future research needs.

40|$|Aneuploidy {{has been}} {{well-documented}} in blastocyst embryos, but prior {{studies have been}} limited in scale and/or lack mechanistic data. We previously reported preclinical validation of microarray 24 -chromosome preimplantation genetic screening in a 24 -h protocol. The method diagnoses chromosome copy number, structural chromosome aberrations, parental source of aneuploidy and distinguishes certain meiotic from mitotic errors. In this study, our objective was to examine aneuploidy in human blastocysts and determine correspondence of karyotypes between trophectoderm (TE) and inner cell mass (ICM). We disaggregated 51 blastocysts from 17 couples into ICM {{and one or two}} TE fractions. The average maternal age was 31. Next, we ran 24 -chromosome microarray molecular karyotyping on all of the samples, and then performed a retrospective analysis of the data. The average per-chromosome confidence was 99. 95 %. Approximately 80 % of blastocysts were euploid. The majority of aneuploid embryos were simple aneuploid, i. e. one or two whole-chromosome imbalances. Structural chromosome aberrations, which are common in cleavage stage embryos, occurred in only three blastocysts (5. 8 %). All TE biopsies derived from the same embryos were concordant. Forty-nine of 51 (96. 1 %) ICM samples were concordant with TE biopsies derived from the same embryos. Discordance between TE and ICM occurred only in the two embryos with <b>structural</b> <b>chromosome</b> <b>aberration.</b> We conclude that TE karyotype is an excellent predictor of ICM karyotype.

Chromosome analysis of oocytes at metaphase II showed that treatment with VP- 16 at 50 h pre-hCG had no effect, but the treatments between 24 h pre-hCG and 2 h post-hCG often caused <b>structural</b> <b>chromosome</b> berrations. Although treatment at 4 h post-hCG had no effect, subsequent treatments at 6 h and 8 h post-hCG produced {{a significant increase in}} <b>structural</b> <b>chromosome</b> <b>aberrations.</b> No effect was found following treatment at 10 h post-hCG. The incidence of aneuploidy following exposure to VP- 16 was also dependent on the time of hCG injection. Taking the time course of meiotic progression in primary oocytes following hCG injection and pharmacokinetics of VP- 16 into consideration, it is likely that meiotic stages from late dictyate to diakinesis are highly sensitive to VP- 16, while stages at dictyate and from metaphase I to telophase I are relatively insensitive to the drug. Moreover, the effect of VP- 16 on <b>structural</b> <b>chromosome</b> <b>aberrations</b> and aneuploidy was dose-dependent. Chromosome analysis at metaphase I detected a frequent occurrence of <b>structural</b> <b>chromosome</b> <b>aberrations</b> in treated oocytes. This suggests that structural aberrations may be caused by disruption of cleavable complexes during chromosome condensation. Detection of chromosome bridges during anaphase I/telopahse I may support the hypothesis that induction of aneuploidy by VP- 16 is due to failure in decatenation of recombinant homologous chromosomes...|$|R

40|$|Aim To {{estimate}} genome {{damage in}} oropharyngeal cancer patients before, during, and after radiotherapy and {{to measure the}} persistence of caused genome damage relevant {{in the evaluation of}} secondary cancer risk. Methods DNA damage was evaluated in peripheral blood lymphocytes of 10 oropharyngeal cancer patients using alkaline comet assay, analysis of <b>structural</b> <b>chromosome</b> <b>aberrations,</b> and micronucleus assay. Blood samples were taken 2 hours before irradiation on day 1 of the first radiotherapy cycle, 2 hours after the application of the first dose, {{in the middle of the}} radiotherapy cycle, within 2 hours after the last received radiotherapy dose, and after 6 and 12 months after radiotherapy. Results In most participants, the highest level of primary DNA damage was recorded in blood samples collected after the administration of first radiation dose (mean tail length 25. 04 ± 6. 23 μm). Most patients also had increased frequency of comets with long tail-nucleus (LTN comets) after the administration of the first radiation dose (mean, 10. 50 ± 7. 71 per 100 comets), which remained increased in the middle of radiotherapy (mean, 18. 30 ± 27. 62 per 100 comets). Later on, the levels of primary DNA damage as recorded by the comet assay, slightly diminished. The frequency of <b>structural</b> <b>chromosome</b> <b>aberrations</b> in lymphocytes gradually increased during the radiation cycle (26. 50 ± 27. 72 per 100 metaphases at the end of the therapy), as well as the frequency of micronuclei (mean total number of micronuclei 167. 20 ± 35. 69 per 1000 binuclear cells).

The aim of our work was to {{evaluate}} the potential aneuploidogenic activity of estramustine, by analysing its cytogenetic effects induced in human lymphocytes. To estimate the ability of EM to induce mitotic spindle disturbances, two parameters were used: the presence of c-mitoses (according {{to the degree of}} chromatid spreading and contraction) and mitotic index evaluation (increase after exposure indicating the accumulation of mitoses). EM induced c-mitoses and mitotic index increases starting from the 4 microM dose: statistically significant increases were observed up to the highest dose (40 microM). A strong correlation between c-mitoses and mitotic index increase was found. The micronucleus (MN) assay combined with the fluorescence in situ hybridization technique with a pancentromeric DNA probe was also carried out. Compared to the control, EM induced significant MN increases in binucleated lymphocytes at two doses (8 - 16 microM). Moreover, we found that estramustine induced significant percentages of MN with positive hybridization signal at the same doses, confirming the presence of entire chromosomes in micronuclei. Additional experiments included induction of numerical and <b>structural</b> <b>chromosome</b> <b>aberrations,</b> and evaluation of sister chromatid exchanges (SCE) and satellited (D- and G-group chromosomes) chromosome associations.

Using fluorescence in situ hybridization-based methods, we are studying karyotype changes in a relatively rare subgroup of PTCs, i. e., tumors that arose in children following the 1986 nuclear accident in Chernobyl, Ukraine. Here, we report our technical developments and progress in deciphering complex <b>chromosome</b> <b>aberrations</b> in case S 48 TK, an aggressively growing PTC cell line, which shows an unusual high number of unbalanced translocations...|$|R
40|$|Two immortalized, {{differentiated}} {{mouse and}} rat hepatocyte lines were examined for {{their capacity to}} activate the indirectly acting mutagens aflatoxin B 1 (AFB 1), cyclophosphamide (CP), benzo(a) pyrene (BaP) and 7, 12 -dimethylbenz(a) anthracene (DMBA) into DNA reactive metabolites {{as determined by the}} induction of <b>structural</b> <b>chromosome</b> <b>aberrations</b> (CA) and sister chromatid exchange (SCE). The rat and mouse hepatocyte lines were able to efficiently activate either AFB 1, BaP, DMBA, or BaP and DMBA, respectively, as shown by significant clastogenic responses. SCE induction was apparent in both cell lines in response to each of the compounds. Due to the observed longterm maintenance of various liver specific functions as well as the capability to metabolize xenobiotics these cells may be a suitable assay system for the detection of indirectly acting mutagens...|$|R
40|$|The {{identification}} of chemical substances which increase {{the efficiency of}} radiation is important to make easier the obtention of plants with <b>structural</b> <b>chromosome</b> <b>aberrations</b> which {{may be used in}} an alternative program for hybrid maize production. The present work was carried out to investigate the effect of the chemical substance metronidazole in maize seedlings submitted to gamma radiation. Several treatments were done, soaking the seeds in solutions with varied concentrations of the active substance combined with solution filtration and gamma radiation. On the third day of the experiment, germination percentage, root and stem lengths were evaluated. At a high concentration (1, 250 mg/ 50 mL) metronidazole behaved as a radiosensibilizer in the presence of radiation. Even at a low concentration (250 mg/ 50 mL; 750 mg/ 50 mL) {{and in the absence of}} radiation, metronidazole behaved as toxic substance...|$|R
40|$|Male {{infertility}} {{might be}} clearly associated with aberrant DNA methylation patterns in human spermatozoa. An association between oxidative stress {{and the global}} methylation status of the sperm genome has also been suggested. The aim {{of the present study}} was to determine whether the global sperm DNA methylation status was affected in the spermatozoa of carriers of <b>chromosome</b> <b>structural</b> <b>aberrations.</b> The relationships between the 5 -methylcytosine (m 5 C) levels in spermatozoa and chromatin integrity status were evaluated. The study patients comprised male carriers of <b>chromosome</b> <b>structural</b> <b>aberrations</b> with reproductive failure (n = 24), and the controls comprised normozoospermic sperm volunteers (n = 23). The global m 5 C level was measured using thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and immunofluorescence (IF) techniques. The sperm chromatin integrity was assessed using aniline blue (AB) staining and TUNEL assay. The mean m 5 C levels were similar between the investigated <b>chromosome</b> <b>structural</b> <b>aberrations</b> carriers (P) and controls (K). However, sperm chromatin integrity tests revealed significantly higher values in chromosomal rearrangement carriers than in controls (P < 0. 05). Although the potential relationship between sperm chromatin integrity status and sperm DNA fragmentation and the m 5 C level juxtaposed in both analyzed groups (P vs K) was represented in a clearly opposite manner, the low chromatin integrity might be associated with the high hypomethylation status of the sperm DNA observed in carriers of <b>chromosome</b> <b>structural</b> <b>aberrations...</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{cytogenetic}} {{study was}} performed on 4, 117 Korean patients referred for suspected chromosomal abnormalities. <b>Chromosome</b> <b>aberrations</b> were identified in 17. 5 % of the referred cases. The most common autosomal abnormality was Down syndrome and Turner syndrome in abnormalities of sex chromosome. The proportions of different karyotypes in Down syndrome (trisomy 21 92. 5 %, translocation 5. 1 %, mosaic 2. 4 %) {{were similar to those}} reported in other countries. However, it was different in Turner syndrome (45, X 28. 1 %, mosaic 50. 8 %, 46, X, del (Xq) 4. 4 %, 46, X, i (Xq) 16. 7 %), in which proportions of mosaics and isochromosome, 46, X, i(Xq), were higher than those reported in other countries. In <b>structural</b> <b>chromosome</b> <b>aberrations</b> of autosome, translocation was the most common (43. 6 %), and duplication (21. 3 %), deletion (14. 4 %), marker chromosome (7. 9 %) and ring chromosome (4. 0 %) followed in order of frequency. Rates of several normal variant karyotypes were also described. Inversion of chromosome 9 was observed in 1. 7 % of total referred cases...|$|R
