40|$|The {{principal}} {{purpose of}} this study was to identify supervision models that are potentially useful to supervisors of agricultural instruction. In this article, the models that were selected served as the basis for creating the Escalation Model for instructional supervisors in agricultural education. The Escalation Model is divided into three levels that encompass different models <b>of</b> <b>supervision.</b> The models <b>of</b> <b>supervision</b> are placed on a continuum of structure, reward, and risk. As the supervisor matures in the supervisory process, it is proposed that the model <b>of</b> <b>supervision</b> used should change. With the change in supervisory models, the supervisor will progress in an upward direction on the continuum and facilitate more teacher-directed models <b>of</b> <b>supervision.</b> With teacher-directed models <b>of</b> <b>supervision,</b> the teacher and supervisor could experience greater reward from the supervisory process...|$|R
