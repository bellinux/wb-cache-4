40|$|Photograph of four {{architectural}} {{views and}} details of buildings in Mexico, some ca. 1900, others [s. d. ]. The first view (upper left) shows a <b>shadowed</b> <b>arched</b> walkway, lined with columns {{and the light}} coming from the left-hand side. The second (upper right) shows {{the side of a}} building at left, and a foliage-lined arched outdoor walkway at right. In the third image (lower left), a man stands outside the arched walkway {{on the first floor of}} a two-story structure. The last picture (lower right) shows a different view of the third shit, with a pointed monument in the foreground at right, and part of a tower behind the two-story structure which has an arched first-story and second floor with railing-lined windows...|$|R

60|$|By {{the light}} of our single lantern the great lonely room looked very gaunt and dreary. Save for the piles of staves and heaps of hoops there was {{absolutely}} nothing in it, {{with the exception of}} the mattress for the Doctor, which had been laid in the corner. We made a couple of seats and a table out of the staves, and settled down together for a long vigil. Severall had brought a revolver for me and was himself armed with a double-barrelled shot-gun. We loaded our weapons and laid them cocked within reach of our hands. The little circle of light and the black <b>shadows</b> <b>arching</b> over us were so melancholy that he went off to the house, and returned with two candles. One side of the cooperage was pierced, however, by several open windows, and it was only by screening our lights behind staves that we could prevent them from being extinguished.|$|R

60|$|From the <b>shadow</b> of the <b>arched</b> door there sprang two rough serving-men, bearded and gruff, great cudgels {{in their}} hands, {{to ask them}} who they were and what their errand. The Lady Mary had slipped from her horse and was {{advancing}} to the door, but they rudely barred her way.|$|R
60|$|Dick, who {{had been}} {{gripping}} the chair hard, let his hand fall slackly and turned away. Clare watched him cross the patio, and stood tensely still, fighting against an impulse to call him back as he neared the door. Then as he vanished into the <b>shadow</b> of the <b>arch</b> she sat down with sudden limpness and buried her hot face in her hands.|$|R
50|$|Tasmanian Parliament House {{is one of}} John Lee Archer's {{most notable}} projects. Its {{location}} on the waterfront of Sullivans Cove was seen as ideal for Hobart's new Customs House (which is what it was known as up until 1904). Designed in 1835, construction was completed in 1838 {{with the majority of}} labor being carried out by convicts. The Customs Department opened in September 1840 while the first session of Parliament occurred on 19 June 1841. Honey colored sandstone quarried from Salamanca place was used to construct the distinctly ‘Colonial Georgian' style building. Parliament House is one of the clearest examples of how Archer designed his work {{to have a sense of}} strength and permanence. The entrance hall is fitted with large Doric columns aimed at creating a significant threshold whilst the rusticated masonry and deeply <b>shadowed</b> <b>arches</b> accentuate the boldness of the building and its clean, clear lines. The Old Market Building once screened off the façade, but over its 120 years of existence and further land reclamation, flanking trees, flowerbeds and sweeping lawns, now surround it. Whilst significant renovations to the interior have taken place, and the slate roof was removed and replaced with tiles, the façade still remains today almost exactly how it was first constructed. Unlike a lot of Archer's penal projects, which have since been demolished, Parliament House is still occupied today by the Parliament of Tasmania. For this reason alone it is one of, if not the most significant project of Archer's entire career.|$|R
50|$|Peter Garrett {{was sworn}} in as Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts, but his shadow {{portfolio}} had included Climate Change and Water, which went to Senator Penny Wong. Three previous <b>shadow</b> ministers — <b>Arch</b> Bevis, Kate Lundy and Kerry O'Brien — were relegated to the back bench, while three others — Jan McLucas, Laurie Ferguson and Bob McMullan — were only sworn in as parliamentary secretaries.|$|R
6000|$|Pushing {{their path}} through this sad multitude, who took little note of them, at length {{they came to}} the nunnery on the sacred Via Dolorosa, which Wulf had seen when Godwin and he were in Jerusalem after they had been {{dismissed}} by Saladin from Damascus. Its door stood in the <b>shadow</b> of that <b>arch</b> where the Roman Pilate had uttered to all generations the words [...] "Behold the man!" ...|$|R
60|$|Cnut entered warmly into Cuthbert's plans; {{and finally}} it was {{arranged}} between them that {{six of the}} archers should nightly keep watch opposite the various entrances of the bishop's palace and of the two monasteries joining. Of course they could not patrol up and down without attracting attention, but they were to take up posts where they could closely observe the entrances, and were either to lie down and feign drunken sleep, or to conceal themselves within the <b>shadow</b> of an <b>arch</b> or other hiding-place.|$|R
60|$|This {{is the sum}} and {{substance}} of some conversations held while rambling among these scenes, {{going in and out}} of arches, climbing into nooks and through loopholes, picking moss and ivy, and occasionally retreating under the <b>shadow</b> of some <b>arch,</b> while the skies were indulging in a sudden burst of emotion. The poor woman who acted as our guide, ensconcing herself in a dry corner, stood like a literal Patience on a monument, waiting for us to be through; we were sorry for her, but as it was our first and last chance, and she would stay there, we could not help it.|$|R
60|$|Donna Violetta had {{scarcely}} spoken, {{before her}} person was <b>shadowed</b> beneath the <b>arches</b> of the Broglio. Her governess {{clung to her}} side, more in affection than {{in compliance with the}} warnings of the monk, or with the dictates of her own reason. A vague and romantic intention of throwing herself {{at the feet of the}} Doge, who was a collateral descendant of her own ancient house, had flashed across the mind of the youthful bride, when she first fled; but no sooner had they reached the palace, than a cry from the court acquainted them with its situation, and consequently with the impossibility of penetrating to the interior.|$|R
60|$|Minute after minute passed, and Schwartz Carl, {{holding his}} arbelast in his hand, stood silently waiting and {{watching}} in the sharp-cut, black {{shadow of the}} doorway, motionless as a stone statue. Minute after minute passed. Suddenly there was a movement in the <b>shadow</b> of the <b>arch</b> of the great gateway across the court-yard, and the next moment a leathern-clad figure crept noiselessly out upon the moonlit pavement, and stood there listening, his head bent to one side. Schwartz Carl knew very well {{that it was no}} one belonging to the castle, and, from the nature of his action, that he was upon no good errand.|$|R
6000|$|... "For {{a moment}} I saw, then all was gone, and I found myself--I know not why--walking toward the mighty arch whereon sat the iron dragons. In its shadow I {{turned and looked}} back. There {{at the head of}} the pool the man was seated in his chair, and to right and to left of him came the black doves and the white doves in countless multitudes, all the {{thousands}} of them that had been stayed in their flight pouring down upon him at once--or so I thought. They wheeled about his head, they hid his face from me, and I--I departed into the <b>shadow</b> of the <b>arch,</b> and I saw him and them no more." ...|$|R
50|$|The DeRoy Auditorium is {{a nearly}} square two-story {{windowless}} steel-frame {{building with a}} flat roof with broadly projecting eaves. The façades are clad in narrow gray-colored cast concrete panels with white marble chips. On all four sides, raised ribs are overlaid on the panels, terminating in Gothic arches just beneath the eaves. The ribs project about four inches at ground level, but gradually increase in depth {{toward the top of}} the building until they project almost two feet near the top. The broad eaves and curving, projecting ribs create striking <b>shadows.</b> The gothic <b>arch</b> treatment on the DeRoy Auditorium is strongly similar to Yamasaki's design of the United States Science Pavilion at the 1962 World’s Fair in Seattle, a commission he received while working on the DeRoy Auditorium.|$|R
60|$|The two comrades did {{not dare}} to do any work during the day, for fear they should be {{surprised}} by the jailer, or observed from without. No one came near them, but they ate their loaves and drank their water with the appetite of men who had often known {{what it was to}} be without even such simple food as that. The instant that night fell they were both up upon the pegs, grinding away at the hard stone and tugging at the bars. It was a rainy night, and there was a sharp thunder-storm, but they could see very well, while the <b>shadow</b> of the <b>arched</b> window prevented their being seen. Before midnight they had loosened one bar, and the other was just beginning to give, when some slight noise made them turn their heads, and there was their jailer standing, open-mouthed {{in the middle of the}} cell, staring up at them.|$|R
60|$|She had {{expected}} him to make some protestation--perhaps even to claim some reward. But the instinct which made him forbear even in thought {{to take advantage of}} the duty laid upon him, which dominated even his miserable passion for her, and made it subservient to his exaltation of honor; this epaulet of the officer, and blood of the gentleman, this simple possession of knighthood not laid on by perfunctory steel, but springing from within--all this, I grieve to say, was partly unintelligible to Maruja, and not entirely satisfactory. Since he had entered the room they seemed to have changed their situations; he was no longer the pleading lover that trembled at her feet. For one base moment she thought it was the result of his knowledge of her mother's weakness; but the next instant, meeting his clear glance, she colored with shame. Yet she detained him vaguely a moment before the grated door in the secure <b>shadow</b> of the <b>arch.</b> He might have kissed her there! He did not.|$|R
60|$|They {{left the}} room together, but parted in the hall. Mrs. de Vaux stayed {{to speak to the}} {{housekeeper}} for a moment, and Paul ascended the broad staircase alone. On the first corridor he paused, standing before the deep-cushioned sill of a high-arched window, and gazing at the ruined portion of the abbey. The air outside was frosty and clear, and though the moon as yet was only faintly yellow, every arch and cloister was clearly visible. Paul gazed down at them, as he had done all his life, with reverent eyes. There was something almost awesome in the graceful yet bold outline, and in the great age of those rugged, moss-grown pillars and arches, so ecclesiastical in their shape and suggestiveness,--as indeed they might well be, for they were practically the ruins of the old monastery chapel. But, as he looked, the expression in his eyes suddenly changed. A dark figure had passed slowly out from the <b>shadow</b> of the <b>arches,</b> and stood looking up towards the house, rigid, solemn, and motionless. Paul covered his face with his hands, and sank down upon the cushioned window-sill.|$|R
60|$|The man chuckled {{softly and}} went out, and Benicia {{standing}} in the shadow felt her heart beat as she watched him slip across the patio. There would probably be complications if the officer saw him from above. Nobody, however, appeared among the pillars, and the shadowy arch that led through the building was not far away. The negro's feet fell softly on the hot stones, and though the slight patter sounded horribly distinct to her nobody called out to stop him. He had almost reached the arch when a uniformed figure appeared {{between two of the}} pillars, and for a moment the girl held her breath. If the man moved another foot it was evident that he must see the messenger, but, as it happened, he stood where he was, and next moment Pacheco, who turned and looked back at her with a grin, slipped into the <b>shadow</b> of the <b>arch.</b> Then Benicia went back into the house a little quiver of relief running through her. It would, she knew, be possible to obtain other messengers, but none of them were so well acquainted with the native paths which traverse the littoral or so speedy as Pacheco, and she did not think he would be available until the evening.|$|R
40|$|From 1965 to 1974, 849 {{children}} with congenital dislocation {{of the hip}} (CDH) or congenital subdislocation of the hip (CSdH) were treated in our department, and primary reduction was achieved by conservative treatment in 685 cases. Seventy-five of them which had an unsatisfactory course as revealed by plain roentgenograms underwent arthrographic examinations {{under the age of}} 5 years. In the present study, 58 of them (69 hips) were evaluated around the age of 10 according to the system of Severin. The arthrographic findings were retrospectively analyzed to see if the arthrogram is of value in making prognoses. The results indicated that children showing an α angle greater than 28. 0 degrees or a negative CE angle in plain roentgenograms require further arthrographic examination of the hip joint. Additional operations were thought to be necessary from treatment of cases in which arthrography revealed an α angle greater than 30 degrees or an α' angle greater than 11. 6 degrees or interposition. The interposition disturbing the concentric reduction of the joint was demonstrated arthrographically as an <b>arched</b> <b>shadow</b> which continued from the "limbus" {{to the center of the}} cartilaginous acetabulum. Factors that indicate the probability of poor results according to Severin's evaluation are the presence of interposition and/or an abnormally thickened cartilaginous acetabulum: greater than 3. 0 mm at the Y cartilage, greater than 3. 2 mm at the pubic and ischial bones, or greater than 5. 2 mm at the iliac bone...|$|R
60|$|He {{helped her}} back into the corridor; Roderick {{followed}} after a short interval. Of course, as they were descending the steps, came questions for Rowland to answer, and more or less surprise. Where had he come from? how happened he to have appeared at just that moment? Rowland answered that he had been rambling overhead, and that, looking out of an aperture, he had seen a gentleman preparing to undertake a preposterous gymnastic feat, and a lady swooning away in consequence. Interference seemed justifiable, and he had made it as prompt as possible. Roderick was far from hanging his head, like a man who has been caught in the perpetration of an extravagant folly; but if he held it more erect than usual Rowland believed that this was much less because he had made a show of personal daring than because he had triumphantly proved to Christina that, like a certain person she had dreamed of, he too could speak the language of decision. Christina descended to the arena in silence, apparently occupied with her own thoughts. She betrayed no sense of the privacy of her interview with Roderick needing an explanation. Rowland had seen stranger things in New York! The only evidence of her recent agitation was that, on being joined by her maid, she declared that she was unable to walk home; she must have a carriage. A fiacre was found resting in the <b>shadow</b> of the <b>Arch</b> of Constantine, and Rowland suspected that after she had got into it she disburdened herself, under her veil, of a few natural tears.|$|R
60|$|Subordinated to {{this first}} system of curves there is another, begun {{by the small}} {{crossing}} bar of wood inserted in the angle behind the rudder; continued by {{the bottom of the}} bank on which the figure sits, interrupted forcibly beyond it,[255] but taken up again by the water-line leading to the bridge foot, and passing on in delicate <b>shadows</b> under the <b>arches,</b> not easily shown in so rude a diagram, towards the other extremity of the bridge. This is a most important curve, indicating that the force and sweep of the river have indeed been in old times under the large arches; while the antiquity of the bridge is told us by the long tongue of land, either of carted rubbish, or washed down by some minor stream, which has interrupted this curve, and is now used as a landing-place for the boats, and for embarkation of merchandise, of which some bales and bundles are laid in a heap, immediately beneath the great tower. A common composer would have put these bales to one side or the other, but Turner knows better; he uses them as a foundation for his tower, adding to its importance precisely as the sculptured base adorns a pillar; and he farther increases the aspect of its height by throwing the reflection of it far down in the nearer water. All the great composers have this same feeling about sustaining their vertical masses: you will constantly find Prout using the artifice most dexterously (see, for instance, the figure with the wheelbarrow under the great tower, in the sketch of St. Nicolas, at Prague, and the white group of figures under the tower in the sketch of Augsburg[256]); and Veronese, Titian, and Tintoret continually put their principal figures at bases of pillars. Turner found out their secret very early, the most prominent instance of his composition on this principle being the drawing of Turin from the Superga, in Hakewell's Italy.|$|R
6000|$|Then note farther their perfectness. The {{impression}} on most people's minds {{must have been}} received more from pictures than reality, so far as I can judge, so ragged they think the pine; whereas its chief character in health is green and full roundness. It stands compact, like {{one of its own}} cones, slightly curved on its sides, finished and quaint as a carved tree in some Elizabethan garden; and instead of being wild in expression, forms the softest of all forest scenery, for other trees show their trunks and twisting boughs; but the pine, growing either in luxuriant mass, or in happy isolation, allows no branch to be seen. Summit behind summit rise its pyramidal ranges, or down to the very grass sweep the circlets of its boughs; so that there is nothing but green cone, and green carpet. Nor is it only softer, but in one sense more cheerful than other foliage, for it casts only a pyramidal <b>shadow.</b> Lowland forest <b>arches</b> overhead, and chequers the ground with darkness; but the pine, growing in scattered groups, leaves the glades between emerald-bright. Its gloom is all its own; narrowing into the sky, it lets the sunshine strike down to the dew. And if ever a superstitious feeling comes over me among the pine glades, it is never tainted with the old German forest fear, but it is only a more solemn tone of the fairy enchantment that haunts our English meadows; so that I have always called the prettiest pine-glade in Chamouni, [...] "Fairies' Hollow." [...] It is in the glen beneath the steep ascent above Pont Pelissier, and may be reached by a little winding path which goes down {{from the top of the}} hill[27]--being indeed not truly a glen, but a broad ledge of moss and turf, leaning in a formidable precipice (which, however, the gentle branches hide) over the Arve. An almost isolated rock promontory, many coloured, rises at the end of it. On the other sides it is bordered by cliffs, from which a little cascade falls, literally, down among the pines, for it is so light, shaking itself into mere showers of seed pearl in the sun, that the pines don't know it from mist, and grow through it without minding. Underneath, there is only the mossy silence; and above, for ever, the snow of the nameless Aiguille.|$|R
6000|$|... "Colonel," [...] said Father Brown, [...] "I {{tell you}} that this {{archangel}} of impudence who stole your forks walked up and down this passage twenty times in the blaze of all the lamps, in the glare of all the eyes. He did not go and hide in dim corners where suspicion might have searched for him. He kept constantly on the move in the lighted corridors, and everywhere that he went he seemed to be there by right. Don't ask me what he was like; you have seen him yourself six or seven times tonight. You were waiting with all the other grand people in the reception room {{at the end of the}} passage there, with the terrace just beyond. Whenever he came among you gentlemen, he came in the lightning style of a waiter, with bent head, flapping napkin and flying feet. He shot out on to the terrace, did something to the table cloth, and shot back again towards the office and the waiters' quarters. By the time he had come under the eye of the office clerk and the waiters he had become another man in every inch of his body, in every instinctive gesture. He strolled among the servants with the absent-minded insolence which they have all seen in their patrons. It was no new thing to them that a swell from the dinner party should pace all parts of the house like an animal at the Zoo; they know that nothing marks the Smart Set more than a habit of walking where one chooses. When he was magnificently weary of walking down that particular passage he would wheel round and pace back past the office; in the <b>shadow</b> of the <b>arch</b> just beyond he was altered as by a blast of magic, and went hurrying forward again among the Twelve Fishermen, an obsequious attendant. Why should the gentlemen look at a chance waiter? Why should the waiters suspect a first-rate walking gentleman? Once or twice he played the coolest tricks. In the proprietor's private quarters he called out breezily for a syphon of soda water, saying he was thirsty. He said genially that he would carry it himself, and he did; he carried it quickly and correctly through the thick of you, a waiter with an obvious errand. Of course, it could not have been kept up long, but it only had to be kept up till the end of the fish course.|$|R
60|$|Passing the Swanzy establishment, a model board-house, with masonry posts, a {{verandah}} all round, and {{a flying}} roof of corrugated iron, we ascend the old paved ramp. Here we remark that the castle-gateway of the Dutch, {{leading to the}} outer or slave court, {{has been replaced by}} a mean hole in the wall. The external work was demolished, lest the enemy effect a lodgement there. We can walk seawards round the green knob scattered with black boulders, and pick an excellent salad, a kind of African dandelion, which the carnivorous English miners called 'grass,'--with a big, big D. Entering the hole in the wall, and passing through a solid arched gateway and across a small court upon which the prison opens, we ascend the steps leading to the upper work. This is a large square house, pierced in front for one door and three windows, and connected by a bridge, formerly a drawbridge, with the two tall belvideres, once towers guarding the eastern entrance. The body is occupied by the palaver-hall of the opper koopman (chief factor), now converted into a court-house and a small armoury of sniders. It leads to the bedrooms, disposed on three sides. The materials are trap, quartz, probably gold-bearing, and fine bricks, evidently home-made. The substantial quarters fronting the sea are breezy, comfortable, and healthy; and the large cistern contains the only good drinking-water in Axim. Life must be somewhat dull here, but, after all, not so bad as in many an out-station of British India. The chief grievance is that the inmates, the District-commissioner and his medico, are mere birds of passage; they are ordered off and exchanged, at the will of head-quarters, often before they can settle down, and always before they learn to take interest in the place. The works consist of two bastions on the land side; a large one to the south-east, and a smaller to the north-east. Seawards projects a rounded cavalier, fronted by dead ground, or rather water. In the days of the Dutch the platforms carried '22 iron guns, besides some patteraroes.' Now there are two old bronze guns, two 'chambeis' bearing the mark 'La Hague,' and an ancient iron tube dismounted: a seven-pounder mountain-gun, of a type now obsolete, lurks in the <b>shadows</b> of the <b>arched</b> gateway. I afterwards had an opportunity of seeing the ammunition, and was much struck by a tub of black mud, which they told me was gunpowder. The Ashantis at least keep theirs dry.|$|R
6000|$|... 220. Subordinated to {{this first}} system of curves there is another, begun {{by the small}} {{crossing}} bar of wood inserted in the angle behind the rudder; continued by {{the bottom of the}} bank on which the figure sits, interrupted forcibly beyond it,[64] but taken up again by the water-line leading to the bridge foot, and passing on in delicate <b>shadows</b> under the <b>arches,</b> not easily shown in so rude a diagram, towards the other extremity of the bridge. This is a most important curve, indicating that the force and sweep of the river have indeed been in old times under the large arches; while the antiquity of the bridge is told us by a long tongue of land, either of carted rubbish, or washed down by some minor stream, which has interrupted this curve, and is now used as a landing-place for the boats, and for embarkation of merchandise, of which some bales and bundles are laid in a heap, immediately beneath the great tower.

Turner found out their secret very early, the most prominent instance of his composition on this principle being the drawing of Turin from the Superga, in Hakewell's Italy. I chose Fig. 20, already given to illustrate foliage drawing, chiefly because, being another instance of precisely the same arrangement, it will serve to convince you of its being intentional. There, the vertical, formed by the larger tree, is continued by the figure of the farmer, and that of one of the smaller trees by his stick. The lines of the interior mass of the bushes radiate, under the law of radiation, from a point behind the farmer's head; but their outline curves are carried on and repeated, under the law of continuity, by the curves of the dog and boy--by the way, note the remarkable instance in these of the use of darkest lines towards the light--all more or less guiding the eye up to the right, in order to bring it finally to the Keep of Windsor, which is the central object of the picture, as the bridge tower is in the Coblentz. The wall on which the boy climbs answers the purpose of contrasting, both in direction and character, with these greater curves; thus corresponding as nearly as possible to the minor tongue of land in the Coblentz. This, however, introduces us to another law, which we must consider separately.|$|R
