5|$|Biofuels have {{a limited}} ability to replace fossil fuels {{and should not be}} {{regarded}} as a ‘silver bullet’ to deal with transport emissions. Biofuels on their own cannot deliver a <b>sustainable</b> <b>transport</b> system and so must be developed as part of an integrated approach, which promotes other renewable energy options and energy efficiency, as well as reducing the overall energy demand and need for transport. Consideration needs to be given to the development of hybrid and fuel cell vehicles, public transport, and better town and rural planning.|$|E
5|$|Biofuels have {{a limited}} ability to replace fossil fuels {{and should not be}} {{regarded}} as a ‘silver bullet’ to deal with transport emissions. However, they offer the prospect of increased market competition and oil price moderation. A healthy supply of alternative energy sources will help to combat gasoline price spikes and reduce dependency on fossil fuels, especially in the transport sector. Using transportation fuels more efficiently is also an integral part of a <b>sustainable</b> <b>transport</b> strategy.|$|E

5|$|Since the {{congestion}} charge introduction in 2003, over £1.2 billion has been invested in transport through December 2013, including £960 million on {{improvements to the}} bus network; £102 million on roads and bridges; £70 million on road safety; £51 million on local transport/borough plans; and £36 million on <b>sustainable</b> <b>transport</b> and the environment. There has been criticism because during the first ten years since the scheme was implemented, gross revenue reached about £2.6 billion, but only £1.2 billion has been invested, meaning that 54% of gross revenues have been spent in operating the system and administrative expenses.|$|E
5|$|Other approaches, {{loosely based}} around New Urbanism, are {{successfully}} reducing environmental impacts by altering {{the built environment}} to create and preserve sustainable cities which support <b>sustainable</b> <b>transport.</b> Residents in compact urban neighborhoods drive fewer miles, and have significantly lower environmental impacts {{across a range of}} measures, compared with those living in sprawling suburbs. In sustainable architecture the recent movement of New Classical Architecture promotes a sustainable approach towards construction, that appreciates and develops smart growth, architectural tradition and classical design. This in contrast to modernist and globally uniform architecture, as well as opposing solitary housing estates and suburban sprawl. Both trends started in the 1980s. The concept of Circular flow land use management has also been introduced in Europe to promote sustainable land use patterns that strive for compact cities and a reduction of greenfield land take by urban sprawl.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to assess whether {{intermodal}} road-rail transport has the potential to contribute to the sustainable development of the freight transport sector. To achieve this, the paper aims to clarify what <b>sustainable</b> freight <b>transport</b> is and to identify the critical issues in today’s intermodal transport system. Methodology: In a deductive approach principles for <b>sustainable</b> freight <b>transport</b> are developed based on sustainable development concepts and applied on intermodal transport. Findings: Rail has the potential to offer economically and environmentally <b>sustainable</b> freight <b>transport</b> services, but in the present intermodal transport system the economic benefits can only be realised for a minor share of the transport market, and the environmental benefits on a global and regional level are achieved at the expense of higher local impacts. Implications: This article has developed principles of <b>sustainable</b> freight <b>transport</b> and identified the critical issues regarding the sustainability potential of intermodal transport. Further research on implementing innovations in rail transport and on pre- and post haulage in urban areas is needed. What is original/value of paper: This paper presents a holistic definition of <b>sustainable</b> freight <b>transport</b> based on <b>sustainable</b> development principles. The definition is intended to be useful for analysing other transport systems...|$|R
40|$|Purpose of this paper: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{contribute}} to the development of a strategic framework for <b>sustainable</b> urban freight <b>transport</b> that provides an understanding of the constitutional principles underpinning the functioning of urban freight transport and by this ensures relevant aspects of sustainability are not missed in designing <b>sustainable</b> urban freight <b>transport</b> strategies. Design/methodology/approach: In a deductive approach a descriptive model for <b>sustainable</b> freight <b>transport</b> is developed, which is based on the Framework for Strategic Sustainable Development (FSSD) Findings: The descriptive model shows the relations between the urban stakeholders and how an integrated planning contributes to a reduced environmental impact, better transport network effectiveness and logistics performance. Research implications The descriptive model can be a reference point for future theory development and empirical research on <b>sustainable</b> urban freight <b>transport.</b> Practical implications: The descriptive model can help authorities to better understand the nature of freight movements and their impacts, and by this facilitates the coordination of individual actions strengthening the effectiveness of <b>sustainable</b> freight <b>transport</b> strategies. What is original/value of paper: The definition of <b>sustainable</b> freight <b>transport</b> based on principles contributes to a more holistic understanding of sustainable development, which is still mostly one-dimensional focusing only on the environmental dimension...|$|R
