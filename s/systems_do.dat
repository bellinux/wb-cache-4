5|$|Erosion acting upon {{different}} types of uplift-created joint and fracture systems is responsible for creating the valleys, canyons, domes, and other features we see today. These joints and fracture <b>systems</b> <b>do</b> not move, and are therefore not faults. Spacing between joints {{is controlled by the}} amount of silica in the granite and granodiorite rocks; more silica tends to create a more resistant rock, resulting in larger spaces between joints and fractures.|$|E
5|$|Metro relies {{extensively}} on passenger fares and appropriated financing from the Maryland, Virginia, and Washington D.C. governments, which are represented on Metro's board of directors. The {{system does not}} have a dedicated revenue stream as other cities' mass transit <b>systems</b> <b>do.</b> Critics allege that this has contributed to Metro's recent history of maintenance and safety problems.|$|E

5|$|Development for {{multiple}} platforms is profitable, but difficult. Optimizations needed for one platform architecture {{do not necessarily}} translate to others. Individual platforms such as the Sega Genesis and PlayStation 3 are seen as difficult to develop for compared to their competitors, and developers are not yet fully accustomed to new technologies such as multi-core processors and hyper-threading. Multi-platform releases are increasingly common, but not all differences between editions on multiple platforms can be fully explained by hardware alone, and there remain franchise stalwarts that exist solely on one system. Developers for new platforms such as handheld and mobile <b>systems</b> <b>do</b> not have to operate {{under the pressure of}} $20 million budgets and the scrutiny of publishers' marketing experts.|$|E
5|$|In 1975, Stephen Hawking {{published}} a calculation which suggested that black holes {{are not completely}} black but emit a dim radiation due to quantum effects near the event horizon. This work extended previous results of Jacob Bekenstein who had suggested that black holes have a well defined entropy. At first, Hawking's result appeared to contradict {{one of the main}} postulates of quantum mechanics, namely the unitarity of time evolution. Intuitively, the unitarity postulate says that quantum mechanical <b>systems</b> <b>do</b> not destroy information as they evolve from one state to another. For this reason, the apparent contradiction {{came to be known as}} the black hole information paradox.|$|E
5|$|In DragonFly, each CPU {{has its own}} thread scheduler. Upon creation, threads are {{assigned}} to processors and are never preemptively switched from one processor to another; they are only migrated by the passing of an inter-processor interrupt (IPI) message between the CPUs involved. Inter-processor thread scheduling is also accomplished by sending asynchronous IPI messages. One advantage to this clean compartmentalization of the threading subsystem is that the processors' on-board caches in Symmetric Multiprocessor <b>Systems</b> <b>do</b> not contain duplicated data, allowing for higher performance by giving each processor in the system {{the ability to use}} its own cache to store different things to work on.|$|E

5|$|The {{dominant}} {{classification system}} {{is called the}} Linnaean taxonomy. It includes ranks and binomial nomenclature. How organisms are named is governed by international agreements such as the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (ICN), the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN), and the International Code of Nomenclature of Bacteria (ICNB). The classification of viruses, viroids, prions, and all other sub-viral agents that demonstrate biological characteristics is conducted by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) and {{is known as the}} International Code of Viral Classification and Nomenclature (ICVCN). However, several other viral classification <b>systems</b> <b>do</b> exist.|$|E
5|$|Computer systems {{make use}} of caches—small and fast {{memories}} located close to the processor which store temporary copies of memory values (nearby in both the physical and logical sense). Parallel computer systems have difficulties with caches that may store the same value {{in more than one}} location, with the possibility of incorrect program execution. These computers require a cache coherency system, which keeps track of cached values and strategically purges them, thus ensuring correct program execution. Bus snooping {{is one of the most}} common methods for keeping track of which values are being accessed (and thus should be purged). Designing large, high-performance cache coherence systems is a very difficult problem in computer architecture. As a result, shared memory computer architectures do not scale as well as distributed memory <b>systems</b> <b>do.</b>|$|E

25|$|Failure is {{not simply}} defined as when a part breaks, however; it is defined as when a part does not operate as intended.
