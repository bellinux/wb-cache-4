The stable building is sited in the south-eastern corner of the square shaped yards. It is rectangular in plan, with the long sides running parallel to the roadway.

50|$|The {{introduction}} of fodder {{and the growing}} of cider apples in specific German regions date back to Mayer's ideas. For better use of land Mayer suggested the farmers to plant fallow land with clover.

50|$|Agriculture and its related {{businesses}} {{continue to}} be the major economic activity in the Western Interlake. The relatively low land prices, the ability of this land to produce high quality forage crops, the abundance of clean water, and the <b>stable</b> <b>cattle</b> prices have combined to make this area one of the best beef producing areas in the country. The major products produced in this region are agricultural products, specifically grain, hay, forage seed, livestock and PMU (Pregnant Mares Urine). The production of cattle is perhaps the most important agricultural sector in the Western Interlake. Cattle farmers in the R. M. of Eriksdale Agriculture District (the Agriculture District includes Eriksdale, Coldwell and St. Laurent) area managing approximately 44,917 cattle in 2001 of which 15,781 were beef and dairy cows. The majority of cattle produced locally are feeder cattle and are purchased by feedlots in Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta, Ontario and the United States. Veterinary clinics are located in Lundar and Ashern, providing services for small and large animals. The R. M. of Eriksdale reported $7,282,337 in Farm Cash Receipts in 2000.|$|R
40|$|Macrophages and {{dendritic}} {{cells are}} recognized as {{key players in the}} defense against mycobacterial infection. Recent research has confirmed that alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) also play important roles against mycobacterium infections. Thus, establishing a <b>stable</b> <b>cattle</b> AEC line for future endogenous immune research on bacterial invasion is necessary. In the present study, we first purified and immortalized type II AECs (AEC II cells) by transfecting them with a plasmid containing the human telomerase reverse trancriptase gene. We then tested whether or not the immortalized cells retained the basic physiological properties of primary AECs by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and Western blot. Finally, we tested the secretion capacity of immortalized AEC II cells upon stimulation by bacterial invasion. The cattle type II alveolar epithelial cell line (HTERT-AEC II) that we established retained lung epithelial cell characteristics: the cells were positive for surfactants A and B, and they secreted tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin- 6 in response to bacterial invasion. Thus, the cell line we established is a potential tool for research on the relationship between AECs and Mycobacterium tuberculosis...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of this}} diploma thesis the {{evaluation}} of the economic situation of a rather small farm of the Bukovjanovi family in Pročevili, near the town of Březnice. The mentioned main aim is to be reached with the use of financial analysis, which ought to provide an adequate perspective of the economic well-being of the farm itself. The financial analysis is performed through the use of basic methods of financial analysis based on the information obtained from the farm's tax records. These methods include vertical and horizontal analysis, analysis of the relational indexes - profitability, liquidity activity and debt. The analysis regarding financial specialization takes into account ten fiscal periods, specifically from year 2005 until 2014. Furthermore, the analytical part includes specifications of backflow from a new barn intended for <b>stabling</b> <b>cattle</b> using selected methods of evaluating investments. In addition to the previously mentioned description, the analytical part also contains prognosis of the farm's economic development {{for the next three years}} - 2015, 2016 and 2017. All results of the analysis conducted with the aim of evaluating the financial situation of the company, both in a retrospective and prospective manner, are presented in the chapter summary of results.

40|$|East Coast Fever (ECF) is {{the most}} {{economically}} important production disease among traditional beef cattle farmers in Zambia. Despite the disease control efforts by the government, donors, and farmers, ECF cases are increasing. Why does ECF oscillate over time? Can alternative approaches such as systems thinking contribute solutions to the complex ECF problem, avoid unintended consequences, and achieve sustainable results? To answer these research questions and inform the design and implementation of ECF interventions, we qualitatively investigated the influence of dynamic socio-economic, cultural, and ecological factors. We used system dynamics modelling to specify these dynamics qualitatively, and an innovative participatory framework called spatial group model building (SGMB). SGMB uses participatory geographical information system (GIS) concepts and techniques to capture the role of spatial phenomenon {{in the context of}} complex systems, allowing stakeholders to identify spatial phenomenon directly on physical maps and integrate such information in model development. Our SGMB process convened focus groups of beef value chain stakeholders in two distinct production systems. The focus groups helped to jointly construct a series of interrelated system dynamics models that described ECF in a broader systems context. Thus, a complementary objective {{of this study was to}} demonstrate the applicability of system dynamics modelling and SGMB in animal health. The SGMB process revealed policy leverage points in the beef cattle value chain that could be targeted to improve ECF control. For example, policies that develop sustainable and <b>stable</b> <b>cattle</b> markets and improve household income availability may have positive feedback effects on investment in animal health. The results obtained from a SGMB process also demonstrated that a "one-size-fits-all" approach may not be equally effective in policing ECF in different agro-ecological zones due to the complex interactions of socio-ecological context with important, and often ignored, spatial patterns...|$|R

The very last chapters are focused on <b>cattle</b> <b>stabling</b> including different kinds of litters.

The experiment has been realized in agriculture plant GenAgro Říčany a. s. and took place in period from July to September.

After evaluation of all materials was ascertained the most enormous representation of dipterious insect is house fly (Musca domestica) and stable fly (Stomoxys calcitrans). Further was observed presence of maggots and pupas in litters of each section. Results point out even though were in this environment grown individuals, the presence of maggots and pupas was imperceptible and predominately in production stables and birth hutches witch separated slurry or straw. Contrary to expectations in individual outdoor stalls of calves the presence of maggot and pupas in litter was significant only because of adding new litter (in this type of stabling the litter is unchanged) and higher heating, which is beneficial to evolution of insect...|$|R
