5|$|A {{hospital}} {{had originally been}} installed at Alcatraz during its time as a military prison in the late 19th century. During its time as a federal penitentiary, it was located above the dining hall on the second floor. Hospital staff were U.S. Public Health Service employees assigned to the Federal Prison Service at Alcatraz. Doctors often lasted fewer than several days or months at Alcatraz, because few of them could tolerate the violent inmates who would often terrify them if they failed to be given certain drugs. Prisoners in ill health were often kept in the hospital, most famously, Stroud and Al Capone, who <b>spent</b> <b>years</b> <b>in</b> it.|$|E

Go Sangnyeol (고상렬), the administrator of CHA between 1961 and 1968 set out to search for intangible cultural properties {{on the basis of a}} series of articles written by Yae Yonghae (예용해) for Hankook Ilbo, as the reporter <b>spent</b> <b>years</b> <b>in</b> exploring the country and interviewing old masters of handicraft. The first items to be inscribed on the intangible heritage list were thus taken from Yae's articles. Others were added based on the opinions of researchers and also included winners of the annual folk tradition competitions. The recommendation of local administrations was also sought.|$|E
5|$|Robert Catesby was {{the third}} and only {{surviving}} son of Sir William and Anne (née Throckmorton) Catesby, and was probably born in or after 1572 at his father's main residence in Lapworth. Robert was a lineal descendant of Sir William Catesby (1450–1485), the influential councillor of Richard III captured at the Battle of Bosworth and executed. On his mother's side he was descended from Sir Robert Throckmorton of Coughton, and his second wife, Elizabeth Hussey. His parents were prominent recusant Catholics; his father had suffered years of imprisonment for his faith, and in 1581 had been tried in Star Chamber alongside William Vaux, 3rd Baron Vaux of Harrowden, and his brother-in-law Sir Thomas Tresham, for harbouring the Jesuit Edmund Campion. The head of the Throckmortons, Sir Thomas Throckmorton, was also fined for his recusancy, and <b>spent</b> <b>years</b> <b>in</b> prison. Another relation, Sir Francis Throckmorton, had been executed in 1584 for his involvement in a plot to free Mary, Queen of Scots.|$|E

From here, the expedition that failed to find El Dorado returned to Cali, formerly founded by De Belalcázar.

25|$|Artistic ability {{was defined}} as a {{combination}} of shitsuga (質画) and gakuga (学画): innate and learned painting skill. Pupils entered workshops as children, based not primarily on talent, but on status. Some studios strictly policed students’ leisure activities, such as drinking and socializing, which was facilitated by the fact that pupils traditionally lived-in as uchi deshi. Study was a serious, time-consuming endeavor: “the successful student <b>spent</b> <b>years</b> <b>in</b> training, a time during which he developed physical stamina, self-discipline, perseverance, the ability to earn for himself, facility in technical skills, and a good understanding of the aesthetics and spiritual considerations required of a dedicated painter.” Most studied for over ten years before being allowed to graduate, if they were allowed to graduate. Apprenticeship began with menial tasks and “unobtrusive observation.” As pupils worked their way up to the rank of head students (deshi gashira), their relationship to their mentors was comparable to that of retainer to lord. Though seniors were usually referred to as sensei (teacher), some pupils addressed their instructors as tonosama, an honorific title for a feudal lord.|$|E
25|$|Jagannathan {{was born}} Devendra Kula Vellalar family in 1926. Her first {{encounter}} with social injustice and poverty was by looking at her mother Nagammal who had to toil very hard and had to work {{even when she was}} in advanced stage of pregnancy. Despite being from a poor family she managed university education and was soon involved with the Gandhian Sarvodaya Movement. It was through Sarvodaya that she Sankaralingam, who was much later to be her husband. Sankaralingam hailed from a wealthy family, yet gave up his college studies in 1930 in response to Gandhi's call for non-co-operation movement and civil disobedience. At one stage Krishnammal even shared a stage with Gandhi and also met Martin Luther King. Sankaralinga later joined the Quit India Movement in 1942 and <b>spent</b> <b>years</b> <b>in</b> jail before India gained its independence in 1947. Having decided only to marry in independent India Sankaralingam and Krishnammal married in 1950.

500|$|Keating {{asked that}} Lincoln {{be given a}} lenient {{judgment}} by the FHLBB, so it could limit its high risk investments {{and get into the}} relatively safe home mortgage business, allowing the business to survive. A letter from audit firm Arthur Young & Co. bolstered Keating's case that the government investigation was taking a long time. McCain initially refused to meet with Keating over the FHLBB matter and Keating called McCain a [...] "wimp" [...] behind his back. The two had a heated, contentious meeting in which McCain said he had not <b>spent</b> <b>years</b> <b>in</b> North Vietnamese prisoner-of-war camps to have his courage or integrity questioned; the friendship ended and they would not speak again. In April 1987, the group of senators met twice with FHLBB members who were investigating American Continental Corporation and Lincoln, in an attempt to end the investigation. Meanwhile, Keating filed a lawsuit against the FHLBB, saying it had leaked confidential information about Lincoln. The outgoing head of the FHLBB in Washington deferred judgment and the new head was more sympathetic to Keating. In May 1988, the FHLBB agreed to an unprecedented memorandum of understanding giving Lincoln a clean slate and forgiveness for any violations up to that point. (In 1991, the senators would be rebuked to various degrees by the Senate Ethics Committee, with Cranston receiving the harshest verdict and Glenn and McCain the least. McCain later testified against Keating in a civil lawsuit brought by Lincoln bondholders, while the other four refused to testify.) ...|$|E
500|$|It was {{not easy}} for the HBC to drive the Americans away from the North West Coast. The Americans had decades of {{experience}} and knew the coast's complex physical and human geography. It took until 1835 for the HBC to gain this level of experience, but the Americans still had several advantages. For {{a number of reasons}} they were willing and able to pay high prices for furs—much higher than the HBC could match without taking large financial losses. The American ventures were global in scope. They tapped multiple markets of which the North West Coast was but one. By the 1820s American ships routinely <b>spent</b> <b>years</b> <b>in</b> the Pacific, making several voyages between various places such as California, Hawaii, the Philippines, and Canton. American ships were usually stocked with a surplus of trade goods intended for trade on the North West Coast. It was always best to get rid of any extra trade goods on the North West Coast, [...] "dumping" [...] them at any price, before leaving. They would use up stowage space that could be used more profitably elsewhere. The HBC therefore faced a major challenge even after they became experienced with the coast's geography and indigenous peoples. The American system not only raised the price of furs but also lowered the value of trade goods. Furthermore, the indigenous people knew that increased competition served their interests and gave them bargaining power. They had no desire to see the Americans abandon the coast trade. Therefore, the HBC had to not just match but exceed the prices paid by Americans if they hoped to drive the Americans away. Beaver fur prices on the coast could be many times what the HBC was paying in the interior. There was no hope of making a profit. In order to compete on the coast the HBC had to take large, long-term financial losses.|$|E
