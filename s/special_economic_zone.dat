British American Tobacco also has business in the country, but it has reduced its involvement due to political pressure and public relations reasons. During the Cold War, North Korea paid for goods it imported from the Soviet Union with poor quality tobacco. Later, {{during the years of}} the Sunshine Policy, high-end Pyongyang brand cigarettes were exported to South Korea where they were popular among South Koreans who wanted to express a pro-reunification stance. There are some privately owned tobacco factories, some of which are known to produce counterfeit brand cigarettes for export as part of North Korea's illicit activities to earn hard currency.|$|E

40|$|<b>Special</b> <b>economic</b> <b>zones,</b> one of {{the most}} {{important}} instruments of industrial policy in developing countries, often feature export share requirements. That is, firms located in these zones are obliged to export more than a certain stated share of their output to enjoy the wide array of incentives available there, a practice prohibited by the World Trade Organization. This paper exploits the staggered removal of export requirements across products and over time in the <b>special</b> <b>economic</b> <b>zones</b> of the Dominican Republic to evaluate whether the importance of exports originating from the zones was affected by the elimination of export requirements. The findings show that entry increased among firms in <b>special</b> <b>economic</b> <b>zones,</b> while the average value of export transactions fell for existing exporters following the reforms. At the same time, continuous exporters were unaffected by the policy change, possibly because these firms were not constrained by the export requirement. Overall, <b>special</b> <b>economic</b> <b>zones</b> became more important with respect to the number of exporters based there but not in terms of the value of exports. The findings suggest that the elimination of performance requirements made it more attractive for firms to be based in <b>special</b> <b>economic</b> <b>zones...</b>|$|R

40|$|Journal of Comparative Economics, March 1998. We {{develop a}} theory for a {{transition}} economy under which an unbalanced development strategy that favors <b>special</b> <b>economic</b> <b>zones</b> {{emerges as a}} response to two critical problems: (1) political pressure to satisfy certain social expenditure requirements, and (2) the lack of institutions to constrain the state from expropriation. By promoting the concentration of resources in some areas, a low equilibrium trap can be avoided, while important spillover effects may be generated elsewhere. The experience of China with <b>special</b> <b>economic</b> <b>zones</b> and coastal open areas is interpreted in this light. Some problems in the Russian economy are also discussed {{in the context of this}} theory.

40|$|In {{the past}} 30 years, China has {{achieved}} phenomenal economic growth, an unprecedented development"miracle"in human history. How did China achieve this rapid growth? What have been its key drivers? And, most important, {{what can be}} learned from China's success? Policy makers, business people, and scholars all over the world continue to debate these topics, but one thing is clear: the numerous <b>special</b> <b>economic</b> <b>zones</b> and industrial clusters that emerged after the country's reforms are without doubt two important engines of China's remarkable development. The <b>special</b> <b>economic</b> <b>zones</b> and industrial clusters have made crucial contributions to China's economic success. Foremost, the <b>special</b> <b>economic</b> <b>zones</b> (especially the first several) successfully tested the market economy and new institutions and became role models {{for the rest of the}} country to follow. Together with the numerous industrial clusters, the <b>special</b> <b>economic</b> <b>zones</b> have contributed significantly to gross domestic product, employment, exports, and attraction of foreign investment. The <b>special</b> <b>economic</b> <b>zones</b> have also played important roles in bringing new technologies to China and in adopting modern management practices. This study briefly summarizes the development experiences of China's <b>special</b> <b>economic</b> <b>zones</b> and industrial clusters (their formation, success factors, challenges, and possible areas or measures for policy intervention), based on case studies, interviews, field visits, and extensive reviews of the existing literature in an attempt to benefit other developing countries as well as the broader development community.
