5|$|The war was one {{of several}} near {{simultaneous}} wars waged by the Mongol Empire and the Yuan dynasty in the late 13th century. Though it was never more than a minor frontier war to the Mongols, the war <b>set</b> <b>off</b> <b>a</b> series of enduring developments in Burma. The invasions ushered in a period of political fragmentation, and the rise of Tai-Shan states throughout mainland Southeast Asia.|$|E

5|$|Before dawn on 5 July, Pakistani troops <b>set</b> <b>off</b> <b>a</b> {{series of}} explosions around the mosque. Gunfire was {{exchanged}} throughout the day, but open clashes apparently stopped. Deadline extensions continued on 5 July, {{with the government}} planning to evacuate the mosque and Jamia Hafsa before the final assault. Interior Minister Aftab Ahmad Sherpao announced {{at a press conference}} that the government believed that between 300 and 400 students remained in the mosque, and only 50 to 60 were considered to be militants.|$|E

5|$|Most of the population, {{urban and}} rural, took out their anger and frustrations on the nation's Vietnamese population. Lon Nol's call for 10,000 volunteers {{to boost the}} {{manpower}} of Cambodia's poorly equipped, 30,000-man army, managed to swamp the military with over 70,000 recruits. Rumours abounded concerning a possible PAVN offensive aimed at Phnom Penh itself.

5|$|Thereafter, Reubens {{decided to}} take a sabbatical from Pee-wee. In July 1991, Reubens was arrested for indecent {{exposure}} in an adult theater in Sarasota, Florida. The arrest <b>set</b> <b>off</b> <b>a</b> chain reaction of national media attention that changed the general public's view of Reubens and Pee-wee. The arrest postponed Reubens' involvement in major projects until 1999 when he appeared in several big-budget projects including Mystery Men and Blow and started giving interviews as himself rather than as Pee-wee.|$|E
5|$|Although Musique funèbre was internationally acclaimed, his new {{harmonic}} techniques led {{to something}} of a crisis for Lutosławski, during which he still could not see how to express his musical ideas. Then on 16 March 1960, listening to Polish Radio broadcast on new music, he happened to hear John Cage's Concert for Piano and Orchestra. Although he was not influenced by the sound or {{the philosophy of the}} music, Cage's explorations of indeterminacy <b>set</b> <b>off</b> <b>a</b> train of thought which resulted in Lutosławski finding a way to retain the harmonic structures he wanted while introducing the freedom for which he was searching. His Three Postludes were hastily rounded off (he had intended to write four) and he moved on to compose works in which he explored these new ideas.|$|E

5|$|Gay {{characters}} {{also were}} often killed {{off at the}} end, such as the death of Sandy Dennis' character {{at the end of}} The Fox in 1968. If not victims, lesbians were depicted as villains or morally corrupt, such as portrayals of brothel madames by Barbara Stanwyck in Walk on the Wild Side from 1962 and Shelley Winters in The Balcony in 1963. Lesbians as predators were presented in Rebecca (1940), women's prison films like Caged (1950), or in the character Rosa Klebb in From Russia with Love (1963). Lesbian vampire themes have reappeared in Dracula's Daughter (1936), Blood and Roses (1960), Vampyros Lesbos (1971), and The Hunger (1983). Basic Instinct (1992) featured a bisexual murderer played by Sharon Stone; it was one of several films that <b>set</b> <b>off</b> <b>a</b> storm of protests about the depiction of gays as predators.|$|E
5|$|In 1997 and 1998, the Bulls met the Utah Jazz in the Finals twice. Led by Olympians John Stockton and Karl Malone, the Jazz were {{defeated}} in both Finals by the Bulls in six games. In both series, Chicago won by hitting winning {{shots in the}} sixth and deciding game — the first by Steve Kerr in 1997 in Chicago, and the second by Jordan in Utah in 1998. This saw Chicago winning their sixth NBA championship, and managing their second three-peat. However, prior to the 1999 season, Jackson decided to retire, which <b>set</b> <b>off</b> <b>a</b> chain reaction that resulted {{in most of the}} team, including Jordan and Pippen, requesting to leave the Bulls. With no foundation of youth to build upon, the Bulls became a lottery-bound team for the next six seasons.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, 80 Taiwanese {{practitioners}} {{were blocked}} from entering Hong Kong, {{and again in}} 2007, hundreds more Taiwanese were blocked from entering Hong Kong or detained at the airport, These events <b>set</b> <b>off</b> <b>a</b> six-year human rights case that tested {{the integrity of the}} one country, two systems arrangement. In 2009, Falun Gong's case against the Hong Kong immigration department was dismissed. Months later, Hong Kong immigration officials denied visas to several members of the Falun Gong-affiliated Shen Yun dance company, which was scheduled to perform in the territory in January 2010. Democratic Party chairman Albert Ho said the denial of the visas was a worrying new erosion of Hong Kong's freedoms, and damaged the reputation of Hong Kong as a liberal and open society. A court ruling in March 2010 overturned the Immigration Department's decision.|$|E

5|$|In all, the Renaissance {{could be}} viewed as an attempt by intellectuals to study and improve the secular and worldly, both through the revival of ideas from antiquity, and through novel {{approaches}} to thought. Some scholars, such as Rodney Stark, play down the Renaissance in favor of the earlier innovations of the Italian city-states in the High Middle Ages, which married responsive government, Christianity and the birth of capitalism. This analysis argues that, whereas the great European states (France and Spain) were absolutist monarchies, and others were under direct Church control, the independent city republics of Italy took over the principles of capitalism invented on monastic estates and <b>set</b> <b>off</b> <b>a</b> vast unprecedented commercial revolution that preceded and financed the Renaissance.|$|E
5|$|Many Indian species {{descend from}} taxa {{originating}} in Gondwana, {{from which the}} Indian plate separated more than 105 million years before present. Peninsular India's subsequent movement towards and collision with the Laurasian landmass <b>set</b> <b>off</b> <b>a</b> mass exchange of species. Epochal volcanism and climatic changes 20 million years ago forced a mass extinction. Mammals then entered India from Asia through two zoogeographical passes flanking the rising Himalaya. Thus, while 45.8% of reptiles and 55.8% of amphibians are endemic, only 12.6% of mammals and 4.5% of birds are. Among them are the Nilgiri leaf monkey and Beddome's toad of the Western Ghats. India contains 172 IUCN-designated threatened animal species, or 2.9% of endangered forms. These include the Asiatic lion, the Bengal tiger, the snow leopard and the Indian white-rumped vulture, which, by ingesting the carrion of diclofenac-laced cattle, nearly became extinct.|$|E
5|$|New York, Boston, and Philadelphia {{did their}} best to outdo each other in the {{celebrations}} honoring Lafayette. Needing a place to hold a reception for him, Philadelphia renovated the Old State House (today Independence Hall), which might otherwise have been torn down. Until that point, it had not been usual in the United States to build monuments, but Lafayette's visit <b>set</b> <b>off</b> <b>a</b> wave of construction, usually with Lafayette, in his capacity as Mason, laying the cornerstone. The arts benefited by his visits as well, as many cities commissioned portraits for their civic buildings, and the likenesses were seen on innumerable souvenirs. Lafayette had intended to visit only the original thirteen states during a four-month visit; the stay stretched to sixteen months as he visited all twenty-four.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} al-Birwa's {{inhabitants}} {{participated in the}} 1936–1939 Arab revolt against British rule and mass Jewish immigration in Palestine. A commander of the revolt for the Nazareth-Tiberias region, Sheikh Yihya Hawash, was from al-Birwa. He was arrested by the British and sentenced to life imprisonment. The British also executed eight residents of al-Birwa {{who had participated in}} the revolt. Other rebel commanders and participants in the revolt from al-Birwa included Asad Atallah, Mahmoud al-Joudi, Saleh Mahmoud Me'ari-Abu Sa'ud, Abd al-Hamid Daher Me'ari, Muhammad al-Hajj Ali, Yusef Taha, Fadil Eid, Yousif Mai and Abbas al-Shattawi. A number of women from al-Birwa participated in the revolt by transporting arms, water and food to rebels positioned among the hills in the vicinity. Elderly refugees from al-Birwa interviewed in 2003–2004 recalled that during the revolt, local rebels <b>set</b> <b>off</b> <b>a</b> mine that hit a British military jeep on a road adjacent to al-Birwa in August 1937, prompting the British to launch punitive measures against the village. In particular, the British authorities gathered men from al-Birwa and forced them to cut cactus plants near Acre and then placed the men on top of the cactuses.|$|E
5|$|Kadaj confronts Rufus Shinra, who reveals he {{possesses}} the box containing Jenova's remains. He attempts to destroy it, but Kadaj manages {{to save it}} and flees the city with his companions. Yazoo and Loz are apparently destroyed along the way by an explosive planted by Shinra's agents. Cloud chases Kadaj down and engages him in battle, ultimately subduing him. Outmatched, Kadaj opens Jenova's box and fuses with its contents, transforming into Sephiroth. He then tells Cloud {{that he will be}} able to use the life essences of Geostigma sufferers to achieve complete domination over the planet. He and Cloud then fight, and throughout the whole encounter, Sephiroth appears to have the upper hand, flinging Cloud repeatedly into walls and finally impaling him through the shoulder. He asks Cloud to tell him what he most cherishes so that he can have the pleasure of taking it away. To this, Cloud replies that he cherishes everything, then pulls out Sephiroth's sword and deals him a hail of devastating blows. Sephiroth's spirit departs, leaving behind the mortally wounded Kadaj. As he lies dying in Cloud's arms, a healing rain starts falling across the land, curing the people of their Geostigma. Yazoo and Loz appear and confront Cloud; he charges at them, and they <b>set</b> <b>off</b> <b>a</b> massive explosion engulfing the three.|$|E
5|$|The Diocese of Miami {{was created}} on October 7, 1958, with Coleman Carroll {{installed}} as bishop. The diocese included the 16 southern counties in Florida, with a Catholic population of 200,000. It encompassed {{one half of}} the area of the state. Less than a year after the creation of the diocese, Fidel Castro came to power in Cuba. This <b>set</b> <b>off</b> <b>a</b> mass exodus of Cuban exiles to South Florida, increasing church membership in the region. The Catholic Welfare Bureau, created by Carroll, played a significant part in helping these waves of Cuban immigrants. Between 1960 and 1962, 14,000 Cuban children were sent to the United States. Operation Pedro Pan, created by Monsignor Bryan O. Walsh, placed them with friends, relatives or the Catholic Welfare Bureau. In 1996, the Catholic Welfare Bureau changed its name to Catholic Charities. Today it claims to be the largest non-governmental provider of social services in South Florida. It served over 17,000 families in the tri-county area of Broward, Dade and Monroe counties in 2006.|$|E

5|$|The fleet {{remained}} in captivity during the negotiations that ultimately produced the Treaty of Versailles. Von Reuter {{believed that the}} British intended to seize the German ships on 21 June 1919, which was the deadline for Germany to have signed the peace treaty. Unaware that the deadline had been extended to the 23rd, Reuter ordered the ships to be sunk at the next opportunity. On the morning of 21 June, the British fleet left Scapa Flow to conduct training maneuvers, and at 11:20 Reuter transmitted the order to his ships. The ship sank in two hours and fifteen minutes. The task of raising Von der Tann was secured by Ernest Cox's salvage company. During preparation work, three workers were nearly killed when their oxy-acetylene cutters <b>set</b> <b>off</b> <b>a</b> major explosion. The blast tore holes in the still submerged vessel and allowed water into the compartment that had been emptied with compressed air; {{by the time the}} men were rescued, the compartment had refilled almost completely and the men were up to their necks. Nevertheless, the ship was successfully brought up on 7 December 1930, and scrapped at Rosyth by the Alloa Shipbreaking Company between 1931 and 1934.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} two {{seasons in the}} European Cup were a disappointment for Celtic; going out to Dynamo Kyiv {{in the first round}} in their defence of the trophy in the autumn of 1967, then reaching the quarter-finals the following season only to lose their home leg against AC Milan, having achieved a credible no-scoring draw in the first game in Italy. Earlier in the season, Celtic <b>set</b> <b>off</b> <b>a</b> controversy {{in the wake of the}} Soviet Union's invasion of Czechoslovakia in August 1968. At chairman Robert Kelly's behest, the club sent UEFA a telegram condemning the military action and expressing concern that any team from Western Europe having to play a tie in an Eastern Bloc country. Celtic's stance received support from several clubs throughout Western Europe, although others such as Leeds United publicly criticised Celtic's intervention. In response, UEFA redid the draw for the first round of the European Cup and European Cup Winners' Cup to avoid pairing Eastern European sides with clubs from the West. This elicited a furious response from clubs and football authorities in the East, the majority of whom withdrew in protest.|$|E
5|$|Baugh invited some 100 {{players to}} the Titans' first {{training}} camp, which {{opened at the}} University of New Hampshire on July 9, 1960. As NFL teams cut players from their training camps, many were invited to the Titans' or other AFL training camps as the teams sought to fill their 35-man rosters. The franchise's first preseason game took place on August 6, 1960, against the Los Angeles Chargers at Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. The Titans kicked off to begin the game, and Chargers running back Paul Lowe returned the kick 105yards for a touchdown. New York lost, 27–7. On September 11, 1960, the opening regular season game was played in a heavy downpour, the remains of Hurricane Diana. Water poured off Coogan's Bluff, situated above the Polo Grounds, swamping the field, which had poor drainage. The Titans' offense was less affected by the mud {{than that of the}} visiting Buffalo Bills. The Titans won the game 27–3 before a crowd of 9,607 (5,727paid attendance). The following week New York played another home game, against the Boston Patriots. On the first of many occasions when the team would lose a game after taking a big lead, the Titans were ahead 24–7 in the second half. With the lead reduced to 24–21, the Titans punted from deep in their own territory with seconds left. The punter, Rick Sapienza, fumbled the snap, and the Patriots recovered in the end zone for the victory. The following week, with the Titans playing at the Denver Broncos, New York blocked a punt on the final play to win the game. In their fourth game, New York had a two-point lead when it fumbled with fifteen seconds left against the Dallas Texans. This <b>set</b> <b>off</b> <b>a</b> scramble for the ball, which the Titans recovered as time ran out. Viewers in New York were spared the harrowing ending; in a prelude to the Heidi Game eight years later, the local ABC station had switched to a Walt Disney Davey Crockett special at 6:30p.m. Many viewers called to complain.|$|E
