5|$|When {{interpreted}} as a proof within a first-order set theory, such as ZFC, Dedekind's categoricity proof for PA shows that each model of set theory has a unique model of the Peano axioms, up to isomorphism, that embeds as an initial segment of all other models of PA contained within that model of set theory. In the <b>standard</b> <b>model</b> of set theory, this smallest model of PA is the <b>standard</b> <b>model</b> of PA; however, in a nonstandard model of set theory, {{it may be a}} nonstandard model of PA. This situation cannot be avoided with any first-order formalization of set theory.|$|E
5|$|With modern {{insights}} into quantum mechanics and technology that can accelerate particles {{close to the}} speed of light, particle physics has devised a <b>Standard</b> <b>Model</b> to describe forces between particles smaller than atoms. The <b>Standard</b> <b>Model</b> predicts that exchanged particles called gauge bosons are the fundamental means by which forces are emitted and absorbed. Only four main interactions are known: in order of decreasing strength, they are: strong, electromagnetic, weak, and gravitational. High-energy particle physics observations made during the 1970s and 1980s confirmed that the weak and electromagnetic forces are expressions of a more fundamental electroweak interaction.|$|E

5|$|Observations, {{including}} the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE), Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP), and Planck {{maps of the}} CMB, suggest that the Universe is infinite in extent with a finite age, as described by the Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker (FLRW) models. These FLRW models thus support inflationary models and the <b>standard</b> <b>model</b> of cosmology, describing a flat, homogeneous universe presently dominated by dark matter and dark energy.|$|E
5|$|Outside {{of string}} theory, mirror {{symmetry}} {{is used to}} understand aspects of quantum field theory, the formalism that physicists use to describe elementary particles. For example, gauge theories are a class of highly symmetric physical theories appearing in the <b>standard</b> <b>model</b> of particle physics {{and other parts of}} theoretical physics. Some gauge theories which {{are not part of the}} <b>standard</b> <b>model,</b> but which are nevertheless important for theoretical reasons, arise from strings propagating on a nearly singular background. For such theories, mirror symmetry is a useful computational tool. Indeed, mirror symmetry can be used to perform calculations in an important gauge theory in four spacetime dimensions that was studied by Nathan Seiberg and Edward Witten and is also familiar in mathematics in the context of Donaldson invariants. There is also a generalization of mirror symmetry called 3D mirror symmetry which relates pairs of quantum field theories in three spacetime dimensions.|$|E

5|$|Quarks have various {{intrinsic}} properties, including electric charge, mass, color charge, and spin. Quarks are {{the only}} elementary particles in the <b>Standard</b> <b>Model</b> of particle physics to experience all four fundamental interactions, also known as fundamental forces (electromagnetism, gravitation, strong interaction, and weak interaction), {{as well as the}} only known particles whose electric charges are not integer multiples of the elementary charge.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Standard</b> <b>Model</b> of {{particle}} physics {{is a theory}} which describes {{three of the four}} known fundamental interactions between the elementary particles that make up all matter. This theory allows predictions to be made about how particles will interact under many conditions. The energy per particle in a supernova is typically one to one hundred and fifty picojoules (tens to hundreds of MeV). The per-particle energy involved in a supernova is small enough that the predictions gained from the <b>Standard</b> <b>Model</b> {{of particle}} physics are likely to be basically correct. But the high densities may require corrections to the <b>Standard</b> <b>Model.</b> In particular, Earth-based particle accelerators can produce particle interactions which are of much higher energy than are found in supernovae, but these experiments involve individual particles interacting with individual particles, and {{it is likely that the}} high densities within the supernova will produce novel effects. The interactions between neutrinos and the other particles in the supernova take place with the weak nuclear force, which is believed to be well understood. However, the interactions between the protons and neutrons involve the strong nuclear force, which is much less well understood.|$|E

5|$|The {{fundamental}} theories for forces {{developed from}} the unification of disparate ideas. For example, Isaac Newton unified, with his universal theory of gravitation, the force responsible for objects falling near {{the surface of the}} Earth with the force responsible for the falling of celestial bodies about the Earth (the Moon) and the Sun (the planets). Michael Faraday and James Clerk Maxwell demonstrated that electric and magnetic forces were unified through a theory of electromagnetism. In the 20th century, the development of quantum mechanics led to a modern understanding that the first three fundamental forces (all except gravity) are manifestations of matter (fermions) interacting by exchanging virtual particles called gauge bosons. This <b>standard</b> <b>model</b> of particle physics assumes a similarity between the forces and led scientists to predict the unification of the weak and electromagnetic forces in electroweak theory, which was subsequently confirmed by observation. The complete formulation of the <b>standard</b> <b>model</b> predicts an as yet unobserved Higgs mechanism, but observations such as neutrino oscillations suggest that the <b>standard</b> <b>model</b> is incomplete. A Grand Unified Theory that allows for the combination of the electroweak interaction with the strong force is held out as a possibility with candidate theories such as supersymmetry proposed to accommodate some of the outstanding unsolved problems in physics. Physicists are still attempting to develop self-consistent unification models that would combine all four fundamental interactions into a theory of everything. Einstein tried and failed at this endeavor, but currently the most popular approach to answering this question is string theory.|$|E

40|$|The <b>standard</b> {{macroeconomic}} <b>models</b> have failed, by all {{the most}} important tests of scientific theory. They did not predict that the financial crisis would happen; and when it did, they understated its effects. Monetary authorities allowed bubbles to grow and focused on keeping inflation low, partly because the <b>standard</b> <b>models</b> suggested that low inflation was necessary and almost sufficient for efficiency and growth. After the crisis broke, policymakers relying on the models floundered. Notwithstanding the diversity of macroeconomics, the sum of these failures {{points to the need}} for a fundamental re-examination of the models [...] and a reassertion of the lessons of modern general equilibrium theory that were seemingly forgotten in the years leading up to the crisis. This paper first describes the failures of the <b>standard</b> <b>models</b> in broad terms, and then develops the economics of deep downturns, and shows that such downturns are endogenous. Further, the paper argues that there have been systemic changes to the structure of the economy that made the economy more vulnerable to crisis, contrary to what the <b>standard</b> <b>models</b> argued. Finally, the paper contrasts the policy implications of our framework with those of the <b>standard</b> <b>models...</b>|$|R
