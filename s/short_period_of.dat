30|$|In Model 2, {{we allow}} for {{differences}} in ratings due to short unemployment and long unemployment (reference category: no unemployment). Long and <b>short</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> unemployment are associated with respective decreases of 12 and 8 % points in the ratings. The difference in the effect <b>of</b> long and <b>short</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> unemployment is both substantive and significant (χ 2 (1)[*]=[*] 5.66, p[*]<[*] 0.05). These findings lend further support to H 1. <b>Periods</b> <b>of</b> unemployment are globally associated with less favourable ratings. More precisely, long <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> unemployment will evoke a greater penalty than <b>shorter</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> unemployment.|$|R

5|$|A {{population}} bottleneck is when {{a population}} contracts to a significantly smaller size over a <b>short</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> time due to some random environmental event.

Small cirque and valley glaciers formed in {{north and east}} facing valleys, including Grisedale and the coves {{on the east side}} of Helvellyn. The results are seen in moraines of unsorted boulder gravel in the valleys, the spectacular coves with steep headwalls, and the sharp arêtes formed where the rock was eroded on both sides between adjacent glaciers.|$|E
