Herbal {{formulations}} {{claimed to}} cure several medical conditions including skin eruptions, chest pains, wounds, gout, menstrual pains, stress, nervous disorders, microbial and viral infections {{as well as}} stomach ailments have recently appeared as part of South African traditional medicine. The formulations consist of mixtures of extracts of different plant parts from several different plant species packaged in labelled bottles or boxes. The mixtures are available for sale in <b>herbal</b> <b>shops</b> and public places. While there has been widespread use of these herbal mixtures, {{there has been no}} scientific evidence to support their use. This project was aimed at documenting, validating claimed efficacy and testing the safety of fourteen unregistered commercial herbal preparations commonly sold in Pietermaritzburg. A detailed investigation of the pharmacological effects and safety of the plant components of one of the mixtures, Imbiza ephuzwato was also carried out...|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} is to use taxonomic method for authentication of traditional herbal drugs which are commonly sold in <b>herbal</b> <b>shops</b> in Iran. In this regard, twenty-seven cases of herbal drugs suspected to be adulterated were investigated. Material and methods: Crude raw material of herbal drugs was prepared from the various markets in Iran and was identified at the Ferdowsi University of Mashhad Herbarium (FUMH). Results: Taxonomic evaluation revealed that 78 species belonging to 21 families which are traded in Iranian market should be considered as authentic, adulterated and substituted samples. Conclusion: It was concluded that nowadays, many of the medicinal plants available in the market have ambiguous identification along with adulteration and contamination. The present study provides awareness amongst the traders, researchers, clinicians and manufacturing units about the ambiguity of authenticity in the traded herbal raw materials...|$|R

Three samples of Moringa from popular sources were acquired to determine heavy metal content and microbial contamination. The results were compared to specified limits in the European and Chinese pharmacopeia, World Health Organization guidelines and Bureau of Indian Standards. Moringa was available as capsules or powder in 73 % of the premises. Moringa was recommended for seven different disease conditions. Four different dosage regimens were prescribed. The main references cited for the counseling information were unscientific literature (62 %). The selected Moringa samples were contaminated with bacteria and fungi above the European Pharmacopeia specified limits. Escherichia coli and Salmonella species were present in all three samples. All three samples contained arsenic, nickel and cadmium above the permissible limits. Moringa oleifera with variable labeling {{information and}} poor microbial and heavy metal quality is widely available in Zimbabwe...|$|R

40|$|Local markets {{provide a}} rapid {{insight into the}} {{medicinal}} plants growing in a region {{as well as local}} traditional health concerns. Identification of market plant material can be challenging as plants are often sold in dried or processed forms. In this study, three approaches of DNA barcoding-based molecular identification of market samples are evaluated, two objective sequence matching approaches and an integrative approach that coalesces sequence matching with a priori and a posteriori data from other markers, morphology, ethnoclassification and species distribution. Plant samples from markets and <b>herbal</b> <b>shops</b> were identified using morphology, descriptions of local use, and vernacular names with relevant floras and pharmacopoeias. DNA barcoding was used for identification of samples that could not be identified to species level using morphology. Two methods based on BLAST similaritybased identification, were compared with an integrative identification approach. Integrative identification combining the optimized similarity-based approach with a priori and a posteriori information resulted in a 1. 67, 1. 95 and 2. 00 fold increase for ITS, trnL-F spacer, and both combined, respectively. DNA barcoding of traded plant material requires objective strategies to include data from multiple markers, morphology, and traditional knowledge to optimize species level identification success...|$|R
