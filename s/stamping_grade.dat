40|$|Abstract Martensitic {{sheet steel}} is {{increasingly}} {{being used in}} advanced car body construction, especially in areas where high crash loads are expected. Using such steels appropriately the weight of individual components can be reduced by up to 20 percent. Martensitic steel sheet is commercially available in the strength range of 1200 to 1900 MPa, either as cold forming or hot <b>stamping</b> <b>grade.</b> Whereas the strength of such martensitic steels is practically only {{a function of the}} carbon content, other properties such as ductility, toughness, bendability and delayed cracking resistance are severely influenced by other alloying elements and the particular thermal processing route. The paper discusses the influence of various key-alloying elements such as Nb, Mo and B on these properties and suggests routes to optimize the steelâ€™s behavior with respect to the manufacturing and application related aspects...|$|E
40|$|Escalating {{environmental}} concerns have prompted {{efforts to reduce}} vehicle weight and carbon emissions, resulting in increased application of advanced high strength steels (AHSS). 22 MnB 5 hot <b>stamping</b> <b>grade</b> AHSS, namely USIBOR 1500 P, provide high strength to weight ratio allowing sheet thickness reduction to decrease weight, while maintaining high safety characteristics. Resistance spot welding (RSW) has been the predominant welding process for automotive assemblies. Welding hot-stamping AHSS has introduced new challenges for achieving acceptable welds. The added alloying elements and high hardenability characteristics resulting in low weldability and weld toughness complicates this initiative. The current study examines the effects of in-process weld tempering with secondary current pulse has on the weld toughness during RSW of USIBOR steels. RSW and weld tempering were tested on USIBOR at two different surface conditions; as-delivered and hot-stamped. Joint performance properties, micro-hardness map profiles, and failure modes of welds for both tempered and non-tempered conditions are detailed. Furthermore, a relationship between resulting joint performance and microstructural evolution is produced. The objective of this work is to optimize in-process tempering parameters, analyze metallurgical evolution of the weldments, and compare the effects on mechanical performance for both tempered and non-tempered welds...|$|E

50|$|Beef grading service {{began in}} 1917 {{as a way}} to {{determine}} both the quality and the quantity of beef that would come from each carcass. <b>Stamping</b> the <b>grades</b> began in May 1927. Each carcass can be stamped with a yield or quality stamp, or a combination of both. The standards have been revised many times since the original standards were formulated. A few notable changes include combining Prime and choice grades into Prime, and changing the Good grade to choice, this change occurred in 1950. In 1980 conditions were set forth to establish guidance on grading protocol. This included a 10-minute bloom time before the grader evaluates the carcass. Most beef plants will allow a longer time for bloom depending on the speed of the grading chain.|$|R
50|$|The hinging {{referred}} to in these terms is mounting of the stamp in a stamp album by {{the application of a}} stamp hinge {{to the back of the}} <b>stamp.</b> The highest <b>grade</b> is unmounted mint or mint never hinged. The term mint never hinged has developed to provide reassurance to buyers that the stamp has not been tampered with to remove traces of mounting, as the term unmounted mint was thought to be ambiguous.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a P. C. based system for electronic submission, grading and return of undergraduate laboratory reports. The system was implemented {{as a pilot}} study at the University of South Florida (USF) during the summer 1998, and proved to be very successful. The system {{is based on an}} e-mail attachment approach, but {{this turned out to be}} by-no-means as trivial as might first be assumed. A variety of issues had to be addressed, such as: establishing e-mail accounts and connections; software requirements and acquisition; overcoming e-mail send size and faculty account size limitations; ensuring security/privacy; filtering and issuing electronic receipts; and deadline compliance through date/time <b>stamps.</b> Electronic <b>grading</b> and return of annotated reports presented particular challenges. In order to approach the clarity and convenience of physically marking paper with a pen, faculty required annotation software and hardware in the form of a pen-pointer input device. Many of the tech [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} volume {{fraction}} and hardness of martensite on the Bauschinger effect in Dual Phase (DP) steel was investigated for strain levels close to those observed in automotive <b>stamping.</b> Five different <b>grades</b> of DP steel were produced by controlled heat treatment allowing {{the examination of}} the Bauschinger effect for three different volume fractions of martensite and three levels of martensite hardness. Compression-tension and shear reversal tests were performed to examine the Bauschinger effect at high levels of forming strain. Good correlation between the shear reversal and the compression-tension test was observed suggesting that for DP steel, shear stress strain data, converted to equivalent stress-strain, may be applied directly to characterize kinematic hardening behavior for numerical simulations. Permanent softening was observed following strain reversal and increased with martensite volume fraction and pre-strain level. While the Bauschinger ratio saturates at 3 % pre-strain, the Bauschinger strain increases linearly with forming strain without showing saturation. This suggests that to model material behavior accurately in forming processes involving complex loading paths and high levels of strain, test data generated at high strain is required...|$|R
40|$|In 2014, Brazil hosted one of {{the most}} popular sport {{competitions}} in the world, the FIFA World Cup. Concerned about the intense migration of tourists, the Brazilian government decided to deploy a food safety strategy based on inspection scores and a grading system applied to food services. The present study aimed to evaluate the results of the food safety strategy deployed during the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil. To assess food safety, an evaluation instrument was applied twice in 1927 food service establishments from 26 cities before the start of the competition. This instrument generated a food safety score for each establishment that ranged from 0. 0 (no flaws observed) to 2565. 95, with four possible grades: A (0. 0 - 13. 2); B (13. 3 - 502. 6); C (502. 7 - 1152. 2); and pending (more than 1152. 3). Each food service received a <b>stamp</b> with the <b>grade</b> of the second evaluation. After the end of the World Cup, a study was conducted with different groups of the public to evaluate the acceptance of the strategy. To this end, 221 consumers, 998 food service owners or managers, 150 health surveillance auditors, and 27 health surveillance coordinators were enrolled. These participants completed a survey with positive and negative responses about the inspection score system through a 5 -point Likert scale. A reduction in violation scores from 393. 1 to 224. 4 (p < 0. 001) was observed between the first and second evaluation cycles. Of the food services evaluated, 38. 7 % received the A stamp, 41. 4 % the B stamp, and 13. 9 % the C stamp. All positive responses on "system reliability" presented a mean of 4. 0 or more, indicating that the public believed this strategy is reliable for communicating risks and promoting food safety. The strategy showed positive results regarding food safety and public acceptance. The deployed strategy promoted improvements in the food safety of food services. The implementation of a permanent policy may be well accepted by the public and may greatly contribute to a reduction in foodborne diseases (FBDs) ...|$|R
