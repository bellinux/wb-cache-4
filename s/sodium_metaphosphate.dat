40|$|Purpose: <b>Sodium</b> <b>metaphosphate</b> has beenadded todentifricesandchewing-gumsforinhibiting the stainingof teeth. As <b>sodium</b> <b>metaphosphate</b> may easilybind to hydroxyapatite,it may {{block or}} inhibit stain {{adsorption}} tohydroxyapatite. In-office bleaching has beenwidelyused. In the treatment, {{it is recommended}} to avoiddark-color foods and drinks for 24 hours after bleaching to prevent discolorationof tooth-surface. If <b>sodium</b> <b>metaphosphate</b> was applied tothe enamel after bleaching, it {{might be expected to}} inhibit staining caused by dark-color foods and drinks. In addition, if <b>sodium</b> <b>metaphosphate</b> formsa stable membrane by chemicalreactionwith enamel hydroxyapatite, the effect of the staining inhibition might be expected to continue for a long time. Therefore, the present study evaluatedtheinhibition effect after bleaching and investigatedthe adsorptionof <b>sodium</b> <b>metaphosphate</b> on enamel after in-office bleaching using spectrophotometer, and XRD and FTIR analysis. Methods: Twenty-four extracted human upper incisors were treated with Hi-Lite, and thentooth-surface color was determined by a spectrophotometer. The teeth were then divided into four groups: 1) Untreated: Control group (Con), 2) Polished with Merssage(Mer), 3) Applied with Butler Fluodent Foam A(Flu). 4) Immersed in human saliva containing 1 % <b>sodium</b> <b>metaphosphate</b> for 35 min (SMP). Con, Mer, Flu were then immersed in human saliva at 37 ０C for 120 min, and SMP was immersed for 85 min. After that, all groups were stored in 1. 4 % coffee at 37 ０C. Color measurement was performed at 24, 48 and 72 h．The color changebetween before and after immersion in coffee was expressed by ΔE*, ΔL*, Δa* and Δb*. Additionally, SEM observation of the enamel surface and XRD and FTIR analyses of hydroxyapatite after immersion in 1 % <b>sodium</b> <b>metaphosphate</b> were performed. Results: Regarding ΔL*at 24 h, ΔL* of SMP was smaller than those of the other groups, which confirmed the staining inhibition effect of SMP. According to SEM, <b>sodium</b> <b>metaphosphate</b> was observed as a thin film on enamel, however, {{there was no evidence of}} chemical reactionbetween hydroxyapatiteand <b>sodium</b> <b>metaphosphate</b> by XRD and FTIRanalyses. Conclusion: Sodium metaphosphateprovided a staining inhibition effect for bleached teeth during storage in coffee for 24 h. However, no evidence of chemical reaction between <b>sodium</b> <b>metaphosphate</b> and bleached enamel was found under the conditions of the present study. 目的:近年，歯石の沈着防止やステイン除去の成分としてメタリン酸ナトリウムが注目されている．メタリン酸ナトリウムは安全性も担保されており，食品添加物，医薬品，医 薬部外品の他，歯磨剤にも添加されている．メタリン酸ナトリウムは，ハイドロキシアパタイト(HAp) と結合してステインを除去すると考えられるが，詳細は明らかではない． 35 ％H 2 O 2 のオフィスブリーチング剤では， 24 時間は色の濃い飲食物を控えることが推奨 されている．本研究では，メタリン酸ナトリウムのステイン除去効果に着目し，漂白後の 着色抑制効果を分光測色計で，吸着を XRD，FTIR で評価した．材料と方法：松風の Hi-Lite®を用いて，健全ヒト抜去上顎切歯の唇側に漂白を行った 後，分光測色計で CIE L*a*b* 表色系により測色した．その後, 1) 処理を行っていない群 (Con) ， 2) メルサージュ®で研磨した群(Mer) ， 3) フローデンフォーム A®を塗布した群 (Flu) ， 4) 1 ％メタリン酸ナトリウム溶液に 35 分浸漬した群(SMP) に分け，各処理後に Con，Mer，Flu は唾液に 120 分，SMP は 85 分浸漬して 37 ℃で保管した．その後， 37 ℃ のコーヒーに 24 ， 48 ， 72 時間保管し，コーヒー浸漬前後のΔE*，ΔL*，Δa*，Δb*を求め て，着色抑制効果を評価した．求めた値の比較は Tukey test と Games-Howell test を用いて行った．メタリン酸ナトリウム水溶液に浸漬したエナメル質表面の SEM 観察およびメタリン酸 ナトリウム水溶液中で撹拌して作製した HAp の XRD および FTIR 分析を行った．結果： 24 ， 48 ， 72 時間後のΔE*では群間で有意差はなかった．一方， 24 時間後のΔL* では SMP 群が他群に対して有意に明度の低下が少なかったが， 48 ， 72 時間では差がなかった．メタリン酸ナトリウム群の SEM ではエナメル質が膜状の構造物に覆われており，XRD 分析では，未反応の HAp と同じ回折ピークが観察された．FTIR 分析では，未反応の HAp と同じスペクトルの他に，メタリン酸ナトリウムに帰属される吸収ピークが確認された．結論：メタリン酸ナトリウムはエナメル質表層に吸着されるが，化学的な反応はない と考えられる．着色抑制効果に関しては， 24 時間まではコーヒーによる明度の低下を抑制したが, その効果は 48 ， 72 時間は持続しなかった...|$|E

After rinsing over a 63 ?m sieve, the samples were dried, and then transferred to a storage vial. Each sample was examined under a low-power binocular microscope to identify and quantify the assemblage of microfossils. I also analyzed the microfossil specimens using the scanning electron microscope to aid in identification and capture images of the important specimens. Results document changes {{in the composition of}} microfossil shells and faunal assemblages through time. In general, the dominant sediment lithology is red clay. However, several cores contain evidence of significant sediment variability through time. Typically, South Pacific deep waters are corrosive to calcium carbonate, so the preservation of carbonate fossils in the sediments reflects intervals of anomalous ocean chemistry that in turn may reflect changes in atmospheric CO? inventories. These results show that over a relatively short geologic period, the ocean level at the coring site fluctuated between shallower nutrient rich waters and deeper carbonate rich waters. Future work, in collaboration with colleagues at the University of Michigan and Boise State University, will focus on more precise determinations of the sediment layer ages and geochemical analyses of the microfossils to determine ancient oceanic and atmospheric circulation patterns...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{determine}} the dissolving ability (DA) of linear pentasodium tripolyphosphate (PSTP), cyclic trisodium metaphosphate (TSMP), polymeric <b>sodium</b> <b>metaphosphate</b> (SMP) on synthetic crystals of calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) and on crystalline aggregates of menisci from patients with chondrocalcinosis (CC).  METHODS—Synthetic CPPD crystals were mixed with {{phosphate buffered saline}} (PBS), which contained the different polyphosphates, for one hour at 37 °C. The calcified menisci {{were obtained from the}} knees of four female patients with CPPD disease who underwent total arthroscopic meniscectomy for degenerative meniscal lesions. Meniscal cryosections and fragments were incubated in SMP (15  mg/ml PBS) at 37 °C for one hour and 24  hours, respectively. Histological evaluation on meniscal samples after polyphosphate incubation was carried out by ordinary transmitted light microscopy and polarised light microscopy. The dissolution of CPPD crystals by polyphosphates was assessed by atomic absorption spectroscopy, which determined the amount of calcium liberated from synthetic crystals and meniscal fragments. Cytotoxicity of SMP was evaluated by tetrazolium salt assay and by an ultrastructural study on cultured chondrocytes.  RESULTS—SMP and PSTP showed higher DA on CPPD crystals than TSMP. Analysis of the DA values at increasing concentrations of SMP showed that a concentration of 15  mg/ml completely dissolved 2. 0  mg CPPD crystals. The solution of meniscal CPPD crystals showed a significant increase of calcium concentration after three hours and 24  hours of SMP incubation (p= 0. 0001; Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance) compared with fragments incubated in PBS control solution. Macroscopic and microscopic evaluation of meniscal specimens showed a notable reduction of CPPD deposits. A 50 % inhibitory dose on cultured chondrocytes was reached at the maximum concentration of SMP used in this work (15  mg/ml); ultrastructural analysis did not show morphological alterations in the treated cells.  CONCLUSION—The results {{of this study indicate that}} linear polyphosphates are effective in dissolving both synthetic and ex vivo CPPD crystal aggregates. This suggests a potential therapeutic use for these molecules in the treatment of symptomatic CC. ...|$|E
40|$|T OST {{persons who}} are {{conscious}} of their teeth {{would like to have}} them free lVI from dingy films or deposits. It is not only believed that such tooth sur-faces look better, but that they give out less odor. ' It is also known that most gingivitis is caused by local irritation and that accumulations on the teeth brought about by faulty oral hygiene constitute the greatest source of local irritation. The part that the dentifrice actually plays as an adjunct to the toothbrush in this matter of appearance and the maintenance of oral hygiene has only been partially determined. ' Phillips 6 studied the abrasiveness of dentifrices and the resulting effect on tooth luster. This study showed that smooth, lustrous tooth surfaces were pro-duced by a <b>sodium</b> <b>metaphosphate</b> type of dentifrice. Phillips also showed that this smoothness of surface might be brought about with no appreciable abrasive effect on enamel and with the development of a minimum amount of erosion of exposed cervical dentin. Later Phillips ' showed that surfaces of extracted teeth with a high luster accumulated fewer bacteria from contact than did surfaces with a low degree of luster. Several serious {{attempts have been made to}} study the deposits usually found on teeth. These opinions and findings have been carefully summarized bv Vallotton. 8 There are of course several different types of unsightly tooth sur-face accumulations recognized today. Exactly what these stains are, how they form, how they attach themselves to the teeth, and how they may be prevented from forming are questions not yet answered. Until these points are better understood, it is our opinion that there will be a need for a better method of comparing tooth cleanliness so that the effectiveness of dentifrices, brushes, and techniques can be properly evaluated. It is, therefore, the purpose of this study to compare the cleansing effect of various dentifrices upon the visible surfaces of the teeth. This has been accomplished by having dental students brush their teeth for three weeks each with several different dentifrices. Kodachrome photo-ngraphic records are used to estimate the comparative effectiveness of the denti-frices. Comparisons are made on the basis of the differences in cleanliness of the tooth surfaces visible to the naked eye...|$|E
