As an arranger you're usually trying to take the songs and put a structure on them, but what I thought was valuable was when you took the centre out of the track and worked around the central core of the tonality and changes. That left you with a sort of floating free-form tapestry behind what she was doing, which is when things became more abstract.|$|E

I wish I could remember exactly how we did the slide part – not writing it down is one of the banes of my life! We did it in three passes through a harmonizer, set to some weird interval, like a sixth. There was a different harmonization for each pass. For the line in harmonics, I retuned the guitar so that I could play it all at the 12th fret with natural harmonics. It's doubled several times.|$|E

500|$|For the {{sequences}} {{involving the}} terraforming {{of the city}} Metropolis, Double Negative handled the visual effects for the sequence. In order to construct a Metropolis that seemed convincing and realistic, Double Negative utilized Esri's CityEngine to help procedurally deliver the city. [...] "That was a much more sci-fi based role," [...] said Double Negative visual effects supervisor Ged Wright, “so we took {{what they had done}} and extended it a great deal. The work we were doing was based around the Downtowns for New York, L.A. and Chicago and that gave us the building volumes for heights.

Set decorator Cal Loucks said that most items that looked metal were actually painted silver with special paint to remove its reflective quality.

A young Peter Parker appears as the child wearing an Iron Man mask who Stark saves from a drone; the appearance was confirmed in June 2017 by eventual Spider-Man actor Tom Holland, Kevin Feige and [...] director Jon Watts. The film's post-credits scene showed the discovery of Thor's hammer in a crater.|$|E

Speaking to Guy Blackman from The Age, Guiver recalled [...] "The person who played the vicar, and wore the vicar's robe, he smoked cigarettes, <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be careful that they were dry-cleaned before services on Sunday.

500|$|Helen Baxendale {{was nearing}} the end of her pregnancy, so could not join the rest of the cast abroad, thus all of her scenes were filmed in Manchester and Salford. The scenes in Rachel and Adam's hotel room were shot at the Lowry Hotel in Salford and {{exterior}} scenes of the hotel were filmed at the GMEX Centre. The taxi that takes Rachel and Adam to the hospital was a Holden car imported to Britain from Australia and altered to look like a taxi. The Loaf bar at Deansgate Locks provided a filming location for some scenes. The final scene of the episode was filmed on an aeroplane set constructed in a studio. Robert Bathurst said, [...] "We shot the scene in the studio because we weren't allowed to film on a real aircraft. <b>So</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> get sections of a plane's interior and stick them all together.

500|$|To {{boost its}} declining readership, Deadline {{featured}} Tank Girl {{on its cover}} many times in 1994 and 1995 {{in anticipation of the}} film's release. Subsequently, Tom Astor said the release of the film: [...] "was very helpful, but it did not make up the difference, it lost some of its cult appeal without gaining any mainstream credibility." [...] The magazine ceased publication in late 1995. Alan Martin and Jamie Hewlett have since spoken negatively of their experiences creating the film, calling it [...] "a bit of a sore point" [...] for them. [...] "The script was lousy," [...] Hewlett recalled, [...] "me and Alan kept rewriting it and putting Grange Hill jokes and Benny Hill jokes in, and they obviously weren't getting it. They forgot to film about ten major scenes <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> animate them... it was a horrible experience." [...] Talalay complained that the studio interfered significantly in the story, screenplay, and feel of the film. She said that she had been [...] "in sync" [...] and on good terms with Martin and Hewlett until the studio made significant cuts to the film, which she had no control over. Peter Milligan wrote an adaptation comic in 1995, and a novelization of the film by Martin Millar was published in 1996.|$|E
500|$|To {{make the}} Eastern Spirit roll realistically in the storm, the {{developers}} {{had to write}} a completely new program. They found that making the ship move was easy, but getting it to respond to storm conditions was much more complex. As such, they created a complete roll editor, called the Darkwave editor, which allowed them to control the pitch (when the ship moves on the horizontal axis) and the roll (when it moves on the vertical axis) separately. The combination of moving the ship on both axes allowed the developers to create realistic ship movements. This in turn allowed them to time the exact movement of the ship to coincide with {{what was happening in}} the game without having to use a cutscene. However, creating such a realistic movement system led to camera problems. According to programmer, Claude Levastre, early in development, [...] "the camera was constantly going through the walls because of the roll movement. <b>So</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> develop an inertia-control system for the camera, just as if a cameraman is using a steadicam behind the hero." [...] Another change brought about by the ship's motion was that initially, the movement patterns of inanimate objects on the ship were scripted, but this was later replaced with real physics.|$|E
