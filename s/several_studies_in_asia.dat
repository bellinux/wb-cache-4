30|$|One {{cornerstone}} within Health Care {{that has}} had great impact on cancer patients is {{the increasing number of}} personalized medicines being introduced into the market. The interest in personalized medicines actually results from understanding the molecular biology of diseases. This is mandatory, where the alignment of molecular signatures with particular disease forms, and our ability to measure markers associated with prognosis and outcomes is at the focus of Clinical and Translational Medicine. In this respect, personalized medicines treatment has now become a part of large cohort studies. I have been involved in large such non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in <b>several</b> <b>studies</b> <b>in</b> <b>Asia,</b> and the outcome and impact has been overwhelming. In my view, the Clinical and Translational Medicine is a research field that bridges knowledge of disease processes, gained by in vitro and experimental animal models, with the disease pathways found in humans.|$|E

40|$|Temperament Evaluation of Memphis, Pisa, Paris and San Diego &# 8211; Auto{{questionnaire}} (TEMPSA) is a self-rated {{questionnaire that}} measures five dimensions of affective temperaments. It {{is designed for}} assessing affective temperaments in general and clinical population. Estimation of the affective temperaments proved {{to play an important}} role in prediction and assessment of early signs of mood disorders. The aim of our study was to translate, adapt and analyse the long version of the TEMPS-A instrument. 1167 students from different Slovenian universities participated. We analysed the results with classical test theory and Rasch model. The results showed good reliability of all five scales with alpha coefficients between. 76 and. 84, only the reliability of the depressive temperament was lower in comparison with other subscales (α=. 66). With the principal component analysis we extracted five components. Hyperthymic temperament proved to be the most homogenous, yet less sensitive to discriminate between those with adaptive personality structure on one hand and possibility to develop mood disorder in the future on the other. The structure of anxious temperament is not very clear, since two different types of anxious temperament emerged. The first one relates to somatic items, whereas the other links more to the items of general anxiousness. Nevertheless, our results are in agreement with <b>several</b> previous <b>studies</b> <b>in</b> Europe, <b>Asia</b> and North and South America...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Tackling {{neonatal}} mortality {{is essential for}} the achievement of the child survival millennium development goal. There are just under 4 million neonatal deaths, accounting for 38 % of the 10. 8 million deaths among children younger than 5 years of age taking place each year; 99 % of these occur in low- and middle-income countries where a large proportion of births take place at home, and where postnatal care for mothers and neonates is either not available or is of poor quality. WHO and UNICEF have issued a joint statement calling for governments to implement "Home visits for the newborn child: a strategy to improve survival", following <b>several</b> <b>studies</b> <b>in</b> South <b>Asia</b> which achieved substantial reductions in {{neonatal mortality}} through community-based approaches. However, their feasibility and effectiveness have not yet been evaluated in Africa. The Newhints study aims to do this in Ghana and to develop a feasible and sustainable community-based approach to improve newborn care practices, and by so doing improve neonatal survival. Methods Newhints is an integrated intervention package based on extensive formative research, and developed in close collaboration with seven District Health Management Teams (DHMTs) in Brong Ahafo Region. The core component is training the existing community based surveillance volunteers (CBSVs) to identify pregnant women and to conduct two home visits during pregnancy and three {{in the first week of}} life to address essential care practices, and to assess and refer very low birth weight and sick babies. CBSVs are supported by a set of materials, regular supervisory visits, incentives, sensitisation activities with TBAs, health facility staff and communities, and providing training for essential newborn care in health facilities. Newhints is being evaluated through a cluster randomised controlled trial, and intention to treat analyses. The clusters are 98 supervisory zones; 49 have been randomised for implementation of the Newhints intervention, with the other 49 acting as controls. Data on neonatal mortality and care practices will be collected from approximately 15, 000 babies through surveillance of women of child-bearing age in the 7 districts. Detailed process, cost and cost-effectiveness evaluations are also being carried out. Trial registration [URL] (identifier NCT 00623337) </p...|$|R
40|$|Jakarta has {{suffered}} major floods in 2002, 2007, and 2013. To cope with and adapt {{to both the}} current and future flood problem, the city requires quantitative assessments of flood risk. <b>In</b> this <b>study,</b> we develop a flood risk assessment model for Jakarta. The model {{is based on the}} Damagescanner model, adapted for Jakarta using local information on hazard, exposure, and vulnerability. The model was first set up using existing estimates of economic exposure of different land use classes to represent exposure and depth-damage functions (vulnerability curves) from <b>several</b> existing <b>studies</b> <b>in</b> south-east <b>Asia</b> to represent vulnerability. Using these data to simulate damage led to an overestimation by several orders of magnitude. Hence, we held a series of expert meetings and workshops with local stakeholders to develop specific estimates of economic exposure per land use class and to derive vulnerability curves specific for Jakarta. We compare the resulting simulated damages to reported damages and found them to be in good agreement, giving confidence {{in the use of the}} model for flood risk assessment. Under current conditions, we found the annual expected damage due to river flooding in Jakarta to be approximately USD 321 million per year. We also examined the sensitivity of flood risk assessments to the use of different vulnerability curves. The sensitivity is high: using the six curves described <b>in</b> this <b>study</b> to simulate risk led to a factor eight difference between the lowest and highest values. Our findings demonstrate that flood risk assessments need to pay close attention to the selection, development, and testing of vulnerability curves...|$|R
