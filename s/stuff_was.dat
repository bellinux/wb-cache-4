5|$|The ironic {{thing is}} that we grew up {{listening}} to primarily American music {{and fell in love with}} American music. I love country music. I grew up with George Jones and Charley Pride and Jim Reeves. All that <b>stuff</b> <b>was</b> playing in the house. That's what I wanted to seek out. That's what I wanted to play. Carol was into Tammy Wynette. Trev Warner is Kym's dad, and he was the first person to bring bluegrass music to Australia.|$|E
5|$|UHF – Original Motion Picture Soundtrack and Other <b>Stuff</b> <b>was</b> {{released}} July 18, 1989. After it was released, {{the album}} peaked at number 146 on the Billboard 200. Much like Polka Party! (1986), {{the album was}} considered a major commercial disappointment for the comedian; the album is his second-lowest charting album after Polka Party! (1986). The UHF soundtrack {{is one of only}} a few of Yankovic's studio albums that is not certified either Gold or Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in the United States. The others include Polka Party! and Poodle Hat (2003). UHF would also be Yankovic's last studio album to be released in the US on vinyl record until 2011's Alpocalypse.|$|E
5000|$|Drummer Jason Costa stated {{about the}} album: [...] "It {{definitely}} still sounds like us. But the heavy <b>stuff</b> <b>is</b> heavier, and the faster <b>stuff</b> <b>is</b> faster. We all really challenged ourselves on this album. And the radio <b>stuff</b> <b>is</b> more… not more radio, but there's definitely more singing, there's more melody {{and stuff like}} that. But the songs are fast; {{we have a lot}} of fast burners on this album. And the double-bass stuff for the heavier songs is really challenging for me this time. The patterns are super-hard, some of them." ...|$|R

The <b>stuffing</b> <b>is</b> cooked separately {{so that the}} flavors mix. Once the <b>stuffing</b> <b>is</b> cooked, it is put into the molded flour dough, which is made by adding the mixture of boiled water and achiote powder, thus giving the flour the red coloring.

5|$|Dunn {{trained and}} showed Tennessee Walking Horses for 50 years, and {{during his career}} won two World Grand Championships and 20 World Championships with various horses, {{competing}} in 125 to 150 horse shows a year. Dunn participated in the breed's major annual horse show, the Tennessee Walking Horse National Celebration, nearly every year from 1950. By 1993 he was so popular that he often signed autographs for several hours before a performance. In total, Dunn personally showed 108 horses at the Celebration, and several hundred others which he trained were shown by other riders. Among them was Sundust Royal Flush, a stallion who, at the 1970 Celebration, won both the Preliminary Stallion class and the Three-Year-Old World Championship. Among other winning horses were Stock Exchange, who won the Junior Stallion Championship at the Dixie Jubilee in Baton Rouge, Louisiana in 1984, and Yankee Delight, who won the Grand Championship at the same show. Dunn rode both horses to their wins. Among horses that were trained by Dunn but ridden by amateur riders, Delight Puff and <b>Stuff</b> <b>was</b> Amateur Champion, and Aces Executive was Ladies' Champion, also in 1984.|$|E
25|$|Jon Oliva formed his own band, Jon Oliva's Pain, and {{released}} their first album in 2004 entitled 'Tage Mahal. Through the years Jon Oliva's Pain, also called JOP, published many records and during their live concerts they always {{play a lot}} of Savatage's songs from the albums with Criss Oliva. Additional material, taken by Jon from his brother's unused <b>stuff,</b> <b>was</b> used to write several Jon Oliva's Pain's tracks as described in the album's credits.|$|E
25|$|When Allen read Robert Daley's book, Prince of the City (1978), she was {{convinced}} it was a Sidney Lumet project, but the film rights had already been sold to Orion Pictures for Brian De Palma and David Rabe. Allen {{let it be known}} that if that deal should fall through, then she wanted the picture for Sidney. Just as Lumet was about to sign for a different picture, they got the call that Prince of the City was theirs. Allen hadn't wanted to write Prince of the City, just produce it. She was put off by the book's non-linear story structure, but Lumet wouldn't make the picture without her and agreed to write the outline for her. Lumet and Allen went over the book and agreed on what they could use and what they could do without. To her horror, Lumet would come in every day for weeks and scribble on legal pads. She was terrified that she would have to tell him that his <b>stuff</b> <b>was</b> unusable, but to her delight the outline was wonderful and she went to work. It was her first project with living subjects, and Allen interviewed nearly everyone in the book and had endless hours of Bob Leuci's tapes for back-up. With all her research and Lumet's outline, she eventually turned out a 365-page script in 10 days. It was nearly impossible to sell the studio on a three-hour picture, but by offering to slash the budget to $10 million they agreed.|$|E

500|$|After {{the first}} Arrow/Flash crossover, Brian Lowry of Variety applauded the {{producers}} for replicating {{the success of}} Arrow, but with [...] "a lighter tone," [...] and [...] "a hero with genuine super powers" [...] in The Flash. He noted while the crossover [...] "does a nifty job of bringing the two series together" [...] it was unlikely [...] "to boost the shared audience between them much more than already exists". Meredith Borders of Birth.Movies.Death called the crossover episodes [...] "fun," [...] noting that..."plenty of show-specific plot <b>stuff</b> <b>was</b> advanced without spelling it out for newbies. New viewers to either show could follow along {{and have a good}} time, but veteran viewers were rewarded with major storyline motion." ...|$|E
500|$|Gilbert soon {{realised}} that {{it would}} be difficult to design the game by himself; he decided to join forces with Tim Schafer and Dave Grossman, both of whom he hired for Lucasfilm. The game's insult sword fighting mechanics were influenced by swashbuckling movies starring Errol Flynn, which Gilbert, Schafer and Grossman often watched for inspiration. They noticed that pirates in those films often taunted their opponents instead of attacking them, which gave the designers the idea to base the game's duels on insults rather than combat. Writer Orson Scott Card helped them write the insults during a visit to Lucasfilm's headquarters at Skywalker Ranch. Many of Gilbert's original gameplay ideas were abandoned during the production process, although he stated that [...] "most of that <b>stuff</b> <b>was</b> left out for a reason".|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} television sources and critics. Ahsan Haque of IGN gave the episode 7.5/10 and said: [...] "While it featured more than [...] {{a couple of}} genuinely unfunny ideas, this episode succeeds for the most part. [...] While this episode definitely won't make anyone's top ten list of great Family Guy, there was a much better balance between random humor and storytelling in this outing". Genevieve Koski of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A-, and said that Family Guy [...] "started things out {{on the wrong foot}} with an oh-so-relevant Jackass storyline. [...] Most of the Jackass <b>stuff</b> <b>was</b> way too stale–Peter jackknifing Quagmire into the crate of bees notwithstanding–but thankfully it was just setup for a far superior storyline, the introduction of a younger 'New Brian'".|$|E

500|$|At the University of Florida, Youngblood was {{a brother}} of the Alpha Tau Omega Fraternity (Alpha Omega Chapter), and was a three-year varsity letterman for coach Ray Graves and coach Doug Dickey's Florida Gators {{football}} teams from 1968 to 1970. Youngblood had entered school at 195 pounds and put on 10 pounds a year through weight-lifting, finishing around 245 pounds. Youngblood and his teammates {{were part of the}} testing for what became Gatorade, a beverage created by doctors Robert Cade and Dana Shires, designed to help Gator athletes who had to practice and play in Central Florida heat. Said Youngblood, [...] "Dr. Cade began experimenting with Gatorade my freshman year. He tried to kill us all! That first <b>stuff</b> <b>was</b> lethal!

500|$|The {{first wave}} of punk rock was aggressively modern, {{distancing}} itself from the bombast and sentimentality of early 1970s rock. According to Ramones drummer Tommy Ramone, [...] "In its initial form, a lot of [...] <b>stuff</b> <b>was</b> innovative and exciting. Unfortunately, {{what happens is that}} people who could not hold a candle to the likes of Hendrix started noodling away. Soon you had endless solos that went nowhere. By 1973, I knew that what was needed was some pure, stripped down, no bullshit rock 'n' roll." [...] John Holmstrom, founding editor of Punk magazine, recalls feeling [...] "punk rock had to come along because the rock scene had become so tame that [...] like Billy Joel and Simon and Garfunkel were being called rock and roll, when to me and other fans, rock and roll meant this wild and rebellious music." [...] In critic Robert Christgau's description, [...] "It was also a subculture that scornfully rejected the political idealism and Californian flower-power silliness of hippie myth." ...|$|E
500|$|After posting the demos {{on their}} Myspace page, the xx drew the {{interest}} of Young Turks, an imprint label of XL Recordings. They submitted the demos to XL's head office at Ladbroke Grove and were subsequently signed to a recording contract. The group worked with producers such as Diplo and Kwes, to no success before they were introduced to audio engineer Rodaidh McDonald by the xx's manager Caius Pawson, who gave him three CDs of demos titled [...] "Early Demos", [...] "Recorded in Rehearsal Space", and [...] "What Producers Did Wrong". McDonald {{was impressed by the}} intimate quality and use of silence on the demos, which both he and the band felt may have challenged other producers who wanted to incorporate their individual tastes: [...] "They'd worked with about four other producers before then that had—and no discredit to them—I guess they'd seen a lot of space to add a kind of stamp on. There was a lot of empty space in the xx's music, even then, in the 'Early Demos'. But we just found that the best <b>stuff</b> <b>was</b> the most sparse." ...|$|E

500|$|Weiland's lyrics were {{unique to}} {{previous}} albums, {{which had been}} solely focused on himself and his drug addictions. He studied lyricists {{to learn how to}} write differently. [...] " [...] the '90s, I was so overwhelmed with my heroin addiction, and so a lot of the <b>stuff</b> <b>was</b> just from my point of view. Now, I tend {{to look at some of}} the greats like Leonard Cohen and Bob Dylan. I look at their storytelling [...] I try to tell stories. Every song doesn't have to be narcissistically written about how I feel on that day." [...] Stone Temple Pilots became the third album Weiland had ever recorded sober, after Velvet Revolver's Libertad and Stone Temple Pilot's first album, Core. Weiland was also influenced by his ex-wife, Mary Forsberg, about whom he specifically wrote on [...] "Cinnamon". Weiland's inspiration for [...] "First Kiss on Mars" [...] came from the music itself. He explained his lyrics succinctly: [...] "When I first heard , it sounded intergalactic." [...] Critics and interviewers of the band noticed that Weiland's vocalizations were drawn from David Bowie.|$|E
500|$|Wengren commented, [...] "We {{thought it}} would be pretty cool, {{especially}} for the fans, if we brought back maybe a song or two, that were actually written during the same period that The Sickness songs were written. Danny brought in some old demo tapes, I'm talking twelve years old, back when 'Down With the Sickness' and 'Stupify' , and all that <b>stuff</b> <b>was</b> written, this was actually written before that." [...] The songs that Wengren was referring to were [...] "Perfect Insanity", and [...] "Divide". The band also recorded a version of the song [...] "Midlife Crisis", which was originally performed by Faith No More. Draiman comments, [...] "We took the song, revamped it and modernized it to our current level, and the version's killer." [...] However, the song did not make it into the final track listing of the album, and is instead featured on Covered, A Revolution in Sound. This version of [...] "Midlife Crisis" [...] later appeared on The Lost Children, the band's first compilation album.|$|E
500|$|Reviews of {{the episode}} were mixed, calling it a [...] "slow start to the season."

[...] Iverson went on to comment, however, that [...] "it probably won't be remembered as fondly as some {{of the episode}}s from the first few seasons." [...] For him, the [...] "funniest aspect of the episode" [...] was the radio scene, in which [...] "we get the impression that [...] are immature, simple-minded idiots." [...] Brett Love of TV Squad reviewed the episode slightly more negatively, stating that [...] "the whole Peter story just didn't do much for me." [...] Love did find that the [...] "Stewie and Brian <b>stuff</b> <b>was</b> {{the best part of the}} episode," [...] but went on to proclaim that [...] "there are 20 more episodes to get it right." [...] In his review of the Family Guy Volume 5 box set, Francis Rizzo of DVD Talk wrote that the radio subplot is [...] "a perfect parody of everything that's wrong in radio." ...|$|E
