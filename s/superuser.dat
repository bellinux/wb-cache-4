40|$|Engagement {{in online}} social network-delivered weight loss {{interventions}} is {{a predictor of}} weight loss. Incentivizing engagement in a subset of participants may increase group engagement and subsequent weight loss. In a pilot feasibility trial, 56 adults with obesity were randomized to two Facebook-delivered weight loss interventions, one had 10 % users incentivized to engage daily and the other did not. We compared conditions on engagement and weight loss, and then compared incentivized users and natural high engagers on weight loss. Participants were 46. 3 (SD: 10. 3) years and 89 % female. The incentivized user condition had greater total engagement (p= 0. 0361), but weight loss did not differ (p= 0. 2096). Three natural <b>superusers</b> emerged in each condition. Natural <b>superusers</b> lost more weight than incentivized users (p= 0. 0358). Natural superusers’ posts elicited more comments than incentivized <b>superusers</b> (p= 0. 0107). Incentivized <b>superusers</b> may engage differently than natural <b>superusers.</b> Future studies should explore ways to promote engagement in online interventions...|$|R

As a parallel to [...] "jailbreaking" [...] on iOS devices, root access would enable users to perform tweaks and other changes at the system level that cannot be performed under normal circumstances (such as adding auto-rotation, and installing a custom kernel that restored the aforementioned multitouch support).|$|E
2500|$|... sudo ( [...] or [...] ) is {{a program}} for Unix-like {{computer}} operating systems that allows users to run programs with the security privileges of another user, by default the <b>superuser.</b> It originally stood for [...] "superuser do" [...] as the older versions of sudo were designed to run commands only as the <b>superuser.</b> However, the later versions added support for running commands not only as the <b>superuser</b> but also as other (restricted) users, and thus it is also commonly expanded as [...] "substitute user do". Although the latter case reflects its current functionality more accurately, sudo is still often called [...] "superuser do" [...] since it is so often used for administrative tasks.|$|E

50|$|In computing, the <b>superuser</b> is {{a special}} user account used for system administration. Depending on the {{operating}} system (OS), the actual name of this account might be root, administrator, admin or supervisor. In some cases, the actual name of the account is not the determining factor; on Unix-like systems, for example, the user with a user identifier (UID) of zero is the <b>superuser,</b> regardless {{of the name of}} that account; and in systems which implement a role based security model, any user with the role of <b>superuser</b> (or its synonyms) can carry out all actions of the <b>superuser</b> account.The principle of least privilege recommends that most users and applications run under an ordinary account to perform their work, as a <b>superuser</b> account is capable of making unrestricted, potentially adverse, system-wide changes.|$|E
5000|$|The service {{provides}} ten {{levels of}} [...] "Super User". <b>Superuser</b> status is conferred on users after they apply and perform a special test where users should meet {{quality and quantity}} criteria.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{production}} of health information {{has begun to}} shift from commercial organizations to health care users themselves. People increasingly go online to share their own health and illness experiences and to access information others have posted, but this behavior has not been investigated at a population level in the United Kingdom. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to explore access and {{production of}} user-generated health content among UK Internet users and to investigate relationships between frequency of use and other variables. METHODS: We undertook an online survey of 1000 UK Internet users. Descriptive and multivariate statistical analyses were used to interpret the data. RESULTS: Nearly one-quarter of respondents (23. 7 %, 237 / 1000) reported accessing and sharing user-generated health content online, whereas more than 20 % (22. 2 %, 222 / 1000) were unaware {{that it was possible}} to do this. Respondents could be divided into 3 groups based on frequency of use: rare users (78. 7 %, 612 / 778) who accessed and shared content less than weekly, users (13. 9 %, 108 / 778) who did so weekly, and <b>superusers</b> (7. 5 %, 58 / 778) who did so on a daily basis. <b>Superusers</b> were more likely to be male (P<. 001) and to be employed (P<. 001), but there were no differences between the groups with respect to educational level (P=. 99) or health status (P=. 63). They were more likely to use the Internet for varied purposes such as banking and shopping (P<. 001). CONCLUSIONS: Although this study found reasonably widespread access of user-generated online health content, only a minority of respondents reported doing so frequently. As this type of content proliferates, <b>superusers</b> are likely to shape the health information that others access. Further research should assess the effect of user-generated online content on health outcomes and use of health services by Internet users...|$|R
40|$|Background: Digital health social {{networks}} (DHSNs) are widespread, and {{the consensus is}} that they contribute to wellness by offering social support and knowledge sharing. The success of a DHSN is {{based on the number of}} participants and their consistent creation of externalities through the generation of new content. To promote network growth, it would be helpful to identify characteristics of <b>superusers</b> or actors who create value by generating positive network externalities. Objective: The aim of the study was to investigate the feasibility of developing predictive models that identify potential <b>superusers</b> in real time. This study examined associations between posting behavior, 4 demographic variables, and 20 indication-specific variables. Methods: Data were extracted from the custom structured query language (SQL) databases of 4 digital health behavior change interventions with DHSNs. Of these, 2 were designed to assist in the treatment of addictions (problem drinking and smoking cessation), and 2 for mental health (depressive disorder, panic disorder). To analyze posting behavior, 10 models were developed, and negative binomial regressions were conducted to examine associations between number of posts, and demographic and indication-specific variables. Results: The DHSNs varied in number of days active (3658 - 5210), number of registrants (5049 - 52, 396), number of actors (1085 - 8452), and number of posts (16, 231 - 521, 997). In the sample, all 10 models had low R 2 values (. 013 -. 086) with limited statistically significant demographic and indication-specific variables. Conclusions: Very few variables were associated with social network engagement. Although some variables were statistically significant, they did not appear to be practically significant. Based on the large number of study participants, variation in DHSN theme, and extensive time-period, we did not find strong evidence that demographic characteristics or indication severity sufficiently explain the variability in number of posts per actor. Researchers should investigate alternative models that identify <b>superusers</b> or other individuals who create social network externalities...|$|R

50|$|Access Rights and Authority Levels are {{the rights}} or power granted to users to create, change, delete or view data and files within a system or network. These rights vary from user to user, and {{can range from}} {{anonymous}} login (Guest) privileges to <b>Superuser</b> (root) privileges. Guest and <b>Superuser</b> accounts are the two extremes, as individual access rights can be denied or granted to each user.

50|$|OpenVMS (a.k.a.

OpenVMS also uses a permission scheme {{similar to that of}} Unix, but more complex. There are four categories (System, Owner, Group, and World) and four types of access permissions (Read, Write, Execute and Delete). The categories are not mutually disjoint: World includes Group which in turn includes Owner. The System category independently includes system users (similar to <b>superusers</b> in Unix).|$|R
50|$|Virtualization is {{valuable}} to service providers wishing {{to offer their}} users the ability to have custom configurations and yet keep the overall system easy to maintain.

Jails on the other hand permit software packages to view the system egoistically, as if each package had the machine to itself. Jails can also have their own, independent, jailed <b>superusers.</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract ⎯ There {{are serious}} {{problems}} in the adoption of information technology (IT) for teaching in engineering. Professors hesitate to use IT for teaching: they {{are not familiar with}} the technologies, and know little about the theories and practices around their use. The research is part of an initiative undertaken by a group of early IT adopters to build and share new knowledge related with the use of technology for teaching. The paper presents an innovative approach to accelerate the adoption of IT for teaching and improve its value for transferring knowledge. Three types of technologies are analyzed: intelligent boards, audience response systems and community-based tools for learning. Practices from <b>superusers</b> are captured using ethnographic methods. Members of the community validate these practices through experimentation in a learning laboratory. Then a framework of practices is developed and shared within the community’s knowledge base. Index Terms ⎯ IT in teaching, community of practice, best practices, knowledge portal...|$|R
40|$|Accidental {{overwriting}} {{of files}} or of memory regions belonging to other programs, browsing of personal files by <b>superusers,</b> Trojan horses, and viruses {{are examples of}} breakdowns in workstations and personal computers that would be significantly reduced by memory protection. Memory protection is the capability of an operating system and supporting hardware to delimit segments of memory, to control whether segments can be read from or written into, and to confine accesses of a program to its segments alone. The absence of memory protection in many operating systems today {{is the result of}} a bias toward a narrow definition of performance as maximum instruction-execution rate. A broader definition, including the time to get the job done, makes clear that cost of recovery from memory interference errors reduces expected performance. The mechanisms of memory protection are well understood, powerful, efficient, and elegant. They add to performance in the broad sense without reducing instruction execution rate...|$|R
40|$|Following {{revelations of}} massive {{accounting}} fraud orchestrated by {{the leaders of}} Enron, Tyco, WorldCom, Global Crossing, Xerox, and other companies, the US Congress enacted the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) in 2002 to restore society’s confidence in the financial transparency of publicly traded companies. Among other things, SOX was intended to ensure that future misdeeds by company insiders would leave an electronic trail that could be followed back to the perpetrators of the misdeeds. To ensure {{the existence of this}} trail, SOX requires companies to archive all their routine business records—email, spreadsheets, reports, instant messages—for a multiyear period in a “tamperproof” manner. To provide tamper-resistant storage for business documents, the storage industry rushed to introduce so-called “write-once read-many” (WORM) storage servers, which prevent files from being overwritten during their predeclared retention periods. WORM storage servers provide good protection against tampering attempts by ordinary users and <b>superusers,</b> making them a relatively cost-effective way to improve society’s confidence in the integrity of business records.
