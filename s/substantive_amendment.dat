500|$|Due to the {{difficulty}} in amending the Charter, {{it is unlikely that}} any of these spent provisions will be amended except as part of a package making <b>substantive</b> <b>amendments,</b> such as Security Council reform.

50|$|Central to {{the case}} was an {{amendment}} to the Road Accident Fund. The implementation of the amending legislation was to be staggered by the issuance of a presidential proclamation putting into effect certain amending sections before others. When the President executed on this requirement, however, he selected sections comprising an arbitrary assortment of both administrative and <b>substantive</b> <b>amendments</b> contained in the amending Act. His proclamation, therefore, was on face of it irrational, and the doctrine of objective invalidity rendered it void ab initio. Furthermore, the proclamation issued to correct the errors in the first proclamation was also void.|$|R
50|$|The EPA {{originally}} specified a {{duration of}} one year. Amending acts, passed annually, continued the principal act until 2 September 1946, {{when it was}} allowed to lapse. There were also <b>substantive</b> <b>amendments</b> to the act's provisions; those of 1940 and 1942 increased the emergency powers, while that passed in 1945, as the war was ending, reduced them. The first 1940 amendment extended the power of internment from foreign nationals to Irish citizens, and the second 1940 amendment allowed juryless court martial of civilians. These were in response to increased activity by the Irish Republican Army (IRA); many IRA members were interned, and five were executed by firing squad after courts martial. Media censorship prevented much public backlash at this.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} the first systematic attempt {{to investigate the}} legislative impact of the Scottish Parliament on Executive legislation by analysing the fate of all amendments to Executive bills from the Parliament’s first session (1999 - 2003). Initial findings {{on the success of}} bill amendments show that the balance of power inclines strongly in favour of ministers. However, when we account for type of amendment and initial authorship we find evidence that the Parliament (both coalition and opposition MSPs) actually makes more of an impact, particularly in terms of the level of success of <b>substantive</b> <b>amendments</b> to Executive bills. Findings have implications for much of the current literature that is sceptical of the existence of power sharing between the Executive and the Parliament and within the Parliament...|$|R
5000|$|One {{assertion}} of democratic illegitimacy {{focuses on the}} role of the European Commission in initiating legislation. This criticism has, in turn, been criticised, using comparisons with the situation in national governments where few members' bills are ever debated and [...] "fewer than 15% are ever successfully adopted in any form", while government proposals [...] "generally pass without substantial or <b>substantive</b> <b>amendments</b> from the legislature". [...] The Commission is reestablished every five years. Individual members of the incoming Commission are nominated by national governments and the proposed Commission is (or is not) approved jointly and severally by the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament. Parliament has the power to dismiss the Commission early (and has used that power).|$|R
50|$|As to the {{validity}} of the first proclamation, the court held that section 4, listed in both the first and the second proclamation, belonged to the cluster of the administrative amendments which were listed in the second proclamation. The effect of the first proclamation was literally to put into operation an arbitrary selection of one of the administrative amendments (section 4) and four of the <b>substantive</b> <b>amendments</b> (sections 6, 10, 11 and 12) made by the Amendment Act. Because it was based on an arbitrary selection, it followed that the first proclamation was objectively irrational. Under the doctrine of objective invalidity, the first proclamation was a nullity from the outset. It was invalid and void ab initio, and therefore had no effect in law. Furthermore, if the first proclamation remained in effect, it would create a number of legal and practical problems.|$|R

40|$|This article {{traces the}} history of the {{wholesale}} revision of Montana 2 ̆ 7 s evidence rules that stemmed from a corresponding changes in the Federal Rules of Evidence (FRE) in 1975. The article begins discussion with the appointment of the Montana Supreme Court Commission on the Rules of Evidence in 1974 and continues to the adoption of the new Montana Rules of Evidence (MRE) effective January 1977. The author points out that the current version of the MRE is substantively identical to the 1977 version. By contrast the FRE has gone through twenty separate, <b>substantive</b> <b>amendments.</b> The author suggests that the drastic difference in pace of change may have erected gaps between the two systems and thus {{it may be time to}} conduct a line-by-line review of the MRE to bring it back into conformity with the current FRE...|$|R

40|$|This report {{provides}} an overview of federal whistleblower and anti-retaliation laws. In general, these laws protect employees who report misconduct by their employers or who engage in various protected activities, such as participating in an investigation or filing a complaint. In recent years, Congress has expanded employee protections for a variety of private-sector workers. Eleven of the forty laws reviewed in this report were enacted after 1999. Among these laws are the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act, and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The report focuses on key aspects of the federal whistleblower and anti-retaliation laws. For each law, the report summarizes the activities that are protected, how the law’s protections are enforced, whether the law provides a private right of action, the remedies prescribed by the law, and the year the law’s whistleblower or anti-retaliation provisions were adopted and amended. With regard to amendment dates, the report identifies only dates associated with <b>substantive</b> <b>amendments.</b> For enactments after 2001, the report provides information on congressional sponsorship and votes...|$|R
40|$|The burgeoning of new {{technology}} such as semiconductor chips, computer software, genetic engineering, pharmaceuticals and other chemical processes raises important international trade issues {{for the protection of}} intellectual property rights. Inadequate protection has left the door open for pirating and counterfeiting. Section 337 of the United States Tariff Act of 1930 (2 ̆ 2 Section 3372 ̆ 2) protects intellectual property rights from international pirating and counterfeiting. It provides a mechanism for excluding fringing imports from the United States marketplace. In Re United States Litigation between E. I. Dupont de Nemours 2 ̆ 6 Co. and Akzo N. V., the EC Commission determined that the procedure followed under Section 337 contradicts Article III of GATT and is an illicit commercial practice by the United States Government. Contrary to the EC Commission 2 ̆ 7 s determination, Section 337 does not conflict with the United States obligations under Article III of GATT. Nor do the <b>substantive</b> <b>amendments</b> to Section 337 by the Omnibus Trade Act create a conflict with Article III of GATT...|$|R
40|$|Intensional Contexts, " Dorit Abusch sets herself {{two very}} ambitious goals {{that have not}} been {{attained}} in previous literature. One of these goals is to give a unified syntactic and semantic treatment of the past tense in English which can cope with the puzzling fact that most, but not all, occurrences of past tense convey a meaning of anteriority. The other goal is to deduce the peculiar meaning of present tense complements in past tense attitude reports from independently motivated principles. As far as I can see, she has succeeded on both counts, thus setting a new standard for subsequent work on the topic. I have little to offer in the way of <b>substantive</b> <b>amendments</b> or criticisms. The following pages primarily report my attempt to provide more concrete formulations for some of the sketchier portions of Abusch's proposal. 1. Preliminaries To get started, let me fix some basic assumptions about the LF-syntax and semantics of tensed sentences. Abusch appeals to an analogy between tenses and pronouns, which suggests a treatment of the tenses as variables: their LF-representations carry numerical indices, and they have semantic values dependent on a variable assignmen...|$|R
