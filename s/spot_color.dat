It is the only Metro-North line used exclusively by that carrier (no use by Amtrak, though CSX services freight customers as far north as Mount Vernon) and the only one that uses the entirety of existing track. Metro-North has assigned it the color code blue, used as trim on station signs and <b>spot</b> <b>color</b> on printed timetables. The blue color-coding appears to have started with timetables issued by predecessor New York Central as far back as 1965.|$|E
25|$|Each {{section is}} denoted {{by a certain}} color to {{differentiate}} sections beyond lettering and is seen in a box the top-left corner of the first page; the principal section colors are blue for News (section A), green for Money (section B), red for Sports (section C), and purple for Life (section D); in the paper's early years, the Life and Money sections were also assigned blue nameplates and <b>spot</b> <b>color,</b> as the presses used at USA Today printing facilities did not yet accommodate the use of other colors to denote all four original sections. Orange is used for bonus sections (section E or above), which are published occasionally such as for business travel trends and the Olympics; other bonus sections for sports (such as for the PGA Tour preview, NCAA Basketball Tournaments, Memorial Day auto races (Indianapolis 500 and Coca-Cola 600), NFL opening weekend and the Super Bowl) previously used the orange color, but now use the red designated for sports in their bonus sections. To increase their ties to USA Today, Gannett incorporated the USA Today coloring scheme into an internally created graphics package for news programming that the company began phasing in across its television station group – which were spun-off in July 2015 into the separate broadcast and digital media company Tegna – in late 2012 (the package utilizes the color scheme for a rundown graphic used on most stations – outside of those that Gannett acquired in 2014 from London Broadcasting, which began implementing the package in late 2015 – that persists throughout its stations' newscasts, as well as bumpers for individual story topics). Gannett's television stations began to a new on-air appearance that uses a color-coding system identical {{to that of the}} paper.|$|E
40|$|AbstractUnderstanding the {{influence}} of UV varnishing on diversified tonality <b>spot</b> <b>colors</b> is significant in offset printing process. Versatility of various <b>spot</b> <b>colors</b> implies repeatability and correct reproduction. UV varnishing methods, besides enhancing the visual impact on the product, have a protective role, but due to the effect on different wavelengths <b>spot</b> <b>colors</b> can cause negative colorimetric changes. The research examined the impact of UV varnishing methods on printed <b>spot</b> <b>colors</b> on diverse printing substrates. The degree of change on prints caused by UV varnish was determined using spectrophotometric and densitometric methods. Research results are clearly showing the modality and the extent UV varnishing method causes on <b>spot</b> <b>colors.</b> This paper presents objective conclusions that help predict possible variations in <b>spot</b> <b>colors,</b> as well as limit values of colorimetric deviations that may {{affect the quality of}} the reproduction process...|$|R
50|$|A major {{exception}} to this rule should be applied when opaque <b>spot</b> <b>colors</b> are used. Other colors, regardless of the relative luminance, should always be trapped to (spread under) these <b>spot</b> <b>colors.</b> If several of these <b>spot</b> <b>colors</b> are used (a common practice in the packaging market), {{it is not the}} luminance of the color but the order of printing that will be the decisive element: the first color to be printed should always spread under the next color.|$|R
50|$|High quality {{business}} cards without full-color photographs are normally printed using <b>spot</b> <b>colors</b> on sheet-fed offset printing presses. Some companies have {{gone so far}} as to trademark their <b>spot</b> <b>colors</b> (examples are UPS brown, Los Angeles Lakers' purple, and Tide's orange). If a business card logo is a single color and the type is another color, the process is considered two-color. More <b>spot</b> <b>colors</b> can be added depending on the needs of the card. With the onset of digital printing, and batch printing, it is now cost effective to print {{business cards}} in full color.|$|R
2500|$|Gannett {{formally}} {{announced the}} launch of the paper on April 20, 1982. USA Today began publishing on September 15, 1982, initially launching in the Baltimore and Washington, D.C. metropolitan areas for an initial newsstand price of 25¢ (equivalent to ¢ today). After selling out its first issue, Gannett gradually expanded the national distribution of the paper, eventually reaching an estimated circulation of 362,879 copies, double the amount of copy sales that Gannett projected that USA Today would accrue by the end of 1982. The design was unique in its incorporation of colorized graphics and photographs; initially, only its front news section pages were rendered in four-color, while the remaining pages were displayed in a <b>spot</b> <b>color</b> format. The paper's overall content style and elevated use of graphics – the result of the concept developed by Neuharth, in contribution with staff graphics designers George Rorick, Sam Ward, Suzy Parker, John Sherlock and Web Bryant – was derided by critics, who referred to it as [...] "McPaper" [...] or [...] "television you can wrap fish in," [...] because it opted to incorporate more concise, shorter-form nuggets of information akin to the style of television news rather than in-depth stories in many of its sections like traditional newspapers, which many in the newspaper industry considered to be a dumbing down of the news. Although, USA Today has been in profit for ten years; it has changed the appearance and feel of most newspapers in the United States and around the world.|$|E
50|$|When {{making a}} multi-color print with a <b>spot</b> <b>color</b> process, every <b>spot</b> <b>color</b> needs its own lithographic film. All {{the areas of}} the same <b>spot</b> <b>color</b> are printed using the same film, hence, using the same lithographic plate. The dot gain, hence the screen angle and line frequency, of a <b>spot</b> <b>color</b> vary {{according}} to its intended purpose. Spot lamination and UV coatings are sometimes referred to as 'spot colors', as they share the characteristics of requiring a separate lithographic film and print run.|$|E

40|$|Special color {{matches in}} the {{printing}} industry {{have been done}} by subjective means ever since the first colored ink was put in a printing press. Special, or <b>spot</b> <b>colors</b> are colors that are printed individually rather than being “built ” from other colors. One of the drawbacks to this subjective method of color matching is that all individuals see color differently. Therefore, {{it makes sense that}} a quantitative, or objective, method of measuring <b>spot</b> <b>colors</b> could only improve the overall matches of these types of colors. While there has been an objective means of measuring <b>spot</b> <b>colors</b> in place since the mid 1970 ’s, many printers have been reluctant to utilize it for a variety of reasons. One of the reasons for this reluctance is the high cost of the instrumentation required toiii measure color. Another reason is that the L*a*b * color mapping model appears, on the surface, to be somewhat complicated. The L*a*b * color model maps colors on a three dimensional Cartesian coordinate system. Although there are several types of color mapping systems, the L*a*b * model is generally preferred for matching <b>spot</b> <b>colors.</b> The measurements for this model are taken with an instrument called a Colorimeter.
