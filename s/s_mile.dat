Following a {{fatiguing}} muscle contraction, motor evoked potentials (MEPs) {{evoked by}} transcranial magnetic brain stimulation remain depressed for many minutes, reflecting {{a reduction in}} the excitability of the corticospinal projection. No functional significance has been linked to this observation. We postulated that dexterity would be affected when MEPs are depressed. MEPs were recorded from the first dorsal interosseous muscle of 11 healthy subjects in resting muscles before and after a fatiguing maximum voluntary contraction. This induced significant MEP depression in all subjects. No change in dexterity was seen when MEPs were depressed or at any time point throughout the experiment. We conclude that fatigue-induced MEP depression is not associated with a decline in dexterity. Joanna P. Lazarski, Michael C. Ridding, and Timothy <b>S.</b> <b>Mile...</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{definitive}} version may {{be found}} at www. wiley. comNormal physiological tremor of the jaw has a frequency of 6 to 8 Hz. A patient is described with jaw tremor at frequencies of 12 Hz during jaw movement and 15 Hz when the jaw was relaxed. The 15 Hz tremor was driven by synchronous, bilateral bursts of activity in the temporalis and masseter muscles, which alternated with digastric bursts. Coherence analysis indicated the tremor was highly correlated with both opening and closing muscle activity, and that the opening and closing muscles were about 180 degrees out of phase. The existence of two tremors with different, nonphysiological peak frequencies {{and the influence of}} attention, relaxation, and movement in switching from one tremor frequency to the other, suggest that more than one generator may be operating.

A {{simple and}} {{inexpensive}} method for recording vertical {{movements of the}} human mandible relative to the maxilla is presented. Measurements are made from accelerometers and a Hall-effect device temporarily glued to {{the upper and lower}} anterior teeth. The accelerometer signals are integrated once to give velocity and a second time to give position. Movements of the mandible relative to the maxilla are obtained by integrating {{the difference between the two}} accelerometer signals. The (relative) velocity and position records derived in this way are linear, but subject to drift when the jaw is stationary. Steady mandibular position is obtained from the Hall-effect system, but this signal must be corrected for its inherent non-linearity. This device can record rapid movements of the mandible even when the head is unrestrained, and interferes minimally with normal jaw movements. Stanley C. Flavel, Michael A.

The aim {{of this study was to}} determine whether this association is coincident, or whether pain affects dexterity directly. In the first part of the study, several tests of dexterity based on pegboard skills were compared with a precision-grip-lift task: the correlations between the results of any of these tests were not significant at the 0. 01 level. Nineteen subjects were then tested with a modified Purdue pegboard test and the precision grip-lift task, both without pain and during pain induced by injection of 5 % hypertonic saline into the first dorsal interosseous muscle of the non-dominant hand. There was no significant difference in the performance of either task when the muscle was painful, indicating that acute experimental muscle pain does not affect dexterity. Rebekah Smith, Sophie L.

40|$|The {{original}} publication can {{be found}} at www. springerlink. comCortical representation maps derived by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) are often used, inter alia, in studying the plasticity of the brain. Parameters such as map area, map volume, optimal stimulation site and centre of gravity are commonly used to quantify changes in the topography of the motor cortex. However, reports on the stability of these parameters over time has not been conclusive. In the present study, the areas of the scalp from which responses were evoked from corticospinal cells projecting to three intrinsic hand muscles were systematically mapped with TMS at intervals of 24 hours, one week and two weeks from eight normal subjects. The area, "volume" and centre of gravity of these maps did not change significantly over this period. It is concluded that mapping with TMS is suitable for studies which aim to study the effect of various interventions on the cortical representation of individual muscles in human subjects.

40|$|Copyright © 2002 the American Physiological SocietyWe {{aimed to}} {{determine}} whether postexercise depression of motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) could be demonstrated without voluntary muscle activation in humans. Voluntary fatigue was induced with a 2 -min maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) of the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle. On another occasion, "electrical fatigue" was induced with trains of shocks delivered for 2 min over the FDI motor point. Five of the twelve subjects also underwent "sequential fatigue" consisting of a 2 -min MVC of FDI followed by 20 min of rest and then 2 min of motor point stimulation. Voluntary fatigue induced MEP depression that persisted for at least 20 min. Electrical fatigue induced a transient MEP facilitation that subsided 20 min after the stimulation and became depressed within 30 min. Thus MEP depression can be induced by both voluntary and electrical fatigue. With electrical fatigue, the initial depression is "masked" by transient MEP facilitation, reflecting cortical plasticity induced by the prolonged electrical stimulation. MEP depression probably reflects tonic afferent input from the exercising muscle that alters cortical excitability without altering spinal excitability. Julia B.

The normal human motor cortex {{can be made to}} reorganize by repeated stimulation of proprioceptive inputs, with or without concurrent stimulation of the motor cortex by transcranial magnetic nerve stimulation.

We have shown that repeated stimulation on several successive days causes this ‘plastic’ reorganization to persist for at least several days. We have also used this approach to determine whether increases in the excitability of the motor cortex can be induced in stroke patients (in whom cortical excitability is usually depressed) and whether this is accompanied by functional changes. 3. The results of these studies were mixed but, in patients in whom plastic changes were induced, there were improvements and sometimes marked improvements in both motor function and some electrophysiological parameters. The reasons for the inconsistent results are not clear, but do not appear to relate to the site, size or nature of the lesion. Timothy <b>S</b> <b>Mile...</b>|$|E

This study {{assessed}} {{the reliability of}} alternate methods of analysis of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). We recorded two sets of MEPs (Time 1 and Time 2) at the optimal scalp sites for both the right first dorsal interosseous (FDI) and flexor carpi ulnaris (FCU) at two different stimulation intensities in 10 healthy subjects. MEP magnitude was determined {{in each of the}} following three ways: the mean peak-to-peak amplitude and area of the 20 individual responses; the amplitude and area of the ensemble averaged waveform; and the amplitude and area of the maximal response. There {{was no significant difference in}} amplitude or area for either muscle using any of the three methods between Time 1 and 2. However, the ensemble average (area and amplitude) was significantly smaller that the mean MEP, and the maximal MEP amplitude was significantly larger. Intraclass correlation analysis demonstrated that reliability of MEP measures over time was poor regardless of method. Reliability was similar between methods for FDI, but FCU had lower reliability values for the mean and ensemble average methods than the maximal method. Michelle N. McDonnell, Michael C.

This study {{sought to}} {{determine}} whether prolonged peripheral nerve stimulation was effective in inducing persistent "plastic" changes in the excitability of the human motor cortex. The amplitude of the electromyographic response evoked in resting intrinsic hand muscles by focal transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was taken as an index of motor cortical excitability. Twelve subjects were stimulated with each of three protocols, {{one of which was}} given on each of three separate occasions. The protocols consisted of various schedules of electrical stimulation of the radial and ulnar nerves or the motor point of the first dorsal interosseous muscle (FDI), or stimulation of FDI motor point paired with low-frequency TMS. Amplitudes of TMS-elicited motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were measured before peripheral stimulation and for 2 h after stimulation. The data from one subject were unusable. In every other subject, all three protocols induced a prolonged, significant facilitation of MEPs in {{at least some of the}} three intrinsic hand muscles used. In some instances, MEPs were not enlarged and occasionally were significantly depressed. Different protocols based on peripheral afferent stimulation can induce plastic changes in the organisation of the motor cortex that persist for at least 2 h. C. Shona Charlton, Michael C.

40|$|Copyright © 2002 The Physiological Society The {{definitive}} {{version is}} available at www. blackwell-synergy. comStimulus-response curves for motor evoked potentials (MEPs) induced in a hand muscle by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) were constructed for 42 subjects {{with the aim of}} identifying differences related to age and sex. There was no effect of age on the resting threshold to TMS, the maximal amplitude of the MEP that could be evoked (MEPmax) or the maximal slope of the stimulus-response curve. However, higher stimulus intensities were required to achieve both MEPmax and the maximal slope in the older subjects. The trial-to-trial variability of MEPs was greater in the older subjects, particularly at intensities near threshold. There was a significant interaction between age, threshold and trial-to-trial variability of MEP amplitude. Overall, MEP variability fell markedly as stimulus intensity increased above threshold but less rapidly in older than in younger subjects. Females tended to have larger MEP variability than males, but age and threshold were much stronger modulators than sex. These differences in input-output characteristics are likely to be due either to a decreased number of spinal motoneurones being activated synchronously in older subjects, or to the activation of the same number of motoneurones in a less synchronous manner, leading to phase cancellation in the surface electromyogram.

40|$|The {{original}} publication can {{be found}} at www. springerlink. comMotor learning must involve changes in the organisation of the brain, and it seems axiomatic that afferent signals generated during repeated motor practice contribute to this. In this study, motor-point stimulation of the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle was paired with transcranial magnetic stimulation of the human motor cortex on three successive days to determine whether repeated stimulation sessions result in enduring reorganisation of the motor cortex. This repeated “dual” stimulation induced significant changes in the excitability of the motor cortex together with expansion of the area of scalp from which these responses were elicited. The expansion in muscle representation was accompanied by large movements in the centre of gravity (CoG), suggesting a true reorganisation of the underlying cortical representational zone. The changes persisted for at least 2 days following the last stimulation session. It is concluded that repeated dual stimulation is capable of inducing long-lasting reorganisation within the motor cortex. These changes may be similar in nature to those seen in the motor cortex during motor learning. Moreover, these observations suggest that {{it may be possible to}} induce the motor cortex of patients who have suffered strokes to reorganise in a way that improves the voluntary control of the weakened muscles.

40|$|Copyright © 2002 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved. Magnetic {{stimulation}} of sensorimotor cortex {{interferes with the}} detection of electro-cutaneous stimulation. However, it is uncertain whether this interference is due to activation of the somatosensory or the motor cortex. Here, transcranial magnetic stimuli (TMS) were delivered separately over somatosensory and motor cortex contralateral to the right ulnar nerve in 12 subjects. In separate trials, TMS were given 100 ms before and 20 ms after 60 ms trains of electro-cutaneous ulnar nerve stimuli, and their effect on the subjective perception of peripheral stimuli was assessed. TMS of both motor and somatosensory cortex interfered with the perception of afferent stimuli when given before or after {{stimulation of}} the ulnar nerve. Perception was more strongly suppressed by motor cortex stimulation than by somatosensory cortex stimulation, when given {{before or after the}} peripheral stimulus. A similar proportion of errors was induced by sensory cortex stimulation between the two stimulus timing intervals. This study suggests that the inhibition of the afferent volley is unlikely {{to be the result of}} antidromic activation of thalamocortical connections or corticospinal gating. A phenomenon akin to sensory masking is the most plausible explanation for much of the suppression of sensory perception by stimulation of the motor or somatosensory cortex. The more powerful suppressive effect of motor cortex stimulation may be due to multiple mechanisms. Darrin R. McKay, Michael C. Ridding, and Timothy <b>S.</b> <b>Mile...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{definitive}} {{version is}} available at www. blackwell-synergy. comSpectral analysis of jaw acceleration confirmed that the human mandible ‘trembles’ at a peak frequency around 6 Hz when held in its rest position and at other stationary jaw openings. The 6 Hz tremor increased during very slow movements of the mandible, but other lower-frequency peaks became prominent during more rapid jaw movements. These lower-frequency peaks {{are likely to be}} the result of asymmetries in the underlying, voluntarily produced, ‘saw-tooth’ movements. In comparison, finger tremor at rest and during slow voluntary movements had a mean peak frequency of about 8 Hz: this frequency did not change during rhythmical finger flexion and extension movements, but the power of the tremor increased non-linearly with the speed of the movement. The resting jaw tremor was weakly coherent with the activity of the masseter and digastric muscles at the tremor frequency in about half the subjects, but was more strongly coherent during voluntary movements in all subjects. The masseter activity was at least 150 deg out of phase with the digastric activity at the tremor frequency (and at all frequencies from 2. 5 – 15 Hz). The alternating pattern of activity in antagonistic muscles at rest and during slow voluntary movements supports the idea that the masticatory system is subject to pulsatile control in a manner analogous to that seen in the finger.

Movements of {{the head}} and of the {{mandible}} relative to the head were measured in human subjects walking and running on a treadmill at various speeds and inclinations. A miniature magnet and piezo-electric accelerometer assembly was mounted on the mandibular incisors, and a Hall-effect sensor along with a second accelerometer mounted on a maxillary incisor along a common vertical axis. Signals from these sensors provided continuous records of vertical head and mandible acceleration, and relative jaw position. Landing on the heel or on the toe in different forms of locomotion was followed by rapid deceleration of the downward movement {{of the head}} and slightly less rapid deceleration of the downward movement of the mandible, i. e., the mandible moved downwards relative to the maxilla, then upwards again to near its normal posture within 200 ms. No tooth contact occurred in any forms of gait at any inclination. The movement of the mandible relative to the maxilla depended on the nature and velocity of the locomotion and their effects on head deceleration. The least deceleration and hence mandibular displacement occurred during toe-landing, for example, during "uphill" running. The maximum displacement of the mandible relative to the head was less than 1 mm, even at the fastest running speed. The mechanisms that limit the vertical movements of the jaw within such a narrow range are not known, but are likely to include passive soft-tissue visco-elasticity and stretch reflexes in the jaw-closing muscles.

40|$|The {{original}} publication can {{be found}} at www. springerlink. comIn the present study, we examined the electromyogram (EMG) patterns of the soleus and medial gastrocnemius (MG) muscles during rhythmical, two-legged hopping to investigate the contributions of the monosynaptic short- and long-latency stretch reflexes during such a natural movement in human. During rhythmical hopping, soleus muscle is activated reflexly at near-monosynaptic latency by stretch resulting from passive ankle flexion upon landing. Soleus muscle also contracts voluntarily in order to launch the body into the next hop. This is part of the rhythmical bursts of activity producing the hops. Depending on the hopping interval, this phase of activation can follow the short-latency phase or precede landing at very short hopping intervals. In MG, there is an initial phase of activity that stiffens the muscle in preparation for landing, and continues through the contact phase. The monosynaptic reflex response to landing is usually superimposed on this activity. Depending on the hopping interval, both of these responses may be overlaid with activity that is time-locked to the take-off into the next hop, and serves to launch the body into the next hop. However, no evidence for a long-latency stretch reflex was found. In addition, the preferred hopping frequency for all subjects was about 2 Hz. This frequency is associated with a pattern of EMG activity the timing of which indicates that it balances the requirement for a comfortable landing from a hop with the optimal muscle activation required for launching the following hop.

40|$|The {{original}} publication can {{be found}} at www. springerlink. comResting tremor is seen in both the limbs and in the trigeminal motor system. These rhythmical perturbations are the result of alternating activation of antagonistic muscles, and these increase in amplitude during slow, voluntary movements. In the present study, we examined the effect of experimental muscle pain on finger and jaw tremor. The tremor in the mandible and in the middle finger was measured on separate occasions, at rest and during two constant-velocity movements. Pain was then induced by the infusion of hypertonic saline into a jaw-closing muscle (masseter) or into a finger extensor muscle (extensor digitorum longus, EDL). During masseter pain, the power at the peak tremor frequency of the mandible decreased significantly both when the jaw was at rest and during voluntary jaw movements at two velocities. In contrast, pain in EDL resulted in {{a significant increase in the}} power of finger tremor only during the two speeds of voluntary movement. No change in the peak tremor frequency was seen in either the finger or the jaw during pain. The most likely explanation for these data is that muscle pain tonically modulates the amplitude of the outputs from the central "pulsatile control" generators that drive the alternating activation of antagonistic muscles which produce tremor at rest and during movements. This modulation is in the opposite direction for systems controlling jaw and hand, suggesting a specific interaction of the nociceptive afferents with separate central oscillators.
