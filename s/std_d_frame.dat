40|$|A feeding {{experiment}} {{was conducted on}} the pelagic stages of the tropical goatfish Upeneus tragula (family Mullidae) to examine how food quantity affects growth characteristics and potential success at settlement. Pelagic goatfish were collected from aggregation rafts 3 nautical miles west of Lizard Island on the northern Great Barrier Reef during December 1990. Three tanks in each of four feeding regimes were stocked with 25 pelagic goatfish between 20 and 23 mm standard length (SL). The four feeding regimes were: fed ad lib. (fed) : fed once per day (f 1 pd); starved every second day (stld); starved for 3 <b>d</b> and re-fed (<b>st</b> 3 <b>d).</b> Fishes were fed 36 to 48 h old Artemia sp. nauplii (Ocean Star strain). Fish were removed from tanks when they underwent metamorphosis, changed pigmentation and settled {{to the bottom of the}} tanks. Morphology, muscle development, time taken to settle and biochemical condition were examined. Growth attributes of the treated fish were compared to fish which settled within 24 h of capture (field). All attributes examined were significantly influenced by the feeding treatments. Fish within the fed and <b>st</b> 3 <b>d</b> treatments were significantly larger and heavier than fish in the less well-fed treatments (f 1 pd, <b>st</b> 1 <b>d).</b> Similarly, concentrations of total lipid, carbohydrate and protein in the settled fish were significantly higher in the fed and <b>st</b> 3 <b>d</b> treatments compared with the <b>st</b> 1 <b>d</b> and f 1 pd treatments. For all these morphological and biochemical attributes the <b>st</b> 1 <b>d</b> and f 1 pd fish did not significantly differ from the field fishes, but did differ from the fed and <b>st</b> 3 <b>d</b> fishes. Water content was significantly higher in the f 1 pd, <b>st</b> 1 <b>d</b> and field fishes compared with the fed and <b>st</b> 3 <b>d</b> fish. Furthermore, the average time taken to settle followed the pattern: fed (14 d) <st 3 d (16 d) <st 1 d (22 d) <f 1 pd (24 d). Muscle development mirrored the patterns in fish length between treatments, being more developed in the fed treatment and least well developed in the <b>st</b> 1 <b>d</b> treatment. Feeding rate differed significantly between treatments and changed through the experiment for all but the fed treatment. Feeding rate decreased slightly for the f 1 pd and <b>st</b> 1 <b>d</b> treatments over the experimental period, but increased rapidly for the <b>st</b> 3 <b>d</b> treatment. The experiment suggests that U. tragula are physiologically well suited to exploiting a patchy food source, and that food availability within the pelagic stages can have a major influence on the growth characteristics of this reef fish at settlement. The ramifications of this finding are discussed in relation to survival and success once fish have recruited to the reef population...|$|R

40|$|ObjectiveTo {{investigate}} the curative {{effect of the}} self-made mechanical vibration massage instrument for treatment of brachial plexus injury in rats and to explore its mechanism. MethodsBrachial plexus injury models were made in 144 Wistar rats and one week after natural healing of the wound, they were randomly divided into 3 groups, mechanical vibration treatment group (MV group), nerve growth factor treatment group (NGF group) and model group, 48 rats in each group. Then again, the each group was randomly divided into 4 subgroups, 7 -day group, 14 -day group, 21 -day group and 28 -day group, 12 rats in each subgroup. The MV group were treated by mechanical vibration at acupoints on three-yang and three-yin channels of the hand with the mechanical vibration massage instrument; The NGF group were treated with injection of NGF into musculus pectoralis major on the affected side; And the model group were normally fed with no treatment. After treatment for 7, 14, 21 and 28 days, the diameter of both forelimbs were measured, the electrophysiological examination on the brachial plexus in vitro and the ultrastructure observation with electron microscope on the affected side were carried out, the motor nerve conduction velocity (MNCV) and motor nerve action potential (MNAP) of the brachial plexus on the affected side, NGF content of submaxillary gland as well as muscular Na+, K+-ATPase activity were determined respectively. ResultsThe different rates of the forelimb diameter in the MV group and the NGV group on the 14 th <b>d,</b> 21 <b>st</b> <b>d</b> and 28 th d were better {{than those in the}} model group (P< 0. 05 or P< 0. 001), and in the MV group were better than those in the NGF group on the 21 <b>st</b> <b>d</b> and the 28 th d (P< 0. 05). MNCV in the MV group and the NGV group on the 21 <b>st</b> <b>d</b> and 28 th d was better than that in the model group (P< 0. 05 or P< 0. 001), and in the MV group was better than that in the NGF group on the 28 th d (P< 0. 05). MNAP in the MV group and the NGV group on the 14 th <b>d,</b> 21 <b>st</b> <b>d</b> and 28 th d was better than that in the model group (P< 0. 05 or P< 0. 001), and in the MV group was better than that in the NGF group on the 21 <b>st</b> <b>d</b> and 28 th d (P< 0. 05). The NGF mean gray index of submaxillary gland in the model group was higher than that in the MV group and the NGF group on the 7 th d (P< 0. 05); in the NGF group and the model group was higher than that in the MV group on the 14 th d (P< 0. 05); and in the NGF group and the MV group was higher than that in the model group on the 21 <b>st</b> <b>d</b> and 28 th d (P< 0. 05). Na+, K+-ATPase activity in the model group and the MV group was higher than that in the NGF group (P< 0. 05) on the 14 th d, and in the MV group was higher than that in the model group on the 28 th d (P< 0. 05). ConclusionAs compared with the NGF group and the model group, mechanical vibration treatment can effectively accelerate repair of injured brachial plexus, slow down atrophy of skeletal muscle, and promote secretion of NGF in submaxillary gland...|$|R
