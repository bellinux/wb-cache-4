2500|$|Sir Edward O'Brien Pryce, Prisoners of the King's Bench, Surrey, T. Neuman, 1812, [...] {{approached}} authorities {{the day of}} Despard's arrest {{to offer}} evidence against Despard. [...] Pryce claimed that through notes, Despard had offered him unlimited sums of money in exchange for advice on making underground bombs. [...] Despard, it was alleged, had sent him a diagram of boxes with <b>spring</b> <b>locks</b> containing three powder barrels surrounded by balls and metal spikes. [...] These were to be buried under the road and detonated by connecting wire. [...] Bombs were {{to be placed in}} three locations: the road to Windsor Castle, between Buckingham House and Hyde Park gate, and an exit of Buckingham House, opposite the gate into the lower part of Green Park.|$|E
60|$|Were {{the locks}} that ‘chekit to’ <b>spring</b> <b>locks,</b> and was James unaware {{that he was}} locked in? But Ramsay, before the affray, had wandered into ‘a gallery, very fair,’ and unless there were two galleries, he could not do this, if the gallery door was locked. Lennox and Mar and the rest speak of {{opposition}} from only one door.|$|E
60|$|While {{we cannot}} explain these things, that door, at least, between the gallery and the gallery chamber, {{excluded}} James {{from most of}} his friends. Can the reader believe that he purposely had that door locked, we know not how, or by whom, on the system of compelling Gowrie to ‘come and be killed’ {{by way of the}} narrow staircase? Could we see Gowrie House, and its ‘secret ways,’ as it then was, we might understand this problem of the locked doors. Contemporary criticism, as minutely recorded by Calderwood, found no fault with the number of locked doors, but only asked ‘how could the King’s fear but increase, perceiving Mr. Alexander’ (the Master) ‘ever to lock the doors behind them?’ If the doors closed with <b>spring</b> <b>locks</b> (of which the principle had long been understood and used), the King may not have been aware of the locking. The problem cannot be solved; we only disbelieve that the King himself had the door locked, to keep his friends out, and let Gowrie in.|$|E

5000|$|The Day Utility was an {{automobile}} manufactured in Detroit, Michigan by the Day Automobile Company from 1911-14. The Day used a four-cylinder, [...] engine and shaft drive. Removal {{of the rear}} seat and doors allowed the car to be converted from a five-seater touring car to a light truck in one minute. As a truck, the Day was able to carry up to 1000 lb in a 36 in by 96 in cargo space. The rear seat could be lifted away by triggering two <b>spring</b> <b>locks.</b> The Day had an advertised price of $950US.|$|E
50|$|Jason runs off, {{intending}} {{to be rescued}} by Carlton, and Charlie, John, Lamar, Jessica and Marla who break into the restaurant to find him. Finding Carlton, Charlie undoes the <b>spring</b> <b>locks</b> and frees him from the costume. As they search for a way out, the four robots come to life and pursue them through the restaurant. William reveals that the robots are possessed by the vengeful ghosts of his victims, and boasts that they will hunt down and kill any intruders. The group tries to hide in a party room, but all four robots corner them. However, they are halted {{by the arrival of}} a fifth robot, the yellow Freddy from Fredbear's Family Diner, which Charlie realizes is possessed by Michael's ghost. It was then that they realized the animatronics were trying to defend them from William Afton. The yellow Freddy grants them permission to leave, and Chief Burke arrives to search for the missing Officer Dunn. William attacks in the yellow Bonnie costume, but Charlie activates its <b>spring</b> <b>locks,</b> killing him. As the robots drag William's corpse away, Chief Burke escorts everyone out of the mall. The friends go their separate ways the next morning, and before leaving Hurricane, Charlie visits her father's grave, remembering a happy day she had with him when she was a child.|$|E
50|$|The {{bulk of the}} {{gameplay}} in Five Nights at Freddy's: Sister Location does {{away with}} the survival aspect of previous games. Instead of remaining {{in one place and}} preventing the animatronic antagonists from attacking, the player must move from room to room in order to fulfill a series of objectives that change during each of the five nights. For example, Night 2 requires the player to sneak across Ballora Gallery and reset a group of circuit breakers, while for Night 4, the player is placed inside a springlock suit and must keep its <b>spring</b> <b>locks</b> wound up while shaking off the animatronic dolls (Minireenas) that climb onto it.|$|E

5000|$|Multi-Cube: It is a {{peripheral}} device for Mister Miracle's Mother Box. The cube {{was designed by}} Mister Miracle to use the transmutation power of the Mother Box to create a number of preset mechanisms in its interior. All of these functions are much easier to perform than improvised transmutation. They can be activated in stressful situations. The cube is small enough to be hidden {{in the palm of}} the hand. The multi-cube is not sentient but is still capable of interpreting complex commands and recording data. The multi-cube can fly under its own power and follow the mental commands of Mister Miracle. The cube can use the transmuting power of the Mother Box to create several hundred feet of swing line. Besides the cable, the cube can produce a smoke screen or fire suppression foam. The simplest use of the cube is to generate light effects. The cube can create lifelike holograms, a blinding flash or a laser capable of cutting through a steel cable or handcuff links. In hologram mode the cube can record extended scenes or make a complete holographic recording. It can then manipulate the playback to simulate the subject in motion. The cube can emit a powerful sonic beam that can <b>spring</b> <b>locks</b> or shatter a brick wall. The sound blast can stun an unprotected human.|$|E
5000|$|As {{the week}} passes, the {{animatronics}} {{are taken to}} the Parts and Service room one by one due to apparent malfunction, later {{to be taken to}} the [...] "scooping room". On the first night, Mike is instructed to see if Ballora, Foxy, and Circus Baby are working properly by shocking them, in which Foxy and Circus Baby require two shocks to get them to work (although Circus Baby never reveals herself despite being shocked twice). On the second night, Mike is tasked to move a panel under a desk to feud off the Bidybabs, travel to the breaker room while avoiding Ballora, and repairing the machinery while avoiding Freddy. On the third night, Handunit sends Mike to the Parts and Services Room (avoiding Foxy along the way) and is ordered to perform maintenance on Freddy while avoiding Bonnie. At {{the end of the third}} night, Foxy ambushes Mike and Circus Baby reveals that she kidnapped him and the fourth night, hides him in a spring lock suit just outside the [...] "scooping room", where the animatronics' endoskeletons are forcibly removed by a machine that Circus Baby refers to as [...] "The Scooper" [...] (designed in a way similar to an excavator), and has Mike watch as the machine tears Ballora's endoskeleton out. She opens the suit's topside and leaves Mike to deal with the Minireenas while preventing the <b>spring</b> <b>locks</b> from coming loose. On the final night, two agents sent to fix the animatronics are found hanged in the Ballora and Funtime auditoriums, respectively. After reaching the Parts and Service room, Mike is told by Circus Baby to take her to the scooping room. From there, the player can heed Circus Baby's instruction and obtain the normal ending, or sidetrack to the hidden [...] "private room" [...] and get into the alternate ending after completing Circus Baby's minigame, where the player needs to clear a survival mission modeled after the first game for the alternate ending.|$|E

60|$|They are {{wonderful}} places, these great Venetian houses, palaces, and fortresses, and prisons all in one.

50|$|A dead bolt, {{deadbolt}} or {{dead lock}} is a locking mechanism distinct from a <b>spring</b> bolt <b>lock</b> because a deadbolt cannot {{be moved to}} the open position except by rotating the lock cylinder with the key. The more common <b>spring</b> bolt <b>lock</b> uses a <b>spring</b> to hold the bolt in place, allowing retraction by applying force to the bolt itself. A deadbolt can therefore make a door more resistant to entry without the correct key.|$|R

60|$|For {{the first}} time I began to realise fully what I had done in coming to this place at such an hour. Some wild {{thoughts}} of a tardy retreat flashed into my mind, and I tried {{the handle of the}} door by which we had entered. It turned, but the door remained closed. I stooped down and examined it. The result was as I had feared--a <b>spring</b> <b>lock</b> had fastened it. I tried the other door, by which my guide had issued. The result was the same. I was a prisoner.|$|R
60|$|Thus {{speaking}} to himself, {{he led her}} into an old-fashioned parlour, {{shut the door behind}} them, and fastened it with a bolt. While Jeanie, surprised at this manoeuvre, remained as near the door as possible, the Laird quitted her hand, and pressed upon a <b>spring</b> <b>lock</b> fixed in an oak panel in the wainscot, which instantly slipped aside. An iron strong-box was discovered in a recess of the wall; he opened this also, and pulling out two or three drawers, showed that they were filled with leathern bags full of gold and silver coin.|$|R
40|$|THE {{diversity}} {{of types of}} orbital implants suggests that the ideal one is still to be found. In the present stage of our knowledge {{it appears that the}} best retained are those which are completely buried. On the other hand the movements of the artificial eye are more natural if there is direct contact between implant and prosthesis. Work on the implant described below was begun in 1953 at the Coventry and Warwickshire Hospital and continued at the Aberdeen Royal Infirmary. To the two essential qualities of an orbital implant, good retention and satisfactory cosmetic result, are added comparative simplicity in use and the possibility of using the model in every case of enucleation, including those of suspected intra-ocular neoplasm. Construction The implant consists of a main body made of transparent acrylic material, perforated cross-wise horizontally, and having four gold wire prongs projecting forward to form a rectangle. The prongs serve as a support and <b>spring</b> <b>lock</b> for a round acrylic platform, containing in its front surface a rectangular hole into which fits the peg of the prosthesis. One side of the body and the corresponding side of the platform are marked with pink acrylic to ensure the proper fitting of the <b>spring</b> <b>lock</b> (Figs 1, 2, and 3).
