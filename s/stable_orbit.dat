5|$|For a <b>stable</b> <b>orbit</b> {{the ratio}} between the moon's orbital period Ps around its primary {{and that of}} the primary around its star Pp must be < 1/9, e.g. if a planet takes 90 days to orbit its star, the maximum <b>stable</b> <b>orbit</b> for a moon of that planet is less than 10 days. Simulations suggest that a moon with an orbital period less than about 45 to 60 days will remain safely bound to a massive giant planet or brown dwarf that orbits 1 AU from a Sun-like star. In the case of Gliese 876 b, the orbital period would have to be no greater than a week (7 days) {{in order to have a}} <b>stable</b> <b>orbit.</b>|$|E
5|$|A vulcanoid is an {{asteroid}} in a <b>stable</b> <b>orbit</b> with a semi-major axis {{less than that}} of Mercury (i.e. 0.387AU). This does not include objects like sungrazing comets, which, although they have perihelia inside the orbit of Mercury, have far greater semi-major axes.|$|E

50|$|An {{analysis}} by Carlos and Raul de la Fuente Marcos revealed that if Planet Nine were on its nominal orbit {{and in the}} direction favored by the analysis of Cassini data, some objects like Sedna would remain on <b>stable</b> <b>orbits</b> while the orbits of others would become unstable leading to their ejection from the Solar System. Other possible orbits, however, could leave all six of the objects identified by Batygin and Brown on <b>stable</b> <b>orbits</b> that maintain anti-alignment.|$|R

5|$|Batygin and Brown {{suggested}} Planet Nine was a primordial giant planet core {{that was}} ejected from its initial orbit by {{an encounter with}} Jupiter during the nebular epoch of the Solar System and was later perturbed into a <b>stable</b> <b>orbit</b> by a distant encounter with a passing star or by the solar nebula. Others have proposed that it was captured {{in a similar manner}} from another star, or that it formed on a very distant circular orbit and was perturbed into its current eccentric orbit during a distant encounter with another star.|$|E
5|$|Dynamical {{friction}} from {{a massive}} belt of planetesimals could also enable Planet Nine's capture in a <b>stable</b> <b>orbit.</b> Recent models propose that a 60–130 Earth mass disk of planetesimals could have formed via streaming instabilities following the photoevaporation {{of the outer}} parts of the gas disk. If the disk had a distant inner edge, 100–200 AU, a planet encountering Neptune would have a 20% chance of being captured in an orbit similar to that proposed for Planet Nine. The observed clustering is more likely if the inner edge is at 200 AU. Unlike the gas nebula the planetesimal disk {{is likely to be}} long lived, potentially allowing a later capture.|$|E
5|$|Ethan Siegel, who {{is deeply}} {{skeptical of the}} {{existence}} of an undiscovered new planet in the Solar System, nevertheless speculates that at least one super-Earth, which have been commonly discovered in other planetary systems but have not been discovered in the Solar System, might have been ejected from the Solar System during a dynamical instability in the early Solar System. Hal Levison thinks that the chance of an ejected object ending up in the inner Oort cloud is only about 2%, and speculates that many objects must have been thrown past the Oort cloud if one has entered a <b>stable</b> <b>orbit.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{existence}} of <b>stable</b> bound <b>orbits</b> of test particles {{is one of}} the most characteristic properties in black hole spacetimes. In higher-dimensional black holes, due to the dimensionality of gravity, there is no <b>stable</b> bound <b>orbit</b> balanced by Newtonian gravitational monopole force and centrifugal force as in the same mechanism of the four-dimensional Kerr black hole case. In this paper, however, the {{existence of}} <b>stable</b> bound <b>orbits</b> of massive and massless particles is shown in six-dimensional singly spinning Myers-Perry black holes with a value of the spin parameter larger than a critical value. The innermost <b>stable</b> circular <b>orbits</b> and the outermost <b>stable</b> bound <b>orbit</b> are found on the rotational axis. Comment: 15 pages, 6 figure...|$|R

25|$|Objects {{scattered}} outward by Neptune onto orbits with {{semi-major axis}} greater than 50 AU can be captured in resonances forming the resonant {{population of the}} scattered disc, or if their eccentricities are reduced while in resonance they can escape from the resonance onto <b>stable</b> <b>orbits</b> in the scattered disc while Neptune is migrating. When Neptune's eccentricity is large its aphelion can reach well beyond its current orbit. Objects that attain perihelia close to or larger than Neptune's at this time can become detached from Neptune when its eccentricity is damped reducing its aphelion, leaving them on <b>stable</b> <b>orbits</b> in the scattered disc.|$|R
5|$|In {{their initial}} paper, Batygin and Brown {{proposed}} that Planet Nine formed {{closer to the}} Sun and was ejected into a distant eccentric orbit following a close encounter with Jupiter or Saturn during the nebular epoch. Gravitational interactions with nearby stars in the Sun's birth cluster, or dynamical friction from the gaseous remnants of the Solar nebula, then reduced the eccentricity of its orbit, raising its perihelion, leaving it on a very wide but <b>stable</b> <b>orbit.</b> Had it not been flung into the Solar System's farthest reaches, Planet Nine could have accreted more mass from the proto-planetary disk and developed into {{the core of a}} gas giant. Instead, its growth was halted early, leaving it with a lower mass of five times Earth's mass, similar to that of Uranus and Neptune. For Planet Nine to have been captured in a distant, <b>stable</b> <b>orbit,</b> its ejection must have occurred early, between three million and ten million years after the formation of the Solar System. This timing suggests that Planet Nine is not the planet ejected in a five-planet version of the Nice model, unless that occurred too early to be the cause of the Late Heavy Bombardment, which would then require another explanation. These ejections, however, are likely to have been two events well separated in time.|$|E
5|$|The orbital radius {{at which}} the stellar flux from Epsilon Eridani matches the solar constant—where the {{emission}} matches the Sun's output at the orbital distance of the Earth—is 0.61 astronomical units (AU). That is within the maximum habitable zone of a conjectured Earth-like planet orbiting Epsilon Eridani, which currently stretches from about 0.5 to 1.0AU. As Epsilon Eridani ages {{over a period of}} 20billion years, the net luminosity will increase, causing this zone to slowly expand outward to about 0.6–1.4AU. The presence of a large planet with a highly elliptical orbit in proximity to Epsilon Eridani's habitable zone reduces the likelihood of a terrestrial planet having a <b>stable</b> <b>orbit</b> within the habitable zone.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of Neptune has {{a profound effect}} on the Kuiper belt's structure due to orbital resonances. Over a timescale comparable to the age of the Solar System, Neptune's gravity destabilises the orbits of any objects that happen to lie in certain regions, and either sends them into the inner Solar System or out into the scattered disc or interstellar space. This causes the Kuiper belt to have pronounced gaps in its current layout, similar to the Kirkwood gaps in the asteroid belt. In the region between 40 and 42 AU, for instance, no objects can retain a <b>stable</b> <b>orbit</b> over such times, and any observed in that region must have migrated there relatively recently.|$|E

40|$|With {{continued}} {{improvement in}} telescope sensitivity and observational techniques, {{the search for}} rocky planets in stellar habitable zones is entering an exciting era. With so many exoplanetary systems available for follow-up observations to find potentially habitable planets, one needs to prioritise the ever-growing list of candidates. We aim to determine which of the known planetary systems are dynamically capable of hosting rocky planets in their habitable zones, {{with the goal of}} helping to focus future planet search programs. We perform an extensive suite of numerical simulations to identify regions in the habitable zones of single Jovian planet systems where Earth mass planets could maintain <b>stable</b> <b>orbits,</b> specifically focusing on the systems in the Catalog of Earth-like Exoplanet Survey Targets (CELESTA). We find that small, Earth-mass planets can maintain <b>stable</b> <b>orbits</b> in cases where the habitable zone is largely, or partially, unperturbed by a nearby Jovian, and that mutual gravitational interactions and resonant mechanisms are capable of producing <b>stable</b> <b>orbits</b> even in habitable zones that are significantly or completely disrupted by a Jovian. Our results yield a list of 13 single Jovian planet systems in CELESTA that are not only capable of supporting an Earth-mass planet on <b>stable</b> <b>orbits</b> in their habitable zone, but for which we are also able to constrain the orbits of the Earth-mass planet such that the induced radial velocity signals would be detectable with next generation instruments.

40|$|This Bachelor {{thesis is}} a {{summarising}} text {{which deals with}} the issue of space motion. We analyse one-body, two-body and three-body problems. We derive analytical solution for the first two problems, from which we derive Kepler's laws, which are important for understanding of the space motion. We also discuss the relation of analytical solution to escape velocities. The closed form of analytical solution for general case of three-body problem does not exist. There are special cases, so-called <b>stable</b> <b>orbits,</b> for which the analytical solution is known. We design the numerical solution by explicit Runge-Kutta-Bogacki-Shampine method and back diferentiation method and we will test the results on the <b>stable</b> <b>orbits...</b>|$|R
5|$|It is {{probable}} that the planet is composed of hydrogen and helium. The planet orbits on the same plane as Kepler-9b, a second and larger gas giant located in the Kepler-9 system. While observing the planet, the Kepler team noticed that Kepler-9b and c orbited in a 1:2 ratio, where Kepler-9b orbits its star every 19 days and Kepler-9c orbits every 38 days. The gravitational pull that each planet has on the other, known as orbital resonance, keeps the planets in a <b>stable</b> <b>orbit.</b> This phenomenon {{is the first of}} its kind seen outside the Solar System. Every time Kepler-9c completed an orbit during the observation period, its orbital period decreased by about 39 minutes. At some point, however, this trend will reverse and its orbit will increase. The lengths of its orbit will oscillate slightly above and below the 2:1 ratio.|$|E
5|$|Close {{encounters}} {{between the}} Sun and other stars in its birth cluster could {{have resulted in}} the capture of a planet from beyond the Solar System. Three-body interactions during these encounters can perturb the path of planets on distant orbits around another star, or free-floating planets, in a process similar to the capture of irregular satellites around the giant planets, leaving one in a <b>stable</b> <b>orbit</b> around the Sun. A planet that originated in a system with a number of Neptune-massed planets and without Jupiter-massed planets, could be scattered into a more long-lasting distant eccentric orbit, increasing its chances of capture by another star. Although this increases the odds of the Sun capturing another planet from another star, a wide variety of orbits are possible, reducing the probability of a planet being captured on an orbit like that proposed for Planet Nine to 1–2 percent. In a simulation where the capture takes place between co-planar systems a large number of other objects are also captured into orbits aligned with the planet, potentially allowing this capture scenario to be distinguished from others. The likelihood of the capture of a free-floating planet is much smaller, with only 5–10 of 10,000 simulated free-floating planets being captured on orbits similar to that proposed for Planet Nine.|$|E
5|$|Simulations {{suggest that}} the inner part of the {{habitable}} zone of 47 Ursae Majoris could host a terrestrial planet in a <b>stable</b> <b>orbit,</b> though the outer regions of the habitable zone would be disrupted by the gravitational influence of the planet 47 UMa b. However, {{the presence of a}} giant planet within 2.5 AU of the star may have disrupted planet formation in the inner system, and reduced the amount of water delivered to inner planets during accretion. This may mean any terrestrial planets orbiting in the habitable zone of 47 Ursae Majoris are likely to be small and dry. , there have been two METI messages sent to 47 Ursae Majoris. Both were transmitted from Eurasia's largest radar — 70-meter (230-foot) Eupatoria Planetary Radar.

The test points out certain nonlinearly <b>stable</b> <b>orbits,</b> and is inconclusive for the remaining equilibria. The latter ones are treated via linearization; all of them prove instability.

25|$|Although {{sometimes}} {{described as}} being at L1, the SOHO spacecraft is not exactly at L1 as this would make communication difficult due to radio interference generated by the Sun, and because {{this would not be}} a <b>stable</b> <b>orbit.</b> Rather it lies in the (constantly moving) plane which passes through L1 and is perpendicular to the line connecting the Sun and the Earth. It stays in this plane, tracing out an elliptical lissajous orbit centered about L1.

For a Kerr black hole, we perform a detailed numerical analysis of these frequencies at the innermost <b>stable</b> circular <b>orbits</b> and beyond them {{as well as at the}} characteristic <b>stable</b> <b>orbits,</b> at which the radial epicyclic frequency attains its highest value. We find that the values of the epicyclic frequencies for a class of <b>stable</b> <b>orbits</b> exhibit good qualitative agreement with the observed frequencies of the twin peaks quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs) in some black hole binaries. We also find that at the characteristic <b>stable</b> circular <b>orbits,</b> where the radial (or the vertical) epicyclic frequency has maxima, the vertical and radial epicyclic frequencies exhibit an approximate 2 : 1 ratio even in the case of near-extreme rotation of the black hole. Next, we perform a similar analysis of the fundamental frequencies for a rotating braneworld black hole and argue that the existence of such a black hole with a negative tidal charge, whose angular momentum exceeds the Kerr bound in general relativity, does not confront with the observations of high frequency QPOs.
