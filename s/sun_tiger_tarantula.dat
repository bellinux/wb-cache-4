40|$|SummaryToxins {{have evolved}} to target regions of {{membrane}} ion channels that underlie ligand binding, gating, or ion permeation, and have thus served as invaluable tools for probing channel structure and function. Here, we describe a peptide toxin from the Earth <b>Tiger</b> <b>tarantula</b> that selectively and irreversibly activates the capsaicin- and heat-sensitive channel, TRPV 1. This high-avidity interaction derives from a unique tandem repeat structure of the toxin that endows it with an antibody-like bivalency. The “double-knot” toxin traps TRPV 1 in the open state by interacting with residues in the presumptive pore-forming region of the channel, highlighting the importance of conformational changes in the outer pore region of TRP channels during activation...|$|R

Nadir Divan-begi held this position {{during the reign}} of Imam Quli-khan (1611-1642), the strongest khan of the Ashtarkhanid (Janid) dynasty (established in 1599). The devotion to Islam tradition in the state under Janid dynasty was pale before the eagerness of the time of prominent Shaibanid khans. These two important peculiarities of the power were soon expressed in remarkable architecture tendency. In 1619 Yalantush-biy who virtually independently governed Samarkand had begun the construction of Sher-Dor Madrasah. The rich colored finishing and the depiction of <b>sun,</b> <b>tigers</b> and antelopes tell of a pioneering approach to artistic expression, unique in the Islamic world. In three years Nadir Divan-begi had followed Yalantush-biy by construction of his own revolutionary structure (Nadir Divan-Begi Madrasah).

40|$|Applications {{developed}} on Earth of technology needed for space flight have produced thousands of spinoffs {{that contribute to}} improving national security, the economy, productivity and lifestyle. Over the course of it s history, NASA has nurtured partnerships {{with the private sector}} to facilitate the transfer of NASA-developed technology. For every dollar spent on research and development in the space program, it receives back $ 7 back in the form of corporate and personal income taxes from increased jobs and economic growth. A new technology, known as Liquid-metal alloy, {{is the result of a}} project funded by NASA s Jet Propulsion Lab. The unique technology is a blend of titanium, zirconium, nickel, copper and beryllium that achieves a strength greater than titanium. NASA plans to use this metal in the construction of a drill that will help for the search of water beneath the surface of Mars. Many other applications include opportunities in aerospace, defense, military, automotive, medical instrumentation and sporting goods. Developed in the 1980 s, the original <b>Sun</b> <b>Tigers</b> Inc sunlight-filtering lens has withstood the test of time. This technology was first reported in 1987 by NASA s JPL. Two scientists from JPL were later tasked with studying the harmful effects of radiation produced during laser and welding work. They came up with a transparent welding curtain that absorbs, filters and scatters light to maximize protection of human eyes. The two scientists then began doing business as Eagle Eye Optics. Each pair of sunglasses comes complete with ultraviolet protection, dual layer scratch resistant coating, polarized filters for maximum protection against glare and high visual clarity. Sufficient evidence shows that damage to the eye, especially to the retina, starts much earlier than most people realize. Sun filtering sunglasses are important. Winglets seen at the tips of airplane wings are among aviations most visible fuel-saving, performance enhancing technology. Aerodynamics centers on two majors forces-lift and drag. Lift enables the plane to fly and drag is the resistance encountered while moving through the air. The air coming off the end of a standard wing, in a vortex, causes significant drag and turbulence, forcing the spacing between takeoffs. A Langley engineer for NASA published finding in 1976 and verified by test in 1977 that winglets produce a 7 percent increase in lift-drag ratio with a 20 percent decrease in drag. This configuration reduces emissions, allows for greater range and carry more payload and the planes fly more quietly. Winglet technology has saved 2 billion gallons of jet fuel worldwide in 2010. Aerogel represents what technology experts believe to be the best insulation material ever invented. It is very light, flexible and can withstand temperatures of minus 3000 deg F. Aerogel products will be found in everything from clothing, to building insulation to space vehicles.

50|$|However, word of Yingying's beauty soon reaches <b>Sun</b> the Flying <b>Tiger,</b> a local bandit. He dispatches ruffians to {{surround}} the monastery, {{in the hopes}} of taking her as his consort. Yingying's mother agrees that whoever drives the bandits away can have Yingying's hand in marriage, so Zhang Sheng contacts his childhood friend General Du, who is stationed not far away. The general subdues the bandits, and it seems that Zhang Sheng and Cui Yingying are set to be married. However, Yingying's mother begins to regret her rash promise to Zhang Sheng, and takes back her word, with the excuse that Yingying is already betrothed to the son of another high official of the court. The two young lovers are greatly disappointed, and begin to pine away with their unfulfilled love. Fortunately, Yingying's maid, Hong Niang, takes pity on them, and ingeniously arranges to bring them together in a secret union. When Yingying's mother discovers what her daughter has done, she reluctantly consents to a formal marriage on one condition: Zhang must travel to the capital and pass the civil service examination. To the joy of the young lovers, Zhang Sheng proves to be a brilliant scholar, and is appointed to high office. The story thus ends on a happy note, as the two are finally married.|$|R

The hero frame of the United States described itself as a hero, North Korea and Middle Eastern countries as villains, and the people of those countries and sometimes the United States as victims. Meanwhile, The Rodong Sinmun of North Korea used “hero” and “heroic” without a refined symbol system. In The Rodong Sinmun, Kim Il-Sung and Kim Jong-Il were the utmost heroes in that they enabled the heroic working class of North Korea to realize their historic importance and led North Korean soldiers in their success against imperialists. The hero frame used to describe Kim Il-Sung included metaphors such as an affectionate father, the <b>sun,</b> and a <b>tiger.</b> The hero frame for Kim Jong-Il used metaphors such as a mother, the sunshine, and a crane. Kim Il-Sung and Kim Jong-Il were perceived to be optimistic heroes who were not allowed in Korean traditional culture, as featured as the emotion of “han” and in the fable “Baby Commander. ...|$|R
