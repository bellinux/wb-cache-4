5|$|The overall cargo {{weight is}} the {{limiting}} {{factor in the}} design of an ore carrier, since the cargo is <b>so</b> <b>dense.</b> Coal carriers, on the other hand, are limited by overall volume, since most bulkers can be completely filled with coal before reaching their maximum draft.|$|E
5|$|Its {{high density}} and {{resistance}} to corrosion have been exploited {{in a number of}} related applications. It is used as ballast in sailboat keels. Its weight allows it to counterbalance the heeling effect of wind on the sails; being <b>so</b> <b>dense</b> it takes up a small volume and minimizes water resistance. It is used in scuba diving weight belts to counteract the diver's buoyancy. In 1993, the base of the Leaning Tower of Pisa was stabilized with 600 tonnes of lead. Because of its corrosion resistance, lead is used as a protective sheath for underwater cables.|$|E
5|$|Some uses {{of heavy}} metals, {{including}} in sport, mechanical engineering, military ordnance, and nuclear science, {{take advantage of}} their relatively high densities. In underwater diving, lead is used as a ballast; in handicap horse racing each horse must carry a specified lead weight, based on factors including past performance, so as to equalize the chances of the various competitors. In golf, tungsten, brass, or copper inserts in fairway clubs and irons lower the centre of gravity of the club making it easier to get the ball into the air; and golf balls with tungsten cores are claimed to have better flight characteristics. In fly fishing, sinking fly lines have a PVC coating embedded with tungsten powder, so that they sink at the required rate. In track and field sport, steel balls used in the hammer throw and shot put events are filled with lead in order to attain the minimum weight required under international rules. Tungsten was used in hammer throw balls at least up to 1980; the minimum size of the ball was increased in 1981 to eliminate the need for what was, at that time, an expensive metal (triple the cost of other hammers) not generally available in all countries. Tungsten hammers were <b>so</b> <b>dense</b> that they penetrated too deeply into the turf.|$|E

25|$|Magnetic mirror dominates in low beta designs. Both ions and {{electrons}} {{are reflected}} from high to low density fields. This {{is known as}} the magnetic mirror effect.

50|$|Rome had an {{extremely}} high population, and remnants of buildings suggest the average living space was very small. Many people crammed into small spaces led to very {{high rates of}} infection for transmittable diseases.

5|$|The factor {{limiting}} {{this process}} {{is the amount of}} energy that is released through fusion, which is dependent on the binding energy that holds together these atomic nuclei. Each additional step produces progressively heavier nuclei, which release progressively less energy when fusing. In addition, from carbon-burning onwards, energy loss via neutrino production becomes significant, leading to a higher rate of reaction than would otherwise take place. This continues until nickel-56 is produced, which decays radioactively into cobalt-56 and then iron-56 {{over the course of a}} few months. As iron and nickel have the highest binding energy per nucleon of all the elements, energy cannot be produced at the core by fusion, and a nickel-iron core grows. This core is under huge gravitational pressure. As there is no fusion to further raise the star's temperature to support it against collapse, it is supported only by degeneracy pressure of electrons. In this state, matter is <b>so</b> <b>dense</b> that further compaction would require electrons to occupy the same energy states. However, this is forbidden for identical fermion particles, such as the electron – a phenomenon called the Pauli exclusion principle.|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{extension}} of the metropolitan area, there exists a difference of 5°C between the central area and the Greater Córdoba. The central district, a dense high-rise area is located in a depression, and it is the core of an important heat island.

25|$|Another {{important}} {{use of the}} neutrino is in {{the observation}} of supernovae, the explosions that end the lives of highly massive stars. The core collapse phase of a supernova is an extremely dense and energetic event. It is <b>so</b> <b>dense</b> that no known particles are able to escape the advancing core front except for neutrinos. Consequently, supernovae are known to release approximately 99% of their radiant energy in a short (10-second) burst of neutrinos. These neutrinos are a very useful probe for core collapse studies.|$|E
25|$|Like other forest ungulates, bongos {{are seldom}} seen in large groups. Males, called bulls, {{tend to be}} solitary, while females with young live in groups of six to eight.

The fire lasted for four days until it had burnt everything combustible in its range to ashes and after it had reached waterways, large thoroughfares, and parks that the fire could not jump over. Due to the exhaustion of German supplies the German anti-aircraft defense was under-equipped and weak so {{that out of the}} 1,600 US aircraft committed, only 36 were shot down and their crews – as far as they survived the crash of their planes – taken as prisoners-of-war. First Air Division commander Lt. Col. Rosenthal was among those shot down and survived, but was rescued by the Soviet armed forces and eventually returned to England.|$|E

25|$|The 137th Brigade attack {{went wrong}} from the start; the smoke screen was <b>so</b> <b>dense</b> {{at first that}} men got lost and the advance was neither uniform nor simultaneous. After thirty minutes the smoke blew back and dispersed. The Germans were ready, mud around the British front line and in no man's land, slowed the advance; the Germans emerged from shelter when the British were only halfway across. The troops who got across found that the German wire was smashed about, uncut or had been repaired. The Germans were {{deployed}} nearly {{as soon as the}} British guns lifted and German barrage fire began on the British lines. The German shelling was so bad that the third wave was ordered up communication trenches instead of advancing in the open. Before the wave managed to leave the advanced trench, the German barrage began to fall on no man's land and increase in intensity. German machine-gun fire from The Z, a spur beyond the left flank of the attack was most effective, few of the rear British waves got across and parts of the first three waves either stayed in the British front line or sought cover in no man's land. The leading troops of the 1/6th South and the 1/6th North Staffordshire were caught by flanking fire from the south but got to the German wire and were shot down or killed with hand grenades. A few men broke into the front trench but unsupported, were forced out or destroyed.|$|E

500|$|Intensive {{geological}} {{sampling and}} survey {{work of the}} pipeline route started in spring 1970. Aerial photograph were taken, examined, and a preliminary route was detailed.

In places, the foliage was <b>so</b> <b>dense</b> that trees had to be cut down and progress was limited to [...] per day. The surveyed route passed through several mountain passes: Atigun Pass, Isabel Pass, Thompson Pass, and Keystone Canyon.

500|$|The core {{collapse}} {{phase is}} <b>so</b> <b>dense</b> and energetic that only neutrinos {{are able to}} escape. As the protons and electrons combine to form neutrons by means of electron capture, an electron neutrino is produced. In a typical Type II supernova, the newly formed neutron core has an initial temperature of about 100 billion kelvins, 104 times {{the temperature of the}} Sun's core. Much of this thermal energy must be shed for a stable neutron star to form, otherwise the neutrons would [...] "boil away". This is accomplished by a further release of neutrinos. These 'thermal' neutrinos form as neutrino-antineutrino pairs of all flavors, and total several times the number of electron-capture neutrinos. The two neutrino production mechanisms convert the gravitational potential energy of the collapse into a ten-second neutrino burst, releasing about 1046 joules (100foe).|$|E

The three remaining carriages of Wellington's original train, still on the southern track, were detached from the train and attached to Northumbrian, which set off at full speed for Manchester. As the train approached Manchester the trackside bystanders became increasingly hostile, booing, hissing and waving banners against Wellington. Hostile crowds spilled onto the track, forcing the trains to slow to a crawl.
