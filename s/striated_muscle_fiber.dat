50|$|The {{sarcolemma}} (sarco (from sarx) from Greek; flesh, and lemma from Greek; sheath.) {{also called}} the myolemma, is the cell membrane of a <b>striated</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>fiber</b> cell. It consists of a plasma membrane, which is a lipid bilayer, and an outer coat consisting of {{a thin layer of}} polysaccharide material (glycocalyx) that contacts the basement membrane, which contains numerous thin collagen fibrils and specialized proteins such as laminin that provide a scaffold for the muscle fiber to adhere to. Through transmembrane proteins residing in the plasma membrane, the actin skeleton inside the cell is connected to the basement membrane and the cell's exterior. At each end of the muscle fiber, the surface layer of the sarcolemma fuses with a tendon fiber, and the tendon fibers in turn collect into bundles to form the muscle tendons that then adhere onto bones.|$|E
40|$|The {{acetylcholine}} (ACh) receptors of the mature, innervated, vertebrate <b>striated</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>fiber</b> {{are restricted}} to the neuromuscular junction (8).

The structural and molecular basis for this discrete distribution is unknown. ACh receptors on myotubes grown in culture from dissociated chick embryo skeletal muscle cells initially have an even distribution. However, as the myotubes mature, discrete regions with high receptor concentration (clusters) are formed (3, 9, 10). Analysis of these clusters may yield information on the mechanisms which serve to restrict the distribution of neurotransmitter receptors to (and within) the neuromuscular junction and other (5) synaptic connections.

40|$|AbstractA <b>striated</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>fiber</b> {{consists}} {{of thousands of}} myofibrils with crystalline hexagonal myofilament lattices. Because the lattices are randomly oriented, the fiber gives rise to an equatorial x-ray diffraction pattern, which is essentially a rotary-averaged “powder diffraction,” carrying only information about {{the distance between the}} lattice planes. We were able to record an x-ray diffraction pattern from a single myofilament lattice, very likely originating from a single myofibril from the flight muscle of a bumblebee, by orienting the incident x-ray microbeam along the myofibrillar axis (end-on diffraction). The pattern consisted of a number of hexagonally symmetrical diffraction spots whose originating lattice planes were readily identified. This also held true for some of the weak higher order reflections. The spot-like appearance of reflections implies that the lattice order is extremely well maintained for a distance of millimeters, covering up to a thousand of ∼ 2. 5 -μm-long sarcomeres connected in series. The results open the possibility of applying the x-ray microdiffraction technique to study many other micrometer-sized assemblies of functional biomolecules in the cell...|$|E

In the present study, we have utilized the specific Hsp 90 -binding agent, geldanamycin, to examine the requirement for Hsp 90 during zebrafish development. We show that geldanamycin interacts with both the α and the β-isoforms of zebrafish Hsp 90 and that geldanamycin-treated embryos consistently exhibit a number of defects in tissues which express either one of these genes. Within the somites, geldanamycin treatment results in the absence ofeng- 2 -expressing muscle pioneer cells. However, early development of adaxial cells, which give rise to muscle pioneers and which strongly express thehsp 90 α gene shortly before muscle pioneer formation, appeared unaffected. Furthermore, development of the notochord, which provides many of the signals required for proper somite patterning and which does not express detectable levels of eitherhsp 90 α orhsp 90 β mRNA, was similarly unaffected in geldanamycin-treated embryos.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Gubernacula tissue samples were obtained from 12 patients with cryptorchidism. Patients' ages ranged from 1 to 3 years (mean 1. 8). Of the 12 patients, 6 were treated with hCG. The samples were stained with Masson's trichrome to highlight <b>muscle</b> <b>fibers</b> and collagen, and Weigert's resorcin-fuchsin to highlight the elastic system fibers. The volumetric density of these components was determined by stereological methods. RESULTS: The volumetric density of collagen was increased in patients treated with hCG, ranging from 85. 62 % to 94. 48 %, while in patients not submitted to hCG treatment the volume density ranged from 52. 12 % to 89. 46 % (p = 0. 0052). The volumetric density of the elastic system fibers was higher in patients treated with hCG, ranging from 9. 62 % to 19. 62 %, while patients not submitted to hCG treatment the volume density of elastic system fibers was between 10. 38 % and 12. 38 % (p = 0. 0030). The volume density of <b>striated</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>fibers</b> in patients treated with hCG ranged from 4. 76 % to 39. 16 %, while and in patients not treated hCG it ranged from 3. 24 % to 11. 14 % (p = 0. 0052).

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{values of}} {{membrane}} action potentials and maximum depolarization rates of single muscle fibers in normal Tyrode solution and in low sodium solutions containing {{as little as}} 20 per cent of the sodium chloride were measured with intracellular microelectrodes. Under these conditions the membrane potential remains unchanged up to 36 per cent of [Na+]ou, concentration, whereas the overshoot of the action potential varies linearly with the logarithm of the external sodium concentration. The maximum depolarization rate is a linear function of the external sodium concentration. The results obtained support the ionic theory for sodium and the independence principle for sodium current related to the external sodium concentration. The validity of the ionic theory for the striated fiber of frog's sartorius muscle was demonstrated by Nastuk and Hodgkin (1). The purpose of our research was to ascertain the validity of such theory with regard to [Na +] in the <b>striated</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>fiber</b> of mammals. This was done by measuring the action potential and the maximum rate of depolarization at different external concentrations of sodium ions. METHOD All experiments were carried out on the obliquus internus abdominis muscle of guinea pigs.

40|$|An inverse {{relationship}} exists between <b>striated</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>fiber</b> size and its oxidative capacity. This relationship implies that muscle fibers, which are triggered to simultaneously increase their mass/strength (hypertrophy) and fatigue resistance (oxidative capacity), increase these properties (strength or fatigue resistance) {{to a lesser}} extent compared to fibers increasing either of these alone. Muscle fiber size and oxidative capacity are determined by the balance between myofibrillar protein synthesis, mitochondrial biosynthesis and degradation. New experimental data and an inventory of critical stimuli and state of activation of the signaling pathways involved in regulating contractile and metabolic protein turnover reveal: (1) higher capacity for protein synthesis in high compared to low oxidative fibers; (2) competition between signaling pathways for synthesis of myofibrillar proteins and proteins associated with oxidative metabolism; i. e., increased mitochondrial biogenesis via AMP-activated protein kinase attenuates the rate of protein synthesis; (3) relatively higher expression levels of E 3 -ligases and proteasome-mediated protein degradation in high oxidative fibers. These observations could explain the fiber type-fiber size paradox that despite the high capacity for protein synthesis in high oxidative fibers, these fibers remain relatively small. However, it remains challenging to understand the mechanisms by which contractile activity, mechanical loading, cellular energy status and cellular oxygen tension affect regulation of fiber size. Therefore, one needs to know the relative contribution of the signaling pathways to protein turnover in high and low oxidative fibers.

40|$|Ischemic heart {{diseases}} {{are the leading}} cause of death worldwide: approximately 3. 8 million men and 3. 4 million women die each year from coronary heart diseases (World Health Organization data). Among them, acute myocardial infarction (MI), usually known as a heart attack, accounts for about 23 % of deaths each year. The term MI refers to the acute coronary syndrome due to the obstruction of one or more branches of the coronary arteries that blocks blood flow and determines necrosis of the myocardium. The process of cardiac myocyte death and regeneration is part of the normal heart homeostasis; however, in pathological conditions the balance between renewal and death is altered, the proliferative capacity remains only in the non-infarcted area and in the border zone (interface between the infarcted and healthy tissue), the process of myocyte death begins to predominate, hypertrophy becomes evident and the number of ventricular myocytes starts to decrease. For this reason, a MI causes a permanent damage: the infarcted area turns into a fibrous scar and the left ventricle undergoes a detrimental remodeling process, characterized by dilatation, hypertrophy and worsening of cardiac function. MI treatment is usually based on drug administration, surgery or minimally invasive therapies, that, unfortunately, are unable to completely restore the functionality of the damaged myocardium; for this reason, at least one third of patients who survive undergoes heart failure, i. e. heart inability to provide sufficient pump action to maintain blood flow to meet the needs of the body. At present, cardiac transplantation remains the gold standard of cardiac replacement therapy in patients showing heart failure symptoms. However, the supply of donor hearts is limited and anti-rejection immunosuppressive therapies need to be administered. Alternative forms of cardiac replacement therapy are being investigated (ventricle assist devices and total artificial heart) to bridge the time to heart transplantation or to permanently replace the heart when organ transplantation is impossible because of age and other comorbid conditions. In this context, the need to develop therapies able to stimulate cardiac tissue repair, sustain a functional improvement of the adjacent muscle areas and limit ventricular remodeling has emerged as a challenging target in the last years. This thesis work faces the need of new alternative therapies to treat infarcted patients through the design of bioengineered constructs (scaffolds), both cellularized and not, to be implanted on the damaged area, with the final aim of stimulating cardiac tissue repair. Such an application requires compliance with strict requirements: biocompatibility, biomimetics, promotion of cell adhesion, proliferation and eventually differentiation, degradation post-implantation, adequate mechanical properties, interconnected porosity, moderate hydrophilicity. The first experimental step faced in this work was the selection of the scaffold forming material. To this aim, attention was directed to the large family of polyurethanes (PURs), that, thanks to their high chemical versatility, allow a fine tuning of the physico-chemical, biological and mechanical properties of the resulting polymer. A series of poly(ester urethane) s based on poly(ε-caprolactone) diol (PCL, Mn= 2000 g/mol), 1, 4 -diisocyanatobutane (BDI) and different chain extenders was synthesized and thoroughly characterized, with the final aim of selecting the most promising polymer for the intended application. For instance, the chain extenders were an amino acid derivative diamine (L-Lysine ethyl ester), a cyclic diol (1, 4 -cyclohexane dimethanol -CDM-), an amino acid derivative diol (N-Boc-serinol) and a custom made diamine, containing an enzymatically degradable peptide (Ala-Ala sequence). PCL was selected to confer biodegradability to the final PUR, while BDI is an aliphatic diisocyanate, whose degradation product is expected to be putrescine, a non-toxic diamine, essential for cell growth and differentiation. Spectroscopic and chromatographic analysis demonstrated the successful synthesis of the designed PURs. Thermal characterization highlighted that all the synthesized PURs can be suitable substrates for biomedical applications. Contact angle measurements revealed slightly hydrophobic surfaces with contact angle values in the range 76 - 90 °. Moreover, a correlation between surface domain morphologies and thermal properties was highlighted and a relationship between biological response and surface morphology was observed. PURs that possessed the highest crystallinity (PURs synthesized by using N-Boc serinol or the custom made peptide as chain extender) showed high order spherulitic morphologies; on the opposite, the PUR with the lowest crystallinity (PUR synthesized by using L-Lysine ethyl ester as chain extender) showed a clear phase separation, but no spherulites and lamellar structures were detected. In addition, a better C 2 C 12 myoblast adhesion and proliferation were observed for polymers having surface with less ordered structure (PURs synthesized by using L-Lysine ethyl ester or CDM as chain extender). In the series of polyurethanes studied, the most promising polymer for the repair of soft contractile tissues was that synthesized by using L-Lysine ethyl ester as chain extender (acronym K-BC 2000), since it better matched the elastomeric behavior of muscle tissues (Young Modulus 8. 5 ± 0. 5 MPa, stress at break 9. 8 ± 1. 7 MPa, strain at break 682. 7 ± 41. 3 %) and, in the meantime, cell tests performed with myoblasts C 2 C 12 on this substrate showed high viability, adequate cell adhesion, spreading and proliferation. Moreover, durability tests (strain 15 %, frequency 1 Hz, 432000 cycles) performed on compression molded K-BC 2000 films revealed the capability of the selected PUR to withstand cyclic stresses and the absence of macroscopic damages or fracture. Hydrolytic degradation of K-BC 2000 dense films was negligible within 8 weeks, while they completely degraded enzymatically in 6 weeks. Once the scaffold forming material was selected, it was processed in the form of porous matrices by Thermally Induced Phase Separation (TIPS) using dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as solvent. With the final aim of developing non-cellularized cardiac patches, two scaffolds differing in the concentration of the starting PUR solution in DMSO (5 or 10 %w/v) were fabricated by applying a thermal cooling gradient during the quenching phase, to produce scaffolds with oriented pores, that mimic muscle tissue anisotropy. Scaffolds were obtained with open and interconnected pores, having sizes ranging from tens μm to more than 200 μm and porosity of 80 - 90 %. As desired, the pores were elongated in the direction of the applied cooling gradient. The scaffold fabricated using a 10 %w/v concentrated PUR solution (acronym K-BC 2000 10 % w/v) demonstrated potential for future application in cardiac tissue engineering/regenerative medicine from a mechanical (Young Modulus 1. 6 ± 0. 6 MPa, stress at break 0. 2 ± 0. 0 MPa, strain at break 30. 0 ± 1. 7 % in dry state), thermal and biological point of view. Biological tests with human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hBMMSCs), indeed, showed its ability to support cell adhesion and growth. As a consequence of scaffold morphology, cells cultured on it adopted a stretched spindle-shape morphology and aligned in parallel to each other. Furthermore, very preliminary investigations on the differentiation potential of hBMMSCs seeded on it revealed loss of stemness (C-kit down-regulation) and upregulation of a myogenic marker (Mef- 2 C), after 8 days of static cell culture. However, further work must be conducted to better understand cell differentiation pathways. In addition, the scaffold K-BC 2000 10 %w/v turned out easy to sew up and showed good handiness and a satisfactory resistance to suture, that made it potentially suturable on heart infarcted region. This scaffold was further mechanically characterized at both the macro- and nano-scale by tensile tests and Indentation-Type Atomic Force Miscoscopy (IT-AFM), respectively. Both tests were conducted in wet conditions to mimic in vivo environment. Moreover, the construct was morphologically characterized at the nanoscale through Atomic Force Miscoscopy (AFM). The interest in scaffold nanoscale properties arose from the growing evidence that both nanoscale features and stiffness influence cell behavior in terms of cytoskeletal organization, adhesion and differentiation. The study of scaffold nano-morphology showed, for the first time, that thermally induced phase separation under application of a thermal cooling gradient can be exploited to successfully produce oriented scaffolds not only at the microscale (aligned fibers), as assessed by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), but also at the nanoscale (aligned fibrils, due to polymer chain orientation in the direction of the applied cooling gradient). As a consequence, cells interacting with the developed substrates sense the presence of an anisotropic structure at two different scales: at a larger scale, cells sense pore orientation that should favor their alignment in a preferred direction, thus mimicking <b>striated</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>fiber</b> organization; at the nanoscale, cells sense polymer chain orientation that can positively influence the cytoskeletal organization and morphology of the single cell. At the nanoscale, the scaffold K-BC 2000 10 %w/v exhibited Young Modulus values of hundreds kPa, mimicking the stiffness of native cardiac cells, and Young Modulus values of few MPa that could favor cell adhesion and electromechanical coupling. At the macro-scale, the scaffold showed a Young Modulus of about 300 kPa in wet conditions, in accordance with the stiffness required for its application in cardiac tissue engineering/regenerative medicine. Finally, thermally induced phase separation under application of a thermal cooling gradient was exploited to fabricate matrices able to withstand up to 10 days of dynamic cell culture in a stress-controlled bioreactor, with the final aim of developing cellularized constructs for application in cardiac TERM. Three different scaffolds were produced by changing the quenching parameters (- 20 °C for 5 h, - 20 °C overnight, - 80 °C for 3 h) adopted to induce phase separation in a 12 %w/v K-BC 2000 solution in DMSO. The application of a thermal cooling gradient during the quenching phase resulted in scaffolds with oriented and stretched pores in a preferred direction, i. e. the direction of the applied cooling gradient, only when the quenching phase was conducted at - 80 °C for 3 h. The lack of stretched and elongated pores in both the scaffolds quenched at - 20 °C is probably correlated to the concurrent effects of both the freezing conditions and the concentration of the starting solution. However, from a structural point of view, i. e. porosity (about 80 %), pore size and pore distribution (pore size ranges between tens and hundreds μm), all the scaffolds turned out suitable for application in cardiac TERM. The scaffold fabricated by quenching the 12 %w/v PUR solution at - 20 °C for 5 h was selected for further studies since its mechanical properties (Young Modulus 2. 5 ± 0. 3 MPa, stress at break 0. 4 ± 0. 0 MPa, strain at break 127. 5 ± 4. 8 % in dry state, Young Modulus 1. 1 ± 0. 1 MPa, stress at break 0. 3 ± 0. 0 MPa, strain at break 171. 3 ± 5. 0 % in wet state) matched at best the requirements for application in cardiac TERM and it turned out suitable to withstand 10 days of mechanical stimulation (0. 4 ± 0. 2 N, 1 Hz) without rupture or damages. Adipose tissue-derived stromal cells (ADSCs) were seeded on it and subjected to dynamic cell culture in a stress-controlled bioreactor in the presence of a serum free medium enriched with a cardiogenic cocktail developed and patented by the Swiss Stem Cell Foundation (Lugano, Switzerland). Differently from bioreactors typically described in literature, that apply an uniaxial sinusoidal strain (usually in the range 5 - 15 % to mimic cardiac muscle deformation during each cardiac cycle) to the grasped patches, the dynamic cell culture system used in this work applied an uniaxial sinusoidal stress to the cellularized patch, thus making it possible to mechanically stimulate cells with a mechanical stress approximately equivalent to the diastolic stress of the native heart. In addition, in view of the potential clinical application of the developed cellularized patch, both the cell culture medium and the cardiogenic cocktail did not contain any animal derivatives or chemical agents that may negatively affect cell genomic stability. Cells seeded on the porous substrates adopted a stretched spindle-shape morphology and aligned in the direction of the applied mechanical stimulus. The combination of a 3 D support and mechanical stimulation, in the presence of serum free medium enriched with the cardiogenic cocktail, led to an at least 2 fold increase in mRNA expression of several cardiac markers (Nkx 2. 5, Mef- 2 C, HAND 2 and MHC), compared to cardiogenic induction conducted in 2 D (cell culture plates). These results suggest, for the first time, that even a weak mechanical stimulus (the applied cyclic stress (0. 4 ± 0. 1 N, 1 Hz) resulted in a cyclic strain of about 1 %) can have significant effects on stem cell commitment towards a cardiac phenotype. However, further studies are necessary to confirm these promising results and assess the influence of the amplitude of the applied stress on cardiac marker expression. Moreover, strategies to promote cell migration need to be implemented, since cells mainly localized on scaffold surface and penetrated within approximately 200 - 300 μ...|$|E

40|$|Concerning {{the effect}} of ATP on fresh <b>striated</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>fibers</b> and the {{mechanism}} of its effect {{there have been some}} investigations but the results of those researches do not necessarily agree. With the object of clarifying this point, I started detailed research on {{the effect of}} ATP on frog's rectus muscle and acquired the following results : 1) When ATP is applied to the rectus muscle, we can perceive wide differences among individuals; some of them. do not contract at all, but concerning those examples which contract, we notice that they contract little by little after a brief latent period. 2) This contraction can be markedly increased by vagostigmine and is perfectly inhibited by atropine. 3) When the same ATP solution is repeatedly applied to the same muscle, the contracting power of this ATP solution becomes increasingly stronger, and this ATP solution has the power of contracting those rectus muscles which do not contract in a fresh ATP solution. 4) In the rectus muscles after the application of ATP solution, irrespective of the existence of contraction, contracture by means of acetylcholine remarkably increases. From the results mentioned above we realize that the contraction effect of ATP on fresh <b>striated</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>fibers</b> does not come from the supposed direct action of ATP on actomyosin in the muscle but from the cooperation of the isolated acetylcholine or some other substance like acetylcholine in the muscle and the increased excitation susceptibility of the muscle...|$|R

In normal tissue, CD 56 was expressed in thin nerve fibers, fine varicose and sensory nerve endings, cell membranes of ganglion cells, and fetal <b>striated</b> <b>muscle</b> cells. Thick nerve fibers, perikarya of ganglion cells, and adult <b>striated</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>fibers</b> were CD 56 negative. In the normal state, CD 57 was restricted to thick nerve fibers.

40|$|ABSTRACT The late after-potential {{that follows}} trains of impulses in frog <b>muscle</b> <b>fibers</b> is {{virtually}} absent {{when most of}} the intracellular potassium is replaced by rubidium and the muscle is immersed in rubidium-containing Ringer's fluid. Its amplitude is also reduced in freshly dissected, potassiumcontaining <b>muscle</b> <b>fibers</b> that are immersed directly in Rb-Ringer's fluid. These findings are discussed in terms of the model for muscle membrane of Adrian and Freygang (1962 a, b) and in relation to the report of Adrian (1964) that Rb-containing <b>muscle</b> <b>fibers</b> do not exhibit the variations in potassium permeability as a function of membrane potential that are found in fibers with normal intracellular potassium concentration immersed in Ringer's fluid. Adrian (1964) found that the replacement of intracellular potassium by rubidium in frog <b>striated</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>fibers</b> removes the increase in membrane conductance that is normally found with increasing hyperpolarization (anomalous rectification). The voltage-dependent changes in membrane conductanc...|$|R
40|$|The {{distribution}} of peptide-containing nerve fibers in the pharyngeal region of rabbits was studied by immunocytochemistry. Neuropeptide Y (NPY) -containing fibers were numerous around {{blood vessels and}} moderate in number among bundles of <b>striated</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>fibers.</b> A few NPY-containing fibers were seen around seromucous glands and beneath the epithelium. Nerve fibers containing vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) were numerous around seromucous glands and moderate in number around blood vessels, bundles of muscle, and in the subepithelial layer. A few nerve fibers containing substance P (SP) were seen around blood vessels, seromucous glands, among bundles of muscle, and in the subepithelial layer. Nerve fibers containing calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) were numerous. They were distributed close to blood vessels, among bundles of muscle, in the subepithelial layer, and within the epithelium. A conspicuous finding was the occurrence of CGRP within motor end plates of <b>striated</b> <b>muscle...</b>|$|R
40|$|Transgenic mice overexpressing {{transforming}} {{growth factor}} a (TGF-a) under {{control of the}} metallothionein promoter had, on average, 20 % redudions in body and carcass weights compared to nontransgenic littermates. This loss resulted from significant decreases in the comparative weights of bone, muscle, and especially fat. Transgenic epididymal fat pads were reduced by 40 - 80 %, and total body fat content by 50 %, relative to control animals. Distal hindlimb muscle weights were 20 % below normal, and other skeletal muscles were visibly smaller in size. Weight reductions were accompanied by decreases in the cellularity of transgenic fat pads and muscles and by decreases in the number and area of <b>striated</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>fibers.</b> Thes...|$|R
40|$|The {{membranes}} {{limiting the}} tubules and vesicles of the endoplasmic reticulum appear, in general, {{to be of}} uniform thickness and without pores, discontinuities, or other specialization of structure. Some of these membranes support populations of ribosomes and {{are referred to as}} rough; others are particle free and are referred to as smooth. The membranous system in <b>striated</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>fibers,</b> the sarcoplasmic reticulum or SR, is mostly of the latter type. Small areas of it may support ribosomes, but these are relatively rare. In this respect, then, the SR is not exceptional. In other ways it is unique. There is, for instance, the remarkable organization in phase with the sarcomeric structure of the fibrils. Thus, opposit...|$|R
40|$|In hand {{reconstructive}} surgery the palmaris longus muscle {{is one of}} the most utilized donor site for tendon reconstruction procedures. However, its anatomic position is variable and anatomic variations may be responsible for median nerve compression. We report the case of a 40 -year-old, right-handed woman, who presented with numbness and paresthesias in the palm and in the flexor aspect of the first, second, and third fingers of her right hand for the preceding 5 months, coinciding with increase of office work (typing). The clinical examination and radiological investigations (ultrasound and magnetic resonance) revealed a subcutaneous mass (15 mm x 2. 3 mm x 6 cm), with a lenticular shape and definite edges at the level of the volar aspect of the distal third of the forearm. The fine-needle aspiration biopsy revealed the presence of <b>striated</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>fibers.</b> During surgery, a muscle belly was found in the epifascial plane. This muscle originated from subcutaneous septa in the middle forearm and inserted on to the superficial palmar aponeurosis with fine short tendon fibers. Exposure of the antebrachial fascia did not reveal any area of weakness or muscle herniation. The palmaris longus tendon, flexor digitorum superficialis tendons, and flexor carpi radialis tendon showed usual topography under the antebrachial fascia. The accessory muscle was excised and histology revealed unremarkable <b>striated</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>fibers,</b> limited by a thin connective sheath. The presence of an accessory palmaris longus (APL) located in the epifascial plane could be ascribed to an unusual migration of myoblasts during the morphogenesis. Although extremely rare, APL is worth bearing in mind as a possible cause of median nerve compression and etiology of a volar mass in the distal forearm...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of membrane ionic conductances of rat extensor digitorum longus (EDL) <b>muscle</b> <b>fibers</b> was studied in vitro using intracellular recordings. At 7 - 8 days after birth, the potassium conductance (GK) dominated the total membrane conductance while the chloride conductance (GCl) was very low. A rapid increase of GCl towards adult values was observed after few days (12 - 14 day old rats), whereas GK did not decrease up to day 23. Denervation at 7 - 8 days after birth suppressed the maturation of the electrical parameters measured, and 15 {{days after the}} nerve crush, GCl was just detectable. These {{results suggest that the}} maturation of the electrical properties, and in particular that of the resting chloride conductance in mammalian <b>striated</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>fibers,</b> occurs during the first weeks of postnatal life and is dependent on innervation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Highly {{organized}} {{structures are}} {{a defining feature of}} biological tissues, from vascular and neural networks to hexagonal liver lobules and <b>striated</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>fibers.</b> This spatial organization of cells and their surrounding extracel-lular matrix (ECM) {{is an essential}} aspect to the development, maintenance, and function of tissues and organs. We discuss available strategies that have been developed for spatially arranging cells within ECM environments—by patterning cell–ECM and cell–cell adhesion, soluble cues, and substrate mechanical properties—and how such strategies can subse-quently affect cell and tissue function. These approaches to recreate organized structures in vitro ultimately will {{play a key role in}} engineering the recapitulation of tissue function and thereby further efforts in regenerative medicine.

40|$|Histological {{examination}} of a 22 -month-old CD- 1 mouse revealed a threefold {{enlargement of the}} right trigeminal ganglion. This change {{was due to the}} presence of well-differentiated <b>striated</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>fibers</b> intermingling with nerves and ganglion cells. The number of ganglionic Schwann cells was also increased as demonstrated by their positive S- 100 protein staining. In addition, slight interstitial mononuclear cell infiltration and fibrosis were observed. The myocytes, which stained positive for myoglobin and desmin, and the proliferated Schwann cells did not show any signs of cellular or nuclear atypia. The lesion was diagnosed as "neuromuscular hamartoma" (benign "Triton" tumor) " reflecting the capability of either Schwann cells or neural crest derived precursor cells to differentiate into various other cell types...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} further {{investigate}} the deleterious effects of GH overexpression, we generated a novel line of transgenic mice featuring stable and specific expression of bovine GH {{in the heart}} and <b>striated</b> <b>muscle.</b> A DNA construct, containing a region with promoter activity from the Long Terminal Repeat of Rous Sarcoma Virus (RSV-LTR) and the entire structural gene of bovine GH (bGH), was microinjected by standard techniques in male pronuclei of fertilized mice eggs. Transgenic mice expressed bGH mRNA in the heart and <b>striated</b> <b>muscle</b> starting at 5 - 6 weeks of age. They featured circulating levels of a 22 kDa form of bGH up to 700 ng/ml and enhanced growth starting at 6 weeks of age. No pathologic changes of the myocardium and <b>striated</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>fibers,</b> other than hypertrophy, were noticed, although severe glomerulosclerosis and liver alteration occurred in older mice. Future studies on this new line of transgenic GH mice and integration with the existing data might improve {{our understanding of the}} molecular mechanism underlying the detrimental effects of elevated GH levels on various organs and functions...|$|R
