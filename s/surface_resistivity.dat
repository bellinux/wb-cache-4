The {{chloride}} conductivity test (CCT) is a South African-developed Durability Index (DI) test {{used for}} the evaluation and quantification {{of the quality of}} concrete cover.

The <b>surface</b> concrete <b>resistivity</b> test is an electrochemical test that has a good correlation with the concrete chloride diffusion process. The <b>surface</b> concrete <b>resistivity</b> test is used as a quick way to determine the durability of concrete.

The study also compared and contrasted <b>surface</b> concrete <b>resistivity</b> with CCT, using results from previous work, in terms of their application in the design of RC structures. Thereafter, the study investigated the relationship between <b>surface</b> concrete <b>resistivity</b> and CCT. The study was carried out by comparing laboratory and field <b>surface</b> concrete <b>resistivity</b> with CCT results. Then, corrosion initiation periods (CIP’s) and diffusion coefficients were estimated using Mackechnie’s (1996) CCT SLP model as well as <b>surface</b> concrete <b>resistivity</b> models by Andrade (2004) and Baroghel-Bouny et al. (2009). Input parameters for the model such as <b>surface</b> concrete <b>resistivity</b> and CCT results were based on measurements from a previous study. It was found that moisture gradients, chloride contamination and temperature gradients easily influence concrete electrical resistivity testing done in-situ. The input parameters for the <b>surface</b> concrete <b>resistivity</b> models were restricted to laboratory results. The analysis revealed that for blended cement concrete, w/b ratio has a greater influence on chloride conductivity than binder type. It was observed that using a different binder type has a greater influence on <b>surface</b> concrete <b>resistivity</b> at a high w/b ratio than a low one. In addition, decreasing the w/b ratio for GGBS concrete is more effective than decreasing it for FA concrete in influencing the <b>surface</b> concrete <b>resistivity.</b> Andrade’s <b>surface</b> concrete <b>resistivity</b> SLP model resulted in similar CIP values as the CCT model for CEM I only concrete and slag concrete at 0. 40 w/b.

During the production of cement, {{a significant amount of}} carbon dioxide is released to the environment. As the world is moving towards a more sustainable environment, the durability of concrete becomes a concern. The durability of concrete can be improved with proper quality control and resistivity measurement is one of the methods used to indicate the quality of concrete. Because of the importance of resistivity, the present study is to achieve {{a better understanding of the}} electrical resistivity of concrete. The effect of various concrete mixtures to concrete resistivity is examined in this study. For the evaluation, <b>surface</b> <b>resistivity</b> is measured on 150 mm concrete cubes. The concrete mixtures involves different combination of paste volume, W/C ratio, curing condition and supplementary cementitious materials / fillers. The supplementary cementitious materials are pulverised fuel ash (PFA), condensed silica fume (CSF) and the filler is limestone fines (LF). While PFA and CSF are used as cement replacement, the LF is used for the substitution of cement paste. The results have indicated that the electrical resistivity is affected by the paste volume, W/C ratio, curing condition and the combination of PFA, CSF and LF. Concrete resistivity increases as a result of a decrease in paste volume. A strong correlation exists between the W/C ratio and the <b>surface</b> <b>resistivity.</b> The R^ 2 = 0. 9211 and 1 for 30 % and 34 % paste volume respectively. Also, the curing condition affect the moisture content of the concrete. The <b>surface</b> <b>resistivity</b> is higher for a drier surface. With the addition of PFA, CSF and LF, the <b>surface</b> <b>resistivity</b> increases significantly. The present study also examines the correlation between <b>surface</b> <b>resistivity</b> and different concrete properties such as compressive strength, moisture content, water penetration and rapid chloride penetration. The results shows that there is a strong correlation between <b>surface</b> <b>resistivity</b> and compressive strength for plain mixtures with R^ 2 = 1. However, this correlation decrease with the addition of other cementitious materials. As a result, the correlation would be better for a separated resistivity curve for different cementitious materials. The <b>surface</b> <b>resistivity</b> and the water penetration only has a moderate correlation. For plain mixtures, the correlation value is R^ 2 = 0. 6814. R^ 2 = 0. 7069 is the correlation value for concrete mixtures with PFA and CSF.

The research results indicate that KCl doped has a great effect upon Cu 2 O crystal morphology, thus, making Cu 2 O thin film <b>surface</b> <b>resistivity</b> drop, and the open-circuit voltage increase and that electric conduction types are transformed from p type into n type, and the visible light (400 - 500 nm) absorption rate is slightly reduced.

40|$|Graduation date: 2017 The {{first goal}} of this master’s thesis was to {{investigate}} the linkage between a non-destructive testing method, <b>surface</b> <b>resistivity,</b> and premature concrete deterioration brought on by chloride ingress and/or freeze-thaw cycling. The experimental method for this project consists of taking <b>surface</b> <b>resistivity</b> measurements of reinforced concrete slabs after they were ponded with a magnesium chloride de-icing solution, containing a corrosion inhibitor. Reinforced concrete slabs and companion concrete cylinders also underwent freeze/thaw cycling to observe its effect on <b>surface</b> <b>resistivity</b> in conjunction with exposure to chlorides. Many factors such as internal and ambient temperature and relative humidity affect <b>surface</b> <b>resistivity</b> measurements so this data was also collected. To compare the <b>surface</b> <b>resistivity</b> to the rate of chloride ingress, cores were taken from the slabs. As expected, the <b>surface</b> <b>resistivity</b> of the concrete slabs initially increased while the concrete cured and lost moisture due to the hydration process and to the environment. Once ponding of the chloride solution started, however, there began to be a decrease in <b>surface</b> <b>resistivity.</b> This decrease in <b>surface</b> <b>resistivity</b> is believed to be caused by the increase of free chlorides present in the slabs after being saturated with the de-icing solution. The <b>surface</b> <b>resistivity</b> of the corresponding slabs that were ponded with tap water remained constant. These results show that <b>surface</b> <b>resistivity</b> measurements are a potential indicator of chloride ingress and, therefore, may correlate to risk of corrosion in reinforced concrete. The effect of freeze/thaw cycling on <b>surface</b> <b>resistivity,</b> according to this study, is that it increases the <b>surface</b> <b>resistivity.</b> This is due to the micro-cracking in the concrete matrix, caused by the freeze-thaw damage. In the second part of this master’s thesis the corrosion susceptibility of ductile iron pipe (DIP) was investigated. Ductile iron pipe has been used mostly in the water transmission field since the 1950 s. At that time, ductile iron pipe replaced traditional cast iron pipe, due to ductile iron’s superior strength properties. More recently, ductile iron pipe has been considered as a replacement for traditional timber poles for power transmission. While there are benefits to using ductile iron such as its strength and sustainability, ductile iron suffers from pitting corrosion due to the nodular structure of its free graphite. This type of corrosion can lead to severe deterioration of the pipe in localized areas. Due to this, researchers have been studying ductile iron durability and developing solutions for its durability issues. In this research study ductile iron was tested for its susceptibility to corrosion. Samples were subjected to an accelerated corrosion process inside a salt fog chamber. After the samples had corroded, mass loss measurements were taken. Tensile strength tests were also done before and after corrosion. Stainless steel samples were tested alongside the ductile iron for comparison. In addition to the corrosion chamber and strength tests, electrochemical tests were done to characterize the corrosion kinetics of ductile iron. Stainless steel samples showed almost no change in mass loss and tensile strength after corrosion. Ductile iron samples, on the other hand, had a corrosion rate of approximately 52. 6 mpy (1. 3 mmy), and a 10 ksi (69 MPa) decrease in ultimate tensile strength after corrosion. Open circuit potential results showed that the ductile iron samples had a higher potential, and thus, lower corrosion resistance than the stainless steel samples. Similarly, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy showed that stainless steel had a greater impedance than ductile iron, which correlates to increased corrosion resistance. Analysis of cyclic polarization curves showed that the ductile iron samples had much higher corrosion rates than stainless steel samples. However, the corrosion products which formed on the ductile iron samples appeared to be protective in nature. This indicates that ductile iron may have good field performance...|$|E

The {{contents of the}} OGNPs were {{in the range of}} 0. 0 to 5. 0 parts per hundred resin (phr), whilst the dosage of MWCNTs was kept at a constant of 2. 0 [*]wt%. Nanocomposites containing 2. 0 [*]wt% of MWCNTs and mixtures of 2. 0 [*]wt% of MWCNTs at 1. 5 to 5. 0 [*]phr of OGNPs had tribocharged voltages, <b>surface</b> <b>resistivities,</b> and decay times, all within the electrostatic discharge (ESD) specification. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) results revealed that the OGNPs slightly intercalated and distributed also within the PC matrix. The glass transition temperature Tg and heat capacity jump, at the glass transition stages of nanocomposite, slightly changed, as the contents of the OGNPs increased. The melt flow index (MFI) of nanocomposites significantly decreased when MWCNTs were added to the PC resin and slightly changed as the dosage of OGNPs was increased. Tensile Young’s modulus of nanocomposites tended to increase, as the elongation at break and impact strength decreased, when OGNP concentrations were increased. This research work exhibited that OGNP/MWCNT/PC hybrid nanocomposites do indeed have the potential to be used in ESD applications...|$|R
