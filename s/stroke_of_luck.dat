5|$|By a <b>stroke</b> <b>of</b> <b>luck,</b> a thaw {{prevented}} the Chatti from crossing the Rhine {{and coming to}} Saturninus' aid.

5|$|It was at {{this point}} that the team had yet another <b>stroke</b> <b>of</b> <b>luck.</b> Bowen's former thesis advisor at King's College, London, was Edward Appleton, who had worked with Watt and Harold Pye during the 1920s. Pye had since gone on to form his own radio company, Pye Ltd., and was active in the {{television}} field. They had recently introduced a new television set based on an innovative vacuum tube developed by Philips of Holland, the EF50 pentode. Appleton mentioned the Pye design to Bowen, who found it to be a great improvement over the EMI version, and was happy to learn there had been a small production run {{that could be used for}} their experiments. The design became widely known as the Pye strip.|$|E
5|$|John Verbruggen {{was one of}} the {{original}} rebels and had been offered a share in the actors' company, but became disgruntled when his wife Susanna, a popular comedian, was not. For Rich, it was a <b>stroke</b> <b>of</b> <b>luck</b> to get Susanna and John back into his depleted and unskilled troupe. John's availability to play Loveless remained precarious, however. In September, when The Relapse had still not been staged after six months of trying (probably because Rich was still parleying with Cibber about his availability as Lord Foppington), John was still complaining about his employment situation, even getting into a physical fight over it at the theatre. This misbehaviour caused the Lord Chamberlain to declare his contract void {{and at the same time}} order him to stay with the Patent Company until January 1697, to give Rich time to find a replacement. The original Loveless was thus finally guaranteed for an autumn season run of The Relapse. Since the loyal Verbruggen couple always moved as a unit, Susanna's services were also assured.|$|E
50|$|The film {{follows the}} life of lucky and popular Ashley Albright (Lindsay Lohan) who has an {{extremely}} fortunate life and is always experiencing remarkable <b>strokes</b> <b>of</b> <b>luck</b> in contrast to {{the life of}} unlucky and unpopular Jake Hardin (Chris Pine), manager of McFly, who is extremely unsuccessful and followed by bad luck wherever he goes.|$|R

5|$|On 7 January 2006, in an FA Cup third-round tie against Luton Town, Alonso {{assisted}} Liverpool to a 5–3 comeback victory {{after being}} down 3–1 {{early in the}} second half. Alonso scored two impressive goals from distance: one from 45 yards, and the other 65 yards from goal; behind the half-way line. Consequently, Alonso's goals marked a <b>stroke</b> <b>of</b> <b>luck</b> for a Liverpool fan who won £25,000 from a £200 bet on Alonso scoring from within his own half. Alonso suffered an ankle injury in a 1–3 away victory over Portsmouth, putting his participation in the FA Cup final in doubt. However, he recovered sufficiently to start the game against West Ham United and Gerrard scored Liverpool's third goal from Alonso's free kick, pulling the team ahead of the opposition. Alonso, still affected by the injury, could not manage the entire 90 minutes and was substituted in the second half. Liverpool won on penalties without his help but Alonso still earned his first FA Cup winners' medal.|$|E
5|$|Somerset's first {{match of}} the 2009 NatWest Pro40, against Nottinghamshire, ended just one over {{short of the}} {{requirement}} for a match. Chasing 248 to win, Somerset were significantly behind the required rate when rain halted play in the ninth over. The side responded positively to this <b>stroke</b> <b>of</b> <b>luck,</b> winning their next three matches by significant margins, before losing to Essex. Having been put in to bat at Taunton, each of Somerset's top six batsman reached double figures, {{but none of them}} managed to pass 50 and the home side were eventually all out for 205. Despite taking early wickets during Essex's innings—at one stage having the visitors 12/3—the batting of John Maunders, James Foster and Tim Phillips propelled Essex past Somerset's total with five balls remaining. Two further victories ensured that Somerset entered their final match of the season with a chance to win the title.|$|E
5|$|Domitian {{appears to}} have met with several conspiracies during his reign, one of which led to his {{eventual}} assassination in 96. The first significant revolt arose on 1 January 89, when the governor of Germania Superior, Lucius Antonius Saturninus, and his two legions at Mainz, Legio XIV Gemina and Legio XXI Rapax, rebelled against the Roman Empire {{with the aid of}} the Chatti. The precise cause for the rebellion is uncertain, although it {{appears to have}} been planned well in advance. The Senatorial officers may have disapproved of Domitian's military strategies, such as his decision to fortify the German frontier rather than attack, his recent retreat from Britain, and finally the disgraceful policy of appeasement towards Decebalus. At any rate, the uprising was strictly confined to Saturninus' province, and quickly detected once the rumour spread across the neighbouring provinces. The governor of Germania Inferior, Lappius Maximus, moved to the region at once, assisted by the procurator of Rhaetia, Titus Flavius Norbanus. From Spain, Trajan was summoned, whilst Domitian himself came from Rome with the Praetorian Guard. By a <b>stroke</b> <b>of</b> <b>luck,</b> a thaw prevented the Chatti from crossing the Rhine and coming to Saturninus' aid. Within twenty-four days the rebellion was crushed, and its leaders at Mainz savagely punished. The mutinous legions were sent to the front in Illyricum, while those who had assisted in their defeat were duly rewarded.|$|E

5|$|Forgotten {{for nearly}} 13 years, the Changi Murals were accidentally rediscovered in 1958 by {{servicemen}} of the Royal Air Force (RAF) occupying the Roberts Barracks. The Chapel was again {{used as a}} store, and later as accommodation by the RAF. Once rediscovered, the distemper coating covering the murals was carefully removed – four complete murals and the top-quarter of a fifth were revealed. As there was no signature {{on any of the}} murals, a search for the artist was undertaken but failed after initial investigations. By a <b>stroke</b> <b>of</b> <b>luck,</b> the artist's name came to light in the RAF Changi Education Library of all places. A reader came across a book titled The Churches of the Captivity in Malaya, mentioning about the Chapel of St Luke in Roberts Barracks and the artist's name – Bombardier Stanley Warren. The Daily Mirror was notified and again went to work looking for the known artist. In February 1959, he was found living in London with his wife and son. He was shocked when he saw the photo of his mural of the Crucifixion, when a keen-eyed colleague of his showed him the papers.|$|E
25|$|When Kitchener died, the Mail {{reported}} it {{as a great}} <b>stroke</b> <b>of</b> <b>luck</b> for the British Empire. The paper was critical of Asquith's conduct of the war, and he resigned on 5 December 1916. His successor David Lloyd George asked Northcliffe {{to be in his}} cabinet, hoping it would prevent him from criticising the government. Northcliffe declined.|$|E
25|$|Manuel thus {{would have}} {{had every reason to}} worry when he {{received}} a royal order in 1493 to present himself to the king, but his fears were groundless: John II wanted to name him heir to the throne {{after the death of his}} son Prince Afonso and the failed attempts to legitimise Jorge, Duke of Coimbra, his illegitimate son. As a result of this <b>stroke</b> <b>of</b> <b>luck,</b> he was nicknamed the Fortunate.|$|E
5000|$|Tylor stumbles his {{way into}} the United Planets Space Force and soon gains command of a {{destroyer}} after resolving a hostage dispute and saving a retired admiral. Despite being given a decrepit and underpowered ship (the Soyokaze), thanks to brilliant <b>strokes</b> <b>of</b> <b>luck,</b> Tylor manages to destroy a patrol group. This is quickly followed by a sneak attack on another patrol group, performed while Tylor was playing the role of a consummate, professional soldier. The admiralty, attempting to kill Tylor, present him with a medal modified with a device to trick the Raalgon fleet into believing the Soyokaze is an entire fleet. Tylor loses the medal in UPSF HQ, and the Raalgons destroy the admiralty's super-weapon instead.|$|R

In a <b>stroke</b> <b>of</b> cruel <b>luck,</b> he {{was never able to}} participate in a papal conclave - he was the last cardinal to turn eighty prior to the August 1978 conclave, at which, by Pope Paul's decree, cardinals over eighty were excluded.|$|R
50|$|After the expiry of his {{contract}} with Villaggio in 1996, Parenti turned to directing Christmas movies, or cine-panettoni, starring Christian De Sica and Massimo Boldi. Parenti had already experimented {{in this kind of}} movie when he was still working with Villaggio; the first such film he directed was Vacanze di Natale '95 (Christmas Holiday '95) (1995). Further films he made set at Christmas time started with Merry Christmas (2001), and ended with Vacanze di Natale a Cortina (Christmas holidays in Cortina) (2011), which registered the third highest takings in Italy that year. Since then Parenti has directed Colpi di fulmine (Lightning Strikes) (2012) and Colpi di fortuna (<b>Strokes</b> <b>of</b> <b>Luck)</b> (2013). He {{is one of the few}} Italian directors to have stayed within a single genre throughout his career.|$|R
25|$|Although Bunker was {{eventually}} released, he continued {{a life of}} crime. In the early 1970s, Bunker ran a profitable drug racket in San Francisco; he was arrested again when the police, who had put a tracking device on his car, followed him to a bank heist. (The police expected Bunker to lead them to a drug deal and were rather shocked by their <b>stroke</b> <b>of</b> <b>luck.)</b> Bunker expected a 20-year sentence, {{but thanks to the}} solicitations of influential friends and a lenient judge, he got only five years.|$|E
25|$|A <b>stroke</b> <b>of</b> <b>luck</b> came Wetzlar's way in 1689 {{when the}} Holy Roman Empire's highest court, the Reichskammergericht (Imperial Chamber Court) was moved from Speyer to Wetzlar after Speyer had been {{devastated by the}} French in the War of the Palatinate Succession. Besides Vienna (residence of the Emperor) and Regensburg (seat of the Imperial Diet) Wetzlar thus gained a central {{function}} within the Holy Roman Empire and although it remained a tiny town it was {{regarded as one of}} its capitals. The court became the town's main employer; at the Empire's dissolution in 1806, it had a staff of about 150 including 20 judges, while a further 750 derived their income from it.|$|E
25|$|In late 1935, {{he turned}} to Frank C. Bennett, then President of Bennett Oil Corporation, President of Federal Oil of Houston, Texas, and Vice-President of Bennett Oil and Gas of Lake Charles, Louisiana. Merrill's choice of Bennett as an {{investor}} was no accident or <b>stroke</b> <b>of</b> <b>luck,</b> as {{he knew that it}} was common for oil companies to invest in the development of airplanes, and frequently sponsored flights and other events to highlight the performance of their products. After Merrill’s convincing presentation, Bennett joined Merrill in forming the Bennett Aircraft Corporation of Wilmington, Delaware. The aircraft was to be a twin-engine (called bimotored in the 1930s), eight-place mid-wing monoplane with a conventional tail unit and retractable landing gear. It was powered by two wing-mounted Jacobs L-6 engines. The passenger cabin for six passengers was behind the two-crew flight deck.|$|E

The Hive is then destroyed and the survivors are able to retreat back to the ship.|$|R
5000|$|... 2012 {{started on}} a high note: after 11 starts and 6 wins, {{including}} winning the Clipsal 500 Adelaide for the first time, Davison {{was the leader of}} the series, albeit involved in a very tight battle for the championship with Jamie Whincup and his FPR teammate Mark Winterbottom. However, after a <b>stroke</b> <b>of</b> bad <b>luck</b> in the endurance races, despite scoring his maiden Bathurst 1000 pole position, Davison only managed to finish fourth overall.|$|R
25|$|A {{victory in}} their FA Cup fifth-round replay sent Middlesbrough {{into the home}} match with Liverpool with {{optimism}} that their disastrous run of form in the league would finally come to an end, and their hopes came true. Liverpool were riding high in second place, while Boro began the day in second bottom. A <b>stroke</b> <b>of</b> <b>luck</b> put the home side ahead as Xabi Alonso diverted the ball into his own net from a corner. Tuncay doubled the advantage in the second half, and they could have had more as the visitors left themselves open at the back {{as they tried to}} find a way back. Brad Jones kept a fourth consecutive home clean sheet and Boro moved out of the relegation zone with their 2–0 win, while Liverpool had now failed to win at the Riverside for seven seasons.|$|E
25|$|Archduke Charles {{hoped that}} 19 April {{would bring a}} great success. His orders for that morning were for {{the center of his}} army to attack Davout in an effort to trap the French III Corps against the Danube. By a <b>stroke</b> <b>of</b> <b>luck</b> Charles {{obtained}} a copy of Davout's marching orders for the 19th. By 5:00 AM, the Austrian commander issued the marching orders for the day from his headquarters in Rohr in Niederbayern. Charles directed three major columns to intercept the French. He sent the right and center columns northeast toward Langquaid. From there, the right column would pass near Eckmühl (Eggmühl) and turn north for Regensburg where it would rendezvous with General-Major Peter von Vécsey's II Armeekorps brigade. The center column would guide left in the direction of Dünzling. Charles instructed the left column to march via Bachel, Hausen, Teugn, and Bad Abbach.|$|E
25|$|Small Heath {{dominated}} the play against Sheffield United, but visiting goalkeeper William Foulke was on fine form, {{and his team}} had a one-goal lead at the interval. Mobley scored twice in the second half, and both were in controversial circumstances. After a United defender won the ball from Tommy Hands, Hands kicked out at him; the referee turned to have a quick word with Hands, meanwhile the ball fell to Mobley, standing in an offside position, who {{put it in the}} net, and the referee, who had not seen Mobley's offside, awarded the goal. Encouraged by this <b>stroke</b> <b>of</b> <b>luck,</b> Small Heath pressed, and from a Leake cross, Wheldon executed an overhead kick from which the ball rebounded off the crossbar to Mobley, again standing offside, who tapped it in for the winning goal. The victory left them needing only a draw from the final match of the season, at home to Sunderland, to avoid the test matches. In the event, they were outclassed. Though as usual the defence was satisfactory, the forwards' positioning was poor, Hallam and Walton were sadly missed, and they lacked anyone of influence to organise them. A 1–0 defeat, combined with Wolverhampton's 5–0 thrashing of Bolton Wanderers, confirmed Small Heath's participation in the test matches.|$|E
50|$|After this, {{the drivers}} {{seemed to have}} a <b>stroke</b> <b>of</b> good <b>luck</b> during the {{unpredictable}} and exciting 2007 European Grand Prix in which Webber finished 3rd, his second career podium. Coulthard backed it up with a strong 5th which was made all the more impressive by the fact he started 20th on the grid after the team mistakenly kept him in the pits too long resulting in him not being able to complete another qualifying lap.|$|R
50|$|In {{the year}} 1868, with a <b>stroke</b> <b>of</b> both <b>luck</b> and genius, Nobin Chandra altered the oeuvre of Bengali sweets with “Rossogolla” - {{which was to}} be his magnum opus.

Despite the novelty and appeal of his creation, it took some time for Rossogolla to become popular in the absence of advertising and media as we know it today.|$|R

25|$|In {{the summer}} of 425 BC, an Athenian fleet {{commanded}} by Eurymedon and Sophocles, with Demosthenes aboard as an advisor, sailed from Athens to campaign in Sicily and assist Athens' democratic allies at Corcyra. Demosthenes held no official position at the time, but was a strategos-elect for the Hellenic year that would begin in midsummer 425, and the two generals had been instructed {{to allow him to}} use the fleet around the Peloponnese if he wished. Once the fleet was at sea, Demosthenes revealed his plan, which he had previously kept secret; he wished to land at and fortify Pylos, which he believed to be a particularly promising site for a forward outpost. (Pylos was a good distance from Sparta by march, and commanded an excellent harbour in the Bay of Navarino.). The generals rejected this plan, but Demosthenes caught a <b>stroke</b> <b>of</b> <b>luck</b> when a storm blew and drove the fleet to the shore at Pylos. Even then the generals refused to order the fortification of the promontory, and Demosthenes was similarly rebuffed when he attempted to appeal directly to the troops and subordinate commanders; only when the boredom of waiting out the storm overcame the Athenians did they set to work building fortifications. Once they began, however, the Athenians worked hard and quickly, and the promontory was fortified and defensible within a few days. The fleet sailed off towards Corcyra, where a Spartan fleet of 60 ships was operating, leaving Demosthenes with five ships and their complements of sailors and soldiers to defend the new fort.|$|E

The finale reunites the rabbits, but the wily animals win nothing. Mr. Tod and the Uncle Remus stories are only similar in depicting the powerless triumphing over the powerful.|$|E
