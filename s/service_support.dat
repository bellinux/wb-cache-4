5|$|In 1967, the {{division}} was reorganized. As {{part of an}} army wide initiative known as the Reorganization Objective Army Division plan, {{the division}}'s regiments were disbanded and replaced with larger and more versatile brigades. The 1st Brigade, 104th Division, activated at Vancouver Barracks, and the 2nd Brigade, 104th Division activated at Pasco, Washington. Meanwhile, the 3rd Brigade, 104th Division, {{as well as the}} 4th Brigade, 104th Division both activated at Fort Lawton, Washington. Each of these brigades carried the history of other historic units which fought under the 104th Infantry Division in World War II. The 104th Division was then assigned the mission of conducting One Station Unit Training, Basic Combat Training, Advanced Individual Training, and Combat Support training. 1st Brigade took on basic combat training, while 3rd Brigade undertook combat support training, 4th Brigade conducted combat <b>service</b> <b>support</b> training.|$|E
5|$|Other field {{units of}} the brigade were the Armoured Unit, at Camp Ram Rod, Paynesward City (possibly Paynesville), Monrovia), and the Bella Yella Special Detachment, Camp Bella Yella, Lofa. The <b>Service</b> <b>Support</b> Battalion was located at BTC, and {{comprised}} the Medical Company, the Brigade Band, the Brigade Special Unit (a parade unit) and the Military Police Unit.

5|$|With the Reorganization Objective Army Division plan in 1968, the {{division}} {{ceased to be}} centered on regiments and instead was reorganized with brigades. However, with the 199th Infantry Brigade active as a separate brigade, {{the division}}'s new brigades were activated from units that had been under its command in World War II. The division's headquarters element (which had since {{been replaced by a}} Headquarters and Headquarters Company) was redesignated the 1st Brigade, 100th Division responsible for basic armor school training. The 928th Field Artillery Battalion became the 2nd Brigade, 100th Division responsible for armored cavalry unit training. The 325th Engineer Battalion became the 3rd Brigade, 100th Division responsible for combat support training, and the 800th Ordnance Battalion became the 4th Brigade, 100th Division, responsible for combat <b>service</b> <b>support</b> training.|$|E
5|$|A 300-strong Special Operations Task Group (SOTG) was {{subsequently}} deployed {{to support the}} Reconstruction Taskforce in April 2007, including a commando company group, elements of the SASR, and an integral combat <b>service</b> <b>support</b> team. In {{the latter part of}} 2008 the commando company conducted a disruption operation in Helmand province as part of Operation Eagle's Summit, which was a major coalition operation conducted in support of the transport and installation of an additional turbine for the Kajaki Dam hydroelectric facility. In March and April 2009, SOTG killed 80 Taliban fighters in a major four-week operation in Helmand Province, without suffering any casualties. Further operations undertaken include the Battle of Gizab in April 2010, and the Shah Wali Kot Offensive in June 2010, which resulted in heavy insurgent casualties. The bulk of SOTG was withdrawn from Afghanistan in late 2013 as part of a drawdown of Australian forces, although some special forces remained after this date as part of the small Australian force maintained in the country. The Regiment lost 12 personnel killed while deployed to Afghanistan, along with one killed during a pre-deployment exercise.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} Plan Beersheba reorganisation, {{the unit}} {{has become one of}} three Armoured Cavalry Regiments (ACRs) {{assigned}} to the Army's multirole combat brigades in Brisbane, Darwin and Townsville. As an ACR, the unit is equipped with M1A1 tanks, ASLAV light armoured vehicles, and M113 armoured personnel carriers. Under the reforms announced in 2011 and confirmed in the 2013 Defence White Paper, the three Regular Army brigades will be restructured between 2014 and 2017 into three Combat Brigades with a similar structure and capabilities, each consisting of: a Brigade Headquarters, an Armoured Cavalry Regiment, two Standard Infantry Battalions, an Artillery Regiment, a Combat Engineer Regiment, a Combat <b>Service</b> <b>Support</b> Battalion and a Combat Signals Regiment. In 2015 it was reported that the Darwin-based elements of the 1st Armoured Regiment may be transferred to South Australia. In late 2015 one of the 1st Armoured Regiment's two tank squadrons was transferred to the Townsville-based 2nd Cavalry Regiment, with 14 of the tanks relocating.|$|E
