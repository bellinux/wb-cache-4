5|$|In early October 1944, Landis {{checked into}} St. Luke's Hospital in Chicago, {{where his wife}} Winifred had been hospitalized, with a severe cold. While in the hospital, {{he had a heart}} attack, causing him to miss the World Series {{for the first time in}} his commissionership. He {{remained}} fully alert, and as usual signed the World Series share checks to players. His contract was due to expire in January 1946; on November 17, 1944, baseball's owners voted him another <b>seven-year</b> <b>term.</b> However, on November 25, he died surrounded by family, five days after his 78thbirthday. His longtime assistant, Leslie O'Connor, wept as he read the announcement for the press. Landis is buried at Oak Woods Cemetery in Chicago.|$|E
5|$|MacMillan was in {{an awkward}} position. It was widely known that Ashton had been forced out, and many resented it. Company morale was lowered by an announcement, to which MacMillan and Field were party, that the two ballet {{companies}} would merge, with numerous job losses. The managerial side of the post was no more congenial to MacMillan {{than it had been}} in Berlin, and some felt that his creative work suffered during his <b>seven-year</b> <b>term.</b> His expansion of Anastasia into a three-act version (1971) and the other full-length work from this period, Manon (1974), divided opinion, receiving fiercely adverse reviews as well as laudatory ones. His Joplin ballet Elite Syncopations (1974) and Requiem (1976) were immediately successful and have been regularly revived. The latter was dedicated to the memory of Cranko, who had died suddenly in 1973. It was premiered at Stuttgart, because as with Song of the Earth the Royal Opera House board thought the chosen music – Fauré's Requiem – inappropriate for a ballet. The work was not given at Covent Garden until 1983.|$|E

25|$|In 2003, Bongo {{secured a}} change in the Constitution {{allowing}} him to seek re-election as many times as he wanted, and changing the Presidential term to seven years, up from five. Bongo's critics accused him of intending to rule for life. On 27 November 2005 Bongo won a <b>seven-year</b> <b>term</b> as president, receiving 79.2 percent of the vote, comfortably ahead of his four challengers. He was sworn in for another <b>seven-year</b> <b>term</b> on 19 January 2006 and remained president until his death in 2009.|$|E

25|$|McAleese's initial <b>seven-year</b> <b>term</b> {{of office}} ended in November 2004, {{but she had}} {{announced}} on 14 September that she would stand {{for a second term}} in the 2004 presidential election. Following the failure of any other candidate to secure the necessary support for nomination, the incumbent president stood unopposed, with no political party affiliation, and was declared elected on 1 October. She was re-inaugurated at the commencement of her second <b>seven-year</b> <b>term</b> on 11 November. McAleese's very high approval ratings were widely seen as the reason for her re-election, with no opposition party willing to bear the cost (financial or political) of competing in an election that would prove difficult to win.|$|E
25|$|Noel Curran was {{appointed}} Director-General of RTÉ from 1 February 2011 on 9 November 2010 for five years, replacing Cathal Goan who {{had decided not}} to seek an extension to the <b>seven-year</b> <b>term</b> which ended at end of January 2011.

25|$|In 2000, Peres {{ran for a}} <b>seven-year</b> <b>term</b> as Israel's President, a {{ceremonial}} head of state position which usually authorizes the selection of Prime Minister. However, he lost to Likud candidate Moshe Katsav. Katsav's victory was attributed in part to evidence that Peres planned to use the position to support the increasingly unpopular peace processes {{of the government of}} Ehud Barak.|$|E
25|$|The sixth {{member of}} the board still living, Ermer Pondexter, who was absent from the meeting, has stated that Brownlee asked her, on the governor's behalf, to vote for DuMond's parole. This {{represented}} a reversal of Brownlee's positions of August 29, 1996, when he voted against parole, and September 10, 1996, when he voted against recommending executive clemency or pardon. Brownlee would later be reappointed to another <b>seven-year</b> <b>term</b> on the board by Huckabee.|$|E
25|$|The President {{serves as}} head of state, and is elected for a <b>seven-year</b> <b>term</b> and may be re-elected once. The President is {{primarily}} a figurehead, but is entrusted with certain constitutional powers with {{the advice of the}} Council of State. The office has absolute discretion in some areas, such as referring a bill to the Supreme Court for a judgment on its constitutionality. Michael D. Higgins became the ninth President of Ireland on 11 November 2011.|$|E

25|$|The {{office of}} President was {{established}} in 1937, in part {{as a replacement for}} the office of Governor-General that existed during the 1922–37 Irish Free State. The <b>seven-year</b> <b>term</b> of office of the President was inspired by that of the presidents of Weimar Germany. At the time the office was established critics warned that the post might lead to the emergence of a dictatorship. However, these fears were not borne out as successive Presidents played a limited, largely apolitical role in national affairs.|$|E
25|$|The Law on Presidential Elections {{accepted}} {{and put into}} effect on 20 January 2012 decided that presidential elections {{will be held in}} 2014 instead of 2012; within 60 days {{before the end of the}} <b>seven-year</b> <b>term</b> of incumbent President of Turkey Abdullah Gül, who will be the last indirectly elected President of Turkey. As Gül took office on 28 August 2007, the first possible day could be 29 June, but a date between 10 and 17 August is considered more reasonable.|$|E
25|$|The Irish presidential {{election}} of 2004 {{was set for}} 22 October 2004. However, nominations closed at noon on 1 October and the incumbent president, Mary McAleese, who had nominated herself {{in accordance with the}} provisions of the Constitution, was the only person nominated. Accordingly, she was re-elected for a second <b>seven-year</b> <b>term</b> of office without the need to hold an election. This was the third time a president was returned unopposed, following Seán T. O'Kelly in 1952, and Patrick Hillery in 1983. McAleese was re-inaugurated on 11 November 2004.|$|E

25|$|How {{much of his}} <b>seven-year</b> <b>term</b> Hardy served {{is unknown}} and his {{whereabouts}} {{for most of the}} period from 1901-1909 are a mystery. His account of the period makes the claim that he was attached to the staff of the Duke of Connaught and later traveled to Toronto, Ontario, Canada where he became a high-profile editor at a news agency before being falsely accused of forgery and returning to Britain. The lack of documentation makes such a claim difficult to prove, although it was a claim he maintained from 1910 until at least 1920. Other accounts of his life from his family state that he talked of how he had lived in the United States for some time and had been in San Francisco for the famous 1906 earthquake. The claim is difficult to verify and should be believed with caution, especially given that the 1906 earthquake's destruction of the city's records was commonly used as a convenient explanation by criminals to forget their past. 1910 saw Hardy's second <b>seven-year</b> <b>term</b> of imprisonment. He forged a cheque using a simple confidence trick which assured a fellow passenger on a train that Hardy had money in America and could afford to repay a loan. Once invited into her Croydon home, Hardy located her cheque book and forged her signature whilst she was out of the room. He was tried under his then alias of Hall Frankland and again served his time in Dartmoor Prison.|$|E
