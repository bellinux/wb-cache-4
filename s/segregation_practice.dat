40|$|The age {{segregation}} becomes {{reality in}} today's urbanistics. There are cities and settlements {{in which there}} is absolutely no youth, only people of ‘the third age’. The tendency to carry university campuses out of city borders can lead to expansion of an age <b>segregation</b> <b>practice.</b> It is possible to assume that in the process of ‘eviction’ of youth from the city, it will become more conservative, less tolerant and less vital. In different years several projects of Irkutsk State (classical) University campus were proposed assuming location of the campus within the city structure. Recently there have been ideas to locate the campus outside the city line. When discussing options of campus location, it is necessary to consider possible effects of "deyouthification" of the city. </p...|$|E
40|$|Inefficiencies {{during the}} {{management}} of healthcare waste can give rise to undesirable health effects such as transmission of infections and environmental pollution within and beyond the health facilities generating these wastes. Factors such as prevalence of diseases, conflicts, and the efflux of intellectual capacity make low income countries more susceptible to these adverse health effects. The purpose of this systematic review was to describe the effectiveness of interventions geared towards better managing the generation, collection, transport, treatment and disposal of medical waste, {{as they have been}} applied in lower and middle income countries. ^ Using a systematic search strategy and evaluation of study quality, this study reviewed the literature for published studies on healthcare waste management interventions carried out in developing countries, specifically the low and lower middle income countries from year 2000 to the current year. From an initially identified set of 829 studies, only three studies ultimately met all inclusion, exclusion and high quality criteria. A multi component intervention in Syrian Arab Republic, conducted in 2007 was aimed at improving waste <b>segregation</b> <b>practice</b> in a hospital setting. There was an increased use of segregation boxes and reduced rates of sharps injury among staff {{as a result of the}} intervention. Another study, conducted in 2008, trained medical students as monitors of waste <b>segregation</b> <b>practice</b> in an Indian teaching hospital. There was improved practice in wards and laboratories but not in the intensive care units. The third study, performed in 2008 in China, consisted of modification of the components of a medical waste incinerator to improve efficiency and reduce stack emissions. Gaseous pollutants emitted, except polychlorodibenzofurans (PCDF) were below US EPA permissible exposure limits. Heavy metal residues in the fly ash remained unchanged. ^ Due to the paucity of well-designed studies, there is insufficient evidence in literature to conclude on the effectiveness of interventions in low income settings. There is suggestive but insufficient evident that multi-component interventions aimed at improving waste segregation through behavior modification, provision of segregation tools and training of monitors are effective in low income settings. ...|$|E
40|$|Feijoa (Acca sellowiana) is {{a delicious}} fruit {{with a narrow}} window for harvest and a limited postharvest life. In New Zealand, feijoa fruit is {{required}} {{to have at least}} 6 weeks postharvest life in cool storage plus 6 days shelf life under room temperature in order to be exported to global markets. Slightly immature feijoa fruit (maturity stage 2) can be stored for more than 6 weeks plus few days’ shelf life. However, the variation of maturity is large even among individual fruits harvested from the same tree at the same time, and currently, {{there is no way to}} segregate fruit non-destructively based on the internal maturity of feijoa at harvest time. The problem with current industry <b>segregation</b> <b>practice</b> is that the external features of feijoa, such as shape, size, and weight cannot segregate fruit with different maturity. It is inevitably that some more mature fruit will rot quickly and affect overall batch quality during storage. It is vital to have a non-destructive assessment of fruit internal maturity at harvest time. Then fruit with different maturity can be divided into different batches with more mature fruit put on sale on local market and less mature fruit put into storage. As a result, the fruit loss rate and overall fruit quality can be improved. Therefore, in this study, efforts were made to explore a non-destructive method to estimate the internal maturity of feijoa fruit and correlate that maturity with performance during storage. The non-destructive measurements in this experiment included fruit weight, compression firmness, and skin colour. Four feijoa varieties: ‘Kakariki’, ‘Barton’, ‘Anatoki’, and ‘Wiki-Tu’ were selected for this experiment. For each variety, 945 fruit samples were harvested at approximately one week before becoming fully mature (standard commercial harvesting) and sent to the lab in Massey. All the fruit were divided into three groups based on their skin colour (from darkest green to lightest green). 45 fruit (three replicated batches of 15) from each colour group were measured immediately for weight, firmness, maturity, skin colour, Brix, and titratable acidity (TA). Then all the other fruit samples from the same colour group were randomly divided into three groups that were kept in cool storage for 4 weeks, 6 weeks and 8 weeks respectively. Once cool storage was completed, those samples were taken out and firmness and skin colour were measured (non-destructive measurements). Then all the samples were retained at 20 °C. Half of these fruits were assessed for quality attributes 3 days later, and the other half were measured 6 days after cool storage. All fruit were cut open for final visual assessment of maturity according to the maturity index developed by Plant & Food Research Institute. The data of internal maturity and initial fruit quality (weight, firmness, and skin colour) for each fruit was used to draw scatterplots in order to find out the correlation between estimated maturity at harvest, final fruit internal maturity and fruit quality after storage. The correlation (R 2) between internal maturity and compression firmness found on ‘Kakariki’ was 0. 6 to 0. 5. The correlation for ‘Barton’ and ‘Wiki-Tu’ was weaker than that of ‘Kakariki’ (R 2 from 0. 6 to 0. 2). The correlation between firmness and internal maturity for samples of ‘Anatoki’ were weak. The simulated segregation based on firmness for ‘Kakariki’ and ‘Barton’ indicated that the firmness segregation at harvest time could be very useful on eliminating potentially bad fruit during cool storage. A non-destructive method for ‘Kakariki’ and ‘Barton’ fruit based on initial firmness is therefore now available that would allow successful segregation of fruit with potential for long term storage. However, this segregation would not work well on ‘Anatoki’. No significant correlation was found between skin colour, fruit weight and the internal maturity of feijoa fruit either at harvest time or after storage. There was a very large variation in fruit quality at harvest time and during the storage periods. Samples of ‘Wiki-Tu’ indicated that this variety could have the best storage performance among the 4 varieties testes. ‘Anatoki’ may also have a reasonable storage potential with less flavour. The feijoa fruit may not be stored well when covered with polyethylene film, as it may harm the storability of the fruit. Too immature fruit should not be harvested as well, as it would never be able to ripen properly during the postharvest period...|$|E
40|$|Development {{of genetically}} {{modified}} (GM) and specialty crops has had {{a great impact on}} the grain handling industry during recent years. Added costs associated with handling these crops have become an important issue for grain handlers. For this study, data were collected from a survey of elevators in the Upper Midwest. The information focused on <b>segregation</b> <b>practices,</b> time requirements, and costs. This study shows the different costs (grading and handling) associated with <b>segregation</b> <b>practices</b> at the grain-handler level. The results revealed that the cost of modifying systems to handle GM is of major importance. A stochastic simulation model of an engineering cost function is developed to analyze costs for segregation and testing using results from the survey. Assuming no modification is required, the total cost of segregation is about 10 cents per bushel. The volume of grain tested also impacts the total segregation cost per bushel. Finally, the gross elevator margin and the premium for quality seem to be large enough to offset the increase in handling costs due to these new <b>segregation</b> <b>practices.</b> Genetically modified crops, identity preservation, segregation, Crop Production/Industries,...|$|R

30|$|There are {{different}} theoretical approaches {{to explain why}} students from vulnerable groups usually demonstrate low educational achievement (INCLUD-ED, 2008; see also Flecha, 1999).
