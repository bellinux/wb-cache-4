40|$|Abstract — The use of <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> {{devices and}} {{equipments}} are increasing rapidly in electrical systems. Some of these <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>components</b> introduce harmonics in the system. As {{a result the}} signals in electrical systems deviate from being a pure sinusoidal one. Quite often signals become very complex and their equations are unknown. Analysis of these complex signals is mainly accomplished using various kinds of signal analysis tools, like, Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) and Wavelet Transform (WT). But these methods do not provide any information using which an equation of a complex waveform can be determined. S-Transform, an enhancement of STFT and WT, and with improved properties, provides the necessary information which have been employed in this paper to determine the equation of a complex electrical signal...|$|R

In particular, the valley pair qubit in double quantum dots of gapped graphene is investigated as a quantum memory {{in the implementation}} of quantum repeaters.

In detail, my graduate work revolves around the use microfluidics and focuses on creating "Rapid drug delivery devices for insect biorobots, and Optofluidic reconfigurable photonic systems". The first major thrust of my research {{has been in the}} development of a method to directly and reversibly control insect (Manduca sexta moth) flight using implanted microfluidics. The idea is to fuse a living system with a rapid drug delivery component which releases chemical stimulants on command to exert control over the level of neuromuscular activity.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. A fluorimeter was constructed which utilises <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>components.</b> The novel arrangement of these components meant that an inexpensive, sensitive, robust and portable fluorimeter was feasible. If the optical components ofthe instrument were selected for a specific assay, a dedicated fluorimeter with comparable sensitivity to a research grade fluorimeter resulted. The construction and evaluation of such a fluorimeter is described. Nile Red is a hydrophobic phenoxazine fluorescent dye, which has an emission in the long wavelength region of the spectrum (600 - 1000 nm). Assays based on fluorescence measurements in this spectral region have the advantage oflower background, reduced scattering and decreased photodecompostion when compared with conventional fluorescence utilising UVNis wavelengths. Nile Red is also a solvatochromic dye, which means it emission wavelength is strongly dependant on its molecular environment. The property is utilised here {{in the development of}} a novel assay for the protein -lactoglobulin. As the fluorescence properties of the Nile Red:Protein complex differ form those ofthe unbound Nile Red molecule, the fluorescence intensity can be related to concentration of the protein present. The feasibility and development of such an assay is presented as one possible application for the fluorimeter described...|$|R

5000|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, many {{electronic}} manufacturers, such as RCA, General Electric and Admiral, were changing from hand-wired metal chassis in their radios and televisions to printed circuit boards. While circuit boards {{save time and}} errors in assembly, they are not well suited for use with vacuum tube equipment, in which high temperatures are generated that can break down boards, eventually causing the boards to crumble if one attempts to remove a tube. Zenith, {{and to a lesser}} extent Motorola, avoided this problem by continuing to use hand wired chassis in all their vacuum tube equipment. Zenith kept circuit boards out of their televisions until the Chromacolor line of the early 1970s, and even then used them only with <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>components,</b> mounting the four tubes used in the Chromacolor [...] "4 tube hybrid" [...] on the steel chassis. Zenith began using circuit boards in radios when they converted to solid-state in the late 1960s, but even Zenith's early transistor radios were completely hand wired with socketed transistors. Due to the use of this chassis construction (and the high quality components), Zenith televisions and radios of the 1950s to 1970s found today are often still working well, needing little work to restore them to like-new operating condition.|$|R
