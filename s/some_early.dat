5|$|Despite <b>some</b> <b>early</b> adopters, the 808 was a {{commercial}} failure {{and fewer than}} 12,000 units were sold. Roland ended production in 1983 after semiconductor improvements made the faulty transistors that were essential to its design impossible to restock.|$|E

5|$|Acute {{beryllium}} {{disease in the}} form of chemical pneumonitis was first reported in Europe in 1933 and in the United States in 1943. A survey found that about 5% of workers in plants manufacturing fluorescent lamps in 1949 in the United States had beryllium-related lung diseases. Chronic berylliosis resembles sarcoidosis in many respects, and the differential diagnosis is often difficult. It killed <b>some</b> <b>early</b> workers in nuclear weapons design, such as Herbert L. Anderson.|$|E
5|$|Although the Koran {{does not}} mention details of Joseph's burial, Islamic {{tradition}} points to Nablus as being the authentic site. However, <b>some</b> <b>early</b> Islamic geographers identified the Cave of the Patriarchs in Hebron as housing his tomb. While Ali of Herat (1119), Yaqut (1229) and Ibn Battuta (1369) all report the Hebron traditions, they also mention {{the existence of a}} tomb of Joseph at Nablus. Later Muslim chroniclers even mention a third site purporting to be the authentic tomb, near Beit Ijza.|$|E

5|$|An {{international}} {{version of}} the video was also officially released.

5|$|Dracula's Daughter {{was not as}} {{successful}} as the original upon its release, although it was generally critically well-reviewed. In the intervening decades, criticism has been deeply divided. Modern critics and scholars have noted the strong lesbian overtones of the film, which Universal acknowledged {{from the start of}} filming and exploited in <b>some</b> <b>early</b> advertising.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the release}} of their second album, Led Zeppelin {{completed}} several more US tours. They played initially in clubs and ballrooms, and then in larger auditoriums as their popularity grew. <b>Some</b> <b>early</b> Led Zeppelin concerts lasted more than four hours, with expanded and improvised live versions of their repertoire. Many of these shows have been preserved as bootleg recordings. It was {{during this period of}} intensive concert touring that the band developed a reputation for off-stage excess.|$|E

5|$|K–Pg {{boundary}} mammalian {{species were}} generally small, comparable {{in size to}} rats; this small size would have helped them find shelter in protected environments. In addition, it is postulated that <b>some</b> <b>early</b> monotremes, marsupials, and placentals were semiaquatic or burrowing, as there are multiple mammalian lineages with such habits today. Any burrowing or semiaquatic mammal would have had additional protection from K–Pg boundary environmental stresses.|$|E
5|$|LACM 149371 was {{described}} in 2004 by Francisco Goin and colleagues, who tentatively interpreted the tooth as a left last upper molar. Although they saw similarities with South American ungulates, <b>some</b> <b>early</b> rodents, and multituberculates, they believed the tooth was most likely of a gondwanathere. Among gondwanatheres—a small and poorly known group otherwise known from the Cretaceous through Eocene {{of some of the}} southern continents (Gondwana)—they thought the Cretaceous Argentinian Ferugliotherium to be the most similar.|$|E
5|$|Ochre is {{reported}} from <b>some</b> <b>early</b> MSA sites, for example at Kapthurin and Twin Rivers, and is common after c. 100 ka. Barham argues {{that even if}} some of this ochre was used in a symbolic, color-related role then this abstraction could not have worked without language. Ochre, he suggests, could be one proxy for {{trying to find the}} emergence of language.|$|E

5|$|Phellodon was {{circumscribed}} in 1881 by Finnish mycologist Petter Karsten to contain white-toothed fungi. Karsten included three species: P.cyathiformis, P.melaleucus, and the type, P.niger (originally published with the epithet nigrum). P.nigrum was originally described by Elias Fries in 1815 {{as a species}} of Hydnum. <b>Some</b> <b>early</b> authors did not consider Phellodon distinct {{enough to be a}} separate genus, and folded species assigned to this genus into Hydnellum.|$|E
5|$|<b>Some</b> <b>early</b> Christian {{groups had}} {{separate}} {{descriptions of the}} life and teachings of Jesus that {{are not included in}} the New Testament. These include the Gospels of Thomas, Peter, and Judas, the Apocryphon of James, and many other apocryphal writings. Most scholars conclude that these are written much later and are less reliable accounts than the canonical gospels.|$|E
5|$|<b>Some</b> <b>early</b> {{travellers}} found dodo meat unsavoury, {{and preferred}} to eat parrots and pigeons; others {{described it as}} tough but good. Some hunted dodos only for their gizzards, as this was considered the most delicious part of the bird. Dodos were easy to catch, but hunters {{had to be careful}} not to be bitten by their powerful beaks.|$|E

5|$|The 767-200 ceased {{production}} in the late 1980s, superseded by the extended-range 767-200ER. <b>Some</b> <b>early</b> 767-200s were subsequently upgraded to extended-range specification. In 1998, Boeing began offering 767-200 conversions to 767-200SF (Special Freighter) specification for cargo use, and Israel Aerospace Industries has been licensed to perform cargo conversions since 2005. The conversion process entails the installation of a side cargo door, strengthened main deck floor, and added freight monitoring and safety equipment. The 767-200SF was positioned {{as a replacement for}} Douglas DC-8 freighters.|$|E
5|$|The Gracchus brothers, Tiberius and Gaius, were Romans {{who both}} served as tribunes {{in the late}} 2nd century BC. They {{attempted}} to pass land reform legislation that would redistribute the major aristocratic landholdings among the urban poor and veterans, {{in addition to other}} reform measures. After achieving <b>some</b> <b>early</b> success, both were assassinated by enemies of these reforms.|$|E
