40|$|The JT 8 D high {{pressure}} turbine was revised to reduce leakage between the blade tip shrouds {{and the outer}} air seal, and engine testing was performed {{to determine the effect}} on performance. The addition of a second knife-edge on the blade tip shroud, the extension of the honeycomb seal land to cover the added knife-edge and an existing spoiler on the shroud, and a material substitution in the <b>seal</b> <b>support</b> <b>ring</b> to improve thermal growth characteristics are included. A relocation of the blade cooling air discharge to insure adequate cooling flow is required. Significant specific fuel consumption and exhaust gas temperature improvements were demonstrated with the revised turbine in sea level and simulated altitude engine tests. Inspection of the revised seal hardware after these tests showed no unusual wear or degradation...|$|E

40|$|During {{this period}} damping {{measurements}} {{were made on}} the cylindrical graphite epoxy specimen using the forced-vibration test method. The specimen was carefully mounted directly on the shaker through the <b>supporting</b> <b>ring</b> and the impedance head. This was done to simulate an idealized free-free boundary condition at the two edges.

In order to check the damping induced by the <b>supporting</b> <b>ring,</b> measurements were made with {{the top half of}} the ring removed. The specimen then was supported only by the bottom half of the ring (half ring).

40|$|In {{order to}} {{optimize}} the structure of anvils, finite element method is used to simulate two kinds of structures, one of which has a <b>support</b> <b>ring</b> but the other one does not.

40|$|There was an {{incidence}} to {{an aircraft}} wherein after flight, pilot noticed “Decelerate Right Engine” caption on MFWS along with longitudinal thud. Also, there was momentary display of “Right Engine Vibration” caption. Following this, the pilot {{switched off the}} RH engine and the aircraft landed with one engine (port). Boroscopic examination of the affected engine revealed damages in the turbine area, mostly concentrated in and around LP turbine. On strip examination, {{it was found that}} the LPTR blades, and a labyrinth with the LP turbine disc were severely damaged. A few of these damaged components, viz., (a) fractured and dislodged labyrinth <b>support</b> <b>ring</b> of LP turbine disc, (b) fractured and dislodged labyrinth, (c) parts of LPTR disc containing the fracture surface, (d) LPTR blades, and (e) lock and pin of LPTR blades retainer ring were sent to this laboratory for establishing the probable cause(s) of failure. Examination revealed that the damages to LPTR blades were mostly confined to the tip region except for one where the blade had fractured in the airfoil at one-third height from the blade root platform. Evidences suggested that the damages to the LPTR blades were caused due to tip rubbing with the turbine casing. Fractographic examination confirmed that the fracture in all the blades was by overload. None of the blades showed any signatures of progressive failure. The damages on the lock and pin of LPTR blades retainer ring were also found to be secondary in nature. A part of the labyrinth was retrieved from the damaged engine. It was found mangled and separated from the labyrinth <b>support</b> <b>ring</b> with the LP turbine disc. No pins were available with the labyrinth. The fractured ends of the labyrinth were severely damaged. Fractographic examination showed dimple rupture wherever the fracture features were preserved, indicating failure under overload. The labyrinth <b>support</b> <b>ring</b> got completely separated from the LP turbine disc. Again, only a part of this ring was available for examination. But, the entire mating fracture surface of the ring was available with the disc. Fracture surface analysis showed that separation of the labyrinth <b>support</b> <b>ring</b> from the disc was by overload fracture. The force acted on the <b>support</b> <b>ring</b> was in the radial direction from outside to inside. Further examination of the separated labyrinth <b>support</b> <b>ring</b> showed presence of cracks in four pin holes, located in a sector adjacent to each other. The cracks were located at the edge of the holes on the free surface. It was confirmed through scanning electron fractographic study that these cracks were progressive in nature and they had propagated by fatigue mechanism. From the laboratory investigation, it could not be established whether or not these cracks have bearing on the separation of the labyrinth <b>support</b> <b>ring</b> from LP turbine disc. The presence of fatigue cracks, however, does indicate some distress at the pin holes originating either from assembly or during engine run. Considering the overall damages to various components of the engine in and around LP turbine and the laboratory investigation, it appears that the failure in the labyrinth was due to some location specific problem(s). Analysis also suggests that the overload fracture of labyrinth <b>support</b> <b>ring</b> is indicative of sudden overload on this component during the engine run. Although it was not possible to establish as to what caused this sudden overload, it is believed that the detachment of labyrinth <b>support</b> <b>ring</b> was the first in the chain of events that led to engine failure. In view of this, it is suggested that various possibilities that could lead to sudden overload on the labyrinth <b>support</b> <b>ring</b> of the LP turbine disc be investigated. It also needs to be investigated whether or not there could be any common cause(s) which is responsible for generation of fatigue cracks at the pin holes as well as the separation of the labyrinth <b>support</b> <b>ring</b> from LP turbine disc. Laboratory test results showed that the materials used for fabrication of the components in question conform to specification in terms of chemical composition. No comments can be offered on the microstructure and hardness parameters because of the insufficient data made available to this laboratory. However, based on the overall understanding of the failure, any metallurgical abnormality leading to separation of the labyrinth <b>support</b> <b>ring</b> appears to be a remote possibility...|$|R

50|$|For {{the basic}} process only a {{thin-walled}} cylinder and <b>supporting</b> elements (<b>supporting</b> <b>rings)</b> which are positioned {{on the inside}} surface of the cylinder are needed. When the cylinder is put under an exterior pressure, the material between the <b>supporting</b> <b>rings</b> is pushed inwards. After reaching a critical but still considerably small exterior pressure (instability point), rectangular vault structures are formed spontaneously. This effect is called in the jargon as „buckling“. The circumferential, straight folds arise by the underlying supporting elements, while the axial folds develop all by themselves (self-organization) in a staggered way without an underlying tool.|$|R
