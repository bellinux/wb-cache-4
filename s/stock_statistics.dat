After documenting that cross-country linkages were different in "tranquil" and "turbulent" times within our sample, we find that: (i) for stock markets, recent episodes of market turbulence stood out from preceding ones as they showed an increased sensitivity of Latin American markets to U. S. shocks, reversing a trend of weakening linkages; (ii) currency markets in Latin America exhibited a decrease in cross-market linkages with the U. S. during the last episodes of volatility, consistent with increased exchange rate flexibility in the region; and (iii) the external bond markets in Latin America remained on a trend of weakening linkages with U.

It constructs a new firm level data set covering emerging and developed markets and estimates a simple factor model, which breaks down stock returns into a global business cycle factor, global industry factors, country-specific factors and firm-level effects. The results indicate that the share of variation in stock returns explained by global industry factors has grown sharply since the mid- 1990 s, at the expense of country-specific factors. Foremost among the global factors is a “new economy” factor, which has become a key determinant of global stock returns.

Given an HTML data source, we would like {{to find a way to}} create an underlying data structure that is type-safe and well formulated. We are motivated to study these problems for a variety of reasons.

We seek a means to get this data, using free data feeds, so that we can perform data mining functions. Secondly, we find that easy to parse data enables us to teach our students the basic concepts of data mining. This example is used in a first course in network programming. 2 FINDING THE DATA Finding the data on-line and free is a necessary first step toward this type of data mining.

The European Union has imposed important reduction of specific energy consumption in all sectors, but energy conservation in buildings remains a key element in obtaining the sustainable development as evidence of human solidarity beyond the limits of space and time. In this paper the importance of the energy reductions in the building sector is outlined and both the energy policy and building <b>stock</b> <b>statistics</b> in EU and Romania are presented.

40|$|Excerpt] Observers of the U. S. {{media have}} grown {{accustomed}} to the perennial debate over whether the news leans left or right. Yet there is scant disagreement that discussion of ordinary work issues is absent in public discourse; that workers and their unions are practically invisible even in economic news; and that most news coverage about unions concerns strikes, corrupt leaders, or, more recently, splits in labor’s ranks. Christopher Martin’s highly readable book, Framed: Labor and the Corporate Media, deepens that observation {{through the application of}} media framing theory, originally developed by political media scholar Doris Graber in the 1970 s. Quoting Todd Gitlin, Martin defines media frames as “persistent patterns of cognition, interpretation and presentation, of selection, emphasis and exclusion, by which symbol-handlers routinely organize discourse, whether verbal or visual. ” Embattled union members encounter framing when every airline walkout becomes a media narrative of stranded travelers versus callous strikers, and every press story employment focuses on <b>stock</b> <b>statistics...</b>|$|E

30|$|Measuring {{migration}} {{is a difficult}} statistical and demographic exercise. Statistics on immigration and emigration flows, where they exist, are generally unreliable. Indeed, they require costly administrative and supervisory bodies, which few states are capable of, or are prepared to implement. To measure the migration phenomenon, it is considered preferable in this context to work on <b>stock</b> <b>statistics</b> rather than flow statistics. For this purpose, population censuses are widely used, although they are still poorly adapted to this use because of the temporal spacing between the holding of two censuses. Spain organizes censuses at intervals of 10 [*]years. 1 This time window is far too large to measure migratory phenomena, which may also be somewhat cyclical. Moreover, the definition of migration may vary between one census to another, which complicates international comparisons and sometimes even national comparisons between two dates (Poulain, Perrin, and Singleton, 2006). Surveys remain an interesting alternative, but few of them take place {{on a regular basis}} and with consistent use of definitions. Finally, population registers, where they exist, offer an interesting solution since they record continuously (or at least annually) the current population and its movements.|$|E

The same modeling approach is applied to model aggregate hourly district heat consumption in three different consumer groups located in Oslo.

40|$|This article empirically {{examines}} {{the association between}} earnings management and initial public offering (IPO) performance (underpricing and post-issue stock performance) of Chinese small and medium enterprises (SMEs). The analysis {{is based on a}} sample of 464 IPOs listed on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange (SZSE) SME board during 2006 - 2010. Consistent with our expectations, this article finds that a higher level of total discretionary accruals prior to the IPO is associated with a higher level of underpricing and poorer long-term stock performance. However, when total discretionary accruals are decomposed into current and long-term accruals, the associations are insignificant. The results are robust with respect to several alternative measures of earnings management and <b>stock</b> performance. <b>Statistics</b> also show, on average, Chinese SMEs have positive 3 -year long-term stock returns relative to various benchmarks, and only firms with incomeincreasing accruals suffer long-term underperformance.

Introduction: A {{survey of the}} history of the sheep {{industry in}} Kansas reveals some interesting facts that are difficult to explain. At the close of the year 1872 there were according to carefully compiled statistics 39773 sheep in the state. This number gradually increased until in 1878 there were 243, 760, in 1880 426492, and in 1883 the maximum number, 1, 154, 196 was reached. Then commenced a steady decrease in the number of sheep within the border of our state, and although the valuation of all live stock increased during the eighteen years beginning in 1883 and ending 1901, from 104 million to 155 million dollars, and the value of live stock products from 32 million to 74 million dollars, we find at the close of the year 1902 only 136, 743 sheep in the state of Kansas. During the eighteen years above mentioned the number of milk cows was doubled, the number of other cattle doubled, the number of horses doubled, and the number of swine greatly increased. There were, however, only one-ninth as many sheep in the state in the year 1902 as were present in 1883. Since the year 1902 the number has begun to increase, and according to the report of 1904 there were more than 167 thousand sheep in Kansas. Since the live <b>stock</b> <b>statistics</b> of other states reveal no such fluctuation in the number of sheep as do Kansas statistics, there would seem to be some peculiarity in the conditions found in our state that renders sheep raising and sheep feeding unprofitable.

The results showed sales growth variable has positive and significant impact on Price Earning Ratio, ROE and ROI and variable negative and significant effect on the Price Earning Ratio, while variable DER had no effect on Price Earning Ratio, sales growth simultaneously, DER, ROE. dan ROI positive effect on the Price Earning Ratio. Based on these results, then the Sales Growth, DER, ROE, ROI can be used as indicators (benchmarks) in conducting an assessment of the high-low Price Earnings Ratio at a manufacturing company and for making investment decisions...|$|R
40|$|Monte Carlo {{simulation}} from probability distributions {{is often}} favored {{as a means}} of quantifying the uncertainty in the results of a population analysis. Observed data are combined with simulations from a population model using subjective distributions for model parameters for which no data are available. The results from such methods can unfortunately be inaccurate unless care is taken in the combination of these simulations and the observed data. A Monte Carlo method was proposed at the 1996 meeting of the Scientific Committee of the International Whaling Commission for the assessment of the Bering-Chukchi-Beaufort Seas stock of bowhead whales. We show that this method is potentially inaccurate, and as such, it appears to be unsuited to the bowhead application and thus possibly to other similarly structured management problems. KEY WORDS: <b>statistics,</b> <b>stock</b> assessment, Monte Carlo simulation, biological parameter uncertainty, bootstrap. 1 Introduction The variability in parameter e [...] ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis article aims {{to analyze}} the use of capital {{budgeting}} practices by large Brazilian companies. The survey technique was used for data collection in 51 companies traded on the <b>Stock</b> Exchange. Descriptive <b>statistics</b> were applied, aiming to improve the basis for discussions. The correlation {{was used to assess}} the theoretical assumptions of the research. The results show that companies adopt especially the Payback Period, the Net Present Value and the Internal Rate of Return in the assessment of capital budgeting, with scenario and sensitivity analyses to examine the investment risk. The assessment of theoretical assumptions developed in the study has shown that there is no relationship of cause and effect among the variables to explain the use of more sophisticated budgeting practices. Based on similar studies, it is concluded that there is a general trend of increasing sophistication in the various stages of investments budget in large Brazilian companies...|$|R
40|$|Risk management, as a {{business}} practice in developing and emerging nations, is an under-researched area. The aim {{of this paper is}} to contribute to the development of risk management theory and practice by examining the determinants of the integration of risk management within public shareholding organizations in an Arab country, Jordan. A survey strategy was used and questionnaires were distributed to Jordanian organizations listed on the Amman <b>Stock</b> Exchange. Parametric <b>statistics</b> such as Pearson’s correlation coefficient and analysis of variance were used to achieve the aim and objectives, which were all related to risk management practice and its wider implications for general management. The main finding of this research is that the level of integrated risk management within many Jordanian organizations is variable, but that it is significantly correlated with the type of industry; financial organizations are more likely to be involved in risk management than service or industrial organizations...|$|R
