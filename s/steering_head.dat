5|$|Motorcycle {{engineer}} Norbert Riedel {{recognized the}} need for a simple and economical light motorcycle during Germany's recovery from the Second World War and began to design one. By the summer of 1947, a prototype frame had been built and tested. The spine frame was made from 40mm steel tubing, as were the <b>steering</b> <b>head,</b> the single-sided front fork, and the single-sided swingarm. The wheels were interchangeable, and were mounted from the left on stub axles attached to the suspension on the right.|$|E
25|$|The Tonti {{frame was}} {{engineered}} for stiffness using short, straight tubes working {{well with the}} engine design and allowing the main backbone {{to pass through the}} cylinder splay and connect the <b>steering</b> <b>head</b> to the swingarm in the shortest possible distance.|$|E
25|$|Touring {{models are}} {{distinguishable}} by their large saddlebags, rear coil-over air suspension {{and are the}} only models to offer full fairings with radios and CBs. All touring models use the same frame, first introduced with a Shovelhead motor in 1980, and carried forward with only modest upgrades until 2009, when it was extensively redesigned. The frame is distinguished by {{the location of the}} <b>steering</b> <b>head</b> in front of the forks and was the first H-D frame to rubber mount the drivetrain to isolate the rider from the vibration of the big V-twin.|$|E
50|$|The {{administration}} of the AMA {{is in charge of}} a <b>Steering</b> Committee <b>headed</b> by a chairman. It is elected by the majority of the members present at the Ordinary General Assembly.|$|R
25|$|Helm orders or {{commands}} {{fall into}} two categories: rudder commands and heading commands. A rudder command dictates changing {{the angle of the}} rudder, which is a single-event action. Whereas <b>steering</b> a <b>heading</b> is a comparatively long event and will require ongoing or continuous rudder adjustments.|$|R
50|$|Project Tiger is {{administered}} by the National Tiger Conservation Authority. The overall administration of the project is monitored by a <b>steering</b> committee <b>headed</b> by a director. A field director is appointed for each reserve, who is assisted by a group of field and technical personnel.|$|R
25|$|In the mid-1980s, Lamborghini {{produced}} a limited-production run of a 1,000cc sports motorcycle. UK weekly newspaper Motor Cycle News reported in 1994 – when featuring an example available through an Essex motorcycle retailer – that 24 examples were produced with a Lamborghini alloy frame having adjustable <b>steering</b> <b>head</b> angle, Kawasaki GPz1000RX engine/transmission unit, Ceriani front forks and Marvic wheels. The bodywork was plastic and fully integrated with front fairing merged into fuel tank and seat cover {{ending in a}} rear tail-fairing. The motorcycles were designed by Lamborghini stylists and produced by French business Boxer Bikes.|$|E
25|$|The engine {{mounting}} was substantially different. Instead of being suspended from an alloy cradle {{as on the}} Mark A and B, the engine now sat in a steel cradle bolted to a steeply inclined steel tube that pivoted directly behind the engine through an alloy <b>steering</b> <b>head</b> bracket. This bracket, holding the engine and front wheel unit is bolted to a cast alloy bulkhead which forms a major structural component of the car. The {{engine mounting}} {{was said to have}} been a regular source of failures on both the Mark A and the Mark B, and this new design was again the work of Granville Bradshaw.|$|E
2500|$|In mid 1928 the Scout Series 101 {{replaced}} the original Scout. Designed by Charles B. Franklin, who had designed the original Scout, the 101 Scout {{had a new}} frame with more fork rake, a longer wheelbase, and a lower seat height. The geometry of the 101 Scout wheelbase, <b>steering</b> <b>head</b> angle and rear sub-frame were all adopted from the new Indian 401 model which was under development at the same time. [...] The standard Scout 101 was available with a [...] engine, {{but it was also}} available with a [...] engine from the original Scout, although this was rarely advertised.|$|E
50|$|Helm orders or {{commands}} {{fall into}} two categories: rudder commands and heading commands. A rudder command dictates changing {{the angle of the}} rudder, which is a single-event action. Whereas <b>steering</b> a <b>heading</b> is a comparatively long event and will require ongoing or continuous rudder adjustments.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Steering</b> Committee, <b>headed</b> by the ECBC Chairman, and {{composed}} {{of representatives from}} the major covered bond issuing jurisdictions and industry experts, {{is responsible for the}} day-to-day activities of the ECBC. The Steering Committee convenes once every quarter and addresses strategy related questions and coordinates the agendas of the various ECBC working groups (see below).|$|R
3000|$|... where Δ> 0 is {{a design}} {{parameter}} {{known as the}} look-ahead distance. The idea is that <b>steering</b> the <b>head</b> angle of the snake robot such that it is headed towards a point located at a distance Δ ahead of the robot along the desired path will make the snake robot move towards the path and follow it.|$|R
60|$|I {{have been}} sweated not only {{out of my}} pleuritic fever, but out of all my eating cares, and {{the better part of}} my brains (strange coincidence!), by aconite. I have that {{peculiar}} and delicious sense of being born again in an expurgated edition which belongs to convalescence. It will not be for long; I hear the breakers roar; I shall be <b>steering</b> <b>head</b> first for another rapid before many days; NITOR AQUIS, said a certain Eton boy, translating for his sins a part of the INLAND VOYAGE into Latin elegiacs; and from the hour I saw it, or rather a friend of mine, the admirable Jenkin, saw and recognised its absurd appropriateness, I took it for my device in life. I am going for thirty now; and unless I can snatch a little rest before long, I have, I may tell you in confidence, no hope of seeing thirty-one. My health began to break last winter, and has given me but fitful times since then. This pleurisy, though but a slight affair in itself was a huge disappointment to me, and marked an epoch. To start a pleurisy about nothing, while leading a dull, regular life in a mild climate, was not my habit in past days; and it is six years, all but a few months, since I was obliged to spend twenty-four hours in bed. I may be wrong, but if the niting is to continue, I believe I must go. It is a pity in one sense, for I believe the class of work I MIGHT yet give out is better and more real and solid than people fancy. But death is no bad friend; a few aches and gasps, and we are done; like the truant child, I am beginning to grow weary and timid in this big jostling city, and could run to my nurse, even although she should have to whip me before putting me to bed.|$|E
50|$|The engine must be {{positioned}} behind the <b>steering</b> <b>head</b> {{and in front}} of the driver.|$|E
5000|$|In motorcycles, these {{bearings}} {{are also}} referred to as headset, or <b>steering</b> <b>head</b> bearings or steering neck bearings. These are usually tapered roller bearings.|$|E
50|$|The <b>steering</b> committee, <b>headed</b> by Rev. Kawamura, {{brought a}} {{proposal}} to the Lethbridge City Council that was subsequently approved on 6 January 1964. The committee proposed a Japanese Garden Committee be appointed to oversee the garden's construction. By the following summer, the committee was granted official society status and later became the Lethbridge & District Japanese Garden Society.|$|R

5000|$|The FLT Tour Glide was {{introduced}} in 1979 as a 1980 model. [...] Sold alongside the existing FLH Electra Glide, the FLT had a larger frame with rubber engine mounts, a five-speed transmission, the [...] engine, and a frame-mounted fairing. In order that the FLT frame, which was larger and heavier than the large and heavy FLH frame, would handle acceptably, the front forks were given radical steering geometry which had them mounted behind the <b>steering</b> <b>head,</b> with the frame behind the <b>steering</b> <b>head</b> being recessed to allow adequate steering lock.|$|E
50|$|PE250N {{virtually}} identical, {{apart from}} muffler, minor porting and timing changes,Slightly higher compression. Snail-cam adjusters {{to assist with}} new quick-change swing-arm slots. Slightly different <b>steering</b> <b>head</b> angle. Horn/blinkers/battery fitted in Australia, Belgium, South Africa. Improved all-in-one tool.|$|E
50|$|The {{frame was}} a welded aluminium-alloy dual-beam with cast <b>steering</b> <b>head</b> and {{swingarm}} endplates, but with steel-tube engine cradles and swingarm-mount endplates extending back {{to support the}} rider's seat and attach the bolt-on subframe, like the ZZ-R1100.|$|E
50|$|It {{should be}} noted, however, that the stadium's club remains the Juan Carlos Zerillo Stadium, {{which is owned}} by the club. At present, after the <b>steering</b> {{committee}} <b>headed</b> by Gisande arrangements made at the security agency Co.Pro.Se.De enabled the stadium for matches of minor visitor attendance. However, Gimnasia y Esgrima can play home games at the Estadio Ciudad de La Plata if they so decide.|$|R
5000|$|Steering: {{the user}} has to {{constantly}} indicate where to move. Is a common and efficient technique. One {{example of this}} are the gaze-directed <b>steering,</b> where the <b>head</b> orientation determines the direction of travel.|$|R
50|$|The {{governance}} {{structure of the}} Global Labour University network {{is based on the}} partnership between the ILO, the national and international trade union movement, the partner universities and the funding bodies. A <b>steering</b> committee is <b>heading</b> the overall direction.|$|R
50|$|The main {{chassis frame}} must consist of, {{at a minimum}} - a <b>steering</b> <b>head,</b> a frame to {{accommodate}} the engine and a main spar to the sidecar wheel which will be made from good quality steel tube.|$|E
50|$|The Tonti {{frame was}} {{engineered}} for stiffness using short, straight tubes working {{well with the}} engine design and allowing the main backbone {{to pass through the}} cylinder splay and connect the <b>steering</b> <b>head</b> to the swingarm in the shortest possible distance.|$|E
50|$|In {{contrast}} to the Fury, the 2010 Sabre emphasized function over form with a less extreme seating position, narrower handlebar and lower <b>steering</b> <b>head,</b> making the VT1300CS (aka VT13CS) a fairly typical cruiser design, competing with other mid-size cruisers such as the Star Styker. Front forks on the Sabre were shorter {{as a consequence of}} the lower <b>steering</b> <b>head,</b> and so they did not need the large-diameter tubes used on the Fury. The Sabre had slightly more travel in its rear mono-shock and a steel swingarm rather than aluminum, plus a larger fuel tank that incorporated an instrument panel. The VT1300CS wheelbase was about an inch shorter that the Fury's (but 4.5 inches longer than the old VTX1300C).|$|E
5|$|Tiller {{effect is}} the {{expression}} {{used to describe}} how handlebars that extend far behind the <b>steering</b> axis (<b>head</b> tube) act like a tiller on a boat, in that one moves the bars to the right in order to turn the front wheel to the left, and vice versa. This situation is commonly found on cruiser bicycles, some recumbents, and some motorcycles. It can be troublesome when it limits the ability to steer because of interference or the limits of arm reach.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the student delegates {{from each of the}} member schools, the Ivy Council also maintains an Executive Board for day-to-day operations and a Board of Governors for fiscal management and long-term sustenance of the organization. The Executive Board and the Head Delegates of the eight member schools form the <b>Steering</b> Board. <b>Head</b> Delegates are the only members of the Steering Board with the power to vote as they are entrusted to represent their respective schools in the interim between meetings of the Legislative Council.|$|R
50|$|The King's Household (Het Huis van de Koning, La Maison du Roi, Das Haus des Königs) was reorganised in 2006, and {{consists}} of seven autonomous departments and the Court's <b>Steering</b> Committee. Each <b>Head</b> of Department is responsible for his department and is accountable to the King.|$|R
5000|$|A triple tree ("triple clamp" [...] (US) or [...] "yoke" [...] (UK)) {{attaches}} {{the fork}} tubes {{to the frame}} via <b>steering</b> <b>head</b> bearings, which allow the fork assembly to pivot from side to side, and therefore steer the motorcycle. Most bikes have upper and lower triple trees, providing two solid clamping points that keep the fork tubes parallel while also connecting the forks to the frame via the <b>steering</b> <b>head</b> bearings.With the tendency to employ fork tubes with single action damping, fork triple trees need to be reinforced more than when the forks shared both damping roles, because the rigidity of the triple trees is relied upon to distribute the forces within the forks without flex.|$|E
50|$|The {{attempt to}} use a De Dion-Bouton engine in a bicycle frame in 1896 {{resulted}} in failure. But in 1897 they succeeded in creating a moto bicycle called the Motocyclette with the engine mounted on the front <b>steering</b> <b>head</b> that achieved some success.|$|E
5000|$|Whilst most bikes have {{telescopic}} forks, Nessie used an adapted {{version of}} Difazio hub-center steering, whereby braking forces {{were directed to}} the frame via a pivoted fork (rather than through the <b>steering</b> <b>head).</b> This allowed neutral steering and an absence of brake dive.|$|E
50|$|Yoshioka is a {{founding}} member of the UN-initiated Global Partnership for the Prevention of Armed Conflict (GPPAC) International <b>Steering</b> Group and <b>head</b> of its Northeast Asia Secretariat. He was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize in 2008 for leading the Global Article 9 Campaign to Abolish War.|$|R
5000|$|Then {{a problem}} with the new (and revolutionary, for its day) {{mechanical}} power <b>steering</b> raised its <b>head.</b> It only required [...] of pressure to turn the steering wheel but it was noisy. Only 100 of these units were sold before Studebaker began using GM Saginaw type units.|$|R
25|$|The Gallardo LP 560-4 Gold Edition(金色限量版) was {{a limited}} (10 units) {{version of the}} Gallardo LP 560-4 for the Chinese market, with gold body colour, black engine cover frame, LED headlamps, Cordelia glossy wheels, red brake calipers, black interior, red {{stitching}} and embroidery at <b>steering</b> wheel and <b>head</b> rest.|$|R
