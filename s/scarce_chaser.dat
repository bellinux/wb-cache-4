500|$|Dragonflies {{as a group}} {{occupy a}} {{considerable}} variety of habitats, but many species, and some families, have their own specific environmental requirements. Some species prefer flowing waters, while others prefer standing water. For example, the Gomphidae (clubtails) live in running water, and the Libellulidae (skimmers) live in still water. Some species are found in temporary water pools and are capable of tolerating changes in water level, desiccation, and the resulting variations in temperature, but some genera such as Sympetrum (darters) [...] have eggs and larvae that can resist drought and are stimulated to grow rapidly in warm, shallow pools, also often benefiting from the absence of predators there. Vegetation and its characteristics including submerged, floating, emergent, or waterside are also important. Adults may require emergent or waterside plants to use as perches; others may need specific submerged or floating plants on which to lay eggs. Requirements may be highly specific, as in Aeshna viridis (green hawker), which lives in swamps with the water-soldier, Stratiotes aloides. The chemistry of the water, including its trophic status (degree of enrichment with nutrients) and pH can also affect its use by dragonflies. Most species need moderate conditions, not too eutrophic, not too acid; a few species such as Sympetrum danae (black darter) and Libellula quadrimaculata (four-spotted chaser) prefer acidic waters such as peat bogs, while others such as Libellula fulva (<b>scarce</b> <b>chaser)</b> need slow-moving, eutrophic waters with reeds or similar waterside plants.|$|E
50|$|Another {{important}} dragon fly is the <b>scarce</b> <b>chaser</b> (Libellula fulva).|$|E
50|$|Odonata inhabiting {{the reserve}} include the red-eyed damselfly, {{southern}} damselfly, scarce blue-tailed damselfly, brown hawker, <b>scarce</b> <b>chaser</b> and keeled skimmer.|$|E
50|$|The site {{consists}} of three areas of land, Pingle Wood, Myles Meadow and The Holts. Myles Meadow has two ponds and is seasonally grazed by cattle. Holts Meadow has a pond with many dragonflies and damselflies, including the emperor and <b>scarce</b> <b>chaser</b> dragonflies.|$|E

50|$|The {{site has}} fen, {{freshwater}} dykes and grazing marshes. Resident wildfowl include wigeons, gadwalls, teals and shovelers are joined in winter by migrants when the marshes are flooded. <b>Scarce</b> <b>chaser</b> and the nationally rare Norfolk hawker dragonflies breed on the site, {{and there are}} blue-tailed damselflies.|$|E
50|$|Some rare {{invertebrates}} {{inhabit the}} hill and its surrounding area. The <b>scarce</b> <b>chaser</b> (Libellula fulva), hairy dragonfly (Brachytron pratense) and downy emerald (Cordulia aenea) all {{make use of the}} ponds in the wetter areas of the heath, while the heath grasshopper (Chorthippus vagansand) {{can be found on the}} sandy areas among the heather along with the silver-studded blue butterfly (Plebejus argus).|$|E
50|$|The <b>Scarce</b> <b>Chaser</b> (Libellula fulva) is {{a species}} of dragonfly. The adult male has a bright blue abdomen with patches of black, while the adult female and {{juvenile}} male each have a bright orange abdomen. It is about 45 mm in length with an average wingspan of 74 mm. It is distributed throughout Europe. This dragonfly is considered {{a species of}} special concern in Great Britain due to loss of its specific ideal habitat.|$|E
50|$|The {{species is}} similar to its much more {{localized}} congener the White-Tailed Skimmer, but readily identifiable in the field. The males develop a blue pruinescence on the abdomen darkening to the rear with S8-10 becoming black. Its eyes are very dark green. They fly swift and low, skimming the water surface. Females retain their color and markings though they become quite grayish brown with age. This species could be confused with Keeled skimmer or <b>Scarce</b> <b>chaser.</b>|$|E
