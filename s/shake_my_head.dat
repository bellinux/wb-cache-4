2500|$|William A. Donohue of the Catholic League has {{described}} Pullman's trilogy as [...] "atheism for kids". Pullman has said of Donohue's {{call for a}} boycott, [...] "Why don't we trust readers? [...] Oh, it causes me to <b>shake</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> with sorrow that such nitwits could be loose in the world".|$|E
2500|$|Pullman said of Donohue's {{call for}} a boycott, [...] "Why don't we trust readers? Why don't we trust filmgoers? Oh, it causes me to <b>shake</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> with sorrow that such nitwits could be loose in the world." [...] In a {{discussion}} with Donohue on CBS's Early Show, Ellen Johnson, president of American Atheists, said that rather than promote atheism, the film would encourage children to question authority, saying {{that would not be}} a bad thing for children to learn. Director Weitz says that he believes His Dark Materials is [...] "not an atheistic work, but a highly spiritual and reverent piece of writing," [...] and Nicole Kidman defended her decision to star in the film, saying that [...] "I wouldn't {{be able to do this}} film if I thought it were at all anti-Catholic." ...|$|E
2500|$|Director Gareth Edwards {{has said}} that he [...] "intentionally placed humans in shots to give the scene a sense of scale, as {{everyone}} knows the size of a human, so we know the size of a creature or a building." [...] He has also claimed that [...] "We said that we wouldn't place a camera anywhere {{it would be impossible to}} get one. We would say [...] "Imagine it was a news story, or a sports event, cameramen would put cameras where they could in a hurry, and get any shot they could." [...] This is what we wanted [...] to feel like, as if people were filming glimpses at any chance they could." [...] He also found himself [...] "Doing things [...] think are cliche; panning up just as a roar happens, or getting the perfect shot, things I <b>shake</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> at when watching other people's films. Especially when [...] is first seen, we wanted a build up, and then pan up, we see him, and then we don't see him. I love that." ...|$|E
60|$|Again I <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> whereat {{he looked}} more {{disappointed}} than before.|$|R
60|$|I {{released}} her long emaciated hand, <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> negatively, and sat down.|$|R
60|$|I <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> feebly, for I was {{longing to}} accept his offer.|$|R
2500|$|After {{coaching}} the Bruins for 50 seasons, Scates retired {{at the end}} of the 2012 season. He is the most successful coach in the history of the sport. He has been inducted into the Hall of Fame of a number of volleyball organizations, including The American Volleyball Coaches Association, The UCLA Athletics, The California Beach Volleyball and the Volleyball Halls of Fame. He was the first active coach inducted into the UCLA and Volleyball Halls of Fame. In retirement, he offered [...] "It is a privilege to coach the fine men that have participated and continue to compete for UCLA volleyball. I have enjoyed being a continuous member of UCLA volleyball since I walked onto the team as a junior in 1959." [...] Said Penn State's Russ Rose “I look at the 19 national championships and <b>shake</b> <b>my</b> <b>head.</b> I can understand 50 years at UCLA because they don’t have winter. But the number of great players who have played at UCLA and the bond they all have for each other and the university is the greatest contribution he has made to the sport. That’s his lasting legacy.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And so, if I were to <b>shake</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> at {{you when}} you were doing any thing wrong, and you wore to {{continue}} doing it, that would be disobedience." ...|$|E
60|$|I feel so piggish and rabbitish {{in eating}} {{you out of}} all your vegetables, that I'm afraid to speak lest it should turn out grunting, and to <b>shake</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> for fear of feeling flappy at the ears.|$|E
60|$|I <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> though I guessed {{well enough}} what night he meant.|$|R
60|$|I <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> blankly, for I {{had never}} heard {{anything}} of the sort.|$|R
60|$|I <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> in sorrow, a {{thrust of}} jealousy cutting me the while.|$|R
6000|$|It was {{the least}} I could do to give the melon a more {{particular}} examination; which, when I had done, I could but <b>shake</b> <b>my</b> <b>head.</b> [...] "I am truly sorry, Pinkerton," [...] said I, [...] "but I can't advise you to persevere." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{asked the}} {{question}} so earnestly that I imagined he had softened at the last moment, and feared to leave the world with another homicide upon his conscience. Truth, however, compelled me to <b>shake</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> mournfully, and to intimate that the wound would prove a mortal one.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I couldn't speak, I {{could only}} <b>shake</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> and Boney--so {{impatient}} {{he was to}} go on with his doings--he ran at me and fair pushed me out of the room. And that was all there was to it.' Pharaoh stood up and slid his fiddle into one of his big skirt-pockets {{as though it were a}} dead hare.|$|E
60|$|I <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> {{with all}} <b>my</b> flush of joy changed to foolish resentment.|$|R
60|$|For {{an instant}} its great black hole yawned close, but I <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head.</b>|$|R
60|$|I <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> and {{dismissed}} him. After {{a very brief}} toilet I hastened downstairs.|$|R
6000|$|... "Good! {{there is}} no good. But can I help it, if I love him? Can I make myself not love him by just wishing it? Oh, I would do it if I could. But now you will {{understand}} why I <b>shake</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> when you talk of my coming to your house. Your ways and my ways must be different." ...|$|E
60|$|Then, at a {{sign from}} the Prince, {{soldiers}} flung themselves upon the miserable Umbezi {{and dragged him}} thence, Saduko going with them; nor was the poor liar ever seen again. As he passed by me he called to me, for Mameena's sake, to save him; but I could only <b>shake</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> and bethink me of the warning I had once given to him as {{to the fate of}} traitors.|$|E
60|$|I made no sceptical remarks, and did {{not even}} <b>shake</b> <b>my</b> <b>head.</b> The {{circumstances}} of the encounter were described by Mariano with such graphic power and minuteness {{that it was impossible}} not to believe his story. Yet some things in it afterwards struck me as somewhat absurd; that straw hat, for instance, and it also seemed strange that a person of Mula's disposition should have been so much improved in temper by his sojourn in a warmer place.|$|E
60|$|I <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> {{and felt}} myself {{swelling}} with the inarticulate hate that possessed me.|$|R
60|$|Again I <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> and for {{the life}} of me I could say nothing.|$|R
60|$|I <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> blankly, whereat they murmured {{together}} and made {{as though they}} would go.|$|R
6000|$|Here I {{ventured to}} interpose, {{and to offer}} her a plate of {{strawberries}} and cream. I felt really uneasy {{at the thought that}} she might detect the trick: and I contrived, unperceived by her, to <b>shake</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> reprovingly at the pseudo-philosopher. Equally unperceived by her, Arthur slightly raised his shoulders, and spread his hands abroad, as who should say [...] "What else can I say to her?" [...] and moved away, leaving her to discuss her strawberries by 'involution,' or any other way she preferred.|$|E
6000|$|... "Gentlemen {{have often}} asked me that," [...] said Moodie slowly; [...] "but I <b>shake</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> and say little or nothing, and creep {{out of the}} way as well as I can. I am a man of few words; and if gentlemen were to be told one thing, they would be very apt, I suppose, to ask me another. But it happens just now, Mr. Coverdale, that you can tell me more about the maker of those little purses than I can tell you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I was {{completely}} unprepared for this. I could only mutter and <b>shake</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> vaguely. Afterwards I am perfectly aware I cut {{a very poor}} figure trying to extricate myself out of this difficulty. From that moment, however, the old nakhoda became taciturn. He was not very pleased, I fear, and evidently I had given him food for thought. Strangely enough, {{on the evening of}} that very day (which was my last in Patusan) I was once more confronted with the same question, with the unanswerable why of Jim's fate. And this brings me to the story of his love.|$|E
60|$|I <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> emphatically, {{guessing}} that I {{was to be}} seat {{on another}} proud mission.|$|R
60|$|I <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> {{and looked}} at him. His head had dropped down on his chest again.|$|R
60|$|I <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head.</b> Some {{instinct}} told me {{that they}} were professors. But I didn't say so.|$|R
6000|$|This thing, {{for very}} obvious reasons, I found it quite {{impossible}} to do. In the first place, {{my left arm}} had been broken in my fall from the ladder, and, therefore, had I let go my hold with the right hand, I must have let go altogether. In the second place, I could have no breeches until I came across the crow. I was therefore obliged, much to my regret, to <b>shake</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> in the negative--intending thus to give the Angel to understand that I found it inconvenient, just at that moment, to comply with his very reasonable demand! No sooner, however, had I ceased shaking my head than-- ...|$|E
60|$|I {{stared at}} it, and I had to <b>shake</b> <b>my</b> <b>head.</b> Then I {{showed it to}} my Hussars, but they could make nothing of it. The Poles were all rough fellows who could not read or write, save only the sergeant, who came from Memel, in East Prussia, and knew no Russian. It was maddening, for I felt that I had {{possession}} of some important secret upon which {{the safety of the}} army might depend, and yet I could make no sense of it. Again I entreated our prisoner to translate it, and offered him his freedom if he would do so. He only smiled at my request.|$|E
60|$|What {{a change}} {{it was when}} my son and I {{had to go into}} waiting at the Louvre! Before the Queen-Regent there was nothing but vituperation of the Parliament, but the Duke of Orleans hates the Cardinal quite as much as the Parisians did; and his daughter, Mademoiselle, wanted him to lead the Frondeuse, and chatted to me of her plan of leading the party, {{together}} with the Prince of Conde, whom she eagerly desired to marry if his poor wife could be divorced. I used to <b>shake</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> at her and say I knew she was too good at the bottom to desire anything so shocking, and she took it in good part. She was much better than she chose to seem.|$|E
60|$|She {{looked up}} at me as though asking for {{confirmation}} of her views. I <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head.</b>|$|R
60|$|I <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> and I smiled {{down upon}} her {{a smile that}} was very full of confidence.|$|R
60|$|I <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head.</b> Mr. Dick <b>shook</b> his, and sighed. 'Tell {{him about}} the Memorial,' said Mr. Dick.|$|R
