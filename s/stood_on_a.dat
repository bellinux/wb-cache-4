5|$|Al-Birwa <b>stood</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> rocky hill {{overlooking}} the Acre plain, {{with an average}} elevation of 60 meters above sea level. It was situated {{at the intersection of}} two highways—one led to Acre and the other towards Haifa. Located 10.5 kilometers east of Acre, the other nearest localities to al-Birwa included al-Damun (depopulated in 1948) to the south, and the Arab towns of Jadeida to the northwest, Julis to the north, Sha'ab to the east, and Majd al-Kurum to the northeast.|$|E
5|$|Bradman practised batting incessantly {{during his}} youth. He invented his own solo cricket game, using a cricket stump for a bat, and a golf ball. A water tank, {{mounted on a}} curved brick stand, <b>stood</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> paved area behind the family home. When hit into the curved brick facing of the stand, the ball rebounded at high speed and varying angles—and Bradman would attempt to hit it again. This form of {{practice}} developed his timing and reactions to a high degree. In more formal cricket, he hit his first century {{at the age of}} 12, with an undefeated 115 playing for Bowral Public School against Mittagong High School.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{earliest}} developments of note in Depot Town was the Western Hotel, built by Mark Norris. Opening in May 1839, the Western Hotel <b>stood</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> triangular plot west of River Street and north of the railroad track. Around 1860, the Michigan Central Railroad bought the land to replace the old wood plank depot with a newer, more modern brick depot. Norris demolished his hotel and carried the bricks across River Street, where he built a three-story Italianate structure, which {{became known as the}} Norris Block.|$|E

5|$|Solsticial {{alignments}} {{also can}} be seen as displays of power. When viewed from a ceremonial plaza on the Island of the Sun (the mythical origin place of the Sun) in Lake Titicaca, the Sun was seen to rise at the June solstice between two towers on a nearby ridge. The sacred part of the island was separated from the remainder of it by a stone wall and ethnographic records indicate that access to the sacred space was restricted to members of the Inca ruling elite. Ordinary pilgrims <b>stood</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> platform outside the ceremonial area to see the solstice Sun rise between the towers.|$|E
5|$|The {{front cover}} design, a {{photograph}} of the group on a zebra crossing, was based on ideas sketched by McCartney, and taken on 8 August 1969 outside EMI Studios in Abbey Road. At 11:35 that morning, photographer Iain Macmillan was given only ten minutes to take the photo whilst he <b>stood</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> step-ladder and a policeman held up traffic behind the camera. Macmillan took six photographs, which McCartney later examined with a magnifying glass before deciding which of the shots would be used upon the album sleeve.|$|E
5|$|The ancient font by {{the west}} door dates from the twelfth century, and has an arcaded basin. The plain pointed arch forms the only {{ornament}} on the font, which has an octagonal ashlar shaft now mounted on a platform, and supporting the octagonal basin. Unfortunately the font has been subject to extensive and clumsy repair. Unusually, it is made of Purbeck marble, which is normally found in churches in south and eastern England; the only other example in Wales is in St David's Cathedral. Documentary {{evidence suggests that the}} massive stem dates from at least the nineteenth century, and stylistic evidence suggests that it is probably a lot earlier; the font basin itself is undoubtedly ancient. Seddon's restoration work in the church commenced in 1869, and included dismantling the font. He carefully cleaned and stored the stonework, and re-erected it on new platform of Radyr conglomerate stone. Radyr Stone is a Triassic breccia used widely for decorative work in the Cardiff area, including Llandaff Cathedral, Cardiff Docks and in the bridges of the Taff Vale Railway. The font previously <b>stood</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> three step platform, in the same position as it now stands. The font cover is nineteenth century, in oak and wrought iron.|$|E

5|$|The balcony is {{topped by}} a niche {{consisting}} of allegorical figures of Justice and Truth, as well as triumphal sculptures of a winged female figure and a putto. Some parts of the sculptures, such as the scales held by Lady Justice, are now missing. The empty spaces between these figures contained Pinto's bust and coat of arms, but they were removed during the French occupation of Malta or in the early 19th century. It is not known how the bust of Pinto looked like, however {{it may have been}} either sculpted similar to the bust on the façade of Auberge de Castille or an original work. In either case it was probably made of bronze, and <b>stood</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> marble plinth which is still there. Similar to other busts of the time, {{it may have been the}} work of Jacques Saly. The triumphal figures are similar to those found on the 17th century funerary monument of Nicolas Cotoner sculpted by Domenico Guidi, but it is unknown who worked on the replica of the Castellania.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} {{was for the}} NWA World Heavyweight Championship, in which then-champion Jeff Jarrett defended against the {{challenger}} Rhino. The duration of the match was 17 minutes and 30 seconds. Jarrett was busted open during the contest. Despite this being a standard wrestling match, Jarrett and Rhino used weapons throughout and primarily fought outside of the ring. Jarrett hit Rhino with a chair while the two <b>stood</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> scaffolding, causing Rhino to fall off and crash through a table. Rhino attempted to tackle Jarrett through a table {{set up on the}} entrance ramp. He succeeded, but the table did not break. Team Canada interfered afterwards, trying to stop Rhino from getting to the ring before the referee counted both Rhino and Jarrett out. They failed as Rhino came rushing back into the ring before the count finished. Jarrett pinned Rhino after slamming Rhino face-first with his signature Stroke maneuver onto several steel chairs. As such, Jarrett retained the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. After the title match, the lights went off with the logo of the wrestler Sting appearing on the screens in the arena, thus being the major announcement advertised for the show.|$|E
5|$|The {{morning of}} 27 February 1814 saw a light frost, but {{the ground was}} not frozen. At 8:30 am the 4th Division {{assaulted}} Taupin's soldiers at Saint-Boès. The initial rush seized the church which <b>stood</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> separate hill. The brigade of Robert Ross swept through Saint-Boès but was repulsed by the battery on the Plassotte knoll. When his soldiers fell back into the village, Cole brought up a KGL battery to duel with Taupin's guns. The battery immediately became {{the target of the}} French batteries on the Plassotte and Luc knolls; two guns were knocked out and Captain Frederick Sympher was killed. Cole deployed José Vasconcellos' Portuguese brigade on Ross' right and sent his line forward again. The result was a second repulse in which Ross went down with a wound. The subsequent counterattack by Taupin's troops recovered part of Saint-Boès. For a time there was a lull as the two sides fired away at each other from the houses, but Vasconcellos' men had no cover and began to edge backward. Wellington sent over the 1st Caçadores Battalion from the Light Division. Cole's line collapsed just as the reinforcement arrived. Taupin recovered the entire village and drove the Allies back to their starting point. Ross' brigade suffered 279 casualties and Vasconcellos' brigade lost 295.|$|E

5|$|There is some {{authority}} {{to the effect that}} a court will not generally grant a declaration if it considers the issue at hand to be an academic question or one that is entirely hypothetical. For instance, in Vince v. Chief Constable of Dorset Police (1992), proceedings against the Chief Constable of Dorset Police were brought by the plaintiffs on behalf of members of the Police Federation of England and Wales to, among other things, enable chief constables throughout the country to know where they <b>stood</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> question of law with respect to the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, namely, whether it was unlawful to appoint an acting sergeant as a custody officer under section 36(3) of the Act. Affirming the decision of the judge below, a majority of the Court of Appeal declined to make a declaration on the matter. It took the view that since {{there was no evidence that}} any chief constable had ever appointed an acting sergeant as a custody officer, the issue was academic or hypothetical.|$|E
5|$|Young Como started {{helping his}} family at age 10, working {{before and after}} school in Steve Fragapane's barber shop for 50¢ a week. By age 13, he had {{graduated}} to having his own chair in the Fragapane barber shop, although he <b>stood</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> box to tend to his customers. It was also around this time that young Como lost his week's wages in a dice game. Filled with shame, he locked himself in his room and did not come out until hunger {{got the better of}} him. He managed to tell his father {{what had happened to the}} money his family depended on. His father told him he was entitled to make a mistake and that he hoped his son would never do anything worse than this. When Perry was 14, his father became unable to work because of a severe heart condition. Como and his brothers became the support of the household.|$|E
5|$|Villani {{states that}} by noon on Thursday, November 4, 1333, a flood along the Arno River {{spread across the}} entire plain of San Salvi. He wrote that by nightfall the eastern wall {{of the city that}} was damming the water became damaged and then washed away in the flood, {{allowing}} the flood waters to breach and fill the city streets. He claims that the water rose above the altar in the Florence Baptistry, reaching over half the height of the porphyry columns. Bartlett notes that these columns, presented to Florence by the Pisans more than two hundred years before, have scratched lines to this day indicating the water level reached by the flood in 1333. Villani further claims that the height of the flood water in the courtyard of the commune's palace (residence of the podestà) reached 3m (10ft). The Carraia bridge collapsed with the exception of two of its arches, while the Trinità bridge collapsed except for one pier and one arch located towards the church of the Santa Trinità. The Ponte Vecchio—save the two central piers—was swept away when huge logs in the rushing water became clogged around the it, allowing the water to build and leap over the arches, states Villani. There was an old statue of Mars that <b>stood</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> pedestal near the Ponte Vecchio, but this too was taken by the flood along the Arno.|$|E
