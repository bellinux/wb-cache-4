500|$|For the game's characters, {{the team}} wished {{to explore the}} concept of opposites, mainly {{represented}} by the White Witch's goal to destroy the world, and Oliver's attempts to save it. The character performances were mostly recorded using motion capture technology, followed by manual adjustment by the team to make a [...] "more anime-like movement". The game's characters were particularly inspired by Level-5's previous work on the Professor Layton series (2007–present). During development, Momose suggested that the team design the clothes in a modern fashion, in order for players to gain a [...] "stronger <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have {{stepped out of the}} familiar and into a different world".|$|E
500|$|In Revenge of the Sith, McDiarmid {{played a}} darker {{interpretation}} of the character. He explained that [...] "when you're playing a character of solid blackness, {{that in itself is}} very interesting, in the <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have no other motivation other than the accumulation of power. It's not so much about not having a moral center, it's just that the only thing that mattered is increasing power." [...] He admitted, [...] "I've been trying to find a redeeming feature to Palpatine, and the only one I've got so far is that he's clearly a patron of the arts because he goes to the opera." [...] McDiarmid compared the character to Iago from William Shakespeare's Othello: ...|$|E
500|$|A Thousand Splendid Suns {{received}} significant {{praise from}} reviewers, with Publishers Weekly calling it [...] "a powerful, harrowing depiction of Afghanistan" [...] and USA Today describing the prose as [...] "achingly beautiful". Lisa See of The New York Times attributed the book's success to Hosseini [...] " [...] {{the power of}} emotion as few other popular writers do". Natasha Walter from The Guardian wrote, [...] "Hosseini is skilled at telling {{a certain kind of}} story, in which events that may seem unbearable - violence, misery and abuse - are made readable. He doesn't gloss over the horrors his characters live through, but something about his direct, explanatory style and the <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are moving towards a redemptive ending makes the whole narrative, for all its tragedies, slip down rather easily." ...|$|E

The writer/director, Dr. Robert Gardner, recalled his initial {{meeting with the}} actor. [...] "I had seen him scores of times in movies and television and I was very nervous. In truth, though, he was a joy to work with. Once he <b>sensed</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> were prepared he was thoroughly professional. His presence in the ninety-minute production was the main reason it {{went on to win}} the prestigious Gold Medal at the Atlanta International Film Festival." ...|$|R

You are a subject of England." ...|$|R
500|$|In {{the script}} of [...] "The Gathering", Tessa is {{described}} as [...] "...a beautiful, elegantly casual woman, artist, free spirit, and proprietor {{of the most unusual}} antique shop in the city." [...] The script of the episode [...] "Saving Grace" [...] says that she has grace and style. Tessa is portrayed as a tall, thin woman with blonde hair and blue eyes. Because Highlander: The Series was an international co-production, the producers cast a French-speaking actor to play Tessa. Producer Gary Goodman explained that they wanted someone [...] "...that would be appealing on a television screen... in the <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> were comfortable with her accent and her character". They chose Belgian actress Alexandra Vandernoot because she [...] "...was able to be exotic, pretty and not so unfamiliar to an American audience that she was accepted." ...|$|E
500|$|The game's {{characters}} were particularly inspired by Level-5's previous {{work on the}} Professor Layton series (2007–present). During development, Momose suggested that the team design the clothes in a modern fashion, in order for players to gain a [...] "stronger <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have {{stepped out of the}} familiar and into a different world". The game's main playable character, Oliver, is a 13-year-old boy. The team decided to make him a child as they wished to showcase a coming of age story. They wanted children to empathize with Oliver's development, and adults to relive the excitement of their adolescence. A major part of the story is Oliver's personal development, which Hino describes as [...] "the process of how a child grows into an adult". In regards to Oliver's physical appearance, Momose made his outfit represent a young boy in 1950s America, which was the inspiration for his hometown.|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} almost universally well {{received}} by the music press upon release, with Jon Landau in the newly launched Rolling Stone magazine noting that [...] "When the Byrds get it together on record they are consistently brilliant." [...] Landau went on to praise the Byrds' musical eclecticism, before stating: [...] "Their music is possessed by a never-ending circularity and a rich, child-like quality. It has a timelessness to it, not in the <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> think their music will always be valid, but {{in the sense that}} it is capable of forcing you to suspend consciousness of time altogether." [...] Crawdaddy! magazine was also enthusiastic in its praise of the album, with Sandy Pearlman describing it as [...] "enchantingly beautiful". Pete Johnson, in his review for the Los Angeles Times, summed up the album as [...] "11 good songs spiked with electronic music, strings, brass, natural and supernatural voices, and the familiar thick texture of McGuinn's guitar playing".|$|E

My dear Clara, have <b>you</b> lost your <b>senses</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> can for a moment dream of putting a growing girl into an instrument of torture like this?" [...] and with a sudden gesture he plucked forth the offending corsets from under the sofa cushion, and held them out with the expression one would wear on beholding the thumbscrews or the rack of ancient times.|$|R
5000|$|Talking {{about the}} {{psychological}} {{impact of the}} event, Hunt said: [...] "You're completely alone. You get a real <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> when <b>you</b> come {{over some of the}} sand dunes and you look out and there's just no one for hundreds of miles. It's an adventure." ...|$|R
500|$|... "Exit" [...] {{was created}} {{on the final}} day of {{recording}} for The Joshua Tree. It developed from a lengthy jam that the band recorded in a single take. Producer Daniel Lanois said, [...] "it was a long jam, and there was just this one section of it that had some kind of magic to it, and we just decided to turn it into something." [...] Producer Brian Eno edited the jam down to the end length. Guitarist the Edge said, [...] "it started off as an exercise in playing together with a kind of mood and a place in mind. And it really, for me, it brought me there, it really did succeed as an experiment." [...] Lanois said: [...] "There's something that happens when U2 bash it out in the band room... and sometimes things get out of control, sonically, in a good way. Out of control in the <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> don't know what it is anymore, it just takes on a life of its own, and it makes people do things." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Zooropa" [...] is set amongst neon {{signs of}} a brightly lit futuristic city. In the song's introduction, {{background}} voices ask, [...] "What do you want?" [...] In response to the question, the lyrics {{in the first three}} verses consist of various advertising slogans, including, [...] "Better by design", [...] "Be all that you can be", and [...] "Vorsprung durch technik". Critic Parry Gettelman interpreted these lines as meaning to [...] "signify the emptiness of modern, godless life". In the song's second half, the theme of moral confusion and uncertainty is introduced, particularly in the lines [...] "I have no compass / And I have no map". [...] "Babyface" [...] is about a man practicing his obsessive love for a celebrity by manipulating her image on a TV recording. [...] "Lemon", inspired by an old video of Bono's late mother in a lemon-coloured dress, describes man's attempts to preserve time through technology. This is reflected in lines such as, [...] "A man makes a picture / A moving picture / Through the light projected he can see himself up close". The lyrics to [...] "Numb" [...] are a series of [...] "don't" [...] commands, amidst a noisy backdrop of sounds. The Edge notes that the song was inspired by one of the themes of Zoo TV, [...] "that <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> were getting bombarded with so much that you actually were finding yourself shutting down and unable to respond because there was so much imagery and information being thrown at you".|$|E

2500|$|In the DS {{version of}} the game, AI {{problems}} were again mentioned, the player's allies [...] " [...] around like a Hobbit with its head cut off". The lack of checkpoints and sub-standard graphics were also raised, along with lag during multiplayer and combat being unsatisfying, the reviewer not getting [...] "a <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are clashing swords and armor with your opponents". The review {{also pointed out that}} the game seems much as though [...] "the license is really just skinned onto capture the flag".|$|E
2500|$|After {{signing with}} the CBA's Shanghai Sharks, Fredette {{has become a}} {{dominant}} player in the Chinese Basketball League, leading his team to the playoffs last season. He has also acquired the fan nickname [...] "Jimo Dashen," [...] which translates to [...] "The Lonely Master" [...] or [...] "The Lonely God" [...] in Chinese. Fredette commented on this during an interview: “It’s not necessarily the same <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> think about being lonely. In America, you just think you are by yourself and depressed and that type of stuff. But in this way, it more means that you're on top, and nobody is around you.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Birt {{was made}} unpaid Strategy Adviser to Blair in 2001, {{appointed}} {{for what was}} termed [...] "Blue skies thinking" [...] and claimed by Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott to be [...] "worth every penny"; Blair wanted advice from outside the traditional Whitehall mindset – he had known Birt since the 1980s and approved of his analytical approach. Jeremy Heywood, Blair’s principal private secretary, said: “He liked the way that John was willing to get right down into the data and understand the evidence, {{and come up with}} [...] a real <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> could do things in a totally different way.” [...] Birt supervised the development of long-term strategy on drugs, health, crime reduction, education, transport and London. His 2004 report on drug policy recommended making heroin use a criminal offence on par with possession.|$|E

2500|$|Motoring {{journalist}} Jeremy Clarkson, {{a famous}} critic of hybrid vehicles and the Toyota Prius especially, admitted {{he loved the}} GS 450h. After claiming that you {{spent most of the}} time on the Prius [...] "chewing a lot of fuel" [...] and [...] "making a green statement," [...] he described [...] "with the Lexus I drove up and down Piccadilly all day. It was great." [...] He also felt that the GS 450h was [...] "balanced nicely by the styling, the quality and the <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> really are in something a little bit different." [...] Clarkson also positively referred to the benefit of a hybrid car being exempt from the London congestion charge (for a £10 one off administration fee to register it). In 2009, the GS 450h received a new hybrid-only grille and refreshing.|$|E
2500|$|Qs Tom Doyle {{hailed the}} album, saying, [...] "These 10 {{magnificent}} songs see the singer and lyricist {{trying to get}} his head around life, death, love, the universe and what he calls 'the mysteries of the human heart'... Always musically sure-footed and prog-minded – less, of course, in terms of never-ending solos; more in the <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> never know what's up next sonically – here Elbow stretch themselves musically without tearing up their original blueprint... Topping even The Seldom Seen Kid, The Take Off... is the perfect expression yet of everything that is Elbow. As their best album to date, it will lift yor heart and fill your soul." [...] Referring to the group's concert at Jodrell Bank in 2012, Mojos Victoria Segal noted, [...] "You don't need the world's largest radio telescope to pick up the issues of mortality and make-or-break change pulsing through the record... Plotting their course through these highs and lows – those take-offs and landings – Elbow are no clearer than anyone else about how they will reach the final destination. By sharing that uncertainty and navigating by what little light there is, artistically, at least, they never lose their way." ...|$|E
2500|$|Xi Zheng, then an {{assistant}} {{official in the}} palace library, often visited Meng Guang to consult him. When Meng Guang asked him what the crown prince, Liu Xuan, had been learning and reading {{and what he was}} interested in, Xi Zheng replied, [...] "He treats the people around him respectfully. He is very diligent and hardworking. He has the style of a crown prince of ancient times. When he meets people, he shows sincerity, kindness and generosity in everything he says and does." [...] Meng Guang then said, [...] "This is what is expected of every other person. What I really want to know is his level of political wisdom and how good his political skills are." [...] Xi Zheng replied, [...] "The Crown Prince's approach towards life is to focus on winning people's hearts and favour. He won't do what he shouldn't do. He doesn't openly reveal his wisdom. Besides, political skills can only be used under certain circumstances; they cannot be cultivated and learnt in advance." [...] Meng Guang knew that Xi Zheng was trying to careful with his words, so he said, [...] "I like to speak my mind as freely as possible. Every time I openly make criticisms, people will ridicule or hate me for that. Although I <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> don't like to hear what I say, my words make sense. The Empire is not unified yet. Political skills are crucial in this time and age. While one's mastery of political skills depends on his intellectual abilities, political skills can be learnt and mastered through diligence. This {{has to do with the}} Crown Prince's education. He should be striving to enrich himself with as much knowledge as possible so that he can be like a consultant. He should also sit for written and oral tests like academics and gain some titles. This is a top priority for him." [...] Xi Zheng strongly agreed with him.|$|E

2500|$|In 2012, Jeremy Clarkson {{wrote an}} article in the Sunday Times about his Yorkshire drive in the moors of the Lexus LFA. Jeremy highly praised the LFA's {{appearance}} and how special it felt both inside and out by saying [...] "It looks very very special and inside it even gets better. Unlike Ferrari that fits buttons everywhere it can find some space, Lexus has thought through everything beautifully in this car. Apart from the switch that engages the reverse, which is behind the mileometer - there's a Spock-like logic to everything. And when you push or pull or engage anything, {{there is a sense that}} it will continue to work for thousands of years. It is the nicest car interior I've ever encountered and I would never ever tire of the tool that moves all of the dials around". Clarkson highly praised the LFA engine by saying [...] "Then you fire the engine up. Snick it into first, move off and... whoa! The noise beggars belief. This is not a car that shouts, growls or barks. It howls. Up there, on the moors, it sounded otherworldly. Like a werewolf that puts its foot in a gin tap. And while it is not as fast as you were expecting, you quickly realize on damp moorland road that 552 BHP is perfect. Anything more and you're going to be picking heather out of the grille for a month". Clarkson had high praises for LFA's handling and confidence inspiring capabilities as he writes [...] "The LFA inspires tremendous confidence. Then up ahead, Gouge marks in the tarmac show clearly over the years, many a sump have clattered into the road and you brace for impact that never comes. The LFA may be lower than a worm's navel, but so successful is the suspension, it never bottoms out". Clarkson sums up his experience in the LFA by saying [...] "I have to say I absolutely love it. It is an intelligent car built by intelligent people. In some ways it is raw and visceral: In others it is a lesson in common sense. Engine at the front, two seats in the middle and a boot you can use. Despite all of this, there is a <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are in a real, full-on race car. If cruise control was invented for Nevada, Yorkshire was invented for the LFA. It is a car that reminds you every time you drive it why we have corners." [...] Regarding only 500 LFA's being built at a high price, Clarkson summed it up [...] "The trouble is that there are only 500 being built..still, it is not the end of the world since you can have the Nissan GT-R. It is nine-tenths as good. But costs almost five times less".|$|E
