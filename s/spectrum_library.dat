To directly monitor stabilization of Nrf 2, we fused its Neh 2 domain, responsible for the interaction with its nucleocytoplasmic regulator, Keap 1, to firefly luciferase (Neh 2 -luciferase). We show that Neh 2 domain is sufficient for recognition, ubiquitination, and proteasomal degradation of Neh 2 -luciferase fusion protein. The Neh 2 -luc reporter system allows direct monitoring of the adaptive response to redox stress and classification of drugs based on the time course of reporter activation. The reporter was used to screen the <b>Spectrum</b> <b>library</b> of 2000 biologically active compounds to identify activators of Nrf 2.

The distributions of ecological effect quotients (EEQs) of 14 phenols were characterized {{in terms of the}} exposure concentration distributions (ECDs) and species sensitivity distributions (SSDs). Those phenols with EEQs exceeding the threshold proposed by Water Environment Research Foundation of Alexandria were selected as priorities. As a result, 2 -nitrophenol (2 -NP), p-chloro-m-xylenol (PCMX) and pyrocatechol were determined as potential ecological risk stressors in surface water of the Taihu Lake.

A unique reference database of MALDI-TOF MS profiles for type and reference strains of the six generally accepted Prototheca species was established. The database quality was reinforced after the acquisition of 27 spectra for selected Prototheca strains, with three biological and technical replicates for each of 18 type and reference strains of Prototheca and four strains of Chlorella. This provides reproducible and unique spectra covering a wide m/z range (2000 – 20 000 Da) {{for each of the}} strains used in the present study.

40|$|Electron {{transfer}} dissociation (ETD) is {{an alternative}} fragmentation technique to CID that has recently become commercially available. ETD has several advantages over CID. It is less prone to fragmenting amino acid side chains, especially those that are modified, thus yielding fragment ion spectra with more uniform peak intensities.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a language for expressing criteria for chemical identification with comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography paired with mass spectrometry (GC×GC–MS) and presents computer-based tools implementing the language. The Computer Language for Indentifying Chemicals (CLIC) allows expressions that describe rules (or constraints) for selecting chemical peaks or data points based on multi-dimensional chromatographic properties and mass spectral characteristics. CLIC offers chromatographic functions of retention times, functions of mass spectra, numbers for quantitative and relational evaluation, and logical and arithmetic operators. The language is demonstrated with the compound-class selection rules described by Welthagen et al. [W. Welthagen, J. Schnelle-Kreis, R. Zimmermann, J. Chromatogr. A 1019 (2003) 233 – 249].

40|$|Abstract For LAMOST, {{the largest}} sky survey program in China, the {{solution}} of the problem of automatic discrimination of stars from galaxies by spectra has shown that the results of the PSF test can be significantly refined. However, the problem is made worse when the redshifts of galaxies are not available. We present a new automatic method of star/(normal) galaxy separation, which is based on Statistical Mixture Modeling with Radial Basis Function Neural Networks (SMM-RBFNN). This work is a continuation of our previous one, where active and non-active celestial objects were successfully segregated. By combining the method in this paper and the previous one, stars can now be effectively separated from galaxies and AGNs by their spectra—a major goal of LAMOST, and an indispensable step in any automatic spectrum classification system. In our work, the training set includes standard stellar spectra from Jacoby’s <b>spectrum</b> <b>library</b> and simulated galaxy spectra of E 0, S 0, Sa, Sb types with redshift ranging from 0 to 1. 2, and the test set of stellar spectra from Pickles ’ atlas and SDSS spectra of normal galaxies with SNR of 13.

40|$|Abstract. Detecting {{multiple}} pitches (F 0 s) and segregating {{musical instrument}} lines from monaural recordings of contrapuntal polyphonic music into separate tracks {{is a difficult}} problem in music signal processing. Applications include audio-to-MIDI conversion, automatic music transcription, and audio enhancement and transformation. Past attempts at separation have been limited to separating two harmonic signals in a contrapuntal duet (Maher, 1990) or several harmonic signals in a single chord (Virtanen and Klapuri, 2001, 2002). Several researchers have attempted polyphonic pitch detection (Klapuri, 2001; Eggink and Brown, 2004 a), predominant melody extraction (Goto, 2001; Marolt, 2004; Eggink and Brown, 2004 b), and instrument recognition (Eggink and Brown, 2003). Our solution assumes that each instrument is represented as a timevarying harmonic series and that errors can be corrected using prior knowledge of instrument spectra. Fundamental frequencies (F 0 s) for each time frame are estimated from input spectral data using an Expectation-Maximization (EM) based algorithm with Gaussian distributions used to represent the harmonic series. Collisions (i. e., overlaps) between instrument harmonics, which frequently occur, are predicted from the estimated F 0 s. The uncollided harmonics are matched to ones contained in a pre-stored <b>spectrum</b> <b>library</b> in order that each F 0 `s harmonic series is assigned to the appropriate instrument. Corrupted harmonics are restored using data taken from the library. Finally, each voice is additively resynthesized to a separate track. This algorithm is demonstrated for a monaural signal containing three contrapuntal musical instrument voices with distinct timbres. ...|$|E
40|$|Most metastatic {{melanoma}} patients fail {{to respond to}} available therapy, underscoring the need for novel approaches to identify new effective treatments. In this study, we screened 2, 000 compounds from the <b>Spectrum</b> <b>Library</b> at a concentration of 1 Mmol/L using two chemoresistant melanoma cell lines (M- 14 and SK-Mel- 19) and a spontaneously immortalized, nontumorigenic melanocyte cell line (melan-a). We identified 10 compounds that inhibited {{the growth of the}} melanoma cells yet were largely nontoxic to melanocytes. Strikingly, 4 of the 10 compounds (mebendazole, albendazole, fenbendazole, and oxybendazole) are benzimidazoles, a class of structurally related, tubulin-disrupting drugs. Mebendazole was prioritized to further characterize its mechanism of melanoma growth inhibition based on its favorable pharmacokinetic profile. Our data reveal that mebendazole inhibits melanoma growth with an average IC 50 of 0. 32 Mmol/L and preferentially induces apoptosis in melanoma cells compared with melanocytes. The intrinsic apoptotic response is mediated through phosphorylation of Bcl- 2, which occurs rapidly after treatment with mebendazole in melanoma cells but not in melanocytes. Phosphorylation of Bcl- 2 in melanoma cells prevents its interaction with proapoptotic Bax, thereby promoting apoptosis. We further show that mebendazole-resistant melanocytes can be sensitized through reduction of Bcl- 2 protein levels, showing the essential role of Bcl- 2 in the cellular response to mebendazole-mediated tubulin disruption. Our results suggest that this screening approach is useful for identifying agents that show promise in the treatment of even chemoresistant melanoma and identifies mebendazole as a potent, melanoma-specific cytotoxic agent.

To curate or merge large <b>spectra</b> <b>libraries</b> a robust (and fast) duplicate detection is needed.

In order to compensate for slight variations of the mapped spectra, we use appropriate hashing functions according to the locality sensitive hashing scheme, and identify duplicates by hashcollisions. ...|$|R

The structure of the acidic part of all the choline esters prepared are derived from benzoic or cinnamic acids with hydroxy or methoxy substituants in ortho, para or meta position. Pure aromatic choline esters were synthesised according to a fast method using bromocholine bromide. An aromatic acid (in excess) in methanol is first neutralised by NaOH (0. 1 N). Then bromocholine bromide in methanol is added in the evaporation flask. Solvent is evaporated to dryness using a rotative evaporator Büchi (40 °C).
