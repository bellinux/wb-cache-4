40|$|A full {{nonlinear}} physical ‘in-service’ {{model was}} built for a rail vehicle secondary suspension hydraulic damper with shim-pack-type valves. In the modelling process, a <b>shim</b> <b>pack</b> deflection theory with an equivalent-pressure correction factor was proposed, and a Finite Element Analysis (FEA) approach was applied. Bench test results validated the damper model over its full velocity range and thus also proved that the proposed <b>shim</b> <b>pack</b> deflection theory and the FEA-based parameter identification approach are effective. The validated full damper model was subsequently incorporated into a detailed vehicle dynamics simulation to study how its key in-service parameter variations influence the secondary-suspension-related vehicle system dynamics. The obtained nonlinear physical in-service damper model and the vehicle dynamic response characteristics in this study {{could be used in}} the product design optimization and nonlinear optimal specifications of high-speed rail hydraulic dampers...|$|E
40|$|Whatman 41 Paper {{electrophoresis}} employing Barbital buffer pH (9. 0) at 300 volts for 3 hours {{separated the}} Vipera russelli (Indian Russell’s viper) venom in its basic components. This lead preliminary experiment helped {{in the selection}} of an appropriate HPLC (<b>Shim</b> <b>Pack</b> CLC-ODS (M)) column in a reverse operation/separation mode using 75 % Acetonitrile as an eluent. Subsequent reverse phase preparative HPLC fractionated, the crude Russell’s viper venom into 10 peaks, whose protein contents were quantitatively determined by the FCR method. Peak which showed the highest protein concentration was further subjected to SDS-PAGE electrophoresis, molecular weight determination and procoagulant activity profile...|$|E
40|$|Since {{hesperidin}} {{is a poor}} {{water soluble}} compound, in pharmaceutical formulations its methylated derivatives (hesperidin methyl chalcone, HMC) are used. The {{aim of this study}} was to establish an efficient methylation method for preparation of hesperidin methyl derivatives. For this purpose hesperidin was isolated from tangerine peel, purified and its methyl derivatives were prepared using three different techniques, i. e. diazomethane, methyl iodide-sodium hydride and dimethylsulfate. The efficiency of the methods was evaluated in terms of the percentage of unchanged and intact hesperidin in the final methylated products the and amount of unchanged hesperidin was an indication of the better efficiency of the method. A reversed phase HPLC method was also developed for determination and quantification of hesperidin in the final methylated products. The method involved the use of a <b>Shim</b> <b>pack</b> CLC-ODS column, a mixture of methanol-phosphate buffer (37 : 63, v/v) of pH = 2. 6 as a mobile phase in an isocratic mode at a flow rate of 1 ml/min and UV detection at 280 nm. The results showed that methylation with methyl iodide-sodium hydride have the highest efficiency among different methylation methods...|$|E
50|$|When {{a driver}} like an {{electric}} motor or a turbine is coupled to a pump, generator, or any other piece of equipment, {{it is essential that}} the shafts of the two pieces are aligned. Any misalignment between the two increases the stress on the shafts and will almost certainly result in excessive wear and premature breakdown of the equipment. This can be very costly. When the equipment is down, production might be down. Also bearings or mechanical seals may be damaged and need to be replaced. Flexible couplings are designed to allow a driver (electric motor, engine, turbine, hydraulic motor) to be connected to the driven equipment. Flexible couplings use an elastomeric insert to allow a slight degree of misalignment. Flexible couplings can also use <b>shim</b> <b>packs.</b> These couplings are called disc couplings. Tools used to achieve alignment may be mechanical or optical, like the Laser shaft alignment method, or they are gyroscope based. The gyroscope based systems can be operated very time efficient and can also be even used if the shafts have a large distance (e.g. on marine vessels).|$|R
40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} project was be to compare and contrast the selected materials used in step measurements during pre-fits of thermal protection system tiles and to compare and contrast the accuracy of measurements made using these selected materials. The reasoning for conducting this test was to obtain a clearer understanding to which of these materials may yield the highest accuracy rate of exacting measurements {{in comparison to the}} completed tile bond. These results in turn will be presented to United Space Alliance and Boeing North America for their own analysis and determination. Aerospace structures operate under extreme thermal environments. Hot external aerothermal environments in high Mach number flights lead to high structural temperatures. The differences between tile heights from one to another are very critical during these high Mach reentries. The Space Shuttle Thermal Protection System is a very delicate and highly calculated system. The thermal tiles on the ship are measured to within an accuracy of. 001 of an inch. The accuracy of these tile measurements is critical to a successful reentry of an orbiter. This is why it is necessary to find the most accurate method for measuring the height of each tile in comparison to each of the other tiles. The test results indicated that there were indeed differences in the selected materials used in step measurements during prefits of Thermal Protection System Tiles and that Bees' Wax yielded a higher rate of accuracy when compared to the baseline test. In addition, testing for experience level in accuracy yielded no evidence of difference to be found. Lastly the use of the Trammel tool over the <b>Shim</b> <b>Pack</b> yielded variable difference for those tests...|$|E
40|$|Rabbit mammary-gland {{prolactin}} (Prl) receptors in the microsomal fraction were solubilized in 7. 5 mM-Chaps) or 1 % Triton X- 100 and analysed by {{ion-exchange chromatography}} using DEAE-Bio-Gel A. Prl receptors {{in the presence}} of 7. 5 mM-Chaps were separated into two different fractions (Fr. A and B), both of which showed identical specificity of binding to peptide hormones as those in the Chaps or Triton extract. oPrl and human growth hormone (hGH) bound to the same site, but other non-lactogenic hormones (follicle-stimulating hormone, oGH, luteinizing hormone and insulin) failed to bind to the Prl receptors. The dissociation constant (Kd) for Prl binding to the receptors in Fr. A was about 50 % of those in Fr. B, suggesting that the rabbit mammary gland contains two types of Prl receptors, one with a high, and one with a low, Kd for Prl binding. A decrease in the concentration of Chaps in the column buffer to 4 mM caused aggregation of the receptors in Fr. A. H. p. l. c. -gel filtration, using <b>Shim</b> <b>pack</b> 150 and 300 columns connected in series, separated the receptor as a protein with an Mr of 74, 000 +/- 4, 900 (mean +/- S. D.) {{in the presence of}} 5 mM-Chaps, or of 36, 800 +/- 2, 100 in the presence of 7. 5 mM-Chaps. Sucrose-gradient-centrifugation analysis showed that the Prl-receptor complexes in the presence of 5 mM-Chaps were sedimented between gamma-globulin and bovine serum albumin (5. 56 +/- 0. 22 S). As the Chaps concentration was increased to 7. 5 mM, a further peak of the Prl-receptor complexes (4. 01 +/- 0. 23 S) appeared below ovalbumin. The present data suggest that the binding subunit causes the monomeric subunit to aggregate with itself or with another specific associated protein of similar Mr...|$|E
