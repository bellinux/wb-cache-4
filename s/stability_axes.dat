40|$|The authors {{develop a}} {{nonlinear}} longitudinal model of an aircraft modeled by rigid fuse-lage, tail, and wing, where the wing {{is attached to}} the fuselage with a torsional spring. The main focus is to retain the full nonlinearities associated with the system and to perform gust load alleviation for the model by comparing the impact of a proportional-integral-filter nonzero setpoint linear controller with control rate weighting and a nonlinear Lyapunov-based controller. The four degree of freedom longitudinal system under consideration includes the traditional longitudinal three degree of freedom aircraft model and one ad-ditional degree of freedom due to the torsion from the wing attachment. Computational simulations are performed to show the aeroelastic response of the aircraft due to a gust load disturbance with and without control.

The lift, rolling moment due to sideslip, and damping in roll and pitch for this more general case have been treated elsewhere {{on the basis of}} the theory of small disturbances. The surface potentials for angle of attack and rolling taken therefrom are used to obtain the several side-force and yawing-moment derivatives that depend on leading-edge suction, and a tentative value for the rolling moment due to yawing.

40|$|The {{development}} of micro aerial vehicles has been hindered by a poor {{understanding of the}} flight dynamics associated with the unique aerodynamic regime. This study experimentally estimates the aerodynamic damping derivatives of flat-plate wings with aspect ratios less than 3 at a Reynolds number of 7. 5 × 104; when combined with previously published results detailing the lateral and longitudinal static loads, a dynamic model is developed for low-aspect-ratio wings. The initial-condition response of the linear equations of motion shows that the loading created by roll stall results in purely aerodynamic lateral modes which, unlike conventional aircraft, are not attributed to geometric features, such as the vertical tail; this response was favorably compared with {{the integration of the}} full nonlinear equations. Themode is manifested by divergent, high-amplitude perturbations in sideslip, bank angle, and roll rate; furthermore, it is seen to be affected by angle of attack variations, which significantly alter the instantaneous value of the roll stability derivativeLβ. If the input frequency of the angle of attack oscillations is close to the natural frequency of the pure lateralmode, the bankangle is seen to drift away from its equilibriumvalue due to an attenuated restoring roll moment. This represents a previously unconsidered stabilitymode, referred to as roll-resonance, which couples the lateral and longitudinal <b>stability</b> <b>axes</b> for small perturbations from equilibrium flight conditions.

40|$|This {{program was}} {{developed}} by Ames Research Center, {{in cooperation with the}} National Transportation Safety Board, as a technique for deriving time histories of an aircraft's motion from Air Traffic Control (ATC) radar records. This technique uses the radar range and azimuth data, along with the downlinked altitude data, to derive an expanded set of data which includes airspeed, lift, attitude angles (pitch, roll, and heading), etc. This technique should prove useful as a source of data in the investigation of commercial airline accidents and in the analysis of accidents involving aircraft which do not have onboard data recorders (e. g., military, short-haul, and general aviation). The technique used to determine the aircraft motions involves smoothing of raw radar data. These smoothed results, in combination with other available information (wind profiles and aircraft performance data), are used to derive the expanded set of data. This program uses a cubic least-square fit to smooth the raw data. This moving-arc procedure provides a smoothed time history of the aircraft position, the inertial velocities, and accelerations. Using known winds, these inertial data are transformed to aircraft <b>stability</b> <b>axes</b> to provide true airspeed, thrust-drag, lift, and roll angle. Further derivation, based on aircraft dependent performance data, can determine the aircraft angle of attack, pitch, and heading angle. Results of experimental tests indicate that values derived from ATC radar records using this technique agree favorably with airborne measurements.

40|$|The {{statistical}} {{approach to}} the gust-loads problem is extended by considering the aerodynamic forces due to the lateral and longitudinal variation of instantaneous gust intensity and using them in dynamic analyses of rigid and flexible airplanes free to move vertically, in pitch, and in roll, based on the assumptions of stationarity of the process (in the statistical sense) and of linearity of the forces involved. The effect on the wing stresses of the interaction of longitudinal, vertical and lateral gusts is considered. The method of analyzing the rigid-body motions {{is similar to that}} used for analyses of the dynamic stability of airplanes, in that the equations of motion are referred to <b>stability</b> <b>axes</b> and expressed in terms of conventional stability derivatives. The method of analyzing the dynamic effects of structural flexibility consists of an extension of a numerical-integration {{approach to the}} static aeroelastic problem and is in a form which offers the possibility of calculating divergence and flutter speeds with relatively little additional effort. The mean-square values, correlation functions and power spectra of some of the aerodynamic forces required in this type of analysis are calculated for certain special correlation functions of the atmospheric turbulence and certain special lift distributions. It is shown, for instance, that the mean-square lift is substantially reduced due to the difference in instantaneous intensity of the turbulent velocity along the span if the span is relatively large compared to the integral scale of turbulence, but that the mean-square pitching moment is substantially increased if the tail length is relatively large. Also, the wing stresses due to vertical, horizontal and side gusts are shown to be statistically independent under certain conditions...|$|E

40|$|Sunjammer is a NASA {{technology}} demonstration {{mission that}} will demonstrate {{the potential for}} solar sail propulsion using a 1200 m 2 sail. Attitude control of the sail is achieved by changing the four 15 m 2 boom-tip vanes’ orientation relative to the satellite-Sun vector. A control scheme has been developed that incorporates passive <b>stability</b> about two <b>axes</b> and utilization of equilibrium-trim angles alongside a proportional-derivative (PD) controller. The attitude control system employs predetermined trim vane angles to maneuver the vehicle to a desired attitude. By observing the command history of the PD controller that maintains the desired attitude, these predetermined vane angles are adjusted autonomously. This adjustment allows for errors in sail force and moment characterization to be conducted on-orbit and provides a reduction of the required control effort. This control scheme is shown to be well suited in handling experimentally derived sail force and moment coefficients that do not assume a simplified flat-plate model.

40|$|The {{factors which}} {{influence}} {{the selection of}} landing approach speeds are discussed from the pilot's point of view. Concepts were developed and data were obtained during a landing approach flight investigation {{of a large number}} of jet airplane configurations which included straight-wing, swept-wing, and delta-wing airplanes as well as several applications of boundary-layer control. Since the fundamental limitation to further reductions in approach speed on most configurations appeared to be associated with the reduction in the pilot's ability to control flight path angle and airspeed, this problem forms the basis of the report. A simplified equation is presented showing the basic parameters which govern the flight path angle and airspeed changes, and pilot control techniques are discussed in relation to this equation. Attention is given to several independent aerodynamic characteristics which do not affect the flight path angle or airspeed directly but which determine to a large extent the effort and attention required of the pilot in controlling these factors during the approach. These include stall characteristics, <b>stability</b> about all <b>axes,</b> and changes in trim due to thrust adjustments. The report considers the relationship between piloting technique and all of the factors previously mentioned.

50|$|In {{the summer}} of 1943, a brand-new La-5 made a forced landing on a German {{airfield}} providing the Luftwaffe {{with an opportunity to}} test-fly the newest Soviet fighter. Test pilot Hans-Werner Lerche wrote a detailed report of his experience. He particularly noted that the La-5FN excelled at altitudes below 3,000 m (9,843 ft) but suffered from short range and flight time of only 40 minutes at cruise engine power. All of the engine controls (throttle, mixture, propeller pitch, radiator and cowl flaps, and supercharger gearbox) had separate levers which forced the pilot to make constant adjustments during combat or risk suboptimal performance. For example, rapid acceleration required moving no less than six levers. In contrast, contemporary German aircraft, especially the BMW 801 radial-engined variants of the Focke-Wulf Fw 190 front line fighter, had largely automatic engine controls with the pilot operating a single lever and electromechanical devices, like the Kommandogerät pioneering engine computer on the radial-engined Fw 190s, making the appropriate adjustments. Due to airflow limitations, the engine boost system (Forsazh) could not be used above 2,000 m (6,562 ft). <b>Stability</b> in all <b>axes</b> was generally good. The authority of the ailerons was deemed exceptional but the rudder was insufficiently powerful at lower speeds.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with developing suitable models for the investigation of instabilities in rigid and deformable roll coating flows. Consideration is restricted to Newtonian, incompressible fluids {{in the absence of}} inertia. In each coating flow analysed the steady two dimensional base state solutions of the system axe explored before the stability of the system is considered. The particular rigid roll coating flow that is studied in this thesis is the flow formed between an intermediate pair of contra-rotating rolls within a multiple roll coater. The base state is modelled using lubrication theory and the flow domain is terminated with simple boundary conditions. It is found that the form of the meniscus location solutions differ from those found in similax flows by previous workers and this motivates a detailed re-examination of the boundaxy conditions. A matched asymptotic analysis applicable for small capillaxy numbers Ca and small inter-roll gaps gives the leading order correction to the boundary conditions and it is found that the inclusion of the correction terms alter the results significantly. It is found that a critical roll speed ratio, Sc exists beyond which no steady two dimensional solutions exist. A simple stability hypothesis predicts the upstream meniscus to be neutrally stable at Sc and this point is associated with bead break. Under certain operating conditions the stability hypothesis predicts multiple steady states. The lineax stability of this multiple roll coating flow is investigated. Special attention is given to the relationship between the wavelength of the disturbance and the form of the boundary conditions. The main predictions of the <b>stability</b> hypothesis <b>axe</b> confirmed and an additional ribbing instability on the downstream meniscus is predicted. The base flow of a deformable roll coater is investigated using lubrication theory for the fluid and a linear elastic plain strain model for the compliant layer. The boundary conditions developed for the multiple roll problem are extended to higher values of Ca. A finite element method is developed to numerically solve the governing equations. The effects of Youngs modulus E and layer thickness L on the steady state operation of the coater are investigated. Previous workers have used spring models to describe the compliant layer with the implicit assumption that E and L- 1 have the same affect. Here it is shown that E and L- 1 have a different effect upon the meniscus location in the negative gap regime and hence the underlying assumption of all spring models is shown to be incorrect. The plain strain model is extended to include viscoelastic terms and it is shown that these terms can account for the discrepancy between experimental results and previous steady state elastic theories. The lineax stability of the deformable roll coater is investigated with the plain strain model being extended to account for lateral disturbances. The effect of E and L- 1 on the stability of the system is investigated and it is found that in keeping with the steady state results, they have a different effect on the stability of the system in the negative gap regime. It is demonstrated that perturbations to the compliant layer play a negligible role in the stability analysis and it is shown how the viscoelastic extension to the base state can be incorporated...|$|R
