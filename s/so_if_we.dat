After the public campaign in 2006 we decided that we didn't want to take that to carry on any more.|$|E

25|$|I had {{my editor}} count shots. There are 139 dance {{shots in the}} film. 111 are Natalie Portman untouched. 28 are her dance double Sarah Lane. If you do the math, that's 80% Natalie Portman. What about duration? The shots that feature the double are wide shots and rarely play for longer than one second. There are two {{complicated}} longer dance sequences that we used face replacement. Even <b>so,</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> were judging by time, over 90% would be Natalie Portman. And to be clear, Natalie did dance on pointe in pointe shoes. If {{you look at the}} final shot of the opening prologue, which lasts 85 seconds, and was danced completely by Natalie, she exits the scene on pointe. That is completely her without any digital magic. I am responding to this to put this to rest and to defend my actor. Natalie sweated long and hard to deliver a great physical and emotional performance. And I don't want anyone to think that's not her they are watching. It is.|$|E

Once in, As`ad AbuKhalil and Michael Fischbach write, they were not allowed to leave again. The group assumed complete control over the membership.

500|$|For a fight scene {{taking place}} {{on top of a}} {{speeding}} bullet train, the actors and stunt performers filmed on wires above a set piece surrounded by a greenscreen. The moving background, filmed on an elevated freeway in Tokyo, was added later. Weta Digital visual effects supervisor Martin Hill said the team adopted a [...] "Google Street View method", explaining [...] "But instead of having a big panoramic cam on top of a van, we built a rig that had eight 45 degree angle Red Epic [...] that gave us massive resolution driving down all the massive lanes of the freeway. We let a bit of air out of the tires of the van and kept a constant 60 kilometers an hour. <b>So</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> shot at 48 fps we just needed to speed up the footage by 10 times to give us the 300 kilometers an hour required." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2008, Araya stated {{uncertainty}} {{about the future of}} the band, and that he could not see himself continuing the career at a later age. He said once the band finished its upcoming album, which was the final record in their contract, the band would sit down and discuss its future. King was optimistic that the band would produce at least another two albums before considering a split: [...] "We're talking of going in the studio next February [...] and getting the next record out <b>so</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> do things in a timely manner I don't see there's any reason why we can't have more than one album out." [...] Slayer, along with Trivium, Mastodon, and Amon Amarth teamed up for a European tour titled 'The Unholy Alliance: Chapter III', throughout October and November 2008. Slayer headlined the second Mayhem Festival in the summer of 2009. Slayer along with Megadeth also co-headlined Canadian Carnage, the first time they performed together in more than 15 years when they co-headlined four shows in Canada in late June 2009 with openers Machine Head and Suicide Silence.|$|E

500|$|After the Beatles' break-up, the two collaborated musically {{and formed}} Wings in 1971. They faced derision from some fans and critics, who {{questioned}} her inclusion. She {{was nervous about}} performing with Paul, who explained, [...] "she conquered those nerves, got on with it and was really gutsy." [...] Paul defended her musical ability: [...] "I taught Linda the basics of the keyboard... She {{took a couple of}} lessons and learned some bluesy things... she did very well and made it look easier than it was... The critics would say, 'She's not really playing' or 'Look at her—she's playing with one finger.' But what they didn't know is that sometimes she was playing a thing called a Minimoog, which could only be played with one finger. It was monophonic." [...] He went on to say, [...] "We thought we were in it for the fun... it was just something we wanted to do, <b>so</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> got it wrong—big deal. We didn't have to justify ourselves." [...] Former Wings guitarist McCullough said of collaborating with Linda, [...] "trying to get things together with a learner in the group didn't work as far as I was concerned." ...|$|E
500|$|In January 2005, it was {{revealed}} Elliott {{had been working on}} a new album. Two months later, Ciara confirmed she would appear on the album, singing and rapping on the potential first untitled single at the time. Elliott worked on The Cookbook with such producers as the Neptunes, Rich Harrison and Scott Storch. The album included only two songs produced by Timbaland, who produced most or all songs on Elliott's previous albums. She explained, [...] "Me and Tim, this like our sixth album, <b>so</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> go any further left, we gonna be on Mars somewhere. We've done everything it is to do. I think both of us came to a spot where we didn't know where to go with each other." [...] She said Timbaland was very involved with the album, supporting or opposing certain producers. Elliott went on to say, [...] "I was eight songs deep and I let Tim listen and he was like, 'Nah, you're going in the wrong direction. You trippin'.' I had to go back in the studio and come up with new records. , he was like, 'This is the Missy people are listening to.'" ...|$|E
500|$|In 1932, Chuck Kocsis (the first golfer {{inducted}} into the University of Michigan Athletic Hall of Honor), enrolled at the university. When a promised alumni pledge to pay his expenses fell through, Trueblood agreed to make a loan (at five percent interest) so Kocsis could pay his tuition. The Wolverines with Kocsis won the NCAA championship twice. Kocsis recalled that the team often traveled to tournaments in Trueblood's car. [...] "Professor Trueblood had a seven-passenger Buick," [...] Kocsis said. [...] "He designated me as the chauffeur. <b>So</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> had a golf match, we'd all {{get into the car}} and go to Chicago, or go to Ohio, wherever we were going to play." [...] Another teammate recalled the trips in Trueblood's car: [...] "It wasn't a very big Buick, as I recall. [...] We rode with six guys. Chuck used to do most of the driving. I remember that trip down to Washington (for the 1935 national championship at Congressional, which Michigan won). We started in the morning and drove all the way down there. Professor Trueblood was a big guy, too." [...] Trueblood took the team on a side trip to Mount Vernon, where one of the players accidentally bumped the shifter into gear and hit the accelerator as he exited Trueblood's car. The car lurched forward; the open door hit something and was torn off its hinges.|$|E

500|$|Both {{teams had}} injury {{concerns}} {{ahead of the}} final. Liverpool {{were expected to be}} without midfielders Charlie Adam and Lucas Leiva, who were both out with knee injuries, while Chelsea were missing defenders David Luiz and Gary Cahill to hamstring injuries. Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard was determined to claim a domestic double with victory in the final: [...] "The FA Cup is special, but we got a taste of success from winning the Carling Cup. That will help the younger players in the squad. Winning breeds confidence and you want more." [...] Gerrard believed success in the final would compensate for a poor season in the Premier League: [...] "We are all aware we have underachieved in the league and the squad of players is certainly better than where we are. We will assess the season and if we win two trophies I think it would alleviate the pressure slightly." [...] Chelsea captain John Terry was hopeful Chelsea would win the final, to help caretaker manager Roberto Di Matteo's hopes of getting the job full-time: [...] "To win it [...] will put himself in a very good position. He's not thinking of that at the moment, he's not letting the players get distracted by anything. He's very passionate, he's Chelsea through and through, and that's certainly rubbed off on the players. <b>So,</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> can do it with the added bonus that Robbie can get the job at the end, that'd be great." ...|$|E
