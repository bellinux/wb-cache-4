Special focus was given to the large water accessible area of myosin <b>S</b> 1 <b>units,</b> surface hydrophobicity of proteins and factors affecting the hydrophobicity. Also the possible mechanisms of water-holding in meat were briefly introduced. The aim of the thesis was to study the effect of different ions and pH values on the surface hydrophobicity of the myosin <b>S</b> 1 <b>units,</b> adding knowledge {{to the understanding of the}} interaction between myosin <b>S</b> 1 <b>units</b> and water. Myosin <b>S</b> 1 <b>units</b> were prepared from porcine longissimus dorsi muscle 48 h postmortem. Obtained myosin <b>S</b> 1 <b>units</b> were subjected to 0. 2 M, 0. 4 M and 0. 6 M ionic strength of NaCl and KCl and to pH 5. 0, 5. 5, 6. 0, 6. 5 and 7. 0. The surface hydrophobicity of myosin <b>S</b> 1 <b>units</b> was measured by fluorescent molecular probe (cis-Parinaric acid) method. The method of purifying myosin <b>S</b> 1 <b>units</b> from porcine longissimus dorsi muscle 48 h postmortem was established under the conditions of our laboratory. Surface hydrophobicity was found to increase with increasing ionic strength of both KCl and NaCl. Concerning the different ions studied, only at 0. 6 M, significantly higher surface hydrophobicity of myosin <b>S</b> 1 <b>units</b> was measured in KCl compared to NaCl. This phenomenon is in accordance with chaotropic effect of K+ and Cl- and kosmotropic effect of Na+. Regarding the effect of pH, within KCl samples, more hydrophobicity myosin <b>S</b> 1 <b>unit</b> was detected towards to the more acidic direction pH values than pH 6. 0. For NaCl samples, at pH 5. 5 and 6. 0, surface hydrophobicity was significantly higher than at pH 5. 0, 6. 5 and 7. 0. Differences may have been induced by the changes in the net charges of protein, and further in protein conformation. Considering the property of the protein surface, more hydrophobic protein results in less water-protein interaction. However, to look at the whole scenario of the interaction between myosin <b>S</b> 1 <b>units</b> and water, changes of net charges of myosin <b>S</b> 1 <b>units</b> and water structure at vicinity of them should be further studied...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{proteasome}} is a multimeric and multicatalytic intracellular protease {{responsible for}} the degradation of proteins involved in cell cycle control, various signaling processes, antigen presentation, and control of protein synthesis. The central catalytic complex of the proteasome is called the 20 S core particle. The majority of these are flanked on one or both sides by regulatory units. Most common among these units is the 19 <b>S</b> regulatory <b>unit.</b> When coupled to the 19 <b>S</b> <b>unit,</b> the complex is termed the asymmetric or symmetric 26 S proteasome depending on whether one or both sides are coupled to the 19 <b>S</b> <b>unit,</b> respectively. The 26 S proteasome recognizes poly-ubiquitinylated substrates targeted for proteolysis. Targeted proteins interact with the 19 <b>S</b> <b>unit</b> where they are deubiquitinylated, unfolded, and translocated to the 20 S catalytic chamber for degradation. The 26 S proteasome is {{responsible for the}} degradation of major proteins involved in the regulation of the cellular cycle, antigen presentation and control of protein synthesis. Alternatively, the proteasome is also active when dissociated from regulatory units. This free pool of 20 S proteasome is described in yeast to mammalian cells. The free 20 S proteasome degrades proteins by a process independent of poly-ubiquitinylation and ATP consumption. Oxidatively modified proteins and other substrates are degraded in this manner. The 20 S proteasome comprises two central heptamers (β-rings) where the catalytic sites are located and two external heptamers (α-rings) that are responsible for proteasomal gating. Because the 20 S proteasome lacks regulatory units, it is unclear what mechanisms regulate the gating of α-rings between open and closed forms. In the present review, we discuss 20 S proteasomal gating modulation through a redox mechanism, namely, S-glutathionylation of cysteine residues located in the α-rings, and the consequence of this post-translational modification on 20 S proteasomal function...|$|R

30|$|Lignin is {{the main}} {{obstacle}} to the hydrolysis of polysaccharides. Plant cell walls consist of cellulose microfibrils embedded in an amorphous matrix of lignin and hemicelluloses through chemical and physical interactions, in which covalent bonds {{are considered to be}} present between lignin and hemicelluloses [6, 7]. The difficulty in degrading lignin results from not only interaction with polysaccharides, but also the inherent complexity of the chemical structure. Phenylpropane units with three different methoxy substitutions on the aromatic rings, known as guaiacyl (G), syringyl (S), and p-hydroxyphenyl (H) units, are connected via C–O and C–C linkages, including primarily β-O- 4, β- 5, β-β, 5 - 5, 4 -O- 5, and β- 1 types [8, 9]. The resulting lignin macromolecule cannot be isolated in an unmodified form. The relative amounts of G, <b>S,</b> and H <b>units</b> vary between plants species and influence lignin degradability due to differences in the reactivity of each unit [10, 11]. In general, gymnosperm woods (softwood) contain only G units, angiosperm woods (hardwood) have both G and <b>S</b> <b>units,</b> and grasses have additional H units. In the alkaline delignification process of kraft pulping, <b>S</b> <b>units</b> are known to be more readily removed than G units [11, 12].|$|R
40|$|The {{administration}} of glucocorticoids {{has been shown}} to induce atrophy and weakness in whole skeletal muscle. These effects frequently appear to be more pronounced in pale muscle than in red muscle. The present study was undertaken {{to examine the effects of}} steroid treatment on the contractile, electrical, and fatigue properties of single meter units in pale and red cat hindlimb muscles. Single motor units in the medial gastrocnemius (MG) and soleus muscles were isolated using techniques developed by McPhedran, et al., (1965). The properties of a large number of motor units were examined in normal animals and were compared to those of single units from the muscles of steroid-treated (3 - 4 mg. of triamcinolone acetonide per kg. per day for 10 - 16 days) animals. Motor units examined in both control and experimental animals were classified by type according to criteria developed by Burke, et al., (1973, 1974). The results show that steroids produce alterations in the strength- and speed-related properties of motor units which are more pronounced in fast-twitch than in slow-twitch units. The mean maximum tetanic tension (Pmax) for types FF (fast-twitch, readily fatiguable) and FR (fast-twitch, fatigue-resistant) units in MG were reduced by 63 % and 71 % respectively; The Pmax for type <b>S</b> <b>units</b> in MG was reduced by 25 % as a result of steroid treatment but was unchanged for type <b>S</b> <b>units</b> in soleus. The mean maximum rate of rise of tetanic tension (dP/dt) for the three classes of motor units in MG was reduced in a pattern similar to that for tetanic tension. The dP/dt for types FF, FR, and <b>S</b> <b>units</b> in MG were reduced by 79 %, 54 %, and 25 % respectively. The dP/dt for soleus units was increased by 73 % as compared to control soleus units. Steroid treatment lengthened the mean twitch contraction time (CF) of FF units and shortened the CT for type <b>S</b> <b>units</b> in both MG and soleus. The integrated EMG signals elicited from FF and FR units were unchanged following steroid treatment but were significantly increased for type <b>S</b> <b>units</b> in both pale and red muscles. Steroid administration did not markedly alter the susceptibility to fatigue of the three classes of units in MG or in soleus units. There were however fewer MG units with intermediate fatigue indeces in steroid-treated animals. These finding suggest that those units most frequently activated in muscular contractions are the least susceptible to steroid-induced changes in their contractile properties and vice versa. Since the overall frequency of activation of motor uﬁits is determined by cell size, these results imply that the Size Principle (Hennemann, et al., 1965) can be extended to not only explain the recruitment order of motor units in muscular contractions but also to account for the patterns of motor unit involvement in steroid-induced myopathy...|$|R
