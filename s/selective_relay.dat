With the conventional automatic-repeat-request (ARQ) protocol, the destination re-quests retransmission from each node individually without any node cooperation. We propose two protocols, <b>selective</b> <b>relay</b> cooperation and dynamic network coded cooperation, utilizing the fact that underwater nodes can overhear the transmission of the others. In the <b>selective</b> <b>relay</b> cooperation, one node can be selected as a relay to transmit the data from another undecoded node in the retransmission phase. In the network coded cooperation, the selected relay nodes transmit network coded packets to the destination. The relay nodes participating the cooperation are selected by the destination based on the channel quality, {{as measured by the}} effective signal to noise ratio. In addition to simulation results, we have carried out several lake tests based on a full protocol implementation.

Specifically, in the spectrum sensing phase, only selected cognitive relays are utilized to transmit/forward their initial detection results (without a dedicated sensing relay channel) to a cognitive source for fusion, where the dedicated sensing channel {{refers to the}} channel transmitting initial spectrum sensing results from cognitive relays to the cognitive source. In the data transmission phase, only the best relay is selected to assist the cognitive source for its data transmissions. By jointly considering the two phases, we derive a closed-form expression of the outage probability for the SRSS-BRDT scheme over Rayleigh fading channels.

40|$|Two {{algorithms}} {{based on}} an energy conserving dynamic transmit power threshold are proposed for improving the lifetime in relay networks utilizing <b>selective</b> <b>relay</b> strategies with amplify-and-forward (AF) relays. the lifetime of the relay network {{is defined as the}} maximum number of successfully received messages satisfying a desired SNR at the destination under probability of outage constraints. In the first algorithm, the predicted outage probability, calculated based on the energy conserving dynamic threshold, is constrained at each transmission. In this case, when the number of relays is large, the improvement is substantial. As the number of relays decreases, the method improves the lifetime under the condition of high initial energy levels at the relays. In the second method, targeting applications which are not sensitive to the distribution of outage throughout the lifetime of the relay network, the predicted probability of outage, calculated based on laws-of-physics limitations only, is constrained at each transmission. Using the second method, greater lifetime improvements are achieved and average outage constraints are maintained at the expense of a few instantaneous outage probability violations.

Approximations for the optimal threshold values that minimize the e 2 e BER and the resulting performance are derived analytically for BPSK modulation. Using the derived threshold the e 2 e BER can be reduced significantly compared to simple digital relaying. By studying the performance under different models, it is shown that knowledge of the instantaneous source-destination SNR at the relay can be exploited.

40|$|Abstract—Threshold {{relaying}} is {{an effective}} technique to achieve cooperative diversity in uncoded cooperative wireless networks, which suffer from error propagation due to detection errors at the relays. This paper analyzes the asymptotic end-toend (e 2 e) bit error rate (BER) of threshold digital relaying. A three node network with a source, destination and relay and with links experiencing independent Rayleigh fading is considered. It is shown that, as the average link signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) are increased simultaneously, the optimal threshold that minimizes the e 2 e BER increases as log(SNR). The resulting e 2 e BER decreases as log(SNR) /SNR 2. Moreover, any threshold of the form log(c SNR), where c is a positive constant, achieves the same order of e 2 e BER as the one achieved by the optimal threshold and provides dual diversity. A value of c that performs {{very close to the}} optimal threshold is also proposed.

Such protocols are particularly attractive for systems that do not use error detection/correction codes due to tight energy constraints. One possible application is sensor networks, which typically function under extremely limited battery-supplied energy.

In the second case, the interferers are assumed to have fixed number and locations. Exact {{outage probability}} in the form of one-dimensional integral is derived. For both cases, closed-form expressions of lower bounds and asymptotic expressions for high signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio are also provided. Simplified closed-form expressions of outage probability for special cases (e. g., dominant interferences, i. i. d. interferers, Rayleigh distributed signals) are studied. Numerical results are presented to show the accuracy of our analysis by examining the effects of the number and locations of interferers on the outage performances of both AF systems with random and fixed interferers...|$|R
40|$|Extended {{version of}} the article {{submitted}} to IEEE TWirelessIn this paper, we study power allocation strategies for a fixed-gain amplify-and-forward relay network employing multiple relays. We consider two optimization problems for the relay network: 1) maximizing the end-to-end signalto- noise ratio (SNR) and 2) minimizing the total power consumption while maintaining the end-to-end SNR over a threshold value. We investigate these two problems for two relaying protocols of all-participate (AP) <b>relaying</b> and <b>selective</b> <b>relaying</b> and two cases of feedback to the relays, full and limited. We show that the SNR maximization problem is concave and the power minimization problem is convex for all protocols and feedback cases considered. We obtain closed-form expressions for the two problems {{in the case of}} full feedback and solve the problems through convex programming for limited feedback. Numerical results show the benefit of having full feedback at the relays for both optimization problems. However, they also show that feedback overhead can be reduced by having only limited feedback to the relays with only a small degradation in performance...|$|R
40|$|This paper studies power {{allocation}} {{for performance}} constrained dual-hop variable-gain amplify-and-forward (AF) relay networks in Nakagami- $m$ fading. In this context, the performance constraint is formulated as a constraint on the end-to-end signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) {{and the overall}} power consumed is minimized while maintaining this constraint. This problem is considered under two different assumptions of the available channel state information (CSI) at the relays, namely full CSI at the relays and partial CSI at the relays. In addition to the power minimization problem, we also consider the end-to-end SNR maximization problem under a total power constraint for the partial CSI case. We provide closed-form solutions for all the problems which are easy to implement except in two cases, namely <b>selective</b> <b>relaying</b> with partial CSI for power minimization and SNR maximization, where we give the solution {{in the form of}} a one-variable equation which can be solved efficiently. Numerical results are then provided to characterize the performance of the proposed power allocation algorithms considering the effects of channel parameters and CSI availability. © 2014 IEEE...|$|R
