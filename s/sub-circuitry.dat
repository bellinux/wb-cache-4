40|$|Co-cultures {{containing}} dissociated cortical and thalamic cells {{may provide}} a unique model for understanding the pathophysiology in the respective neuronal <b>sub-circuitry.</b> In addition, developing an in vitro dissociated co-culture model offers the possibility of studying the system without influence from other neuronal sub-populations. Here we demonstrate a dual compartment system coupled to microelectrode arrays (MEAs) for co-culturing and recording spontaneous activities from neuronal sub-populations. Propagation of electrical activities between cortical and thalamic regions and their interdependence in connectivity is verified {{by means of a}} cross-correlation algorithm. We found that burst events originate in the cortical region and drive the entire cortical-thalamic network bursting behavior while mutually weak thalamic connections play a relevant role in sustaining longer burst events in cortical cells. To support these experimental findings, a neuronal network model was developed and used to investigate the interplay between network dynamics and connectivity in the cortical-thalamic system...|$|E
40|$|Fast {{oscillations}} of {{the population}} firing rate in the high gamma range (50 - 200 Hz), where individual neurons fire slowly and irregularly, are observed in the living brain and in network models of leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons, that have also been studied analytically [1]. However, a systematic approach identifying sub-circuits responsible for specific oscillations in a structured network of neural populations is currently unavailable. We consider a large-scale, neural network consisting of 4 layers each composed of an excitatory and inhibitory population of LIF-neurons with connectivity determined by electrophysiological and anatomical studies [2]. In simulations we observe a peak in the power spectrum around 83 Hz in all populations and low frequency oscillations with smaller power in a subset {{of the population}}s. Mapping the dynamics of the fluctuations to an effective linear rate model, using the recently derived transfer function for LIF-neurons with synaptic filtering [3], we derive the spectra of the population firing rates analytically. Decomposing the noise-driven fluctuations into eigenmodes of the effective connectivity, we identify the modes responsible for peaks in the spectra. Applying perturbation theory, we quantify the influence of individual anatomical connections on the spectrum at given frequencies and identify a <b>sub-circuitry,</b> localized in the supra-granular and granular layer, generating the oscillation. These findings are in agreement with layer-specific local field potential measurements in the Macaque primary visual cortex, where gamma-frequency oscillations were mostly pronounced in layer 2, 3 and 4 B [4]. We exploit this method i) to identify the connectivity loops responsible for the observed peaks and ii) to alter the circuitry in a targeted manner to control the position and amplitude of the peaks and the generation of slow frequency fluctuations. This requires removal and addition of only small numbers of synapses. The analytical framework moreover explains the suppression of higher frequencies by distributed delays and the amplification of population specific oscillatory input. Mapping the stimulus vector onto the eigenmodes of the system shows how the components of the input vector are processed in the network. Thus one can derive the sensitivity of the population rate dynamics to the direction and frequency of stimuli. Our method finds application in the identification of the connectivity loops that determine emergent and externally driven global measures of activity observable in experiments as well as in engineering circuits that exhibit desired correlations on the population level...|$|E
40|$|International audiencePicture naming is a {{standard}} task used to probe language processes in healthy and impaired speakers. It recruits a broad neural network of language related areas, among which the hippocampus is rarely included. However, the hippocampus could play a role during picture naming, subtending, for example, implicit learning of the links between pictured objects and their names. To test this hypothesis, we recorded hippocampal activity during plain picture naming, without memorization requirement; we further assessed whether this activity was modulated by contextual factors such as repetition priming and semantic interference. Local field potentials recorded from intracerebral electrodes implanted in the healthy hippocampi of epileptic patients revealed a specific and reliable pattern of activity, markedly modulated by repetition priming and semantic context. These {{results indicate that the}} hippocampus is recruited during picture naming, presumably in relation to implicit learning, with contextual factors promoting differential hippocampal processes, possibly subtended by different <b>sub-circuitries.</b> (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Inc...|$|R
40|$|All {{metazoan}} organisms must reproduce {{and defend}} themselves {{in order to}} survive as individuals and as a species. These innate behaviors are so crucial that they are "hard-wired" into the brain during the animalâ€™s development. They are also released primarily by the olfactory stimuli detected by the AOB, which synapses into the MEA. The MEA in turn projects to the medial hypothalamic behavior control column, which contains a series of nuclei orchestrating either reproductive or defensive behaviors. These amygdalar-hypothalamic projections are topographically organized, and the <b>sub-circuitries</b> controlling reproduction and defense are segregated both functionally and anatomically. The topographically organized projections suggest that these neural pathways for reproduction and defense are likely genetically determined, but genes that might control their wiring have not yet been identified. Such a parallel circuit organization with very few cross-talks between the two sub-circuits also poses the problem of how rapid decisions between competing reproductive and defensive behaviors are made by organisms faced with conflicting cues. Using oligonucleotide microarrays and laser-capture microdissection, I identified that several LIM homeodomain transcription factors mark different regions of the MEA involved in either reproductive or defensive behaviors. I have characterized the projections of these neurons to the hypothalamus, using both genetically encoded anterograde and traditional retrograde tracers. I have also carried out behavioral experiments to assess their differential activations by reproductive and defensive stimuli. My results indicate that Lhx 6 delineates a reproductive pathway, which involves neurons in both MEApd and BSTpr, and their projections to the three reproductive nuclei in the hypothalamic medial behavioral control column (MPN, VMHvl and PMv). Further analysis reveals, counter-intuitively, that VMHvl receives inhibitory projections from this reproductive pathway, and a convergent excitatory projection from neurons in MEApv that are activated by a predator odor. The results suggest that this point-of-convergence may serve to "gate" the expression of reproductive behavior, under conditions where animals are exposed to threatening stimuli. Thus, my data identifies a potential neural substrate within the hypothalamus for controlling behavioral decisions in the face of conflicting cues and a transcription factor family that may {{contribute to the development of}} this substrate...|$|R
