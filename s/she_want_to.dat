6000|$|Did <b>she</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> do that? Did <b>she</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> {{sell her}} pearl-backed brush and mirror, her silver candlestick, her pendant, her lovely little necklace, and go dressed in drab like the Wherrys: the unlovely uncombed Wherrys, {{who were the}} [...] "poor" [...] to her? She did not.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, what {{in nature}} can <b>she</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> know that for, Ordeal Bumgrum?" [...] Mrs. Abbott {{pronounced}} this singular name, however, [...] "Ordeel." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Do <b>she</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> hear or see any more, or don't she?' the {{corporal}} inquired, with a {{sense that}} his time was getting wasted.|$|E
5000|$|Donâ€™t mix forms: [...] "She <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> sing, <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> act, <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> be a dancer." ...|$|R
5000|$|Do use {{the same}} forms in each clause: [...] "She <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> sing, <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> act, <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> dance." ...|$|R
60|$|The sisters sat silent, {{waiting for}} the wedding party to come out. Gudrun was {{impatient}} of talk. <b>She</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> think about Gerald Crich. <b>She</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> see if the strong feeling she had got from him was real. <b>She</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> have herself ready.|$|R
6000|$|Was Emma's mind {{disengaged}} {{enough for}} curiosity, or did <b>she</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> quit the subject! She said--'You {{have had a}} trial of this kind yourself?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{if she can}} see him {{in other}} places why should <b>she</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> see him here?" [...] Edward persisted in a voice {{destitute}} of expression.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Alsager {{was silent}} a moment; then she asked, a little inconsequently, {{as if she}} had come back from a reverie: [...] "Does <b>she</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> VERY much?" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> {{look in his}} eyes. <b>She</b> <b>wanted</b> him <b>to</b> look at her.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, Dominique, but I don't {{think that}} <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> trade at all. What <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> {{do is to}} lie up quietly, where {{she would not be}} noticed." ...|$|R
60|$|She said <b>she</b> didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> know them. <b>She</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> {{go down on}} Monday, early.|$|R
6000|$|But did <b>she</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> find Mr. Otter? She had {{inherited}} {{much of the}} old cutter's independence. How much better {{it would be if}} she could find work and support herself without calling on him for aid! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] said Herr Paul {{raising his}} brows till his glasses fell from his nose: [...] "And what says Gretchen? Does <b>she</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be handed up to posterities a little peacock {{along with the}} other little birds?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know about}} loving her dearly. They were intimate, and Mrs. Finn {{used to be}} with her very much {{when she was in the}} country. She was at Matching just now, when my poor mother died. Why does <b>she</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> see you?" ...|$|E
60|$|She was sorry. <b>She</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> climb. <b>She</b> didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be a quitter. But {{she was at}} an impasse.|$|R
25|$|Elbe began a {{relationship}} with French art dealer Claude Lejeune, whom <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> marry and with whom <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> have children. <b>She</b> {{was looking forward to}} her final surgery involving a uterus transplant.|$|R
50|$|In 2009, <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> join in {{politics}} but later delayed her candidature. She decided {{to continue as}} a sportsman and <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> be in London. Maybe one day she will be president of Ecuador.|$|R
6000|$|... "That if any gentleman, {{who sees}} {{her to be}} his equal in polish, should want to marry her, and <b>she</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> marry him, he sha'n't be {{superior}} to her in pocket. Now do ye think after this that you be good enough for her?" ...|$|E
6000|$|On Saturday morning Soames {{had found}} her at her writing-table with a note written to Swithin, putting him off. Why did <b>she</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> put him off? he asked. She might put her own people off when she liked, {{he would not have}} her putting off his people! ...|$|E
60|$|They went on {{with their}} angling. What {{embarrassing}} question would Kitty ask next? Would <b>she</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be told why her father had left her? No: the last image in the child's mind had been the image of Sydney Westerfield. She was still thinking of it when she spoke again.|$|E
6000|$|... 'And {{woman is}} the same as horses: two wills act in {{opposition}} inside her. With one will, <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> subject herself utterly. With the other <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> bolt, and pitch her rider to perdition.' ...|$|R
60|$|In {{coming out}} and earning her own living {{she had made a}} strong, cruel move towards freeing herself. But having more freedom she only became more profoundly aware of the big <b>want.</b> <b>She</b> <b>wanted</b> so many things. <b>She</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> read great, {{beautiful}} books, and be rich with them; <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> see beautiful things, and have the joy of them for ever; <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> know big, free people; and there remained always the <b>want</b> <b>she</b> could put no name to.|$|R
60|$|The end had come, {{and there}} was nothing more to be done. Struggling, fighting, scheming, could be of no avail now; but <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> get <b>to</b> her husband; <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> be near him now that death was so {{imminent}} both for him and for her.|$|R
6000|$|... "I couldn't help it," [...] she {{declared}} after church. [...] "What'd <b>she</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> {{stare at me}} like that for? Such manners! I'm GLAD stuck my tongue out at her. I wish I'd stuck it farther out. Say, I saw Rob MacAllister from over-harbour there. Wonder if he'll tell Mrs. Wiley on me." ...|$|E
60|$|Why had {{she left}} Sabbath-school? Why? Oh, yes. What did he (McSnagley) {{want to tell}} her she was wicked for? What did he tell her that God hated her for? If God hated her, what did <b>she</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> go to Sabbath school for? She didn't want to be beholden to anybody who hated her.|$|E
6000|$|... "She cry half 'e time, sah--den {{she look}} up bold, and resolute, just like ole Massar, sah, when he tell he rijjement 'charge baggonet,' and {{seem as if}} <b>she</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> go right into T'ousandacres' huts. Lor' bless me, sah, Masser Mordaunt--if she ask me one {{question}} about you to-day, she ask me a hundred!" ...|$|E
6000|$|LORD WINDERMERE. Margaret, {{you could}} save this woman. <b>She</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> {{get back into}} society, and <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> you <b>to</b> help her. [Crossing to her.] ...|$|R
60|$|Carrie looked thoughtful. She {{knew the}} wilds would draw Jake back and Jim must soon go, but the North was a stern country and <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> keep {{them for a}} time. She was honest and owned that <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> keep both.|$|R
60|$|A {{quick change}} came over her. She mistrusted herself, she mistrusted the outer world. <b>She</b> did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> go on, <b>she</b> did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> {{go out into}} it, <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> go no further.|$|R
6000|$|He {{stopped a}} moment {{and looked at his}} {{companion}} steadily. [...] "It's rather a curious thing that, when I suggested she might like a run over to Barrock-holme, she didn't seem to want to go. And there's another point that's puzzling me. When I mention the crescent or the pearls, why does <b>she</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> change the subject?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, my golly!" [...] said Jeekie, shaking till {{his great}} knees knocked together, [...] "oh! my golly! here pretty go. She {{think you want}} bury me all alive. That mean <b>she</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be rid of Jeekie, because he got sit there and play {{gooseberry}} when she wish talk alone with you. Oh, yes! I see her little game." ...|$|E
60|$|Freddie, too, was in trouble. But did <b>she</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> comfort Freddie? No. On the contrary, she {{was already}} regretting her promise, so lightly given before luncheon, to go and sit with him that afternoon. A well-marked feeling of {{annoyance}} {{that he should have}} been so silly as to tumble downstairs and sprain his ankle was her chief sentiment respecting Freddie.|$|E
30|$|<b>She</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> {{clean the}} house.|$|R
50|$|<b>She</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> ban corned beef.|$|R
60|$|Then, {{for some}} reason, she must call in Rouen {{on the way}} back to London. He had an instinctive mistrust of her desire for the place. But, perversely, <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> go there. It was as if <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> try its effect upon her.|$|R
