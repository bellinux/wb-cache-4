50|$|The idea of {{spreading}} seed also occurred to Alan Pritchard, a pilot for the New Zealand Public Works Department, {{as he was}} flying E. Madden of the Ministry of Works in a de Havilland Moth, sharing grapes and throwing the seeds out of the open cockpits. A few months later Pritchard was tasked with conducting an aerial survey in Northland. The survey was delayed when the Ministry's Miles Whitney Straight, ZK-AFH, was grounded by bad weather. A supervisor, J. L. Harrison, complained that Pritchard was holding back men needed to sow lupin seed. Remembering the grape seeds, Pritchard suggested sowing the seed by air. Burying the hatchet, Harrison and Pritchard spent that evening experimenting with methods of dispersal, before settling on sewing a sack onto a piece of downpipe. The following morning, 8 March 1939, Pritchard flew over Ninety Mile Beach while Harrison, on his signal, held the downpipe out a window and emptied the sack. They then landed and examined {{the spread of the}} seeds. It was found a distribution of 1 seed per square foot was obtained from a height of 100 to 150 ft. On Monday 10 March, they sowed 375 acre, using 2 lb/acre (224 kg/km2) instead of the 5 lb/acre (560 kg/km2) used when <b>sowing</b> <b>by</b> <b>hand.</b> The pair returned to examine the site at 2 weeks, 1 month and 2 years and at all points the aerially sown land was indistinguishable from that sown by hand.|$|E

The grains used for sowing are the best grains kept from the precedent harvest and are <b>sown</b> <b>by</b> <b>hand</b> (broadcast seeding). Sometimes the seeds are mixed with sand to have a more homogenous repartition on the soil. The seeds remain on the surface, so successive harrowing <b>by</b> <b>hand</b> or with the daba is needed to bury them slightly in the soil. Normally 30-40 kg/ha of seeds are used, but sometimes more than 70 kg/ha are sown, in order to control weeds at time of emergence. For germination and emergence a temperature of 30 °C is optimal. The germination and growth is rapid, and for the upkeep of the crop only weeding is needed.|$|R

Three rapeseed cultivars Hayola 401 ، RGS 003 and Sarigol with three plant density levels (60, 80 and 100 plant/m 2) were studied. At the end of growing period, traits like silique number per plant, seed number per silique and 1000 seed weight, seed yield and seed oil percent were measured. The results showed that plant density and cultivars affected silique number per plant, seed number per silique, 1000 seed weight and seed yield significantly. The effects of plant density by interaction on silique number per plant, seed number per silique and seed yield were also significant. Hayola 401 produced the highest silique number per plant, seed number per silique, 1000 seed weight and seed yield. In these three cultivars under study the highest seed yield was obtained with the plant density of 80 plant/m 2.

60|$|Plants {{when first}} {{subjected}} to culture, {{even in their}} native country, cannot fail {{to be exposed to}} greatly changed conditions of life, more especially from growing in cleared ground, and from not having to compete with many or any surrounding plants. They are thus enabled to absorb whatever they require which the soil may contain. Fresh seeds are often brought from distant gardens, where the parent-plants have been subjected to different conditions. Cultivated plants like those in a state of nature frequently intercross, and will thus mingle their constitutional peculiarities. On the other hand, as long as the individuals of any species are cultivated in the same garden, they will apparently be subjected to more uniform conditions than plants in a state of nature, as the individuals have not to compete with various surrounding species.

40|$|Our {{objective}} was to study by observation and simulation the effects of (1) three different dates of seedling emergence and (2) presence of short sequences of missing plants in rows of maize canopies which we refer to as skips. Trials were carried out in Belgium and France during two consecutive years. We had eight trials in total (i. e. two experimental designs in two locations for 2 years). In a field mechanically sown with a precision drill to give 'normal plants', 'late 1 plants' and 'late 2 plants' (respectively) were <b>sown</b> <b>by</b> <b>hand</b> when 'normal plants' had germinated or emerged. The radiation available {{at the top of}} the plants was measured for each cohort which allowed the calculation of a 'coefficient of correction for light climate' corresponding to the ratio of incident light at the top of each cohort relative to normal. Heterogeneity (skips) was created in maize canopies by removing three adjacent plants situated in the same row at 16 different locations across the field. The part of the canopy affected by the presence of these skips was considered to consist of the 12 plants bordering each skip. Radiation was measured near soil level on both sides of these plants: plants of the part of the canopy affected by skips received on average the same amount of radiation as a uniform stand with a population density equal to three quarters of the density of the parts of the stand without skips. To test if differences in radiation reaching the level of plants in each cohort could explain the effects on the plants the behaviour of each cohort of plants in each location x year was modelled separately with CERES-Maize after introducing into the model a 'coefficient of correction for light climate' corresponding to each cohort x location x year combination. Simulations generally reproduced correctly decreases in LAI, total biomass, grain number and total grain yield in the late I and late 2 cohorts, but not decrease in individual grain weight. The observed loss of grain yield per unit surface area in the parts of the canopy disturbed by skips was between 7 and 15 %, whereas corresponding simulated values were between 6 and 11 %. In the absence of compensation, values in the disturbed parts would have been 20 %. Thus in our conditions amount of light reaching the different cohorts explained a large part of the treatments effects. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Hyssop (Hyssopus officinalis) is a {{perennial}} herb which is cultivated in temperate regions of Asia, Europe and America. The essential oil of hyssop {{is widely used}} as traditional drug {{in some of the}} parts of Asia and Europe to treat respiratory diseases. Hyssop is also used in food, pharmaceutical, flavor and cosmetic industries throughout the world. It is mainly used for antispasmodic, stomachic, antifungal, relax spasm and cough treatment. Applying organic fertilizers and biofertilizers such as compost, vermicompost and nitrogen fixing bacteria contain Azotobacter and Azospirillum has led to a decrease in chemical fertilizers consumption and has provided high quality agricultural products. Several studies have shown that organic and bio-fertilizers application such as vermicompost and nitrogen fixing bacteria can increase essential oil content of medicinal plants of dill, basil and fennel. The main object of this work was to record the best suitable treatment of organic and biological fertilizer to obtain highest yield of Hyssop. Materials and Methods: A field experiment, arranged in a randomized complete blocks design with eight treatments and three replications at research field of the Agriculture Company of Ran, Firouzkuh, Iran during the growing season of 2012. The treatments were (1) 20 t/ha compost, (2) 12 t/ha vermicompost, (3) biofertilizer [inoculated seeds with Azotobacter and Azospirillum], (4) 10 t/ha compost + 6 t/ha vermicompost, (5) 20 t/ha compost + biofertilizer, (6) 12 t/ha vermicompost + biofertilizer, (7) 10 t/ha compost + 6 t/ha vermicompost + biofertilizer and (8) control [without fertilizer application]. Inoculation was carried out by immersing the hyssop seeds in the cells suspension of 108 CFU/ml for 15 min. The required quantities of compost and vermicompost were applied and incorporated to the top 5 cm layer of soil in the experimental beds before planting of hyssop seeds. Each experimental plot was 3 m long by 2. 28 m wide with the spacing of 15 cm between the plants and 38 cm between the rows. There was a space of one meter between the plots and 2 meters between replications. Hyssop seeds were directly <b>sown</b> <b>by</b> <b>hand.</b> There was no incidence of pest or disease on hyssop during the experiment. Weeding was done manually and the plots were irrigated weekly (as trickle irrigation system). All necessary cultural practices and plant protection measures were followed uniformly for all the plots during the entire period of experiment. In this study, some morphological traits and yield hyssop including plant height, branch no. /plant, fresh weight of plant, dry weight of plant, herb fresh yield, herb dried yield, essential oil content and essential oil yield were evaluated. In order to determine herb fresh yield and herb dry yield, 1 m- 2 plants were used at the harvest time (full blooming). For determine the essential oil content (...|$|R

Thus, in order to study the conservation state of grasslands in more detail, our aim here is to verify if the ant community is a good biological indicator to determine the semi-natural grasslands’ floristic quality of the PNZVG and, at the same time, to study the ant community at functional group levels. The results show that up to 28 species have been identified in the semi-natural grasslands of the PNZVG. The results obtained on ants diversity and the other community variables in regards to the floristic quality of the semi-natural grasslands are not significant, although we could intuit a tendency to have more ant richness and diversity in higher semi-natural grasslands floristic quality. In functional group terms, in the semi-natural grasslands of the PNZVG there are 46 % of disturbance bio indicator species, 43 % of maturity bio indicator species and 11 % of cryptic species, meaning that the disturbance and maturity indicators are even because they are managed by grazing or haymaking and, therefore, they are under the influence of a certain disturbance. The use of the ant community as a bio indicator of the semi-natural grasslands’ floristic quality of the PNZVG should confirm or refute over time when we make use of the methodology in a monitoring program for 1 - 3 year...|$|R
40|$|The {{political}} and territorial reintegration strategy {{that had been}} implemented in Cambodia to establish peace and order in the late 1990 s caused the degraded evergreen forestlands to be allocated to the demobilized Khmer Rouge families in the western regions of the country. The increasing regional demand for cereals and tubers and the highland saturation in central rice areas have driven massive immigration of smallholder farmers. Almost half a million hectares of those forestlands were thus converted in less than 15 years for annual upland cash crops development. This dramatic expansion of agricultural area, without any plan for sustainability, has exerted tremendous pressures on the natural forest resources and on biodiversity. Its effects rapidly spread {{on the water and}} soil resources of Cambodia. With conventional practices and more frequent flooding and incidents of drought, smallholder farmers could hardly sustain their livelihoods, which are mainly based on annual upland farming. Farmers with investment capacity have shifted to planting tree crops and/or to animal production in order to cope with the hazardous phenomena. This case story presents the collaborative R&D program between farmers and researchers in Battambang and Kampong Cham provinces in Cambodia. The program aimed to restore soil fertility and build the resilience of smallholder farmers to the effects of climate change while improving crop productivity and profitability of the smallholder farmers. Using the Diagnosis, Design, Assessment, Training and Extension (DATE) methodology, the project implementers designed, tested, and evaluated crop production systems that are grounded on the principles of conservation agriculture (CA). DATE is a multi-scale, multi-stakeholder participatory approach. It integrates scientific and tacit knowledge, and is composed of four components: agrarian systems diagnosis, field experiment, on-farm assessment, and pre-extension. A number of CA-based cropping systems have been designed and validated in the program: (1) mono-cropping of maize in association with pigeon pea or mungbean as relay crops, (2) biannual rotation cropping of maize with soybean or cassava, and (3) intensified cropping of maize and cassava. Synergizing this with the benefits of CA, each system has the capacity for climate change adaptation and mitigation, to retain soil fertility, and to increase smallholder farmers' profitability. Based on the results, pigeon pea is the most suitable crop for mollisols used with maize since it can improve the water retention capacity of the soil, reduce soil evaporation, and reduce mineral nitrogen inputs. Moreover, its grain can be sold or used as animal feed to augment farmers' income, a characteristic that smallholders look for in an agricultural production system. Likewise, shifting mungbean to be <b>sown</b> <b>by</b> <b>hand</b> broadcast after harvesting early maize significantly reduces farmers' risks and costs, thereby improving their productivity. Shifting to CA-based cassava production (a key annual crop) using chisel to operate strip tillage on planting rows after the early maize harvest also enables farmers to significantly minimize risks and costs. These risks and costs are estimated to be about USD (United States Dollar) 300 – 400 per hectare and USD 200 per hectare, respectively. Designing CA-based cropping systems based on the DATE methodology presents clear benefits. DATE is a holistic approach for identifying technical, socioeconomic, and institutional elements for a sustainable and more inclusive intensification of smallholder farmers' agricultural production systems. However, designing such innovative techniques is a combination of context-specific and context-generic features. These issues need {{to be taken into account}} should such innovation be replicated in other regions. In addition, this action-research program should be a continuous process; the agro-technical performances of the introduced cropping systems should be continuously validated in multiple locations and for several years. The outcomes of the cropping systems should also be continuously monitored such that their impacts on natural resources (e. g., soil organic carbon, nutrient cycles, xenobiotic dynamic, etc.) can be determined and measured accurately.
