40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} {{relationship}} of spinal inflammation and fatty degeneration (FD) as detected by MRI and new bone formation seen on conventional radiographs (CRs) in ankylosing spondylitis (AS). Methods: CRs at baseline, 2 years and 5 years and spinal MRIs at baseline and 2 years of 73 AS patients treated with infliximab in European AS Infliximab Cohort were available. Relative risks (RR) were calculated with a general linear model after adjustment for within-patient variation. Results: In a total of 1466 vertebral edges (VEs) without baseline syndesmophytes, 61 syndesmophytes developed at 5 years, the majority of which (57. 4 %) had no corresponding detectable MRI lesions at baseline. VEs with both inflammation and FD at baseline had the highest risk (RR 3. 3, p= 0. 009) for <b>syndesmophyte</b> formation at 5 years, followed by VEs that developed new FD or did not resolve FD at 2 years (RR= 2. 3, p= 0. 034), while inflammation at baseline with no FD at 2 years had the lowest risk for <b>syndesmophyte</b> formation at 5 years (RR= 0. 8). Of the VEs with inflammation at baseline, > 70 % resolved completely, 28. 8 % turned into FD after 2 years, but only 1 <b>syndesmophyte</b> developed within 5 years. Conclusions: Parallel occurrence of inflammation and FD at baseline and development of FD without prior inflammation after 2 years {{were significantly associated with}} <b>syndesmophyte</b> formation after 5 years of antitumour necrosis factor (TNF) therapy.

Methods Fifteen AS patients free from medical conditions and drugs affecting bone metabolism underwent X-ray, DXA and QCT in 1999 and 2009. Results In spine QCT a statistically significant (p = 0, 001) decrease of trabecular bone mineral content (BMC) was observed (change ± SD: 18. 0 ± 7. 3 mg/cm 3). In contrast, spine DXA revealed a significant increase of bone mineral density (change ± SD: - 0. 15 ± 0. 14 g/cm 2). The mean BMC, both at baseline and follow-up was significantly lower (p = 0. 02 and p = 0. 005, respectively) in advanced radiological group as compared to early radiological group. However, in multiple regression model after adjustment for baseline BMC, the baseline radiological scoring did not influence the progression of bone loss as assessed with QCT (p = 0. 22, p for BMC*X-ray <b>syndesmophyte</b> scoring interaction = 0. 65, p for ANOVA-based X-ray <b>syndesmophyte</b> scoring*time interaction = 0. 39). Baseline BMC was the only significant determinant of 10 -year BMC change, to date the longest QCT follow-up data in AS.

We evaluated whether a citrullinated and MMP degraded fragment of vimentin (VICM) could be a prognostic biomarker in AS. METHODS: Serum VICM was measured in samples of healthy controls (n= 35), controls with RA (n= 47) and AS (n= 201) patients. Optimal cut-off for diagnostic sensitivity and specificity was determined by ROC analysis. Baseline and 2 -year spinal radiographs were available on 118 AS patients, scored using mSASSS. We assessed correlations with patient demographics (age, disease duration), disease activity (BASDAI, CRP), and severity (mSASSS) using Spearman's rho. The independent association of VICM with 2 -year radiographic progression, defined as mSASSS change> 0 or {{the development of a}} new <b>syndesmophyte,</b> was analyzed by multivariate regression. RESULTS: Both RA and AS had significantly higher levels of degraded VICM than controls (p< 0. 001). AS patients with the highest level of VICM had the largest burden of disease (p< 0. 001), i. e. highest mSASSS score and BASDAI. VICM was significantly and independently associated with radiographic progression after 2 years (β = 0. 69, p= 0. 0005). Patients with both high VICM and a high baseline mSASSS had the highest risk for radiographic progression (OR for mSASSS change = 13, new <b>syndesmophyte</b> = 32) and 67 % of these had progression. CONCLUSIONS: Serum VICM may be of prognostic value in AS.

We explored the relationship between spinal new {{bone formation}} and ultrasound (US) -determined Achilles enthesophytes {{to test the hypothesis}} that spinal {{new bone formation}} is part of a generalized enthesis bone-forming phenotype. A multicenter, case control study of 225 consecutive AS patients and 95 age/body mass index (BMI) matched healthy controls (HC) was performed. US scans of Achilles tendons and cervical and lumbar spine radiographs were obtained. All images were centrally scored by one investigator for US and one for radiographs, blinded to medical data. The relation between <b>syndesmophytes</b> (by modified Stoke Ankylosing Spondylitis Spine Score (mSASSS) and the number of <b>syndesmophytes)</b> and enthesophytes (with a semi-quantitative scoring of the US findings) was investigated. AS patients had significantly higher US enthesophyte scores than HCs (2. 1 (1. 6) vs. 1. 6 (1. 6); p = 0. 004). The difference was significant in males (p = 0. 001) but not in females (p = 0. 5).

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{evaluate}} spinal radiographic damage {{over time}} and to explore the associations of radiographic progression with patient characteristics and clinical assessments including disease activity in ankylosing spondylitis (AS) patients treated with tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) blocking therapy in daily clinical practice. METHODS: Consecutive outpatients from the Groningen Leeuwarden AS (GLAS) cohort were included based {{on the availability of}} cervical and lumbar radiographs before start of TNF-α blocking therapy and after 2, 4, and/or 6 years of follow-up. Clinical data were assessed at the same time points. Radiographs were scored by two independent readers using the modified Stoke AS Spine Score (mSASSS). Spinal radiographic progression in relation to clinical assessments was analyzed using generalized estimating equations. RESULTS: 176 AS patients were included, 58 % had <b>syndesmophytes</b> at baseline. Median mSASSS increased significantly from 10. 7 (IQR: 4. 6 - 24. 0) at baseline to 14. 8 (IQR: 7. 9 - 32. 8) at 6 years. At the group level, spinal radiographic progression was linear with a mean progression rate of 1. 3 mSASSS units per 2 years. Both spinal radiographic damage at baseline and radiographic progression were highly variable between AS patients. Male gender, older age, longer disease duration, higher BMI, longer smoking duration, high CRP, and high ASDAS were significantly associated with <b>syndesmophytes</b> at baseline. Significantly more radiographic progression was seen in patients with versus without <b>syndesmophytes</b> (2. 0 vs. 0. 5 mSASSS units per 2 years) and in patients > 40 versus ≤ 40 years of age (1. 8 vs. 0. 7 mSASSS units per 2 years). No longitudinal associations between radiographic progression and clinical assessments were found. CONCLUSIONS: This prospective longitudinal observational cohort study in daily clinical practice shows overall slow and linear spinal radiographic progression in AS patients treated with TNF-α blocking therapy. At the individual level, progression was highly variable.

40|$|Spondyloarthritis (SpA) is {{a family}} of many {{diseases}}, and these diseases share some clinical, genetic, and radiologic features. The disease process in the spine at the beginning is spinal inflammation, in which TNFα is the principal cytokine involved. Therefore, the dramatic clinical and pathologic response of anti-TNFα therapy in SpA {{is based upon the}} presence of increased TNFα in synovial tissues and sacroiliac joints, which perpetuates chronic inflammation. The increased Toll-like receptors (TCR) 2 and 4 in the serum, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, or synovial tissues of ankylosing spondyloarthritis (AS) or SpA patients suggest that SpA is highly associated with innate immunity. Any drug including anti-TNFα blocker which can downregulate the TCR, infiltrated neutrophils, or CD 163 + macrophages in the synovial tissue is the rationale for the management of SpA. Like rheumatoid arthritis, the increased TH 22 and TH 17 cells either in blood, synovial fluid, or synovial tissues were also demonstrated in SpA. Thus, TH 17 and TH 22 may be reasonable cellular targets for therapeutic intervention. Drugs (anti-IL 6 R or anti-IL 6) which can reduce the binding of IL 6 and IL 6 R to the cell surface may be beneficial in SpA. Many proteins are implicated in the new bone formation (<b>syndesmophyte)</b> or ankylosis in AS or SpA. The enhanced BMP and Wnt pathway will activate osteoblasts which promote the new bone formation. However, no drug including anti-TNFα can stop or prevent the <b>syndesmophyte</b> in AS.

30|$|Ankylosing {{spondylitis}} (AS) is {{the main}} subtype {{of a group of}} chronic inflammatory rheumatic diseases, called the spondyloarthritides (SpA), which mainly affect the axial skeleton as well as the peripheral joints and entheses [1 – 3]. The main clinical manifestations, inflammatory back pain and stiffness, are caused by inflammatory changes in the sacroiliac joints (SIJ) and spinal structures (sacroiliitis, spondylitis, spondylodiscitis, spondyloarthritis, and enthesitis). The clinical symptoms are paralleled over time by some osteodestructive and typical osteoproliferative changes of SIJ and spine (erosions, <b>syndesmophytes,</b> and ankylosis) best assessed by conventional radiographs [4]. MRI is able to detect acute inflammation of the SIJ and the spine before structural changes develop and has become a pivotal imaging tool for early diagnosis of axial SpA (recently included as a major criterion in the ASAS classification criteria) [5, 6]. It has also allowed insights into the development of new bone from prior inflammatory lesions. The current paradigm involves resolution of an inflammatory lesion and its replacement by fat tissue followed by cartilage metaplasia and osteoproliferation through endochondral ossification [7, 8]. This is exemplified by the observation that <b>syndesmophytes</b> seem to preferentially develop at fatty degenerated vertebral corners after resolution of inflammation [9, 10]. However, <b>syndesmophytes</b> may also develop at sites without inflammation on baseline and follow up MRI, potentially through noninflammatory pathways [11, 12].|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Osteoporosis {{can be a}} {{complication}} of ankylosing spondylitis (AS), but diagnosing spinal osteoporosis can be difficult since pathologic new bone formation interferes with {{the assessment of the}} bone mineral density (BMD). The aims of the current study were to investigate prevalence and risk factors for reduced BMD in a Swedish cohort of AS patients, and to examine how progressive ankylosis influences BMD with the use of dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) of the lumbar spine in different projections. Methods: Methods of assessment were questionnaires, back mobility tests, blood samples, lateral spine radiographs for <b>syndesmophyte</b> grading (mSASSS), DXA of the hip, radius and lumbar spine in anteroposterior (AP) and lateral projections with estimation of volumetric BMD (vBMD). Results: AS patients (modified New York criteria), 87 women and 117 men, mean age 50 +/- 13 years and disease duration 15 +/- 11 years were included. According to World Health Organization (WHO) criteria 21 % osteoporosis and 44 % osteopenia was diagnosed in patients > = 50 years. Under age 50 BMD below expected range for age was found in 5 %. Interestingly lateral lumbar DXA showed significantly lower BMD and revealed significantly more cases with osteoporosis as compared with AP DXA. Lumbar vBMD was not different between sexes, but women had significantly more lumbar osteoporosis measured with AP DXA (P < 0. 001). Men had significantly higher mSASSS (P < 0. 001). Low BMD was associated with high age, disease duration, mSASSS, Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Metrology Index (BASMI), inflammatory parameters and low body mass index (BMI). Increasing mSASSS correlated significantly with decreasing lateral and volumetric lumbar BMD, while AP lumbar BMD showed tendency to increase. Conclusions: Osteoporosis and osteopenia is common in AS and associated with high disease burden. Lateral and volumetric lumbar DXA are more sensitive than AP DXA in detecting osteoporosis and are less affected by <b>syndesmophyte</b> formation...|$|E

Methods: Patients from the Groningen Leeuwarden AS (GLAS) cohort starting TNF-alpha inhibitors with baseline and 4 -year radiographs were included. Cervical facet joints and vertebral bodies were scored by two independent readers according to the method of de Vlam and mSASSS, respectively. Results: At baseline, 25 of 99 (25 %) AS patients had partial or complete ankylosis of the cervical facet joints, whereas 51 (52 %) patients had non-bridging or bridging <b>syndesmophytes</b> of cervical vertebral bodies. During 4 years, 13 (13 %) patients developed new (partial) ankylosis of the facet joints, whereas 26 (26 %) developed new (bridging) <b>syndesmophytes.</b> Facet joint damage and progression without involvement of the vertebral bodies were seen in 5 (5 %) and 8 (8 %) patients, respectively. Damage of facet joints was associated with longer disease duration, history of IBD/uveitis/psoriasis, higher disease activity, larger occiput-to-wall distance, higher mSASSS, and presence of <b>syndesmophytes.</b> Progression of the facet joints was associated with larger occiput-to-wall distance and more facet joint damage at baseline. Conclusions: Cervical facet joints were frequently involved in AS.

40|$|Objective: To analyze whether erosions, sclerosis, and {{squaring}} {{assessed on}} radiographs precede {{the development of}} syndesmophytes in patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS). Methods: Patients with AS from the Outcome in Ankylosing Spondylitis International Study (OASIS) cohort were followed up for 12 years, with radiographs obtained every 2 years. Two readers (reader 1 and reader 2) scored radiographs according to the modified Stoke Ankylosing Spondylitis Spine Score (mSASSS) and recorded abnormalities per vertebral corner. Progression from erosions, sclerosis, or squaring to (bridging) syndesmophytes was investigated using multilevel longitudinal (autoregressive and time-lagged) regression analysis. Interactions with reader and spinal region were investigated. Results: The analysis included 211 patients (71 % male, 85 % HLA-B 27 positive) with a mean SD age of 43 +/- 13 years and a symptom duration of 21 +/- 12 years. A total of 921 radiographs were included, with 20, 509 (reader 1) and 20, 568 (reader 2) vertebral corners evaluable. Erosions were found in 1 % and 2. 5 %, sclerosis in 0. 3 % and 1. 7 %, squaring in 6. 5 % and 5. 1 %, and syndesmophytes in 25 % and 27 %, by reader 1 and reader 2, respectively. The odds ratio for a new <b>syndesmophyte</b> to occur within 2 years at the same vertebral corner if erosions, sclerosis, or squaring were present was 2. 0 (95 % confidence interval [95 % CI] 1. 7 - 2. 3) for the cervical and lumbar spine together, 3. 1 (95 % CI 2. 5 - 3. 9) for the cervical spine, and 1. 3 (95 % CI 1. 0 - 1. 6) for the lumbar spine. When vertebral corners with erosions, sclerosis, and squaring were analyzed separately, this effect was statistically significant for erosions and for sclerosis, but not for squaring. Conclusion: Erosions and sclerosis occur infrequently in patients with AS, but when they do occur, they precede {{the development of a}} new <b>syndesmophyte,</b> and are therefore important to assess...|$|E

The current goals for treatment of this disease involve efforts to improve quality of life through pain control and allevi-ation of inflammation, prevent progressive structural damage, and preserve motor function [2]. Therapeutic modalities include non-pharmacological treatment such rheumatic drugs, and anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy. Surgical treatment may be considered for se-verely disabling deformities. One of the hallmarks of ankylosing spondylitis is the formation of vertebral syn-desmophytes, which may lead to diminished physical function and restricted spinal motion [3].

30|$|The {{results of}} the present {{descriptive}} pilot study suggest that the radiotracer uptake detected by F PET/CT in the spine and SIJ of patients with AS is only marginally associated with the concomitant MRI evidence of inflammation. The relationship between active inflammatory MRI lesions at vertebral corners and the development of <b>syndesmophytes</b> as assessed on conventional radiographs has been analyzed in several recent studies [8 – 12, 18, 19]. Although clear longitudinal data are still lacking, these studies point to a process that comprises resolution of inflammation, activation of repair mechanisms involving fatty transformation of the lesion followed by new bone formation. However, new <b>syndesmophytes</b> may develop at sites without inflammation or fat infiltration on baseline MRI [11, 12]. These findings suggest the presence of non-inflammatory pathways, although the presence of underlying inflammation not detectable by MRI cannot be formally excluded. F PET/CT might be able to detect the anabolic repair process leading to new bone formation regardless of the definite pathophysiological pathway. It was therefore anticipated that 18 [*]F-fluoride uptake might also occur in active mineral deposition associated with degenerative spine disease (as exemplified in Figure 2), especially as patients with established, longstanding AS were included in this study. Longitudinal studies in patients with early axial SpA with only minimal degenerative disease are warranted.|$|R
40|$|Spondyloarthritis (SpA) is a form {{of chronic}} {{inflammatory}} arthritis affecting axial and peripheral joints, {{which may be}} initiated by inflammation of joint subchondral bone marrow or enthesitis. Invasive fibrous tissue which substitutes bone marrow, entheseal innate-like T lymphocytes and proinflammatory cytokines: tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukins 23, 17 and 22, all contribute to these local pathological processes. Joint inflammation, joint cartilage and bone destruction are mediated by mechanisms that are molecularly similar to rheumatoid arthritis. These pathologic processes are halted by effective anti-inflammatory therapy, including anti-TNF biological agents. By contrast, anti-TNF therapy fails to inhibit pathologic new bone formation, which is a unique hallmark of SpA and results, among others things, in <b>syndesmophyte</b> formation followed by spine ankylosis. The molecular mechanisms driving pathologic bone remodeling in SpA patients and interaction of this process with inflammatory pathways are not fully understood. Three hypotheses, discussed in the article, have been proposed to explain this issue...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Introduction Osteoporosis {{can be a}} {{complication}} of ankylosing spondylitis (AS), but diagnosing spinal osteoporosis can be difficult since pathologic new bone formation interferes with {{the assessment of the}} bone mineral density (BMD). The aims of the current study were to investigate prevalence and risk factors for reduced BMD in a Swedish cohort of AS patients, and to examine how progressive ankylosis influences BMD with the use of dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) of the lumbar spine in different projections. Methods Methods of assessment were questionnaires, back mobility tests, blood samples, lateral spine radiographs for <b>syndesmophyte</b> grading (mSASSS), DXA of the hip, radius and lumbar spine in anteroposterior (AP) and lateral projections with estimation of volumetric BMD (vBMD). Results AS patients (modified New York criteria), 87 women and 117 men, mean age 50 ± 13 years and disease duration 15 ± 11 years were included. According to World Health Organization (WHO) criteria 21 % osteoporosis and 44 % osteopenia was diagnosed in patients > = 50 years. Under age 50 BMD below expected range for age was found in 5 %. Interestingly lateral lumbar DXA showed significantly lower BMD and revealed significantly more cases with osteoporosis as compared with AP DXA. Lumbar vBMD was not different between sexes, but women had significantly more lumbar osteoporosis measured with AP DXA (P < 0. 001). Men had significantly higher mSASSS (P < 0. 001). Low BMD was associated with high age, disease duration, mSASSS, Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Metrology Index (BASMI), inflammatory parameters and low body mass index (BMI). Increasing mSASSS correlated significantly with decreasing lateral and volumetric lumbar BMD, while AP lumbar BMD showed tendency to increase. Conclusions Osteoporosis and osteopenia is common in AS and associated with high disease burden. Lateral and volumetric lumbar DXA are more sensitive than AP DXA in detecting osteoporosis and are less affected by <b>syndesmophyte</b> formation. © 2012 Klingberg et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

40|$|The paper {{summarizes}} {{the data of}} a randomized placebo-controlled phase 3 GO-RAISE trial of spondylitis (AS) patients receiving two different doses (50 and 100 mg) of golimumab (GLM), which evaluates its efficiency and safety and X-ray progression {{of changes in the}} axial skeleton. In AS patients, GLM therapy leads to a rapid long-lasting clinical and radiological response. The tolerability of long-term therapy with GLM generally complies with the safety profile of the entire class of tumor necrosis factor-р (TNF-р) inhibitors. The data of the GO-RAISE trial has substantiated once again the established fact that the high baseline level of C-reactive protein (CRP) and the presence of <b>syndesmophytes</b> are predictors for a rapider X-ray progression. At the same time, the results of the trial may question the recent assumptions that TNF-р suppression can exert a stimulating effect on the formation of new bone tissue with time. Further studies are to determine whether there is an association between the presence of <b>syndesmophytes</b> and elevated CRP levels and whether they have a combined effect on X-ray progression, and if so, whether the development of structural changes may be prevented with TNF-р inhibitors to be used at the earlier stages of the disease. </em...|$|R
30|$|Radiography {{is still}} {{valuable}} {{in the diagnosis}} of spinal inflammatory disorders. It is necessary for visualising instability and is superior to MRI for detecting <b>syndesmophytes.</b> However, MRI and CT can detect signs of spinal involvement {{before they can be}} visualised by radiography. MRI adds information about potential involvement of the spinal cord and nervous roots in addition to signs of disease activity and chronic changes such as fibrous pannus in RA and fatty marrow deposition, erosion and vertebral fusion in SpA. MRI is therefore widely used to monitor inflammatory spinal diseases, especially during anti-TNF therapy.|$|R
