Homer says he likes Chicago deep dish pizza, so Mr. Burns takes him to Chicago on his private plane. On the plane, Homer is treated with luxury and gets serenaded by Lionel Richie. Homer has the time of his life in Chicago, but he becomes depressed on the return trip because he does not have the plane. Back in Springfield, Homer tells Marge that he is tired of being a normal person and becomes depressed. Marge, pitying for Homer, decides to help and hires him a life coach named Colby Kraus (Stephen Colbert), who will help with Homer's dream. Colby starts right away in his treatment with Homer by videotaping his every move. At the bowling alley and after watching Homer's daily habits for a few days, Colby realizes that bowling is the one thing Homer is good at and enjoys doing. He instructs Homer to wear his bowling shoes everywhere he goes to help instill confidence in everything he does. The bowling shoes work, Homer becomes a new man, and as a result he receives numerous new job offers. Homer decides to only go for an interview at Handyman's Choice Copper Tubing because he would be required to fly in the company jet as part of his new job, however, the Rich Texan does not hire him.|$|E

40|$|Background: Fresh {{fruit and}} {{vegetables}} are important components of a healthy diet. Distance to a supermarket {{has been associated with}} the ability to access fresh produce. Methods: A randomly sampled telephone survey was conducted with the main shopper for 3000 households in New Orleans, Louisiana in 2011. Individuals were asked where and how often they shopped for groceries, frequency of consumption of a variety of foods, and whether they had access to a car. Bivariate models assessed the relationship between four outcomes: car access, distance to the store patronized by the respondent, number of monthly <b>shopping</b> <b>trips,</b> and daily servings of produce. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to distinguish direct and indirect effects. Results: In bivariate models, car access was positively associated with number of <b>shopping</b> <b>trips</b> and produce consumption while distance was inversely associated with <b>shopping</b> <b>trips.</b> In SEM models, produce consumption was not associated with car access or distance, but to the number of monthly <b>shopping</b> <b>trips.</b> Conclusion: The frequency of shopping is associated with car access but a further distance deters it. Access to stores closer to the shopper may promote more frequent shopping and consumption of produce...|$|R
