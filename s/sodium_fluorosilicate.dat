5|$|As {{with other}} iron alloys, around 3kg (6.5lb) metspar {{is added to}} each metric ton of steel; the {{fluoride}} ions lower its melting point and viscosity. Alongside its role as an additive in materials like enamels and welding rod coats, most acidspar is reacted with sulfuric acid to form hydrofluoric acid, which is used in steel pickling, glass etching and alkane cracking. One-third of HF goes into synthesizing cryolite and aluminium trifluoride, both fluxes in the Hall–Héroult process for aluminium extraction; replenishment is necessitated by their occasional reactions with the smelting apparatus. Each metric ton of aluminium requires about 23kg (51lb) of flux. Fluorosilicates consume the second largest portion, with <b>sodium</b> <b>fluorosilicate</b> used in water fluoridation and laundry effluent treatment, and as an intermediate en route to cryolite and silicon tetrafluoride. Other important inorganic fluorides include those of cobalt, nickel, and ammonium.|$|E

40|$|Sandstone {{acidizing}} {{has been}} carried out with mud acid which combines hydrochloric acid and hydrofluoric acid at various ratios. The application of mud acid in sandstone formations has presented quite a large number of difficulties like corrosion, precipitation of reaction products, matrix deconsolidation, decomposition of clays by HCl, and fast spending of the acids. There has been a recent trend to use chelating agents for stimulation in place of mud acid which are used in oil industry widely for iron control operations. In this study, two chelates, L-glutamic-N, N-diacetic acid (GLDA) and hydroxyethylethylene-diaminetriacetic acid (HEDTA) have been studied as an alternative to mud acid for acidizing. In order to analyze their performance in the application of acidizing, coreflood tests were performed on Berea and Bandera sandstone cores. Another disadvantage of mud acid has been the fast spending at clay mineral surfaces leading to depletion of acid strength, migration of fines, and formation of colloidal silica gel residue. Hence, compatibility of chelates with clay minerals was investigated through the static solubility tests. GLDA and HEDTA were analyzed for their permeability enhancement properties in Berea and Bandera cores. In the coreflood experiments conducted, it was found out that chelating agents can successfully stimulate sandstone formations. The final permeability of the Berea and Bandera cores were enhanced significantly. GLDA performed better than HEDTA in all applications. The substitution of seawater in place of deionized water for mixing purposes also led to an increased conductivity of the core implying GLDA is compatible with seawater. In the static solubility tests, chelates were mixed with HF acid at various concentrations. GLDA fluids kept more amounts of minerals in the solution when compared with HEDTA fluids. Sodium-based chelates when mixed with HF acid showed inhibited performance due to the formation of <b>sodium</b> <b>fluorosilicates</b> precipitates which are insoluble damage creating compounds. The application of ammonium-based chelate with HF acid was able to bring a large amount of aluminosilciates into the solution. The study recommends the use of ammonium-based GLDA in acidizing operations involving HF acid and sodium-based GLDA {{in the absence of the}} acid...|$|R

50|$|Fluoridation {{does not}} affect the appearance, taste, or smell of {{drinking}} water. It is normally accomplished by adding one of three compounds to the water: sodium fluoride, fluorosilicic acid, or <b>sodium</b> <b>fluorosilicate.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Sodium</b> <b>fluorosilicate</b> (Na2SiF6) is {{the sodium}} salt of fluorosilicic acid. It is a powder or very fine crystal that is easier to ship than fluorosilicic acid. It {{is also known as}} sodium silicofluoride.|$|E
50|$|These {{compounds}} {{were chosen}} for their solubility, safety, availability, and low cost. A 1992 census found that, for U.S. public water supply systems reporting the type of compound used, 63% of the population received water fluoridated with fluorosilicic acid, 28% with <b>sodium</b> <b>fluorosilicate,</b> and 9% with sodium fluoride.|$|E
50|$|The process {{utilizes}} {{a closed}} mold with pre-vacuum, followed by freezing to maintain uniform bubble geometry. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is flooded through the frozen, open foam matrix to form carbonic acid (CO2+H2O&rarr; H2CO3). Much like {{the addition of}} <b>sodium</b> <b>fluorosilicate</b> (Na2SiF6) in the Dunlop process, the carbonic acid lowers the pH, thereby causing gellation. In the next process step, vulcanization locks the foam into a uniform bubble distribution.|$|E
50|$|Most {{beryllium}} {{is extracted}} from beryllium hydroxide. One production method is sintering, done by mixing beryl, <b>sodium</b> <b>fluorosilicate,</b> and soda at high temperatures to form sodium fluoroberyllate, aluminium oxide, and silicon dioxide. A solution of sodium fluoroberyllate and sodium hydroxide in water is {{then used to}} form beryllium hydroxide by precipitation. Alternatively, in the melt method, powdered beryl is heated to high temperature, cooled with water, then heated again slightly in sulfuric acid, eventually yielding beryllium hydroxide. The beryllium hydroxide from either method then produces beryllium fluoride and beryllium chloride through a somewhat long process. Electrolysis or heating of these compounds can then produce beryllium.|$|E
5000|$|Soluble {{fluoride}} salts, {{of which}} sodium fluoride {{is the most}} common, are toxic, and have resulted in both accidental and self-inflicted deaths from acute poisoning. The lethal dose for most adult humans is estimated at 5 to 10 g (which is equivalent to 32 to 64 mg/kg elemental fluoride/kg body weight). A case of a fatal poisoning of an adult with 4 grams of sodium fluoride is documented, and a dose of 120 g sodium fluoride has been survived. [...] For <b>sodium</b> <b>fluorosilicate</b> (Na2SiF6), the median lethal dose (LD50) orally in rats is 0.125 g/kg, corresponding to 12.5 g for a 100 kg adult.|$|E
50|$|Beryllium is most {{commonly}} {{extracted from the}} mineral beryl, which is either sintered using an extraction agent or melted into a soluble mixture.

Beryllium hydroxide is precipitated from a solution of sodium fluoroberyllate and sodium hydroxide in water. Extraction of beryllium using the melt method involves grinding beryl into a powder and heating it to 1650 C. The melt is quickly cooled with water and then reheated 250 to 300 C in concentrated sulfuric acid, mostly yielding beryllium sulfate and aluminium sulfate. Aqueous ammonia is then used to remove the aluminium and sulfur, leaving beryllium hydroxide.|$|E

The chemical plants were located between Police and the village named Jasienica. The construction of the chemical compound was performed in 1964-1970, on 22 July 1969 the first production department was launched - the production plant of sulphuric acid. In 1970 three production plants were commissioned: of sulphuric acid, phosphoric acid and fertiliser. The plants in Police {{as one of the}} first in the country produced compound fertilisers (NP). In the next years, the plant producing <b>sodium</b> <b>fluorosilicate</b> and 2nd plant producing phosphoric acid were opened. In the mid-70’s, it was possible to produce a three-component fertiliser NPK. In 1977 Zakład Bieli Tytanowej was commissioned.|$|E

Some experiments were done at different conditions of the amount of 732 resin, reaction temperature and time. At the same time, the regeneration method of 732 resins and the effect of removing sodium ions of the regenerative resins were investigated either. The optimum conditions were obtained. The result indicated that ion exchange method was feasible. And the resins could be regenerated and reused for many times.

40|$|High {{efficiency}} and low cost thermal insulation energy saving panel materials containing sepiolite nanofibers {{were developed by}} means of the synergistic action of inorganic adhesive, curing agent, and hydrogen peroxide. The water soluble sodium silicate was used as inorganic adhesive, and the <b>sodium</b> <b>fluorosilicate</b> was chosen as curing agent. Moreover, appropriate amount of hydrogen peroxide was added in order to decrease the bulk density and improve the heat insulation performance of panel materials. The results showed that the synergistic action of inorganic adhesive, curing agent, and hydrogen peroxide could make thermal insulation energy saving panel materials have low bulk density and high mechanical performance, and the optimal process was as follows: 120 °C of drying temperature, 1. 6 % of sodium silicate as inorganic adhesive, 12 % of <b>sodium</b> <b>fluorosilicate</b> as curing agent in sodium silicate, and 2. 5 % of hydrogen peroxide.

40|$|A novel {{chemical}} {{scheme for}} the flotation of rutile from eclogite tailings {{has been developed}} in this work. It consists of lead ion as the activator, <b>sodium</b> <b>fluorosilicate</b> (SF) as the depressant, and styryl phosphonic acid (SPA) and n-octyl alcohol (OCT) as the collector. By using the proposed scheme to treat a feed ore of 4. 5 % TiO 2, a rougher concentrate of grade 84. 47 % TiO 2 was achieved with the recovery of 61. 5 %. Also, the scheme made a high flotation rate for rutile. The scheme was applied to closed-circuit flotation (one-stage rougher flotation, two-stage scavenger flotation and two-stage cleaner flotation), produced a concentrate of 92 % TiO 2 with the recovery of 70 %. It is shown that the new chemical scheme would be a potential one for the effective separation of rutile from eclogite ores. Keywords: Rutile, Flotation, Reagents, Eclogite tailing...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was carried out}} into light scattering by Gaussian rough ice crystals. Gaussian rough crystal geometries were generated using roughness parameters derived from mineral dust grains, which {{have been reported to}} be suitable proxies for rough ice crystals. Light scattering data for these geometries was computed using the discrete dipole approximation (DDA) method. Phase functions, 2 D scattering patterns, degree of linear polarisation patterns and asymmetry parameters were computed for smooth, moderately rough and highly rough crystals with a variety of orientations and size parameters. A <b>sodium</b> <b>fluorosilicate</b> ice analogue crystal with three partially roughened prism facets was created using focused ion beam (FIB) milling and 2 D scattering patterns were collected from it using the small ice detector (SID) 3 cloud probe. It was found that roughness reduces features in the phase function compared to scattering by smooth hexagonal prisms, particularly when the roughness features were horizontally much larger than the wavelength. However, the most effective roughness model also takes account of horizontal features whose size is closer to that of the wavelength. Horizontal features smaller than the wavelength have very little effect...|$|E
40|$|Waldron has {{proposed}} to extract lunar silicon by sodium reduction of <b>sodium</b> <b>fluorosilicate</b> derived from reacting sodium fluoride with lunar silicon tetrafluoride. Silicon tetrafluoride is {{obtained by the}} action of hydrofluoric acid on lunar silicates. While these reactions are well understood, the resulting lunar silicon is not likely to meet electronic specifications of 5 nines purity. Dale and Margrave have shown that silicon difluoride can be obtained {{by the action of}} silicon tetrafluoride on elemental silicon at elevated temperatures (1100 - 1200 C) and low pressures (1 - 2 torr). The resulting silicon difluoride will then spontaneously disproportionate into hyperpure silicon and silicon tetrafluoride in vacuum at approximately 400 C. On its own merits, silicon difluoride polymerizes into a tough waxy solid in the temperature range from liquid nitrogen to about 100 C. It is the silicon analog of teflon. Silicon difluoride ignites in moist air but is stable under lunar surface conditions and may prove to be a valuable industrial material that is largely lunar derived for lunar surface applications. The most effective driver for lunar industrialization may be the prospects for industrial space solar power systems in orbit or on the moon that are built with lunar materials. Such systems would require large quantities of electronic grade silicon or compound semiconductors for photovoltaics and electronic controls. Since silicon is the most abundant semimetal in the silicate portion of any solar system rock (approximately 20 wt percent), lunar silicon production is bound to be an important process in such a solar power project. The lunar silicon extraction process is discussed...|$|E
