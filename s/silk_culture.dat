Different chick embryo organ behaviours were analysed in terms of circularity, cell growth and cell adhesion after being cultivated in contact with these two materials. The circularity (cell layer shape corresponding to the trend of the biomaterials to induce a specific directionality) depends on the organ used when in contact with silk fibroin. This biomaterial induced higher cell adhesion (kidney) or lower cell adhesion (spine) compared to Thermanox.

Electrophoretic analysis and immunoprecipitation of the proteins of host cells infected with the recombinant viruses revealed the presence of the corresponding chorion proteins. We conclude that baculovirus vectors can be used for expressing efficiently not only cDNAs or simple genes devoid of intervening sequences but also intron-containing chromosomal genes. Thus, recombinant baculoviruses offer a powerful alternative to hybrid-selected translation, particularly when the identification of proteins encoded by members of complex multigene families is required...|$|R

Making these lavish items took time, skills and materials, and the decorations usually contained symbols and messages. As main source there are silk wallets from the collections of the National Museum of Finland and Satakunta Museum, as well as the diary of Jacobina Munsterhjelm from 1799 to 1801. By interpreting these items we can build a picture of gentry women’s lives. The <b>culture</b> of <b>silk</b> wallets is European, the silk wallet phenomenon studied is Swedish-Finnish, and the research is limited mainly in Finland by its sources. This research has been carried out by constructing a cultural context to the silk wallets with the help of Ginzburg’s methods from his work Juusto ja madot - 1500 -luvun myllärin maailmankuva. Silk wallets represent the gentry as well as the communication culture in the 18 th and 19 th centuries, but have remained unstudied.

40|$|Among many agro-based cottage {{industries}} in India, sericulture provides income and employment generating opportunities to rural poor and tribals. Among Vanya or non mulberry <b>silks,</b> tasar <b>culture</b> is practiced by about 1. 5 lakh tribal populace in the States of Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Orissa, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Bihar, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh. Tasar culture involves continuous chain of several production activities. It starts with either collection of nature grown cocoons from forests or rearing of silkworm on its host plants in forests or raised by rearers for production of cocoons, which are utilized by reelers and weavers for production of yarn and fabrics. In the past, tasar culture was practiced as subsidiary occupation involving {{two to three}} months of family labour. Tasar silk is produced by tasar silkworms (Antheraea mylitta and Antheraea proylei) that feed mainly on the leaves of Asan (Terminalia tomentosa) and Arjun (Terminalia arjuna). India is the second largest producer of tasar silk and the exclusive producer of Indian tasar (also known as tropical tasar), which is largely tended by tribals in different parts of country. Oak tasar (also known as temperate tasar) is mainly used for furnishing, dress materials and sarees. Bomkai, Paithani, Ikkat (tie&dye) and Katki are some popular fabrics produced using tasar silks. Bafta is a popular blend of tasar and cotton. Shawls and mufflers are also produced using a blend of oak tasar and other natural fibres like wool, cotton, etc. Tasar silk is ideal for making jackets for men and women or traditional costumes like the 'salwar-kurta'. Utilization of tasar food plants in the forest area would add up not only to tasar silk production but also help conserve the forest. Thus Non mulberry sericulture holds a great promise for the forestry as a supplementary activity. On one hand, it can help in arresting forest destruction and on the other, it permits gainful utilization of this vast natural wealth. Tasar culture is a forest based industry uniquely suited to the economy and social structure of the developing countries because of its minimum investment requirement and high employment potential for tribal and rural people. So, In the present review an attempt was made to present the various aspects involved in tasar culture for forest development and the government schemes for the sustainable development of tribal people through tasar rearin...|$|R

5|$|Some of {{the most}} {{pronounced}} effects of Hellenization {{can be seen in}} Afghanistan and India, in the region of the relatively late-rising Greco-Bactrian Kingdom (250–125 BC) (in modern Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Tajikistan) and the Indo-Greek Kingdom (180 BC – 10 CE) in modern Afghanistan and India. There on the newly formed <b>Silk</b> Road Greek <b>culture</b> apparently hybridized with Indian, and especially Buddhist culture. The resulting syncretism known as Greco-Buddhism heavily influenced the development of Buddhism and created a culture of Greco-Buddhist art. These Greco-Buddhist kingdoms sent some of the first Buddhist missionaries to China, Sri Lanka, and the Mediterranean (Greco-Buddhist monasticism). Some of the first and most influential figurative portrayals of the Buddha appeared at this time, perhaps modeled on Greek statues of Apollo in the Greco-Buddhist style. Several Buddhist traditions may have been influenced by the ancient Greek religion: the concept of Boddhisatvas is reminiscent of Greek divine heroes, and some Mahayana ceremonial practices (burning incense, gifts of flowers, and food placed on altars) are similar to those practiced by the ancient Greeks; however, similar practices were also observed amongst the native Indic culture. One Greek king, Menander I, probably became Buddhist, and was immortalized in Buddhist literature as 'Milinda'. The process of Hellenization also spurred trade between the east and west. For example, Greek astronomical instruments dating to the 3rd century BC were found in the Greco-Bactrian city of Ai Khanoum in modern-day Afghanistan, while the Greek concept of a spherical earth surrounded by the spheres of planets eventually supplanted the long-standing Indian cosmological belief of a disc consisting of four continents grouped around a central mountain (Mount Meru) like the petals of a flower. The Yavanajataka (lit. Greek astronomical treatise) and Paulisa Siddhanta texts depict the influence of Greek astronomical ideas on Indian astronomy.|$|R

40|$|MasterSilk {{has been}} used as a novel texture for centuries. Nowadays, the usage of silk reaches to the {{material}} industry and medical area. Even though the silk protein has great potentials due to its extraordinary strength and toughness, it has been hard to develop successful techniques for mass production of silks. Until now, most silk studies have been focused on the spider and silkworm. However, by investigating new silk-bearing organisms, silks with new properties can be found and this attempt can be a solution for practical production of silk protein. In the present work, we tried to express recombinant mussel silk protein in Escherichia coli. Firstly, we compared the silk genes from spider, silkworm, and mussel. Notably, we observed that the mussel silk gene consists of many repeats with abundance of glycine and alanine. In the same way, elastic proteins which sequence are similar to silk have plenty of polymer repeats with non-repeated region. Accordingly, we designed mussel silk gene which contains alternating repeated (hydrophobic) and non-repeated regions. After chemical synthesis of mussel silk gene, we constructed the recombinant vector based on the pET 23 vector containing strong T 7 promoter. However the expression level was too low, thus we tried other vectors, pCOLD DNA and pQE 30. These alterations were for use of co-expression of cold shock protein and weaker promoter (T 5 promoter). In addition, other strategies such as the expressions of partial mussel <b>silk</b> protein, diverse <b>culture</b> conditions, different protein detection methods, and several reagent treatments were also tried. Nevertheless, the tryouts could not bring considerable changes on the expression level of the mussel silk protein. Next, we tried to make fusion silk protein with GST or baculoviral polyhedrin protein. Interestingly, in the case of cold shock protein and GST fusion protein systems, the retardation of cell growth was prominent. This phenomenon might be considered that a soluble-form target protein has significant burden on E. coli. Since baculoviral polyhedrin has been known to induce expression of target protein as an insoluble form, we could express the mussel silk proteins as insoluble form with high cell growth...|$|R

The purposes of this research were to examine: (1) the body knowledge concerning silk clothes of the Mon-Khmer ethnic group in Lower-Isan region, (2) the process of production or silk-cloth weaving of the Mon-Khmer ethnic group in Lower-Isan region and (3) development of silk-cloth weaving of the Mon-Khmer ethnic group in Lower-Isan region. Approach: The research data was gathered from documents concerned and research fields. A sample was 156 people living at 7 villages and those involving silk-cloth production or weaving. The data was analyzed according to the research purposes and presented {{by means of a}} descriptive analysis. Results: Silk-cloth weaving has been a cultural heritage transferred from ancestors. In 1215 Chow Tang Kwan stated that the Siamese people came there, grew mulberries, raised silkworms and wove silk clothes from that time through learning from generation to generation. The cloth-identity and patterns have been party influenced by their ethnic group together with the way of life in each period. In the past, the main purpose of silk-cloth weaving was for household use. Some of the silk clothes were kept for being supplement to various rituals and Buddhist ceremonies. Thus, it was not necessary for them to have commercial production. Household-labor was still an important-productive factor of sufficient economy and reliant society. For the production process, it has been found that at present the economic and social structures have changed from household-use production to commercial production. There are complete production processes in the type of forming groups and the management system by increasing production competency to obtain both quantity and quality as well as standard prices. There are transmutations into a variety of other products and promotion of domestic and foreign marketing. However, what is firmly retained to the community is the traditional silk-cloth weaving. For silk-cloth weaving development, it shows that the appropriate model of silk-cloth weaving development of the Mon-Khmer ethnic group in Lower-Isan region consists of economic and social changes which can affect silk-cloth weaving culture of the Mon-Khmer ethnic group in Lower-Isan region. Conclusion/Recommendations: Silk-cloth weaving is a very important cultural heritage of Mon-Khmer ethnic group. It accumulated and adhered from ancestors and transacting through social recognition in each period. All of production processes of each period are scrupulous such as growing mulberries, raising silkworms, producing fibers and dyeing fibers. The development of identity, patterns, weaving technique, production equipment, transmutation equipment and marketing cause a sequence of changes and development of the process of silk-cloth production or weaving from weaving for household use to commercial production.

The machines were tested in local field and suit better. Sericulture or <b>silk</b> <b>culture</b> is a labour intensive rural industry. At present it faces a shortage of labour force. Harvesting and pruning of mulberry plants are the most critical activities involved in sericulture. In the survey, 80 % sericulturists felt that the harvesting and pruning are most tedious and stressful activities. The main reasons are high work stress, less rest and health problems associated with it. Hence, labourers show less interest towards sericulture.
