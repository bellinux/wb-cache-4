5000|$|Normal Crossover: In {{a normal}} {{crossover}} the player quickly changes direction while <b>switching</b> the <b>ball</b> {{to the opposite}} hand. This move relies primarily on speed.

50|$|A Crossover dribble is a {{basketball}} maneuver {{in which a}} player dribbling the <b>ball</b> <b>switches</b> the <b>ball</b> rapidly from one hand to the other, {{to make a change}} in direction. In a typical example the player heads upcourt, dribbling the ball in (say) the left hand, then makes a wide step left with a good head fake. If the defender is deceived, the player can then switch to dribbling with the right hand and surpass the defender. The crossover can allow the player an open short jumper or a clear path to the basket.|$|R
50|$|After one set {{of balls}} has been chosen for a game, each of the balls is weighed {{to see if they}} have the same or almost the same weight using a digital scale.

40|$|This paper {{researches}} {{the potential}} of a novel <b>ball</b> <b>switch</b> as a wearable vibration sensor for activity recognition. The <b>ball</b> <b>switch</b> is available as a commercial, off-the-shelf sensor and is unique among such sensors due to its miniaturized design and the low mass of the ball. We present {{a detailed analysis of}} the physical properties of the sensor as well as a recommendation for circuit design, sampling method and a feature generation algorithm for activity recognition. The analysis reveals that it is sensitive to vibrations between 1. 5 kHz and 8 kHz, where the acceleration sensor is responsive below 1. 6 kHz. Furthermore, the <b>ball</b> <b>switch</b> is substantially cheaper (3 x), smaller (2 x) and uses less power (50 x) than an accelerometer based system, but delivers less information.

5|$|The Bulls {{advanced}} to the NBA Finals {{for the first time}} in franchise history to face the Los Angeles Lakers, who had Magic Johnson and James Worthy, two formidable opponents. The Bulls won the series four games to one, and compiled an outstanding 15–2 playoff record along the way. Perhaps the best known moment of the series came in Game 2 when, attempting a dunk, Jordan avoided a potential Sam Perkins block by <b>switching</b> the <b>ball</b> from his right hand to his left in mid-air to lay the shot into the basket. In his first Finals appearance, Jordan posted per game averages of 31.2 points on 56% shooting from the field, 11.4 assists, 6.6 rebounds, 2.8 steals, and 1.4 blocks. Jordan won his first NBA Finals MVP award, and he cried while holding the NBA Finals trophy.|$|R

50|$|In the semi final, Wigan survived {{an early}} onslaught by St Helens who couldn't convert early opportunities. Both sides had kicks at {{goal in the}} opening 20 minutes with Jamie Foster {{converting}} his to make the score 2-0 to Saints after 30 minutes. On 33 minutes a break from Josh Charnley down Wigan's right flank was stopped by Saints' Paul Wellens only for the Warriors to <b>switch</b> the <b>ball</b> {{to the other side}} on the next tackle for George Carmont to touch down. The game was still in the balance as both teams went in at 6-2 at the break. WIgan showed why they are the Champions after the break with two tries in the space of five minutes around the hour mark. The tie looked beyond doubt, however Saints fought back with two tries from Jamie Foster to make for a nervy finish. However, Wigan held out to book their place at Wembley {{at the end of the}} month.|$|R
50|$|McAshan {{was noted}} for feats of great athleticism and composure. In 1972, Georgia Tech played Tennessee in Atlanta. McAshan had {{suffered}} a poor outing with 5 interceptions but one moment stood out in the game for Tech fans. Tech had finally put a drive together and {{made it to the}} UT 20 yard line. McAshan took the snap from center and dropped back to pass. As he was preparing to throw, a Tennessee defender pressed his throwing arm into his chest so McAshan <b>switched</b> the <b>ball</b> to his other hand and threw to an open tailback in the end zone. The tailback, who had given up on the play after seeing the almost sack, dropped the wide open touchdown. The game ended in a 34-3 loss for Georgia Tech. McAshan was also notorious for throwing interceptions, setting a GT record of 51 career interceptions, which was not broken until 2006 by Reggie Ball.|$|R
5000|$|Ballesteros and Azinger had {{previously}} locked horns in 1989 when Ballesteros {{tried to have}} a scuffed ball taken out of play which Azinger disagreed with. The bad blood escalated at Kiawah Island when {{on the morning of}} the Friday foursomes with Ballesteros partnering José María Olazábal against Paul Azinger and Chip Beck the Europeans noticed the Americans had changed the compression of the ball on the 7th tee which is in violation of the one-ball rule. Ballesteros accused his opponents of doing this at least three times since the start of the match. On speaking with the referee at first Azinger flatly denied it. However once it had become apparent to the Americans that they were not called up on the violation at the time of incident therefore could no longer be penalized by loss of hole they admitted to <b>switching</b> their <b>ball.</b> This incident was the stem of accusations of the U.S. side of repeated gamesmanship, bad sportsmanship and ill tactics in many future matches to come.|$|R
50|$|When {{possession}} of the <b>ball</b> <b>switches</b> to the other team, the forward rod becomes the rear rod and vice versa to minimize the distance the rod men have to move. However, {{at the end of}} the first and third quarters, when players switch directions on the field, the chain crew also moves (for example, a marker may move from one 32-yard line to the other 32-yard line). The rear rod man moves past the forward rod man and continues to mark the start of the series of downs, in the new orientation. The linesman and other officials supervise this movement, using one or more clips to exactly reposition the chains.|$|R
5000|$|Fernandez {{is perhaps}} the most ambidextrous player to have played the game since Carlos Loyzaga a {{generation}} before him. Almost always, whenever he would get the defensive rebound he would assume the role of [...] "point-center", leading the fast-break (a throwback to his point-guard days), which he admitted was a habit he could not break in the pros. Fernandez would dribble the ball running the middle of the court, either hitting the open man on either wing or finishing a lay-up with either hand. There were many instances when he would <b>switch</b> the <b>ball</b> from right hand to left hand, often drawing a foul or setting up a three-point play. One of his more famous moves was driving {{down the middle of the}} lane coming from the right side of the court, faking a right-handed shot and then, at the last second when the defender has committed himself, <b>switching</b> the <b>ball</b> to his left hand for an up-and-under scoop shot that almost always drew a foul. He had an ambidextrous hook shot that was almost impossible to stop and a weird-looking variation of a lay-up that was executed while [...] "fading away" [...] from the basket which made it equally intriguing. His [...] "elegant shot" [...] often came after a right-handed cross-over dribble and moving away from a defender. He used pivot moves, pump fakes, lookaway or no-look passes, looping shots, fadeaways and an array of what seemed to be trick shots from near or under the basket that he executed to perfection. He was doing this before Kevin McHale was doing his moves worthy of a chapter in an NBA playbook. Fernandez owned what was perhaps the craziest no-look pass that was executed on Philippine hardwood: an assist initiated as a fake behind-the-back pass going to one direction only to go the opposite direction at the precise moment when the recipient is ready to receive the pass. His pinpoint passing ability was so devastating to opponents because he often executed them at critical junctures of the game, either coming from his right or left hand. It didn't matter to Fernandez whether he was hitting the open man through a crowd of defenders or hitting the same open man via a Hail Mary pass from outside the backcourt. Philip Cezar and Abe King, two premier defenders of local players and imports alike, in television interviews, always said that Fernandez was the toughest assignment they ever had to handle.|$|R

The only thing the Joker left behind was a statue {{of his face and}} bust that was concealed under the spring contraption. Batman and Robin go to the museum to check everything out—they were suspicious the Joker would strike there in revenge because he had not been entered into The Comedy Hall of Fame. When arriving, they found out the Joker's statue was indeed there and decided he must be somewhere else. After everything's locked up, they realize that no one can break in, but that doesn't mean someone who isn't already in the building couldn't break out, which means the Joker's gang is likely already inside to begin with. Reentering the museum, they find the Joker trying to steal the valuable jewels inside, with henchmen named after comedy stars, who were hidden inside the busts.|$|R
