The Church says that its use of the legal system is necessary to protect its intellectual property and its right to freedom of religion.

According to U.S. History.org Puritan women were required to attend worship services, yet they could not to speak or offer prayer. Women were also not allowed to attend town meetings or be involved in the decisions that were discussed. If Puritan women were to be seen and not heard in public, then one can <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> of their works are not meant for public consumption.|$|E

25|$|Unlike {{the first}} three schools mentioned, this approach, {{associated}} with Joseph Maréchal (1878–1944), Karl Rahner (1904–84), and Bernard Lonergan (1904–84), does not oppose modern philosophy wholesale, but seeks to reconcile Thomism with a Cartesian subjectivist approach to knowledge in general, and Kantian epistemology in particular. It seems fair to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> Thomists otherwise tolerant of diverse approaches to Aquinas's thought tend to regard transcendental Thomism as having conceded too much to modern philosophy genuinely to count as a variety of Thomism, strictly speaking, and this school of thought has in any event been far more influential among theologians than among philosophers.|$|E

The variations that constitute types occur in the various facial features on Washington, and on his Toga and on the various lines of shading on the ornaments of the stamp design. Defining all the various types among these two denominations involves a highly specialized area of study that encompasses a sizable amount of additional information whose many details need accompanying illustrations and as such {{is beyond the scope}} of this section. It suffices to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> of the types are common to less common with only two types that are rare and valuable, one a 2-cent, 1916 issue, type II, the other a 2-cent 1919 issue, type II.2-cent, issue of Jun.14, 1919, type II (Scott 539);Scotts Specialized Catalogue of US Stamps Because it requires knowledge of and magnification to see the subtle variations in the lines of the image the valuable stamps can and have gone unnoticed for years before they are ever discovered, and sometimes turn up in common stamp collections, but this is very uncommon as these types are indeed rare. There are various places on-line, one listed in 'External links', 'Identifying the 2 and 3 cent types', that can provide detailed information about the 2c and 3c design types with an assortment of illustrations and charts to aid positive identification. Various publications like the popular Scott Specialized Catalogue of US Stamps also provide detailed and illustrated information for design types.|$|E

The liner notes <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> of the Glass Spider video comes from the nights of 7 and 9 November 1987, with some footage from the other nights, although Bowie biographer Nicholas Pegg claimed that most of the footage comes from the performance on the evening of 6 November. While a typical show from the tour ran over 2 hours with around 26 songs, the video release clocks in at under 2 hours and includes only about 20 songs. A 2007 Special Edition re-release includes a CD of the entire show as performed in Montreal, Canada on 30 August 1987, but does not change the video release. The tour and concert film were named after the track [...] "Glass Spider" [...] from the album.|$|E

2500|$|In 1994, former Mossad officer Victor Ostrovsky {{claimed in}} his book The Other Side of Deception that Mossad doctored the file of the then UN Secretary General to {{implicate}} him in Nazi crimes. These allegedly false documents were subsequently [...] "discovered" [...] by Benjamin Netanyahu in the UN file and triggered the [...] "Waldheim Affair". Ostrovsky says that this was motivated by Waldheim's criticism of Israel's war in Lebanon. Controversy surrounds Ostrovsky because many of his revelations have not been sourced or otherwise confirmed, leading several critics to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> of his work (including The Other Side of Deception) is fictional. Ostrovsky's service in Mossad was confirmed when the Israeli government unsuccessfully attempted to stop publication of the book.|$|E
2500|$|Critics overall {{praised the}} album's {{expanded}} instrumentation, and the acoustics that recording the album {{in a church}} afforded, but otherwise reaction to the album was polarized, {{particularly with regard to}} the lyrics.

Some critics praised its ultra-personal lyrics while others panned what they called its overt and excessive self-indulgence and [...] "ozone-layer lyrics" [...] described as unfathomable, impenetrable, and personally opaque. One scathing review suggested skipping the album, instead reading something [...] "a little bit more intelligible—like maybe Gravity's Rainbow written in Greek", while Rolling Stone went as far to bluntly <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> of the album's lyrics are [...] "ultimately mystifying and, well, bad".

Maher et al found that under the existing and projected high rates of greenhouse gas emissions there is little chance of another hiatus decade occurring after 2030, even if there were a large volcanic eruption after that time.
