5|$|There {{were five}} of them, a {{somewhat}} exceptional number: William P. Halliday, Samuel B. Halliday, Edwin W. Halliday, Henry L. Halliday, and Thomas W. Halliday. Of them all, I may {{be permitted to}} <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>while</b> they all differed from each other, they all exhibited features of character and conduct {{that would have given}} them prominence anywhere in the business world. No doubt in some one or two important respects, each one excelled the others. This was shown in those matters and things to which they gave their chief attention. Speaking of them and their families, so well represented here with us and elsewhere, {{it can be said that}} they have always stood for better things, not with assumption or pharisaically, but openly and firmly. They pushed their business enterprises with diligence, and had there been more of such men it would have been better for the city and for them also, I have no doubt.|$|E

25|$|From {{the latter}} 2000s to the present, Arroyo Seco {{and the rest}} of the Sierra Gorda in Querétaro have been {{experiencing}} numerous small earthquakes, with most registering from 2.5 to 3.5 on the Richter scale, generally imperceptible to humans. Seismologists <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>while</b> the number has been unusual, such activity is not and is due to the settling of the sedimentary rock which is below most of the Sierra Gorda region. However, Arroyo Seco and other municipalities have seismographs installed to monitor the situation.|$|E

25|$|Dalkowski {{was invited}} to major league spring {{training}} in 1963, and the Orioles expected to call {{him up to the}} majors. On March 23, Dalkowski was used as a relief pitcher during a game against the New York Yankees. Most sources <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>while</b> throwing a slider to Phil Linz, he felt something pop in his left elbow, {{which turned out to be}} a severe muscle strain. Some uncertainty over the cause of his injury exists, however, with other sources contending that he damaged his elbow while throwing to first after fielding a bunt from Yankees pitcher Jim Bouton. Either way, his arm never fully recovered.|$|E
25|$|The Assyrian Democratic Movement (or ADM) {{was one of}} {{the smaller}} {{political}} parties that emerged in the social chaos of the occupation. Its officials <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>while</b> members of the ADM also took part in the liberation of the key oil cities of Kirkuk and Mosul in the north, the Assyrians were not invited to join the steering committee that was charged with defining Iraq's future. The ethnic make-up of the Iraq Interim Governing Council briefly (September 2003 - June 2004) guided Iraq after the invasion included a single Assyrian Christian, Younadem Kana, a leader of the Assyrian Democratic Movement and an opponent of Saddam Hussein since 1979.|$|E
25|$|The {{judgment}} proposes {{several questions}} {{to be put to}} the Enlarged Board of Appeal in an effort to resolve perceived conflicts between the different decisions of the Boards of Appeal. In response to this, Alain Pompidou, then president of the European Patent Office (EPO), wrote to Lord Justice Jacob to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>while</b> clarification of certain issues relating to excluded subject matter would be welcomed, there were currently insufficient differences between relevant Board of Appeal decisions that would justify a referral. Instead, a referral would be appropriate if the approach taken by one Board of Appeal would lead to the grant of a patent whereas the approach taken by another Board would not. On 22 October 2008, Pompidou's successor Alison Brimelow did refer a number of questions to the Enlarged Board. In its opinion G 3/08, the Enlarged Board rejected the referral as inadmissible.|$|E

500|$|Actress and women's-health {{advocate}} Gabrielle Union, a rape victim, voiced {{support for}} the video on Twitter. Union called it [...] "brave" [...] and, although she {{did not agree with}} the eye-for-an-eye sentiment, she could relate to the situation. Union said that every rape victim or survivor is a unique situation, and that they all have an idea of how justice should be served. She admitted that she tried to shoot her rapist, but missed, and that she has since realised that committing murder as a form of justice for herself would not have made the situation better. She continued to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>while</b> it is [...] "understandable" [...] to desire to kill a rapist, unless it is in self-defense then it is not advisable.|$|E
500|$|With the Times ridiculing {{belief in}} the Pig-faced Lady, rival {{newspapers}} set out to defend her honour {{and that of the}} man who wished to marry her. The Morning Herald and Morning Chronicle both published the advertisement from her prospective suitor. The editor of the Morning Chronicle announced that, in his opinion, the advertisement from the [...] "desperate fortune-hunter" [...] had not been immoral or indecent, and thus in his opinion {{there was no reason to}} decline to publish it. He went on to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>while</b> deformities of this nature were unknown to doctors, it was certainly possible that a facially disfigured woman existed and that her deformities had been exaggerated in accounts; he also chided the Times for not returning the payment for the rejected advertisement. The Morning Herald, meanwhile, speculated that the Pig-faced Lady's deformities may have been caused by her mother's [...] "force of imagination, in consequence of a dog having suddenly leaped on her".|$|E
500|$|Sesame Street head writer Norman Stiles {{was chosen}} to write the {{segments}} about Mr. Hooper's death. [...] The episode focused on {{the life cycle of}} birth and death by also mentioning the birth of a baby, and by remembering Mr. Hooper. [...] Stiles said, [...] "We decided to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>while</b> Mr. Hooper was not here anymore, we will always have that part of him that lives within the heart, that we have our love and that it will always stay". [...] Stiles wanted to convey that expressing grief for someone who had died was difficult for both adults and children. [...] Instead of providing an explanation, the adults of Sesame Street tell Mr. Hooper's friend Big Bird, when he asked why Mr. Hooper had died, that there was no real reason, that it happened, as Gordon tells Big Bird, [...] "Just because". [...] The show's outside experts advised Stiles and the producers to remove the line because they were concerned that an open-ended explanation would not be enough for children, but Stiles kept the line because it was an acknowledgement, as Gikow stated, that there is never a good explanation about why people die.|$|E

500|$|In {{the gospel}} accounts, Jesus devotes {{a large portion}} of his {{ministry}} performing miracles, especially healings. The miracles can be classified into two main categories: healing miracles and nature miracles. The healing miracles include cures for physical ailments, exorcisms, and resurrections of the dead. The nature miracles show Jesus' power over nature, and include turning water into wine, walking on water, and calming a storm, among others. Jesus states that his miracles are from a divine source. When Jesus' opponents suddenly accuse him of performing exorcisms by the power of Beelzebul, the prince of demons, Jesus counters that he performs them by the [...] "Spirit of God" [...] (...) or [...] "finger of God", arguing that all logic suggests that Satan would not let his demons assist the Children of God because it would divide Satan's house and bring his kingdom to desolation; furthermore, he asks his opponents that if he exorcises by Beel'zebub, [...] "by whom do your sons cast them out?" [...] (...) [...] In , he goes on to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>while</b> all manner of sin, [...] "even insults against God" [...] or [...] "insults against the son of man", shall be forgiven, whoever insults goodness (or [...] "The Holy Spirit") shall never be forgiven; he/she carries the guilt of his/her sin forever.|$|E
500|$|Shatner {{says that}} acting in Star Trek was [...] "life-consuming" [...] {{and left him}} [...] "barely any time for family", {{and that this was}} the reason for his divorce from Gloria Rand, his first wife. He {{describes}} a subsequent succession of sexual partners, including, he says, Star Trek actresses. He also talks about the death of his father, Joseph Shatner, and of his third wife, Nerine Kidd, who accidentally drowned in a pool in 1999, losing a battle with alcoholism. Shatner recalls that Nimoy had expressed concern about Kidd's alcoholism and warned him about marrying her. Another topic is Nimoy's fine-art photography, which deals with spirituality and sensuality. Both Shatner and Nimoy <b>say</b> <b>that,</b> <b>while</b> they are glad that Star Trek became successful, they wish their subsequent fame had encroached less on their privacy. They also describe having been typecast {{as a result of their}} roles in Star Trek, and say that this has had repercussions on their respective acting careers. Shatner recounts his initial surprise that, at science fiction conventions, the fans seem to like each other more than they like the science fiction actors. The film concludes with Nimoy putting his arm around Shatner's shoulder and saying, [...] "You're my best friend." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Mrs. California" [...] {{received}} mixed {{responses from}} critics. The A.V. Club reviewer Myles McNutt said the episode had {{the possibility of}} being a great episode of The Office, but that it did not live up to that possibility. He suggested that the writers could tell jokes, but could not successfully [...] "break a story anymore". He also called the subplot a mixed bag for featuring Dwight as a caricature of his former self, but complimented the character development for Darryl which started in [...] "Lotto". He gave the episodes a C+. Hannah Lawrence of Hollywood.com called the episode a large improvement over [...] "Gettysburg" [...] and also called it possibly her [...] "favorite episode of the season so far". Chris Plante of New York called Robert California the worst part of The Office and said that he kept Andy from being more of a lead character for the series. TV Guide writer Bruce Fretts criticized the episode for under using guest star Maura Tierney. He also said that the episode suffered without former series star Steve Carell to serve as the comic foil. IGN writer Cindy White said the episode did not feel like The Office and called it [...] "the exact opposite". Despite this, she went on to compliment Susan asking Andy on a date and the pairing of Darryl and Val as a couple, saying that the latter had possibilities. She ultimately gave the episode a 7.5/10. Joseph Kratzer from What Culture? gave the episode three out of five stars and wrote, [...] "I'm going {{to go out on a}} bit of a limb here and <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>while</b> 'Mrs. California' was of course not a return to form for The Office, it was a good example of how the series might define itself in this new Michael-less era." [...] M. Giant of Television without Pity gave the episode a B+. [...] After viewing [...] "Mrs. California," [...] Washington Post writer Hank Stuever named The Office one of the ten best TV shows of 2011 and said that the episode proved the series could still deliver cringe humor without Carell. Multiple critics complimented the cold open to the episode.|$|E
5000|$|Spider Robinson {{gave the}} novel a mixed review, <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>while</b> [...] "the book reads well [...] [...] [...], {{individual}} sections are often brilliant, {{and the message}} is incisive and timely," [...] that [...] "as a story it limps" [...] and that many characters, including the main antagonists, [...] "are cut from cardboard." [...] New York Times reviewer Gerald Jonas was even more critical, <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>while</b> Brunner was attempting to write [...] "slice-of-life" [...] fiction about a future society, {{the result of his}} arbitrary choices about social details is that [...] "the entire fictional edifice collapses like a house of cards." ...|$|R

[...] It went on to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>while</b> there was a probability of major earthquakes at the predicted times, that probability was low, and recommend that [...] "the prediction not be given serious consideration." ...|$|E

2500|$|Since {{the onset}} of the Syrian War, the Israeli {{military}} is reportedly preparing itself for potential threats should there be a power vacuum in Syria. [...] "After Assad and after establishing or strengthening their foothold in Syria they are going to move and deflect their effort and attack Israel," [...] an Israeli official told The Associated Press in January 2014. Some experts <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>while</b> the encroaching militant forces on Israel's border will heighten security measures, the advancements are not likely to create significant changes to Israel’s policy disengagement in the Syria crisis.

2500|$|Among {{opponents of}} the {{mainstream}} scientific assessment, some <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>while</b> there is agreement that humans do {{have an effect on}} climate, there is no universal agreement about the quantitative magnitude of anthropogenic global warming (AGW) relative to natural forcings and its harm to benefit ratio. Other opponents assert that some kind of ill-defined [...] "consensus argument" [...] is being used, and then dismiss this by arguing that science is based on facts rather than consensus. Some highlight the dangers of focusing on only one viewpoint in the context of what they say is unsettled science, or point out that science is based on facts and not on opinion polls or consensus.|$|E
