40|$|This article {{compares the}} results of Austria’s Household Finance and Consumption Survey (HFCS) on <b>savings</b> <b>deposits</b> and {{estimates}} on total financial assets with administrative records from the national accounts for the household sector. The microdata that are newly generated through the HFCS and the detailed (internally available) breakdown of <b>savings</b> <b>deposits</b> in the existing macrodata (financial accounts) lend themselves to a more in-depth analysis of {{the similarities and differences}} in these two sources. Comparing the data shows that the HFCSbased aggregate estimates are lower than the financial accounts data, which is in line with evidence from the literature. The article also shows, however, that the survey adequately captures the underlying patterns at the microlevel in terms of the overall financial portfolio allocation and the distribution of <b>savings</b> <b>deposits</b> over detailed breakdowns. Moreover, a simulation based on the HFCS data demonstrates the effect that the inclusion of <b>savings</b> <b>deposits</b> in the most affluent tail of the distribution has on common statistics. Undercoverage above all of the upper deposit ranges suggests an underestimation or bias in the statistics. This underestimation, however, can be shown to be relatively minor, particularly in the case of robust statistical measures, such as the median or percentile ratios...|$|R
40|$|There are {{a number}} of studies that have {{explained}} why China should transit to a consumption-driven growth model or achieve a more rebalanced growth model. But there are few studies to test the relationship between saving, consumption and economic development in the Chinese economy. Thus, this study conducted two panel data analysis to test the relationship between saving, consumption and economic development in China. Since the area of research by the previous studies focused on urban-rural, provincial level, and national level, regional variations of saving have not been widely researched upon. Therefore, this study would try to reveal the regional saving variations and used the regional’s context to explain the phenomenon. The method of Ordinary least square (OLS) regression has been used for the two regression models and the data is obtained from the CEIC China Premium Database. The time period for the prefecture level panel data analysis is from 2003 to 2013, while the provincial level panel data analysis is from 1989 to 2014. The regression results showed that the real <b>saving</b> <b>deposit</b> in the eastern prefecture level cities are determined by most factors in the regression model. The central prefecture level cities’ real <b>saving</b> <b>deposits</b> are influenced by fewer factors while the western prefecture level cities are affected by the fewest factors in the regression model. There are six main findings for regional variations of saving. First, the higher the cost of living and the price of fixed asset, the lower the real <b>saving</b> <b>deposits.</b> Second, as real average wage increase, real <b>saving</b> <b>deposits</b> would also increase. Third, government social expenditure does not necessarily reduce real <b>saving</b> <b>deposits.</b> Fourth, an increase in population does not automatically increase real <b>saving</b> <b>deposit</b> as real <b>saving</b> <b>deposit</b> depends on the capacity of land. Fifth, urbanization affects regions’ real saving differently as it hinges on regional characteristics and development. Besides, the study found that there exists a positive relationship between China’s saving, consumption and economic development and Keynes’ paradox of thrift is inapplicable in China’s case. Keynes’ paradox of thrift is inapplicable to China as it incorrectly defined saving as hoarding of cash, assumed investments are based on interest rates and failed to incorporate the differences between the West and China. published_or_final_versionChina Development StudiesMasterMaster of Arts in China Development Studie...|$|R

40|$|We address two {{questions}} {{about the impact of}} the UBS-SBC merger: (i) How will the concentration in the Swiss retail banking market change, and (ii) what are the expected consequences for the consumers. The answer to the first question is based on a comparison of Herfindahl and C 3 -indices in 1997 as they actually have been to as they could have been if the banks already had been merged. For both types of indices, and for the two product groups considered (loans and mortgages, <b>savings</b> <b>deposits)</b> the impact of the merger is huge. To answer the second question, we have examined how concentration interfered with <b>savings</b> <b>deposits</b> and mortgages interest rates in the previous decade, between the cantons and over time. The results obtained for <b>savings</b> <b>deposits</b> indicate that the structure performance hypothesis dominates for large cantons, while the efficiency hypothesis and the contestable market hypotheses cannot be rejected for small cantons. For mortgages, the contestable market hypotheses clearly dominates for large cantons, while for small cantons evidence is split between the efficiency hypothesis and the contestable market hypothesis. ...|$|R
