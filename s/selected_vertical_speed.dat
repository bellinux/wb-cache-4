50|$|A pilot {{aiming for}} a 500-foot per minute descent, for example, may find himself {{descending}} too rapidly. He begins to apply up elevator until the <b>vertical</b> <b>speed</b> indicator shows 500 feet per minute. However, because the <b>vertical</b> <b>speed</b> indicator lags the actual <b>vertical</b> <b>speed,</b> the pilot is actually descending at much less than 500 feet per minute. The pilot then begins applying down elevator until the <b>vertical</b> <b>speed</b> indicator reads 500 feet per minute, starting the cycle over. It's harder than it might seem to stabilize the <b>vertical</b> <b>speed</b> because the airspeed also constantly changes.|$|R
50|$|In aeronautics, {{the rate}} of climb (RoC) is an aircraft's <b>vertical</b> <b>speed</b> - {{the rate of}} {{positive}} altitude change with respect to time or distance. In most ICAO member countries, even in otherwise metric countries, this is usually expressed in feet per minute (ft/min). Elsewhere, it is commonly expressed in metre per second (m/s). The rate of climb in an aircraft is indicated with a <b>vertical</b> <b>speed</b> indicator (VSI) or instantaneous <b>vertical</b> <b>speed</b> indicator (IVSI).|$|R
5000|$|TCAS II is {{the first}} system that was {{introduced}} in 1989 and is {{the current generation of}} instrument warning TCAS, used in the majority of commercial aviation aircraft (see table below). A US Airways 737 was the first aircraft certified with the AlliedBendix (now Honeywell) TCAS II system. It offers all the benefits of TCAS I, but will also offer the pilot direct, vocalized instructions to avoid danger, known as a [...] "Resolution Advisory" [...] (RA). The suggestive action may be [...] "corrective", suggesting the pilot change <b>vertical</b> <b>speed</b> by announcing, [...] "Descend, descend", [...] "Climb, climb" [...] or [...] "Adjust <b>Vertical</b> <b>Speed</b> Adjust" [...] (meaning reduce <b>vertical</b> <b>speed).</b> By contrast a [...] "preventive" [...] RA may be issued which simply warns the pilots not to deviate from their present <b>vertical</b> <b>speed,</b> announcing, [...] "Monitor vertical speed" [...] or [...] "Maintain <b>vertical</b> <b>speed,</b> Maintain". TCAS II systems coordinate their resolution advisories before issuing commands to the pilots, so that if one aircraft is instructed to descend, the other will typically be told to climb [...] - [...] maximising the separation between the two aircraft.|$|R

500|$|The variometer, {{also known}} as the <b>vertical</b> <b>speed</b> {{indicator}} (VSI) or the vertical velocity indicator (VVI), is the pitot-static instrument used {{to determine whether or not}} an aircraft is flying in level flight. [...] The <b>vertical</b> <b>speed</b> specifically shows the rate of climb or the rate of descent, which is measured in feet per minute or meters per second. [...] The <b>vertical</b> <b>speed</b> is measured through a mechanical linkage to a diaphragm located within the instrument. [...] The area surrounding the diaphragm is vented to the static port through a calibrated leak (which also may be known as a [...] "restricted diffuser"). [...] When the aircraft begins to increase altitude, the diaphragm will begin to contract at a rate faster than that of the calibrated leak, causing the needle to show a positive <b>vertical</b> <b>speed.</b> [...] The reverse of this situation is true when an aircraft is descending. [...] The calibrated leak varies from model to model, but the average time for the diaphragm to equalize pressure is between 6 and 9 seconds.|$|R

40|$|International audienceOptimal {{foraging}} theories {{predict that}} air-breathing, diving foragers should maximize time spent at feeding depths, and minimize time spent travelling between surface and depth (transits). The {{second part of}} this hypothesis was tested in free-ranging king penguins Aptenodytes patagonicus using measurements of <b>vertical</b> <b>speed,</b> swimming speed, body angle and flipper stroke frequency during transits in relation to an index of foraging success (number of wiggles), during the bottom and the ascent phases of the dive. We found that, except for flipper stroke frequency, all measured variables increased with diving depth and foraging activity. The change in <b>vertical</b> <b>speed</b> was driven mainly by a change in body angle and a slight change in swimming speed. These results suggest a shortening of transit duration in response to increased foraging activity. Whereas the time spent commuting between the surface and foraging depths was reduced when foraging activity was high, <b>vertical</b> <b>speed</b> was only at its maximum over {{a small part of}} both ascent and descent phases of the dive. Within the first 10 [*]m of descent, <b>vertical</b> <b>speed</b> increased with maximum dive depth and an index of foraging activity, suggesting that penguins anticipated their diving depth and foraging activity. Our results show that foraging king penguins adjust their diving behaviour in response to both diving depth and foraging activity. Further studies should consider ecological, physiological or mechanical constraints as factors that may limit foraging optimization...|$|R

For being {{convenient}} for researching the dynamic characteristic and the improvement {{and use of}} the planar six bar mechanism, for improving the dynamic technical performance, the three-dimensional solid model of the mechanism was established with ADAMS.
