40|$|Space Shuttle true airspeed, {{angle of}} attack, and {{sideslip}} angle are currently derived from inertial guidance information. A new method is proposed {{which offers a}} potential improvement in Shuttle <b>safety</b> during entry. <b>Angle</b> of attack, sideslip angle and true airspeed could be measured directly at heights from 120 km down to 20 km by Doppler sensing three independent true airspeeds along the Shuttle body axes. Two types of Doppler measurement sensors, employing either passive detection of atmospheric radiation or coherent detection of scattered laser light are discussed. The proposed technique is essentially solid-state and robust, and is well suited for use in future small hypersonic vehicles that require flight control in the Upper Atmosphere of the earth or in probes destined for the other planets...|$|R
40|$|A {{crane system}} offers a typical control problem being an under {{actuated}} MIMO system. In this paper the precise modelling of a 2 D gantry crane system with 3 DOF is considered. First a simple dynamic {{model of the}} system is obtained using Lagrange’s equations of motion. Then, friction non-linearities were added to the model, which were found to decrease the output magnitudes from reference values. The model was further improved by considering the possibility of 3 D angular swing which showed more accurate transient responses. Finally, the dynamics of hoisting cable flexibility was added to the system resulting in a complex model requiring time consuming simulation. But, significant change was seen in the angular swing output which will significantly affect controller performance. The models considering either flexibility or 3 D load swing are comparatively less complex than the combined model. The precise model to be considered is a trade-off between <b>safety</b> (minimum swing <b>angle)</b> and precise load handling...|$|R
40|$|Chieko FujiiFaculty of Nursing and Medical Care, Keio University, Kanagawa, JapanBackground: Complications {{resulting}} from venipuncture include vein and nerve damage, hematoma, and neuropathic pain. Although the basic procedures are understood, few analyses of actual data exist. It {{is important to}} improve the safety standards of this technique during venipuncture. This study aimed to obtain data on actual needle movement during vacuum venipuncture {{in order to develop}} appropriate educational procedures. Methods: Six experienced nurses were recruited to collect blood samples from 64 subjects. These procedures were recorded using a digital camera. Software was then used to track and analyze motion without the use of a marker {{in order to maintain the}} sterility of the needle. Movement along the X- and Y-axes during blood sampling was examined. Results: Approximately 2. 5 cm of the needle was inserted into the body, of which 6 mm resulted from advancing or moving the needle following puncture. The mean calculated puncture angle was 15. 2 °. Given the hazards posed by attaching and removing the blood collection tube, as well as by manipulating the needle to fix its position, the needle became unstable whether it was fixed or not fixed. Conclusion: This study examined venipuncture procedures and showed that the method was influenced by increased needle movement. Focusing on skills for puncturing the skin, inserting the needle into the vein, and changing hands while being conscious of needle-tip stability may be essential for improving the safety of venipuncture.

40|$|Objective: In cervico-thoracic {{junction}} (CTJ), the use {{of strong}} fixation device such as pedicle screw-rod system is often required. Purpose {{of this study is}} to analyze the anatomical features of C 7 and T 1 pedicles related to screw insertion and to evaluate the safety of pedicle screw insertion at these levels. Methods: Nineteen patients underwent posterior CTJ fixation with C 7 and/or T 1 included in fixation levels. Seventeen patients had tumorous conditions and two with post-laminectomy kyphosis. The anatomical features were analyzed for C 7 and T 1 pedicles in 19 patients using computerized tomography (CT). Pedicle screw and rod fixation system was used in 16 patients. Pedicle violation by screws was evaluated with postoperative CT scan. Results: The mean values of the width, height, stable depth, <b>safety</b> <b>angle,</b> transverse angle, and sagittal angle of C 7 pedicles were 6. 9 ± 1. 34 mm, 8. 23 ± 1. 18 mm, 30. 93 ± 4. 65 mm, 26. 42 ± 7. 91 degrees, 25. 9 ± 4. 83 degrees, and 10. 6 ± 3. 39 degrees. At T 1 pedicles, anatomic parameters were similar to those of C 7. The pedicle violation revealed that 64. 1 % showed grade I violation and 35. 9 % showed grade II violation, overall. As for C 7 pedicle screw insertion, grade I was 61. 5 % and grade II 38. 5 %. At T 1 level, grade I was 65. 0 % and grade II 35. 0 %. There was no significant difference in violation rate between the whole group, C 7, and T 1 group. Conclusion: C 7 pedicles can withstand pedicle screw insertion. C 7 pedicle and T 1 pedicle are anatomically very similar. With {{the use of}} adequate fluoroscopic oblique view, pedicle screw can be safely inserted at C 7 and T 1 levels...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{takes the}} {{statistical}} approach to road safety issues {{as a starting}} point, for example: {{to what extent do}} specific developments or measures contribute to the {{decrease in the number of}} traffic casualties and what does that teach us for the future? For a quantitative answer to this type of question, the author searches for numerical relations between the observed changes in the number of traffic crashes or the number of traffic casualties on the one hand, and the possible explanations on the other hand: changes in policy, changes in traffic behaviour, changes in exposure, the introduction of specific measures, et cetera. Both the road safety data and the possibly explanatory data show many imperfections and inaccuracies. If this is not taken into account in an analysis it can result in incorrect or unjustified conclusions. This thesis presents a new approach toward the customary time series analyses, specifically from the road <b>safety</b> research <b>angle.</b> The approach is based on so-called structural time series models and combines three fundamental aspects simultaneously. This makes it possible to include multiple explanatory variables in the model as well as multiple dependent variables like the number of accidents and the number of casualties. The model also addresses observational errors or even data that are missing altogether. Finally, the methodology enables the researcher to decompose the road safety process and it uncertainties in interpretable components. Using empirical road safety data the thesis demonstrates the effect and the applicability of the methodology. Topics that are discussed in his thesis are, for example, the registration level of accidents, the ways of determining urban and rural mobility, and the effects of weather conditions on road safety.

40|$|Abstract. Medical Tele-diagnosis Robot (MTR) is a cost {{effective}} telemedicine mobile robot that provides tele-presence capability for the specialist {{on a remote}} location to virtually meet the patient, perform diagnostics and consult the resident doctor regarding the patient via internet. This paper highlights {{on the development of}} a doctor-robot interface where the doctor or user can control the robot reliably via regular internet connection from a different location, a distributed secured network for MTR’s communication, an audiovisual communication system for tele-diagnosis and a navigation safety system called Danger Monitoring System (DMS) as part of MTR’s assistive internet based navigation remote control system. The overall setup and maintenance cost of MTR is reduced by adopting a decentralized network via hybrid P 2 P technology. With this, the network load is distributed among the users. As for the audiovisual system, the timeliness of the video transmission from the robot to the operator can be attained by CUDA H. 264 video encoding {{to reduce the size of}} the video stream and by taking advantage of the highly-parallel processors in the graphics processing unit. Combinations of sensors are place around the robot to provide data on the robot’s surrounding during operation.

40|$|The {{increasing}} demand on high performance fighter aircraft has introduced {{areas of concern}} associated with the handling qualities, control and <b>safety</b> at high <b>angles</b> of incidence. Pilots are limiting combat effectiveness by cautiously avoiding hazardous regions of the flight envelope. This thesis {{presents the results of}} the work undertaken in analysing the F- 16 aircraft's handling characteristics during dangerous departure and deep stall conditions. It also proposes a methodology that will increase combat effectiveness and safety. Human factors and performance are still fundamental to flight safety and pilot decisions and reactions during dangerous scenarios are critical. Design excellence and pilot performance are some of the primary means of obtaining combat superiority. However, this goal presents a major challenge due to the complex, multi-technological nature of modern aircraft. The achievement of conflicting objectives such as optimum combat performance and safety during difficult manoeuvres near and beyond the aircraft flight envelop -limits calls for a more holistic determination of the aircraft design and operational procedures. An all axis six degree-of-freedom simulation was built and used to investigate the onset of allegedly spurious pitching moments that lead to departure and deep stall. The model is verified against in-flight tests data and used to investigate all possible scenarios that would be too dangerous to complete in the air. The Advanced Continuous Simulation Language (ACSL) computer codes are contained in the present thesis. A methodology is proposed and has been in-flight tested for one departure test case to date. A change in approach from a departure and deep stall prevention approach to one of deep stall recovery is recommended. This allows the pilot to use {{the full extent of the}} control surfaces without being inhibited or disabled by the prevention systems...|$|R
40|$|Stair ascent is a {{demanding}} activity which requires around 85 ° of knee flexion. Analysing this task may give {{an indication of}} Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) joint function. This study looked at short-term outcomes to give information regarding initial recovery after TKA surgery. Three-dimensional motion analysis was carried out on five healthy control participants and five TKA patients (Columbus®, B. Braun Aesculap, Tuttlingen) performing five stair ascents at their own self-selected pace, choosing {{whether or not to}} use handrails. Control data were recorded at one assessment and patient data both pre-operatively and at mean follow up of 10 weeks (8 to 12) post-operatively. The maximum knee flexion achieved during stair ascent was calculated. Four patients walked with a step over step strategy enabling comparison with the control group. There was no change in mean flexion angle from pre-operative to post-operation for either the operated side [mean pre-operatively= 84 ° (76 °- 94 °) vs. 82 ° (79 °- 86 °) post-operatively, paired t-test p= 0. 67] or the non-operated side [mean pre-operatively= 81 ° (61 °- 87 °) vs. 81 ° (70 °- 95 °) postoperatively, paired t-test p= 0. 56]. This was lower than mean for the control group, 97 ° (90 °- 106 °) t-test p< 0. 001. The pre- and post-operative flexion angles of the patient who walked with a step by step strategy was 55 ° and 56 ° on the operated side and 43 ° and 52 ° on the non-operated side. Knee flexion during stair ascent was similar both pre- and at 10 weeks post operation. Post-operative function did not reach control group values. The large variation between individuals for flexion of the non-operated side may represent different strategies for stair ascent: higher angles to achieve a greater ground clearance for <b>safety,</b> or lower <b>angles</b> to allow the patient to ascend faster so the operated support leg spends less time under load. Further work on a larger number of patients is required to understand this finding...|$|R
40|$|The {{factors which}} affect the {{engineering}} properties of calcium carbonate cemented soil are examined. The influence of calcium carbonate content, molding moisture content, and confining {{pressure on the}} strength characteristics of two types of soil is investigated in two distinct phases of the research. Type A soil, obtained from the University of Arizona Campbell Avenue Farm in Tucson, {{was used for the}} artificially cemented specimen stage. It is composed of sand and silt-size particles with some clay and is virtually free of calcium carbonate in its natural state. Sierrita soil, obtained from the Twin Buttes Open Pit Mine south of Tucson, was used for the reconstituted sample stage. It is naturally cemented with calcium carbonate and is composed mainly of sand, gravel, a small amount of silt, and occasional large-sized (boulder and cobble) particles. Specimens for triaxial compression testing were compacted for each phase of the study under carefully controlled conditions. Three test series were carried out on Type A soil artificially cemented with calcium carbonate. Three percentages (0 %, 15 %, and 30 %) on a dry weight basis of the soil were used. Two molding water contents, one dry and one wet of optimum moisture content, were established for each test series. Unconsolidated undrained triaxial compression tests were carried out on oven-dried specimens at three different confining pressures to obtain shear strength parameters. The fabric characteristics of selected specimens were then defined by viewing them under a scanning electron microscope. The results indicate that the strength of the calcium carbonate cemented soil depends on the distribution and not necessarily the content of the cementing agent within the soil mass. Visual examination of the various microstructures of the artificially cemented soil confirmed the hypothesis that strength gain occurs when the calcium carbonate particles are concentrated at the points of contact between soil grains. Visual examination of the fabric of the naturally cemented Sierrita soil showed the microstructure to be highly compressed with weathered calcium carbonate particles dominating the soil structure. The calcium carbonate content was found to range from 14 to 23 %. Because of sampling difficulties, an in situ cohesion value for the Sierrita soil could not be obtained from conventional laboratory tests. Therefore, the value was obtained by back analysis of the stability of actual slopes existing at Twin Buttes Mine. Slope stability analyses using Bishop's Modified Method with a search routine based on the Simplex Method of Nelder and Mead were performed. Stability analyses were also performed using strength properties of artificially cemented Type A soil. These analyses showed the relationships among cohesion, friction <b>angle,</b> <b>safety</b> factor, and calcium carbonate content for a specified slope geometry...|$|R
40|$|Kooperativ körning är fenomenet av uppkopplade väg fordon som utbyter {{information}} för att uppnå säkrare och mer effektiva trafiksituationer. Det är en invecklad kontext som ger nya synvinklar på området funktionell säkerhet. Det kan automatiseras, och då autonoma fordon är beroende av pålitlig information för att kunna fatta beslut, så uppstår frågan med tillit till datamottagen genom kooperativa körningskanaler. Även bortsatt från området datasäkerhet, finns fortfarande en risk att brister i andra fordon kan orsaka att inkommande kommunikationssignaler ej blir trovärdiga. I det här examensarbetet visas att antaganden om nivån av tillförlitlighet till data från externa fordon kan ha en signifikant påverkan på den slutgiltiga arkitekturen. Det visas också att det varken att fullt lita på, eller att inte alls lita på data mottagen genom kooperativa körningskanaler, är optimalt när hänsyn tas till säkerhet, nyttjande av kommunikationsmöjligheter och kostnader. På grund av komplexiteten i kooperativ körning utförs analyserna med den nya och tillsynes lovande metoden System-teoretisk process analys (STPA). För tillfället är det praxis inom fordonsindustrin att för funktionell säkerhet rätta sig till standarden ISO 26262, som inte ger någon naturlig väg att implementera STPA. Därför presenterar detta examensarbete en utvecklingsprocess som nyttjar fördelarna med STPA och rättar sig efter ISO 26262 standarden. STPA har störst potential under produktutveckling vid system design, men även andra användningsområden har identifierats. STPA är en modern, generell analysmetod som aldrig tidigare används i kontexten kooperativ körning. Därför inleder detta examensarbete med att validera dess tillämpbarhet i denna specifika kontext. Utvärderingen utförs genom en studie av ett verkligt fall, kopplat till KTHs deltagande i Grand Cooperative Driving Challenge - en tävling av i-GAME, menat att snabba på implementeringen av kooperativ körning i Europa. Metodens validitet i kontexten styrks av fler än en analytiker, utvecklingsteamet för kooperativ körning på KTH, en klients godkännande av resultat, samt av akademisk granskning. Co-operative {{driving is}} {{the phenomenon of}} connected road vehicles exchanging information to achieve safer and more efficient traffic. It is a convoluted context, which gives the topic of functional <b>safety</b> new complex <b>angles.</b> It can be automated, and as autonomous vehicles are dependent on reliable information for decision making, the issue of trusting data received over co-operation communication channels is raised. Disregarding the topic of security, {{there is still the}} possibility of failures in external vehicles causing incoming transmissions to be untrustworthy. In this thesis, it is shown that premises regarding levels of external trust can have significant impacts on the final architecture. It is also shown that neither fully trusting, nor not trusting data received over co-operation communication channels is the best option, when considering safety, usage of communication potential and cost. Because of the complexity of co-operative driving, the analyses are performed using the new and promising method of Systems-Theoretic process analyses (STPA). The current best practice of automotive functional safety is to comply with the domain specific ISO 26262 standard, which does not provide a natural way of implementing STPA. Therefore, this thesis also presents a development process which utilises the benefits of STPA, while complying to the ISO 26262 standard. STPA has the greatest potential during the product development at system level, though other uses have also been identified. STPA is a generic analysis method, which has previously not been used in the context of cooperative driving. This thesis therefor begins by validating the applicability of STPA in this specific context. The evaluation is performed using a real world case study connected to KTH’s participation in the Grand Cooperative Driving Challenge - a competition by i-GAME to speed up the implementation of co-operative driving in Europe. The validity of the method when applied to this context is strengthened by multiple analysts, the KTH co-operative driving development team, client approval of results and academic reviews...|$|R
