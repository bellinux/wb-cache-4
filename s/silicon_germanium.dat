5|$|Boron, <b>silicon,</b> <b>germanium,</b> arsenic, antimony, and {{tellurium}} are recognised commonly as metalloids. Depending on the author, one or {{more from}} selenium, polonium, or astatine are sometimes added to the list. Boron sometimes is excluded, by itself, or with silicon. Sometimes tellurium is not regarded as a metalloid. The inclusion of antimony, polonium, and astatine as metalloids also has been questioned.|$|E
5|$|Germanium is a {{chemical}} element with symbolGe and atomic number32. It is a lustrous, hard, grayish-white metalloid in the carbon group, chemically similar to its group neighbors tin and silicon. Pure germanium is a semiconductor with an appearance similar to elemental silicon. Like <b>silicon,</b> <b>germanium</b> naturally reacts and forms complexes with oxygen in nature.|$|E
5|$|Elemental gallium is {{not found}} in nature, but it is easily {{obtained}} by smelting. Very pure gallium metal has a silvery color and its solid metal fractures conchoidally like glass. Gallium liquid expands by 3.1% when it solidifies; therefore, {{it should not be}} stored in glass or metal containers because the container may rupture when the gallium changes state. Gallium shares the higher-density liquid state with a short list of other materials that includes water, <b>silicon,</b> <b>germanium,</b> antimony, bismuth, and plutonium.|$|E
5000|$|Certain pure {{elements}} {{are found in}} Group 14 of the periodic table; the most commercially important of these {{elements are}} <b>silicon</b> and <b>germanium.</b> <b>Silicon</b> and <b>germanium</b> are used here effectively because they have 4 valence electrons in their outermost shell which gives them the ability to gain or lose electrons equally at the same time.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the work}} is {{establishment}} of relationship between spectral (nuclear magnetic resonance) parameters and the level of coordination interaction; a study of diasteriometry of 3, 7, 10 -replaced atrans. Relationship between the structure of pentacoordinated compounds of <b>silicon</b> and <b>germanium</b> and NMR spectrum parameters is established. New classes of hypervalent compounds of <b>silicon</b> and <b>germanium</b> are received.

50|$|From Supersymmetry, the {{probability}} of a spin-independent interaction between a WIMP and a nucleus would be related to the amount of nucleons in the nucleus. Thus, a WIMP {{would be more likely to}} interact with a germanium detector than a <b>silicon</b> detector, since <b>germanium</b> is a much heavier element. Neutrons would be able to interact with both <b>silicon</b> and <b>germanium</b> detectors with similar probability. By comparing rates of interactions between <b>silicon</b> and <b>germanium</b> detectors, CDMS is able to determine {{the probability}} of interactions being caused by neutrons.|$|R
5|$|The six {{commonly}} recognised metalloids are boron, <b>silicon,</b> <b>germanium,</b> arsenic, antimony, and tellurium. Five {{elements are}} less frequently so classified: carbon, aluminium, selenium, polonium, and astatine. On a standard periodic table, all eleven {{are in a}} diagonal area in the p-block extending from boron at the upper left to astatine at lower right, along the dividing line between metals and nonmetals shown on some periodic tables.|$|E
5|$|Boron, <b>silicon,</b> <b>germanium,</b> {{antimony}} and tellurium, {{as well as}} heavier {{metals and}} metalloids such as Sm, Hg, Tl, Pb, Bi and Se, {{can be found in}} topological insulators. These are alloys or compounds which, at ultracold temperatures or room temperature (depending on their composition), are metallic conductors on their surfaces but insulators through their interiors. Cadmium arsenide Cd3As2, at about 1 K, is a Dirac-semimetal—a bulk electronic analogue of graphene—in which electrons travel effectively as massless particles. These two classes of material are thought to have potential quantum computing applications.|$|E
5|$|Five metalloids—boron, <b>silicon,</b> <b>germanium,</b> arsenic and antimony—can {{be found}} in cell phones (along with at least 39 other metals and nonmetals). Tellurium is {{expected}} to find such use. Of the less often recognised metalloids, phosphorus, gallium (in particular) and selenium have semiconductor applications. Phosphorus is used in trace amounts as a dopant for n-type semiconductors. The commercial use of gallium compounds is dominated by semiconductor applications—in integrated circuits; cell phones; laser diodes; light-emitting diodes; photodetectors; and solar cells. Selenium {{is used in the}} production of solar cells and in high-energy surge protectors.|$|E
40|$|Compared with direct-gap semiconductors, {{the valley}} {{degeneracy}} of <b>silicon</b> and <b>germanium</b> opens up new channels for spin relaxation that counteract the spin degeneracy of the inversion-symmetric system. Here the symmetries of the electron-phonon interaction for <b>silicon</b> and <b>germanium</b> are identified {{and the resulting}} spin lifetimes are calculated. Room-temperature spin lifetimes of electrons in silicon {{are found to be}} comparable to those in gallium arsenide, however, the spin lifetimes in <b>silicon</b> or <b>germanium</b> can be tuned by reducing the valley degeneracy through strain or quantum confinement. The tunable range is limited to slightly over an order of magnitude by intravalley processes. Comment: 7 pages, 3 figures, 13 table...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{reviews the}} {{polyanionic}} hexagons of <b>silicon</b> and <b>germanium,</b> focusing on aromaticity. The chair-like structures of hexasila- and hexagermabenzene {{are similar to}} a nonaromatic cyclohexane (CH 2) 6 and dissimilar to aromatic D 6 h-symmetric benzene (CH) 6, although <b>silicon</b> and <b>germanium</b> {{are in the same}} group of the periodic table as carbon. Recently, six-membered <b>silicon</b> and <b>germanium</b> rings with extra electrons instead of conventional substituents, such as alkyl, aryl, etc., were calculated by us to have D 6 h symmetry and to be aromatic. We summarize here our main findings and the background needed to reach them, and propose a synthetically accessible molecule...|$|R

5|$|Several {{authors have}} {{commented on the}} {{metallic}} nature {{of some of the}} properties of astatine. Since iodine is a semiconductor in the direction of its planes, and since the halogens become more metallic with increasing atomic number, it has been presumed that astatine would be a metal if it could form a condensed phase. Astatine may be metallic in the liquid state on the basis that elements with an enthalpy of vaporization (∆Hvap) greater than ~42 kJ/mol are metallic when liquid. Such elements include boron, <b>silicon,</b> <b>germanium,</b> antimony, selenium and tellurium. Estimated values for ∆Hvap of diatomic astatine are 50 kJ/mol or higher; diatomic iodine, with a ∆Hvap of 41.71, falls just short of the threshold figure.|$|E
5|$|Boron is {{a useful}} dopant for such {{semiconductors}} as <b>silicon,</b> <b>germanium,</b> and silicon carbide. Having one fewer valence electron than the host atom, it donates a hole resulting in p-type conductivity. Traditional method of introducing boron into semiconductors is via its atomic diffusion at high temperatures. This process uses either solid (B2O3), liquid (BBr3), or gaseous boron sources (B2H6 or BF3). However, after the 1970s, it was mostly replaced by ion implantation, which relies mostly on BF3 as a boron source. Boron trichloride gas {{is also an important}} chemical in semiconductor industry, however not for doping but rather for plasma etching of metals and their oxides. Triethylborane is also injected into vapor deposition reactors as a boron source. Examples are the plasma deposition of boron-containing hard carbon films, silicon nitride-boron nitride films, and for doping of diamond film with boron.|$|E
25|$|For {{soldering}} semiconductor materials, e.g. {{die attachment}} of <b>silicon,</b> <b>germanium</b> and gallium arsenide, {{it is important}} that the solder contains no impurities that could cause doping in the wrong direction. For soldering n-type semiconductors, solder may be doped with antimony; indium may be added for soldering p-type semiconductors. Pure tin and pure gold can be used.|$|E
30|$|It {{has been}} {{recently}} shown[1] that <b>silicon</b> and <b>germanium</b> nanowires {{can give a}} figure of merit of over 2 at 800 K due to strong reduction of phonon thermal conductivity in nanowires as compared with their equivalent bulk material, i.e., the reduction is caused {{not only by the}} alloy disorder, but also by the decrease of the phonon mean free path by reduced-dimensional effects. The effect of temperature on the thermal conductivity of <b>silicon</b> and <b>germanium</b> may be quite different since the Debye temperature of silicon almost doubles that of germanium. The purpose of the present work is to analyze quantum statistic effects on thermal phonon conductivity in <b>silicon</b> and <b>germanium</b> nanoribbons {{with the use of the}} novel semiquantum molecular dynamics simulation[2].|$|R
40|$|The force {{interactions}} of <b>silicon</b> and <b>germanium</b> nanowires with gold electrodes were analyzed. The current voltage data showed linear behavior between gold electrode and silicon nanowires but for germanium nanowires, they were {{point of contact}} dependant. It was found that TEM-STM demonstrated bistable <b>silicon</b> and <b>germanium</b> nanowire based nanoelectromechanical programable read-only memory (NEMPROM) devices. Analysis shows that the devices exhibited low switching potential and high stability, that made them ideal low-leakage electronic devices...|$|R
50|$|The carbon {{group is}} a {{periodic}} table group consisting of carbon (C), <b>silicon</b> (Si), <b>germanium</b> (Ge), tin (Sn), lead (Pb), and flerovium (Fl).|$|R
25|$|Which {{elements}} {{start to}} be counted as post-transition metals depends, in periodic table terms, on where the transition metals are taken to end. In the 1950s, most inorganic chemistry textbooks defined transition elements as finishing at group 10 (nickel, palladium and platinum), therefore excluding group 11 (copper, silver and gold), and group 12 (zinc, cadmium and mercury). A survey of chemistry books in 2003 showed that the transition metals ended at either group 11 or group 12 with roughly equal frequency. Where the post-transition metals end depends on where the metalloids or nonmetals start. Boron, <b>silicon,</b> <b>germanium,</b> arsenic, antimony and tellurium are commonly recognised as metalloids; other authors treat {{some or all of}} these elements as nonmetals.|$|E
25|$|In modern use, {{the term}} 'semimetal' {{sometimes}} refers, loosely or explicitly, to metals with incomplete metallic character in crystalline structure, electrical conductivity or electronic structure. Examples include gallium, ytterbium, bismuth, mercury and neptunium.α-Np is a semimetal, in which covalency effects {{are believed to}} also be of importance...For a semimetal having strong covalent bonding, like α-Np...' Metalloids, which are in-between elements that are neither metals nor nonmetals, are also sometimes instead called semimetals. The elements commonly recognised as metalloids are boron, <b>silicon,</b> <b>germanium,</b> arsenic, antimony and tellurium. In old chemistry, before the publication in 1789 of Lavoisier's 'revolutionary' Elementary Treatise on Chemistry, a semimetal was a metallic element with 'very imperfect ductility and malleability' such as zinc, mercury or bismuth.|$|E
500|$|Writing {{early in}} the history of {{intermetallic}} compounds, the British metallurgist Cecil Desch observed that [...] "certain non-metallic elements are capable of forming compounds of distinctly metallic character with metals, and these elements may therefore enter into the composition of alloys". He associated silicon, arsenic and tellurium, in particular, with the alloy-forming elements. Phillips and Williams suggested that compounds of <b>silicon,</b> <b>germanium,</b> arsenic and antimony with B metals, [...] "are probably best classed as alloys".|$|E
50|$|Other {{substances}} that expand on freezing are acetic acid, <b>silicon,</b> gallium, <b>germanium,</b> bismuth, plutonium and also chemical compounds that form spacious crystal lattices with tetrahedral coordination.|$|R
40|$|Friction {{and wear}} {{experiments}} {{were conducted with}} ion plated films of <b>germanium</b> and <b>silicon</b> {{on the surface of}} 52100 bearing steel both dry and in the presence of mineral oil. Both <b>silicon</b> and <b>germanium</b> were found to reduce wear, with germanium being more effective than silicon. An optimum film thickness of germanium for minimum wear without surface crack formation was found to be approximately 400 nanometers (4000 A). The presence of <b>silicon</b> and <b>germanium</b> on the 52100 bearing steel surface improved resistance to oxidation...|$|R

500|$|When the {{alkali metals}} react with the heavier {{elements}} in the carbon group (<b>silicon,</b> <b>germanium,</b> tin, and lead), ionic substances with cage-like structures are formed, such as the silicides M4Si4 (M = K, Rb, or Cs), which contains M+ and tetrahedral [...] ions. The chemistry of alkali metal germanides, involving the germanide ion Ge4− and other cluster (Zintl) ions such as , , , and 6−, is largely analogous {{to that of the}} corresponding silicides. Alkali metal stannides are mostly ionic, sometimes with the stannide ion (Sn4−), and sometimes with more complex Zintl ions such as , which appears in tetrapotassium nonastannide (K4Sn9). The monatomic plumbide ion (Pb4−) is unknown, and indeed its formation is predicted to be energetically unfavourable; alkali metal plumbides have complex Zintl ions, such as [...] These alkali metal germanides, stannides, and plumbides may be produced by reducing germanium, tin, and lead with sodium metal in liquid ammonia.|$|E
500|$|Flerovium is {{a member}} of group 14 in the {{periodic}} table, below carbon, <b>silicon,</b> <b>germanium,</b> tin, and lead. Every previous group 14 element has four electrons in its valence shell, forming a valence electron configuration of ns2np2. In flerovium's case, the trend will be continued and the valence electron configuration is predicted to be 7s27p2; flerovium will behave similarly to its lighter congeners in many respects. Differences are likely to arise; a largely contributing effect is the spin–orbit (SO) interaction—the mutual interaction between the electrons' motion and spin. It is especially strong for the superheavy elements, because their electrons move faster than in lighter atoms, at velocities comparable to the speed of light. In relation to flerovium atoms, it lowers the 7s and the 7p electron energy levels (stabilizing the corresponding electrons), but two of the 7p electron energy levels are stabilized more than the other four. The stabilization of the 7s electrons is called the inert pair effect, and the effect [...] "tearing" [...] the 7p subshell into the more stabilized and the less stabilized parts is called subshell splitting. Computation chemists see the split as a change of the second (azimuthal) quantum number l from 1 to [...] and [...] for the more stabilized and less stabilized parts of the 7p subshell, respectively. For many theoretical purposes, the valence electron configuration may be represented to reflect the 7p subshell split as 7s7p. These effects cause flerovium's chemistry to be somewhat different from that of its lighter neighbours.|$|E
2500|$|Using {{electricity}} {{produced by}} photovoltaic systems offers the cleanest way to produce hydrogen. [...] Water is broken into {{hydrogen and oxygen}} by electrolysis—a photoelectrochemical cell (PEC) process which is also named artificial photosynthesis. William Ayers at Energy Conversion Devices demonstrated and patented the first multijunction high efficiency photoelectrochemical system for direct splitting of water in 1983. This group demonstrated direct water splitting now referred to as an [...] "artificial leaf" [...] or [...] "wireless solar water splitting" [...] with a low cost thin film amorphous silicon multijunction sheet immersed directly in water. Hydrogen evolved on the front amorphous silcon surface decorated with various catalysts while oxygen evolved off the back metal substrate. A Nafion membrane above the multijunction cell provided a path for ion transport. Their patent also lists {{a variety of other}} semiconductor multijunction materials for the direct water splitting in addition to amorphous silicon and <b>silicon</b> <b>germanium</b> [...] alloys. [...] Research continues towards developing high-efficiency multi-junction cell technology at universities and the photovoltaic industry. [...] If this process is assisted by photocatalysts suspended directly in water instead of using photovoltaic and an electrolytic system, the reaction is in just one step, which can improve efficiency.|$|E
