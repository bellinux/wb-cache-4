50|$|The K-1 was {{equipped}} with GM 1 nitrous oxide boost, which increased the K-1s maximum speed by 84 km/h at 8,000 m {{at a rate of}} 100 g/s. With 50 g/s the aircraft's operational ceiling could be extended from 8,400 to 9,800 metres. Failure rates of the GM 1 were very high and attention was shifting to other Do 217 variants and the use of GM 1 soon stopped. Serious shortages of the BMW 801 led to the cancellation of the K series but tests with BMW 801ML Motoranlage unitized-mount format radial engines, added a supplementary command unit to the usual 801 Kommandogerät engine control unit for each radial, which could engage the booster <b>switch,</b> <b>ignition</b> timing and the weak-rich mixture control automatically, which made the 801L powerplants easy to operate. Oil pressures also triggered operation of the VDM propellers, which on the K-1 subtype were 3.9 m in diameter. A smaller, 3.8 meter diameter wood-bladed propeller could be used as an alternative, though with a slight loss of speed. The standard 2,165-litre fuel tank could be supplemented by two fuselage tanks with 700-litre capacity or with either the standardized Luftwaffe 300 litre drop tank used on many German front-line military aircraft or fin-stabilized 900 litre drop tank as the Bf 110D used. An all-up-weight of 15 to 16.5 tonnes could be expected. The K-1 would need some 850 to 1,110 m to get airborne. Taking off from a grass strip, an altitude of 20 m was reached after 1,500 m and from a concrete runway it was 1,300. With two auxiliary tanks its speed dropped by 4.5 percent, and with bombs, by 6 percent. Flame-damper equipment also caused serious speed reductions; 7 percent in level flight and 9 percent when at operational ceiling.|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} the high mixture ratio {{qualification}} testing of the RL 10 engine for the Shuttle/Centaur program are presented. The objective of the engine qualification test was to demonstrate the suitability of the RL 10 A- 3 - 3 B engine for space vehicle flight by subjecting it to the testing specified in RL 10 A- 3 - 3 B Model Specification Number 2295 dated February 1986. The applicable section of the specification is presented. Due to payload volume advantages which {{can be achieved by}} increasing the operating mixture ratio of the RL 10, a decision was made to qualify the engine to run at a higher mixture ratio. A program was created to qualify the RL 10 engine for operation at 15, 000 pounds thrust and a nominal 6. 0 to 1 mixture ratio. This model of the engine was designated the RL 10 A- 3 - 3 B. The qualification program included three test series as follows: (1) hardware durability and limits test in which the engine completed 23 firings and 4605. 7 seconds with 1588. 7 seconds at less than 6. 6 mixture ratio; (2) preliminary qualification test in which the engine completed 26 firings and 5750 seconds; and (3) qualification test in which the engine completed 26 hot firings and 5693. 4 seconds with 905. 9 seconds at 6. 7 mixture ratio. Several changes in engine hardware were required for operation of the RL 10 A- 3 - 3 B engine in the Space Shuttle which include a duel pressure <b>switch</b> <b>ignition,</b> an oxidizer flow control, and helium plumbing changes...|$|E

50|$|An idle {{starter solenoid}} can receive a large {{electric}} current {{from the car}} battery and a small electric current from the <b>ignition</b> <b>switch.</b> When the <b>ignition</b> <b>switch</b> is turned on, a small electric current is sent through the starter solenoid.

The starter solenoid receives a large electric current from the car battery and a small electric current from the <b>ignition</b> <b>switch.</b> When the <b>ignition</b> <b>switch</b> is turned on (i.e. when the key is turned to start the car), the small electric current forces the starter solenoid to close a pair of heavy contacts, thus relaying the large electric current to the starter motor.|$|R

5000|$|With a Thermostart plug in {{the inlet}} manifold, {{within a few}} seconds diesel vapours start to fill the inlet manifold. As the plug {{continues}} to heat up, it opens a valve permitting diesel from a special reservoir mounted directly above the Thermostart into the Thermostart plug. This fresh diesel is also vaporised and adds {{to that in the}} inlet manifold. At 20 seconds, provided air is available, the diesel near the plug ignites and as the engine is cranked, the ignited diesel is drawn into the combustion chambers - to which more diesel is added after the compression stroke. This additional diesel immediately ignites, starting the engine with ease. Vehicles fitted with Thermostart glow plugs do not usually activate via the normal <b>ignition</b> <b>switch.</b> A button elsewhere is provided (along with, in some cases, the button to activate the starting motor). Where a Thermostart is activated by the same <b>switch</b> as the <b>ignition,</b> it is usually activated by turning the switch one 'notch' counter-clockwise. After the 20 second period has elapsed, cranking is achieved by turning the <b>ignition</b> <b>switch</b> a further notch counter-clockwise.
