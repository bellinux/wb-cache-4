40|$|Introduction: To {{investigate}} {{levels of}} antiovarian autoantibodies in girls {{and young women}} with disturbances of menstrual cycle before and during treatment with hormonal therapy. Menopause usually occurs approximately {{at the age of}} 50. Premature ovarian failure (POF) is a disorder defined as a pathologic termination of menstrual cycle after puberty and before the age of 40. Frequency of this disorder is approximately 1 %. Hormonal levels show hypergonadotrophic hypoestrism (FSH more than 40 IU/l). The onset of the disease may be very slow. Menarche and regular menstrual cycles may be followed by menstrual cycle disorders - oligomenorrhoea or <b>secondary</b> amenorrhoea. <b>Sterility</b> or infertility at the reproductive age could be manifestations of the early stage of the disease. One of the possible causes of premature ovarian failure could be an autoimmune process beginning {{at any time during the}} reproductive period. Autoimmune damage of the ovarian hormonal production places this disease between the autoimmune endocrinopathies, characterized by direct destruction of the target cells, such as thyroiditis, insulin dependent diabetes and Addison’s disease. Material and methods: Studied group included 39 patients. 18 patients were treated for primary amenorrhoea, 21 for menstrual cycle disorders. Patients included in the study were repeatedly examined at the beginning of the study and after six months during which they were treated by estrogen and gestagen. In all patients we have tested FSH, LH and FSH/LH ratio, presence of antiovarian antibodies. Results were compared with those obtained in control women. 21 antiovarian antibodies positive patients were indicated for laparoscopic biopsy. Biopticsample was examined using light and electron microscopy. Results: Our treatment with hormonal therapy lead to the reduction of ovarian antigens. In 85 % of the cases marked decrease of antiovarian autoantibodies levels was observed, while in 28 % of the cases the levels were undetectable. From morphological changes of the bioptic sample enhanced atresia of follicules at different developmental stages was frequently observed. It evoked marked reduction of follicular apparatus up to its complete disappearing. Conclusion: The results of our study and mapping of the antiovarian antibodies positivity support our hypothesis that the antiovarian antibodies positivity corresponds with the clinical symptoms. Appropriate treatment with hormonal replacement therapy minimizes ovarian destruction, preserves ovarian hormonal functions and saves healthy ovarian tissue necessary for future fertility.

To explain morphological changes in ovarian structure in these patients. Menopause usually occurs approximately {{at the age of}} 50. Premature ovarian failure (POF) is a disorder defined as a pathologic termination of menstrual cycle after puberty and before the age of 40. Frequency of this disorder is approximately 1 %.

40|$|We {{developed}} an ELISA {{system for the}} detection of human anti-ovarian antibodies. Bovine corpora lutea were extracted in PBS (pH 7. 2) and fractionated by ultracentrifugation. Both the soluble fraction obtained after 80, 000 g (S 80) and the Triton-extracted membrane fraction (ST 288) were used as antigens. Additionally, the luteinizing hormone (LH) /human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) receptor was isolated by affinity chromatography (wheat germ agglutinin and LH-Sepharose) and also used as an antigen. In 7 of 14 patients with primary sterility and endometriosis a positive reaction was observed. Similarly, 6 of 16 patients with <b>secondary</b> <b>sterility</b> and endometriosis were also positive. Patients being stimulated for in vitro fertilization and presenting either primary or <b>secondary</b> <b>sterility</b> were positive in 5 of 22 and 6 of 16 cases, respectively. In the S 80 test 41 of 60 sera presented IgG 2 antibodies, whereas in the ST 288 test 38 of 60 belonged to the IgG 1 subclass. Kappa and lambda chains were equally distributed. Some patients could recognize the unoccupied LH/hCG receptor as an antigen, while others recognized only the complex formed by the hormone plus the hormone receptor. The S 80 and ST 288 antigens were isolated by affinity chromatography. Gel permeation of the purified antigens revealed in each case the presence of an antigen complex.

40|$|Background. Hysterosalpingography (HSG) and {{diagnostic}} laparoscopy with chromopertubation are two {{widely used}} diagnosic methods to determine tubal function in infertile women. The diagnostic value of HSG and laparoscopy {{is still a}} matter for much debate. In the retrospective analyses we wanted to evaluate the HSG and laparoscopy as diagnostic and therapeutic procedure in the infertile patients. Materials and methods. Three hundreds and sixty two patients treated at University Department of Obstetry and Gynecology in Ljubljana because of infertility were analysed in the year 2000 and 2001.  Laparoscopy was done in all 362 patients and HSG before the laparoscopy was done in 185 patients. Results. The laparoscopy was done in 215 patients because of primary sterility and in 147 patients because of <b>secondary</b> <b>sterility.</b> The patology was found in 79 % of the patients (myomas in 8 %, polycystic ovaries (PCO) in 19 %, endometriosis in 27 %, tubo-ovarian adhesions in 46 %).

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} regional fertility {{patterns in}} Kenya since 1989 {{using data from}} the four Demographic and Health Surveys of 1989, 1993, 1998 and 2003, and a consistent set of 21 regions. The impacts of late and non-marriage, contraceptive use, sterility and postpartum non-susceptibility on fertility in each region are quantified using the model of the proximate determinants of fertility developed by John Bongaarts. The model is modified to take account of the impact of non-marital childbearing and <b>secondary</b> <b>sterility.</b> Substantial and persistent regional differentials in fertility are identified. Generally, fertility is lowest in urban areas and in rural areas in the centre of the country. It is higher in both coastal and western areas. The pattern of increasing contraceptive use and a rising age at marriage offsetting the impact of shorter durations of breastfeeding as modernisation progresses is only found in a small number of regions in Central and Eastern Provinces, and in Nairobi. Elsewhere a variety of demographic regimes is observed, some associated with fertility decline, others associated with constant or even increasing fertility. There are differences between the experiences of Nairobi and Mombasa, the two largest urban areas, with Mombasa’s low fertility being associated with none of the major proximate determinants...|$|E

The reports examined have been further classified into incompelete abortion, diagnostic currettage and others. A total number of 645 women have had D&amp;C according to the above criteria. In this period of time, incomplete abortion had the highest rate (34 % of all D&amp;C's), of which 62. 5 % were under 20 years of age and 22. 6 % were primigravida. The ratio of total abortion to the number of deliveries was 9. 8 % and post-delivery retention of placenta constituted 4. 8 % of all D&amp;C's, with the highest rate amongst the age group of 15 - 19 years old, who mostly had home deliveries. The incidence of hydatidiform mole was 3. 07 per 1000 deliveries, out of this number, the highest rate (50 %) belonged to the age group of 20 - 24 years old. The above incidence is 6. 4 times more than the U. S. incidence and 0. 9 times less than the incidence reported in other Asian countries (6, 8, 10).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Hyperhomocysteinemia {{has been}} {{described}} as a risk factor for unexplained recurrent pregnancy loss. Increased levels of homocysteine may be due to inadequate dietary intake of folate and vitamin B 12 and inherited defects within the methionine-homocysteine pathway such as MTHFR C 677 T gene polymorphism. However, the association between hyperhomocysteinemia and sterility problems have been underlined only for recurrent pregnancy loss while a relationship between hyperhomocysteinemia and female sterility is still matter of discussion. AIM: This study sought to find out a possible relationship between sterility (primary sterility or <b>secondary</b> <b>sterility</b> due to recurrent pregnancy loss) and homocysteine metabolism. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We selected 20 patients with recurrent pregnancy loss, 20 patients with unexplained female sterility and 20 healthy women as control group. Several whole blood samples were collected by venipuncture. Firstly homocysteinemia and other related variables were tested (i. e. folate and vitamin B 12 levels); thereafter DNA was extracted by a further whole blood sample collected in EDTA in order to screen MTHFR C 677 T gene polymorphism. Statistical analysis was performed by chi square test; differences were considered to be significant if p 15 microM) and MTHFR C 677 T homozigosity have already been described as risk factors for recurrent pregnancy loss, few studies evaluated their role in women with unexplained sterility.

Study Variables : Mother&#x 00 E 2;&#x 20 AC;s age, parity, inter- pregnancy interval, socio-economic status, literacy status, antenatal care. Outcome Variable: Birth weight of the Infant. Statistical Analysis: Chi square test. Results: The proportion of low birth weight babies was high in teenage mothers(41. 9 &#x 0025;) and those {{over the age of}} 30 years. Primi and grand multiparity were associated with higher prevalence of low birth weight babies (43. 2 &#x 0025; & 43. 9 &#x 0025; respectively).

40|$|It {{has been}} {{the aim of this}} work to examine the ability of human fertilized eggs in the {{pronucleus}} state to develop and implant under different clinical and methodical conditions. (patients age, cause of steril-ity, primary or <b>secondary</b> <b>sterility,</b> stimulation regimes, method of fertilization, duration of cryopreserva-tion, number and developmental stage of embryos transferred). Patients with primary sterility conceived significantly less (7, 5 %) than those with <b>secondary</b> <b>sterility</b> (15, 2 %). Patients, who had already been pregnant once by artificial reproduction techniques (ART as IVF or ICSI) had also a higher chance to conceive once more by another ART (15, 4 %). The age of the women up to 40 years was of no significance concerning the fertilization- and preg-nancy-rate. Looking on the reasons for sterility, the “idiopathic” was the most promising (pregnancy rate 14, 9 %) but there were only minor differences between male, female, organic and functional causes. When both genders exhibited reasons for infertility, the pregnancy rate decreased to 6, 7 %. The different agents used for stimulation in the egg- sampling cycle showed differences to some ex-tend, namely 55, 6 % after HMG- stimulation in contrast to 63, 1 % after FSH stimulation. The survival rate after thawing the PN-cells was lower after HMG stimulation (60, 2 %) than after FSH stimulation (67, 7 %). Otherwise the pregnancy rate did not show remarkable differences (9, 6 % bzw. 10, 8 %). The pre-treatment of the cryotransfer cycle was very decisive, as the cryotransfer in the unmedicated spontaneous cycle was the most successful with a pregnancy-rate of 15, 7 %. The stimulation with Clomipene-Citrate as well as low-dose Gonadotrophin application was also rather successful (14, 3 %) but the transfer in an artificial cycle, that is stimulation of endometrial development by estradiolvalerate and progesterone, lead to only a low pregnancy rate (8, 6 %). The pregnancy rate increased twice (6, 6 % to 13, 2 %) with the number of transferred embryos (1 to 3) in the same effect showed the increasing developmental stage of the embryos (PN-cells 4, 3 % 4 -cells 12, 8 %). The arithmetical consideration of both factors together lead to the fifefold increase of the pregnancy rate from one PN-cell-stage (4, 3 %) to three 4 -cell stages (23, 1 %). The freezing time, that means the duration of deep-freezing the impregnated egg cells in the pronu-cleus state before the transfer, did not influence the survival rate of the thawed cells remarkably (71, 2 % up to 3 month, 66, 7 % over 4 years) and did not influence the pregnancy rate. Fertilization by ICSI after cryokonservation lead to fewer pregnancies than IVF (8, 0 % vs. 12, 9 %), but was very similar in the primary transfer (22, 1 % vs. 26, 7 %). The over all pregnancy rate was higher in the “primary transfer” of fresh collected fertilized eggs and cultured embryos (24, 1 %) than after cryokonservation (10, 4 %), a result, that is in good accordance with time corresponding publications (1997 – 2004) ...|$|E

All patients have passed the standard examination. According to data of sonographic hydrotubation in 1 group the double-sided uterine tubes patency was observed in 28 %(84, 85 + 6, 24), in 2 group in 20 % (76, 92 + 8, 26), in 3 group 29 %(74, 36 + 6, 99) of cases.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the cause of female sterility author practiced the hysterosalpingography. The object was limitted those 461 cases of patients, visitted our clinic within these 4 years and six months, complaining their sterility of 2 years and more. Firstly, their age, the period of sterility, menstrual condition, inner examination findings were examind. As a result author got the following facts. 1) Recently, most women have become much concerned about sterility. 2) It seems meaningless to infer sterility from menstrual condition. 3) Judging from {{the findings of the}} inner examination, HYPOPLASIA UTERI, the abnormal uterine position and abnormal adnexa are the important sterile factors. Secondarily, author learned these following facts through the hysterosalpingography. 1) In the findings of the hysterography, there are many HYPOPLASIA UTERI and abnormal uterine position, as seen in the findings of the inner examination, and the former is an important factor of the primary sterility. 2) In the findings of the salpingography, there can be fonnd 38 % of closing of Fallopian tubes on both sides, and most of them occur at the AMPULLA TUBAE. This tendency appears in both primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>sterility.</b> 3) The passage of the Fallopian tubes of these patients, having past anamnesises of peritonitis, tuberculosis, and laparotomy operation, is not good and each has the percentage of 88 63, and 44 of closing on both sides. Thirdly, among 461 patients who were given the hysterosalpingography 47 cases (10. 2 %) have got the completion of pregnancy. Through this investigation, author recognized that our hysterosalpingography is not only necessary as a way to seek after the cause of the female sterility, but also effectual for its treatment...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} the diagnostic effectiveness of combined hysterosalpingography (HSG) and sonohysterography (SHG) {{in the study}} of infertile women. Materials and Methods: 208 women affected by primary (184) or <b>secondary</b> <b>sterility</b> (24) were divided in two random groups. Group 1 underwent only HSG and group 2 underwent simultaneous HSG and SHG. The results obtained in the two groups were correlated with the results of hysteroscopy or laparoscopy, considered Gold Standard. Sensitivity, specificity, positive (PPV) and negative (NPV) predictive values and likelihood ratio (LR) of HSG alone and combined HSG/SHG were calculated. Results were evaluated with t-test, Pearson's Chi square or Fisher exact test when appropriate and ROC analysis. Results: In group 1, hysteroscopy revealed no pathology in the uterine cavity in 70 / 104 patients, but evidenced 47 abnormalities related to the uterine cavity in 34 women. HSG outcome was in accordance with hysteroscopy in 27 / 34 cases of abnormalities, and in 64 / 70 cases of normal outcome. Sensitivity 0. 79, specificity 0. 91, PPV 0. 82, NPV 0. 90, LR+ 9. 26. In group 2, hysteroscopy revealed no pathology in the uterine cavity in 64 / 104 patients but 52 abnormalities related to the uterine cavity in 40 women. HSG and SHG outcomes were confirmed by hysteroscopy in 39 / 40 cases of abnormalities of the uterine cavity and in 60164 cases of normal uterine cavity. Sensitivity 0. 97, specificity 0. 94, PPV 0. 91, NPV 0. 98, LR+ 15. 60. Statistical analysis showed that combined HSG and SHG yielded elevated specificity and LR+ and therefore few cases of false positive outcome. Conclusion: Combined performance of HSG and SHG can shorten diagnostic investigation time and reduce the discomfort to the patient as the injector is fed into the cervix only once. This may also reduce the patient's anxiety level as one of the Causes of infertility...|$|E

During the surgical procedure surgeons were asked to examine the pelvis carefully to identify endometriosis. Out of the 660 women included for sterility, 195 [30 %, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 26 - 35] had endometriosis; the corresponding figures were 185 out of 409 (45 %, 95 % CI 39 - 52) for pelvic pain, 219 out of 1880 (12 %, 95 % CI 10 - 14) for fibroids and 257 out of 735 (35 %, 95 % CI 31 - 40) for ovarian cysts; these differences were significant (x(3) (2) heterogeneity, absence versus presence = 323. 9, P < 0. 001). Among women with endometriosis who entered the study for sterility, 51 % were at stage 1, 22 % at stage 2, 20 % at stage 3 and 7 % at stage 4. The corresponding figures for pelvic pain and fibroids were largely similar: 37 %, 24 %, 30 %, 10 % for women with pelvic pain, 36 %, 11 %, 45 % and 8 % for those with fibroids, but among cases with ovarian cysts stage 3 was over-represented (62 % of cases). The most common sites of endometriosis were, in order of frequency, the ovaries considered together, the posterior cul de sac and uterosacral ligaments. Endometriotic implants were more common on the uterosacral ligaments and the posterior cul de sac among women with sterility and pelvic pain than in those with fibroids and ovarian cysts. The frequency of endometriosis was not directly related to age at surgery, but decreased with increasing parity in all the four criteria for entry groups...|$|E
40|$|Background. The polycystic ovary {{syndrome}} (PCOS) is {{the most}} frequent form of endocrine pathology and occurs in 5 – 10 % women of reproductive age and makes up 80 %, and according to some data, even 90 % {{of all forms of}} hyperandrogenism. The information about pathogenesis of PCOS is contradictory. The main step of the SPCO pathogenesis is hyperproduction of LH of by the hypophysis, revealed in 40 – 80 % patients. According to one of numerous theories, an increase secretion results in the increase of LH by the hypothalamus of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GRH), secreted in the discrete mode under control sexual steroid hormones, monoamines and opioid peptides. The aim of the investigation is to study the functional status of hypophysis — gonads axis for women with SPCO. Material and methods. In the department of neuroendocrinology of the Center of Endocrinology of Health Ministry of the Republic of Uzbekistan in a period from September 2015 till July 2016 [*] 120 outpatients of fertile age with PCOS were inspected. Mean age of patients was 25. 5 ± 4. 3 years. The duration of the disease hesitated from 7 months to 9 years. 20 healthy women of corresponding age made a control group. The complex of researches, including clinical, biochemical (glycemia, glucose tolerance test), hormonal (LH, FSH, prolactin, estradiol, progesterone, dehydroepiandrostendion (ДGEA), 17 -oxyprogesterone, аntimuller hormone (АМH), insulin) was performed in all patients, ultrasonic examination of uterus and ovaries (transabdominal and transvaginal) on the 14 th day of cycle with folliculometria in dynamics, and also magnetically-resonant tomography of hypophysis and questionnaire of patients were carried out. Results. Patients were divided into two groups: with primary sterility (94 cases) and with <b>secondary</b> <b>sterility</b> (26 cases). In the first group of patients with primary sterility the reliable decline of both pituitary and ovarian hormones was determined on a background of hyperandrogenemia and hyperprolactinemia. So, as compared to the group of control on the 14 th day of cycle LH, FSH, and estradiol, progesterone, while free testosterone, DGEA were enhanced as compared to control data. In the second group of patients the reliable decline of pituitary hormones was also educed on a background of hyperandrogenemia and hyperprolactinemia while an ovarian function was within the normal limits. So, as compared to the group of control on the 14 th day of cycle the LH, FSH, here free testosterone, DGEA and АМH levels were enhanced as compared to control data. The neuroimaging of hypophysis in patients with PCOS educed hyperplasia (adenomatosis) of hypophysis in 49 from 120 (40. 8 %), that can be explained by ovarian insufficiency in these patients. On the second place by incidence there was the syndrome of the empty sella (26 cases, 21. 6 %), and on the third — the microadenoma of hypophysis in 16 persons (13. 3 %). Conclusions. In the first group of patients with primary sterility the reliable decline of both pituitary and ovarian hormones was marked on a background of hyperandrogenemia and hyperprolactinemia. In the second group of patients the significant decline of pituitary hormones was also educed on a background of hyperanrogenemia and hyperprolactinemia, while an ovarian function was within the normal limits. In both groups of patients hypogonadotropinemia occurred combined with moderate hyperprolactinemia and hyperandrogenemia. Thus, the most expressed violations of the system of pituitary — ovarian function were found out in the first group of patients with PCOS with primary sterility, at that the significant decline of the functional status of pituitary — gonads axis was marked, namely decline of LH, FSH, estradiol and progesterone levels on the 14 th day of menstrual cycle, that was confirmed by ultrasouns examination of uterus and ovaries by impoverishment of follicle vehicle of ovaries, anovulation signs. Thus, the most expressed violations of the system of pituitary-ovarial function were found out in the first group of patients with PCOS with primary sterility, at that the significant decline of the functional state of hypophysis-gonads was marked, namely decline of LH, FSH, estradiol and progesterone levels that was confirmed by ultrasound investigation of uterus and ovaries...|$|E
