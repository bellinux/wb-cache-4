40|$|Toothed gear power {{transmissions}} {{are complex}} mechanical systems and their design {{is a very}} challenging engineering task that requires the application of common calculation procedures and contemporary designing methods. Operating conditions of the gear power transmission are important for the design process from the aspect of overload prediction and they are defined within the design process by the operating condition factor KA, which has {{a wide range of}} values (1 to 2. 5), prescribing various operating situations. However, a good design of the toothed gear power transmission can be achieved if operating conditions are simulated and as such implemented in the calculation/design procedure. Such improvement in the design process can be done with the use of defined load spectra that accurately describe realistic operating conditions. The paper presents the results of tensiometric measurements of torque at the output shaft of the working wheel gearbox of the bucket wheel excavator SRs 1300 TAKRAF in the coal strip mine Drmno, and gives a definition of appropriate load spectra based on these tensiometric measurements. The load spectra are defined by applying the full cycle discretization method and as such afterwards used for the calculations/design of the working wheel of the bucket wheel excavator (gears, <b>shafts,</b> <b>shaft</b> <b>keys</b> etc.) ...|$|R

A self-powered sensor {{placed in a}} duct and powered by an electromechanical generator scavenging energy from the airflow has been designed and tested. It periodically transmits the measured air {{temperature and}} velocity to a receiving unit. The system basically consists of two macroblocks, respectively: the self-power wireless sensor and the receiving unit. The self-powered sensor has a section devoted to the energy harvesting, exploiting the movement of an airscrew <b>shaft</b> <b>keyed</b> to a dc motor. The self-powered sensor adopts integrated devices in low-power technology, including a microcontroller, an integrated temperature sensor, and a radio-frequency transmitter at 433 MHz. The data transmission is realized in Manchester encoding, with amplitude-shift-keying modulation at 433 MHz, allowing covering a distance between the sensor and the reader {{on the order of}} 4 - 5 m, depending on the power supplied in transmission.

As the wave generator plug rotates, the flex spline teeth which are meshed {{with those of}} the circular spline slowly change position. The major axis of the flex spline's ellipse rotates with wave generator, so the points where the teeth mesh revolve around the center point {{at the same rate as}} the wave generator's <b>shaft.</b> The <b>key</b> to the design of the strain wave gear is that there are fewer teeth (often for example two fewer) on the flex spline than there are on the circular spline. This means that for every full rotation of the wave generator, the flex spline would be required to rotate a slight amount (two teeth in this example) backward relative to the circular spline. Thus the rotation action of the wave generator results in a much slower rotation of the flex spline in the opposite direction.|$|R

The shaft can be a single “through” shaft where the motor and gearbox are assembled on, and fixed to, the <b>shaft</b> with <b>keys</b> or pins. However, this type of drum motor design has a limited maximum radial load due to the bending stresses caused by the normal belt tension of a conveyor and is therefore used mainly for small light duty conveyors and loads. For heavier loads the most common design is to use two separate shafts, one fixed to the motor housing and one fixed to the gearbox housing where the mass of metal from the motor and gearbox significantly increases {{the strength of the}} drum motor allowing much higher payloads and longer conveyor applications. Typically one shaft is short (stub shaft) with a consistent length and the other increases in length according to the drum shell or belt width. Over certain widths, the shaft can be further reinforced to prevent bending under high belt tension.|$|R

Under combined rotating bending and torsion the situation is unclear, especially in presence of notches. In this paper the effect of a static and intermittent shear stress on the fatigue strength of two quenched and tempered steel grades, 30 NiCrMo 8 and 42 CrMo 4, is studied on notched specimens with bending theoretical stress concentration factors Kt = 1. 7 and Kt= 2. 7.

This mechanism differs somewhat from mechanisms used in conventional friction stir welding, as described below. The tooling needed to apply the large reaction loads in conventional friction stir welding can be complex. Self-reacted friction stir welding has become popular in the solid-state welding community as a means of reducing the complexity of tooling and to reduce costs. The main problems inherent in self-reacted friction stir welding originate in the high stresses encountered by the pin-and-shoulder assembly that produces the weld.

40|$|Abstract: Misalignment and {{unbalance}} is {{the most}} cause of machine vibration. An unbalanced rotor always cause more vibration and generates excessive force in the bearing area and reduces {{the life of the}} machine. Understanding and practicing the fundamentals of rotating shaft parameters {{is the first step in}} reducing unnecessary vibration, reducing maintenance costs and increasing machine uptime. In this paper, experimental studies were performed on a rotor dynamic test apparatus to predict the vibration spectrum for rotor unbalance. A self-designed simplified 3 pin type flexible coupling was used in the experiments. The rotor shaft accelerations were measured at four different speed using accelerometer and dual channel vibration analyzer (ADASH) under the balance (baseline) and unbalance conditions. The experimental and numerical (ANSYS) frequency spectra were also obtained for both base line and unbalanced condition under different unbalanced forces. The experimental predictions are in good agreement with the ANSYS results.

30|$|The {{operational}} {{principle of}} each can be expounded {{by reference to}} the deep shaft option in Fig.  7 a. This shaft will generally be of circular cross-section and invariant with depth. However, unlike the lagoon alternative (Fig.  5) piston storage achieves the bulk of its gravitational storage, not by shifting water vertically, but by raising a heavier than water piston. This is done by pumping water into the lower cavity of the shaft which is located below the piston (Fig.  7 a). This lifting fluid is extracted from the upper chamber via a pump and penstock to the lower one. Fig.  7 a depicts the discharging phase of the storage system with the turbine/generator powered by the descending piston {{at a time of}} high electricity demand. At low demand the opposite process occurs with electrical power from the grid driving the pump to lift the piston back against gravity {{to the top of the}} shaft, whereupon maximum potential energy is stored. For efficient operation of this system, the quality of the pressure seal between the curved surface of the piston and the lining of the <b>shaft</b> is absolutely <b>key.</b> Arguably, this component is likely to be materially, and mechanically, the main hurdle to successful implementation of the technology.|$|R
40|$|Rotational {{speed of}} a {{reference}} <b>shaft</b> is the <b>key</b> information for planetary gearbox condition monitoring under nonstationary conditions. As the time-variant speed and load of planetary gearboxes result in time-variant characteristic frequencies as well as vibration magnitudes, the conventional methods tracking time-frequency ridge perform a poor robustness, especially for large speed variations. In this paper, two schemes, time-frequency ridge fusion and logarithm transformation, are proposed to track the targeted ridge curve reliably. Meanwhile, the identified ridge curve by logarithm scheme can be further refined by the time-frequency ridge fusion scheme. Hence, a procedure involving the proposed ridge estimation methods is presented to diagnose the planetary gearbox defects. Two simulation signals and a vibration signal collected from a planetary gearbox in practical engineering (provided by the conference on condition monitoring of machinery in nonstationary operations (CMMNO)) are used to verify the proposed methods. It is validated that the proposed methods can well-track the targeted ridge curve compared with two conventional methods. As a result, the characteristic frequency of each component in the planetary gearbox is clearly demonstrated and the inner race defect {{of one of the}} planet bearings is successfully discovered in the order spectrum depending on the derived expression of planet bearing fault frequency...|$|R

Reactive oxygen species have been implicated in hair follicle melanocyte apoptosis and DNA damage. Here we show for the first time by FT-Raman spectroscopy in vivo that human gray/white scalp hair shafts accumulate hydrogen peroxide (H(2) O(2)) in millimolar concentrations. Moreover, we demonstrate almost absent catalase and methionine sulfoxide reductase A and B protein expression via immunofluorescence and Western blot in association with a functional loss of methionine sulfoxide (Met-S=O) repair in the entire gray hair follicle. Accordingly, Met-S=O formation of Met residues, including Met 374 in the active site of tyrosinase, the key enzyme in melanogenesis, limits enzyme functionality, as evidenced by FT-Raman spectroscopy, computer simulation, and enzyme kinetics, which leads to gradual loss of hair color. Notably, under in vitro conditions, Met oxidation can be prevented by L-methionine. In summary, our data feed the long-voiced, but insufficiently proven, concept of H(2) O(2) -induced oxidative damage in the entire human hair follicle, inclusive of the hair <b>shaft,</b> as a <b>key</b> element in senile hair graying, which does not exclusively affect follicle melanocytes.

Ventilation is provided through a rectangular gap at the side wall with varying widths. Gasoline pool fires with diameters up to 0. 46 m are set up {{at the center of}} the floor. Flame height and burning duration of the pool fire are measured. Average flame height ranged from 1 to 4. 5 m when whirling is onsetted in the vertical shaft. Experimental studies indicate that air supply to the upper part of the <b>shaft</b> is a <b>key</b> factor for onsetting internal fire whirls. Oxygen is required to sustain combustion to generate heat for inducing whirling motions. Therefore, flame will not whirl without adequate oxygen supply.

Based on the flame height correlations for free burning pool fires, the fuel consumption rate of the pool fire in the shaft at each stage is estimated.

40|$|The {{presence}} of cracks in {{any type of}} structure is undesirable as they often lead to fracture {{or failure of the}} structure. Marine propeller <b>shaft</b> is a <b>key</b> component in marine propulsion systems; moreover due to the strenuous working conditions, to which it is subjected during its marine operation, it is prone to develop crack(s). The presently available crack detection methods, either require disassembly of the shaft substructure for visual inspection or require external excitation of the relevant portion of the shaft for subsequent dynamic analyses; consequently these methods are quite complex and time consuming. In this study a simpler crack detection method is proposed for crack detection in rotating marine propeller shafts. The crack detection method is based on simple strain and displacement measurements at identified locations and hence easy to execute. The study was carried out using Finite Element Analysis through ABAQUS, a well-known commercial finite element package. The analysis was carried out both for the existence of single bending crack and single circumferential crack, on the body of the rotating shaft component, and the proposed method was able to identify both types of cracks at quite early stages of their growth and development. It was found that if measured at the proper locations, the percentage changes and slopes of percentage changes for these parameters (strain and displacement) changed more rapidly than frequencies, due to the {{presence of}} a crack. Only two measurements were required to get such identification which could be directly related to crack location and size.

40|$|Polygonal shafts {{are a major}} {{competitor}} {{to spline}} and <b>keyed</b> <b>shafts</b> for power transmission due to features as self-centering, lack of stress concentration area, and ease of assembly and disassembly. Past studies on polygonal profiles have focused on a single profile and comparisons based on nominal sizes of three and four lobe profiles. This research explores the loading strength of the standardized three and four lobe polygonal shafts and hubs manufactured from the same stock size, subjected to pure torsional and torsional bending load from a spur gear of 20 ° pressure angle at various fits. In absence of analytical solution, Finite element method has been used after verifying the results experimentally, theoretically, and DIN standard. From the finite element analysis, the hub was found to experience greater stress than the shaft in all cases. The clearance fit {{was found to be}} the most critical connection and interference fit to be the most suitable for larger power transmission. The P 4 C connection had greater stress, especially in the hub, than the P 3 G connection. The difference between the P 4 C shaft and the P 3 G shaft was 4. 05 % in the interference fit and 60. 6 % in the clearance fit, suggesting P 4 C clearance fit to be less favorable for larger power transmission. Owing to its small normal axial stress, the P 4 C clearance fit has its use in low power transmission where sliding fit is a requirement. The reason for greater stress in P 4 C shaft and hub connection is due to the large pressure angle at the point of contact, which leads to a smaller contact area and greater contact pressure. The contact pressure was found to be triangular shaped in clearance and transition fit and with a large crest, followed by a trough and a small crest in interference fit for torsional bending load...|$|R
40|$|The role of {{the shaft}} in the golf swing {{has been the subject}} of {{scientific}} debate for many years but there is little consensus regarding the effects of altering shaft bending stiffness. The aim of this thesis was to determine and explain the effects of changes in shaft stiffness on body kinematics, <b>shaft</b> strain and <b>key</b> performance indicators including club head speed, impact location on the club face and launch conditions. For this purpose, three clubs matched in all properties but shaft bending stiffness (l-flex (217 cpm), r-flex (245 cpm) and x-flex (272 cpm)) were instrumented with strain gauges. In an initial study, seventeen male golfers (handicap 1. 8 ± 1. 9) tested these clubs, but no shaft effects on body kinematics, club head speed and ball launch conditions were identified. A follow-up study involved twenty skilled players (handicap 0. 3 ± 1. 7), testing only the l- and x-flex clubs. Two optical motion capture systems were used to determine wrist angular kinematics, club head presentation and the ball's impact location on the club face. There was an effect of shaft stiffness on ball and club head speed, both of which increased by 0. 7 % for the l-flex club (p = 0. 008 and < 0. 001, respectively). Two factors contributed to these increases: (i) a faster recovery of the l-flex shaft from lag to lead bending just before impact (p < 0. 001); (ii) an increase of 0. 5 % in angular velocity of the grip of the l-flex club at impact (p = 0. 005). A difference in angular wrist kinematics between the two clubs was identified for two swing events and may have contributed to the increase in angular velocity. The face angle (p = 0. 176) and the ball's impact location (p = 0. 907 and p = 0. 774) were unaffected by changes in shaft stiffness. Decreases in shaft stiffness were associated with significantly more shaft bending at the transition from backswing to downswing (p < 0. 001), but the amount of lead bending at impact was found to be largely unaffected by shaft stiffness. The test protocol from the follow-up study was repeated using a golf robot, confirming the results for ball speed and wrist kinematics if the impact speed was set to replicate the mean club head speed achieved by the human players. Results from this thesis contradict the conventional view that reducing shaft stiffness leads to an increase in lead bending at impact and, consequently, to an increase in ball launch angle. Overall, these results suggest that it is unlikely that changes in overall shaft stiffness in themselves have a marked effect on driving performance.
