5|$|I Bonaparte {{chose to}} ride across the alps on a mule (obtained at a convent at Martigny) {{rather than a}} steed, the typical gentleman's mount at the time, because the mule was {{considered}} to be more sure-footed on the slippery slopes and narrow passes of the Alps, and to be more <b>sturdy</b> <b>and</b> hardy while making such a perilous journey on such volatile terrain.|$|E
5|$|Reptiles {{evolved from}} amphibious {{ancestors}} which left the aquatic lifestyle and became terrestrial. To prevent loss of moisture reptilian skin lost the softness and moisture of amphibian skin {{and developing a}} thick stratum corneum with multiple layers of lipids which served as an impermeable barrier as well as provided protection from the ultraviolet. Over time, reptilian skin cells became highly keratinised, horny, <b>sturdy</b> <b>and</b> desiccated. The surfaces of the dermis and epidermis of all reptilian scales form a single contiguous sheet, {{as can be seen}} when the snake sheds its skin as a whole.|$|E
5|$|L.lubrica fruit {{bodies are}} similar to those of Cudonia confusa, {{commonly}} known as the cinnamon jellybaby. The species can be differentiated by the fact that L.lubrica fruit bodies are more <b>sturdy,</b> <b>and</b> those of C.confusa are much paler in colour. Another Cudonia species, C. circinans (which is highly similar to C. lutea), is similar to L. lubrica, though it can be differentiated by its colour (which is more brown), spores (which are smaller and thinner) and texture (which is less slimy and gelatinous than L. lubrica). L. lubrica fruit bodies can also be mistaken for those of the much rarer L.atrovirens, which can be differentiated by its darker colouration. L.viscosa can again be differentiated by colouration; the species has a green head. However, as L. lubrica fruit bodies can sometimes have a greenish hue, differentiation between the two species is not always easy.|$|E

5|$|Command & Conquer {{requires}} the player {{to construct a}} base and to gather resources in order to fund the production of buildings, technologies, and combat units to attack and conquer an opponent's base. The game contains two playable factions: the Global Defense Initiative (GDI) and the Brotherhood of Nod. GDI units are <b>sturdy</b> <b>and</b> powerful, but expensive. Meanwhile, Nod armies {{are made up of}} a mix of cheap and numerous units, mixed in with unusual units such as rocket bikes and stealth tanks. As a result, GDI focuses on large-scale strategic attacks, while Nod creates bigger armies and uses unconventional tactics. There are roughly fifty units and structures in total. Tiberium, the game's sole resource, is gathered by harvester units that carry it to a refinery structure for processing. When the player constructs buildings, additional units and structures become available for purchase. Command & Conquer features two single-player campaigns, one each for the GDI and Nod factions. The objective of most campaign missions is to destroy or take control of enemy buildings. The missions begin with live-action full motion video (FMV) cutscenes.|$|E
5|$|Equine hooves {{and legs}} have evolved over {{millions}} of years to the form in which they are found today. The original ancestors of horses had shorter legs, terminating in five-toed feet. Over millennia, a single hard hoof evolved from the middle toe, while the other toes gradually disappeared into the tiny vestigial remnants that are found today on the lower leg bones. Prairie-dwelling equine species developed hooves and longer legs that were both <b>sturdy</b> <b>and</b> light weight to help them evade predators and cover longer distances in search of food. Forest-dwelling species retained shorter legs and three toes, which helped them on softer ground. Approximately 35 million years ago, a global drop in temperature created a major habitat change, leading to the transition of many forests to grasslands. This led to a die-out among forest-dwelling equine species, eventually leaving the long-legged, one-toed Equus of today, which includes the horse, as the sole surviving genus of the Equidae family.|$|E
5|$|The Newfoundland pony is a {{breed of}} pony {{originating}} in Newfoundland, Canada. They are <b>sturdy</b> <b>and</b> muscular ponies, {{found in many}} colors, including the relatively rare white coloration. The Newfoundland developed from a mix of English, Irish and Scottish pony breeds brought to Newfoundland by settlers {{over a period of}} four centuries. Initially free-roaming, they crossbred to produce the modern type. They were used by settlers as draft and multi-purpose ponies until the mid-20th century, when they were brought {{almost to the point of}} extinction by mechanization and slaughter. The population rebounded slightly after the formation of a breed registry in 1980, but still remains low. In 1997, the Newfoundland pony was declared a heritage breed of Newfoundland and Labrador, which afforded it protection under the law, but the breed has not yet been recognized under the Canadian federal Animal Pedigree Act. As of 2008, there were 248 registered ponies of breeding age, out of a total population of 361. In 2013, the widely dispersed breeding population is still estimated at between 200 and 250 animals.|$|E

5|$|New Forest ponies have {{a gentle}} {{temperament}} and {{a reputation for}} intelligence, strength, and versatility. On the whole, they are a <b>sturdy</b> <b>and</b> hardy breed. The one known hereditary genetic disorder found in the breed is congenital myotonia, a muscular condition also found in humans, dogs, cats, and goats. It was identified in the Netherlands in 2009, after a clinically affected foal {{was presented to the}} Equine Clinic of Utrecht University. DNA sequencing revealed that the affected foal was homozygous for a missense mutation in the gene encoding CLCN1, a protein which regulates the excitability of the skeletal muscle. The mutated allele was found in both the foal's parents, its siblings, and two other related animals, none of whom exhibited any clinical signs. The researchers concluded that the condition has an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance, whereby both parents have to contribute the mutated allele for a physically affected foal to be produced with that phenotype. The study suggested that the mutation was of relatively recent origin: the founder of the mutated gene, as all the ponies who tested positive for the mutation are direct descendants of this stallion. The probable founder stallion has been identified as Kantje's Ronaldo; testing is now underway to identify which of his offspring carry the mutated gene. All carriers will be removed from the breeding section of the New Forest Pony Breeding & Cattle Society's stud book, and all New Forest stallions licensed in the UK also will be tested, whether or not they descend from Kantje's Ronaldo, to cover the possibility that the mutated gene may have appeared earlier in the pedigree, although it is believed that the mutated gene has now been eradicated from the British breeding stock. All breeding stock imported to the UK also will be tested.|$|E

25|$|The arched {{skull of}} Camarasaurus was remarkably square and the blunt snout had many fenestrae, {{though it was}} <b>sturdy</b> <b>and</b> is {{frequently}} recovered in good condition by paleontologists. The 19centimeter long (7.5in) teeth were shaped like chisels (spatulate) and arranged evenly along the jaw. The strength of the teeth indicates that Camarasaurus probably ate coarser plant material than the slender-toothed diplodocids.|$|E
25|$|It was {{considered}} to be <b>sturdy</b> <b>and</b> very manoeuvrable for a glider. The design of the Horsa adopted a high-wing cantilever monoplane configuration, being equipped with wooden wings and a wooden semi-monocoque fuselage. The fuselage was built in three sections bolted together, the front section held the pilot's compartment and main freight loading door, the middle section was accommodation for troops or freight, the rear section supported the tail unit.|$|E
25|$|In 461, Leo {{founded the}} Excubitors as a {{counterbalance}} to the Germanic soldiers under Aspar. He recruited {{the majority of}} its members from among the <b>sturdy</b> <b>and</b> warlike Isaurians. In 466, Tarasicodissa, an Isaurian officer of the Excubitors came forth with evidence that Ardabur, a son of Aspar, was guilty of treason. The scandal caused a rift in the relations of Leo and Aspar, leaving the former relying even more on the Excubitors.|$|E

The United States dominated pole vault at the time; that the Americans only won gold (Miller) and bronze (Jefferson) at the Olympics was seen as a disappointment.|$|E
25|$|Tollers {{are often}} mistaken for small Golden Retrievers, but the Toller is more active, both {{physically}} and mentally. According to the breed standards, the Toller is athletic, muscular, compact, medium to heavy boned, balanced and powerful. The chest is deep. Conformation judges require Tollers {{to be capable of}} tolling, and physical faults that inhibit working ability are heavily penalized. They should be of moderate build—a lack of substance or a heavy build are penalized by judges, as both detract from the breed standard and athleticism. The legs are <b>sturdy</b> <b>and</b> solid, and they have webbed feet.|$|E
25|$|All {{the shelters}} are adapted {{to suit the}} local climate. The Mongolian gers (yurts), for example, are {{versatile}} enough to be cool in hot continental summers and warm in the sub-zero temperaturs of Mongolian winters, and include a close-able ventilation hole at the centre and a chimney for a stove. A ger is typically not often relocated, and is therefore <b>sturdy</b> <b>and</b> secure, including wooden front door and several layers of coverings. A berber tent, by contrast, might be relocated daily, and is much lighter and quicker to erect and dismantle – {{and because of the}} climate it is used in, does not need to provide the same degree of protection from the elements.|$|E

25|$|Carvel {{construction}} {{dates back}} even earlier. The {{design of the}} luzzu is believed to date {{back at least to}} Phoenician times. A luzzu is a double-ended carvel-built fishing boat from the Maltese islands. Traditionally, they are brightly painted in shades of yellow, red, green and blue, and the bow is normally pointed with a pair of eyes. These eyes may be the modern survival of an ancient Phoenician custom (also practiced by the ancient Greeks); they are sometimes (and probably inaccurately) referred to as the Eye of Horus or of Osiris. The luzzu has survived because it tends to be a <b>sturdy</b> <b>and</b> stable boat even in bad weather. Originally, the luzzu was equipped with sails although nowadays almost all are motorised, with onboard diesel engines being the most common.|$|E
25|$|Stateless met in Leeds in 2002. Chris James, James <b>Sturdy</b> <b>and</b> Jon Taylor {{had played}} in rock bands {{together}} for several years. When realising this more traditional style did not offer them the musical challenge they were looking for, they began to expand their musical tastes and influences to more sample based electronica and hip hop. For a while they ruled out the use of guitars when writing, trying to take their sound into a new direction. The interest in hip hop brought in DJ kidkanevil who they heard at a hip hop club night in Leeds. James met Rod Buchanan-Dunlop, a Scot, at Leeds Metropolitan University {{on the first day}} of their Creative Music and Sound Technology course in the Leeds Met School of Technology. Buchanan-Dunlop then came into the band as the programmer and Stateless became a five piece.|$|E
25|$|The Excubitors {{were founded}} by Emperor Leo I (reigned 457–474) c. 460 and {{numbered}} 300 men, often recruited {{from among the}} <b>sturdy</b> <b>and</b> warlike Isaurians, as part of Leo's effort to counterbalance {{the influence of the}} magister militum Aspar and the large Germanic element in the East Roman army. Unlike the older palace regiments of the Scholae Palatinae, which were {{under the control of the}} magister officiorum and eventually degenerated to parade-ground formations, the Excubitors long remained a crack fighting force. In addition, while the Scholae were garrisoned throughout Thrace and Bithynia, the Excubitors were billeted in the imperial palace itself and formed practically the only garrison of Constantinople in the 6th century. Their high status is further illustrated by the fact that both officers and ordinary Excubitors were often sent for special missions by the emperors, including diplomatic assignments.|$|E
