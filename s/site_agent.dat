40|$|The civil {{engineering}} {{sector of the}} construction {{industry as a whole}} has been suffering from mental stress {{due to a lack of}} stress management interventions, rendering employees vulnerable to burnout, poor mental health, and subject to injury on site. The rationale of this study is to explore the prevalence of mental stress in the {{civil engineering}} sector of the construction industry, and the potential causes of stress, vis-à-vis the effects it has on an individual. An empirical study based on a descriptive and analytical survey method was conducted among medium to large civil engineering contractors in the Nelson Mandela Bay Metropole (NMBM). The study adopted the use of questionnaires, and a review of the related literature to effectively summarise and describe the collected field data. The sample stratum included civil engineering <b>site</b> <b>agents</b> and foremen. The salient findings include: high job demands, low job control, and low job social support are contributors to stress; <b>site</b> <b>agents</b> and foremen long for more time spent with family and friends; <b>site</b> <b>agents</b> and foremen are exposed to various physical, organisational and socio-economic stressors; <b>site</b> <b>agents</b> and foremen are displaying coping strategies unsupportive of a healthy lifestyle; there is a lack of awareness of stress management in the civil engineering sector of the construction industry; the level of stress experienced by <b>site</b> <b>agents</b> and foremen is rated as a lesser extent; the prevalence of depression among <b>site</b> <b>agents</b> and foremen is rated as a lesser extent; <b>site</b> <b>agents</b> and foremen are at risk of injury due to feeling stressed, and <b>site</b> <b>agents</b> and foremen are exposed to a range of musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) due to poor ergonomics, and possibly stress too. It can be concluded that stress negatively affects the civil engineering sector of the construction industry by, inter alia, increased employee absence, injuries and accidents, higher staff turnover, depression, and lower levels of production. Furthermore, stress may lead to eventual burnout, rendering an individual at a significantly higher risk of developing physical health complications. Recommendations include: organisations to address the problem of work-family imbalance, by providing more time off to spend with family and loved ones. v Organisations need to promote and implement internal coping strategies, to assist those who are facing strain to effectively deal with their stress. More support from line managers to employees should be provided, as this will increase their resources in terms of job support, job demand, and job control in their working environment. Also, organisations need to promote teambuilding activities and exercise among their employees. Lastly, organisational policy and government legislation need to be revised in the long term, to provide for individual mental wellbeing, and reduced occupational stress...|$|R

P site agents do not compete {{with any of the}} activators of C (Mn 2, G/F, forskolin), nor do they diminish the potency of any activator of C. Rather, activation of C increases the effectiveness of P site agents and causes up to a 10, 000 -fold increase in the potency of DDA. The ability of G/F or forskolin to potentiate P site inhibition is also noted at concentrations much lower than those required for the stimulation of adenylate cyclase activity. These data are inconsistent with a simple two-state allostenc model for the regulation of the activity of C and demand the postulation of either a distinct, inhibited conformation of the enzyme or the existence of a dead-end complex with adenosine bound to the catalytic site...|$|E
40|$|In this work, we pre-deploy a {{large number}} of smart agents to monitor an area of interest. This area could be divided into many Voronoi cells by using the {{knowledge}} of Voronoi diagram and every Voronoi <b>site</b> <b>agent</b> is responsible for monitoring and tracking the target in its cell. Then, a cooperative relay tracking strategy is proposed such that during the tracking process, when a target enters a new Voronoi cell, this event triggers the switching of both tracking agents and communication topology. This is significantly different from the traditional switching topologies. In addition, during the tracking process, the topology and tracking agents switch, which may lead the tracking system to be stable or unstable. The system switches either among consecutive stable subsystems and consecutive unstable subsystems or between stable and unstable subsystems. The objective {{of this paper is to}} design a tracking strategy guaranteeing overall successful tracking despite the existence of unstable subsystems. We also address extended discussions on the case where the dynamics of agents are subject to disturbances and the disturbance attenuation level is achieved. Finally, the proposed tracking strategy is verified by a set of simulations...|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} a discrete agent-based model on a one-dimensional lattice and a two-dimensional square lattice, where each agent is a dimer occupying two <b>sites.</b> <b>Agents</b> move by vacating one occupied site {{in favor of}} a nearest-neighbor site and obey either a strict simple exclusion rule or a weaker constraint that permits partial overlaps between dimers. Using indicator variables and careful probability arguments, a discrete-time master equation for these processes is derived systematically within a mean-field approximation. In the continuum limit, nonlinear diffusion equations that describe the average agent occupancy of the dimer population are obtained. In addition, we show that multiple species of interacting subpopulations give rise to advection-diffusion equations. Averaged discrete simulation data compares very well with the solution to the continuum partial differential equation models.

40|$|Zampanolide, first {{discovered}} in a sponge extract in 1996 and later identified as a microtubule-stabilizing agent in 2009, is a covalent binding secondary metabolite with potent, low nanomolar activity in mammalian cells. Zampanolide was not susceptible to single amino acid mutations at the taxoid site of β-tubulin in human ovarian cancer 1 A 9 cells, despite evidence that it selectively binds to the taxoid site. As expected, it did not synergize with other taxoid <b>site</b> microtubule-stabilizing <b>agents</b> (paclitaxel, ixabepilone, discodermolide), but surprisingly also did not synergize in 1 A 9 cells with laulimalide/peloruside binding <b>site</b> <b>agents</b> either. Efforts to generate a zampanolide-resistant cell line were unsuccessful. Using a standard wound scratch assay in cell culture, it was an effective inhibitor of migration of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and fibroblast cells (D 551). These properties of covalent binding, the ability to inhibit cell growth in paclitaxel and epothilone resistant cells, {{and the ability to}} inhibit cell migration suggest that it would be of interest to investigate zampanolide in preclinical animal models to determine if it is effective in vivo at preventing tumor growth and metastasis. : The authors thank the Cancer Society of New Zealand, Wellington Medical Research Foundation, and Victoria University for support of the project (Jessica J.

40|$|The {{impairment}} of glutamatergic neurotransmission {{plays an important}} role in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The pathological process, which involves the production of amyloid-β peptides and hyperphosphorylated tau proteins, spreads over well-delineated neuroanatomical circuits. The gradual deterioration of proper synaptic functioning (via GluN 2 A-containing N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors, NMDARs) and the development of excitotoxicity (via GluN 2 B-containing NMDARs) in these structures both accompany the disease pathogenesis. Although one of the most important therapeutic targets would be glutamate excitotoxicity, the application of conventional anti-glutamatergic agents could result in further deterioration of synaptic transmission and intolerable side-effects. With regard to NMDAR antagonists with tolerable side-effects, ion channel blockers with low affinity, glycine <b>site</b> <b>agents,</b> and specific antagonists of polyamine site and GluN 2 B subunit may come into play. However, in the mirror of experimental data, only the application of ion channel blockers with pronounced voltage dependency, low affinity, and rapid unblocking kinetics (e. g., memantine) and specific antagonists of the GluN 2 B subunit (e. g., ifenprodil and certain kynurenic acid amides) resulted in desirable symptom amelioration.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} examines {{a number}} of scenarios in multi-agent foraging. The first scenario examined looks {{at a group of}} agents seeking to forage from resources that have a known location, but unknown quality. Communication among the agents is limited by range, and resource sites are arranged so they are farther apart than the communication range of the agents. Agents seek to maximize their expected foraging rate over a given time horizon. Initially, agents must choose which site they are going to investigate first. After inspecting a <b>site,</b> the <b>agents</b> must choose to either continue foraging at the site they are currently at or to investigate one of the other <b>sites.</b> <b>Agents</b> can communicate their decisions to one another as well as their information about other food sites when they are within communication range. The optimal way of making decisions is shown mathematically for the case of two resource <b>sites</b> and multiple <b>agents</b> under certain assumptions as well as three resource sites and only one agent. Another scenario examined is one where discrete food pieces are generated on a grid and agents must compete with one another to forage the food pieces. Food pieces are generated from two distinct resource sites. The first case examined is when the other agents are visible and the food pieces are visible to the agent. In this case the agent moves to consume a piece of food if it can do so before any other agents. If it is not moving to consume a piece of food, then it moves to maximize its probability of consuming a piece of food in the future. Another case is examined when the other agents are not visible. In this case an agent must decide whether it thinks it can consume a food piece before other agents can. The agent also wants to move in order to maximize the probability of consuming future food particles, but in this case must make decisions based on how food particles are disappearing rather than directly observing other agents. The most complicated scenario examined is one where the other agents are visible to one another, but unconsumed food pieces are not visible. The only food locations known to an agent are the pieces that it consumes. Agents search for pieces of food based on probability maps that they generate. Probability maps are generated based on the agent's information it has about food it has consumed. The agents also make use of observations of the other agents in order to search for new food particles...|$|R
