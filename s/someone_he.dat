5|$|During the {{production}} of the third season, special effects supervisor Dave Gauthier constructed an elaborate mock-up of a Boeing 737 airplane {{in order to be able}} to simulate a crash. Series creator Chris Carter decided to make use of this rig during the fourth season. When conceiving of the episode, the desire to add to Fox Mulder's emotional involvement by having <b>someone</b> <b>he</b> knew on board led to the writers bringing back the character of Max Fenig to be that person.|$|E
5|$|Later, when Mark {{goes to the}} Bahamas on a {{supposed}} business trip, Kate decides to follow him there and expose him. She finds Carly and Amber at the airport, who explain that Mark has been using Kate {{as the owner of}} the companies he defrauded from, which would—were his fraud to be discovered—result in her going to prison. Kate also finds out that Mark has been seeing yet another woman: <b>someone</b> <b>he</b> has met on this trip. This, and the possibility of him facing prison, motivates her to take action with the help of Carly's legal expertise.|$|E

5|$|Anti-Earp {{writers and}} {{researchers}} use Frank Waters' Earp Brothers of Tombstone, {{as their primary}} source for material that presents Wyatt Earp {{as something of a}} villainous monster, aided and abetted by his brothers who were almost brutes. Waters detested the Earps so badly that he presented a book that was terribly flawed, poorly edited, and brimming with prevarications. In his other work, Waters is poetic. In the Earp Brothers of Tombstone, he {{is little more than a}} tabloid hack, trying to slander <b>someone</b> <b>he</b> dislikes. To date, no reason has been uncovered for the bias Frank Waters exhibited against Wyatt Earp and his brothers.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} days of the inquiry, the Portuguese police searched through images seized from {{paedophile}} investigations, and Madeleine's parents were shown photographs of sex offenders in case they recognized them from Praia de Luz. Several British paedophiles were of interest. In May 2009 investigators working for the McCanns tried to question one, Raymond Hewlett; he had allegedly told <b>someone</b> <b>he</b> knew what happened to Madeleine, but he retracted and died of cancer in Germany in December that year. Scotland Yard made inquiries about two paedophiles who have been in jail in Scotland since 2010 for murder. The men were running a window-cleaning service in the Canary Islands when Madeleine went missing.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} hours of 20 March 2011, a group of 20 to 25 masked men, some armed with rifles and {{accompanied}} by dozens of uniformed Bahraini security forces, broke into Rajab's house. Rajab was detained and his files and a computer were confiscated. He reported that they blindfolded and handcuffed him and put him {{into the back of a}} vehicle before verbally abusing, beating and threatening to rape him. He claimed that they kicked him when he refused to say that he loved the prime minister. He was taken to a Ministry of Interior detention facility in Adliya, a suburb of Manama. After being briefly questioned about <b>someone</b> <b>he</b> did not know, he was released.|$|E

5|$|Josce {{was married}} to Sybil, the widow of Pain fitzJohn, who died in 1137. Sybil had held Ludlow Castle against Stephen in 1139, but {{surrendered}} after a siege. Ludlow was an important strategic stronghold {{for control of the}} Welsh Borders, and Stephen decided to marry Pain's widow to <b>someone</b> <b>he</b> felt was trustworthy. Upon his marriage Josce also acquired control of the castle, built in the late 11th century. Josce probably also received many of the de Lacy family's holdings in southern Shropshire, but he rebelled against Stephen and fortified Ludlow against the king. Josce's position was so strong that when Stephen granted much of the surrounding lands to Robert de Beaumont, Earl of Leicester, Ludlow was specifically exempted. Stephen told Robert that he would have a royal grant of the castle if he could secure Josce's submission as a vassal.|$|E
5|$|The {{second season}} begins with Rachel {{waiting at the}} gate for Ross to declare her love for him. However, she discovers that he is dating Julie (Lauren Tom), <b>someone</b> <b>he</b> knew from {{graduate}} school. Rachel's attempts to tell Ross she likes him mirror his failed attempts in the first season, although the characters eventually begin a relationship. Joey gets cast in a part in a fictional version of the soap opera Days of Our Lives, but his character is killed off after conflicts with the show's writers, claiming that he writes many of his own lines. Chandler gets back with Janice, his ex-girlfriend from season one. Monica begins dating Richard (Tom Selleck), a recently divorced family friend and 21 years her senior. In the season finale, they end their relationship when they realize that unlike Monica, Richard does not want children.|$|E
5|$|Writer and {{producer}} Bob Gale conceived the idea after he visited {{his parents in}} St. Louis, Missouri {{after the release of}} Used Cars. Searching their basement, Gale found his father's high school yearbook and discovered he was president of his graduating class. Gale thought about the president of his own graduating class, who was <b>someone</b> <b>he</b> had nothing to do with. Gale wondered whether he would have been friends with his father if they went to high school together. When he returned to California, he told Robert Zemeckis his new concept. Zemeckis subsequently thought of a mother claiming she never kissed a boy at school when, in fact, she was highly promiscuous. The two took the project to Columbia Pictures, and made a development deal for a script in September 1980.|$|E
50|$|I think there's {{definitely}} {{a conflict of}} interest there. Fish is very by the book, and does everything as he's told, and follows the rules. I think him knowing that <b>someone</b> <b>he's</b> involved with was {{in trouble with the law}} or doesn't do everything by the book, I think that causes a whole new added tension in addition to the history we already have. It changes it a little bit.|$|R

5|$|At Union Station, {{the cars}} are loaded onto a train car {{with the help of}} Wrench. Steve arrives shortly {{thereafter}} and after bribing Wrench, is surprised to find Charlie and the others waiting for him. Steve brandishes a gun and demands his gold back, but Mashkov arrives; Charlie explains that he has offered Mashkov part of the gold and Steve in exchange for helping with security protection. Steve is punched in the face by Stella before being taken away by Mashkov, who reveals he will be tortured and killed. The group boards the train as it departs to New Orleans, and celebrate in John's honor. The epilogue shows them all having used their share of the gold for their own desired purposes; Handsome Rob purchases an Aston Martin Vanquish, Left Ear buys a mansion in southern Spain, while Napster buys a powerful stereo capable of blowing a woman's clothes off. Meanwhile, Charlie takes John's advice about finding <b>someone</b> <b>he</b> wants {{to spend the rest of}} his life with, and he and Stella travel to Venice together.|$|E
5|$|Heaphy and {{his wife}} moved north of Auckland {{to what is now}} known as Warkworth in early 1854, {{following}} his appointment as district surveyor for the Mahurangi Peninsula, which was being opened for settlement. For two years, Heaphy surveyed the plots of land that were to be sold to people moving to the area. In 1856 he became Auckland's provincial surveyor following the retirement of his predecessor. He moved back to Auckland and took up residence in Parnell. Surveying kept him busy {{for the next few years}} but in early 1859, he accompanied Ferdinand von Hochstetter, who had been invited by the government to make a report on a coalfield discovered south of Auckland. The two became friendly and Hochstetter was impressed with Heaphy's bush skills, although privately did not accord him much respect for his scientific knowledge. When Hochstetter left for Europe later in the year, he took with him many examples of Heaphy's artwork. The two later fell out, when Heaphy had an article published in a geological journal. Hochstetter felt usurped by <b>someone</b> <b>he</b> considered an inferior scholar and publicly questioned Heaphy's credentials. He also made allegations that Heaphy had plagiarised portions of his work on the coalfields. Heaphy mounted a spirited defence and generally had the sympathy of the public. The dispute did not stop Hochstetter from using Heaphy's artwork in a book he published on New Zealand's geology.|$|E
5|$|The more skin left {{unarmoured}} and exposed, {{the lower}} a gladiator's {{status and the}} greater his perceived effeminacy. Likewise, the engulfing net may {{have been seen as}} a feminine symbol. The light arms and armour of the retiarius thus established him as the lowliest, most disgraced, and most effeminate of the gladiator types. Helmets allowed both gladiators and spectators to dehumanise the fighters; when an arena combatant had to kill a comrade-at-arms, <b>someone</b> <b>he</b> probably lived and trained with every day, his opponent's helmet added an extra layer of separation. However, the retiarius was allowed no head protection; his face was visible to all. The emperor Claudius had all net-fighters who lost in combat put to death so that spectators could enjoy their expressions of agony. The retiariuss fighting style was another strike against him, as reliance on speed and evasion were viewed as undignified in comparison to the straightforward trading of blows. The retiarii lived in the worst barracks. Some members of the class trained to fight as Samnites, another gladiator type, in order to improve their status.|$|E
50|$|He {{examines}} the other case, and comes upon {{the picture of}} himself that was in Gretchen Albright’s journal. On {{the back of it}} is a date: 3/25/98. Looking at another file, he sees his name again. This time, in the dreams of <b>someone</b> <b>he’s</b> never met. File after file, Paul sees his own name connected to people and events he had absolutely no clue about. Finally, Paul sees a line of text about his own father, which blows his mind.|$|R
5000|$|Though many {{opinions}} varied {{on whether}} the album was the classic [...] "Wu-Tang sound", Ari Levenfeld of PopMatters feels: [...] "If Legend of the Liquid Sword is any indication of the Wu-Tang Clan's efforts to come, it doesn't seem like the group is all that interested in expanding their fan base or growing musically. Maybe they've done what {{they set out to}} do. The franchise is working... GZA isn't trying to be something or <b>someone</b> <b>he's</b> not. He's all about the original recipe." ...|$|R

25|$|On offense, Tony Dungy's {{strategy}} {{involved a}} conservative, ball-control offense based primarily around running {{the ball and}} short, high-percentage passes {{when he was at}} Tampa Bay. At Indianapolis, he inherited and kept the offense designed by offensive coordinator Tom Moore because the offense was in the hands of <b>someone</b> <b>he</b> knew and trusted. In both cases, most of the offensive planning has been handled by his offensive coordinators.|$|E
25|$|Civil service reformers {{held out}} {{hope for the}} second Cleveland {{administration}} but saw Vice President Stevenson {{as a symbol of}} the spoils system. He never hesitated to feed names of Democrats to the Post Office Department. Once he called at the US Treasury Department to protest against an appointment and was shown a letter he had written endorsing the candidate. Stevenson told the treasury officials not to pay attention to any of his written endorsements; if he really favored <b>someone</b> <b>he</b> would tell them personally.|$|E

25|$|As he rose {{to power}} {{as leader of the}} Nazi Party, Hitler was domineering and possessive of Raubal, keeping a tight rein on her. When he {{discovered}} in December 1927 that she was having a relationship with his chauffeur, Emil Maurice, he forced an end to the affair and dismissed Maurice from his personal service. After that he did not allow her to freely associate with friends and attempted to have himself or <b>someone</b> <b>he</b> trusted near her at all times, accompanying her on shopping trips, to the movies, and to the opera.|$|E
25|$|Jane Clark died in 1976. Her {{death was}} expected, but left Clark devastated. Several of his female friends hoped {{that he would}} marry them. His closest female friend, across many years, was Janet Stone, wife of the {{engraver}} Reynolds Stone; in common with Clark's daughter and sons, she was dismayed when he announced his intention to marry Nolwen de Janzé-Rice (1924–1989), daughter of Frederic and Alice de Janzé. The family felt that Clark was acting precipitately in marrying <b>someone</b> <b>he</b> had not known well for very long, but the wedding took place in November 1977. Clark and his second wife remained together until his death.|$|E
25|$|O'Shaughnessy {{calls the}} office, giving an address and then screams before the line goes dead.

He takes her inside and finds Gutman, Cairo, and Wilmer waiting for him, guns drawn. Gutman gives Spade $10,000 for the Falcon, but Spade tells them that part of his price is <b>someone</b> <b>he</b> can turn over to the police for the murders of Thursby and Captain Jacobi. Spade {{suggests}} Wilmer, since he certainly killed Thursby and Jacobi. After some intense negotiation, Gutman and Cairo agree; Wilmer is knocked out in a scuffle.|$|E

Aladdin and Jasmine are married, and Genie prepares for a long-awaited vacation. All ends well as Aladdin and Jasmine board the magic carpet and take flight (Finale Ultimo: [...] "Arabian Nights"/"A Whole New World" [...] (Reprises)).|$|R
