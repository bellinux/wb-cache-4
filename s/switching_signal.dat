50|$|The <b>switching</b> <b>signal</b> for a {{transistor}} {{is usually}} {{generated by a}} logic circuit or a microcontroller, which provides an output signal that typically {{is limited to a}} few milliamperes of current. Consequently, a transistor which is directly driven by such a signal would switch very slowly, with correspondingly high power loss. During switching, the gate capacitor of the transistor may draw current so quickly that it causes a current overdraw in the logic circuit or microcontroller, causing overheating which leads to permanent damage or even complete destruction of the chip. To prevent this from happening, a gate driver is provided between the microcontroller output signal and the power transistor.|$|E

50|$|Early EVcorts had a {{gasoline}} heater, while later models had an electric ceramic heater, {{as well as}} an air conditioner powered by an AC inverter.

The charger operated at 110 volts AC input and had a complex charging cycle, with an initial constant current that was switchable at 16, 20 or 30 amps, followed by a constant voltage ("float") that was adjustable to accommodate different battery types and compensated for seasonal temperature changes, and finally a trickle phase to maintain a full charge. Post-1990 models had a feature whereby the heater or air conditioner could be set to prewarm or precool the cabin to a specified temperature using power from the AC line once charging was complete, thus minimizing use of the batteries for climate control.|$|E

First, arbitrary <b>switching</b> <b>signals</b> are considered, and a necessary and sufficient condition is derived. Secondly, if the finite disturbance attenuation level is not preserved under arbitrary switchings, we restrict the <b>switching</b> <b>signals</b> so as to guarantee the finite disturbance at-tenuation levels.

50|$|For example, an amplified {{infrared}} photodiode may {{generate an}} electric signal that switches frequently between its absolute lowest value and its absolute highest value. This signal is then low-pass filtered {{to form a}} smooth signal that rises and falls corresponding to the relative amount of time the <b>switching</b> <b>signal</b> is on and off. That filtered output passes to the input of a Schmitt trigger. The net effect is that {{the output of the}} Schmitt trigger only passes from low to high after a received infrared signal excites the photodiode for longer than some known delay, and once the Schmitt trigger is high, it only moves low after the infrared signal ceases to excite the photodiode for longer than a similar known delay. Whereas the photodiode is prone to spurious switching due to noise from the environment, the delay added by the filter and Schmitt trigger ensures that the output only switches when there is certainly an input stimulating the device.|$|E
5000|$|... 35mm 4-Track Magnetic with Optical Track (magoptical): This type of Sensurround print was not usable as a mono optical print. Unlike {{standard}} magoptical prints, {{in which}} the optical track was a mono version of the magnetic stereo tracks, the optical track on magnetic Sensurround prints contained only the control tones. If played as a standard optical print, only the 25 Hz and 35 Hz control tones would be heard. To control the Sensurround System and its volume levels, control tones recorded on the optical track varied from −14 to −6 dB below 100% modulation and activation of the Sensurround System occurred at −16 dB. For program sounds applied to the Sensurround Horns, Track-2 (Center Front) was used, with its level and timing controlled by the 25 Hz control tone. For magnetic playback in mono, Track-2 (Center Front) could be used because Earthquake was mixed with mono dialogue, unlike most stereo films up to that time. For 4-Track equipped theaters that wanted to run Earthquake without Sensurround, the standard 12 kHz CinemaScope <b>switching</b> <b>signal</b> was recorded on Track-4 (surround). Because no noise reduction system was used on magnetic prints at the time, and due to the lower technical performance of the surround channels magnetic track, this switching system was implemented by 20th Century Fox during CinemaScope's development to reduce the hiss and system noise heard from the surround speakers. For Earthquake run in the United States, the surround speakers were disconnected and the Sensurround system was relied upon to produce all the surround sound effects; Track-4 was not used nor even connected to the Sensurround Integrator. In Europe, the surround track {{was used in the}} normal manner, being controlled by the Sensurround Integrator like the other magnetic channels.|$|E
