40|$|Continuous casting is {{a casting}} process that {{produces}} steel slabs {{in a continuous}} manner with steel being poured {{at the top of}} the caster and a steel strand emerging from the mould below. Molten steel is transferred from the AOD converter to the caster using a ladle. The ladle is designed to be strong and insulated. Complete insulation is never achieved. Some of the heat is lost to the refractories by convection and conduction. Heat losses by radiation also occur. It is important to know the temperature of the melt during the process. For this reason, an online model was previously developed to simulate the <b>steel</b> and <b>ladle</b> wall temperatures during the ladle cycle. The model was developed as an ODE based model using grey box modeling technique. The model’s performance was acceptable and needed to be presented in a user friendly way.

40|$|The paper {{describes}} the post-mortem characterisation of spent class AC 70 / 5 refractory linings from <b>steel</b> <b>ladles,</b> {{focuses on the}} environmental impact of their dumping, and points to possibilities of reusing material that is less degraded by corrosion. The degradability of the spent refractories in water is an indicator of their degree of corrosion. Therefore the crushed refractory bricks were leached in water and a weakly acid medium (pH = 5. 95 and 4. 21, respectively). The pH value, conductivity, redox potential and concentration of ions were measured in the leachates. New AC 70 / 5 material generates a pH value of leachates of around 8. 5, while the alkalinity of leachates from spent brick material increases with the increasing content of lime-corroding compounds (pH = 10 - 12). Alkaline environments inhibit the release of heavy metal ions. Under the thin strongly corroded surface the refractory material deteriorates only slightly. When bricks are crushed, a redistribution of components into grainy fractions occurs. C and MgO are concentrated in the fine fraction (under 1 mm) and Al₂O₃ in the coarse fractions (1 - 2. 5 mm). In view of raw material prices it is desirable to proceed further with the recovery of grainy Al₂O₃...|$|R

In conjunction with numerical computations, experiments were conducted in a 0. 30 scale water model of a 150 ton <b>steel</b> processing <b>ladle,</b> using a Froude number scaling criterion. Two typical gas injection configurations (i. e., conventional central injection and C. A. S. alloy addition procedure) were investigated. Flow visualization studies were carried out using a suspended network of silken threads, mean velocity vectors and overall flow patterns were determined by video recording techniques, while mean velocity vectors and associated turbulence level were also measured with laser doppler velocimetry. These measurements show very reasonable agreement with equivalent numerical predictions. To simulate the subsurface motion of additions, spherical wooden balls of various densities were dropped from typical heights, and their subsurface trajectories, immersion times, etc., recorded by means of a video recorder. Frame by frame analysis of the video tapes showed trends which are in good accord with computed trajectories. Mixing times of simulated molten additions were measured by the conductivity measurement technique.

40|$|The {{accomplished}} investigations {{about the}} drying process of refractory concrete {{are of interest}} for the refractory industry, whose world-wide sold products are mainly used in the steel industry. In the recent years {{a considerable amount of}} refractory companies replaced their products with new technology: monolithic refractory materials - castables. The success of these materials is due to their numerous advantages. They have better insulation, the lining can be cast in a shorter period of time and the linings can be easily fit to different slopes. However, castables have to be dried at the customer´s premises. This drying process should under economical and environmental considerations be done as quickly as possible and too high vapour pressure should not occur. In order to improve the existing drying rules, prior measurements were undergone both, in the laboratory and in-situ. These measurements are very time-consuming and expensive. Additionally to various results in the past, the present doctorate contains numerical simulations where the most important mechanisms within the drying process of microporous, moisture containing refractory concretes are described. Beside the mass and energy transfer, adequate empirical equations to simulate the drying process are summarized. The developed model is tested by two different ultra low cement castables used as working linings of <b>steel</b> <b>ladles</b> and as safety linings of tundishes.
