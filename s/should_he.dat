5|$|Before his {{departure}} for the Holy Land, Henry of Champagne had bequeathed the Counties of Champagne and Brie to his brother, Theobald, <b>should</b> <b>he</b> die without issue. Although Alice {{and her younger}} sister, Philippa, survived their father, Philip II of France invested their uncle, Theobald III, with Champagne and Brie in January 1198. Theobald III died on 24 May 1201, leaving Champagne and Brie to his posthumous son, Theobald IV, under the regency of his mother, Blanche of Navarre. However, Theobald IV's position was not secure as Alice and Philippa, both born while their father was count, could challenge a posthumous son's right to rule the counties.|$|E

Arielle and Valéry have an agreement that each is permitted to have extramarital affairs {{as long as they are}} limited to the time between 5 and 7 p.m. on weeknights. Brian is perplexed at this information and tells Arielle that he cannot continue the relationship with her, believing it is an unethical affair.

5|$|During {{an episode}} of Raw after SummerSlam, Goldberg {{challenged}} Triple H to another match for the World Heavyweight Championship. This match {{took place at the}} Unforgiven pay-per-view on September 21, 2003 with a stipulation that, <b>should</b> <b>he</b> lose, Goldberg would retire from WWE. Goldberg defeated Triple H to become the new champion. After SummerSlam, Kurt Angle focused his attention on The Undertaker, whom he wrestled in a match for the WWE Championship during {{an episode of}} SmackDown! on September 4, 2003. During the match, Lesnar attacked both wrestlers with a folding chair, leading to an Iron Man match between Angle and Lesnar. Lesnar won five falls during the match, while Angle won four, and as a result Lesnar won the title.|$|E
5|$|Henry's plans shifted {{when the}} Empress Matilda's husband, the Emperor Henry, died in 1125. King Henry {{recalled}} {{his daughter to}} England {{the next year and}} declared that, <b>should</b> <b>he</b> die without a male heir, she was to be his rightful successor. The Anglo-Norman barons were gathered together at Westminster on Christmas 1126, where they swore to recognise Matilda and any future legitimate heir she might have. Putting forward a woman as a potential heir in this way was unusual: opposition to Matilda continued to exist within the English court, and Louis was vehemently opposed to her candidacy.|$|E

5|$|In a 1649 treaty the Dutch had {{pledged to}} defend Denmark against unprovoked aggression, {{and from a}} Swedish point of view it was {{essential}} to establish naval supremacy in Øresund to keep the Dutch out should they decide {{to intervene in the}} conflict. Kronborg Castle sat near the narrowest part of Øresund, a sound only four kilometres wide, which gave the castle a supreme strategic importance. Frederick III had appointed the colonel Poul Beenfeldt commander of the castle and ordered him to defend it at all costs. <b>Should</b> <b>he</b> fail in that, Kronborg was to be blown up to prevent the Swedes from using it.|$|E

In 992 al-Aziz invited Mufarrij to participate in the campaign against Aleppo under the Turkish general Manjutakin, but it is unclear whether Mufarrij fought in this or the subsequent campaigns, as he is not mentioned again until 996.|$|E
5|$|Luther lists several criticisms {{advanced}} by laypeople against indulgences in theses 81–91. He presents these as difficult objections his congregants are bringing {{rather than his}} own criticisms. How <b>should</b> <b>he</b> answer those who ask why the pope does not simply empty purgatory {{if it is in}} his power? What <b>should</b> <b>he</b> say to those who ask why anniversary masses for the dead, which were for the sake of those in purgatory, continued for those who had been redeemed by an indulgence? Luther claimed that it seemed strange to some that pious people in purgatory could be redeemed by living impious people. Luther also mentions the question of why the pope, who is very rich, requires money from poor believers to build St. Peter's Basilica. Luther claims that ignoring these questions risks allowing people to ridicule the pope. He appeals to the pope's financial interest, saying that if the preachers limited their preaching in accordance with Luther's positions on indulgences (which he claimed was also the pope's position), the objections would cease to be relevant. Luther closes the Theses by exhorting Christians to imitate Christ even if it brings pain and suffering. Enduring punishment and entering heaven is preferable to false security.|$|E

5|$|There was {{speculation}} during September {{and early}} October 2007 about whether Brown {{would call a}} snap general election. Indeed, the party launched the Not Flash, Just Gordon advertising campaign, which was seen largely as pre-election promotion of Brown as Prime Minister. However, Brown announced on 6 October {{that there would be}} no election any time soon – despite opinion polls showing that he was capable of winning an election <b>should</b> <b>he</b> call one. This proved to be a costly mistake, as during 2008 his party slid behind the Conservatives (led by David Cameron) in the polls. Disputes over political donations, a string of losses in local elections, and by-election losses in Crewe and Glasgow did himself and the government no favours either.|$|E

5|$|This {{period of}} Armenian hegemony in the region, however, was coming {{close to an}} end {{with a series of}} Roman {{victories}} in the Roman–Mithridatic Wars. Friction between the two had existed for several decades, although it was during the Third Mithridatic War that the Roman armies under Lucullus made significant progress against Mithridates, forcing him to take refuge with Tigranes. Lucullus sent an ambassador named Appius Claudius to Antioch to demand that Tigranes surrender his father-in-law; <b>should</b> <b>he</b> refuse, Armenia would face war with Rome. Tigranes refused Appius Claudius' demands, stating that he would prepare for war against the Republic.|$|E
5|$|A defense-appointed {{expert witness}} {{in the field of}} {{biomechanics}} testified on March 5 that Nosek could not turn 180 degrees during the fall and that <b>should</b> <b>he</b> be falling forward, he could not have sustained an injury {{to the back of his}} head. He further said that if Nosek fell over the first row of the fans, he must have been not only pushed, but must have jumped himself. The State Attorney immediately attacked this testimony, claiming that the expert witness omitted the conditions at the place and time, as well as some of the eyewitness testimonies, according to which Nosek fell onto his back from the beginning and did not turn during the fall. The presiding judge agreed with the State Attorney on some of his points.|$|E

The camera was kept at a low position throughout the segment to heighten the immensity of the dinosaurs.|$|E

5|$|As Raskolnikov and Porfiry {{continue}} to meet, Raskolnikov's motives {{for the crime}} become exposed. Porfiry becomes increasingly certain of the man's guilt, but has no concrete evidence or witnesses with which to back up this suspicion. Furthermore, another man admits to committing the crime under questioning and arrest. However, Raskolnikov's nerves {{continue to}} wear thinner, and he is constantly struggling {{with the idea of}} confessing, though he knows that he can never be truly convicted. He turns to Sonya for support and confesses his crime to her. By coincidence, Svidrigaïlov has taken up residence in a room next to Sonya's and overhears the entire confession. When the two men meet face to face, Svidrigaïlov acknowledges this fact, and suggests that he may use it against him, <b>should</b> <b>he</b> need to. Svidrigaïlov also speaks of his own past, and Raskolnikov grows to suspect that the rumors about his having committed several murders are true. In a later conversation with Dunya, Svidrigaïlov denies that he had a hand in the death of his wife.|$|E
5|$|At that point, a {{group of}} aristocrats persuaded the Despot Andronikos to seek the {{assistance}} of the Republic of Venice, an initiative probably taken without consulting Constantinople. In spring 1423, via the Venetian colony of Negroponte, he informed the Venetians of his intention. The only conditions Andronikos attached to his offer were that the property, customs and privileges of the city's inhabitants, their right to trade and come and go freely, and the position of the city's Orthodox Church, were respected, and that Venice would pledge to defend the city against the Ottomans. Pseudo-Sphrantzes claims that Andronikos sold the city for 50,000 ducats, and this statement was often accepted by more recent scholars until the mid-20th century. However, this is not mentioned by any other source, nor is it found in the original documents pertaining to the affair, as shown by the scholars Konstantinos Mertzios and Paul Lemerle. On the other hand, the Venetian envoys appointed to oversee the handover were authorised to provide a sum of between 20,000 and 40,000 aspers from the revenue of the city as a yearly subsidy to Andronikos, <b>should</b> <b>he</b> request it.|$|E

There was also concern that, with his wife now living in Scotland, he would breach the Australian rule that wives were not allowed to travel with Test cricketers. In fact, lack of form and opportunity were greater threats to Barnes's continued Test career. Arriving back with several state games having already been played, he failed to make runs for New South Wales and was not picked for the first two Tests against the Indian tourists, Bill Brown taking over as opener with Morris.|$|E
