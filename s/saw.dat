5|$|An eighth {{installment}} was planned, but {{the decrease}} in the box office performance for <b>Saw</b> VI compared to previous installments led to <b>Saw</b> 3D being the final planned film in the series, and the plot concept for <b>Saw</b> VIII being incorporated into <b>Saw</b> 3D. <b>Saw</b> V director David Hackl was to direct the film, but two weeks before filming Lionsgate announced that Greutert, who directed the sixth film, would direct. Principal photography took place in Toronto, Ontario from February to April 2010 and was shot with the SI-3D digital camera system, as opposed to shooting with traditional cameras and later transferring to 3D in post-production.|$|E

40|$|The {{shortage}} in wood supply {{makes the}} effort to find alternative for wood material {{become more and more}} important. It was reported that the outer parts of oil palm stems could be used as solid wood after being properly treated. Being a monocotyledon, oil palm stems have a contradictory characteristic to the conventional hardwoods and softwoods and thus the <b>sawing</b> patterns suitable for hardwoods and softwoods should not be suitable for the oil palm stems. Two modified <b>sawing</b> patterns (polygon <b>sawing</b> and cobweb <b>sawing)</b> plus one ordinary <b>sawing</b> pattern (life <b>sawing)</b> were compared in the <b>sawing</b> of oil palm stems. The {{purpose of this study was}} to find the most suitable <b>sawing</b> pattern for oil palm stems. The cobweb <b>sawing</b> provided the highest outer lumber recovery (35 %) followed by polygon <b>sawing</b> (27 %) and life <b>sawing</b> (23 %). The polygon <b>sawing</b> provided the highest occurrence of wide lumbers, followed by the cobweb <b>sawing</b> and life <b>sawing.</b> The cobweb <b>sawing</b> need more than twice effective <b>sawing</b> time (15. 4 min) than the life <b>sawing</b> and polygon <b>sawing.</b> In overall, the polygon <b>sawing</b> was the most suitable pattern for the <b>sawing</b> of oil palm stem...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to determine the <b>sawing</b> properties of triclopyr poisoned rasamala logs compared to the girdled and normal ones. The effect of <b>sawing</b> pattern on <b>sawing</b> properties were also observed. The log samples used in this experiment comprise of 18 pieces which were collected from three different groups of tree (poisoned and girdled in one year periode, and control). Six logs of each group were <b>sawn</b> in two <b>sawing</b> patterns, namely live <b>sawing</b> and semi-quarter <b>sawing.</b> Parameters of <b>sawing</b> observed include recovery, productivity, power con- sumption, and <b>sawn</b> timber defects, particulary splits and bowing. The results of study revealed that moisture content of poisoned logs was 20 % lower than the normal one. Mean-while, both moisture content of girdled logs and poisoned ones are not significantly diferent. Poisoning treatment on rasamala trees in comparison to girdled and normal ones did not show significant difference in any <b>sawing</b> properties, except <b>sawing</b> productivity. The <b>sawing</b> recovery, power consumption, splits and bowing of <b>sawn</b> timber were 62 %; 32. 37 watt sec. /cm 2, 5. 21 cm and 3. 91 cm, respectively.

40|$|Early entry <b>sawing</b> applies <b>sawing</b> {{earlier and}} more shallowly than {{conventional}} <b>sawing</b> and {{is believed to}} increase <b>sawing</b> productivity and {{reduce the cost of}} the joint <b>sawing</b> operations. However, some early entry <b>sawing</b> joints (transverse joints) in Iowa were found to experience delayed cracking, sometimes up to 30 days. A concern is whether early entry <b>sawing</b> can lead to late-age random cracking. The present study investigated the effects of different <b>sawing</b> methods on random cracking in portland cement concrete (PCC) pavements. The approach was to assess the cracking potential at <b>sawing</b> joints by measuring the strain development of the concrete at the joints using concrete embedment strain gages. Ten joints were made with the early entry <b>sawing</b> method to a depth of 1. 5 in., and two strain gages were installed in each of the joints. Another ten joints were made with the conventional <b>sawing</b> method, five of which were <b>sawed</b> to a depth of one-third of the pavement thickness (3. 3 in.), and the other five of which were <b>sawed</b> to a depth of one-quarter of the pavement thickness (2. 5 in.). One strain gage was installed in each joint made using conventional <b>sawing.</b> In total, 30 strain gages were installed in 20 joints. The results from the present study indicate that all 30 joints cracked within 25 days after paving, though most joints made using early entry <b>sawing</b> cracked later than the joints made using conventional <b>sawing.</b> No random cracking was observed in the early entry <b>sawing</b> test sections two months after construction. Additionally, {{it was found that the}} strain gages used were capable of monitoring the deformations at the joints.
