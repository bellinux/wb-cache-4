40|$|The genetic yield {{potential}} of soybeans in the Midwestern United States {{is estimated to}} be approximately 100 bushels per acre, based on results from small-plot studies. However, field and statewide average yields are much lower. Soybean yield is the result of complex interactions between genetics, management, environment, fertility, and stresses. Water stress is often viewed as the biggest underlying factor resulting in yield loss. However, other factors such as <b>soybean</b> <b>cyst</b> <b>nematodes,</b> Rhizoctonia root rot, and hail damage can also cause significant injury to soybean yields...|$|R

40|$|Inbred {{nematodes}} propagated on a selecting host {{are likely}} to have homozygous genes of interest for investigating the genetics of host-parasite associations. A technique is presented to inbreed <b>soybean</b> <b>cyst</b> <b>nematodes,</b> by sibling matings at each generation, and to cross inbred lines. Soybean seedlings with severely trimmed cotyledons survive well on 0. 8 % agar. Eggs from a single female are incubated in water in a microtiter well. Virgin as well as mated females result from inoculation of two juveniles per root. Sibling males from the same source are produced by mass inoculations of eggs. Males are added individually to unmated females. Overall success for fertile females was 14 % in 1, 368 isolations. Three generations of inbreeding by siblings were achieved using nematodes from two populations that differ in their ability to reproduce on differential soybeans. Hybrids from crosses of the two inbred lines tested on differential hosts showed that the influence of Population 1 (selected and inbred on PI 209332) is greater than that of Population 2 (selected and inbred on PI 89772). Reciprocal crosses suggest that the influence of males is stronger than that of females in determining host specificity of F₁ offspring in these crosses. Our technique is simple and effective for inbreeding and crossing <b>soybean</b> <b>cyst</b> <b>nematodes...</b>|$|R
25|$|Plant-parasitic {{nematodes}} {{include several}} groups causing severe crop losses. The most common genera are Aphelenchoides (foliar nematodes), Ditylenchus, Globodera (potato <b>cyst</b> <b>nematodes),</b> Heterodera (<b>soybean</b> <b>cyst</b> <b>nematodes),</b> Longidorus, Meloidogyne (root-knot nematodes), Nacobbus, Pratylenchus (lesion nematodes), Trichodorus and Xiphinema (dagger nematodes). Several phytoparasitic nematode species cause histological damages to roots, including {{the formation of}} visible galls (e.g. by root-knot nematodes), which are useful characters for their diagnostic in the field. Some nematode species transmit plant viruses through their feeding activity on roots. One of them is Xiphinema index, vector of grapevine fanleaf virus, an important disease of grapes, another one is Xiphinema diversicaudatum, vector of arabis mosaic virus.|$|R

Utilizing current molecular biology techniques, the plant response to parasitical exposure was analyzed, focusing on the effect on gene expression due to the presence and damage caused by the nematode, homozygous screening and western blot was also used to determine the genetic change in the samples. Through observing the stages of growth of the plant in conjunction with exposure to nematodes, affected phenotype of the plant samples was also observed in progressive stages...|$|R

40|$|Researchers have {{indicated}} that the C₉ fatty acid, pelargonic acid (nonanoic acid), has considerable nematicidal activity that could be increased by derivitization and improved emulsification. Microemulsions of methyl and ethylene glycol esters of pelargonic acid developed by Mycogen Corporation (San Diego, CA) were tested for nematicidal activity against root-knot and <b>soybean</b> <b>cyst</b> <b>nematodes.</b> All treamaents were compared to a deionized water control and a microemulsion "blank" (minus active ingredient). Methyl pelargonate reduced gall numbers at concentrations ≥ 0. 8 μl a. i. /liter, and ethylene glycol pelargonate reduced gall numbers at ≥ 6. 4 μl a. i. /liter in a laboratory bioassay of Meloidogyne javanica on roots of tomato seedlings. Microscopic observation of treated M. javanica second-stage juveniles suggested that methyl pelargonate was toxic to nematodes at concentrations as low as 0. 2 μl a. i. /liter. Cysts of Heterodera glycines per gram of root were significantly reduced by weekly soil drenches of methyl pelargonate at 6. 4, 3. 2, and 1. 6 μl a. i. /liter compared to controls in one greenhouse experiment. Weekly soil drenches of methyl pelargonate at 4. 8 or 3. 2 μ 1 a. i. /liter also significantly {{reduced the number of}} eggs produced by M. incognita on soybean in a greenhouse test. In both greenhouse tests with soybean, rates of methyl pelargonate ≥ 4. 8 μl a. i. /liter had considerable phytotoxicity. No significant interaction of chemical treatment and different soil mixtures affected the nematode numbers produced or plant vigor observed. Soil drenches with microemulsions of methyl pelargonate at 3. 2 μl a. i. /liter applied weekly, or as two initial applications, were effective as a nematicide for root-knot and <b>soybean</b> <b>cyst</b> <b>nematodes</b> with negligible effects on plant vigor...|$|R
40|$|Tillage and {{cropping}} sequence {{studies were}} conducted on a Hartsells fine sandy loam from 1981 to 1984 to {{determine the influence of}} tillage systems and crop rotation on soybean relative yields. The tillage systems were conven- tional, strip-tillage, and no- tillage. Crop rotation was continuous soybeans, corn-soybeans (full season), corn-wheat-soybeans (double-cropped soybeans). In 1982 through 1984, conventional tillage with continuous soybeans resulted in lower soybean yields than strip- tillage or no- tillage. Corn-soybean rotation consistently resulted in higher soybean yields than continuous soybeans. Double-cropped soybean yields were reduced by 10 %when compared to full season soybeans, but wheat yields associated with double-cropped soybeans ranged from 3000 to 3900 kg/ha. The buildup of <b>soybean</b> <b>cyst</b> <b>nematodes</b> (continuous <b>soybean</b> with conventional tillage) appears to have a greater effect on soybean yields than soil compaction, soil nutrient levels, or rainfall distribution...|$|R
40|$|Selected {{populations of}} <b>soybean</b> <b>cyst</b> <b>nematodes</b> were inoculated to roots of {{compatible}} and incompatible soybeans. Rates of penetration of infective juveniles of nematode populations selected on PI 209332, PI 89772, and Pickett 71 were equivalent on compatible and incompatible soybean roots. The first two populations averaged about 10 % {{and the last}} about 5 % penetration in 24 -hour inoculations of young seedlings. About 14 % of those juveniles that entered roots in compatible combinations developed into maturing females, compared with only about 1 % in incompatible combinations. Several aberrations from the pattern of syncytial development associated with mature females in compatible hosts were apparent. A rapid necrotic response occurred in both kinds of hosts but was more frequent in incompatible associations. Delayed necrosis and small syncytia were present in some combinations. Those few females that developed in incompatible soybeans were associated with a characteristic syncytium different from the kind seen in roots of compatible hosts...|$|R

50|$|Due to {{the effect}} of Pasteuria on reproduction, {{especially}} on nematode pests of important crops, there is an interest to develop Pasteuria as a biological control agent. In 2012, Syngenta acquired a company named Pateuria Bioscience to commercialize Pasteuria as a biological control. In 2013, Syngenta launched CLARIVA™ pn, which has the active ingredient of Pasteuria nishizawae to combat the <b>soybean</b> <b>cyst</b> <b>nematode.</b> The effectiveness of Pasteuria as a biocontrol may depend on the biotypes of the nematode host that are present since they can vary in their susceptibility to Pasteuria.|$|E

The current wheat stem rust, leaf rust and yellow stripe rust epidemics spreading from East Africa into the Indian subcontinent are caused by rust fungi Puccinia graminis and P. striiformis. Other epidemics include Chestnut blight, as well as recurrent severe plant diseases such as Rice blast, <b>Soybean</b> <b>cyst</b> <b>nematode,</b> Citrus canker.|$|E
40|$|<b>Soybean</b> <b>cyst</b> <b>nematodes</b> (SCNs), Heterodera glycines, are {{unwanted}} micro-organisms {{that reduce}} yields {{of a major}} source of food–soybeans. In the United States alone, approximately $ 1 billion is lost per annum due to <b>cyst</b> <b>nematode</b> infections on <b>soybean</b> plants. Experts have conceived methods of mitigating the losses through phenotyping techniques via SCN eggs density estimation, and then applying the right control measures. Currently, they rely on labor intensive and time-consuming identification of SCN eggs in soil samples processed onto microscopic frames. However, phenotyping a vast array of fields requires automated high-throughput techniques. From an automation perspective, detection of rarely occurring SCN eggs in a microscopic image frame with a cluttered background of soil debris poses a major technical challenge. We propose a convolutional autoencoder approach that is armed with a novel selectivity criterion where we train a deep convolutional autoencoder to mask undesired parts in an image frame while allowing the desired objects. Our selective autoencoder is trained with expert-labeled microscopic images to learn unique features related to the invariant shapes and sizes of SCN eggs without any hand-crafting. The outcome is an efficient rare object detection framework which aids in automated high-throughput detection of the SCN eggs. The proposed framework reduces SCN eggs density estimation cost and expedites the overall phenotyping process significantly...|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} 62 populations of Heterodera glycines were {{collected}} in 10 states along the Mississippi and Missouri rivers, and 206 populations {{were collected in}} Arkansas. Among the 62 populations, races 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, and 14 were found south of 37 °N latitude, and races 1 and 3 were found north of 37 °N latitude. In Arkansas samples, races 2, 4, 5, 6, 9, and 14 comprised 87 % of the populations. In both groups of samples, H. glycines populations with genes that enabled the population to parasitize cv. Pickett occurred the most frequently, followed by those with genes for parasitism of cv. Peking, then PI 88. 788, and the fewest with genes for parasitism of PI 90. 763. The diversity of races in this study {{raises questions about the}} effectiveness of race-specific cultivars for the management of <b>soybean</b> <b>cyst</b> <b>nematodes.</b> The greater diversity of races of H. glycines in the southern United States may be because of a longer history of planting resistant cultivars...|$|R
40|$|Two {{subtraction}} libraries {{were prepared}} from RNA extracted at {{early and late}} stages {{in the development of}} <b>soybean</b> <b>cyst</b> <b>nematodes</b> (SCN), Heterodera glycines, in soybean roots. The cDNA from inoculated roots were subtracted with cDNA prepared from non-inoculated roots and SCN eggs, and 384 clones from each library were sequenced. BLAST searches revealed that 191 of the cDNA in the late library were most probably of nematode origin. Alignment of the 191 sequences produced 28 unigenes and 1 singlet. The size of the transcripts for the nematode genes was confirmed by RNA blot hybridization. Thirteen SCN transcripts were selected for further study because they included short open reading frames encoding predicted proteins of < 20 kDa with signal peptides at their amino-terminus. Ten of the 13 encode predicted peptides < 10 kDa. Although most of the 13 transcripts were fairly abundant in the SCN dbEST, most were of unknown function based on BLAST similarities. Nevertheless, several had characteristics common to anti-microbial peptides, and in situ hybridization indicated that three of the selected transcripts were expressed in the female reproductive system...|$|R
50|$|The <b>soybean</b> <b>cyst</b> <b>{{nematode}}</b> (SCN), Heterodera glycines, is a {{plant-parasitic nematode}} and a devastating pest of the soybean (Glycine max) worldwide. The nematode infects {{the roots of}} soybean, and the female nematode eventually becomes a cyst. Infection causes various symptoms that may include chlorosis of the leaves and stems, root necrosis, loss in seed yield and suppression of root and shoot growth. SCN has threatened the U.S. crop since the 1950s, reducing returns to soybean producers by $500 million each year and reducing yields {{by as much as}} 75 percent. It is also a significant problem in the soybean growing areas of South America and Asia.|$|E
50|$|Control {{of plant}} {{diseases}} {{is crucial to}} the reliable production of food, and it provides significant reductions in agricultural use of land, water, fuel and other inputs. Plants in both natural and cultivated populations carry inherent disease resistance, but there are numerous examples of devastating plant disease impacts (see Irish potato famine, chestnut blight), as well as recurrent severe plant diseases (see rice blast, <b>soybean</b> <b>cyst</b> <b>nematode,</b> citrus canker). However, disease control is reasonably successful for most crops. Disease control is achieved by use of plants that have been bred for good resistance to many diseases, and by plant cultivation approaches such as crop rotation, use of pathogen-free seed, appropriate planting date and plant density, control of field moisture, and pesticide use. Across large regions and many crop species, it is estimated that diseases typically reduce plant yields by 10% every year in more developed settings, but yield loss to diseases often exceeds 20% in less developed settings. Continuing advances in the science of plant pathology are needed to improve disease control, and to keep up with changes in disease pressure caused by the ongoing evolution and movement of plant pathogens and by changes in agricultural practices. Plant diseases cause major economic losses for farmers worldwide. The Food and Agriculture Organization estimates indeed that pests and diseases are responsible for about 25% of crop loss. To solve this issue, new methods are needed to detect diseases and pests early, such as novel sensors that detect plant odours and spectroscopy and biophotonics that are able to diagnostic plant health and metabolism.|$|E

40|$|<b>Soybean</b> <b>cyst</b> <b>nematodes</b> (Heterodera glycines) produce {{secreted}} effector {{proteins that}} function as peptide mimics of plant CLAVATA 3 /ESR (CLE) -like peptides probably {{involved in the}} developmental reprogramming of root cells to form specialized feeding cells called syncytia. The site of action and mechanism of delivery of CLE effectors to host plant cells by the nematode, however, have not been established. In this study, immunologic, genetic and biochemical approaches were used to reveal the localization and site of action of H. glycines-secreted CLE proteins in planta. We present evidence indicating that the nematode CLE propeptides are delivered to the cytoplasm of syncytial cells, but ultimately function in the apoplast, consistent with their proposed role as ligand mimics of plant CLE peptides. We determined that the nematode 12 -amino-acid CLE motif peptide is not sufficient for biological activity in vivo, pointing to an important role for sequences upstream of the CLE motif in function. Genetic and biochemical analysis confirmed the requirement of the variable domain in planta for host-specific recognition and revealed a novel role in trafficking cytoplasmically delivered CLEs to the apoplast in order to function as ligand mimics...|$|R
40|$|Few <b>soybean</b> <b>cyst</b> <b>nematodes</b> (SCN), Heterodera glycines, of {{a diverse}} gene pool {{developed}} into females on soybeans PI 89772 or PI 209332. Nematodes surviving the selection pressure were then inbred for nine generations by single cyst transfers {{on the same}} selecting soybean line. These nematodes appeared to tolerate concurrent selection and inbreeding. Effects of selection-inbreeding, selection only, and secondary selection were evaluated by relative ability to produce <b>cysts</b> on 11 <b>soybean</b> lines. The genetic differences of PI 89772 (also Peking and Pickett 71) and PI 209332 were reaffirmed. The random effects of inbreeding indicated that Ilsoy and Williams may have genes for resistance different from those in PI 89772 or PI 209332. Egg inoculum obtained from soil resulted in very few cysts in some tests. Fresh egg inoculum (from cysts on 27 - 30 -day-old plants) generally resulted in more cysts and more consistent results. Concurrent with the change in inoculum, {{there was a large}} increase in relative numbers of <b>cysts</b> on several <b>soybean</b> lines but no change on other lines; the true cause of this large interaction is unknown. Secondary selection of two inbreds was effective and suppressed cyst numbers on the line on which one inbred was selected initially.

40|$|In-vitro {{methods were}} {{developed}} to test fungi for production of metabolites affecting nematode egg hatch and mobility of second-stage juveniles. Separate assays were developed for two nematodes: root-knot nematode (Meloidogyne incognita) and <b>soybean</b> <b>cyst</b> <b>nematode</b> (Heterodera glycines). For egg hatch to be successfully assayed, eggs must first be surface-disinfested to avoid the confounding effects of incidental microbial growth facilitated by the fungal culture medium. Sodium hypochlorite was more effective than chlorhexidine diacetate or formaldehyde solutions at surface-disinfesting <b>soybean</b> <b>cyst</b> <b>nematode</b> eggs from greenhouse cultures. Subsequent rinsing with sodium thiosulfate to remove residual chlorine from disinfested eggs did not improve either <b>soybean</b> <b>cyst</b> <b>nematode</b> hatch or juvenile mobility. <b>Soybean</b> <b>cyst</b> <b>nematode</b> hatch in all culture media was lower than in water. Sodium hypochlorite was also used to surface-disinfest root-knot nematode eggs. In contrast to <b>soybean</b> <b>cyst</b> <b>nematode</b> hatch, root-knot nematode hatch was higher in potato dextrose broth medium than in water. Broth of the fungus Fusarium equiseti inhibited root-knot nematode egg hatch and was investigated in more detail.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to use a soybean crop model to estimate the difference in net return between variable–rate and uniform–rate management for soybean plant population and variety selection decisions. The CROPGRO–Soybean model was calibrated to fit three seasons of historical yield data in 77 grids within a 20 –ha field infested with <b>soybean</b> <b>cyst</b> <b>nematodes</b> (SCN) in central Iowa. Procedures were developed to compute the net return and break–even cost for variable plant population density and variety selection for SCN management using 34 years of historical weather data. Implementing the best population (VRX) for each year produced higher net returns compared to using the 34 –year average optimum rate (VRA) or using uniform management (UM). Achieving maximum possible net return under VRX may not be possible on a yearly basis due to uncertainties in weather condition. Risk–averse farmers, however, may opt to use the realistic 34 –year average optimum rate (VRA) that provides favorable net return over the long term. Procedures were also developed to determine gross profit and break–even costs for switching SCN–resistant and susceptible varieties within an SCN–infested field. Using an SCN–resistant variety across the entire field resulted in significant net returns over that of a susceptible variety, and there appeared to be no economic advantage for variable variety selection compared to planting a uniform resistant variety across the field...|$|R
40|$|Five viruses were {{previously}} discovered infecting <b>soybean</b> <b>cyst</b> <b>nematodes</b> (SCN; Heterodera glycines) from greenhouse cultures maintained in Illinois. In this study, the five viruses [ScNV, ScPV, ScRV, ScTV, and SbCNV- 5] were detected within SCN greenhouse and field populations from North Carolina (NC) and Missouri (MO). The prevalence and titers of viruses in SCN from 43 greenhouse cultures and 25 field populations {{were analyzed using}} qRT-PCR. Viral titers within SCN greenhouse cultures were similar throughout juvenile development, {{and the presence of}} viral anti-genomic RNAs within egg, second-stage juvenile (J 2), and pooled J 3 and J 4 stages suggests active viral replication within the nematode. Viruses were found at similar or lower levels within field populations of SCN compared with greenhouse cultures of North Carolina populations. Five greenhouse cultures harbored all five known viruses whereas in most populations a mixture of fewer viruses was detected. In contrast, three greenhouse cultures of similar descent to one another did not possess any detectable viruses and primarily differed in location of the cultures (NC versus MO). Several of these SCN viruses were also detected in Heterodera trifolii (clover cyst) and Heterodera schachtii (beet cyst), but not the other cyst, root-knot, or reniform nematode species tested. Viruses were not detected within soybean host plant tissue.

40|$|The soybean aphid (Aphis glycines Matsumura) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} insect pests of soybeans in the North-central region of the US. It has been hypothesized that aphids avoid effective defenses by inhibition of jasmonate-regulated plant responses. Given the role fatty acids play in jasmonate-induced plant defenses, we analyzed the fatty acid profile of soybean leaves and seeds from aphid-infested plants. Aphid infestation reduced levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids in leaves with a concomitant increase in palmitic acid. In seeds, a reduction in polyunsaturated fatty acids was associated with an increase in stearic acid and oleic acid. Soybean plants challenged with the brown stem rot fungus or with <b>soybean</b> <b>cyst</b> <b>nematodes</b> did not present changes in fatty acid levels in leaves or seeds, indicating that the changes induced by aphids are not a general response to pests. One of the polyunsaturated fatty acids, linolenic acid, is the precursor of jasmonate; thus, these changes in fatty acid metabolism may be examples of "metabolic hijacking" by the aphid to avoid the induction of effective defenses. Based on the changes in fatty acid levels observed in seeds and leaves, we hypothesize that aphids potentially induce interference in the fatty acid desaturation pathway, likely reducing FAD 2 and FAD 6 activity that leads to a reduction in polyunsaturated fatty acids. Our data support the idea that aphids block jasmonate-dependent defenses by reduction of the hormone precursor...|$|R
