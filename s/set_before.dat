5|$|Heyer's {{earliest}} {{works were}} romance novels, most <b>set</b> <b>before</b> 1800. In 1935, she released Regency Buck, {{her first novel}} set in the Regency period.

The books were set almost entirely {{in the world of}} the wealthy upper class and only occasionally mention poverty, religion, or politics.|$|E

5|$|Murray {{took the}} first set on a {{tie-break}} {{just as he had}} done in the US Open final the previous year, and while the second set followed a similar pattern with no breaks of serve, this time Djokovic took the tie-break.

The match lasted three hours and 40 minutes and four sets. By winning Djokovic won his sixth Grand Slam tournament title to tie him with greats such as Boris Becker and Stefan Edberg, whereas Murray equalled Edberg's feat of three runner-up finishes at the Australian Open.|$|E

The opening night concert was attended by about 300 local teenagers, but as the cellar had no air-conditioning, and people were dancing, the temperature rose until it became hard to breathe. After {{the success of the}} first night, Mona gave The Quarrymen a residency, and paid the whole group £3 a night. Every Saturday thereafter, queues lengthened onto the street, which was financially good for Mona, as she charged one shilling admission on top of the annual membership fee. As there was no amplification, Lennon later persuaded Mona to hire a young amateur guitar player called Harry to play a short <b>set</b> <b>before</b> The Quarrymen, but this was only so they could use his 40-Watt amplifier.|$|E

The only settings that had to be adjusted in flight were the measured wind direction and speed. The altitude, airspeed and course were all measured by the internal instruments and presented to the user in windows {{on the side of the}} computor case. Once set, the computor would automatically update the calculations and display the resulting bombing angle in another window. The computor could even account for steady changes in altitude, allowing the bomb run to take place in a shallow climb of up to 5 degrees or dive of up to 20 degrees.|$|E
