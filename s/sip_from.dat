25|$|However, the {{practice}} of playing with water has become increasingly common on college campuses, due to the cost saving effects. Instead of drinking the beer from a glass each time a player sinks a shot, the player simply takes a shot of liquor or a <b>sip</b> <b>from</b> their own drink each time the opposing team scores. This is usually done when there isn't enough beer to accommodate {{a large number of}} games during the party.|$|E
25|$|Members of this genus are leathery, {{tough to}} kill and fake death. Since they are {{unpleasant}} to smell and taste, they are soon released by the predators, recover and fly off soon thereafter. The butterfly sequesters toxins from its food plants of the family Asclepiadaceae. The butterflies also congregate with other danaiines to <b>sip</b> <b>from</b> the sap of Crotalaria, Heliotropium and other plants which provide the pyrrolizidine alkaloids which they sequester. A study in north-eastern India showed a preference to foraging on Crotalaria juncea compared to Bauhinia purpurea, Barleria cristata rosea and Nerium oleander. To advertise their unpalatability, the butterfly has prominent markings with a striking colour pattern. The striped tiger is mimicked by both sexes of the Indian Tamil lacewing (Cethosia nietneri mahratta) and the leopard lacewing (Cethosia cyane) and females of the common palmfly (Elymnias hypermnestra).|$|E
25|$|After {{leaving the}} library, Harris and Klebold entered the science area, where they threw {{a small fire}} bomb into an empty storage closet. It caused a fire, which was put out by a teacher hidden in an {{adjacent}} room. The duo proceeded toward the south hallway, where they shot into an empty science room. At approximately 11:44a.m., Harris and Klebold were captured on the school security cameras as they re-entered the cafeteria. The recording shows Harris kneeling on the landing and firing a single shot {{toward one of the}} propane bombs he and Klebold had earlier left in the cafeteria, in an unsuccessful attempt to detonate it. He took a <b>sip</b> <b>from</b> one of the drinks left behind as Klebold approached the propane bomb and examined it. Klebold lit a Molotov cocktail and threw it at the propane bomb. As the two left the cafeteria, the Molotov cocktail exploded, partially detonating one of the propane bombs at 11:46a.m. Two minutes later, approximately one gallon of fuel ignited in the same vicinity, causing a fire that was extinguished by the fire sprinklers.|$|E

500|$|Asch {{told his}} colleagues that his studies of {{conformity}} were informed by his childhood experiences in Poland. He recalled being {{seven years old}} and staying up for his first Passover night. He recalls seeing his grandmother pour an extra glass of wine. When he asked who the glass of wine was for, she {{said that it was}} for the prophet Elijah. He then asked her whether Elijah would really take a <b>sip</b> <b>from</b> the glass and his uncle assured him that he would. His uncle told him to watch very closely when the time came. [...] "Filled with a sense of suggestion and expectation" [...] Asch [...] "thought he saw the level of wine in the cup drop just a bit". Thus, early in life, Asch succumbed to social pressure, an experience which led him to investigate conformity later in life.|$|E
500|$|In 1971 {{he set up}} {{his first}} {{restaurant}} in Bristol—Floyd's Bistro—which proved popular {{enough for him to}} open three further outlets in the city. His burgeoning empire soon collapsed and he sailed around the Mediterranean for two years, from where he exported wine to the UK. He also opened a restaurant in the south of France, but this was also unsuccessful and it closed in 1979, when Floyd returned to the UK. He opened another Bristol-based restaurant and wrote a book—Floyd's Food—which was locally published in 1981; this led to a short recipe slot on the local Radio West station. In 1983 one of his customers—David Pritchard, a television producer—suggested to Floyd that he front a television series, which resulted in Floyd on Fish, broadcast on BBC Two in late 1985. Several series followed on the BBC before the Floyd-Pritchard partnership broke up in 1993; a corresponding book appeared with each series. There were no scripts for the programmes, and Floyd ad-libbed throughout; when he ran out of words, he would <b>sip</b> <b>from</b> an ever-present glass of wine to give him time to create the next line. Pritchard's directing style and Floyd's presentation technique produced what the food writer Tom Jaine considers as [...] "cheerful mayhem", although viewers were educated in basic techniques. He {{went on to say that}} [...] "Floyd's performances, on or near the stove, were a refreshing departure from the prissy, controlled style then in favour at the BBC, or the alternative mode of half an hour with a French chef whose incomprehensible English made the recipes a mystery." ...|$|E

2500|$|..... Greenstreet {{chatters}} {{about the}} falcon {{while waiting for}} a drugged drink to knock out Bogart. Huston's strategy is crafty. Earlier, Greenstreet has set it up by making a point: [...] "I distrust a man who says 'when.' If he's {{got to be careful}} not to drink too much, it's because he's not to be trusted when he does." [...] Now he offers Bogart a drink, but Bogart doesn't <b>sip</b> <b>from</b> it. Greenstreet talks on, and tops up Bogart's glass. He still doesn't drink. Greenstreet watches him narrowly. They discuss the value of the missing black bird. Finally, Bogart drinks, and passes out. The timing is everything; Huston doesn't give us closeups of the glass to underline the possibility that it's drugged. He depends on the situation to generate the suspicion in our minds.|$|E
