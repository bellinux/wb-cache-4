50|$|In 2007, Mavic {{introduced}} their R-Sys, a new bicycle spoke {{technology that}} allows the <b>spokes</b> <b>to</b> be loaded in both tension and compression. This technology is promised to allow for fewer spokes, lower wheel weight and inertia, increased wheel stiffness, with no loss of durability. However, in 2009 Mavic recalled R-Sys front wheels due <b>to</b> <b>spoke</b> failures leading <b>to</b> collapse of the entire wheel.|$|R
5000|$|Rotating {{wheel space}} stations, {{such as the}} Stanford torus, are wheel-like space station which produce {{artificial}} gravity by rotation. Typical designs include transport <b>spokes</b> <b>to</b> a central hub used for docking and/or micro-gravity research.|$|R

They also distributed sex-education pamphlets door to door.|$|E

5000|$|A good wheelbuilder {{will ensure}} that the valve hole lies between two nearly {{parallel}} <b>spokes</b> <b>to</b> ease attachment of a pump head. This {{does not affect the}} structural integrity of the wheel, and this rule is usually observed.|$|R
5|$|In 2007, the {{brothers}} <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> director Stephen Hopkins about {{moving forward with}} an adaptation again, but it became stuck in development hell. The Lunas were still in talks for an Ultra television project in 2011.|$|E

50|$|Mopeds {{occasionally}} resemble powered bicycles, {{more commonly}} called a motorized bicycle, though since ca. 2006 {{there has been}} a glut of engine kits shipped from China (although Tanaka had offered drive kits since the 1960s) designed in theory to transform a standard bicycle into a motor vehicle but lacking the benefit of proper brakes and lighting. In addition, the added stresses can cause the rear rim to warp, and the <b>spokes</b> <b>to</b> break, and if the engine is the least bit out of alignment the drive chain will come off the drive sprocket, causing the rim to warp and the <b>spokes</b> <b>to</b> break, as well as lodging the chain in the chainstay and causing injury to the operator.|$|R
50|$|Great {{attention}} {{was paid to}} producing an aerodynamically clean design: the tailskid was arranged so that its bungee cord springing was inside the fuselage, the wheels had disks covering the <b>spokes</b> <b>to</b> reduce drag, and the wing-warping control wires were carried inside the inverted-v cabane struts.|$|R
50|$|The {{rationale}} for the <b>spokes</b> <b>to</b> entering this system can be explained as minor powers may seeking alliances {{in order to increase}} security from military aggression. While major powers may be interested in alliances with minor powers, not to defend its own territory, but to extend their sphere of military and foreign influence.|$|R
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the attacks, some news reports mistakenly reported Shehri as a trained pilot and son of a Saudi diplomat, who was still alive and well. The Shehri family in Khamis Mushait <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> the media, denying those early reports, saying that the Shehri brothers had disappeared and have not been heard from since.|$|E
5|$|Mike Riley was {{selected}} as the referee for the match; the Yorkshire-based official and England's representative referee at Euro 2004 had sent off five players in his last six games.

5|$|Stiefel showed Heidemann {{the diary}} in Stuttgart in January 1980, telling {{him it was}} from a plane crash in East Germany, {{although}} he refused to tell the journalist {{the name of his}} source. The collector <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> Kujau to see if he would meet Heidemann, but the forger repeatedly refused Heidemann's requests for nearly a year. Heidemann returned to the Stern offices and <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> his editor, but both Koch and Nannen refused to discuss the potential story with him, telling him to work on other features. The only person who was interested was Walde, who worked with Heidemann to find the source of the diaries. Their searches for Kujau proved fruitless, so they looked into the crash. Heidemann, who had read Baur's autobiography, knew of Gundlfinger's flight, and made a connection between Operation Seraglio and the diary; in November 1980 the two journalists travelled to Dresden and located the graves of the flight's crew.|$|E
5|$|The rally began peacefully under a {{light rain}} {{on the evening of}} May 4. August Spies, Albert Parsons, and Samuel Fielden <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> a crowd {{estimated}} variously between 600 and 3,000 while standing in an open wagon adjacent to the square on Des Plaines Street. A large number of on-duty police officers watched from nearby.|$|E
5|$|A farmworker heard Jeremy leave around 9:30 pm. Barbara Wilson, the farm's secretary, telephoned Nevill {{at around}} that time, and {{was left with}} the {{impression}} that she had interrupted an argument. She said he was short with her and seemed to hang up in irritation, something he had never done before; he was by all accounts an even-tempered man. June Bamber's sister, Pamela Boutflour, telephoned around 10 pm. She <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> Sheila, who she said was quiet, then to June, who seemed normal.|$|E
