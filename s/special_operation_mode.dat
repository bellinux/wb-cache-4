30|$|Delay-based schemes {{have been}} used in several other works with the goal of {{reducing}} rebroadcast redundancy, e.g., [14 – 16]. In [14], the contention-based forwarding scheme (CBF) is presented. Authors focus on a distributed delay-based scheme for mobile ad hoc networks that requires no beaconing information. In [15], the urban multi-hop broadcast (UMB) protocol is designed to cope with broadcast storm, hidden node, and reliability problems of multi-hop broadcast in urban areas. UMB has a <b>special</b> <b>operation</b> <b>mode</b> for scenarios with intersections. Nevertheless, it relies on the same time slot principle for directional data dissemination.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the local container drayage problem under a <b>special</b> <b>operation</b> <b>mode</b> in which tractors and trailers can be separated; that is, tractors {{can be assigned}} to a new task at another location while trailers with containers are waiting for packing or unpacking. Meanwhile, the strategy of sharing empty containers between different customers is also considered to improve the efficiency and lower the operation cost. The problem is formulated as a vehicle routing and scheduling problem with temporal constraints. We adopt combinatorial benders’ cuts algorithm to solve this problem. Numerical experiments are performed {{on a group of}} randomly generated instances to test the performance of the proposed algorithm...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{discusses}} a {{case study}} in formal verification and development of secure smart card applications. An elementary Java Card electronic purse applet is presented whose specification can be simply formulated as “in normal operation, the applet’s balance field can only be decreased, never increased”. The applet features a challenge-response mechanism which allows legitimate terminals to increase the balance by putting the applet into a <b>special</b> <b>operation</b> <b>mode.</b> A systematic approach is used to guarantee a secure flow of control within the applet: appropriate transition properties are first formalized as a finite state machine, then incorporated in the specification, and finally formally verified using the Loop translation tool and the PVS theorem prover...|$|E

40|$|The {{supportive}} role of {{wind turbines}} during frequency drops {{is still not}} clear enough, {{although there are many}} proposed algorithms. Most of the offered techniques make the wind turbine deviates from optimum power generation <b>operation</b> to <b>special</b> <b>operation</b> <b>modes,</b> to guarantee the availability of reasonable power support, when the system suffers frequency deviations. This paper summarizes the most dominant support algorithms and derives wind turbine power curves for each one. It also conducts a comparison {{from the point of view}} of wasted energy, with respect to optimum power generation. The authors insure the advantage of a frequency support algorithm, they previously presented, as it achieved lower amounts of wasted energy. This analysis is performed in two locations that are promising candidates for hosting wind farms in Egypt. Additionally, two different types of wind turbines from two different manufacturers are integrated. Matlab and Simulink are the implemented simulation environments...|$|R
30|$|In this paper, we have {{presented}} fundamental functionality for video {{cameras in the}} form of various forms of exposure (level) control. Camera level control is very important since it provides a basis for all the subsequent image processing algorithms and is a prerequisite for a good image quality. Moreover, we claim that a good level control is at least as important as all the other subsequent stages of the image processing chain. We have given a comprehensive overview of the complete level-control processing chain for video cameras. The overview involves metering techniques, types of measurements used for exposure control, control methods, and strategies, and we wrappedup the level control with <b>special</b> control <b>operation</b> <b>modes.</b>|$|R
40|$|At today's free-electron lasers, {{high-resolution}} electron bunch {{arrival time}} measurements {{have become increasingly}} more important in fast feedback systems providing accurate timing stability for time-resolved pump-probe experiments and seeding schemes. At FLASH and the upcoming European XFEL a reliable and precise arrival time detection down to the femtosecond level has to cover {{a broad range of}} bunch charges, which may even change from 1 nC down to 20 pC within a bunch train. This is fulfilled by arrival time monitors which employ an electro-optical detection scheme by means of synchronised ultra-short laser pulses. At both facilities, the new bunch arrival time monitor has to cope with the <b>special</b> <b>operation</b> <b>mode</b> where the MHz repetition rate bunch train is separated into several segments for different SASE beam lines. Each of the segments will exhibit individual timing jitter characteristics since they are generated from different injector lasers and can be accelerated with individual energy gain settings. In this paper, we describe the recent improvements of the electro-optical unit developed for the bunch arrival time monitors to be installed in both facilities...|$|E
40|$|In modern free {{electron}} laser facilities like FLASH and European XFEL a high resolution intra train bunch arrival time measurement is mandatory, providing a crucial information for the beam based feedback system. At FLASH and European XFEL a reliable arrival time detection with a resolution better than 0. 1 % is required for {{a broad range of}} bunch charges, from 1 nC down to 20 pC. The system developed is based on electro-optical sampling where an ultra-short pulsed laser is employed. Several bunch arrival time monitors (BAM) were developed and are since 2012 in operation at the FLASH facility. A major upgrade involved the development of new hardware and software based on the MTCA standard. <b>Special</b> <b>operation</b> <b>mode</b> at both facilities includes the possibility to subdivide the bunch train in up to three segments, each with different bunch energy and charge, causing variation of the time jitter within the bunch train itself. A further upgrade includes the measurement of the arrival time and application of delay correction {{for each of the three}} segments. In this poster, we describe the development, installation and commissioning of the hardware, firmware and software of the new system...|$|E
30|$|Deployment of a {{dense network}} of {{observation}} stations capable of high {{spatial and temporal}} resolutions simultaneously will enable the detailed characteristics of these coseismic disturbance propagations to be recorded, such as the propagation velocity change with time. One such candidate would be the Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN), which is a network of HF radars (see reviews by Greenwald et al. (1995) and Chisham et al. (2007)). The SuperDARN Hokkaido radar (Nishitani and Ogawa, 2005) {{is the only one}} located in Japan, and has monitored ionospheric disturbances since December 2006. The 2011 Tohoku Earthquake, M = 9.0, started at 0546 UT on 11 March, 2011, with its epicenter at (38.1 °N, 142.9 °E) according to the Japan Meteorological Agency ([URL] Fortuitously, when the coseismic ionospheric disturbances reached the field of view of the SuperDARN Hokkaido radar, it was operating in a special mode such that the radar acquired the data along one specific beam direction every 8 s. Using data taken in this <b>special</b> <b>operation</b> <b>mode,</b> it is possible to discuss the propagation characteristics of the co-seismic ionospheric disturbance with a very high temporal resolution, with the field of view including the region not covered by the GPS receiver network. In this paper, we report on the initial results of the ionospheric disturbances observed by the SuperDARN Hokkaido radar after the 2011 off the Pacific coast of Tohoku Earthquake (hereafter referred to as the 2011 Tohoku Earthquake).|$|E
