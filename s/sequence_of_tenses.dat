40|$|To acquire <b>Sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>Tense</b> (temporal {{simultaneity}} {{between a}} matrix and an embedded past tense), {{there are two}} aspects the child has to learn: the structural nature {{of the relation between}} the two tenses and the nature <b>of</b> these <b>tenses</b> themselves. The goal of the present study is to see how Italian learners develop their interpretation <b>of</b> embedded <b>tenses,</b> in particular, if both these aspects are used by the learner in determining <b>Sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>Tense,</b> or, if not, which comes in first. The nature of the structural relation is formulated as the Complementation Hypothesis; the nature of the contribution of the semantics <b>of</b> <b>tense</b> is laid down in the Imperfectivity Hypothesis.

40|$|Complementation {{structures}} {{consist of}} a complex clause with a main verb that selects an embedded clause as its direct object. The structural and semantic properties of complementation are topic of many syntactic and semantic theories. Studies address {{a wide variety of}} syntactic and semantic constructions: long-distance movement and barrierhood, point-of-view phenomena such as direct versus indirect speech and <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>tense,</b> factivity, opacity, true versus false complements under verbs of saying and mental verbs. There is also a large body of research on the acquisition of complementation in the generative tradition. It goes back to the 80 ’s when researchers investigated long-distance wh-movement in children (De Villiers, Roeper & Vainikka, 1990; van Kampen, 1997; Oiry, 2008; Thornton, 1990). Other acquisition of complementation phenomena include: direct versus indirect speech (Hollebrandse, 2007), <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>tense</b> (Hollebrandse, 2000; Lungu, 2012), factivity (Schulz, 2003); referential opacity (De Villiers & Fitneva, 1996; De Villiers, 2001), and true versus false complements (De Villiers & Pyers, 2002). The tradition continues up until today, witness recent work on double embedding (De Villiers, Hobbs & Hollebrandse, in press; Hollebrandse, Hobbs, De Villiers & Roeper, 2008; Hollebrandse & Roeper, under review). The core question in this research tradition is: When do children acquire the properties of complementation?

On traditional tense analyses, the simultaneous construals in SOT languages arise via a “null” (past) tense, while in non-SOT languages, simultaneous construals arise via either a “null” tense (Japanese) or a “shifted indexical” present tense (Russian).

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{acquisition}} <b>of</b> dependent <b>tenses.</b> More specifically, {{it focuses on}} <b>Sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>Tense.</b> This refers to the ability in some languages to report on an utterance with a direct speech in which a present tense is used (“I am happy”) with an indirect speech report in which a past tense is used (“John said he was happy”). Complementation plays crucial role in making the embedded tense depended on the matrix one. Therefore, the child first has to acquire complementation, i. e., the link between a main clause and a complement. If the child hasn 2 ̆ 7 t acquired complementation yet, {{he or she will}} not have independent tenses in this case. This thesis shows this hypothesis experimentally for three languages: English, Dutch and Japanese. The findings are that there is a stage, up to 4 years in which the child allows more readings, than adults. He or she can have “future” oriented readings, such as forward shifted readings as long as they occur before the utterance time of the sentence. They are explained by the child 2 ̆ 7 s lack of knowledge of complementation. Moreover, the linguistic phenomenon <b>of</b> <b>Sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>Tense</b> is compared with a cognitive phenomenon, the development of a Theory of Mind. This phenomenon refers to the ability of expressing someone else 2 ̆ 7 s beliefs or thoughts without committing oneself to that belief or thought. A form of complementation is crucial in both phenomena. This thesis argues that complementation is acquired through the understanding of the difference in point of view between direct and indirect speech is what the child has to acquire. For instance, first person pronouns refer to the speaker of a sentence in indirect speech, but to the main clause subject in direct speech. Finally, this thesis extends the idea of the importance of point of view differences to the domain of wh-extraction in direct speech. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} I discuss the {{syntactic}} {{properties of the}} Italian subjunctive and their relevance at the syntax/semantics interface.

I show that such properties systematically correlate with the interpretation assigned to the embedded clause, i. e., with the presence or absence of the double access reading. I argue that when the embedded clause has a double access interpretation, it contains a projection that is read off at the interface as pointing to the speaker’s temporal coordinate. In the other, non-double access cases, such a projection is absent and therefore the speaker’s coordinate does not intervene in the temporal interpretation of the embedded clause...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a contrastive study of habitual constructions in Slavic and Germanic, with particular {{focus on the}} verbal quantifiers byvalo in Russian and used to in English.

In both cases the embedded verb is semantically tenseless and dependent on (bound by) a matrix verbal quantifier. If this explanation is on the right track, it should probably not only cover habituals proper since the same temporal patterns are also observed with implicative verbs (“it happened”). Russian displays an interesting contrast between byvalo (habitual) byvalo, čto (implicative) – and in both cases present tense forms can be used in the embedded verbs. The empirical basis for the study was provided by the multilingual RuN-Euro parallel corpus.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} semantics <b>of</b> <b>tense</b> and the temporal interpretation <b>of</b> <b>tensed</b> and tenseless predicates in natural language. The central question {{we are concerned}} with is whether natural language employs explicit quantification over times in the object language. Our {{answer to the question}} is “yes, but to a limited extent. ” We argue (i) that the evaluation time <b>of</b> <b>tense</b> operators is represented by what we call the distinguished time variable, and (ii) that the event time <b>of</b> simple <b>tensed</b> predicates is represented by tense morphemes. Tense morphemes are analyzed as temporal variables that saturate the time argument slot of the predicates they are affixed to. As a consequence, the proposal implies that the event time <b>of</b> <b>tensed</b> predicates is realized in syntax as a temporal variable while the event time of tenseless predicates is not. Evidence for this distinction is provided from the temporal interpretation of nouns, differences between the temporal interpretations of relative clauses and participles, and cross-linguistic differences regarding the temporal interpretation of relative clauses. Evidence for explicit quantification over the evaluation times <b>of</b> <b>tense</b> operators is also provided from the <b>tense</b> interpretation <b>of</b> relative clauses, and from cross-linguistic differences regarding the distribution <b>of</b> <b>tense</b> and its interpretation in temporal adjunct clauses. ^ The introductory Chapter 1 presents background assumptions and reviews the previous literature. Cross-linguistic data regarding tense in relative clauses and temporal adjunct clauses are also introduced. Special attention is paid to a previously relatively unnoticed difference among languages that do not exhibit the so-called <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>tense</b> phenomena, such as Japanese, Polish, and Russian. In Chapter 2, a theory <b>of</b> <b>tense</b> is proposed that employs explicit quantification over times. The temporal interpretation of relative clauses and participle constructions in English, Japanese, Polish, and Russian is examined. Cross-linguistic differences are shown to follow from the proposed tense system and structural differences in relative clauses among these languages. Chapter 3 examines the distribution <b>of</b> <b>tense</b> and its interpretation in temporal adjunct clauses. Again, cross-linguistic differences are derived from our proposal regarding the tense system in conjunction with differences in the structure of temporal adjunct clauses. ...|$|R
