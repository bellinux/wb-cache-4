50|$|Carl N. Hodges is an American {{atmospheric}} physicist {{and founder of}} the Seawater foundation. He is the main driving force behind ideas of using <b>sea</b> <b>canals</b> to irrigate deserts.|$|E
50|$|To speed transit {{between the}} Baltic and the North <b>Sea,</b> <b>canals</b> {{have been built}} across the peninsula, notably the Eider Canal in the late 18th century and the Kiel Canal, {{completed}} in 1895 and still in use.|$|E
50|$|Many notable <b>sea</b> <b>canals</b> were {{completed}} in this period, {{starting with the}} Suez Canal (1869) - which carries tonnage many times that of most other canals - and the Kiel Canal (1897), though the Panama Canal was not opened until 1914.|$|E

50|$|The {{idea is to}} grow sea {{farms in}} the {{artificial}} <b>sea</b> <b>canals</b> using plants like salicornia and mangrove, and introducing fish and shrimp. This {{is thought to be}} able to resurrect ecosystems, create jobs, wealth and food sources. This has been proposed as a solution for starvation and even being able to counter the effects of global warming and rising sea levels.|$|E
50|$|Many {{activities}} {{take place}} in cafes, pubs, churches, and clubs. The residents keep their window blinds open at home in celebration of long lasting peace, but are otherwise protective of privacy. Most religious activities of Delfzijl are in the Dutch Protestant Established (Hervormde Kerk) or Reformed (Gereformeerde Kerk) churches, with notable minorities active in Catholic, Lutheran, and Baptist churches. Most of the churches in Delfzijl are joined together in local and national organizations, although they retain much of their individual character. Salvation army is also active and included in the churches organization. A number of national holidays are celebrated each year, the biggest are Christmas, Easter, and the King's Birthday. Sports facilities are available and boating is popular in the <b>sea,</b> <b>canals,</b> and near by lakes.|$|E
40|$|Harmful Algal Blooms (HAB) {{are complex}} to manage {{due to their}} {{intermittent}} nature and their severe impact {{on the economy and}} human health. The conditions which promote HAB have not yet been fully explained, though climate change and anthropogenic intervention are pointed as significant factors. The rise of water temperature, the opening of new <b>sea</b> <b>canals</b> and the introduction of ship ballast waters all contribute to the dispersion and establishment of toxin-producing invasive species that promote the settling of emergent toxins in the food-chain. Tetrodotoxin, ciguatoxin, palytoxin and cyclic imines are commonly reported in warm waters but have also caused poisoning incidents in temperate zones. There is evidence that monitoring for these toxins exclusively in bivalves is simplistic and underestimates the risk to public health, since new vectors have been reported for these toxins and as well for regulated toxins such as PSTs and DSTs. In order to avoid public health impacts, {{there is a need for}} adequate monitoring programs, a need for establishing appropriate legislation, and a need for optimizing effective methods of analysis. In this review, we will compile evidence concerning emergent marine toxins and provide data that may indicate the need to restructure the current monitoring programs of HAB...|$|E

40|$|Artists of the XVII Provinces contributed {{considerably}} to cartography. For instance, Peter Pourbus, a Bruges painter, is {{the author}} of maps of Zeeland and of the Zwin Region, an area that Emperor Charles V (1500 - 1577) was anxious to protect against a seaborne enemy invasion. The coastal areas of Flanders and Zeeland were repeatedly covered, in prehistoric, protohistoric, and historic times, by the North Sea waters. The storm of the 13 th century broke through continental barriers, opening a channel whose draught allowed ships to sail up to such towns as Sluis, Damme, and Hoek, sites that became, for several centuries, outer harbors of Bruges. The trade thus generated is at the origin of Bruges's wealth, leading to the Zwin inlet being nicknamed the "Golden Inlet. " Sadly, silting set in and occlusion of the inlet progressed inexorably. This benefited Antwerp, which took up the declining trade of Bruges. The richest city of northwestern Europe yielded thus to a sister city that would be, for several centuries, the largest city of the world. The Zwin inlet is today just a natural swimming pool. And at high tide a rivulet of water allows some canoes to manoeuver. On the other hand, the region became a world-celebrated bird and plant natural refuge. Yet Bruges, like the phoenix reemerged from ashes, is again a ranking port, thanks to <b>sea</b> <b>canals</b> linking it to the sea and an artificial harbor (Zeebrugge) some 20 km south of the Zwin inlet's mouth, in full expansion. On the shoreline, erosion and sedimentation have brought about new modifications, some of which impact faunal presence, while others might trigger a political "tempest in a teapot. ...|$|E
