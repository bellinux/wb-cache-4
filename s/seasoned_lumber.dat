50|$|A new smaller mill {{was erected}} and the {{operations}} continued. When the depression struck, Pakesley Lumber Co. decided {{to continue to}} operate and ride out the market slump. With more than 40000000 ft of <b>seasoned</b> <b>lumber</b> stockpiled at Pakesley, the mill was forced to shut down in 1933. The stock was sold off at less than wholesale prices. The mill was dismantled and sold and the rails of the Key Valley Railway were lifted in 1935.|$|E
50|$|With {{more than}} 40,000,000 feet of <b>seasoned</b> <b>lumber</b> stockpiled at Pakesley in 1933, all {{operations}} of the lumber company and the railway ceased. The lumber was disposed of and the rails of the Key Valley Railway were lifted by 1935 and the sawmill was removed by 1938. The only building that stands today is the old school house, still used as a hunt camp and cottage. It is located on Highway 522, east of Highway 69.|$|E
60|$|Then I {{went on to}} {{tell him}} about the method of the farmer. He usually had a small piece of forest, mostly hard wood. When the snow was on he cut firewood, fence-rails, and lumber for his own use in building. Some <b>seasons</b> <b>lumber</b> brought high prices; then he would select matured logs and haul them to the sawmill. But he would not cut a great deal, and he would use care in the selection. It was his aim to keep the land well covered with forest. He would sow as well as harvest.|$|R
50|$|Over {{the next}} three <b>seasons,</b> the <b>Lumber</b> Kings {{continued}} to develop under Keefe, and culminated in three more championships for the Pembroke club. Each year, the team was eliminated in the Fred Page Cup and failed {{to qualify for the}} Royal Bank Cup.|$|R
50|$|Individual Highlights {{from the}} 2010 <b>Season</b> {{included}} Brodie <b>Lumber</b> winning the Senior League Goalkicking with 70 goals, Martin McKenzie winning the Reserves League Goalkicking with 76 goals {{as well as}} coming Runner-Up in the McKenzie Medal, A Grade Netballer Shelley Wilson winning the League Best and Fairest and Under 15 Netballer Jenna Smith also winning the League Best and Fairest.|$|R
60|$|There is a lumberer's road {{called the}} Eagle Lake Road from the Seboois {{to the east}} side of this lake. It may seem strange that any road through such a {{wilderness}} should be passable, even in winter, but at that <b>season,</b> wherever <b>lumbering</b> operations are actively carried on, teams are continually passing on the single track, and it becomes as smooth almost as a railway. I am told that in the Aroostook country the sleds are required by law to be of one width, four feet, and sleighs must be altered to fit the track, so that one runner may go in one rut and the other follow the horse. Yet it is very bad turning out.|$|R
5000|$|It has {{no major}} {{businesses}} {{apart from a}} moderate sized lumber business owned and run {{by a number of}} brothers from the same family. When the <b>lumber</b> <b>season</b> is quiet it just so happens to be the season for blueberries which is big business. Athol has a very small population. The school line for Parrsboro Regional High School and River Hebert District High School is located in Athol. The Little Forks Road, and the Athol Road, two major roads leading to Springhill, Nova Scotia, start in Athol. Athol is located on the Maccan River. The nearest [...] "town" [...] to Athol for grocery shopping is Amherst which provides stores including A&W, Tim Hortons, Sobeys, and Walmart Canada ...|$|R
50|$|As the 2010-2011 CCHL <b>season</b> began, the <b>Lumber</b> Kings {{were seeking}} a fifth {{straight}} league championship under Keefe's reign. The Lumber Kings went 51-9-2-2 {{and entered the}} postseason ranked 7th in Canada. After going undefeated through the first two rounds, they met the Cornwall Colts in the CCHL final. A hard-fought series saw the Lumber Kings prevail in six games to claim a fifth straight league championship, becoming the first team in league history to do so. The team proceeded to emerge victorious at the Fred Page Cup in a victory over the Longeuil College Francais and advanced to the Royal Bank Cup {{to compete for the}} national championship. After eliminating the Camrose Kodiaks in the semi-final, they met the Vernon Vipers to decide the Royal Bank Cup. The Vipers were seeking a third straight national title, and the Lumber Kings were looking for their first in the treasured history of the club. Keefe's squad battled to a 2-0 victory to become the 2011 Royal Bank Cup Champions.|$|R
