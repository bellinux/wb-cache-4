50|$|There {{has also}} been major {{investment}} in audio visual equipment. The Lecture Theatre {{is equipped with a}} large high-definition video screen, with multiple input vision mixing functionality, six channel surround sound, a 48 channel <b>sound</b> <b>mixing</b> <b>console</b> with ethernet-based connectivity and high end loudspeakers. The Main Hall has a large, motorised lighting rig, lighting console, high-definition video screen, 48 channel <b>sound</b> <b>mixing</b> <b>console,</b> theatre-style technical communications system and pre-wired audio, visual, lighting control and ethernet connectivity. The Recording Studio is based around an Avid C|24 control surface and personal computer running Pro Tools.|$|E
5000|$|The {{projectors}} often are: 16 mm film movie projector, a 35 mm {{slide projector}} and a 35 mm film movie projector. In low-end use {{the motion picture}} 35 mm projector would {{be replaced by a}} second 16 mm projector or 8 mm film, or Super 8 mm film or Single-8 projector. The multiplexer with the camera and projectors surrounding it would often be called a film island. The optical or mag or magnetic strip soundtrack on the motion picture would be picked up by the projector and would be fed to an audio <b>sound</b> <b>mixing</b> <b>console</b> or to the VTR. (See: Sound-on-film, Film sound, and 35 mm sound.) ...|$|E
50|$|All Spirit DataCines use {{continuous}} transport motion, using a capstan and constant film tension. An optional optic audio, pick up {{system can be}} mounted in the capstan. All Spirit DataCines use a xenon lamp for illumination into a diffusion chamber to minimize dust and scratch visibility. With the standard 35mm lens gate: super 35 mm and academy 35 mm are supported. Also 2, 3, 4, perf are supported. VistaVision 8-perf and 6 perf are an option. The unit comes with select-a-speed, this gives the section of a film speeds from 2.00 frames per second to 57.00 fps in SDTV and 2.00 to 31.00 fps in HDTV interlace format. With the optional 16mm lens gate standard 16mm and Super 16 mm are supported. With the 16mm lens gate an optional Super 8 mm film gate can be added. 16mm audio system also support 16mm mag or magnetic strip sound track on the motion picture would {{be picked up by}} a head and could be fed to an audio <b>sound</b> <b>mixing</b> <b>console</b> or to the VTR.|$|E
50|$|An aux-send (auxiliary send) is an {{electronic}} signal-routing output used on multi-channel <b>sound</b> <b>mixing</b> <b>consoles</b> used in recording and broadcasting settings and on PA system amplifier-mixers used in music concerts. The {{signal from the}} auxiliary send is often routed through outboard audio processing effects units (e.g., reverb) {{and then returned to}} the mixer using an auxiliary return input jack, thus creating an effects loop. This allows effects to be added to an audio source or channel within the <b>mixing</b> <b>console.</b>|$|R
50|$|DMX512-A uses {{a single}} pair of conductors, so can be {{connected}} using the cheaper 3-pin XLR connectors. Some manufacturers made units with three-pin XLR connectors, {{because of their}} lower cost. However, as 3-pin XLRs are commonly used for connecting microphones and <b>sound</b> <b>mixing</b> <b>consoles,</b> there is then a risk of wrongly connecting DMX512 equipment to microphones and other sound equipment. The +48 volt phantom power emitted by <b>mixing</b> <b>consoles</b> could damage DMX512 equipment if connected to it. The DMX512 signals emitted by lighting desks can damage microphones and other sound equipment if connected to it. Hence best practice is to use only 5-pin XLRs for DMX512 signals, to avoid risk of confusion with connectors used for sound signals.|$|R
50|$|The {{multicore}} cable {{runs from the}} stage box or microphone splitter {{and then to the}} front-of-house <b>sound</b> desk or <b>mixing</b> <b>console.</b> Permanent installations have stage boxes mounted in the floor or side of stage and the plenum cable runs through the ceiling or false floor to the console, located either in the auditorium or the bio-box.|$|R
5000|$|In 1973, Dudderidge and Blyth left RSD to form [...] Soundcraft Electronics, Ltd., {{the company}} specializing in live <b>sound</b> and {{recording}} <b>mixing</b> <b>consoles.</b> Dudderidge's involvement with this company {{also led to}} his working with notable pro audio industry figures Betty Bennett (now CEO of [...] Apogee Electronics Corporation), Wayne Freeman (of Trident USA, Fairlight, Amek, Otari, and most notably Marshall Electronics), and Shane Morris (designer of the ATI Paragon monitor console and later of PRS Guitars). 15 years later, in 1988, Soundcraft, firmly established as a leading console brand, was sold to Harman International Industries.|$|R
50|$|VENUE is a {{brand of}} live <b>sound</b> digital <b>mixing</b> <b>consoles</b> {{introduced}} by Digidesign in February 2005. The family now includes three different consoles {{and a number of}} ways they can be configured. They can all be connected to Pro Tools, the audio editing software also created by Avid/Digidesign, to provide recording and 'Virtual Soundcheck' facilities. One of the system's key marketing points is its use of the same TDM plugins as Pro Tools, an industry standard digital audio workstation (DAW). This is designed to enable the sounds recorded by the artist in the studio to be easily recreated on stage, and to allow for greater flexibility in signal processing without heavy and mechanical-shock-sensitive racks of external processors. There is also a PC-based offline editor for creation and editing of show files, although there is no audio processing in the editor.|$|R
5000|$|In most mid- to large-size venues, {{there is}} a {{separate}} <b>sound</b> engineer and <b>mixing</b> <b>console</b> on or beside the stage creating a mix for the monitor system. The monitor mix is often different from the [...] "front of house" [...] mix, because performers may request to hear more of certain accompaniment or rhythm section instruments. In the most sophisticated and expensive monitor set-ups, each onstage performer can ask the sound engineer for a separate monitor mix for separate monitors. For example, the lead singer can ask to hear mostly her/his voice in the monitor in front of her/him and the guitarist can ask to hear mostly the bassist and drummer in her/his monitor.|$|R
50|$|In the 2010s, many {{professional}} {{bands and}} major venues use digital <b>mixing</b> <b>consoles</b> that have automated controls and a digital memory for previous settings. The settings of previous shows {{can be saved}} and recalled in the console and a band can start playing with a limited <b>sound</b> check. Automated <b>mixing</b> <b>consoles</b> are a great time saver for concerts where a main band is preceded by several support acts. Using an automated console, the engineer can record the settings that each band asks for during their individual soundchecks. Then, during the concert, the engineer can call up the settings from memory, and the faders will automatically move to the position that they were placed in during the soundcheck. On a larger scale, technical rehearsals may {{be held in the}} days or weeks leading up to a concert. These rehearsals are used to fine-tune the many technical aspects (such as lighting, sound, video) associated with a live performance.|$|R
5000|$|A board mix is a {{recording}} created by running lines directly off a <b>mixing</b> <b>console</b> while <b>sound</b> is <b>mixed</b> in real time. [...] The {{alternative to a}} board mix is use a virtual <b>mixing</b> <b>console,</b> an increasingly popular approach.|$|R
50|$|A {{public address}} system (PA system) is a sound {{amplification}} system used to allow a person or persons to address an audience at a greater volume than would be possible or practicable without such a system. At a minimum, such a system comprises a microphone, an amplifier and a loudspeaker. Examples of content include announcements and other audio material at sports stadiums, air and rail terminals, and the sound produced by a singer, musician or musical ensemble, as well as recorded music. A PA system may include multiple microphones and/or other <b>sound</b> sources, a <b>mixing</b> <b>console</b> to combine and modify multiple sources, and multiple amplifiers and loudspeakers for louder volume, greater coverage and/or wider distribution, such as that required to provide sound throughout an entertainment venue, an office building or retail space, or an outdoor environment.|$|R
5000|$|In live <b>sound</b> <b>mixing</b> {{the front}} of house <b>mixing</b> <b>console</b> often {{includes}} a matrix mixer section for optimizing the blend of sound going to various locations in the performance space. Subgroups, auxiliary mixes, submixes or even the main outputs are routed through the matrix mixer to different loudspeaker zones, making the matrix essentially a [...] "mix of mixes". A front-of-house matrix may be used at a concert to switch between the headliner's and the opening act's <b>mixing</b> <b>consoles.</b> A matrix mixer feature may be included on analog or digital consoles. For instance, the Midas <b>Consoles</b> XL4 concert <b>mixing</b> <b>console</b> has a built-in 8×8 matrix summing 8 subgroups into 8 matrix outputs; the same basic module is available separately as the Midas XL88 (see photograph). The digital Yamaha M7CL <b>mixing</b> <b>console</b> is another such product; it has a 19×8 matrix section summing 16 mixes {{as well as the}} main left/right/mono outputs (see screenshot). In the classic analog monitor mixer without faders, the console is set up as a large matrix mixer with the addition of equalization filters and other controls for each input.|$|R
50|$|Live <b>sound</b> <b>mixing</b> is {{the process}} of {{electrically}} blending together multiple sound sources at a live event using a <b>mixing</b> <b>console.</b> <b>Sounds</b> used include those from instruments, voices, and pre-recorded material.

40|$|The most {{important}} design issue for digital audio <b>mixing</b> <b>consoles</b> is the communication concept, {{that is used}} to interconnect an array of signal processors. This paper demonstrates the implementation of a digital <b>mixing</b> <b>console</b> that is capable of routing up to 100 audio signalpaths. The audio algorithms are on a modular DSP network. Signalpaths can be edited with a graphical user interface and are automatically mapped on the DSP network with optimal load-balancing. 1 Introduction The typical architecture of a digital audio <b>mixing</b> <b>console</b> is shown in figure 1. The most obvious difference to an analog <b>mixing</b> <b>console</b> is the clear separation of mixing-desk and mixing-engine. The mixing-engine performs the digital signal processing and is completely controlled by the mixing-desk. A digital <b>mixing</b> <b>console</b> can be described as a network of signal-paths where a large number of digital audio functions are combined. Each function has to process some input signals and produces some output [...] ...|$|R
