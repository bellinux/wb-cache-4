5|$|The European Food <b>Safety</b> <b>Authority</b> (EFSA) {{refers to}} the {{collective}} set of information as Dietary Reference Values, with Population Reference Intake (PRI) instead of RDA, and Average Requirement instead of EAR. AI and UL defined {{the same as in}} United States. For women and men ages 15 and older the AI is set at 65 μg/day. AI for pregnancy is 65 μg/day, for lactation also 65 μg/day. For children ages 1–14 years the AIs increase with age from 15 to 45 μg/day. The adult AIs are higher than the U.S. RDAs. The European Food <b>Safety</b> <b>Authority</b> reviewed the same safety question and set its UL at 600 μg/day, which is much lower than the U.S. value.|$|E

5|$|In the United States, {{the dietary}} {{guidelines}} for daily chromium intake were lowered in 2001 from 50–200 µg {{for an adult}} to 35µg (adult male) and to 25µg (adult female). In 2014, the European Food <b>Safety</b> <b>Authority</b> published a report stating that the intake of chromium(III) has no beneficial effect on healthy people, thus the Panel removed chromium {{from the list of}} nutrients and essential elements.|$|E
5|$|The JACC is {{responsible}} for coordinating the search efforts for Flight 370 within Australian waters. At {{the time of the}} agency's creation, the search effort involved China, Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand, South Korea, United Kingdom, and the United States as well as several agencies of the Australian government: the Australian Maritime <b>Safety</b> <b>Authority</b> (AMSA), the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB), the Department of Defence, and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. The search activities also involved analysis of the flight's satellite communications by Inmarsat, the AAIB (UK), the NTSB (US), and other organisations.|$|E

40|$|The Nordic {{electrical}} <b>safety</b> <b>authorities</b> co-operate {{on issues}} related to electrical safety e. g. electrical accidents. Certain electrical accidents need to be reported to the electrical <b>safety</b> <b>authorities.</b> Deeper knowledge on Nordic electrical accidents was collected in this study. The aim {{of the study was}} to find ways to improve electrical safety in the Nordic Countries. Electrical safety problem areas, emerging risks and best practices were also studied. The Nordic electrical <b>safety</b> <b>authorities</b> do not have information on the total number of occurred electrical accidents because of under-reporting. Former studies have focused on electrical accidents in one Nordic Country and mainly on electrical accidents of electrical professionals. Electrical accidents from the year 2011 given by the Nordic electrical <b>safety</b> <b>authorities</b> were analyzed in this study. The material was divided into occupational electrical accidents of electrical professionals and those of laymen and leisure time electrical accidents. In addition, the representatives of the Nordic electrical <b>safety</b> <b>authorities</b> were interviewed on electrical accident information collection and electrical safety problem areas in this study. The Nordic electrical <b>safety</b> <b>authorities</b> have a bit different understanding of electrical accidents on the basis of the electrical accidents reported to them. The electrical accident material from the different Nordic Countries diversifies together the understanding. The material should be utilized in cooperation more effectively than nowadays in electrical accident prevention. The occupational electrical accidents of the electrical professionals resulted mostly from not obeying instructions and occupational electrical accidents of laymen from damaged electrical installations and products. It needs to be questioned how widely the causes were mentioned in the material. It seems that certain causes stand out in the electrical accident reports. Only few leisure time electrical accidents were reported to the electrical <b>safety</b> <b>authorities</b> in 2011 which complicated making conclusion of those accidents. Emerging risks connected mainly to the development of the technology. It needs always to be remembered that electrical accident prevention is continuous work...|$|R
30|$|Work <b>safety</b> <b>authorities</b> {{should set}} up a {{multilevel}} industrial explosion prevention system based on their mandate and monitoring procedures. Governments at all levels need to examine, monitor, and advise on the safety work of subordinate government levels, and make transparent their budgets and plans for work <b>safety.</b> Work <b>safety</b> <b>authorities</b> can regularly invite experts to conduct safety training programs, organize seminars, and provide {{advice on how to}} prevent industrial explosions.|$|R
5|$|The {{northern}} corridor {{was soon}} discounted {{and the focus}} of the search shifted to the Southern Indian Ocean, west of Australia and within Australia's concurrent aeronautical and maritime Search and Rescue (SAR) regions that extend to 75°E longitude. On 17 March, Australia agreed to lead the search in the southern locus from Sumatra to the southern Indian Ocean; the Australian Maritime <b>Safety</b> <b>Authority</b> (AMSA), Australia's search and rescue agency, initially coordinated the search within Australia's SAR region, correlating information with the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) and officials in Malaysia.|$|E
5|$|According to the European Food <b>Safety</b> <b>Authority</b> (EFSA), in 2007, the United Kingdom had 274,000 hives, Italy had 1,091,630, and France 1,283,810. In 2008, the British Beekeepers Association {{reported}} the bee {{population in the}} United Kingdom dropped by around 30% between 2007 and 2008, and an EFSA study revealed that in Italy the mortality rate was 40–50%. However, EFSA officials point out the figures are not very reliable because before the bees started dying, no harmonisation {{was used in the}} way different countries collected statistics on their bee populations. At that time (2008), the reports blamed the high death rate on the varroa mite, two seasons of unusually wet European summers, and some pesticides.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{concerns}} of long-term adverse side effects such as calcification of arteries and kidney stones, the U.S. Institute of Medicine (IOM) and the European Food <b>Safety</b> <b>Authority</b> (EFSA) both set Tolerable Upper Intake Levels (ULs) for {{the combination of}} dietary and supplemental calcium. From the IOM, people ages 9-18 years {{are not supposed to}} exceed 3,000 mg/day; for ages 19-50 not to exceed 2,500 mg/day; for ages 51 and older, not to exceed 2,000 mg/day. The EFSA set UL at 2,500 mg/day for adults but decided the information for children and adolescents was not sufficient to determine ULs.|$|E

5|$|In 1983, the {{government}} decided {{to select a}} site for permanent repository by 2010. With four nuclear reactors providing 29% of its electricity, Finland in 1987 enacted a Nuclear Energy Act making the producers of radioactive waste responsible for its disposal, subject to requirements of its Radiation and Nuclear <b>Safety</b> <b>Authority</b> and an absolute veto given to local governments in which a proposed repository would be located. Producers of nuclear waste organized the company Posiva, with responsibility for site selection, construction and operation of a permanent repository. A 1994 amendment to the Act required final disposal of spent fuel in Finland, prohibiting the import or export of radioactive waste.|$|E

AI and UL defined {{the same as in}} United States. For people ages 15 and older the AI is set at 3.0 mg/day. AIs for pregnancy and lactation is 3.0 mg/day. For children ages 1–14 years the AIs increase with age from 0.5 to 2.0 mg/day. The adult AIs are higher than the U.S. RDAs. The EFSA reviewed the same safety question and decided that there was insufficient information to set a UL.|$|E
5|$|The European Food <b>Safety</b> <b>Authority</b> (EFSA) {{refers to}} the {{collective}} set of information as Dietary Reference Values, with Population Reference Intake (PRI) instead of RDA, and Average Requirement instead of EAR. AI and UL defined {{the same as in}} United States. For people ages 18 and older the PRI calculations are complex, as the EFSA has set higher and higher values as the phytate content of the diet increases. For women, PRIs increase from 7.5 to 12.7 mg/day as phytate intake increases from 300 to 1200 mg/day; for men the range is 9.4 to 16.3 mg/day. These PRIs are higher than the U.S. RDAs. The EFSA reviewed the same safety question and set its UL at 25mg/day, which is much lower than the U.S. value.|$|E

50|$|Radiation <b>safety</b> <b>authorities</b> {{including}} the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements, The Health Physics Society and the American College of Radiology, {{have stated that}} there is no specific evidence that full-body scans are unsafe. The Secure 1000 Backscatter X-ray scanner was developed in 1992 by Dr. Steve Smith. The scanner has been studied extensively for almost 20 years by the leading independent radiation <b>safety</b> <b>authorities</b> in the United States. Experimental and epidemiological data do not support the proposition, however, that there is a threshold dose of radiation below which there is no increased risk of cancer.|$|R

5|$|On 17 March, Australia {{took control}} for {{co-ordinating}} search, rescue, and recovery operations. For the following six weeks, the Australian Maritime <b>Safety</b> <b>Authority</b> (AMSA) and ATSB worked {{to determine the}} search area, correlating information with the JIT and other government and academic sources, while the Joint Agency Coordination Centre (JACC) coordinated the search efforts. Following the fourth phase of the search, the ATSB took responsibility for defining the search area. In May, the search strategy working group was established by the ATSB to determine the most likely position on the aircraft at the 00:19 UTC (08:19 MYT) satellite transmission. The group included aircraft and satellite experts from: Air Accidents Investigation Branch (UK), Boeing (US), Defence Science and Technology Group (Australia), Department of Civil Aviation (Malaysia), Inmarsat (UK), National Transportation Safety Board (US), and Thales (UK).|$|E
5|$|Selling and {{purchasing}} fresh false morels {{is legal}} in Finland, {{where it is}} highly regarded. However, the mushrooms are {{required by law to}} be accompanied with a warning that they are poisonous and legally prescribed preparation instructions. False morels are also sold prepared and canned, in which case they are ready to be used. Official figures from the Finnish Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry report a total amount of false morels sold in Finland of 21.9tonnes in 2006 and 32.7tonnes, noted as being above average, in 2007. In 2002, the Finnish Food <b>Safety</b> <b>Authority</b> estimated annual consumption of false morels to be hundreds of tonnes in plentiful years. In Finnish cuisine, false morels may be cooked in an omelette, or gently sautéed in butter in a saucepan, flour and milk added to make a bechamel sauce, or pie filling. Alternatively, more fluid can be added for a false morel soup. Typical condiments added for flavour include parsley, chives, dill and black pepper.|$|E
5|$|Statistics on {{injuries}} {{related to}} commercial diving are normally collected by national regulators. In the UK the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) {{is responsible for}} the overview of about 5,000 commercial divers; in Norway the corresponding authority is the Petroleum <b>Safety</b> <b>Authority</b> Norway (PSA), which has maintained the DSYS database since 1985, gathering statistics on over 50,000 diver-hours of commercial activity per year. The risks of dying during recreational, scientific or commercial diving are small, and for scuba diving, deaths are usually associated with poor gas management, poor buoyancy control, equipment misuse, entrapment, rough water conditions and pre-existing health problems. Some fatalities are inevitable and caused by unforeseeable situations escalating out of control, but the majority of diving fatalities can be attributed to human error {{on the part of the}} victim. According to a North American 1972 analysis of calendar year 1970 data, diving was, based on man hours, 96 times more dangerous than driving a car. According to a 2000 Japanese study, every hour of recreational diving is 36 to 62 times riskier than driving.|$|E
