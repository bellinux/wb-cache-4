5|$|Siglinda Scarpa {{says she}} had issues with {{communication}} as a child, stating that “people were not <b>seeing</b> <b>me,</b> that they were talking, but never to me.” It was not until her father brought a stray kitten home and placed it under her sheets that Scarpa felt she could communicate with someone. The kitten was a year old when he became very ill and died. After his death, Scarpa decided to take in as many cats as possible, with the hopes of eventually creating {{a safe haven for}} cats. Scarpa created the Goathouse Refuge in 2007, naming it after an old goat who came with the dilapidated plantation house and the 16 acre property. Originally, the land was just intended for her pottery studio. After the house and studio burned down Scarpa rebuilt it with plans that included a sanctuary for cats, using personal resources and proceeds from her pottery sales to make it possible.|$|E

500|$|The song's lyrics {{allude to}} his {{supposed}} relationship with Mariah Carey, the music video for [...] "Obsessed", and pictures and proof {{he claims to}} have of the couple. The song begins [...] "Only reason I dissed you in the first place is because you denied <b>seeing</b> <b>me.</b> Now I'm pissed off," [...] before describing Carey's impersonation of him in her video, [...] "Oh gee, is that supposed to be me in the video with the goatee?/ Wow Mariah, didn't expect you to go balls out." [...] Eminem continues describing a near-sexual encounter with the singer, threatening to release voice-mails and pictures he still has in his possession. Additionally, the song features a females voice, unknown whether or not Carey's, where she calls herself Mary Poppins, as well as several intervals of her laughter.|$|E

500|$|He feels {{a dreamy}} {{quality in the}} best of Bates's writing, as when he meets a boa constrictor: [...] "On <b>seeing</b> <b>me</b> the reptile {{suddenly}} turned, and glided at an accelerated rate down the path. ...The rapidly moving and shining body looked like a stream of brown liquid flowing over the thick bed of fallen leaves." [...] However he is less impressed with Bates's remarks about the [...] "intellectual inferiority" [...] of the natives, and observes that Bates was wrong about the fertility of tropical soils, which are often poor: the luxuriant growth results from rapid recycling of nutrients. He celebrates the [...] "famous closing passage" [...] of the book, where Bates expresses his [...] "deep misgivings" [...] about returning to England, and writes that recent [...] "progress" [...] in the Amazon is just as shocking.|$|E
500|$|Professor Ernst Lodz is a blind mentalist. As {{revealed}} both in {{the show}} and in his original biography, he {{has a long history}} with the Carnivàle. Lodz's character arc starts with Ben joining the carnival. Lodz unsuccessfully hassles the boy to work with him and to listen to his dreams. He later initiates Ruthie's death with Management's blessing to get his sight back. Upon finding out these circumstances, Ben strangles Lodz to death, reviving Ruthie in the process. Nevertheless, Lodz repeatedly appears to Ruthie and leaves her the message [...] "Sofie is the Omega" [...] on a mirror. Using Ruthie's body, Lodz also visits his lover Lila and informs her about the events leading to his death and [...] "you'll be <b>seeing</b> <b>me</b> soon [...] in the flesh." [...] Lodz's final appearance as Ruthie was not supposed to be his last. According to Clancy Brown (Brother Justin), the writers had originally planned Lodz's return as a mummy after a man sold his desiccated body to the carnies. Lodz's demise in season 1 however was planned from the beginning. Besides serving a purpose to the story, it should indicate all bets are off for the other characters.|$|E
500|$|After Carey premiered [...] "Obsessed" [...] on June 16, 2009, {{the media}} frenzied and began speculating {{the song was}} {{targeting}} at Eminem, due to its lyrics and overall message. Following the song's accompanying music video, which featured Carey playing a role that resembled the rapper, critics considered it Carey's response to Eminem's [...] "Bagpipes from Baghdad". Soon after both the song and video's release, the rapper released another song, titled [...] "The Warning" [...] on July 30, 2009, which he {{claimed to be a}} retaliation. The song's lyrics allude to his supposed relationship with the singer, the music video for [...] "Obsessed", and pictures and proof he claims to have of the couple. The song begins [...] "Only reason I dissed you in the first place is because you denied <b>seeing</b> <b>me.</b> Now I'm pissed off", before describing Carey's impersonation of him in her video, [...] "Oh gee, is that supposed to be me in the video with the goatee?/ Wow Mariah, didn't expect ya to go balls out."

Additionally, the song features a female's voice, unknown whether or not Carey's, where she calls herself Mary Poppins, as well as several intervals of her laughter. In the aftermath of the releases, Cannon was questioned regarding the inspiration of [...] "Obsessed", and whether it was ever directed at Eminem: ...|$|E

2500|$|Within {{three years}} of being released, 67% of ex-prisoners re-offend and 52% are re-incarcerated, {{according}} to a study published in 1994. The rate of recidivism is so high in the United States that most inmates who enter the system are likely to reenter within a year of their release. Former inmate Wenona Thompson argues [...] "I realized that I became part of a cycle, a system, that looked forward to <b>seeing</b> <b>me</b> there. And I was aware that...I would be {{one of those people who}} fill up their prisons".|$|E
2500|$|In 1998, Delany {{reportedly}} {{turned down}} the role of Carrie Bradshaw in the hit TV show Sex and the City. She commented in a subsequent interview: [...] "The show’s creator Darren Star asked me to play Carrie ... Darren got the idea of televising Candace Bushnell’s Sex and the City from <b>seeing</b> <b>me</b> and Kim (Kim Cattrall) in Live Nude Girls." [...] Delany declined the role partly after remembering the negative audience reaction she received with a similar film, Exit to Eden, a few years back. Sex and the City became a successful series, {{and the role of}} Carrie made Sarah Jessica Parker world-famous.|$|E
2500|$|The third {{meeting was}} on 10 December and Law, raging because Asquith {{had not yet}} {{presented}} a concrete way to exclude Ulster, made little progress. Law brushed aside Asquith's suggestions and insisted that only the exclusion of Ulster was worth considering. He later wrote that [...] "My feeling, however, is that Asquith has no hope whatsoever of making such an arrangement and that his present idea is simply to let things drift in the meantime.. I do not understand why he took the trouble of <b>seeing</b> <b>me</b> at all. The only explanation I can give is that I think {{he is in a}} funk about the whole position and thought that meeting me might keep the thing open at least".|$|E

2500|$|On hearing {{screams in}} a room, I went up {{a sort of}} tunnel passage and saw an Arab {{in the act of}} cutting off a child's head with a sword. He had already hit him and was having another cut, but on <b>seeing</b> <b>me</b> he tried to aim the stroke at me, but missed; he was {{practically}} on the muzzle of my rifle. I shot him low in the groin. Behind him was a Jewish woman smothered in blood with a man I recognized as a police constable named Issa Sheriff from Jaffa. He was standing over the woman with a dagger in his hand. He saw me and bolted into a room close by and tried to shut me out-shouting in Arabic, [...] "Your Honor, I am a policeman." ... I got into the room and shot him.|$|E
2500|$|The {{earliest}} surviving Christian depiction is a fresco of the 4th {{century in}} the Catacomb of Via Latina, Rome. [...] Four figures are on the bank, with Moses still in the water; the largest is the princess, who stretches out her arms, which the baby also does. [...] This gesture may derive from a textual variation found in Midrashic sources and the Aramaic translation of the Bible. In these [...] "she ... sent her female slave" [...] is changed to [...] "she stretched out her arm". [...] Though the context is Christian, many of the images here are of Old Testament subjects, and very likely reflect models adopted from an initially Jewish visual tradition, perhaps painted by artisans with sets of models for all religious requirements. [...] In the play Exagōgē by Ezekiel the Tragedian (3rd century BC), Moses recounts his finding, saying of the princess [...] "And straightway <b>seeing</b> <b>me,</b> she took me up", which may be reflected both in the New Testament Acts 7:20, and in artistic depictions where the princess is apparently first to grasp the ark.|$|E
2500|$|Fitzwilliam decided upon a {{memorial}} to {{be presented to the}} King defending his Lord Lieutenancy. It was drafted by Burke and shortened by Lord Milton. Burke wrote that [...] "My Idea was to proceed not so much by way of a direct answer to a charge, though that too, obliquely, was not be neglected; as {{in the way of a}} charge on your Enemies, so as to put them upon their defence". Fitzwilliam attended a levee on 22 April and had an audience with the King in the closet, where he presented his memorial. He wrote to Grattan on 25 April that at the levee [...] "Very little was said to me; only a few questions about my son's health; however, I thought the manner gracious, as the King, upon <b>seeing</b> <b>me,</b> passed by some people to come directly to me". During the audience Fitzwilliam explained his position and the King [...] "Upon the whole his attention was gracious, but he gave no opinion whatever, only as to my intentions". The King wrote to Pitt on 29 April that the memorial was [...] "rather a panegyric on himself than any pointed attack on Ministry...I cannot say much information is to be obtained from it".|$|E

2500|$|In 2000, Santos had {{the lead}} role in Kahit Isang Saglit. She portrayed Annie, a budding {{architect}} romantically torn between two best friends (played by Piolo Pascual and Leandro Munoz). The film received reasonable reviews but was generally lauded for the chemistry between Santos and Pascual. Santos next appearance with Pascual was in the 2001 television series Sa Puso Ko Iingatan Ka as Patricia Montecillo, an illegitimate daughter in a constant struggle for acceptance and independence, dealing with an alcoholic abusive stepfather. Dez Lucero from Chic commended Santos' breakthrough and innovative portrayal, [...] "Patricia [...] here is a fighter who stands up to anyone bent on demolishing her [...] she is a survivor, she is sarcastic, she is street smart, she is strong." [...] Asked what she hoped to accomplish in the drama series, Santos stated, [...] "After <b>seeing</b> <b>me</b> cry for years, I think the public now wants me to make them laugh." [...] In the same year, Santos released her second album Bida Ng Buhay Ko. Singles from the album included [...] "Hello Goodbye", [...] "This Song's Dedicated To You", and [...] "Stop! Before You Break My Heart". The album was met with negative reviews. David Gonzales of AllMusic.com gave the album {{one out of five}} stars, stating, [...] "Santos is a popular young film actress, and this must be the reason why she has a recording contract. It isn't because of her singing, which ranges from bad to terrible. She sings in a low, whispery voice and hits many off-key notes throughout the album, which makes a listener cringe. Her voice is often difficult to hear above the backing instrumentation, but at least this spares a listener from more misery." [...] The album achieved moderate success, eventually certified platinum.|$|E
