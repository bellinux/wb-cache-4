25|$|Napster {{music store}} offers a subscription-based {{approach}} to DRM alongside permanent purchases. Users of the subscription service can download and stream an unlimited amount of music transcoded to Windows Media Audio (WMA) while subscribed to the service. But when the <b>subscription</b> <b>period</b> lapses, all the downloaded music is unplayable until the user renews {{his or her}} subscription. Napster also charges users who wish to use the music on their portable device an additional $5 per month. In addition, Napster gives users the option of paying an additional $0.99 per track to burn it to CD or for the song to never expire. Music bought through Napster can be played on players carrying the Microsoft PlaysForSure logo (which, notably, do not include iPods or even Microsoft's own Zune). As of June 2009, Napster is offering DRM free MP3 music, which can be played on iPhones and iPods.|$|E
25|$|Many of the membership-based {{systems are}} {{operated}} through public-private partnerships. Several European cities, including the French cities of Lyon and Paris {{as well as}} London, Barcelona, Stockholm and Oslo, have signed contracts with private advertising agencies (JCDecaux in Brussels, Lyon, Paris, Seville and Dublin; Clear Channel in Stockholm, Oslo, Barcelona, Antwerp, Perpignan and Zaragoza) which supply the city with thousands of bicycles free of charge (or for a minor fee). In return, the agencies are allowed to advertise both on the bikes themselves and in other select locations in the city. Some other programmes are not linked to an advertising deal (for example Smoove) and are financed {{as a part of}} public transportation scheme. These programmes attempt to reduce losses from theft by requiring users to purchase subscriptions with a credit card or debit card (this option requiring a large, temporary deposit) and by equipping the bike with complex anti-theft and bike maintenance sensors. If the bike is not returned within the <b>subscription</b> <b>period,</b> or returned with significant damage, the bike sharing operator withdraws money from the user's credit card account.|$|E

40|$|Price {{discounts}} or unit premiums? Two {{alternative approaches}} to offer and design subscription tarifs. A firm can offer subscriptions of different durations with specific price discounts, the longer a customer subscribes, {{the lower the}} price per time unit. Alternatively, a firm can design and differentiate <b>subscriptions</b> of different <b>periods</b> applying the same price per time unit and offering customers of longer <b>subscription</b> <b>periods</b> a time period of free usage (premium). In this paper, we analyze, whether these two presentations are equivalent in terms of consumers’ evaluation, or, {{if there are any}} differences that have major managerial implications for firms offering subscription plans. Our results show that consumers have different expectations when talking about price discounts or unit premiums. Further, we derive implications for firms’ optimal pricing policy of subscriptions...|$|R

50|$|Though {{the company}} {{organized}} several events, and published some books, {{through the end}} of the 1990s LatinFinance's business was predominantly magazine publishing with both revenues and profits derived primarily from advertising sales and magazine <b>subscriptions.</b> The <b>period</b> following the Argentine economic crisis and default in early 2002 proved especially challenging for Latin American financial markets and those active in them. LatinFinance's performance in its 2002 financial year slumped to the worst in its then 15-year history though it remained profitable and was even able to consider, though ultimately to reject, suggestions that it absorb the two other pan-regional business-to-business titles.|$|R

40|$|Systematic {{monitoring}} of performance characteristics of mo-bile broadband networks can help users, operators, and reg-ulators understand this increasingly critical infrastructure. We report {{the results of}} a measurement study of round trip delays in two mobile networks in Norway using over 200 geographically distributed <b>subscriptions</b> for a <b>period</b> of one month. In general, we find high variation in delay within the same radio access type and RRC state. Across both networks we study, we observe connections with round trip delays of several seconds, often multiple times per hour, that are more frequent when nodes are moving. Correlating these extreme delay events with available metadata, we find they are related to handovers, radio state transitions, and retransmissions at the link and physical layers. 1...|$|R
30|$|Our data {{consist of}} the anonymized mobile {{telephone}} call {{records of the}} customers of a Belgian mobile operator from October 1, 2006 to March 31, 2007. Each customer is uniquely identified, and each call {{is associated with a}} time stamp and a duration. This data set has already been studied from a static perspective in several papers [10, 15, 16]. As our focus is on link dynamics, we filter out all customers who have modified their subscription plan during the data collection period. This removes new customers, and customers who have cancelled their <b>subscription</b> during the <b>period.</b> We also only concentrate on the customers of this specific operator (market share in Belgium ∼ 30 %), and discard all calls to/from customers of outside operators. The above filtering yields a network that has 2.1 million customers, making over 170 million calls during the collection period.|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} report presents the recent research {{work that has}} been done on the WSOL (Web Service Offerings Language) grammar and the "Premier" WSOL parser. The WSOL grammar has been extended in several ways. First, specification of periodic QoS constraints was introduced and the specification of QoS constraints was improved by adding evaluation period for occasional QoS constraint evaluation. Next, dynamic relationships between service offerings can now include complex expressions. Further, naming of all kinds of WSOL expressions and referencing all kinds of WSOL expressions from other WSOL constraints was added. The specification of <b>subscription</b> information, validity <b>period</b> information, and auto manipulation information for WSOL service offerings were added. The WSOL grammar has also been improved in order to enable specification of existing types of WSOL statements and additional penalty statements using the general construct and specification of CGs and CGTs in which only some constraints have to be satisfied. We use the version number 1. 1 to denote this new version of WSOL. The existing WSOL example has been improved and some new WSOL examples have been developed in this research work using the improved and extended WSOL grammar. A WSOL example for the specification of future-conditions (the XML grammar for which was developed prior to this research work) has also been created. The "Premier" WSOL parser has been extended and improved to validate specifications of future-conditions and service offerings dynamic relationships. Further, it was improved to validate some of the new WSOL specifications developed using the improved WSOL grammar and to detect and report syntax and semantic errors in these specifications. For example, the "Premier" WSOL parser [...] ...|$|R

50|$|The {{concept of}} the 10-36 Plan was to create two {{separate}} legal entities. For the first 16 months of the <b>subscription</b> <b>period,</b> investors would contribute to the Zion Non-Profit Charitable Trust (ZNPCT), a Community Development Corporation (CDC) that would support education, scholarships for youth, health services and other programs aimed at social uplift. For the remaining 20 months of the <b>subscription</b> <b>period,</b> investors would make payments to a for-profit corporation, Progress Investment Associates (PIA), which would undertake income-generating projects. At the end of 36 months, subscribers would receive one share of common voting stock and would be entitled to participate in yearly shareholders meetings. As William Downes, the treasurer of the 10-36 Plan and {{the executive director of}} ZNPCT explains, the idea of the voting system was to encourage community involvement in the plan.|$|E

50|$|To {{cope with}} this {{cashflow}} problem, Object Desktop users who had switched from OS/2 to Windows were asked to purchase Windows subscriptions {{in advance of the}} actual software, on the understanding that their <b>subscription</b> <b>period</b> would only begin when the software was reasonably complete (which ended up as December 1999).

5000|$|The {{issue which}} makes one {{subscription}} system a hijacking {{of the credit}} card is not the mode of entry into the subscription nor the billing interval, but the marketing organization creating barriers for the user to easily cancel the subscription. Organizations which use credit card hijacking {{as part of their}} marketing strategy make online registration for the subscription easy, enforce default automatic renewal policies, and create barriers to halting the subscription. (This is in contrast to traditional subscription based system such as paper magazines where the subscriber has to periodically proactively reauthorize the subscription, hence the default is to not renew.) The most common subscription exit barrier is to not provide any online subscription cancellation mechanism at all, but to instead require the user to cancel by telephone or by [...] "on-line chats". Such organizations often add the additional barrier of making any subscription cancellation information difficult for the user to even find, thus creating an additional delay in the subscription cancellation. This is very common amongst ISP’s, who know the psychological barrier to making the call, which the subscriber anticipates will be unpleasant, is very high. It also allows the marketing organization to talk the subscriber into changing their minds and not cancelling the subscription. Another common subscription cancellation barrier is to have a relatively long <b>subscription</b> <b>period,</b> a no refund policy, and to require the user upon cancellation to forfeit all money covering the present <b>subscription</b> <b>period.</b> This is very common amongst online dating services.|$|E
50|$|A {{rights issue}} is a {{dividend}} of subscription rights to buy additional securities in a company made to the company's existing security holders. When the rights are for equity securities, such as shares, in a public company, it is a non-dilutive pro rata way to raise capital. Rights issues are typically sold via a prospectus or prospectus supplement. With the issued rights, existing security-holders have the privilege to buy a specified number of new securities from the issuer at a specified price within a <b>subscription</b> <b>period.</b> In a public company, a rights {{issue is a}} form of public offering (different from most other types of public offering, where shares are issued to the general public).|$|E
