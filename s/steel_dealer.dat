5000|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century {{differences}} in standards between companies was making trade increasingly difficult and strained. For instance, an iron and <b>steel</b> <b>dealer</b> recorded his displeasure in The Times: [...] "Architects and engineers generally specify such unnecessarily diverse types of sectional material or given work that anything like economical and continuous manufacture becomes impossible. In this country no two professional men are agreed upon the size and weight of a girder to employ for given work".|$|E
50|$|Gallagher {{resigned}} in late 1952 and {{was expected to}} rejoin the Browns to do scouting and personnel work. He was hired on a temporary basis to help Cleveland assistant Weeb Ewbank prepare for the NFL Draft. In February 1953, however, he signed as an end coach for the NFL's Chicago Cardinals after considering a competing offer to assist Pappy Waldorf at the University of California. Gallagher spent just one season in Chicago, returning to the Browns in 1954 as a part-time scout and personnel expert. He {{spent the rest of}} his time working in the sales department of Luria Brothers, a <b>steel</b> <b>dealer.</b> The Browns hired him full-time the following season, promoting him to head the team's scouting department. The Cleveland won the NFL championship in 1954 and 1955.|$|E
5000|$|The {{plan for}} the Buttonwoods site now located at the Rhode Island Historical Society in Providence called for 1,000 or so land parcels {{to be sold to}} Baptists from around the region. Lodowick joined with his brother Jonathan and with Andrew Comstock to secure the $10,000 in {{financing}} for this enterprise. This would be the equivalent of hundreds of millions in today's dollars, a large real estate development. Much of the cash investment came from the Brayton family (railroaders and <b>steel</b> <b>dealers</b> and investor in the Colvin loom. [...] The Panic of 1873 set in shortly after this investment was made and few lots were actually sold for many years. The campgrounds were resurveyed in 1882 into much larger lots, many of remained unsold and were combined into a large tract of open space in recent years. Brayton died a rich man but his fortunes were much diminished in the real estate deflation that followed the panic. History of Rhode Island Manufacturers ...|$|R
5000|$|A {{standard}} E9 single-neck pedal steel guitar's copedent is charted below. Pedal steel {{players who}} play country music most often use an E9th tuning. The particular copedent first listed below is {{commonly referred to}} as an [...] "Emmons set-up." [...] Another common copedent, the [...] "Day set-up," [...] is almost identical, except that the functions of Pedal 1 and Pedal 3 are reversed. These two copedents are named for Pedal steel pioneers [...] "Buddy Emmons" [...] and [...] "Jimmy Day" [...] respectively. The [...] "Emmons" [...] set-up {{is by far the most}} popular being found on 9 out of 10 steel guitars, and most manufacturers ship their new pedal <b>steels</b> to <b>dealers</b> with the [...] "Emmons" [...] copedent. Another common copedent utilizes the C6th tuning. Most steelers use one or both of these two copedents. However, many steelers create their own unique copedents.|$|R
50|$|Brothers Pete and Ernie Harris {{established}} their manufacturing business, Harris Manufacturing, in the 1940s and 50's. While {{looking for a}} way to expand their business, inspired by an increasing number of individuals building early pontoon boats on 55-gallon barrels and drop tanks from airplanes, the brothers founded Harris FloteBote Marine in 1957.The original Harris FloteBote pontoons were 20-feet in length with <b>steel</b> tubes. <b>Dealers</b> were not receptive to the large boats occupying the extra showroom space, as they were accustomed to typical 16-foot runabouts. In order to gain visibility in the marine industry the Harris brothers would showcase their boats first hand to people around Eastern Indiana and South-eastern Michigan lakes. This tactic successfully built a positive reputation through word-of-mouth. Harris FloteBote revamped the early pontoon boat industry in the 1960s by installing upholstered pontoon seats and furniture on their pontoon boats.Harris Flotebote adopted aluminum tubes around 1968, when welding equipment big enough to accommodate the material became available. In the 1970s Harris Flotebote pontoons were early adopters of sterndrives, and had motor-pods capable of holding engines as powerful as 140 horsepower—which enabled Harris Pontoons to pull water-skiers, an early innovation for pontoon boats. The splash guard added to the front of the pontoons, referred to as a “dolphin-nose cone” were implemented in 1959, this design feature has become standard within the industry.In 2005 Harris-Kayot was purchased by Brunswick Corporation.To meet market demand, Brunswick Fort Wayne Operations, the producer of Harris FloteBote expanded their production facility in June 2013 to a 360,000-square foot manufacturing campus in Fort Wayne, Indiana. Harris FloteBote pontoons will have been produced in the region for over 50 years.|$|R
40|$|Maize dried {{distillers}} grains with solubles (DDGS) is {{a valuable}} ingredient in the swine industry but when incorporated into diets at high levels (40 %) poor flowability of the feed often results. Researchers have investigated the physical properties of DDGS and use of anti-caking agents to determine their influence on flowability but few studies have evaluated effects of feed storage structures on flowability. Thus, two experiments were designed to evaluate the effects of feed bin design and passive agitator use on flowability of a commercial swine finishing diet containing 40 % DDGS. Six bins of three different designs were used, which included: a galvanized steel, seamless bin with a 60 ° cone (<b>Steel</b> 60; <b>Dealers</b> Livestock, Glenwood, Minn.); a galvanized, corrugated steel bin with a 67 ° cone (Steel 67; PigTek, Milford, Ind.); and a white, polyethylene bin with a 60 ° cone (Poly 60; Prairie Pride, Winnipeg, MB). In Experiment 1, rate of feed flow from each bin was assessed on days 3, 7, and 21 post-feed delivery. Feed flow from Poly 60 (736. 8 kg/min) was faster than Steel 60 (602. 9 kg/min), with Steel 67 having intermediate flow (663. 3 kg/min). In Experiment 2, passive feed flow agitators (Sure Flo Agitator, Farmer Boy Ag Supply, Myerstown, Pa.) were installed in one bin of each design. Feed flow was evaluated on days 2, 3, 6, 7, 20, and 21 post-feed delivery. Feed flow from Poly 60 (900. 7 kg/min) was greater than flow from either Steel 60 (826. 7 kg/min) or Steel 67 (843. 8 kg/min). The passive agitator increased flow in Poly 60 (970. 0 vs. 831. 4 kg/min), tended to improve feed flow in Steel 67 (880. 2 vs. 807. 4 kg/min), but had no effect in Steel 60 (826. 8 vs. 826. 7 kg/min). Results indicate feed bin design can influence flowability of feed containing 40 % DDGS. Of the bins tested, the passive agitator appeared to improve feed flow in some, but not all bin designs...|$|R
