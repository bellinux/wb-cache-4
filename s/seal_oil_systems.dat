Future plant capacity requirements of the hydrocracker unit at a United Kingdom site required a 25 percent increase in capacity and a three to 10 percent increase in differential pressure of the charge pump duty. After preliminary investigations, the decision was made to rerate and upgrade the existing pumps, as opposed to purchasing new equipment. In addition to the performance rerate, there was a requirement to resolve a long term vibration problem and to improve the performance of the mechanical seals. The final scope of work included major modifications to the pumps including one new barrel casing, cartridge-type double mechanical seals, new gearboxes, and new motors. In addition, extensive modifications of the baseplates were required, which included new support pedestals for both pumps and motors. Refurbishment of the lube oil systems and modification to the <b>seal</b> <b>oil</b> <b>systems</b> were also carried out.

40|$|LecturePg. 75 - 84 There are {{significant}} advantages in using gas lubricated face seals (dry gas seals) in centrifugal compressor service. Foremost {{among these are}} {{the elimination of the}} <b>seal</b> <b>oil</b> <b>system</b> resulting in lower maintenance, increased safety, and higher operating availability. For these reasons, one of four identical compressors at an installation having severe problems with <b>seal</b> <b>oil</b> contamination was selected for trial conversion to dry gas seals. The rotordynamic engineering portion of this job was done by the compressor manufacturer in conjunction with the gas seal supplier. The seal assembly was designed so that it would be essentially a drop-in conversion from a mechanical standpoint. Rotordynamic studies indicated that the conversion would result in a "better" machine. Unfortunately, sustained operations were not possible, due to excessive vibration levels at startup with the new seals. The shaft vibration exceeded 0. 007 in, peak-to-peak, at a subsynchronous frequency of 4900 rpm (the machine rated speed is in excess of 10, 000 rpm). These levels were sufficiently high to cause extensive damage to all internal labyrinths. The midspan labyrinths were wiped open in excess of 0. 060 in, radial. Analysis of tape recorded data indicated that the vibration was due to a rotor/bearing system dynamic instability. Additional computer simulations of the compressor rotordynamics revealed that the <b>oil</b> <b>seals</b> had provided sufficient damping to the system to bound the instability. This extra damping was not being provided by the gas seals. Bearing redesign to increase stability and realignment of the rotor within the bundle to remove suspected excitation appear to have eliminated the problem...|$|R
5000|$|Compressed air is {{the most}} common power source for impact wrenches, {{providing}} a low-cost design with the best power-to-weight ratio. A simple vane motor is almost always used, usually with four to seven vanes, and various lubrication systems, the most common of which uses oiled air, while others may include special oil passages routed to the parts that need it and a separate, <b>sealed</b> <b>oil</b> <b>system</b> for the hammer assembly. Most impact wrenches drive the hammer directly from the motor, giving it fast action when the fastener requires only low torque. Other designs use a gear reduction system before the hammer mechanism, most often a single-stage planetary gearset usually with a heavier hammer, delivering a more constant speed and higher [...] "spin" [...] torque. Electric impact wrenches are available, either mains powered, or for automotive use, 12-volt, 18-volt or 24-volt DC-powered. Recently, cordless electric impact wrenches have become common, although typically their power outputs are significantly lower than corded electric or air-powered equivalents. Some industrial tools are hydraulically powered, using high-speed hydraulic motors, and are used in some heavy equipment repair shops, large construction sites, and other areas where a suitable hydraulic supply is available. Hydraulic impact wrenches have the advantage of high power-to-weight ratio.|$|R

40|$|LecturePg. 51 - 64 Current {{technologies}} {{now make}} it possible to build turbomachinery without the need for a lubrication and seal oil system. However, there is an established machinery population that still requires support systems for oil wetted bearings and seals. For most companies, it is not economically practical to convert to new bearings and seals to eliminate the oil support system. Indeed, {{this may not be the}} best solution in many cases. Lubrication and <b>seal</b> <b>oil</b> <b>systems</b> can be the single largest cause of spurious and nuisance trips. In most cases, such trips are due to controller degradation, improper operation, or simple neglect. The most common causes of oil system problems, and practical solutions aimed at long term operating reliability are addressed. A chronic cause of spurious trips is oil pump switchover. Usually, such problems can be eliminated by upgrading controllers and/or control valve selection philosophy, installation of hydraulic pulsation dampeners, a design audit of the piping configuration, and, very often, operating procedures. Oil system instability contributes significantly to nuisance trips. Again, a review of system control components and associated hardware can usually minimize this phenomenon. Additionally, improper purging of air has been known to cause similar problems, and frustrate the most experienced operator. There are other problems which can also result in unscheduled downtime of critical rotating machinery. These include collapsing oil filter elements, improper sour seal oil drainer sizing, improper control valve sizing, lack of attention to transient conditions, controller and pressure switch physical location, and oil cooler integrity, to name a few. There is a large installed machinery population that has been in operation for many years, but has never been upgraded to present standards. New developments in control technology lend themselves to increasing oil system reliability, in addition to other component upgrades. Refineries and chemical plants now commonly utilize comprehensive preventive maintenance (PM) programs; however, oil systems do not seem to be included in such programs to the same level as that of their supported machinery. Oil system reliability can be increased, and nuisance trips minimized, by monitoring several key operating points which include valve position, oil temperature and chemical analysis, and filter differential pressure (to name a few) on a scheduled basis. Such data can also be useful in determining or predicting problems with the rotating equipment. It has also become obvious in recent years that process demands, in addition to efforts to improve oil system reliability, have resulted in systems that are more complex. Such complexity has, in some cases, ironically decreased operational reliability due to the introduction of unnecessary hardware. Practical and realistic basic design guidelines will be presented, along with a comparison of the various design philosophies currently being utilized in the industry...|$|E

Consistently, the serum ratios of n- 6 to n- 3 FAs (P << 0. 01) and arachidonic acid to eicosapentaenoic acid (P << 0. 01) were reduced after treatment with <b>seal</b> <b>oil.</b> Conclusion: The results suggest distinctive differential prolonged effects on IBD-related joint pain of short-term duodenal administration of n- 3 rich <b>seal</b> <b>oil</b> (significant improvement) and n- 6 rich soy oil (tendency to exacerbation) ...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Objective. To {{investigate}} {{effects of}} short-term oral treatment with <b>seal</b> <b>oil</b> {{in patients with}} psoriatic arthritis (PsA). Methods. Forty-three patients with polyarticular PsA were randomized to receive oral treatment for 2 weeks with either <b>seal</b> <b>oil</b> or soy oil in a double blind controlled trial. Clinical and biochemical variables were assessed at baseline, after treatment, and 4 weeks post-treatment. Patients were allowed to continue nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAID) and disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARD) during the study. Results. Forty patients completed the study, 20 in each treatment group. Patients in the <b>seal</b> <b>oil</b> group reported a significant improvement in global assessment of the disease 4 weeks post- treatment (p < 0. 01), and both groups showed a trend toward improvement in tender joint count, but {{the differences between the}} groups were not significant. There was a fall in the ratio of n- 6 to n- 3 fatty acids and in arachidonic acid (AA) to eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) in serum after treatment with <b>seal</b> <b>oil</b> (p < 0. 01). Twenty-one percent of all patients had elevated values of calprotectin in feces suggestive of asymptomatic colitis. Conclusion. Treatment with <b>seal</b> <b>oil</b> was followed by a modest improvement in patient’s global assessment of the disease and a trend towards a decrease in number of tender joints. There was a shif...|$|R

If the <b>oil</b> <b>seal</b> ring becomes locked up against the fixed portion of the <b>seal,</b> high <b>oil</b> film crosscoupled stiffnesses can result. A method of analysis for determining if the <b>oil</b> <b>seals</b> are locked up or not is discussed.

50|$|Many {{gas turbine}} engines, having high {{rotational}} speeds, use labyrinth seals {{due to their}} lack of friction and long life. Because liquid-filled labyrinth seals still generate heat due to the viscosity of the <b>seal</b> <b>oil,</b> and because <b>seal</b> <b>oil</b> can contaminate the process fluids, modern high-performance gas turbines use dry gas seals which use spring-loaded rings with an inert gas in between {{the faces of the}} rings to provide the seal. This creates even lower friction and provides a fluid-free seal.|$|R
