40|$|The use {{of light}} steel frames in rapid {{construction}} has grown significantly, especially concerning low and medium-rise buildings. However, there {{are limited resources}} available regarding the <b>sway</b> <b>stiffness</b> of light steel frames with flexible bolted joints. This paper presents {{a study on the}} lateral sway behaviour for light steel frames with bolted top-seat flange cleat connections comprising slender cold-formed steel sections. Two different sections, flexibility of beam-to-column joint and base conditions are the investigated variables. The result recorded showed that geometrics, joint flexibility and base conditions affect the <b>sway</b> <b>stiffness</b> of light steel frame. The increase rate is ranged from 29. 2 % to 47. 5 % for the identical tests for the effect of section depth. The ratio lies between 1. 10 and 3. 04 for the effect of connector thickness. In addition, beam-to-column bolted connections can contribute 34 – 88 % of the overall frame elastic lateral stiffness for pinned bases and 17 – 33 % for rigid base connections. Frame stability analysis with respect to global frame and column design were performed for the test specimens. Appropriate frame design analysis should be determined to provide a safe and reliable design for light steel frame considering bolted flexible joints and slender cold-formed steel sections...|$|E
