5|$|The finest {{rooms were}} {{decorated}} by Pietro da Cortona {{in the high}} baroque style. Initially Cortona frescoed a small room on the piano nobile called the Sala della Stufa with a series depicting the Four Ages of Man which were very well received; the Age of Gold and Age of Silver were painted in 1637, followed in 1641 by the Age of Bronze and Age of Iron. They are regarded among his masterpieces. The artist was subsequently asked to fresco the grand ducal reception rooms; a suite of five rooms {{at the front of}} the palazzo. In these five Planetary Rooms, the hierarchical sequence of the deities is based on Ptolomeic cosmology; Venus, Apollo, Mars, Jupiter (the Medici Throne room) and Saturn, but minus Mercury and the Moon which <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> before Venus. These highly ornate ceilings with frescoes and elaborate stucco work essentially celebrate the Medici lineage and the bestowal of virtuous leadership. Cortona left Florence in 1647, and his pupil and collaborator, Ciro Ferri, completed the cycle by the 1660s. They were to inspire the later Planet Rooms at Louis XIV's Versailles, designed by Le Brun.|$|E
5|$|In the 1340s Ivan Sratsimir rose in {{prominence}} {{because he}} was married and already had children, while his eldest brother Michael Asen and his wife did not produce children for ten years. In 1352 Ivan Alexander introduced the title junior emperor {{in order to secure}} the smooth and secure transition of the throne and Ivan Sratsimir became known by that title. In the end of 1347 or in the beginning of 1348, however, Ivan Alexander divorced with his first wife and sent her to a monastery so he could marry the Jew Sarah-Theodora. That event spoiled the relations between Ivan Sratsimir and his father and the conflict deepened after the birth of Ivan Shishman to Ivan Alexander and Sarah-Theodora in 1350/1351. The conflict climaxed in 1355–1356 when the undisputed heir to the throne, Michael Asen IV, perished in battle against the Ottomans. According to the Majorat system, Ivan Sratsimir <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> next in the succession line but since Ivan Shishman was born in the purple, i.e. after his father was crowned, Ivan Alexander and Sarah-Theodora declared Ivan Shishman successor to the throne. A hint of the feud between father and son {{is the fact that the}} image of Ivan Sratsimir was not included in the Tetraevangelia of Ivan Alexander where the whole imperial family was pictured, including Ivan Alexander's son-in-law. That could mean either that Ivan Sratsimir was disinherited and proclaimed himself emperor in Vidin or that he was denied the title junior emperor and given the rule of Vidin as a compensation.|$|E

She directly ties the colonizers to today’s white America by calling them the skullmongers who are excavating the skulls of the dead Indians. Her poetry sarcastically talks about how the colonials thought they had {{earned the right to}} the land because they traveled over the sea. The Indians believed that the Americans <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> over bearing gifts, but instead came only talking of land and money.|$|E
25|$|Gorghiu, {{who joined}} the PNL in 2002, has held two elected offices. From 2004 to 2008, she was a local {{councillor}} on the Sector 5 council in Bucharest. Then in 2008, she {{was elected to the}} Chamber of Deputies. There, she served as vice president of the committee for investigating abuses and corruption and for petitions. She was also president of the committee of enquiry for verifying the amounts of money paid by the Youth and Sport Ministry through documents signed by minister Monica Iacob-Ridzi for organising the 2009 Youth Day festival. The committee's report, the findings of which were announced by Gorghiu in July 2009, declared that Ridzi had committed embezzlement and abused public office, and sought her indictment by prosecutors. When the minister resigned several days later, Gorghiu stated she was pleased but that the action <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> some time earlier. She was one of the Chamber's vice presidents from September to December 2012.|$|E

It achieved a 3.6/10 rating/share in the 18-49 demographic, again the show's season high at the time, and a 4.3/12 rating/share with adults 18-34, both its series high and the highest rating in the demographic for the night of broadcast. In Canada, it was the ninth most watched show for the week of broadcast, attaining 1.8 million viewers. The episode received mixed reviews from critics. Entertainment Weekly Dan Snierson wrote that [...] "Mattress" [...] "felt like a step forward after last week's all-over-the-place hair toss", and called the [...] "poignant" [...] ending [...] "one of Glee best". In contrast, Mike Hale of the New York Times wrote that with [...] "Mattress", Glee appeared to be [...] "taking a break" [...] ahead of the midseason finale episode [...] "Sectionals". Liz Pardue of Zap2it was relieved that [...] "Mattress" [...] brought the fake pregnancy storyline to an end. She noted, however, that she was still unsatisfied with the episode, as the conclusion to the storyline <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> sooner, and there were too few songs featured.|$|E
500|$|Amos Barshad from New York {{declared}} that the song reminded him of being drunk and dancing in a remote discothèque in Berlin. NMEs Dan Martin was {{of the opinion that}} [...] "Judas" [...] was the song that Gaga <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> back with. But he understood why she did not choose it as the lead single from Born This Way, {{given the fact that the}} song was characteristic of Gaga's music. Pointing the same thing, Matthew Perpetua from Rolling Stone wrote that the song played to Gaga's established musical sensibilities. He added that although [...] "Judas" [...] certainly had its own charms and [...] "at least three insanely catchy hooks it leans hard on Gaga's signature moves." [...] Maura Johnston of The Village Voice summarized the song as a twin of [...] "Bad Romance" [...] describing its [...] "instantly memorable wordless vocalizing, a pummeling beat, lyrics about a romance that is, well, bad." [...] Digital Spy's Robert Copsey gave the song five out of five stars, commending the [...] "blasphemously camp" [...] chorus and comparing it to be worthy of Eurovision – [...] "a Scooch-meets-Lordi affair that, unsurprisingly, takes a few listens to get your head around." [...] Mark Lepage from The Gazette praised the song and understood that as Gaga's music has progressed, so has her themes and inspirations, indicated by the conflicted relationship she has with the character Judas in the song. Rick Fulton, while writing in the Daily Record, compared it to [...] "'Like a Prayer' on steroids" [...] and gave it three out of five points. NME called the song [...] "Gaga's worst single so far".|$|E

2500|$|Powell's {{position}} on the Iraq War troop surge of 2007 has been less consistent.

He stated: [...] "I am not persuaded that another surge of troops into Baghdad for the purposes of suppressing this communitarian violence, this civil war, will work." [...] Following his endorsement of Barack Obama in October 2008, however, Powell praised General David Petraeus and U.S. troops, as well as the Iraqi government, concluding that [...] "it's starting to turn around." [...] By mid-2009, he had concluded a surge of U.S. forces in Iraq <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> sooner, perhaps in late 2003.
