50|$|The chameleon, a camouflaged, slow-moving lizard, is an {{arboreal}} hunter that hides and ambushes prey. Prey and predators alike can be <b>sighted</b> and <b>monitored</b> using monocular depth perception. Also, {{nodal point}} separation allows distance {{to be judged}} with one eye, so minimal head movement is needed by the chameleon in watching its surroundings, reinforcing the chameleon strategy of inconspicuousness.|$|R
50|$|For safety reasons, {{nearly all}} steam engines are {{equipped}} with mechanisms to monitor the boiler, such as a pressure gauge and a <b>sight</b> glass to <b>monitor</b> the water level.|$|R
50|$|The Thermal Observation and Gunnery Sight II (TOGS II), from Thales, {{provides}} night vision. The {{thermal image}} is displayed {{on both the}} gunner's and commander's <b>sights</b> and <b>monitors.</b> The gunner has a stabilised primary sight using a laser rangefinder {{with a range of}} 200 m to 10 km. The driver's position is equipped with a Thales Optronics image-intensifying Passive Driving Periscope (PDP) for night driving and a rear view thermal camera.|$|R
50|$|Though the G-28 {{had some}} of the {{characteristics}} of contemporary fighters, it differed in having a fixed tailwheel undercarriage. Each unfaired main wheel was on a cantilever oleo leg from the forward spar; the tailwheel castored. Its armament was simple, with a single machine gun aimed with a reflector <b>sight</b> and <b>monitored</b> with a wing root camera. A pair of underwing racks could each carry two bombs with weights up to 40 kg.|$|R

50|$|Aiming is {{provided}} by a Galileo Avionica TURMS fire control system (the same as fitted to the Italian Ariete tank) and {{is equipped with a}} muzzle referencing system and a fully digital ballistic computer. The gunner's sight is fully stabilized and comes equipped with a thermal imager and laser rangefinder. The commander's station is equipped with a panoramic stabilized sight, an image intensifying night <b>sight</b> and a <b>monitor</b> displaying the image from the gunner's thermal sight. This allows Centauro to engage stationary or moving targets while stationary or on the move, in day or night.|$|R
50|$|In {{its basic}} {{infantry}} form, the system comprises a missile {{in a sealed}} tube which is inserted into a launch tube prior to use. When the target is sighted and the missile is fired, the launch motor fires through the rear nozzle propelling the missile from the tube. As the missile exits the launch tube first four wings just forward of the flight motor spring open forwards followed by four tail control surfaces which flip open rearwards as the missile completely exits the launch tube. At approximately 50-65 meters downrange the flight motor ignites and boosts the missile's speed to approximately 600 miles per hour (or 1000 kilometers per hour). IR sensors bore-sighted to the optical <b>sight</b> continuously <b>monitor</b> {{the position of a}} IR source on the missile relative to the line-of-sight, and generates error signals which are sent via the command link to the missile's integral guidance unit. The missile's guidance unit then corrects the trajectory of the missile via the control surface actuators.|$|R

40|$|Optical {{communications}} is a {{key technology}} to meet the bandwidth expansion required in the global information grid. High bandwidth bi-directional links between sub-orbital platforms and ground and space terminals can provide a seamless interconnectivity for rapid return of critical data to analysts. The JPL Optical Communications Telescope Laboratory (OCTL) is located in Wrightwood California {{at an altitude of}} 2. 2. km. This 200 sq-m facility houses a state-of- the-art 1 -m telescope and is used to develop operational strategies for ground-to-space laser beam propagation that include safe beam transmission through navigable air space, adaptive optics correction and multi-beam scintillation mitigation, and line of <b>sight</b> optical attenuation <b>monitoring.</b> JPL has received authorization from international satellite owners to transmit laser beams to more than twenty retro-reflecting satellites.

40|$|Blazars are {{the most}} {{luminous}} persistent and enigmatic objects in the sky. They constitute a sub-class of active galactic nuclei (AGN) whose relativistic plasma jets are closely aligned to our line of <b>sight.</b> By <b>monitoring</b> the polarized emission of these jets and subsequently modeling flares in the high-energy emission, {{we are able to}} gain insight into the parsec-scale physics of the jets close to the central engines. My dissertation develops and augments several theoretical models of high-energy blazar emission. The vast majority of gamma-ray flares detected in blazars are highly correlated with flares detected at longer wavelengths; however, a small subset of these gamma-ray flares appear to occur in isolation. These "orphan" gamma-ray flares challenge current models of blazar variability. I have developed a theoretical model of blazar emission to explain the origin of these orphan flares. This model invokes the presence of a sheath of plasma enshrouding the relativistic spine of the jet. The sheath supplies photons that are inverse-Compton scattered up to high energies by relativistic electrons contained within the jet, producing an orphan flare. This model is successfully applied to a number of such gamma-ray flares. In addition, I present stacked radio images that highlight the presence of jet sheaths in my sample of blazars. Circular polarization (CP) has been detected in a number of blazar jets. CP is very sensitive to the underlying plasma content of the jet. A. Marscher has developed the Turbulent Extreme Multi-Zone (TEMZ) model for blazar emission consisting of thousands of individual cells of plasma that propagate relativistically across a standing shock in the jet. The turbulent nature of the magnetic field within the TEMZ grid naturally creates a birefringent environment in which CP emission can be produced. In order to investigate whether the TEMZ model can indeed produce CP, I have developed a numerical algorithm to solve the full Stokes equations of polarized radiative transfer. I apply this algorithm to ray tracing through the TEMZ model. I am able to demonstrate that TEMZ can reproduce CP at the levels present in blazars...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationships}} between the distribution of visuomanual signals in parietal cortex and that of parieto-frontal projections {{are the subject of}} the present study. Single cell recording was performed in areas PEc and V 6 A, where different anatomical tracers were also injected. The monkeys performed a variety of behavioral tasks, aimed at studying the visual and motor properties of parietal cells, as well as the potential combination of retinal-, eye- and hand-related signals on cell activity. The activity of most cells was related to the direction of movement and the active position of the hand. Many of these reach-related cells were influenced by eye position information. Fewer cells displayed relationships to saccadic eye movements. The activity of most neurons related to a combination of both hand and eye signals. Many cells were also modulated during preparation for hand movement. Light-dark differences of activity were common and interpreted as related to the <b>sight</b> and <b>monitoring</b> of hand motion and/or position in the visual field. Most cells studied were very sensitive to moving visual stimuli and also responded to optic flow stimulation. Visual receptive fields were generally large and extended to the periphery of the visual field. For most neurons, the orientation of the preferred directions computed across different epochs and tasks conditions clustered within a limited sector of space, the field of global tuning. This can be regarded as an ideal frame to combine spatially congruent eye- and hand-related information for different forms of visuomanual behavior. All these properties were common to both PEc and V 6 A. Retinal, eye- and hand-related activity types, as well as parieto-frontal association calls, were distributed in a periodic fashion across the tangential domain of areas PEc and V 6 A. These functional and anatomical distributions were characterized and compared through a spectral and coherency analysis, which revealed the existence of a selective 'match' between activity types and parieto-frontal connections. This match depended on where each individual efferent projection was addressed. The results of the present and of the companion study can be relevant for a re-interpretation of optic ataxia as the consequence of the breakdown of the combination of retinal-, eye and hand-related directional signals within the global tuning fields of parietal neurons...|$|R
40|$|Neural {{activity}} {{was recorded in}} the parietooccipital cortex while monkeys performed different tasks aimed at investigating visuomotor interactions of retinal, eye, and arm-related signals on neural activity. The tasks were arm reaching I) to foveated targets; 2) to extrafoveal targets, with constant eye position; 3) within an instructed-delayed paradigm, under both light and darkness; 4) saccadic eye movements toward, and static eye holding on peripheral targets; and 5) visual fixation and stimulation. The activity of many cells was modulated during arm reaction (68 %) and movement time (58 %), and during static holding of the arm in space (64 %), when eye position was kept constant. Eye position influenced the activity of many cells during hand reaction (45 %) and movement time (51 %) and holding of hand static position (69 %). Many cells (56 %) were also modulated during preparation for hand movement, in the delayed reach task. Modulation was present also in the dark in 59 % of cells during this epoch, 51 % during reaction and movement time, and 48 % during eye/hand holding on the target. Cells (50 %) displaying light-dark differences of activity were considered as related to the <b>sight</b> and <b>monitoring</b> of hand motion and/or position in the visual field. Saccadic eye movements modulated a smaller percentage (25 %) of cells than eye position (68 %). Visual receptive fields were mapped in 44 % of the cells studied. They were generally large and extended to {{the periphery of the}} tested (30 degrees) visual field. Sixty-six percent of cells were motion sensitive. Therefore the activity of many neurons in this area reflects the combined influence of visual, eye, and arm movement-related signals. For most neurons, the orientation of the preferred directions computed across different epochs and tasks, therefore expression of all different eye- and hand-related activity types, clustered within a limited sector of space, the field of global tuning. These spatial fields might be an ideal frame to combine eye and hand signals, thanks to the congruence of their tuning properties. The relationships between cell activity and oculomotor and visuo-manual behavior were task dependent. During saccades, most cells were recruited when the eye moved to a spatial location that was also target for hand movement, whereas during hand movement most cells fired depending on whether or not the animal had prior knowledge about the location of the visual targets...|$|R
40|$|The {{airborne}} {{infrared spectrometer}} (AIR-Spec) is an imaging spectrometer that will observe the solar corona during the 2017 total solar eclipse. This eclipse {{will provide a}} unique opportunity to observe infrared emission lines in the corona. Five spectral lines are of particular interest because they may eventually be used to measure the coronal magnetic field. To avoid infrared absorption from atmospheric water vapor, AIR-Spec will be placed on an NSF Gulfstream aircraft flying above 14. 9 km. AIR-Spec must be capable of taking stable images while the plane moves. The instrument includes an image stabilization system, which uses fiber-optic gyroscopes to determine platform rotation, GPS to calculate the ephemeris of the sun, and a voltage-driven mirror to correct the line of <b>sight.</b> An operator <b>monitors</b> a white light image of the eclipse and manually corrects for residual drift. The image stabilization calculation is performed by a programmable automatic controller (PAC), which interfaces with the gyroscopes and mirror controller. The operator interfaces with a separate computer, which acquires images and computes the solar ephemeris. To ensure image stabilization is successful, a human machine interface (HMI) was developed to allow connection between the client and PAC. In order to make control of the instruments user friendly during the short eclipse observation, a graphical user interface (GUI) was also created. The GUI’s functionality includes turning image stabilization on and off, allowing the user to input information about the geometric setup, calculating the solar ephemeris, refining estimates of the initial aircraft attitude, and storing data from the PAC on the operator’s computer. It also displays time, location, attitude, ephemeris, gyro rates and mirror angles...|$|R
40|$|Independent {{navigation}} {{for blind}} individuals {{can be extremely}} difficult due to the inability to recognise and avoid obstacles. Assistive techniques such as white canes, guide dogs, and sensory substitution provide a degree of situational awareness by relying on touch or hearing but as yet there are no techniques that attempt {{to make use of}} any residual vision that the individual is likely to retain. Residual vision can restricted to the awareness of the orientation of a light source, and hence any information presented on a wearable display would have to limited and unambiguous. For improved situational awareness, i. e. for the detection of obstacles, displaying the size and position of nearby objects, rather than including finer surface details may be sufficient. To test whether a depth-based display could be used to navigate a small obstacle course, we built a real-time head-mounted display with a depth camera and software to detect the distance to nearby objects. Distance was represented as brightness on a low-resolution display positioned close to the eyes without the benefit focussing optics. A set of <b>sighted</b> participants were <b>monitored</b> as they learned to use this display to navigate the course. All were able to do so, and time and velocity rapidly improved with practise with no {{increase in the number of}} collisions. In a second experiment a cohort of severely sight-impaired individuals of varying aetiologies performed a search task using a similar low-resolution head-mounted display. The majority of participants were able to use the display to respond to objects in their central and peripheral fields at a similar rate to sighted controls. We conclude that the skill to use a depth-based display for obstacle avoidance can be rapidly acquired and the simplified nature of the display may appropriate for the development of an aid for sight-impaired individuals...|$|R
