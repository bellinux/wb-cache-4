5|$|Many {{families}} of moths have special organs to help detect bat echolocation. These organs {{are known as}} tympana (singular – typanum). The Pyraloidea and almost all Geometroidea have tympana located on the anterior <b>sternite</b> of the abdomen. The Noctuoidea also have tympana, but in their case, the tympana are located {{on the underside of}} the metathorax, the structure and position of which are unique and a taxonomic distinguishing feature of the superfamily.|$|E
5|$|Millipede bodies may be {{flattened}} or cylindrical, and {{are composed}} of numerous metemeric segments, each with an exoskeleton consisting of five chitinous plates: a single plate above (the tergite), one at each side (pleurites), and a plate on the underside (<b>sternite)</b> where the legs attach. In many millipedes, these plates are fused to varying degrees, sometimes forming a single cylindrical ring. The plates are typically hard, being impregnated with calcium salts. Because they lack a waxy cuticle, millipedes are susceptible to water loss and must {{spend most of their}} time in moist or humid environments.|$|E
5|$|The genus is {{characterized}} by workers which have head-capsules that are trapazoidal in shape, narrowing at the front and widening towards {{the rear of the}} capsule. The oval compound eyes are generally placed slightly {{to the rear of the}} capsules midpoint, and lacking ocelli completely. The mandibles have a number of teeth along the masticatory margin (the middle area of the mandibles) and an overall triangular shape. The gaster has a flat first tergite that does not cover the petiole, a flat fourth abdominal <b>sternite.</b>|$|E

5|$|The ant has pubescence (soft short hair) {{abundant}} throughout some {{certain parts}} of the body, including the funiculi and tarsi. It is more sparse on the coxae, genae (an area {{on both sides of the}} head below the eyes), gaster and gula (the reduced <b>sternite</b> of the first segment of the thorax). Hairs on the scapes point downwards. Erect and suberect hair are seen all over the body in sparse numbers, although this varies. These hairs are not as abundant in comparison to other Novomessor species. The head and thorax are both -colored, and the epinotal spines, legs and node are yellowish red. The antennal scapes are reddish brown and the abdomen is piceous brown. The hair exhibits a gold-like color. The suture is absent from the thorax, and the mesonotum is wider than the epinotum. The front portion of the mesonotum is narrow whereas the back is rectangular. The node is evenly round and oval shaped, the postpetiole is narrow at the front and the dorsum is feebly convex. The gaster is large and oval shaped.|$|E
25|$|Ant attacks {{represent}} a large predatory pressure for {{many species of}} wasps, including the Polistes versicolor. These wasps possess a gland located in the VI abdominal <b>sternite</b> (van de Vecht’s gland) that is primarily responsible for making an ant repellent substance. Tufts of hair {{near the edge of}} the VI abdominal <b>sternite</b> store and apply the ant repellent, secreting the ant repellent through a rubbing behavior.|$|E

25|$|The {{posterior}} {{portion of}} the fly's metathorax, or scutellum, has a pair of stout processes, and often the laterotergite (one {{of a number of}} lateral flanges) of the postnotum (a small dorsal sclerite on the insect thorax posterior to the notum) has a dome-like swelling or spine-like process.

25|$|Pheromone {{communication}} {{can be used}} {{to recruit}} workers to a food source, a new nesting site, or a place where work is required. The pheromone is released from the abdomen of the wasp, {{at the base of the}} fifth <b>sternite.</b> It is excreted by Richard's glands. The pheromone has a strong leather-like odor, and looks like brownish wax. Because of the strong odor, workers can easily follow a pheromone trail left by other colony members. The pheromone is produced slowly and continuously throughout life, so it can be used up if used too often or too quickly. Another species that exhibits this behavior is Synoeca surinama.|$|E

25|$|P. exigua are small, swarm {{founding}} wasps. One {{can determine}} the wasps’ age by evaluating {{the darkness of the}} cuticle on the apical edge of the fifth gastral <b>sternite.</b> Older wasps typically exhibit darker shades relative to others in its colony. The front wing length is generally 4.15mm, and their wings are more rounded than other wasps. This round wing shape may enhance the wasp species’ flying abilities and increase fitness. The muscle mass on P. exigua’s mesosoma directly contributes to flight power; the larger the muscle, the stronger the output. Instead of flapping their wings, P. exigua row them due to increased wing drag. Mature P. exigua eggs have a complete chorion and are tinted blue with a shiny coat. Immature oocytes that are equal in size to mature eggs can be distinguished due to their cream and less glossy appearance.|$|E
