40|$|An {{accident}} is unexpected, unusual, unintended and identifiable {{external event}} which occurs at any place and at any time. The major concern {{faced by the}} government and traffic officials is over speeding at limited speed zones like hospitals, schools or residential places leading to causalities and more deaths on the roads. Hence the speed of the vehicles is to be regulated and confined to the limits as prescribed by the traffic regulations. In this paper we propose a solution in the form of providing E-speed governor fitted with a wireless communication system consisting of a Rx which receives the information regarding the speed regulation for their zones.

40|$|Along {{with water}} and air {{pollution}}, noise pollution has become a hazard {{to the quality of}} life in Dhaka. The noise level in different locations of the metropolitan area exceeds specified standard limits by as much as 20 dB. In the "so-called" <b>silent</b> <b>zones,</b> it does not fall below 55 dB even in the morning hours. World Health Organization (WHO) identified many adverse effects of long exposure to moderate level noise or sudden exposure to excessive noise. It is reported that most of the dwellers of Dhaka are not aware of the ill effects of noise pollution. They even do not consider noise a pollutant, and take it as a part of routine life. In this context, a survey is conducted to explore the sources, effects, reactions and suggestions for controlling the excessive noise. It investigates the effectiveness of the current administrative measures to abate the problem of noise pollution. The survey indicates that noise results in reduced efficiency and affects individual social behavior. It also causes interference in speech communication and sleeplessness. It appears that, now-a-days, people are becoming more aware of the bad impacts of noise pollution and of the significance of noise pollution control. But still there is much work to be done to educate the people in this regard. QC 20120126 </p...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE. Activity {{in regions}} of the visual cortex {{corresponding}} to central scotomas in subjects with macular degeneration (MD) is considered evidence for functional reorganization in the brain. Three unresolved issues related to cortical activity in subjects with MD were addressed: Is the cortical response to stimuli presented to the preferred retinal locus (PRL) different from other retinal loci at the same eccentricity? What effect does the role of age of onset and etiology of MD have on cortical responses? How do functional responses in an MD subject's visual cortex vary for task and stimulus conditions? METHODS. Eight MD subjects-four with age-related onset (AMD) and four with juvenile onset (JMD) -and two agematched normal vision controls, participated in three testing conditions while undergoing {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI). First, subjects viewed a small stimulus presented at the PRL compared with a non-PRL control location to investigate the role of the PRL. Second, they viewed a full-field flickering checkerboard compared with a small stimulus in the original fovea to investigate brain activation with passive viewing. Third, they performed a one-back task with scene images to investigate brain activation with active viewing. RESULTS. A small stimulus at the PRL generated more extensive cortical activation than at a non-PRL location, but neither yielded activation in the foveal cortical projection. Both passive and active viewing of full-field stimuli left a <b>silent</b> <b>zone</b> at the posterior pole of the occipital cortex, implying a lack of complete cortical reorganization. The <b>silent</b> <b>zone</b> was smaller in the task requiring active viewing compared with the task requiring passive viewing, especially in JMD subjects. CONCLUSIONS. The PRL for MD subjects has more extensive cortical representation than a retinal region with matched eccentricity. There is evidence for incomplete functional reorganization of early visual cortex in both JMD and AMD. Functional reorganization is more prominent in JMD. Feedback signals, possibly associated with attention, play an important. © Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Yoga is {{a unique}} form of expert {{movement}} that promotes an increasingly subtle interpenetration of thought and movement. The mindful nature of its practice, even at expert levels, challenges the idea that thought and mind are inevitably disruptive to absorbed coping. Building on parallel phenomenological and ethnographic studies of skilful performance and embodied apprenticeship, we argue for the importance in yoga of mental access to embodied movement during skill execution {{by way of a}} case study of instruction and practice in two related traditions, Iyengar and Anusara. Sharing a pose repertoire, they are based on distinctive philosophical systems with different teaching styles and metaphoric structures. To address relations between pedagogy and practice in embodied expertise, and to investigate the reciprocal influences of embodiment and thought, we explore in detail the linguistically mediated learning context where practitioners work with yoga teachers. Here, the mind/body problem comes to practical life. We demonstrate the effects of words on bodies, as knowledge is literally incorporated. We show why interpersonal influence on our movement capacities is sometimes needed to enhance expertise. We theorize and identify 'signature patterns of tension' among practitioners. These patterns have four sources: ghost gestures, innate differences in bodily form, functional fusing, and signature patterns of affective experience, modulation and expression. These patterns of tension produce 'silent zones', cognitively impenetrable actions, functional fusing of a skilful, compensatory form, and signature patterns of pain and damage. We show how instruction can disrupt these <b>silent</b> <b>zones,</b> enhancing mental and physical flexibility. 19 page(s...|$|R

Traffi c noise was measured using the L eq index with an A-weighted scale of decibel unit for a 1 -hour period at each study location. Based on fi eld observed traffi c data, a multiple regression noise prediction model was developed by considering all major causative factors. In the process of model develop-ment, a mean standard error of 2. 32 dB(A) with r 2 value of 0. 82 was observed. The validation of the model was done by collecting traffi c data from Mysore city in Karnataka, India.
