40|$|We {{examine the}} pairing {{structure}} of holes injected into two distinct spin backgrounds: a short-range antiferromagnetic phase vs. a symmetry protected topological phase. We find strong binding between two holes in both phases, {{as well as}} significant phase fluctuations embedded in pair-pair correlations by density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulation. By decomposing the pairing contribution into a Cooper pairing and a phase component, a strong phase fluctuation is identified with an intrinsic <b>string</b> <b>operator</b> controlled by the spin-spin correlation. We show that while a strongly enhanced pairing amplitude {{is responsible for the}} pairing ground state, the coherent Cooper pairing is substantially weakened by the phase fluctuation, which bears an interesting resemblance to the precursor of pseudogap physics.

40|$|We {{introduce}} the quantum dimer-pentamer model (QDPM) {{on the square}} lattice. This model is a generalization of the square lattice quantum dimer model as its configuration space comprises fully-packed hard-core dimer coverings as well as dimer configurations containing pentamers, where four dimers touch a vertex. Thus in the QDPM, the fully-packed, hard-core constraint of the quantum dimer model is relaxed such that the local dimer number at each vertex is fixed modulo 3, resulting in an exact local $Z_ 3 $ gauge symmetry. We construct a local Hamiltonian for which the Rokhsar-Kivelson (RK) equal superposition state is the exact ground state and has a 9 -fold topological degeneracy on the torus. Using Monte Carlo calculations, we find no spontaneous symmetry breaking in the RK wavefunction and that its dimer-dimer correlation function decays exponentially. By doping the QDPM RK state {{with a pair of}} monomers, we demonstrate that $Z_ 3 $ electric charges are deconfined. Additionally, we introduce a $Z_ 3 $ magnetic <b>string</b> <b>operator</b> that we find decays exponentially and shows no signatures of magnetic vortex condensation and with correlations. These numerical results suggest that the ground state of the QDPM is a dimer liquid with $Z_ 3 $ topological order. Comment: 12 pages, 12 figure...|$|E
40|$|Talk {{given at}} the {{workshop}} "Recent Advances in Perturbative QCD and Hadronic Physics" Trento, 20 - 25 July 2009 : honoring the 75 th birthday of Prof. A. V. EfremovAfter a brief introduction to Deep Inelastic Scattering in the Bjorken limit and in the Regge Limit we discuss the operator product expansion in terms of non local <b>string</b> <b>operator</b> {{and in terms of}} Wilson lines. We will show how the high-energy behavior of amplitudes in gauge theories can be reformulated in terms of the evolution of Wilson-line operators. In the leading order this evolution is governed by the non-linear Balitsky- Kovchegov (BK) equation. In order to see if this equation is relevant for existing or future deep inelastic scattering (DIS) accelerators (like Electron Ion Collider (EIC) or Large Hadron electron Collider (LHeC)) one needs to know the next-to-leading order (NLO) corrections. In addition, the NLO corrections define the scale of the running-coupling constant in the BK equation and therefore determine the magnitude of the leading-order cross sections. In Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), the next-to-leading order BK equation has both conformal and non-conformal parts. The NLO kernel for the composite operators resolves in a sum of the conformal part and the running-coupling part. The QCD and N= 4 SYM kernel of the BK equation is presented...|$|E
40|$|We {{discuss the}} {{various aspects of}} {{two-dimensional}} QCD_ 2 (N→∞) (the 't Hooft modelHooft). Our main interest (motivated by the corresponding analysis in the four dimensional QCD) is the vacuum structure of the theory. We use the very general methods in the analysis, such as dispersion relations and duality in order to relate the known spectrum of QCD_ 2 to the different vacuum characteristics. We explicitly calculate (in terms of physical parameters like masses and matrix elements) the chiral condensate {{as well as the}} mixed vacuum condensates: 0 |q̅(gϵ_μν G_μν) ^nq | 0 ∼ M_eff^ 2 n 0 |q̅ q | 0.

We interpret the factorization property for the mixed vacuum condensates shown above as a reminiscent of the master field at large N. Bearing in mind that the gauge-variant function 0 | q̅(x) q(0) | 0 describes the propagator of the original quark field, we interpret the similar, but gauge invariant object 0 | W| 0 which is turned out to be Bessel function, as a two-dimensional free propagator of the effective constituent quark with imaginary mass...|$|E

40|$|In {{the context}} of the {{fuzzball}} programme, we investigate deforming the microscopic string description of the D 1 -D 5 system on T^ 4 xS^ 1 away from the orbifold point. Using conformal perturbation theory and a generalization of Lunin-Mathur symmetric orbifold technology for computing twist-nontwist correlators developed in a companion work, we initiate a program to compute the anomalous dimensions of low-lying string states in the D 1 -D 5 superconformal field theory. Our method entails finding four-point functions involving a <b>string</b> <b>operator</b> O of interest and the deformation operator, taking coincidence limits to identify which other operators mix with O, subtracting the identified conformal family to isolate other contributions to the four-point function, finding the mixing coefficients, and iterating. For the lowest-lying string modes, this procedure should truncate in a finite number of steps. We check our method by showing how the operator dual to the dilaton does not participate in mixing that would change its conformal dimension, as expected. Next we complete the first stage of the iteration procedure for a low-lying string state of the form ∂ X ∂ X ∂̅X ∂̅X and find its mixing coefficient. Our main qualitative result is evidence of operator mixing at first order in the deformation parameter, which means that the string state acquires an anomalous dimension. After diagonalization this will mean that anomalous dimensions of some string states in the D 1 -D 5 SCFT must decrease away from the orbifold point while others increase.

40|$|Recently Haah {{introduced}} a new quantum error correcting code embedded on a cubic lattice. One of the defining properties of this code {{is the absence of}} <b>string</b> logical <b>operator.</b> We present new codes with similar properties by relaxing the condition on the local particle dimension. The resulting code is well-defined when the local Hilbert space dimension is prime. These codes can be divided into two different classes: the local stabilizer generators are either symmetric or antisymmetric with respect to the inversion operation. These is a nontrivial correspondence between these two classes. For any symmetric code without <b>string</b> logical <b>operator,</b> there exists a complementary antisymmetric code with the same property and vice versa. We derive a sufficient condition for the absence of <b>string</b> logical <b>operator</b> in terms of the algebraic constraints on the defining parameters of the code.
