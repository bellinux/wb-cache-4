[...] They had twelve children, six {{boys and}} six girls: Oliver William Foster (1878–1955), Francis Brodie (1880–1967), Alec (1881–1938), Lionel (1883–1948), Noel (1885–1962), Violet (1888–1924), Raymond (1889–1915), Honor (1891–1979), Lorna (1892–1987), Norah (1894–1990), Barbara (1896–1983), and Rosalynde (1896–1983). Four {{of his sons}} went into {{business}} using Lodge's inventions. [...] Brodie and Alec created the Lodge Plug Company, which manufactured <b>sparking</b> <b>plugs</b> for cars and aeroplanes. [...] Lionel and Noel founded a company that produced an electrostatic device for cleaning factory and smelter smoke in 1913, called the Lodge Fume Deposit Company Limited (changed in 1919 to Lodge Fume Company Limited and in 1922, through agreement with the International Precipitation Corporation of California, to Lodge Cottrell Ltd). Oliver, the eldest son, became a poet and author.|$|E

(Illustrated at http://www.marxwildwest.com/cartoons%20-%20non-disney.html).

40|$|Abstract Cycle-resolved {{measurements}} of the fuel concentration near a <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> in both a commercial spark-ignition piston engine and a commercial rotary engine were performed. An in situ laser infrared (IR) absorption method was developed using a <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> sensor and a 3. 392 -μm He–Ne laser as the light source. This wavelength coincided with the absorption line of hydrocarbons. The newly developed IR <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> sensor had a higher signal-to-noise ratio than its previous version due to the optimization of its quartz lens and two optical fibers. The new sensor provided quantitative cycle-resolved fuel concentration measurements around the <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> with a high temporal resolution. At lean preset air/fuel (A/F) ratios, fuel was mixed with the surrounding air gradually near the <b>spark</b> <b>plug.</b> Strong mixture inhomogeneities were measured during the compression stroke; the magnitude of these inhomogeneities decreased throughout the compression stroke. There was {{a strong correlation between}} the fuel concentration measured with the <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> sensor and the combustion characteristics during the initial combustion period, which occurred faster when conditions were slightly richer than stoichiometric near the <b>spark</b> <b>plug.</b> The indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP) was slightly related to the A/F ratio near the <b>spark</b> <b>plug.</b> It was possible to measure the cycle-resolved A/F ratio near the <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> and investigate its cycle-to-cycle fluctuations t...|$|R
