40|$|Abstract. Vitreous enamel is a glassy coating {{formed on}} a metal {{substrate}} by firing at temperatures above 800 °C. The quality of <b>vitreous</b> enamel <b>coating</b> depends on the pre-treatment of the steel substrate surface {{and the quality of}} enamel slip. The main aim {{of this study was to}} characterize the composition of the steel substrate surface after firing with double finish, to explain the effect of steel substrate surface pre-treatment (blasting, acid pickling) on forming the phase interface of the steel substrate – <b>vitreous</b> <b>coating</b> system, and on its final microhardness, fracture strength and the adhesive properties of the coating. To achieve these aims, the following experimental methods were used: Mössbauer spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, electron analyzer, and EDAX. Based on the chemical composition of the initial enamel slip and the firing technology, the metal- enamel system interface exhibited various ratios of layers of magnetite, hematite, nonstoichiometric wüstite, and crystals of faylite. The measuring results indicate that the quality and age of enamel slip influences the brittle fracture properties of <b>vitreous</b> enamel <b>coating...</b>|$|R
40|$|In this study, phase {{transformation}} of the vitreous enamel and the interface steel–enamel during firing was analyzed. The thermal transformation of <b>vitreous</b> <b>coating</b> on steel was observed “in situ” with an environmental scanning electron microscopy and the mechanical properties of the steel–enamel interface were studied by using a nano-indenter. The interface reactions and the resulting structure can strongly influence the adhesion mechanism between glass coatings and the metal substrate. An in-depth investigation and structural characterization was therefore performed todefine the correlation between interface morphology and the final chemical and mechanical properties of the enamel–steel interface...|$|R
5000|$|The {{technology}} for glass beadmaking {{is among the}} oldest human arts, dating back 3,000 years (Dubin, 1987). Glass beads have been dated back to at least Roman times. Perhaps the earliest glass-like beads were Egyptian faience beads, a form of clay bead with a self-forming <b>vitreous</b> <b>coating.</b> Glass beads are significant in archaeology because the presence of glass beads often indicate that there was trade and that the beadmaking technology was being spread. In addition, {{the composition of the}} glass beads could be analyzed and help archaeologists understand the sources of the beads.|$|R
5000|$|Vitreous enamel, {{also called}} {{porcelain}} enamel, is a material made by fusing powdered glass to a substrate by firing, usually between 750 and 850 C. The powder melts, flows, and then hardens to a smooth, durable <b>vitreous</b> <b>coating</b> on metal, or on glass or ceramics. So in technical terms fired enamelware is an integrated layered composite {{of glass and}} metal. Enamelling is an old and widely adopted technology, {{for most of its}} history mainly used in jewelry and decorative art. [...] "Enamelled" [...] and [...] "enamelling" [...] are the preferred spellings in British English, while [...] "enameled" [...] and [...] "enameling" [...] are preferred in American English.|$|R
25|$|The bonding {{between the}} glass or {{ceramics}} {{and the glass}} solder can be either covalent, or, more often, van der Waals. The seal can be leak-tight; glass soldering is frequently used in vacuum technology. Glass solders can be also used as sealants; a <b>vitreous</b> enamel <b>coating</b> on iron lowered its permeability to hydrogen 10 times. Glass solders are frequently used for glass-to-metal seals and glass-ceramic-to-metal seals.|$|R
40|$|An {{innovative}} vitreous-ceramic coating for {{reinforcing steel}} that incorporates reactive calcium silicates from portland cement in an alkali-resistant glass {{has been shown}} both to increase the bond between the concrete to the reinforcing steel {{and to protect the}} steel from corrosion. The new enamel coating eliminates the weak layer that is associated with the interface between the steel and surrounding concrete. The <b>vitreous</b> <b>coating</b> is applied to the steel using the same proc-ess involved in porcelain enameling. In applying the enamel, the rod is coated with a porcelain slip containing portland cement and heated to approximately 1, 562 °F (850 °C) for 5 to 10 minutes to allow the molten glass to fuse {{to the surface of the}} iron and the portland-cement component to become bonded to and embedded in the glass. The result is a tough, abrasion-resistant, hermetically-tight coating that develops the adhering properties of a portland-cement paste when contacted by fresh concrete. Bleed water from the fresh concrete that normally produces a weak interfacial transition zone is taken up by the hydration of the surface layer of reactive calcium silicate. After only 7 days of curing, the chemical bond that forms is typically three to four times greater than that observe...|$|R
40|$|Effect of Fine Clay Fraction on Functional Properties of Vitreous Enamel Coatings Final brittle-fracture {{properties}} of <b>vitreous</b> enamel <b>coating</b> {{are dependent on}} its structure, texture and chemical composition. The most important inorganic components during production of this coating are clay and fritted glass. Usage of various sizes of these components influences final quality of the coating. The main goal of this thesis was to compare functional {{properties of}} vitreous enamel coatings made by using commonly-dimensioned and nano-dimensioned particles.

5000|$|Egyptian faience is a sintered-quartz ceramic {{displaying}} surface vitrification {{which creates}} a bright lustre of various colours, with blue-green {{being the most}} common. Defined as a “material made from powdered quartz covered with a true <b>vitreous</b> <b>coating,</b> usually in a transparent blue or green isotropic glass," [...] faience is distinct from the crystalline compound Egyptian blue. Notably, faience is considerably more porous than glass proper and can be cast in molds to create vessels or objects. Although not properly pottery, as (until late periods) it contains no clay and instead contains the major elemental components of glass (silica), faience is frequently discussed in surveys of ancient pottery, as in stylistic and art-historical terms objects made in it are closer to pottery styles than ancient Egyptian glass. Egyptian faience was very widely used for small objects from beads to small statues, and is found in both elite and popular contexts. It {{was the most common}} material for scarabs and other forms of amulet and shabti figures, and used in most forms of ancient Egyptian jewellery, as the glaze made it smooth against the skin. Larger applications included cups and bowls, and wall tiles, mostly used for temples. The well-known blue figures of a hippopotamus, placed in the tombs of officials, can be up to 20 cm long, approaching the maximum practical size for faience, though the Victoria and Albert Museum in London has a 215.9 cm faience sceptre from Egypt dated 1427-1400 BC.|$|R
40|$|Several ribbon growth {{experiments}} were performed from V-shaped dies coated with CVD Si 3 N 4. The most significant {{result was the}} ability to perform five consecutive growth runs from the same die without mechanical degradation of the die through temperature cycling. The die was made from <b>vitreous</b> carbon <b>coated</b> with CVD Si 3 N 4. Silicon oxynitride, Si 2 N 2 O, was examined with respect to thermal stability in contact with molten silicon. The results of X-ray analysis indicate that this material is converted to both alpha - and beta-Si 3 N 4 {{in the presence of}} molten silicon. Experiments on the stability of CVD SiOxNy shoe that this material can be maintained in contact with molten silicon (sessile drop test) for greater than 30 h at 1450 C without total decompositon. These layers are converted mainly to beta-Si 3 N 4...|$|R
40|$|Failures in {{vitreous}} {{surgery for}} complex vitreoretinal disorders are frequently {{due to an}} inability to keep preexisting or iatrogenic retinal breaks permanently closed. We have used transvitreally delivered cyanoacrylate tissue adhesive to seal retinal breaks in <b>selected</b> patients undergoing <b>vitreous</b> surgery for complicated retinal detachment. With a minimum follow-up period of 6 months, all but one retinal hole have remained closed and complete retinal reattachment posterior to the encircling buckle was achieved in 18 of 25 eyes (72 %).

40|$|The {{oxidation}} of borohydride ions on three-dimensional electrodes such as <b>vitreous</b> carbon (RVC) <b>coated</b> {{with gold}} nanoparticles and silver porous sponge material was investigated. The RVC electrodes {{were covered with}} gold using PVD sputtering for different times of exposure. The open pore silver sponge electrode was prepared by the calcination of dextran or starch polymers, used as a framework, and silver nitrate mixtures between 400 and 600 °C. The porous silver was characterised by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and showed pore sizes between 1 and 20 ?m. The activity of these electrodes as anode catalysts for the direct oxidation of borohydride was evaluated by cyclic voltammetry in 0. 02 mol dm? 3 NaBH 4 plus 3 mol dm? 3 NaOH. The number electrons, the charge transfer coefficient and the homogeneous and kinetic rate constants were calculated and the values are comparable with those reported in the literatur...|$|R
40|$|Massive premacular {{hemorrhage}} {{can cause}} sudden visual loss. We sought {{to evaluate the}} efficacy, safety and visual outcome of nonvitrectomizing vitreous surgery with intravitreal tissue plasminogen activator (t-pa) for long-lasting thick premacular hemorrhage. This retrospective, interventional study examined three consecutive eyes of three patients who received nonvitrectomizing vitreous surgery with intravitreal t-pa {{for the treatment of}} non-recent massive premacular hemorrhage. Detailed ophthalmoscopic examinations were performed pre- and postoperatively to evaluate the visual outcome, the resolution of premacular hemorrhage and the changes in lenticular opacity. In all three eyes, the premacular hemorrhage cleared after the procedure. Final best-corrected visual acuities improved from 6 / 30 to 6 / 10 in patient 1, 2 / 60 to 6 / 4 in patient 2, and 3 / 60 to 6 / 6 in patient 3. Operated and fellow eyes did not differ in terms of nuclear sclerosis. No complications from the procedure were noted. In these <b>selected</b> cases, nonvitrectomizing <b>vitreous</b> surgery with intravitreal t-pa was an effective and safe alternative treatment for non-recent massive premacular hemorrhage...|$|R
