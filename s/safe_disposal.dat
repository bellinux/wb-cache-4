The fatwā was issued following a two-day meeting of more than a hundred ulama to consider {{the pros and cons of}} the proposal addressed by government ministers, scientists and critics. The decision cited both positive and negative aspects of the proposal, which it had balanced to make its judgment. Key concerns were the question of long-term <b>safe</b> <b>disposal</b> and storage of radioactive waste, the potential local and regional environmental consequences of the plant’s operation, the lack of financial clarity about the project, and issues of foreign technological dependence.|$|E
25|$|Although discontinued, this {{application}} {{is also one}} of the most concern to the general public. The vast majority of older pressure-treated wood was treated with CCA. CCA lumber is still in widespread use in many countries, and was heavily used during the latter half of the 20th century as a structural and outdoor building material. Although the use of CCA lumber was banned in many areas after studies showed that arsenic could leach out of the wood into the surrounding soil (from playground equipment, for instance), a risk is also presented by the burning of older CCA timber. The direct or indirect ingestion of wood ash from burnt CCA lumber has caused fatalities in animals and serious poisonings in humans; the lethal human dose is approximately 20grams of ash. Scrap CCA lumber from construction and demolition sites may be inadvertently used in commercial and domestic fires. Protocols for <b>safe</b> <b>disposal</b> of CCA lumber are not consistent throughout the world. Widespread landfill disposal of such timber raises some concern, but other studies have shown no arsenic contamination in the groundwater.|$|E

2500|$|The National Sanitation Policy (NSP), {{approved}} {{by the federal government}} in 2006, promotes the grassroots concept of community-led total sanitation (CLTS) in communities with less than 1,000 inhabitants.

The objective is the <b>safe</b> <b>disposal</b> of excreta through the use of latrines, the creation of an [...] "open defecation free environment", <b>safe</b> <b>disposal</b> of liquid and solid waste and the promotion of health and hygiene practices.

At that time, there were over 29 bomb disposal squadrons in the RAF with upwards of 870 personnel spread across them. In the Second World War, the RAF looked after airfields and anything that involved ordnance dropped from aircraft (Axis or Allied), the Royal Navy looked after naval ordnance and the rest was taken care of by the Royal Engineers of the British Army. By the end of the war in Europe (VE Day), the RAF bomb disposal branch had dealt with over 176,000 weapons in Britain and Europe.

Some {{of the problems with}} B38 date back to the 1972 miners' strike: the reactors were pushed so hard that waste processing could not keep up, and [...] "cladding and fuel were simply thrown into B38's cooling ponds and left to disintegrate."

2500|$|Depending on {{the source}} and ingredients, there are various {{ways in which the}} public can dispose of {{pharmaceutical}} and personal care products. In the case of pharmaceutical products, the most environmentally <b>safe</b> <b>disposal</b> method is {{to take advantage of a}} community drug take-back programs that collect drugs at a central location for proper disposal. [...] Several local public health departments in the United States have initiated pharmaceutical take-back programs. In addition, the United States Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) periodically promotes local take-back programs as well as a program called the National Take Back Initiative. Currently, take back programs are funded by state or local health departments or are volunteer programs through pharmacies or health care providers. In recent years, the proposition that pharmaceutical companies should be responsible for their products “from the cradle to the grave,” has been gaining traction. [...] This philosophy suggests that the manufacturers should fund the proper disposal of pharmaceutical products. Take back programs should exist in every community, and if further information is required on the matter the city officials should be contacted.

40|$|Fly ash from {{municipal}} solid waste incinerators (MSWI) is classified as hazardous in the European Waste Catalogue. Proper stabilization processes should be required before any management option is put into practice. Due to the inorganic nature of MSWI fly ash, cementitious stabilization processes are worthy of consideration. However, the effectiveness of such processes can be severely compromised by the high content of soluble chlorides and sulphates. In this paper, a preliminary washing treatment has been optimized to remove {{as much as possible}} soluble salts by employing as little as possible water. Two different operating conditions (single-step and two-step) have been developed to this scope. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that stabilized systems containing 20 % of binder are suitable for <b>safer</b> <b>disposal</b> as well as for material recovery in the field of road basement (cement bound granular material layer).
