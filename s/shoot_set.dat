5000|$|A promotional {{video was}} {{released}} {{a few days}} after the release of the song in digital format at his official site on September 5, 2009. It showed Bublé in a photo <b>shoot</b> <b>set</b> wearing a dark brown jacket against a white background.The video solely revolves around him in the photo shoot session. The official music video was directed by Rich Lee and was released on October 1, 2009. The video is about Bublé in a supermarket (Killarney Market on 49th Avenue in Vancouver, BC, Canada in the Killarney neighbourhood [...] ) and after meeting a blonde woman (Luisana Lopilato) in an aisle, all the customers, staff, and a cameo appearance of the West Vancouver Youth Band, start dancing around the store in celebration, eventually moving outside to the parking lot as confetti descends. The video then cuts to Bublé at the till with the cashier handing him his receipt while he is still seemingly lost in daydreams. An embarrassed Bublé then takes the receipt and walks out with everyone staring at him. As he is about to exit the supermarket, he sees the blonde woman from his daydream walking into the supermarket. He takes a glance at her and walks out of the supermarket perplexed. The music video is a tribute to a scene in the 1986 film Ferris Bueller's Day Off when Ferris Bueller leads a parade through the Chicago streets lip-syncing to The Beatles' version of [...] "Twist and Shout". After filming the video Bublé and Lopilato later became engaged and were married on March 31, 2011 in Argentina.|$|E
