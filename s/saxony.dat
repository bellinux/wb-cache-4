5|$|After {{the death}} of Agnes-Anna, Béla {{proposed}} to Theodora, a granddaughter of Emperor Manuel I's sister, Theodora Komnene. However, a synod of the Byzantine Church forbade the marriage in 1185, because Theodora had entered a nunnery. In late 1185 or {{at the beginning of}} 1186, Béla asked for the hand of Matilda of <b>Saxony,</b> a daughter of Henry the Lion, Duke of <b>Saxony,</b> but Henry II of England, Matilda's grandfather, hindered this marriage. Finally, Béla married Henry II's widowed daughter-in-law, Margaret of France, in the summer of 1186. She was the daughter of Louis VII of France. Queen Margaret outlived Béla, and moved to the Holy Land after his death.|$|E

His family was of Polish origin. Nonetheless, in his {{childhood}} and youth he grew up surrounded by German culture in <b>Saxony,</b> and signed his name as Johann Heinrich Dąbrowski. He fought in the War of the Bavarian Succession (1778–1779), during which time his father died. Shortly afterward in 1780 he married Gustawa Rackel. He lived in Dresden, and steadily progressed through ranks, becoming a Rittmeister in 1789. He served as Adjutant general of King Frederick Augustus I of <b>Saxony</b> from 1788 to 1791.|$|E

5|$|In 1700 Sweden was {{attacked}} {{by a coalition of}} <b>Saxony,</b> Russia, and Denmark–Norway. <b>Saxony,</b> under Augustus II, invaded Swedish oversea dominions in Livonia and quickly attacked the city of Riga. Meanwhile, Frederick IV of Denmark attacked the Swedish allied duchies of Holstein and Gottorp in order to secure his rear, before commencing with the planned invasion of Scania, which had been previously annexed by Sweden in the Treaty of Roskilde in 1658. A short time later, Russia under Peter I swept into Swedish Ingria and besieged the strategic city of Narva. Unprepared for these developments, the Swedes were forced into a war on three fronts.|$|E
5|$|In 1702, Swedish forces {{invaded the}} Commonwealth {{as part of}} the Great Northern War, which had begun in 1700 between the Swedish Empire and the Tsardom of Russia. Augustus II, king of Poland and Elector of <b>Saxony,</b> was an ally of the Russian tsar Peter I. Augustus's forces were defeated, and the king himself was forced back to <b>Saxony.</b> He was {{replaced}} by Charles with Stanisław Leszczyński, a Polish nobleman and count of the Holy Roman Empire. Poniatowski, serving as a negotiator between the Wielkopolska Confederation and Charles XII, took the side of Leszczyński and distanced himself from the Sapiehas, formerly his patrons.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} 1538, {{shortly before}} the Catholic Duke Georg of <b>Saxony</b> died, a {{religious}} colloquy was convened in Leipzig to discuss potential reforms within the Duchy. The Electorate of <b>Saxony</b> sent Melanchthon, and Philip of Hesse sent Bucer. The Duchy itself was represented by Georg Witzel, a former Lutheran who had reconverted to Catholicism. In discussions from 2 to 7 January 1539, Bucer and Witzel agreed to defer controversial points of doctrine, but Melanchthon withdrew, feeling that doctrinal unity was a prerequisite of a reform plan. Bucer and Witzel agreed on fifteen articles covering various issues of church life. Bucer, however, made no doctrinal concessions: he remained silent on critical matters such as the mass and the papacy. His ecumenical approach provoked harsh criticism from other reformers.|$|E

5|$|Charles had won {{one of his}} {{greatest}} victories at Grodno 1706, by simply cutting off his opponents' resources and supplies. Later, {{in a letter to}} his ally Frederick IV of Denmark, Peter I confirmed losses of up to 17,000 men during the encirclement and retreat. After his pursuit of the Russian army, having chased them out of Lithuania, Charles saw his opportunity to march back to Poland in order to meet up with Rehnskiöld, in preparation for the invasion of <b>Saxony.</b> He arrived there in August 5. Meanwhile, Schulenburg did what he could in an attempt to increase the Saxon army to measure the expected invasion from the Swedes, something which was proven close to impossible after the battle of Fraustadt. In a last attempt to stop the invasion, Augustus II of <b>Saxony</b> offered Courland to Sweden and Lithuania to the newly crowned king Stanisław I of Poland. The generous offer was, however denied by Charles who crossed the Saxon border in September 5. As <b>Saxony</b> was close to defenseless, the Swedes could easily push away any resisting troops. In September 19, they occupied the city of Leipzig which finally forced Augustus into unconditional peace under Swedish terms. Among other things, the traitor and second principal behind the Grodno campaign, Johann Patkul was turned into Swedish custody.|$|E
5|$|Germany: The {{species is}} known from two {{different}} areas in the country. In 2005 and 2006, specimens were caught in an old moist forest near the Rhine in western Baden-Württemberg. Two other bats were found in highway tunnels close to this site. The species is also known from the Kyffhäuser hill range of Thuringia in central Germany, an island of relatively warm habitat with some unusual wildlife. There, bats were caught near a spring in a karst landscape amid oak-dominated deciduous forest. The species was also recorded in deciduous forest at a former Soviet military training site in eastern Thuringia. M.alcathoe has also been recorded in the nearby states of Saxony-Anhalt and <b>Saxony,</b> where it occurs in mixed deciduous forest. Many Saxony-Anhalt records are from near water. However, the species was also recorded {{in the center of}} the city of Chemnitz in <b>Saxony.</b>|$|E
