Today’s communication standards demand both high frequency accuracy and fast frequency <b>settling.</b> <b>The</b> fine frequency <b>resolution,</b> low spurious signals, accuracy and stability are most important for these devices. In this paper, the new frequency synthesizer architecture based on direct synthesis and coincidence mixer is presented. The simulation results are also shown. Key-Words:- Coincidence, diophantine, direct synthesis, frequency mixer, frequency spectrum, phase locked loop. ...|$|R
