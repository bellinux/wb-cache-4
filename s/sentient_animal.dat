In 1973 Nichols directed a revival of Anton Chekhov's Uncle Vanya on Broadway starring George C. Scott and with a new translation by himself and Albert Todd. In 1973 Nichols directed the film The Day of the Dolphin starring George C. Scott, based on the French novel Un animal doué de raison (lit. A <b>Sentient</b> <b>Animal)</b> by Robert Merle and adapted by Buck Henry. The film was not successful financially and received mixed reviews from critics. Nichols next directed The Fortune (1975), starring Warren Beatty, Jack Nicholson and Stockard Channing. Again, the film was a financial failure and received mostly negative reviews. It was Nichols' last feature narrative film for eight years.|$|E

40|$|Over {{the course}} of the 18 th century, {{scholarly}} examinations of animal nature and behavior rejected ‘mechanical’, overly deterministic hypotheses, suggesting instead that animal action proceeded from a psycho-physiological sentient capacity. Though the ultimate causes of this capacity appeared to elude explanation, they expressed themselves in behaviors that scholars described and analyzed. Interpretations of <b>sentient,</b> <b>animal</b> nature also bore on the contemporary understanding of human nature: like animals, human beings were also considered to possess a psycho-physiological nature that motivated them to act in order to satisfy their vital needs. Adopting this vision of human nature, early German political economists sought to construct a ‘human’ science, one that emphasized and explored the human interrelationship with the operations of the physical world, yet did not abandon the long-cherished belief in human distinctiveness within nature. Key words economics, nature, needs, science, sentience In 1851, the 19 th-century German economist Karl Heinrich Rau introduced a sketch of theoretical economics by highlighting the fact that all living crea-tures exist {{in a constant state of}} demand and dependency. ‘Living creatures’, he explained, ‘are unceasingly in contact with the physical world aroun...|$|E
40|$|This opinion paper {{considers}} the relative validity and utility of three concepts: the Five Freedoms (FF), Five Domains (FD) and Quality of Life (QoL) as tools {{for the analysis}} of animal welfare. The aims of FF and FD are different but complementary. FD seeks {{to assess the impact of}} the physical and social environment on the mental (affective) state of a <b>sentient</b> <b>animal,</b> FF is an outcome-based approach to identify and evaluate the efficacy of specific actions necessary to promote well-being. Both have utility. The concept of QoL is presented mainly as a motivational framework. The FD approach provides an effective foundation for research and evidence-based conclusions as to the impact of the things we do on the mental state of the animals in our care. Moreover, it is one that can evolve with time. The FF are much simpler. They do not attempt to achieve an overall picture of mental state and welfare status, but the principles upon which they are based are timeless. Their aim is to be no more than a memorable set of signposts to right action. Since, so far as the animals are concerned, it is not what we think but what we do that counts, I suggest that they are likely to have a more general impact...|$|E

40|$|In the {{presented}} thesis I {{defend the}} claim that all <b>sentient</b> <b>animals</b> should have legal rights.

Our duties should be reflected in the law, that is – animal interests should be protected by the legal means. I argue that some animals are moral subjects and because of their admirable ability to act for moral reasons and show moral concern towards their counterparts they intrinsically deserve the highest level of protection of their vital interests that is – they deserve legal rights. I also contend that all <b>sentient</b> <b>animals</b> who are moral patients should have legal rights for the same reason human infants and profoundly mentally impaired adults are granted some basic legal rights...|$|R
40|$|Originally, the Capabilities Approach had {{a strong}} anthropocentric {{orientation}} because of its focus on the entitlements of individual humans. However, {{as a part of}} the interest to employ it within animal and environmental ethics, it has been discussed whether the Capabilities Approach should consider also non-human life forms for their own sake. The most influential and elaborated contribution to this debate is Martha Nussbaum’s extension of the Capabilities Approach to include also <b>sentient</b> <b>animals.</b> In this article, we argue that Nussbaum’s ascription of capabilities to animals is problematic, since the concept of a capability normally denotes an opportunity to choose between different functionings. When Nussbaum ascribes capabilities to animals, the concept seems to denote simply specific abilities. Such a use is problematic since it waters down the concept and makes it less meaningful, and it may obscure the fact that normal, adult humans, in contrast to <b>sentient</b> <b>animals,</b> can act as conscious moral agents. The aim of granting moral status to <b>sentient</b> <b>animals</b> can be achieved more convincingly by describing our moral relationship to animals in terms of the functionings we should promote, instead of ascribing capabilities to them...|$|R
40|$|A proper bioethical {{approach}} to the welfare issue can not leave out of consideration the thorny question of animal pain. Several bioethical problems {{are involved in this}} question: first of all, why does animal pain today worry us? With respect to an even recent past in which the Cartesian-resembling idea of the automata animal, unable to experience any kind of feelings, has persisted, the increasing idea of a <b>sentient</b> <b>animal,</b> upon which pain weighs in its welfare evaluation process, is spreading. Thus, new issues are produced: to what extent – qualitatively and quantitatively – is an animal able to feel pain? What is the nature of its experiencing? What’s the connection between pain and suffering? As we obtain through these enquiries, pain, often considered a sort of biological enigma, complexly relates to the theme of animal consciousness. A sharp and intricate debate is presently investigating the animal consciousness issue, giving rise to contrasting assessments about the degree of pain and suffering awareness an animal can show. Yet, from a bioethical point of view, the pain issue must be primarily considered in connection to the notion of cruelty. Hence how we treat an animal becomes not only a question of private evaluation, but rather a question of social consensus ethics, which requires considering not only the economic, but also the ethical costs of pain and suffering...|$|E
40|$|Provides {{guidance}} on {{the requirement to}} provide a written narrative of the consideration of alternatives to painful and distressful procedures. Replaces Policy # 12 dated April 14, 1997. Justification: The Animal Welfare Act (AWA) regulations require principal investigators to consider alternatives to procedures that may cause more than momentary or slight pain or distress to the animals and provide a written narrative of the methods used and sources consulted to determine the availability of alternatives, including refinements, reductions, and replacements. Policy: Alternatives or alternative methods are generally regarded as those that incorporate some aspect of replacement, reduction, or refinement of animal use {{in pursuit of the}} minimization of animal pain and distress consistent with the goals of the research.

Potential alternatives that do not allow the attainment of the goals of the research are not, by definition, alternatives. A fundamental goal of the AWA and the accompanying regulations is the minimization of animal pain and distress via the consideration of alternatives and alternative methods. Toward this end, the regulations state that any proposed animal activity, or significant changes to an ongoing animal activity, must include: 1. a rationale for involving animals, the appropriateness of the species, and the number of animals to be used...|$|E

40|$|Alasdair Cochrane {{introduces}} {{an entirely}} new theory of animal rights grounded in their interests as sentient beings. He then applies this theory to different and underexplored policy areas, such as genetic engineering, pet-keeping, indigenous hunting, and religious slaughter. In contrast to other proponents of animal rights, Cochrane claims that because most <b>sentient</b> <b>animals</b> are not autonomous agents, they have no intrinsic interest in liberty. As such, he argues that our obligations to animals lie in ending practices that cause their suffering and death and do not require the liberation of animals. Cochrane’s “interest-based rights approach” weighs the interests of animals to determine which is sufficient to impose strict duties on humans. In so doing, Cochrane acknowledges that <b>sentient</b> <b>animals</b> have a clear and discernable right not {{to be made to}} suffer and not to be killed, but he argues {{that they do not have}} a prima facie right to liberty. Because most animals possess no interest in leading freely chosen lives, humans have no moral obligation to liberate them.
