60|$|Again, to winged animals, such as {{birds and}} bats and flying insects, the ocean forms far {{less of a}} barrier {{than it does to}} quadrupeds, to reptiles, and to fresh-water fishes. Hence Australia has, to some extent, been invaded by later types of birds and other flying creatures, who live on there {{side by side with the}} ancient animals of the <b>secondary</b> <b>pattern.</b> Warblers, thrushes, flycatchers, shrikes, and crows must all be {{comparatively}} recent immigrants from the Asiatic mainland. Even in this respect, however, the Australian life-region still bears an antiquated and undeveloped aspect. Nowhere else in the world do we find those very oldest types of birds represented by the cassowaries, the emus, and the mooruk of New Britain. The extreme term in this exceedingly ancient set of creature is given us by the wingless bird, the apteryx or kiwi of New Zealand, whose feathers nearly resemble hair, and whose grotesque appearance makes it as much a wonder in its own class as the puzzle-monkey and the casuarina are among forest trees. No feathered creatures so closely approach the lizard-tailed birds of the oolite or the toothed birds of the cretaceous period as do these Australian and New Zealand emus and apteryxes. Again, while many characteristic Oriental families are quite absent, like the vultures, woodpeckers, pheasants and bulbuls, the Australian region has many other fairly ancient birds, found nowhere else on the surface of our modern planet. Such are the so-called brush turkeys and mound builders, the only feathered things that never sit upon their own eggs, but allow them to be hatched, after the fashion of reptiles, by the heat of the sand or of fermenting vegetable matter. The piping crows, the honey-suckers, the lyre-birds, and the more-porks are all peculiar to the Australian region. So are the wonderful and æsthetic bower-birds. Brush-tongued lories, black cockatoos, and gorgeously coloured pigeons, though somewhat less antique, perhaps, in type, give a special character to the bird-life of the country. And in New Guinea, an isolated bit of the same old continent, the birds of paradise, found nowhere else in the whole world, seem to recall some forgotten Eden of the remote past, some golden age of Saturnian splendour. Poetry apart, into which I have dropped for a moment like Mr. Silas Wegg, the birds of paradise are, in fact, gorgeously dressed crows, specially adapted to forest life in a rich fruit-bearing tropical country, where food is abundant and enemies unknown.|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: The Gleason sum is an {{important}} prognostic parameter for patients treated with radical prostatectomy for localized prostate cancer. However, frequently more than two predominant Gleason patterns are present in one specimen. In this study we investigated the prognostic significance of tertiary Gleason patterns in radical prostatectomy specimens. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1994 and 2001, 277 patients underwent radical retropubic prostatectomy (RRP) for clinically localised prostate cancer in our institute. We collected information on Gleason score and cancer volume (CV) for all tumour localizations, clinical and pathological stage, seminal vesicle invasion (SVI) and extra capsular extension (ECE). In case one pattern was seen in more than 95 % of the tumour, this pattern was used both for the primary and secondary Gleason pattern, and any other pattern (actually the <b>secondary</b> <b>pattern)</b> was called tertiary. Charts were examined retrospectively for clinical follow up. PSA progression was defined as two subsequent rising PSA measurements above 0. 10 ng/ml. Kaplan-Meier time to PSA progression was compared between patients with and without a tertiary pattern. RESULTS: Overall, of the 223 patients, 106 (48 %) {{were found to have}} a tertiary pattern, which on average, was 7 % of the total tumour volume. Patients with a tertiary pattern had a 5 -year risk of PSA progression of 37. 3 % versus 12. 6 % in case no tertiary Gleason pattern was present (log rank p= 0. 0002). There was no prognostic difference between patients with a higher-grade tertiary pattern as compared to those with a lower grade tertiary pattern. CONCLUSIONS: If present, a tertiary Gleason pattern, whether better or worse than the primary or <b>secondary</b> <b>pattern,</b> is an indication for a worse outcome, as indicated by a shorter time to PSA progression. This suggests that tumour multifocality, rather than the presence of a higher-grade tertiary Gleason pattern has prognostic value...|$|E

Traditionally the pattern analysis of NFCR is based on a plane wave approach, which simplifies the computation tremendously, but fails to provide design information about the most critical component of the whole antenna system, the feed array. Currently available computers make it possible to calculate the pattern of an NFCR by a more exact element-by-element approach. Each element in the feed array is considered individually, and the diffraction pattern from the subreflector is calculated by the geometrical theory of diffraction (including uniform theories at the shadow boundaries).

We evaluated clinically the favorable and unfavorable outcome of endocrine therapy in Japan, so that others will be appropriately evaluated. In a cooperative study made by members of five universities, 572 patients with clinically or histologically reconfirmed prostatic carcinoma were entered in this retrospective study. We studied the true influence of prognostic factors on the prognosis of 497 patients with prostatic carcinoma who had received endocrine therapy, employing multivariate analyses, such as quantification method II, multiple regression analysis and Cox's proportional hazard model. Twelve factors were considered in the study; "age", "stage", "histological findings (structural atypism = SAT, nuclear anaplasia = NAN, Gleason's primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>pattern)</b> ", "pretreatment level of total acid (ACP) and of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) ", "castration performed or not performed", "doses of estrogen", "type of response of local prostatic tumor and of ACP to endocrine therapy". Analysis of the "importance" of a prognostic factor by a partial correlation determined by quantification method II, revealed "stage" to have the greatest "importance" on prognosis throughout the entire period. "Response of local prostatic tumor", "response of ACP" and "Gleason's primary pattern" tended to be important factors for prognosis, in particular, {{in the first half}} period, and "age" and "Gleason's secondary pattern" were important in the latter half. Multiple regression analysis revealed the "stage", once again to be the most influential factor on the prognosis for the entire observation period.

Analysis with Cox's proportional hazard model revealed that "response of ACP", "stage", "age", "Gleason's primary and secondary pattern", and "response of local prostatic tumor" were definitely the more influential prognostic factors, of which chi-square values (or t values) were statistically significant. Comparison of the significant factors in each multivariate analysis revealed that common influential prognostic factors, such as "age", "stage", "histological findings (mainly Gleason's primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>pattern)</b> ", "response of local prostatic tumor" and "response of ACP" were coincident to the clinical impression.
