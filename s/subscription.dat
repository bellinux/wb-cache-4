40|$|Current {{matching}} {{approaches in}} pub/sub systems only allow conjunctive <b>subscriptions.</b> Arbitrary <b>subscriptions</b> {{have to be}} transformed into canonical expressions, e. g., DNFs, {{and need to be}} treated as several conjunctive sub-scriptions. This technique is known from database sys-tems and allows us to apply more efficient filtering algo-rithms. Since pub/sub systems are the contrary to tradi-tional database systems, it is questionable if filtering several canonical <b>subscriptions</b> is the most efficient and scalable way of dealing with arbitrary <b>subscriptions.</b> In this paper we show that our filtering approach supporting arbitrary Boolean <b>subscriptions</b> is more scalable and efficient than current matching algorithms requiring transformations of <b>subscriptions</b> into DNFs. 1...|$|R
