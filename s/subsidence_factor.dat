Figure  10 shows that the position of maximum horizontal displacement is not changed, but the values outside the boundaries of goaf are increased.

30|$|Although gob {{backfill}} is {{also called}} complete backfill, none of backfill techniques can obtain a filling ratio of 100  %. This is attributed {{not only to}} backfilling process and mechanical properties of backfill material (Karfakis et al. 1996), {{but also to the}} mining-induced motion law of roof strata. The filling ratio of < 100  % has been confirmed by practices of mining with backfill in different countries (Gandhe et al. 2005). Therefore, surface subsidence cannot be entirely avoided under backfilling. Typically, in the evaluation of surface subsidence under backfill, the term of effective extraction height is proposed (Singh and Singh 1985; Miao et al. 2010), which represents the actual thickness of voids transferred finally to the ground surface and is just part of the actual mining height. The ratio of effective extraction height to actual mining height is called <b>subsidence</b> <b>factor</b> under backfill.|$|E
40|$|Field {{observations}} and experience show {{substantial increase in}} the <b>subsidence</b> <b>factor</b> and other subsidence parameters due to multiple-seam longwall mining under a currently mined area. These observations depict a different subsidence mechanism for multiple-seam mining. The mechanism is largely unknown and currently used prediction methods are rather inaccurate or unable to predict the multiple-seam subsidence reliably. To be able to modify the prediction methods to suit the multiple-seam coal mining, the subsidence mechanism needs to be fully studied and understood. Physical modelling {{is one of a}} number of useful methods for this purpose. A physical model has been developed to investigate the mechanism of the surface and sub-strata movements due to multiple-seam coal mining. This paper outlines findings from the physical modelling and the subsequent analysis. The results of this study can be used to improve the current prediction methods for multiple-seam subsidence to a reasonable accuracy...|$|E

About 80 % of the maximum subsidence occurs behind the face after the longwall face has advanced about 100  m, with the remaining residual subsidence occurring within 3 – 4  months after mining.|$|E
30|$|Panel and pillar mining, also denoted as {{longwall}} {{partial extraction}} (despite longwall, the panel width is generally a few tens of meters), {{was first introduced}} by British mining engineers in 1950 s (Salamon 1991). It has been widely and successfully adopted in the UK (Wardell and Webster 1957; Salamon 1991), Australia (Kapp 1984) and China (Xu 2011), etc. Under panel and pillar mining, the final surface <b>subsidence</b> <b>factor</b> (the ratio of maximum surface subsidence to the mining height) is generally less than 0.1, with surface subsidence being well controlled and surface buildings being protected. Therefore, backfilling is also not requried. However, some successful field trials (unreported) in terms of backfilling under panel and pillar mining, have been conducted in China in recent years; such trials aimed at increasing the recovery rate during panel and pillar mining on condition that surface structures can be protected, e.g., in the Bucun coal mine and the Daizhuang coal mine in Shandong Province.|$|E
30|$|In {{order to}} predict the ground {{movement}} using the GIS functions, the following data, such as calculation points, extraction panels and subsidence parameters should be prepared at first. Meanwhile, the input parameters for ground movement calculations could be separated into two categories. The first one is the generation of surface grid points for providing calculation points, including the distance of each grid point in the x and y directions, in which the number of points along the grid lines, the number of grid lines, point intervals along the grid lines, and the grid-line directions need to be established. The second one is entering the calculation data of ground movement, including the extraction panel sequence ID, seam upward angle, inclination of dip, <b>subsidence</b> <b>factor,</b> excavation thickness, horizontal-movement factor, angle of draw and time factor. Since the ground movement is calculated only with the above entering data, the calculation results of each panel would be uncertain once the input data are uncertain.|$|E
30|$|In recent years, {{field trials}} of non-pillar {{longwall}} mining using complete backfill {{have been implemented}} successively in the Chinese coal mining industry. The objective {{of this paper is}} to get a scientific understanding of surface subsidence control effect using such techniques. It begins with a brief overview on complete backfill methods primarily used in China, followed by an analysis of collected <b>subsidence</b> <b>factors</b> under mining with complete backfill. It is concluded that non-pillar longwall panel layout cannot protect surface structures against damages at a relatively large mining height, even though complete backfill is conducted. In such cases, separated longwall panel layout should be applied, i.e., panel width should be subcritical and stable coal pillars should be left between the adjacent panels. The proposed method takes the principles of subcritical extraction and partial extraction; in conjunction with gob backfilling, surface subsidence can be effectively mitigated, thus protecting surface buildings against mining-induced damage. A general design principle and method of separated panel layout have also been proposed.|$|R
40|$|The earth's surface, due to {{its natural}} {{conditions}} and its structure is always changing and reshaping. One of the created deformations is the land subsidence. This {{is the most dangerous}} events which can be seen in most urban areas especially in the agricultural plains today. This study aims at zoning land subsidence and recognition of geometrical factors in southwest of Tehran. To estimate and predict land subsidence, all the effective <b>subsidence</b> <b>factors</b> were identified. Among the factors, nine most important factors including, downfall of groundwater, thickness of clay, depth of groundwater, annual discharge of water from wells, the distance of well to each other, slop, elevation, land use and geology were evaluated. Ultimately, three variables were selected as the most important variables. For modeling and zoning these factors, artificial neural network using Matlab software and Arc-GIS software for creating primary layers were used. The results indicate that the main cause of subsidence is excessive removal of underground water resources. Since the use of water resources in agriculture is accounted for the highest percentage of consumption and also because {{a large part of the}} study area have an agriculture land use, therefore the underground water drop and agricultural land uses are the most susceptible areas of land subsidence occurrence...|$|R
40|$|The land <b>subsidence</b> {{spreading}} <b>factor</b> {{provides a}} useful straightforward indication on {{how much of a}} gas/oil reservoir compaction induced by field development migrates to ground surface with a possible adverse impact on the stability of low-lying coastal areas. This factor depends primarily on the ratio between the depth of burial and a representative horizontal dimension of the reservoir. However, an important influence is also exerted by the active bottom/lateral aquifer hydraulically connected to the field (called “waterdrive” in reservoir engineering) that may undergo an extensive depressurization also after the field abandonment, thus contributing to enhance the overall land settlement. In the Northern Adriatic basin, Italy, is evaluated using a nonlinear finite element model of three representative gas reservoirs (Chioggia Mare, Dorotea, and Dosso degli Angeli) surrounded by important bottom/lateral aquifers in the interval depth between 1000 and 3300 m. Results show that may easily approach and even exceed one for the deepest field as well, contrary to the prediction of land subsidence based on the compaction of the gas-bearing formations alone, that can thus be largely underestimated...|$|R
30|$|From the worldwide backfill practices, it can be {{concluded}} that <b>subsidence</b> <b>factor</b> using complete backfill is usually 0.1 – 0.3 depending on the backfill materials (e.g., river sand and paste). In the practice of Chinese longwall, non-pillar longwall panel layout is typically used, which means no pillar or a narrow pillar (around 5 – 10  m) is left between the adjacent longwall panels. Using complete backfill under such a panel layout, surface structures can be protected against damage at a relatively small mining height, whereas surface subsidence will be uncontrolled at a relatively large mining height in a critical mining condition. In such cases, the separated backfill mining method should be used. The determination of this critical mining height is a site-specific problem and it depends on geological and mining conditions. Probably, it can be speculatively inferred that a final surface subsidence of 0.6  m could be regarded as a threshold for determining the critical mining height, e.g., separated backfill mining should be used at the mining height of  3.0  m with surface factor of > 0.2, the mining height 4.0  m with the surface factor of > 0.15.|$|E

There were six factors selected: geological, hydrogeological, number of wells, groundwater used, land use and amount of population. The factors were analyzed by weighting and rating scores from twelve governmental officers from concerned agencies. The total score of each factor was employed to assess risk area of land subsidence by GIS and PCA method. The output in this study is a map of risk area of land subsidence in Nakhon Pathom Province, representative central plain area. In this study, the risk area of land subsidence was classified into 3 levels. Most of the land consisted of areas at a moderate risk of subsidence and these areas were scattered throughout the study area, covering 1, 905. 93 km 2, while a high level to at risk areas was found in parts of the west and south of the study area, covering 251. 02 km 2.

Eight <b>factor</b> layers (drift depth, drift density, distance from nearest drift, distance from nearest railroad, rock mass rating, groundwater depth, slope, and surface runoff accumulation) were extracted from the spatial database to examine the relationships between the <b>factors</b> and past <b>subsidence</b> occurrences (training data set).

When the area under the curve technique was used to verify the subsidence hazard map, by comparing the determined hazard rankings with past subsidence occurrences (validation data set), the FR model and FR-AHP integrated model showed 97 percent and 94 percent accuracies, respectively, in predicting subsidence occurrences. Finally, the subsidence hazard map based on the FR model was overlain with exposure intensity and vulnerability maps to generate a priority setting map, representing the relative risk of mine subsidence to buildings.

These data are processed using the Persistent Scatterers Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (PSInSAR) technique and post-processed by statistical selection and filtering with the aimto obtain, by combining ascending and descending geometries, the spatial distribution of the vertical and horizontal (east–west) components of the ground displacement velocity. We identify fivemain areas of subsidence affecting residential districts and strategic infrastructures (transportations and industrial plants). These are: a) Vomero–Arenella district; b) Scudillo–Stella district, c) Municipio Square; d) Garibaldi Square; and e) Poggioreale district. In these areas, the ground deformation rate is between − 1. 3 and − 10. 5 mm/yr and varies through time. In particular, in the investigated time period, the subsidence rate (i) persistently increases in the Scudillo–Stella and Poggioreale districts, (ii) abruptly increases in correspondence of underground construction activities (Municipio and Garibaldi squares), and (iii) decreases following the ground deformation style of the Campi Flegrei caldera (Vomero–Arenella district). More restricted areas of subsidence also occur in the northeastern, less urbanized, sectors of the Napoli metropolitan area. The <b>subsidence</b> triggering <b>factors</b> are investigated through a reviewof the available geological geomorphological, hydrological, and urban network information. With respect to other urban contexts, where the cause of subsidence is of natural or anthropogenic origin, Napoli shows a multiple association of triggering factors. These factors are: sub-soil excavations {{for the construction of}} transport infrastructures, filling/emptying cycles of large underground water reservoirs, gravity instability related to local morphological factors, raise of the water table with consequent hydrocompaction due to the stop of ground water withdrawal, and re-activation of volcano-tectonic faults associated to the uplift and subsidence phases (bradyseism) of the neighboring, active Campi Flegrei caldera, whose western sector includes a part of the Napoli urban area. We conclude that in a complex urban and geological setting like that of Napoli, ground deformations induced by anthropic and natural processes may coexist and should be monitored for a correct evaluation of the associated hazard and the management of the city planning activities. Finally, the combined review of satellite and geological data available for different urban districts worldwide is essential to identify the sources of ground deformation and analyze the time evolution of the related anthropic and/or natural processes...|$|R

This paper investigates whether or not the well-documented demise of Sinemurian carbonate platforms in the Tethyan region was a response to a global event by examination of carbon-isotope anomalies in successions of different facies that record this interval of time. A chemostratigraphic transect from Lake Garda up to the eastern Italian border is illustrated by four stratigraphic sections; high-resolution (20 cm over key intervals) chemostratigraphic sampling allowed detection of a major negative δ 13 C anomaly of ~ 1. 5 ‰, preceded by a positive excursion, both in shallow- and deep-water successions, over the stratigraphical range of the ammonite genus Arnioceras. A comparison with sections from the UK suggests that the positive excursion belongs to the turneri Zone and the succeeding negative excursion falls within the obtusum Zone. In the deep-water Belluno Basin, the negative anomaly occurs in a biogenic chert-rich unit recording the onset of mesotrophic conditions in the basin. In the platform-carbonate successions, this major negative carbon-isotope excursion is developed within a calcarenitic unit corresponding to the lowest occurrence of the foraminifer Paleomayncina termieri. This evidence for deepening and transgression across the carbonate platform suggests pre-conditioning for drowning. Hence, rather than tectonic <b>subsidence</b> alone, environmental <b>factors</b> may have aided the demise of Tethyan carbonate platforms during the Early Jurassic Sinemurian Age...|$|R

Prior to this study, however, rates and patterns of region-wide ground deformation in Wuhan were little known. Here we employ multi-temporal SAR interferometry to detect and characterize spatiotemporal variations of ground deformation in major metropolitan areas in Wuhan. A total of twelve TerraSAR-X images acquired during 2009 – 2010 are used in the InSAR time series analysis. InSAR-derived results are validated by levelling survey measurements and reveal a distinct subsidence pattern within six zones in major commercial and industrial areas, with a maximum subsidence rate up to − 67. 3 mm/year. A comparison analysis between subsiding patterns and urban developments as well as geological conditions suggests that land subsidence in Wuhan is mainly attributed to anthropogenic activities, natural compaction of soft soil, and karst dissolution of subsurface carbonate rocks. However, anthropogenic activities related to intensive municipal construction and industrial production have more significant impacts on the measured <b>subsidence</b> than natural <b>factors.</b> Moreover, remarkable signals of secular land uplift are found along both banks of the Yangtze River, especially along the southern bank, with deformation rates ranging mostly from + 5 mm/year to + 17. 5 mm/year.

40|$|The {{extension}} of the lithosphere, controlling the development of rifted basins, is driven {{by a combination of}} plate-boundary forces, frictional forces exerted on the base of the lithosphere by the convecting asthenosphere and deviatoric tensional stresses developing over upwelling branches of the asthenospheric convection system. Although mantle plumes are not a primary driving force of rifting, they play an important secondary role by weakening the lithosphere and by controlling the level of rift-related volcanic activity. A distinction between "active" and "passive" rifting is only conditionally justified. The {{extension of}} the lithosphere, depending on its rate and magnitude, and the potential temperature of the asthenosphere, can cause by adiabatic decompression partial melting of the lower lithosphere and upper asthenosphere. In rift systems, the level and timing of volcanic activity is highly variable. The lack of volcanic activity implies "passive" rifting. An initial "passive" rifting stage can be followed by a more "active" one during which magmatism plays an increasingly important role. Magmatic destabilization of the Moho may account for the frequently observed discrepancy between upper and lower crustal extension factors. Combined with evidence for thermal thinning of the mantle-lithosphere, this suggest that the volume of the lithosphere is not necessarily preserved during rifting as advocated by conventional stretching models. The structural style of rifts is controlled by the rheological structure of the lithosphere, the availability of crustal discontinuities that can be tensionally reactivated, the mode (orthogonal or oblique) and amount of extension, and the lithological composition of pre- and syn-rift sediments. Simple-shear extension prevails in rifts that subparallel the structural grain of the basement. Pure-shear extension is typical for rifts cross-cutting the basement grain. Pre-existing crustal and mantle-lithospheric discontinuities contribute to the localization of rift systems. The duration of the rifting stage of extensional basins is highly variable. Stress field changes can cause abrupt termination of rifting. In major rift systems, progressive strain concentration on the zone of future crustal separation entails abandonment of lateral rifts. Depending on constraints on lateral block movements, crustal separation can be achieved after as little as 9 My and as much as 280 My of rifting activity. Syn-rift basin subsidence is controlled by isostatic adjustment of the crust to mechanical stretching of the lithosphere, its magmatic inflation and thermal attenuation of the mantle-lithosphere. Post-rift basin subsidence is governed by thermal reequilibration of the lithosphere-asthenosphere system. Deep-seated thermal anomalies related to syn-rift pull-up of the asthenosphere-lithosphere boundary have decayed after 60 My by about 65 % and after 180 My by about 95 %. The magnitude of post-rift subsidence {{is a function of the}} rift-induced thermal anomaly and crustal density changes, the potential temperature of the asthenosphere and initial water depths. Intraplate stresses can have an overprinting effect on post-rift <b>subsidence.</b> Stretching <b>factors</b> derived from post-rift subsidence analyses must be corrected for such effects. © 2003 Elsevier B.

A composite section of two permeable units within the Mt. Carmel Sandstone was pumped during the first three tests. The lower permeable portion of the Mt. Carmel Sandstone was pumped discretely during the remaining two tests. Analysis of static and dynamic heads indicated that the two sandstone units comprised distinct hydrogeologic units. These units were informally designated the upper and lower Mt. Carmel Sandstones during this study. Drawdown data were evaluated for double porosity behavior and the effect of linear discontinuities using published analytical solutions. This analysis indicated linear discontinuities were responsible for the characteristic drawdown response. Numerical modeling was performed to test this conclusion. A transient, two-dimensional numerical model of the lower Mt. Carmel Sandstone was developed and calibrated against pumping test data. The model simulated the aquifer as three homogeneous zones separated by two linear discontinuities. The first zone represented the area overlying the interior of the mined panel and was characterized by moderately (i. e. ? 1 to 2 orders of magnitude) increased permeability and storativitv relative to the pre-subsidence condition. The second zone represented the portion of the aquifer over the margin of the panel and was characterized by significantly (i. e., 3 to 4 orders of magnitude) increased permeability and storativity relative to the pre-subsidence condition. The third zone represented aquifer away from the subsidence area. The results of the model support the linear discontinuity conceptual model of the effects of subsidence on the Mt. Carmel Sandstone. Development of linear discontinuities may occur in other hydrogeologic settings as a result of anthropogenic <b>factors</b> (e. g., <b>subsidence)</b> or natural <b>factors</b> (e. g., faults and lithologic changes).

40|$|Integrated facies and {{subsidence}} analysis {{enable the}} identification and quantification of controlling factors on carbonate platform evolution. Palaeo biologic evolution as intrinsic <b>factors,</b> <b>subsidence</b> and accommodation change as extrinsic factors {{are the most important}} controlling factors on carbonate platform growth on a platform (and basin) -wide scale. Other factors like auto-cyclic processes, windward-leeward effects, nutrient supply, wave expositions and tidal currents are also important but play a minor, localised role. Whereas subsidence and accommodation change can easily be deduced from the sedimentary record and be quantitatively assessed, the other factors are much more difficult to identify lest quantify due to overprinting and poor preservation potential. Facies analysis and the comparison of the slope- and reef-facies from Latemar (Upper Anisian/Lower Ladinian, Dolomites) and Concarena (Upper Ladinian/Lower Carnian, Lombardic Alps) stresses the importance and links between subsidence, sedimentation, facies assemblages and cementation throughout the development of Triassic carbonate platforms. High rates of carbonate accumulation/accommodation increase combined with low topography of the reefal margin prevent massive early cementation at Latemar; low rates during the last stages of the Concarena platform together with a walled reef promote massive early cementation. Combined thermal, numerical basin reverse and sequence stratigraphic forward modelling constrained burial and subsidence histories of the Rosengarten and Latemar platforms. Vitrinite reflectance and apatite fission track data both argue for a shallow maximum burial. Present day topography was overlain by a maximum thickness of 1100 m of overburden. There are no indications for a Neogene flysch or molasse-type setting as inferred from other Alpine basins. The subsidence pulse at the verge of the Anisian (Reitzi-zone) is recorded at Latemar and Rosengarten with similar total subsidence rates of 800 - 850 m/Ma. Both platforms successfully kept up with this rapid increase in accommodation space. Additionally, sequence stratigraphic forward modelling of the Rosengarten platform showed that minimum vertical accumulation rates of up to 1000 m/Ma are necessary in order to reproduce observed present day geometries. The carbonate production rates of both platforms reached values of (sub) recent carbonate platforms. Despite the resemblance of the Latemar reef to other early Anisian reefs of the Dolomites (encrusting microproblematica dominating over framebuilding organisms) and the low diversity of faunal elements with respect to slightly younger reefs (e. g. Concarena, Ladinian/Carnian), this adds further evidence to the observation of a full recovery of the carbonate factory already at the Late Anisian (lower Middle Triassic) ...|$|R
40|$|Lake Chungara´ (18 15 ¢S, 69 09 ¢W, 4520 m above sea-level) is {{the largest}} (22 Æ 5 km 2) and deepest (40 m) {{lacustrine}} ecosystem in the Chilean Altiplano and its location in an active volcanic setting, provides an opportunity to evaluate environmental (volcanic vs. climatic) controls on lacustrine sedimentation. The Late Quaternary depositional history of the lake is reconstructed {{by means of a}} multiproxy study of 15 Kullenberg cores and seismic data. The chronological framework is supported by 10 14 C AMS dates and one 230 Th/ 234 U dates. Lake Chungara´ was formed prior to 12 Æ 8 cal kyr bp {{as a result of the}} partial collapse of the Parinacota volcano that impounded the Lauca river. The sedimentary architecture of the lacustrine succession has been controlled by (i) the strong inherited palaeo-relief and (ii) changes in the accommodation space, caused by lake-level fluctuations and tectonic <b>subsidence.</b> The first <b>factor</b> determined the location of the depocentre in the NW of the central plain. The second factor caused the area of deposition to extend towards the eastern and southern basin margins with accumulation of high-stand sediments on the elevated marginal platforms. Synsedimentary normal faulting also increased accommodation and increased the rate of sedimentation in the northern part of the basin. Six sedimentary units were identified and correlated in the basin mainly using tephra keybeds. Unit 1 (Late Pleistocene-Early Holocene) is made up of laminated diatomite with some carbonate-rich (calcite and aragonite) laminae. Unit 2 (Mid-Holocene-Recent) is composed of massive to bedded diatomite with abundant tephra (lapilli and ash) layers. Some carbonate-rich layers (calcite and aragonite) occur. Unit 3 consists of macrophyte-rich diatomite deposited in nearshore environments. Unit 4 is composed of littoral sediments dominated by alternating charophyterich and other aquatic macrophyte-rich facies. Littoral carbonate productivity peaked when suitable shallow platforms were available for charophyte colonization. Clastic deposits in the lake are restricted to lake margins (Units 5 and 6). Diatom productivity peaked during a lowstand period (Unit 1 and subunit 2 a), and was probably favoured by photic conditions affecting larger areas of the lake bottom. Offshore carbonate precipitation reached its maximum during the Early to Mid-Holocene (ca 7 Æ 8 and 6 Æ 4 cal kyr bp). This may have been favoured by increases in lake solute concentrations resulting from evaporation and calcium input because of the compositional changes in pyroclastic supply. Diatom and pollen data from offshore cores suggest a number of lake-level fluctuations: a Late Pleistocene deepening episode (ca 12 Æ 6 cal kyr BP), four shallowing episodes during the Early to Mid-Holocene (ca 10 Æ 5, 9 Æ 8, 7 Æ 8 and 6 Æ 7 cal kyr BP) and higher lake levels since the Mid-Holocene (ca 5 Æ 7 cal kyr BP) until the present. Explosive activity at Parinacota volcano was very limited between c. > 12 Æ 8 and 7 Æ 8 cal kyr bp. Mafic-rich explosive eruptions from the Ajata satellite cones increased after ca 5 Æ 7 cal kyr bp until the present...|$|R
