Efforts to help newly unemployed individuals in the shellfish industry continued in the months following the storm; local Tallahassee musicians organized a benefit concert in January 1986 to raise money for families of oystermen in Franklin County.|$|E

In 1913 these labour exchanges were putting around 3000 people into a job each day. Another measure taken was the 1909 Development Fund, which was an attempt to provide work in times of Depression. This fund was devoted to increasing employment opportunities through measures such as afforestation and the provision of smallholdings in the countryside.

500|$|Under {{pressure}} from the Hungarian political opposition, the Hungarian government charged 14 Hungarian officers with high treason {{in relation to the}} massacres, including Feketehalmy-Czeydner, Grassy, Deák and Zöldi. A military trial was held in Budapest between 23 December 1943 and January 1944, and those that were convicted were sentenced to between 10 and 15 years imprisonment for their part in the massacres. Feketehalmy-Czeydner, Grassy, Deák and Zöldi were not sentenced as they could not be located, and had fled to Germany. It is apparent from the trial proceedings that Zöldi was present during some of the trial. Professor Lajčo Klajn has stated that those most responsible for the massacre were not tried before this military court, and that they included Prime Minister Bárdossy and the Minister for Interior Affairs Dr. Ferenc Keresztes-Fischer, both of whom appeared only as witnesses. Klajn also states that the Chief of the General Staff, Ferenc Szombathelyi and the Minister of Defence should also have been examined by the court, that the [...] "genocide had been planned by the highest military and political circles in Hungary {{for a long time in}} advance", and had been intended to convince the German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop that Hungarian troops were needed on its territory instead of the Eastern Front.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} is to examine whether special taxation rules for close companies and their owners are necessary, or that taxation {{in accordance with the}} general principles of income taxation will suffice. The principles of statutory interpretation of the Supreme Administrative Court and development trends in this area are described. These trends are then examined in relation {{to the development of the}} particular practice in respect of the rules governing close companies. A general question discussed is whether the community of economic interests between a close company and its owners justifies a system of special treatment. The dissertation also contains a discussion of different situations in which it is disputable whether it is the company or its owners that should be the tax subject. A comparison with Danish law is made here. The current <b>special</b> <b>regulation</b> of close companies is described and analysed in respect of its character and against the historical and systematic background of the regulation. Further more an account is given on the law regarding the taxation of concealed benefit-in-kind, as developed by the courts -applying general principles of taxation- in both Denmark and Sweden. I have also dealt with the problem concerning the apportionment between capital and earned incomes in respect of a shareholder's withdrawal of profit from a close company. This area is subject to, in my opinion, justified <b>special</b> <b>regulation</b> in Swedish law. <b>Special</b> <b>regulation</b> is in my opinion otherwise justified only when it is aimed at transactions, which would fall outside the scope of application of the general principles of income taxation. <b>Special</b> <b>regulation</b> should neither become hindrance to a company's legitimate business activities...|$|R
