In particular silver supported on alumina and ZSM- 5 were in focus and parameters that can improve the NOx reduction performance, i. e. the C/N molar ratio {{and the addition of}} hydrogen, were specifically studied. Five catalysts were prepared (H ZSM 5, Ag/H ZSM 5, Pd/Ag/H ZSM- 5, γ-Al 2 O 3 and Ag-Al 2 O 3) and compared in flow reactor experiments. The Ag-Al 2 O 3 (2 wt% Ag, sol-gel) sample was found to give higher NOx reduction compared to the other tested samples, where important factors are suggested to be the support material, the preparation method and the Ag loading. The NOx reduction over Ag Al 2 O 3 with methanol is proposed to proceed by adsorbed nitrates or nitrites (or gas phase NO 2) reacting with adsorbed acetate or formaldehyde like species forming adsorbed R NO 2 or R ONO, with subsequent conversion into NCO, -CN, R-NH 2 or NH 3, with final desorption of N 2 and COx (or HCHO). The addition of hydrogen and an increase of the supplied methanol concentration resulted in an increased NOx reduction mainly over the Ag-Al 2 O 3 sample, where the addition of hydrogen also extended the active temperature interval towards lower temperatures.

40|$|International audienceLean NOx trap (LNT) and <b>Selective</b> <b>Catalytic</b> <b>Reduction</b> {{catalysts}} (<b>SCR)</b> are {{two leading}} candidates for Diesel NOx after-treatment. Each technology exhibits good properties to reduce efficiently Diesel NOx emissions {{in order to}} match the forthcoming EURO 6 standards. NOx reduction in LNT is made through a two-step process. In normal (lean) mode, Diesel engine exhausts NOx is stored into the NOx trap; then when necessary the engine runs rich during limited time to treat the stored NOx. This operating mode has the benefit of using onboard fuel as NOx reducer. But NOx trap solution is restrained by limited active temperature windows. On the other hand, NH 3 -SCR catalysts operate in {{a wider range of}} temperature and do not contain precious metals. However, NH 3 -SCR systems traditionally use urea-water solution as reducing agent, requiring thus additional infrastructure to supply the vehicles with enough reducer. These pros and cons are quite restrictive in classical LNT or NH 3 -SCR architecture. The present paper presents an after-treatment architecture combining a NOx trap and a passive NH 3 -SCR. Synergy of the two systems is possible if the SCR takes advantage of the LNT ability to produce Ammonia (NH 3). Indeed, during the rich phases (purges), small amounts of Ammonia are formed as by-product, which can be used in the downstream catalyst as the NOx reducing agent. A major difficulty to operate the proposed architecture is the real-time management of the NOx purge: for future control and diagnosis applications, it is crucial to have accurate but low-complexity models. A complete reduced model of the physicochemical phenomena involved is proposed in the present paper. Based on simplified chemical assumptions and time scale separation, the latter is suitable for on-board diagnostics and model-based control.

The aim was to delineate the effect of various parameters including pretreatment of the catalyst sample with H 2, NH 3 -to-NO ratio, inlet oxygen concentration, and space velocity.

The investigation showed {{that all of the}} above parameters (except pre-treatment with H 2) significantly affected the peak NO reduction, the temperature at which peak NO reduction occurred, and residual ammonia left at higher temperatures (also known as 'NH 3 slip').

However, an accompanied generation of N 2 O and NO 2 species was observed as well, being much higher for the vanadium-based catalyst than for the Cu-ZSM- 5 catalyst. For both catalysts, the peak NO reduction decreased with an increase in space velocity, and did not change significantly with an increase in oxygen concentration. The temperatures at which peak NO reduction and complete NH 3 removal occurred increased with an increase in space velocity but decreased with an increase in oxygen concentration. The presence of more ammonia at the inlet (i. e. higher NH 3 -to-NO ratio) improved the peak NO reduction but simultaneously resulted in an increase in residual ammonia.

40|$|The {{emission}} of nitrogen oxides (NOx) from automobiles results in severe environmental and biological effects. Passive <b>selective</b> <b>catalytic</b> <b>reduction</b> (passive <b>SCR)</b> of NOx with ammonia (NH 3) is a proposed method for abatement of NOx emissions in net lean-burn gasoline passenger vehicles. The principle {{idea of this}} technique is to selectively reduce NOx to nitrogen and water {{in the presence of}} excess oxygen by utilising a supply of NH 3  that has been formed onboard the vehicle over an ammonia formation catalyst (AFC). The aim of this thesis work is to deepen the understanding of how ammonia can be formed from nitric oxide over noble metal based catalysts. A bottom-up methodology has been employed where model catalysts with increasing complexity have been synthesised and characterised with several methods (BET, ICP-OES, XRD and TEM). The catalytic activity and selectivity for NH 3 formation have been studied using steady-state and transient experiments in chemical flow-reactors. Also, a number of in situ and operando experimental techniques, including infrared and X-ray absorption spectroscopy, have been used to reveal catalyst structure-function relationships. This thesis shows that Pd/Ce/Al 2 O 3 is a promising base for AFC formulations. This AFC exhibits high activity for NH 3 formation in the presence of model feed gas mixtures using either a direct source of hydrogen or hydrogen formed via the water-gas-shift reaction. It also has higher NH 3 formation activity than a three-way catalyst when using complex feed compositions containing reactants relevant to those one may encounter onboard lean-burn gasoline vehicles. The suppression of ammonia formation in net-oxidizing feeds is also investigated. In addition to oxidation of the reductant, a rapid growth in metal-oxides occurs as the feed becomes net-oxidizing. When oxidized, weak interaction between the noble metal phase and NO occurs, resulting in negligible NO dissociation. As dissociative adsorption of NO is a prerequisite step for NH 3 formation, this is identified as the limiting step for NH 3 formation from NO and H 2 in net-oxidizing conditions. Further, low-temperature ammonia formation is proposed as an important future area of research and the expansion towards utilisation of renewable fuels (alcohols) may open for even more efficient NH 3 formation over suitable catalysts...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{reduction}} of environmental contaminants {{that contribute to}} smog and soot is a worldwide goal that has seen an increased focus in recent years. In the United States, for example, {{it is estimated that}} by 2014 new rules will lead to a 71 % {{reduction of}} sulfur dioxide emissions and 52 % of nitrogen oxide emissions as compared to 2005 level. Thus, medium-sized plants (100 - 500 MW) that currently do not have flue gas desulfurization (FGD) units or <b>selective</b> <b>catalytic</b> <b>reduction</b> systems (<b>SCRs)</b> will be required to adapt. Similar emission reduction efforts are expected to be adopted globally, albeit at different levels. Wet-scrubber FGD is characterized {{as one of the most}} effective SO 2 removal techniques with low operating costs. However capital cost for implementation is considered high. Hence an effective optimization procedure is required to reduce these capital costs of conversion. Power plants commonly use a lime slurry spray reaction to reduce SO 2 emissions. Control of the droplets throughout the tower geometry is essential to ensuring maximum reduction while minimizing scale. The liquid slurry is known to have density, surface tension and viscosity values that deviate from standard water spray characteristics, which complicates process optimization. In order to improve the scrubber, nozzle characteristics and placement must be optimized to reduce the cost of the system implementation and mitigate risks of inadequate pollution reduction. A series of large flow rate, hydraulic, hollow cone sprays were investigated for this study. A Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model was used to examine potential scrubber designs for optimization of the system. Nozzle parameters were modeled to allow particle tracking through the system. An ANSYS Fluent Lagrangian particle tracking method was used with heat and mass transfer. The alkaline sorbent material and SO 2 reaction is modeled to determine uniformity and efficacy of the system. Volumetric chemistry mechanisms were used to simulate the reaction. These results demonstrate the expected liquid-gas interaction relative to the system efficiency. Drop size, liquid rheology, and spray array layout were examined to achieve SO 2 removal above 90 %.

The objective is to obtain the expression that would predict the conversion performance of the catalysts for different values of the SCR process parameters, namely temperature, inlet oxygen concentration and inlet ammonia concentration. The NOx emission, its formation and control methods are discussed briefly and then the fundamentals of the SCR process are described. Heat transfer based and chemical kinetics based SCR process models are discussed and widely used rate order based model are reviewed. Based on the experimental data, regression analysis was performed that gives an expression for predicting the SCR rate for the complete temperature range and the rate order with respect to inlet oxygen and ammonia concentration. The average activation energy for the SCR process was calculated and optimum operating conditions were determined {{for each of the}} catalyst. The applicable operating range for the catalyst depends on the NO conversion {{as well as on the}} ammonia slip and the N 2 O and NO 2 emission. The regression analysis was repeated for the applicable range and an expression was obtained that can be used to estimate the catalyst performance. For the Cu-ZSM- 5, the best performance was observed for 400 oC, 660 ppm inlet ammonia concentration and 0. 1 % inlet oxygen concentration. For the V based honeycomb monolith catalyst, the best performance was observed for 300 oC, 264 ppm inlet ammonia concentration and 3 % inlet oxygen concentration. For the V-Ti based PLIC catalyst, the best performance was observed for 350 oC, 330 ppm inlet ammonia concentration and 3 % inlet oxygen concentration. For the V-Ti-W based honeycomb monolith catalyst, the best performance was observed for 300 oC, 330 ppm inlet ammonia concentration and 3 % inlet oxygen concentration. The conversion performance of all of these catalysts is satisfactory for the industrial application. At the operating conditions listed above, the N 2 O emission is less than 20 ppm and the NO 2 emission is less than 10 ppm. The results were validated by comparing the findings with the similar work by other research groups. The mechanism of SCR process is discussed for each of the catalyst.

Department of Energy (DOE). As of 2004, more than 200 units representing approximately 75, 000 MWe of domestic coal fired capacity have been retrofit with ALSTOM low NOx technology. Best of class emissions range from 0. 18 lb/MMBtu for bituminous coals to 0. 10 lb/MMBtu for subbituminous coals, with typical levels at 0. 24 lb/MMBtu and 0. 13 lb/MMBtu, respectively. Despite these gains, NOx emissions limits in the U. S. continue to ratchet down for new and existing (retrofit) boiler equipment. If enacted, proposed Clear Skies legislation will, by 2008, require an average, effective, domestic NOx emissions rate of 0. 16 lb/MMBtu, which number will be reduced to 0. 13 lb/MMBtu by 2018. Such levels represent a 60 % and 67 % reduction, respectively, from the effective 2000 level of 0. 40 lb/MMBtu. Low cost solutions to meet such regulations, and in particular those that can avoid the need for a costly <b>selective</b> <b>catalytic</b> <b>reduction</b> system (<b>SCR),</b> provide a strong incentive to continue to improve low NOx firing system technology to meet current and anticipated NOx control regulations. In light of these needs, ALSTOM, in cooperation with the DOE, is developing an enhanced combustion, low NOx pulverized coal burner which, when integrated with ALSTOM's state-of-the-art, globally air staged low NOx firing systems, will provide a means to achieve less than 0. 15 lb/MMBtu NOx at less than 3 / 4 the cost of an SCR with low to no impact on balance of plant issues when firing a high volatile bituminous coal. Such coals can be more economic to fire than subbituminous or Powder River Basin (PRB) coals, but are more problematic from a NOx control standpoint as existing firing system technologies do not provide a means to meet current or anticipated regulations absent the use of an SCR. The DOE/ALSTOM program performed large pilot scale combustion testing in ALSTOM's Industrial Scale Burner Facility (ISBF) at its U. S. Power Plant Laboratories facility in Windsor, Connecticut. During this work, the near-field combustion environment was optimized to maximize NOx reduction while minimizing the impact on unburned carbon in ash, slagging and fouling, corrosion, and flame stability/turn-down under globally reducing conditions. Initially, ALSTOM utilized computational fluid dynamic modeling to evaluate a series of burner and/or near field stoichiometry controls in order to screen promising design concepts in advance of the large pilot scale testing. The third and final test, to be executed, will utilize several variants of the best nozzle tip configuration and compare performance with 3 different coals. The fuels to be tested will cover a wide range of coals commonly fired at US utilities. The completion of this work will provide sufficient data to allow ALSTOM to design, construct, and demonstrate a commercial version of an enhanced combustion low NOx pulverized coal burner. A preliminary cost/performance analysis of the developed enhanced combustion low NOx burner applied to ALSTOM's state-of-the-art TFS 2000 firing system was performed to show that the burner enhancements is a cost effective means to reduce NOx...|$|R
