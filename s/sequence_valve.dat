50|$|The main {{oxidizer}} valve (MOV) was a butterfly-type valve, spring-loaded to {{the closed}} position, pneumatically operated {{to the open}} position, and pneumatically assisted to the closed position. It was mounted between the oxidizer high-pressure duct from the oxidizer turbopump and the oxidizer inlet on the thrust chamber assembly. Pneumatic pressure from the normally closed port of the mainstage control solenoid valve was routed to both {{the first and second}} stage opening actuators of the main oxidizer valve. Application of opening pressure in this manner, together with controlled venting of the main oxidizer valve closing pressure through a thermal-compensating orifice, provided a controlled ramp opening of the main oxidizer valve through all temperature ranges. A <b>sequence</b> <b>valve,</b> located within the MOV assembly, supplied pneumatic pressure to the opening control part of the gas generator control valve and through an orifice to the closing part of the oxidizer turbine bypass valve.|$|E

The introduction describes the spread of a vibration in solid structures. For the combustion engine vibration and source of noise is dedicated an independent chapter, which focuses on all noise generators, not only mechanical and thermodynamic but also noise caused by fluid and gas flowing. An {{integral part of the}} thesis is also a list and examples of signal processing, serving for efficient localization of the noise root cause.

40|$|The binlifts of refuse {{collectors}} have {{a problem}} with binlift oscillations when the binlift is lowered slowly. The problem escalates with hot oil that has lower viscosity. Most problematic the oscillations are with an accessory scale on the binlift as it does not tolerate oscillations in the position where it takes measurements. These oscillations are caused by load control valves and wrong directional control valve spools make these oscillations worse. To figure out possible solutions for the oscillations the thesis has comprehensive load control valve theory part which summarizes all the traditional and latest inventions related to load control valves. This information is used in selecting valves for measurements. In this thesis there are measurements with different load control valves, directional control valve spools, restrictors, hoses and <b>sequence</b> <b>valves.</b> Measurements are done with a rear loader and they include flow and pressure measuring. These measurements are done to figure out which combination is the best compromise between energy consumption, oscillations and cost. This compromise should also fill all standardization requirements.

40|$|AbstractAchieving and {{maintaining}} a safe state during abnormal situations {{is essential for the}} safety design and safe operation of process facilities. This applies first of all to process control valve loops. The selection of the different control loop components can become a bit complicated because there are several design options and at least two different signal-response actions per component. This is especially true for split-range control loops with exclusively <b>sequenced</b> control <b>valves</b> that operate in different control ranges. These valves will never be open simultaneously and their fail-safe position under loss of signal and loss of motive utility requires special design attention. If the design was flawed or was compromised during maintenance then the system can respond in an unexpected manner during certain operating modes. Such an unexpected response was a contributing factor to a recent incident in a heavy oil processing facility.

ELVR with the one-way endobronchial Zephyr valves (EBV) has been demonstrated to improve pulmonary function, exercise capacity, {{and quality of life}} in patients with both heterogeneous and homogenous emphysema without collateral ventilation. In this "expert best practices" review, we will highlight the practical aspects of this therapy. Key selection criteria for ELVR are hyperinflation with a residual volume > 175 % of predicted, forced expiratory volume 100 m. Patients with repeated infectious complications, severe bronchiectasis, and those with unstable cardiovascular comorbidities should be excluded from EBV treatment.

40|$|Abstract Background Real-time {{cardiovascular}} {{magnetic resonance}} (rtCMR) is considered attractive for guiding TAVI. Owing to an unlimited scan plane orientation and an unsurpassed soft-tissue contrast with simultaneous device visualization, rtCMR {{is presumed to}} allow safe device navigation and to offer optimal orientation for precise axial positioning. We sought to evaluate the preclinical feasibility of rtCMR-guided transarterial aortic valve implatation (TAVI) using the nitinol-based Medtronic CoreValve bioprosthesis. Methods rtCMR-guided transfemoral (n = 2) and transsubclavian (n = 6) TAVI was performed in 8 swine using the original CoreValve prosthesis and a modified, CMR-compatible delivery catheter without ferromagnetic components. Results rtCMR using TrueFISP sequences provided reliable imaging guidance during TAVI, which was successful in 6 swine. One transfemoral attempt failed due to unsuccessful aortic arch passage and one pericardial tamponade with subsequent death occurred {{as a result of}} ventricular perforation by the device tip due to an operating error, this complication being detected without delay by rtCMR. rtCMR allowed for a detailed, simultaneous visualization of the delivery system with the mounted stent-valve and the surrounding anatomy, resulting in improved visualization during navigation through the vasculature, passage of the aortic valve, and during placement and deployment of the stent-valve. Post-interventional success could be confirmed using ECG-triggered time-resolved cine-TrueFISP and flow-sensitive phase-contrast <b>sequences.</b> Intended <b>valve</b> position was confirmed by ex-vivo histology. Conclusions Our study shows that rtCMR-guided TAVI using the commercial CoreValve prosthesis in conjunction with a modified delivery system is feasible in swine, allowing improved procedural guidance including immediate detection of complications and direct functional assessment with reduction of radiation and omission of contrast media. </p...|$|R

Methods One hundred twenty-two patients aged 49. 2 ± 17. 2 (42 women) were included in the study; 4 of them were ex-cluded. A steady-state free-precession (SSFP) sequence was the basis of the visualization and analysis of the coronary sinus as well as Thebesian valve. In selected cases, dedicated coro-nary sinus sequences were created. All data were evaluated by experienced cardiac magnetic resonance investigators. Results We were able to visualize the coronary sinus by using basic SSFP sequence in all patients, however in four cases in suboptimal quality. Average length of the coronary sinus was 39. 73 ± 16. 9 mm, average diameter was 9. 81 ± 9. 3 mm, and average angle of the entrance of the coronary sinus into the right atrium was 111. 37 ± 13. 8 °.

40|$|PURPOSE: Histologic {{examination}} of valve samples is considered as {{the gold standard}} for the diagnosis of infectious endocarditis. Molecular tools are also very promising for patients with negative-culture endocarditis. Thus, we studied the contribution of valvular histology, culture, and 16 S rRNA PCR amplification plus sequencing to the diagnosis of infectious endocarditis in patients undergoing valve surgery. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We performed culture, histological examination, and broad-range PCR amplification plus <b>sequencing</b> on <b>valve</b> samples taken from 127 patients with infectious endocarditis and from 118 patients without endocarditis. The sensitivity and specificity of these tests for the diagnosis of endocarditis in patients undergoing valve surgery were studied. RESULTS: The sensitivity of PCR was of 61 % (64 / 105) whereas that of histological examination was of 63 % (62 / 98) and that of valve culture was of only 13 % (14 / 105). All 68 positive PCR results considered reliable according to an interpretation scheme were from patients with infectious endocarditis, resulting in a 100 % (118 / 118) specificity of the interpreted molecular approach. The specificity of histology was also of 100 % (118 / 118) when using stringent criteria (ie, presence of vegetation, microorganisms, and/or valvular inflammation with mainly polymorphonuclear cells). PCR identified an etiological agent in 38 % (5 / 13) of definite blood culture-negative infectious endocarditis.

30|$|The role {{of cardiac}} MRI (CMR) {{in the initial}} {{diagnosis}} of suspected aortic valve endocarditis is limited. Vegetations are best depicted on SSFP cine imaging as low signal masses attached to the valve surface or endocardium, which oscillate during the cardiac cycle. The lower spatial resolution of CMR compared to CT or TOE limits its diagnostic role in suspected IE. The presence of an off-resonance artefact, particularly at 3.0 Tesla, can hinder the use of SSFP <b>sequences</b> in aortic <b>valve</b> imaging, often requiring the use of gradient echo (GRE) cine imaging [23]. There is little data {{on the performance of}} CMR in detecting vegetations, but it can provide haemodynamic information. CMR can help quantify the severity of aortic insufficiency, if present, which can be useful in triaging patients with endocarditis to medical or surgical treatment (Table 2) [17].

40|$|Various {{plants have}} the ability to follow the sun with their flowers or leaves {{during the course of a}} day via a {{mechanism}} known as heliotropism. This mechanism is characterised by the introduction of pressure gradients between neighbouring motor cells in the plant׳s stem, enabling the stem to bend. By adapting this bio-inspired mechanism to mechanical systems, a new class of smart structures can be created. The developed overall structure is made up of a number of cellular colonies, each consisting of a central pressure source surrounded by multiple cells. After launch, the cellular arrays are deployed in space and are either preassembled or alternatively are attached together during their release or afterwards. A central pressure source is provided by a high-pressure storage unit with an integrated valve, which provides ingress gas flow to the system; the gas is then routed through the system via a <b>sequence</b> of <b>valve</b> operations and cellular actuations, allowing for any desired shape to be achieved within the constraints of the deployed array geometry. This smart structure consists of a three dimensional adaptable cellular array with fluid controlling Micro Electromechanical Systems (MEMS) components enabling the structure to change its global shape.

Ex vivo testing was performed using previously described techniques for the evaluation of magnetic field interactions (deflection angle and torque), heating (gel-filled phantom and fluoroptic thermometry; 15 min of MR im-aging at a whole body–averaged specific absorption rate of 1. 2 W/kg), and artifacts (using T 1 -weighted, spin echo, and gradient echo pulse <b>sequences).</b> One heart <b>valve</b> prosthesis and one annuloplasty ring showed no magnetic field interactions. Two heart valve prostheses and one annuloplasty ring displayed relatively minor mag-netic field interactions (i. e., deflection angle 6 degrees, torque, 1). Heating was 0. 7 °C for the five different implants. Artifacts varied depending on the amount and type of metal used to make the implants. For the three heart valve prostheses and two annuloplasty rings, the lack of substantial magnetic field interactions and relatively minor hearing indicated that MR procedures may be conducted safetly in patients with these implants using MR systems operating with static magnetic fields of 1. 5 T or less.

40|$|ObjectivesBicuspid {{aortic valve}} {{is the most}} common {{congenital}} cardiac abnormality, occurring in 1 % to 2 % of the population, and often associates with ascending aortic aneurysm. Based on familial studies, bicuspid aortic valve with aneurysm segregates in an autosomal dominant manner with incomplete penetrance. NOTCH 1 mutations have been reported in 6 families with prominent valve calcification and dysfunction and low penetrance of aneurysm. We sought to determine the contribution of NOTCH 1 mutations to the more common phenotype of highly penetrant aneurysms with low penetrance of bicuspid aortic valve and with rare valve calcification or dysfunction. MethodsAll exons and splice junctions of NOTCH 1 were sequenced in probands from 13 affected families presenting with bicuspid aortic valve with ascending aortic aneurysm in the absence of valve calcification. In addition, mutation analysis was performed on a single individual with aneurysm and calcified tricuspid aortic <b>valve.</b> <b>Sequences</b> were aligned and compared with the reference genomic sequence. ResultsCorroborating previous studies, analysis of the single sporadic patient with calcified aortic valve in the presence of ascending aortic aneurysm revealed a novel heterozygous missense mutation in NOTCH 1 resulting in a nonsynonymous amino acid substitution (p. T 1090 S, c. C 3269 G) of an evolutionarily conserved residue. This change was not observed in controls. In contrast, we did not identify any pathologic NOTCH 1 mutations in the 13  families segregating noncalcified bicuspid aortic valve with highly penetrant aortic aneurysm. ConclusionsThese data suggest that there are phenotypic differences that distinguish families with and without NOTCH 1 mutations, indicating a genotype–phenotype correlation with potential implications for patient diagnosis, counseling, and management...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The task of creating the operating procedures for a processing plant is time consuming and requires the involvement of {{key members of the}} design team. As one of the consequences, the writing of operating procedures is often put off till the final stages of the design process. However, some operability problems will remain hidden in the design until the operating procedure is considered. These problems are expensive to fix because they require undoing some of the design decisions that have already been made. This thesis reports on research into the automatic creation of operating procedures, a field of research sometimes called Operating Procedure Synthesis (OPS). One motivation for OPS research is to develop a tool that can detect operability problems in the design of a plant and thus allow operability problems to be considered earlier in the design process reducing the cost of resolving these problems. Previous OPS systems are generally based around single techniques such as mixed integer linear programming. All the techniques that have been examined in the past are strong in some aspects of OPS and weak in some other aspects. There is no single technique that is strong in all areas of OPS. As a result, no previous OPS system is able to generate all the procedures used as examples in the OPS literature. This thesis presents a new approach to OPS. In this approach, OPS is viewed as a set of distinct but related subtasks. Three subtasks have been identified and examined in this work, namely planning, safety and <b>valve</b> <b>sequencing.</b> Algorithms have been developed to address each of these three subtasks individually. These algorithms have been integrated to form a single OPS system by using a common representation of the operating procedure to be created...|$|R

We compared the behavior and gene expression of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) in the valve sinus vs nonvalve sites to elucidate biologic differences associated with vein valves. METHODS: Tissue explants of fresh human saphenous veins were prepared, and the migration of SMCs from explants of valve sinus vs nonvalve sinus areas was measured. Proliferation and death of SMCs were determined by staining for Ki 67 and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling. Proliferation and migration of passaged valve vs nonvalve SMCs were determined by cell counts and using microchemotaxis chambers. Global gene expression in valve vs nonvalve intima-media was determined by RNA <b>sequencing.</b> RESULTS: <b>Valve</b> SMCs demonstrated greater proliferation in tissue explants compared with nonvalve SMCs (19. 3 % ± 5. 4 % vs 6. 8 % ± 2. 0 % Ki 67 -positive nuclei at 4 days, respectively; mean ± standard error of the mean, five veins; P <. 05). This was also true for migration (18. 2 ± 2. 7 vs 7. 5 ± 3. 0 migrated SMCs/explant at 6 days, respectively; 24 veins, 15 explants/vein; P <. 0001). Cell death was not different (39. 6 % ± 16. 1 % vs 41. 5 % ± 16. 0 % terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling-positive cells, respectively, at 4 days, five veins). Cultured valve SMCs also proliferated faster than nonvalve SMCs in response to platelet-derived growth factor subunit BB (2. 9 ± 0. 2 -fold vs 2. 1 ± 0. 2 -fold of control, respectively; P <. 001; n = 5 pairs of cells). This was also true for migration (6. 5 ± 1. 2 -fold vs 4. 4 ± 0. 8 -fold of control, respectively; P <. 001; n = 7 pairs of cells). Blockade of fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF 2) inhibited the increased responses of valve SMCs but {{had no effect on}} nonvalve SMCs. Exogenous FGF 2 increased migration of valve but not of nonvalve SMCs. Unlike in the isolated, cultured cells, blockade of FGF 2 in the tissue explants did not block migration of valve or nonvalve SMCs from the explants. Thirty-seven genes were differentially expressed by valve compared with nonvalve intimal-medial tissue (11 veins). Peptide-mediated inhibition of SEMA 3 A, one of the differentially expressed genes, increased the number of migrated SMCs of valve but not of nonvalve explants. CONCLUSIONS: Valve compared with nonvalve SMCs have greater rates of migration and proliferation, which may in part explain the propensity for pathologic lesion formation in valves. Whereas FGF 2 mediates these effects in cultured SMCs, the mediators of these stimulatory effects in the valve wall tissue remain unclear but may be among the differentially expressed genes discovered in this study. One of these genes, SEMA 3 A, mediates a valve-specific inhibitory effect on the injury response of valve SMCs...|$|R
40|$|The {{milk powder}} {{facilities}} {{of the factory}} Nestle La Penilla covers from the reception of the milk to the dryer and dry mix of the different products. Milk from Nestle farmers is analyzed to check its quality, if everything is correct the milk undergoes thermization, which consists of a heat treatment to reduce the microbial flora for further storage in silos. Milk is standardized and is treated in the evaporator, which aims {{to reduce the amount}} of water. In the dairy industry, the evaporation is used to concentrate products like milk, skimmed milk and dairy whey. It is also used as a preliminary treatment before drying. Dissolved solids in milk do not evaporate, so there is an increase of the concentration in the liquid phase. To perform this operation triple effect falling film evaporator plus a finisher is used. The objective of this project is to increase the evaporator capability. There are several points to improve: i) Increase the mass flow treated for each product, in the case of condensed milk from 7. 500 L/h to 8. 000 L/h and in products like 1 % milk Sveltesse and 26 % milk from 7. 800 L/h up to 8. 000 L/h. ii) Reduce the time required for sterilizations. iii) Optimization of operating conditions. However, this objective is subjected to the following restriction: the quality of the product, measured as the amount of total solids at the evaporator outlet, a theoretical 75 % for condensed milk and 44 % to 1 % and 26 % milk respectively, has to be maintained. The DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve and Control) methodology, used by Six Sigma, is used systematically in the company Nestle to solve problems appearing during operation. DMAIC methodology is divided into five stages that are solved iteratively. Therefore, this is the methodology employed in the present work. It has been observed and reported that the overall efficiency and production is improved due to automation. So, control loops, process <b>sequences</b> or <b>valves</b> and pumps operation have been modified in this work. The main result of the project has been achieved because the capability of the evaporator has been increased, so now it can be operating 350 hours more. This is due to an increase in the flow of the products to 8. 000 L/h and because the sterilization time has been reduced at an average of 47, 3 minutes for sterilization. Savings in water consumption have been also obtained, corresponding to 114, 5 m 3 /yr due to reduced sterilizations and 1. 260 m 3 per year in the automation, which represents 1. 374, 5 m 3 /yr. An increase in the temperature of the separator finisher has been achieved up to an average of 52 °C, which allows, together with the enhancement in the milk distribution into the evaporation tubes due to the increment of flow, a reduction in the pressure of the thermocompressor about 0, 5 bar. All these improvements have been carried out without affecting the quality of the product. Máster en Ingeniería Químic...|$|R
