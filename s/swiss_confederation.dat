5|$|The {{peace with}} Britain {{proved to be}} uneasy and controversial. Britain did not {{evacuate}} Malta as promised and protested against Bonaparte's annexation of Piedmont and his Act of Mediation, which established a new <b>Swiss</b> <b>Confederation.</b> Neither of these territories were covered by Amiens, but they inflamed tensions significantly. The dispute culminated in {{a declaration of war}} by Britain in May 1803; Napoleon responded by reassembling the invasion camp at Boulogne.|$|E

5|$|The Reformation {{spread to}} other parts of the <b>Swiss</b> <b>Confederation,</b> but several cantons resisted, preferring to remain Catholic. Zwingli formed an {{alliance}} of Reformed cantons which divided the Confederation along religious lines. In 1529, a war between the two sides was averted at the last moment. Meanwhile, Zwingli's ideas came to the attention of Martin Luther and other reformers. They met at the Marburg Colloquy and although they agreed on many points of doctrine, they could not reach an accord on the doctrine of the Real Presence of Christ in the Eucharist.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Swiss</b> <b>Confederation</b> in Huldrych Zwingli's time {{consisted}} of thirteen states (cantons) {{as well as}} affiliated areas and common lordships. Unlike the modern state of Switzerland, which operates under a federal government, each of the thirteen cantons was nearly independent, conducting its own domestic and foreign affairs. Each canton formed its own alliances within and without the Confederation. This relative independence served {{as the basis for}} conflict {{during the time of the}} Reformation when the various cantons divided between different confessional camps. Military ambitions gained an additional impetus with the competition to acquire new territory and resources, as seen for example in the Old Zurich War of 1440–1446.|$|E
5|$|Despite the longed-for peace, {{tensions}} grew between France {{and most}} of the First Coalition allies, either separately or jointly. Ferdinand IV of Naples refused to pay agreed-upon tribute to France, and his subjects followed this refusal with a rebellion. The French invaded Naples and established the Parthenopaean Republic. A republican uprising in the Swiss cantons, encouraged by the French Republic which offered military support, led to the overthrow of the <b>Swiss</b> <b>Confederation</b> and the establishment of the Helvetic Republic. On his way to Egypt in Spring 1798, Napoleon had stopped on the Island of Malta and removed the Hospitallers from their possessions. This angered Paul, Tsar of Russia, who was the honorary head of the Order. The ongoing French occupation of Malta angered the British, who dedicated themselves to ejecting the French garrison at Valletta. The French Directory was convinced that the Austrians were conniving to start another war. Indeed, the weaker the French Republic seemed, the more seriously the Austrians, the Neapolitans, the Russians, and the British actually discussed this possibility.|$|E
50|$|Haller {{was born}} into an old Swiss family at Bern. Prevented by long-continued ill-health from taking part in boyish sports, he had more {{opportunity}} {{for the development of}} his precocious mind. At the age of four, it is said, he used to read and expound the Bible to his father's servants; before he was ten he had sketched a Chaldee grammar, prepared a Greek and a Hebrew vocabulary, compiled a collection of two thousand biographies of famous men and women on the model of the great works of Bayle and Moréri, and written in Latin verse a satire on his tutor, who had warned him against a too great excursiveness. When still hardly fifteen he was already the author of numerous metrical translations from Ovid, Horace and Virgil, as well as of original lyrics, dramas, and an epic of four thousand lines on the origin of the <b>Swiss</b> <b>confederations,</b> writings which he is said on one occasion to have rescued from a fire at the risk of his life, only, however, to burn them a little later (1729) with his own hand.|$|R

5|$|The Swiss Federal budget had a size of 62.8 billion Swiss francs in 2010, {{which is}} an {{equivalent}} 11.35% of the country's GDP in that year; however, the regional (canton) budgets and the budgets of the municipalities are not counted {{as part of the}} federal budget and the total rate of government spending is closer to 33.8% of GDP. The main sources of income for the federal government are the value-added tax (33%) and the direct federal tax (29%) and the main expenditure is located in the areas of social welfare and finance & tax. The expenditures of the <b>Swiss</b> <b>Confederation</b> have been growing from 7% of GDP in 1960 to 9.7% in 1990 and to 10.7% in 2010. While the sectors social welfare and finance & tax have been growing from 35% in 1990 to 48.2% in 2010, a significant reduction of expenditures has been occurring in the sectors of agriculture and national defence; from 26.5% in to 12.4% (estimation for the year 2015).|$|E
5|$|The {{relation}} {{of church and}} state in Zwingli's mind is best represented in a statue by the Wasserkirche, where he stands with a Bible {{in one hand and a}} sword in the other. For him, the church and state are one under the sovereign rule of God. The development of the complex relationship between church and state in Zwingli's view can only be understood by examining the context of his life, the city of Zürich, and the wider <b>Swiss</b> <b>Confederation.</b> His earliest writings before he became a reformer, such as The Ox (1510) and The Labyrinth (1516), reveal a patriotic love of his land, a longing for liberty, and opposition to the mercenary service where young Swiss citizens were sent to fight in foreign wars for the financial benefit of the state government. His life as a parish priest and an army chaplain helped to develop his concern for morality and justice. He saw his ministry not limited to a private sphere, but to the people as a whole.|$|E
5|$|The treaty {{called for}} {{meetings}} between the involved parties {{to work out}} the exact territorial and remunerative details. Convened at a small town in the mid-Rhineland, Rastatt, the Congress quickly derailed in a mire of intrigue and diplomatic posturing. The French demanded more territory. The Austrians were reluctant to cede the designated territories. Compounding the Congress's problems, tensions grew between France and most of the First Coalition allies. Ferdinand of Naples refused to pay agreed-upon tribute to France, and his subjects followed this refusal with a rebellion. The French invaded Naples and established the Parthenopaean Republic. Encouraged by the French Republic, a republican uprising in the Swiss cantons led to the overthrow of the <b>Swiss</b> <b>Confederation</b> and the establishment of the Helvetic Republic. The French Directory was convinced that the Austrians were planning to start another war. Indeed, the weaker France seemed, the more seriously the Austrians, the Neapolitans, the Russians, and the English discussed this possibility. In mid-spring, the Austrians reached an agreement with Tsar Paul of Russia by which the legendary Alexander Suvorov would come out of retirement to assist Austria in Italy with another 60,000 troops.|$|E

50|$|Two {{years later}} Franson left for his homeland. While {{carrying}} on an extensive ministry in Europe, {{he heard the}} well-known missionary statesman, Hudson Taylor, challenge {{people to go to}} China with the gospel. From that encounter, Franson got a vision to form missionary sending agencies in various European countries, and before he left the continent, six such organizations had come into being: Danish Mission <b>Confederation,</b> <b>Swiss</b> Alliance Mission, German Alliance Mission, Finnish Alliance Mission, Swedish Evangelical Mission in Japan, and Swedish Alliance Mission. All six agencies continue to send out missionaries to this day.|$|R
5|$|Zwingli {{was ordained}} in Constance, {{the seat of}} the local diocese, and he celebrated his first Mass in his hometown, Wildhaus, on 29 September 1506. As a young priest he had studied little theology, but this was not {{considered}} unusual at the time. His first ecclesiastical post was the pastorate of the town of Glarus, where he stayed for ten years. It was in Glarus, whose soldiers were used as mercenaries in Europe, that Zwingli became involved in politics. The <b>Swiss</b> <b>Confederation</b> was embroiled in various campaigns with its neighbours: the French, the Habsburgs, and the Papal States. Zwingli placed himself solidly {{on the side of the}} Roman See. In return, Pope Julius II honoured Zwingli by providing him with an annual pension. He took the role of chaplain in several campaigns in Italy, including the Battle of Novara in 1513. However, the decisive defeat of the Swiss in the Battle of Marignano caused a shift in mood in Glarus in favour of the French rather than the pope. Zwingli, the papal partisan, found himself in a difficult position and he decided to retreat to Einsiedeln in the canton of Schwyz. By this time, he had become convinced that mercenary service was immoral and that Swiss unity was indispensable for any future achievements. Some of his earliest extant writings, such as The Ox (1510) and The Labyrinth (1516), attacked the mercenary system using allegory and satire. His countrymen were presented as virtuous people within a French, imperial, and papal triangle. Zwingli stayed in Einsiedeln for two years during which he withdrew completely from politics in favour of ecclesiastical activities and personal studies.|$|E

50|$|The idea {{to build}} a {{dedicated}} national monument housing the foundational documents of the Confederacywas first proposed in 1891 by federal councillors Emil Welti and Carl Schenk. This plan was revisited in 1915 during {{the preparation of the}} 600th anniversary celebration for the Battle of Morgarten, but its realisation was delayed due to World War I.After the war, the canton of Schwyz requested federal support for the project, which was granted in 1928.Designed by Joseph Beeler in 1933, the Bundesbriefarchiv (Federal Charter Archive) was opened in 1936.In 1979/80, the exhibition hall was renovated, and restoration work was carried out on the 21 banners and flags displayed in the museum. In 1998/99, the exhibition was re-arranged. In the meantime, the institution changed its name to Bundesbriefmuseum (Museum of the <b>Swiss</b> Charters of <b>Confederation).</b>|$|R
5|$|The wider {{political}} environment in Europe during the 15th and 16th centuries was also volatile. For centuries {{the relationship with}} the Confederation's powerful neighbour, France, determined the foreign policies of the <b>Swiss.</b> Nominally, the <b>Confederation</b> formed a part of the Holy Roman Empire. However, through a succession of wars culminating in the Swabian War in 1499, the Confederation had become de facto independent. As the two continental powers and minor regional states such as the Duchy of Milan, the Duchy of Savoy, and the Papal States competed and fought against each other, there were far-reaching political, economic, and social consequences for the Confederation. During this time the mercenary pension system became a subject of disagreement. The religious factions of Zwingli's time debated vociferously the merits of sending young Swiss men to fight in foreign wars mainly for the enrichment of the cantonal authorities.|$|R
40|$|Although Swiss {{unions are}} notionally {{independent}} from political parties, scholars have distinguished three currents within the Swiss labour movement: a left-wing current around the <b>Swiss</b> Trade Union <b>Confederation</b> (SGB-USS), related to Social Democrats (PS-PS); a Catholic current around Travail. Suisse, related to Christian Democrats (CVP-PDC); and a non-aligned, politically moderate current, {{which consists of}} autonomous white-collar employee associations (e. g the KV). Whereas the relations between Travail. Suisse and the CVP-PDC deteriorated during the past decade, all Swiss unions consolidated or even strengthened their ties with the Social Democrats, despite a declining working class vote for the SP-PS. This suggests that changes in Swiss party–union relations do not so much reflect changing social cleavages, but rather the contingent political opportunity structures built into Switzerland’s direct democratic political system that strengthens {{to the role of}} interest association vis-à-vis political parties...|$|R
25|$|In 1707 {{following}} the death of Marie de Nemours, Duchess of Nemours and Princess of Neuchâtel, the city, which was on the border of the <b>Swiss</b> <b>Confederation,</b> had to choose her successor from among fifteen claimants. While Louis XIV promoted a number of French pretenders to the title, the Protestant cantons of the <b>Swiss</b> <b>Confederation</b> encouraged Neuchâtel to select the Protestant King Frederick I of Prussia. In a victory for the Protestant half of the Confederation, Frederick I, who claimed his entitlement in a rather complicated fashion through the Houses of Orange and Nassau, was selected.|$|E
25|$|A {{year later}} {{he agreed to}} allow the principality to join the <b>Swiss</b> <b>Confederation,</b> then not yet an {{integrated}} federation, but a confederacy, as a full member.

This situation changed in 1848 when a peaceful revolution took place and established a republic, in the same year that the modern <b>Swiss</b> <b>Confederation</b> was transformed into a federation. King Frederick William IV of Prussia did not give in immediately and several attempts at counter-revolution took place, culminating in the Neuchâtel Crisis of 1856–57. In 1857, Frederick William renounced his claims on the area.|$|E
