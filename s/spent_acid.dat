40|$|Viscoelastic {{surfactant}} {{have found}} numerous application {{in the oil}} fields as fracturing and matrix acidizing fluid additives in the recent years. They {{have the ability to}} form long worm-like micelles with the increase in pH and calcium concentration, which results in increasing the viscosity and elasticity of partially <b>spent</b> <b>acids.</b> On one hand, concentration of surfactant in the fluids has profound effects on their performance downhole. Additionally, there is continuous debate in the industry on whether the gel generated by these surfactants causes formation damage, especially in dry gas wells. Therefore, being able to analyze the concentration of these surfactants in both live and <b>spent</b> <b>acids</b> is of great importance for production engineers who apply surfactant-based fluids in the oil fields. In the present work, a two-phase titration method was optimized for quantitative analysis of a carboxybetaine viscoelastic surfactant, and surfactant retention in calcite cores was quantitatively determined by two phase titration method and the benefits of using mutual solvents to break the surfactant gel formed inside the cores was assessed. On the other hand, high temperatures and low pH are usually involved in surfactant applications. Surfactants are subjected to hydrolysis under such conditions due to the existence of a peptide bond (-CO-NH-) in their molecules, leading to alteration in the rheological properties of the acid. The impact of hydrolysis at high temperatures on the apparent viscosity of carboxybetaine viscoelastic surfactant-based acids was evaluated in the present study, and the mechanism of viscosity changes was determine by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Our results indicate that, first, significant amount of surfactant has been retained in the carbonate matrix after acidizing treatment and {{there is a need to}} use internal breakers when surfactant-based acids are used in dry gas wells or water injectors. Second, hydrolysis at high temperatures has great impact on surfactant-acid rheological properties.

30|$|Moreover, it {{has been}} {{described}} by McCune et al. (1975) that “rock sample with permeability less than 100 mD could be acidized more successfully compare to the sands having more permeability. Study on porosity showed that sandstone formation with the porosity less than 20 % was treated much more adequately than those with porosity 25 % or more.” Other than acids, some additives are also added during sandstone acidizing procedure for different purposes. Frenier and Hill (2002) showed that these additives have a minimal effect on the performance of the acids. For example, stimulation process is not affected by the addition of certain additives such as surfactants and corrosion inhibitors. These additives are added to minimize other problems like corrosion and incompatibility (Rabie and Nasr-El-Din 2015). Incompatibility problems can be minimized using surfactant additives in the main acid and after-flush stages. Corrosion inhibitors are used at concentrations of 0.1 % uniformly throughout the acid stages to protect the metal integrity (McLeod et al. 1983). Iron sequestrants are added in the HCl stage to stabilize any dissolved iron and to minimize the precipitation of iron compounds. A mutual solvent ethylene glycol monobutyl ether (EGMBE) was included in the after-flush stage to restore the formation wettability and to reduce the surface tension of the returning <b>spent</b> <b>acids</b> Sutton and Lasater (1972).|$|R
40|$|At the Savannah River Site (SRS), {{oxalic acid}} is {{currently}} considered the preferred agent for chemically cleaning the large underground Liquid Radioactive Waste Tanks. It is applied {{only in the}} final stages of emptying a tank when generally less than 5, 000 kg of waste solids remain, and slurrying based removal methods are no-longer effective. The use of oxalic acid is preferred because of its combined dissolution and chelating properties, as well as the fact that corrosion to the carbon steel tank walls can be controlled. Although oxalic acid is the preferred agent, there are significant potential downstream impacts. Impacts include: (1) Degraded evaporator operation; (2) Resultant oxalate precipitates taking away critically needed operating volume; and (3) Eventual creation of significant volumes of additional feed to salt processing. As an alternative to dealing with the downstream impacts, oxalate decomposition using variations of ozone based Advanced Oxidation Process (AOP) were investigated. In general AOPs use ozone or peroxide and a catalyst to create hydroxyl radicals. Hydroxyl radicals have among the highest oxidation potentials, and are commonly used to decompose organics. Although oxalate is considered among the most difficult organic to decompose, the ability of hydroxyl radicals to decompose oxalate is considered to be well demonstrated. In addition, as AOPs are considered to be 'green' their use enables any net chemical additions to the waste to be minimized. In order to test the ability to decompose the oxalate and determine the decomposition rates, a test rig was designed, where 10 vol% ozone would be educted into a <b>spent</b> oxalic <b>acid</b> decomposition loop, with the loop maintained at 70 C and recirculated at 40 L/min. Each of the <b>spent</b> oxalic <b>acid</b> streams would be created from three oxalic acid strikes of an F-area simulant (i. e., Purex = high Fe/Al concentration) and H-area simulant (i. e., H area modified Purex = high Al/Fe concentration) after nearing dissolution equilibrium, and then decomposed to {le} 100 Parts per Million (ppm) oxalate. Since AOP technology largely originated on using ultraviolet (UV) light as a primary catalyst, decomposition of the <b>spent</b> oxalic <b>acid,</b> well exposed to a medium pressure mercury vapor light was considered the benchmark. However, with multi-valent metals already contained in the feed, and maintenance of the UV light a concern; testing was conducted to evaluate the impact from removing the UV light. Using current AOP terminology, the test without the UV light would likely be considered an ozone based, dark, ferrioxalate type, decomposition process. Specifically, as part of the testing, the impacts from the following were investigated: (1) Importance of the UV light on the decomposition rates when decomposing 1 wt% spent oxalic acid; (2) Impact of increasing the oxalic acid strength from 1 to 2. 5 wt% on the decomposition rates; and (3) For F-area testing, the advantage of increasing the <b>spent</b> oxalic <b>acid</b> flowrate from 40 L/min (liters/minute) to 50 L/min during decomposition of the 2. 5 wt% <b>spent</b> oxalic <b>acid.</b> The results showed that removal of the UV light (from 1 wt% testing) slowed the decomposition rates in both the F & H testing. Specifically, for F-Area Strike 1, the time increased from about 6 hours to 8 hours. In H-Area, the impact was not as significant, with the time required for Strike 1 to be decomposed to less than 100 ppm increasing slightly, from 5. 4 to 6. 4 hours. For the spent 2. 5 wt% oxalic acid decomposition tests (all) without the UV light, the F-area decompositions required approx. 10 to 13 hours, while the corresponding required H-Area decompositions times ranged from 10 to 21 hours. For the 2. 5 wt% F-Area sludge, the increased availability of iron likely caused the increased decomposition rates compared to the 1 wt% oxalic acid based tests. In addition, for the F-testing, increasing the recirculation flow rates from 40 liter/minute to 50 liter/minute resulted in an increased decomposition rate, suggesting a better use of ozone...|$|R
