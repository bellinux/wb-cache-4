Besides its giant hamburger, the restaurant was known for its Triple Decker Grilled Cheese sandwich and a The Hangover omelet made with bacon, cheese, French fries, and mushrooms. Ice cream sundaes featured a choice of toppings including butterscotch sauce, chocolate sauce, hot fudge, marshmallow sauce, Oreo kisses, peanut butter sauce, rainbow sprinkles, raspberry sauce, etc. Other options included Fried Twinkies, brownies, and the Golden Opulence sundae, an indulgent $1,000 US sundae, which holds the Guinness World Record for the Most Expensive Ice Cream Sundae in the World.

40|$|Abstract This thesis {{studies the}} {{formation}} of entrepreneurial opportunity as a process. More specifically, it investigates how an illusion becomes an entrepreneurial opportunity when the entrepreneur makes effort to achieve growth in the business. The study contributes to the opportunity discussion in the entrepreneurship literature and more detailed to the opportunity related process literature. The study was conducted as a single case study. The case is an opportunity production process and the data was gathered from a small Finnish Oulu based software firm in May 2014. The firm quickly doubled its annual turnover close to one million euros. All four owners work for the firm as entrepreneurs {{and two of the}} three major owners were interviewed. An idea of opportunity becomes an entrepreneurial opportunity through the opportunity production process. The results indicate firstly that stakeholders, for example a customer, can be involved in the process in its early stages such as in the conceptualisation of an opportunity idea. The customer can be the primary source of an opportunity idea or an active stakeholder in the interaction in the conceptualisation phase. In the existing literature, such stakeholder as customer is not involved {{in the beginning of the}} opportunity production process. Second suggested contribution is that entrepreneurs are simultaneously engaged in both the discover and creation types of activities during the opportunity production process. <b>Serendipities</b> have a role as the source of opportunity ideas in the opportunity production process. Entrepreneurs are continually involved in some kind of search endeavour and they are alert to be aware of objective opportunities. Entrepreneurs’ activities are triggered by <b>serendipities</b> and they may also be triggered by other kinds of activities which have origins in the opportunity discovery processes...|$|R

40|$|The {{variety of}} how {{evaluations}} are {{put to use}} has attracted the interest of many scholars.

In this paper-session {{the impact of a}} specific evaluation applying program-theory will be in focus. The evaluation concerned a statutory Swedish program. Aimed at reducing homelessness, an investment of 5 million Euro engaged 23 innovative projects nationwide. Homelessness is a wicked social problem exhibiting great resistance to current solutions while engaging numerous actors, organizations and agencies simultaneously and at various levels within public and civil domains.

40|$|It {{has never}} been the aim of art {{photography}} to provide simple testimony to the unfurling of daily life - at least, not of its substance, its insipid ordinariness. The photographic image, after all, is only indicative. It is also, and especially, the representation of a reality the contours of which it determines. Without being an aporetic motif of photography, the quotidian never appears as it is; the photographic image reveals its symbolic space. And for Yan Giguère, who walks through life without waiting for events to occur, the happenstances and <b>serendipities</b> of existence are not so much the subject as the background. They are, in a way, the basis for an intent that is ambitious yet treated with poetry and lightness: the portrayal of a quotidian transcended, liberated in a collective unconscious whose main quality is spirituality - that of humanity, its make-up, from Monday to Sunday...|$|R

40|$|In this project, I use {{computational}} modeling {{to study}} {{the ways in which}} organizations can benefit from uncertainty. In particular, my goal is to understand how organizations can capture opportunities to innovate, given that innovation depends on at least some level of uncertainty. This underlying assumption takes into account that the history of innovation is replete with stories of <b>serendipities</b> and lucky accidents. Two distinct processes that drive innovation, the discovery of new knowledge and the recombination of existing knowledge (Arthur, 2009), are both frequently sparked by chance events. A common thread in most—if not all—accounts of accidental innovation is that despite the element of surprise, the innovators knew they had stumbled upon something valuable. As Louis Pasteur famously said, “Chance favors the prepared mind. ” Chance, however, arises due to uncertainty, and given uncertainty, it is often unclear what constitutes a prepared mind. In an uncertain environment, the present and the future are often sufficiently decoupled such that organizations may not even have a hint of what will come their way and how to be ready for it. As a first step in deconstructing this problem, I assume that in the context of innovation, the most prepared organizations are those that are stocked with the broadest and deepes...|$|R

I propose that the concept of what ‘dance’ or what a ‘dancer’ is has been renegotiated in this zone of encounter, which I understand as a zone of contestation and re-negotiation.
