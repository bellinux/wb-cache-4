He was deeply engaged in the lives of each of his four children, continuously available to them, showing and explaining art, history, city and country life, philosophy, Roman ruins and medieval and Renaissance efforts to civilize a damaged human history. He enjoyed watching people, engaging them in conversation and showing his children the joy and tragedy of human existence. He laid out for them the philosophic foundations of societies without being idealistic about any of them.|$|E

25|$|In the US, in contrast, landed elites {{were less}} likely to pass on {{fortunes}} to a <b>single</b> <b>child</b> by the action of primogeniture, which meant that as time went by, large estates became broken up within a few generations which, in turn, made the children more equal overall. It was not always a negative development, according to Joshua Kaplan's interpretation of Tocqueville, since bonds of affection and shared experience between children often replaced the more formal relation between the eldest child and the siblings, characteristic of the previous aristocratic pattern. Overall, in the new democracies, hereditary fortunes became exceedingly difficult to secure and more people were forced to struggle for their own living.|$|E
25|$|Heisman met {{his first}} wife, an actress, {{while he was}} at {{participating}} in theater during his time at Clemson. Evelyn McCollum Cox was a widow with a <b>single</b> <b>child,</b> a boy named Carlisle. They got married during the 1903 season. Carlisle was 12 at the time, and he and Heisman would remain close after John and Evelyn had divorced each other. They decided to separate in 1918 when Heisman was coaching at Georgia Tech and he and Evelyn were living in Atlanta. To prevent any social embarrassment to his former wife, who chose to remain in the city, he left Atlanta after the divorce and took the head coaching position at Penn.|$|E
25|$|In 1932, {{the teenage}} Shamshad {{came in contact}} with Ganpat Lal Batto, a Hindu law student who lived in the same {{neighbourhood}} and who was several years older than her.

Their efforts {{were on the verge of}} bearing fruit in 1934 when Ganpat Lal Batto and Shamshad made the decision to marry each other. In 1934, despite strenuous opposition from both their families due to religious differences, 15-year-old Shamshad got married to Ganpat Lal Batto. The couple were blessed with only a <b>single</b> <b>child,</b> a daughter named Usha, who in due course married a Hindu gentleman, Lieutenant Colonel Yogesh Ratra, an officer in the Indian Army.|$|E

500|$|Zoltán is of Hungarian descent. In the mid-1990s, his parents, Mihály and Erzsébet Meskó, {{were highly}} educated {{engineers}} in Romania. The family supplemented its income selling homemade {{clothes in the}} market. [...] His father was also a professional nine-pin bowler. [...] On 8 May 1997, when Zoltán was 11, his family moved from his native Romania after Mihály Meskó won a United States Permanent Resident Card (green card) in the Diversity Immigrant Visa lottery for the <b>single</b> <b>child</b> family {{to move to the}} United States. The Meskós now have jobs that pay well. [...] The family spent the first year and half in New York City before moving to Ohio for better jobs. [...] Zoltán speaks Hungarian, Romanian, German and English and is conversant in Spanish. He learned to speak English by watching television. [...] He was schooled at a German school in Timișoara, which was then Romania's second-largest city. His parents taught him Hungarian and he spoke Romanian with his friends.|$|E
500|$|Although {{science fiction}} heroes have, Porter argues, [...] "grown greyer over time", Jack {{represents}} as of Children of Earth a culmination of this trend, {{resulting in a}} full [...] "devolution/deconstruction of the traditional hero". In Children of Earth, Jack has to sacrifice his own grandson to save the world. Barrowman was concerned that the storyline could have made the character unpopular. He believes however that Jack was given the tough decision on how to save humanity; the actor says [...] "when I read all of the stuff he had to do, I {{had to look at}} it {{from the point of view}} of 'I'm Jack Harkness and I'm right'." [...] For Lynnette Porter, Jack's actions in the serial make him [...] "a benchmark for [...] grey heroes"; some audiences may even view him, in light of his actions, as [...] "villainous or downright monstrous." [...] Although Jack ultimately saves the majority of the world's children and finds a way to foil the monstrous 456, the situation in which he is placed forces him to make a morally difficult (and to some viewers, reprehensible) decision. Such, Porter argues, is the mark of a grey hero. Davies stated in an interview with SFX that he [...] "loved" [...] the uproarious reaction to Jack's actions, defending the character in saying [...] "He saved every <b>single</b> <b>child</b> in the world! If you would fail to do that then you’re the monster, frankly. It’s this extraordinary treatment that only science fiction heroes get." [...] When Jack is departing Earth, the music playing is titled [...] "Redemption", signifying that his departure is also perhaps his redeeming act in the serial.|$|E

Latina contributor Sally Mercedes dubbed the song [...] "one of the most memorable Disney songs ever". [...] "Part of Your World" [...] is also considered Benson's signature song, which she claims she has yet to grow tired of singing. Benson believes that the popularity of the song {{is one of the main}} reasons The Little Mermaid was instrumental in helping revive the animated film genre during the 1990s. HitFix contributor Donna Dickens credits much of the film's success with Benson's performance of the song. Time selected [...] "Part of Your World" [...] as one of the Disney Renaissance's most iconic moments, writing, [...] "If you are a female-identified child of the ‘90s, chances are good that you have belted this song into your hairbrush or showerhead on more than one occasion." [...] Billboards Erin Strecker agreed that [...] "every <b>single</b> <b>child</b> has sung [...] into a hairbrush". MetroLyrics considers [...] "Part of Your World" [...] to be among [...] "21 Disney Songs That Are Still The Soundtrack To Our Lives". Yahoo!

2500|$|As {{the first}} {{generation}} of law-enforced only-children came of age for becoming parents themselves, one adult child was left with having to provide support for his or her two parents and four grandparents. Called the [...] "4-2-1 Problem", this leaves the older generations with increased chances of dependency on retirement funds or charity in order to receive support. If personal savings, pensions, or state welfare fail, most senior citizens would be left entirely dependent upon their very small family or neighbours for assistance. If, for any reason, the <b>single</b> <b>child</b> is unable to care for their older adult relatives, the oldest generations would face a lack of resources and necessities. In response to such an issue, all provinces have decided that couples are allowed to have two children if both parents were only children themselves: By 2007, all provinces in the nation except Henan had adopted this new policy; Henan followed in 2011.|$|E

[...] In fact, Morse refers to an article published in a right-wing journal, the National Review, entitled They Protest Too Much, published on 28 June 2007 in which he quotes John J. Miller as stating, [...] "the magazine's editors and writers aren't interfering with higher education so much as responding to a consumer demand for more information about it. The demand exists because colleges and universities are among the least accountable institutions in American life [...] the U.S. News rankings indisputably measure something—and something is better than nothing, which is why parents of high school students pore over the magazine's tables and charts. This is rational behavior for people on the verge of spending more huge sums of money on the education of a <b>single</b> <b>child.</b> Like wise investors, they want to know if they're getting a good deal." [...] He also refers to the 27 June 2007 Washington Post op-ed, A College Course in Cynicism, in which he quotes Robert Samuelson as stating, [...] "hat's so shameful about this campaign against the rankings is its anti-intellectualism. Much information is in some way incomplete or imperfect. The proper response to evidence that you dislike or dispute is to supplement or discredit it with better evidence. The wrong response is to suppress it. And yet, that's the agenda of these college presidents. By not cooperating with the U.S. News survey, they hope to sabotage the rankings. They say they'll provide superior information. But they want to control what parents and students see. This is soft censorship.What their students will learn, if they're paying attention, is a life lesson in cynicism: how eminent authorities cloak their self-interest in high-sounding, deceptive rhetoric." ...|$|E
