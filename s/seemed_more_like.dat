5|$|Hügel-Marshall {{continued}} {{to study and}} achieved a license in child education and welfare. She then found work in a children's home in Frankfurt am Main, where she worked for twelve years. The home {{reminded her of the}} degrading orphanage she had been sent to and <b>seemed</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a detention center than a school. Working with the other teachers, and over the opposition of the school's management, she was able to make substantial changes and to modernize it during her time there. While working there, she completed a degree in social work and pedagogy.|$|E
500|$|Although {{it did not}} {{directly}} impact the ongoing storyline of Awake, [...] "Nightswimming" [...] introduced and continued key thematic elements of the series. It {{was described as a}} [...] "long, roundabout" [...] episode that is [...] "bent on making [...] fully commit to moving to Oregon with Hannah" [...] by Matt Fowler from IGN. Fowler thought that, since Rex was not in the episode, the [...] "green reality" [...] <b>seemed</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a dream. In a review of the following episode, [...] "Game Day", he admitted that he thought Alina was behind Marcus' car bomb, since he thought that this story would have an arrest by the end. Writing for HitFix, Alan Sepinwall opined that Michael is [...] "coming to grips with Hannah's desire to move because he loves her that much". However, the Brittens later decided not to move in [...] "Slack Water", the series' tenth episode, owing to personal concerns.|$|E
500|$|Recalling {{the release}} of Sgt. Pepper in his 1977 book The Beatles Forever, Nicholas Schaffner wrote that [...] "Nothing quite like 'A Day In The Life' had been {{attempted}} before in so-called popular music" [...] {{in terms of the}} song's [...] "use of dynamics and tricks of rhythm, and of space and stereo effect, and its deft intermingling of scenes from dream, reality, and shades in between". Schaffner said that in the context of 1967, the track [...] "was so visually evocative it <b>seemed</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a film than a mere song". Richard Goldstein of The New York Times called the song [...] "a deadly earnest excursion in emotive music with a chilling lyric... stands {{as one of the most}} important Lennon-McCartney compositions… [...] an historic Pop event". In a contemporary music critics' poll published by Jazz & Pop magazine, [...] "A Day in the Life" [...] won in the categories of Best Pop Song and Best Pop Arrangement.|$|E

500|$|According to Paul Wagenbreth of The News-Gazette, the novel's {{fundamental}} {{weakness is}} that after the slow buildup, [...] "there is a final shying away from a full rendering {{of the nature of}} the beast....there's a curious holding back here as elsewhere from a really probing look at the seductive appeal of vampirism, particularly the sensuality at its core." [...] Susanna Sturgis, agreed, writing in the Women's Review of Books that the plot dragged and that [...] "the reader loses interest" [...] in the core mysteries of the novel. Ong Sor Fern of The Straits Times criticized Kostova's portrayal of women, writing that her unnamed female narrator [...] "feels even more drab and colourless than Stoker's idealised female, Mina Harker". Sturgis criticized Kostova's characterization in general, contending that the major characters <b>seemed</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> [...] "disembodied tour guides". Polly Shulman of Newsday also argued that the book [...] "fail to grapple with its supposed themes: evil, death and history". She saw [...] "little of the terror of these periods" [...] in the novel and little of the tension between the Islamic East and the Christian West.|$|E
500|$|The tour {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Gene Stout of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer {{called it a}} [...] "throbbing, special-effects extravaganza". Aline Mendelsohn of The Orlando Sentinel noted influence from Janet Jackson in the show's choreography and [...] suggestive themes, which had attracted many headlines due to the [...] "heightened sensitivity of the post-Janet Jackson era." [...] MTV UK highlighted the comparisons with early Madonna tours such as The Girlie Show World Tour and added that [...] " [...] is a theatrical extravaganza, complete with camp compere, sexy dancers, glitzy costumes and extravagant set pieces and its all fabulously raunchy". [...] Bill Dean of The Ledger reported that the tour was [...] "big sloppy and sex-filled". He also added, [...] "Her presence remains captivating. [...] Perhaps even subsconsciously, the Onyx tour's most significant role may be foretelling a future in Broadway or film musicals". Neil Strauss of The New York Times claimed [...] "her show was more a theater-and-dance spectacle than an actual concert, with the staging equal parts [...] and the redeveloped Times Square. [...] At times the show <b>seemed</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a Las Vegas tribute to Ms. Spears than a concert by Ms. Spears herself".|$|E
500|$|When South Pacific {{opened in}} London in November 1951, the reviews were mixed. [...] London's Daily Express praised the music but disliked other {{elements}} of that show, writing, [...] "We got a 42nd Street Madame Butterfly, the weakest of all the Hammerstein-Rodgers musicals. The Daily Mail suggested, [...] "The play moved so slowly between its songs that it <b>seemed</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> South Soporific." [...] The Times applauded the songs but indicated that [...] "before the end the singing and the dancing have dwindled to almost nothing, while the rather sad little tale is slowly and conventionally wound up." [...] The Manchester Guardian, however, noted the anticipation {{in advance of the}} opening and concluded that [...] "there was no disappointment... the show bounces the audience and well deserves the cheers." [...] Drama critic Kenneth Tynan of The Spectator wrote that South Pacific was [...] "the first musical romance which was seriously involved in an adult subject... I have nothing to do but thank Logan, Rodgers and Hammerstein and climb up from my knees, a little cramped from the effort of typing in such an unusual position." ...|$|E

500|$|Ash was {{designed}} as an [...] "attractive evil character", in contrast to previous King of Fighters heroes. The supervising designer created the character as desired, with few changes since conception. When The King of Fighters 2003 was released and Ash introduced, the staff {{did not want to}} disclose information about him, instead telling fans to look forward to his [...] "exploits." [...] His canonical height is 178cm (5'10") and he weighs 59kg (130 lbs). According to a staff member, Falcoon, the goal was to make Ash an ambiguous protagonist who made players [...] "feel bad" [...] for cheering for him. Although Falcoon did not design the character, he added details while illustrating him. Due to Ash's late appearance in The King of Fighters 2003, the staff joked that teammate Shen Woo <b>seemed</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> the series' main character than Ash did. For The King of Fighters XIII, producer Kei Yamamoto wanted gamers who had played previous titles with Ash to consider the character's motivation and whether they could relate to him. One of three reasons for the title of KOF: Maximum Impact 2 Regulation [...] "A" [...] was Ash's introduction to the spin-off series. [...] Falcoon called the character [...] "really wild" [...] because of his role in the series and his personality. Nona (another artist in charge) said that of the original King of Fighters characters, he liked Ash and looked forward to his development.|$|E
500|$|Kaze of Beneath The Tangles, however, {{disagreed}} with these interpretations of koi {{and the notion}} that the story was a [...] "bittersweet romance" [...] or [...] "another love story", and instead felt that the theme was unrecognized. Focusing instead on the human need for companionship and understanding, Kaze noted that both Takao and Yukari lacked meaningful connections with their peers and friends, a view shared by reviewer Bradly Storm at Hardcore Gamer. Together through their conversations—in their [...] "garden of words"—they found companionship: Takao finding someone he can share his passion with, and Yukari finding someone who treats her as a person. However, because of the age difference, this discovery varied between the characters. For Yukari, an older and more experienced individual, her hopeless feelings of lonely sadness disappeared when she learned she could connect with Takao, a revelation that she saw as her salvation. For Takao, a boy with an unsupportive family and friends who <b>seemed</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> acquaintances, he did not realize his lack of companionship until he discovered it with Yukari, a new feeling he mistook for romantic love but only realized its true nature after she had moved away. According to Kaze, [...] "romantic love could potentially bloom from such feelings, but that is not what the story is about". Instead, the love they shared was more basic, making the age difference immaterial. At the end of film, both characters maintained their friendship through letters, but otherwise began growing as people by moving on with their lives and presumably finding new relationships with other people. The hope was that one day they could reunite and renew their companionship [...] "without needing to cling to each other". However, neither could [...] "learn to walk again" [...] if they continued to isolate themselves {{from the rest of the}} world and take shelter with each other in the garden at Shinjuku Gyoen.|$|E
2500|$|American Democrats {{labeled the}} warning [...] "suspicious". Dismissing the threat, they {{claimed it was}} solely to divert {{attention}} from President Bush's plummeting poll numbers and to push the failings of the Invasion of Iraq off the front page. CSIS director Reid Morden voiced similar concerns, saying it <b>seemed</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> [...] "election year" [...] politics, than an actual threat—and The New York Times pointed out that one day before the announcement, they had been told by the Department of Homeland Security that there were no current risks.|$|E

2500|$|Balanchine {{continued}} to cast Tallchief in important roles. In Danses Concertantes, {{she was part}} of a jazzy pas de trois created for Mary Ellen Moylan, Nicholas Magallanes, and herself. The steps were classical in form, but they were presented in a unique manner. [...] "The accent was sharp, the rhythm swinging and modern", she wrote. [...] "Performing the steps <b>seemed</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> an exercise for pleasure and enjoyment than work. It was magical." [...] In Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme, she had a pas de deux with Yurek Lazowsky.|$|E

He has said that at that time it <b>seemed</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a [...] "chore" [...] than for entertainment. He was a standout player in the Denver music scene from 1988 on in bands Grey Haven, Industrial Eden (guitarist/lead vocalist) and Killing Time.|$|E
2500|$|The Italian Girolamo Benzoni in {{his book}} La Historia del Mondo Nuovo (1565) wrote that [...] "...chocolate <b>seemed</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a drink for pigs than a drink to be {{consumed}} by humans," [...] noting {{that he had never}} tasted it despite residing there for over a year. José de Acosta also disparaged the drink, comparing the frothy foam capping chocolate to feces. Despite these caveats, Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo characterised it as an interesting ingredient, while showing some reluctance to describe how some Indians, after drinking it, had stained their lips as if they had ingested human blood.|$|E

2500|$|John J. Puccio of DVDTown.com felt Night of the Lepus {{would have}} been better had it been an {{intentionally}} humorous horror spoof, rather than a legitimate attempt at making a horror film with killer rabbits. Stating that it was in the [...] "so-bad-it's-good" [...] category for only two minutes, he found the actors to be [...] "stiff and uninvolved" [...] in delivering their lines, and that it <b>seemed</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> an [...] "old television horse opera" [...] than a horror film with more slow-paced filler than action sequences, and the few bits of action ruined by the [...] "corniest possible 'action' music". AMC Film Critic's Christopher Null states that it is famous as [...] "one of the worst films ever made". He heavily criticizes Claxton, feeling that he [...] "just seems wholly incapable of making the movie remotely frightening, or even of making much sense" [...] and that the bad special effects [...] "make the entire film a huge joke". Reviewing the title for Classic-Horror.com, Julia Merriam gave Night of the Lepus credit for attempting to be a [...] "socially-conscious eco-horror", but criticized the slow pacing, bad dialog, poor editing with a heavy reliance on stock footage that {{did not appear to be}} from the same film, and senseless character actions such as entering a rabbit-filled cave just to photograph them. She also criticized the film's obvious use of people in rabbit suits, but concluded its biggest flaw was that [...] "fluffy bunnies just aren't scary".|$|E
