25|$|Superior {{and much}} more {{expensive}} {{is the use of}} interference contrast. Differences in optical density will <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>as</b> differences in relief. A nucleus within a cell will actually <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>as</b> a globule in the most often used differential interference contrast system according to Georges Nomarski. However, it has to be kept in mind that this is an optical effect, and the relief does not necessarily resemble the true shape. Contrast is very good and the condenser aperture can be used fully open, thereby reducing the depth of field and maximizing resolution.|$|E

25|$|The {{concentric}} hemispherical analyser (CHA) is {{a typical}} electron energy analyzer, and uses an electric field to change the directions of incident electrons, depending on their kinetic energies.

25|$|In SPS patients, {{motor unit}} neurons fire involuntarily {{in a way}} that resembles a normal contraction. Motor unit {{potentials}} fire while the patient is at rest, particularly in the stiff muscles. The excessive firing of motor neurons may be caused by malfunctions in spinal and supra-segmental inhibitory networks that utilize GABA. Involuntary actions <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>as</b> voluntary on EMG scans; even when the patient tries to relax, there are agonist and antagonist contractions.|$|E
25|$|Autumn nears, and Tyler hears {{that the}} caribou are {{migrating}} south, which {{will provide an}} opportunity for him to study the concept his superiors want to confirm. Ootek takes Tyler on a two-day hike to where the caribou will be. The caribou <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>as</b> predicted and Tyler observes the wolves make several unsuccessful attacks. Tyler helps drive caribou towards the pack, which soon takes one down. Tyler takes a bone and samples the marrow, discovering the dead caribou to be diseased. It confirms that the wolves are not ruthless killers but rather their predation kills off only the weaker caribou.|$|E
25|$|By the American Revolutionary War, {{the colonial}} Province of New York was still small and {{relatively}} sparsely populated. In the 1790 United States Census, {{the state had}} a population of 340,120, placing it behind Virginia (747,610), Pennsylvania (434,373), Massachusetts (378,787). The state grew rapidly after this as New York City grew to become the country's shipping epicenter. On October 24, 1825, the Erie Canal opened {{and over the next}} century would make boom towns out of the Upstate cities of Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse, Rome, Utica and Schenectady. Use of the canal would only decline after 1950. Cities in New York State would frequently <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>as</b> amongst the largest in the United States during the 19th, and into the early 20th century.|$|E

25|$|Most infections with {{adenovirus}} {{result in}} infections {{of the upper}} respiratory tract. Adenovirus infections often <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>as</b> conjunctivitis, tonsilitis (which may look exactly like strep throat and cannot be distinguished from strep except by throat culture), an ear infection, or croup. Adenoviruses, types 40 and 41 can also cause gastroenteritis. A combination of conjunctivitis and tonsilitis is particularly common with adenovirus infections. Some children (especially small ones) can develop adenovirus bronchiolitis or pneumonia, both {{of which can be}} severe. In babies, adenoviruses can also cause coughing fits that look almost exactly like whooping cough. Adenoviruses can also cause viral meningitis or encephalitis. Rarely, adenovirus can cause hemorrhagic cystitis (inflammation of the urinary bladder—a form of urinary tract infection — with blood in the urine).|$|E
25|$|Under normal circumstances, a tiny {{amount of}} urobilinogen, if any, is {{excreted}} in the urine. If the liver's function is impaired or when biliary drainage is blocked, {{some of the}} conjugated bilirubin leaks out of the hepatocytes and appears in the urine, turning it dark amber. However, in disorders involving hemolytic anemia, an increased number of red blood cells are broken down, causing {{an increase in the}} amount of unconjugated bilirubin in the blood. Because the unconjugated bilirubin is not water-soluble, one will not see an increase in bilirubin in the urine. Because there is no problem with the liver or bile systems, this excess unconjugated bilirubin will go through all of the normal processing mechanisms that occur (e.g., conjugation, excretion in bile, metabolism to urobilinogen, reabsorption) and will <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>as</b> an increase in urine urobilinogen. This difference between increased urine bilirubin and increased urine urobilinogen helps to distinguish between various disorders in those systems.|$|E
25|$|A simple {{error model}} is to {{introduce}} a small error to the data probability term in the homozygous cases, allowing a small constant probability that nucleotides which don't match the A allele are observed in the AA case, and respectively a small constant probability that nucleotides not matching the B allele are observed in the BB case. However more sophisticated procedures are available which attempt to more realistically replicate the actual error patterns observed in real data in calculating the conditional data probabilities. For instance, estimations of read quality (measured as Phred quality scores) have been incorporated in these calculations, {{taking into account the}} expected error rate in each individual read at a locus. Another technique that has successfully been incorporated into error models is base quality recalibration, where separate error rates are calculated - based on prior known information about error patterns - for each possible nucleotide substitution. Research shows that each possible nucleotide substitution is not equally likely to <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>as</b> an error in sequencing data, and so base quality recalibration has been applied to improve error probability estimates.|$|E

25|$|The {{rufous-naped lark}} {{is a fairly}} large and robust lark species, with rather heavy flight. The sexes are similar, but males average larger and heavier. Adults are {{individually}} and geographically variable. It measures 15–18cm from bill tip to tail tip and weighs 40-44g. The streaked upper parts, short erectile crest, creamy-buff eyebrow that merges with the lore, and the rufous flight feathers are easily discernible features. The hindcrown and nape are streaked along the feather centers while the margins vary from chestnut, rufous or pinkish buff to greyish brown. The wings appear conspicuously rufous in flight, while the outer edges of the primaries <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>as</b> a rufous panel on the closed wing. The underwing coverts are rufous, and upper coverts are broadly edged tawny or buff (or grey in race grisescens). The tail is dark brown, but the outer webs of the outer tail feathers vary from buff (cf. africana and sharpii) to tawny or bright rufous. The mantle is lighter brown than the back, and the rump still darker brown. The flanks are a shade darker than the rufous-buff belly, but regionally the plumage may also be stained red by soil. The throat is unmarked but the pale rufous upper breast is streaked and spotted darker brown. The eyes are hazel brown, the longish bill is blackish and pinkish, and the feet pink to pinkish brown. Juveniles have bold black spotting on the crown, mantle and wing coverts, all edged with buff, while the breast spotting is more blotchy or diffuse.|$|E

500|$|Damage to the {{cerebellum}} often causes motor-related symptoms, {{the details}} of which depend {{on the part of}} the cerebellum involved and how it is damaged. Damage to the [...] flocculonodular lobe may <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>as</b> a loss of equilibrium and in particular an altered, irregular walking gait, with a wide stance caused by difficulty in balancing. Damage to the lateral zone typically causes problems in skilled voluntary and planned movements which can cause errors in the force, direction, speed and amplitude of movements. Other manifestations include hypotonia (decreased muscle tone), dysarthria (problems with speech articulation), dysmetria (problems judging distances or ranges of movement), dysdiadochokinesia (inability to perform rapid alternating movements such as walking), impaired check reflex or rebound phenomenon, and intention tremor (involuntary movement caused by alternating contractions of opposing muscle groups). Damage to the midline portion may disrupt whole-body movements, whereas damage localized more laterally is more likely to disrupt fine movements of the hands or limbs. Damage to the upper part of the cerebellum tends to cause gait impairments and other problems with leg coordination; damage to the lower part is more likely to cause uncoordinated or poorly aimed movements of the arms and hands, as well as difficulties in speed. This complex of motor symptoms is called ataxia.|$|E

Barnert noted that Burton is [...] "someone who has made his allegiance to Phelps clear" [...] which is why [...] "many fans" [...] had expected him to show up in Genoa City [...] "eventually". TV Guides Michael Logan had also weighed in on the rumors, calling Burton's [...] "willingness" [...] to work in Los Angeles after leaving General Hospital to live in Nashville a [...] "puzzler". Logan suggested that there could have been more to his decision to quit General Hospital. Stephen Nichols, who had portrayed Tucker McCall on The Young and the Restless for over three years, was fired that December. Logan said Phelps, who was [...] "under orders" [...] to trim the show's budget, may have fired Nichols in order to afford Burton in lieu of him.|$|E
