5|$|Development of MediEvil {{begun in}} late 1995 at {{independent}} developer Millennium Interactive in Cambridge. Chris Sorrell, previously {{known for the}} James Pond series of games, created the original concept for MediEvil and served as the game's creative director. Sorrell joined Millennium, {{with whom he had}} been working with for a while, after completing James Pond 3. When asked what he wanted to do, {{he said he wanted to}} work with <b>someone</b> <b>on</b> the visual side. Jason Wilson, who would be the designer and a writer for the game, met up with Sorrell and began working on MediEvil.|$|E

5|$|The lobby guard {{returned}} {{a call to}} the alarm monitoring service, which had called when the alarm initially went off to confirm that there was a fire, but never called the Philadelphia Fire Department. The first call came from <b>someone</b> <b>on</b> the street who saw smoke coming from the building. During the first 911 call, at about 8:27 PM, the alarm company alerted the fire department to the fire. Engine 43 was the first firefighting unit to arrive at the scene and reported seeing heavy smoke and flames in one of the windows. As firefighters started fighting the fire it had grown with flames breaking through windows and lapping {{up the side of the}} building.|$|E

5|$|WASP-13 is a sunlike, G-type {{star that}} is {{situated}} approximately 156 parsecs (509 light years) in the Lynx constellation. With an apparent magnitude of 10.42, the star cannot {{be seen with}} the unaided eye from the perspective of <b>someone</b> <b>on</b> Earth. The star's effective temperature, at 5826 K, is hotter than that of the Sun. However, its metallicity is similar; this can be seen in how the concentration of iron, or , is approximately 0. WASP-13's surface gravity is measured at 4.04 km/s2, while the rate at which it rotates is at most 4.9 km/s.|$|E
5|$|In 1927, Beebe went on an {{expedition}} to Haiti in order to document its marine life. Anchoring his ship the Lieutenant in the harbor of Port-au-Prince, he performed over 300 helmet dives examining the area's coral reefs and classifying the fish that inhabited them. These dives involved several technological innovations: a watertight brass box {{which could be used}} to house a camera for underwater photography, and a telephone which was incorporated into the diving helmet, allowing the diver to dictate observations to <b>someone</b> <b>on</b> the surface instead of having to take notes underwater. Within a hundred days, Beebe and his team had created a catalog of species inhabiting the area nearly as long as what had been assembled on the neighboring island of Puerto Rico in the past four hundred years. In 1928 Beebe and Tee-Van published an illustrated and annotated list of 270 such species, which was expanded in 1935 bringing the total to 324. Beebe provided an account of this expedition in his 1928 book Beneath Tropic Seas, which was the first of his books to receive less than enthusiastic reviews, due to its episodic structure.|$|E
5|$|In addition, at {{some time}} between {{the date of the}} writ of {{election}} and 12:00 noon on nomination day, the potential candidate or <b>someone</b> <b>on</b> his or her behalf must hand to the returning officer a deposit amounting to three times of 8% of the total allowances payable to an MP in the preceding calendar year, rounded to the nearest $500. At the 2017 presidential election, the deposit was $43,500. The deposit is returned if the person is not nominated as a candidate, withdraws his or her candidature, or is eventually elected. If the candidate is unsuccessful at the election, the deposit is only repaid if he or she polled more than one-eighth {{of the total number of}} votes polled, not including rejected votes.|$|E

5000|$|The {{origins of}} the term remain obscure. Researchers in the 1960s used the term [...] "open marriage" [...] to {{describe}} individual freedom in choosing marriage partners.

50|$|In all Chinese {{speaking}} societies, if <b>someone</b> commented <b>on</b> <b>someone's</b> {{words as}} having the weight of nine tripod cauldrons (一言九鼎), {{this was a great}} compliment to the person. It meant that the person was very trustworthy and would never break their promises.|$|R
5|$|Tribunes {{could use}} their sacrosanctity {{to order the}} use of capital {{punishment}} against any person who interfered with their duties. Tribunes could also use their sacrosanctity as protection when physically manhandling an individual, such as when arresting <b>someone.</b> <b>On</b> a couple of rare occasions (such as during the tribunate of Tiberius Gracchus), a tribune might use a form of blanket obstruction, which could involve a broad veto over all governmental functions. While a tribune could veto any act of the senate, the assemblies, or the magistrates, he could only veto the act, and not the actual measure. Therefore, he had to physically be present when the act was occurring. As soon as that tribune was no longer present, the act could be completed as if {{there had never been}} a veto.|$|E

Since the morphology of Ojibwe has no case distinctions (an Ojibwe nominal phrase {{does not change}} when its relations to the other sentence constituents change), {{the only way to}} distinguish subject from object in a transitive verb with two participants is through direct-inverse suffixes.

It proved useful, nevertheless, in that transports and supply vessels could use it, so that Pope did not have to depend on land communications.|$|E
25|$|An autopsy {{found that}} the man had died of foul play, {{remarking}} something initially puzzling: ice crystals in blood vessels near his heart. His interior organs also had decayed at a rate far slower than his skin. Pathologists concluded that someone had frozen his body after death in an attempt to mislead investigators into believing he died at a later time than he actually did. The man was identified as <b>someone</b> <b>on</b> the periphery of Mafia activities in nearby Rockland County, New York.|$|E
25|$|In many {{healthcare}} systems, prolonged ventilation as part {{of intensive}} care is a limited resource (in {{that there are only}} so many patients that can receive care at any given moment). It is used to support a single failing organ system (the lungs) and cannot reverse any underlying disease process (such as terminal cancer). For this reason, there can be (occasionally difficult) decisions to be made about whether it is suitable to commence <b>someone</b> <b>on</b> mechanical ventilation. Equally many ethical issues surround the decision to discontinue mechanical ventilation.|$|E

25|$|The {{pilgrimage to}} Mecca is less costly and arduous for the Sudanese {{than it is}} for many Muslims.

Some have joined pilgrimage societies into which members pay a small amount monthly and choose one of their number when sufficient funds have accumulated to send <b>someone</b> <b>on</b> the pilgrimage.
