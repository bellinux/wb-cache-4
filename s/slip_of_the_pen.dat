Types of performance errors that will be of focus here are those that involve errors in syntax, other types of errors can occur in the phonological, semantic features of words, for further information see speech errors.

The presumption {{would be that the}} Queen spoke of Amy's death FOUR DAYS BEFORE IT OCCURRED, and a very awkward position, in that case, would be the Queen's. Guilty foreknowledge would be attributed to her. This is like the real situation if Dr. Ernst Bekker is right.* Dr. Bekker, knowing from the portion of de Quadra's letter omitted by Mr. Froude, that he reached the Court at Windsor on September 6, 1560, supposes that he had interviews with Elizabeth and Cecil on that day, and that Elizabeth, prematurely, announced to him Amy's death, next day, on September 7.

Another corpse had a plain gold breastplate with the nipples indicated.

The neural arch above the centrum, and containing the spinal cord, is made up of neural plates (n.p.), and interneural plates (i.n.p.), completed above by a median neural spine (n.s.). In the caudal region, instead of ribs projecting outwardly, there are haemal processes, inclined downwards and meeting below, forming an arch, the haemal arch, containing the caudal artery and vein-- the vein ventral to the artery-- and resembling the neural arch, which contains the spinal cord above, in shape and size.|$|E
40|$|This manual {{addresses}} the linguistic issues {{that arise in}} connection with annotating texts by part of speech (2 ̆ 2 tagging 2 ̆ 2). Section 2 is an alphabetical list <b>of</b> <b>the</b> parts <b>of</b> speech encoded in <b>the</b> annotation systems <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Penn Treebank Project, along with their corresponding abbreviations (2 ̆ 2 tags 2 ̆ 2) and some information concerning their definition. This section allows you to find an unfamiliar tag by looking up a familiar part of speech. Section 3 recapitulates the information in Section 2, {{but this time the}} information is alphabetically ordered by tags. This is the section to consult in order to find out what an unfamiliar tag means. Since <b>the</b> parts <b>of</b> speech are probably familiar to you from high school English, you should have little difficulty in assimilating the tags themselves. However, it is often quite difficult to decide which tag is appropriate in a particular context. The two sections 4 and 5 therefore include examples and guidelines on how to tag problematic cases. If you are uncertain about whether a given tag is correct or not, refer to these sections in order to ensure a consistently annotated text. Section 4 discusses parts of speech that are easily confused and gives guidelines on how to tag such cases, while Section 5 contains an alphabetical list of specific problematic words and collocations. Finally, Section 6 discusses some general tagging conventions. One general rule, however, is so important that we state it here. Many texts are not models of good prose, and some contain outright errors and <b>slips</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pen.</b> Do not be tempted to correct a tag to what it would be if the text were correct; rather, it is the incorrect word that should be tagged correctly...|$|R
40|$|One {{object of}} documenting {{languages}} {{is to make}} their data available not only to oneself, but to speakers and nonspeakers who have no direct access {{because they are in}} different places or in later epochs <b>of</b> time. <b>The</b> enabling event in collecting data is the capture in written form, by native speakers or linguists, of a suitable quantity <b>of</b> utterances in <b>the</b> language whose meaning is approximated by translation into a world language. Getting this material together is an inherently messy process, however much we idealize crisp audio recordings and well transcribed and annotated text files, with or without an analysis. No matter how astute the language consultant or how gifted the linguist, initial transcriptions are inevitably sprinkled with skips, mishearings, on-the-spot editing, <b>slips</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pen</b> or <b>the</b> keyboard, initial stabs at translation that miss <b>the</b> point, interference <b>of</b> discourse patterns between spoken and written media – even when the recording is fresh and the language consultant is doing the work. This is the reason many linguists find it makes their final archivable reporting more accurate to go through a phase of making notes on paper, going back and reconsidering everything, reannotating it until they and their consultants are collectively satisfied that they've got it. And those records can be a source of insight to later scholars if they are in a form that can be preserved. Recently I had occasion to revisit data collected in field work decades ago, before practical archiving standards for language were worked out and more stable media came on the scene. The paper phase, especially the mundane realities that go along with paper, ink, and storage, stood out as a necessary prerequisite to being able to do anything at all with the data.
