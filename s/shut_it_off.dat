According to several Armenian witnesses and Soviet military personnel, alcohol and anasha, a term referring to narcotics, were brought in trucks and distributed to the crowds, although such accounts were not unreported in the media. According to de Waal, notes that the attackers were armed with homemade weapons that would have taken some time and effort to manufacture, suggesting a certain level of planning.|$|E
500|$|The most {{commonly}} used cylinder valve type is the single outlet plain valve, sometimes known as a [...] "K" [...] valve, which allows connection of a single regulator, and has no reserve function. It simply opens to allow gas flow, or closes to <b>shut</b> <b>it</b> <b>off.</b> Several configurations are used, with options of DIN or A-clamp connection, and vertical or transverse spindle arrangements. The valve is operated by turning a knob, usually rubber or plastic, which affords a comfortable grip. Several turns are required to fully open the valves. Some DIN valves are convertible to A-clamp by use of an insert which is screwed into the opening.|$|E
500|$|The heavy {{rainfall}} resulted in flash flooding throughout several areas. On Oahu, roads and some structures were flooded, and minor landslides were reported. On the island, telephone and electrical service were disrupted.

Small stream and drainage ditch flooding {{was reported in the}} Kau District of Hawaii. Excessive runoff around Kailua-Kona resulted in extensive flooding that forced the closure of five schools, submerged several roads, and triggered rockslides. Due to high water, several roads, including part of the Piilani Highway on Maui, were temporarily shut down. A portion of the Kamehameha Highway was also closed after being submerged under waters of up to [...] deep. Despite the flooding, neither Darby nor its remnant moisture caused any casualties or severe property damage.|$|E

500|$|While {{the film}} portrays Andy {{escaping}} to freedom through a sewer pipe {{described as a}} [...] "river of shit," [...] Robbins crawls through a mixture of water, chocolate syrup, and sawdust. The stream into which Robbins emerges was actually certified toxic by a chemist according to production designer Terence Marsh. Of the scene, Robbins said, [...] "when you're doing a film, {{you want to be}} a good soldier—you don't want to be the one that gets in the way. So you will do things as an actor that are compromising to your physical health and safety." [...] As for the scene were Andy rebelliously plays music over the prison announcement system, it was Robbins' idea for Andy to turn the music up and not <b>shut</b> <b>it</b> <b>off.</b> While in the finished film the inmates watch Rita Hayworth in Gilda (1946), they were originally intended to be watching Billy Wilder's The Lost Weekend (1945), a film about the dangers of alcohol.

2500|$|The {{failure of}} Galileo high-gain antenna meant that data storage {{to the tape}} {{recorder}} for later compression and playback was absolutely crucial {{in order to obtain}} any substantial information from the flybys of Jupiter and its moons. In October 1995, Galileo four-track, 114-megabyte digital tape recorder, which was manufactured by Odetics Corporation, remained stuck in rewind mode for 15 hours before engineers learned what had happened and sent commands to <b>shut</b> <b>it</b> <b>off.</b> Though the recorder itself was still in working order, the malfunction possibly damaged a length of tape {{at the end of the}} reel. This section of tape was subsequently declared [...] "off limits" [...] to any future data recording, and was covered with 25 more turns of tape to secure the section and reduce any further stresses, which could tear it. Because it happened only weeks before Galileo entered orbit around Jupiter, the anomaly prompted engineers to sacrifice data acquisition of almost all of the Io and Europa observations during the orbit insertion phase, in order to focus solely on recording data sent from the Jupiter probe descent.|$|E
