40|$|Purpose: Although {{personnel}} costs significantly affect cancer health care expenditures, {{little is known}} about the relationship between workload, human resource requirements, and associ-ated costs. An empirical model to forecast staffing demand is described according to the yearly caseload of outpatients with cancer beginning active treatment and the number of personnel working hours. Methods: The oncology department at the University Hospital of Udine (Udine, Italy) is a computerized unit taking care of ap-proximately 1, 300 patients per year. Each clinical episode is centrally recorded. We queried the database for the total number of consultations per patient beginning treatment during 2006. With predefined bonds (ie, time limit set for each visit type and annual working hours per employee), we sought to estimate yearly per-patient hours of care and the number of personnel needed. Results: In 2006, each outpatient with cancer beginning active treatment generated an average of 16 clinical evaluations, which in turn translated into 8 and 16 hours of physician and nurse working time, respectively. Assuming an average of 1, 672 annual working hours, a need for one physician and three nurses for every 600 patients could be estimated for every 200 novel pa-tients. In the next year, the same caseload induced 4. 5 consul-tations on average; using a similar approach, the demand for additional time and resources was calculated. Conclusion: Bymeans of a simplemodel combining predefined conditions with a centralized record of clinical episodes, we were able to provide a reasonable estimate of human resource require-ments and a tool to forecast the <b>staff</b> <b>expenditures</b> of a cancer unit...|$|E

Facility-specific costs of expanded HIV testing and care for newly identified patients, however, are less well defined. To aid in resource allocation decisions, we developed a spreadsheet-based budget-impact tool populated with estimates of facility-specific HIV testing and care costs incurred with an expanded testing program. MethodsWe modeled intervention effects on quarterly costs of antiretroviral therapy (ART), outpatient resource utilization, and <b>staff</b> <b>expenditures</b> in the Department of Veterans Affairs over a 2 -year period of increasing HIV testing rates. We used HIV prevalence estimates, screening rates, counseling, positive tests, Veterans Affairs treatment, and published sources as inputs. We evaluated a single-facility cohort of 20, 000 patients and at baseline assumed a serodiagnostic rate of 0. 45 %. ResultsExpanding testing from 2 % to 15 % annually identified 21 additional HIV-positive patients over 2 years {{at a cost of}} approximately $ 290, 000, more than 60 % of which was due to providing ART to newly diagnosed patients. While quarterly testing costs decreased longitudinally as fewer persons required testing, quarterly ART costs increased from $ 10, 000 to more than $ 60, 000 over 2 years as more infected patients were identified and started on ART. In sensitivity analyses, serodiagnostic and annual HIV testing rates had the greatest cost impact. ConclusionsExpanded HIV testing costs are greatest during initial implementation and predominantly due to ART for new patients. Cost determinations of expanded HIV testing provide an important tool for managers charged with allocating resources within integrated systems providing both HIV testing and care...|$|E
50|$|Fig 1. {{shows the}} {{various levels of}} utility (U1, U2, U3) derived by the manager by {{combining}} different amounts of discretionary profits and <b>staff</b> <b>expenditure.</b> Higher the indifference curve, higher {{is the level of}} utility derived by the manager. Hence the manager would try to be on the highest level of indifference curve possible given the constraints. <b>Staff</b> <b>expenditure</b> is plotted on the x-axis and discretionary profits on the y-axis.|$|R
50|$|The {{discretionary}} {{profit in}} this simplified model {{is equal to}} the discretionary investment. The indifference curves are downward sloping and convex to the origin. This shows diminishing marginal rate of substitution of <b>staff</b> <b>expenditure</b> for discretionary profits. The curves are asymptotic in nature which implies that at any point of time and under any given circumstance the manager will choose positive amounts of both discretionary profits and <b>staff</b> <b>expenditure.</b>|$|R
50|$|To {{find the}} {{equilibrium}} in the model, Fig 1. is superimposed on Fig 2. The equilibrium {{point is the}} point where the discretionary profit curve is tangent to the highest possible indifference curve of the manager, which is point E in Fig 3. Staying at the highest profit point would require the manager to be at a lower indifference curve U2. In this case the highest attainable level of utility is U3. At equilibrium, the level of profits would be lower but <b>staff</b> <b>expenditure</b> S* is higher than the <b>staff</b> <b>expenditure</b> made at the maximum profit point. As indifference curve is downward sloping, the equilibrium point would always be on the right of the maximum profit point. Thus the model shows the higher preference of managers for <b>staff</b> <b>expenditure</b> as compared to the discretionary investments.|$|R

40|$|Several {{studies of}} health system {{responsiveness}} {{focus on the}} demand-side by investigating the association between socio-demographic characteristics of patients and their reported level of responsiveness.

The analysis is carried out by adopting a two-step procedure. First, we use patients' self-reported data to derive five measures of responsiveness at the hospital-specialty level. By estimating a generalised ordered probit model, we are able to correct for variations in individual reporting behaviour due to the health status of patients and their experience of being in pain. Secondly, we run cross-sectional regressions in order to investigate the association between patients' responsiveness and potential supply-side drivers, including waiting times, staff workload, the level of spending on non-clinical facilities, the level of spending on staff education and training, and the proportion of <b>staff</b> <b>expenditure</b> between nursing and administrative staff.
