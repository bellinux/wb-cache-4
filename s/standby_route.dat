50|$|Assume {{a failure}} free state for a path from a node B to a node A. Node B bridges the signal destined to A from other nodes on the ring, both on working and {{protecting}} routes. At node A, signals {{from these two}} routes are continuously monitored for path layer defects and the better quality signal is selected.Now consider a failure state where fiber between node A and node B is cut. The selector switches traffic on the <b>standby</b> <b>route</b> when the active route between node A and node B is failed.|$|E
50|$|The {{data circuit}} known with a DP designation, {{would have been}} {{terrestrial}} with no TASI or DCME, and the C6 signalling on the data link could perform for 48 or 96 traffic channels. It could function for up to 2,048 in the maximum. The question is whether two operators would have that many traffic channels between them, dependent on just one bearer for signalling and subject to occasional failure. It was of course practice to have <b>standby</b> <b>route</b> over a diverse path in case of outage on the original DP data circuit link.|$|E
40|$|AbstractFocusing on the {{requirement}} {{the validity of}} <b>standby</b> <b>route</b> under high speed movement scene of wireless sensor network, an optimized AOMDV routing protocol based on self-adaptive node speed (ANS-AOMDV) is proposed. In ANS-AOMDV, the update rule based on self-adaptive node speed is also adopted for <b>standby</b> <b>route</b> in order to solve the <b>standby</b> <b>route</b> invalidation problem existing in route update method based on signal strength. The simulation results prove the performance parameters such as routing consume and routing reconstruction times are improved evidently under the high speed movement scene in ANS-AOMDV...|$|E
