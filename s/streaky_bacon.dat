60|$|It is {{the custom}} on the stage, in all good murderous melodramas, {{to present the}} tragic and the comic scenes, in as regular alternation, as the layers of red and white in a side of <b>streaky</b> <b>bacon.</b> The hero sinks upon his straw bed, weighed down by fetters and misfortunes; in the next scene, his {{faithful}} but unconscious squire regales the audience with a comic song. We behold, with throbbing bosoms, the heroine in the grasp of a proud and ruthless baron: her virtue and her life alike in danger, drawing forth her dagger to preserve {{the one at the}} cost of the other; and just as our expectations are wrought up to the highest pitch, a whistle is heard, and we are straightway transported to the great hall of the castle; where a grey-headed seneschal sings a funny chorus with a funnier body of vassals, who are free of all sorts of places, from church vaults to palaces, and roam about in company, carolling perpetually.|$|E

Peameal bacon is a variety of back bacon popular in southern Ontario where the loin is wet cured before being rolled in cornmeal (originally yellow pea meal).The bacon is then sliced and fried or can be baked whole and then sliced. It is never smoked.|$|R
60|$|These matters being arranged, and Frank agreeing {{at once to}} the {{proposition}} that as he was a stranger it would make things more comfortable were he to pay his rent in advance, found himself alone in his new apartment. It was a room about ten feet square. The bed occupied one corner, with the washstand at its foot. There was a small {{table in front of}} the fireplace, and two chairs; a piece of carpet half covered the floor, and these with the addition of the articles in the cupboard constituted the furniture of the room. Feeling hungry after his journey Frank resolved to go out at once and get something to eat, and then to lay in a stock of provisions. After some hesitation regarding the character of the meal he decided upon two Bath buns, determining to make a substantial tea. He laid in a supply of tea, sugar, butter, and salt, bought a little kettle, a frying pan, and a gridiron. Then he hesitated as to whether he should venture upon a mutton chop or some bacon, deciding finally in favor of the latter, upon the reflection that any fellow could see whether bacon were properly frizzled up, while as to a chop there was no seeing anything about it till one cut it. He, therefore, invested in a pound of prime <b>streaky</b> Wiltshire <b>bacon,</b> the very best, as the shopman informed him, that could be bought. He returned carrying all his purchases, {{with the exception of the}} hardware. Then he inquired of his landlady where he could get coal.|$|R

5000|$|Street was {{an active}} member of the Ecclesiological Society. From an early age he had been {{interested}} in the principles of Gothic architecture, and made frequent tours to study and draw Gothic architecture across Europe. He was an exceptional draughtsman, and in 1855 he published a very careful and well illustrated work on The Brick and Marble Architecture of Northern Italy, and in 1865 a book on The Gothic Architecture of Spain. These works inspired the wider use of constructional polychromy by British architects, sometimes mocked as [...] "The <b>Streaky</b> <b>Bacon</b> Style".|$|E
50|$|The bacon used is streaky, smoky bacon. Here, too, it is {{important}} if the dish is to taste its best not to use 'any old bacon'. The origin—whether from the Vierlande, the Black Forest or Tyrol—is immaterial; {{all of them are}} suitable and offer a variety of interesting flavours. The deciding factor is the storage of the bacon. Only <b>streaky</b> <b>bacon</b> that has been air-dried and stored produces when cooked that pleasant taste of seasoned fat that melts in the mouth. Bacon, which—as is common today—has been stored hygienically in its vacuum wrapper, only produces a sort of fibrous stringiness after being cooked.|$|E
50|$|American / <b>streaky</b> <b>bacon</b> {{has also}} played {{a big part in}} Puerto Rican cuisine. It is used in rice, stewed beans, and to stuff mofongo and meats such as whole chicken and the breast. Bacon in Puerto Rico has found its way into {{traditional}} foods such as arroz con gandules and potato salad. Another meat that has found its way onto the Puerto Rican table from the U.S. is turkey (pavo), which is not native to the island but a common holiday meal next to the older lechón, roasted whole and seasoned using either pernil or adobo, often served with a side of blood sausage and ripe plantains.|$|E
50|$|Laverbread (bara lawr) is {{made from}} the seaweed porphyra umbilicalis. The seaweed is purplish-black and found strewn {{throughout}} the intertidal area of Gower, particularly the upper levels. It {{is more common in}} the winter period, from late autumn onwards, where the rocks are near, or overlain with, sand. This seaweed can be found on most of the rocky beaches of Gower; it appears to be in greater volume, probably because it is less frequently collected for laverbread than before. Traditionally, it is boiled for hours to render it into a thick puree. It is sold in Swansea Market but, if gathered fresh, it can be deep-fried into tasty crisps. Other recipes include laverbread breakfast cake, laverbread and cockle pate, laverbread with <b>streaky</b> <b>bacon,</b> and laverbread with mashed potato. There are still some small producers of Gower laverbread, but larger quantities are sourced from the west coast of Scotland. A Gower breakfast can comprise griddled bacon with cockles, laverbread and baked eggs.|$|E
50|$|Shellfish of {{all sorts}} {{are part of the}} diet, and {{shellfish}} of the coastal regions include little neck clams, sea scallops, blue mussels, oysters, soft shell clams and razor shell clams. Much of this shellfish contributes to New England tradition, the clambake. The clambake as known today is a colonial interpretation of an American Indian tradition. In summer, oysters and clams are dipped in batter and fried, often served in a basket with french fries, or commonly on a wheaten bun as a clam roll. Oysters are otherwise eaten chilled on a bed of crushed ice on the half shell with mignonette sauce, and are often branded on where they were harvested. Large quahogs are stuffed with breadcrumbs and seasoning and baked in their shells, and smaller ones often find their way into clam chowder. Other preparations include clams casino, clams on the half shell served stuffed with herbs like oregano and <b>streaky</b> <b>bacon.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Pigs {{are part}} of the mixed farming economy. Traditionally every farm kept a pig as part of the staple diet. During the winter, the main source of meat was cured ham and bacon from pigs raised on the farm. Hams were cured in the large {{chimneys}} of farm kitchens, which slowly dried the ham and bacon after it had been salted. This tradition has largely died out, but the remaining producers make hams which are similar to Bayonne, Serrano, or Parma hams. Freshly cured ham is sliced for grilling, older ham is boiled as a York ham, and ham cured for many months is sliced wafer thin, like Parma ham. Carmarthen ham has a similar delicious farmyard flavour. The hocks have the greatest flavour, and need to be boiled a long time to soften the meat. They make a good base for winter stew, or a summer ‘paysanne’ salad. Dry-cured Carmarthen Ham can be found at Carmarthen Market. Five generations of the Rees family have sold ham here [...] spanning 200 years. and their family were the first commercial producers of dry-cured ham in Britain. Carmarthen Ham is dry salt-cured and then air dried and sold whole boneless, or sliced thinly and vacuum packed. Legend has it that when the Romans settled in Carmarthen they stole the recipe and on their return to Italy called it Parma Ham. The ham is cut in thin wafers and is served like prosciutto or Parma ham, but is saltier. Carmarthen Ham production remains a cottage industry, in order to keep it a premium product. Carmarthen Ham is a particular favourite of the Prince of Wales. The Rees family also produce a short back and <b>streaky</b> <b>bacon.</b> This is dry-cured for one week and hung for a further three weeks. It is recommended that the bacon is blanched before frying to remove any excess salt. The Rees family have more than 80 hams curing at any one time, and it takes nine months to cure [...] they also have a mail order business and travel to the nearby markets of Brecon, Fishguard, Haverfordwest, Pembroke and Cardigan. Recipes for Carmarthen ham include: ‘Country Ham with Vegetable Stew’, ‘Pancakes stuffed with Carmarthen Ham and Wild Mushrooms with a savoury Custard’, and ‘Salad Paysanne with Carmarthen Ham and Lentils,’ and ‘Carmarthen Ham in Beer’ [...] Carmarthenshire Ham has featured on Rick Stein’s “Food Heroes” [...] The Welsh chef Dudley recommends pork wrapped in Carmarthenshire ham [...] At the Royal Welsh Show 2010, Carmarthenshire Ham was included in the new European Protected Food names initiative for Protective Geographical Indication (PGI) status, which would give European Union legal status to Carmarthenshire Ham.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the contribution of direct and indirect contamination on ochratoxin A (OTA) levels in different ripened pork products. A total of 24 Large White pigs were fed naturally OTA contaminated diets (4 different contamination levels, from 0. 40 to 171 mg kg 1) for 2 weeks. Typical Italian pork products (dry sausage, dry-cured pork neck, dry-cured <b>streaky</b> <b>bacon</b> and dry-cured ham) were prepared using the contaminated tissues and ripened in 3 dry-cured ham manufacturing plants. Plasma, organs, tissues and ripened pork products were analysed for OTA content. As regards the animals fed at a level slightly less than 50 mg kg - 1, the guidance value recommended by the Commission of European Communities, the OTA levels in muscle and in the ripened products were close to 1 mg kg - 1 (range of the mean values 0. 65 e 1. 62 mg kg - 1), the guideline value in meat products recommended by the Italian Ministry of Health. Dry sausage and dry-cured pork neck showed significantly higher OTA concentrations than dry-cured ham and dry-cured <b>streaky</b> <b>bacon.</b> OTA was partially degraded during the long ripening time of dry-cured ham. In dry sausage and dry-cured pork neck direct contamination was low and it was not detected in dry-cured streaky bacon; on the contrary, very high OTA levels were detected in several outer dry-cured ham samples (maximum OTA value: 314 mg kg- 1). These results confirmed that direct contamination should be mainly monitored in dry-cured ham, whereas indirect contamination may eventually be relevant in other ripened pork products...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{has been carried}} out on oxidative processes of fresh and stored frozen pork and of two pork products (salame Milano and mortadella). Wholesale pork cuts (shoulder, ham trimmings, belly and backfat) were checked fresh and after frozen storage (1, 3 and 6 months). The <b>streaky</b> <b>bacon</b> was studied fresh and after scalding at 80 °C. Salame Milano and mortadella were produced with fresh and frozen raw materials and a few commercial samples were also part of the study. No real differences have been observed between commercial and experimentally produced salame and mortadella. Peroxide and TBARS values were low in all cases. Among the cholesterol oxides determined (7 beta-hydroxycholesterol, 5, 6 a-epoxycholesterol, 7 -ketocholesterol and 25 -hydroxycholesterol) those dangerous for human health were either absent or their concentration was below toxic levels. The results are discussed on the light of literature reports and Italian pork products technologies...|$|E
