5|$|The {{financing}} for rebuilding the downtown core came {{in large part}} from the infusion of investment from Dutch bankers; this investment was <b>so</b> <b>deep</b> <b>that</b> by 1896, one prominent Dutch mortgage company, the Northwestern and Pacific Hypotheekbank owned {{a quarter of the}} city.|$|E
5|$|To sum up: The {{lines of}} {{cleavage}} between Pablo's revisionism and orthodox Trotskyism are <b>so</b> <b>deep</b> <b>that</b> no compromise is possible either politically or organizationally. The Pablo faction {{has demonstrated that}} it will not permit democratic decisions truly reflecting majority opinion to be reached. They demand complete submission to their criminal policy. They are determined to drive all orthodox Trotskyists out of the Fourth International or to muzzle and handcuff them.|$|E
5|$|The confessional {{conflicts}} {{that dominated the}} relations between the ruling city authorities were only secondary to the peasants of the Huttwil league. The peasant alliance bridged the confessional divide, uniting Catholic people from the Entlebuch and from Solothurn with Protestant peasants from the Emmental and from Basel. The treaty of Huttwil explicitly recognized this biconfessionalism. The cities remained in all their manoeuvring and negotiations for military support within their respective confessional spheres: Catholic Lucerne had requested mediation and then military help from the Catholic central Swiss cantons, while Protestant Bern had turned to Protestant Zürich for help. The distrust between the authorities of the Catholic and Protestant cantons was <b>so</b> <b>deep</b> <b>that</b> none would allow troops of the other confession to operate on their territories.|$|E

5|$|The hermitage, now in ruins, was {{originally}} built in three tiers (one above the other): the lowest tier was the hermitage or the main compound, the middle tier {{was known as}} the Upper Residence (Gzims khang gong ma) and top tier was the Temple of the Sixteen Arhats (Gnas bcu lha khang). The Seventh Dalai Lama, who was a student, fully supported Bzod pa rgya mtsho to build the first temple (Temple of the Sixteen Arhats) and also a residence for himself to stay during his visits to the hermitage, which {{came to be known as}} the 'Upper Residence'. The Dalai Lama's reverence for his guru was <b>so</b> <b>deep</b> <b>that</b> when the Bzod pa rgya mtsho died, he even performed the last rites for him, got installed his funerary stūpa and statue. He also located the Incarnate Lama of his guru at 'Phan po' near Lhasa. The second Bzod pa rgya mtsho also had excellent equation with the Eighth Dalai Lama, Jampel Gyatso (Da lai bla ma sku phreng brgyad pa ’jam dpal rgya mtsho). This power equation resulted in two more monasteries being built as satellite monasteries.|$|E
5|$|The {{very first}} Commando raid– Operation Collar on 23 June 1940– was not {{actually}} carried out by a Commando unit, but by one of their predecessors: No.11 Independent Company. The mission, led by Major Ronnie Tod, was an offensive reconnaissance carried out on the French coast south of Boulogne-sur-Mer and Le Touquet. The operation was a limited success; at least two German soldiers were killed whilst the only British injury was a flesh wound suffered by Lieutenant Colonel Dudley Clarke, who had accompanied the raiders as an observer. A second and similarly inconsequential raid, Operation Ambassador, was made on the German occupied island of Guernsey {{on the night of}} 14 July 1940 by men from H Troop of No. 3 Commando and No. 11 Independent Company. One unit landed on the wrong island and another group disembarked from its launch into water <b>so</b> <b>deep</b> <b>that</b> it came over their heads. Intelligence had indicated that there was a large German barracks on the island but the Commandos found only empty buildings. When they returned to the beach heavy seas had forced their launch offshore, and they were forced to swim out to sea to be picked up.|$|E

25|$|The low {{pressure}} center was <b>so</b> <b>deep</b> <b>that</b> {{somewhat of an}} eye actually formed.

25|$|Above Newhalem, Washington, the Skagit {{flows through}} a deep gorge, {{contrasting}} strongly with the glacial valley below Newhalem. One {{of the several}} theories about this anomaly is that the upper Skagit once drained northward into Canada and the growth and retreat of successive Cordilleran ice flows brought about the reversal. Each advance blocked the river, forcing it to find new routes to the south, in the process carving deep gorges. Eventually, the Skagit gorge was <b>so</b> <b>deep</b> <b>that</b> even after the Cordilleran ice retreated for good, the river continued flowing south instead of north into Canada.|$|E
25|$|The carving is <b>so</b> <b>deep</b> <b>that</b> {{the forms}} are almost {{completely}} offset from the background resulting in three, or even four, layers of various figures and forms. What is more, overlapping figures fill the image space entirely, allowing {{no room to}} depict a background. Thus, the sense of space has been eliminated, giving rise to chaos {{and a sense of}} weary, open-ended victory. The effect of movement in the scene is evident and, unlike many battle sarcophagi which have more tranquil scenes on the side panels, the battle events continue {{all the way around the}} sarcophagus. The perspective constructed is also notable, although certainly not linear.|$|E

25|$|In {{the mid-19th}} century, {{with the decline}} of the Ottoman Empire, the city was a backwater, with a {{population}} that did not exceed 8,000. Nevertheless, it was, even then, an extremely heterogeneous city because of its significance to Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. The population was divided into four major communities– Jewish, Christian, Muslim, and Armenian– and the first three of these could be further divided into countless subgroups, based on precise religious affiliation or country of origin. The Church of the Holy Sepulchre was meticulously partitioned between the Greek Orthodox, Catholic, Armenian, Coptic, and Ethiopian churches. Tensions between the groups ran <b>so</b> <b>deep</b> <b>that</b> the keys to the shrine and its doors were safeguarded by a pair of 'neutral' Muslim families.|$|E
25|$|In some {{circumstances}} Front fortifications {{did not follow}} the layout scheme described above. Bunkers and fighting holes were scattered more widely to delay attackers, and create the psychological impression that they were surrounded on all sides. Lookout posts were often positioned on key trails, routes and likely US helicopter landing zones. To enhance their mobility during a defensive battle, numerous air-raid shelters, bunkers and trenches were pre-built in advance around an area of operations. This involved {{an enormous amount of}} labor but proved their value in maneuvering under ARVN/US attacks. Foxholes dug by VC troops during the victorious Battle of Ap Bac are testimony to the insurgents almost religious dedication to field fortifications. The holes were dug <b>so</b> <b>deep</b> <b>that</b> a man could stand inside. Excavation of dirt was from the rear, hiding telltale traces of the digging. Only a direct hit by an artillery shell or bomb could kill troops inside such holes. Behind the line of foxholes, the Viet Cong utilized and improved an irrigation ditch, allowing them concealed movement, communication and transmission of supplies on foot or by sampan. Most of these fighting positions were invisible from the air.|$|E
