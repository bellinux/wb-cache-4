50|$|The Kaluli live in longhouses, {{about twenty}} in number, which operate as {{autonomous}} communities. Each longhouse houses approximately fifteen families, numbering approximately 60 to 90 per longhouse, that each divide into {{two or three}} patrilineal lineages. Many families have begun to live mainly in smaller separate dwellings for two or more extended families, while still maintaining their communal longhouse (circa 1984). They are a highly egalitarian people without a hierarchical authority or ranked social structure. They are swidden agriculturalists whose food staple is the sago. They maintain extensive gardens while also pursuing hunting and fishing: their diet is supplemented by garden cultivated banana, pandanus, breadfruit and green vegetables, as well as fish, <b>small</b> <b>game,</b> <b>wild</b> pig and occasionally domestic pig. Kaluli people also believe that male initiation must be properly done by ritually delivering the semen of an elderly member through the initiate's anus.|$|R

5000|$|An {{apparent}} {{break in}} the occupation of Franchthi cave occurred during the Younger Dryas climate cooling event, after which a Mesolithic culture appeared as the world settled into the warm Holocene climate that continues today. The Mesolithic is represented by only a few sites in Greece, and, like Franchthi, {{nearly all of them}} are close to the coast. They did not rely as heavily on big game as their predecessors, probably due to the changing climate and environment; instead they broadened their resource base to include a variety of <b>small</b> <b>game,</b> <b>wild</b> plants, fish and mollusks. The evidence of increased fish bones and increased use of obsidian from Melos at Franchthi during this period shows they were accomplished seafarers. There is a notable stretch spanning several hundred years (circa 7,900 - 7,500 BCE) when tuna became {{a major part of the}} diet at Franchthi cave, implying deep sea fishing. It has also been suggested that the tuna could have been caught by placing nets near the shore. [...] A few graves have been found buried in the cave during the Mesolithic that suggest care for the dead.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Human neurotrichinellosis {{is seldom}} reported. This is likely {{the result of}} the low {{incidence}} of parasites from the genus Trichinella in the United States domestic food supply, as well as difficulties in diagnosing the disease, especially when neither the organism nor the source of the infection are readily available. Although trichinellosis from domestic food supplies has been decreasing for many years, a resurgence has occurred in cases derived from the consumption of <b>wild</b> <b>game.</b> We report a rare case of neurotrichinellosis in the United States and implicate <b>wild</b> <b>game</b> as the source of the infection. These results suggest that clinicians should consider the potential for Trichinella infection in cases where <b>wild</b> <b>game</b> is common in the diets of the patients...|$|R

40|$|Forests in Africa and Asia host various {{wildlife}} {{populations that}} cause {{varying levels of}} damages to forest resources. The economic damage is more severe in forest plantations meant for timber production that require huge financial outlays. Like many countries most forest ecosystems in Kenya contain many forest plantations and <b>wild</b> <b>game</b> conservation units. Despite the heavy losses to plantation crops by <b>wild</b> <b>game,</b> {{the extent of the}} loss as well as existence of a balance between <b>wild</b> <b>game</b> conservation and plantation forestry remains unknown. The study therefore attempts to deepen the knowledge on the impacts of game damage on forest ecosystems in particular plantations and also provide some option to forest managers to counter minimize damage levels. To minimize <b>wild</b> <b>game</b> damages in Key ecosystems of Mt. Kenya and Aberdares in Kenya game moats were constructed. Recently, electric fences were introduced into parts of the Aberdares to keep away wild animals from plantations and farms. The use of physical structures has been successful in reducing damage from large game such as elephants and buffaloes but controlling smaller game mostly monkeys, porcupines, and moles remain a challenge. This paper focuses on the benefits and challenges of restricting <b>wild</b> <b>game</b> movement in forest plantations management as well as the ecological and economic impacts in Mt Kenya and Aberdare ecosystems. The study was carried out through assessments of the damage intensity of foliage, tree lim...|$|R
