In recent years, {{a lot of attention}} has been devoted to study active Brownian particles, i. e., microscopic particles capable of <b>selfpropelling.</b> Unlike simple passive particles, active particles feature an interplay between random fluctuations and active swimming. Thus, active particles are out of thermal equilibrium and, therefore, they explore their environment completely different from passive particles. Bacteria and other microorganisms are natural examples of active particles that take up energy from their environment and convert into directed (run) motion. Recently, {{there has been a lot}} of research progress in the realization of artificial active particles (microswimmers) due to their potential technological applications. We report the anomalous diffusion of anisotropic particles propelled by biological microswimmers (E. Coli Bacteria). The anisotropic particles of various shapes (L-shape, U-shape, cross-shape, Starshape and Z-shape) were fabricated using soft lithography method. We study the motion (translation and rotation) of various anisotropic shaped particles in the thermal and active bath. The results are compared with isotropic (spherical) particles. We observe that shape anisotropy in particle plays a vital role when they are suspended in the bath of E-Coli cells showing different diffusion behavior as the swimming pressure of E-Coli bacteria differs in the shape anisotropy.

40|$|Background: Physical fitness {{levels in}} youth with osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) who use wheelchairs are unknown. The 10 -m Shuttle Ride Test (SRiT) has {{recently}} been introduced as a field test to determine cardiorespiratory fitness in children with cerebral palsy who <b>selfpropel</b> a wheelchair. Objective: The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the feasibility and reproducibility of the SRiT, as well as the physiological responses to the SRiT, in youth with moderate-to-severe OI between 8 and 25 years of age who self-propel a wheelchair at least for long distances. Design: A test-retest design was used. Methods: Thirteen patients with OI (8 boys, 5 girls; mean±SD values for age= 15. 5 ± 6. 4 years) using a manual wheelchair performed 2 SRiTs within 2 weeks. Adverse events, reached stage, peak heart rate (HRpeak), peak respiratory exchange ratio (RERpeak), peak oxygen uptake (VO 2 peak), and peak minute ventilation (VEpeak) were the main outcome parameters. Results and Discussion. All participants performed a maximal effort at both SRiTs (mean±SD values for HRpeak of 195 ± 9 beats per minute [bpm], RERpeak of 1. 32 ± 0. 16, VO 2 peak of 25. 4 ± 5. 6 mL·kg− 1 ·min− 1, and VEpeak of 47. 9 ± 18. 6 L·min− 1), without adverse events. The intraclass correlation coefficient of the reached stage showed excellent reliability (. 95). Limits of agreement (LoA) analysis revealed acceptable LoA for reached stage (mean bias=− 0. 58, range=− 2. 50 to − 1. 35). There was a low correlation between reached stage and VO 2 peak (r=. 61 and r=. 45 for the first and second SRiTs, respectively). Limitations: The influence of wheelchair properties and individually adjusted wheelchair designs was not examined. Conclusions: The SRiT appears to be a feasible, safe, and reproducible maximal field test in youth with OI using wheelchairs at least for long distances.

40|$|We {{describe}} and characterize {{a method for}} estimating the pressure field corresponding to velocity field measurements such as those obtained by using particle image velocimetry. The pressure gradient is estimated from a time series of velocity fields for unsteady calculations or from a single velocity field for quasi-steady calculations.

Integration paths are restricted to the nodes of the measured velocity field, thereby eliminating the need for measurement interpolation during this step and significantly reducing the computational cost of the algorithm relative to previous approaches. The method is validated by using numerically simulated flow past a stationary, two-dimensional bluff body and a computational model of a three-dimensional, <b>selfpropelled</b> anguilliform swimmer to study the effects of spatial and temporal resolution, domain size, signal-to-noise ratio and out-of-plane effects.

We combine second order local {{regression}} meta-models with the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy {{in order to}} enhance it’s efficiency in the optimization of computationally expensive problems. Computationally intensive direct numerical simulations of an anguilliform swimmer provide the testbed for the optimization. We propose two concepts to reduce the computational cost of the meta-model building. The novel versions of the local meta-model assisted Evolution Strategy are tested on benchmark problems and compared to results from literature. The results demonstrate that the use of local meta-models increases significantly the efficiency of already competitive evolution strategies and that the model building cost can be successfully reduced. The meta-model assisted Evolution Strategy is applied to the optimization of the swimming motion of a three-dimensional, self-propelled eel-like body. The motion of the <b>selfpropelled</b> body is determined by a set of parameters but the motion is not prescribed apriori. Instead here we introduce the concept of identifying the swimming motion parameters from an evolutionary optimization procedure.

Machine specific parameters of the process have to be examined to estimate {{the efficiency of the}} cutting process. As a contribution to that problem a simple method for indirect measurement of the efficiency is presented and described in this article.

The data from two sensors were recorded while gathering whole crop silage and while standing still in operation mode. For every data stream, a spectral analysis and a feature extraction was performed. For the development of the algorithm, exploration techniques of Machine Learning were implemented. Artificial Neural Networks were optimized using subsets of the recorded data and then applied to the independent validation data to compute the efficiency of the cutting process. The established algorithm is able to identify the process efficiency without using additional machine-specific parameters. The validation results are presented as confusion matrices for each data set and the case-specific population of the generated Artificial Neural Networks.

The increase in size of the machinery and {{the increasing number of}} contractors has opened the market to <b>selfpropelled</b> forage harvesters equipped with headers that can harvest row crops in any direction, at any spacing. High-capacity pull-type forage harvesters are also in demand but no commercial model offers non-row sensitive corn headers. The objectives of this research were to collect data and develop models of specific energy requirements for a prototype non-row sensitive corn header. The ability to better understand the processes involved during the harvesting and the modeling of these allowed the formulation of recommendations to reduce the loads on the harvester and propelling tractor. Three sets of experiments were performed. The first experiment consisted of measuring specific energy requirements of a non-row sensitive header, in field conditions, and to compare them with a conventional header. The prototype tested was found to require approximately twice the power than a conventional header of the same width, mostly due to high no-load power. Some properties of corn stalk required for the modeling of the energy needs, that were not available in literature, were measured in the laboratory. Those include the cutting energy with a specific knife configuration used on the prototype header and the crushing resistance of corn stalk. Two knife designs were compared for required cutting energy and found not to be significantly different with values of 0. 054 J/mm 2 of stalk cross-section area and 0. 063 J/mm 2. An average crushing resistance of 6. 5 N per percent of relative deformation was measured. Three mathematical models were developed and validated with experimental data to predict and understand the specific energy needs of the non-row sensitive header.

Self-propelled {{forage harvesters}} are able to make a variety of feed from different crops, including whole-plant corn silage, earlage, and haylage, among others. The self-propelled forage harvester is a complex and expensive piece of machinery for a producer to own. The self-propelled forage harvester market in the United States is a growing market, but small when compared to other equipment such as combines.

Growth of the self-propelled forage harvester market is reflected in increased unit sales, total horsepower sold, and average horsepower of the <b>selfpropelled</b> forage harvesters sold in the United States. This study looks at changes in the number and size of self-propelled forage harvesters being purchased and what factors might be driving those changes.

This study investigated the impact of a soil-steaming method (the Bioflash system) on main chemical (total organic C, TOC; total N, TN; cation exchange capacity, CEC; exchangeable Na, K, Mg and Ca; KCl-extractable ammonium and nitrate, DTPA-exchangeable Mn) and microbial (microbial biomass C, MBC; genetic structure of bacterial communities) properties in a greenhouse loamy soil. Treatments were carried out by using a <b>selfpropelled</b> soil-steaming machine operating at two steaming modes (deep or shallow) in combination or not with addition of an exothermically reacting compound (CaO at a 1000 kg ha 1 rate). Soils from a fivetreatment (NS, non-steamed soil, DS, deep steam injection; DS þ E, deep steam injection plus CaO; SS, shallow steam injection; SS þ E, shallow steam injection plus CaO) plot block were sampled before steaming and after 8, 19, 54 and 91 days. Compositional shifts in the structure of soil bacterial communities were monitored by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) fingerprinting of soilextracted 16 S rRNA gene fragments, using primers specific for Bacteria and Actinobacteria. Maximum soil temperature reached 70 C (DS) and 82 C (DS þ E) in the 10 e 20 cm layer; and 50 C (SS) and 53 C (SS þ E) in the 0 e 10 cm layer. TOC, TN, CEC, exchangeable Na, Mg and Ca were not statistically affected by soil steaming, CaO addition, depth of injection or their interactions. Conversely, SS promoted a large release of exchangeable K, notwithstanding CaO addition. Steam disinfestation significantly stimulated ammonium release, which further increased in CaO-treated steamed soils. Generally ammonium and nitrate pools varied oppositely, being the latter markedly reduced {{at the end of the}} observation period. Available Mn was significantly increased by soil steaming, but it was depressed when steaming was combined with CaO addition. Soil steaming markedly reduced the MBC, especially in DS-treated and SS-treated plots. The genetic structure of soil bacterial and actinobacterial communities was largely unresponsive to the steaming treatments. Even though the Bioflash system did not cause bacterial eradication or compositional shifts in bacterial community structure, soil steaming stimulated an increased release of soluble nutrients (Kþ, Mn 2 þ, NH 4 þ eN). Over a longer perspective, excessive soil resources exploitation and potential risks of Mn toxicity should be cautiously considered especially in repeatedly (and eventually acid) steamed soils...|$|E
40|$|Probably one of {{the most}} often {{observed}} but least known institutions on the Great Plains is custom harvesting. Although the practice probably dates from the Hrst itinerate laborer who bought a grain craddle, Thomas Isern 2 ̆ 7 s book is about the men who traveled from Texas to Canada seeking employment for their expensive combining machines. For the most part, Isern 2 ̆ 7 s custom harvesters entered the business during World War II and survived the long period of low prices and high costs that characterized American agriculture in the 1950 s and 1960 s. Custom harvesting reached maturity during world War II, when farmers received high prices for their grain but were not able to acquire the machinery to harvest it. Small-grain harvesting is such a timely operation that farmers probably would have turned to custom workers {{even in the absence of}} wartime shortages of equipment and labor. Private industry and the federal government joined to make custom harvesting a Great Plains institution. Through the Federal Extension Service and state employment agencies, custom harvesters were directed toward those areas where they were most needed. In 1944, with the blessings of the American and Canadian governments, MasseyFerguson secured materials to produce extra combines and organized a series of 2 ̆ 2 harvest brigades 2 ̆ 2 to ensure that wheat and other small grains were secured for the war effort. Isern notes that, with the end of the war, agencies designed to aid farmers did not continue to serve the needs of custom harvesters. Indeed, state license requirements tended to inhibit the movement of custom harvesters across state lines. But the farmers 2 ̆ 7 dependence on custom harvesting during the war years undoubtedly conditioned them to rely on such services after the war was over. Certainly, custom harvesters were well established by the postwar period, cutting as much as 50 percent of the crop in some states. Most of the custom harvesters in Isern 2 ̆ 7 s study were farmers from the central and southern plains who moved south during the early harvest, returned home to cut their own grain, and then continued north to harvest in the spring wheat belt. Advances in combine design, particularly the development of the <b>selfpropelled</b> combine, were often stimulated by the experience of the custom harvesters. By the 1960 s combines became such a major investment that most purchasers had to fmd work for their machines beyond their own needs. At the same time many farmers simply could not afford the investment. In an otherwise thorough and well-written study, Isern leaves some questions unanswered. He never quite explains why some custom harvesters survived through lean years while others abandoned the business. His allusion to a certain 2 ̆ 2 romantic 2 ̆ 2 character of the custom harvesters is inadequate. He notes that 2 ̆ 2 amateurs 2 ̆ 2 came and went in the business but seems to distinguish amateurs from professionals only by their longevity. Isern points out that his subjects are primarily southern-based farmers. What comparisons could be made with custom harvesters from northern states? For example, a quick review of custom harvesters from Montana suggests that most do not engage in farming for themselves. Is that a general regional characteristic? Aside from these minor criticisms, Isern 2 ̆ 7 s study is a welcome addition to the literature of plains farming...|$|E
40|$|Accurate {{prediction}} {{of the real}} voyaging speed for ocean‐going vessels in the actual weather condition {{is important for the}} expanding shipping industry. Ship owners are always aiming at achieving the highest profit, so delivering the goods to the destination within the designed schedule time is of great concern. At the same time, the increasing attention on environmental issues as well as increasing fuel price have put more pressure on optimizing the ship design with respect to energy efficiency. Also, accurate {{prediction of}} the real attainable speed will greatly improve the sea margin prediction. From these respects, the research work on speed loss study is important and necessary. Speed loss is usually categorized as voluntary or involuntary. Voluntary speed loss is when the ship master actively reduces the ship speed to avoid slamming, propeller racing, excessive ship motion or other effects that might cause danger or severe discomfort. Voluntary speed loss is subjective and relies on ship master's experience. Different ship masters can have quite different actions to the same circumstance based on their ability to estimate the potential danger. Involuntary speed loss is due to added resistance from waves, wind, current and reduced thrust and efficiency due to waves and other changes in operational conditions. Involuntary speed loss is in focus in this thesis work. In order to investigate the nature of speed reduction in the real environment, integrated knowledge about resistance, propulsion, ship machinery, seakeeping, automatic control and maneuvering are required. This thesis takes advantage of model tests and a numerical simulation tool based on simplified modular concept to investigate the nature of speed reduction in seakeeping and maneuvering conditions. A series of experiments were carried out on a model of 8000 DWT tanker in the large towing tank and ocean basin at Marine Technology Center in Trondheim, Norway. The model was <b>selfpropelled</b> and mainly running in moderate long wave conditions. For speed loss in head sea conditions, three different bow shapes were tested in order to investigate the influence of added wave resistance. Due to the practical difficulty of applying towrope force to balance the frictional resistance coefficient difference between model scale and full scale ship, a method is proposed in this thesis to make compensation for the frictional resistance difference and predict speed loss of the ships when propeller is working at 'ship propulsion point'. Test results show that a conventional bow with bulb and flare gave least calm water resistance, while a bow without bulb and flare gave the least total resistance in the tested wave conditions. That means bulb can have positive influence on calm water resistance and negative effect on added wave resistance. Reduction of speed loss in waves up to order of 10 % can be gained by relatively minor changes to the bow shape of a vessel. Another two tests for speed loss in zigzag maneuvering in head waves and speed loss in oblique waves were carried out in the towing tank and ocean basin respectively. Speed loss when doing zigzag maneuvering in waves is due to yawing, added wave resistance and loss of thrust due to steering; while for speed loss in oblique waves is due to added wave resistance and loss of thrust due to steering. For the test of speed loss in oblique waves, towrope force is added by an air fan. Due to limitation of basin length, converged speed is not always achieved during the tests due to the large mass of the model. A converged speed prediction method is proposed which can be used to correct the nonconverged tests results. This method is carefully verified and can give good prediction of attainable speed in waves. However, this method is sensitive to the selection of thrust deduction factor in waves. Also how much speed loss due to added wave resistance and due to steering is pointed out. Speed loss due to added wave resistance and steering is of the same magnitude in head sea and bow sea conditions. While for beam sea, speed loss due to steering is dominating. Numerical simulation work was carried out in order to make comparisons with experimental results. Comparable calculations were performed in the frequency domain tool ShipX and in the time‐domain tool Vessel Simulator. Ship motion is calculated by linear strip theory and added wave resistance in head sea is calculated by the method developed by Gerritsma and Beukelman and the Direct Pressure Integration method. Wave resistance in other than head sea condition in surge, sway and yaw directions is calculated by the method proposed by Loukakis and Sclavounos, which is an extension of the Gerritsma and Beukelman method to other than head sea. For the speed loss in head sea condition, both frequency domain calculations using ShipX and time domain calculations using Vessel Simulator were carried out. It is concluded that both methods can give a good prediction of speed loss in moderate sea conditions. For the cases that steering effect has to be taken into account, time domain simulation is a preferable method. Generally speaking, numerical results can give a good correlation with model test data. Based on the good validation of the numerical tool, further numerical investigations were carried out to compare the speed loss characteristics between conventional propeller‐rudder system and azimuth thrusters. The results showed that conventional propeller‐rudder system has better speed keeping ability than azimuth thrusters. That is because in the conventional propeller‐rudder system propeller force is not decomposed by the rudder angle and also conventional propeller‐rudder system has higher ratio of longitudinal thrust force/transverse thrust force than azimuth thrusters within the working steering angle range. In the end, recommendations to ITTC procedures to predict speed loss and power increase in irregular waves and sea margin were proposed. A method to predict 'ship propulsion point' from the self‐propulsion test carried out at 'model propulsion point' is specified in this thesis. This method will greatly improve the procedures to predict power increase in irregular waves from model tests in regular waves. Also another suggestion is proposed that when evaluating power increase in irregular waves and sea margin prediction, thrust deduction due to ventilation and steering effect should be taken into account in addition to thrust diminution factor.
