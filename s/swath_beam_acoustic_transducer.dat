40|$|Abstract: An {{acoustic}} {{profiling system}} designed to measure sand ripples in three dimensions has been developed and successfully deployed on benthic frames at two sites around the UK coast. The system comprises a mechanically scanning pencil <b>beam</b> <b>acoustic</b> <b>transducer</b> mounted on a two axis stepper motor assembly within a fully enclosed oil-filled housing. A pressure sensor, temperature sensor and conductivity sensor are also integrated with the instrument, ensuring the correct speed of sound is used for deriving distance to the bed {{from the time of}} flight of the acoustic pulses. Data recorded at two sites using the 3 D-Acoustic Ripple Profiler are presented showing tidally migrating sand waves in the first case, and wave induced sand ripples evolving in response to a passing storm in the second...|$|R

Two absolute methods were implemented on this site: on one hand, current meters (CM), performed by WEST Company, as the code-approved method {{to be used to}} check the guarantees. On the other hand, the acoustic scintillation flow meter (ASFM) was implemented by EDF in the intake simultaneously. A large number of current meters (90) for this kind of operation were used, installed on a stationary frame made up of 9 hydraulically-profiled <b>beams.</b> <b>Acoustic</b> scintillation <b>transducers</b> were installed on steel plates mounted directly on the intake wall. Flow conditions were quite good for both methods. The entire efficiency/power range of the turbine was explored using both methods giving absolute discharge measurements. The benefit of using new algorithms derived from a previous PhD 1 work sponsored by EDF, even in these quite good conditions, will also be emphasized. A fairly good level of agreement was achieved between both absolute methods; the agreement was slightly improved when applying the new " SMASH " algorithms. The average difference between CM and ASFM discharge values lies beneath the combined uncertainties of the two methods...|$|R

These results are used to validate the simulation and the transducer fabrication process.
