25|$|When yeast cells die, they sink to {{the bottom}} of the {{fermentation}} vessel where they combine with insoluble tartrates, grape seeds, skin and pulp fragments to form the lees. During fermentation, the first significant racking which removes the bulk of dead yeast cells is often referred to as the gross lees as opposed to the less coarse fine lees that come as the wine continues to settle and age. During the time that the wine spends in contact with the lees, a number of changes can impact the wine due to both the autolysis (or self-metabolize) of the dead yeast cells as well as the reductive conditions that can develop if the lees are not aerated or stirred (a process that the French call bâtonnage). The length of time that a wine <b>spends</b> <b>on</b> its lees (called sur lie) will depend on the winemaking style and type of wine.|$|E

25|$|Policies - Considered on {{the right}} of the party, Fraser {{supports}} far greater tax and spending powers for the Scottish Parliament in the form of further financial devolution. On 1 September, Fraser outlined his vision for 'New Unionism', with the intention of 'killing independence' and then to 'break the SNP'. He states that he rejects full fiscal autonomy for Scotland, calling it 'independence in disguise', but pledged his support for financial devolution, which he claims will make Parliament more accountable for the money it <b>spends.</b> <b>On</b> 4 September, Fraser made a high-profile announcement, that if elected leader, he would disband the party in favour of setting up a new centre-right party that would be fully autonomous of the UK Conservative Party, but would take the Conservative whip at Westminster. Fraser states that this would be carried out in order to 'de-toxify' the party in Scotland, stating that it would have a distinct Scottish identity, represent Scottish values, support devolution and decentralisation, and fight to maintain Scotland's place within the United Kingdom. He also would rename the party - ditching the name 'Conservative' – with possible new names cited as Scottish Reform Party, Scottish Unionists, The Scottish Progressives, the Progressive Conservatives, Scotland First, Scotland Forward, Caledonian Party or The Caledonians. The name 'Unionist' was downplayed, so as to avoid its connotations to Northern Ireland sectarianism, and a smaller Scottish Unionist Party also exists, rendering a change to this name impossible under electoral law.|$|E

40|$|It is {{important}} for central government to have good information about public preferences regarding budget allocations. Consumer sovereignty, government popularity, and efficiency are all dependent on clear articulation of community preferences. The paper draws upon information gathered {{as part of a}} large-scale survey to identify community perceptions {{about the state of the}} New Zealand environment (Hughey et al., 2002) to identify public preferences for allocation of government monies. Methods entailed survey participant statements of preferences for <b>spending</b> <b>on</b> specified environmental and conservation items, a balanced macro-budget reallocation exercise, and a choice modelling exercise to reveal willingness to trade-off expenditures on particular budget items. The environmental budget allocation exercise provides little guidance on which aspects of environmental spending would provide the greatest benefits at the margin. For most items the modal response was no change in current spending. However, more than 50 % of respondents indicated they preferred increased <b>spending</b> <b>on</b> pest & weed control, air quality and fresh waters. The macro-budget reallocation and choice modelling exercises provide similar results. They both indicated that people obtain negative utility from allocating money to income support, and desire cuts to <b>spending</b> <b>on</b> superannuation and income support. Older respondents are not as averse to <b>spending</b> <b>on</b> income support, but are still generally in favour of cuts in <b>spending</b> <b>on</b> this item. <b>Spending</b> <b>on</b> health, education, and the environment all yield positive benefits.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{estimate}} {{the cost of}} psychotropic drugs {{and its impact on}} the Brazilian family budget in 2003 and 2009 comparatively. MethodsThis study had a cross-sectional design. Data were obtained from the Family Budget Surveys conducted in 2003 and 2009, including interviews in 48, 470 and 55, 970 homes of all Brazilian regions, respectively. The main measures are prevalence of psychotropic drug acquisition, monetary and nonmonetary expenses with psychotropic drugs, total <b>spending</b> <b>on</b> drugs, <b>spending</b> <b>on</b> health, total household spending, and estimated mean monthly household income. All incomes and expenses from the 2003 survey were adjusted by inflation. ResultsThere was a reduction in the prevalence of psychotropic drug acquisition by Brazilian households from 13. 0 % in 2003 to 11. 2 % in 2009. The mean monthly household <b>spending</b> <b>on</b> psychotropic drugs, however, rose from R $ 54. 38 in 2003 to R $ 78. 73 in 2009. The percentage of <b>spending</b> <b>on</b> psychotropic drugs from the expenses with health increased 27 %. ConclusionsThe increase in <b>spending</b> <b>on</b> psychotropic drugs can be due to a rise in their prices, the acquisition of more modern or more expensive drugs, or the increase in the number of drugs used. Proportionally, <b>spending</b> <b>on</b> psychotropic drugs grew more than did <b>spending</b> <b>on</b> health by Brazilian families...|$|R

500|$|The time a star <b>spends</b> <b>on</b> {{the main}} {{sequence}} depends {{primarily on the}} amount of fuel it has and the rate at which it fuses it. The Sun is expected to live 10 billion (1010) years. Massive stars consume their fuel very rapidly and are short-lived. Low mass stars consume their fuel very slowly. Stars less massive than 0.25 , called red dwarfs, are able to fuse nearly all of their mass while stars of about 1 [...] can only fuse about 10% of their mass. The combination of their slow fuel-consumption and relatively large usable fuel supply allows low mass stars to last about one trillion (1012) years; the most extreme of 0.08 [...] ) will last for about 12 trillion years. Red dwarfs become hotter and more luminous as they accumulate helium. When they eventually run out of hydrogen, they contract into a white dwarf and decline in temperature.
