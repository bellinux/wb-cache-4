The syntaxial cement overgrowing quartz grains exhibits mostly dark to dark-blue and yellow-brown CL In Ti-rich <b>silcretes.</b> The fine-grained cement that is found capping flint pebbles and as illuviated material in intergranular porosity has a typical milky-white to yellow CL. EPMA analyses of Ti, Fe, Al and K indicate that substituting Al and K are enriched in dark-blue CL quartz with most measured Al concentrations ranging from 1000 to 5000 ppm. Detrital grains and syntaxial quartz with yellow-brown CL typically have < 100 ppm Al. We interpret the Al-rich syntaxial cement as indicative of silicification under acidic conditions.

40|$|International audienceDetailed {{studies of}} morphological, micromorphological and geochemical {{characteristics}} of <b>silcretes</b> {{in the deep}} bleached and weathered regolith across a large area of inland Australia have provided a new interpretation {{of the history of}} the regolith and its climatic and morphological evolution during the Tertiary. Pedogenic <b>silcretes</b> have distinctive morphological and mineralogical features caused by a succession of phases of silica dissolution and recrystallization resulting from multiple episodes of water inﬁltration and percolation under alternately wet and dry climates. These are the oldest of the regolith features. Deep, bleached proﬁles formed over a wide area in a variety of substrates ranging from Precambrian granites to Palaeozoic sandstones, Cretaceous sediments and Tertiary deposits, and represent the second major stage in regolith development. These proﬁles, in which kaolinite coexists with gypsum, alunite and opal, formed by reaction of the substrates with saline groundwaters, the water-table levels of which progressively fell over the region. Extensive networks of termite burrows constructed to great depth in the bleached regolith followed the water tables down. The climate was warm and dry with a high water deﬁcit. Groundwater <b>silcretes</b> formed near-horizontal lenses and pods of porcellanite and jasper in the bleached regolith. They preserve the primary fabric of the host rock. Groundwater <b>silcretes</b> post-date the construction of termite burrows and were formed during a rise in groundwater tables across the landscape, in places to near-surface environments in broad landscape depressions. The climate was more humid but the presence of gypsum during siliciﬁcation demonstrates that the groundwaters were still saline. Red-brown hardpans are the youngest siliciﬁcation features and represent periods of successive inﬁltration and percolation, and waterlogging, during high rainfall or ﬂood events. They are conﬁned to low regions in the landscape. Mineralogical and geochemical analysis of the bleached proﬁles, together with geochemical modelling, suggests that ferrolysis is the most likely cause ofacidity in groundwater leading to the development of the bleach proﬁles and/or alunite. Present-day groundwater tables are both at low levels and sulphate-rich.

40|$|International audienceThe Armorican massif {{is one of}} {{the four}} main variscan basements {{outcropping}} in France. Its geomorphological study has been performed since at least one century with the classical works of E. de Martonne, R. Musset, A. Guilcher, A. Meynier among the other ones. This relief is characterized by numerous planation surfaces, sometimes associated with different types of wethering as laterites, <b>silcretes,</b> calcretes or clays with flints. Surimposed on these surfaces, thin sediments deposits of four different ranges of ages are preserved: Ypresian to Lutetian marine deposits, Bartonian to Rupelian marine to continental sediments preserved in several grabens, Langhian to Serravalian marine deposits and Tortonian to Gelasian marine to continental sediments. These last ones are contemporaneous of a major change of climate, from tropical to temperate, during Late Miocene to Early Pliocene period. We performed a geomorphological study of those surfaces and associated pediments, weatherings and sedimentary deposits. DEM (SRTM, 3 arc-seconds resolution) analysis and field controls were used to produce a macro-geomorphological features map. At least, three types of planation surfaces were defined prior the Late Miocene climate change. They record an overall base level change, which could be due to both tectonic uplift in response to Africa-Iberia-Eurasia convergence and eustasy, and are thereafter listed from high to low levels: i) The Cenomanian high surface, a wave-cut platform surimposed on Lower Cretaceous alterites; ii) The Paleogene pediplains, composed of pediments with some preserved laterites, <b>silcretes</b> and calcretes, which is sealed by Bartonian deposits; iii) The Neogene pediplains and pediments, less weathered and sealed by Langhian to Serravalian deposits.

40|$|International audienceThe {{end of the}} Paleocene epoch (55. 5 Ma) {{was marked}} by an abrupt episode of global warming ("Palaeocene/Eocene Thermal Maximum"; PETM) {{coincident}} with a large perturbation to the global carbon cycle. Because the PETM might represent an analogue in the past of the present anthropogenic accelerated emission of greenhouse gases, it has attracted {{a good deal of}} interest with both data collecting and modeling efforts. Most of the studies focused on ocean records through sediments, we propose here one of the first study on continental records during the PETM. We focus our study on <b>silcretes</b> sampled in north of France, rocks present on the Paleocene-Eocene boundary and on the silicification formed in the porosity during weathering processes. Stable isotopes of Si have been used as proxies for understanding the Si cycle and its variations in the past. Here we analyzed silicon isotopes of in situ quartz using a new generation secondary ion mass spectrometry apparatus. Secondary phases as overgrowths on primary detrital quartz and microcrystals of quartz have been measured. Our results are very unexpected : althought detrital quartz present same values than in other <b>silcretes,</b> secondary phases present very homogenuous signatures far from very negative values that can be reached (- 8 ‰ in [1, 2]). It seems that the origin of silicium is not local as both primary and secondary phases are within the same range. The isotopic fractionnation link to the dissolution/precipitation phase during weathering processes is 1. 5 ‰. The lack of a strongly 30 Si-depleted reservoir with negative isotopic values seem to show a low intenisity of alteration during the PETM in continental context. [1] Basile-Doelsch et al.

Two regional-scale paleosurfaces are recognized: (i) the Infraliassic paleosurface, the truncated weathering profiles of which are sealed by Liassic marine deposits; (ii) the Eocene paleosurface, underlain by thick kaolinite- and iron-rich paleosaprolites and by siliceous duricrusts (<b>silcretes).</b> Quantitative constraints on large-scale tectonic uplift and long-term denudation are obtained from these morphostratigraphic markers.

40|$|The {{geological}} archives record "hyperthermic" crises, {{along with}} their consequences on the biota and physical environment. Among these, the PETM (Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum) is often considered as the closest analogue to the current climate crisis due to its global character and the speeds at which the CO 2 rate and average temperatures increased. The shallow to deep marine environments from various paleolatitudes have been studied intensively (e. g. Aubry et al, 2007), but apart notable paleontological studies, the PETM impact on the terrestrial realm at a regional scale has probably not been studied and integrated enough (Zachos et al,. 2008). Moreover very few studies aimed at checking if the drastic rises of greenhouse gases and temperature had a real impact on the weathering profiles development during the PETM. Such a regional study is proposed in the "Sparnacian" terrestrial and lagoonal units of the Paris Basin, which offers rich and diversified interconnected paleoenvironments, and on its emerged interfluves and borders. The paleoweathering profiles here considered belong to the so-called "Landenian" quartzites, or "Sparnacian" <b>silcretes,</b> and are locally well correlated to the first terrestrial units of the Tienen and Mortemer Fm, between the Upper Thanetian and Lower Ypresian marine units. However some <b>silcretes</b> and ferruginous sandstones are sometimes dated no better than Early Paleogene. To improve the error bar from 25 Ma to 5 Ma would mark a significant progress. Paleomagnetism {{is one of the}} methods useful to improve the uncertainty being often the status of those geological objects. Goethite and hematite, main iron oxides formed in weathering profiles, acquire a chemical remanent magnetization (CRM) {{in the direction of the}} ambient geomagnetic field. Consequently paleomagnetism is often considered as the most suitable method for dating weathering profiles (e. g. Idnurm & Senior, 1978; Ricordel-Prognon et al, 2010). The fossil geomagnetic direction enables one to calculate the virtual magnetic pole (VMP) of the site where magnetic minerals were precipitated. Dating the minerals is then possible by comparing their recorded paleomagnetic poles (VGP) with the apparent polar wander path (APWP) of the continent in which the site is located. In situ weathering profile formed upon the Upper Thanetian glauconitic sands from the Grandglise section (Belgium) have been sampled in details and various analyses have been performed: granulometry, XRD and magnetic mineralogy, petrography, paleomagnetism. Haematite is the main magnetization carrier, directions are well clustered, with a low MAD (maximum angular deviation). However the dating obtained around the Paleocene-Eocene boundary is consistent with the stratigraphic position of the Grandglise paleosol and gives evidence of a fossil weathering, instead of a recent one related to a Neogene to Quaternary re-exposure often invoked for such red and variegated sandstones. Our results and others recently obtained in the neighboring Avesnois help to decipher the correlation between the Grandglise paleosol and surroundings <b>silcretes</b> and to precise the terrestrial paleogeographic evolution on the emerged areas during this critical interval...|$|R

The biogenic accumulation with high content of organic matter and phosphorous was a prime source of the phosphate which formed the phosphate deposits of the Mazıdağ—Derik area. Commonly, currents transported the phosphatic sediments laterally, forming parallel and low angle cross laminations. In some cases, the sea floor was uplifted after upwelling periods. Conse-quently, some phosphate beds underwent karstification, giving rise to phoscretes and <b>silcretes.</b> Ground water percoalating into the karstic realm caused phosphate replacement of many carbonate grains of the shallow water limestone facies. These complex events resulted in the formation of three basic phosphate peloid types in the Mazıdağ-Derik phosphate sequence, which are classified to the following origin of peloids: (1) in situ precipitation; (2) abrasion of phosphatized intraclast and bioclast and (3) phosphate micri-tization of fish bones.

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{theory for}} quartz cementation must account for {{variations in the}} abundance and morphologies of cement in undeformed sandstones {{as well as in}} fractures of all scales. Our approach toward developing such a theory is to extend existing kinetic models by rigorously simulating the crystal growth anisotropy and nucleation surface area. For our analysis we assume that the rate limiting control on quartz cementation is the crystal precipitation rate (Walderhaug 1994, 1996, 2000). In a strict sense this assumption does not address whether the silica is derived from local diffusion or larger scale fluid advection but instead simply considers that dissolved silica is supplied at a rate that equals or exceeds {{the rate at which the}} crystals can precipitate. This assumption is reasonable for quartz cementation in near neutral pH fluids at temperatures in excess of ~ 80 °C but is not applicable to quartz precipitation in highly supersaturated fluids (e. g., in <b>silcretes,</b> saline-alkaline lakes, or in the presence of biogenic opal).

40|$|International audienceHistorically, the NW European basins, {{and more}} {{particularly}} those of the southern North Sea, are the cradle of stratigraphy, where the notion of "Sparnacian" took shape (Dollfus, 1880; Aubry et al., 2005). The Sparnacian facies, mainly continental to coastal, often record paleoweatherings. Towards the Mesozoic cover and old basements which surround the Paris basin, many fluvial sands and conglomerates units seal or incise thick kaolinitic weathering profiles and are themselves weathered, often oxidised, kaolinised and/or silicified. Among those paleoweathering types the <b>silcretes</b> {{are probably the most}} striking geological markers, found for a long time by geologists and geomorphologists who tried to map the "Eocene paleosurface". These <b>silcretes</b> are often ascribed to Late "Landenian" {{to the north of the}} Paris basin and correlated to the Sparnacian continental deposits to the south, west and east. In the best preserved successions (work in progress), those continental facies and weathering profiles lie above or are developed upon Upper Thanetian formations and are overlain by Lower Ypresian marine formations. And in few places, for example in Avesnois, they are the stratigraphic equivalents to fluvial sands which contain lignitic units where the PETM has been recorded (Quesnel et al, 2006). The processes involved in the genesis of these types of weathering are relatively well known in the Paris Basin and its borders (Thiry, 1981; Dupuis & Steurbaut, 1987; Thiry & Simon-Coinçon, 1996; Quesnel et al, 2007) and some appear to be closely linked to effects ascribable to a climate crisis like that of the PETM (marked alternations of flooding, inducing clay illuviation in the porosity and soil cracks, followed by dry phases saturating the ground solutions; acid drainage of highly organic and pyrite-rich sediments, destabilization of kaolinite, etc.; cf. Thiry, 1999). The work exposed here has consisted in 1) compiling, reviewing and validating all available evidence, 2) making new field observations in poorly investigated areas, backed up by augerhole drilling, 3) studying occurrences of paleoweatherings and continental deposits, dating using biostratigraphy, paleomagnetism, and ascribing them to the Lower Eocene paleosurface, 4) using all the data to digitally reconstruct the present geometry of this paleosurface at 1 : 1 000 000 scale, 5) reconstructing the continental paleogeography of the Paris basin and its surroundings during this interval, 6) discussing the geodynamic and climatic processes involved in the development of the paleoweatherings and associated paleosurface.
