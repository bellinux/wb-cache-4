In {{order to reduce the}} operational cost by reducing the fuel consumption, some ships are equipped with solar-wind assisted devices. The lower oils consumption in ships could reduce environmental pollutions and increase cruising range. This study investigates the feasibility of using <b>solar</b> <b>assisted</b> rigid wind–sail as a power saving device on University Malaysia Terengganu’s (UMT) research boat. The attachment of <b>solar</b> <b>assisted</b> rigid wind-sail device may affect the performance, operation and stability of the boat.

Attempts were made to study the feasibility of using <b>solar</b> <b>assisted</b> rigid wind-sail in technical aspects including stability and performance as well as operational and economical aspects. The results of the study shown that the application of <b>solar</b> <b>assisted</b> rigid wind-sail to UMT research boat reduced the annual cost of operation from USD 20390 to USD 17815. 9.

The housing types considered are a 1980 's house, an energy efficient house and a “net zero ready” house. The advanced heat pump systems considered in the analysis focused on coupling solar energy on the evaporator side of an air source and water source heat pumps to improve performance compared to a standard {{air source heat pump}} and provide an alternative to a costly ground source heat pump system.

40|$|One {{way that}} has been {{proposed}} to improve the efficiency of home heating is the <b>solar</b> <b>assisted</b> heat pump. This is a system where a solar collector heats up a storage tank and then a heat pump delivers {{the heat from the}} tank to the house. Theoretically this system has a number of advantages over a standard heat pump or solar system. Heat pumps work better the higher the temperature of their heat source. By getting heat from a tank that is being warmed by a solar collector the heat pump should be able to work more efficiently than if its source was the outdoor air. The performance of a solar collector should also be improved in this system. Solar collectors work best when the fluid running through them is at as Iowa temperature as possible. Normally the fluid in the collector has to be at least as hot as the desired indoor temperature to help heat the house. This is not the case with a <b>solar</b> <b>assisted</b> heat pump system, because the heat pump can move heat from a low temperature source to a high temperature destination. After running computer simulations of a <b>solar</b> <b>assisted</b> system I found that if there is enough collector area this system is more efficient than a standard heat pump system. However, even though this system can be more efficient and save money during the heating season, the savings were not enough to justify the initial investment in the expensive solar equipment.

An economic comparison and global warming impact analysis are conducted among the two kinds of solar thermal systems and traditional water heating systems (i. e. electric water heaters and towngas water heaters). The economic comparison results show that solar thermal systems have greater economic benefits than traditional water heating systems. In addition, conventional SWH systems are comparable with the SAHP systems when solar fractions are above 50 %. Besides, analysis on {{the sensitivity of the}} total equivalent warming impact (TEWI) indicates that the towngas boosted SWH system has the greatest potential in greenhouse gas emission reduction with various solar collector areas and the electricity boosted SWH system has the comparative TEWI with the SAHP systems if its solar fraction is above 50 %. As for SAHP systems, the <b>solar</b> <b>assisted</b> air source heat pump (SA-ASHP) system has the least global warming impact. Based on all investigation results, suggestions are given on the selection of solar thermal systems for applications in Hong Kong. Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|R
