5|$|As Secretary of State in the Obama {{administration}} from 2009 to 2013, Clinton {{responded to the}} Arab Spring, during which she advocated the U.S. military intervention in Libya. She helped organize a diplomatic isolation and international <b>sanctions</b> <b>regime</b> against Iran, {{in an effort to}} force curtailment of that country's nuclear program; this would eventually lead to the multinational Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action agreement in 2015. Leaving office after Obama's first term, she wrote her fifth book and undertook speaking engagements.|$|E

25|$|EU as a {{security}} provider: Management of post Soviet-er{{a security}} tensions in bordering States (Ukraine, Georgia and Balkan States) has exposed deep-rooted structural weaknesses of European Union institutions. European Union's collective response on matters ranging from {{the management of the}} exodus of refugees from war-torn Libya, Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, participation in NATO-led interventions, action against non-State entities (Islamic State & Al-Qaeda), etc. suffers from differing priorities of 28 European Union member States. The paucity of strategic vision within the European Council, nationality-quota based allotment of senior bureaucratic positions within the Institutions of the European Union, and the capacity of minor European countries to unduly influence policy choices of the European Union is problematic. Decision taking by Brussels-based European stake-holders is cumbersome and severely limited due to intra-EU politics and the obsession with Byzantine Community method consensus-based decision making procedures. The Ukrainian crisis exposed the shortcomings of the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) and outlined the limits of German military clout. Public disenchantment with the political outcomes of recent military interventions in Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya has emptied political support for accrued European Union involvement in the Syrian and Ukrainian crisis. Further strengthening of European Union <b>sanctions</b> <b>regime</b> against Russia faces internal dissent from several EU member States (Austria, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Greece, Cyprus, Spain, Hungary, Italy, Portugal, Finland) besides being largely ignored by European multinationals (German and Italian companies have most investment exposure in Russia) who bypass the <b>sanctions</b> <b>regime</b> by trading with Russia via third-countries (Turkey, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Israel). A 2015 Pew Research survey indicated that Europeans are by and large not favourable to a military deployment by their country under the terms of NATO Article 5 to protect a fellow member country which comes under attack.|$|E
25|$|According to the UNESCO Institute for Statistics, {{the number}} of (full-time equivalent) {{researchers}} rose from 711 to 736 per million inhabitants between 2009 and 2010. This corresponds to an increase of more than 2 000 researchers, from 52 256 to 54 813. The world average is 1 083 per million inhabitants. One in four (26%) Iranian researchers is a woman, which {{is close to the}} world average (28%). In 2008, half of researchers were employed in academia (51.5%), one-third in the government sector (33.6%) and just under one in seven in the business sector (15.0%). Within the business sector, 22% of researchers were women in 2013, the same proportion as in Ireland, Israel, Italy and Norway. The number of firms declaring research activities more than doubled between 2006 and 2011, from 30 935 to 64 642. The increasingly tough <b>sanctions</b> <b>regime</b> oriented the Iranian economy towards the domestic market and, by erecting barriers to foreign imports, encouraged knowledge-based enterprises to localize production.|$|E
500|$|In March 2009, Clinton {{presented}} Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov with a [...] "reset button" [...] symbolizing U.S. {{attempts to}} rebuild ties with that country under its new president, Dmitry Medvedev. The photo op was remembered for a mistranslation into Russian. The policy, which {{became known as}} the Russian reset, led to improved cooperation in several areas during Medvedev's time in office, but relations would worsen considerably following Vladimir Putin's return to the position in 2012. In October 2009, on a trip to Switzerland, Clinton's intervention overcame last-minute snags and saved the signing of an historic Turkish–Armenian accord that established diplomatic relations and opened the border between the two long-hostile nations. In Pakistan, she engaged in several unusually blunt discussions with students, talk show hosts and tribal elders, in an attempt to repair the Pakistani image of the U.S. Beginning in 2010, she helped organize a diplomatic isolation and international <b>sanctions</b> <b>regime</b> against Iran, in an effort to force curtailment of that country's nuclear program; this would eventually lead to the multinational Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action being agreed to in 2015.|$|E
40|$|The {{evidence}} in support of the deterrent effect of the certainty of punishment is far more consistent than that for the severity of punishment. However, the {{evidence in}} support of certainty’s effect pertains almost exclusively to apprehension probability. Consequently, the more precise statement is that certainty of apprehension, not the severity of the ensuing legal consequence, is the more effective deterrent. This conclusion has important policy implications among which are that lengthy prison sentences and mandatory minimum sentencing cannot be justified on deterrence. There are four major research gaps. The first concerns the mechanism by which police affect perceptions of the probability of apprehension. The second concerns the inextricable link between the deterrent effect of the threat of punishment and the potentially criminogenic effect of the experience of punishment. The third concerns the concept of a <b>sanction</b> <b>regime</b> defined by the sanctions legally available and how that legal authority is administered. Theories of deterrence conceive of sanctions in the singular not the plural and do not provide a conceptual basis for considering the differential deterrent effects of different components of the <b>sanction</b> <b>regime.</b> The fourth involves sanction risk perceptions. Establishing the link between risk perceptions and <b>sanction</b> <b>regimes</b> is imperative; unless perceptions adjust, however crudely, to changes in the <b>sanction</b> <b>regime,</b> desired deterrent effects will not be achieved...|$|R
30|$|In Germany, {{imposition}} of benefit cuts for non-compliant welfare recipients {{depends on the}} policy of the local welfare agencies resulting in considerable regional variation, expressed in milder and stricter <b>sanction</b> <b>regimes.</b> Findings from international studies show, that benefit sanctions can substantially increase individual employment uptake. This raises the question, whether a stricter use of sanctions will be effective in Germany.

Commenting on the international <b>sanctions</b> <b>regime</b> against Russia, Gabriel stated in early 2015 that “we want to help resolve the conflict in Ukraine but don’t want to force Russia to its knees.” He later suggested that Europe consider easing sanctions in exchange for cooperation in Syria.

2500|$|Drug imports to Iran {{from the}} U.S. and Europe {{decreased}} by approximately 30 percent in 2012, {{according to a}} report by the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. In 2013, The Guardian reported that some 85,000 cancer patients required forms of chemotherapy and radiotherapy that had become scarce. Western governments have built waivers into the <b>sanctions</b> <b>regime</b> to ensure that essential medicines get through, but those waivers conflict with blanket restrictions on banking, as well as bans on [...] "dual-use" [...] chemicals that might have a military as well as a medical application. An estimated 40,000 haemophiliacs cannot get blood-clotting medicines, and operations on haemophiliacs have been virtually suspended because of the risks created by the shortages. An estimated 23,000 Iranians with HIV/AIDS have severely restricted access to the drugs they need. The society representing the 8,000 Iranians suffering from thalassemia, an inherited blood disorder, has said its members are beginning to die because of a lack of an essential drug, deferoxamine, used to control the iron content in the blood. Further, Iran can no longer buy medical equipment such as autoclaves, essential for the production of many drugs, because some of the biggest Western pharmaceutical companies refuse to do business with the country.|$|E

40|$|Abstract 2 Smart {{sanctions}} {{have been a}} frequent but supposedly ineffective UN instrument of conflict resolution {{since the end of}} the Cold War. While most sanctions thinking focuses on sanctions against consolidated states, this paper illustrates how smart sanctions can have an impact in failed states in Sub-Saharan Africa. These failed states are characterised by the lack of a monopoly on violence and plagued by rebellions largely financed through natural resource earnings and foreign support. By analysing the conflicts and respective <b>sanctions</b> <b>regimes</b> and their impact on political support, supply structures and the military balance in Angola and the Democratic Republic of Congo we prove that in particular the advocacy component of smart <b>sanctions</b> <b>regimes</b> – the panel of expert reports and connected diplomatic activities – is able to contribute to their impact.

2500|$|On July 23, 2006 the United States Department of the Treasury {{designated}} Abdelrazik as {{a supporter}} of al-Qaeda and a terrorist, [...] "for his high-level ties to and support for al-Qaeda." [...] According to the Globe and Mail, the U.S. State Department believes, [...] "Mr. Abdelrazik was “closely associated with Abu Zubaydah, Osama bin Laden's lieutenant responsible for recruiting and for al-Qaeda's network of training camps in Afghanistan.” The United States also alleges Mr. Abdelrazik recruited and accompanied a Tunisian extremist named Raouf Hannachi for paramilitary training at a camp in Afghanistan in 1996 “where al-Qaeda and other UN-sanctioned terrorist groups were known to train,” and became personally acquainted with Mr. bin Laden". [...] In April 2011, Wikileaks revealed that a November 2008 U.S. Department of Defence document stated that Abdelrazik had admitted receiving $10 000 from alleged al-Qaeda financier Hassan Zemiri, who was captured in late 2001 in Tora Bora, Afghanistan. [...] However, none of these allegations have been proven {{in a court of}} law and Abdelrazik has never been charged with any crime, in Canada or anywhere else in the world. Eight days after he was designated a terrorist by the US, he was added to the UN Security Council terrorist blacklist (not a no fly list) by the U.S. and is now the only living Canadian on that list. According to the Globe and mail,"any country can nominate anyone they consider to be an islamic extremist. All his personal assets were frozen once he was put on that list. Individuals on the list are subject to a <b>sanctions</b> <b>regime</b> which include an asset freeze and a ban on international travel (but not flight per se). According to a letter sent on April 18, 2008, by the Department of Foreign Affairs to Abousfian Abdelrazik's lawyer, the Canadian government requested the UN's 1267 Committee to remove Abdelrazik from its list of al Qaeda supporters.|$|E
