The local light environment of individual <b>shoots</b> (<b>shoot</b> irradiance) and plants (plant irradiance, defined as the <b>shoot</b> irradiance of the most sunlit <b>shoot</b> of a plant) were ana-lyzed as factors affecting <b>shoot</b> behavior. Daughter <b>shoots</b> that developed under partially sunlit conditions were longer and less leafy than daughter <b>shoots</b> developed under shaded condi-tions. <b>Shoot</b> production increased with increasing <b>shoot</b> irradiance. Terminal <b>shoots</b> receiving 5 % or less of full sun-light produced 0. 67 daughter <b>shoots</b> on average, whereas <b>shoots</b> receiving 10 % or more of full sunlight produced 1. 72 daughter <b>shoots.</b> In terminal <b>shoots</b> receiving 5 % or less of full sunlight, the probability of producing no daughter <b>shoots</b> was about 63 % when other <b>shoots</b> on the plant received 10 % or more of full sunlight, but was < 35 % where {{the rest of the}} plant was also shaded. <b>Shoot</b> death was observed only in <b>shoots</b> re-ceiving 5 % or less of full sunlight. The mortality of shaded <b>shoots</b> was higher in plants growing in high irradiance than in plants growing in low irradiance.

5|$|Neuner's <b>shooting</b> {{performances}} {{have been}} a regular topic in the German media.

She has insisted her difficulties in the standing position are not due to technical weaknesses but psychological, and her training results are just as good as the results of her team mates. She explained in interviews that she had developed a fear of the standing <b>shooting</b> over time, knowing she had to justify herself after the race if she missed. In 2008, Neuner trained with Bundeswehr <b>shooting</b> coach and former large calibre world champion, Rudi Krenn, and subsequently changed her stance slightly. Since 2009, she has worked with a psychologist, primarily focusing on mental techniques to build her confidence on the <b>shooting</b> range.

40|$|Axillary {{meristem}} fate patterns along <b>shoots,</b> {{also referred}} to as <b>shoot</b> structure, appear to be fairly consistent among trees within a genotype growing under similar conditions. Less is known about <b>shoot</b> structural plasticity following external manipulations, such as pruning. The aim of this study on almond (Prunus dulcis (Mill.)) <b>shoots</b> was to investigate how pruning severity affects the structure of 1 -year-old <b>shoots</b> that grew after pruning (regrowth <b>shoots),</b> the 2 -year-old portion of <b>shoots</b> that remained from the previous year's growth after pruning (pruned <b>shoots),</b> and whether regrowth <b>shoots</b> reiterate the structure of the original 1 -year-old <b>shoots</b> before pruning. Three pruning severities were imposed and the structures along the different <b>shoots</b> were assessed by building hidden semi-Markov models of axillary meristem fates. The structures of regrowth and pruned <b>shoots</b> depended on pruning severity, but maintained some of the original <b>shoot</b> characteristics. Regrowth <b>shoots</b> developed more complex structures with severe pruning, but had simpler structures than original <b>shoots</b> indicating progressive simplification with tree age. Pruned <b>shoot</b> structures were affected by the severity of pruning, by the structure when the <b>shoots</b> were 1 year old, and probably by local competition among buds.

5|$|The first <b>shooting</b> medals {{were struck}} {{in honor of}} the Officers' Shoot held in Langenthal, Bern, in 1822. They can usually be {{distinguished}} from <b>shooting</b> thalers by their lack of denomination and difference in weight and often composition, though there is evidence that many of thaler-size did circulate amongst the legal tender coins of Switzerland. <b>Shooting</b> medals were minted in a variety of metals, including silver, bronze, goldene and white metal.|$|E
5|$|The first <b>shooting</b> thalers were cantonal pieces, minted by the {{sovereign}} cantons of Switzerland. All of these pieces, {{as well as}} the 1855 Solothurn issue, were strictly legal tender. Nineteenth-century Confederation <b>shooting</b> thaler issues were minted to legal fineness, and were thus allowed to bear the denomination of five francs. Beginning in 1865, Switzerland {{became a member of the}} Latin Monetary Union. <b>Shooting</b> thalers were not included in the mintages authorized by the Union. Therefore, these issues are commonly considered semi-medallic, though they could circulate due to their size and weight being the same as that of the regular five franc issues. This series of <b>shooting</b> thalers, following the standards of the Latin Monetary Union, began in 1855 with the Solothurn issue and ended in 1885 with the Bern issue. In 1927, the Monetary Union ceased to exist. Mintage began on a new series of <b>shooting</b> thalers in 1934 in honor of the <b>shooting</b> festival in Fribourg, and another design was issued in 1939 for the Lucerne festival. The 1934 issue was the last official <b>shooting</b> thaler that matched the circulating counterpart in both diameter and weight. The 1939 issues were not the same size and weight as their circulating counterparts, but both issues were redeemable only at the <b>shooting</b> festival or participating businesses. Production of <b>shooting</b> thalers was cut short with the outbreak of World War II. In 1984, a new series of <b>shooting</b> thalers began mintage, due largely to the efforts of California-based coin dealer Richard Nelson. These issues, like those minted in 1934 and 1939, are not minted to legal fineness and are not considered legal tender.|$|E

40|$|Summary To {{understand}} {{the development of}} crown struc-ture in Betula platyphylla Sukatch., mortality patterns of long <b>shoots</b> were analyzed quantitatively. We selected 25 saplings growing under various light conditions and measured the rela-tive photosynthetically active radiation (rPAR) at, and the three-dimensional position of, first-order branches. A long <b>shoot</b> was assigned “no buds ” (NB) status if it lacked buds {{at the end of}} the growing season, including at the tips of short <b>shoots.</b> A long <b>shoot</b> was classified as dead if it was NB and all the offspring long <b>shoots</b> issuing from it were NB. The proba-bility that a leafy long <b>shoot</b> (a current-year long <b>shoot</b> with leaves or an older long <b>shoot</b> with short <b>shoots</b> with leaves) would become NB by the end of the season was positively de-pendent on <b>shoot</b> age and branch age, and negatively dependent on <b>shoot</b> length, centripetal <b>shoot</b> order, branch height and rPAR at the branch. Randomization tests revealed that <b>shoots</b> became NB and dead in clusters of connected <b>shoots.</b> In partic-ular, <b>shoot</b> clusters originating from 3 -year-old <b>shoots</b> were more likely to die than expected if each <b>shoot</b> was assumed to become NB regardless of the connection. Stepwise logistic re-gression revealed that the maximum rPAR within the crown of an individual tree had a significant effect on the mortality rate of 3 -year-old <b>shoot</b> clusters, together with the rPAR at the level of the branch and other structural entities. Correlative inhibi-tion is an important mechanism for determining <b>shoot</b> mortal-ity patterns...|$|R

40|$|Basal <b>shoots</b> are the {{vigorous}} <b>shoots</b> {{at the base}} of the plant. In roses, basal <b>shoots</b> determine the potential flower production of the plant. Although many attempts have been made to promote the formation of basal <b>shoots</b> for commercial production, little attention has been paid to the origin and development of these <b>shoots.</b> The present study addresses this by following the development of a rose plant, raised from a cutting. Basal <b>shoots</b> only originated from basal axillary buds and not from adventitious buds. The first basal <b>shoot</b> of a plant emerged from one of the two most basal axillary buds of the primary <b>shoot.</b> The second basal <b>shoot</b> also emerged from an axillary bud of the primary <b>shoot</b> or, sometimes, from an axillary bud of the first basal <b>shoot.</b> If a third basal <b>shoot</b> occurred, it originated from an axillary bud of a basal <b>shoot.</b> The buds, which became the first and second basal <b>shoot,</b> were already present as secondary buds in the axils of the scales of the axillary bud when used for propagation.

A <b>shoot</b> growth chronology was developed {{for each of the}} three size classes, but was not statistically different among them. It is suggested that the size dependency of <b>shoot</b> growth chronology was rather weak or negligible.

The <b>shoot</b> growth chronology was also positively correlated with the temperatures from July to October of the previous year, suggesting that the growth of P. pumila largely depends on the photosynthetic production of the previous year.
