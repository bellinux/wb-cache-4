5|$|In the {{six years}} after Beulah, no <b>seedings</b> were {{conducted}} for several different reasons. In 1964, measurement and observation equipment {{was not ready to}} be used. The year after that, all flights were used for additional experimentation in non-hurricane clouds.|$|E
5|$|The 1982 NFL {{season was}} {{shortened}} from 16 regular season games to 9 {{due to a}} players' strike. For playoff <b>seedings,</b> division standings were ignored and the league used a 16-team tournament format for the season.|$|E
5|$|The <b>seedings</b> into Hurricane Esther {{led to the}} {{establishment}} of Project Stormfury in 1962. Project Stormfury was a joint venture of the United States Department of Commerce and the United States Navy.|$|E
5|$|Multiple eyewalls {{had been}} {{detected}} in very strong hurricanes before, including Typhoon Sarah and Hurricane Donna, although the double eyes were usually seen in very intense systems. Double eyewalls were also seen post-seeding {{in some of}} the seeded storms. At the time however, the only known times that rapid changes in eyewall diameter, other than during presumably successful <b>seedings,</b> was during rapid changes in intensity. It remained controversial whether the <b>seedings</b> caused the secondary eyewalls or whether it was just a natural cycle. Basically, if eyewall changes similar to those observed in seeded hurricanes were rare in unseeded tropical cyclones, it would provide powerful evidence that Project Stormfury was successful. Conversely, if such changes were common in unseeded systems, it would throw doubt on the very hypothesis and assumptions driving Project Stormfury.|$|E
5|$|The <b>seedings</b> {{meant that}} the Senators would play the Maple Leafs {{in the first round}} of the 2004 playoffs for the fourth-straight time. By now, Ottawa had {{developed}} a strong rivalry with their Ontario rivals, and there was a great deal of pressure on the team to finally defeat the Leafs.|$|E
5|$|After Betsy, {{two other}} hurricanes {{came close to}} being seeded. Hurricane Faith was {{considered}} a likely candidate, but it stayed {{out of range of}} the seeding planes. That same year, recon flights were conducted into Hurricane Inez, but there were no <b>seedings.</b> Both the 1967 and 1968 seasons were inactive. Because of that, there were no suitable seeding targets in either of those two seasons.|$|E
5|$|The 2015 tournament {{involved}} twenty nations competing {{over six}} weeks. There were two stages, a pool and a knockout. Nations {{were divided into}} four pools, A through to D, of five nations each. The teams were seeded {{before the start of}} the tournament, with the <b>seedings</b> taken from the World Rankings in December 2012. The four highest-ranked teams were drawn into pools A to D. The next four highest-ranked teams were then drawn into pools A to D, followed by the next four. The remaining positions in each pool were filled by the qualifiers.|$|E
5|$|While {{out to sea}} in August of the 1965 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season, Stormfury meteorologists {{decided that}} Hurricane Betsy was {{a good candidate for}} seeding. However, the storm immediately swung towards land, and on September 1, the planned flights were canceled. For some reason, the press was not notified that there were no <b>seedings,</b> and several newspapers reported that it had begun. As Betsy passed close to the Bahamas and smashed into southern Florida, the public and Congress thought that seeding was underway and blamed Stormfury. It took two months for Stormfury officials to convince Congress that Betsy was not seeded, and the project was allowed to continue. A second candidate, Hurricane Elena, stayed too far out to sea.|$|E
5|$|Fifteen {{of their}} 38 matches {{have been on}} clay which is {{statistically}} Nadal's best surface and Federer's worst, with 13 being in finals. Nadal has a winning record on outdoor hard courts (8–6) and clay (13–2), while Federer leads on grass (2–1) and indoor hard courts (5–1). Because tournament <b>seedings</b> are based on rankings, 24 of their matches have been in tournament finals which have included an all-time record 9 Grand Slam tournament finals. From 2006 to 2008 they played in every French Open and Wimbledon final. Nadal won six of the nine, losing the first two Wimbledon finals. Four of these finals were five set-matches (2007 and 2008 Wimbledon, 2009 and 2017 Australian Open), with the 2008 Wimbledon final being lauded as the greatest match ever by many long-time tennis analysts. Thirteen of their 38 meetings have reached a deciding set. They have also played in 12 Masters Series finals, including their lone five-hour match at the 2006 Rome Masters which Nadal won in a fifth-set tie-break having saved two match points and at the 2005 Miami Masters where Federer came back from 2 sets down to win in nearly 4 hours. They also contested {{the final of the}} ATP World Tour Finals in 2010 with Federer winning in 3 sets. Nadal has defeated Federer on grass in Wimbledon (which is Federer's better surface) but Federer {{has not been able to}} beat Nadal on clay in Roland Garros losing to him several times.|$|E
25|$|The {{knockout}} {{stage of}} the 2000 ICC KnockOut Trophy, following the Pre-Quarter-Finals, was held from 7 to 15 October 2000. The top 5 teams ranked according to 1999 Cricket World Cup <b>seedings</b> qualify for the KnockOut Stage automatically. The remaining three teams qualify from the Pre-Quarter-Finals, which was held from 3 to 5 October, between 6 of the lowest ranked teams according to 1999 Cricket World Cup <b>seedings.</b>|$|E
25|$|Of {{the eight}} teams {{entering}} the stage, the team which was ranked 1st according to 1999 Cricket World Cup <b>seedings</b> play {{the winner of}} Pre-Quarter-Final 1 while the team which was ranked 2nd according to 1999 Cricket World Cup <b>seedings</b> play the winner of Pre-Quarter-Final 2 and so on, in the format R1 v PQF 1, R2 v PQF 2, R3 v PQF 3 and R4 v R5.|$|E
25|$|The {{groups are}} listed below, with <b>seedings</b> (rankings from April 2005) shown in brackets. Each group played {{all of its}} matches at a single ground.|$|E
25|$|In the draws for the quarter-finals onwards, {{there were}} no <b>seedings,</b> and teams from the same group or the same {{association}} could be drawn against each other.|$|E
25|$|The 2000 ICC KnockOut Trophy {{started on}} 3 October and was hosted by Kenya, all the matches were played at Gymkhana Club Ground, Nairobi, Kenya. Eleven teams {{participated in the}} tournament, the top 5 teams ranked {{according}} to 1999 Cricket World Cup <b>seedings</b> qualify for the KnockOut Stage automatically. The remaining three teams qualify from the Pre-Quarter-Finals, which was held from 3 to 5 October, between 6 of the lowest ranked teams according to 1999 Cricket World Cup <b>seedings.</b> The final was played on 15 October 2000 and was a day-nighter contested between India and New Zealand at the Gymkhana Club Ground.|$|E
25|$|For {{the teams}} in the Top Six, {{competition}} points carried over from Round one. All Top Six teams advanced to the quarterfinals, with their <b>seedings</b> determined by their positions {{at the end of}} Round two.|$|E
25|$|The 3 {{division}} {{winners and}} 5 other teams {{with the most}} wins from each conference qualified for the playoffs. The <b>seedings</b> are based on each team's record; however, a division winner is guaranteed to be ranked at least fourth, regardless of record.|$|E
25|$|A total ten matches {{were played}} in the tournament. The top 5 teams ranked {{according}} to 1999 Cricket World Cup <b>seedings</b> qualify for the KnockOut Stage automatically. The remaining three teams qualify from the Pre-Quarter-Finals, which was held from 3 to 5 October, between 6 of the lowest ranked teams according to 1999 Cricket World Cup <b>seedings.</b> Australia, Pakistan, South Africa, New Zealand and Zimbabwe qualified for the KnockOut Stage automatically, while India, Sri Lanka and England qualified from Pre-Quarter-Finals beating Kenya, West Indies and Bangladesh respectively. India faced Australia, Sri Lanka faced Pakistan and England faced South Africa in the Quarter-Finals. India, Pakistan, New Zealand and South Africa defeated Australia, Sri Lanka, Zimbabwe and England respectively in the Quarter-Finals, and qualified for the Semi-Finals.|$|E
25|$|The SuperSonics were rivals of the Los Angeles Lakers, {{particularly}} {{due to the}} teams' longstanding pairing in the Pacific Division of the Western Conference. The Lakers' sustained success meant {{regular season}} games often impacted NBA Playoffs <b>seedings,</b> with the teams matching up head-to-head for numerous playoff battles.|$|E
25|$|The three conference {{winners and}} the three best {{performed}} of the remaining teams would qualify for a three-week finals series, with <b>seedings</b> deciding the match-ups. This system is a hybrid of the conference-based qualification system favoured by the SARU and the 'top six' model favoured by the ARU and NZRU.|$|E
25|$|Ten {{former world}} champions {{competed in the}} tournament. Peter Ebdon, Steve Davis, and Ken Doherty lost in the {{qualifying}} rounds, but Graeme Dott successfully qualified for the last 32. Six other former champions (John Higgins, Shaun Murphy, Ronnie O'Sullivan, Neil Robertson, Mark Selby, and Mark Williams) automatically qualified {{by virtue of their}} top-16 <b>seedings.</b>|$|E
25|$|Only {{one team}} from each {{national}} association {{was allowed to}} enter. However, if one or more nations did not take up their place, the possibility was left open for nations {{to have a second}} entrant. <b>Seedings</b> and entry were determined by each association. Teams from the weakest federations entered at the first round stage, while those from mid-level federations entered in the second round, and those from the strongest federations entered in the third round.|$|E
25|$|The Super 8s {{consisted}} of two groups: Group E and Group F. Group E {{consisted of}} A1, B2, C1, D2 and Group F consisted of A2, B1, C2, D1, where X1 is the first seed from Group X and X2 is the second seed from Group X. The <b>seedings</b> were based on performance in the last ICC T20 (2007). If a non-seeded team knocks out a seeded team, the non-seeded team inherits the seed of the team it knocked out.|$|E
25|$|The draw was {{conducted}} in December 2008 and used the World Rankings as of 1 December 2008, after the Northern Hemisphere Autumn internationals. The teams were placed into three bands depending on their <b>seedings</b> at the time, with one team from each band {{in each of the}} pools. The rankings and bands were therefore: New Zealand (1), South Africa (2), Australia (3) and Argentina (4); Wales (5), England (6), France (7) and Ireland (8); Scotland (9), Fiji (10), Italy (11) and Tonga (12).|$|E
25|$|The 3 {{division}} {{winners and}} 5 other teams {{with the most}} wins from each conference qualify for the playoffs. The <b>seedings</b> are based on each team's record; however, a division winner is guaranteed to be ranked at least 4th, regardless of record. All series are in a best-of-7 format with the Games 1–2, 5 and 7 on the home court of {{the team with the}} better record, regardless of their seed. For the NBA Finals, the team with the better record plays Games 1–2 and 6–7 at home.|$|E
25|$|The tournament {{was held}} in a direct {{knock-out}} format and involved all of the test playing countries of the time. There were 9 countries eligible which meant that 2 countries would play a qualifier knockout to determine the final 8 teams. Initially, {{it was announced that}} the 9 teams would be ranked according to the 1996 Cricket World Cup <b>seedings.</b> However, the draw that was eventually released appeared to have been tweaked in favour of some of the teams with larger followings and saw New Zealand play Zimbabwe in order to qualify for the main draw.|$|E
25|$|Needing {{only one}} win to clinch a playoff spot, D.C. United's five-game MLS winless streak {{stretched}} to six games when the Montreal Impact's new star addition, Didier Drogba scored twice {{early in the}} first half, and United's anemic attack failed to answer. The loss left United only 3 points ahead of the Impact, who still held the final playoff slot, but also having played two fewer games than D.C. Toronto FC held the 5th slot, 2 points behind D.C. Orlando City SC remained outside of the playoff <b>seedings,</b> in seventh place, 7 points behind D.C., with 3 games remaining for both teams.|$|E
25|$|Although it was {{reported}} in the build-up to the final draw that <b>seedings</b> would be used, as had been the case at the previous two World Cup Finals, the FIFA Organising Committee ultimately announced {{that there would be no}} seeding of teams. Instead the sixteen teams were divided into four 'geographical groupings', which also took into account the teams' strengths and even political considerations; the system ensured that Israel and Morocco would not be drawn to face each other after Morocco had earlier threatened to withdraw from the tournament, as they had done from the Olympic football tournament two years earlier, if that were the case.|$|E
25|$|His {{first major}} final {{came in the}} 2000 World Masters where he beat such players as Peter Manley and Colin Monk before {{eventually}} narrowly falling to John Walton 2 sets to 3. King went into the 2002 BDO World Darts Championship as number 4 in the event <b>seedings</b> and reached the final, losing to Australian Tony David. King beat Raymond van Barneveld in the quarter-finals 5–3 whilst averaging 101.67 before beating Colin Monk in the semi-finals to reach his first World Championship final. As well as winning £24,000 for reaching the final, he also earned a further £2,000 for a 170 finish, the highest checkout in the tournament.|$|E
25|$|Since 2014 the Conference Quarterfinals {{consists}} of four match-ups in each conference, based on the <b>seedings</b> division-wise (# 1 vs. # 4, and # 2 vs. # 3). The division winner with {{the best record in}} the conference plays the lowest wild-card seed, while the other division winner plays the top wild-card seed (wild-card teams, who are de facto 4th seeds, may cross over to another division within the conference). In the Conference Semifinals, the four remaining teams in the conference face each other. In the third round, the Conference Finals, the two surviving teams play each other, with the conference champions proceeding to the Stanley Cup Final.|$|E
25|$|The Super 8s stage {{consists}} of the top two teams from each group of the group stage. The teams are split into two groups, Groups E and F. Group E will consist of the top seed from Groups A and C, and the second seed of groups B and D. Group F will consist of the top seed from Groups B and D, and the second seed of groups A and C. The <b>seedings</b> used are those allocated {{at the start of}} the tournament and are not affected by group stage results, with the exception of if a non-seeded team knocks out a seeded team, the non-seeded team inherits the seed of the knocked-out team.|$|E
25|$|The {{draw for}} the UEFA Euro 2012 {{qualifying}} competition {{took place in}} Warsaw on 7 February 2010. Fifty-one teams entered {{to compete for the}} fourteen remaining places in the finals, alongside co-hosts Poland and Ukraine. The teams were divided into nine groups, with the draw using the new UEFA national team coefficient {{for the first time in}} order to determine the <b>seedings.</b> As defending champions, Spain was automatically top seeded. The qualifying process began in August 2010 and concluded in November 2011. At the conclusion of the qualifying group stage in October 2011, the nine group winners qualified automatically, along with the highest ranked second placed team. The remaining eight-second placed teams contested two-legged play-offs, and the four winners qualified for the finals.|$|E
25|$|As tournament <b>seedings</b> {{are based}} on rankings, 24 of their matches have been in tournament finals, {{including}} an all-time record nine Grand Slam tournament finals. From 2006 to 2008, they played in every French Open and Wimbledon final, and also met in the title match of the 2009 Australian Open, the 2011 French Open and the 2017 Australian Open. Nadal won six of the nine, losing the first two Wimbledon finals. Four of these matches were five-set matches (2007 and 2008 Wimbledon, 2009 and 2017 Australian Open), and the 2008 Wimbledon final has been lauded as the greatest match ever by many long-time tennis analysts. Nadal is the only player who has competed and won against Federer in the final of a Grand Slam on all three surfaces (grass, hard, and clay).|$|E
25|$|Both the men's and ladies' singles {{consist of}} 128 players. Players and doubles pairs are {{admitted}} to the main events {{on the basis of}} their international rankings, with 104 direct entries into the men's and 108 into the ladies' competitions. Both tournaments have 8 wild card entrants, with the remainder in each made up of qualifiers. Since the 2001 tournament 32 players have been given <b>seedings</b> in the Gentlemen's and Ladies' singles, 16 teams in the doubles events. The system of seeding was introduced during the 1924 Wimbledon Championships. This was a simplified version allowing countries to nominate four players who were placed in different quarters of the draw. This system was replaced for the 1927 Wimbledon Championships and from then on players were seeded on merit. The first players to be seeded as no. 1 were René Lacoste and Helen Wills.|$|E
25|$|Next, Federer {{attempted}} {{to defend his}} title at the Wimbledon Championships. Since Wimbledon has a different formula for <b>seedings</b> based on grass-court achievements, Federer was seeded first above world no. 1 Rafael Nadal. In the first round, Federer won for the 200th occasion in Grand Slam matches as he came from two sets down to beat Alejandro Falla, who served for the match in the fourth set at that time, but Falla took Federer to another set before Federer won in a quick fifth set. Federer beat Ilija Bozoljac in four sets. He next faced Arnaud Clément and had a straight-set victory. In the fourth round, Federer defeated no. 16 seed Jürgen Melzer. In the quarterfinals, he faced Tomáš Berdych, but lost in four sets. With this defeat, Federer became ranked no. 3 {{at the end of}} Wimbledon, which was his lowest ranking since November 10, 2003.|$|E
25|$|Little over a {{year into}} WFTDA membership, Blue Ridge {{qualified}} for WFTDA Playoffs for the first time, qualifying for the first-ever Division 2 Playoff in Des Moines, Iowa. The third seed at Des Moines, Blue Rudge won their first-ever WFTDA Playoff game 188-120 over Duke City Derby (Albuquerque), and followed that with a semifinal, 179-170 victory against Treasure Valley Rollergirls (Boise), thus earning a trip to WFTDA Championships later in the year. In the Des Moines final, Blue Ridge fell 2018-113 to Jet City Rollergirls (Everett, Washington) to finish in second place. At Championships in Milwaukee, Blue Ridge won the third place game against Sac City Rollers (Sacramento) 215-188. In 2014, Blue Ridge was ranked at 41st place when tournament <b>seedings</b> were determined, but after a high-ranked team declined their invitation to Playoffs this allowed Blue Ridge to compete at Division 1 Playoffs instead. As the tenth seed in Sacramento, Blue Ridge lost all their games and finished in tenth place.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, King {{had another}} {{successful}} year {{as he reached}} two semi-finals and two finals, winning one, in the four BDO majors. He began the year ranked third in the <b>seedings</b> {{for the second consecutive}} year. In the 2004 BDO World Darts Championship, he narrowly beat Ritchie Davies 5 sets to 4 in the quarter finals before convincingly beating Tony O'Shea in the semi-finals 5–1. Despite this he lost in the final {{for the second time in}} three years losing to Andy Fordham 3 sets to 6. After his good World Championship form he went on to reach the semi-finals of the 2004 International Darts League and World Darts Trophy narrowly losing to Tony David and Martin Adams 8–9 and 4–5 respectively. He ended the year winning his first BDO Major in the World Masters as he beat Tony David in the semi-finals 6–2 before winning the tournament prevailing against Tony O'Shea in a tight encounter which ended 7–6 in favour of King handing him his first major title after his sixth final.|$|E
