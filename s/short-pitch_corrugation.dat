30|$|The {{model in}} this paper is valid up to 1500  Hz in wheel–rail {{interaction}} analysis, {{which can be used}} for investigation of specific interaction problems, e.g. rail <b>short-pitch</b> <b>corrugation.</b> However, for problems related to higher-frequency range, e.g. rolling noise problem, the model of the track still needs to be improved. Future developments of this work will be addressed to further expanding the frequency range of validity of the train–track interaction model, by introducing a more detailed track model based on solid FEM in a moving reference.|$|E
40|$|Short-pitch rail {{corrugation}} {{that may}} develop {{on the low}} (inner) rail on small radius curves causes increased noise and vibration levels on railway networks worldwide. In lack of a generally applicable treatment, track authorities are forced to run expensive rail grinding programs {{on a regular basis}} to manage these problems. This thesis presents the first stages {{in the development of a}} simulation model for the prediction of rail corrugation growth on small radius curves. By gaining a deeper understanding of the complex dynamic wheel–rail interaction phenomena that lead to corrugation growth, preventive actions may be assessed and implemented. In two separate studies, wear modelling and simulation of dynamic vehicle–track interaction have been considered. A method for the calibration of a wear model using measurement data from a wheel–rail test rig is demonstrated. In terms of worn-off area and profile shape, good quantitative agreement between measured and predicted rail profiles is shown. A time-domain model for the simulation of dynamic interaction between a vehicle and a curved railway track is presented. The simulation model is able to simultaneously capture the low-frequency vehicle dynamics due to curving and the high-frequency track dynamics due to excitation by for example <b>short-pitch</b> <b>corrugation</b> on the low rail. The functionality of the model is demonstrated in several numerical examples. A significant influence of the track and wheelset structural flexibilities on the normal and tangential wheel–rail contact forces is concluded. For a track taken as rigid, the proposed model is validated versus a commercial software. To collect data for later use in the validation of the rail corrugation growth prediction tool, a measurement campaign has been performed. The development of corrugation on a 120 m radius curve on the Stockholm metro was monitored by repeated measurements of rail roughness and train pass-by noise. Within a rail grinding interval of one year, severe <b>short-pitch</b> <b>corrugation</b> was generated on the low rail of the curve with maximum peak-to-peak magnitudes of about 0. 15 mm...|$|E
40|$|The Cologne-egg {{fastening}} systems applied in metro lines, {{which can be}} subjected to rail corrugation, are considered in this paper. To understand the mechanism of the formation and development of rail corrugation, dynamic models of the wheel and the track with Cologne-egg fastening system in the frequency domain are developed to analyse the wheel and track vibration behaviour. A field test is also analysed to verify {{the validity of the}} mechanism. Using these experimental and theoretical results, the vibration mode of the rail that is responsible for rail corrugation is determined. Based on the results, a novel rail damper that can suppress the track pinned-pinned resonance and smooth the track receptance is presented to minimize <b>short-pitch</b> rail <b>corrugation.</b> It is ultimately found from theoretical simulation and experimental investigation that the application of the rail damper is a long-term and effective method of controlling <b>short-pitch</b> rail <b>corrugation</b> in metro lines...|$|R
30|$|A {{technique}} utilising accelerometer measurements {{taken on}} standard operating bogies {{was accepted as}} a quick track condition inspection of a subway [10] with a particular focus on <b>short-pitch</b> rail <b>corrugation.</b> A diagnostic tool, based on the wavelet transform, was able to detect and to quantify the wheel-flat defect of a test train [11] at various speeds and can accurately measure the train speed. Only one accelerometer was required to provide results in real time.|$|R
30|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to define a wheelset–track {{interaction}} model valid in a frequency range up to 1500  Hz and hence suitable for the investigation of typical problems related to high-frequency train–track interaction such as <b>short-pitch</b> rail <b>corrugation.</b> To this aim, a new coupling of a full rotating flexible wheelset model together with a discrete supported Timoshenko finite element track model is developed. The wheelset model is developed using a Eulerian approach [14]. The equations of wheelset motion are deducted using virtual work principal, and the convergence of the model is guaranteed using integral by parts, which has not been treated in previous work. The track model describes displacement and rotation of both vertical and lateral directions. The results of this new model are presented by comparing the running behaviours under different model configurations.|$|R
30|$|Imperfections {{that occur}} at the wheel/rail contact, due to {{geometrical}} changes {{in the shape of}} rail and wheel surfaces, influence the stress distribution. In fact, the presence of these imperfections alters the pressure in the contact nominal area; this generated dynamic stress excites all the elements of the rail track system and propagates from the track through the ground, in the range of frequency excitation. Railhead irregularities occur {{on the surface of the}} rail: the profile can be worn, the railhead damaged by cracks from rolling contact fatigue phenomenon (RCF) [6], squats can take place [7], and further, <b>short-pitch</b> <b>corrugation</b> and rail welds create periodic occurrences [8, 9]. The rail corrugation on rail surface is very frequent in all railway infrastructures and is also classified as short-wave defect (long wavelength irregularities are, instead, defined as irregularities of wavelengths of 300  mm or longer, that may be either geometric irregularities in the track or on the wheel, or irregularities of the track stiffness [10]).|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of periodic irregularities with distinct wavelengths (corrugation) {{on the low}} rail of small radius curves is studied through mathematical modelling, numerical simulations, field measurements and laboratory investigations. One year of monitoring of roughness on the low rail of a 120 m radius curve on the metro of Stockholm Public Transport (SL) showed severe growth of rail corrugation with wavelengths of about 5 cm and 8 cm. About 300 days after rail grinding, the corrugation was observed to reach a constant amplitude. Based on a section removed from the corrugated rail, a laboratory investigation showed plastic deformation in the lateral direction towards the field side. No significant difference in microstructure was found when corrugation troughs and peaks were compared. A time-domain model for the prediction of long-term roughness growth on curves has been developed and validated versus field measurements. The simulation model is able to simultaneously capture the low-frequency vehicle dynamics due to curving and the high-frequency dynamics due to excitation by for example <b>short-pitch</b> <b>corrugation.</b> Non-Hertzian and non-steady effects in the wheelrail contact are considered.

Simulations show that the <b>short-pitch</b> <b>corrugation</b> on the small radius curve at SL is generated by wear induced by the leading wheelset of passing bogies. The corrugation wavelengths 5  cm and 8  cm {{are determined by the}} excitation of the first antisymmetric and first symmetric bending eigenmodes of the wheelset, respectively. The importance of accounting for the phase difference between the calculated wear and the present rail irregularity in predictions of corrugation growth is demonstrated. Due to a phase difference approaching a low constant value, the growth of corrugation is predicted to eventually develop into a stationary state where it is translated along the rail with a constant amplitude. For track geometry and traffic conditions corresponding to the selected curve at SL, simulations indicate the wheel–rail friction coefficient to have a significant influence on corrugation growth. For friction coefficient 0. 6 (measured at dry contact conditions), corrugation growth is predicted at several wavelengths whereas for friction coefficient 0. 3 (due to application of a friction modifier) it is shown that an initial rail irregularity is gradually worn off by passing traffic. Based on a new set of field measurements in the same curve (another year of monitoring), it was shown that the application of a friction modifier directly after grinding is an effective mitigation measure to prevent the {{development of}} rail corrugation...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA {{fracture}} mechanics based fatigue index for rolling contact fatigue (RCF) initiated at deep (10 – 25 mm) defects is derived and employed {{together with a}} fatigue index for more shallow (4 – 10 mm) subsurface RCF initiation. Integrated simulations of high-frequency dynamic train–track interaction and prediction of RCF impact are then carried out to evaluate the influence of <b>short-pitch</b> rail <b>corrugation</b> on RCF of railway wheels. Parametric studies are carried out to identify operational conditions likely to generate high RCF impact. Simulation results show how rail corrugation causes a major increase in RCF impact at high-speed operations and that corrugation magnitudes measured in-field are sufficient to generate subsurface initiated RCF. At high speeds the main cause for increased fatigue impact is the increase in dynamic load magnitudes. At lower speeds and higher axle loads also the effect of poor contact geometry will have an influence...|$|R
40|$|The {{influences}} of train speed and rail roughness level on rolling noise and subsurface initiated rolling contact fatigue (RCF) impact are studied. In particular, {{the consequences of}} <b>short-pitch</b> rail <b>corrugation</b> on tangent track with wavelengths in the interval 3 – 8 cm are simulated using models of dynamic vehicle–track interaction. Based on the calculated results, a criterion {{in terms of a}} limit for maximum levels of rail roughness can be determined. Such a criterion may be useful for planning of rail grinding intervals if used together with a system for regular monitoring of rail roughness levels. It is concluded that the importance of controlling rail roughness increases with increasing train speed. Increasing axle loads on freight vehicles from 22. 5 tonnes to 30 tonnes leads to a significant increase in RCF impact. In operational practice, this is usually compensated for by introducing more conformal wheel–rail profile combinations. Calculated vertical wheel–rail contact forces and rolling noise levels show good agreement with field measurement...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A {{numerical}} procedure to integrate simulation of high-frequency dynamic train– track interaction and prediction of rolling contact fatigue (RCF) impact is presented. Features of the included models and possibilities of applications are outlined. The influence of <b>short-pitch</b> rail <b>corrugation</b> and wheel out-of-roundness (OOR) on RCF of a high-speed passenger train is investigated. It is shown how the corrugation and the OOR {{will have a}} profound effect in that levels of wheel and rail irregularities that have been measured in the field may be sufficient to generate subsurface-initiated RCF. In particular, the high-frequency content of the contact forces is of importance. Errors induced by neglecting such high-frequency com-ponents in measurements and/or simulations are investigated by comparing RCF indices based on contact forces that have been low-pass filtered with various cut-off frequencies. To avoid cracking due to RCF, a maximum roughness level in the wavelength interval up to 10 cm is sought. To limit the effects of corrugation, grinding practices have been altered leading to a significant decrease in RCF...|$|R
40|$|Short-pitch rail {{corrugation}} developing {{on the low}} rail {{in sharp}} curves is a problem experienced by many railway networks worldwide. Because of the large existence of small radius curves, metro lines are particularly affected. This case study is performed {{as part of a}} project which aims at developing a numerical tool for prediction of rail corrugation growth on curves. The development of corrugation on a 120 m radius curve of the Stockholm metro has been monitored by repeated measurements of rail roughness and train pass-by noise. Within a grinding interval of 1 year, severe <b>short-pitch</b> <b>corrugation</b> was build up with maximum peak-to-peak magnitudes of about 0. 15 mm. Spectral analysis of measurement data shows large roughness magnitudes in the wavelength interval 4 - 14 cm, with peaks at approximately 5 cm and 8 cm. The corrugation pattern has a pure longitudinal direction (with corrugation ridges transverse to the track direction) and an irregularly varying magnitude along the 100 m long measured track section. The roughness growth rate increased with time until 300 days after rail grinding, thereafter only moderate additional roughness growth was observed. Because of moderate train speeds of about 30 km/h, the rolling noise caused by the corrugation has a low-frequency content (< 200 Hz). A 10. 1 dB unit increase (139 - 300 days after grinding) in roughness level in the wavelength interval 4 - 14 cm was found to correspond to an increase in rolling noise level in the frequency interval 60 - 200 Hz of 4. 9 dB. In dry weather conditions, discomfort related to pass-by noise is rather linked to the occurrence of wheel squealing than to rolling noise...|$|E
40|$|A time-domain {{method for}} the {{simulation}} of general three-dimensional dynamic interaction between a vehicle and a curved railway track, accounting for a prescribed relative wheel-rail displacement excitation {{in a wide}} frequency range (up to several hundred Hz), is presented. The simulation model is able to capture the low-frequency vehicle dynamics simultaneously due to curving and the high-frequency track dynamics due to the excitation by, for example, the <b>short-pitch</b> <b>corrugation</b> on the low rail. The adopted multibody dynamics formulation considers inertia forces, such as centrifugal and Coriolis forces, {{as well as the}} structural flexibility of vehicle and track components. To represent a wheel/rail surface irregularity, isoparametric two-dimensional elements able to describe generally curved surface shapes are used. The computational effort is reduced by including only one bogie in the vehicle model. The influence of the low-frequency vehicle dynamics of the remaining parts of the vehicle is considered by pre-calculated look-up tables of forces and moments acting in the secondary suspension. For a track model taken as rigid, good agreement is observed between the results calculated with the presented model and a commercial software. The features of the model are demonstrated by a number of numerical examples. The influence of the structural flexibility of the wheelset and track on wheel-rail contact forces is investigated. For a discrete rail irregularity excitation, it is shown that the longitudinal creep force is significantly influenced by the wheelset eigenmodes. The introduction of a velocity-dependent friction law is found to induce an oscillation in the tangential contact force on the low rail with a frequency corresponding to the first anti-symmetric torsional mode of the wheelset. Further, under the application of driving moments on the two wheelsets and excitation by a discrete irregularity on the high rail, the frequency content of the tangential contact forces on the low rail is significantly influenced by the P 2 resonance as well as by several wheelset eigenmodes...|$|E
40|$|As {{it is well}} known, {{there are}} various {{phenomena}} related to railway train–track interaction, some of them caused by the high frequency dynamics of the system, such as rolling noise when the vehicle runs over the track, as well as squeal noise and <b>short-pitch</b> rail <b>corrugation</b> for curved tracks. Due to these phenomena and some others unsolved so far, a large effort has been made over the last 40 years in order to define suitable models to study the train–track interaction. The introduction of flexibility in wheelset and rail models was required {{to have a more}} realistic representation of the wheel–rail interaction effects at high frequencies. In recently published train–track interaction models, the rails are modelled by means of Timoshenko beam elements, valid up to 1. 5 kHz for lateral rail vibration and up to 2 kHz for vertical vibration. This confines the frequency range of validity for the complete train–track model to 1. 5 kHz. With the purpose of extending the range of validity above 1. 5 kHz, a 3 D track model based on the Moving Element Method (MEM) is developed in this paper to replace the Timoshenko beam considered in earlier studies, adopting cyclic boundary conditions and Eulerian coordinates. The MEM approach considers a mobile Finite Element (FE) mesh which moves with the vehicle, so the mass of the rail ‘flows’ with the vehicle speed but in the opposite direction through the mesh. Therefore, the MEM permits to fix the contact area {{in the middle of a}} finitely long track and to refine the mesh only around the contact area, where the forces and displacements will be more significant. Additionally, a modal approach is adopted in order to reduce the number of degrees of freedom of the rail model. Both strategies lower substantially the computational cost. Simulation results are presented and discussed for different excitation sources including random rail roughness and singularities such as wheel flats. All the simulation cases are carried out for a Timoshenko beam and a 3 D MEM track model in order to point out the differences in the contact forces above the range of validity of the Timoshenko beam...|$|R
