40|$|The new gel-sublimation {{technique}} for preparation porus biodegradable scaffolds (hydroxybutyrate-co-hydro- xyvalerate) is presented. The scaffolds with multi-mode internal structure have the of porus sizes varied from ~ 100 microns up to ~ 100 nanometers and the porosity {{in a range}} of 80 – 90 %. A few techniques for modi fi cation of 3 D scaffolds by gas discharge plasma are developed and optimized: the microsecond dielectric barrier dischar- ge, the <b>semi-self-maintained</b> <b>discharge</b> supported by an electron beam; the nanosecond dielectric barrier dischar- ge. Biological tests including red blood cell hemolysis and cytotoxicity analysis have shown the possibilities of scaffolds applications for cell-based technologies.   </div...|$|E
40|$|Creating {{high-power}} CO 2 -laeers by {{a combined}} excitation way that stimulated further improving of this method and further research of discharge characteriatics is perspective [1, 2, 3, 4,]The combination of both the pulse self-maintained and the main <b>semi-self-maintained</b> <b>discharges</b> {{are used in the}} combined excitation methode. The self-maintained diacharge is produced by a high-voltage short time pulse source to create plasma with an electron density required. The main <b>semi-self-maintain</b> <b>discharge</b> requires lower voltage on the electrodes. Usually the large inductor being used as a decoupling element prohibits shunting of a high voltage pulse circuit by the main discharge source [2, 4]. The presence of the decoupling elements makes the discharge characteristics worse. There is our concept in which two high voltage pulae sources are used, their own currents flowing in the opposite direction. It enabled us {{to get rid of the}} decoupling elements and to csrry on the energetic data researches of the combine discharge at a high input energy density into nitrogen of an average pressure. The circuit scheme of this device is shown in fig. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{control of}} planar {{magnetron}} sputtering system operating modes by additional anode magnetic field was investigated. It was shown that additional anode magnetic field substantially affects to planar magnetron-sputtering system (MSS) balancing and allows adjusting the electron fluxes intensity {{to the operating}} surface. It was experimentally shown that the magnetic field intensity increasing stabilizes the low-current discharge. The magnetic field intensity increasing prevents the discharge extinction by the ignition of <b>semi-self-maintained</b> magnetron-type <b>discharge</b> in transverse anode magnetic field...|$|R
