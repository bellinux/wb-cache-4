40|$|A local {{electrical}} system having an <b>electrical</b> <b>generator</b> {{is connected to}} an <b>electrical</b> <b>generator</b> network. The local {{electrical system}} has a controller to avoid the non-detection zone of loss-of-mains relays. The controller is arranged to monitor the real power flow from the <b>electrical</b> <b>generator</b> network to the local electrical system and {{to determine if the}} absolute value of the real power flow is below a first predetermined value to determine if there is a close match between the power requirements of the local electrical system and the <b>electrical</b> <b>generator.</b> If there is a close match, then the controller is arranged to monitor the reactive power flow the same way. If there is a close match also with the reactive power, then the controller is arranged to adjust the target reactive power output from the <b>electrical</b> <b>generator</b> of the local electrical system...|$|R

50|$|The {{engine is}} {{provided}} with an auxiliary shaft that can transmit power {{from one of the}} main shafts of the engine to a gearbox mounted on the engines external casing. The gearbox in turn drives various <b>electrical</b> <b>generators</b> and hydraulic pumps. A single <b>electrical</b> <b>generator</b> could be driven by the gearbox. During an event of failure from the generator, there would, be an interruption in the supply of electrical power to the engine and the aircraft. In a multiengine aircraft an interruption may be acceptable for a few moments but for an aircraft that is required to fly a long distance, it would be necessary for the gearbox to drive an addition <b>electrical</b> <b>generator</b> for back up reasons. Thus, duplication of <b>electrical</b> power <b>generators</b> leads to difficulties in positioning the gearbox and heavy modifications to the gearbox.|$|R

Small turbines are pointed by a simple wind vane, while large turbines generally use a wind sensor coupled with a servomotor.

50|$|Modern {{aircraft}} generally use RATs only in an emergency. In case of {{the loss}} of both primary and auxiliary power sources the RAT will power vital systems (flight controls, linked hydraulics and also flight-critical instrumentation). Some RATs produce only hydraulic power, which is in turn used to power <b>electrical</b> <b>generators.</b> In some early aircraft (including airships), small RATs were permanently mounted and operated a small <b>electrical</b> <b>generator</b> or fuel pump.|$|R
50|$|Diesel rotary {{uninterruptible}} {{power supply}} devices (DRUPS) combine the functionality of a battery-powered or flywheel-powered UPS and a diesel generator. When mains electricity supply is within specification, an <b>electrical</b> <b>generator</b> with a mass functions as motor to store kinetic energy in an electro-mechanical flywheel. In combination with a reactor or choke coil, the <b>electrical</b> <b>generator</b> also works as active filter {{for all sorts of}} power quality problems, like harmonics, RFI, and frequency variations. When mains electricity supply fails, stored energy in the flywheel is released to drive the <b>electrical</b> <b>generator,</b> which continues to supply power without interruption. At the same time (or with some delay, for example 2 to 11 seconds, to prevent the diesel engine from starting at every incident), the diesel engine takes over from the flywheel to drive the <b>electrical</b> <b>generator</b> to make the electricity required. The electro-magnetic flywheel can continue to support the diesel generator in order to keep a stable output frequency. Typically a DRUPS will have enough fuel to power the load for days or even weeks in the event of failure of the mains electricity supply.|$|R
