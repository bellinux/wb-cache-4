5|$|On April 18, 1989, a {{group of}} 39 women went into the Pittston Coal {{headquarters}} and held a 36‑hour <b>sit-down</b> <b>strike.</b> The women stated {{that they would not}} leave until a contract was signed. When questioned by police and media reporters to give up their names, the women responded by saying that they were daughters of Mother Jones. The Daughters gained the attention of the media and completely halted production at Pittston for an entire day and a half. The women involved were not members of the UMWA but wanted to support their cause, and due to this they were linked to the UMWA and considered by some {{to be a part of}} the union.|$|E
5|$|The strikes {{reached the}} {{politically}} sensitive Baltic Sea coast, with a <b>sit-down</b> <b>strike</b> at the Lenin Shipyard in Gdańsk beginning on 14 August. Among {{the leaders of}} this strike were Anna Walentynowicz and Lech Wałęsa, a long-fired shipyard electrician who headed the strike committee. A list of 21 demands was formulated by the Inter-Enterprise Strike Committee on 17 August. The strike wave spread along the coast, closing the ports and bringing the economy to a halt. With {{the assistance of the}} activists from the KOR, and the support of many intellectuals (an Expert Commission was established to aid with the negotiations), the workers occupying the various factories, mines and shipyards across Poland organized as a united front. They were not limiting their efforts to seeking economic improvements, but made and stuck to the crucial demand, an establishment of trade unions independent of government control. Among other issues raised were rights for the Church, the freeing of political prisoners and an improved health service.|$|E
25|$|The 1936–1937 Flint <b>sit-down</b> <b>strike</b> against General Motors (also {{known as}} the General Motors <b>sit-down</b> <b>strike,</b> the great GM <b>sit-down</b> <b>strike,</b> and other variants) changed the United Automobile Workers (UAW) from a {{collection}} of isolated locals {{on the fringes of}} the industry into a major labor union and led to the unionization of the domestic United States automobile industry.|$|E
50|$|The Hershey Chocolate Workers’ Strike {{is notable}} {{because of its}} {{historical}} timing. The chocolate strike came {{in the middle of}} a massive wave of CIO <b>strikes</b> and specifically <b>sit-down</b> <b>strikes.</b> In March 1937, the <b>sit-down</b> <b>strikes</b> prominence peaked. There were <b>sit-down</b> <b>strikes</b> in 170 occupations, involving 167,210 workers. The Hershey strikers were organizing around the same time as the famous strike at the General Motors Corporation in Flint, Michigan, although it did not gain the same momentum.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} history of <b>sit-down</b> <b>strikes</b> from the New Deal Era and beyond and traces their {{influence}} on the substance of modern labor law. It argues that, even as the <b>sit-down</b> <b>strikes</b> proved essential {{to the development of}} a meaningful system of labor rights, the strikes also had a very different effect. As this paper undertakes to demonstrate, legal and political attacks on labor rights that were originally aimed at the <b>sit-down</b> <b>strikes</b> metastasized into a more general campaign to prohibit a range of militant strike practices, even those bearing little outward resemblance to the original <b>sit-down</b> <b>strikes.</b> The resulting consequences for organized labor have been quite grave, as this dynamic has helped eviscerate the right to strike and, in effect, deprived labor of weapons it desperately needs to mount any meaningful challenge to the entrenched power of employers in the workplace. In this way, the reaction to the strikes helps to account for the dire state that organized labor finds itself in today. Bringing this out is important not so much because it reveals some simple legal formula for rebuilding labor rights but, to the contrary, because it speaks to the tremendous difficulties that await any such effort. Indeed, this paper argues, the reactionary legacy of the <b>sit-down</b> <b>strikes</b> suggest inherent, perhaps insuperable, limits that may appertain to the right to strike in liberal society. In addition to offering this account of how the <b>sit-down</b> <b>strikes</b> shaped modern labor law, this paper also demonstrates that the strikes were more extensive and enduring than students of labor history commonly assume...|$|R

25|$|The United Automobile Workers {{engaged in}} an {{historic}} <b>sit-down</b> <b>strike</b> at General Motors' Flint plant. The Flint <b>Sit-Down</b> <b>Strike</b> {{was a turning point}} in national collective bargaining and labor policy. After 27 people were injured in a battle between the workers and the police, including 13 strikers with gunshot wounds, Murphy sent the National Guard to protect the workers, didn't follow a court order requesting him to expel the strikers, and refused to order the Guard's troops to suppress the strike.|$|E
25|$|The CIO {{met with}} {{dramatic}} initial successes in 1937, with the UAW winning union recognition at General Motors Corporation after a tumultuous forty-four-day <b>sit-down</b> <b>strike,</b> while the Steel Workers Organizing Committee (SWOC) signed a {{collective bargaining agreement}} with U.S. Steel. Those two victories, however, came about very differently.|$|E

50|$|He had {{a highly}} publicized {{confrontation}} with Ford security forces on May 26, 1937, {{also known as the}} Battle of the Overpass. By this time, thanks to the <b>sit-down</b> <b>strikes,</b> UAW membership had exploded and Local 174 was a power inside the UAW. As a senior union organizer, Reuther helped win major strikes for union recognition against General Motors in 1940 and Ford in 1941.|$|R
25|$|In a {{conventional}} strike, union members leave {{the plant and}} establish a picket line to discourage other employees from entering, thus preventing the employer from operating. In a <b>sit-down</b> <b>strike,</b> the workers physically occupy the plant, keeping management and others out. By remaining inside the factory rather than picketing outside of it, striking workers prevented owners from bringing strikebreakers to resume production.|$|E
25|$|In 1937 Rieve pioneered a {{successful}} <b>sit-down</b> <b>strike</b> of 50,000 textile workers {{that resulted in}} wage increases. He became acting chairman of the Textile Workers Organizing Committee in 1938 and organized the Textile Workers Union of America in 1939. The union was quite strong under Rieve's stewardship and he {{played a role in}} the merger of the AFL with the CIO in 1952.|$|E
25|$|In the Swiss Cup final that season, Basel's opponents were Lausanne-Sports. In {{the former}} Wankdorf Stadium on 15 May 1967, Helmut Hauser scored the decisive goal via a penalty. The game {{went down in}} {{football}} history due to the <b>sit-down</b> <b>strike</b> that followed this goal. After 88 minutes of play, with the score at 1–1, referee Karl Göppel awarded Basel a controversial penalty: André Grobéty had pushed Hauser gently {{in the back and}} he let himself drop theatrically. Subsequent to Basel taking the lead, Lausanne players refused to resume the game, sitting down demonstratively on the pitch. The referee was forced to abandon the match and Basel were awarded the cup with a 3–0 default victory.|$|E

5000|$|WCA {{stands for}} a worker-led just {{transition}} to a low-carbon economy and believes that organised labour, particularly in frontline industries such as aviation, energy and transport is a key agent which is fundamentally capable of effecting meaningful social change. It looks {{to the history of}} working-class environmentalism and direct action, including the Lucas Aerospace workers' struggle of the 1970s and the New South Wales Builders' Labourers Federation's [...] "Green Bans" [...] as inspiring lessons for contemporary struggle and sees tactics such as <b>sit-down</b> <b>strikes</b> as crucial.|$|R
5000|$|The {{spring and}} summer of 1937 saw a return to {{economic}} recession (dubbed the [...] "Roosevelt Recession"), a failed attempt by Roosevelt to [...] "pack" [...] the Supreme Court with judges sympathetic to New Deal policies, and a series of <b>sit-down</b> <b>strikes</b> by organized labor. A bipartisan coalition of conservative politicians emerged in light of these political developments, and Senator Josiah W. Bailey (D-NC) recognized an opportunity to oppose the New Deal through [...] "bipartisan conservative action." [...] The document's key authors were Bailey and Arthur H. Vandenberg (R-MI), with Bailey acting as [...] "final editor." ...|$|R
25|$|As {{short as}} this {{agreement}} was, {{it gave the}} UAW instant legitimacy. The workers there also got a 5% increase in pay and were allowed to talk during lunch. The UAW capitalized on that opportunity, signing up 100,000 GM employees and building the union's strength through grievance strikes at GM plants throughout the country. Several participants in the strike, including Charles I. Krause, went on to greater prominence within the union. Other notable participants in the <b>sit-down</b> <b>strike</b> were future D-Day hero and Greco-Roman wrestling champion Dean Rockwell, labor leader and future UAW president Walter Reuther, and the uncle of documentary filmmaker Michael Moore, whose debut feature Roger & Me contains a clip from the strike.|$|E
25|$|The Flint <b>Sit-Down</b> <b>Strike</b> was a {{risky and}} illegal {{enterprise}} from the outset: the union {{was able to}} share its plans {{with only a few}} workers because of the danger that spies employed by GM would alert management in time to stop it, yet needed to be able to mobilize enough to seize physical control of GM's factories. The union, in fact, not only took over several GM factories in Flint, including one that made the dies necessary to stamp automotive body parts and a companion facility in Cleveland, Ohio, but held on to those sites despite repeated attempts by the police and National Guard to retake them and court orders threatening the union with ruinous fines if it did not call off the strike.|$|E
25|$|Senator Robert Wagner {{wrote the}} National Labor Relations Act, which {{guaranteed}} workers {{the rights to}} collective bargaining through unions of their own choice. The act also established the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) to facilitate wage agreements and to suppress the repeated labor disturbances. The Wagner Act did not compel employers to reach agreement with their employees, but it opened possibilities for American labor. The result was a tremendous growth of membership in the labor unions, especially in the mass-production sector. When the Flint <b>sit-down</b> <b>strike</b> threatened the production of General Motors, Roosevelt broke with the precedent set by many former presidents and refused to intervene; the strike ultimately led to the unionization of both General Motors and its rivals in the American automobile industry.|$|E
5000|$|Stark's Times {{obituary}} drew {{special attention}} {{to a series of}} articles he had written on the battles in the Harlan County, Kentucky, coal fields, and to the [...] "virtual running account" [...] he had provided to Times readers [...] "of the union organizing campaigns, including the rise of the Congress of Industrial Organizations, the <b>sit-down</b> <b>strikes</b> and John L. Lewis." [...] The Times also noted his coverage of the heresy trial of Bishop William Montgomery and of the Sacco-Vanzetti case. An account by Stark of the latter case appeared in a book by Times writers entitled [...] "We Saw It Happen".|$|R
50|$|The La Follette Committee’s {{handling}} of General Motors (GM) exemplifies {{the struggles of}} workers whose intent of organizing made the company infringe upon their civil liberties. With word of oppressive practices, most notably espionage, reaching {{the founders of the}} Committee before its official establishment, the decision to examine the events in Flint, Michigan, was a unanimous one. With intentions of bringing the tyrannical practices of the company {{to the attention of the}} public, the Committee obtained first hand reports of anti-union organizations in Flint. Reports obtained by the Committee also confirmed the involvement of local law enforcement, as they maintained their own espionage system set to infiltrate <b>sit-down</b> <b>strikes</b> in the state.|$|R
5000|$|Stevenson {{served as}} the National Civil Federation's general counsel from 1934 to 1936. In the latter year he decried Communist {{influence}} in American unions, designed [...] "to encourage industrial unrest and thus bring about {{a change in the}} social order by violent means." [...] In 1937 he joined a committee to lobby for the outlawing of <b>sit-down</b> <b>strikes,</b> tracing the tactic to Northern Italy in 1919 and 1920, where it led opponents of union radicals, in his view, to turn to Mussolini and fascism. He protested to Secretary of State Hull against a U.S.-Russian trade agreement and called on the FCC to ban broadcasts by the Communist candidates for President and Vice-President during the 1936 presidential campaign.|$|R
25|$|The Ford Motor Company was {{the last}} Detroit automaker to {{recognize}} the United Auto Workers union (UAW). A <b>sit-down</b> <b>strike</b> by the UAW union in April 1941 closed the River Rouge Plant. Sorensen recounted that a distraught Henry Ford {{was very close to}} following through with a threat to break up the company rather than cooperate, but his wife Clara told him she would leave him if he destroyed the family business. In her view, it would not be worth the chaos it would create. Ford complied with his wife's ultimatum, and even agreed with her in retrospect. Overnight, the Ford Motor Company went from the most stubborn holdout among automakers to the one with the most favorable UAW contract terms. The contract was signed in June 1941.|$|E
25|$|After the {{overthrow}} of Egyptian president Mohamed Morsi by general Abdel Fattah el-Sisi in the 2013 Egyptian coup d'état, the Egyptian government passed laws raising the minimum wage to 1,200 EGP per month. In February 2014, 13,000 Misr Helwan workers, some earning only 500 EGP per month, began a <b>sit-down</b> <b>strike</b> demanding the implementation of minimum wages. Workers also demanded unpaid bonuses. In April Egypt's Higher Administrative Court ruled that public sector employees who strike can be prosecuted, prompting clashes between Misr Helwan workers and Egyptian security forces. In June, the Sisi government called on workers to stop all strikes, and increase productivity. Some Misr Helwan workers stated that mismanagement had brought productivity to 50% of capacity through failure to provide adequate raw materials for production. Misr Helwan employees stated that their wages still remained below minimum wage.|$|E
500|$|The United Auto Workers (UAW) {{was founded}} in Detroit on August 26, 1935. The labor union {{struggled}} to gain members until the Flint <b>Sit-Down</b> <b>Strike</b> in 1937. The strike started on December 30, 1936, when workers at the Fisher Body Plant No.1 stopped loading tool dies on the night shift, locking themselves into the plant. The dies were destined for shipment to plants where union activity was much weaker than the UAW-organized plants in Flint. [...] On January 3, 1937, workers at the plant {{sat down on the}} job; Fisher Plant No.2 later joined in the <b>sit-down</b> <b>strike.</b> The heat was shut off at the plants, and on January 11, food deliveries were stopped, sparking a riot. Governor Frank Murphy mobilized 4,000National Guard troops to keep peace at the plants. A second riot occurred at Chevrolet Plant No.4 on February 1. The National Guard troops surrounded the 12striking plants in Flint, but the governor never ordered them into action. President Franklin D. Roosevelt encouraged the two parties to sit down once more, and an agreement was signed, recognizing the UAW in the 17 striking plants across the country.|$|E
50|$|During {{his tenure}} as governor, James created the state Department of Commerce and the Anthracite Emergency Commission, {{extended}} the Pennsylvania Turnpike, signed a bill banning <b>sit-down</b> <b>strikes,</b> strengthened the civil service, and reinforced liquor control laws. He also turned the state's $58 million deficit into a $75 million surplus. During {{the early part of}} World War II, he established the State Council of Defense and the Selective Service Board and later created the Pennsylvania Reserve Defense Corps and the Citizens' Defense Corps for homeland defense. At the 1940 Republican National Convention in Philadelphia, he was nominated for President of the United States by Joseph N. Pew, Jr.. He lasted for all six ballots, and endorsed the eventual winner, Wendell Willkie.|$|R
50|$|Garner {{sought the}} Democratic presidential {{nomination}} in the 1932 presidential election, but {{he agreed to}} serve as Franklin D. Roosevelt's running mate at the 1932 Democratic National Convention. Roosevelt and Garner won the 1932 election and were re-elected in 1936. A conservative Southerner, Garner opposed the <b>sit-down</b> <b>strikes</b> of the labor unions and the New Deal's deficit spending. He broke with President Franklin D. Roosevelt in early 1937 {{over the issue of}} enlarging the Supreme Court, and helped defeat it {{on the grounds that it}} centralized too much power in the President's hands. Garner again sought the presidency in the 1940 presidential election, but Roosevelt won the party's presidential nomination at the 1940 Democratic National Convention. Garner was replaced as vice president by Henry A. Wallace and retired from public office in 1941.|$|R

Lucy's focus shifted somewhat to class struggles around poverty and unemployment, and she organized the Chicago Hunger Demonstrations in January 1915, which pushed the American Federation of Labor, the Socialist Party, and Jane Addams' Hull House to participate in a huge demonstration on February 12. Parsons was also quoted as saying: [...] "My conception of the strike of the future is not to strike and go out and starve, but to strike and remain in and take possession of the necessary property of production." [...] Parsons anticipated the <b>sit-down</b> <b>strikes</b> in the US and, later, workers' factory takeovers in Argentina.|$|R

Dilling was arrested when she led a <b>sit-down</b> <b>strike</b> with at least 25 other protesters in the corridor outside the office of 84-year-old Senator Carter Glass. After a sensational trial lasting six days, she wept as she {{was found guilty of}} disorderly conduct and fined $25. Glass called for the FBI to investigate the women's groups, and stated in the New York Times on March 7 that the women had caused [...] "a noisy disorder of which any self-respecting fishwife would be ashamed. I likewise believe that it would be pertinent to inquire whether they are mothers. For the sake of the race, I devoutly hope not."

This order was sustained in the Wisconsin Supreme Court. On May 26, 1937, Aarons ruled in the Wrigley Restaurant Case that <b>sit-down</b> <b>strikes</b> were illegal in Wisconsin. On June 12, 1948, Aarons ruled against a Milwaukee radio station, which sought to prevent its former employee, on-air personality Jack Bundy, from billing himself on another station as [...] "Heinie and His Band of Million Airs".

25|$|In 1937 Mortimer and Bob Travis led {{a series}} of {{successful}} <b>sit-down</b> <b>strikes,</b> first at General Motors and then at Chrysler, Hudson, Packard and Studebaker. Martin became concerned about the rising power of the Communists within his union and turned to David Dubinsky for advise. Dubinsky and Martin developed a plan, {{in which they would}} commission Jay Lovestone to help remove the communist influence in the union. Dubinsky gave Lovestone $100,000 to effect the operation. In April 1937 30 Lovestoneites arrived in Detroit to begin their work. They were led by Alex Bail, under his party name George F. Miles, who was in daily contact with Lovestone in New York. William Munger replaced the Communist leaning Henry Kraus as editor of the UAWs periodical the Auto Worker, he also became Martins speech writer; Eve Stone, Alex Bails wife, took over the UAW's Women's Auxiliary; Irving Brown took over operations in UAW locals in Chicago and Baltimore. Perhaps most significant was Francis Henson, who became Homer Martin new executive secretary.|$|R
5000|$|Awad, who {{was born}} in Jerusalem, {{returned}} to the city on a tourist visa in 1983 to establish the nonviolence centre. His plan was to collate information about reconciliation, peace, justice and nonviolence from Arabic literature and Islamic texts and use the material to inform Palestinians that these ideas came from their cultural heritage. He believed that these ideas would help Palestinians generate their own ideas on these issues. [...] Awad was {{part of a group of}} twenty Palestinian intellectuals who advocated nonviolent tactics of intifada and wrote leaflets calling for <b>sit-down</b> <b>strikes</b> local production of food and wrote a long article containing 120 ways nonviolence ways to resist Israelis. Awad traveled through the West Bank on scooter, organizing seminars. A preparation meeting for opening the center was held in 1984 in which Awad, human rights lawyer Jonathan Kuttab and American nonviolence strategist Gene Sharp took part. Initially Kuttab raised the money in United States and in 1985 the center got founding from Hisham Sharabi, Chair of Arab Culture at the Center for Contemporary Arab Studies, Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., who was familiar with Awad's work and the center was officially established.|$|R
