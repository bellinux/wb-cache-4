40|$|Introduction Humans rely {{on their}} {{gastrointestinal}} system for providing the body with a constant supply of nutrients, water and electrolytes. The food must be digested (reduced physically and chemically to a molecular level) to be absorbed in the <b>small</b> <b>intestine.</b> Since both digestion and absorption depend on diffusion the flow of nutrients along the <b>small</b> <b>intestine</b> (GI <b>transit)</b> must be compatible with the rates of both these processes. GI transit depends on motions of the intestine walls, caused by contractions and relaxations (motor activity) of the muscle layers, which in turn are governed by electrical signals. So far in the clinical routine, GI transit has been studied by methods based on X-rays and radioisotopes, and motor activity by means of pressure recordings obtained by catheters passed by mouth or nostrils. Moreover, electrical activity recordings present important drawbacks. The use of magnetic measurements to study the gastrointestinal tract can be divided in two categ...|$|R
40|$|Little {{is known}} about how milk {{proteins}} affect gastrointestinal (GI) transit, particularly for the elderly, in whom digestion has been observed to be slowed. We tested the hypothesis that GI transit is faster for whey than for casein and that this effect is accentuated with hydrolysates, similar to soy. Adult male rats (18 months old) were fed native whey or casein, hydrolyzed whey (WPH) or casein (CPH), hydrolyzed blend (HB; 60 % whey: 40 % casein), or hydrolyzed soy for 14 days then treated with loperamide, prucalopride, or vehicle-control for 7 days. X-ray imaging tracked bead-transit for: gastric emptying (GE; 4 h), <b>small</b> <b>intestine</b> (SI) <b>transit</b> (9 h), and large <b>intestine</b> (LI) <b>transit</b> (12 h). GE for whey was 33 ± 12 % faster than that for either casein or CPH. SI transit was decreased by 37 ± 9 % for casein and 24 ± 6 % for whey compared with hydrolyzed soy, and persisted for casein at 12 h. Although CPH and WPH did not alter transit compared with their respective intact counterparts, fecal output was increased by WPH. Slowed transit by casein was reversed by prucalopride (9 -h), but not loperamide. However, rapid GE and slower SI transit for the HB compared with intact forms were inhibited by loperamide. The expected slower GI transit for casein relative to soy provided a comparative benchmark, and opioid receptor involvement was corroborated. Our findings provide new evidence that whey slowed SI transit compared with soy, independent of GE. Increased GI transit from stomach to colon for the HB compared with casein suggests that including hydrolyzed milk proteins in foods may benefit those with slowed intestinal transit...|$|R

Exogenous GLP- 2 (0. 1 – 300 nM) induced a concentration-dependent reduction of the spontaneous mechanical activity, which was abolished by the desensitization of GLP- 2 receptor or by tetrodotoxin, a voltage-dependent Na+-channel blocker. GLP- 2 inhibitory effect was not affected by Nomega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor), apamin (a blocker of small conductance Ca 2 +-dependent K+ channels), or [Lys 1,Pro 2, 5,Arg 3, 4,Tyr 6]VIP 7 – 28 (a VIP receptor antagonist), but it was prevented by atropine or pertussis toxin (PTX), a Gi/o protein inhibitor.

Furthermore, the antidiarrhoeal and antispasmodic effect of apigenin, a flavonoid constituent of D. kotschyi, was also studied. Hydroalcoholic and hexane extracts were obtained from aerial part of D. kotschyi using percolation method. Antispasmodic effect of the test compounds was assessed by measurement of <b>small</b> <b>intestine</b> <b>transit</b> following oral administration of a charcoal meal. Diarrhoea was induced by administration of either castor oil (0. 5 ml) or magnesium sulphate (MgSO 4) (10 % w/v solution). Both the hydroalcoholic and hexane extracts of D. kotschyi (10 and 20 mg/kg) reduced the intestinal charcoal meal transit.

The effect of cidomycin in alleviating severity of NASH is also studied. METHODS: Forty eight rats were randomly divided into NASH group (n = 16), cidomycin group (n = 16) and control group (n = 16). Then each group were subdivided into small intestinal motility group (n = 8), bacteria group (n = 8) respectively. A semi-solid colored marker was used for monitoring small intestinal transit. The proximal small intestine was harvested under sterile condition and processed for quantitation for aerobes (E. coli) and anaerobes (Lactobacilli). Liver pathologic score was calculated to qualify the severity of hepatitis. Serum ALT, AST levels were detected to evaluate the severity of hepatitis. RESULTS: Small intestinal transit was inhibited in NASH group (P < 0. 01). Rats treated with cidomycin had higher <b>small</b> <b>intestine</b> <b>transit</b> rate than rats in NASH group (P < 0. 01). High fat diet resulted in quantitative alterations in the aerobes (E. coli) {{but not in the}} anoerobics (Lactobacill). There was {{an increase in the number}} of E. coli in the proximal small intestinal flora in NASH group than in control group (1. 70 ± 0. 12 log 10 (CFU/g) vs 1. 28 ± 0. 07 log 10 (CFU/g), P < 0. 01). TNF-α concentration was significantly higher in NASH group than in control group (1. 13 ± 0. 15 mmol/L vs 0. 57 ± 0. 09 mmol/L, P < 0. 01). TNF-αconcentration was lower in cidomycin group than in NASH group (0. 63 ± 0. 09 mmol/L vs 1. 13 ± 0. 15 mmol/L, P < 0. 01). Treatment with cidomycin showed its effect by significantly lowering serum ALT, AST and TNF-α levels of NASH rats. CONCLUSION: SIBO may decrease small intestinal movement in NASH rats.

40|$|This article {{begins with}} a review of gastric emptying, <b>small</b> <b>intestine</b> <b>transit,</b> and colonic transit of drug {{delivery}} systems with special attention paid to the different physiological processes involved in stomach emptying and to the cut-off size of nondigestible solids for passage through the gastroduodenal junction during the digestive phase. Then, the proposed means for prolonging the gastric residence time (GRT) of drug delivery systems are reviewed and analyzed with special emphasis on floating (F) dosage forms. The following means are discussed: the use of passage-delaying agents, large single-unit dosage forms, bioadhesive drug delivery systems, 'heavy' pellets, and buoyant forms. In the section devoted to bioadhesive forms, {{the influence of the}} turnover time of the intestinal mucus gel layer on the performance of mucoadhesive preparations is pointed out to explain the poor results obtained in humans with such peroral products. The use of a specifically designed apparatus for measuring the total force acting vertically on an object immersed in a liquid is presented as a methodology for selecting optimized buoyant formations in vitro. Scintigraphic studies are described in nonfasting human volunteers either in upright or in supine posture, who concurrently were given one optimized F and one nonfloating (NF) hydrophilic matrix capsules of the same size, for three different sizes (small, medium, and large). In upright subjects, the F forms stayed continuously above the gastric contents irrespective of their size, whereas the NF ones sank rapidly after administration and never rose back to the surface thereafter. Consequently, the F forms show prolonged and more reproducible GRTs compared to the NF ones. The significance and extent of this prolongation are the most marked for the small size units (p 0. 05). Moreover, there is {{no significant difference between the}} mean GRTs of the small, medium, and large F units (p > 0. 05). This indirectly confirms that the intragastric buoyancy of the F forms is the main process determining their prolonged GRT and protecting them from random gastric emptying related to antral peristaltism. Thus, their GRT depends mainly on the occurrence of the end point of digestion. To the contrary, the lasting retention of the NF forms in the stomach is only size dependent. It appeared systematically with the large size units but not with all of the medium size units and never with the small size units (mean GRT small 0. 05) because the F forms remain buoyant anywhere between the lesser and greater curvatures of the stomach. This position does not protect them from random emptying when they move distally toward the pylorus. Thus, in supine subjects, the GRTs of the F forms vary according to their size (mean GRT small 0. 05) and they still increase with the size of the form (mean GRT small < medium < large units, p < 0. 05). Drawbacks related to the approach of GRT enhancement based on a size effect are discussed. SCOPUS: re. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Current {{research}} suggests that protein intake of 1. 5 – 2. 8 g/kg/day (3. 5 times the current recommended daily allowance) is effective and safe for individuals trying to increase or maintain lean muscle mass. To achieve these levels of daily protein consumption, supplementing the diet with processed whey protein concentrate (WPC) in liquid form has become a popular choice for many people. Some products have a suggested serving size as high as 50 g of protein. However, due to possible inhibition of endogenous digestive enzymes from over-processing and rapid <b>small</b> <b>intestine</b> <b>transit</b> time, the average amount of liquid WPC that is absorbed may be only 15 g. The combined effect of these factors may contribute to incomplete digestion, thereby limiting the absorption rate of protein before it reaches the ceacum and is eliminated as waste. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine if Aminogen ®, a patented blend of digestive proteases from Aspergillus niger and Aspergillus oryzae, would significantly increase the in-vivo absorption rate of processed WPC over control values. It also investigated if any increase would be sufficient to significantly alter nitrogen (N 2) balance and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels over control values as further evidence of increased WPC absorption rate. Methods Two groups of healthy male subjects were assigned a specified balanced diet before and after each of two legs of the study. Subjects served as their own controls. In the first leg each control group (CG) was dosed with 50 g of WPC following an overnight fast. Nine days later each test group (TG) was dosed following an overnight fast with 50 g of WPC containing either 2. 5 g (A 2. 5) or 5 g (A 5) of Aminogen ®. Blood samples were collected during each leg at 0 hr, 0. 5 hr, 1 hr, 2 hr, 3 hr, 3. 5 hr and 4 hr for amino acid (AA) and CRP analyses. The following 18 AAs were quantified: alanine, arginine, aspartic acid, cysteine, glutamic acid, glycine, histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, proline, serine, threonine, tryptophan, tyrosine and valine. Urine was collected for 24 hours from 0 hr for total N 2 analysis. Results are expressed as means ± SEM. All significance and power testing on results was done at a level of alpha = 0. 05. Area under the concentration time curve (AUC) was calculated using the trapezoidal rule. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA- 1) was done between CGs, between TGs and between time points. One-way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA- 1 -RM) was done to compare CGs and TGs. Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA- 2) was performed on total serum amino acid (TSAA) levels, urine N 2 levels and CRP levels between each CG and TG. Results After baseline subtraction the mean AUC was significantly (p ≤ 0. 05) greater in each TG compared the corresponding CG. Comparison of the mean AUC between each TG and each CG was not significantly different. Total serum amino acid (TSAA) levels were significantly greater in each TG compared the corresponding CG. They were also significantly different between each TG but not between each CG. All individual serum amino acid (ISAA) levels in TG-A 2. 5 except glycine, histidine, methionine and serine were significantly higher than in CG-A 2. 5 at 4 hr. All ISAA levels in TG-A 5 except methionine and serine were significantly higher than in CG-A 5 at 4 hr. The N 2 balance was significantly higher in each TG compared to the corresponding CG, but not significantly different between each CG and between each TG. Significant differences in CRP levels are reported between each TG compared to the corresponding CG, but not significantly different between each TG and between each CG. Conclusion A patented blend of digestive proteases (Aminogen ®) increased the absorption rate of processed WPC over controls, as measured by statistically significant increases in AUC, TSAA levels, ISAA levels and N 2 balance. Significant decreases in CRP levels and fluxes in AA levels are also reported. </p...|$|E

40|$|Objective-To {{develop a}} {{technique}} for radiographic {{evaluation of the}} gastrointestinal tract in ball pythons (Python regius). Samples- 10 ball python cadavers (5 males and 5 females) and 18 healthy adult ball pythons (10 males and 8 females). Procedures-Live snakes were allocated to 3 groups (A, B, and C). A dose (25 mL/kg) of barium sulfate suspension at 3 concentrations (25 %, 35 %, and 45 % [wt/vol]) was administered through an esophageal probe to snakes in groups A, B, and C, respectively. Each evaluation ended when all the contrast medium had reached the large <b>intestine.</b> <b>Transit</b> times through the esophagus, stomach, and <b>small</b> <b>intestine</b> were recorded. Imaging quality was evaluated by 3 investigators who assigned a grading score {{on the basis of}} predetermined criteria. Statistical analysis was conducted to evaluate differences in quality among the study groups. Results-The esophagus and stomach had a consistent distribution pattern of contrast medium, whereas 3 distribution patterns of contrast medium were identified in the <b>small</b> <b>intestine,</b> regardless of barium concentration. Significant differences in imaging quality were detected among the 3 groups. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Radiographic procedures were tolerated well by all snakes. The 35 % concentration of contrast medium yielded the best imaging quality. Use of contrast medium for evaluation of the cranial portion of the gastrointestinal tract could be a reliable technique for the diagnosis of gastrointestinal diseases in ball pythons. However, results of this study may not translate to other snake species because of variables identified in this group of snakes...|$|R

Most food substances are absorbed in the <b>small</b> <b>intestine.</b> However, even though alcohol can be absorbed in the stomach, it is mostly absorbed in the <b>small</b> <b>intestine</b> because the <b>small</b> <b>intestine</b> has a large surface area that promotes absorption. Once alcohol is absorbed in the <b>small</b> <b>intestine,</b> it delays the release of stomach contents from emptying into the <b>small</b> <b>intestine.</b> Thus, alcohol can delay the rate of absorption of nutrients.

40|$|The {{effects of}} Yersinia enterocolitica on {{intestinal}} goblet cells were investigated in New Zealand white rabbits. Animals infected with Y enterocolitica {{were compared with}} weight matched and pair fed controls. Goblet cell hyperplasia developed in the distal <b>small</b> <b>intestine</b> of infected rabbits on day 1, in the mid <b>small</b> <b>intestine</b> on day 3, and in the upper <b>small</b> <b>intestine</b> on day 6. In all regions hyperplasia persisted throughout the 14 day study. The degree of hyperplasia was greater in the distal <b>small</b> <b>intestine</b> than the upper and mid regions. Goblet cells in the proximal colon of infected animals seemed to respond {{as those in the}} distal <b>small</b> <b>intestine.</b> Thus goblet cell hyperplasia developed more rapidly and to a greater extent in the ileocaecal region where mucosal injury was most severe. These changes resulted directly from Y enterocolitica infection since goblet cell numbers did not increase in pair fed controls. Histochemically, goblet cell mucins from infected rabbits were unchanged at either six or 14 days. Biochemical analysis, however, established that purified mucins from animals on day 6 after infection were less sialylated (in the <b>small</b> <b>intestine)</b> and more sulphated (in the <b>small</b> <b>intestine</b> and proximal colon). In addition, mucins from the distal <b>small</b> <b>intestine</b> and the proximal colon seemed to contain fewer but longer oligosaccharide chains...|$|R

More lymphoblast label accumulated in the <b>small</b> <b>intestine</b> of infected mice than in uninfected animals even at stages of the infection when no alteration in the proportion of the cardiac output received by the <b>small</b> <b>intestine</b> had occurred. Enhanced lymphoblast accumulation occurred in different segments of the infected <b>small</b> <b>intestine</b> as the infection proceeded and these changes paralleled {{the way in which the}} parasite burden was distributed in the intestine. The kinetics of lymphoblast accumulation in infected and uninfected <b>small</b> <b>intestine</b> was examined under circumstances where the delivery of blood-borne labelled cells was the same.
