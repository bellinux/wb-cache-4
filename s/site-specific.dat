5|$|In September 2008, Han was one {{of seven}} Cultural Medallion winners to receive an $80,000 grant from the NAC's CM Grant {{programme}} to fund a project involving <b>site-specific</b> installations based on Singapore flora.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{explored}} {{the theme of}} escapism at the Indianapolis Museum of Contemporary Art in a show entitled The Production of Escapism: A Solo Project by Rashid Johnson. He addressed distraction and relief from reality through art and fantasy. Johnson used photos, video and <b>site-specific</b> installation to study escapist tendencies through often {{with a sense of}} humor that bordered on the absurd.|$|E
5|$|Minneapolis {{is home to}} four opera companies, {{including}} the Minnesota Opera and the Mill City Summer Opera. In recent years, Skylark Opera Theatre and Really Spicy Opera have also gained national prominence – Skylark for its use of <b>site-specific</b> productions, and Really Spicy for its productions of new musicals and operas.|$|E
5|$|Many {{proteins}} {{are able}} to recognize or distort the Holliday junction structure. One such class contains junction-resolving enzymes that cleave the junctions, sometimes in a sequence-specific fashion. Such proteins distort {{the structure of the}} junction in various ways, often pulling the junction into an unstacked conformation, breaking the central base pairs, and/or changing the angles between the four arms. Other classes are branch migration proteins that increase the exchange rate by orders of magnitude, and <b>site-specific</b> recombinases. In prokaryotes, Holliday junction resolvases fall into two families, integrases and nucleases, that are each structurally similar although their sequences are not conserved.|$|E
5|$|The Holliday {{junction}} {{is a key}} intermediate in homologous recombination, {{a biological}} process that increases genetic diversity by shifting genes between two chromosomes, as well as <b>site-specific</b> recombination events involving integrases. They are additionally involved in repair of double-strand breaks. In addition, cruciform structures involving Holliday junctions can arise to relieve helical strain in symmetrical sequences in DNA supercoils. While four-arm junctions also appear in functional RNA molecules, such as U1 spliceosomal RNA and the hairpin ribozyme of the tobacco ringspot virus, these usually contain unpaired nucleotides in between the paired double-helical domains, and thus do not strictly adopt the Holliday structure.|$|E
5|$|The Tower domain {{adopts a}} {{secondary}} structure {{consisting of a}} pair of long, antiparallel alpha-helices (the stem) that support a three-helix bundle (3HB) at their end. The 3HB contains a helix-turn-helix motif and is similar to the DNA binding domains of the bacterial <b>site-specific</b> recombinases, and of eukaryotic Myb and homeodomain transcription factors. The Tower domain has {{an important role in the}} tumour suppressor function of BRCA2, and is essential for appropriate binding of BRCA2 to DNA.|$|E
5|$|Among several {{projects}} for memorials, Zvi Hecker designed the solemn Page Memorial (1996) with Micha Ullmann and Eyal Weizman. This <b>site-specific</b> memorial commemorates the Jewish community of Kreuzberg, and their Lindenstrasse synagogue {{which was designed}} in 1891 by architects Cremer & Wolffenstein. What was {{once one of the}} largest religious buildings in Berlin, with a capacity of 1800; was ruined by the Nazis in the 1938 Kristallnacht pogrom. On the original floor plan, the benches of the synagogue were recreated in concrete, and where the bimah stood, trees are now planted. The designers conceived of the benches as sentences on the pages of the Talmud.|$|E
5|$|Holliday {{junctions}} {{may exist}} {{in a variety of}} conformational isomers with different patterns of coaxial stacking between the four double-helical arms. Coaxial stacking is the tendency of nucleic acid blunt ends to bind to each other, by interactions between the exposed bases. There are three possible stacking conformers: an unstacked form and two stacked forms. The unstacked form dominates in the absence of divalent cations such as Mg2+, because of electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged backbones of the strands. In the presence of at least about 0.1 mM Mg2+, the electrostatic repulsion is counteracted and the stacked structures predominate. As of 2000, it was not known with certainty whether the electrostatic shielding was the result of <b>site-specific</b> binding of cations to the junction, or the presence of a diffuse collection of the ions in solution.|$|E
5|$|In {{its third}} year in London, the 2015 show had 15,000 visitors. The fourth London show in October 2016 was {{three times the size}} of the {{original}} exhibition, and had expanded from a wing of the Somerset House to the rest of the building and its courtyard, where Zak Ové installed a <b>site-specific</b> work that was purchased for a sculpture park in Berkshire. The 2016 fair featured 130 artists, including the fair's first artists representing Egypt, Ethiopia, and Ghana. Koyo Kouoh's forum series returned to the event as well. Of the 40 exhibitors from 18 countries, 40 percent were from Africa and 17 galleries debuted at the show. The fair's founder viewed these expansions as a sign of progress for the African art market. She hopes to hold future 1:54 fairs in Africa.|$|E
5|$|In {{recent years}} the IMA has begun to focus on {{developing}} its contemporary art collection, which includes works such as Two White Dots in the Air by Alexander Calder and Light and Space III, a permanent installation by Robert Irwin located in the Pulliam Great Hall. Since 2007 the museum has featured <b>site-specific</b> contemporary installations in the Efroymson Pavilion, rotating the temporary works every six months. The Efroymson Pavilion has featured works by artists such as William Lamson, Ball-Nogues Studio, Orly Genger, and Heather Rowe to name a few. Contemporary art is also featured in 100 Acres: The Virginia B. Fairbanks Art and Nature Park, which is unique in its inclusion of commissioned works by emerging mid-career artists. Since 2007, the IMA has committed to building a modern design collection that illustrates the artistic merits of utilitarian objects. The focus on international contemporary design, combined {{with the opening of}} the Miller House in 2011, is expected to reposition the museum as an authority on design.|$|E
25|$|The {{standards}} {{requires that}} a loads analysis {{is based on}} <b>site-specific</b> external conditions such as wind, wave and currents.|$|E
25|$|GLAD-PCR assay, {{which is}} based on new type of enzymes – <b>site-specific</b> methyl-directed DNA endonucleases, which hydrolyze only {{methylated}} DNA.|$|E
25|$|The IEC 61400–3 design {{standard}} {{requires that}} a loads analysis {{be based on}} <b>site-specific</b> external conditions such as wind, wave and currents. The IEC 61400–3-2 standard applies specifically to floating wind turbines.|$|E
25|$|Putting on {{shows is}} costly to venues as well, due to theatre licence fees which by 2009 had risen 800% in the {{preceding}} three years, and were eight times as high as fees in English cities, starting at £824 for a venue of up to 200 people and rising to £2,472 for a venue of up to 5,000 people. These fees have been cited as punitive to smaller venues and <b>site-specific</b> performances by such figures as Julian Caddy, which in 2009 featured <b>site-specific</b> shows in such venues as Inchcolm island and a swimming pool at the Apex International Hotel.|$|E
25|$|The {{process is}} non-templated (unlike DNA {{transcription}} or protein translation); instead, the cell relies on segregating enzymes into different cellular compartments (e.g., endoplasmic reticulum, cisternae in Golgi apparatus). Therefore, glycosylation is a <b>site-specific</b> modification.|$|E
25|$|Sludge {{treatment}} {{depends on}} the amount of solids generated and other <b>site-specific</b> conditions. Composting is most often applied to small-scale plants with aerobic digestion for mid-sized operations, and anaerobic digestion for the larger-scale operations.|$|E
25|$|Portions of {{the trail}} are {{suitable}} for, and are used for, cross-country skiing and geocaching. <b>Site-specific</b> activities enjoyed along the route include bird watching, hunting (very limited), fishing, horseback riding, bouldering and rock climbing (limited).|$|E
25|$|A {{large number}} of methods are {{available}} to effect site-directed mutagenesis, although {{most of them are}} now rarely used in laboratories since the early 2000s, as newer techniques allow for simpler and easier ways of introducing <b>site-specific</b> mutation into genes.|$|E
25|$|Roni Horn (born September 25, 1955) is an American visual {{artist and}} writer. Horn's oeuvre, which spans almost four decades, {{encompasses}} sculpture, drawing, photography, language, and <b>site-specific</b> installation. The granddaughter of Eastern European Jewish immigrants, {{she was born}} in New York where she lives and works.|$|E
25|$|Selected {{texts from}} The Southwark Mysteries {{featured}} in his <b>site-specific</b> ritual dramas - The Anatomy Class (The Old Operating Theatre), The Goose At Liberty (Southwark Playhouse)The Halloween of Cross Bones, conducted annually from 1998 to 2010, which culminated {{at the gates}} of the former burial ground.|$|E
25|$|Truman Tennis Lowe is a Ho-Chunk {{sculptor}} {{and installation}} artist living in Wisconsin. A professor {{of fine art}} at the University of Wisconsin, Lowe is the former curator of contemporary art at the National Museum of the American Indian. He is known for large <b>site-specific</b> installation pieces utilizing natural materials.|$|E
25|$|Water {{quality in}} Nicaragua was {{monitored}} from 1971 to 1986. Due to economics, the monitoring ceased in 1986. Since then, the only information available on water quality is obtained from <b>site-specific</b> studies. It has been recommended that an environmental water monitoring system be {{established for the}} purpose of monitoring water quality.|$|E
25|$|The Metacomet Trail is {{primarily}} used for hiking, backpacking, picnicking, {{and in the}} winter, snowshoeing. Portions of the trail are suitable for, and are used for, mountain biking and cross-country skiing. <b>Site-specific</b> activities enjoyed along the route include hunting, fishing, horseback riding, boating, bouldering, rock climbing (access), and swimming.|$|E
25|$|Site-directed {{mutagenesis}} is {{a molecular}} biology method {{that is used}} to make specific and intentional changes to the DNA sequence of a gene and any gene products. Also called <b>site-specific</b> mutagenesis or oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis, it is used for investigating the structure and biological activity of DNA, RNA, and protein molecules, and for protein engineering.|$|E
25|$|The DNA {{template}} is not {{the final}} word on mature miRNA production: 6% of human miRNAs show RNA editing (IsomiRs), the <b>site-specific</b> modification of RNA sequences to yield products different from those encoded by their DNA. This increases the diversity and scope of miRNA action beyond that implicated from the genome alone.|$|E
25|$|Calcium balance—The {{process of}} bone {{resorption}} by the osteoclasts releases stored calcium into the systemic circulation {{and is an}} important process in regulating calcium balance. As bone formation actively fixes circulating calcium in its mineral form, removing it from the bloodstream, resorption actively unfixes it thereby increasing circulating calcium levels. These processes occur in tandem at <b>site-specific</b> locations.|$|E
25|$|Modern and {{contemporary}} art have added {{a number of}} non-traditional forms of sculpture, including sound sculpture, light sculpture, environmental art, environmental sculpture, street art sculpture, kinetic sculpture (involving aspects of physical motion), land art, and <b>site-specific</b> art. Sculpture is an important form of public art. A collection of sculpture in a garden setting can be called a sculpture garden.|$|E
25|$|In 2013, MacAdam, {{along with}} Charles MacAdam and {{structural}} designer Norihide Imagawa, installed another <b>site-specific</b> work titled Harmonic Motion for “Enel Contemporanea 2013” in the Museo d’Arte Contemporanea Roma in Rome, Italy. This recent work {{touches on the}} theme of how the human body interacts with space and materials, an idea that is present in much of her architectural work.|$|E
25|$|Jean-Max Albert is a painter, sculptor, writer, and musician. He has {{published}} theory, artist's books, {{a collection of}} poems, plays and novels inspired by quantic physics. He perpetuated a reflexion initiated by Paul Klee and Edgar Varèse on the transposition of musical structures into formal constructions. He created plant architectures which come close to <b>site-specific</b> art, environmental sculpture and generative art.|$|E
25|$|Lynch was {{the subject}} of a major art {{retrospective}} at the Fondation Cartier, Paris from March 3 – May 27, 2007. The show was titled The Air is on Fire and included numerous paintings, photographs, drawings, alternative films and sound work. New <b>site-specific</b> art installations were created specially for the exhibition. A series of events accompanied the exhibition including live performances and concerts.|$|E
25|$|Following the 2006 {{review the}} Office for Nuclear Regulation, an agency of Health and Safety Executive, {{developed}} the Generic Design Assessment process (GDA) to assess new nuclear reactor designs ahead of <b>site-specific</b> proposals. The GDA started assessing four designs: Westinghouse AP1000; Areva EPR; AECL ACR-1000; and GE-Hitachi ESBWR. However the ACR-1000 and ESBWR were subsequently {{withdrawn from the}} assessment for commercial reasons, leaving the EPR and AP1000 as contenders for new nuclear builds.|$|E
25|$|For a <b>site-specific</b> {{collaboration}} with fellow artist Liam Gillick at Casey Kaplan Gallery in 2013, Lawler contributed a long vinyl wall sticker that linked the three {{rooms of the}} gallery. The image printed on it was a stretched-out version of some of her earlier photographs of artworks in bland white-box settings; here, pieces by Edgar Degas, Richard Serra and Gerhard Richter, among others, were distorted beyond recognition into unrecognisable streaks of colour.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, Kapoor {{created the}} permanent, <b>site-specific</b> work Earth Cinema for Pollino National Park, the largest {{national}} park in Italy, {{as part of the}} project ArtePollino– Another South. Kapoor's work, Cinema di Terra (Earth Cinema), is a 45m long, 3m wide and 7m deep cut into the landscape made from concrete and earth. People can enter from both sides and walk along it, viewing the earth void within. Cinema di Terra officially opened to public in September 2009.|$|E
25|$|In summary, direct {{molecular}} mass-spectrometry {{has been}} {{commonly used to}} measure laboratory spiked isotope tracers. Recently advanced high resolution gas source isotope ratio mass spectrometers can measure hydrogen isotopes of organic molecules directly. These mass spectrometers can provide high precision and high sensitivity. The drawback {{of this type of}} instruments includes high cost, and standardization difficulty. Also, studying <b>site-specific</b> isotopes with mass spectrometry is less straightforward and needs more constraints than the SNIF-NMR method, and can only distinguish isotopologues but not isotopomers.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, Kapoor {{became the}} first Guest Artistic Director of Brighton Festival. Kapoor {{installed}} four sculptures during the festival: Sky Mirror at Brighton Pavilion gardens; C-Curve at The Chattri, Blood Relations (a collaboration with author Salman Rushdie); and 1000 Names, both at Fabrica. He also created a large <b>site-specific</b> work titled The Dismemberment of Jeanne d’Arc and a performance-based installation: Imagined Monochrome. The public response was so overwhelming that police had to re-divert traffic around C Curve at the Chattri and exercise crowd control.|$|E
25|$|From 2004 to 2012 he was artistic {{director}} of the community arts group Southwark Mysteries, conducting guided walks, workshops and <b>site-specific</b> performances inspired by the work. The Halloween of Cross Bones, conducted annually from 1998 to 2010, ended with a candle-lit procession to the gates of Crossbones, the outcasts' burial ground. He led a long campaign to protect the burial ground and to establish a garden of remembrance on the site. A new production of The Southwark Mysteries was staged in Southwark Cathedral in 2010.|$|E
