25|$|Matthew Hoggard was a {{specialist}} orthodox swing bowler, and usually took the new ball for England in Test cricket.

He could block up an end for the batsman at the other end to score, and was also used as a nightwatchman.|$|E

5000|$|Jardine won the toss {{and chose}} to bat. Clem Hill remarked to Jardine {{that it should}} be a close game, but Jardine joked that he {{obviously}} had not seen who had won the toss. There had been rain on the day before the match and moisture was still present when Sutcliffe and Jardine went out to bat, which made the pitch difficult for batting that morning. Australia had played three spinners, so leg spinner O'Reilly took the new ball with the solitary paceman Tim Wall. The fourth ball, from Wall, bounced unexpectedly and hit Sutcliffe's shoulder, to the crowd's pleasure. After twenty minutes play, England had scored just four runs when Jardine was bowled off his pads trying to glance a <b>swinging</b> <b>delivery</b> from Wall. Hammond came in and looked uncomfortable as Wall bowled some short-pitched deliveries. He had to duck underneath one ball and departed after slashing wildly at a quick delivery and with the score at 16, he was caught by Wicket-keeper Bert Oldfield, standing further back than usual, diving across in front of first slip. Umpire George Hele believed Hammond may have deliberately got out. Jardine believed the ball had bounced lower than usual. As he walked off, disturbed by the frequency of short bowling, Hammond was heard to say [...] "If that's what the bloody game's coming to, I've had enough of it." [...] A second wicket fell without a run added as Sutcliffe, after 46 minutes batting, played a weak shot and hit O'Reilly in the air. Wall, at short square leg, dived forward to take a one-handed catch. Les Ames, who was in poor batting form, also looked uncomfortable. He batted unconvincingly for 39 minutes for three runs and did not score for 20 minutes; in that time, he edged the ball several times and was bowled by a no ball from O'Reilly. Just as it appeared he was settling down, he was bowled by a faster ball from left arm orthodox spinner Bert Ironmonger. England's score was four wickets for 30 runs (4/30). The crowd were delighted by the course of the morning session; England had not expected to lose so many wickets so quickly and Hedley Verity and Gubby Allen, both due to bat lower in the order, were seen rushing to the dressing room to change in case they were needed to bat quickly. Maurice Leyland and Bob Wyatt took England to lunch without losing any more wickets and the score was 4/37 after 90 minutes play.|$|E
2500|$|Cricket writer, Colin Bateman, stated, [...] "Cartwright was an {{exceptional}} bowler whose talents {{could not find}} a niche in the England side, much to the discredit of the selectors. His high, flowing action off a few steady paces produced unnerring accuracy and nip for his rich assortment of seam and <b>swing</b> <b>deliveries,</b> but England looked usually for a first change bowler with extra pace".|$|R
25|$|In 1992, {{after he}} had been {{successful}} against the English batsmen, accusations of ball tampering began to appear in the English media, though no video evidence of foul play was ever found.

The skill of the reverse <b>swing</b> <b>delivery</b> was relatively unknown in England and around the cricketing world during that period.|$|R
2500|$|Fielder was {{described}} by Wisden in 1907 as being [...] "quite modern in his methods, keeping the ball {{for the most part}} well outside the off-stump". He generally bowled out <b>swing</b> <b>deliveries,</b> swerving the ball away from the batsman and relying on catches by slip fielders. He also used deliveries which made the ball break back into the batsman and is described, again by Wisden in 1907, as bowling at a [...] "fine pace". He bowled consistently and could be relied upon to bowl long spells.|$|R
2500|$|According to {{the various}} {{professional}} playing conditions, 42.11, [...] "The bowler is permitted, before releasing the ball and provided he has not completed his usual <b>delivery</b> <b>swing,</b> to attempt to run out the non-striker." [...] The umpires shall deem the bowler to have completed his <b>delivery</b> <b>swing</b> once his bowling arm passes the normal point of ball release.|$|R
5000|$|A ball {{is fairly}} {{delivered}} {{in respect of}} the arm if, once the bowler's arm has reached {{the level of the}} shoulder in the <b>delivery</b> <b>swing,</b> the elbow joint is not straightened partially or completely from that point until the ball has left the hand.

2500|$|The {{curvature}} of <b>swing</b> <b>deliveries</b> {{can make them}} difficult for a batsman to hit with his bat. Typically, bowlers more commonly bowl outswingers, as they tend {{to move away from}} the batsman, meaning he has to [...] "chase" [...] the ball to hit it. Hitting away from the batsman's body is dangerous, as it leaves a gap between the bat and body through which the ball may travel to hit the wicket. Also, if the batsman misjudges the amount of swing, he can hit the ball with an edge of the bat. An inside edge can ricochet on to the wicket, resulting in him being out bowled, while an outside edge can fly to the wicket-keeper or slip fielders for a catch.|$|R

2500|$|Vaas is a {{left arm}} swing bowler {{known for his}} {{accuracy}} and consistent line and length, which his former captain Aravinda de Silva once described as [...] "accurate, nagging, hard to get away". Early in his career he stood out for his raw pace. Due to his accuracy with the new ball he would be tasked with opening the bowling, {{as illustrated by the}} number of times he has dismissed important higher and middle order batsmen such as Adam Gilchrist, Ricky Ponting, Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly and Stephen Fleming, the latter four being captains of their respective national teams. He became noted for his inswinger and well-disguised off cutter and, as his pace dropped over the years, later added reverse swing to his armoury. His consistent deliveries and ability to use various types of <b>swing</b> <b>deliveries</b> effectively made him a consistent wicket-taker even in humid weather and on dry and dusty subcontinental pitches, conditions which are known to favour spin bowlers rather than fast bowlers.|$|R

500|$|After {{the lunch}} break, England added six runs to be 35/4, before Lindwall bowled Yardley with a {{swinging}} yorker. The debutant Watkins came in, having {{earned a reputation}} in Glamorgan's match against Australia for hooking. He made several attempts at the shot in his innings of 16 balls. He attempted a hook shot from a short ball and missed before being hit on the shoulder by another Lindwall bouncer, having tried to hook the ball downwards in an unorthodox manner akin to a tennis serve. He was then dismissed without scoring after playing across the line and being trapped leg before wicket by Johnston for a duck to leave England at 42/6. For his troubles, Watkins also collected a bruise from the hit to the shoulder, which inhibited his bowling later in the match. Lindwall then removed Godfrey Evans, Alec Bedser and Young, all yorked by <b>swinging</b> <b>deliveries</b> {{in the space of}} two runs, as England fell from 45/6 to 47/9. This brought Hollies in at No. 11 to accompany Hutton, who then hit the only boundary of the innings, lofting Lindwall for a straight drive back over his head. The ball almost went for six, landing just short of the boundary. The innings ended at 52 when Hutton—who never appeared troubled by the bowling—leg glanced Lindwall and was caught by wicket-keeper Don Tallon, who caught the ball one-handed at full stretch to his left. Lindwall described the catch {{as one of the best}} he had ever seen, while O'Reilly called it [...] "extraordinarily good".|$|R
25|$|The first Test at Chennai {{turned out}} to be a very high scoring affair, with South Africa batting first and making 540, then India {{responding}} strongly, led by Virender Sehwag who scored 319 from 304 balls, to reach 468/1 by the end of the third day. On the fourth day Steyn helped to restrict India's lead to 87 runs by dismissing MS Dhoni with a bouncer then blasting through the lower order, taking three wickets in two overs for the cost of two runs, all bowled with reverse <b>swinging</b> <b>deliveries.</b> He finished the innings, and the match which petered out into a tame draw, with four wickets for 103 runs. On the morning of the second Test at Ahmedabad, South Africa demolished the much vaunted Indian batting line within twenty overs, for the meagre total of 76 runs. Steyn was the pick of the bowlers taking five wickets for 23 runs, dismissing Sehwag and Rahul Dravid then mopping up the last three batsmen for the cost of 11 runs. In the second innings he added a further three wickets to his match tally, finishing the game with eight wickets for 114 runs, as South Africa completed a crushing victory by an innings and 90 runs. The final Test at Kanpur saw Steyn pick up three first innings wickets which took him to 15 wickets in the series at an average of 20.20. As a result of this, the cumulation of an outstanding 2007/08 season in which he took 75 wickets in 11 matches, Steyn moved up to joint first place (alongside Muttiah Muralitharan) in the ICC Test match bowling rankings.|$|R

50|$|The Sixers {{then picked}} up three wins on the road against the Melbourne Renegades, Sydney Thunder and Adelaide Strikers before battling out a hard fought win against the Perth Scorchers at home. After losing a couple of early wickets, a {{steadying}} partnership from Henriques and Maddinson followed. A fantastic exhibition of ball striking from Smith in his 51 from 25 balls boosted the Sixers run rate. The final two overs saw the Sixers lose 5 for 8 and bowled out for 176. In the end this was enough as the Scorchers failed to achieve the target by the narrowest of margins. The run chase began well with the Scorches 0/32 from the first four overs. Mitchell Starc then claimed three wickets in five balls with some magnificent <b>swinging</b> <b>deliveries.</b> A calming performance from Marcus North assured Perth of securing top spot on the ladder, needing only 151 runs to do so. With one over to go, Perth needed 13 runs for victory. Brett Lee was the bowler for the Sixers. After a one, four, one from the first three balls, Perth now needed seven runs from three balls. Lee bowled a dot ball as Nathan Coulter-Nile swung and missed a full ball outside off stump. Lee then bowled Coulter-Nile out, but the umpire called no-ball. Replays suggested it was a legal delivery. Lee's next delivery was a wide. In what probably should have been an unbeatable seven from the last ball, now became five from two balls. Coulter-Nile scored two runs off the next ball. The final ball saw Coulter-Nile drive to Steve Smith at long on and as the batsmen tried to make two runs for a draw the result was inevitable. Smith's throw was accurate to Lee, {{who was able to}} knock off the bails, running North out. The Scorchers fell one run short. The stunning spell of swing by Starc earned him the Player of the Match.|$|R
2500|$|Roach {{made his}} Test debut on 9July 2009. He {{was part of}} an understrength team fielded by the West Indies against Bangladesh; in the 15-man squad, there were nine {{uncapped}} players and in the Test seven West Indies players made their debut. The side was captained by Floyd Reifer who had played the last of his four Tests ten years earlier. The first XI had made themselves unavailable due to a pay dispute with the West Indies Cricket Board. His first Test wicket was that of all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan. Although Bangladesh won by 95runs, Roach helped put pressure on the Bangladesh batsmen through a combination of yorkers and <b>swinging</b> <b>deliveries,</b> although he bowled slightly wide to the left-handers. Reifer praised Roach's efforts, saying [...] "The first time I saw him as an under-19 bowler, I always {{thought he was going to}} play for West Indies. He does a lot, especially with the old ball, getting it to move in and out and he performed very well this morning, bowling decent lengths and lines". Although Bangladesh won the second Test to take the series 2–0, Roach again bowled with pace and aggression, unsettling the Bangladesh batsmen. Varying his length and exploiting the Bangladesh batsmen's weakness against short bowling– even hitting Raqibul Hasan on the elbow with one delivery– Roach proceeded to take career-best figures of 6/48 in the first innings. With 13wickets to his name, Roach finished as West Indies' leading wicket-taker from the series. Although Bangladesh won the three-match ODI series that followed 3–0, Roach was leading wicket-taker for the series, with 10wickets at an average of 16.20; in the first of the ODIs he took his maiden five-wicket haul in one day matches (5/44), beating his previous best figures of 2/29. In the second ODI, Roach was fined 10% of his match fee for bowling two beamers. The core of the same squad was retained for September's 2009 ICC Champions Trophy. Roach played in two of West Indies' three matches, as they exited the tournament in the first round, and took three wickets at 33.33.|$|R

50|$|Butt {{was born}} to a middle-class family in Lahore and despite being named ahead of the likes of Waqar, Wasim and Aaqib in the {{domestic}} fast-bowling circuit in the 80s, he had to quit cricket in Pakistan and leave for UAE where he worked minimum-wage jobs to feed his family in Lahore. But the turning point in his career came when he was noticed by UAE cricket officials in the early 90s while he practiced in the nets in Abu Dhabi. Butt got an immediate call-up for the national side camp where {{he was able to}} impress his case upon the selectors. During that time, when the UAE cricket team was in its formative phase, a bowler of Butts caliber who could seam five in six <b>deliveries,</b> <b>swing</b> both ways and clock up to 90 mph was an obvious choice.|$|R
2500|$|The {{day began}} well, {{and the weather}} was {{pleasant}} and sunny. Steve Waugh immediately unleashed his pack of fast bowlers, who posed a formidable threat to the Indian pair of Sehwag and Chopra. But the two openers, handled them with ease and looked {{the part of a}} top order pair. Sehwag took advantage of an ordinary bowling spell by Andy Bichel, flicking and driving confidently. He could not, however, negotiate the full and <b>swinging</b> <b>deliveries</b> and was dropped off one such delivery by Nathan Bracken. But the speedster had his revenge as he scalped Sehwag for his first wicket in tests. Sehwag departed for a fast 45 from only 51 balls. The score stood at 61/1. Later, Rahul Dravid batting on one, was tricked by a Jason Gillespie delivery into poking at a delivery that swung and seamed away. This produced a fatal edge that Hayden gleefully accepted. Dravid departed for 1 and the score was 62/2. In the very same over, Sachin Tendulkar came out to bat. After batting out two uneventful balls, Gillespie let loose a quick one. Picking the line of the ball early as the ball seemed like missing the off-stump, Tendulkar shouldered arms and the ball went and thudded onto his pads. Umpire Steve Bucknor looked blank for some time and finally raised his finger. Bucknor had already had a history of bad umpiring earlier in this match, overriding straightforward appeals against the Australian batsmen in their first innings, and this decision made things worse for him. His decision did not go too well with Tendulkar's Australian fans. Some of them reportedly made remarks like: [...] ""Didn't he turn down two straightforward appeals against the Australian batsmen on the first day? Don't they call him a batsman's umpire?" [...] and some others said, [...] "Hey mate, we came to watch Tendulkar bat, not Bucknor wag his finger." [...] But Tendulkar took the decision with grace. Robert Craddock, writing in The Australian, commented that, [...] "World cricket does not need electronic help to sort out lbw decisions. It just needs better umpiring. Steve Bucknor shouldn't have needed a camera to give Sachin Tendulkar not out when he was struck high ... Bucknor, a delightful fellow, was a great umpire at his zenith but there have been signs in recent times he is slipping and there is a gap emerging between his still high reputation and his performance." [...] Rajan Bala also wrote in the Asian Age:"In an earlier birth Bucknor might have been one of those Roman emperors who ensured that the crowds at the Coliseum were kept in suspense before he gave the thumbs-down signal to end the life of a gladiator or a Christian." [...] In fact, so annoyed were the fans that during Ganguly's innings, when he was struck in the shoulder, they said aloud: [...] "Give him out now." [...] The comment was noted to be quite sarcastic in nature.|$|R
25|$|Pietersen began 2009 with {{questions}} over his form, where many pundits viewed {{him to be}} in a slump. He was dismissed first ball in the first Test against the touring West Indies side dismissed by the full, <b>swinging</b> ball (a <b>delivery</b> which he seemed to struggle against), but in the second Test made a quick 49 before falling to an attacking shot. He then suffered what seemed only a minor right Achilles injury and was subsequently ruled out of the ODI series, which England also won. In June 2009, Pietersen played in England's World Twenty20 warm-up match against Scotland, registering an unbeaten 53 in a six-wicket England victory. He also appeared in the news after accidentally hitting a 15-year-old school boy with a cricket ball from a straight-drive after the boy had bowled to him. Pietersen left the boy, from Suffolk, with a signed bat as compensation.|$|R
50|$|These {{consistent}} performances led to {{his selection}} in the fifth test against the English side. It had been a rapid rise, selected for a test {{only a few weeks}} after his first class debut, but the selectors were keen to trial new players following the loss of the Ashes at home that summer; Percy Hornibrook and Tim Wall were also selected. One writer described him as:Over six feet, straight as a ramrod, for one his size he is remarkably quick on his feet. Fairfax has a taking style of bowling, with a free <b>swinging</b> high over-arm <b>delivery.</b> If he cultivates some of the subtleties such as characterised H. Trumble, G. Giffen, and M. A. Noble, he may become a top-sawyer. His height and high delivery alone are deadly assets on wickets affected by rain. He is a keen field, as befits a good baseballer. As batsman, Fairfax has the fundamental of defence. On top of that, he can hit the ball as hard as any man in the game this season. And he is good at the pinch.|$|R
