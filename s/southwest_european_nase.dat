5000|$|The monastery {{is located}} near the Piedra River Canyon, home to many species of birds, damselflies, trout, and {{endangered}} fish like the South-west <b>European</b> <b>nase</b> and an endangered species of barbel. The canyon itself includes a network of mossy, garden-like caves (natural and man-made), waterfalls and lagoons that contrast with the otherwise dry hills of southern Aragon. The tallest waterfall is [...] "Horsetail" [...] (Cola del Caballo), more than fifty meters high. The dissolution and precipitation of local limestone has created numerous rivulets, springs, and Karst topography. The Piedra River meanders around a mountain known as [...] "El Espolón" [...] (The Ram). In 1959, a dam was constructed across the river, which created the 1300 acre La Tranquera Reservoir, flooding part of the canyon, {{some of the best}} local farmland, and several villages. The roofs of some drowned houses can still be seen when the water levels are down. The reservoir provides domestic water supply, irrigation and electrical energy.

40|$|Abstract: The {{restoration}} of longitudinal connectivity of a watercourse altered by man-made obstacles {{is a key}} issue for the protection and safeguard of freshwater ecosystems {{and the construction of}} fish passes constitutes a relevant ad hoc measure. However, in many countries, like Italy, there is still not an adequate technical-scientific background and experience in this field and therefore several migratory species have become extinct or are suffering from severe impacts. The main elements of the river rehabilitation for fish project promoted by the Modena Province concerning the middle course of the Panaro River (North Italy), a watercourse characterised by high naturalistic and environmental values but fragmented by several weirs built to prevent riverbed erosion, are presented in this paper. The case study is analysed through the main steps that were carried out to define a preliminary plan for the {{restoration of}} the river continuity for the migration of four target species (South <b>European</b> <b>nase</b> (Chondrostoma genei), Italian barbel (Barbus plebejus), chub (Leuciscus cephalus cabeda) and soufie (Leuciscus souffia muticellus)) through the design of an innovative type of steep-slope fish ramp with large-scale roughness elements.

40|$|Annual cycles in {{long time}} series of {{precipitation}} from sixteen <b>southwest</b> <b>European</b> observatories have been analysed using complex demodulation. The stations have been clustered into two distinct regions and a hybrid one. They {{are referred to}} as the southwestern Europe precipitation Atlantic regime (SEPAR) and the southwestern Europe precipitation Mediterranean regime (SEPMER), with the hybrid regime referred to in terms of the mean amplitude ratios between semiannual and annual rainfall components. Some evidence of linking between seasonal cycle harmonic amplitudes and the zonal circulation has been found for SEPAR stations and a more obscured relationship for the SEPMER region. Within the SEPAR region the strength of the relationship is diminished towards the north. A trend analysis of the amplitudes against time since 1920 has also been carried out and the results reveal a divergent pattern in trends between annual and semiannual component amplitudes for the SEPAR region. In fact, both an increasing annual-amplitude trend and a decreasing semiannual-amplitude trend are observed, in each case statistically significant. The fact that the seasonal cycle variability of rainfall in southwestern Europe becomes more sensitive southwards to changes in atmospheric zonal circulation over the North Atlantic might, in our opinion, be related to the swing of the circumpolar vortex...|$|R

Genotyping was performed using PCR amplification followed by digestion of products with specific restrictases. In a population of 260 healthy women (permanent residents of the <b>southwest</b> <b>European</b> Russia), mutant allele frequencies at the C 282 Y and H 63 D sites were evaluated as 3. 3 and 16. 3 %, respectively. In patients with breast, ovarian, and endometrial cancer, C 282 Y frequencies were also low (1. 0, 1. 3, and 3. 8 %, respectively), and no cancer risk associated with the C 282 Y mutation was found. Odds ratios for breast cancer risk associated with the H 63 D mutation increased significantly with age: 0. 5 in women below 48 years old, 1. 0 {{in a range of}} 48 – 57 years, and 4. 4 in older women (Ptrend= 0. 002). The latter value was statistically significant (95 % CI, 1. 4 – 14. 1), indicating that women bearing the H 63 D mutation may be at an increased breast cancer risk at an age above 57 years.

40|$|Quantification of {{sediment}} volumes in continental to deep ocean basins {{is key to}} understanding processes {{of sediment}} distribution in source-to-sink depositional systems. Using our own and published data we present the first quantification of sediment-volume changes in basins along {{the course of a}} major <b>southwest</b> <b>European</b> river during the deglaciation. The salient points of this quantitative record in the Tagus and equivalent North Atlantic basins show crucial roles for sea level, climate and land-use in the distribution of sediments. The bypass of sediments starved the Tagus basins, and subsequently sedimentation mainly occurred on the Tagus Abyssal Plain during the sea-level lowstand of the Last Glacial Maximum. The main sediment depocenter rapidly shifted via the continental shelf to the Lower Tagus Valley during sea-level rise in the deglaciation period. Finally, the main sediment depocenter shifted further landward into the Lower Tagus Valley during sea-level high stand in the Holocene. During the high-stand phase (last 7 ky), sediment flux increased up to 2. 5 times, due to climate and land-use changes. The average catchment denudation rate during the last 12 ky (0. 04 – 0. 1 mm/y) is in agreement with those of other European catchments. Our study clearly demonstrates the added value of detailed knowledge of 3 D depocenter distribution, size and chronology. This allowed us to identify an increased sediment flux during the last 7 ky, which was not identified using local observations from boreholes alone. The uniqueness of the Tagus depositional system lies in the combination of a large accommodation space in the bedrock-confined Lower Tagus Valley, the steep lowstand-surface gradient and the narrow continental shelf with canyons indenting the shelf break...|$|R

The two hypotheses {{about the origin}} of VL in the NW suggest (1) recent importation of L. infantum from the Old World (OW), or (2) an indigenous origin and a distinct taxonomic rank for the NW parasite. Multilocus microsatellite typing was applied in a survey of 98 L. infantum isolates from different NW foci. The microsatellite profiles obtained were compared to those of 308 L. infantum and 20 L. donovani strains from OW countries previously assigned to well-defined populations. Two main populations were identified for both NW and OW L. infantum. Most of the NW strains belonged to population 1, which corresponded to the OW MON- 1 population. However, the NW population was much more homogeneous. A second, more heterogeneous, population comprised most Caribbean strains and corresponded to the OW non-MON- 1 population. All Brazilian L. infantum strains belonged to population 1, although they represented 61 % of the sample and originated from 9 states. Population analysis including the OW L. infantum populations indicated that the NW strains were more similar to MON- 1 and non-MON- 1 sub-populations of L. infantum from southwest Europe, than to any other OW sub-population. Moreover, similarity between NW and <b>Southwest</b> <b>European</b> L. infantum was higher than between OW L. infantum from distinct parts of the Mediterranean region, Middle East and Central Asia. No correlation was found between NW L. infantum genotypes and clinical picture or host background. This study represents the first continent-wide analysis of NW L. infantum population structure. It confirmed that the agent of VL in the NW is L. infantum and that the parasite has been recently imported multiple times to the NW from southwest Europe...|$|R
40|$|Traditional smoked and/or cured salami-like {{products}} are much appreciated by <b>Southwest</b> <b>European</b> consumers.

In this work {{the effect of the}} application of two bacteriocinogenic lactic acid bacteria (LAB) Lb. plantarum ST 202 and Lb. sakei ST 153 for controlling Listeria monocytogenes growth in “Alheira”, a traditional salami-like product, was investigated. The paste of ‘‘Alheira’,’ produced by an industrial meat company, was sterilized by autoclaving before inoculation and L. monocytogenes growth was evaluated during 15 days of storage. Both LAB strains showed antilisterial activity in the inoculated paste, but as in preliminary experiments with sterilized minced pork meat only strain ST 153 presented activity against L. monocytogenes. it was decided, for further industrial tests, to use only this strain. Therefore, the effect of Lb. sakei ST 153 against L. monocytogenes in industrially processed “Alheira”, packed under vacuum or under modified atmosphere (MA) (20 % CO 2 and 80 % N 2), was evaluated during 7 days storage at 4 ºC. The effect of the inoculation of the bacteriocinogenic culture in the organoleptic properties of “Alheira” was also investigated. A quantitative descriptive sensory test was performed by a semi-trained panel after 5 days storage. No significant differences were observed in the microbiological and sensory quality of “Alheira” packed under vacuum or MA. A significant reduction in the level of L. monocytogenes was observed in the presence of Lb. sakei ST 153 (2 log cycles reduction during the first 7 days). Results showed that panellists did not find significant differences between “Alheira” with Lb. sakei ST 153 addition and commercial control, except for mass connection, acid taste and atypical taste. Despite that, both samples were scored above conformity limit. Thus, the application of LAB is a very promising mean of preventing L. monocytogenes growth in “Alheira”...|$|R

40|$|Variation in 815 bp of {{mitochondrial}} DNA {{from two}} gene fragments (300 bp of cytochrome b and 395 – 515 bp of 12 S rRNA) for 26 Malpolon monspessulanus, and cytochrome b {{for a further}} 21 individuals, indicates that this species originated in the Maghreb area of Northwest Africa. Here, an estimated 3. 5 – 6 Mya, it divided into the western M. m. monspessulanus, and an eastern clade including M. m. insignitus and M. m. fuscus. The very limited genetic differentiation between Maghreb and <b>Southwest</b> <b>European</b> populations of this form suggests that it arrived in the Iberian Peninsula only recently. Population genetics and demographic tests indicate subsequent expansion in this area around 83, 000 – 168, 000 year ago. Because present populations of Malpolon arrived recently, mid-Pliocene and at least some Pleistocene fossils of the genus Malpolon in Southwest Europe are probably derived from an earlier invasion from the Maghreb, possibly {{as early as the}} end of the Miocene period, 5. 3 – 5. 9 Mya, when there was a temporary land bridge across the site of the Strait of Gibraltar and the Mediterranean Sea desiccated. The descendants of this earlier invasion must have eventually become extinct, perhaps during one of the Pleistocene glaciations. In contrast to the western M. m. monspessulanus, the greater genetic divergence found in the eastern clade of M. monspessulanus suggests that it dispersed at an earlier date and probably over a longer period, spreading eastwards through northern Libya and Egypt to Syria, Iraq, and Iran, and around the Mediterranean Sea through Turkey into the Aegean archipelagos and the Balkan peninsula. The western and eastern units of M. monspessulanus have different dorsal color pattern, differences in skull structure and exhibit an 8. 4 % uncorrected genetic divergence in the combined gene fragments investigated here. It is consequently recommended that they should be treated as separate species: M. monspessulanus (sensu stricto) and Malpolon insignitus stat. nov., the latter including the subspecies Malpolon insignitus fuscus comb. nov. The same combined mitochondrial gene fragments used in Malpolon were investigated in 20 individuals of Hemorrhois hippocrepis, and of cytochrome b alone in a further 17. They indicate that this species also originated in the Maghreb and again invaded the Iberian Peninsula quite recently. Some of the most recent invasions of the Iberian Peninsula by reptiles and amphibian taxa could probably be anthropogenic in origin. Some other species including M. monspessulanus and H. hippocrepis, may have crossed naturally, by 'hopping' across the Strait of Gibraltar via temporary islands on the shallowest parts that were exposed during sea-level fall associated with Pleistocene glaciations...|$|R

Sometimes the names Alpine Tethys or Western Tethys Ocean are used to describe a number of small oceanic basins that formed <b>southwest</b> of the <b>European</b> plate, to distinguish them from the Neo-Tethys Ocean in the east.

These investigations were {{not confined to the}} Ria proper, but also included the affluent rivers like the Rio Ulla and Rio Umia. These explorations will be continued in 1964. In July 1963 a specimen of a peculiar isopod was found by the oceanographic party when exploring the Rio Ulla, a river emptying in the northeastern corner of the Ria de Arosa. This find caused the biologists to give more attention to the locality where the animal was caught and many more specimens were obtained there during a trip specially organized for the purpose. A study of the collected material revealed that the isopods are Valvifera belonging to the subfamily Mesidoteinae of the family Idoteidae. However, they could not be fitted into any of the known genera of this subfamily and consequently are described here as constituting a new genus and species. The facts that (1) the species is not rare in the type locality, (2) the specimens are of good size, measuring up to 15 mm, and (3) they inhabit a habitat which is neither unusual nor difficult to explore, make it difficult to understand why the present form has not been discovered before.

Thirty-nine SNPs were located in 16 of the 27 coding regions. The sxt gene clusters of NIVA-CYA 851, NIVA-CYA 655, NIVA-CYA 676 and UAM 529, were characterized by 15, 16, 19 and 23 SNPs respectively. Only the Norwegian strain NIVA-CYA 851 possessed an insertion of 126 base pairs (bp) in the noncoding area between the sxtA and sxtE genes and a deletion of 6 nucleotides in the sxtN gene. The sxtI gene showed the highest variability and is recommended as the best genetic marker for further phylogenetic studies of the sxt gene cluster of A. gracile. This study confirms {{for the first time the}} role of A. gracile as a PSP toxin producer in Norwegian waters, representing the northernmost occurrence of PSP toxin producing A. gracile in Europe known so far...|$|R

On the five departments which this region counts, four of them have a maritime front on the Golf du Lion and are confronted with the preservation of the attractiveness of the sea resorts, with the problems linked with the rehabilitation of the tourist buildings and with the future of these littoral areas today which welcome about 10 million tourists a year. Among the public initiatives carried out by the communities of this region, a departmental device marked the history of the local development in the southwest of France. From a work of thesis, this communication will show how touristic activities were thought and organized from a rural zone in process of desertion, and how these activities were the ferments of a touristic territorial politics on the scale of a department possessing a maritime front. The invention of the Pays Cathare, is above all the emergence of an innovatiing development project while leaning on the historical and architectural heritage (cofinanced by the Leader programs I and II, 1992, 1999) which had for objective to revitalize a rural economy in trouble. From the end of 1980 s, the Department of the Aude wished to set up a politicy of communication, arrangement and touristic development which formed itself around a federative subject: the cathar fact. Symbol of the occitan autonomy, finding an echo in the local imagination, The Image of “ Pays Cathare ” led to a politicy of cultural activities on this whole department and allowed to set this touristic destination on the scale of the <b>European</b> <b>southwest.</b> Highlighting a diachronic view, about this example of the Department of Aude, the capacity of mobilization of the local actors around the touristic project, the forms and the specific actions which structure it as well as the networks which are at the root of them, by revealing the connection of this activity with the other local resources, the various constituents of the local touristic offer (in particular the coast), we finally suggest elements of interpretation of the durability of the touristic project which finds not only its appropriate specificity but also its real anchoring within the social, political and economic structures which work {{in the heart of the}} territorial development...|$|R
40|$|The Southwest {{region of}} Western Australia is a {{recognised}} ‘biodiversity hotspot’, as it possesses {{high levels of}} biodiversity and endemism; it also holds a number of species threatened by habitat loss. The arrival of Europeans in the region wrought major changes on the natural landscape. Extensive tracts of bushland were cleared for housing, infrastructure, forestry, farming, and mining. Another challenge to regional biodiversity was the spread of exotic plants and animals (including birds); the latter provide the focus for the present study. The research examines four bird species that colonised the <b>Southwest</b> region following <b>European</b> settlement: Australian White Ibis (Threskiornis molucca); Spotted Dove (Streptopelia chinensis); Laughing Dove (S. senegalensis) and Laughing Kookaburra (Dacelo novaeguineae). The study examines how the feeding and breeding ecology of the species influenced colonisation success and dispersal, specifically in relation to geographic i. e. climate and anthropogenic (e. g. landuse) features of the region. Each of these species {{has been identified as}} a ‘generalist’ feeder, with flexible ecological needs. The species have been able to adapt their food preferences and way of life to living in proximity to human settlements. It appears that each utilised resources made available through human endeavour and activities. It appears that the most rapid spread of invaders occurs in areas of modified habitat, in which the proportion covered by natural ecosystems has declined: i. e. in urban areas, pastoral lands and agricultural areas, although conserved natural habitats have also been invaded. The results indicate clear associations between the extent of colonisation success in the first wave of dispersal, and anthropogenic phenomena. Such is evidenced by the range expansion of Australian White Ibis into coastal urban areas, within which foraging success is assisted by access to alternative food sources and roost sites; whereas the species’ movement inland is linked to habitats associated with dairy farming and cattle production. However, the biology of each species and the extent of its ecological flexibility are also influencing factors, as attested by the wide-spread dispersal of the Laughing Kookaburra throughout the study area. This species possesses physiological features that give it an energy advantage over other species and it possesses social behaviours which offer further ecological advantages. Although it is a combination of factors: the biological attributes of the species (which define the ecological aspects of its survival), the geographical features of the adopted landscape, and the impact of human imprint upon that landscape that affect the process of biological invasion, the outcomes are specific to each species. This is shown in the development of markedly different patterns of dispersal, as between the two Streptopelia doves, despite their arriving in the study area under (approximately) the same conditions, and sharing almost identical ecological profiles. As, despite being released into rural areas, the Spotted Dove retained a localised, mainly urban, population, whilst the Laughing Dove has become spread across both urban and rural environments. This may be due to differences in the ability of each species to tolerate dryland conditions, which appear to better suit the Laughing Dove, perhaps due to similarities in climate between the adopted range and the areas from which it originates. It is felt that the study has augmented existing knowledge of biological invasion events in the study area, and contributed towards a greater understanding of biological invasion phenomena, particularly those associated with wheat production, processing, and transport. The study design incorporated Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technology as a means of processing large volumes of historical data. The methodology developed for the study could be adapted to other species, regions and eras, provided sufficient data are available. It produces temporal snapshots of changes in distributions, which can be considered in relation to changes in climate conditions and landuse practices...|$|R
