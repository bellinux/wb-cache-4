5|$|Route X43 was {{initially}} {{served with a}} mixture of double-deck Leyland Titans and <b>single-deck</b> Leyland Tigers. In the early 1960s these were replaced by new Leyland Leopards. From 1974 coaches were used on the route, with Leyland Leopards again the preferred choice. In 1982 a small number were branded for the route, using the name Timesaver and the tagline Regular Motorway service.|$|E
5|$|It {{was founded}} as Tillingbourne Valley in 1924, {{and became a}} limited company in 1931, taking the name Tillingbourne Valley Services. It {{initially}} operated routes in the Guildford area from a garage in Chilworth using small <b>single-deck</b> buses painted in a maroon livery. Coach hire and excursions began in 1931, but two years later these activities split into a separate company, Tillingbourne Valley Coaches, which operated independently for a further 24 years. Until 1970 Tillingbourne was owned and managed by three generations of the Trice family, before being sold to Trevor Brown.|$|E
5|$|Stagecoach's {{operations}} in the Burnley area were sold to the Blazefield Group on 15 April 2001 and rebranded as Burnley & Pendle.In June 2001 one X43 journey in each direction was extended through to Skipton and Hawes on summer Sundays. This proved relatively successful, and the <b>single-deck</b> coach initially used {{was replaced by a}} double-decker. It continued to operate into 2003, but was withdrawn at the end of September. Fares on the route increased by 30% in the two years up to August 2004, prompting some passengers to abandon the route in favour of a car sharing scheme. Despite this, the route saw an average of 12% yearly growth between 2001 and 2004.|$|E
25|$|National Express West Midlands {{is one of}} {{the largest}} bus {{operators}} in the UK, with a fleet of nearly 1,600 vehicles. A variety of bus types are used, including double-decks, <b>single-decks,</b> articulated and midi-buses.|$|R
50|$|In 2013 buses {{started to}} be painted into the new First Bus livery and 'West of England' {{branding}} was applied on both sides beneath the windows (on some <b>single-decks</b> the branding is applied above the windows towards {{the front of the}} bus). First Somerset & Avon is still printed on some tickets, while other tickets are printed with First Bristol & Avon or just First Bristol.|$|R
50|$|Lest it {{be thought}} the RU was unpopular with everyone, the late batch of eight 11-metre {{versions}} supplied to Darlington Transport were well liked {{by the operator}} {{and they tried to}} commission more from Seddon Atkinson after the end of production, this was not to be and Darlington (whose other <b>single-decks</b> were then Daimler Roadliners and Daimler Fleetlines) instead bought four dual-door Leyland Leopards in 1977, their next two new vehicle orders went to Dennis for single deck Marshall-bodied Dominators, then in 1983 they got Ward Motors Ltd to build them six RU-like vehicles called the GRXI (for Gardner, Rear-engine 11 metres. This latter in Roman numerals). These differed from the RU only in having 180 bhp Gardner 6HLXB engines, ZF power steering and Wadham Stringer Vanguard B45D bodies, a further six were optioned, but the Ward Brothers' company went bankrupt before these could be built.|$|R
5|$|Government of Ontario Transit (later {{abbreviated}} as 'GO Transit') {{started as}} a three-year long experiment on May 23, 1967 running <b>single-deck</b> trains powered by diesel locomotives in push-pull configuration on a single rail line along Lake Ontario's shoreline. GO Train service ran throughout the day from Oakville to Pickering with limited rush hour train service to Hamilton. The experiment proved to be extremely popular; GO Transit carried its first million riders during its first four months, and averaged 15,000 per day soon after. This line, now divided as the Lakeshore East and Lakeshore West lines is the keystone corridor of GO Transit. Expansion of rail service continued in the 1970s and 1980s, aimed at developing ridership in {{with the introduction of}} the Georgetown (now Kitchener) line in 1974 and the Richmond Hill line in 1978. The Milton GO Train line opened in 1981, followed by the Bradford (now Barrie) and Stouffville lines a year later, establishing the 7 rail corridors that today's rail service is based upon.|$|E
5|$|The first {{vehicle to}} be bought by Tillingbourne was a <b>single-deck</b> Chevrolet with 14 seats, which entered service on {{the launch of the}} company's first route in 1924. It was joined by a similar Overland Automobile bus later in the year. Two further {{vehicles}} had been purchased by 1928, when a depot fire destroyed three of the four buses. They were replaced by second-hand buses including an 18-seat Dennis and several Thornycroft A2 vehicles. From November 1934 until the outbreak of World War II, these were progressively replaced by new buses, also built by Thornycroft. The first double-deck vehicle {{to be bought}} was a Bristol K Type, which joined the fleet in 1959. Eight Guy Vixens were bought from London Transport between 1963 and 1964 to replace the entire previous fleet. These were succeeded by a wide variety of types, with Bedford coaches and buses the most numerous. In the 1970s, a number of second-hand Bristol SUL4A's, with ECW B36F bodies, were operated.|$|E

25|$|The next {{thoroughly}} {{new type}} was the TS6 from January 1933; this {{had all the}} improvements afforded to the contemporary TD3 Titan, including the neater front radiator and bonnet assembly, but the same wheelbase and overall-length as the TS1. For operators requiring 30ft long <b>single–decks</b> a TS6D or TS6T Tiger was made available from 1934, the TS6D was 6x4 and the TS6T 6x2 with only the leading axle in the rear bogie powered. The TS7 and TS8 (and three-axled variants) were similarly derived from the TD4 and TD5 Titans, adopting their features. The suffix c (e.g., TS8c) indicated a torque-converter transmission. The TS9 and TS10 Tigers were never released for sale but the TS11 was equivalent to the TD7 Titan and very few were built, most during World War II, during that war the SMT group of bus companies in Scotland converted many of their two and three-axle Tigers to Titan specification and fitted double-deck 55-seat bodies to them.|$|R
2500|$|Unitrans is {{the transit}} system which {{operates}} in Davis, California. [...] It takes {{its name from}} an abbreviation of the words [...] "University Transport". [...] Excepting several managerial and maintenance positions, Unitrans is managed and operated entirely by students of the University of California, Davis who usually work part-time while attending school. The system is well known throughout the area for its use of several distinctive ex-Transport for London double-decker buses, as well as its fleet of modern natural gas <b>single-decks.</b> Ridership exceeds 3 million passenger-trips per year on 18 weekday, 2 school-only and 6 weekend routes. Current fares are $1.00 for the general public and included in student fees for undergraduate University attendees. Unitrans is one of a small number of transit systems in the United States to operate double deck buses in regular (non-sightseeing) service (the others include The Deuce in Las Vegas, Nevada, Antelope Valley Transit Authority in Lancaster/Palmdale, California, SLO Transit in San Luis Obispo and Community Transit in Snohomish County, Washington). [...] Unitrans has one of the best safety records of any public transit system in the US.|$|R
25|$|Not {{mentioned}} in the table of Ottoman ships are 10 further <b>single-deck</b> frigates, and 30 corvettes and 28 brigs. The corvettes and brigs carried 1134 guns.|$|E
25|$|Card {{counting}} is {{most rewarding}} {{near the end}} of a complete shoe when as few as possible cards remain. <b>Single-deck</b> games are therefore particularly susceptible to card counting. As a result, casinos are more likely to insist that players do not reveal their cards to one another in <b>single-deck</b> games. In games with more decks of cards, casinos limit penetration by ending the shoe and reshuffling when one or more decks remain undealt. Casinos also sometimes use a shuffling machine to reintroduce the exhausted cards every time a deck has been played.|$|E
25|$|The buses {{were painted}} in the same maroon and cream livery as the trams. The fleet {{was a mixture of}} <b>single-deck</b> buses, open top {{double-deck}} buses, and open-sided charabancs.|$|E
25|$|The {{body of the}} Enviro500 {{was based}} on the {{original}} style of the <b>single-deck</b> Enviro300, and the upper-deck frontal design was similar to the design used on the Plaxton President body.|$|E
25|$|CTC owns 257 trams, {{of which}} 125 trams are {{running on the}} streets of Kolkata on a daily basis. The cars are <b>single-deck</b> {{articulated}} cars and can carry 200 passengers (60 seated).|$|E
25|$|Nottingham {{became the}} first city in England to operate a regular bus service with ethanol-fueled vehicles. Three ED95 <b>single-deck</b> buses entered regular service in the city in March 2008. Soon after, Reading also {{introduced}} ED95 double-deck buses.|$|E
25|$|Because the charabanc motor {{coaches were}} not in use in the winter months, some would be re-fitted with <b>single-deck</b> bus bodies and put into route service, {{while some of the}} {{remaining}} charabancs would be used in route service in case of extreme need. During the tram electrification programme, some were refitted with truck bodies to assist the works.|$|E
25|$|The Sheffield Tramway Company's {{original}} horse-drawn tram {{network was}} 9½ {{miles long and}} radiated from the city centre to Tinsley, Brightside, Hillsborough, Nether Edge and Heeley. A few years after Sheffield Corporation took over horse tramways were gradually replaced first by <b>single-deck,</b> then double-deck electric trams. It extended routes to Beauchief and Woodseats in 1927 and to Darnall and Intake in 1928.|$|E
25|$|In April, {{quotations}} {{were received}} from the Daimler Company for the supply of motorbuses. An order was placed with them for two single-deckers of the 40 h.p. type fitted with Dodson 25-seat (plus three next to the driver) clerestory-roof <b>single-deck</b> bodies. These were to provide a service between the Derby Road tramway at Gregory Street and Dunkirk, with a l½d. through transfer ticket.|$|E
25|$|In {{conjunction}} with the original Titan, Leyland Motors offered the same mechanical advances in a <b>single-deck</b> bus or coach chassis, in half-cab (forward-control) form this was called the Tiger, with normal-control derivatives with the driver behind the engine bonnet and sharing the saloon with the passengers generally being called Tigress. The Tiger from 1927-42 went through derivatives from TS1 to TS11.|$|E
25|$|In May 2005, Plaxton {{announced}} its {{return to the}} service bus market, launching the Centro, a low-floor <b>single-deck</b> vehicle initially to be offered on VDL SB120 chassis, in 10.7 m length, with the first bus completed in February 2006. The Centro is now available on the VDL SB180, VDL SB200, MAN 14.220 and Volvo B7RLE chassis, with 10.2 m and 12 m lengths also offered.|$|E
25|$|Many routes were {{converted}} to One-man operation (OMO) in the 1970s, to reduce operating costs {{and in response to}} staff shortages. There was also for a time a parts shortage for Routemasters, aggravated by the closure of AEC. With the introduction of <b>single-deck</b> Red Arrow services and successful conversion to modern, rear-engined OMO buses around the country, London Transport considered replacing Routemasters with modern buses.|$|E
25|$|Cards are dealt {{either from}} one or two {{handheld}} decks, from a dealer's shoe, or from a shuffling machine. Single cards are dealt to each wagered-on position clockwise from the dealer's left, followed by a single card to the dealer, followed by an additional card {{to each of the}} positions in play. The players' initial cards may be dealt face up or face down (more common in <b>single-deck</b> games).|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} new {{vehicles}} {{were added to the}} bus fleet in the late 1940s and 1950s, and in 1958 one-person operation was introduced. Trolleybus operation in Portsmouth ended in July 1963. From 1963 until the late 1970s PCT standardised on the double-deck Leyland Atlantean for new purchases, retaining much older vehicles for open-top services. In 1971 the company took the unusual step of purchasing twelve Atlanteans with <b>single-deck</b> bodywork.|$|E
25|$|Cypress Street Viaduct/Nimitz Freeway, Interstate 880: The double-decked Cypress Street Viaduct, Interstate 880 was {{demolished}} {{soon after}} the earthquake, and was not replaced until July 1997. The replacement freeway section is a <b>single-deck</b> rather than double-deck structure, and was re-routed around the outskirts of West Oakland, rather than bisecting it as the Cypress Street Viaduct had done. The former route of the Cypress Street Viaduct was reopened as the ground-level Mandela Parkway.|$|E
25|$|All {{other local}} bus {{services}} are now operated by modern low-floor buses, {{which may be}} <b>single-deck</b> or double-deck. Most buses operating in London have two sets of doors, and passengers board the bus using {{the front door and}} alight using the rear door, whilst some buses on less busy routes have only one door. All these buses conform to the Disability discrimination act, and can accept passengers in wheelchairs and other mobility impaired passengers.|$|E
25|$|The {{version of}} Siemens metro train {{designed}} for Melbourne included several attributes similar to existing Melbourne suburban electric trains {{such as being}} <b>single-deck</b> and operating in M-T-M (motor-trailer-motor) sets of three carriages, where the motor cars each have an overhead pantograph, and two of these 3-car sets are generally coupled {{together to form a}} 6-carriage train when run in revenue service, though a single set may be run when demand does not merit a full train.|$|E
25|$|In 2007 London Buses route ELW Whitechapel – Shadwell – Wapping was introduced, {{operating}} every 10 minutes, every 15 {{minutes at}} evenings and weekends. It was operated with route-branded <b>single-deck</b> buses. Starting on 23 December 2007 it was extended from Whitechapel to Shoreditch (Monday-Friday 07:00-10:30 & 15:30–20:30, Sunday 07:00-15:30) from 19 July 2008. The {{frequency of the}} route was cut to four buses per hour in September 2009. It was reduced to weekends-only from 28 April 2010, and withdrawn on 9 May 2010.|$|E
25|$|The {{system is}} divided into six fare zones, the only transit system in Hong Kong to employ such zoning. The feeder buses have fares {{independent}} of these zones, but provide discounts when passengers interchange between these buses and LRT. 70 <b>single-deck</b> LRVs were manufactured in Melbourne and Brisbane, Australia by Comeng, and shipped to Hong Kong for the seven LRT routes in the system. Three of the routes were to Yuen Long {{and the others were}} confined to Tuen Mun.|$|E
25|$|Gateshead 52 was {{originally}} a <b>single-deck</b> 'California' style tram until the open end compartments were covered over around 1903. Was {{involved in an}} accident in 1916 after it rolled down a steep hill with passengers on board. After this it was rebuilt to its present format and was withdrawn in 1951. Bought by its former driver, it passed to the National Tramway Museum on his death, where it was stored, and damaged in an arson attack. It was transferred to Beamish in 2014, with a full restoration planned.|$|E
25|$|In 2012 {{a further}} 100 new {{vehicles}} entered service, {{with the addition}} of more Wright Eclipse Urban 2 <b>single-deck</b> buses at Wolverhampton, Acocks Green, Birmingham Central and Pensnett garages to replace older single deckers such as Mercedes-Benz O405Ns and some Volvo B6LEs at Pensnett garages, Volvo B10Ls at Acocks Green and Optare Excels at Wolverhampton. A further 30 Alexander Dennis Enviro200s have entered service on routes 99, 222 and on routes at West Bromwich garage, replacing Volvo B6LEs. An extensive refurbishment programme has seen many older buses repainted into the new livery, as well as having etched windows and upholsteries replaced.|$|E
25|$|Through the 1970s Unitrans added eight former London Transport RT type {{double-deck}} buses, and in {{the early}} 1980s Unitrans added two Daimler Fleetline double-deck buses that had previously operated in Yorkshire, a county in northern England. The late 1970s and early 1980s saw the addition of a 40-foot and a number of 35-foot General Motors New Look buses. In 1982 Unitrans purchases its first all new, never before used, buses when it purchased five 35-foot Gillig Phantoms from the manufacturer in Hayward, California. Two RT type double-decker buses were retired in the early 1980s, and by this time the fleet of <b>single-deck</b> buses outnumbered the double-deckers.|$|E
25|$|In 1966 {{the removal}} of disused railway bridges on Easter Road enabled the busy Leith {{circular}} services to be converted to double-deck operation. Many of the Tiger Cubs were sold to Ulsterbus, and the <b>single-deck</b> fleet declined markedly. No more large single-deckers were purchased until 1975, when twelve more Y-type Leopards (to a more conventional specification) were purchased, and ten 1974 Bedford YRTs with similar bodies to coach specification were downgraded to service buses after only 1 season. Twenty dual-door Leyland Nationals arrived in 1982-85, followed by 12 dual-door Leyland Lynx in 1991. Later, some reconditioned secondhand Leyland Nationals were purchased for use on tendered services.|$|E
25|$|Provincial, meanwhile, rebranded {{itself as}} People's Provincial, using {{a dark green}} and cream livery. It {{substantially}} expanded its operations in Portsmouth after Transit Holdings acquired Portsmouth Citybus, believing that its use of minibuses had left a gap in demand for services using larger vehicles. Former NBC vehicles such as the double-deck Bristol VR and <b>single-deck</b> Leyland National were used on most routes. The company {{was taken over by}} FirstGroup in October 1995. First acquired Portsmouth Citybus from Transit in April 1996 and merged the two under the Provincial name, giving the company complete dominance over routes within Portsmouth. Like PCT, it is now part of First Hampshire & Dorset.|$|E
25|$|The National Tramway Museum at Crich in Derbyshire holds eight Sheffield trams. Sheffield Corporation Tramways car 15 is a horse tram {{dating from}} 1874; {{it was the}} first tram to be used at the museum in 1963 and still remains servicable. Car 74 is another Victorian Sheffield tram, sold to the Gateshead tramway and ran until 1951. Although only its lower deck survived, as a garden shed, it has been {{restored}} to original condition by the museum and is operational. The museum also has Standard car 189 (on display), Domed-roof car 264 (on display), and Roberts car 510 (operational). In addition there are two Sheffield works cars and an early <b>single-deck</b> tram that is not in working condition.|$|E
