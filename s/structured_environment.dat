40|$|Abstract—We {{present a}} novel {{tracking}} method for effectively tracking objects in <b>structured</b> <b>environments.</b> The tracking method finds applications in security surveillance, traffic monitoring, etc. In these applications, {{the movements of}} objects are constrained by <b>structured</b> <b>environments.</b> Therefore, the relationship between objects and environments can be exploited as additional information for improving the performance of tracking. We use the environment state to model {{the relationship between the}} objects and environments, and integrate it into the framework of Bayesian tracking. In this paper, distance transform is used to model the environment state, and particle filtering is employed as the paradigm for solving the Bayesian tracking problem. The adaptive dynamics model and environment prior are devised for the particle filter to fully utilize the environment information in the tracking process. Experiments on some video surveillance sequences demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach for tracking object motions in <b>structured</b> <b>environments.</b> Index Terms—Distance transform, object tracking, particle filtering, <b>structured</b> <b>environments,</b> video surveillance.

[...] The students rejected this and were not happy with the way Muche had used the schools funds. [...] This, among other smaller events, instigated a student uprising within the weaving department. [...] On March 31, 1927, despite some staff objections, Muche left the Bauhaus. [...] With his departure, Stölzl took over both as form master and master crafts person of the weaving studio. [...] She was assisted by many other key Bauhaus women, including Anni Albers, Otti Berger and Benita Otte.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the summer}} and winter months, The Kwan Um School of Zen offers a Kyol Che (meaning [...] "tight dharma")—a 21- to 90-day {{intensive}} silent meditation retreat. In Korea, both {{the summer and}} winter Kyol Che last a duration of 90 days, while the Providence Zen Center offers three weeks {{in the summer and}} 90 days in winter.

Participation in one of these intensive retreats offers individuals the chance to free themselves from intellectual attachments and develop compassion. Participants have no {{contact with the outside world}} while undergoing a retreat, and the only literature permitted are those works written by Seungsahn. They are in practice from 4:45a.m. to 9:45p.m. each day, and are not permitted to keep a diary during their stay. Talking is only permitted when absolute necessity arises and during dokusan (...) , a private meeting with a teacher. The school also offers Yong Maeng Jong Jins, which are two- to seven-day silent retreats complete with dokusan with a Ji Do Poep Sa Nim or Soen Sa Nim (Zen master).|$|E
2500|$|The eldest {{child of}} George and Elvira (née Munguia) Cisneros, Henry Gabriel Cisneros {{was born in}} San Antonio, Texas, in a {{neighborhood}} that bordered the city’s predominantly Mexican west side barrio (now the city's inner west side). Cisneros was named after his mother’s youngest brother who developed Hodgkin’s disease {{at the age of}} 14 and asked from his deathbed that his sister give his name to her son. [...] He is descended on his father’s side from early Spanish settlers in New Mexico. [...] His expatriate mother was the daughter of Romulo Munguia, a renowned Mexican dissident journalist, printer and intellectual who fled his native country in 1926 due to the Mexican Revolution and oppressive regime of Mexican dictator Porfirio Díaz. Cisneros’ father, who came from a family of small farmers and migrant workers who had settled in Colorado after losing their Spanish land grant during the Great Depression was a federal civil servant and later an Army colonel who met Elvira Munguia while he was stationed in San Antonio. As his parents survived great adversity and advanced through life with an unfailing belief in hard work, education merit leading to a better life, Cisneros along with his two brothers and two sisters were raised in a highly <b>structured</b> <b>environment</b> that put emphasis on scholarly studies and the arts.|$|E

Socially {{transmitted}} information can significantly affect {{the ways in which}} animals interact with their environments. We used network-based diffusion analysis, a novel and powerful tool for exploring information transmission, to model the rate at which sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) discovered prey patches, comparing shoals foraging in open and <b>structured</b> <b>environments.</b> We found that for groups in the open environment, individuals tended to recruit to both the prey patch and empty comparison patches at similar times, suggesting that patch discovery was not greatly affected by direct social transmission. In contrast, in <b>structured</b> <b>environments</b> we found strong evidence that information about prey patch location was socially transmitted and moreover that the pathway of information transmission followed the shoals' association network structures. Our findings highlight the importance of considering habitat structure when investigating the diffusion of information through populations and imply that association networks take on greater ecological significance in <b>structured</b> than open <b>environments.</b> Publisher PDFPeer reviewe...|$|R
