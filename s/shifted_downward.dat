50|$|Tone {{terracing}} {{is a type}} of phonetic downdrift, {{where the}} high or mid tones, but not the low tone, <b>shift</b> <b>downward</b> in pitch (downstep) after certain other tones.

50|$|Two basic {{types of}} downdrift are found.

50|$|Since {{the pitch}} of the low tone remains more-or-less {{constant}} {{at the lower end}} of the speakers vocal range, while the other tones <b>shift</b> <b>downward,</b> the difference in their pitches narrows, eventually obscuring the tones altogether.

5000|$|There is much {{speculation}} as to {{the nature}} of DiPT's aural distortion. At lower dosages, it has been reported to have an effect similar to a flanging, or a phase shift. At medium and higher dosages, the effect of DiPT is typically a radical <b>shift</b> <b>downward</b> in perceived pitch. This shift tends to be nonlinear, in that the shift downwards varies in relation to the initial pitch. This can produce bizarre sounds and render music disharmonious.|$|R
5000|$|The Root {{effect is}} a {{physiological}} phenomenon that occurs in fish hemoglobin, named after its discoverer R. W. Root. It is the phenomenon where an increased proton or carbon dioxide concentration (lower pH) lowers hemoglobin's affinity and carrying capacity for oxygen. [...] The Root effect is to be distinguished from the Bohr effect where only the affinity to oxygen is reduced. Hemoglobins showing the Root effect show a loss of cooperativity at low pH. This results in the Hb-O2 dissociation curve being <b>shifted</b> <b>downward</b> {{and not just to}} the right. At low pH, hemoglobins showing the Root effect don't become fully oxygenated even at oxygen tensions up to 20kPa. This effect allows hemoglobin in fish with swim bladders to unload oxygen into the swim bladder against a high oxygen gradient. [...] The {{effect is a}}lso noted in the choroid rete, the network of blood vessels which carries oxygen to the retina. In the absence of the Root effect, retia will result in the diffusion of some oxygen directly from the arterial blood to the venous blood, making such systems less effective for the concentration of oxygen. It has also been hypothesized that the loss of affinity is used to provide more oxygen to red muscle during acidotic stress.|$|E

Using the leading s–wave couplings of the SU(3) chiral meson– baryon Lagrangian we solve the coupled channel kaon–nucleon scattering equation selfconsistently.

The spectral {{function of the}} antikaon {{is found to be}} broadened strongly, and its mass is <b>shifted</b> <b>downward</b> significantly.
