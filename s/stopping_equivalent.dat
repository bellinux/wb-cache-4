40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} whether England's smoke-free legislation, introduced on 1 July 2007, influenced intentions {{and attempts to}} stop smoking. Design and setting: National household surveys conducted in England between January 2007 and December 2008. The sample was weighted to match census data on demographics and included 10 560 adults aged 16 or over who reported having smoked within the past year. Results: A greater percentage of smokers reported making a quit attempt in July and August 2007 (8. 6 %, n = 82) compared with July and August 2008 (5. 7 %, n = 48) (Fisher's exact= 0. 022); {{there was no significant}} difference in the number of quit attempts made at other times in 2007 compared with 2008. In the 5 months following the introduction of the legislation 19 % (n = 75) of smokers making a quit attempt reported that they had done so in response to the legislation. There were no significant differences in these quit attempts with regard to gender, social grade or cigarette consumption; there was however a significant linear trend with increasing age (chi(2) = 7. 755, df= 1, p< 0. 005). The prevalence of respondents planning to quit before the ban came into force decreased over time, while those who planned to quit when the ban came into force increased as the ban drew closer.

40|$|Recursive binary {{partitioning}} is {{a popular}} tool for regression analysis. Two fundamental problems of exhaustive search procedures usually applied to fit such models have been {{known for a long}} time: overfitting and a selection bias towards covariates with many possible splits or missing values. While pruning procedures are able to solve the overfitting problem, the variable selection bias still seriously affects the interpretability of tree-structured regression models. For some special cases unbiased procedures have been suggested, however lacking a common theoretical foundation. We propose a unified framework for recursive partitioning which embeds tree-structured regression models into a well defined theory of conditional inference procedures. Stopping criteria based on multiple test procedures are implemented and it is shown that the predictive performance of the resulting trees is as good as the performance of established exhaustive search procedures. It turns out that the partitions and therefore the models induced by both approaches are structurally different, confirming the need for an unbiased variable selection. Moreover, it is shown that the prediction accuracy of trees with early <b>stopping</b> is <b>equivalent</b> to the prediction accuracy of pruned trees with unbiased variable selection.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} on quantum algorithms. It has three main themes: (1) quantum walk based search algorithms, (2) quantum {{rejection}} sampling, and (3) the Boolean function hidden shift problem. The first two parts deal with generic techniques for constructing quantum algorithms, {{and the last}} part is on quantum algorithms for a specific algebraic problem. In {{the first part of}} this thesis we show how certain types of random walk search algorithms can be transformed into quantum algorithms that search quadratically faster. More formally, given a random walk on a graph with an unknown set of marked vertices, we construct a quantum walk that finds a marked vertex in a number of steps that is quadratically smaller than the hitting time of the random walk. The main idea of our approach is to interpolate the random walk from one that does not stop when a marked vertex is found to one that <b>stops.</b> The quantum <b>equivalent</b> of this procedure drives the initial superposition over all vertices to a superposition over marked vertices. We present an adiabatic as well as a circuit version of our algorithm, and apply it to the spatial search problem on the 2 D grid. In the second part we study a quantum version of the problem of resampling one probability distribution to another. More formally, given query access to a black box that produces a coherent superposition of unknown quantum states with given amplitudes, the problem is to prepare a coherent superposition of the same states with different specified amplitudes. Our main result is a tight characterization of the number of queries needed for this transformation. By utilizing the symmetries of the problem, we prove a lower bound using a hybrid argument and semidefinite programming. For the matching upper bound we construct a quantum algorithm that generalizes the rejection sampling method first formalized by von~Neumann in~ 1951. We describe quantum algorithms for the linear equations problem and quantum Metropolis sampling as applications of quantum rejection sampling. In the third part we consider a hidden shift problem for Boolean functions: given oracle access to f(x+s), where f(x) is a known Boolean function, determine the hidden shift s. We construct quantum algorithms for this problem using the "pretty good measurement" and quantum rejection sampling. Both algorithms use the Fourier transform and their complexity can be expressed in terms of the Fourier spectrum of f (in particular, in the second case it relates to "water-filling" of the spectrum). We also construct algorithms for variations of this problem where the task is to verify a given shift or extract only a single bit of information about it. 1 yea...|$|R
40|$|Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) {{simulations}} {{are commonly}} employed for estimating {{features of a}} target distribution, particularly for Bayesian inference. A fundamental challenge is determining when these simulations should stop. This dissertation begins by introducing relevant MCMC basics and discussing several existing techniques to terminate an MCMC simulation: the convergence diagnostics, using the effective sample size (ESS) as a stopping rule, and the fixed-width stopping rule (FWSR). This dissertation continues by proposing the relative FWSRs that terminate the simulation when {{the width of a}} confidence interval is sufficiently small relative {{to the size of the}} target parameter. Specifically, we introduce two sequential stopping rules: the relative magnitude and the relative standard deviation FWSR in the context of MCMC. In each setting, we develop conditions to ensure the simulation will terminate with probability one and the resulting confidence intervals will have the proper coverage probability. The results are applicable in such MCMC estimation settings as expectation, quantile, or simultaneous multivariate estimation. We investigate the finite sample properties through a variety of examples, and provide some recommendations to practitioners. New challenges present when the relative FWSRs are applied to terminate high-dimensional MCMC simulations. To this end, we propose using a modified relative standard deviation FWSR that terminates the simulation when the computational uncertainty is small relative to the posterior uncertainty. Further, we show this <b>stopping</b> rule is <b>equivalent</b> to <b>stopping</b> when the effective sample size is sufficiently large. Such a stopping rule has previously been shown to work well in settings with posteriors of moderate dimension. We further illustrate its utility in high-dimensional simulations while overcoming some current computational issues. As examples, we consider two complex Bayesian analyses on spatially and temporally correlated datasets. The first involves a dynamic space-time model on weather station data and the second a spatial variable selection model on fMRI brain imaging data. The results show the modified sequential stopping rule is easy to implement, provides uncertainty estimates, and performs well in high-dimensional settings. As a novel application, we propose using Bayesian model selection on linear mixed-effects models to compare multiple treatments with a control. A fully Bayesian approach is implemented to estimate the marginal posterior inclusion probability for each treatment, along with the model-averaged posterior distributions. It automatically traverses the model space and identifies subsets of predictors with nonzero fixed-effects coefficients; that is, it locates the model with the highest posterior probability. The resulting marginal inclusion probabilities provide a straightforward measure of the differences between treatments and the control. Default priors are proposed for model selection and a component-wise Gibbs sampler is developed for posterior computation. The proposed method is shown to work well using simulated data and the experimental data from a longitudinal study of mouse weight trajectories...|$|R
40|$|It was theorised {{that stop}} and start {{hysteresis}} in yield stress is inevitable {{in explaining the}} intermittent or pulsating field behaviour of debris flows. This aspect was investigated under controlled laboratory conditions {{through the application of}} viscometric techniques. Remoulded debris flow materials and some small-scale physical models of the prototype materials were subjected to viscometric tests using a 40 -cm diameter cone-and-plate rheometer with a gap angle of 30 º. These involved both stress-driven and shear rate-driven tests to establish the yield and stopping stresses, and the rheological behaviour of the flowing material, respectively. The results confirmed that yield stress is indeed higher than the corresponding stopping stress in a given flow event. This hysteresis in yield stress was detected easily in shear stress-driven tests. Extrapolation to yield and stopping stresses from the flow curves of shear rate-driven tests was not possible because of data scatter. The yielding phase was characterised by a gradual build-up of strength before a flow could occur in response to an applied stress. It signifies the gradual deformation of the material as coarse grains reorient and rearrange themselves (through rubbing and interlocking). Hence, the yield strength of the material is controlled by the frictional resistance (static) between coarse grains. The <b>stopping</b> stress is <b>equivalent</b> to the minimum shear stress as the material slows to a halt. The rapidly increasing apparent viscosity caused by decreasing shear rates outweighs the applied stress so that the material gradually slows down. The apparent viscosity includes the sliding friction of coarse grains and the viscosity of the interstitial fluid both of which have been physically active while the material is flowing. Dilatancy induced by shear minimises the interlocking of grains while the interstitial slurry reduces the contact between grains thus maintaining a low shear strength in a newly stopped material. Dilatancy is less apparent in fine-grained materials due to the more intensified particle aggregation and clustering of grains thus reducing grain-grain collisional energy. The results then showed that stop and start hysteresis in yield stress is more conspicuous in coarse-grained debris flow materials. This was also revealed in the tests of small-scale physical models of the prototype material. The magnitude of both yield and stopping stresses increases with increasing solid concentration and confining pressure (i. e. depths of the overburden). The coarse-grained debris flow materials display a dilatant plastic rheology while the fine-grained materials show a non-linear viscoplastic rheology. Some of the flow curve envelopes also exhibited other phenomena which are associated with the rheological behaviour of dense suspensions. These include granulo-viscous behaviour resulting in a wide data scatter, and torque decay with time that reflects the slow process of structure formation within the material under steady shearing. At varying shear rate, the torque decay can be due to the adjustment of particle packing structure that can be altered by a change in shear rate thus resulting in a decreasing shear stress. The viscometric tests of the physical models did not show the expected behaviour as the 'real' fluid effects seem not to completely simulate the whole debris flow phenomenon. It is more appropriate in viscometric tests of this kind to use actual material {{in order to have a}} more accurate description of the flow behaviour even in qualitative terms. While this study has confirmed the presence of stop and start hysteresis in yield stress, it also shows that the rheology of debris flows is very complex...|$|R
