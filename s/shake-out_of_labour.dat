The framework is applied to two successful cases {{that have been in}} existence for more than six years in the German speaking Internet using interviews, document analyses and participating observations for data collection.

40|$|Aims This {{paper is}} based on a review of the Australian and International {{literature}} relating to the nursing-medical division <b>of</b> <b>labour.</b> It also explores how the division <b>of</b> <b>labour</b> affects patient access to emergency care in small rural health services in Victoria, Australia. Background The paper describes the future Australian health workforce and the implications for rural Victoria. The concept <b>of</b> division <b>of</b> <b>labour</b> and how it relates to nursing and medicine is critically reviewed. Two forms <b>of</b> division <b>of</b> <b>labour</b> emerge – traditional and negotiated division <b>of</b> <b>labour.</b> Key themes are drawn from the literature that describes the impact of a traditional form <b>of</b> division <b>of</b> <b>labour</b> in a rural context. Methods This paper {{is based on}} a review of the Australian and international literature, including grey literature, on the subject of rural emergency services, professional boundaries and roles, division <b>of</b> <b>labour,</b> professional relationships and power and the Australian health workforce. Results In Australia, the contracting workforce means that traditional divisions <b>of</b> <b>labour</b> between health professionals cannot be sustained without reducing access to emergency care in rural Victoria. A traditional division <b>of</b> <b>labour</b> results in rural health services that are vulnerable to slight shifts in the medical workforce, unsafe services and recruitment and retention problems. A negotiated form <b>of</b> division <b>of</b> <b>labour</b> provides a practical alternative. Conclusion A division <b>of</b> <b>labour</b> that is negotiated between doctors and nurses and supported by a legal and clinical governance framework, is needed to support rural emergency services. The published evidence suggests that this situation currently does not exist in Victoria. Strategies are offered for creating and supporting a negotiated division <b>of</b> <b>labour...</b>|$|R

40|$|In {{contemporary}} labour studies, methodological innovations {{to grasp}} the changing social forms and struggles <b>of</b> capitalist <b>labour</b> seem to be stagnating. This article aims to address the system <b>of</b> <b>labour</b> studies behind these methodological problems. To do so, we explore the historical and theoretical development <b>of</b> <b>labour</b> studies corresponding to the development <b>of</b> the <b>labour</b> movement that is often reduced to a movement of employees at production sites. Marx’s value-definition <b>of</b> capitalist <b>labour</b> as {{an understanding of the}} most important and peculiar mediation of capitalist social relations has been forgotten in labour studies and instead the narrow surplus value-based understanding <b>of</b> <b>labour</b> became an exclusive, if not only, basis <b>of</b> contemporary <b>labour</b> studies. Although this contributed to the establishment <b>of</b> <b>labour</b> studies as a sophisticated system <b>of</b> knowledge, <b>labour</b> studies in the meantime became an ‘area study’ which deals only with production sites without critically engaging with social categories created by the capitalist fetishisation of real world. By doing so, we contend, labour studies abandoned its role as a comprehensive critique of capitalist social relations. It is argued that labour studies can critically reinvent itself by recognising the central role <b>of</b> <b>labour</b> addressed in Marx's value-definition <b>of</b> capitalist <b>labour</b> and reclaiming the struggles in and against value as subjects <b>of</b> <b>labour</b> studies...|$|R
