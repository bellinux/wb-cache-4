50|$|The price {{reference}} used by Petromatrix for the <b>shale</b> <b>band</b> {{is based}} on the CME WTI futures contract for the month of December of the next calendar year, a contract also known as the Red December contract. Due to cost reductions taken by US shale oil producers, Olivier Jakob revised the <b>shale</b> <b>band</b> in August 2016 lower by $5 per barrel to a range between $40-$60, {{on the basis of the}} WTI December contract for the next calendar year.|$|E
50|$|The {{term was}} defined on May 8, 2015 by Olivier Jakob, the {{director}} of Petromatrix, a Swiss-based consultancy company that publishes a daily note on the oil markets. Petromatrix described the <b>shale</b> <b>band</b> as a price range between $45 and $65 per barrel for West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil. Below $45 per barrel, production of US shale oil would fall sharply, and above $65 production would surge. According to Olivier Jakob, {{the price of crude}} oil would therefore remain within that range as long as the US remained the swing producer of crude oil in an environment where OPEC is producing at capacity. The concept of the <b>shale</b> <b>band</b> was subsequently verified in the market action of 2015 and the Wall Street Journal characterized the <b>shale</b> <b>band</b> as one of the key terms and phrases from 2015. The term is now widely used in by the financial press and market analysts to describe the price action of oil during over the year of 2015 and 2016.|$|E

The key difficulty in the direct routes is a notorious band of shale near the summit, which presents rotten and dangerous rock.

An alternative objective method that can semi-automatically detect marker shale bands in natural gamma logs has therefore been developed in this thesis. Gaussian Processes (GPs) were chosen for this task as they provide probabilistic classifications with uncertainty estimations. Two methods were used to build the GP libraries. In the manual method the user first constructs a library containing a selection of natural gamma signatures.

Relevé sampling method and classification procedures of the floristic-sociological (Braun-Blanquet) approach as well as numerical data analyses (numerical classification and ordination) were used to reveal syntaxonomic patterns and characterize {{the position of the}} syntaxa along major environmental gradients. Nine plant communities were recognized, three of which were classified as associations, following formal syntaxonomic and nomenclatural rules of the floristic-sociological approach. Most of the studied mire communities were dominated by low-growing clonal restios (Restionaceae), whereas some consisted of other types of graminoids. The most important species determining the structure (and function) of the mire communities on sandstones of the HHM include restios Anthochortus crinalis, Chondropetalum deustum, C. mucronatum, Elegia intermedia, E. thyrsifera, Restio subtilis, R. purpurascens, cyperoids Epischoenus villosus, Ficinia argyropa, grasses Ehrharta setacea subsp. setacea, Pentameris hirtiglumis as well as shrubs Berzelia squarrosa, Cliffortia tricuspidata, Erica intervallaris and Grubbia rosmarinifolia. Protea lacticolor and Restio perplexus dominate a rare <b>shale</b> <b>band</b> seepage community.

40|$|Newbigging Sandstone Quarry in Fife {{is one of}} {{a number}} of former {{quarries}} in the Burntisland- Aberdour district which exploited the pale-coloured Grange Sandstone from Lower Carboniferous rocks. The quarry supplied building stone from the late 19 th century, working intermittently from 1914 until closure in 1937, and again when reopened in the 1970 s to the 1990 s. The stone was primarily used locally and to supply the nearby markets in the Scottish Central Belt. Historical evidence indicates that prior to sandstone extraction, the area was dominated by largescale quarrying and mining of limestone, and substantial sandstone quarrying is likely to have begun after the arrival of the main railway line in 1890. It is probable that removal of the sandstone was directly associated with limestone exploitation, and that the quarried sandstone was effectively a by-product of limestone production. Sandstone extraction was probably viable due to the existing limestone quarry infrastructure (workforce, equipment, transportation) and the high demand for building stone in Central Scotland in the late 19 th century. The geology within Newbigging Sandstone Quarry is dominated by thick-bedded uniform sandstone with a wide joint spacing, well-suited for obtaining large blocks. However, a mudstone (<b>shale)</b> <b>band</b> is likely to be present within a few metres of the principal (north) face of the quarry, around which the sandstone bed thickness and quality is likely to decrease. The mudstone bed forms a plane sloping at a shallow angle to the north, so that expansion of the quarry in this direction is likely to encounter a considerable volume of poor quality stone. Additionally, an east-west trending fault is present approximately 100 metres north of the quarry face, which is also likely to be associated with poor quality (fractured) stone...|$|E
40|$|Limestone Pavements {{are highly}} {{significant}} {{components of the}} physiographic and ecological landscapes of the UK. As relict glacial features {{they are subject to}} destruction by natural processes but also by human intervention. This thesis identifies the most effective methods to monitor such change at a variety of temporal and spatial scales, based on the Morecambe Bay pavements at Hutton Roof and Farleton Fell. The starting point for such a study is a methodology to define the baseline on which to base change detection and the key to this is the development of a. suitably detailed scene model. This must reflect the environment at the macro-, meso- and micro- scales and also incorporate considerations of the dynamics involved in the landscape evolution. The scene model (the land Surface Classification Hierarchy (lSCH)) was developed by field measurement of the reflectance spectra of the main elements, biotic and abiotic, with measurements of the pavement surface in terms of the scale of karren development and toe texture of the limestone itself. Study of the OEM allowed a fractal dimension to be established and also the nature of ice-flow and its contribution to pavement development, with extending flow, entraining fractured limestone blocks above a plastic, impermeable <b>shale</b> <b>band,</b> being the main mechanism. At the meso scale pavements were classified according to clint form derived from intra-pavement trends in grike direction calculated by Preferred Direction Analysis. Measurements of the key karren forms, runnels, solution pits and pipes and grikes allow assessment of their contribution to the variability of the pavement surface as an element of the scene model through the identification of solution domains. ' Identification of different lithologies allowed an investigation of spatial variation across the study area, although lithological control on karren form and magnitude is weaker than variability from age of exposure as shown by statistical analysis of karren morphometry using univariate comparative methods and Link diagrams, bivariate and multivariate regression, discriminant analysis, cluster analysis, multi-dimensional scaling and star diagrams with the derived Star Index. Pavements were classified according to karren morphometry. The traditional view of pedestals asan indicator of solution rates, and hence the concentration of solution at the surface, is challenged through the investigation of water flow over the pavement surface and the consideration of the role of lichen as a protective agent as we" as the size of solution pits and grike width. It is suggested that only 10 % of solution potential is achieved at the surface with 43 % in the immediate epikarst. From this solution rate diagrams were developed, allowing the dating of exposure of pavements. These were shown to be within the period when human impact in the area was becoming significant and confirms an early anthropogenic impact on this element of the landscape. Further to this the development of grikes as emergent features was confirmed and this linked to' the concept of breakthrough, a"o~ing a model of grike development to be proposed, an important consideration in the dynamics of pavement change. At the micro scale texture analysis allowed the calculation of fractal measures which are related to variations in reflectance. The radiometric response of biotic and abiotic elements of the scene model was analysed confirming the facility of the baseline scene reflectance model of the pavement. Remotely sensed images from the Airborne Digital Camera were linked to ATM, CASI and TM images assessing the effect of scale on change detection and the evaluation of the pavement environment.

40|$|Both {{preserved}} and restored areal distributions of Proterozoic marine intracratonic, passive margin, and platform sediments show a prominent peak at ∼ 1. 9 Ga, indicating that shallow marine sediments were widespread on the continents and that sea level was high {{at this time}}. The chemical index of alteration in shales deposited at this time was high, suggesting warm climates, possibly due to enhanced CO 2 levels in the atmosphere. High sea level and warms climate may also explain an abundance of black <b>shale,</b> <b>banded</b> iron formations, and shallow marine phosphate deposits {{and an increase in}} the number of occurrences and diversity of stromatolites in general and microdigitate stromatolites at 1. 9 Ga.

Slightly low 87 Sr/ 86 Sr isotopic ratios in seawater at 1. 9 Ga reflect increased mantle input of Sr from the proposed superplume event, whereas higher ratios at 1. 85 – 1. 75 Ga may reflect increased input of continental Sr from a growing supercontinent.

40|$|A {{significant}} factor, {{where are}} the major elements e. g. Mg, Fe, Si, Al, Ca, P, Ni {{that make up the}} asteroid or comet after the impact, has been ignored since the proposal of the impact events. In a striking contrast, there are many remaining unanswered or poorly answered questions regarding the formation and nature of banded iron formation (BIF), iron stone, phosphorite, bedded manganese ore, dolomite and carbonaceous black shales. The appearance of Lake Superior type banded ion formation associated with dolomite, quartzite, and black shale, the deposition of manganese ore and the occurrence of large phosphate repository during the Plaeoproterozoic; the onset of BIF with phosphate deposition and sedimentary manganese deposits and cap dolomite during the Neoproterozoic; the penecontemporary formation of oolitic iron stone taking place of the BIF, bedded manganese deposit, phosphorite, dolomite, and black shale during the Phanerozoic, which suggest a genetic link among them from the perspective of chemical elements. Actually, during hypervelocity impact cratering events, {{the main part of the}} asteroid or comet and target material are vaporizing, which forms a mushroom cloud of vapor in the atmosphere. &#x 3000;The previous study shows that the calcite, magnetite, clay minerals and organic compounds condense from a solar gas at 10 &#x 2212; 4 atm with temperature less than 400 K, which provides an analog for the generation of the chemical sedimentary ore deposits. This also supported by table isotopes fractionation at small sacle (grain size, cm scale), all stable isotopes fractionation e. g. (Cr, Fe, S, Si, O,C) and mass-independent fractionation of sulphur isotopes following the rule of isotope fractionation during impacts: the earlier the condensed material, the more enriched in lighter isotopes. Thus, the impact of the asteroid or comet provides not only the elements source of chemical sedimentary ore deposits and the mechanism for their formation. The enrichment in iridium in BIFs and their associated impact spherule units are the other evidence to demonstrate that BIFs are the products of impacts. Impacts produce black <b>shale,</b> <b>banded</b> iron formation, limestone and dolomite.

40|$|Lead isotope {{analyses}} {{have been}} undertaken {{as part of}} a program to evaluate the potential of geochemical methods for use in exploration in the Tennant Creek goldfield. Earlier exploration in this area was based on magnetic geophysical methods. Economic Au, Cu and Bi mineralization usually occurs in magnetic magnetite-chlorite lenses or pods (“ironstones”) which may be only 30 m across. Several hundred ironstones are found in the Tennant Creek field, of which only nine have been significant producers. Despite complications arising from the low Pb and relatively elevated U contents of the ore, determination of Pb isotope ratios in drill core material allows discrimination between economic magnetic ironstones and “barren” ironstones of similar mineralogy. A target signature for the Th-derived Pb isotope ratio, 208 Pb/ 204 Pb, is specific for lode mineralization, although it does not discriminate between Au-rich and Cu-rich lodes. The target signature is commonly found not only in the central Au-rich magnetite-chlorite zone, but also in the outer “barren” talc-magnetite and carbonate zones, offering up to a two-fold increase {{in the size of the}} target. The Pb isotope signature is retained in hematite-rich surface ironstones (termed “gossans” here) and it appears possible, at this stage of the project, to discriminate between gossans derived from mineralized magnetite lodes and “barren” magnetite lodes. A discrimination between weakly-mineralized (either Cu or Au) and economic deposits is equivocal at this stage. The difference between target and sample 208 Pb/ 204 Pb ratios (Δ 208 / 204) ranges from − 3 to + 2 % for the economic lodes, through weakly mineralized and “barren” magnetic ironstones (commonly in the range − 20 to − 40 %) to the country rock magnetite shales (about − 40 to − 70 %). These data are consistent with a significant Pb component in the “barren” ironstones being derived locally from the magnetite shales. Hematite shales commonly associated with economic lodes may have acted as limited channelways for the ore fluids as the target signature is discernible for up to 50 m along the hematite <b>shale</b> <b>bands</b> from the outer chlorite zones of the economic lodes. Further trace element and isotopic work is necessary to elucidate the genesis of the mineralization...|$|R
40|$|The {{structural}} lineament {{mapping of}} southern India along withgeological, geochronological datasets help in redefining the Precambrian crustal blocks. The newly proposed Kumta and Mercara suture zones welding Archean crustal blocks in western peninsular India offer critical {{insights into the}} crustal evolution of Gondwana. The Kumta suturemainly consists of schistose rocks including quartz-phengite, garnet-biotite, chlorite, fuchsite and marble, whereas the Mercara suture contains mylonitic quartzo-feldspathic gneiss, garnet-kyanite-sillimanite gneiss, calc-silicate granulite and metagabbro. Metamorphic pressure-temperature estimations (Kumta suture: 11 - 18 kbar at 790 - 550 oC; Mercara suture: 13 kbar at 825 oC) suggest that, the sediments have undergone subduction to greater depths. The K-Ar age of biotite, phengite and U-Pb dating of zircon yields consistent metamorphic age of 1100 - 1400 Ma. In situ zircon 176 Lu/ 177 Hf isotope analysis shows wide range of εHf (t) values indicating the protolith sediments were derived from Paleo-Neoarchean juvenile crust that mixed with recycled older crust. The Bondla ultramafic-gabbro complex, northwest of the Kumta suture contains basalt, dolerite, gabbro, serpentinite, chromitite, peridotite and chromian spinel chemistry suggests evolution in a supra-subduction zone arc tectonic setting. The Sirsi shelf towards east of the Kumta suture, contains weakly deformed sedimentary rocks (limestone, <b>shale,</b> <b>banded</b> iron formations, greywacke, sandstone and quartzite) unconformable on relatively high-grade ca. 2571 Ma gneisses of the Dharwar craton. The Karwar block to the west is composed of weakly metamorphosedca. 3200 Ma tonalite-trondhjemite-granodiorite (TTG) with enclaves of amphibolite. In situ zircon 176 Lu/ 177 Hf isotope analysis and whole-rock 143 Nd/ 144 Nd isotopic analysis of TTGs show positive εHf and εNd values indicating ca. 3200 Ma juvenile crust. The Coorg block consists of ca. 3200 Ma charnockite, mafic granulites, hornblende-biotite gneiss, garnet-hornblende gabbro and anorthosite. In situ zircon 176 Lu/ 177 Hf isotope analysis indicates source as mixture of juvenile crust and older recycled crustal materials. Synthesis of the above results with published data suggests that Kumta and Mercara suture zones incorporate Paleoarchean to Mesoproterozoic sedimentssubjected to high-pressure metamorphism in the late Mesoproterozoic. Metamorphic P-T estimations of mafic granulite and U-Pb zircon geochronology of pelitic gneisses from Betsimisaraka suture zone, Madagascar suggests the rocks were underwent metamorphism at c. 24 kbar and c. 780 °C during Mesoproterozoic suturing of Antongil-Masora blocks with the Antananarivo block. From the integration of above results with the new geophysical results and published data Mesoproterozoic Kumta-Mercara suture is interpreted as eastern extension of the Mesoproterozoic Betsimisaraka suture of Madagascar into western India...|$|R

Electron-probe {{analyses of the}} following minerals are given: ilmenite, titanian hematite, rutile, magnetite, sapphirine, hyperstheue, brown and green biotite, garnet, and cordierite. Field and experimental data suggest the following para-genesis: deposition of ferruginous <b>shales</b> with siliceous <b>bands,</b> followed by burial and regional metamorphism under granulite facies conditions, and finally rapid unloading associated with re-foliation and shearing and crystallization f sapphirine and cordierite. TIlE Labwor Hills of northern Uganda consist of Precambrian metamorphic rocks of amphibolite and granulite facies. In I 963 - 4 the Uganda Geological Survey recognized the presence of sapphirine-bearing granulites that contain a wide mineralogical range of iron magnesium alumino-silicates. Of particular additional interest is the structural setting of these intriguing assemblages. The sapphirine-bearing rocks are restricted to a zone of NW-trending refoliation, 2 " 5 miles wide and 8 miles long, that forms a conspicuous photogeological feature truncating a zone of easterly-trending foliation (fig. I). The relationship of these two trends of foliation is particularly well displaye...|$|R
40|$|The Bureau of Mines designed, fabricated, and {{is using}} an in-seam tester (1 ST) for in situ {{determination}} of coal cutting forces. This re-port describes {{the results of}} field tests conducted in the Pocahontas No. 3 and Upper Freeport seams to obtain peak and mean cutting forces during coal cutting with several bit geometries, including radial and point attack bits currently used on drum-type machines. Comparisons were also made between new and worn bits, and using data obtained from a Bureau-modified chisel bit. The test results show that longwall plough cutting (horizontal cuts) in bony coal <b>bands</b> (<b>shale)</b> requires > 3 times the cutting force for the same cuts in a vertical direction. When no bony coal is present, the cutting forces required to make horizontal and vertical cuts are equal. Worn bits require 4 to 5 times more cutting and normal force than new or undamaged bits. Normal force increased drastically for the worn chisel bit. Peak force encountered in making independent cuts {{was found to be}} ~ 3 times higher than that required to make interactive cuts using a spacing-to-depth-of-cut ratio of 2. Both rake and clearance angles were found to {{have a significant effect on}} normal and cutting force...|$|R
50|$|In {{the extreme}} {{northwest}} of the county between Drumlanrig Castle and Dalveen Pass {{in the south and}} the Spango and Kello Waters on the north, there is a broad development of Arenig, Liandeilo and Caradoc strata, represented by Radiolarian cherts, black shales, grits, conglomerates, greywackes and shales which rise from underneath the central Tarannon belt and are repeated by innumerable folds, in the cores of the arches of Arenig cherts there are diabase lavas, tuffs and agglomerates which are typically represented on Bail Hill east of Kirkconnel. Along the southern margin of the Tarannon belt, the Wenlock and Ludlow rocks follow in normal order, the boundary between the two being defined by a line extending from the head of the Ewes Water in Eskdale, southwest by Lockerbie to Mouswald. These consist of greywackes, flags and <b>shales</b> with <b>bands</b> of dark graptolite shales, the finer sediments being often well ground. They are likewise repeated by inverted folds, the axial planes being usually inclined to the southeast. The Silurian tableland in the {{northwest of the}} county is pierced by intrusive igneous rocks in the form of dikes and bosses, which are regarded as of Lower Old Red Sandstone age. Of these, the granite mass of Spango Water, northeast of Kirkconnel, is an excellent example. Along the northwest margin of the county, {{on the north side of}} the fault bounding the Silurian tableland, the Lower Old Red Sandstone occurs, where it consists of sandstones and conglomerates associated with contemporaneous volcanic rocks. The Upper Old Red Sandstone forms a narrow strip on the south side of the Silurian tableland, resting uncomfortably on the Silurian rocks and passing upwards into the Carboniferous formation. It stretches from the county boundary east of the Ewes Water, southwest by Langholm to Birrenswark. Along this line these Upper Red sandstones and shales are overlaid by a thin zone of volcanic rocks which point to contemporaneous volcanic action in this region at the beginning of the Carboniferous period. Some of the vents from which these igneous materials may have been discharged are found along the watershed between Liddesdale and Teviotdale in Roxburghshire.|$|R
30|$|The Gwalior basin {{is located}} on the northwestern fringe of the Bundelkhand massif and is intracratonic in nature, and the {{complete}} lithological unit lies on the Bundelkhand granite which comprises basal arenaceous Par formation which is overlaid by a sequence of volcanic sediments of the Morar formation. The Gwalior group (which dips in due north) shows continuity and similarity with the Bijawar group (Singh et al. 2011). The basic structure is quite similar as the base is made up of quartzite; the shallow water conditions are characteristics of ferruginous shale with chert and jasper; and transgression follows after the rapid development of the basin formation. In few parts of the basin, the Gwalior group shows fine or coarse doleritic sills and dykes. The hard rocks of the region comprise sandstone and shale as they belong to the Archaean group to Precambrian group; however, the doleritic dykes are recent alluvium deposits where granite is the base rock of the study area. By the regional geological map of the area which has been prepared based on the satellite images and geological maps, the Gwalior basin shows much of the Morar formation shale with lower region of Par formation of sandstone. Surrounding the region is the Kaimur group sandstone and Bundelkhand granite. The chief groundwater deposits in the region are formed by the weathered shale zones, alluvial deposits and sandstone forming a coarse- or medium-grained unconsolidated aggregation. The  thickness of aquifer formation  increases to the northern portion of the watershed with  three major water bearing formation at 100 m depth. The fracturing, openness, size of the fracture and the interconnection nature between the fractures dominate the water yielding capacity of the rocks. The Swarnrekha watershed is mostly covered with alluvium which varies in thickness and constitute  the major aquife system of the area. The intracratonic Gwalior basin is present on the northwestern fringes of granitic Bundelkhand massif and Gwalior litho-units group rest over Bundelkhand granite. These comprise basal arenaceous Par formation overlain by volcano-sedimentary sequences of Morar formation consisting of ferruginous <b>shale</b> with <b>bands</b> of chert, jasper and limestone. The predominant rocks comprise sandstone, shale, quartzite, doleritic dykes and alluvium. The thickness of this weathered zone is generally greater in the northern portion. The Gwalior Group of rocks overlies the Vindhyans group and is the youngest rock in the region.|$|R
