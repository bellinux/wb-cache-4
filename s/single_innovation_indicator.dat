40|$|Most {{empirical}} studies on innovative activity {{are based on}} a single (or a very small number of) indicator(s), a procedure not appropriate to the complexity of the innovation process. In this study, using factor analysis we develop at the firm level a composite innovation measure which contains the information of a whole set of input-, output- and market-oriented indicators. This aggregate indicator computed separately for product and process innovations yields statistically satisfactory and economically plausible results. Canonical correlations show that this measure is superior to every <b>single</b> <b>innovation</b> <b>indicator.</b> ...|$|E
30|$|Questions {{which have}} become {{increasingly}} important during the last decades are measurement, indicators and statistics of innovation activity on the macro level, {{but there is no}} <b>single</b> truth about <b>innovation</b> <b>indicators</b> and there is room for various different and sometimes even conflicting ways of understanding and measuring of innovation (Nieminen and Lehtoranta, 2015). In general, the innovation measurements are equally important both on the level of an organization and the state or region policy planning. The need for the distinction between different process effectiveness measurements is emphasized (e.g. Pennings and Goodman, 1976; Ostroff and Schmit, 1993; Marley, 2000; Flay et al., 2005). However, a brief survey of the articles with “know-how transfer” in the title reveals that existing body of scientific knowledge about effectiveness measurements is relatively pure. There are articles that discuss effectiveness issues (e.g. Teece, 1981; Jensen and Szulanski, 2007), but do not provide equations to measure the performance of the transfer process.|$|R
40|$|Innovation is {{becoming}} more and more important as a driver of economic growth. In developed countries, a diverse set of <b>innovation</b> <b>indicators</b> has been developed to monitor innovation performance and the impact of innovation policies. Developing countries have been late to jump on this bandwagon and are now faced with a set of well-established <b>innovation</b> <b>indicators</b> that might not be that well suited to measure innovation in their economies. Existing <b>innovation</b> <b>indicators</b> can be broadly classified into three different types: Science & Technology (S&T) <b>indicators,</b> <b>Innovation</b> survey <b>indicators,</b> and Composite <b>innovation</b> <b>indicators</b> combining different indicators, including S&T and Innovation survey data, into one indicator. All of these have their own particular strengths and weaknesses, and they score above or below average on a wide range of attributes considered to be favourable, if not downright necessary, for <b>innovation</b> <b>indicators.</b> This paper argues that, for <b>innovation</b> <b>indicators,</b> and for <b>innovation</b> survey <b>indicators</b> in particular, data collection has to be customised to the different socio-economic structures of developing countries. For this, the definition of innovation has to become more inclusive by recognising the multitude of innovation actors and processes in developing countries. Developing countries also need to build competence regarding <b>innovation</b> <b>indicators,</b> not only within their statistical systems but also among their policy makers...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the social {{impacts of the}} development of science, technology and <b>innovation</b> <b>indicators.</b> The approach deals separately with the development process and {{with the use of the}} indicators that result.

Science and technology indicators are considered separately from <b>innovation</b> <b>indicators,</b> and the importance of language based on codified and tacit knowledge is emphasized. The knowledge is codified in manuals, and the tacit knowledge is held in overlapping communities of practice that develop the manuals, gather the data, produce the indicators and use them.

The empirical analysis of firm level innovative activities for a sample of 451 Italian manufacturing companies observed during the years 1998 - 2006 confirms the presence of significant persistence in innovation. However, the levels of persistence as captured by the inter-temporal elasticity between the <b>innovation</b> <b>indicators</b> show significant variations according to the typology of innovation considered. The higher level of persistence is found for R&D investments, witnessing the actual presence of significant entry and exit barriers. Furthermore, we obtain a relatively higher persistence for product innovation than process innovation. ...|$|R
30|$|The paper {{examines}} the long-run relationship between innovation and per capita {{economic growth in}} the 19 European countries over the period 1989 – 2014. This study uses six different indicators of innovation: patents-residents, patents-non-residents, research and development expenditure, researchers in research and development activities, high-technology exports, and scientific and technical journal articles to examine this long-run relationship with per capita economic growth. Using cointegration technique, the study finds evidence of long-run relationship between innovation and per capita economic growth in most of the cases, typically with reference to the use of a particular <b>innovation</b> <b>indicator.</b> Using Granger causality test, the study finds the presence of both unidirectional and bidirectional causality between innovation and per capita economic growth. These results vary from country to country, depending upon the types of <b>innovation</b> <b>indicators</b> that we use in the empirical investigation process. Most importantly, the study finds that all these <b>innovation</b> <b>indicators</b> are considerably linked with per capita economic growth. This particular linkage is either supply-leading or demand-following in some occasions, while it is the occurrence of both in some other occasions. The policy implication {{of this study is that}} countries should recognize the differences in innovation and per capita economic growth in order to maintain sustainable development in these countries.|$|R

40|$|In both {{academic}} literature and political discussions {{the concept of}} innovation is recognized as an essential ingredient in economic development and competitiveness for firms, regions, and nations. Innovation also ranks {{at the top of}} policy agendas in the field of regional policy. Therefore, the attractiveness of an appropriate innovation index for ranking regions and further developing them along a more or less objective measurement scale is evident. However, whether such rankings help convey a better understanding of innovation and its drivers, or whether they are merely a special type of 'beauty contest' with little substance is the focus of our analyses. To deny the latter, the <b>innovation</b> output <b>indicators</b> used for the composite index have to be appropriate representatives of the underlying innovation concept and each indicator has to be driven by the same impact factors. If this is not the case, interpretation of the index inevitably gives rise to partly inappropriate policy recommendations. In order to demonstrate this claim we elaborate a set of <b>innovation</b> <b>indicators</b> at the regional level based on the theoretical concept of the OECD document 'The Measurement of Scientific and Technological Activities, Proposed Guidelines for Collecting and Interpreting Technological Innovation Data' known as the 'Oslo Manual' (OECD, 2005) and their empirical implementation in the Community Innovation Survey. Additionally, innovation drivers well established in the literature are collected to estimate their impact on each <b>innovation</b> <b>indicator</b> {{as well as on the}} composite index derived from the <b>innovation</b> <b>indicators.</b> The question whether 2 innovation should be measured as a multidimensional concept and investigated using various indicators or whether simplifying innovation to a one-dimensional concept is appropriate is clearly answered in favour of the multidimensional approach. Surprisingly, this is not due to the multidimensionality of the indicators themselves (all statistical measures indicate that the considered variables are sufficiently represented by one component), but to our first evidence that the <b>innovation</b> output <b>indicators</b> are driven by various impact factors and can therefore be influenced by various political strategies. According to these findings any type of innovation ranking is of very limited use...|$|R
