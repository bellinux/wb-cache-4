30|$|<b>Stray</b> <b>current</b> {{refers to}} the current that flows {{elsewhere}} rather than along the intended current path. It is an important cause of corrosion and leakage of underground metal pipelines (Li et al. 2010; Guo et al. 2015). <b>Stray</b> <b>current</b> corrosion is essentially electrochemical corrosion (Bertolini et al. 2007). Because of the high electrical conductivity of buried steel pipelines, potential differences with the less conductive environment are formed when <b>stray</b> <b>current</b> flows through the pipe (Brichau et al. 1996) effectively creating a corrosion cell. The corrosion caused by <b>stray</b> <b>current</b> is more serious than soil corrosion under normal conditions (the potential difference of soil corrosion is only about 0.35  V without <b>stray</b> <b>current,</b> but the pipe-to-soil potential can {{be as high as}} 8 – 9  V when a <b>stray</b> <b>current</b> exists) (Brichau et al. 1996). The <b>stray</b> <b>current</b> has a great effect on corrosion, and so affects the service life and safe use of buried pipelines (Ding et al. 2010). Therefore, it is important to better understand <b>stray</b> <b>current</b> corrosion.|$|R

40|$|In this work, the {{coupling}} effect {{of stress and}} <b>stray</b> <b>current</b> on corrosion of X 80 pipeline steel was investigated in soil-simulating solution by open circuit potential (OCP) and corrosion potential test, potentiodynamic polarization measurement and surface characterisation technique. A mathematical relationship between corrosion rate and yield strength, direct <b>current</b> (DC) <b>stray</b> <b>current</b> density was obtained through multiple linear regression. The results indicate that, the corrosion potential of X 80 pipeline steel with and without superimposed DC <b>stray</b> <b>current</b> all shift negatively, and the corrosion rate increases with the enhancement of tensile stress in solution. Moreover, the above laws become increasingly obvious with DC <b>stray</b> <b>current</b> density form 0. 5 to 3. 5 mA/cm 2. Comparing with the stress, the effect of <b>stray</b> <b>current</b> on corrosion rate of X 80 pipeline steel is more significant in elastic deformation. Mutation in corrosion potential and corrosion rate appeared when the strain reaches plastic deformation. This study provides important recommendations for pipeline safety design and operation, where the corrosion enhancement due to {{the coupling}} effect of stress and <b>stray</b> <b>current</b> should be considered...|$|R

The upper and lower limits prevent fire from either <b>stray</b> <b>currents</b> or static electricity. The direct electrical firing eliminates the mechanical delays associated with a striker, reducing lock time, and allowing for easier adjustment of the rifle trigger.|$|E
50|$|Differential TTL {{is used in}} {{preference}} to single-ended TTL for long-distance signaling. In a long cable, stray electromagnetic fields in the environment, or <b>stray</b> <b>currents</b> in the system ground, can induce unwanted voltages that cause errors at the receiver. With a differential pair of wires, roughly the same unwanted voltage is induced in each wire. The receiver subtracts the voltages on the two wires, so that the unwanted voltage disappears, and only the voltage created by the driver remains.|$|E
40|$|<b>Stray</b> <b>current</b> {{arising from}} direct current {{electrified}} traction systems and then circulat-ing in reinforced concrete structures may initiate corrosion or even accelerate existing corrosion processes on embedded reinforcement. Therefore, stray-current induced corrosion of nearby reinforced concrete structures deserves more attention {{in view of}} maintaining structures‘ integrity. The current state-of-the-art generally reports on sim-ulating <b>stray</b> <b>current</b> corrosion through anodic polarization, rather than <b>stray</b> <b>current</b> effects on the corrosion behaviour of steel in reinforced concrete. This work presents the comparison of effects of <b>stray</b> <b>current</b> (through the application of external DC electrical field) and direct anodic polarization on the corrosion behaviour of steel, embedded in mortar specimens. The level of <b>stray</b> <b>current</b> and anodic polarization were set at 0. 3 mA/cm 2 and evolution of electrochemical response over time was monitored via OCP (Open Circuit Potential) and EIS (Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy). The steel response was recorded as a result from “under polarization” conditions in both anodic and <b>stray</b> <b>current</b> regimes and compared to “rest” (no polar-ization) conditions.

After that, we developed a safety early warning model of coal mining workface <b>stray</b> <b>current</b> danger grade with ANFIS as its core, choosing data sets measured online to do the training and early warning of safe early warning model.

5000|$|There is {{no visible}} warning to {{electrified}} water. [...] Swimmers {{will be able}} to feel the electricity if the current is substantial. If the swimmers notice any unusual tingling feeling or symptoms of electrical shock, it is highly likely that <b>stray</b> <b>currents</b> exist and everyone needs to get out. Swimmers should always swim away from the suspected current source. In most cases this means swimming away from docks and boats and toward another safer portion of the shoreline.|$|E

To reduce the chance of <b>stray</b> <b>currents</b> causing a wrong side failure the modulation frequency is calculated by dividing the base frequency by 128. Different rates of modulation can be detected by equipment on the trains and used for ATC, {{so long as the}} transmitter end (Tx) is {{at the front of the}} train.|$|E
50|$|Electric shock {{drowning}} is a {{cause of}} death that occurs when swimmers are exposed to electric currents in the water. In some cases the shock itself is fatal, while in others it incapacitates the swimmer causing them to drown. The main cause of electric shock drownings is faulty wiring on boats or docks that causes electric current to leak into the water. Electric shock drownings occur almost exclusively in freshwater. When <b>stray</b> <b>currents</b> exist in saltwater, the water itself diverts most of the current around the body due to the water's low resistance.|$|E

By changing the values of carry-current, ansys was used toanalyzeunder different geological conditions. Simulations show that the potential attenuation is nonlinear from the sub-way tunnel to the surrounding underground. The potential of the same location of surrounding media is different with dif-ferent carry-current. The amount of leakage <b>stray</b> <b>current</b> of rectangular tunnel is less than Shield tunnel under same geo-logical condition and same carry-current.

30|$|There {{are three}} types of <b>stray</b> currents: {{direction}} <b>current</b> (DC), alternating current (AC), and natural telluric current in the earth. Among these, the DC <b>stray</b> <b>current</b> causes most damage to a buried pipeline (Gao et al. 2010). The DC <b>stray</b> <b>current</b> mainly originates from DC electrified railways, DC electrolytic equipment grounding electrodes, and the anode bed of cathodic protection systems (Wang et al. 2010).|$|R

On {{basis of}} {{analyzing}} {{the principles and}} structure of adaptive neural fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), this thesis used subtractive clustering algorithm to get fuzzy inference rule numbers and confirm the network structure. In addition, the thesis built ANFIS model adapted to coal mining workface <b>stray</b> <b>current</b> security prediction. The model can do workface <b>stray</b> <b>current</b> security prediction by the easy measured parameters of non-production field. If the <b>stray</b> <b>current</b> exceeds standard, the system will alarm on time.

50|$|Polyethylene {{sleeving}} {{does have}} limitations. In European practice, {{its use in}} the absence of additional zinc and epoxy protective coatings is discouraged where natural soil resistivity is below 750 ohm/cm. Where resistivity is below 1500 ohm/cm and where the pipe is installed at or below the water table, where there are additional artificial soil contaminants and particularly <b>stray</b> <b>currents</b> again it is recommended for use in addition to zinc and epoxy coating. Because of the vulnerability of polyethylene to UV degradation, sleeving, or sleeved pipe should not be stored in sunlight, although carbon pigments included in the sleeving can provide some limited protection.|$|E

5000|$|The primary {{method of}} rescue {{is to get}} the swimmer away from the current source by any means possible, EXCEPT by sending out rescue swimmers. This means Row and Throw, but do not Go. If <b>stray</b> <b>currents</b> are {{suspected}} a rescue by another swimmer should never be attempted. For cases where swimmers can feel mild tingling, getting flotation devices out to them can aid them to swim away from the current source under their own power. In cases where the current source is obvious, it may be possible for bystanders on foot to disconnect it. Dockside power hookups often have integrated or nearby breakers by which the source can be de-energized.|$|E

5000|$|Silicon on {{sapphire}} (SOS) is a hetero-epitaxial {{process for}} integrated circuit manufacturing {{that consists of}} a thin layer (typically thinner than 0.6 µm) of silicon grown on a sapphire (Al2O3) wafer. SOS {{is part of the}} Silicon on Insulator (SOI) family of CMOS technologies. Typically, high-purity artificially grown sapphire crystals are used. The silicon is usually deposited by the decomposition of silane gas (SiH4) on heated sapphire substrates. The advantage of sapphire is that it is an excellent electrical insulator, preventing <b>stray</b> <b>currents</b> caused by radiation from spreading to nearby circuit elements. SOS faced early challenges in commercial manufacturing because of difficulties in fabricating the very small transistors used in modern high-density applications. This is because the SOS process results in the formation of dislocations, twinning and stacking faults from crystal lattice disparities between the sapphire and silicon. Additionally, there is some aluminum, a p-type dopant, contamination from the substrate in the silicon closest to the interface.|$|E
5000|$|The troller design {{frequently}} {{fell off}} the wires, and was soon replaced by other more reliable devices, the trolley pole and notably the bow collector. Both were fitted {{to the top of}} the car and were spring-loaded in order to keep, respectively, a small trolley wheel or grooved lubricated [...] "skate" [...] mounted at the top of the pole or a steel rod forming the top of the bow firmly in contact with the underside of the overhead wire. The terms trolley pole and trolley wheel both derive from the troller. Trams using trolley-pole current collection are normally powered through a single pole, with return current earthed through the steel wheels and rails, though some systems (e.g. parts of the London system), used twin overhead wires and poles to avoid the effects of <b>stray</b> <b>currents</b> flowing through the earth. Modern trams often have an overhead pantograph mechanical linkage to connect to power, abandoning the trolley pole altogether.|$|E
5000|$|The {{manufacturer}} of the system, Intuitive Surgical, {{has been criticized}} for short-cutting FDA approval by a process known as [...] "premarket notification," [...] which claims the product is similar to already-approved products. Intuitive has also been accused of providing inadequate training, and encouraging health care providers {{to reduce the number of}} supervised procedures required before a doctor is allowed to use the system without supervision. There have also been claims of patient injuries caused by stray electrical currents released from inappropriate parts of the surgical tips used by the system. Intuitive counters that the same type of <b>stray</b> <b>currents</b> can occur in non-robotic laparoscopic procedures. A study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that side effects and blood loss in robotically-performed hysterectomies are no better than those performed by traditional surgery, despite the significantly greater cost of the system. As of 2013, the FDA is investigating problems with the da Vinci robot, including deaths during surgeries that used the device; a number of related lawsuits are also underway.|$|E
40|$|DC {{traction}} power system with running rails as reflux conductor {{has been adopted}} in Guangzhou Metro Line 8. During {{the operation of the}} Guangzhou Metro Line, a high rail potential has been observed, and the leakage of <b>stray</b> <b>current</b> increases significantly. Because of the electrical connectivity of the catenary, over zone feeding of traction current may exist when multiple trains run in multiple traction substations. Guangzhou Metro Line 8 suspects that over zone feeding of traction current is the major cause of the high rail potential. In this paper, a unified chain model of DC {{traction power}} system is proposed to simulate the distribution of rail potential and <b>stray</b> <b>current.</b> Field tests and simulations have been carried out to study whether over zone feeding has an impact on rail potential and <b>stray</b> <b>current.</b> Results show that over zone feeding widely exists in DC traction power system and that the rail potential and <b>stray</b> <b>current</b> can be reduced effectively by preventing the over zone feeding of traction current...|$|R

The effects DC <b>stray</b> <b>current</b> on the properties of concrete were determined by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and rapid chloride penetration (RCP) tests. The obtained results showed that DC <b>stray</b> <b>current</b> will increase permeability of the concrete. The critical role of w/c ratio and SF additive on the degradation effects created by DC <b>stray</b> <b>current</b> was investigated.

40|$|Case {{study of}} {{corrosion}} failure of urban {{water supply system}} caused by {{the harmful effects of}} <b>stray</b> <b>currents</b> was presented. The failure occurred at a site distant from the sources of these currents namely the tramway and railway traction systems. Diagnosis revealed the <b>stray</b> <b>currents</b> flow to pipeline over a remote distance of 800 / 1000  m from the point of failure. At the point of failure <b>stray</b> <b>currents</b> flowed from the pipeline to the ground through external insulation defects, causing the process of electrolytic corrosion of the metal. Long distance between the affected section of the pipeline and the sources of <b>stray</b> <b>currents</b> excludes the typical protection against <b>stray</b> <b>currents</b> in the form of electrical polarized drainage.

40|$|The size of {{the damaged}} area of the coating and its {{position}} on the pipeline impacted the cathodic protection potential, {{and there was a}} damaged area of the greatest impact value. When damaged area was 300 [*]mm 2, the IR drop was the largest, and this situation could easily lead to inadequate protection; when the parallel spacing between pipeline and interference source was unchanged, the measured value curves of cathodic protection potential presented “U” shaped trend with the increasing <b>stray</b> <b>current</b> interference intensity. Under certain parallel spacing between pipeline and interference source, high alternating <b>stray</b> <b>current</b> intensity would cause serious negative offsets, so that the overprotection of the pipeline occurred, and make the coating crack; there was a parallel threshold length. When less than the threshold, the pipe-ground potential increases rapidly with the parallel length increasing. In order to judge whether a pipeline was interference by AC <b>stray</b> <b>current</b> and the risk of <b>stray</b> <b>current</b> corrosion, we should make a comprehensive analysis of the cathodic protection energizing potential, the switch-off potential, AC pipe-soil potential, IR drops, and so on...|$|R
