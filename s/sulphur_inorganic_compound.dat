40|$|Abstract Background Coryne{{bacterium}} glutamicum is a high-GC Gram-positive soil bacterium {{of great}} biotechnological {{importance for the}} production of amino acids. To facilitate the rational design of sulphur amino acid-producing strains, the pathway for assimilatory sulphate reduction providing the necessary reduced sulfur moieties has to be known. Although this pathway has been well studied in Gram-negative bacteria like Escherichia coli and low-GC Gram-positives like Bacillus subtilis, little is known for the Actinomycetales and other high-GC Gram-positive bacteria. Results The genome sequence of C. glutamicum was searched for genes involved in the assimilatory reduction of <b>inorganic</b> <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds.</b> A cluster of eight candidate genes could be identified by combining sequence similarity searches with a subsequent synteny analysis between C. glutamicum and the closely related C. efficiens. Using mutational analysis, seven of the eight candidate genes, namely cysZ, cysY, cysN, cysD, cysH, cysX, and cysI, were demonstrated {{to be involved in the}} reduction of <b>inorganic</b> <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds.</b> For three of the up to now unknown genes possible functions could be proposed: CysZ is likely to be the sulphate permease, while CysX and CysY are possibly involved in electron transfer and cofactor biosynthesis, respectively. Finally, the candidate gene designated fpr 2 influences sulphur utilisation only weakly and might be involved in electron transport for the reduction of sulphite. Real-time RT-PCR experiments revealed that cysIXHDNYZ form an operon and that transcription of the extended cluster fpr 2 cysIXHDNYZ is strongly influenced by the availability of <b>inorganic</b> <b>sulphur,</b> as well as L-cysteine. Mapping of the fpr 2 and cysIXHDNYZ promoters using RACE-PCR indicated that both promoters overlap with binding-sites of the transcriptional repressor McbR, suggesting an involvement of McbR in the observed regulation. Comparative genomics revealed that large parts of the extended cluster are conserved in 11 of 17 completely sequenced members of the Actinomycetales. Conclusion The set of C. glutamicum genes involved in assimilatory sulphate reduction was identified and four novel genes involved in this pathway were found. The high degree of conservation of this cluster among the Actinomycetales supports the hypothesis that a different metabolic pathway for the reduction of <b>inorganic</b> <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds</b> than that known from the well-studied model organisms E. coli and B. subtilis is used by members of this order, providing the basis for further biochemical studies. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{chemical}} instability and reactivity of certain biologically important sulphur derivatives are recalled and their {{relevance to the}} study of sulphur auxotrophs is pointed out. In {{the early stages of the}} biological utilization of <b>inorganic</b> <b>sulphur</b> sources the <b>compounds</b> involved are often relatively unstable. In the conditions used for the examination of their specific biological effects the compounds themselves, even when initially pure, may undergo chemical change by reaction with other com-pounds in growth media or the oxygen of the air, for example. Many <b>inorganic</b> <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds,</b> particularly those which involve intermediate oxidation states of the sulphur, are unstable (see for example, Pollard & Jones, 1958) and exchange reactions readily occur between these compounds and organic-SH or-SS-compounds. Such hazards are familiar to many workers in the field of microbial sulphur meta-bolism (e. g. Vishniac & Santer, 1957; Szczepkowski, 1958). Deductions about meta-bolic pathways which involve such sulphur compounds and are based on growth and metabolic experiments, particularly those of long duration, should be made circum...|$|R
40|$|Thiobacillus spp. are {{extensively}} used worldwide {{for removal}} of both organic and <b>inorganic</b> <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds</b> in wastewater; however, a little used in Thailand. Southern Thailand has numerous rubber factories producing wastewater containing high amounts of those compounds. Therefore, in this study, 4 Thiobacillus sp. were isolated from wastewaters {{of domestic and}} rubber factories. Each isolate grew both aerobically and anaerobically as both a chemolithotroph and chemoorganotroph. All isolates grew in a pH range from 2. 0 - 7. 0 with an optimum of 6. 5 and in the temperature range of 25 - 45 ºC with an optimum between 30 - 35 ºC. After 14 days of incubation in rubber sheet wastewater Thiobacillus sp. WI 1 produced the highest removal of COD at 54 %; but removal of BOD was only 33 %. In contrast, strain WI 4 produced the highest BOD removal at 83 % with removal of COD at only 46 %...|$|R
40|$|In heap bioleaching, acidophilic extremophiles {{contribute}} to enhanced metal extraction from mineral sulphides through the oxidation of Fe(II) and/or reduced <b>inorganic</b> <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds</b> (RISC), such as elemental sulphur or mineral sulphides, or {{the degradation of}} organic compounds derived from the ore, biota or reagents used during mineral processing. The impacts of variable solution acidity and composition, as well as temperature on the three microbiological functions have been examined for up to four bacterial species found in mineral sulphide heaps. The results indicate that bacteria adapt to sufficiently high metal concentrations (Cu, Ni, Co, Zn, As) {{to allow them to}} function in mineral sulphide heaps and, by engaging alternative metabolic pathways, to extend the solution pH range over which growth is sustained. Fluctuating temperatures during start up in sulphide heaps pose the greatest threat to efficient bacterial colonisation. The large masses of ores in bioleaching heaps mean that high temperatures arising from sulphide oxidation are hard to control initially, when the sulphide content of the ore is greatest. During that period, mesophilic and moderately thermophilic bacteria are markedly reduced in both numbers and activity...|$|R
40|$|Concretes in sewer {{systems are}} exposed to a very {{aggressive}} environment. Indeed, the effluents contain organic and <b>inorganic</b> <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds</b> allowing to be consumed by sulphur-reducing bacteria to form hydrogen sulphide. Gaseous hydrogen sulphide, which condenses on the emerged walls, is oxidized by sulphur-oxidizing bacteria in sulphuric acid form. The deterioration of the concrete structure {{is due to the}} combined effects of various mechanisms of degradation. The physico-chemical mechanisms involve cracks in concretes and corrosion of reinforcing steel leading to the irreversible damage of the sewer system. To overcome these degradations, but also to limit hydrogen sulphide formation (which is an extremely toxic and odorous gas), managers have some solutions based on oxygenation of the effluents, addition of ferrous salts in the effluents, [...] . When the concrete is deteriorated, solutions consist in repairing or replacement of concrete by new resisting concrete or polymeric materials. Nevertheless, all of these solutions are not completely effective if the global process is not considered. To respond to requests concerning the choice of adequate materials for a given environment and a defined process, the purpose of this work is to study mechanisms of biodegradation on concrete and to consider the durability of both the materials and the sewer systems. Propositions for new solutions limiting materials degradation are also exposed...|$|R

40|$|Large {{amounts of}} waste fi ne coals are very diffi cult {{to be treated}} due to the {{presence}} of ash and <b>inorganic</b> <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds.</b> In order to use waste fi ne coal effi ciently, a retrieval technique is necessary for the recov-ery of combustible contents of coal from fi ne waste coals. Nowadays, a fl otation process has been used for the treatment, but it is impractical for developing countries due to its higher costs. Therefore, oil agglomera-tion process has been used to deal with these problems. In this study, the factors affecting the coal cleaning effi ciency of the oil agglomeration process were investigated with the element contents and chemical structure of three different grade coals. Chemical contents in three different grade coals were determined by proximate and ultimate analyses and the differences in chemical structure of carbonaceous contents of different grade coals were investigated by a Fourier transform-infrared spectrometry. In free coals or their mixed samples, the ratio of ash and carbonaceous contents were maintained to make it homogeneous. From the results of oil agglomeration experiments, it was concluded that the characteristics of agglomerate and the coal cleaning effi ciency of oil agglomeration were not only infl uenced by the type of oils but also by the oxygen contents and the aromatic and aliphatic chemical structures in different grade coals. The oxygenic functional groups of carbonaceous contents in coal samples prevented oil from attaching the carbonaceous surface and form th...|$|R
40|$|The {{isolation}} {{of a number}} of strains of bacteria able to grow on dimethyl disulphide and dimethyl sulphide as sole source of energy is described. The isolates came from diverse habitats, including soil, peat, marine mud and a freshwater pond. The isolates were morphologically and physiologically best described as thiobacilli, capable of growth as Calvin cycle autotrophs on <b>inorganic</b> <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds,</b> methylated sulphides or thiocyanate. They could not grow heterotrophically or methylotrophically. One isolate (E 6) was examined in detail. Substrate oxidation kinetics indicated that methanethiol, sulphide, formaldehyde and formate, but not dimethyl sulphide, could be implicated as intermediates in dimethyl disulphide metabolism. Apparent K, values for the oxidation of dimethyl disulphide and methanethiol were 2. 5 and 3. 2 p. ~ respectively. Growth yields in chemostat culture on dimethyl disulphide with and without thiosulphate indicated that energy conservation was probably coupled to the oxidation of formaldehyde and sulphide (derived from dimethyl disulphide via methanethiol) to C 0 2 and sulphate. Maximum growth yield (Y,,,) on dimethyl disulphide was 17 g cell-carbon per mol of dimethyl disulphide. At one dilution rate (0. 078 h-l), the biomass of a culture limited by dimethyl disulphide increased when thiosulphate was also supplied, indicating a thiosulphate-dependent yield of 2 - 45 g cell-carbon mol-l. This is the first demonstration of the {{isolation of}} organisms into pure culture that are capable of growth on dimethyl disulphide as sole energy substrate, and of degrading it completely to C 0 2 and sulphate...|$|R
