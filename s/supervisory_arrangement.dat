40|$|Home country {{control has}} been a long-standing {{principle}} of supervisory governance in the internal market. However, {{in the wake of}} the financial crisis the principle has come under stress. This paper looks at ways to deal with home country control by putting forward for discussion a new paradigm which I will coin ‘home country control with consent’ (HCC-C). My aim is to examine the building blocks of HCC-C but also to reflect more generally on the merit of a (mostly horizontal) <b>supervisory</b> <b>arrangement</b> which allows other (host) actors to get involved in the decision-making of a home state authority. To describe such involvement, I will use the term ‘interference’. The basic problematic that I seek to address is that of ensuring cooperation and trust between national competent authorities. To identify the building blocks of HCC-C, I will turn to the recently enacted European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR) which provides a possible, even if embryonic, template for HCC-C...|$|E
40|$|Successful {{and timely}} {{completion}} by Dissertation Research (DR) students (i. e. research Masters and PhD) is increasingly important for students, supervisors, the university, and funding bodies alike. Previous studies highlight {{the importance of}} contributing factors, which can be classified according to their relating to the student, the <b>supervisory</b> <b>arrangement,</b> or the research infrastructure. However, {{the relative importance of}} specific factors for individual students can vary markedly across studies. In recognition of this fact, a survey of DR student completion rates and candidature duration within an Australian Faculty of Sciences (i. e. the author’s home institution and broad field of research activity) was conducted. Available information was extracted for a 10 -year window (1996 - 2006) from faculty-level and university-level databases and included data relating to demographics, field of study, attendance mode, scholarships held, and duration of candidature for up to 1688 students. The results suggest an attrition rate of 33 % with shorter completion times being seen within the School of Chemistry & Physics and among male and/or international students with scholarships. Possible predictors of HRD student success are considered, thereby beginning to provide a framework within which to develop practices to increase retention and completion rates {{in other areas of the}} faculty.

40|$|Previous {{research}} of supervision in educational psychology has regularly reported {{low rates of}} participation and dissatisfaction with the adequacy of <b>supervisory</b> <b>arrangements.</b> Most studies to date have been conducted {{on the assumption that}} supervision is a formalised, often one-to-one relationship. However, this view of supervision is incongruent with the ecological theories of human development that currently guide educational psychologists' work. The present study sought to develop understanding of the nature and contexts of supervision for a group of educational psychologists through examination of the actions they took to meet the goals of supervision. A situational analysis research method was used to examine the supervisory actions, in relation to the theories underlying current field practice, of 38 educational psychologists. This collaborative method of inquiry reflected the procedures of the psychologists' professional practice and enabled the understanding of supervision to be constructed using the participants' own sense-making processes. Results of the study indicated that the psychologists pursued the goals of supervision through the multiple interactions that took place within the regular activity of their community of practice. Supervision included a combination of formal, informal and situated interactions. It was concerned with connectedness to the professional community and comprised a range of integrated activities. The psychologists demonstrated that their supervision-in-action was guided by the same ecological principles that guided their professional practice. When supervision was conceptualised as a practice that included formal, informal and situated interactions intended to meet the goals of supervision, the participants reported high levels of satisfaction with current <b>supervisory</b> <b>arrangements</b> and participation in the practice. This thesis proposes an extended view of supervision that depicts supervision as activity situated within the interaction of a community of practice. It suggests that ecologically valid evaluations of supervision activity and the development of applicable systems of supervision must consider a wide range of supervision activities and contexts of practice...|$|R

The paper also addresses the implications of the banking-securities combination for regulatory and <b>supervisory</b> <b>arrangements.</b> The exporting of prudential requirements traditional in banking (such as capital ratios) into the securities field, and the importing of securities regulation (such as transparency requirements) into the banking sector, can be deemed mutually beneficial.
