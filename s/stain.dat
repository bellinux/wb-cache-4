5|$|H. pylori is a helix-shaped (classified as {{a curved}} rod, not spirochaete) Gram-negative {{bacterium}} about 3μm long with {{a diameter of}} about 0.5μm. H. pylori can be demonstrated in tissue by Gram <b>stain,</b> Giemsa <b>stain,</b> haematoxylin–eosin <b>stain,</b> Warthin–Starry silver <b>stain,</b> acridine orange <b>stain,</b> and phase-contrast microscopy. It is capable of forming biofilms and can convert from spiral to a possibly viable but nonculturable coccoid form.|$|E
5|$|Cytochemical {{stains on}} blood and bone marrow smears are helpful in the {{distinction}} of AML from ALL, and in subclassification of AML. The combination of a myeloperoxidase or Sudan black <b>stain</b> and a nonspecific esterase <b>stain</b> will provide the desired information in most cases. The myeloperoxidase or Sudan black reactions are most useful in establishing the identity of AML and distinguishing it from ALL. The nonspecific esterase <b>stain</b> is used to identify a monocytic component in AMLs and to distinguish a poorly differentiated monoblastic leukemia from ALL.|$|E

5|$|The {{first real}} {{progress}} toward a modern understanding of nervous function, though, came from the investigations of Luigi Galvani, who discovered that a shock of static electricity applied to an exposed nerve of a dead frog could cause its leg to contract. Since that time, each major advance in understanding has followed more or less directly from {{the development of a}} new technique of investigation. Until the early years of the 20th century, the most important advances were derived from new methods for staining cells. Particularly critical was the invention of the Golgi <b>stain,</b> which (when correctly used) stains only a small fraction of neurons, but stains them in their entirety, including cell body, dendrites, and axon. Without such a <b>stain,</b> brain tissue under a microscope appears as an impenetrable tangle of protoplasmic fibers, in which it is impossible to determine any structure. In the hands of Camillo Golgi, and especially of the Spanish neuroanatomist Santiago Ramón y Cajal, the new <b>stain</b> revealed hundreds of distinct types of neurons, each with its own unique dendritic structure and pattern of connectivity.|$|E

5|$|Though it {{was known}} {{in the nineteenth century}} that {{bacteria}} are the cause of many diseases, no effective antibacterial treatments were available. In 1910, Paul Ehrlich developed the first antibiotic, by changing dyes that selectively stained Treponema pallidum—the spirochaete that causes syphilis—into compounds that selectively killed the pathogen. Ehrlich had been awarded a 1908 Nobel Prize for his work on immunology, and pioneered the use of stains to detect and identify bacteria, with his work being the basis of the Gram <b>stain</b> and the Ziehl–Neelsen <b>stain.</b>|$|E

5|$|All Russulaceae, {{including}} the corticioid species, are characterised by spherical to elliptic basidiospores {{with a faint}} to very distinct (e.g. warty, spiny, or crested) ornamentation that stains bluish-black with Melzer's reagent (an amyloid <b>stain</b> reaction). Basidia (spore-bearing cells) are usually club-shaped and four-spored. Russulaceae species do not have clamp connections.|$|E
5|$|Phellinus ellipsoideus {{produces}} basidiospores {{that are}} ellipsoidal or broadly ellipsoidal in shape. The spore shape {{is one of}} the features that makes the species readily recognisable microscopically, and the spores measure from 4.5 to 6.1 by 3.5 to 5 micrometres(μm). The average spore length is 5.25μm, while the average width is 4.14μm. The spores have thick cell walls, and are hyaline. They are strongly cyanophilous, meaning that the cell walls will readily absorb methyl blue <b>stain.</b> In addition, they are weakly dextrinoid, meaning that they will <b>stain</b> slightly reddish-brown in Melzer's reagent or Lugol's solution. The spores are borne on barrel-shaped basidia, with four spores per basidium, measuring 8 to 12 by 6 to 7μm. There are also basidioles, which are similar in shape to the basidia, but slightly smaller.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Histopathological {{diagnosis}} of specimens is greatly dependent on good sample preparation and <b>staining.</b> Both {{of these processes}} is governed by diffusion of fluids and dyes {{in and out of}} the tissue, which is the key to <b>staining.</b> Diffusion of fluids can be accelerated by the application of heat that reduces the time of <b>staining</b> from hours to the minute. We modified an inexpensive model of kitchen microwave oven for <b>staining.</b> This study is an attempt to compare the reliability of this modified technique against the tested technique of routine <b>staining</b> so as to establish the kitchen microwave oven as a valuable diagnostic tool. Materials and Methods: Sixty different tissue blocks were used to prepare 20 pairs of slides for 4 different <b>stains</b> namely hematoxylin and eosin, Van Gieson′s, 0. 1 % toluidine blue and periodic acid-Schiff. From each tissue block, two bits of tissues were mounted on two different slides. One slide was <b>stained</b> routinely, and the other <b>stained</b> inside a microwave. A pathologist evaluated the <b>stained</b> slides and the results so obtained were analyzed statistically. Results: Microwave <b>staining</b> considerably cut down the <b>staining</b> time from hours to seconds. Microwave <b>staining</b> showed no loss of cellular and nuclear details, uniform-staining characteristics and was of excellent quality. Interpretation and Conclusion: The cellular details, nuclear details and <b>staining</b> characteristics of microwave <b>stained</b> tissues were better than or equal to the routine <b>stained</b> tissue.
