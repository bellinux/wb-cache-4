50|$|In anatomy, the {{infratentorial}} {{region of}} the brain is the area located below the tentorium cerebelli. The {{area of the brain}} above the tentorium cerebelli is the <b>supratentorial</b> region. The infratentorial region contains the cerebellum, while the <b>supratentorial</b> region contains the cerebrum. The infratentorial dura is innervated by nerves from C1-C3.|$|E
50|$|A <b>supratentorial</b> {{arachnoid}} cyst can mimic a Ménière's disease attack.|$|E
50|$|These {{are largely}} <b>supratentorial</b> tumors of {{adulthood}} that favor the frontal and temporal lobes.|$|E
50|$|The <b>supratentorial</b> {{is above}} the tentorium, in the cerebrum, and mostly found in adults (70%).|$|E
50|$|Seizures {{are much}} less common in {{patients}} with infratentorial tumors than in those with <b>supratentorial</b> tumors.|$|E
5000|$|Pineoblastomas are {{embryonal}} tumours {{originating in}} the pineal gland and are likely distinct from <b>supratentorial</b> PNETs.|$|E
50|$|Brain {{tumors are}} often {{characterized}} as <b>supratentorial</b> (above the tentorium) and infratentorial (below the tentorium). The {{location of the}} tumor can help in determining the type of tumor, as different tumors occur with different frequencies at each location. Additionally, most childhood primary brain tumors are infratentorial, while most adult primary brain tumors are <b>supratentorial.</b> The location of the tumor may have prognostic significance as well.|$|E
50|$|The Pacchionian foramen (incisura tentorii) is {{important}} due to {{some types of}} brain herniation through it, i.e. <b>supratentorial,</b> infratentorial herniation.|$|E
50|$|Pineoblastoma (also pinealoblastoma) is a {{malignant}} tumor of the pineal gland. A pineoblastoma is a <b>supratentorial</b> midline primitive neuroectodermal tumor.|$|E
50|$|Within the {{infratentorial}} {{group of}} pediatric ependymomas, radiotherapy {{was found to}} significantly increase 5-year survival. However, a retrospective review of sterotactic radiosurgery showed it provided only a modest benefit to patients who had previously undergone resection and radiation. Though other <b>supratentorial</b> tumors {{tend to have a}} better prognosis, <b>supratentorial</b> anaplastic ependymomas are the most aggressive ependymoma and neither total excision nor postoperative irradiation was found to be effective in preventing early recurrence.|$|E
50|$|Historically medulloblastomas {{have been}} {{classified}} as a PNET (primitive neuroectodermal tumour), however it is now known that medulloblastoma is distinct from <b>supratentorial</b> PNET's and are no longer considered similar entities.|$|E

50|$|Sensory {{innervation}} (nerve connection, distribution or stimulation) of the <b>supratentorial</b> {{dura mater}} membrane is via small meningeal {{branches of the}} trigeminal nerve (V1, V2 and V3). The innervation for the infratentorial dura mater are via upper cervical nerves.|$|E
50|$|AT/RTs {{can occur}} at any sites within the CNS; however, {{approximately}} 60% {{are located in}} the posterior fossa or cerebellar area. The ASCO study showed 52% posterior fossa; 39% sPNET (<b>supratentorial</b> primitive neuroectodermal tumors); 5% pineal; 2% spinal, and 2% multi-focal.|$|E
50|$|The white {{cerebellum}} sign, {{also known}} as reversal sign or dense cerebellum sign, is a radiological sign denoting the relatively white {{appearance of the}} cerebellum due to a generalized decrease in density of the <b>supratentorial</b> brain structures caused by extensive edema.|$|E
5000|$|Most MS lesions are isointense {{to white}} matter (they appear bright) on T1-weighted MRI, {{but some are}} [...] "hypointense" [...] (lower intensity). These are called [...] "black holes" [...] (BH). They appear {{specially}} in the <b>supratentorial</b> region of the brain.|$|E
50|$|Pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma usually {{develops}} {{within the}} <b>supratentorial</b> region (the {{area of the}} brain located above the tentorium cerebelli). It is generally located superficially (in the uppermost sections) in the cerebral hemispheres, and involves the leptomeninges. It rarely arises from the spinal cord.|$|E
5000|$|Comparative genomic {{hybridization}} (CGH) {{experiments have}} shown pediatric ependymomas possess {{a number of}} genomic anomalies not seen in adult ependymomas. [...] In addition, ependymomas from different locations within {{the central nervous system}} (spinal, <b>supratentorial,</b> and infratentorial) can be distinguished by their chromosomal, immunohistochemical, and gene expression differences.|$|E
50|$|Kernohan's notch is {{a groove}} in the {{cerebral}} peduncle {{which may be}} caused by this displacement of the brainstem against the tentorial incisure. The resulting ipsilateral hemiparesis is a false localising sign, known as the Kernohan-Woltman syndrome. This may succeed or accompany temporal lobe (uncal) herniation and subfalcian herniation secondary to a <b>supratentorial</b> mass.|$|E
5000|$|Superior cistern - It is {{situated}} dorsal to the midbrain. Thin, sheet-like {{extensions of the}} superior cistern that extend laterally about the midbrain, connecting it to the interpeduncular cistern. Ambient cistern may also refer to {{the combination of these}} extensions and the superior cistern. It is composed of a <b>supratentorial</b> and an infratentorial compartment.It contains: ...|$|E
50|$|Atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor (AT/RT) {{is a rare}} tumor usually {{diagnosed}} in childhood. Although usually a brain tumor, AT/RT can occur anywhere in {{the central nervous system}} (CNS) including the spinal cord. About 60% will be in the posterior cranial fossa (particularly the cerebellum). One review estimated 52% posterior fossa, 39% sPNET (<b>supratentorial</b> primitive neuroectodermal tumors), 5% pineal, 2% spinal, and 2% multi-focal.|$|E
50|$|Inherited {{forms of}} retinoblastomas {{are more likely}} to be bilateral. In addition, {{inherited}} uni- or bilateral retinoblastomas may be associated with pineoblastoma and other malignant midline <b>supratentorial</b> primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNET) with a dismal outcome; retinoblastoma concurrent with a PNET is known as trilateral retinoblastoma. A recent meta-analysis has shown that survival of trilateral retinoblastoma has increased substantially over the last decades.|$|E
50|$|Choroid plexus {{papilloma}} {{occurs in}} the lateral ventricles of children and in the fourth ventricle of adults. This is unlike most other pediatric tumors and adult tumors, in which {{the locations of the}} tumors is reversed. In children, brain tumors are usually found in the infratentorial region and in adults, brain tumors are usually found in the <b>supratentorial</b> space. The relationship is reversed for choroid plexus papillomas.|$|E
5000|$|Notch {{signaling}} pathway and HOX family of transcription factors are up regulated in <b>supratentorial</b> and spinal ependymomas respectively. [...] Over-expression of Notch ligands, receptors, and target genes (HES1, HEY2, and MYC), {{as well as}} down-regulation of Notch repressor (Fbxw7) are found in pediatric ependymoma. Inhibition of Notch pathway impairs tumor growth in vitro. Notch target ErbB2 is up-regulated in most ependymomas, correlating with poor outcome.|$|E
50|$|A coma can be {{classified}} as (1) <b>supratentorial</b> (above Tentorium cerebelli), (2) infratentorial (below Tentorium cerebelli), (3) metabolic or (4) diffused. This classification is merely dependent on {{the position of the}} original damage that caused the coma, and does not correlate with severity or the prognosis.The severity of coma impairment however is categorized into several levels. Patients may or may not progress through these levels. In the first level, the brain responsiveness lessens, normal reflexes are lost, the patient no longer responds to pain and cannot hear.|$|E
50|$|Choroid plexus carcinomas {{typically}} {{occur in}} the lateral ventricles in children and in the fourth ventricle of adults. The third ventricle is the least common ventricle effected. This is unlike most other pediatric and adult tumors, as {{the locations of the}} tumors are typically reversed. These tumors are usually found in the infratentorial region in children and in the <b>supratentorial</b> space in adults. Choroid plexus carcinomas can induce hydrocephalus through a variety of mechanisms, including blockage of normal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow, the tumor overproducing CSF, spontaneous hemorrhage, and expansion of the ventricles.|$|E
5000|$|Astroblastoma {{is a rare}} glial tumor {{derived from}} the astroblast, a type of cell that closely resembles spongioblastoma and astrocytes. Astroblastoma cells are most likely found in the <b>supratentorial</b> region {{of the brain that}} houses the cerebrum, an area {{responsible}} for all voluntary movements in the body. [...] It also occurs significantly in the frontal lobe, parietal lobe, and temporal lobe, areas where movement, language creation, memory perception, and environmental surroundings are expressed. These tumors can be present in major brain areas not associated with the main cerebral hemispheres, including the cerebellum, optic nerve, cauda equina, hypothalamus, and brain stem.|$|E
5000|$|Significant debate remains over grading of ependymomas, {{though the}} WHO 2007 {{classification}} lists subependymoma (grade I), myxopapillary ependymoma (grade I), ependymoma (grade II), and anaplastic ependymoma (grade III) {{as the primary}} classifications. [...] This classification scheme further designates four subtypes within the ependymoma group. However, there are several recognized subtypes of ependymoma with differing pathologies. These include myxopapillary ependymoma (MEPN) which tend to grow slowly and are restricted to the conus medullaris-cauda equina-filum terminale region of the spinal cord, intracranial, infratentorial (posterior fossa), intracranial <b>supratentorial,</b> and spinal ependymoma, and subependymomas. Reports have shown that location-based classification is most relevant to the molecular characteristics, implicating underlying tissue-specificity effects.|$|E
5000|$|This gene {{is one of}} the PMS2 {{gene family}} members which are found in {{clusters}} on chromosome 7. Human PMS2 related genes are located at bands 7p12, 7p13, 7q11, and 7q22. Exons 1 through 5 of these homologues share high degree of identity to human PMS2 [...] The product of this gene is involved in DNA mismatch repair. The protein forms a heterodimer with MLH1 and this complex interacts with MSH2 bound to mismatched bases. Defects in this gene are associated with hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer, with Turcot syndrome, and are a cause of <b>supratentorial</b> primitive neuroectodermal tumors. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been observed.|$|E
