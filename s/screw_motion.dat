50|$|Mozzi {{considers}} a rigid body undergoing first a rotation about an axis {{passing through the}} center of mass and then a translation of displacement D in an arbitrary direction. Any rigid motion can be accomplished in this way due to a theorem by Euler on the existence of an axis of rotation. The displacement D of the center of mass can be decomposed into components parallel and perpendicular to the axis. The perpendicular (and parallel) component acts on all points of the rigid body but Mozzi shows that for some points the previous rotation acted exactly with an opposite displacement, so those points are translated parallelly to the axis of rotation. These points lie on the Mozzi axis through which the rigid motion can be accomplished through a <b>screw</b> <b>motion.</b>|$|E
