The new heat pump design of <b>spiral</b> <b>type</b> with LED ring semiconductor structures, powered by magnetic induction is proposed. The efficiency of LED ring semiconductor structures that operate at low temperatures due to {{the difference in the}} levels of energy charges in p- and n-regions isrevealed. The mathematical model for the electrical and thermal parameters calculating of energy-efficient thermoelectric heat pump of the <b>spiral</b> <b>type</b> is developed. The diagram of coolant temperature dependence at the outlet of energy-efficient thermoelectric heat pump of <b>spiral</b> <b>type</b> on the supply current is built. The efficiency of <b>spiral</b> <b>type</b> thermoelectric heat pump application for cooling of the internal combustion engine is proven.  </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{extend our}} spiral galaxy models that {{successfully}} describe nearby template spectra {{as well as}} the redshift evolution of CFRS and HDF spirals to include – in a chemically consistent way – the redshift evolution of a series of individual elements. Comparison with observed DLA abundances shows that DLAs might well be the progenitors of present-day <b>spiral</b> <b>types</b> Sa through Sd. Our models bridge the gap between high redshift DLA and nearby spiral HII region abundances. The slow redshift evolution of DLA abundances is a natural consequence of the long SF timescales for disks, the scatter at any redshift reflects the range of SF timescales from early to late <b>spiral</b> <b>types.</b> We claim that while at high redshift all <b>spiral</b> progenitor <b>types</b> seem to give rise to DLA absorption, towards low redshifts, the early <b>type</b> <b>spirals</b> seem to drop out of DLA samples due to low gas and/or high metal and dust content. Model implications for the spectrophotometric properties of the DLA galaxy population are discussed in the context of campaigns for the optical identifications of DLA galaxies both at low and high redshift. 1...|$|R

The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate possible gender differences in the morphology of the gallbladder channel (DC). A total sample consists of 50 anatomical liver taken from autopsy cases of both sexes (32 men and 18 women). Samples of liver were fixed in 4 % formalin for 4 weeks, and then studied microdissected under scrutiny. We were working length measurement channels of the gallbladder (DC) and typing of junction of the cystic (DC) with the common hepatic duct (DHC). We classify anatomical junction variations DC with DHC into three types: angular, parallel and <b>spiral</b> <b>type,</b> and then performed statistical analysis of the data with respect to gender. Results: The angular type compound we found approximately at 2 / 3 or 64 % of the samples (men- 60 % of women- 72 %), the parallel type combination of a total of 22 % of the sample (men- 31 % of women- 6 %) and <b>spiral</b> <b>type</b> of 14 % of the samples (males- 9 %, women 22 %). Parallel and <b>spiral</b> <b>type</b> together make up about 1 / 3 of the cases. The average length of DC is 3. 1 cm and the variation interval of 1. 7 to 6. 2 cm.

40|$|Received; {{accepted}} – 2 – We observationally {{study the}} current star formation activities of early <b>type</b> <b>spiral</b> galaxies. We construct a complete sample of 15 early <b>type</b> <b>spirals</b> having far-infrared (FIR) to optical B band luminosity ratios, log(LFIR/LB), {{larger than the}} average of the type, and make their CCD imaging of the R and Hα bands. The equivalent widths of Hα emission increase with increasing LFIR/LB, indicating that log(LFIR/LB) can be an indicator of star formation for such early <b>type</b> <b>spirals</b> with star formation activities higher than the average. For all of the observed early <b>type</b> <b>spirals,</b> the extended H II regions exist at the central regions with some asymmetric features. Hα emission is more concentrated to the galactic center than the R band light, and the degree of the concentration increases with the star formation activity. We also analyze the relation between the star formation activities and the existence of companion galaxies in the sample galaxies and other bright early <b>type</b> <b>spirals.</b> No correlation is found and this suggests that the interaction is not responsible for all of the star formation activities of early <b>type</b> <b>spirals...</b>|$|R
