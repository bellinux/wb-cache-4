5|$|Cross-country <b>skiing</b> <b>is</b> a form {{of skiing}} where skiers rely on their own {{locomotion}} to move across snow-covered terrain, rather than using ski lifts {{or other forms of}} assistance. Cross-country <b>skiing</b> <b>is</b> widely practiced as a sport and recreational activity; however, some still use it as a means of transportation. Variants of cross-country skiing are adapted to a range of terrain which spans unimproved, sometimes mountainous terrain to groomed courses that are specifically designed for the sport.|$|E
5|$|On {{the days}} after the pass reopens in the spring, backcountry skiers often take {{advantage}} of the remaining snow on the slopes. In years following heavy winters, <b>skiing</b> <b>is</b> possible into July.|$|E
5|$|Winter {{recreation}} in Glacier is limited. Snowmobiling {{is illegal}} throughout the park. Cross-country <b>skiing</b> <b>is</b> permitted {{in the lower}} altitude valleys away from avalanche zones.|$|E
50|$|<b>Skis</b> <b>were</b> once unisex, {{but today}} <b>skis</b> <b>are</b> {{designed}} to suit {{both men and}} women. Compared to men's <b>skis,</b> women's <b>skis</b> <b>are</b> built for smaller, less powerful frames, and have a waist that’s farther forward to better match a woman’s relatively lower center of gravity relative to a man.|$|R
50|$|Twin-tip <b>skis</b> <b>are</b> used in {{events such}} as slopestyle and halfpipe. Mogul <b>skis</b> <b>are</b> used in moguls and {{sometimes}} in aerials. Specially designed racing <b>skis</b> <b>are</b> used in <b>ski</b> cross. Ski bindings took a major design change to include plate bindings mounted {{to the bottom of}} the skiers boot to allow for multi-directional release.|$|R
50|$|<b>Ski</b> <b>is</b> bottled {{in several}} {{bottling}} facilities across the United States. <b>Ski</b> <b>is</b> distributed in Alabama, Alaska, California, Georgia, Indiana, Illinois, Kentucky, Missouri, North Carolina, Ohio, Tennessee, Utah, Virginia, and West Virginia.|$|R
5|$|Competitive {{cross-country}} <b>skiing</b> <b>is</b> {{one of the}} Nordic skiing sports. Cross-country {{skiing and}} rifle marksmanship are the two components of biathlon, ski-orienteering {{is a form of}} cross-country skiing, which includes map navigation along snow trails and tracks.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{cross-country}} <b>skiing</b> <b>is</b> {{similar to}} the original form of skiing, from which all skiing disciplines evolved, including alpine skiing, ski jumping and Telemark skiing. Skiers propel themselves either by striding forward (classic style) or side-to-side in a skating motion (skate skiing), aided by arms pushing on ski poles against the snow. It is practised in regions with snow-covered landscapes, including Northern Europe, Canada, Russia and regions in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Yosemite Valley is {{open all}} year, {{although}} some roads {{within the park}} close in winter. Downhill <b>skiing</b> <b>is</b> available at the Badger Pass Ski Area—the oldest downhill skiing area in California, offering downhill skiing from mid-December through early April. Much of the park is open to cross-country skiing and snowshoeing, with several backcountry ski huts open for use. Wilderness permits are required for backcountry overnight ski trips.|$|E
50|$|Outrigger <b>skis</b> <b>were</b> used on sleds {{during the}} 1960s {{as a way}} of keeping a {{traditional}} sled balanced by putting a third ski underneath the sled. Now, outrigger <b>skis</b> <b>are</b> <b>skis</b> that <b>are</b> used to help skiers balance, turn, control their speed and stop. They also help to amplify the direction of a turn initiated by shifts in the upper body.|$|R
5000|$|Freestyle skiing - While moguls <b>skiing</b> <b>was</b> an {{official}} discipline, aerials and <b>ski</b> ballet <b>were</b> still considered as demonstration events.|$|R
50|$|Approximately 200,000 {{pairs of}} Karhu branded <b>skis</b> <b>are</b> sold in Finland each year. The major export markets for Karhu <b>skis</b> <b>are</b> Sweden, Japan, Estonia and Germany. Production of Karhu skis ended in spring 2013 at Kitee Ski oy (known until 2012 as Karhu Ski oy) in Kitee, Finland. The {{licensing}} {{and marketing of}} Karhu <b>skis</b> <b>were</b> transferred in September 2012 to Startex oy, a Finnish firm known for its ski wax products.|$|R
5|$|Alpine <b>skiing</b> <b>is</b> an Olympic sport, contested at the Winter Olympic Games. The first Winter Olympics, held in 1924, {{included}} nordic skiing, but {{the first}} alpine skiing events were not held until 1936 in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany. A combined event was held {{for both men and}} women in 1936. The International Ski Federation (FIS) decided that ski instructors could not compete in 1936 because they were professionals, and the Olympics were meant for amateur athletes. Because of this, Austrian and Swiss skiers boycotted the events, although some Austrians decided to compete for Germany.|$|E
5|$|Freestyle <b>skiing</b> <b>is</b> {{one of the}} six skiing {{disciplines}} contested at the Winter Olympic Games, and one of the youngest. In 1924, {{the first}} Winter Olympics featured Nordic skiing disciplines (cross-country skiing, ski jumping, and Nordic combined), while alpine skiing was first contested in 1936. Only at the 1992 Winter Olympics, in Albertville, France, were freestyle skiing events first held as official medal events. Before that, freestyle skiing was contested at the 1988 Winter Olympics as a demonstration sport, consisting of events {{for both men and women}} in three variants: moguls, aerials and ski ballet. In Albertville, moguls was the first-ever official freestyle skiing medal event; aerials and ski ballet were also held but still as demonstration events. The growing popularity of aerials convinced the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to add this freestyle discipline to the 1994 Winter Olympics official program. Moguls and aerials have thus been contested at every Winter Games since. Ski cross inclusion in the Winter Olympics program was approved at an IOC Executive Board meeting in November 2006, and the first events were held at the 2010 Winter Olympics.|$|E

5|$|<b>Skis</b> <b>are</b> lighter, {{narrower}} {{and designed}} to be faster than those used in recreational cross-country skiing and made of composite materials. For classic events, typical <b>ski</b> lengths <b>are</b> between 195 and 210 centimetres, while ski lengths for skating are 170 to 200cm. <b>Skis</b> for skating <b>are</b> also more rigid than skis for classical. <b>Skis</b> <b>are</b> waxed for speed and, {{in the case of}} classic skis, traction when striding forward. Racing <b>ski</b> boots <b>are</b> also lighter than recreational ones and are attached at the toe only to bindings that are specialized for classic or skate skiing.|$|R
50|$|Until {{the mid-19th}} century <b>skiing</b> <b>was</b> {{primarily}} used for transport, and since then has become a recreation and sport. Military <b>ski</b> races <b>were</b> held in Norway during the 18th century, and <b>ski</b> warfare <b>was</b> studied in the late 18th century. As equipment evolved and <b>ski</b> lifts <b>were</b> developed <b>skiing</b> evolved into two main genres during the late 19th and early 20th century, Alpine and Nordic.|$|R

25|$|A ski chalet was {{constructed}} at Mount Franklin in 1938 {{to service the}} Canberra Alpine Club. Ski runs were cleared and ski tows were improvised. The chalet later operated as a museum before being destroyed in the 2003 bushfires. A new shelter designed and built by University of Adelaide students opened in 2008. Today, cross country <b>skiing</b> <b>is</b> possible in the area, when conditions allow. Cross Country <b>skiing</b> <b>is</b> also practised at Mount Gingera, which rises above the city of Canberra to an elevation of 1855m, and is the most prominent snow-covered peak above the city.|$|E
