5000|$|... "Under the Banner of King Death" [...] saw {{the crew}} {{fighting}} the zombie pirates of Doctor Orlando Doyle, and culminated in an appearance by Satan himself. Interestingly, {{it was this}} first story that saw {{the destruction of the}} erstwhile pirate's ship and the deaths of most of the crew.It was also where Erebus joined the team - sent on a spiritual quest by Isabella's shaman father, Jack Dancer travelled to the Spirit World and decapitated Erebus in order to use his immortal heads as a <b>spirit</b> <b>compass</b> to help him locate Isabella, who had been kidnapped by Doyle.|$|E
50|$|The {{cause of}} the crash is given in the {{official}} report as being the combination of several factors with the main ones being icing of the wings and fuselage {{and the loss of}} No. 2 engine, but many questions remain, including why the aircraft turned away from Green 1 rather than toward it (reporting to ATC that it was on Green 1), and why this was picked up by neither the pilot nor First Officer despite <b>spirit</b> <b>compasses</b> and several radio aids-to-navigation on board which should have made the error rather obvious.|$|R
60|$|Now {{what these}} wicked <b>spirits</b> cannot <b>compass</b> by the vast disproportion of their forces {{to those of}} the {{superior}} beings, they may by their fraud and cunning carry farther in a seeming league, confederacy, or subserviency to the designs of some good angel, as far as consists with his purity to suffer such an aid, the end of which may possibly be disguised and concealed from his finite knowledge. This is indeed to suppose a great error in such a being; yet since a devil can appear like an angel of light, since craft and malice may sometimes blind for a while a more perfect understanding; and lastly, since Milton has given us an example of the like nature, when Satan, appearing like a cherub to Uriel, the intelligence of the sun, circumvented him even in his own province, and passed only for a curious traveller through those new-created regions, that he might observe therein the workmanship of God and praise Him in His works--I know not why, upon the same supposition, or some other, a fiend may not deceive a creature of more excellency than himself, but yet a creature; at least, by the connivance or tacit permission of the Omniscient Being.|$|R
60|$|How Torfrida of St. Omer, born at Aries in Provence, confest {{that from}} her youth up {{she had been}} given to the {{practice}} of diabolic arts, and had at divers times and places used the same, both alone and with Richilda, late Countess of Hainault. How, wickedly, wantonly, and instinct with a malignant <b>spirit,</b> she had <b>compassed,</b> by charms and spells, to win the love of Hereward. How she had ever since kept in bondage him, and others whom she had not loved with the same carnal love, but only desired to make them useful to her own desire of power and glory, by the same magical arts; for which she now humbly begged pardon of Holy Church, and of all Christian folk; and, penetrated with compunction, desired only that she might retire into the convent of Crowland. She asserted the marriage which she had so unlawfully compassed to be null and void; and prayed to be released therefrom, as a burden to her conscience and soul, that she might spend {{the rest of her life}} in penitence for her many enormous sins. She submitted herself to the judgment of Holy Church, only begging that this her free confession might be counted in her favor and that she might hot be put to death, as she deserved, nor sent into perpetual imprisonment; because her mother-in-law according to the flesh, the Countess Godiva, being old and infirm, had daily need of her; and she wished to serve her menially as long as she lived. After which, she put herself utterly upon the judgment of the Church. And meanwhile, she desired and prayed that she might be allowed to remain at large in the said monastery of Crowland, not leaving the precincts thereof, without special leave given by the Abbot and prioress in one case between her and them reserved; to wear garments of hair-cloth; to fast all the year on bread and water; and to be disciplined with rods or otherwise, at such times as the prioress should command, and to such degree as her body, softened with carnal luxury, could reasonably endure. And beyond--that, being dead to the world, God might have mercy on her soul.|$|R
