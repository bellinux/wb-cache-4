40|$|ABSTRACT Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} {{study the effects of}} number of nipple waterers (NW) per four-bird, deep cage (30. 5 x 45. 7 cm deep) or <b>shallow</b> <b>cage</b> of exact reverse dimensions and location of these waterers on productivity of commercial strain of White Leghorn layers reared in floor pens equipped with either dome or trigger cup waterers. The pullets were housed in laying cages at 18 wk of age. In both experiments, cage shape had no significant effects on the variables measured. Location of NW effects varied between experiments; hens in cages with NW located {{in the front of the}} cage had a significantly (P< 05) lower rate of lay (1. 7 %) in Experiment 2 and less mortality (5. 4 %) in Experiment 1 than those in cages with NW located in the rear. Location of NW had a NS effect on water consumption in both experiments. Number of NW per cage significantly (P< 05) affected water consumption in both experiments. Hens in cages with two NW consumed 32. 5 and 36. 7 mL/hen day more water in Experiment 1 and 2, respectively, than those in cages with one NW.

40|$|ABSTRACT Three cage {{designs and}} three {{population}} densities were evaluated for production and economic performance traits of caged layers. A deep cage measuring 38. 1 cm {{across the front}} and 50. 8 cm in depth was compared with two <b>shallow</b> <b>cages</b> measuring 60. 9 cm across the front and 31. 8 cm and 35. 5 cm in depth (shallow A and shallow B, respectively). Population sizes were 4, 5, and 6 birds per cage. Birds in the <b>shallow</b> <b>cages</b> had higher hen-day egg production values, gained more weight, had larger egg weights and egg mass, produced more eggs grading large and extra large, used more feed, and had higher pullet and feed costs than birds in the deep cages. Hen-housed production and mortality differences for cage designed were not present. Birds in <b>shallow</b> <b>cages</b> also had poorer feed conversion figures and reduced net egg incomes. Differences between the shallow A and <b>shallow</b> B design <b>cages</b> {{were not significantly different}} (P>. 05) for the traits measured except for egg loss. Increasing density reduced most performance and economic factors. Exceptions were observed for mortality, egg weight, eggs grading large, and undergrades for which significant differences for population densities were not found. Significant (P<. 05) cage design by density interactions were present for hen-day production, feed usage, and pullet plus feed costs. (Key words: cage type, density, and performance...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Two {{groups of}} White Leghorn pullets, reared in floor pens, were {{observed}} {{for changes in}} behavioral traits when housed in cages. Data in Experiment 1 were obtained during Days 1 to 5 posthousing from 40 pullets kept in eight 40. 7 -cm wide x 45. 7 -cm deep cages with either four or six birds/cage and in Experiment 2 during Days 1 to 5 and Day 7 posthousing from 24 pullets housed four/cage in three 30. 5 -cmwide x 45. 7 -cm deep cages (deep cages), and three 45. 7 -cm wide x 30. 5 -cm deep <b>cages</b> (<b>shallow</b> <b>cages).</b> In Experiment 1, pullets housed four/cage spent significantly (P<. 05) fewer periods standing and crouching, but more periods preening, feeding, and performing comfort movements, than those housed six/cage. There was a significant group size x days posthousing interaction for standing and drinking. Standing was most frequent in the four-hen cages on Day 1 and then declined, whereas periods of standing increased in six-bird cages. Drinking behaviors were significantly different only on Day 1; six birds per cage had the lowest level. In Experiment 2, pullets in deep cages spent significantly more periods standing and moving and fewer periods crouching. Crouching frequencies declined from Day 1 to Day 7 posthousing for birds in both deep and <b>shallow</b> <b>cages.</b> Although there were significant cage shape x days posthousing interactions for all behavior observed, the interactions appeared {{to be associated with}} erratic day-to-day differences between hens in deep and <b>shallow</b> <b>cages.</b> (Key words: cage shape, density, settling in behavior...|$|R
5000|$|There is {{no clear}} limit {{to the size of}} the {{furnished}} cages. Although initial models were not much larger than conventional battery cages, most current designs house 40 to 80 hens although one system houses 115 hens.The depth of furnished cages is often more than the depth of battery cages and as a result, they are often arranged with only one cage row per level, i.e. not connected back-to-back. The more <b>shallow</b> <b>cages</b> can be connected back-to-back. To create space for large groups of hens, some designs of furnished cages are very long. Cage bottoms are made of wire mesh or plastic slats and are sloped so that eggs not laid in the nest box roll onto an egg belt. Feed is provided in feeders outside the cage, although in some designs there may be internal feeders or a combination of the two. [...] Perches in some designs are raised and in others are at floor level.|$|R
50|$|Little {{is known}} about the biology of the cocinero, with only the broad diet and short term growth rates studied. The species is predatory, taking small fish and crustaceans, as well as various benthic {{invertebrates}} in <b>shallower</b> waters. <b>Cage</b> studies in less than optimal estuarine water conditions found the cocinero has a daily growth rate of between 0.37 and 0.55 g/day, with this noted as being much slower as some Indo-pacific carangids. The authors of this study concluded this was partly due to the water being polluted with hydrocarbons, and less than optimal fodder being given.|$|R
50|$|Cobia larvae {{metamorphose}} to gill respiration 11-15 days post hatching. At 15-25 days post hatching, cobia are weaned onto commercial formulated feeds. Rearing cobia larvae at salinities {{as low as}} 15 ppt is possible. Fully weaned fingerlings {{weighing up}} to one gram are transferred to juvenile culture tanks. Later cobia juveniles can be raised in ponds or <b>shallow,</b> near-shore submerged <b>cages.</b>|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Insufficient feeder {{space for}} laying hens could {{increase}} {{competition at the}} feed trough, leading to disrupted feeding, inadequate nutrient intake, stress, and reduced productivity. The effects of feeder space allocation (FSA) on physiology and productivity were evaluated in beak-trimmed Hy-Line W- 36 hens (n = 480). They were obtained at 16. 5 wk of age and housed on 4 tiers of <b>shallow</b> conventional <b>cages.</b> Five pullets/ cage were housed at a stocking density of 434 cm 2 /hen and a feeder space of 12. 2 cm/hen. After 1. 5 wk of accli-mation, baseline measurements were taken for feed utili-zation, bone mineralization, and heterophil:lymphocyte ratios. At 20 wk of age, pullets were given 5. 8, 7. 1, 8. 4, 9. 7, 10. 9, or 12. 2 cm of feeder space/bird (16 cages/ treatment). Physiological and production measure...|$|R
