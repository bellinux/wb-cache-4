As they started to march toward the strikers' camp, miners at the Strong mine blew up the shafthouse, hurling the structure more than 300 feet into the air. A few moments later, the <b>steam</b> <b>boiler</b> was also dynamited, showering the deputies with timber, iron and cable. The deputies fled to the rail station and left town.|$|E
5|$|In 1908, Erie started {{building}} a waterworks on Presque Isle to provide fresh {{water for the}} city. Water from Lake Erie was pumped into two reservoirs on the peninsula, where particulates in the water were allowed to settle, removing them from the lake water. After treatment, the water flowed into the waterlines of the city. In 1917 a pumphouse powered by a <b>steam</b> <b>boiler</b> and engine was built: this pumped the water from one basin into the other, then across Presque Isle Bay to Erie. This system of supplying drinking water for Erie operated until 1949. The pumphouse is now used for zebra mussel control and as a concession stand for bicycle and quadracycle-rentals within the state park.|$|E

5|$|In 1915, O'Brien, by now in {{poor health}} as a {{consequence}} of alcohol abuse, sold his shares in the brewery to Joseph Segber, who appointed F. Vinnicomb to manage the company day-to-day. The sale of alcohol in the territory was suspended in the autumn of 1919, full prohibition followed the next year, and the company ceased trading. Initially the premises were kept maintained, probably in case the company was able to reopen, but most of the equipment was sold off to a new brewery in Fairbanks in 1933. The buildings were soon dismantled, probably for firewood, and vegetation reclaimed the site. The rusting brewery <b>steam</b> <b>boiler</b> remained on the site, surrounded by mounds of used bottles, many of which were dug up and removed by collectors over subsequent years, leaving perhaps over 3,000 intact bottles still in place. The remains of a Perfection Bottling Machine and a Crown capping device were left buried beneath the debris.|$|E

25|$|By {{the middle}} of the 19th century, there was a railroad, the Hudson (later West Side) Line, running from the current Hudson Yards area between 30th and 32nd Streets south to Chambers Street. At the time, the city {{prohibited}} steam locomotives from operating below 30th Street because of the risk of the train's <b>steam</b> <b>boiler</b> exploding, so passengers from points north were forced to switch to horse-drawn trains.

He also purchased the adjoining property at 104-106 Goerck St., upon which stood a small three-storey building. Roach used the third floor as a pattern shop, while renting out the first and second floors to an iron shutter manufacturer.|$|E

40|$|Ecodesign is an {{important}} instrument of European energy policy making, which drives technological development and leads to significant energy savings by improving the environmental performance of energy-related products. Minimum energy performance standards and voluntary agreements which have been introduced under the Ecodesign Directive and so far concern more than 20 different product groups. One of the product groups currently investigated for possible regulation includes industrial <b>steam</b> <b>boilers.</b> According to estimates, industrial steam generation systems account for about {{one third of the}} overall industrial energy demand. Consequently, increasing energy efficiency in steam generation is relevant for suppliers, users and policy makers.

25|$|Production {{of rolling}} {{stock in the}} area had started already back in 1889, and new {{facilities}} were built in 1898 in an area recently gained. As the new premises were next to railway connection, transportation of products became easier. During 1898–1899 a new sawmill building was constructed from bricks to {{the border of the}} factory area, next to Tokankatu street. A brick-made pump house was built in 1899 and in the following year it was equipped by steam powered centrifugal pump made by Scottish Drysdale & Co. At the same time a new prime power machinery building with a chimney was constructed next to it, to the place of the old sawmill and storage.

25|$|Despite the new {{efficiencies}} {{introduced by}} the turnpikes and canals, travel along these routes was still time-consuming and expensive. The idea of integrating a <b>steam</b> <b>boiler</b> and propulsion system can be first attributed to John Fitch and James Rumsey who both filed for patents or state monopolies on steamboats in the late 1780s. However, these first steamboats were complicated, heavy, and expensive. It would be almost 20 years until Robert R. Livingston contracted a civil engineer named Robert Fulton to develop an economical steamboat. Fulton's paddle steamer, The North River Steamboat (erroneously {{referred to as the}} Clermont), made its first trip from New York City north on the Hudson River to Albany on August 17, 1807. By 1820, steamboat services had been established on all the Atlantic tidal rivers and Chesapeake Bay. The shallow-bottomed boats were also ideally suited navigating the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers and the number of boats on these rivers increased from 17 boats to 727 boats between 1817 and 1855. The speed of the steamboats decreased travel times between coastal ports and upstream cities by weeks and costs for transporting goods along these rivers by as much as 90%.|$|E
