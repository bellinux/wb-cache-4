25|$|The Mighty Avengers invaded Latveria, Von Doom's nation, {{due to his}} {{involvement}} in creating a chemical bomb that would infect people with the symbiote (though it was recently revealed that this attack was actually set up by Kristoff Vernard to put Doom {{out of the picture}} prior to Kristoff's future attempt at a coup). Due to Ultron's interference, the bomb was dropped on Manhattan, but the Mighty Avengers are able to stop the effects on the people. The Mighty Avengers proceed to invade Latveria. During the invasion, the Sentry, Iron Man, and Von Doom are sent to the past, thanks to the Latverian ruler’s time platform. Eventually, the trio breaks into the Baxter Building and make use of a confiscated time machine to return to the present era, the Sentry taking advantage of the fact he will soon be forgotten by the world to easily defeat the Thing. Doctor Doom transports himself to Morgana's castle to <b>summon</b> <b>up</b> a magical army and captures the Avengers, but they free themselves and he is arrested for terrorist crimes against humanity after a brief struggle that culminated with the Sentry tearing off Doctor Doom's mask.|$|E

500|$|Srijit Mukherji's period drama Begum Jaan (2017) saw Vidya {{play the}} role of the titular procurer. A Hindi {{language}} remake of the Bengali film Rajkahini (2015), Begum Jaan tells the story of how the lives of prostitutes living in brothel are affected by the partition of India in 1947. In preparation, Vidya worked with Mukherji to provide a backstory to her character, and she researched on the era by reading Urvashi Butalia’s novel The Other Side of Silence. Filming in the barren landscape of rural Jharkhand proved to be a challenge for Vidya, and she said that the experience taught her that [...] "if push comes to shove, I can brave scorpions, snakes and whatever else". Anna M.M. Vetticad of Firstpost disliked the film, and wrote that [...] " [...] – who has been so wonderful in the past – is unable to dig deep and <b>summon</b> <b>up</b> a relatable human being, because {{there is nothing in the}} writing that she can dig into." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{earliest}} {{incarnation of}} [...] "Stay (Faraway, So Close!)" [...] was {{developed during the}} recording sessions for Achtung Baby. While working in Hansa Ton Studios in Berlin, guitarist The Edge and lead singer Bono created the verse. The track was given the working title [...] "Sinatra" [...] {{in reference to the}} artist whose music inspired it. The group reworked it in preparation of Zooropa. The Edge noted [...] "it came to us in installments". Bassist Adam Clayton said [...] "it was hard to figure out how we would do it. I mean, {{no one is going to}} mistake us for Frank Sinatra's backing band. A very humble little combo sound is what we ended up with and that really worked." [...] The Edge added [...] "I was playing around on piano with some old-school chord progressions trying to <b>summon</b> <b>up</b> the spirit of Frank Sinatra. It's definitely not from a rock and roll tradition." [...] He worked out a chord progression based on old Tin Pan Alley songs.|$|E
500|$|The British POWs {{provided}} the Americans with necessary advice regarding the camp life and shared rations and clothing {{sent by the}} British Red Cross. The British, {{who were in the}} process of digging an escape tunnel, requested help from the Americans. Juskalian would later describe the operation: [...] "I volunteered, although I have had claustrophobia ever since a boyhood friend shut me up in a wood bin for a prank. When I look back at it, I wonder how I did it. Some nights when I think about it, I break out in a cold sweat. Somehow, I was able to <b>summon</b> <b>up</b> the will to do it. The tunnel was already some 80 to 100feet long. It extended underground beyond the barbed wire fence, but those in charge wanted to lengthen it so that the opening would come out below ground level on the steep side near the bank of the Fulda River. In that way when the tunnel was broken open, the escapees could not be seen by the guards in the towers." ...|$|E

[...] President Higgins described Catherine Corless' work as [...] "another necessary step in blowing open the locked doors of a hidden Ireland." ...|$|E
2500|$|Thus, {{it seemed}} quite logical {{to promote the}} group as [...] "Captain Beefheart and his Magic Band", around the concept that Captain Beefheart had [...] "magic powers" [...] and, upon {{drinking}} a [...] "Pepsi", could <b>summon</b> <b>up</b> [...] "His Magic Band" [...] to appear and perform behind him. The strands of this logic emanated from Vliet's Beefheart persona having been [...] "written in" [...] as {{a character in a}} [...] "teenage operetta" [...] that Zappa had formulated, along with Van Vliet's renowned [...] "Pepsi moods" [...] with his mother Willie Sue and his generally spoilt teenage demeanor. The name [...] "His Magic Band" [...] changed to [...] "the Magic Band" [...] in 1972.|$|E

Bellamy said: [...] "It {{was supposed to be}} a protest, a statement, so, when we actually won, it was a real shock, a massive shock. After that, we started taking ourselves seriously." [...] The band quit their jobs, changed their name to Muse, and moved away from Teignmouth. The name [...] "Muse" [...] was supposedly inspired by Matthew Bellamy's art teacher Samuel Theoun. The band liked that it was short and thought that it looked good on a poster. According to journalist Mark Beaumont, the band wanted the name to reflect [...] "the sense Matt had that he had somehow 'summoned up' this band, the way mediums could <b>summon</b> <b>up</b> inspirational spirits at times of emotional need." ...|$|E

Magister [...] {{actually}} the Master [...] tries to assure her that her fears are unfounded, but his hypnosis fails to overcome her will. Backed by a group of followers, the Master is conducting ceremonies in the cavern below the Church to <b>summon</b> <b>up</b> a force of evil. The Doctor and Jo reach the mound and the Doctor rushes inside to stop the dig, but it is too late. The tomb door opens and icy gusts of wind rush out and the ground begins to shake, toppling the camera crew and even the coven in the catacombs. The Master laughs triumphantly and calls the entity's name [...] Azal, and the eyes of a gargoyle, Bok, flare with a reddish glow. Jo enters the mound to find Horner and the Doctor motionless, covered with frost.|$|E
2500|$|In Europe, {{it is the}} {{provision}} of accommodation, if anything, that now distinguishes inns from taverns, alehouses and pubs. The latter tend to provide alcohol (and, in the UK, soft drinks and often food), but less commonly accommodation. Inns tend to be older and grander establishments: historically they provided not only food and lodging, but also stabling and fodder for the traveller's horse(s) and on some roads fresh horses for the mail coach. Famous London inns include The George, Southwark and The Tabard. There is however no longer a formal distinction between an inn {{and other kinds of}} establishment. Many pubs use [...] "Inn" [...] in their name, either because they are long established former coaching inns, or to <b>summon</b> <b>up</b> a particular kind of image, or in many cases simply as a pun on the word [...] "in", as in [...] "The Welcome Inn", the name of many pubs in Scotland.|$|E
2500|$|The Spanish Civil war {{produced}} {{a spate of}} bad literature. Homage to Catalonia {{is one of the}} few exceptions and the reason is simple. Orwell was determined to set down the truth as he saw it. This was something that many writers of the Left in 1936–39 could not bring themselves to do. Orwell comes back time and time again in his writings on Spain to those political conditions in the late thirties which fostered intellectual dishonesty: the subservience of the intellectuals of the European Left to the Communist 'line', especially in the case of the Popular Front in Spain where, in his view, the party line could not conceivably be supported by an honest man. Only a few strong souls, Victor Serge and Orwell among them, could <b>summon</b> <b>up</b> the courage to fight the whole tone of the literary establishment and the influence of Communists within it. Arthur Koestler quoted to an audience of Communist sympathizers Thomas Mann's phrase, 'In the long run a harmful truth is better than a useful lie'. The non-Communists applauded; the Communists and their sympathizers remained icily silent ... It is precisely the immediacy of Orwell's reaction that gives the early sections of Homage its value for the historian. Kaminski, Borkenau, Koestler came with a fixed framework, the ready-made contacts of journalist intellectuals. Orwell came with his eyes alone.|$|E

2500|$|James Reston Jr., in the Saturday Review, calls Lane's book disreputable, in {{that all}} of the reports {{contained}} in it are admittedly unverified, and lean toward the salacious. [...] "Lane makes no pretense of distinguishing between fact and a soldier's talent for embellishment", Reston observed. Commenting on the book's redeeming social value, Reston added that [...] "it would be to show that a pattern of atrocities exists in Vietnam, proving that while My Lai was larger, it was not unique. This needs to be demonstrated, since the Pentagon continues to insist that My Lai was an isolated case. [...] But the effort will have to be left to more responsible parties, like the National Veterans Inquiry." [...] A review of Lane's book by Neil Sheehan in the New York Times Book Review claimed that four of the 32 servicemen interviewed by Lane for the book had misrepresented their military service, according to the Defense Department. Lane responded to Sheehan’s inquiries by stating that the Defense Department is the least reliable of all sources for verification of atrocity accounts and that verification of simple facts about the interviewees was “not relevant.” Sheehan called Lane's book irresponsible, concluding that, [...] "Some of the horror tales in this book are undoubtedly true", and the [...] "men who now run the military establishment cannot conduct a credible investigation... But until the country does <b>summon</b> <b>up</b> the courage to convene a responsible inquiry, we probably deserve the Mark Lanes." [...] Because of Sheehan's review, Simon and Schuster reneged on the contract for the book. When Lane disproved Sheehan's charges, they were forced to settle with him.|$|E
