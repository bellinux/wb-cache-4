The Chicago Tribune characterised Caleb as a [...] "gruff, uncompromising Newport Beach, Calif., real-estate developer". When asked by the Tribune about the character, Dale said, [...] ""The thing that's lovely about this character is that there's <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with him. His relationships are so complicated, and once the marriage happened, everyone was related in the show.

A {{direct and}} no-nonsense personality, Sue boasts {{she is the}} third {{most important person in}} the world, as she is the one who arranges for people to see Selina, the second most important person in the world.
