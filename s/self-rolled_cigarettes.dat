(VC) supplementation and exercise on oxidative stress biomarkers, beta-endorphin release, and the rate of cigarette smoking. Methods Volunteer smokers were randomly divided into four groups: group 1 : VC supplement; group 2 : exercise with VC supplement; group 3 : exercise; and group 4 : control. VC was prepared by wash and dry techniques and taken orally before smoking, matching the frequency of strenuous exercise (three times weekly). Before and after a two month period, exhaled carbon monoxide (CO), blood oxidative stress (malondialdehyde [MDA], nitric oxide [NOx], protein hydroperoxide [PrOOH] and total antioxidant capacity [TAC]), beta-endorphin and smoking rate were measured, and statistically analyzed. Results In Group 1, MDA, PrOOH, and NOx significantly decreased, whereas TAC increased (p 0. 05). In Group 3, MDA, PrOOH, NOx, TAC, and beta-endorphin levels increased significantly (p 0. 05). All groups had lower levels of CO after the intervention. The smoking rate for light cigarette decreased in group 2 (62. 7 %), 1 (59. 52 %), 3 (53. 57 %) and 4 (14. 04 %), whereas in <b>self-rolled</b> <b>cigarettes</b> it decreased in group 1 (54. 47 %), 3 (42. 30 %), 2 (40 %) and 4 (9. 2 %). Conclusion Supplementation with Vernonia cinerea Less and exercise provided benefit related to reduced smoking rate, which may be related to oxidaive stress and beta-endorphine levels. </p...|$|E

50|$|The {{main reason}} for the {{popularity}} is the price. A typical cigarette contains less than 1 gram of tobacco. A pouch of 40-42.5 grams {{is about the same}} price as a box of 19-20 cigarettes, so the cost of a <b>self-rolled</b> <b>cigarette</b> is half the price of a ready-made cigarette. Many people also put much less tobacco in a <b>self-rolled</b> <b>cigarette.</b> The taxes on tobacco, however, are mainly based on the weight of tobacco, so the margins for the producer are lower on shag than on ready-made cigarettes.|$|R
5000|$|Shag tobacco {{has always}} had a high market-share in the Dutch tobacco-market, {{although}} it is declining. In 1989 some 53% of the combined shag and cigarette market was for shag-tobacco while in 2010 it was about 42%. Smoking shag is cheaper than smoking ready-made cigarettes. The price of a standard pouch tobacco (originally 50 grams, now often 42.5 grams) is about the same as a packet of cigarettes. As the average <b>self-rolled</b> <b>cigarette</b> will contain less than one gram of tobacco often 50 or more [...] "shaggies" [...] are rolled from a pouch for nearly the same price as 19 or 20 ready-made cigarettes.|$|R
