5|$|By the 1850s, {{whether or}} not species evolved was a subject of intense debate, with {{prominent}} scientists arguing both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue.</b> The publication of Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species fundamentally transformed the discussion over biological origins. Darwin argued that his branching version of evolution explained a wealth of facts in biogeography, anatomy, embryology, and other fields of biology. He also provided the first cogent mechanism by which evolutionary change could persist: his theory of natural selection.|$|E
5|$|During the {{petition}} drive, groups supporting Morse accused the firm collecting the signatures of hiring convicted felons and gathering personal information. Recall backers said that Morse's group was misleading the public. In addition, the recall drives brought in support from national groups on both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue.</b> The National Rifle Association (NRA) supported the recall effort with mailers and donations. National groups opposing the recall included America Votes, {{believed to be}} financially supported by New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, as well as California billionaire Eli Broad.|$|E
5|$|At a May Day rally, held on Sunday 6 May in Eastville, local Trades Council members {{publicly}} criticised the TGWU. On {{the same}} day Paul Stephenson had organised a demonstration march to St Mary Redcliffe church, {{but there was a}} poor turnout. Some local West Indians said they should not ripple the water and, according to Roy Hackett, they may have feared victimisation. The dispute led to what has been described as one of the largest mailbags that the Bristol Evening Post had ever received, with contributors writing in support of both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue.</b>|$|E

5|$|Clay {{believed}} the Democrats would again nominate Martin Van Buren, who was ardently opposed to annexation, {{and this would}} keep annexation from becoming {{an issue in the}} campaign. Clay was nominated by acclamation at the Whig convention in Baltimore a week later. At the Democratic nominating convention a month later, however, Van Buren was unable to secure his party's nomination, and the Democrats instead nominated James K. Polk, who strongly favored annexation. Clay tried to moderate his views on annexation, but his changes of position drew opposition from supporters of both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> as he attempted to find a middle ground. Polk {{went on to win the}} election in a close race. This was the last time Clay would be nominated for president, and many Whigs believed that, following Clay's defeat, Crittenden was the new leader of their party.|$|E

50|$|Another {{factor in}} {{inferring}} a disposition from an action is whether <b>the</b> behaviour <b>of</b> <b>the</b> actor is constrained by situational forces {{or whether it}} occurs from the actor's choice. If a student were assigned to argue a position in a classroom debate (e.g. for or against Neoliberalism), it would be unwise of their audience to infer that their statements in the debate reflect their true beliefs - {{because they did not}} choose to argue that particular <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue.</b> If, however, they had chosen to argue one <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue,</b> then it would be appropriate for the audience to conclude that their statements reflect their true beliefs.|$|R

25|$|After the Catholic League {{protested the}} comic and then MSU {{president}} M. Peter McPherson declared {{he wanted it}} banned, the comic strip was removed for being too controversial.

25|$|The {{language}} used by Jackson, {{combined with the}} reports coming out of South Carolina, raised the spectre of military confrontation for many on both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue.</b> A group of Democrats, led by Van Buren and Thomas Hart Benton among others, saw the only solution to the crisis in a substantial reduction of the tariff.|$|E
25|$|Moderns {{may be able}} to {{see both}} <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue,</b> however, as an {{historian}} might. Indeed, there exists a great difference in context between, say, an American, and a German historian of the 1850s, where during 1848 citizens had made a rather spontaneous, incoherent effort to move German politics toward a free and unified country: it was crushed by the nobility.|$|E

2500|$|As Davis {{left office}} in 2003, the San Francisco Chronicle {{published}} an editorial discussing his legacy. The newspaper {{claimed that he}} lacked vision, allowed the legislature and its policies to define his tenure and had a [...] "robotic governing style" [...] that focused on fundraising instead <b>of</b> personal relationships. <b>The</b> Chronicle commented that Davis was often on <b>the</b> right <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>issues</b> but that being on <b>the</b> right <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>issues</b> alienated <b>the</b> electorate. Davis lacked charisma {{and seemed to be}} more passionate about winning campaigns than governing. Davis never showed emotion to the voters. He spent much of his campaign time talking about his accomplishments instead of providing voters with a vision.|$|R

25|$|Previous federal {{case law}} {{pertaining}} {{to the question of}} an individual's right to bear arms included United States v.

Miller, 307 U.S. 174 (1939) was interpreted to support both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue.</b>|$|E
25|$|Some {{priests in}} some parishes (six out of 80) bless {{permanent}} faithful relationships. Permission is {{granted by the}} bishop only when a priest requests it, and a parish has decided by majority vote, {{that they want to}} be a place of blessing. Ingham says of the practice: I insist only that those on all <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> respect one another and that everyone should maintain the order of the church. Our goal in the Anglican Church in the Greater Vancouver area is to be a church that accommodates differences.|$|E
25|$|Writers in the Latter Day Saint {{movement}} {{have taken}} positions on both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> of whether Kolob {{is a star}} or a planet. Brigham Young, second president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), spoke of Kolob as a planet. Likewise, LDS Church apostles John Taylor, Orson Pratt (a mathematician {{with an interest in}} astronomy), Orson F. Whitney, and Alvin R. Dyer referred to Kolob as a planet. Other Mormon theologians have also viewed Kolob as a planet. Several other Mormon writers have referred to Kolob as a star, including B. H. Roberts and LDS Church president David O. McKay.|$|E

25|$|In 1875, Nelson {{introduced}} a bill – the Upper Country bill – that gave SP added incentives {{in the form of}} land to complete the line, but also imposed a deadline after which the rights to build the railroad were forfeited, presumably in favor of Northern Pacific, whose plans would bypass Alexandria. The bill met with controversy from both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> and was ultimately amended to the point that Nelson first sought to table it, and then abstained from voting on it. The bill was enacted and was considered a success in its time, with most of the credit going to Nelson.|$|E
25|$|The school's mascot is an Indian. In 2004, {{there was}} a major {{controversy}} at the school about the appropriateness of the mascot. The school took up the issue after researching high schools and colleges around the U.S. with similar nicknames that had decided to change their mascots. Many of these schools had received complaints from Native American groups about the stereotypes that the mascots reinforced. The student council also discussed rumors that New Jersey would be banning Native American-related mascots, and eventually it was decided that taking up the issue by choice rather than force {{was the right thing to}} do. After months of public debate and an official symposium in which students voiced opinions from both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue,</b> a vote was held among the students and faculty and the motion to keep the Indian was affirmed, 67% voting in favor of keeping the mascot.|$|E
500|$|As environmentalists {{pressed the}} BLM to close {{much of the}} Trout Creek Mountains to grazing, {{frustrated}} ranchers joined the Sagebrush Rebellion seeking to protect their grazing allotments.

[...] However, in 1988, interest groups representing all <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> joined to form the Trout Creek Mountain Working Group. [...] The group's goal was to find a solution acceptable to everyone—a plan that would protect both the land's ecological health and ranchers' economic needs.|$|E
50|$|On another <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> James D.

500|$|One of {{the most}} {{influential}} and well-known pro-UN organizations, UNA-USA has been on both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue.</b> In 2003, UNA-USA's executive director of policy studies, Jeffrey Laurenti, wrote an article, An Idea Whose Time Has Not Come, arguing that there were important unresolved issues of inclusivity, authority, and efficiency with the UNPA. UNA's position seemed to reverse in November 2006, when the 38th plenary session of the World Federation of United Nations Associations issued a resolution stating that it [...] "Supports the establishment of a United Nations parliamentary Assembly as a consultative body within the United Nations system as a voice of the citizens; Calls upon the governments of the United Nations member states, parliamentarians and civil society representatives to jointly examine possible steps and options to create a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly." ...|$|E
500|$|In addition, McKenna {{reasons that}} [...] "all things" [...] is heavily {{influenced}} by feminist philosophy and epistemology, schools of thought that try to criticize or re-evaluate the ideas of traditional philosophy and epistemology from within a feminist framework. According to McKenna, feminism rejects dualistic ways of thinking, especially [...] "typical male/female dualism". Feminist philosophy, instead, calls for a pluralistic way of thinking, noting {{that there are many}} consistent sets of truths about the world. In the episode, Scully starts out [...] "sure of her more rational scientific view and approach". As the episode progresses, however, she decides to branch out. Eventually, she brings in a spirit healer to [...] "corroborate or nullify the new beliefs she is encountering".

500|$|Early Restoration Movement leaders {{varied in}} {{their views of}} slavery, {{reflecting}} the range of positions common in the antebellum U.S. [...] Barton W.

[...] Alexander Campbell represented a more [...] "Jeffersonian" [...] opposition to slavery, writing of it as more of a political problem than as a religious or moral one. [...] Having seen Methodists and Baptists divide over the issue of slavery, Campbell argued that scripture regulated slavery rather than prohibited it, and that abolition {{should not be allowed to}} become an issue over which Christians would break fellowship with each other. [...] Like the country as a whole, the assumption of white racial superiority was almost universal among those on all <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue,</b> and it was common for congregations to have separate seating for black members.|$|E
