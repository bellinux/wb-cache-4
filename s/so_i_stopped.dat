500|$|Having {{no one to}} talk {{to about}} the issues that were {{consuming}} her, she decided to read as much as she could on the topic. She found very little, and much of what she found described homosexuals as [...] "deviants", [...] "perverts", and [...] "abnormal" [...] in medical books and texts on abnormal psychology, or odd generalizations that stated homosexuals were unable to whistle, or that their favorite color was green. She found all the information focused on homosexual men. [...] She recalled in a 2001 interview, [...] "I thought, this is not about me. There is nothing here about love or happiness. There has to be something better". Her research took up so much of her time at Northwestern that she ended up failing out of the school. Gittings found a purpose during this time, saying, [...] "My mission was not to get a general education but to find out about myself and what my life would be like. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>stopped</b> going to classes and started going to the library. There were no organizations to turn to in those days only libraries were safe, although the information contained was dismal." ...|$|E
2500|$|He stopped wearing {{virtually}} all his gold, {{one of his}} identifying marks, after helping with the cleanup after Hurricane Katrina in 2005. He said, [...] "As a Christian, when I saw other people lose their lives and lose their land and property ... I felt {{that it would be}} a sin before God for me to continue wearing my gold. I felt it would be insensitive and disrespectful to the people who lost everything, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>stopped</b> wearing my gold." ...|$|E
2500|$|Recording {{sessions}} for the album {{took place at}} Doppler Studios in Atlanta, Georgia, No Excuses Studio in Santa Monica, California, Record Plant in Hollywood, California, and Setai Recording Studios in Miami, Florida. Polow da Don served as the album's executive producer and produced or co-produced all of its songs, managing sessions with background singers and horn and string sections. In an interview for Billboard, {{he said of his}} role on the album, [...] "I promised [...] my full dedication. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>stopped</b> doing a lot of work {{with a lot of other}} artists. I usually have seven songs on the radio at the same time, but I shut down shop to focus on his album". Lloyd has said of the album's music, [...] "We've created something in the likes of what Justin Timberlake and Timbaland were able to create [...] and Usher and Jermaine Dupri were able to create [...] ".|$|E
60|$|Do {{you think}} I have an empty life? {{or that a}} man jogging to his club has so much to {{interest}} and amuse him?--touch and try him too, but {{that goes along with}} the others: no pain, no pleasure, is the iron law. <b>So</b> here <b>I</b> <b>stop</b> again, and leave, as I left yesterday, my political business untouched. And lo! here comes my pupil, <b>I</b> believe, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>stop</b> in time.|$|R

2500|$|In 2004 Michael said [...] "I used {{to sleep}} with women quite {{a lot in the}} Wham! days but never felt it could develop into a {{relationship}} because I knew that, emotionally, I was a gay man. I didn't want to commit to them but I was attracted to them. Then I became ashamed that I might be using them. I decided I had to stop, which I did when I began to worry about AIDS, which was becoming prevalent in Britain. Although I had always had safe sex, I didn't want {{to sleep with}} a woman without telling her I was bisexual. I felt that would be irresponsible. Basically, I didn't want to have that uncomfortable conversation that might ruin the moment, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>stopped</b> sleeping with them." [...] In the same interview, he added : [...] "If I wasn't with Kenny , I would have sex with women, no question". He said he believed that the formation of his sexuality was [...] "a nurture thing, via the absence of my father who was always busy working. It meant I was exceptionally close to my mother", though he stated that [...] "there are definitely those who have a predisposition to being gay in which the environment is irrelevant." ...|$|E

60|$|I floated on, and I {{would have}} floated past the Inn, and perhaps {{have gotten into}} the Land of Never-Come-Back-Again, only I caught at the branch of an apple-tree, and <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>stopped</b> myself, though the apple-blossoms came falling down like pink and white snowflakes.|$|E
6000|$|On our {{way home}} {{we passed through}} a country town, of which I forget the name, {{and the sight of}} a gunsmith's shop there {{reminded}} me that I had no cartridges. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>stopped</b> to order some, as, fortunately, Lord Ragnall had mentioned that the guns he was going to lend me were twelve-bores. The tradesman asked me how many cartridges I wanted, and when I replied [...] "a hundred," [...] stared at me and said: ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You shall {{judge for}} yourself. I was coming through this field when I saw you {{gathering}} hemlock. Hemlock is interesting {{on account of}} Socrates, and you were interesting as a young lady gathering poison. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>stopped</b> to look on. Presently you came out from among the bushes {{as if you had}} seen a snake there. Then you fell into my arms--which led me to suppose that you had fainted--and Max, concluding that it was all my fault, nearly sprang at my throat. You were overpowered by the scent of the water-hemlock, which you must have been inhaling for ten minutes or more." ...|$|E
60|$|When he had gone, Fred and {{his father}} made a great fuss of me. I couldn't {{understand}} it. Men are so odd. The man wasn't a bit pleased that I had brought him and Fred together, but Fred seemed as if he couldn't do enough for me for having {{introduced him to the}} man. However, Fred's father produced some cold ham--my favourite dish--and gave me quite a lot of it, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>stopped</b> worrying over the thing. As mother used to say, 'Don't bother your head about what doesn't concern you. The only thing a dog need concern himself with is the bill-of-fare. Eat your bun, and don't make yourself busy about other people's affairs.' Mother's was in some ways a narrow outlook, but she had a great fund of sterling common sense.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, she didn't--really she didn't. All {{she said}} {{might just as}} well have been about most of those other places. I hadn't any real idea what it looked like. But just as soon as I saw it I felt it was home. Oh, it seems as if I must be in a dream. Do you know, my arm must be black and blue from the elbow up, for I've pinched myself so many times today. Every little while a horrible sickening feeling would come over me and I'd be so afraid it was all a dream. Then I'd pinch myself {{to see if it was}} real--until {{suddenly}} I remembered that even supposing it was only a dream I'd better go on dreaming as long as I could; <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>stopped</b> pinching. But it IS real and we're nearly home." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You see, Grandpa lives {{among his}} books, and doesn't mind much what happens outside. Mr. Brooke, my tutor, doesn't stay here, you know, and I {{have no one}} to go about with me, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> just <b>stop</b> at home and get on as I can." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have tried}} once or twice, but she either evaded my {{questions}} or looked <b>so</b> distressed that <b>I</b> <b>stopped.</b> <b>I</b> never force my children's confidence, and I seldom {{have to wait}} for long." ...|$|R

60|$|I am not {{a nervous}} man in a general way, and very little troubled with superstitions, of which I have lived to see the folly; but I am free to own that this sight quite upset me, and {{had it not been}} that Sir Henry caught me by the collar and held me, I do {{honestly}} believe that in another five minutes I should have been outside the stalactite cave, and that a promise of all the diamonds in Kimberley would not have induced me to enter it again. But he held me tight, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>stopped</b> because I could not help myself. Next second, however, his eyes became accustomed to the light, and he let go of me, and began to mop the perspiration off his forehead. As for Good, he swore feebly, while Foulata threw her arms round his neck and shrieked.|$|E
6000|$|I {{know not}} what it was, but {{something}} shocked my mind at that thought, and I durst not speak the words, [...] "How canst thou be such an hypocrite," [...] said I, even audibly, [...] "to pretend {{to be thankful for}} a condition, which, however thou mayst endeavour to be contented with, thou wouldst rather pray heartily to be delivered from?" [...] <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>stopped</b> there; but though I could not say I thanked God for being there, yet I sincerely gave thanks to God for opening my eyes, by whatever afflicting providences, to see the former condition, of my life, and to mourn for my wickedness, and repent. I never opened the Bible, or shut it, but my very soul within me blessed God for directing my friend in England, without any order of mine, to pack it up among my goods; and for assisting me afterwards to save it out of the wreck of the ship.|$|E

I say to you, Brice," [...] he went on earnestly, [...] "the {{importance}} of plain talk can't be overestimated. Any thought, however abstruse, can be put in speech that {{a boy or a}} negro can grasp. Any book, however deep, can be written in terms that everybody can comprehend, if a man only tries hard enough. When I was a boy I used to hear the neighbors talking, and it bothered me so because I could not understand them that I used to sit up half the night thinking things out for myself. I remember that I did not know what the word demonstrate meant. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>stopped</b> my studies then and there and got a volume of Euclid. Before I got through I could demonstrate everything in it, and I have never been bothered with demonstrate since." ...|$|E

5000|$|She grew up reading Nancy Drew books, and as {{she grew}} older, Stephen King and Patricia Cornwell. [...] "I love King and Cornwell because their books go above and beyond scary.

6000|$|So here I was, a meek and studious milk-drinking hobo, {{and behold}} what I got for it. One {{afternoon}} I {{arrived at the}} park, a fresh book-purchase under my arm and a tremendous buttermilk thirst under my shirt. In {{the middle of the}} street, in front of the City Hall, I noticed, as I came along heading for the buttermilk booth, that a crowd had formed. It was right where I was crossing the street, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>stopped</b> to see the cause of the collection of curious men. At first I could see nothing. Then, from the sounds I heard and from a glimpse I caught, I knew that it was a bunch of gamins playing pee-wee. Now pee-wee is not permitted in the streets of New York. I didn't know that, but I learned pretty lively. I had paused possibly thirty seconds, in which time I had learned the cause of the crowd, when I heard a gamin yell [...] "Bull!" [...] The gamins knew their business. They ran. I didn't.|$|E
60|$|From {{this moment}} I began to {{conclude}} {{in my mind}} that it was possible for me to be more happy in this forsaken, solitary condition than it was probable I should ever have been in any other particular state in the world; and with this thought I was going to give thanks to God for bringing me to this place. I know not what it was, but something shocked my mind at that thought, and I durst not speak the words. “How canst thou become such a hypocrite,” said I, even audibly, “to pretend to be thankful for a condition which, however thou mayest endeavour to be contented with, thou wouldst rather pray heartily to be delivered from?” <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>stopped</b> there; but though I could not say I thanked God for being there, yet I sincerely gave thanks to God for opening my eyes, by whatever afflicting providences, to see the former condition of my life, and to mourn for my wickedness, and repent. I never opened the Bible, or shut it, but my very soul within me blessed God for directing my friend in England, without any order of mine, to pack it up among my goods, and for assisting me afterwards to save it out of the wreck of the ship.|$|E
60|$|It rained {{very hard}} all the day. I was {{thoroughly}} soaked, and by noon {{a good deal}} tired, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>stopped</b> at a poor inn, where I stayed all night, beginning now to wish that I had never left home. I cut so miserable a figure, too, that I found, by the questions asked me, I was suspected to be some runaway servant and {{in danger of being}} taken up on that suspicion. However, I proceeded the next day, and got in the evening to an inn, within eight or ten miles of Burlington, kept by one Dr. Brown. He entered into conversation with me while I took some refreshment, and, finding I had read a little, became very sociable and friendly. Our acquaintance continued as long as he lived.[n] He had been, I imagine, an itinerant doctor; for there was no town in England, or country in Europe, of which he could not give a very particular account. He had some letters,[41] and was ingenious, but much of an unbeliever, and wickedly undertook, some years after, to travesty the Bible in doggerel verse, as Cotton had done Virgil. By this means he set many of the facts in a very ridiculous light, and might have hurt weak minds if his work had been published; but it never was.|$|E
6000|$|... "If <b>so</b> <b>I</b> shall <b>stop</b> where <b>I</b> am," [...] I {{answered}} coolly, [...] "in {{the shadow}} of the King, your father. Moreover, are you so lost in folly, Cetewayo, that you should wish to bring the English about your ears? Know that if I am killed you will be asked to give account of my blood." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, you {{imprudent}} fellow; and {{you were}} telling Mrs. Pugh <b>so,</b> if <b>I</b> hadn't <b>stopped</b> you,' said Tom. 'You'll be taken up for an accomplice next, if you don't hold your tongue.' ...|$|R
60|$|I went up {{the bank}} about fifty yards, and then I doubled on my tracks and slipped back to where my canoe was, a good piece below the house. I jumped in, and was off in a hurry. I went up-stream far {{enough to make the}} head of the island, and then started across. I took off the sun-bonnet, for I didn't want no {{blinders}} on then. When I was about the middle I heard the clock begin to strike, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>stops</b> and listens; the sound come faint over the water but clear--eleven. When I struck the head of the island I never waited to blow, though I was most winded, but I shoved right into the timber where my old camp used to be, and started a good fire there on a high and dry spot.|$|R
