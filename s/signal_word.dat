The main concern is whether explicit teaching of <b>signal</b> <b>words</b> facilitates reading comprehension.

40|$|ABSTRACT This {{experimental}} study aims {{to investigate the}} effect of different task variance that involves Providing Topic Sentence and Providing <b>Signal</b> <b>Words</b> as independent variables on student’s writing proficiency which covers complexity and coherence as dependent variables. Two groups {{of the first year}} students of English Department at Jambi University in Indonesia were selected as participants in this study. Each group consists of 30 students. Group I was required to perform the writing task that is provided topic sentence (PTS). Group II was required to perform the writing task that is provided <b>signal</b> <b>words</b> (PSW). The results of the test were rated or scored by using analytical and holistic rating systems. The data were analyzed statistically by using Independent Sample T – Test and Correlation. The findings of the study showed that on average, Group I has higher level of effect on student’s writing proficiency (M = 72. 57, SE = 1. 81) than the effect of Group II on student’s writing proficiency (M = 56. 50, SE = 2. 16). This difference is significant (t (58) = 5. 70; p < 0. 05). Furthermore, the interactions among the components of complexity have strong correlation. Then, positive relationships among the components of coherence are also statistically proved. Therefore, the null hypothesis which says that there is no effect of different task variance that involves Providing Topic Sentence and Providing <b>Signal</b> <b>Words</b> on student’s writing proficiency which covers complexity and coherence can be rejected. Based on these findings we conclude that Providing Topic Sentence helps students much better to develop paragraph writing than Providing <b>Signal</b> <b>Words.</b> ...|$|R

Each of these signal words is usually printed in a color (e. g., white on a dark background) in order to potentially increase saliency or aesthetics. Hence, there is a potentially significant interaction of <b>signal</b> <b>word,</b> color, and product type on perceived hazard. Warning labels for muriatic acid, Xtra-Clean All Purpose Cleaner, and Crayola Crayons were factorially combined with <b>signal</b> <b>word</b> (DEADLY, DANGER, WARNING, CAUTION, and NOTE) and color of <b>signal</b> <b>word</b> (orange, blue, red, black) {{for a total of}} 60 conditions.

40|$|NPIC {{fact sheets}} are {{designed}} to answer questions that are commonly asked {{by the general public}} about pesticides that are regulated by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA). This document is intended to be educational in nature and helpful to consumers for making decisions about pesticide use. What are Signal Words? Signal words are found on pesticide product labels, and they describe the acute (short-term) toxicity of the formulated pesticide product. The <b>signal</b> <b>word</b> can be either: DANGER, WARNING or CAUTION. Products with the DANGER <b>signal</b> <b>word</b> are the most toxic. Products with the <b>signal</b> <b>word</b> CAUTION are lower in toxicity. 1 The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requires a <b>signal</b> <b>word</b> on most pesticide product labels. They also require it to be printed on the front panel, in all capital letters, to make it easy for users to find. The only pesticide products that are not required to display a <b>signal</b> <b>word</b> are those that fall into the lowest toxicity category by all routes of exposure (oral, dermal, inhalation, and other effects like eye and skin irritation). 2, 3 See the table below titled “Toxicity Category. ” CAUTION means the pesticide product is slightly toxic if eaten, absorbed through the skin, inhaled, or it causes slight eye or skin irritation. 2, 4 WARNING indicates the pesticide product is moderately toxic if eaten, absorbed through the skin, inhaled, or it causes moderate eye or skin irritation. 2, 4 DANGER means that the pesticide product is highly toxic by at least one route of exposure. It may be corrosive, causing irreversible damage to the skin or eyes. Alternatively, it may be highly toxic if eaten, absorbed through the skin, or inhaled. If this is the case, then the word “POISON ” must also be included in red letters on the front panel of the product label. 2,...|$|E
