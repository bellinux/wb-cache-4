40|$|In Hong Kong, young singles {{are left}} out of the {{affordable}} housing equation. They require much more space per person in comparison to those living in family housing, and the government is not willing to allocate a disproportionate amount of already limited public resources to house this demographic. Many young singles end up living in cramped conditions with their parents well into their 30 s, lacking space and autonomy throughout their golden years. Conditions for elderly singles are more dire - with no family to look after them, many live in Hong Kong's notorious cage homes, <b>stacked</b> <b>bed</b> spaces within already tiny apartments in the city's poorer districts. CASH transcends this housing deadlock by providing a new approach towards affordable housing - proactive affordability - for Hong Kong's singles population. The architecture acts as a platform that maximizes opportunities for tenants to generate extra revenue, allowing them to afford their own spaces. This is achieved by re-organizing private and communal space {{in such a way that}} allows for subletting and commercial activity to coincide with the residential space. The building positions itself to generate foot traffic, creating greater opportunities for its tenants. In doing so, the residents of CASH can live larger, dream bigger and work harder, on their own terms and within their own communities. by Yan-Ping Wang. Thesis (M. Arch.)

40|$|To more {{accurately}} predict the temperature distribution inside the reactor core of pebble bed type high temperature reactors, {{in this thesis}} we investigated the stochastic properties of randomly <b>stacked</b> <b>beds</b> {{and the effects of}} the non-homogeneity of these beds on the neutronics and thermal-hydraulics in the core of pebble bed reactors. To investigate the stacking properties of randomly <b>stacked</b> <b>beds,</b> we measured the average packing fraction and the radial and axial packing fraction profiles of a bed containing 5400 pebbles. In a second experiment, three-dimensional X-ray tomography was used to determined the pebble locations of a bed containing 8900 pebbles. Results were used to validate a computational method to generate pebble bed stackings based on the removal of overlaps. Different stacking properties were found near the wall than in the bulk of the <b>bed,</b> indicating the <b>stacking</b> is anisotropic here, forming ordered layers parallel to the wall with hexagonal-like stacking properties. This results in strong fluctuations in the radial packing fraction close to the wall, and a significantly higher porosity next to the wall than {{in the rest of the}} bed, rising to unity at the wall. As a result, the average porosity of randomly <b>stacked</b> <b>beds</b> depends on their volume to surface ratio, with larger beds having a lower average void fraction than smaller bed. We also found strong variations in the local porosity throughout the pebble bed, resulting in small clusters of densely packed pebbles. To investigated the effect of the non-homogeneity of pebble bed on neutron transport, we compared k_eff calculations for a model with uniform porosity, a zones model including density fluctuations, and an exact model with all pebbles modelled individually. Calculations were performed for an infinite cylinder and for a model of the PROTEUS facility. For the infinite cylinder we found a 71 pcm higher k_eff for the zones model than for the uniform porosity model, showing the effect of density fluctuations at the wall to be very small. However, the same comparison for PROTEUS showed an increase of 649 pcm due to the low packing fraction near the top of the pebble bed, resulting in a much lower average packing fraction in the uniform porosity model. The effect of neutron streaming through the void space in between the pebbles was calculated by comparing the zones model with the exact model, and was found to decrease k_eff by 606 pcm for the infinite cylinder, and by 1240 pcm for PROTEUS, showing neutron streaming is an important effect in small pebble bed reactors. Changing the Dancoff factor in the outer part of the pebble bed to compensate for the lower probability of neutrons to enter other fuel pebbles caused no significant changes in k_eff. ...|$|R

Despite mild meta-morphic overprinting, there is excellent preservation of sedimentary structures. The thick formation (4. 8 km) has been previously inter-preted as a shallow-water, intracratonic basin deposit. Five distinct facies are recognized. Two quartz arenite facies are dominated by dune (meter-scale) cross-bedding recording westward flow, but distinguished by different large-scale geometries: (1) thick, tabular bodies (10 – 20 m thick by 6001 m long) and (2) channeled beds (0. 3 – 0. 3 m thick by hundreds to thousands of meters long).

These fibers were then processed into fibrous membrane beds by wet-laid technique. Dynamic adsorption of lead (Pb 2 +) was subsequently {{carried out by}} pumping the feed solution through the bed in a single-pass flow mode. The influence of various parameters including flow rate, bed height and <b>bed</b> <b>stacking</b> pattern on <b>bed</b> breakthrough behavior was investigated. It {{was found that the}} in situ-TiO 2 /CF bed outperformed others; its loading capacity of Pb 2 + was 13 times that of pure CF bed, and 9 times that of the self-assembled TiO 2 /cellulose bed prior to 10 % breakthrough. The dynamic adsorption behavior of the in situ-TiO 2 /CF bed was better predicted by Dose Response model among other models tested. The bed was also selective for Pb 2 + over Ca 2 +, and was readily regenerable when eluted with 0. 1 M HCl solution for repeated use. The outstanding performance of the in situ-TiO 2 /CF bed was a result of larger fiber adsorption capacity and faster adsorption kinetics compared with the other beds having similar geometric bed structure.

40|$|Pyroclastic density {{currents}} (PDCs) generated during the Plinian eruption of the Pomici di Avellino (PdA) of Somma-Vesuvius were investigated through field and laboratory studies, which allowed the detailed reconstruction of their eruptive and transportation dynamics and {{the calculation of}} key physical parameters of the currents. PDCs were generated during all the three phases that characterised the eruption, with eruptive dynamics driven by both magmatic and phreatomagmatic fragmentation. Flows generated during phases 1 and 2 (EU 1 and EU 3 pf, magmatic fragmentation) have small dispersal areas and affected {{only part of the}} volcano slopes. Lithofacies analysis demonstrates that the flow-boundary zones were dominated by granular-flow regimes, which sometimes show transitions to traction regimes. PDCs generated during eruptive phase 3 (EU 5, phreatomagmatic fragmentation) were the most voluminous and widespread in the whole of Somma-Vesuvius' eruptive history, and affected a wide area around the volcano with deposit thicknesses of a few centimetres up to more than 25 km from source. Lithofacies analysis shows that the flow-boundary zones of EU 5 PDCs were dominated by granular flows and traction regimes. Deposits of EU 5 PDC show strong lithofacies variation northwards, from proximally thick, massive to stratified beds towards dominantly alternating beds of coarse and fine ash in distal reaches. The EU 5 lithofacies also show strong lateral variability in proximal areas, passing from the western and northern to the eastern and southern volcano slopes, where the deposits are <b>stacked</b> <b>beds</b> of massive, accretionary lapilli-bearing fine ash. The sedimentological model developed for the PDCs of the PdA eruption explains these strong lithofacies variations {{in the light of the}} volcano's morphology at the time of the eruption. In particular, the EU 5 PDCs survived to pass over the break in slope between the volcano sides and the surrounding volcaniclastic apron-alluvial plain, with development of new flows from the previously suspended load. Pulses were developed within individual currents, leading to stepwise deposition on both the volcano slopes and the surrounding volcaniclastic apron and alluvial plain. Physical parameters including velocity, density and concentration profile with height were calculated for a flow of the phreatomagmatic phase of the eruption by applying a sedimentological method, and the values of the dynamic pressure were derived. Some hazard considerations are summarised on the assumption that, although not very probable, similar PDCs could develop during future eruptions of Somma-Vesuvius...|$|R
40|$|Understanding of {{the local}} lateral {{heterogeneity}} within the Eagle Ford Group, a prolific mudstone reservoir on the Texas Gulf Coast, is hindered {{by a lack of}} well-preserved outcrops in close proximity to one another. Misinformation or over simplistic assumptions about relevant horizontal reservoir heterogeneities can lead to sub-optimal or uneconomical exploitation. High-resolution correlation of individual beds in the Eagle Ford Group over several miles in Lozier Canyon and Antonio Creek in Terrell County, West Texas, was used to document lateral variation in thickness, composition, sedimentary structures, and gamma ray response of these strata on a local scale. Physical tracing of the beds on outcrops and within Gigapan photomosaics, hand-held spectral gamma-ray scintillometer profiles, and examination of polished hand samples and thin sections were used to correlate Eagle Ford Group strata across Lozier Canyon and Antonio Creek. The results add value by increasing the understanding of local horizontal heterogeneities and the depositional environments of Eagle Ford Group strata and potentially influencing how and where wells are drilled and completed. Five distinct lithostratigraphic units, termed A-E from the base up, and their subunits, are laterally continuous over several miles in terms of thickness, lithology, and spectral gamma ray response. However, there are notable differences in thickness and sedimentary structures in units A and B. Unit A has the largest difference in thickness (7 %), suggesting higher accommodation in the southeast part of the study area. Moreover, sedimentary structures and bed morphology of skeletal packstone beds in unit B, the primary target of horizontal wells in the subsurface, vary over a 4 -mi interval from discontinuous lenses to laterally continuous <b>stacked</b> <b>beds.</b> Simulated wireline logs obtained from outcrop exposures suggest that spectral gamma ray data is superior to total gamma ray data in correctly identifying the most desirable sub units for completion. Geochemical data and trace fossil abundance suggest primarily anoxic bottom water conditions during deposition of the Lower Eagle Ford Formation and oxic conditions during deposition of the Upper Eagle Ford Formation. Widespread zones of deformed bedding within the Eagle Ford Group strata typify certain units and were likely caused by paleoseismicity. Laterally extensive bedding plane exposures in Antonio Creek provide three-dimensional views of macrofossils and the bedform morphology that were previously only described from two-dimensional outcrops. Sedimentary structures suggest that units A, C, D, and E were deposited above storm wave base; and deposition of unit B was episodically above storm wave base...|$|R

40|$|The {{processes}} {{leading to}} successful versus failed coalescence of similar magma batches upon their emplacement are investigated at Elba Island (Tuscany), where several magma bodies were generated {{at a single}} magmatic center over a time span of similar to 1 Ma during the Late Miocene. Three nested Christmas-tree laccoliths made up of separated, shallow-level felsic sheets were emplaced at 2 - 3 km depth with associated roof uplift. Then, at a deeper level, a granite pluton was constructed over a short time span by three magma pulses stacked downward as subhorizontal intrusive sheets, with space for magma generated mostly by roof uplift and tectonic-gravitational displacement of the overburden. Length-to-thickness relationships for individual laccolith layers, {{as well as for}} pluton sheets, show a power-law correlation interpreted as the frozen evidence for the occurrence of a vertical inflation stage during intrusion growth. We infer that laccolith sheets failed to coalesce and form a larger pluton because their magma driving pressure exceeded the lithostatic load in a crustal section rich in subhorizontal magma traps (a thrust <b>stack</b> of <b>bedded</b> rocks). However, the driving pressure of the first magma batch of the Monte Capanne pluton was presumably enhanced by an increased magma supply rate, so that the driving pressure exceeded the load at the level of a deeper magma trap represented by a major thrust fault. The following magma batches arrived in rapid succession and were not able to penetrate the still mushy tabular mass. Thus the laccolith sheets and the sheeted pluton represent different outcomes of similar processes occurring under slightly different conditions...|$|R
40|$|Calcite cement derived intraformationally {{in seven}} stratigraphic units of marine origin (five submarine-fan {{deposits}} and two shelf deposits) is distributed heterogeneously at the outcrop scale. Sandstone beds intercalated with calcareous shale older than Pliocene {{tend to be}} completely cemented, whereas <b>stacked</b> sandstone <b>beds</b> that lack shale interbeds have calcite cement {{in the form of}} tightly cemented concretions that make up only 10 - 30 % of a bed. The abundance and distribution of concretions, with few exceptions, are irregular and unpredictable. Concretion shapes include spheres (< 1 m diameter), oblate and prolate spheroids (< 1. 5 m), tabular forms (to 8 m long), and irregular forms. Patterns of concretions within beds are remarkably varied and include both random and uniform spacing; preference for either the top, middle, or bottom of beds; preference for faults that cut bedding at a high angle; and localization around shale rip-up clasts. There is no preference of concretions for shell-rich layers. Some formations have cement patterns specific to that formation, whereas other formations have different patterns at different outcrops. Most formations have more than one cement pattern in an outcrop. The lack of strong textural (grain size, graded bedding) or compositional controls on the localization of calcite cement suggests the preeminence of highly localized hydrologic factors in determining the spatial distribution of authigenic pore-filling calcite. Spherical concretions grew by diffusive supply of intraformationally derived components, whereas prolate and elongate concretions grew chiefly under the influence of advective supply. Faults apparently served as fluid conduits and were selectively cemented. In general, only sandstones intercalated with shale are totally cemented.

40|$|Extensive {{exposures}} {{through the}} glacial landforms around southern Lake Pukaki, New Zealand, comprise seven lithofacies (LFs 1 – 7). LFs 1 – 3 are grouped together as LFA 1 (Pukaki Member) and record pulsed subaqueous grounding line fan progradation, cohesionless debris flows, underflow activity and rhythmite deposition by suspension settling, iceberg rafting of dropstones, and pulsed traction current activity. Localized disturbance of these deposits by glacitectonic deformation and multi-generational hydrofracture fills records minor readvances by the glacier snout and the emplacement of a glacitectonite (LF 4) derived from cannibalization of glacilacustrine sediments. LFs 4 – 6 are grouped together as LFA 2 (Twizel Member) and record direct glacigenic deposition of glacitectonite (LF 4), subglacial traction till (LF 5) and supraglacially dumped boulder rubble (LF 6). Stratigraphic relationships between LFA 1 with LFA 2 record the oscillatory behaviour {{of the former}} Tasman Glacier snout when it formed a calving margin in a proglacial and locally supraglacial lake dammed by a glacitectonically disturbed outwash head and lateral moraine ridges. This is entirely consistent with the landform–sediment record of its coeval terrestrial margins, where flutings and push moraines are diagnostic of active temperate glacier recession from a glacially overridden outwash head, the latter being recorded by the vertically <b>stacked</b> sub-horizontally <b>bedded</b> and coarse-grained gravels of LF 7 (Waitaki Member). Previous proposals that late Pleistocene lake damming was initiated by an ice-cored moraine arc appear unfounded, because the glacilacustrine deposits only lie above the altitude of the outwash head/lateral moraine arc in locations {{where they have been}} glacitectonically compressed. Alternatively, it is proposed that the overdeepened subglacial topography was produced by the construction of an outwash head, leading to a glacilacustrine sediment sink which operates at times when the expanded Tasman Glacier actively retreats from the outwash head apex.

40|$|Although levee {{deposits}} make up {{a significant}} part of modern and ancient deep-marine slope systems, details of their internal lithological composition and stratal architecture remain poorly documented. At the Castle Creek study area, strata of the Neoproterozoic Isaac Formation (Windermere Supergroup) crop out superbly in a kilometre-scale section through a sinuous deep-water channel-levee system (ICC 3). Levee deposits near the outer bend of the channel consist of sandstone-rich (sandstone-to-mudstone ratio of 68 : 42), medium- to thick-bedded turbidites interstratified with thinly-bedded turbidites. Structureless sandstone (Ta), planar laminated sandstone (Tb), non-climbing ripple cross-stratified sandstone (Tc) and massive and laminated siltstone (Td) are common. Thick beds generally thicken and then thin and fine laterally over about 300 m. Thin-bedded strata, in contrast, thin and fine negligibly over similar distances. In the distal part of the outer-bend levee (up to 700 m laterally away from the channel) strata consist predominantly of thin-bedded Tcd turbidites with a much lower sandstone-to-mudstone ratio (35 : 65). On {{the opposite side of the}} channel, inner-bend levee deposits are mudstone-rich, locally as low as 15 : 85, and consist mostly of thin-bedded, Tcd turbidites, although thicker-bedded, Ta-d turbidites are more common in the lower part of the section. Lateral thinning and fining of beds is more rapid than their outer-bend counterpart. Levee deposits of ICC 3 comprise three stacked decametre-scale upward-thinning and -fining successions. Each is interpreted to record a depositional history consisting of lateral channel migration, levee deposition, channel filling, and distal levee deposition. During the early stage of increasing levee relief it is proposed that the termini of individual beds progressively backstep towards the channel margin resulting in an overall lateral thinning of the stratal profile. This interpretation notably contrasts the common assumption that levee morphology is the result of the vertical <b>stacking</b> of <b>beds</b> that dip. In addition to field studies, laboratory experiments were conducted to determine the depositional threshold of non-climbing ripple cross-stratification, which is common in levee strata of ICC 3. It was determined that non-climbing ripples form when bed aggradation rates are less than 0. 015 cm/sec, and most probably in flows made up of poorly sorted sediment...|$|R
40|$|Pliocene–Recent {{volcanic}} outcrops at Seal Nunataks and Beethoven Peninsula (Antarctic Peninsula) are {{remnants of}} several monogenetic volcanoes formed by eruption of vesiculating basaltic magma into shallow water, in an englacial environment. The diversity of sedimentary and volcanic lithofacies {{present in the}} Antarctic Peninsula outcrops provides a clear illustration of {{the wide range of}} eruptive, transportational and depositional processes which are associated with englacial Surtseyan volcanism. Early-formed pillow lava and glassy breccia, representing a pillow volcano stage of construction, are draped by tephra erupted explosively during a tuff cone stage. The tephra was resedimented around the volcano flanks, mainly by coarse-grained sediment gravity flows. Fine-grained lithofacies are rare, and fine material probably bypassed the main volcanic edifice, accumulating in the surrounding englacial basin. The pattern of sedimentation records variations in eruption dynamics. Products of continuous-uprush eruptions are thought to be represented by <b>stacks</b> of poorly <b>bedded</b> gravelly sandstone, whereas better bedded, lithologically more diverse sequences accumulated during periods of quiescence or effusive activity. Evidence for volcano flank failure is common. In Seal Nunataks, subaerial lithofacies (mainly lavas and cinder cone deposits) are volumetrically minor and occur at a similar stratigraphical position to pillow lava, suggesting that glacial lake drainage may have occurred prior to or during deposition of the subaerial lithofacies. By contrast, voluminous subaerial effusion in Beethoven Peninsula {{led to the development of}} laterally extensive stratified glassy breccias representing progradation of hyaloclastite deltas...|$|R
40|$|Turbidites {{have been}} {{extensively}} studied {{in many different}} areas using cores or outcrop, which represent only an integrated snapshot of a dynamic evolving flow. Laboratory experiments provide the missing relationships between the flow characteristics and their deposits. In particular, flume experiments emphasize {{that the presence of}} clay {{plays a key role in}} turbidity current dynamics. Clay fraction, in small amount, provides cohesive strength to sediment mixtures and can damp turbulence. However, the degree of flocculation is dependent on factors such as the amount and size of clay particles, the surface of clay particles, chemistry and pH conditions in which the clay particles are dispersed. The present study focuses on thin clayey sand turbidites found in Lake Hazar (Turkey) occurring in <b>stacked</b> thin <b>beds.</b> Depositional processes and sources have been previously studied and three types were deciphered, including laminar flows dominated by cohesion, transitional, and turbulence flow regimes (Hage et al., in revision). For the purpose of determine the clay behavior in the three flow regimes, clay mineralogical, geochemical measurements on the cores allow characterising the turbidites. SEM observations provide further information regarding the morphology of clay minerals and other clasts. The study is particularly relevant given the highly alkaline and saline water of the Hazar Lake. Clay minerals in Hazar Lake sediments include kaolinite (1 : 1 -type), illite and chlorite (2 : 1 -type). Hazar lake water is alkaline having pH around 9. 3, in such alkaline environment, a cation-exchange reaction takes place. Furthermore, in saline water (16 ‰), salts can act as a shield and decrease the repulsive forces between clay particle surfaces. So, pH and salt content jointly impact the behaviour of clays differently. Since the Al-faces of clay structures have a negative charge in basic solutions. At high pH, all kaolinite surfaces become negative-charged, and then kaolinite particles are dispersed, and the suspension is stabilized supported by our SEM observations. In alkaline water, kaolinite reveals a lower degree of consolidation. While, alkaline water has no measurable effect on illite and chlorite surface properties due to the absence of modifications in charge. Illite and chlorite form with other clasts clusters or aggregate structures in suspension when the particle interactions are dominated by attractive energies were formed. The aggregate structure plays a major part in the flow behavior of clay suspensions. Flocs will immobilize the suspending medium, and give rise to increasing viscosity and yield strength of the suspension. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Carbonate {{strata of}} the Mesoproterozoic Wumishan Formation in the Jixian area near Tianjin are ~ 3300  m thick and were {{deposited}} over some 100  million years (from ~ 1310 ± 20 Ma to ~ 1207 ± 10 Ma). Metre-scale cycles (parasequences) dominate the succession. They are generally of the peritidal carbonate type, and mostly show an approximately symmetrical lithofacies succession with thick stromatolite biostromes and small thromboliteoncolite bioherms constituting {{the central part}} and tidal-flat dolomites forming {{the upper and lower}} parts. Lagoonal-supratidal dolomitic shales with palaeosol caps make up the topmost layers. The boundaries of the Wumishan cycles are typically exposure surfaces, and there is abundant evidence for fresh-water diagenesis. Widespread 1 : 4 stacking patterns indicate that the individual Wumishan cycles are sixth-order parasequences, with 4 parasequences constituting one fifth-order parasequence set. Locally, 5 – 8 beds or couplets, can be discerned in some of the cycles. The regular vertical <b>stacking</b> pattern of <b>beds</b> within the sixth-order parasequences, forming the fifth-order parasequence sets, are interpreted as the result of environmental fluctuations controlled by Milankovitch rhythms, namely the superimposition of precession, and short and long-eccentricity. The widespread 1 : 4 stacking pattern in the cyclic succession, as well as the local 1 : 5 – 8 stacking patterns of the beds within the cycles, suggest that the Milankovitch rhythms had similar ratios in the Mesoproterozoic as in the Phanerozoic. Based on the cycle stacking patterns, 26 third-order sequences can be distinguished and these group into 6 second-order, transgressive-regressive megasequences (or sequence sets), all reflecting a composite, hierarchical succession of relative sea-level changes...|$|R
40|$|Rocks {{characterized}} by an apparently chaotic block in matrix fabric and known as argille scagliose are widespread in the Apennines of Italy. Most of the argille scagliose can be differentiated into two kinds of units, tectonosomes and olistostromes, which have different sedimentological and structural characteristics and implications. The tectonosomes derived from polyphase deformation of lithostratigraphic units of an oceanic cover succession. Stratal disruption resulted from (1) folding and boudinage of nonconsolidated sediments, compatible with shallow tectonic deformation or gravitational spreading and slumping, and (2) prevalent brittle, simple-shear deformation, related to boudinage, transposition of <b>bedding,</b> <b>stacking</b> of blocks, and thrusting. A pervasive scaly fabric enabled the tectonic mobility of the matrix that accompanied the simple shear deformation. Olistostromes are chaotic sedimentary bodies. They have been interpreted as syntectonic deposits related to episodes of slope failure {{at the front of}} thrust systems in thrust-bordered, piggyback basins. The inferred depositional mechanisms are debris avalanches that become debris flows downslope. All of these bodies, whether tectonosomes or olistostromes, have, at first observation, common characteristics, such as block-in-matrix fabric and the seemingly chaotic disposition of blocks. The criteria for differentiating tectonosomes from olistostromes may be useful to distinguish tectonically disrupted lithostratigraphic units from submarine debris flow and slide deposits in melanges in other orogenic belts. The basic criteria for field distinction are composition and age of component rocks, different order-disorder ratio in the distribution of blocks, and the presence of scaly fabric or of a matrix hosting millimeter to submillimeter clasts (brecciated matrix) ...|$|R

40|$|Cyclo{{stratigraphy}} is the subdiscipline of stratigraphy {{that deals}} with the identification, characterization, correlation, and interpretation of cyclic variations in the stratigraphic record and, in particular, with their application in geochronology by improving the accuracy and resolution of time-stratigraphic frameworks. As such it uses astronomical cycles of known periodicities to date and interpret the sedimentary record. The {{most important of these}} cycles are the Earth's orbital cycles of precession, obliquity, and eccentricity (Milankovitch cycles), which result from perturbations of the Earth's orbit and its rotational axis. They have periods ranging from 20 to 400 kyr, and even up to millions of years. These cycles translate (via orbital-induced changes in insolation) into climatic, oceanographic, sedimentary, and biological changes that are potentially recorded in the sedimentary archives through geologic time. Many case studies have demonstrated that detailed analysis of the sedimentary record (<b>stacking</b> patterns of <b>beds,</b> disconformities, facies changes, fluctuations in biological composition, and/or changes in geochemical composition) enables identification of these cycles with high confidence. Once the relationship between the sedimentary record and the orbital forcing is established, an unprecedented high time resolution becomes available, providing a precise and accurate framework for the timing of Earth system processes. For the younger part of the geologic past, astronomical time scales have been constructed by tuning cyclic palaeoclimatic records to orbital and insolation target curves; these time scales are directly tied to the Present. In addition, the astronomical tuning has been used to calibrate the ⁴⁰Ar/³⁹Ar dating method. In the older geologic past, "floating" astronomical time scales provide a high time resolution for stratigraphic intervals, even if their radiometric age is subject to the error margins of the dating techniques...|$|R
40|$|A {{part of the}} Upper Oligocene sand-rich turbidite {{systems of}} the Central Carpathian Basin is {{represented}} by the Zuberec Formation. Sand/mud-mixed deposits of this formation are well exposed {{in the northern part of}} the basin, allowing us to interpret the turbidite succession as terminal lobe deposits of a submarine fan. This interpretation is based on the discrimination of three facies associations that are comparable to different components of distributive lobe deposits in deep-water fan systems. They correspond to the lobe off-axis, lobe fringe and lobe distal fringe depositional subenvironments, respectively. The inferences about the depositional paleoenvironment based on sedimentological observations are verified by statistical analyses. The bed-thickness frequency distributions and vertical organization of the facies associations show cyclic trends at different hierarchical levels that enable us to reconstruct architectural elements of a turbidite fan. First, small-scale trends correspond with shift in the lobe element centroid between successive elements. Differences in the distribution and frequency of sandstone bed thicknesses as well as differences in the shape of bed-thickness frequency distributions between individual facies associations reflect a gradual fining and thinning in a down-dip direction. Second, meso-scale trends are identified within lobes and they generally correspond to the significant periodicity identified by the time series analysis of the bed thicknesses. The meso-scale trends demonstrate shifts in the position of the lobe centroid within the lobe system. Both types of trends have a character of a compensational stacking pattern and could be linked to autogenic processes. Third, a largescale trend documented by generally thickening-upward <b>stacking</b> pattern of <b>beds,</b> accompanied by a general increase of the sandstones/mudstones ratio and by a gradual change of percentage of individual facies, could be comparable to lobe-system scale. This trend probably indicates a gradual basinward progradation of lobe system controlled by allogenic processes related to tectonic activity of sources and sea-level fluctuations...|$|R
40|$|Sedimentary {{exposures}} in moraines in a Scottish Highland valley (Glen Chaorach), reveal <b>stacked</b> {{sequences of}} <b>bedded</b> and laminated silt, sand and gravel, interspersed or capped with diamicton units. In four examples, faults and folds indicate deformation by glaciotectonism and syndepositional loading. We propose that these sediments were {{laid down in}} an ice-dammed lake, close to the last ice margin to occupy this glen. Individual units within cross-valley De Geer moraine ridges are interpreted by comparison with examples from similar environments elsewhere: stratified diamictons containing laminated or bedded lenses are interpreted as subaqueous ice-marginal debris-flow deposits; massive fine-grained deposits as hyperconcentrated flow deposits, and massive gravel units as high-density debris-flow deposits. Using an allostratigraphic approach we argue that glaciotectonically deformed coarsening-upward sand and gravel sequences that culminate in deposition of subglacial diamicton represent glacier advances into the ice-marginal lake, whereas undisturbed cross-bedded sand and gravel reflects channel or fan deposits laid down during glacier retreat. A flat terrace of bedded sand and gravel at {{the northern end of}} Glen Chaorach is interpreted as subaerial glaciofluvial outwash. On the basis of these inferences we propose the following three stage deglacial event chronology for Glen Chaorach. During glacier recession, ice separation and intra-lobe ponding first led to subaquaeous deposition of sorted and unsorted facies. Subsequent glacier stabilisation and ice-marginal oscillation produced glaciotectonic structures in the ice-marginal sediment pile and formed De Geer moraines. Finally, drainage of the ice-dammed lake allowed a subaerial ice-marginal drainage system to become established. Throughout deglaciation, deposition within the lake was characterized by abrupt changes in grain size and in the architecture of individual sediment bodies, reflecting changing delivery paths and sediment supply, and by dynamic margin oscillations typical of water-terminating glaciers. ...|$|R

The confusion was unbelievable; {{this time it was}} disorder with German perfection. We were moved into clean barracks, equipped for human beings with excellent bathrooms and clean <b>beds</b> <b>stacked</b> three on top of each other. After all we had experienced in the preceding year, this was sheer luxury. There was no mention of the usual camp rituals, no roll calls and no work, but also no food. The kitchen and food supply were guarded by the SS and Hungarian soldiers, Hitler’s allies.Hungry people searched every trash can and rubbish heap for potato peels or anything edible. After two or three days, there was absolutely nothing left to eat in the refuse of the huge compound. Most of the time we just lay in our beds, listening to and enjoying the approaching artillery fire. We lived on the good and bad news, with reports changing from one hour to the next. But the hunger remained constant. One rarely saw the SS anymore; we were guarded solely by Hungarian soldiers. Every now and then in the confusion soup was supposedly distributed. Perhaps one person heard about it, a second saw it and a third actually received it. Perhaps. When it came to camp hierarchy and maintenance, some of the prominent prisoners tried to take over. Among them were many Poles, so-called “functionary prisoners”. It was surprising to find that they were in such good condition. The other prisoners, especially the Jews, were so weak and exhausted that they could hardly stand. Still there was nothing to eat, because there was absolutely nothing anywhere.|$|R
40|$|An {{entirely new}} class of {{light-weight}} reversible hydrides was recently discovered (the Ti-doped alanates) [1]. These NaAIH{sub 4 }-based materials have demonstrated reversible hydrogen storage capacities of up to 5 wt%, nearly 4 times the gravimetrically density of commercial metal hydrides. For this reason, they have been considered a breakthrough for hydrogen storage in fuel cell vehicles. This project {{is the first to}} publish the use of alanates for the generation of electrical power and the first demonstration of a hydride-fueled elevated-temperature PEM Fuel Cell. Because the kinetics of hydrogen uptake and release by the alanate improves with elevated temperatures, novel concepts were tested for the purpose of developing a highly efficient stand-alone power system. A major focus of this work was on the modeling, design, construction and testing of an integrated fuel cell stack and hydrogen storage system that eliminates the need of complicated heat transfer systems and media. After extensive modeling efforts, a proof-of-concept system was built that employs an integrated fuel cell <b>stack</b> and hydride <b>beds</b> that balancing the generation of fuel cell waste heat with the endothermic release of hydrogen from the alanates. Our demonstration unit was capable of greater than one hour of operation on a single charge of hydrogen from the integrated 173 gram alanate bed. In addition, composite hydride materials with synergistic reaction heats were evaluated and tested to enhance the operational performance of the alanates. The composites provide a unique opportunity to utilize the heat produced from hydriding classic metal hydrides to improve both absorption and desorption rates of the alanates. A particular focus of the mixed storage materials work was to balance the thermodynamics and kinetics of the hydrides for start-up conditions. Modeling of the sorption properties proved invaluable in evaluating the optimum composition of hydrides. The modeling efforts were followed by full validation by experimental measurements. This project successfully completed the proof-of-concept goals and generated a powerful set of tools for optimizing the complete power-generation system. It has also created a new direction for hydrogen power generation as well the potential for new R&D based on this work...|$|R
40|$|Turbidite {{sandstones}} {{found in}} deep-water fold-and-thrust belts are increasingly exploited as hydrocarbon reservoirs. Within these rocks, the fluid flow is profoundly {{affected by the}} complex interaction between primary sedimentological and stratigraphic attributes (i. e, facies, layering, reservoir quality, <b>stacking</b> patterns, <b>bed</b> connectivity and lateral extent) and fracture characteristics (i. e., length, spacing, distribution, orientation, connectivity). Unfortunately, most of these features are at, or below, the resolution of conventional seismic datasets and, for this reason, their identification and localization represent {{one of the fundamental}} challenges facing exploration, appraisal and production of the sandstone reservoirs. In this respect, whereas considerable effort has been afforded to a characterization of the sedimentological and stratigraphic aspects of sandstones, detailed analysis of fractures in this type of successions has received significantly less attention. In this work, we combine field and laboratory analyses to assess the possible mechanical control exerted by the rock properties (grain size, intergranualr porosity, and Young modulus), as well as the influence of bed thickness, on joint density in turbidite sandstones. Joints are mode-I fractures occurring parallel to the greatest principle stress axis, which solve opening displacement and do not show evidence of shearing and enhance the values of total porosity forming preferential hydraulic conduits for fluid flow. Within layered rocks, commonly, joints form perpendicular to bedding due to overburden or exhumation. The empirical relation between joint spacing and bed thickness, documented in the field by many authors, has been mechanically related to the stress perturbation taking place around joints during their formation. Furthermore, close correlations between joint density and rock properties have been already established. In this present contribution, we focus on the bed-perpendicular joint spacing/bed thickness (S/T) relationships on sandstone bodies that experienced similar diagenetic and tectonic histories. The field area is located in the Periadriatic foreland basin, eastern central Italy, which show late Pliocene slope turbidites in excellent 3 d views. The Periadriatic foreland basin is an elongated, roughly N-S oriented trough located immediately east of the Apennines fold-thrust belt. The basin fill mostly consists of deepwater Plio-Pleistocene sediments partially incorporated into the frontal part of the orogenic wedge. During the late Pliocene, gravel and sand originated from the uplifting Apennines were abundantly supplied to the deep-water basin through a series of erosional conduits that, in the rock record, appear as a series of N-S oriented slope submarine canyon systems deeply incised into the hemipelagic mudstones of the adjacent slope. The studied exposure allows direct observation of spatial and temporal relationships among the various depositional elements comprising the canyon system and related lithofacies, as well as the bed-perpendicular joint density within each lithofacies. We performed a multidisciplinary work involving the following tasks: (i) 3 D stratigraphic model of the depositional architecture of the Castignano and Ascensione canyon systems (Marche region, Italy); (ii) 2 D scanline survey of several outcrops displaying bed-perpendicular joints; (iii) digital image analysis of selected thin-section obtained from oriented hand samples to characterize the 3 D intergranualr porosity; (iv) Stiffness analysis of representative sandstone bodies by mean of Schmidt hammer tests. The first results of this ongoing study on the mechanical stratigraphy of the two Late Pliocene canyon systems are consistent with the joint density being effected by both geometrical (i. e., bed thickness) and mechanical properties. This data set will help field and experimental geologists to better define common strategies to assess the controlling factors on joint distribution within layered media. Furthermore, this knowledge can be very important in order to make predictions on the modalities of subsurface fluid flow through deep-water sandstone rocks...|$|R
