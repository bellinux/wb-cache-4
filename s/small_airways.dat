5|$|COPD {{is a type}} of obstructive {{lung disease}} in which chronic incompletely {{reversible}} poor airflow (airflow limitation) and inability to breathe out fully (air trapping) exist. The poor airflow is the result of breakdown of lung tissue (known as emphysema) and <b>small</b> <b>airways</b> disease (known as obstructive bronchiolitis). The relative contributions of these two factors vary between people. Severe destruction of <b>small</b> <b>airways</b> can lead to the formation of large air pockets—known as bullae—that replace lung tissue. This form of disease is called bullous emphysema.|$|E
5|$|From the 1960s, {{the rates}} of lung {{adenocarcinoma}} started to rise relative to other types of lung cancer. This {{is partly due to}} the introduction of filter cigarettes. The use of filters removes larger particles from tobacco smoke, thus reducing deposition in larger airways. However, the smoker has to inhale more deeply to receive the same amount of nicotine, increasing particle deposition in <b>small</b> <b>airways</b> where adenocarcinoma tends to arise. The incidence of lung adenocarcinoma continues to rise.|$|E
5|$|Tobacco {{smoking is}} {{the most common cause of}} COPD, with factors such as air {{pollution}} and genetics playing a smaller role. In the developing world, one of the common sources of air pollution is poorly vented heating and cooking fires. Long-term exposure to these irritants causes an inflammatory response in the lungs, resulting in narrowing of the <b>small</b> <b>airways</b> and breakdown of lung tissue. The diagnosis is based on poor airflow as measured by lung function tests. In contrast to asthma, the airflow reduction does not improve much with the use of a bronchodilator.|$|E

The same airways were also studied histologically and <b>small</b> <b>airway</b> disease was quantified by subjective grading of the degree of inflammatory cell infiltration, smooth muscle hypertrophy, fibrosis, and goblet cell hyperplasia. The degree of <b>small</b> <b>airway</b> disease varied widely among patients both with and without chronic bronchitis.

Contractile responses (Tmax) to histamine and methacholine in peripheral airways tended to be higher in patients with chronic bronchitis than in those without.

25|$|The lungs of {{individuals}} with cystic fibrosis are colonized and infected by bacteria from an early age. These bacteria, which often spread among individuals with CF, thrive in the altered mucus, which collects in the <b>small</b> <b>airways</b> of the lungs. This mucus leads {{to the formation of}} bacterial microenvironments known as biofilms that are difficult for immune cells and antibiotics to penetrate. Viscous secretions and persistent respiratory infections repeatedly damage the lung by gradually remodeling the airways, which makes infection even more difficult to eradicate.|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the damage}} in CF is due to {{blockage}} of the narrow passages of affected organs with thickened secretions. These blockages lead to remodeling and infection in the lung, damage by accumulated digestive enzymes in the pancreas, blockage of the intestines by thick feces, etc. Several theories have been posited on how the defects in the protein and cellular function cause the clinical effects. The most current theory suggests that defective ion transport leads to dehydration in the airway epithelia, thickening mucus. In airway epithelial cells, the cilia exist in between the cell's apical surface and mucus in a layer known as airway surface liquid (ASL). The flow of ions from the cell and into this layer is determined by ion channels such as CFTR. CFTR not only allows chloride ions {{to be drawn from}} the cell and into the ASL, but it also regulates another channel called ENac, which allows sodium ions to leave the ASL and enter the respiratory epithelium. CFTR normally inhibits this channel, but if the CFTR is defective, then sodium flows freely from the ASL and into the cell. As water follows sodium, the depth of ASL will be depleted and the cilia will be left in the mucous layer. As cilia cannot effectively move in a thick, viscous environment, mucociliary clearance is deficient and a buildup of mucus occurs, clogging <b>small</b> <b>airways.</b> The accumulation of more viscous, nutrient-rich mucus in the lungs allows bacteria to hide from the body's immune system, causing repeated respiratory infections. The presence of the same CFTR proteins in pancreatic duct and skin cells also cause symptoms in these systems.|$|E

40|$|RationaleCoal mine dust {{exposure}} can cause symptoms {{and loss of}} lung function from multiple mechanisms, but the roles of each disease process are not fully understood. ObjectivesWe investigated the implications of <b>small</b> <b>airway</b> dysfunction for exercise physiology {{among a group of}} workers exposed to coal mine dust. MethodsTwenty coal miners performed spirometry, first breathing air and then helium-oxygen, single-breath diffusing capacity, and computerized chest tomography, and then completed cardiopulmonary exercise testing. Measurements and Main ResultsSix participants meeting criteria for <b>small</b> <b>airway</b> dysfunction were compared with 14 coal miners who did not. At submaximal workload, miners with <b>small</b> <b>airway</b> dysfunction used a higher proportion of their maximum voluntary ventilation and had higher ventilatory equivalents for both O 2 and CO 2. Regression modeling indicated that inefficient ventilation was significantly related to <b>small</b> <b>airway</b> dysfunction but not to FEV 1 or diffusing capacity. At the end of exercise, miners with <b>small</b> <b>airway</b> dysfunction had 27 % lower O 2 consumption. ConclusionsSmall airway abnormalities may be associated with important inefficiency of exercise ventilation.

500|$|Chest-wall defects {{are usually}} evident {{in cases of}} injury to the chest wall, such as stab or bullet wounds ("open pneumothorax"). In {{secondary}} spontaneous pneumothoraces, vulnerabilities in the lung tissue are caused {{by a variety of}} disease processes, particularly by rupturing of bullae (large air-containing lesions) in cases of severe emphysema. Areas of necrosis (tissue death) may precipitate episodes of pneumothorax, although the exact mechanism is unclear. Primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP) has for many years been thought to be caused by [...] "blebs" [...] (small air-filled lesions just under the pleural surface), which were presumed to be more common in those classically at risk of pneumothorax (tall males) due to mechanical factors. In PSP, blebs can be found in 77% of cases, compared to 6% in the general population without a history of PSP. As these healthy subjects do not all develop a pneumothorax later, the hypothesis may not be sufficient to explain all episodes; furthermore, pneumothorax may recur even after surgical treatment of blebs. It has therefore been suggested that PSP may also be caused by areas of disruption (porosity) in the pleural layer, which are prone to rupture. Smoking may additionally lead to inflammation and obstruction of <b>small</b> <b>airways,</b> which account for the markedly increased risk of PSPs in smokers. Once air has stopped entering the pleural cavity, it is gradually reabsorbed.|$|E

40|$|Nuclear factor erythroid 2 –related factor 2 (Nrf 2) is an oxidant-responsive {{transcription}} factor known to induce detoxifying and antioxidant genes. Cigarette smoke, with its large oxidant content, {{is a major}} stress on the cells of <b>small</b> <b>airway</b> epithelium, which are vulnerable to oxidant damage. We assessed the role of cigarette smoke in activation of Nrf 2 in the human <b>small</b> <b>airway</b> epithelium in vivo. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy was used to sample the <b>small</b> <b>airway</b> epithelium in healthy-nonsmoker and healthysmoker, and gene expression was assessed using microarrays. Relative to nonsmokers, Nrf 2 protein in the <b>small</b> <b>airway</b> epithelium of smokers was activated and localized in the nucleus. The human homologs of 201 known murine Nrf 2 -modulated genes were identified, and 13 highly smoking-responsive Nrf 2 -modulated genes were identified. Construction of an Nrf 2 index to assess the expression levels of these 13 genes in the airway epithelium of smokers showed coordinate control, an observation confirmed by quantitative PCR. This coordinate level of expression of the 13 Nrf 2 -modulated genes was independent of smoking history or demographic parameters. The Nrf 2 index was used to identify two novel Nrf 2 -modulated, smoking-responsive genes, pirin (PIR) and UDP glucuronosyltransferase 1 -family polypeptide A 4 (UGT 1 A 4). Both genes were demonstrated to contain functional antioxidant response elements in the promoter region. These observations suggest that Nrf 2 {{plays an important role}} in regulating cellular defenses against smoking in the highly vulnerable <b>small</b> <b>airway</b> epithelium cells, and that there is variability within the human population in the Nrf 2 responsiveness to oxidant burden...|$|R
40|$|Background: Asthma and cystic {{fibrosis}} (CF) are chronic inflammatory airway disorders known {{to involve the}} peripheral airways. Non-invasive tests sensitive to peripheral airway function and inflammation are therefore of high priority. Multiple breath inert gas washout (MBW) is a test sensitive to <b>small</b> <b>airway</b> function and exhaled nitric oxide (NO) reflects airway inflammation in asthma. Aim: To use exhaled NO in combination with MBW to assess the contribution of <b>small</b> <b>airway</b> inflammation and dysfunction in paediatric asthma and CF in order to potentially allow for earlier intervention and more successful management of these conditions in the future. Results: CF subjects had reduced levels of nasal and exhaled NO. All but three children with CF had abnormally elevated LCI. Low levels of NO were associated with impaired airway function, chronic infection with Ps. Aeruginosa, severe genotypes and the fatty acid deficiency characteristic for CF subjects. Low levels of alveolar NO, albeit not lower in CF than in healthy controls, were associated with increased systemic inflammation and chronic bacterial airway colonisation. LCI, Scond, and Sacin were all significantly elevated in children with asthma and Scond was the marker that most significantly differentiated the asthmatic children from the healthy controls. Increased Scond was associated with increased levels of exhaled NO and airway hyper-responsiveness and Sacin correlated with alveolar NO. Conclusions: This thesis provides further evidence of <b>small</b> <b>airway</b> involvement in both paediatric asthma and CF. The findings of clinically significant dysfunction of the <b>small</b> conducting <b>airways</b> in paediatric asthma and the associations between <b>small</b> <b>airway</b> dysfunction, increased levels of exhaled NO and airway hyper-responsiveness are novel findings. In CF, low levels of exhaled NO are linked to <b>small</b> <b>airway</b> dysfunction.

40|$|Abstract Background The <b>small</b> <b>airway</b> {{epithelium}} and alveolar macrophages {{are exposed}} to oxidants in cigarette smoke leading to epithelial dysfunction and macrophage activation. In this context, we asked: what is the transcriptome of oxidant-related genes in <b>small</b> <b>airway</b> epithelium and alveolar macrophages, and does their response differ substantially to inhaled cigarette smoke? Methods Using microarray analysis, with TaqMan RT-PCR confirmation, we assessed oxidant-related gene expression in <b>small</b> <b>airway</b> epithelium and alveolar macrophages from the same healthy nonsmoker and smoker individuals. Results Of 155 genes surveyed, 87 (56 %) were expressed in both cell populations in nonsmokers, with higher expression in alveolar macrophages (43 %) compared to airway epithelium (24 %). In smokers, there were 15 genes (10 %) up-regulated and 7 genes (5 %) down-regulated in airway epithelium, but only 3 (2 %) up-regulated and 2 (1 %) down-regulated in alveolar macrophages. Pathway analysis of airway epithelium showed oxidant pathways dominated, but in alveolar macrophages immune pathways dominated. Conclusion Thus, the response of different cell-types with an identical genome exposed to the same stress of smoking is different; responses of alveolar macrophages are more subdued than those of airway epithelium.

The levels of class II MHC on lung epithelial and endothelial cells were comparable to those seen on an Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) -transformed B-cell line. However, the costimulatory molecules B 7 - 1 and B 7 - 2 were not expressed. The ability of the class II MHC expressing human lung parenchymal cells to present alloantigen to CD 4 + T lymphocytes was investigated.

40|$|<b>Small</b> <b>airway</b> {{inflammation}} and remodelling occurs in asthma and may underpin disease persistence, since conventional inhaled treatments do not penetrate to the <b>small</b> <b>airway</b> compartment. There {{is an important}} unmet need for reliable and non-invasive methods to measure <b>small</b> <b>airway</b> obstruction. This thesis describes the development and validation of such methods, with a particular focus on the multiple breath inert gas washout (MBW) technique. In vitro validation of the sulphur hexafluoride wash-in technique for performing MBW demonstrated that the method yields accurate and repeatable results. We developed novel methods for analysing inert gas washout curves, and showed that the parameters derived are repeatable, capture the full information content of the curve, and may be superior to standard parameters in distinguishing between subphenotypes of airway diseases. MBW and impulse oscillometry (IOS) parameters {{were found to be}} repeatable within-visit, but IOS parameters displayed greater stability over time. IOS parameters were independent predictors of asthma symptoms, quality of life and exacerbation frequency, suggesting that IOS may add value to spirometry in the assessment of patients with asthma. The response of <b>small</b> <b>airway</b> biomarkers to an intervention was assessed within a clinical trial of a novel anti-eosinophilic agent. Significant treatment effects were observed with respect to spirometric airflow obstruction and air trapping, as well as with a number of MBW parameters.

There was evidence for a structural abnormality in the pulmonary acinus in patients with asthma causing subtle alterations in diffusion within this compartment.

The controversy about whether the BALF cellular profile reflects T lymphocytes in lung tissue still persists. Some studies found a positive correlation of cell composition between BALF and lung tissue, but others gave opposite conclusion. ObjectiveTo investigate CD 4 + and CD 8 + T lymphocytes distribution in lung tissue of NSIP and the relationship with T lymphocytes in bronchoalveolar lavage.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Chronic lung {{allograft}} dysfunction in {{the form}} of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) is the main cause of death beyond 1 -year post-lung transplantation. The disease-initiating triggers as well as the molecular changes leading to fibrotic alterations in the transplanted lung are largely unknown. The aim {{of this study was to}} identify potential early changes in the extracellular matrix (ECM) in different compartments of the transplanted lung prior to the development of BOS. METHODS: Transbronchial biopsies from a cohort of 58 lung transplantation patients at the Copenhagen University hospital between 2005 and 2006, with or without development of BOS in a 5 -year follow-up, were obtained 3 and 12 months after transplantation. Biopsies were assessed for total collagen, collagen type IV and biglycan in the alveolar and <b>small</b> <b>airway</b> compartments using Masson's Trichrome staining and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: A time-specific and compartment-specific pattern of ECM changes was detected. Alveolar total collagen (p= 0. 0190) and <b>small</b> <b>airway</b> biglycan (p= 0. 0199) increased between 3 and 12 months after transplantation in patients developing BOS, while collagen type IV (p= 0. 0124) increased in patients without BOS.
