5|$|A viral genome, {{irrespective}} of nucleic acid type, {{is almost always}} either <b>single-stranded</b> or double-stranded. <b>Single-stranded</b> genomes consist of an unpaired nucleic acid, analogous to one-half of a ladder split down the middle. Double-stranded genomes consist of two complementary paired nucleic acids, analogous to a ladder. The virus particles of some virus families, such as those belonging to the Hepadnaviridae, contain a genome that is partially double-stranded and partially <b>single-stranded.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{distinct}} {{group of}} DNA-binding proteins is the DNA-binding proteins that specifically bind <b>single-stranded</b> DNA. In humans, replication protein A is the best-understood {{member of this}} family and is used in processes where the double helix is separated, including DNA replication, recombination, and DNA repair. These binding proteins seem to stabilize <b>single-stranded</b> DNA and protect it from forming stem-loops or being degraded by nucleases.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to these stacked structures, telomeres also form large loop structures called telomere loops, or T-loops. Here, the <b>single-stranded</b> DNA curls around in a long circle stabilized by telomere-binding proteins. At {{the very end of}} the T-loop, the <b>single-stranded</b> telomere DNA is held onto a region of double-stranded DNA by the telomere strand disrupting the double-helical DNA and base pairing to one of the two strands. This triple-stranded structure is called a displacement loop or D-loop.|$|E
50|$|Strand {{displacement}} assay {{involves the}} radiolabeling of DNA duplexes. Following helicase treatment, the <b>single-strand</b> DNA is visually detected as {{separate from the}} double-strand DNA by non-denaturing PAGE electrophoresis. Following detection of the <b>single-strand</b> DNA, the amount of radioactive tag {{that is on the}} <b>single-strand</b> DNA is quantified to give a numerical value for the amount of double-strand DNA unwinding.|$|R
40|$|The {{deoxyribonucleic acid}} (DNA) of {{competent}} wild-type Haemophilus influenzae and rec 1 mutant cells contains <b>single-strand</b> regions, as judged by alkaline sucrose sedimentation, benzoylated naphthoylated diethylaminoethyl-cellulose fractionation, and digestion with an enzyme specific for <b>single-strand</b> regions in DNA. In contrast, the DNA of competent rec 2 cells {{does not contain}} <b>single-strand</b> regions. Since transforming DNA does not associate with recipient DNA in the rec 2 mutant {{as it does in}} wild type and rec 1, it is concluded that the <b>single-strand</b> regions in the DNA of the competent cells are important for an early step in recombination between cell DNA and transforming DNA...|$|R
40|$|DNA <b>single-strand</b> breaks {{can arise}} indirectly, as normal {{intermediates}} of DNA base excision repair, or directly from damage to deoxyribose. Because <b>single-strand</b> breaks are induced by endogenous reactive molecules such as reactive oxygen species, these lesions pose a continuous threat to genetic integrity. XRCC 1 protein {{plays a major}} role in facilitating the repair of <b>single-strand</b> breaks in mammalian cells, via an ability to interact with multiple enzymatic components of repair reactions. Here, the protein¿protein interactions facilitated by XRCC 1, and the repair processes in which these interactions operate, are reviewed. Models for the repair of <b>single-strand</b> breaks during base excision repair and at direct breaks are presented...|$|R
5|$|RNA viruses: Replication {{usually takes}} place in the cytoplasm. RNA viruses can be placed into four {{different}} groups depending on their modes of replication. The polarity (whether or not it can be used directly by ribosomes to make proteins) of <b>single-stranded</b> RNA viruses largely determines the replicative mechanism; the other major criterion is whether the genetic material is <b>single-stranded</b> or double-stranded. All RNA viruses use their own RNA replicase enzymes to create copies of their genomes.|$|E
5|$|A {{virus has}} either a DNA or an RNA genome and {{is called a}} DNA virus or an RNA virus, respectively. The vast {{majority}} of viruses have RNA genomes. Plant viruses tend to have <b>single-stranded</b> RNA genomes and bacteriophages tend to have double-stranded DNA genomes.|$|E
5|$|HIV is {{different}} in structure from other retroviruses. It is roughly spherical with a diameter of about 120nm, around 60times smaller than a red blood cell. It is composed of two copies of positive <b>single-stranded</b> RNA that codes for the virus's nine genes enclosed by a conical capsid composed of 2,000 copies of the viral protein p24. The <b>single-stranded</b> RNA is tightly bound to nucleocapsid proteins, p7, and enzymes needed {{for the development of}} the virion such as reverse transcriptase, proteases, ribonuclease and integrase. A matrix composed of the viral protein p17 surrounds the capsid ensuring the integrity of the virion particle.|$|E
40|$|Illumination of Chinese hamster {{cells with}} {{fluorescent}} light after 5 -bromodeoxyuridine incorporation leads to extensive <b>single-strand</b> breakage in the DNA of the exposed cells. The {{rate of production}} of <b>single-strand</b> breaks {{is dependent on the}} extent to which thymine is replaced by 5 -bromouracil. At least some of the breaks observed with alkaline gradients are probably produced in vivo and are probably not contingent upon alkaline hydrolysis since breakage can be demonstrated with neutral gradients also. Cells are able to rejoin most of the <b>single-strand</b> breaks within 60 min; however, damage to the DNA-containing material (the “complex”) initially released from cells is repaired more slowly. Cysteamine protects against <b>single-strand</b> breakage with a dose-modifying factor of 2. 8. A comparison is made between the production of <b>single-strand</b> breaks by fluorescent light and X-rays, and the significance of such breaks relative to cell survival is discussed...|$|R
40|$|<b>Single-strand</b> nicks {{caused by}} DNase I {{are capable of}} inactivating B. subtilis {{transforming}} DNA. Under suitable conditions, the polynucleotide joining enzyme from E. coli and a similar DPN-requiring activity from B. subtilis can completely repair this damage, restore biological activity, and increase the <b>single-strand</b> molecular weight. The rates of inactivation of a single genetic marker and of a four-marker linkage group suggest that a <b>single-strand</b> nick is inactivating even when far {{from the site of}} genetic damage...|$|R
40|$|Freezing of the enteropathogenic {{bacterium}} Yersinia enterocolitica to - 18 and - 75 degrees C caused 7 and 42 % cell death, respectively, and 0. 329 and 0. 588 <b>single-strand</b> breaks per 10 (8) daltons of DNA, respectively, while radiation to one D 10 dose (10 % cell survival) {{combined with}} freezing to 2 to 0, - 18, and - 75 degrees C induced 0. 05, 0. 75, and 5. 04 <b>single-strand</b> breaks, respectively. The {{increase in the}} effectiveness of radiation {{with respect to the}} yield of <b>single-strand</b> breaks at - 18 and - 75 degrees C is contrary to expectation and seems to be due to arrest of repair of <b>single-strand</b> breaks by these low temperatures...|$|R
5|$|Unlike {{double-stranded}} DNA, RNA is a <b>single-stranded</b> molecule {{in many of}} its biological {{roles and}} has a much shorter chain of nucleotides. However, RNA can, by complementary base pairing, form intrastrand (i.e., single-strand) double helixes, as in tRNA.|$|E
5|$|In the laboratory, the {{strength}} of this interaction can be measured by finding the temperature necessary to break the hydrogen bonds, their melting temperature (also called Tm value). When all the base pairs in a DNA double helix melt, the strands separate and exist in solution as two entirely independent molecules. These <b>single-stranded</b> DNA molecules have no single common shape, but some conformations are more stable than others.|$|E
5|$|Poliovirus is {{composed}} of an RNA genome and a protein capsid. The genome is a <b>single-stranded</b> positive-sense RNA genome that is about 7500 nucleotides long. The viral particle is about 30 nm in diameter with icosahedral symmetry. Because of its short genome and its simple composition—only RNA and a nonenveloped icosahedral protein coat that encapsulates it, poliovirus {{is widely regarded as}} the simplest significant virus.|$|E
40|$|We transduced the uvrA 6, uvrB 5, uvrC 34, and uvrC 56 markers {{from the}} {{original}} mutagenized strains into an HF 4714 background. Although in the original mutagenized strains uvrA 6 cells are more UV sensitive than uvrB 5 and uvrC 34 cells, in the new background {{no significant difference in}} UV sensitivity is observed among uvrA 6, uvrB 5, and uvrC 34 cells. No DNA <b>single-strand</b> breaks are detected in UV-irradiated uvrA 6 or uvrB 5 cells, whereas in contrast a significant number of <b>single-strand</b> breaks are detected in both UV-irradiated uvrC 34 and uvrC 56 cells. The number of <b>single-strand</b> breaks in these cells reaches a plateau at 20 -J/m 2 irradiation. Since these <b>single-strand</b> breaks can be detected by both alkaline sucrose and neutral formamide-sucrose gradient sedimentation, we concluded that the <b>single-strand</b> breaks observed in UV-irradiated uvrC cells are due to phosphodiester bond interruptions in DNA and are not due to apurinic/apyrimidinic sites...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Bonded {{retainers}} {{are used}} in orthodontics to maintain treatment result. Retention wires are prone to biofilm formation and cause gingival recession, bleeding on probing and increased pocket depths near bonded retainers. In this study, we compare in vitro and in vivo biofilm formation on different wires used for bonded retainers and the susceptibility of in vitro biofilms to oral antimicrobials. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Orthodontic wires were exposed to saliva, and in vitro biofilm formation was evaluated using plate counting and live/dead staining, together with effects of exposure to toothpaste slurry alone or followed by antimicrobial mouthrinse application. Wires were also placed intra-orally for 72 h in human volunteers and undisturbed biofilm formation was compared by plate counting and live/dead staining, {{as well as by}} denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis for compositional differences in biofilms. RESULTS: <b>Single-strand</b> wires attracted only slightly less biofilm in vitro than multi-strand wires. Biofilms on stainless steel <b>single-strand</b> wires however, were much more susceptible to antimicrobials from toothpaste slurries and mouthrinses than on <b>single-strand</b> gold wires and biofilms on multi-strand wires. Also, in vivo significantly less biofilm was found on <b>single-strand</b> than on multi-strand wires. Microbial composition of biofilms was more dependent on the volunteer involved than on wire type. CONCLUSIONS: Biofilms on <b>single-strand</b> stainless steel wires attract less biofilm in vitro and are more susceptible to antimicrobials than on multi-strand wires. Also in vivo, <b>single-strand</b> wires attract less biofilm than multi-strand ones. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Use of <b>single-strand</b> wires is preferred over multi-strand wires, not because they attract less biofilm, but because biofilms on <b>single-strand</b> wires are not protected against antimicrobials as in crevices and niches as on multi-strand wires...|$|R

5|$|As noted above, most DNA {{molecules}} {{are actually}} two polymer strands, bound {{together in a}} helical fashion by noncovalent bonds; this double-stranded (dsDNA) structure is maintained largely by the intrastrand base stacking interactions, which are strongest for G,C stacks. The two strands can come apart– {{a process known as}} melting– to form two <b>single-stranded</b> DNA (ssDNA) molecules. Melting occurs at high temperature, low salt and high pH (low pH also melts DNA, but since DNA is unstable due to acid depurination, low pH is rarely used).|$|E
5|$|At {{the ends}} of the linear {{chromosomes}} are specialized regions of DNA called telomeres. The main function of these regions is to allow the cell to replicate chromosome ends using the enzyme telomerase, as the enzymes that normally replicate DNA cannot copy the extreme 3′ ends of chromosomes. These specialized chromosome caps also help protect the DNA ends, and stop the DNA repair systems in the cell from treating them as damage to be corrected. In human cells, telomeres are usually lengths of <b>single-stranded</b> DNA containing several thousand repeats of a simple TTAGGG sequence.|$|E
5|$|DX arrays {{have been}} made to form hollow {{nanotubes}} 4–20nm in diameter, essentially two-dimensional lattices which curve back upon themselves. These DNA nanotubes are somewhat similar in size and shape to carbon nanotubes, and while they lack the electrical conductance of carbon nanotubes, DNA nanotubes are more easily modified and connected to other structures. One of many schemes for constructing DNA nanotubes uses a lattice of curved DX tiles that curls around itself and closes into a tube. In an alternative method that allows the circumference to be specified in a simple, modular fashion using <b>single-stranded</b> tiles, the rigidity of the tube is an emergent property.|$|E
5000|$|Helicase polarity, {{which is}} also deemed [...] "{{direction}}ality", {{is defined as the}} direction (characterized as 5'→3' or 3'→5') of helicase movement on the DNA/RNA <b>single-strand</b> along which it is moving. This determination of polarity is vital in f.ex. determining whether the tested helicase attaches to the DNA leading strand, or the DNA lagging strand. To characterize this helicase feature, a partially duplex DNA is used as the substrate that has a central <b>single-strand</b> DNA region with different lengths of duplex regions of DNA (one short region that runs 5'→3' and one longer region that runs 3'→5') {{on both sides of this}} region. Once the helicase is added to that central <b>single-strand</b> region, the polarity is determined by characterization on the newly formed <b>single-strand</b> DNA.|$|R
40|$|Three {{forms of}} DNA {{polymerase}} alpha [DNA nucleotidyltransferase (DNA-directed), EC 2. 7. 7. 7] were partially purified from the combined nuclear extract and postmicrosomal supernatant solution of synchronized HeLa cells. These enzymes, designated DNA polymerases alpha 1, alpha 2, and alpha 3, {{on the basis}} of their order of elution from DEAE-Bio-Gel, differ in their abilities to utilize <b>single-strand</b> DNA templates. DNA polymerase alpha 2 has equal catalytic activities with activated and <b>single-strand</b> DNAs as template-primers. DNA polymerase alpha 1 has only partial catalytic activity with <b>single-strand</b> DNA templates, and DNA polymerase alpha 3 is essentially inactive with this template. Successive steps of hydrophobic affinity chromatography and phosphocellulose chromatography of DNA polymerase alpha 2 resolved the polymerase alpha activity and two protein factors (C 1 and C 2) that are required for its catalytic activity with a DNA template-primer that contains extended <b>single-strand</b> regions. In the absence of the factors, DNA polymerase alpha activity is measurable with activated but not <b>single-strand</b> DNA templates. In the presence of the C 1 and C 2 factors DNA polymerase alpha activity with <b>single-strand</b> DNA templates is restored to about 75 % of the catalytic activity of DNA polymerase alpha 2 with this template...|$|R

5|$|HIV-1 {{infection}} causes chronic ongoing {{inflammation and}} production of reactive oxygen species. Thus, the HIV genome may be vulnerable to oxidative damages, including breaks in the <b>single-stranded</b> RNA. For HIV, {{as well as for}} viruses generally, successful infection depends on overcoming host defensive strategies that often include production of genome-damaging reactive oxygen. Thus, Michod et al. suggested that recombination by viruses is an adaptation for repair of genome damages, and that recombinational variation is a byproduct that may provide a separate benefit.|$|E
5|$|The RNAi pathway {{is found}} in many eukaryotes, {{including}} animals, and is initiated by the enzyme Dicer, which cleaves long double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) molecules into short double-stranded fragments of ~20 nucleotide siRNAs. Each siRNA is unwound into two <b>single-stranded</b> RNAs (ssRNAs), the passenger strand and the guide strand. The passenger strand is degraded and the guide strand is incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). The most well-studied outcome is post-transcriptional gene silencing, which occurs when the guide strand pairs with a complementary sequence in a messenger RNA molecule and induces cleavage by Argonaute 2 (Ago2), the catalytic component of the RISC complex. In some organisms, this process spreads systemically, despite the initially limited molar concentrations of siRNA.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} {{cellular}} signals activating the SOS response are regions of <b>single-stranded</b> DNA (ssDNA), arising from stalled replication forks or double-strand breaks, which are processed by DNA helicase {{to separate the}} two DNA strands. In the initiation step, RecA protein binds to ssDNA in an ATP hydrolysis driven reaction creating RecA–ssDNA filaments. RecA–ssDNA filaments activate LexA autoprotease activity, which ultimately leads to cleavage of LexA dimer and subsequent LexA degradation. The loss of LexA repressor induces transcription of the SOS genes and allows for further signal induction, inhibition of cell division {{and an increase in}} levels of proteins responsible for damage processing.|$|E

5|$|Archaea can be {{infected}} by double-stranded DNA viruses that are unrelated {{to any other}} form of virus and have a variety of unusual shapes, including bottles, hooked rods, or teardrops. These viruses have been studied in most detail in thermophilics, particularly the orders Sulfolobales and Thermoproteales. Two groups of <b>single-stranded</b> DNA viruses that infect archaea have been recently isolated. One group is exemplified by the Halorubrum pleomorphic virus 1 ("Pleolipoviridae") infecting halophilic archaea and the other one by the Aeropyrum coil-shaped virus ("Spiraviridae") infecting a hyperthermophilic (optimal growth at 90–95°C) host. Notably, the latter virus has the largest currently reported ssDNA genome. Defenses against these viruses may involve RNA interference from repetitive DNA sequences that are related to the genes of the viruses.|$|E
5|$|For most viruses with RNA genomes {{and some}} with <b>single-stranded</b> DNA genomes, the single strands {{are said to}} be either positive-sense (called the plus-strand) or negative-sense (called the minus-strand), {{depending}} on if they are complementary to the viral messenger RNA (mRNA). Positive-sense viral RNA is in the same sense as viral mRNA and thus at least a part of it can be immediately translated by the host cell. Negative-sense viral RNA is complementary to mRNA and thus must be converted to positive-sense RNA by an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase before translation. DNA nomenclature for viruses with single-sense genomic ssDNA is similar to RNA nomenclature, in that the template strand for the viral mRNA is complementary to it (−), and the coding strand is a copy of it (+). However, several types of ssDNA and ssRNA viruses have genomes that are ambisense in that transcription can occur off both strands in a double-stranded replicative intermediate. Examples include geminiviruses, which are ssDNA plant viruses and arenaviruses, which are ssRNA viruses of animals.|$|E
5|$|HIV is {{a member}} of the genus Lentivirus, part of the family Retroviridae. Lentiviruses have many morphologies and {{biological}} properties in common. Many species are infected by lentiviruses, which are characteristically responsible for long-duration illnesses with a long incubation period. Lentiviruses are transmitted as <b>single-stranded,</b> positive-sense, enveloped RNA viruses. Upon entry into the target cell, the viral RNA genome is converted (reverse transcribed) into double-stranded DNA by a virally encoded reverse transcriptase that is transported along with the viral genome in the virus particle. The resulting viral DNA is then imported into the cell nucleus and integrated into the cellular DNA by a virally encoded integrase and host co-factors. Once integrated, the virus may become latent, allowing the virus and its host cell to avoid detection by the immune system. Alternatively, the virus may be transcribed, producing new RNA genomes and viral proteins that are packaged and released from the cell as new virus particles that begin the replication cycle anew.|$|E
