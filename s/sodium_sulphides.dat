40|$|The use of <b>sodium</b> <b>sulphide</b> as an {{ingredient}} in the depilatory paint employed in the fellmongering of sheepskin is now almost universal. The <b>sodium</b> <b>sulphide</b> is in aqueous solution and is customarily thickened by the suspension of slaked lime in the solution, sufficient lime being added to make a paint which will adhere easily to the skin. This paint {{is applied to the}} inner side of the skin and its depilatory action is such as to allow the easy removal of the wool from the pelt within 24 - 36 hours. It is recognised that care is necessary in the making up of this paint. If the <b>sodium</b> <b>sulphide</b> solution is too strong the pelt will be damaged; in extreme cases holes will appear, leading to a burnt skin, and such cases are most common in warm weather. Although the active agent is <b>sodium</b> <b>sulphide</b> it is probable that the actual damage of a skin is due to free alkali, whether present as an impurity in the commercial sulphide or formed by the hydrolysis of the sulphide. Wilson (The Chemistry of Leather Manufacture. p. 284) to explain the mechanism of the sulphide depilation – states (1) there is a reaction between the protein keratin and the SH ion and (2) this reaction so alters the structure of the protein that the residues are more readily attacked by the OH ion. It was decided that an investigation of the alkalinity, hydrolysis, etc. of <b>sodium</b> <b>sulphide</b> would have some value. The writer undertook to investigate the use of the hydrogen electrodes in solutions of <b>sodium</b> <b>sulphide</b> in water, and in solutions of <b>sodium</b> <b>sulphide</b> to which has been added various other chemicals used in the manufacture of the depilatory paint...|$|R

The precursors used are cadmium acetate and <b>sodium</b> <b>sulphide</b> of analytic grade.

The samples are prepared by processing equimolar quantities of <b>sodium</b> <b>sulphide</b> and cadmium acetate in the glue medium, stirring continuously.

First they are trimmed of all unwanted pieces like legs, neck and tail then soaked in water to allow the skin tissues to distend. Next, a sodium sulfide solution is applied to the skin side of the fleece. The <b>sodium</b> <b>sulphide</b> soaks through the skin and destroys the follicles of the wool roots so that the fellmonger can then separate the wool from the skins. The wool is washed and dried. The skins are then soaked in a stronger solution of <b>sodium</b> <b>sulphide</b> and lime for 21 hours to remove small clumps of wool missed by the puller and to break down some internal proteins within the skin. The next process is called deliming: the skins are soaked in a solution of water and ammonium sulfate. This is to remove all the <b>sodium</b> <b>sulphide</b> from the skin and degraded proteins.

In this work, chemical and mineralogical investigations of EAF dust from Siderúrgica Rio-Grandense (RS, Brazil) were performed. The elements aluminum, calcium, lead, cadmium, chromium, magnesium, manganese, nickel, potassium, silicon, sodium, tin, iron, zinc, sulphur, oxygen, and carbon were found in EAF dust. The concentration of zinc and iron showed an average value of approximately 20 % (weight basis) and these elements are mainly present as ZnO.

The present study attempts to elucidate the optimum levels of various environmental factors for the culture of prawns. The salinity tolerance capacity of Penaeus (Melicertus) latisulcatus was estimated in 13 different test salinities from 0 to 60 ppt (at 5 ppt increments). The prawns can tolerate a wide salinity range of 20 - 50 ppt. Maximum survival, however, was between 25 to 45 ppt. The extreme low (0 - 10 ppt) and high (60 ppt) salinities were highly lethal to the prawns. The change in acclimation temperature from 30 to 35 Â°C increased the upper incipient lethal level from 38. 5 to 39. 5 Â°C. The prawns acclimated to 30 Â°C tolerated 42 Â°C for 275 sec and 45. 5 Â°C for 13 sec, while prawns acclimated to 35 Â°C tolerated 42 Â°C for 505 sec and 46. 5 Â°C for 11 sec.

Tetrathiomolybdate caused a shift in the chromatographic distribution of Cu from low molecular weight proteins such as metallothionein (MT) to proteins of higher molecular weight (greater than 100, 000 daltons). This was not due to polymerization or cross-linking of metallothionein with the latter, but to the formation of protein-TTM complexes that had a strong affinity for Cu. There was a concomitant redistribution of Zn towards proteins of low molecular weight. Pretreatment of high molecular weight proteins from rat liver with TTM greatly increased the capacity of the proteins to remove Cu from MT. When AM or <b>sodium</b> <b>sulphide</b> were added together to extracts of rat liver, changes similar to those induced by TTM were observed in the chromatographic distribution of Cu and Zn.

Background and aims: Production of luminal {{nitric oxide}} (NO) in the colon is {{significantly}} increased in ulcerative colitis (UC) due to bacterial metabolism or activated immune cells. The effect on tissues of prolonged elevation of nitric oxide is unknown. Formation of nitrosothiols has been discounted as these occur under acidic conditions which nevertheless may prevail in acute colitis. The {{aim was to}} measure nitrosothiol formation in colonocytes in acute colitis {{as well as to}} assess nitrosation of CoA in vitro. Materials and methods: Fresh rectal biopsies obtained at colonoscopies of cases with acute colitis, newly diagnosed or after recurrent attacks, were analysed. Exposure to glutaraldehyde/formaldehyde was avoided and samples stored in the dark at − 80 °C. After mechanical homogenization nitrosothiols were measured with the Saville-Griess reaction with and without exposure to mercuric chloride. The reaction with sulphanilamide was measured at 540 nm after azo dye coupling. By calibration curves with GSNO and tissue protein measurement (Bradford reaction) results were expressed as nmoles/mg protein. Purified samples of CoA were obtained for UV spectroscopic analysis after exposure to nitrite or <b>sodium</b> <b>sulphide.</b> Results: Nitrosothiols were not measureable in tissues exposed to formaldehyde. Nitrosothiol levels were 129. 3 ± 25. 6 (n = 6) in acute UC compared with healthy controls of 53. 2 ± 13. 8 (n = 6) (p < 0. 02).

Nitroso-CoA formation to a lesser degree occurred at higher pH (6. 9) but amplification with sulphide was not clearly identified. Conclusions: Elevated tissue nitrosothiols are found in association with acute colitis.

40|$|The {{requirement}} to rapidly and efficiently evaluate ruminant feedstuffs places {{increased emphasis on}} in vitro systems. However, despite the developmental work undertaken and widespread application of such techniques, {{little attention has been}} paid to the incubation medium. Considerable research using in vitro systems is conducted in resource-poor developing countries that often have difficulties associated with technical expertise, sourcing chemicals and/or funding to cover analytical and equipment costs. Such limitations have, to date, restricted vital feed evaluation programmes in these regions. This paper examines the function and relevance of the buffer, nutrient, and reducing solution components within current in vitro media, with the aim of identifying where simplification can be achieved. The review, supported by experimental work, identified no {{requirement to}} change the carbonate or phosphate salts, which comprise the main buffer components. The inclusion of microminerals provided few additional nutrients over that already supplied by the rumen fluid and substrate, and so may be omitted. Nitrogen associated with the inoculum was insufficient to support degradation and a level of 25 mg N/g substrate is recommended. A sulphur inclusion level of 4 - 5 mg S/g substrate is proposed, with S levels lowered through omission of <b>sodium</b> <b>sulphide</b> and replacement of magnesium sulphate with magnesium chloride. It was confirmed that a highly reduced medium was not required, provided that anaerobic conditions were rapidly established. This allows <b>sodium</b> <b>sulphide,</b> part of the reducing solution, to be omitted. Further, as gassing with CO 2 directly influences the quantity of gas released, it is recommended that minimum CO, levels be used and that gas flow and duration, together with the volume of medium treated, are detailed in experimental procedures. It is considered that these simplifications will improve safety and reduce costs and problems associated with sourcing components, while maintaining analytical precision. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V.
