5|$|On 17 October 1820, news arrived {{that the}} {{military}} garrisons in Portugal had mutinied, leading to {{what became known as}} the Liberal Revolution of 1820.

Pedro was surprised when his father not only asked for his advice, but also decided to send him to Portugal to rule as regent on his behalf and to placate the revolutionaries. The prince was never educated to rule and had previously been allowed no participation in state affairs. The role that was his by birthright was instead filled by his elder sister Dona Maria Teresa: JoãoVI had relied on her for advice, and it was <b>she</b> <b>who</b> had been given membership in the Council of State.|$|E
