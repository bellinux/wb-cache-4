5000|$|This species' {{scientific}} name honors Louis Antoine François Baillon. The <b>saffron</b> <b>toucanet</b> was originally {{described in the}} genus Ramphastos and has also been placed in the genus Andigena by some authorities. It was formerly placed in the monotypic genus Baillonius, but Kimura et al. (2004) were {{able to show that}} the <b>saffron</b> <b>toucanet</b> belongs in the genus Pteroglossus.|$|E
50|$|Baillon's crake {{is named}} for him, as is Baillon's shearwater and Baillonius bailloni (<b>saffron</b> <b>toucanet).</b>|$|E
5000|$|An aracari or araçari ( [...] , [...] or [...] )is {{any of the}} {{medium-sized}} toucans that, {{together with}} the <b>saffron</b> <b>toucanet,</b> make up the genus Pteroglossus.|$|E
50|$|One species, the {{distinctive}} <b>saffron</b> <b>toucanet,</b> was formerly {{placed in the}} monotypic genus Baillonius, but Kimura et al. (2004) showed that it belongs in the genus Pteroglossus.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>saffron</b> <b>toucanet</b> (Pteroglossus bailloni) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Ramphastidae found in the Atlantic Forest in far {{north-eastern}} Argentina, south-eastern Brazil, and eastern Paraguay.|$|E
50|$|The Itabira Natural Monument {{is in the}} {{municipality}} of Cachoeiro de Itapemirim, Espírito Santo.It has an area of 452 ha.The monument is 6 km from the municipal center.It includes the Pedra do Itabira, a striking vertical rock.The site includes overhanging rocks, fragments of Atlantic Forest and endangered birds such as the dusky-legged guan (Penelope obscura), Neotropical bellbird (genus Procnias), red-browed amazon (Amazona rhodocorytha) and <b>saffron</b> <b>toucanet</b> (Pteroglossus bailloni).It attracts tourists, mountain-bikers, hikers and mountaineers.|$|E
50|$|The diet of the saffron mainly {{consists}} of fruit, like figs and palm fruits. They {{have also been}} noted to eat young birds. In one study, a <b>saffron</b> <b>toucanet</b> was observed entering a red-rumped cacique nest, removing the nest contents by swallowing them, and flew away. All of this occurred within 30 seconds. It is thought that their smaller bodies helped them be able to perch on the nest, enter and exit quickly. Another study saw one unsuccessfully attempt to attack the nest of a White-spotted Woodpecker.|$|E
50|$|Chlamydophila psittaci, a {{parasitic}} {{agent that}} can be passed between avian species, was specifically studied in the <b>saffron</b> <b>toucanet,</b> along with several of its other relatives. It {{has been reported in}} many species of wild birds; however, physical symptoms are not prevalent with this disease. Lack of symptoms can therefore make this disease easier to spread to other birds and to humans. In the saffron, it had antibodies made to fight against this disease. There is a lack of study concerning the toucanet in veterinary literature, so there is an interest in further study.|$|E
50|$|The saffron {{is found}} in the Atlantic Forest. The viridis group, a {{superspecies}} group that includes the saffron, was separated from the other Pteroglossus group around 3 million years ago. The topologies observed in the study showed the <b>saffron</b> <b>toucanet</b> {{as a member of the}} Pteroglossus viridis group instead of a sister lineage to all other Pteroglossus. The saffron is separated from the other species in the viridis group by the Brazilian savanna biome. It is thought that this species is part of an ancient stock that became isolated in the current Atlantic Forest from marine transgression and were not able to adapt and invade the Brazilian savanna.|$|E
50|$|The <b>saffron</b> <b>toucanet</b> {{has been}} {{observed}} making nests beginning in October. The highest numbers of active nests were recorded in November. Their nests had a cavity depth of 20.0-68.0 cm, an entrance diameter of 4.3-7.4 cm, and a cavity height of 7.0-24.0 meters. Due to their small size, {{they do not need}} large cavities for their nests and they do not need to compete with other species for suitable spots. They prefer making their nests in living trees such as the Garapa (Apuleia leiocarpa) and the Aspidosperma australe. The diameter at breast height (DBH) was between 44-132 cm. They do not tend to reuse the same cavities for their nests.|$|E
40|$|Chlamydophila psittaci (C. psittaci) {{has been}} {{detected}} in 460 avian species, {{among them the}} most frequent are the Psittaciformes, Columbiformes, Anseriformes and raptors. In Brazil, the main avian species recognized as healthy carriers belong to the order Psittaciformes and Columbiformes, but very {{few studies have been}} done in other bird families. Reports of the occurrence of this disease in the clinical form are rare in the Ramphastids; consequently, they are not commonly evaluated for this agent. The present study reports the investigation of C. psittaci in 25 captive ramphastids from a zoological park in Sao Paulo State, Brazil. Swabs samples from the cloaca were submitted to semi-nested polymerase chain reaction (semi-nested PCR) for direct detection of the microorganism. Additionally, blood samples obtained from these birds were submitted to the Complement Fixation Test (CFT) for detection of antibodies anti-C. psittaci. The presence of C. psittaci was not detected in the cloacal swab samples tested by the PCR. Nevertheless, 16 % (4 / 25) of the bird's sera were positive by the CFT. Among the species with positive results, there are the <b>saffron</b> <b>toucanet</b> (Pteroglossus bailloni) and black-necked-aracari (Pteroglossus aracari), two species with no descriptions of the survey of C. psittaci published in the literature. Intermittent elimination of C. psittaci is a feature of chronically infected birds; however the absence of a positive-antigen sample did not guarantee that the bird is Chlamydophila-free. The serological results obtained show that the ramphastids tested were previously exposed to the pathogen and developed immune response, but showed no clinical signs of the disease and didn't eliminate regularly the organism in their feces in the moment of the sample collection...|$|E

Chlamydophila psittaci (C. psittaci) tem sido detectada em 460 espécies aviárias, dentre elas, as mais frequentes são os Psitaciformes, Columbiformes, Anseriformes e Falconifomes. No Brasil, as principais espécies reconhecidas como portadoras pertencem às Ordens Columbiformes e Psitaciformes, porém poucas pesquisas foram realizadas em aves de outras famílias. Em ranfastídeos, são raros os relatos da ocorrência da forma clínica dessa doença, consequentemente, não é um patógeno comumente investigado. O presente estudo relata a investigação de C. psittaci em 25 ranfastídeos cativos em um parque zoológico de São Paulo. Amostras de suabes colhidas da cloaca foram submetidas à reação em cadeia pela polimerase (PCR) para detecção direta do microrganismo. Adicionalmente, amostras de soro sanguíneo obtidas dessas aves foram submetidas à reação de Fixação do Complemento (RFC) para detecção dos anticorpos anti-C. psittaci. Não foi detectada a presença de C. psittaci em nenhuma das amostras de suabe cloacal testadas pela PCR. No entanto, 16 % (4 / 25) das amostras de soros foram positivas pela RFC. Entre as espécies com resultados positivos, estão o araçari-banana (Pteroglossus bailloni) e o araçari-de-bico-branco (Pteroglossus aracari), ambas sem publicações prévias relacionadas à C. psittaci. A eliminação intermitente de C. psittaci é uma característica de aves cronicamente infectadas, porém um resultado negativo para pesquisa do agente não significa necessariamente que a ave esteja livre do patógeno. Os resultados sorológicos obtidos demonstram que algumas aves tiveram contato prévio com o microrganismo e desenvolveram resposta imune, porém não apresentavam sinais clínicos evidentes de doença e não eliminavam o agente etiológico no momento da colheita da amostra...|$|E
