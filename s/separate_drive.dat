5|$|The Porsche hull designs {{included}} a rear-mounted turret and a mid-mounted engine. The suspension {{was the same}} as on the Elefant tank destroyer. This had six road wheels per side mounted in paired bogies sprung with short longitudinal torsion bars that were integral to the wheel pair; this saved internal space and facilitated repairs. One Porsche version had a gasoline-electric drive (fundamentally identical to a Diesel-electric transmission, only using a gasoline-fueled engine as the prime mover), similar to a gasoline-electric hybrid but without a storage battery; two <b>separate</b> <b>drive</b> trains in parallel, one per side of the tank, each consisting of a hybrid drive train; gasoline engine – electric generator – electric motor – drive sprocket. This method of propulsion had been attempted before on the Tiger (P) (later Elefant prototypes) and in some US designs, but had never been put into production. The Porsche suspension components were later used on a few of the later Jagdtiger tank destroyers. Another proposal was to use hydraulic drives. Dr. Porsche's unorthodox designs gathered little favour.|$|E

2500|$|Prompted by a {{perceived}} {{need for a}} simple, inexpensive all-terrain vehicle for oil exploration in North Africa, the French motor manufacturer Citroën developed the 2CV Sahara in 1958. Unlike other 4×4 vehicles which use a conventional transfer case to drive {{the front and rear}} axle, the Sahara had two engines, each independently driving a separate axle, with the rear engine facing backwards. The two throttles, clutches and gear change mechanisms could be linked, so the two [...] engines could run together, or they could be split and the car driven solely by either engine. Combined with twin fuel tanks and twin batteries (which could be set up to run either or both engines), the redundancy of two <b>separate</b> <b>drive</b> trains meant that they could make it back to civilization even after major mechanical failures. Only around 700 of these cars were built, and only 27 are known to exist today.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{takes the}} {{electric}} off-road vehicle with <b>separated</b> <b>driven</b> axles as the research object. To solve the longitudinal dynamics driving control problems, vehicle dynamics model, and control strategies were studied {{and the corresponding}} simulation was carried out. An 8 -DOF vehicle dynamics model with <b>separated</b> <b>driven</b> axles was built. The driving control strategies on the typical roads were put forward. The recognition algorithm of the typical road surfaces based on the wheels’ slip rates was proposed. And the two control systems were designed including the pedal opening degree adjustment control system based on PI algorithm and the interaxle torque distribution control system based on sliding mode control algorithm. The driving control flow of the proposed vehicle combining the pedal adjustment control system with the interaxle torque distribution control system was developed. And the driven control strategies for the typical roads were simulated. Simulation {{results show that the}} proposed drive control strategies can adapt to different typical road surfaces, limit the slip rates of the driving wheels within the stable zone, and ensure the vehicle driving safely and stably in accordance with the driver's intention...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The paper {{discusses}} {{about the}} issues of hardware design and interfacing of a self-developed robot assisted subtractive prototyping system. A four degrees of freedom robotic manipulator was driven by four alternative current (a. c.) brushless servomotors, which were controlled by <b>separate</b> <b>drives.</b> The drives received direction and distance signals from an indexer, which in turn was controlled by a user-developed software through a high specification personal computer (PC). The manipulator was used to hold and manipulate the model material (polystyrene) for ball nosed end milling process. The interfacing problem with a high-end PC has been rectified and all the manipulator axes moved synchronously. System has been tested for producing three-dimensional complex shaped model {{and the result was}} satisfactory. Generally, the system is effective, space and time saving, and can accomplish the entire computer aided design and manufacturing tasks...|$|R
50|$|In 1923 {{the first}} {{dedicated}} bus chassis was announced {{derived from the}} one used on the 25 cwt truck but with better springing. Bodies seating from 12 to 23 passengers were available. A lower frame chassis, the Model 26, with 30/60 hp engine and wheelbases from 135 in to 192 in joined the range in 1925. All the early vehicles had been normal control, with the engine {{in front of the}} driver but in 1927 the first forward control with the engine alongside the driver was announced as the Viking allowing 32 seats to be fitted. Diesel engines, initially from Gardner, were available from 1933. The first double deck design was the Venturer of 1932 with up to 51 seats. The CX version of the chassis was launched in 1937 and on these the engine and gearbox were mounted together rather than joined by a <b>separate</b> <b>drive</b> shaft. Albion's own range of diesel engines was also made available.|$|E

5000|$|Early systems used rotary coolers, {{which were}} {{rotating}} cylinders {{similar to the}} kiln, into which the hot clinker dropped. [...] The combustion air was drawn up through the cooler as the clinker moved down, cascading through the air stream. In the 1920s, satellite coolers became common and remained in use until recently. These consist of a set (typically 7-9) of tubes attached to the kiln tube. They have the advantage that they are sealed to the kiln, and require no <b>separate</b> <b>drive.</b> From about 1930, the grate cooler was developed. This consists of a perforated grate through which cold air is blown, enclosed in a rectangular chamber. A bed of clinker up to 0.5 m deep moves along the grate. These coolers have two main advantages: they cool the clinker rapidly, which is desirable from a quality point of view (to avoid that alite, thermodynamically unstable below 1250 °C, revert to belite and free CaO on slow cooling), and, {{because they do not}} rotate, hot air can be ducted out of them for use in fuel drying, or for use as precalciner combustion air. The latter advantage means that they have become the only type used in modern systems [...]|$|E
25|$|Mechanically {{the changes}} to the car had {{focussed}} on improving the traction, rather than increasing the already generous power. Double wheels and tyres were fitted to the rear axle, to improve grip. The final drive was also split into <b>separate</b> <b>drives</b> to each side. This reduced the load on each drive, allowed the driver position to be lowered, but required the wheelbase to be shortened asymmetrically on one side by 1½"(37mm). Airbrakes were fitted, actuated by a large air cylinder. For extra streamlining the radiator air intake could be closed by a movable flap, {{for a brief period}} during the record itself.|$|R

This self-reconfigurable robot consists of two types of fundamental modules, i. e., active and passive modules. By the docking system, two types of connections are formed with the fundamental modules, and the docking and undocking actions are achieved through simple control with less sensory feedback. This paper describes the design of the robotic modules, the docking system, the docking process, and the docking force analysis. An experiment is performed to demonstrate the self-reconfigurable robot with the docking system...|$|E

The 'Subject' also feels an inconsistency in his self, because his wife was {{a significant part of}} his own self-image. We claim that the answer is paradoxical, because it is his very action that causes him to be left absolutely alone. Such men explain that, by murdering the wife who wanted to leave, they are actually preserving or freezing the relationship as it was before she left.|$|R
