40|$|Artificial neural {{networks}} (ANNs) combined with automated image processing are bring {{used in a}} growing number of applications, ranging from car license plate identification to speech recognition. ANN analysis is capable of handling complicated images that cannot be dealt with using conventional image filters, such;as images originating from yeasts and bacteria adhering on turbid solids (silicone rubber or dental enamel) or metals. In this paper, a feed-forward ANN processing greyvalues from a 9 x 9 pixel microscope subimage, is presented for the image enhancement and subsequent enumeration of microorganisms adhering to solid substrata. The ANN developed is a simple software routine that can be implemented as a digital image filter in existing software and assists in locating the positions of adhering microorganisms. In order to evaluate the performance of the ANN, adhesion experiments were carried out in a parallel plate flow chamber with Candida albicans, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus thermophilus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Staphylococcus epidermidis, and polystyrene latex particles to different solid substrata under ideal and subideal illumination and focus of the microscope setup. The performance of the ANN-based enumerations was compared with the performance of nonneural, conventional image-processing methods and visual enumeration. For high-contrast images, nearly all, of the adhering organisms can be detected correctly after conventional image filtering. However, in the lower quality images which were employed in this study, for metal or <b>silicons</b> <b>rubber</b> substrate, image enhancement by the ANN yielded enumeration of the adhering bacteria with an accuracy of 93 %- 98 %, while using conventional image filters, an accuracy of 86 - 96 % was achieved. Adhering yeasts could be enumerated after conventional image filtering with an accuracy of 92 %, but after ANN enhancement, 98 % of the yeast cells adhering on silicone rubber substrata were enumerated correctly. It can be concluded that fur low quality and complicated images, ANNs perform better than conventional filters, while as additional advantages, the training of an ANN requires significantly less expert knowledge than optimal setting of conventional image filters, and an ANN can be used to distinguish between strains in adhesion experiments involving more than one strain.

50|$|There are {{two types}} of release agents used in the molding of rubber products. Both are {{silicone}} based. The decision on which to use has to do with lubricity and release. Water-diluted silicon is used when you have rubber sliding over a hot mold (sheets or slugs). The <b>silicon</b> keeps the <b>rubber</b> from sticking to the mold but just as important it lubricates the rubber so it will slide over the hot mold as it is loaded.

The matrix is created by the other ingredients in the semi-permanent mold release. Applications of semi-permanent mold release vary from every cycle to once daily applications depending on the compound being molded and the design and quality of the mold.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work was to explore the {{possibility}} of measuring properties of viscoelastic materials by nanoindentation. Indentation is not a common method for determining properties of viscoelastic materials and nanoindentation is a very new, state-of-the art technology. Therefore, this research is one of very few works in this area. This study includes nanoindentation experiments on viscoelastic materials, determining bulk properties of the same materials by conventional rheological techniques, suggesting of physical models to measure properties of viscoelastic solids and viscoelastic liquids by nanoindentation and numerical simulations of the nanoindentation process. The experimental part includes nanoindentation tests of viscoelastic solids and viscoelastic liquids and comparing measured local properties with the bulk ones. The bulk properties were measured with SAOS and Torsion tests. For this investigation polybutadiene was selected {{as an example of}} a viscoelastic liquid and <b>silicon</b> cross-linked <b>rubber</b> as a viscoelastic solid. It was found that the local properties of solid polymers vary widely. However, by averaging data collected from various locations, the bulk properties can be determined accurately for the viscoelastic solids. For the physical modeling we validated the Sneddon & Sakai model of indentation of viscoelastic solids and suggested a model for the indentation of viscoelastic liquids, based on Stoke's theory of a potential flow around a sphere. Also nanoindentation of a viscous liquid was simulated using the FLUENT commercial code. It was found that for the indentation of viscoelastic materials with dominantly viscous properties, the indentation model developed from Stoke's theory gives realistic values for shear forces, but predicts a smaller than actual compression force, acting on the surface of the indenter. The comparison of the results of the mentioned above different approaches allowed us to draw conclusions about the advantages and limitation of the technology and theoretical analysis of nanoindentation and its application in rheometry. It was shown that nanoindentation can be successfully used for investigation of viscoelastic materials. Because of its unique abilities nanoindentation will become an irreplaceable tool in such areas as the testing of thin films, study of materials in a transient states, and biomedical research. However, there are number of technical and theoretical issues that need to be addressed. We outlined issues that need to be resolved and suggested direction for further research and development. Among them are: selection of a proper model to simulate behavior of particular viscoelastic material, further improvement of indentation control and data acquisition system, manufacturing new indenters of optimum shape and materia...|$|R
40|$|Nanotechnology has a {{steadily}} increasing impact on worldwide research and business activities. This work explores advanced micro/nano patterning approaches for molecular manipulation. The objectives are to (1) build a proper bridge {{from a few}} microns to the 100 - 10 nm range and below {{as well as to}} (2) combine “top-down” precise design with the “bottom-up” size scale to create designed surfaces, areas and volumes that can interact with molecules in a designed way. Three studies were designed and studied accordingly. The first investigation demonstrates that “top-down” Inclined Nanoimprinting Lithography (INIL) is able to produce three-dimensional (3 -D) nanopatterns of varying heights in a single step. INIL reduces pattern's feature size from microns to nanometers. The degree of resulting nanopattern's asymmetry can be controlled by the magnitude of the inclination angle. Various 3 -D nanostructures are successfully demonstrated including nanolines, nanocircles and nanosquares. The underlying INIL mechanism is investigated, which is primarily due to the induced shear force when the inclination angle is not zero. This leads to the anisotropic dewetting of polymer fluid and consequently asymmetric 3 D nanopatterns of varying heights. INIL removes the need of preparation of expensive 3 D nanotemplates or multiple template-to-substrate alignments. In addition, such 3 -D structures are successfully transferred to <b>silicon,</b> silicone <b>rubber</b> and metal gold. INIL enables 3 D nano-scale devices including angle-resolved photonic and plasmonic crystals. The second investigation demonstrates the success of “bottom-up” molecular imprinting of X-ray contrast agent iodixanol in polymer matrix. The synthetic tailor-made molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) are poly(4 -vinylpyridine-co-ethylene glycol dimethacrylate) which possess specific binding sites induced by the template molecules of X-ray contrast agent iodixanol. It leads the feature size reduction from macromolecules to molecular scale. The properly imprinted binding sites also leads MIPs to have improved absorption capacity and efficiency for X-ray contrast agent iodixanol relative to non-imprinted polymers. The best binding capacity achieved from the optimized MIPs was 284 mg/g in aqueous solution, 8. 8 times higher than that of the non-imprinted polymers. The best binding capacity obtained in sheep plasma was 232 mg/g, 4. 5 times higher than the non-imprinted polymers. The factors that may affect the binding performance of MIPs in aqueous media are studied. The optimized MIPs are encouraging for biomedical implementations including dialysis and nanosensors. The third investigation of nanolithography-based molecular manipulation (NMM) explores a hybrid approach by combining “top-down” electron-beam lithography (EBL) with “bottom-up” surface initiated polymerization (SIP). It reduces the nanopattern's feature size to sub- 10 nm and simultaneously tunes its surface chemistry through functional polymer brushes. The process has reduced process complexity and cost. The demonstrated prototype molecular manipulation templates have 3 D surface nanostructures with sub- 10 nm feature size and anisotropic surface functionalities. They mimic biocatalyst enzymes to “bottom-up” assemble nanoparticle targets at specific locations producing 3 D nanostructures in a designated way. Various 3 D synthetic nanostructures have been demonstrated including polystyrene “nanomushrooms” “nanospikes”, “nanofibers” and polystyrene-iron oxide “nanoflowers”. Potential applications of these synthetic 3 D nanostructures can be improved therapeutic agents. This hybrid strategy realizes the integration of “top-down” design with “bottom-up” molecular scale to create designed nanopatterned surfaces that can interact with molecules in a designated way.

40|$|In {{designing}} {{carbon capture}} and geological storage, the long-term behavior of stored CO 2 {{in the underground}} geological formation is a crucial issue to be carefully considered. This {{is because of the}} fact that the injection of CO 2 into the formation would impact rock formation integrity, reactivating pre-existing fractures and reopening seal that eventually lead to potential CO 2 leakage to the underlying groundwater containing layers and the surface. Therefore, the deformation of the reservoir rock during injection of supercritical CO 2 needs to be well understood and defined while designing the project. 	 	In this paper, we developed an experimental design using a newly developed flow pump permeability test to measure the change of strain and stress on the Ainoura sandstone cores under the injection of supercritical CO 2. The experiment was set up to reproduce the similar condition of deep underground reservoir with 20 MPa confining pressure, 10 MPa pore pressure, 35 ??C temperature and 3 ??l/min CO 2 injection rate. As CO 2 was injected to the specimen, the hydraulic pressure increased and generated a stress alteration. The strain in the core was monitored. The injection was halted at 15. 3 MPa hydraulic pressures over the period of 565. 9 hours since the hydraulic pressure can reach the confining pressure applied on the core and this may break the <b>silicon</b> on the <b>rubber</b> sleeves covering the core. Therefore, in order to model the hydromechanical response of the core during the injection as well as to predict the strain propagated beyond the injection period measured in the experiment, a numerical investigation using coupling hydromechanical simulation was conducted. In this exercise, we employed a two phase flow reservoir simulator of TOUGH 2 (ECO 2 N) coupled with rock mechanics computation of FLAC 3 D. A core specimen, with the rock properties and initial conditions similar to the experimental data, was generated and supercritical CO 2 injection with a constant rate of 3. 56 ?? 10 - 8 kg/s was simulated. It was observed that, the increased hydraulic pressure and strain shown in the numerical simulation have well agreement with the experimental result. The results also indicated that, during injection, the hydraulic pressure on the core increased transiently, and became constant at almost 60 MPa over the period of 5833 hours. The core specimen deformed elastically due to the increase of pore pressure caused by injection. The deformation of the specimen would not propagate failure even if the pore pressure exceeds the confining pressure applied on it. The results confirmed that the injection of supercritical CO 2 into low permeable rocks has considerable effects on the integrity of low permeable rocks even at low flow rates...|$|R

In addition, detecting the diffusion of the low-molecular-weight siloxane from the bulk to the surface can be utilized to indicate the relative ability to recover hydrophobicity after aging.

The effluents were fractionated by thin-layer chromatography (TLC), and their fractions {{were analyzed by}} ion trap electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). The ESI mass spectra resulting from the main TLC fraction, R 1 = 0. 5 showed that the effluents were determined to be poly(dimethyl siloxane) (8 to 20 mer) that is a main part of a <b>silicon</b> <b>rubber.</b> The spectra for the origin in TLC showed that poly(ethylene glycol) (4 to 10 mer and 14 to 18 mer) and poly- (propylene glycol) (19 to 36 mer) as an antistatic agent were identified...|$|E
