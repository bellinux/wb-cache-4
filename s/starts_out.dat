5|$|One of Black & Whites core {{features}} is {{the interaction}} between the player and an avatar creature. Three are available to select {{from the beginning of the}} game and others can be obtained by completing Silver Reward Scrolls. The currently-owned creature can be swapped with a new one at certain points in the game. The creature <b>starts</b> <b>out</b> small, and grows as the game progresses. Each has strengths and weaknesses: apes are intelligent and proficient at learning but lack strength; tigers are strong but learn slowly.|$|E
5|$|Riki (Known as Coon in the Japanese release) is a Lummox, a fox-like creature, {{and one of}} {{the last}} {{remaining}} inhabitants of the mysterious world, Margmel. Determined to save his homeworld, he seeks the Rings of Margmel. In his search, he <b>starts</b> <b>out</b> in Scrap, where he finds the researcher Mei-ling. Riki's quest takes him around the regions to gather the Rings until he comes face to face with Virgil, a Mystic Lord. Following the battle, Riki returns home to attempt to restore Margmel.|$|E

5|$|The story <b>starts</b> <b>out</b> as {{a fairly}} {{conventional}} adventure at sea, but it becomes increasingly strange {{and hard to}} classify. Poe, who intended to present a realistic story, was inspired by several real-life accounts of sea voyages, and drew heavily from Jeremiah N. Reynolds and referenced the Hollow Earth theory. He also drew from his own experiences at sea. Analyses of the novel often focus on the potential autobiographical elements as well as hints of racism and the symbolism in the final lines of the work.|$|E
5|$|Beilein {{is known}} for his Princeton {{offensive}} system, which emphasizes constant motion, passing, disciplined teamwork, and precision shooting. The offense usually <b>starts</b> <b>out</b> with four players outside the three-point arc, and one player {{at the top of the}} key (though at times a post player may operate closer to the basket). From this formation, Beilein's teams not only try to open up space for players to cut to the basket, but also are known for their high number of three-point attempts. On defense, Beilein has become known for employing the 1–3–1 halfcourt zone defense, which is considered to be an unconventional zone defense – though he also regularly employs man-to-man and 2-3 zone defenses.|$|E
5|$|In Fig.2, the {{corresponding}} {{part of the}} revolving orbit is mn with s as its centre of force. Assume that initially, {{the body in the}} static orbit <b>starts</b> <b>out</b> at right angles to the radius with speed V. The body in the revolving orbit must also start at right angles and assume its speed is v. In the case shown in Fig. 1., v > V and the force is directed towards S. The argument applies equally if v < V. Also, the force may be directed away from the centre.|$|E

5|$|Jo-ha-kyū is {{incorporated}} in traditional five-play program of Noh. The first play is jo, the second, third, and fourth plays are ha, and the fifth play is kyū. In fact, the five categories discussed below were created so that the program would represent jo-ha-kyū when one play from each category is selected and performed in order. Each play can be broken into three parts, the introduction, the development, and the conclusion. A play <b>starts</b> <b>out</b> in a slow tempo at jo, gets slightly faster at ha, then culminates in kyū.|$|E
5|$|Tbr1, {{along with}} Pax6 and Tbr2, {{has a role}} in glutamatergic {{projection}} neuron differentiation. Glutamatergic neurons make and release in an activity-dependent manner the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate {{as opposed to the}} inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA. The transition from radial glial cells to postmitotic projection neurons occurs in three steps, each associated with one of the aforementioned transcription factors. The first <b>starts</b> <b>out</b> with the expression of Pax6 in radial glial cells found primarily at the ventricular surface. In the next step, Pax6 is downregulated and Tbr2 is expressed as the cell differentiates into an intermediate progenitor cell. Likewise, in the final step, Tbr2 is extremely downregulated to undetectable levels as Tbr1 signals the transition into a postmitotic projection neuron.|$|E
5|$|US 5 {{begins on}} State Street at exit 5 of Interstate 91 in New Haven. State Street {{continues}} southwest into downtown as a local, unnumbered street. US 5 <b>starts</b> <b>out</b> as an undivided four-lane road becoming two lanes just before crossing into Hamden. State Street continues north through Hamden {{and the industrial}} section of North Haven, closely paralleling the Amtrak railroad tracks {{on the west side}} of the Quinnipiac River. It has an interchange with Route 40 in this area. US 5 then turns right at the intersection with Bishop Street in North Haven and crosses the Quinnipiac River, the railroad tracks, and I-91 (at exit 11) overlapped with Route 22 on a four-lane wide road.|$|E

5|$|Formed by the {{confluence}} of three tiny headstreams on the southwest flank of Two Oceans Plateau in western Wyoming and Yellowstone National Park, the Snake <b>starts</b> <b>out</b> as a small river flowing west and south into Jackson Lake. Its first 50 miles (80 km) run through the valley of Jackson Hole, which cuts between the Teton Range and the Continental Divide. The Snake takes a large bend northwest through Snake River Canyon, cutting through the Snake River Range and into eastern Idaho, receiving first the Hoback and Greys rivers before entering Palisades Reservoir. There it is also met by the Salt River {{at the mouth of}} Star Valley. After passing through Palisades Dam, the Snake River flows through the Snake River Plain, a vast physiographic province extending through southern Idaho across the massif of the Rocky Mountains and underlain by the Snake River Aquifer, one of the most productive aquifers in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Generally, {{the player}} <b>starts</b> <b>out</b> with a Dungeon Heart and some Imps. The Dungeon Heart {{has the same}} purpose as the {{original}} game: it serves as the dungeon's life force. If destroyed, the player loses. In Dungeon Keeper 2, the heart has additional functions: regenerating mana (used to cast spells), doubling as a gold-storage area, producing Imps, and sending certain creatures to investigate threats it detects. Gold is the currency used to construct rooms, traps, and doors, and pay minions. Gold is obtained primarily by digging gold and gem seams, the latter providing an unlimited supply. This is performed by the Imps, the main workforce of the dungeon, who dig and claim tiles for the player to control. Another main task Imps perform is the fortification of walls adjacent to tiles owned by the player, although this no longer makes them impenetrable to enemies, but merely makes digging take longer.|$|E
5|$|In Wonder Boy in Monster Land, players control Wonder Boy as he {{destroys the}} monsters in Monster Land and defeats the MEKA dragon. When the player begins the game, Wonder Boy <b>starts</b> <b>out</b> in the City of Wonder Land without any items or gold, {{but to give}} him a chance, at the {{beginning}} of the game, the city's mayor gives him a sword and a revival potion and sets him off on his own. The game is divided into twelve levels, and each of them has its own unique features, items, monsters, and secrets. These levels include towns, valleys, deserts, islands, and castles. Players use the D-pad to move Wonder Boy on the main screen, to enter doors by pressing upward, and to use Magic Weapons by pressing downward. The D-pad is also used to select between various items when in a shop. Players also have two buttons: one which makes Wonder Boy attack with his sword and buy items in the shop; and one which makes Wonder Boy jump and skip through storylines.|$|E

5|$|In the series, Clark Kent {{attempts}} {{to live the}} life of a normal human being, and struggles with keeping the secret of his alien heritage from his friends. He has an on-again, off-again relationship with Lana Lang through the first seven seasons, the trials of which are based on his lack of honesty about his secret. In contrast to previous incarnations of the character, this Clark Kent <b>starts</b> <b>out</b> best friends with Lex Luthor, whom he meets after saving the latter's life. The pair's friendship eventually deteriorates into hatred for one another. In Smallville, Clark's powers appear over time, as he is not aware of all of them {{at the start of the}} show; for instance, his heat vision and super breath do not develop until season two and six, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Originally, {{the game}} was {{supposed}} to be developed for the PlayStation 3, but due to the long wait for the PS3, {{the game was}} developed for the PlayStation 2 instead. From the outset, the games director Hideo Kojima wished to drastically change the setting from previous games. He stated that the jungle setting is what both his development team, and the Metal Gear fans, wanted. However, he acknowledged that the elements of a jungle environment, such as the weather, landscape and wildlife, were features that would present problems during the game's development. Whereas in previous installments the player <b>starts</b> <b>out</b> close to, or even within, the enemy base, Kojima wished Snake Eater to be more realistic, with Snake starting out miles from civilization and having to work his way to the enemy encampment.|$|E
5|$|Protandry is when an {{individual}} <b>starts</b> <b>out</b> male and becomes female while the reverse condition is known as protogyny, the latter being more common. Changing sex can occur in various contexts. In the bluestreak cleaner wrasse, where males have harems of up to ten females, if the male is removed {{the largest and most}} dominant female develops male-like behaviour and eventually testes. If she is removed, the next ranking female takes her place. In the species Anthias squamipinnis, where individuals gather into large groups and females greatly outnumber males, if a certain number of males are removed from a group, the same number of females change sex and replace them. In clownfish, individuals live in groups and only the two largest in a group breed: the largest female and the largest male. If the female dies, the male switches sexes and the next largest male takes his place.|$|E

5|$|Maho is Shuichi's sister. She is {{one year}} older than Shuichi is, and at the {{beginning}} of Wandering Son, she is in the sixth grade of elementary school. Maho shows a strong interest in clothes, and spends much of her money on new apparel. She is a big fan of a teen fashion model named Maiko, and to meet her, Maho auditions for the same modeling agency as Maiko. After she is hired and becomes recognized as a model, Maho enjoys being asked her autograph by complete strangers. While her modeling career initially <b>starts</b> <b>out</b> slowly, Maho soon gains confidence in her abilities, and becomes friends with Maiko and two other models, Anna Suehiro and Tamaki Satō. In contrast to her younger sibling, Maho is very out-spoken and tends to be rough with Shuichi, even hitting or slapping Shuichi on occasion, and she often forces things on Shuichi with little consideration of Shuichi's opinion. She does not like Shuichi's cross-dressing and gets angry and disturbed when she finds Shuichi dressed as a girl. In junior high school, Maho becomes attracted to her classmate Riku Seya, and eventually starts dating him.|$|E
5|$|Mycologist Dennis McCabe {{studied the}} {{development}} of the fruit body using specimens grown in pure culture. Starting out as a hyphal tuft, the fungus grows into a cup shape before eventually closing in completely to create the spherical structure of the mature fruit body. When the fungus is in the cup stage, the exposed hymenium is immature; typically, spores develop after the fruit body is fully closed. In some cases, the fruit body stops developing at the cup stage while the hymenium continues to mature. This results in a cup-shaped fungus with an exposed layer of basidia bearing normal and mature spores. Limnoperdon incarnatum is a structurally simple fungus, and relatively easy to grow in culture, suggesting it may have potential as a model organism for fruit body development in general. Under the experimental conditions used, fruit bodies matured to produce spores about 72 hours after the fungus started growing. The aborted cups resemble the sporocarps of the cyphelloid fungi, but can be distinguished by their orthotrophic spore attachment and the lack of ballistospory (forceful spore discharge). McCabe and Escobar later suggested that the fungus may have evolved the loss of ballistospory by being compensated with the cup-shaped fruit body closing at maturity. Halocyphina villosa is another small cup-shaped Basidiomycete fungus that has adapted to a marine environment; in contrast to L.incarnatum, however, it <b>starts</b> <b>out</b> with a closed fruit body that later opens up to become cup-shaped.|$|E
5|$|The player {{directly}} {{controls the}} character Lightning through a third-person perspective {{to interact with}} people, objects, and enemies throughout the game. The player can also turn the camera around the character, which allows for a 360° view of the surroundings. The world of Lightning Returns, as with Final Fantasy XIII and its sequel XIII-2, is rendered to scale with the character, who navigates the world on foot. In one of the areas, the player can use chocobos, a recurring animal in the Final Fantasy series. The player is able to freely navigate the game's open world layout, explore towns and country areas, and accept quests from various non-playable characters (NPCs). Lightning is also able to sprint for limited periods, climb up ladders and jump freely. The game features three difficulty levels: Easy, Normal and Hard, the latter of which is unlocked after first completing the game. There is also a New Game+ option, whereby players can start a new game while carrying over their equipment and stats from a previous playthrough. The in-game clock runs continuously during normal navigation, with one in-game day equating to {{two to three hours}} in real time on Easy mode and one hour on Normal and Hard modes. The timer <b>starts</b> <b>out</b> at seven in-game days, but can be extended to a maximum of thirteen days. The timer stops during cutscenes, conversations and battles. Lightning can also pause time using an ability called Chronostasis.|$|E
