40|$|Common Variability Language (CVL) is {{a recent}} {{proposal}} for OMG's upcoming Variability Modeling standard. CVL models variability in terms of Model Fragments.   Usability is a widely-recognized quality criterion essential to warranty the successful use of tools that put these ideas in practice. Facing the need of evaluating the usability of CVL modeling tools, this paper presents a Usability Evaluation of CVL applied to a Modeling Tool for firmware code of Induction Hobs. This evaluation addresses the configuration, <b>scoping</b> <b>and</b> visualization facets. The evaluation involved the end users of the tool whom are engineers of our Induction Hob industrial partner. Effectiveness and efficiency results indicate that model configuration in terms of model fragment substitutions is intuitive enough but both <b>scoping</b> <b>and</b> visualization require improved tool support. Results also enabled us to identify a list of usability problems which may contribute to alleviate <b>scoping</b> <b>and</b> visualization issues in CVL...|$|R
5|$|A notable recent {{development}} in Philosophy of Psychology is Functional Contextualism or Contextual Behavioural Science (CBS). Functional Contextualism {{is a modern}} philosophy of science rooted in philosophical pragmatism and contextualism. It is most actively developed in behavioral science in general, the field of behavior analysis, and contextual behavioral science in particular (see the entry for the Association for Contextual Behavioral Science). Functional contextualism serves {{as the basis of}} a theory of language known as relational frame theory and its most prominent application, acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT). It is an extension and contextualistic interpretation of B.F. Skinner's radical behaviorism first delineated by Steven C. Hayes which emphasizes the importance of predicting and influencing psychological events (including thoughts, feelings, and behaviors) with precision, <b>scope,</b> <b>and</b> depth, by focusing on manipulable variables in their context.|$|E
5|$|After his {{establishment}} in Aleppo, in winter 945–946, Sayf al-Dawla resumed the old Muslim custom of launching annual raids into Byzantine territory. This first operation was of limited <b>scope</b> <b>and</b> {{was followed by}} a prisoner exchange. Warfare on Byzantium's eastern frontiers then subsided for a couple of years, and recommenced only in 948. Initially, the Byzantines were led by the Domestic of the Schools (commander-in-chief) Bardas Phokas the Elder, but although he was capable enough as a subordinate commander, his tenure as commander-in-chief proved largely a failure. In 948–950 the Byzantines scored a few successes, sacking the border fortresses of Hadath and Marash. Bardas' second son, Leo, distinguished himself in these years, especially in November 950, when he ambushed Sayf al-Dawla, who had previously defeated his father in battle, in a mountain pass; Sayf al-Dawla lost 8,000 men and barely escaped himself.|$|E
5|$|Bardanes's revolt {{temporarily}} weakened Byzantium, {{especially in}} its capability {{to deal with}} the Arab threat to the East, but Qasim's invasion was of limited <b>scope,</b> <b>and</b> his father's far larger intervention shortly after also resulted in no major military confrontations: Harun withdrew after a truce was concluded in exchange for a modest sum. Thus the revolt did not seriously affect the army or most of Anatolia. Nevertheless, it is indicative of the soldiers' dissatisfaction with Nikephoros, which would surface again in subsequent years and prove a constant source of trouble throughout his reign.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{addresses the}} challenges of <b>scoping</b> <b>and</b> sizing components and modeling the tank to wheel energy flows in new and rapidly evolving classes of automotive vehicles. It introduces a system of computer models, known as the Oxford Vehicle Model (OVEM), which provide for the novel simulation of the powertrains of electric (EV) and hybrid electric vehicles (HEV). OVEM has a three-level structure that makes a unique contribution {{to the field of}} vehicle analysis by enabling a user to proceed from performing <b>scoping</b> <b>and</b> sizing exercises through to accurately simulating the energy flows in powertrains of EVs and HEVs utilizing existing and emerging technologies based on real world data. Level 1 uses simplified models to support initial component <b>scoping</b> <b>and</b> sizing exercises in an analysis environment where uncertainty regarding component specifications is high. Level 2 builds on Level 1 by obtaining more refined component <b>scoping</b> <b>and</b> sizing estimates via the use of component models based on well-understood scientific principles that are product-independent – a crucial feature for obtaining unbiased <b>scoping</b> <b>and</b> sizing estimates. Level 3 employs a high degree of fidelity in that its models impose actual physical limits and are based on data from real technologies. This dissertation concludes with two chapters based on studies published as journal articles that used OVEM to address key issues facing the development of EVs and HEVs. The first study used OVEM to make the novel comparison between high-speed flywheels, batteries, and ultracapacitors on the bases of cost and fuel consumption while functioning as the energy storage systems in an HEV. The second study applied OVEM towards a novel examination of the CO 2 emissions from plug-in HEVs (PHEVs) and compares their CO 2 emissions to those from similar EVs and ICE-based vehicles.
