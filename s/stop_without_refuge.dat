Utilizaram-se 1. 000 larvas com peso e comprimento inicial de 62, 2 mg e 18, 02 mm, respectivamente, distribuídas em 20 aquários de 35 L, durante 22 dias. Os tratamentos consistiram dos ambientes: escuro sem refúgio, claro com refúgio {{artificial}}, escuro com refúgio artificial, claro com refúgio natural e claro sem refúgio, com quatro repetições cada, distribuídos em delineamento inteiramente casualizado. As larvas receberam a mesma alimentação em todos os tratamentos. As melhores taxas de sobrevivência foram verificadas nos ambientes: escuro sem refúgio, claro com refúgio natural e claro sem refúgio, com 84, 76 e 70 %, respectivamente. O melhor desenvolvimento das larvas ocorreu em ambiente escuro e sem refúgio. O tratamento escuro com refúgio artificial apresentou diferenças significativas em relação à sobrevivência e ao peso final dos outros tratamentos, com grande heterogeneidade quanto ao peso. Ambientes escuros e sem refúgios são os mais adequados para o desenvolvimento inicial de larvas de surubim do Iguaçu. The {{influence of}} luminosity {{and of the}} use of refuges on the initial development of Steindachneridion sp. Garavello (Siluriforme: Pimelodidae) larvae was evaluated. A thousand larvae 18. 02 mm high and 62. 2 mg weight were used in an entirely randomized design, with five treatments and four replicates, in 35 L-aquarium during 22 days. The treatments consisted on the following environments: darkness <b>without</b> <b>refuges,</b> clear with artificial refuge, darkness with artificial refuge, clear with natural <b>refuge</b> and clear <b>without</b> <b>refuge.</b> All larvae received the same feeding during the experiment. The best survival rates were found for darkness <b>without</b> <b>refuges,</b> clear with artificial <b>refuge</b> and clear <b>without</b> <b>refuge,</b> with 84, 76 and 70 %, respectively. The best development was in darkness and <b>without</b> <b>refuges.</b> The treatment darkness with artificial refuge provided significant differences in relation to the other treatments as far as survival and weight are concerned, showing high heterogeneity for weight.
