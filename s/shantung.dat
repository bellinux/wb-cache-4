5|$|Little {{thought was}} given to the Chinese {{reaction}} to the Open Door note; the Chinese minister in Washington, Wu Ting-fang, did not learn of it until he read of it in the newspapers. Among those in China who opposed Western influence there was a movement in <b>Shantung</b> Province, in the north, that became known as the Fists of Righteous Harmony, or Boxers, after the martial arts they practiced. The Boxers were especially angered by missionaries and their converts. As late as June 1900, Rockhill dismissed the Boxers, contending that they would soon disband. By the middle of that month, the Boxers, joined by imperial troops, had cut the railroad between Peking and the coast, killed many missionaries and converts, and besieged the foreign legations. Hay faced a precarious situation; how to rescue the Americans trapped in Peking, and how to avoid giving the other powers an excuse to partition China, in an election year when there was already Democrat opposition to what they deemed American imperialism.|$|E

Tsingtao (Qingdao) was its administrative center. After the farmers and fishermen of the Chinese village sold their buildings and land and resettled in the rural communities further east, the Germans began to develop the area. Wide streets, solid housing areas, government buildings, electrification throughout, a sewer system and a safe drinking water supply were improvements that transformed the impoverished fishing village of Tsingtao into a modern German town. In a short time the area had the highest density of schools and per capita student enrollment in all of China; primary, secondary and vocational schools were funded by the Imperial German treasury and Protestant and Roman Catholic missions.|$|E

The division was able to start a counter-attack on 2 December 1939 as part of the Shandong Operation. After the offensive, the 32nd Division was garrisoned at Jinan.|$|E
25|$|Operation Beleaguer {{was a major}} United States {{military}} operation {{that took place in}} northeastern China's Hopeh and <b>Shantung</b> Provinces between 1945 and 1949. The main objectives of the operation were the repatriation of more than 600,000 Japanese and Koreans, who remained in China after the end of World War II, and the protection of American lives and property. During the course of nearly four years, American forces engaged in several small battles with the Communists, and they were successful in repatriating and evacuating thousands of foreign nationals. The United States government also attempted to mediate a peace treaty with the opposing Nationalist and Communist forces, but the effort was unsuccessful.|$|E
25|$|IIIAC was {{preparing}} for the invasion of Japan {{when the war ended}} on September 2, 1945. Within the next forty-eight hours, IIIAC received new orders to ship out to China.

The 1st Marine Aircraft Wing would move its planes and men to airfields in the Tsingtao, Tientsin, and Peking areas, and commitment of the entire corps in the Shanghai region was assigned as an alternate mission. Tentative plans for these operations were issued on August 29, setting the mounting-out date for September 15. The 3rd Marine Division on Guam and the 4th Marine Division on Maui were designated area reserve for the operation.|$|E
25|$|The formal {{surrender}} of the 10,000-strong Japanese garrison of Tsingtao {{took place at}} the city's racecourse on October 25, before the assembled troops of the 6th Division. General Shepherd and Lieutenant General Chen Pao-tsang, Chiang Kai-shek's representative, took the surrender {{in the name of the}} Chinese government. However, despite the surrender, Japanese troops in certain areas were still required to man their positions, and thus defend against any Communist attacks. Clashes between the communists and the Japanese and former puppet troops were frequent in <b>Shantung</b> during October, and at General Shepherd's request, planes of Marine Air Group 32 (MAG-32) started regular reconnaissance patrols on October 26 to check the status of the rail lines and their Japanese guards and to insure adequate warning of any Communist move against Tsingtao. The flight echelon of MAG-32 reached Tsingtao on October 21, and it was followed soon after the planes of MAG-12, which was flying from the Philippines to its new base at Peking. By the end of October, elements of all the wing's major units had landed in China. MAG-12 and MAG-24 were established at Peking's airfields, MAG-25 and MAG-32 were stationed at Tsingtao together with the wing's personnel reception and processing center. Major General Louis E. Woods arrived in Tientsin on October 31 to assume command of the wing from Major General Claude E. Larkin.|$|E
500|$|The cathedral {{was built}} by the Divine Word Missionaries (abbreviated [...] "SVD," [...] from their Latin name: Societas Verbi Divini), the first German Catholic missionary society. The order was founded in 1875 [...] "for the {{propagation}} of the Catholic religion among pagan nations," [...] at Steyl (today in the Limburg Province of the Netherlands), by German Catholic priests fleeing the Kulturkampf. The society's first mission was established in 1882 in southern <b>Shantung,</b> a district of more than 10million people, which contained 158 Catholics. At the time, the area {{was part of the}} Apostolic Vicariate of <b>Shantung,</b> managed by Italian Franciscans, who were tasked with rebuilding the earlier Catholic mission work. However, the mission work proceeded slowly, due to insufficient personnel and resources. The southern half of the province, in particular, had been all but neglected. Consequently, it was transferred to the SVD on December 2, 1885, and became the Vicariate Apostolic of Southern Shan-tung. The new Vicariate Apostolic was headquartered in Yanzhou, Shandong and headed by Bishop Johann Baptist von Anzer, SVD, who led it until November 24, 1903. By 1907, the mission numbered 35,378Catholics and 36,367 catechumens, and by 1924, 106,000Catholics and 44,000catechumens. The SVD's presence in Qingdao was first recorded when the mission purchased land there in 1899 and began building a mission hall.|$|E

Qingdao was its administrative center. According to Dr. Wilhelm Matzat, of the University of Bonn, [...] "The so-called Marktstrasse (Market street) {{was nothing more than}} the old main street of the Chinese village of Tsingtao, and the buildings lining it were the former homes of fishermen and farmers. Having sold their property, they resettled their homes and fields in the villages further east." [...] On gaining control of the area, the Germans outfitted the impoverished fishing village of Tsingtao with wide streets, solid housing areas, government buildings, electrification throughout, a sewer system and a safe drinking water supply. The buildings were built in a European style. The area had the highest density of schools and per capita student enrollment in all of China; primary, secondary and vocational schools were funded by the Imperial German treasury and Protestant and Roman Catholic missions.

2500|$|The {{situation}} in <b>Shantung</b> Province {{was different from}} that of Hopeh.

According to Shaw, [...] "Tsingtao remained a Nationalist island in a Communist sea." [...] The Japanese and their puppet troops held the railroad leading from Tsingtao into the interior. Until Nationalist forces could arrive in <b>Shantung</b> in sufficient strength to replace the Japanese, there was little hope of rapid fulfillment of repatriation plans.|$|E

2500|$|In late 1945, the Nationalist leader, Chiang Kai-shek, was {{preparing}} for a campaign {{to take control of}} Manchuria. In November, General Wedemeyer, the commander of the China Theater, who also served as a military advisor to Chiang Kai-shek, warned the Nationalist leader to secure his hold on the vital provinces of northeastern China, before entering Manchuria. However, in order to do this, the Nationalists required an [...] "overwhelmingly superior" [...] force. As result, Nationalist troops who had been stationed in Hopeh and <b>Shantung</b> Provinces were sent into battle, leaving large areas of the said provinces unprotected from Communist guerrillas.

2500|$|On October 13, an {{emissary}} {{from the}} Communist commander in <b>Shantung</b> arrived in Tsingtao {{with a letter}} for General Lemuel C. Shepherd, the commander of 6th Division. In it was an offer {{to cooperate with the}} Marines [...] "to destroy the remaining Japanese military forces {{and the rest of the}} traitor army ('puppet army')." [...] In order to [...] "best establish local peace and order," [...] Communist troops would be sent into Tsingtao with the expectation that the Marines would not oppose them. The Communist leader noted that CNA troops were preparing to enter Tsingtao with American help for the express purpose of attacking the Communists. In the resultant [...] "open conflict," [...] he hoped [...] "that our both armies continue to maintain friendly relations." [...] General Shepherd responded immediately with his own message, which said that his mission was not to [...] "destroy" [...] either the Japanese or their puppets, that a Communist occupation of Tsingtao was [...] "most undesirable," [...] because the city was peaceful, and that he would not cooperate with them. He also said that if a crisis was to occur in Tsingtao, his [...] "division of well-trained combat veterans would be entirely capable of coping with the situation." ...|$|E
60|$|If the <b>Shantung</b> Railway Agreement is loyally carried out, this reform--as to whose {{importance}} I quite {{agree with}} Putnam Weale--will have been practically completed five years hence. But we must expect Japan to adopt every possible means of avoiding the carrying {{out of her}} promises, from instigating Chinese civil war to the murdering of Japanese employees by Japanese secret agents masquerading as Chinese. Therefore, until the Chinese actually have complete control of the <b>Shantung</b> Railway, we cannot feel confident that they will ever get it.|$|E
60|$|From the Chinese {{point of}} view, the chief {{achievement}} at Washington was the <b>Shantung</b> Treaty. Ever since the expulsion by the Germans {{at the end}} of 1914, the Japanese had held Kiaochow Bay, which includes the port of Tsingtau; they had stationed troops along the whole extent of the <b>Shantung</b> Railway; and by the treaty following the Twenty-one Demands, they had preferential treatment as regards all industrial undertakings in <b>Shantung.</b> The railway belonged to them by right of conquest, and through it they acquired control of the whole province. When an excuse was needed for increasing the garrison, they supplied arms to brigands, and claimed that their intervention was necessary to suppress the resulting disorder. This state of affairs was legalized by the Treaty of Versailles, to which, however, America and China were not parties. The Washington Conference, therefore, supplied an opportunity of raising the question afresh.|$|E
6000|$|The French {{attitude}} about <b>Shantung,</b> {{at the same}} time, is indicated by Notes which passed between France and Japan at Tokyo.[73] On February 19th, Baron Motono sent a communication to the French and Russian Ambassadors stating, among other things, that [...] "the Imperial Japanese Government proposes to demand from Germany {{at the time of}} the peace negotiations, the surrender of the territorial rights and special interests Germany possessed before the war in <b>Shantung</b> and the islands belonging to her situated north of the equator in the Pacific Ocean." [...] The French Ambassador, on March 2nd, replied as follows:-- ...|$|E
60|$|The next {{incident}} {{begins with}} the murder of two German missionaries in <b>Shantung</b> in 1897. Nothing in their life became them like the leaving of it; for if they had lived they would probably have made very few converts, whereas by dying they afforded the world an object-lesson in Christian ethics. The Germans seized Kiaochow Bay and created a naval base there; they also acquired railway and mining rights in <b>Shantung,</b> which, by the Treaty of Versailles, passed to Japan in accordance with the Fourteen Points. <b>Shantung</b> therefore became virtually a Japanese possession, though America at Washington has insisted upon its restitution. The services of the two missionaries to civilization did not, however, end in China, for their death was constantly used in the German Reichstag during the first debates on the German Big Navy Bills, since it was held that warships would make Germany respected in China. Thus they helped to exacerbate the relations of England and Germany and to hasten the advent of the Great War. They also helped to bring on the Boxer rising, which is said to have begun as a movement against the Germans in <b>Shantung,</b> though the other Powers emulated the Germans in every respect, the Russians by creating a naval base at Port Arthur, the British by acquiring Wei-hai-wei and a sphere of influence in the Yangtze, and so on. The Americans alone held aloof, proclaiming the policy of Chinese integrity and the Open Door.|$|E
