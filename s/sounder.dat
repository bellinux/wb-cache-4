Initially, only Everett Transit and Community Transit operated {{out of the}} station on opening day, but they were quickly joined by Sound Transit Express service the following day and Greyhound intercity bus service that summer. Amtrak was initially expected to begin serving Everett Station in July 2002, but the construction of a passing track delayed the move of the Cascades and Empire Builder from Bond Street Station to November 12. Construction of a <b>Sounder</b> commuter rail platform and rail spur was approved by the Everett City Council in September 2002, pending reimbursement from Sound Transit and Amtrak for its cost of $726,000. <b>Sounder</b> service to King Street Station in Seattle via Edmonds began with special Seattle Seahawks gameday service on December 22, 2003, carrying 700 passengers on the inaugural run of the <b>Sounder</b> North Line.|$|E

40|$|<b>Sound</b> power {{describes}} a <b>sound</b> source {{regardless of its}} environment and is useful in noise control applications, but can be cumbersome and time consuming to measure. <b>Sound</b> power levels can rank different <b>sound</b> sources and is often restricted in noise control legislation. An acoustic camera records a <b>sound</b> field with a microphone array. Due to properties of the array, and by using beamforming algorithms, an acoustic camera can separate <b>sound</b> from different directions. The acoustic camera measures <b>sound</b> pressure from a <b>sound</b> source. By assuming directivity properties the <b>sound</b> power of a <b>sound</b> source {{can be derived from}} the <b>sound</b> pressure. In this thesis an acoustic camera has been evaluated in order to determine <b>sound</b> power estimation performance and <b>sound</b> source separation ability. This is tested by six different measurement set-ups in an anechoic chamber. Two different <b>sound</b> sources are used in the trials: one reference <b>sound</b> source and one disturbing <b>sound</b> source. The reference <b>sound</b> source has a calibrated and documented <b>sound</b> power level to which the measurement results are compared. Measurements were performed at 1 to 5 m distance from the acoustic camera with both <b>sound</b> sources. The influence of a disturbing <b>sound</b> source on the reference <b>sound</b> source <b>sound</b> power level was measured with the <b>sound</b> sources separated 0. 65 m to 2. 6 m. The measurements show that the <b>sound</b> power level could at best be determined within 1 dB. The acoustic camera can separate different <b>sound</b> sources well. Influence from a disturbing <b>sound</b> source, 10 dB SPL stronger and distanced 1 m from a reference <b>sound</b> source was 2 to 3 dB for mid-frequency one-third octave bands at 5 m measurement distance. Measuring <b>sound</b> power with an acoustic camera is fast and mobile compared to room interaction methods and <b>sound</b> intensity measurements. The results of this thesis are useful when measuring <b>sound</b> power levels, especially for <b>sound</b> sources such as chimney outlets, wind power stations and big objects that can not be moved or do not fit in a room.

40|$|This keynote {{introduces}} various {{contributions to}} a structured session on <b>sound</b> quality {{organized by the}} present author. In the last decade, basic research as well as practical applications of <b>sound</b> quality increased substantially. This holds true for <b>sound</b> quality of emissions e. g. in product <b>sound</b> {{as well as for}} <b>sound</b> quality of immissions e. g. in the environment. For product <b>sound,</b> two cases of <b>sound</b> quality are considered: one, where <b>sound</b> quality is the dominant, generic feature of a product like musical instruments or loudspeakers, and a second, where <b>sound</b> quality is a by-product like the <b>sound</b> of Dieselengines or- to give a more exotic example- the <b>sound</b> quality of snoring. As concerns <b>sound</b> immissions, wanted <b>sounds</b> typical for a soundscape and unwanted <b>sounds</b> typical for noise immissions can be distinguished. However, also <b>sounds</b> blending perfectly into a soundscape like the noise of a chain saw in the soundscape of a forest, may be pretty annoying. For both product <b>sound</b> and <b>sound</b> quality of the environment, influences of the meaning of <b>sounds</b> have to be considered. Additional extra-aural effects like the image of brand names or audio-visual interactions can significantly influence <b>sound</b> quality judgements. ...|$|R
5|$|Mukilteo {{is served}} by the eight daily <b>Sounder</b> trains on weekdays, running on the North Line along the Puget Sound between Everett Station and King Street Station in Seattle. The runs are split between four morning and four {{afternoon}} runs, with a single round-trip gameday service provided for weekend events at CenturyLink Field and Safeco Field. Train service on the corridor, which includes BNSF freight traffic and Amtrak passenger service, is frequently disrupted and canceled during the autumn and winter seasons because of landslides from unstable slopes above the tracks. During the 2012â€“2013 winter season, a record-high of 206 passenger trains between Everett and Seattle were canceled, prompting the Washington State Department of Transportation to begin a three-year landslide mitigation project in 2013 that will stabilize slopes above the railroad between Seattle and Everett.|$|E

Marysville {{is one of the}} largest cities in the metro area excluded from the Sound Transit regional service area, but expressed interest in joining the regional transit authority in the 1990s.

5|$|A {{commuter}} rail station in Mukilteo {{had been part}} of the original Sound Transit proposal rejected in 1995 and adopted the following year, as part of a Seattleâ€“Everett line on the existing BNSF corridor. The agency selected the station site in 1999, choosing a platform east of State Route 525 and the Washington State Ferries terminal over one at Mukilteo Lighthouse Park because of concerns arising from existing parking and traffic issues in the area. A groundbreaking ceremony was held in August 2007 for the initial phase of the project, the northern side platform, as part of a multimodal transit hub built in conjunction with a new Mukilteo ferry terminal. The $19.2 million project, including preparations for a second phase to open in 2009, was funded by Sound Transit with a grant from the Federal Transit Administration. <b>Sounder</b> service from Mukilteo Station began on May 31, 2008, with a special weekend round-trip run to a Seattle Mariners game.
