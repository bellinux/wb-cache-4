Specifically, it examines how criminal history influences the opportunity to naturalize through the good moral character requirement for U. S. citizenship. Since 1790, naturalization applicants have been required to prove their good moral character. Enacted to ensure that applicants were fit for membership and would not be disruptive or destructive to the community, the character requirement also allowed for the reformation and eventual naturalization of those guilty of past misconduct. This Article shows that recent changes in immigration law and the handling of naturalization petitions by the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) have turned the good moral character requirement into a powerful exclusionary device. Since 1990, Congress has added hundreds of permanent, irrebuttable <b>statutory</b> <b>bars</b> to a good moral character finding based on criminal conduct.

The expressively punitive nature of the current good moral character provision and USCIS’s misguided priorities in handling naturalization applications force legal resident immigrants with criminal histories to permanently live in the shadows of full membership, never able to possess the full rights, privileges, and respect that citizenship can bring.

40|$|Today, {{jurisdiction}} over immigration law {{is by no}} means well defined by clear limits. Limitations on jurisdiction have bred a multitude of litigation. The number of federal court cases reviewing removal orders has increased 970 % in the past ten years. As of September 2005, the immigration cases represented 18 % of the appellate civil docket. Congress and the courts are not alone in augmenting the number of immigration cases in the federal courts. Congress has also urged the agencies enforcing the immigration laws to increase enforcement, to reduce backlogs and to make removal more swift and certain. At the same time that Congress was shearing away at the forms of judicial review, the Department of Justice and its Executive Office for Immigration Review (“EOIR”) together with the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) were increasing the number, rate and speed of adjudication of removal cases. For these men, women and children in removal proceedings, the incentives to litigate beyond the agency have partially increased as a reaction to the narrowing and elimination of prior forms of relief. Prior to 1996, the immigration statutes provided many people with a way to regularize their status, to become “legal” through the removal process. Now, <b>statutory</b> <b>bars</b> on relief are very strict and other forms of relief have been entirely eliminated. Thus, the individual fights harder either to defeat the government assertion {{that he or she is}} subject to removal or in the hope that litigation or time will somehow prevent removal. In this paper, I argue that many of the reforms taken by Congress or by the agency, although designed to increase efficiency have, in essence, backfired. I explore some of the statutory and administrative sources that are contributing to the increase in immigration-related federal court cases. I also discuss substantive immigration law issues and litigation strategies that, in combination with the statutory/regulatory architecture, are adding to the growth in the number of cases. I look at the interrelationship of these factors. Only by examining these interconnections can we seriously understand the nature of the “problem. ” In fact, depending on our goal for the immigration adjudication system, we might conclude that judicial review of removal orders, even at this significant rate, is both manageable and essential for the development of our immigration law and policy...|$|R

40|$|Congress {{sought to}} attain full {{compliance}} with environmental statutes. It reasoned that multiple enforcers would provide more comprehensive and effective enforcement than one enforcer. Congress therefore empowered the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), {{the states and}} private citizens as enforcers of the statutes. However, Congress worried that successive actions by multiple enforcers could bring disruption and conflict to enforcement litigation and remedies. It therefore included in the citizen suit provision of each statute a limited, three-element notice, delay, and bar preclusion device to manage successive citizens 2 ̆ 7 enforcement against the violations already subject to government enforcement. The device generally bars citizens from enforcing if the government “has commenced and is diligently prosecuting” an action involving the same violations “to require compliance. ” However, Congress recognized that its goal of achieving full compliance by multiple enforcers and its subordinate goal of avoiding disruption and conflict from successive enforcement are in conflict. Congress resolved that conflict by the balance it struck between them in the particular formulation of the preclusion device it used in each statute. Courts have considered nearly a dozen legal issues arising from the bar element in the preclusion device. While many of these issues have been heavily litigated, two have gone relatively unnoticed. First, what did Congress intend when it limited preclusive actions to actions the government “is diligently prosecuting”? Does use of the present tense mean that only continuing prosecutions bar citizen suits? The plain reading of the verb suggests so, although that reading greatly limits {{the operation of the}} preclusions. Second, what did Congress intend when it limited preclusive actions to those the government brought to require compliance? Does the focus on compliance mean that only actions to require defendants to cease and desist from violating the statutes bar citizen suits? Again, the plain reading of the phrase suggests so, although that reading also greatly limits the operation of the preclusions. Most courts interpreting the preclusions have used plain meaning and expressio unius 5 approaches to interpret the provisions, thereby respecting the balance Congress established between its goal of achieving full compliance through the efforts of multiple enforcers and its desire to avoid disruption and conflict from successive enforcement. There is no reason to depart from that interpretation of the provisions for the two issues examined here. Indeed, the structure of the provisions and their legislative history supports that interpretation. The conclusion that the <b>statutory</b> preclusions <b>bar</b> citizen suits only in the face of ongoing government actions for compliance, however, may not always allow citizen suits to enforce in the face of concluded government actions that have not achieved or never sought compliance. Common law doctrines may supplement the statutory preclusions. Res judicata, abstention and other related common law doctrines are designed to promote finality and to prevent disruption and conflict from successive litigation. Courts have not yet determined the relationship between the statutory and common law preclusions. Moreover, they have applied the common law preclusions inconsistently and some of their applications may also shield violators from effective enforcement or even compliance with the law...|$|R
40|$|Purpose The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{consider}} the background to the recent changes to adult safeguarding in Wales as a result of the new measures introduced by the Social Services and Well-being (Wales) Act 2014 and discuss their potential impact. Design/methodology/approach The paper relies on a range of material including reports published by the Law Commission, the National Assembly for Wales and other public bodies. It also refers to academic and practitioner material in journals and government guidance. Findings Although the Social Services and Well-being (Wales) Act 2014 introduced many changes in adult safeguarding in Wales, not least the duty to make enquiries, it does not take the opportunity to include <b>statutory</b> powers of <b>barring</b> and removal. The introduction of Adult Protection and Support Orders (APSOs) is a cautious step forward ? perhaps it is too cautious. More research in needed on the different approaches across the UK. Research limitations/implications At the time of publication, the full effect of the new legislation has not been seen. Local authorities and others are coming to terms with the new provisions. No data on the impact of the new legislation are yet available. The paper identifies future research evaluating the working of the different approaches to safeguarding within the UK. Practical implications For practitioners, the new legislation provides opportunities to rethink the approach to safeguarding. The lower threshold for referrals will mean an increase in caseloads and the need to react to both low- and high-risk cases. For authorised officers, the practical issues identified relate to the circumstances in which an APSO may be sought and what can be put in place to protect the adult at risk once the order has been used. Social implications For those who experience abuse or neglect, the new legislation provides additional support when compared to the POVA process. The duty to make enquiries and the duty to report will hopefully strengthen protection and, with a lower threshold for referral, enable more preventative work to be done at an earlier stage. Whether the new APSO will make a difference remains to be seen. Originality/value As this is new legislation, there is very little analysis of the implications of the Social Services and Well-being (Wales) Act 2014 in relation to safeguarding. This paper presents an overview and, in places, a critical analysis of the new safeguarding duties. authorsversionPeer reviewe...|$|R

The legislative purpose and statutory language of CAA section 112, however, supports a finding that EPA is actually barred from such cost consideration. This Comment argues that in light of the D. C.

5000|$|Piercing the {{corporate}} veil16. I should {{first of all}} {{draw attention to the}} limited sense in which this issue arises at all. [...] "Piercing {{the corporate}} veil" [...] is an expression rather indiscriminately used to describe a number of different things. Properly speaking, it means disregarding the separate personality of the company. There is a range of situations in which the law attributes the acts or property of a company to those who control it, without disregarding its separate legal personality. The controller may be personally liable, generally in addition to the company, for something that he has done as its agent or as a joint actor. Property legally vested in a company may belong beneficially to the controller, if the arrangements in relation to the property are such as to make the company its controller's nominee or trustee for that purpose. For specific statutory purposes, a company's legal responsibility may be engaged by the acts or business of an associated company. Examples are the provisions of the Companies Acts governing group accounts or the rules governing infringements of competition law by [...] "firms", which may include groups of companies conducting the relevant business as an economic unit. Equitable remedies, such as an injunction or specific performance may be available to compel the controller whose personal legal responsibility is engaged to exercise his control in a particular way. But when we speak of piercing the corporate veil, we are not (or should not be) speaking of any of these situations, but only of those cases which are true exceptions to the rule in Salomon v A Salomon & Co Ltd, i.e. where a person who owns and controls a company is said in certain circumstances to be identified with it in law by virtue of that ownership and control. 17. Most advanced legal systems recognise corporate legal personality while acknowledging some limits to its logical implications. In civil law jurisdictions, the juridical basis of the exceptions is generally the concept of abuse of rights, to which the International Court of Justice was referring in In re Barcelona Traction, Light and Power Co Ltd when it derived from municipal law a limited principle permitting the piercing of the corporate veil in cases of misuse, fraud, malfeasance or evasion of legal obligations. These examples illustrate the breadth, at least as a matter of legal theory, of the concept of abuse of rights, which extends not just to the illegal and improper invocation of a right but to its use for some purpose collateral to that for which it exists.18. English law has no general doctrine of this kind. But it has a variety of specific principles which achieve the same result in some cases. One of these principles is that the law defines the incidents of most legal relationships between persons (natural or artificial) on the fundamental assumption that their dealings are honest. The same legal incidents will not necessarily apply if they are not. The principle was stated in its most absolute form by Denning LJ in a famous dictum in Lazarus Estates Ltd v Beasley:"No court in this land will allow a person to keep an advantage which he has obtained by fraud. No judgment of a court, no order of a Minister, can be allowed to stand if it has been obtained by fraud. Fraud unravels everything. The court is careful not to find fraud unless it is distinctly pleaded and proved; but once it is proved, it vitiates judgments, contracts and all transactions whatsoever…"The principle is mainly familiar in the context of contracts and other consensual arrangements, in which the effect of fraud is to vitiate consent so that the transaction becomes voidable ab initio. But it has been applied altogether more generally, in cases which can be rationalised only on grounds of public policy, for example to justify setting aside a public act such as a judgment, which is in no sense consensual, a jurisdiction which has existed since at least 1775. Or to abrogate a right derived from a legal status, such as marriage. Or to disapply a <b>statutory</b> time <b>bar</b> which {{on the face of the}} statute applies. These decisions (and there are others) illustrate a broader principle governing cases in which the benefit of some apparently absolute legal principle has been obtained by dishonesty. The authorities show that there are limited circumstances in which the law treats the use of a company as a means of evading the law as dishonest for this purpose....34. These considerations reflect the broader principle that the corporate veil may be pierced only to prevent the abuse of corporate legal personality. It may be an abuse of the separate legal personality of a company to use it to evade the law or to frustrate its enforcement. It is not an abuse to cause a legal liability to be incurred by the company in the first place. It is not an abuse to rely upon the fact (if it is a fact) that a liability is not the controller's because it is the company's. On the contrary, that is what incorporation is all about....35. I conclude that there is a limited principle of English law which applies when a person is under an existing legal obligation or liability or subject to an existing legal restriction which he deliberately evades or whose enforcement he deliberately frustrates by interposing a company under his control. The court may then pierce the corporate veil for the purpose, and only for the purpose, of depriving the company or its controller of the advantage that they would otherwise have obtained by the company's separate legal personality. The principle is properly described as a limited one, because in almost every case where the test is satisfied, the facts will in practice disclose a legal relationship between the company and its controller which will make it unnecessary to pierce the corporate veil....52. Whether assets legally vested in a company are beneficially owned by its controller is a highly fact-specific issue. It is not possible to give general guidance going beyond the ordinary principles and presumptions of equity, especially those relating to gifts and resulting trusts. But I venture to suggest, however tentatively, that in the case of the matrimonial home, the facts are quite likely to justify the inference that the property was held on trust for a spouse who owned and controlled the company. In many, perhaps most cases, the occupation of the company's property as the matrimonial home of its controller will not be easily justified in the company's interest, especially if it is gratuitous. The intention will normally be that the spouse in control of the company intends to retain a degree of control over the matrimonial home which is not consistent with the company's beneficial ownership. Of course, structures can be devised which give a different impression, and some of them will be entirely genuine. But where, say, the terms of acquisition and occupation of the matrimonial home are arranged between the husband in his personal capacity and the husband in his capacity as the sole effective agent of the company (or someone else acting at his direction), judges exercising family jurisdiction are entitled to be sceptical about whether the terms of occupation are really what they are said to be, or are simply a sham to conceal the reality of the husband's beneficial ownership.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the {{limitations on the}} constitutional right to strike that apply to public employees in France. While recognizing the right to strike for all salaried workers, whether employed in the private or public sector, the Preamble to the 1946 Constitution, incorporated by reference into the present Constitution, allows for limitations being imposed on that right by statute. Indeed, specific legislation has either prohibited or limited the right to strike for various classes of public employees. This has been held constitutionally valid insofar as the <b>statutory</b> <b>bar</b> or restriction is required to prevent essential functions of the State from being interrupted or {{to ensure that the}} vital needs of the country are being provided for. Even where no specific restrictive legislation applies, strikes by the staff of « public services » — including not only central and local government employees, but also employees of major nationalized industries, institutions such as hospitals, and even private undertakings providing some public utility or service — are subject, under the Labour Code, to a number of restrictions. In particular, five days' notice of the strike must be given by a representative union. And certains forms of striking, such as rotating strikes, are prohibited. In addition, the employer authority may, under the doctrine of « essential services », make administrative regulations identifying which units or staff positions are considered essential. These regulations are subject to review by the administrative courts on the basis that the constitutional right to strike may only be curtailed insofar as is needed to preserve State authority and security or the safety of the public...|$|E
40|$|To {{ensure that}} citizen suits assist {{but do not}} replace or overshadow {{government}} enforcement actions, all environmental statutes which authorize citizen suits bar such suits in certain circumstances. This short Article examines the relatively narrow but important problems created by one such bar, namely the <b>statutory</b> <b>bar</b> on a citizen suit if the federal or state government is “diligently prosecuting” an action against the same violator. The requirement that a governmental prosecution be diligent protects against two types of undesirable situations. On the one hand, the diligent prosecution bar prevents citizens from bringing simple “me too” actions. One {{would not want to}} encourage a citizen organization to wait until a government has investigated and worked up a case and then pile on the violator in the hopes of gaining money for wasteful pet projects and collecting attorneys 2 ̆ 7 fees. On the other hand, by requiring that a prosecution be diligent (and not merely in existence) before the bar applies, the statutes protect valid citizen suits from being wiped out by collusive action between a government and a violator brought specifically by the government to bar the citizen suit and force the citizens to lose the resources they have sunk into the case. Obviously, most cases involving concurrent citizen and government enforcement actions fall somewhere between these two extremes. The goal of this Article is to find a balance between these two ends and to explore means of determining just how diligent a prosecution must be to bar citizen enforcement. In examining this question, I will pay special attention to the diligent prosecution bars in the Clean Water Act because they are the most comprehensive but I will make reference to cases from other environmental statutes as well...|$|E
40|$|A RIGHT TO NO MEANINGFUL REVIEW: THE AFTERMATH OF SHALALA v. ILLINOIS COUNCIL ON LONG TERM CARE, INC. Ruqaiijah A. Yearby The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment {{has been}} perverted {{in the federal}} {{administrative}} system. Federal agencies, such as the U. S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), regularly deprive individuals of liberty and property with little to no review. In its regulation {{of the health care}} industry through the Medicare program, HHS often turns a blind eye to procedural Due Process protections, such as providing individuals an opportunity to challenge the deprivation of property at a hearing, even though law grants these protections. This is evidenced by the case Shalala v. Illinois Council on Long Term Care, Inc [...] In Ill. Council, the Illinois Council of Long Term Care, a trade association of nursing homes, asserted that there was no meaningful review before they were deprived of their property, i. e. Medicare payments, because HHS would not grant a hearing. Without an agency hearing, nursing homes cannot seek federal review because under the Medicare statute they are barred from obtaining federal review until a final agency action has been issued. HHS responded by submitting an interpretation of the Medicare regulations that allowed all constitutional and procedural challenges to be heard by the agency at a full evidentiary hearing and thus move to federal court. Due to HHS’ statements, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of HHS and upheld the <b>statutory</b> <b>bar</b> to federal review until after a final agency action. Unfortunately, HHS’ interpretation of the Medicare regulations that the Court relied upon in making its decision was never adopted by the agency. As a result, HHS regularly dismisses cases brought by nursing homes to prevent the deprivation of their property. Additionally, HHS has whittled away even more of the procedural Due Process rights granted under the Medicare regulations such as a right to a full evidentiary hearing. In fact, some Administrative Law Judges of HHS are now forgoing a full evidentiary hearing to determine a case based on written submissions. The failure of HHS to provide the Due Process rights guaranteed by the agency’s governing statute, regulations, and policy statements made in court contravenes the protections guaranteed by the Due Process Clause of the U. S. Constitution: the fundamental right of Americans regulated by the federal government to receive due process of law when deprived of life, liberty, or property. The hearing process of nursing homes presents an excellent opportunity to study the Due Process rights granted individuals challenging the actions of Federal Administrative Agencies. These issues are particularly compelling now because the federal government and insurance industry are using the findings of nursing home compliance hearings as the basis for fraud and abuse actions and for determining if a nursing home will receive liability insurance. This recent occurrence has made the amount of process provided during compliance hearings even more important. Furthermore, although the Supreme Court seemingly addressed this issue of process required in compliance hearings in the Shalala case, the regulatory system has substantially changed since their ruling. Thus, what the Supreme Court deemed as sufficient process in 2000, is no longer what HHS provides under the Medicare regulations calling into question whether the process given nursing homes is Constitutional...|$|E
40|$|Mamdouh Habib {{should be}} allowed to earn a living, argues Joo-Cheong Tham EARLY last year, a bill was tabled in federal {{parliament}} proposing various changes to the proceeds of crime laws. The effect of these complex changes was that individuals who had engaged in conduct that was illegal in a foreign country but not necessarily illegal in Australia {{at the time it was}} committed would now be liable to confiscation orders. If it could be proven that their conduct was illegal in Australia at the time the government applied for a confiscation order then any income earned from notoriety associated with that conduct could be forfeited to the government. The overwhelming majority of submissions to a Senate inquiry opposed these changes and, it must be said, with good cause. Confiscation orders could be issued without the need for a conviction in a proper court of law. Hence, there was the iniquity of punishing individuals who had not been convicted of any crime as. Indeed, the statute expressly stated that an acquittal did not affect the ability to issue such orders. And then there was the unfairness of relying upon conduct that was not illegal in Australia at the time it was committed as the basis of a confiscation order. With no time limit on when the government could apply for a confiscation order, there was no <b>statutory</b> <b>bar</b> against the government applying for an order in relation to conduct that was made illegal decades after it was engaged in. Significantly, there was also recognition for the first time in Australian law of the Guantanamo Bay military tribunals. This prompted some to argue, with some prescience, that the effect of these changes, if not the intent, would be to impair the public’s ability to know of conditions existing in Guantanamo Bay. Community opposition was, however, swept aside when these changes became law through the enactment of the Anti-Terrorism Act 2004. And it is this set of changes that the government is threatening to use against Mamdouh Habib. It appears that it relying upon the allegation that Mr Habib trained with al-Qaeda in order to forfeit any money earned by him in publicising the detention conditions at Guantanamo Bay. Its success in doing so is, however, far from assured. For one, the constitutionality of these provisions is uncertain. Their impact upon freedom of speech raises the question whether they infringe the implied freedom of political communication. Investing a federal court with the power to punish without the need for a proper conviction might also breach the separation of judicial power. It is also unclear what foreign offence the government is relying upon. Moreover, a confiscation order is issued at the discretion of the court. If the government seeks to confiscate income that Mr Habib has earned through publicising the conditions at Guantanamo Bay, a key factor for the court will be the public interest in making these conditions known. Evidently, this factor will weigh heavily in Mr Habib’s favour. Most of all, the government’s case will depend on the proof it has specifically in relation to the allegation that Mr Habib trained with al-Qaeda. That the US government has released Mr Habib for lack of evidence should, at the very least, suggest some scepticism on this point. These legal questions aside, there are good reasons in principle why the government should not be using these provisions against Mr Habib. Even if there were adequate proof of him training with al-Qaeda, he is still being punished for conduct that was not illegal in Australia at the time it was engaged in. Such retrospective criminal punishment is an open breach of the rule of law. This is no mere technicality. The rule of law, by insisting that our conduct be governed by the law that applies at the time it was committed, assures us a modicum of freedom in planning our lives. This breach of the rule of law will be all the more egregious given the breadth of proceeds-of-crime laws. Take, for example, a situation where Mr Habib uses his status as a Guantanamo Bay detainee to advocate the rights of prisoners and in the process received speaker’s fees to cover his costs. In these circumstances, the government, assuming it had credible evidence of Mr Habib training with al-Qaeda, could seek to confiscate such fees. Most significantly, Mr Habib has not been convicted of any crime. That he has been maligned by the government as a terrorist does not detract from this fundamental fact. Neither does surveillance by the police nor an adverse security assessment by ASIO. To accept otherwise would be to sanction conviction on the basis of government say-so. It should then be stated in no uncertain terms that, in the absence of a proper conviction, Mr Habib is entitled to the presumption of innocence. He should be able to exercise the freedoms normally available to other Australian citizens. This must include the ability to earn a living to feed himself and his family, whether it be through his experience as a Guantanamo Bay detainee or otherwise. And so it is that proper respect for the rule of law and the presumption of innocence means that the government should not attempt to confiscate money earned by Mr Habib. • Joo-Cheong Tham is a lecturer in law at the University of Melbourne.
