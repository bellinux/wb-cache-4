500|$|Achebe {{started to}} explore the school's [...] "wonderful library". There he {{discovered}} Booker T. Washington's Up From Slavery (1901), the autobiography of an American former slave; Achebe [...] "found it sad, but it showed him another dimension of reality". He also read classic novels, such as Gulliver's Travels (1726), David Copperfield (1850), and Treasure Island (1883), together with tales of colonial derring-do such as H. Rider Haggard's Allan Quatermain (1887) and John Buchan's Prester John (1910). Achebe later recalled that, as a reader, he [...] "took sides with the white characters against the savages" [...] and even developed a dislike for Africans. [...] "The white man was good and reasonable and intelligent and courageous. The savages arrayed against him were sinister and <b>stupid</b> <b>or,</b> at the most, cunning. I hated their guts." ...|$|E
500|$|Homer's catchphrase, the annoyed grunt [...] "D'oh!", is {{typically}} uttered when he injures himself, {{realizes that he}} has done something <b>stupid,</b> <b>or</b> when something bad has happened or is about to happen to him. During the voice recording session for a Tracey Ullman Show short, Homer was required to utter what was written in the script as an [...] "annoyed grunt". Dan Castellaneta rendered it as a drawn out [...] "d'ooooooh". This was inspired by Jimmy Finlayson, the mustachioed Scottish actor who appeared in 33 Laurel and Hardy films. Finlayson had used the term as a minced oath to stand in for the word [...] "Damn!" [...] Matt Groening felt that it would better suit the timing of animation if it were spoken faster. Castellaneta then shortened it to a quickly uttered [...] "D'oh!" [...] The first intentional use of D'oh! occurred in the Ullman short [...] "The Krusty the Clown Show" [...] (1989), and its first usage in the series was in the series premiere, [...] "Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire".|$|E

500|$|Andy surprises {{everyone}} by showing up a day early {{and proceeds to}} alienate the entire office {{through a series of}} <b>stupid</b> <b>or</b> tone-deaf actions: he arrives at work without having washed or shaved since he left, he wrecks Dwight Schrute's (Rainn Wilson) record-setting sale with the Scranton White Pages for no reason other than to reassert his authority as boss, shows no shame at accepting all of his absentee paychecks and a [...] "merit bonus" [...] because the branch exceeded their quarterly sales goal while he was gone, and holds a meeting to get up to speed on recent events so he can bluff his way through a meeting with CEO David Wallace (Andy Buckley), who has no idea that Andy was gone at all. The employees decide not to tell David about Andy's unapproved absence out of gratitude for Andy's past kindnesses, but at the meeting they cannot resist crafting made-up recent events in the hope that he will blow his own cover. However, when David meets with Andy he is almost completely oblivious to Andy's erroneous statements, and Andy quickly catches on to what the employees are up to.|$|E
500|$|The album's title, Nimrod, is {{the name}} of a {{character}} from the Bible that in American English became a term for a <b>stupid</b> <b>or</b> dimwitted person. After three art directors were rejected by the band and pressing was behind schedule, Green Day asked the help of Chris Bilheimer, a friend of Armstrong who had done covers for another group signed by Warner Bros. Records, R.E.M. Having just the album title to work on, Bilheimer had some ideas, with the one that went through being inspired by a photograph Bilheimer saw, where a politician’s poster had had his face removed. He felt the image was [...] "striking" [...] and seemed to fit the band by featuring [...] "a typical middle-age male, corporate politician American kind of guy, and someone had completely taken his identity away through vandalism." [...] Following that line of thought, Bilheimer took an encyclopedia picture of men in suits and ties and put colored circles reading [...] "nimrod." [...] on their faces, [...] "using that to take away the people's identity". The back cover had the same being done to a yearbook Bilheimer found in a Los Angeles bookstore, [...] "from the era of the Leave it to Beaver 1950's idyllic America", with the label [...] "break down that image of people’s perceptions of a happy polite idyllic society." [...] The booklet features the lyrics presented as if they were a secret document that had been redacted with black ink, [...] "so they seemed like they were part of something else".|$|E
500|$|One {{of their}} most notable episodes was [...] "Homer's Enemy", an episode {{designed}} to [...] "push the envelope conceptually." [...] The idea for [...] "Homer's Enemy" [...] was first conceived by Oakley, who thought that Homer should have an enemy. This evolved into {{the concept of a}} [...] "real world" [...] co-worker who would either love or hate Homer. The writers chose the latter as they thought it would have funnier results. The result was the character of Frank Grimes, a man who has had to work hard all his life with nothing to show for it and is dismayed and embittered by Homer's success and comfort in spite of his inherent laziness and ignorance. [...] "Homer's Enemy" [...] explores the comic possibilities of a realistic character with a strong work ethic placed alongside Homer in a work environment. In the episode, Homer is portrayed as an everyman and the embodiment of the American spirit; in some scenes, his negative characteristics and silliness are prominently highlighted. By the close of the episode, Grimes, a hard working and persevering [...] "real American hero," [...] is relegated to the role of antagonist; the viewer is intended to be pleased that Homer has emerged victorious. Oakley says the episode was [...] "hyper-meta" [...] and focused on [...] "parodying to some degree the Homer we don't like. That's {{one of the things that}} episode is supposed to illustrate– 'Homer gone wrong'. Although, I would argue that in 'Homer's Enemy' he's not even really even all that excessively <b>stupid</b> <b>or</b> immature, actually." [...] Weinstein said: [...] "We wanted to do an episode where the thinking was 'What if a real life, normal person had to enter Homer's universe and deal with him?' I know this episode is controversial and divisive, but I just love it. It really feels like what would happen if a real, somewhat humorless human had to deal with Homer. There was some talk [...] about the ending—we just did that because (a) it’s really funny and shocking, (2) we like the lesson of 'sometimes, you just can't win'—the whole Frank Grimes episode is a study in frustration and hence Homer has the last laugh and (3) we wanted to show that in real life, being Homer Simpson could be really dangerous and life threatening, as Frank Grimes sadly learned." [...] When the episode was first broadcast, many fans felt it was too dark, unfunny and that Homer was portrayed as overly bad-mannered. On the DVD commentary, Weinstein considers this episode one of the most controversial of the seasons he ran, as it involves sharp observational humor which many fans [...] "didn't get." [...] Weinstein talks about a [...] "generation gap"—the episode was originally panned by viewers, but has since become a favorite among fans who grew up with the show.|$|E
