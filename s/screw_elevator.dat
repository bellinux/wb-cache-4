60|$|The impelling power {{which causes}} the great fabric to advance also sets in motion the {{machinery}} within it As {{soon as the}} heads of the grain are severed from the stalks, they pass into a receptacle, where, by a very quick and simple process, the kernels are separated from the husks. Thence all goes into a fanning machine, where the chaff is blown away. The clean grain falls into a small bin, whence it is raised by a <b>screw</b> <b>elevator</b> to a height that enables it to pass out at an opening to which a bag is attached. Wagons follow the slow march of the machine, and the proper number of men are in attendance. Bag after bag is renewed, until a wagon is loaded, when it at once proceeds to the mill, where the grain is soon converted into flour. Generally the husbandman sells to the miller, but occasionally he pays for making the flour, and sends the latter off, by railroad, to Detroit, whence it finds its way to Europe, possibly, to help feed the millions of the old world. Such, at least, was the course of trade the past season. As respects this ingenious machine, it remains only to say that it harvests, cleans, and bags from twenty to thirty acres of heavy wheat, {{in the course of a}} single summer's day! Altogether it is a gigantic invention, well adapted to meet the necessities of a gigantic country.|$|E
40|$|The OLDS {{elevator}} is an Australian designed {{variant of}} a screw conveyor {{in which the}} screw flight remains stationary and the casing rotates. This device potentially offers several advantages over a <b>screw</b> <b>elevator,</b> though due to its recent conception, {{there is a significant}} amount about its operation that is not fully understood. This paper presents both DEM simulation results and laboratory data gained in a program designed to improve our understanding of the particle flow within the OLDS elevator...|$|E
40|$|The OLDS {{elevator}} is an Australian designed {{variant of}} a screw conveyor {{in which the}} screw flight remains stationary and the casing rotates. This device potentially offers several advantages over a <b>screw</b> <b>elevator</b> such as a very linear relationship between rotational speed and throughput which appears to provide flow for any non zero revolution speed. This paper presents data collected in a small scale version of the OLDS elevator operating both vertical and on an incline. A specific focus of this study indicates that the OLDS elevator concept may be a very useful device when operating at an incline to feed filter cake type material into exhaust gas streams for drying. ...|$|E

50|$|Ancient {{and medieval}} {{elevators}} used drive systems based on hoists or winders. The invention {{of a system}} based on the screw drive {{was perhaps the most}} important step in elevator technology since ancient times, leading to the creation of modern passenger <b>elevators.</b> The first <b>screw</b> drive <b>elevator</b> was built by Ivan Kulibin and installed in Winter Palace in 1793. Several years later another of Kulibin's elevators was installed in Arkhangelskoye near Moscow.|$|R
40|$|<b>Screw</b> based <b>elevators</b> {{can exist}} {{in one of}} three basic configurations. One where the screw rotates inside a {{stationary}} casing, one where the casing rotates opposite to the screw rotation direction, and finally where the screw is stationary and the casing rotates. The later is patented as an 'OLDS' elevator. This paper presents initial data for two of the three possible configurations that a newly constructed, specifically designed test rig allows. This has allowed comparisons of throughput in the different configurations for two different bulk materials...|$|R
50|$|The {{automatic}} {{flour mill}} built by Oliver Evans in 1785 {{was called the}} beginning of modern bulk material handling by Roe (1916). Evans's mill used a leather belt bucket <b>elevator,</b> <b>screw</b> conveyors, canvas belt conveyors, and other mechanical devices to completely automate {{the process of making}} flour. The innovation spread to other mills and breweries.|$|R
50|$|Bulk {{materials}} such as coal, ores, grains and wood chips are handled by belt, chain, slat, pneumatic or <b>screw</b> conveyors, bucket <b>elevators</b> and mobile equipment such as front-end loaders. Materials on pallets are handled with forklifts. Also used for handling heavy items like reels of paper, steel or machinery are electric overhead cranes, sometimes called bridge cranes because they span large factory bays.|$|R
50|$|In early designs {{the coal}} {{would still be}} shovelled by the fireman into a hopper which would feed into a crusher and then a <b>screw</b> or bucket <b>elevator</b> would lift the {{pulverised}} coal to a position where it could be mechanically scattered across the burning coals of the furnace by a spreader. The spreader could be jets of steam, mechanical arms, or a fast rotating plate.|$|R
2500|$|Lane became {{especially}} {{known for}} internal fixation of displaced fractures, neonatal repair of cleft palate, and developing colectomy, which, although highly controversial and opposed by most surgical peers, notably advanced abdominal surgery. Lane collaborated with Down Brothers {{to design a}} number of surgical instruments, including <b>screw</b> driver, periosteal <b>elevator,</b> tissue forceps, intestinal anastomosis clamp, bone-holding forceps, and osteotome. [...] For his surgery on British royalty, he was awarded baronetcy in 1913.|$|R
25|$|Classical mill {{designs were}} {{generally}} powered by water or air. In water-powered mills, a sluice gate opens a channel, starts the water flowing, and a water wheel turning. In 1787, American inventor Oliver Evans revolutionized this labor-intensive process by building the first fully automatic mill using bucket <b>elevators,</b> <b>screw</b> conveyors, and the hopper boy to spread, cool, and dry the meal between grinding and bolting. This {{was the first}} time that anyone had conceived and executed a system of continuous, fully automatic production.|$|R
40|$|Glass fiber {{manufacturing}} is the high-temperature {{conversion of}} various raw materials (predominantly borosilicates) into a homogeneous melt, {{followed by the}} fabrication of this melt into glass fibers. The 2 basic types of glass fiber products, textile and wool, are manufactured by similar processes. A typical diagram of these processes is shown in Figure 11. 13 - 1. Glass fiber production can be segmented into 3 phases: raw materials handling, glass melting and refining, and wool glass fiber forming and finishing, this last phase being slightly different for textile and wool glass fiber production. Raw Materials Handling-The primary component of glass fiber is sand, but it also includes varying quantities of feldspar, sodium sulfate, anhydrous borax, boric acid, and many other materials. The bulk supplies are received by rail car and truck, and the lesser-volume supplies are received in drums and packages. These raw materials are unloaded {{by a variety of}} methods, including drag shovels, vacuum systems, and vibrator/gravity systems. Conveying to and from storage piles and silos is accomplished by belts, <b>screws,</b> and bucket <b>elevators.</b> From storage, the materials are weighed according to the desired product recipe and then blended well before their introduction into the melting unit. The weighing...|$|R
