50|$|Commercial dishwashers {{often have}} {{significantly}} different plumbing and operations than a home unit, {{in that there}} are often separate spray arms for washing and rinsing/sanitizing. The wash water is heated with an in-tank electric heat element and mixed with a cleaning solution, and is used repeatedly from one load to the next. The wash tank usually has a large <b>strainer</b> <b>basket</b> to collect food debris, and the strainer may not be emptied {{until the end of}} the day's kitchen operations.|$|E
50|$|Some {{industrial}} strainers available are simplex <b>basket</b> <b>strainers,</b> duplex <b>basket</b> <b>strainers,</b> and Y <b>strainers.</b> Simple <b>basket</b> <b>strainers</b> {{are used}} to protect valuable or sensitive equipment in systems that {{are meant to be}} shut down temporarily. Some commonly used strainers are bell mouth strainers, foot valve <b>strainers,</b> <b>basket</b> <b>strainers.</b> Most processing industries (mainly pharmaceutical, coatings and liquid food industries) will opt for a self-cleaning strainer instead of a <b>basket</b> <b>strainer</b> or a simplex strainer due to limitations of simple filtration systems. The self-cleaning strainers or filters are more efficient and provide an automatic filtration solution.|$|R
50|$|Duplex <b>strainer</b> or twin <b>basket</b> <b>strainer</b> {{is a type}} of filter {{built into}} a fuel, oil or water piping system and it is used to remove large {{particles}} of dirt and debris. The duplex strainer system usually consists of two separate <b>strainer</b> <b>baskets</b> housings. The system also contains a valve handle placed between the two baskets to divert the flow of liquid to one strainer while the other is being cleaned. On some strainers, the valve will work automatically and the strainer will perform a self-cleaning operation.|$|R

The salad spinner is generally easy to use, though its large and rigid shape has led to criticism; the product is often considered bulky and difficult to store.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this test is to verify that the Shortened Fuel Canister Hook with Certified Scale (i. e. Weigh Station) {{can be used to}} weigh an empty {{canister}} from the Canister Well and the empty Primary Cleaning Machine (PCM) <b>Strainer</b> <b>Basket</b> from the process table. Drawing H- 1 - 84835, ''Canister Handling Hook for Fuel Retrieval System Process Table,'' provides details of the Shortened Fuel Canister Hook. It is also necessary to verify that the grid plate can be lifted and tilted over a canister in the canister well. This testing shall be performed before N Reactor fuel is processed through the FRS in Phase 3. The Phase 3 Test will repeatedly weigh fuel and scrap canisters and the PCM <b>strainer</b> <b>basket</b> containing N Reactor fuel (Pajunen, et. al, 2000). Advance testing of this weigh station will ensure that accurate fuel weight data can be recorded in the Phase 3 Test.

40|$|Pressure-drop {{measurements}} were made across a mockup of a Hallam prototype fuel element {{in a test}} section installed in the Hallam Hydraulic Loop. The flow channel was identical to an SRE fuel channel and included simulated upper and lower plenums. The fuel element mockup was equipped with a Hallam-type variable orifice at the channel exit and a fixed orifice in the <b>strainer</b> <b>basket</b> {{at the bottom of}} the element. Tests were performed to determine the optimum size for the fixed orifice and the temperature adjustment capability of the variable orifice using this optimum fixed orifice. To obtain the predicted 4. 1 lb/sec sodium coolant requirement at a core pressure drop of 1. 85 psi, a 3 / 4 in. fixed orifice was determined to be the optimum. With this fixed orifice size the variable orifice will be approximately 1 in. withdrawn during full-power operation. Adjusting the orifice over its entire range of 3 in. from fully inserted to fully withdrawn covers a temperature range from 875 to 1040 deg F which is approximately plus or minus 80 'F about the normal outlet temperature of 960 deg F. Curves are presented for use in determination of operating characteristics of the element with other fixed orifice sizes should the core pressure drop or required flow rate of coolant be changed.

In conventional type of filters when strainer gets clogged we have to manually clean it which takes time amp filtration processes stops during cleaning process. While in Self-Cleaning <b>Basket</b> <b>Strainer</b> when strainer gets clogged a pressure difference is created between inlet amp outlet nozzle which is sensed by the differential pressure gauges.

50|$|Strainers come {{in several}} {{different}} styles based on the needs. A plate strainer is the simplest, in which water flows through a perforated plate. Often the plate is corrugated shape to increase surface area. A <b>basket</b> <b>strainer</b> is a design where the strainer is shaped like a basket and usually installed in a vertical system. The <b>basket</b> <b>strainer</b> is easier to clean, since debris is captured in the basket. It can also sometimes offer more straining surface area than a plate strainer, improving flow rates, or decreasing pressure loss through the strainer.|$|R
30|$|Before {{preparing}} {{coffee in}} the pots, the aluminum content of the coffee itself was determined. To this end, 1.5  kg ground coffee (3  ×  0.5  kg packets) {{was placed in a}} dry plastic tray that had been rinsed with tap water. The ground coffee was then stirred to homogeneity with a plastic spoon that had also been rinsed with tap water and dried. Care was taken when purchasing the coffee to make certain that all packets had the same batch number. After stirring, three samples of this coffee were removed to be used for determination of aluminum content of the coffee itself. All necessary laboratory equipment was rinsed with tap water before use in order to remove any residual aluminum contamination. Tap water was also used for preparation of the coffee. Thirty liters of tap water were stored in a PE canister with outlet tap that had previously been rinsed with tap water. Coffee was prepared in the aluminum moka pots in exactly the same manner as in the stainless steel pots: 12 -g portions of ground coffee were measured out with an accuracy of two decimal places into the <b>strainer</b> <b>basket</b> of the moka pot. The 150  mL water for brewing was drawn from the canister mentioned above through the outlet tap, measured in a graduated cylinder, and poured into the bottom chamber of the coffee maker. Coffee was prepared a total of six times in a row per moka pot. The brewing time was 7  min for all moka pots heated on an electric plate with a temperature of 270  °C. After brewing was complete, the coffee was left in the collecting chamber of the pots for 5  min before transfer to 250 -mL sample bottles for subsequent analysis. Allowing the coffee to stand before transfer served to let any particulate coffee to settle in the finished drink. Of the original 150  mL, aliquots of 100  mL were poured through a funnel into the sample bottles. This method assured that no residual coffee particles would find their way into the samples. The remaining {{coffee in the}} collection chambers was disposed of and the complete moka pots were rinsed three times each by shaking for 30  s. After the 5 th brewing cycle, the moka pots were washed in a standard household dishwasher for 22  min at 50  °C (normal wash cycle with standard household dishwasher detergent tablets). This treatment is specifically not recommended by the manufacturers of the pots and serves as a worst-case condition. Before the pots were reused, they were also rinsed three times each in tap water by shaking for 30  s in order to remove any residue from the dishwasher detergents and to assure that the conditions were the same as for the other brewing cycles.|$|E
40|$|University of Minnesota M. S. thesis. 2014. Major: Dentistry. Advisor: Scott McClanahan. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); 70 pages. INTRODUCTION: Removal of contaminated canal contents and biofilms by mechanical preparation alone are limited. Irregular cross sections, lateral canals, and apical deltas are mostly inaccessible to mechanical preparation (Siqueira et al., 1997). Therefore, {{the use of}} chemical dissolution and disinfection of these regions is necessary. Many studies have demonstrated the efficacy of sodium hypochlorite in providing these functions (Hand et al., 1978; Rosenfeld et al., 1978). However, adverse cytotoxic outcomes have been reported with its use (Joffe et al., 1991), as well as reports of allergic hypersensitivity (Kaufman et al., 1989). 	The ideal irrigant has attributes of; broad spectrum antimicrobial activity, ability to dissolve pulp tissue remnants, inactivates endotoxin, removes the smear layer components, and is systemically nontoxic to periodontal tissues. Such an irrigant does not yet exist (Zehnder, 2006). MTAD, a final irrigation solution containing 3 % doxycycline, 4. 25 % citric acid, and 0. 5 % Tween- 80 {{has been shown to}} remove smear layer on extracted human teeth and provides broad spectrum antimicrobial activity (Torbinejad et al., 2003). QMiX, a final irrigation solution containing; bisbiguanide, calcium chelating agent, cetrimide surfactant, and saline has demonstrated efficacy at removing smear layer and disinfecting dentin tubules (Wang et al., 2013). SmearClear, a smear layer removing irrigant containing EDTA, cetrimide and water, has been shown to remove smear layer efficiently in an ex-vivo, split-tooth model (Andrabi et al., 2013). 	The aims of this study are to; demonstrate the use of a novel polymicrobial biofilm model to test endodontic irrigants, measure the susceptibility of a biofilm to individual irrigant treatment groups, and to characterize the responses visually through scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and laser confocal microscopy. METHODS: Clinical endodontic microbial samples were collected from six adult patients that presented to the graduate endodontics clinic at the University of Minnesota School of Dentistry with a diagnosis of pulpal necrosis. For each of the 3 experimental runs a pool of one to three patients were combined to ensure a collection of heterogeneous microbial species. A series of baffled 500 mL Erlenmeyer culture flasks were used as a “bioreactor” system to facilitate biofilm formation on hydroxyapatite discs. A total of six discs were contained per flask (2 discs per cell <b>strainer</b> <b>basket).</b> The flasks were covered with a sterile, vented flask cap and placed within the anaerobic chamber for incubation at 37 °C and 20 RPM. This allowed for biofilm formation on the hydroxyapatite discs under shear force conditions. 	The flasks were allowed to incubate according to the conditions described above for approximately 48 total hours. Following incubation, discs were randomly selected for placement into a sterile, flat-bottomed, 12 -well polystyrene culture plate (Sigma-Aldrich) for treatment according to the irrigant protocol. Four irrigation solutions were independently used for testing on the 48 hour biofilms. Sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS) was used as a negative control treatment group. MTAD (DENTSPLY, Int.), QMiX (DENTSPLY, Int.), and Smearclear (SybronEndo, Orange, CA) were used as challenge treatment groups. Groups included; 1 X PBS at 1 minute exposure, MTAD at 1 minute exposure,MTAD at 20 minutes exposure, QMiX at 1 minute exposure,QMiX at 20 minutes exposure,SmearClear at 1 minute exposure, and SmearClear at 20 minutes exposure. Evaluation of biofilm disruption was determined by; cell viability staining, crystal violet biomass staining, SEM, and confocal laser microscopy. Microbial speciation was performed by the Forsyth Institute (Cambridge, MA) by HOMIM 16 sRNA analysis. RESULTS: The flask bioreactor, as previously described, can be utilized for growing a polymicrobial biofilm suitable for testing the efficacy of antimicrobial and biofilm removing endodontic irrigants. 	When compared as a group, the endodontic irrigants in this study achieved a statistically significant reduction in cell viability as time of exposure increased. In a pairwise comparison between irrigants, the mean cell viability was lowest for QMiX. No statistically significant difference in the reduction of biomass between endodontic irrigants was observed. Comparing endodontic irrigants individually by time did not result in a statistically significant difference in reducing cell viability or biomass. None of the endodontic irrigants completely removed the biofilm, as observed by SEM and confocal laser microscopy. 6 of 12 microbial species recovered were found to be in common between the patient pools when analyzed by HOMIM 16 sRNA identification. This study presents a simple model for growing endodontic biofilms under anaerobic conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this study support the inefficient removal of biofilm by the irrigants included in the study. It was determined that QMiX achieved the lowest cell viability over the 20 minute treatment exposure. As a group, the irrigants were statistically significant in reducing cell viability and reducing biomass. However, it could be concluded that they should not be utilized as a single irrigant to disinfect or remove biofilm...|$|E

40|$|During the Fall of 2010, I {{spent my}} time at NASA White Sands Test Facility in Las Cruces, NM as an Undergraduate Student Research Program (USRP) Intern. During that time, I was given three {{projects}} to work on: Large Altitude Simulation System (LASS) <b>basket</b> <b>strainer,</b> log books, {{and the design}} of a case for touch screen monitors used for simulations. I spent most of my time on the LASS <b>basket</b> <b>strainer.</b> The LASS system has a water feed line with a <b>basket</b> <b>strainer</b> that filters out rust. In 2009, there were three misfires which cost approximately $ 27, 000 and about 8 % of the allotted time. The strainer was getting a large change in pressure that would result in a shutdown of the system. I have designed a new basket that will eliminate the large pressure change and it can be used with the old <b>basket</b> <b>strainer</b> housing. The LASS system has three steam generators (modules). Documents pertaining to these modules are stored electronically, and the majority of the documents are not able to be searched with keywords, so they have to be gone through one by one. I have come up with an idea on how to organize these files so that the Propulsion Department may efficiently search through the documents needed. Propulsion also has a LASS simulator that incorporates two touch screen monitors. Currently these monitors are in six foot by two foot metal cabinet on wheels. During simulation these monitors are used in the block house and need to be taken out of the block house when not in use. I have designed different options for hand held cases for storing and transporting the monitors {{in and out of the}} block house. The three projects previously mentioned demonstrate my contributions to the Propulsion Department and have taught me real world experience that is essential in becoming a productive engineer...|$|R
