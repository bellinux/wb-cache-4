According to linear response theory, the Fourier transform of K or G describes how the system returns to equilibrium after an external perturbation; for this reason, the dispersion step in the GHz..THz region is also called structural relaxation. According to the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, relaxation towards equilibrium is intimately connected to fluctuations in equilibrium. The density fluctuations associated with sound waves can be experimentally observed by Brillouin scattering.|$|E

40|$|A {{control design}} method is {{proposed}} to design controllers to achieve global <b>sound</b> pressure <b>attenuation</b> for noise of narrow-band frequencies in a one-dimensional acoustic duct system. This method combines a linear-quadratic-gaussian (LQG) theory with an internal model principle to design internal model-based active noise controllers so that noise {{of a specific}} (target) frequency in a duct can be reduced. The designed controller is, nevertheless, hyper sensitive to the perturbation of the target noise frequency. A reduced parameter sensitivity technique is further incorporated to improve robustness such that noise of narrow-band frequencies can be attenuated. Computer simulation shows the effectiveness of robustness improvement for the proposed design method. In addition, global <b>sound</b> pressure <b>attenuation</b> along the duct is achieved. Experimental results also demonstrate frequency robustness improvement and global <b>sound</b> pressure <b>attenuation</b> {{despite the fact that}} the dynamic effects of the actuator are not considered in the control design.

40|$|Multi-damped-oscillation {{control signals}} are applied {{in this study}} for, active noise control (ANC) in an {{acoustic}} duct. Feedback active noise controllers that can generate damped-oscillation control signals are designed by using an internal model-based linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) design technique. The low and upper bounds containing a desired ANC bandwidth is specified by two frequencies of the control signals. To acquire desired ANC performance, <b>sound</b> pressure <b>attenuation</b> ratios within the bandwidth are tuned by control signals of other frequencies and damping ratios.

An example of this calculation {{is shown in the}} figure on the right. The workstation design {{is the same as the}} one in the previous section. Because of the wide variety of designs the program contains forty-six possible sound paths, each path can be examined independently (Analyze One Path) or collectively (Analyze All Paths). they include direct paths, first reflections, and second reflections. Although direct and first reflection paths normally determine the amount of <b>sound</b> <b>attenuation,</b> on occasion lesser paths contribute to the degradation of privacy. Although the time delays of each path are different, the differences are too short to be noticeable by the listener.

40|$|As an {{extension}} to our previous work, we study the transport {{properties of the}} Witten-Sakai-Sugimoto model in the black D 4 -brane background with smeared D 0 -branes (D 0 -D 4 /D 8 system). Because {{of the presence of}} the D 0 -branes, in the bubble configuration this model is holographically dual to 4 d QCD or Yang-Mills theory with a Chern-Simons term. And the number density of the D 0 -branes corresponds to the coupling constant (θ angle) of the Chern-Simons term in the dual field theory. In this paper, we accordingly focus on small number density of the D 0 -branes to study the sound mode in the black D 0 -D 4 brane system since the coupling of the Chern-Simons term should be quite weak in QCD. Then we derive its 5 d effective theory and analytically compute the speed of sound and the <b>sound</b> wave <b>attenuation</b> in the approach of Gauge/Gravity duality. Our result shows the speed of sound and the <b>sound</b> wave <b>attenuation</b> is modified by the presence of the D 0 -branes.

40|$|Breast {{cancer is}} one of the most {{predominant}} forms of cancer, comprising of 22. 9 % of all cancers in women, causing approximately 450, 000 deaths in 2008. The conventional imaging standard procedure for screening studies encompasses mammography followed by handheld ultrasound. However, there is a decrease in specificity and sensitivity when imaging younger women with dense breast tissue. This dissertation will investigate ultrasound grayscale, speed of <b>sound,</b> and <b>attenuation</b> imaging of the compressed breast to improve current screening procedure. Enabling improved efficiency in 3 D volume B-mode imaging would remove operator dependency on acquiring ultrasound data and improve diagnosis because handheld ultrasound sometimes is focused on a different lesion compared to the suspicious one found on the mammogram. Beamforming algorithms for use in reconfigurable arrays were investigated. A transmit beam with an extended depth of focus was developed by minimizing a cost function that reduced the side lobe energy while maximizing the depth of focus generated by the beam. Optimized channel selection of subelements in reconfigurable arrays was illustrated in order to remove excess side lobe energy caused by overall phase delay across the aperture. Speed of <b>sound</b> and <b>attenuation</b> imaging represent different imaging modes and have been shown to increase sensitivity and specificity in breast imaging studies. In the compressed breast, these transmission modes have limited views similar to those in X-ray tomosynthesis, resulting in a major streaking artifact in the axial direction. Using a regularized cost function, a priori information was used to aid the speed of <b>sound</b> and <b>attenuation</b> inversion to produce images with minimal streaking artifacts. The speed of sound images were employed in a forward model to produce attenuation coefficient images with only speed of sound artifacts, allowing creation of attenuation images representative of the bulk properties of the different tissues in the breast, i. e., including attenuation from local absorption and internal isotropic scattering of the ultrasonic energy independent of the acoustic properties of surrounding tissues...|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of bubble clouds {{can change the}} <b>sound</b> speed and <b>attenuation</b> in liquids, {{both of which are}} often treated as first moment quantities that can be derived using a multiple scattering approach for an effective medium. The same multiple scattering framework can be used to examine higher‐order statistical moments, accounting for the large variability that is often observed in acoustic signals in the {{presence of}} bubble clouds. When clustering of bubbles (preferred concentrations) is present, multiple scatteringtheory shows that the statistical moments should change. These cluster‐induced, frequency dependent changes in <b>sound</b> speed, <b>attenuation,</b> and higher‐order moments can be examined both from a theoretical standpoint and with the aid of numerical simulations. Simulations have shown that while point measurements of the acoustic field for non‐clustered bubble clouds appear normally distributed, clustering introduces both a non‐zero skewness and a higher than expected kurtosis, depending on the number density of the bubble clouds {{and the nature of the}} clustering.

40|$|This paper computes the <b>sound</b> {{pressure}} <b>attenuation</b> {{provided by}} thin rigid screens {{placed on the}} walls of a tall building to protect the building from the direct sound incidence produced by sound pressure sources placed in its vicinity. The problem is formulated in the frequency domain via the Traction Boundary Element Method (TBEM), which overcomes the thin-body difficulty arising with the classical Boundary Element Method (BEM) formulation. The building, the screens and the ground are assumed to be infinitely long and rigid. The Green's functions used in the TBEM formulation allow the solution to be obtained without discretizing the flat solid ground and vertical solid façade. Thus, only the boundary of each rigid screen is modelled, which allows the TBEM to be efficient even at high excitation frequencies. The hypersingular integrals that result from the implementation of the TBEM are computed analytically. The algorithm is verified using a BEM model, which incorporates the Green's functions for a full space, thus requiring the full discretization of the domain. The model developed is then used to simulate wave propagation in the vicinity of thin rigid screens with different dimensions and geometries. The two-dimensional (2 D) and three-dimensional (3 D) time and frequency responses and <b>sound</b> pressure <b>attenuation</b> results are both computed over grids of receivers placed perpendicular and parallel to the building wall.
