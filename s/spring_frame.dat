2500|$|One motion, the {{so-called}} Hamilton-Proctor motion, involved the forensic ballistic evidence {{presented by the}} expert witnesses for the prosecution and defense. The prosecution's firearms expert, Charles Van Amburgh, had re-examined the evidence {{in preparation for the}} motion. By 1923, bullet comparison technology had improved somewhat, and Van Amburgh submitted photos of the bullets fired from Sacco's [...]32 Colt in support of the argument that they matched the bullet that killed Berardelli. In response, the controversial self-proclaimed [...] "firearms expert" [...] for the defense, Albert H. Hamilton, conducted an in-court demonstration involving two brand new Colt [...]32-caliber automatic pistols belonging to Hamilton, along with Sacco's [...]32 Colt of the same make and caliber. In front of Judge Thayer and the lawyers for both sides, Hamilton disassembled all three pistols and placed the major component parts – barrel, barrel bushing, recoil <b>spring,</b> <b>frame,</b> slide, and magazine – into three piles on the table before him. He explained the functions of each part and began to demonstrate how each was interchangeable, in the process intermingling the parts of all three pistols. Judge Thayer stopped Hamilton and demanded that he reassemble Sacco's pistol with its proper parts.|$|E

40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a micro-mirror assembly, comprising a mirror plate (2) fastened to a substrate {{by means of}} spring elements, wherein a drive unit (9, 10) {{is associated with the}} mirror plate, which drive unit is designed to drive the mirror plate about at least one axis such that the mirror plate oscillates about said axis.

50|$|Although {{the group}} did not meet any U-boats, on 23 February it did {{encounter}} a storm of terrible ferocity, whipped by winds clocked at 115 knots. Baker sustained heavy, but not critical, damage: <b>sprung</b> <b>frames,</b> ruptured steam lines, downed lifelines, shorted out fire control circuits, and inoperable sound gear.

50|$|The Dodge M-Series chassis {{was heavy}} duty frame used under various Class A motorhomes from 1968 to 1979. All M-Series chassis used a solid front axle with leaf springs, and Dana 60 or 70 solid rear axles with leaf <b>springs.</b> <b>Frames</b> were used by Winnebago, Champion, and several other RV manufacturers. The line was offered in four ratings, M-300, M-400, M-500, and M-600 {{depending}} on the application. The M600 was offered with the Rockwell F-130-NX rear axle, with a 4.88:1 gear ratio.|$|R
50|$|The bike had a {{prototype}} <b>sprung</b> <b>frame</b> built under the Bentley and Draper patents. The frame {{as far back}} as the gearbox bracket was normal K. Behind this however is a triangulated tubular swinging fork assembly worked in a trunnion bearing. From the rear fork-ends two seta-stays were pivoted and connected to the sprung part of the frame below the saddle by a system of links and spindles incorporating two coil springs. Friction dampers were fitted to these links and there were also two more at the bottom pivots at the fork-ends.|$|R
50|$|The pistol’s design takes {{advantage}} of modern manufacturing techniques: the slide is precision-milled from steel; the frame is an injection-molded synthetic polymer {{and parts of the}} trigger and striker mechanisms are pressed from sheet metal. For the purpose of regular maintenance, the pistol is stripped down into the following components: the barrel, slide, recoil <b>spring,</b> <b>frame</b> and magazine.|$|E

50|$|In 1932, New Imperial {{started to}} use unit construction, where the engine {{crankcase}} and gearbox are {{incorporated in the}} same casting. They made a Unit Minor 150 and Unit Super 250. They continued to use unit-construction, and some models used Bentley and Draper <b>sprung</b> <b>frames,</b> in an era still dominated by rigid frames. By 1938 all New Imperial engines employed unit construction. In 1934 Ginger Woods, riding a New Imperial 500 cc V-twin for one hour, achieved a 102.2 mph (164.4 km/h) average at Brooklands.

40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} a {{nonlinear}} quarter car suspension–seat–driver model was implemented for optimum design. A nonlinear quarter car model comprising of quadratic tyre stiffness and cubic stiffness in suspension <b>spring,</b> <b>frame,</b> and seat cushion with 4 {{degrees of freedom}} (DoF) driver model was presented for optimization and analysis. Suspension system was aimed to optimize the comfort and health criterion comprising of Vibration Dose Value (VDV) at head, frequency weighted RMS head acceleration, crest factor, amplitude ratio of head RMS acceleration to seat RMS acceleration and amplitude ratio of upper torso RMS acceleration to seat RMS acceleration along with stability criterion comprising of suspension space deflection and dynamic tyre force. ISO 2631 - 1 standard was adopted to assess ride and health criterions. Suspension spring stiffness and damping and seat cushion stiffness and damping are the design variables. Non-dominated Sort Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) and Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization – Crowding Distance (MOPSO-CD) algorithm are implemented for optimization. Simulation result shows that optimum design improves ride comfort and health criterion over classical design variables...|$|E
