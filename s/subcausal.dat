50|$|Sexual swellings are water-filled edemas of {{mainly the}} {{external}} or internal genitalia of female primates. However, the swellings can also {{extend to the}} skin of the circumanal, <b>subcausal</b> and paracallosal regions. Such swellings can be categorized into two groups: small and exaggerated. Small swellings are characterised by a moderate size and pinkness of the genitalia, and can be found in Old World monkeys, New World monkeys, prosimians and gibbons. In contrast, exaggerated swellings are larger in size, and their prevalence is mainly restricted to Old World primate species. For instance, they occur in all species of Cercocebus, Mandrillus, Theropithecus, Papio and Pan, and in most macaques, colobines and guenons.|$|E
