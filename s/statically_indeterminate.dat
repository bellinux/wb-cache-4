25|$|The moment {{distribution}} method is a structural analysis method for <b>statically</b> <b>indeterminate</b> beams and frames developed by Hardy Cross. It was published in 1930 in an ASCE journal. The method only accounts for flexural effects and ignores axial and shear effects. From the 1930s until computers began to be widely used {{in the design and}} analysis of structures, the {{moment distribution}} method was the most widely practiced method.|$|E
30|$|The above {{examples}} {{demonstrate that}} nodal displacements of both <b>statically</b> determinate and <b>indeterminate</b> truss structures are multivariate rational functions of cross-sectional areas.

30|$|It can be {{seen that}} {{relative}} error between response results obtained by multivariate rational RS approximation and ANSYS is very small for all design examples.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{describe}} the use of the Flexibility Method to solve two classical problems pertained by structural analysis knowledge area, in engineering context: the matrix analysis of framed structures. Two beams <b>statically</b> <b>indeterminated</b> are solved. There are three specific motivations to make a presentation of a complete solution for those problems, by this method. The first one is its pedagogic fashion. At graduation level in engineering, it is important to encourage the students to acquire perceptions about the relation existent between actions and deformations of a given framed structure under a given pattern loading. The deflections can be determined precisely and the redundant actions are known by hand work, spite to access directly the set of data localized at suitable tables of reference textbooks. We think that, in academic terms and for academic problems, the analyst must know the complete process to calculate them, precisely, without computers and reference tables. The second one is about the characteristic of Flexibility Method. With it, the analyst can choose alternative paths to implement the compatibility equations associated with the supports configurations. Then, he uses the superposition principle to calculate de deflections and rotations. The third one is that this method represents a good opportunity for the students to learn the basis for the Force Method, another one, so important in analysis of framed structures...|$|R

2500|$|As one of {{the methods}} of {{structural}} analysis, the direct stiffness method, {{also known as the}} matrix stiffness method, is particularly suited for computer-automated analysis of complex structures including the <b>statically</b> <b>indeterminate</b> type. It is a matrix method that makes use of the members' stiffness relations for computing member forces and displacements in structures. The direct stiffness method is the most common implementation of the finite element method (FEM). [...] In applying the method, the system must be modeled as a set of simpler, idealized elements interconnected at the nodes. [...] The material stiffness properties of these elements are then, through matrix mathematics, compiled into a single matrix equation which governs the behaviour of the entire idealized structure. [...] The structure’s unknown displacements and forces can then be determined by solving this equation. [...] The direct stiffness method forms the basis for most commercial and free source finite element software.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a practical {{method of analysis}} for temperature dependent response of composite concrete section, in both <b>statically</b> determinate and <b>indeterminate</b> structures. The evaluation of the temperature effects in a structure involves two aspects of calculations, which are to predict the temperature distributions through the structure and to calculate the strain and stress levels induced by these temperature distributions. The mechanisms of heat transfer occur on the concrete bridges is investigated and a fifth-degree parabola curve is selected to present the temperature distribution along the cross-section in this thesis. The theory used {{in the analysis of}} thermal response is based on the theory proposed by Priestley (1978). It also takes the aging effect into account using Age-Adjusted Effective Modulus Method. The elastic modulus is replaced by age-adjusted effective modulus which is affected by two factors, namely creep coefficient φ(t, [tauz]) and aging coefficient χ(t, τ). The details of analysis of the thermal stress and strain in <b>statically</b> determinate and <b>indeterminate</b> bridge are discussed and described in several cases. A computer program which used in the thermal analysis is also described. To predict the time-dependent effects on concrete section, the creep and shrinkage effects are modeled using the aging-adjusted effective modulus method, couple with a relaxation procedure...|$|R

40|$|There are two popular methods {{concerning}} the optimal design of structures. The {{first is the}} min- imization {{of the volume of}} the structure under stress constraints. The second is the minimization of the com- pliance for a given volume. For multiple load cases an arising issue is which energy quantity should be the objective function. Regarding the sizing optimization of trusses, Rozvany proved that the solution of the es- tablished compliance based problems leads to results which are awkward and not equivalent to the solutions of minimization of the volume under stress constraints, unlike under single loading 1. In this paper, we intro- duce the “envelope strain energy” problem where we minimize the volume integral of the worst case strain energy of each point of the structure. We also prove {{that in the case of}} sizing optimization of <b>statically</b> non- <b>indeterminate</b> 2 trusses, this compliance method gives the same optimal design as the stress based design method. <br/...|$|R

To this aim, a layered beam finite element is developed. The displacement field along beam axis and height is modelled through polynomial functions, whose number of terms is varied based on the complexity of the considered problem. The mechanical nonlinearity of the material is taken into account by implementing a smeared constitutive model for cracked reinforced concrete elements. The effectiveness of the proposed procedure, which {{can be applied to the}} analysis of both new and existing buildings, is proved through comparison with significant experimental data from technical literature, relative to both <b>statically</b> determinate and <b>indeterminate</b> beams...|$|R

40|$|A general {{approach}} {{is presented to}} analyze tensegrity structures by examining their equilibrium. It belongs to the class of equilibrium equations methods with force densities. The redundancies are treated by employing Castigliano’s second theorem, which gives the additional required equations. The partial derivatives, which appear in the additional equations, are numerically replaced by statically acceptable internal forces which are applied on the structure. For both <b>statically</b> determinate and <b>indeterminate</b> tensegrity structures, {{the properties of the}} resulting linear system of equations give an indication about structural stability. This method requires {{a relatively small number of}} computations, it is direct (there is no iteration procedure and calculation of auxiliary parameters) and is characterized by its simplicity. It is tested on both 2 D and 3 D tensegrity structures.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the static and kinematic behavior of two chain-like bar-and-joint assemblies which have the same topology. One is a structure which is both <b>statically</b> and kinematically <b>indeterminate,</b> and constitutes a higher-order infinitesimal mechanism. The other is a structure which is both statically and kinematically determinate, introduced by Leonardo da Vinci in the Codex Madrid. Proceeding along the internal joints from the bottom {{to the top of the}} assembly, the lateral components of the displacements of the internal joints of the infinitesimal mechanism show an exponential decay, and the forces in the internal bars of Leonardo’s structure show an exponential growth. It is pointed out that, in the elastic model of Leonardo’s structure, the propagation of displacements of internal joints and the propagation of forces in internal bars also show an exponential character in a modified form. This work also provides some hints for overcoming difficulties arising in higher-order infinitesimal mechanisms, and corrects minor mistakes made by Leonardo. 1...|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} legged {{vehicles}} {{are being developed}} for their mobility characteristics over irregular terrain. One such vehicle is The Ohio State University Hexapod vehicle (OSU Hexapod). Recently, the vehicle has been modified {{so that it can}} successfully walk over uneven terrain. Each of the feet has been equipped with two semiconductor strain gauges to measure lateral forces and a piezoelectric load cell to measure vertical forces. A vertical gyroscope and pendulums for orientation sensing have also been added. The control of locomotion over rough terrain can be decomposed into two complementary control processes, attitude control and active compliance. Attitude control is used to maintain the body tilt in a desired orientation, and active compliance is used to provide a suspension system by distributing force loading among the legs. It has been found that optimal force setpoints for the active-compliance algorithm can be calculated in closed form. This paper discusses the sensing hardware and the control system needed for legged locomotion over irregular terrain. Experimental results are provided for both <b>statically</b> determinate and <b>indeterminate</b> hexapod gaits. 1...|$|R
