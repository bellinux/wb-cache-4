25|$|The Metropolitan West Side Elevated began service {{onto the}} Loop on October 11, 1897, and a rush period <b>stub</b> <b>terminal</b> at Wells Street was added October 3, 1904. For {{much of the}} early 20th century and through the 1940s, service on the West Side Elevated lines went {{unchanged}} until the Chicago Transit Authority took control of Chicago's Rapid Transit System on October 1, 1947, initiating a series of massive service cuts and station closings (that would last until the 1980s).|$|E
25|$|The Fulton Street subway was the city-owned Independent System (IND)'s {{main line}} from Downtown Brooklyn to {{southern}} Queens. Along with the IND Eighth Avenue Line, {{it was also}} alternately known as the Washington Heights − East New York Line. The groundbreaking for the line was held on April 16, 1929, at Fulton Street and Arlington Place, near the future Nostrand Avenue station. The line was opened from Jay Street to Rockaway Avenue on April 9, 1936, including the <b>stub</b> <b>terminal</b> at Court Street. Further construction was delayed by funding problems due to the Great Depression in the 1930s. This was temporarily solved by federal Works Progress Administration funding starting in 1936. The portion continuing from east of Rockaway Avenue along Pennsylvania and Pitkin Avenues to Crystal Street began construction in 1938. The next portion east from Crystal Street to around Grant Avenue, including the Euclid Avenue terminal and the Pitkin Yard, began construction in 1940. The progress lasted only a few years, as all work on the last portions in Brooklyn was stopped by December 1942 shortly after the United States entered World War II, with Broadway−East New York complete but not in operation {{due to lack of}} signal equipment, and the remaining stations to Euclid Avenue as unfinished shells.|$|E
2500|$|The IND Eighth Avenue Line, {{which has}} a <b>stub</b> <b>terminal</b> serving the [...] train under Five World Trade Center was not damaged, but covered in soot. E trains were {{extended}} to Euclid Avenue, Brooklyn, replacing the then suspended [...] train (the [...] and [...] trains replaced it as the local north of 59th Street–Columbus Circle on nights and weekends, respectively. The [...] train, which ran normally from 145th Street or Bedford Park Boulevard to 34th Street–Herald Square via Central Park West Local, also replaced C trains on weekdays). Service was cut back to Canal Street when C service resumed on September 21, but Chambers Street and Broadway–Nassau Street remained closed until October 1. World Trade Center remained closed until January 2002.|$|E
5000|$|The Tramvia Blau is 1.276 km long, {{climbing}} a vertical distance of 93 m at a maximum gradient of 8%. It is constructed to [...] gauge and is double track, apart from single track <b>stub</b> <b>terminals</b> at each terminus. It {{runs in the}} Avinguda Tibidabo throughout, and is not segregated from other traffic.|$|R
50|$|As the trams used on routes 1-4 are single-ended, with {{doors on}} only one side, all {{terminal}} locations are equipped with turning loops, and all tram stops are to the nearside of the tram. By contrast, the trams used on route 50 are double-ended, with doors on both sides, and use <b>stub</b> <b>terminals</b> at Pöstlingberg and Hauptplatz. With a maximum grade of 11.6%, the Pöstlingbergbahn section of line 50 {{is one of the}} steepest adhesion tram lines {{in the world and the}} steepest adhesion railway in Austria.|$|R
50|$|After a {{disastrous}} 1903 {{accident in the}} Park Avenue Tunnel the New York legislature passed a law banning steam locomotives within the city limits effective in 1908. Seeing an opportunity, the railroad decided this could mean a chance to completely rebuild its congested Midtown Manhattan <b>stub</b> end <b>terminal</b> and yard facilities. The electrification project would see not only {{the construction of the}} Grand Central Terminal itself, but miles of completely underground platforms and yard tracks which {{would not have been possible}} with exhaust producing steam locomotives.|$|R
50|$|The Fulton Street Line {{was opened}} from Jay Street to Rockaway Avenue on April 9, 1936, {{including}} the <b>stub</b> <b>terminal</b> at Court Street. A shuttle was operated between Court Street and Hoyt-Schermerhorn Streets.|$|E
5000|$|Prior to {{rebuilding}} and electrification circa 1931, the <b>stub</b> <b>terminal</b> {{had three}} short passenger car tracks serviced by two platforms, a small engine terminal with a turntable, five-stall roundhouse and water tank, {{plus a few}} freight tracks serving storage buildings and a coal and lumber business.|$|E

5000|$|A {{drawback}} {{of early}} [...] "L" [...] service was {{that none of}} the lines entered the central business district. Instead trains dropped passengers at <b>stub</b> <b>terminals</b> on the periphery due to a state law at the time requiring approval by neighboring property owners for tracks built over public streets, something not easily obtained downtown. This obstacle was overcome by the legendary traction magnate Charles Tyson Yerkes, who went on to play a pivotal {{role in the development of}} the London Underground, and who was immortalized by Theodore Dreiser as the ruthless schemer Frank Cowperwood in The Titan (1914) and other novels. Yerkes, who controlled much of the city's streetcar system, obtained the necessary signatures through cash and guile—at one point he secured a franchise to build a mile-long [...] "L" [...] over Van Buren Street from Wabash Avenue to Halsted Street, extracting the requisite majority from the pliable owners on the western half of the route, then building tracks chiefly over the eastern half, where property owners had opposed him. The Union Loop opened in 1897 and greatly increased the rapid transit system's convenience. Operation on the Yerkes-owned Northwestern Elevated, which built the North Side [...] "L" [...] lines, began three years later, essentially completing the elevated infrastructure in the urban core although extensions and branches continued to be constructed in outlying areas through the 1920s.|$|R
50|$|MIL-STD-1553B {{specifies}} {{that the}} longest stub length is 20 ft for transformer coupled stubs, {{but can be}} exceeded. With no stubs attached, the main bus looks like an infinite length transmission line with no disturbing reflections. When a stub is added, the bus is loaded and a mismatch occurs with resulting reflections. The degree of mismatch and signal distortion due to reflections are {{a function of the}} impedance presented by the <b>stub</b> and <b>terminal</b> input impedance. To minimize signal distortion, it is desirable that the stub maintain high impedance. This impedance is reflected back to the bus. At the same time, however, the impedance must be kept low so that adequate signal power will be delivered to the receiving end. Therefore, a tradeoff between these conflicting requirements is necessary to achieve the specified signal-to-noise ratio and system error rate performance (for more information, refer to MIL-HDBK-1553A).|$|R
5000|$|Each terminal, RT, BC, or BM, is {{connected}} to the bus through a stub, formed of a length of cable of the same type as the bus itself. MIL-STD-1553B defines two ways of coupling these stubs to the bus: transformer coupled stubs and direct coupled stubs. Transformer coupled stubs are preferred for their fault tolerance and better matching to the impedance of the bus, and consequent reduction in reflections, etc. The appendix to MIL-STD-1553B (in section 10.5, Stubbing) states [...] "The preferred method of stubbing is to use transformer coupled stubs… This method provides the benefits of DC isolation, increased common mode rejection, a doubling of effective stub impedance, and fault isolation for the entire <b>stub</b> and <b>terminal.</b> Direct coupled stubs… should be avoided if at all possible. Direct coupled stubs provide no DC isolation or common mode rejection for the terminal external to its subsystem. Further, any shorting fault between the subsystems sic internal isolation resistors (usually on a circuit board) and the main bus junction will cause failure of that entire bus. It can be expected that when the direct coupled stub length exceeds 1.6 feet meters, that it will begin to distort the main bus waveforms." ...|$|R
50|$|During its heyday, {{the depot}} hosted the {{passenger}} trains of nine railroads, {{and more than}} 20 million pieces of mail passed through the station to the neighboring St. Paul Central Downtown Post Office annually. At its peak in the 1920s, there were 282 train movements daily. The waiting room stood atop nine platforms serving 18 tracks; the eight northern ones closest to the headhouse were stub-end tracks, while the other ten ran through. However, track ownership and trackage rights west of the station meant that most trains operated as though the station was a <b>stub</b> <b>terminal.</b> These trains, when they were intended to continue beyond the station, instead backed up to a wye just to the east to get to other main lines.|$|E

40|$|Here {{we propose}} a hypothesis, which implicates that the {{neuronal}} cells may take an alternative route to combat energy deprivation in Alzheimer disease models. Poor glycolytic rate, impaired glucose delivery, sustained reductions in glucose utilization in AD brain regions have been reported. The counter regulatory mechanisms to combat energy {{demand in the}} brains of Alzheimer disease models have not been discussed in detail. Moreover the role of CTF's role in the pathogenesis of AD is not well documented. Due to deprived glucose utilization, the neuronal cells might search for an ultimate source of energy for its metabolic function to get regulated since the disease progresses for a longer duration in a life time of an individual. Therefore we propose during intracellular processing of CTF of b-APP, apart from Abeta, other peptidic fragments may be cleaved from the carboxy <b>terminal</b> <b>stub</b> by an unknown mechanism, attacked by lysosomal enzymes into amino acid units, which might ultimately cater the energy demand of neuronal cells via mitochondrial TCA cycle...|$|R
50|$|The Orange Line {{originates}} at a three-track <b>stub</b> <b>terminal</b> at Park Avenue and McLoughlin Boulevard in Milwaukie. The line runs {{at grade}} alongside McLoughlin Boulevard {{until it reaches}} 22nd Avenue. Here, the line leaves McLoughlin Boulevard via an elevated viaduct. The viaduct takes the line across Kellogg Lake, and into the next stop at Downtown Milwaukie. From here past {{the location of a}} proposed infill station at Harold Street, the Orange Line runs parallel to active Portland and Western and then Union Pacific Railroad rights-of-way and McLoughlin Boulevard. At SE 17th Avenue, the Orange Line turns north, and runs in the median of 17th Avenue, with stops at Holgate Boulevard and at Rhine Street. After passing Pershing Street, the line leaves the median of 17th Avenue and again runs alongside the Union Pacific tracks until just southeast of the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry, making an intermediate stop at 12th Avenue and Clinton Street.|$|E
