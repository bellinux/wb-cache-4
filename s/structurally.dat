5|$|An extended, <b>structurally</b> rigid, highly {{anisotropic}} shape {{seems to}} be the main criterion for liquid crystalline behavior, and as a result many liquid crystalline materials are based on benzene rings.|$|E
5|$|Culturally {{inappropriate}} decision making: The Organisation is {{not designed}} to deal with cultural issues or complex social problems; the normal Indigenous decision-making processes and protocols such as consultation and input from family groupings are not <b>structurally</b> accommodated.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Federal Street, a major {{downtown}} thoroughfare {{that was}} closed off {{to create a}} pedestrian-oriented plaza, was reopened to through traffic. The downtown area has seen the razing of <b>structurally</b> unsound buildings and the expansion or restoration of others.|$|E
5|$|Monoclonal {{antibodies}} are <b>structurally</b> identical immunoglobulin molecules with identical epitope-specificity (all of them bind {{with the}} same epitope with same affinity) as against their polyclonal counterparts which have varying affinities for the same epitope.|$|E
5|$|Some dragonflies, such as {{the green}} darner, Anax junius, have a noniridescent blue which is {{produced}} <b>structurally</b> by scatter from arrays of tiny spheres in the endoplasmic reticulum of epidermal cells underneath the cuticle.|$|E
5|$|There are 254 {{state-owned}} bridges in Juniata County, {{of which}} 77 are considered <b>structurally</b> deficient by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation.|$|E
5|$|Archaea, a {{group of}} prokaryotes {{separate}} from bacteria, also feature flagella driven by rotary motor proteins, which are <b>structurally</b> and evolutionarily distinct from bacterial flagella. Whereas bacterial flagella evolved from the bacterial Type III secretion system, archaeal flagella appear to have evolved from Type IV pili.|$|E
5|$|As of mid-day Monday, August 29, {{the eye of}} Hurricane Katrina passed east of the City {{subjecting}} it to hurricane wind conditions, but sparing New Orleans {{the worst}} impact. The City seemed to have escaped most of the catastrophic wind damage and heavy rain that had been predicted. Most buildings came through well <b>structurally.</b>|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from the}} {{development}} of the linen industry, Ireland was largely passed over by the industrial revolution, partly because it lacked coal and iron resources and partly because {{of the impact of the}} sudden union with the <b>structurally</b> superior economy of England, which saw Ireland as a source of agricultural produce and capital.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 2009 the New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT) {{replaced}} the viaduct {{that carries the}} route over St. Paul's Avenue and Conrail line. The St. Paul's Viaduct was built in 1928 and determined <b>structurally</b> deficient. The $271.9 million replacement was completed in September 2011. In addition to replacing the St. Paul's Avenue viaduct, the approaches to US1-9 Truck between Route 7 and the Tonnele Circle were improved.|$|E
5|$|Canada's federal {{structure}} divides government responsibilities {{between the}} federal government and the ten provinces. Provincial legislatures are unicameral and operate in parliamentary fashion similar to the House of Commons. Canada's three territories also have legislatures, but these are not sovereign and have fewer constitutional responsibilities than the provinces. The territorial legislatures also differ <b>structurally</b> from their provincial counterparts.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{collapse}} of the Minneapolis I-35W arch-truss bridge on August 1, 2007, the Washington State Department of Transportation was directed to perform inspections of all steel cantilever bridges in the state that used gusset plates in their design, including the George Washington Memorial Bridge. The bridge had earlier been certified as <b>structurally</b> sound with no serious deficiencies detected.|$|E
5|$|Hiryū {{was one of}} {{two large}} {{carriers}} approved for construction under the 1931–32 Supplementary Program. Originally designed as the sister ship of Sōryū, her design was enlarged and modified in light of the Tomozuru and Fourth Fleet Incidents in 1934–35 that revealed many IJN ships were top-heavy, unstable and <b>structurally</b> weak. Her forecastle was raised and her hull strengthened. Other changes involved increasing her beam, displacement, and armor protection.|$|E
5|$|Hundreds of {{thousands}} of people lost their homes, but many took {{this as an opportunity to}} rebuild stronger houses. With a new, <b>structurally</b> improved foundation, homes were redesigned to be able to withstand another hurricane. However, lack of arable crop land took away the jobs from many, decreasing an already low income even lower.|$|E
5|$|In C. elegans this {{initiation}} {{response is}} amplified through {{the synthesis of}} a population of 'secondary' siRNAs during which the dicer-produced initiating or 'primary' siRNAs are used as templates. These 'secondary' siRNAs are <b>structurally</b> distinct from dicer-produced siRNAs and appear to be produced by an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP).|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, {{the line}} lay unused and in disrepair, but the riveted-steel {{elevated}} structure was <b>structurally</b> sound. Around this time, the structure became known {{to a few}} urban explorers and local residents for the tough, drought-tolerant wild grasses, shrubs, and rugged trees such as sumac that had sprung up in the gravel along the abandoned railway. It was slated for demolition under the administration of then-mayor Rudy Giuliani.|$|E
5|$|Keith Foulcher, an Australian {{professor}} of Indonesian literature and language, {{writes that the}} poems published in Poedjangga Baroe were <b>structurally</b> based in reimaginings of traditional forms {{with an emphasis on}} aesthetic diction; thematically, he writes, the poems tended to deal with either lofty goals or a deep sense of loneliness in the midst of natural beauty. According to literary documentarian H.B. Jassin, the poems, though they adapted Western forms and Indonesian diction, retained Malay rhythms.|$|E
5|$|MFGM is a <b>structurally</b> complex {{bioactive}} milk component, {{found in}} human milk {{as well as}} the milk of other mammalian species. The MFGM in human milk contains many bioactive components with diverse functions and has been linked to cognitive and health benefits to infants. Some compositional differences are reported to exist between species, but bovine MFGM, the best-studied non-human source, generally contains a lipid and protein composition, which {{is similar to that of}} human MFGM.|$|E
5|$|Males {{are easy}} to {{identify}} due to their perceptibly broad and smaller mandibles. Their antennae consist of 13 segments, and are almost the same length as the ants' bodies. Ergatandromorph (an ant that exhibits both male and worker characteristics) males are known; in 1985, a male M. gulosa was collected before it hatched from its cocoon, {{and it had a}} long but excessively curved left mandible while the other mandible was small. On the right side of its body, it was <b>structurally</b> male, but the left side appeared female. The head was also longer on the female side, its colour was darker, and the legs and prothorax were smaller on the male side. Male genitalia are retracted into a genital cavity that is located in the posterior end of the gaster. The sperm is <b>structurally</b> the same to other animal sperm, forming an oval head with a long tail.|$|E
5|$|Niobium is an {{effective}} microalloying element for steel, within which it forms niobium carbide and niobium nitride. These compounds improve the grain refining, and retard recrystallization and precipitation hardening. These effects in turn increase the toughness, strength, formability, and weldability. Within microalloyed stainless steels, the niobium content is a small (less than 0.1%) but important addition to {{high strength low alloy}} steels that are widely used <b>structurally</b> in modern automobiles.|$|E
5|$|Non{{benzodiazepine}}s also bind to the benzodiazepine {{binding site}} on the GABAA receptor and possess similar pharmacological properties. While the nonbenzodiazepines are by definition <b>structurally</b> unrelated to the benzodiazepines, both classes of drugs possess a common pharmacophore (see figure to the lower-right), which explains their binding to a common receptor site.|$|E
5|$|Polymorphism {{refers to}} the {{occurrence}} of <b>structurally</b> and functionally more than {{two different types of}} individuals within the same organism. It is a characteristic feature of Cnidarians, particularly the polyp and medusa forms, or of zooids within colonial organisms like those in Hydrozoa. In Hydrozoans, colonial individuals arising from individuals zooids will take on separate tasks.|$|E
5|$|Princess Grace predeceased her husband, {{dying in}} 1982 {{as the result}} of a car accident. When Rainier III died in 2005 he left both his palace and his country in a {{stronger}} and more stable state of repair financially and <b>structurally</b> than they had been for centuries.|$|E
5|$|Prions are {{infectious}} agents composed {{entirely of}} a protein material that can fold in multiple, <b>structurally</b> abstract ways, {{at least one}} of which is transmissible to other prion proteins, leading to disease {{in a manner that is}} epidemiologically comparable to the spread of viral infection. Prions composed of the prion protein (PrP) are believed to be the cause of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) among other diseases.|$|E
5|$|Reversible/irreversible pulpitis is a {{distinct}} concept from whether the tooth is restorable or unrestorable, e.g. a tooth may only have reversible pulpitis, but has been <b>structurally</b> weakened by decay or trauma {{to the point that}} it is impossible to restore the tooth in the long term.|$|E
5|$|Some {{eukaryotic}} cells, {{such as the}} protist Euglena, {{also have}} flagella, but eukaryotic flagella do not rotate at the base; rather, they bend {{in such a way}} that the tip of the flagellum whips in a circle. The eukaryotic flagellum, also called a cilium or undulipodium, is <b>structurally</b> and evolutionarily distinct from prokaryotic flagella.|$|E
5|$|Submarine springs found {{along the}} coast of Mexico's Yucatán Peninsula produce water with a {{naturally}} low pH (relatively high acidity) providing conditions similar to those expected to become widespread as the oceans absorb carbon dioxide. Surveys discovered multiple species of live coral that appeared to tolerate the acidity. The colonies were small and patchily distributed, and had not formed <b>structurally</b> complex reefs such as those that compose the nearby Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System.|$|E
5|$|The {{bridge was}} narrow and <b>structurally</b> unsound, leading the {{authorities}} to rename it Chelsea Bridge to avoid the Royal Family's association with a potential collapse. In 1926 it was proposed that the old bridge be rebuilt or replaced, due to the increased volume of users from population growth, {{and the introduction of}} the automobile. It was demolished during 1934–1937, and replaced by the current structure, which opened in 1937.|$|E
5|$|The {{carotenoids}} are pigmented molecules found {{naturally in}} plants, and {{some types of}} fungi, including S.scutellata. A 1965 study reported the carotenoid composition of this fungus, found to contain {{a high proportion of}} monocyclic carotenes—carotenes with only one cyclohexene ring, such as beta-carotene. Also present were minor amounts of xanthophyll, a molecule <b>structurally</b> related to the carotenes.|$|E
5|$|The product, chloryl fluoride, {{is one of}} {{the five}} known {{chlorine}} oxide fluorides. These range from the thermally unstable FClO to the chemically unreactive perchloryl fluoride (FClO3), the other three being FClO2, F3ClO, and F3ClO2. All five behave similarly to the chlorine fluorides, both <b>structurally</b> and chemically, and may act as Lewis acids or bases by gaining or losing fluoride ions respectively or as very strong oxidising and fluorinating agents.|$|E
5|$|The protein {{hemocyanin}} is {{the oxygen}} carrier in most mollusks and some arthropods {{such as the}} horseshoe crab (Limulus polyphemus). Because hemocyanin is blue, these organisms have blue blood rather than the red blood of iron-based hemoglobin. <b>Structurally</b> related to hemocyanin are the laccases and tyrosinases. Instead of reversibly binding oxygen, these proteins hydroxylate substrates, illustrated by {{their role in the}} formation of lacquers.|$|E
5|$|The {{quality of}} the rock in the Valley is inconsistent, ranging from finely-grained to coarse stone, the latter with the {{potential}} to be <b>structurally</b> unsound. The occasional layer of shale also caused construction and conservation difficulties, as this rock expands in the presence of water, forcing apart the stone surrounding it. It is thought that some tombs were altered in shape and size depending on the types of rock the builders encountered.|$|E
5|$|Whippets course, work, and race; {{they have}} been bred for these jobs for years. This has kept them a <b>structurally</b> sound breed which is {{predominantly}} free from the physical exaggerations {{that can lead to}} certain health problems. Whippets are, like other sighthounds, intolerant of barbiturate anaesthetics. This is in part due to their low concentration of body fat and their liver's inability to metabolise the anaesthetics.|$|E
5|$|After closure {{the tunnel}} was sealed, {{although}} it remains <b>structurally</b> intact inside. The {{site of the}} lower terminus was cleared and is now an empty site surrounded with construction hoarding. There is a small roundabout directly outside the south tunnel portal. Hereson Road station is now a used car dealership. Four of the cars were sold to the Hollycombe Steam Collection and remain in use, while the remaining three {{were given to the}} Hampshire Narrow Gauge Railway Society. Most of the rails and sleepers were sold to the Romney, Hythe and Dymchurch Railway.|$|E
5|$|Archaea and {{bacteria}} have generally similar cell structure, but cell composition and organization set the archaea apart. Like bacteria, archaea lack interior membranes and organelles. Like bacteria, the cell membranes of archaea are usually bounded by a cell wall and they swim using {{one or more}} flagella. <b>Structurally,</b> archaea are most similar to gram-positive bacteria. Most have a single plasma membrane and cell wall, and lack a periplasmic space; the exception to this general rule is Ignicoccus, which possess a particularly large periplasm that contains membrane-bound vesicles and is enclosed by an outer membrane.|$|E
5|$|As of September 2017, {{reconstruction}} of the damaged lower section of the spillway was about one-third complete, {{with the goal of}} making the spillway operational by November 1. In 2018, the upper section of the spillway which was undamaged by the flood but also has been identified as <b>structurally</b> defective, will be demolished and rebuilt. In addition, crews are working to extend a cutoff wall under the emergency spillway to prevent erosion should that structure be used again in the future.|$|E
