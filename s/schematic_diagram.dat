5|$|After the war {{both the}} old and new Chancellery {{buildings}} were levelled by the Soviets. Despite some attempts at demolition, the underground complex remained largely undisturbed until 1988–89. During reconstruction of that area of Berlin, the sections of the old bunker complex that were excavated were for the most part destroyed. The site remained unmarked until 2006, when a small plaque with a <b>schematic</b> <b>diagram</b> was installed. Some corridors of the bunker still exist, but are sealed off from the public.|$|E

25|$|By contrast, several tanks {{found on}} the site did not show a vein, so were abandoned. The tank shown at right occurs {{not far from the}} north {{opencast}} and was probably intended to find the limits of the deposit located in the adjacent opencast (Tank A in the <b>schematic</b> <b>diagram</b> below). It clearly didn't find the vein, and was thus abandoned. The water supply may have been obtained from a small leat run from a stream up the main Cothi valley before the much larger aqueduct was constructed.|$|E
25|$|Initially PCBs were {{designed}} manually {{by creating a}} photomask on a clear mylar sheet, usually at two or four times the true size. Starting from the <b>schematic</b> <b>diagram</b> the component pin pads were {{laid out on the}} mylar and then traces were routed to connect the pads. Rub-on dry transfers of common component footprints increased efficiency. Traces were made with self-adhesive tape. Pre-printed non-reproducing grids on the mylar assisted in layout. To fabricate the board, the finished photomask was photolithographically reproduced onto a photoresist coating on the blank copper-clad boards.|$|E
25|$|The 80th {{floor of}} the {{original}} design was planned to be an observation deck, {{the first one in}} Miami. The complex was later redesigned as two 70-floor towers, with the main tower being all office space, hence taller. The shorter tower was to be all hotel space. The current design goes back to a single mixed-use tower with 80 floors on a large podium with the top floors being office space and the bottom being hotel or residential space. The observation deck {{can be seen in the}} <b>schematic</b> <b>diagram.</b> Two FECR published sources have gone back to the floor count of 80 with the 1,010-foot design, and renderings of this design from 2009 show an observation deck, as well as the Metromover connection, in the blueprints.|$|E

This paper {{describes}} an interpolation algorithm in the multi-axis motion control system, which can achieve six-axis interpolation operations, greatly improving the processing efficiency. Using modular design idea on the Quartus II platform, by DDA interpolation theory, interpolation modules are built through VHDL. And these interpolator modules are connected into <b>schematic</b> <b>diagrams.</b> By those <b>schematic</b> <b>diagrams</b> a linear interpolator, a circular interpolator and a composite interpolator are formed. The corresponding functions of those interpolators have been simulated on the Quartus II platform.

25|$|And third, each {{ship has}} {{a display of}} systems (a Ship Systems Display, or SSD) {{that acts as a}} <b>schematic</b> <b>diagram</b> of a {{particular}} ship in play. Each class in the game has an individualized SSD, and most expansions revolve around providing new classes and 'variants' of ships to the game, with new SSDs. These displays consist of check-off boxes for all the ship's structure and systems (shields in all six directions, systems and hull damage, how much power the engines produce, how many transporters there are, etc. checked off when damaged) in the general layout of the ship, along with general reference information for that ship (tracks to check off use for weapons in limited supply like drones, shuttles, probes, plus weapons fire resolution tables, firing arcs, and miscellaneous ship data).|$|E
25|$|Industrial towers use reflux {{to achieve}} a more {{complete}} separation of products. Reflux refers to {{the portion of the}} condensed overhead liquid product from a distillation or fractionation tower that is returned to {{the upper part of the}} tower as shown in the <b>schematic</b> <b>diagram</b> of a typical, large-scale industrial distillation tower. Inside the tower, the downflowing reflux liquid provides cooling and condensation of the upflowing vapors thereby increasing the efficiency of the distillation tower. The more reflux that is provided for a given number of theoretical plates, the better the tower's separation of lower boiling materials from higher boiling materials. Alternatively, the more reflux that is provided for a given desired separation, the fewer the number of theoretical plates required. Chemical engineers must choose what combination of reflux rate and number of plates is both economically and physically feasible for the products purified in the distillation column.|$|E
25|$|Prospecting was {{successful}} and several opencasts are visible below the large tanks built along its length. The only {{exception is the}} final and very large tank, below which are two reservoirs. It is likely that this complex was used for washing powdered ore to collect the gold dust. More leats and tanks can be found below {{the line of the}} main aqueduct, some of which are shown on the map of the site. They surround the lip of the very large opencast and the tank shown at right is one which was built on the main aqueduct. It {{was successful}} in finding a vein, judging by the opencast below, but must have been modified later to feed a washing table built to the left-hand side (near the figure in the picture), probably to wash the crushed ore from the same opencast working. It is labelled Tank C in the <b>schematic</b> <b>diagram.</b> Similar tanks occur below as the Romans followed the large vein down to the road and the main opencast. Most of the opencast workings must therefore be Roman in origin, since one of the aqueducts has been confirmed by carbon 14 dating as to predate all modern workings. Just by the road itself the Carreg Pumsaint has been erected in the space beside a large mound, now thought to be a dump of waste material from mining activities.|$|E

25|$|A second kind of {{experiment}} resembles the ordinary double-slit experiment. The <b>schematic</b> <b>diagram</b> of this experiment {{shows that a}} lens {{on the far side}} of the double slits makes the path from each slit diverge slightly from the other after they cross each other fairly near to that lens. The result is that at the two wavefunctions for each photon will be in superposition within a fairly short distance from the double slits, and if a detection screen is provided within the region wherein the wavefunctions are in superposition then interference patterns will be seen. There is no way by which any given photon could have been determined to have arrived from one or the other of the double slits. However, if the detection screen is removed the wavefunctions on each path will superimpose on regions of lower and lower amplitudes, and their combined probability values will be much less than the unreinforced probability values at the center of each path. When telescopes are aimed to intercept the center of the two paths, there will be equal probabilities of nearly 50% that a photon will show up in one of them. When a photon is detected by telescope 1, researchers may associate that photon with the wavefunction that emerged from the lower slit. When one is detected in telescope 2, researchers may associate that photon with the wavefunction that emerged from the upper slit. The explanation that supports this interpretation {{of experiment}}al results is that a photon has emerged from one of the slits, and that is the end of the matter. A photon must have started at the laser, passed through one of the slits, and arrived by a single straight-line path at the corresponding telescope.|$|E

2500|$|In the colon, a field defect {{probably}} arises {{by natural}} selection of a mutant or epigenetically altered cell among the stem cells {{at the base of}} one of the intestinal crypts on the inside surface of the colon. A mutant or epigenetically altered stem cell may replace the other nearby stem cells {{by natural selection}}. Thus, a patch of abnormal tissue may arise. [...] The figure in this section includes a photo of a freshly resected and lengthwise-opened segment of the colon showing a colon cancer and four polyps. Below the photo there is a <b>schematic</b> <b>diagram</b> of how a large patch of mutant or epigenetically altered cells may have formed, shown by the large area in yellow in the diagram. [...] Within this first large patch in the diagram (a large clone of cells), a second such mutation or epigenetic alteration may occur so that a given stem cell acquires an advantage compared to other stem cells within the patch, and this altered stem cell may expand clonally forming a secondary patch, or sub-clone, within the original patch. This is indicated in the diagram by four smaller patches of different colors within the large yellow original area. Within these new patches (sub-clones), the process may be repeated multiple times, indicated by the still smaller patches within the four secondary patches (with still different colors in the diagram) which clonally expand, until stem cells arise that generate either small polyps or else a malignant neoplasm (cancer).|$|E
2500|$|The vapor-compression {{cycle is}} used in most {{household}} refrigerators {{as well as in}} many large commercial and industrial refrigeration systems. Figure 1 provides a <b>schematic</b> <b>diagram</b> of the components of a typical vapor-compression refrigeration system. [...] The thermodynamics of the cycle can be analyzed on a diagram as shown in Figure 2. In this cycle, a circulating refrigerant such as Freon enters the compressor as a vapor. From point 1 to point 2, the vapor is compressed at constant entropy and exits the compressor as a vapor at a higher temperature, but still below the vapor pressure at that temperature. From point 2 to point 3 and on to point 4, the vapor travels through the condenser which cools the vapor until it starts condensing, and then condenses the vapor into a liquid by removing additional heat at constant pressure and temperature. Between points 4 and 5, the liquid refrigerant goes through the expansion valve (also called a throttle valve) where its pressure abruptly decreases, causing flash evaporation and auto-refrigeration of, typically, {{less than half of the}} liquid. [...] That results in a mixture of liquid and vapor at a lower temperature and pressure as shown at point 5. The cold liquid-vapor mixture then travels through the evaporator coil or tubes and is completely vaporized by cooling the warm air (from the space being refrigerated) being blown by a fan across the evaporator coil or tubes. The resulting refrigerant vapor returns to the compressor inlet at point 1 to complete the thermodynamic cycle.|$|E
