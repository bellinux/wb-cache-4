All four fluoroquinolones were active against nalidixic acid-susceptible strains of the family Enterobacteriaceae (MIC for 90 % of the isolates [MIC 90], {{less than or equal to}} 0. 25 micrograms/ml) but nalidixic acid-resistant strains were less susceptible (MIC 90, greater than or equal to 4. 0 micrograms/ml). Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates, MIC 90 s were 1. 0 micrograms/ml for tosufloxacin, 2. 0 micrograms/ml for ciprofloxacin, and 4. 0 micrograms/ml for <b>sparfloxacin.</b> Against Enterococcus faecalis, <b>sparfloxacin</b> and ciprofloxacin MIC 90 s were 1. 0 and 2. 0 micrograms/ml, respectively.

The MICs of clinafloxacin, levofloxacin, trovafloxacin, <b>sparfloxacin,</b> ciprofloxacin, metronidazole, cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, and clindamycin were determined by the broth microdilution method. The MICs for B. fragilis preexposure were as follows: clinafloxacin, 0. 25 μg/ml; trovafloxacin, 0. 5 μg/ml; <b>sparfloxacin,</b> 2 μg/ml; levofloxacin, 2 μg/ml; and ciprofloxacin, 8 μg/ml. Similar pre- and postexposure MICs were obtained for cultures exposed to trovafloxacin, clinafloxacin, levofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin. However, following 24 h of exposure to <b>sparfloxacin,</b> a fluoroquinolone-resistant strain emerged.

No changes in the susceptibility of B. fragilis pre- and postexposure to <b>sparfloxacin</b> were noted for metronidazole (MIC, 1 μg/ml), cefoxitin (MIC, 4 μg/ml), chloramphenicol (MIC, 4 μg/ml), and clindamycin (MIC, 0. 06 μg/ml). Resistance remained stable as the organism was passaged on antibiotic-free agar for 10 consecutive days. Mutant B. fragilis strains with decreased susceptibility to clinafloxacin, trovafloxacin, <b>sparfloxacin,</b> levofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin were selected on brucella blood agar containing 8 × the MIC of levofloxacin at a frequencies of 6. 4 × 10 − 9, 4 × the MICs of trovafloxacin and <b>sparfloxacin</b> at frequencies of 2. 2 × 10 − 9 and 3. 3 × 10 − 10, respectively, and 2 × the MIC of clinafloxacin at a frequency of 5. 5 × 10 − 11; no mutants were selected with ciprofloxacin. The susceptibilities of strains to trovafloxacin, levofloxacin, clinafloxacin, <b>sparfloxacin,</b> and ciprofloxacin before and after exposure to <b>sparfloxacin</b> were modestly affected by the presence of reserpine (20 μg/ml), an inhibitor of antibiotic efflux. The mechanism of fluoroquinolone resistance is being explored, but it is unlikely to be efflux {{due to a lack of}} cross-resistance to unrelated antimicrobial agents and to the fact that the MICs for strains before and after exposure to <b>sparfloxacin</b> are minimally affected by reserpine...|$|E
40|$|The {{in vitro}} {{activity}} of <b>sparfloxacin</b> (AT- 4140; RP 64206), a new fluoroquinolone, was {{compared with those}} of 10 other agents against 1, 222 clinical isolates. <b>Sparfloxacin</b> and ciprofloxacin were the most active quinolones against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and nonfermenting gram-negative bacilli; <b>sparfloxacin</b> had superior activity against gram-positive cocci in comparison with the activities of ciprofloxacin and the other quinolones tested (norfloxacin, lomefloxacin, and pefloxacin). Among the inhibited strains, several were resistant to the tested beta-lactam antibiotics or to aminoglycosides. The activity of <b>sparfloxacin</b> was not influenced by the medium that was used; lowering of the pH to 5 had a marked effect on the MICs for two strains each of Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and one strain each of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus; the MBC of <b>sparfloxacin</b> was within 1 to 2 dilution steps of the MIC for the strains that were tested...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} <b>sparfloxacin,</b> a new broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone, on the morphology, adhesiveness and phagocytosis of a clinical isolate of Staphylococcus aureus sensitive to this compound (MIC = 006 mg/L). The strain was tested for its adherence to human buccal epithelial cells, measured by inter-ference contrast microscopy, and for phagocytosis by guinea-pig peritoneal macro-phages, measured by fluorescence microscopy. Accumulation of <b>sparfloxacin</b> by macrophages was studied {{by means of a}} velocity-gradient centrifugation technique. The S. aureus strain, grown in the presence of sub-inhibitory concentrations of <b>sparfloxacin,</b> exhibited an increased cell diameter and a markedly reduced capacity to adhere to buccal epithelial cells. The phagocytic capacity and activity of macro-phages were greater with the treated strain than with an untreated control. A reduction in numbers of intracellular cocci was also observed 2 h after postphago-cytic treatment of macrophages with <b>sparfloxacin</b> at 10 x MIC. This intracellular bactericidal activity may result from accumulation of <b>sparfloxacin</b> in macrophages, evidenced by a high ratio of cellular to extracellular concentration. It was concluded that <b>sparfloxacin</b> reduces adherence to epithelial cells, increases phagocytosis and facilitates the intracellular killing of S. aureus...|$|E
