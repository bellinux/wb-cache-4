How could ICTs and other platforms be better used to promote improved communication and more meaningful citizen engagement around public services?

40|$|A {{fundamental}} question in biology is how cooperation and especially altruism evolves in nature. There is debate {{as to whether}} altruism evolves by individual or group selection and if kin selection is the key explanation. Recent research in evolutionary robotics has provided some evidence that altruism emerges in populations of evolving robot controllers. A set of experiments is presented here that evolve heterogeneous, but related, populations of simulated abstract robot controllers with a biologically inspired implicit fitness function based simply on 'eating' enough to survive. In predator-prey simulations, an internal fitness function that is implicit {{in the selection of}} individuals is implemented. Predators are paired in a series of trials where they interact to 'consume' the prey and those that survive are selected to reproduce and proceed to the next generation. When individual level selection is implemented, true artificial altruism emerges naturally, where an individual sacrifices its own 'life' so as to allow a related robot to survive. The altruistic trait evolves in situations where there is a high probability that neither of a pair would be successful if both attempt to survive. When <b>situated</b> <b>communication</b> is available, it is used by a robot to claim the prey once located, signalling to the other robot to behave altruistically. Under 'breeding pair' level selection where a pair of robots are required to survive together, they cooperate to ensure that both are successful and when <b>situated</b> <b>communication</b> is available, it is used by the robots to signal that the prey has been located, increasing the amount of collaboration in the population. In selecting for competition, where the robots are not allowed to survive as a pair, in addition to competing, the robots also act altruistically to achieve the goal of only one survivor.

40|$|This project, Toward a Pedagogy of Visual Communication as Critical Practice in Professional and Technical Communication, {{examines}} {{the teaching of}} visual communication in undergraduate professional and technical communication courses. Through an analysis of scholarship, textbooks, and a service-learning project as a case study, I argue that a <b>situated</b> visual <b>communication</b> pedagogy that integrates both analysis and reflection throughout the visual production and design process can better allow students to understand {{the ways in which}} the visual participates within larger social and cultural contexts. This understanding helps students develop abilities to potentially transform visual discourses emphasizing that all visual documents and texts, including the ones they produce, participate in shaping the ways in which meaning is made. By integrating visual communication and design into service-learning and other civic engagement pedagogies in the professional and technical communication classroom, instructors and students can begin to interrogate the view that professional and technical communication is a neutral, objective practice concerned only with prescriptive adherence to forms, conventions, workplace efficiency, and corporate success. Thus, in addition to helping students develop as communicators and thinkers, integrating visual communication into service-learning and throughout the duration of a course allows students to explore the civic dimensions of professional and technical <b>communication,</b> <b>situating</b> them as engaged designers and active members of their communities...|$|R

Analogous to Mey’s pragmemes, Default Semantics (henceforth DS) models abstract but <b>situated</b> acts of <b>communication,</b> referred to as the meaning intended by the Model Speaker and recovered by the Model Addressee.

40|$|This {{report is}} {{concerned}} with agents that act to gain information. In previous work, we developed agent models combining qualitative modeling with real-time control. That work, however, focused primarily on actions that affect physical states of the environment. The current study extends that work by explicitly considering problems of active information-gathering and by exploring specialized aspects of information-gathering in computational perception, learning, and language. In our theoretical investigations, we analyzed agents into their perceptual and action components and identified these with elements of a state-machine model of control. The mathematical properties of each was developed in isolation and interactions were then studied. We considered the complexity dimension and the uncertainty dimension and related these to intelligent-agent design issues. We also explored active information gathering in visual processing. Working within the active vision paradigm, we developed a concept of 'minimal meaningful measurements' suitable for demand-driven vision. We then developed and tested an architecture for ongoing recognition and interpretation of visual information.

40|$|This chapter {{presents}} a methodological {{review of the}} literature on scales and intercultural communication. It proposes to downscale culture analytically for research to be able to attend to the rescaling processes that occur in intercultural communication. I review four concepts, aggregation, analytical stereotyping, small culture and scales, to arrive at an understanding of culture and interculturality as emerging from people’s interactions rather than being fixed categories constructed by researchers for analytical purposes. The notion of downscaling culture pushes the study of intercultural communication towards analysing the micro-interactional moves speakers make in a given interaction, without necessarily seeing these speakers as belonging to a predetermined (national) Culture and their interactions as being necessarily influenced by this Culture.
