The nunnery ran three Vorwerke, {{outlying}} agricultural farm estates employing farmhands and additionally farmers obliged to <b>serjeanty.</b> The Vorwerke were managed by the (ad)vocate (Vogt). Thus the nunnery ran a Vorwerk on Stubbenkamp (on fields now named the Herrlichkeit, i.e. seigniority, which {{is a part of}} today's Himmelpforten), the Vorwerk at Horst and a third in Neuland upon Oste, a part of today's Engelschoff.|$|E
25|$|Porta Coeli never {{developed}} a sustainable farming of its own. Its landed estates and other revenue-yielding assets did not form a closed compound but were dispersed {{in the central}} and northeastern part of the Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen (Stade Geest and Bremian Elbe Marshes). Like many other nunneries Porta Coeli lived of feudal leases, tithes and other dues, earlier often in kind, such as also socage and <b>serjeanty.</b> Porta Coeli let out most of its farmland on socage to farmers, and ran only smaller and closer parts of all its lands through its Vorwerke using labour of farmers subject to <b>serjeanty.</b> The Vorwerke were managed by the (ad)vocate (Vogt). Besides his military task of protecting, his task was to prevent farmers from poaching, pasturing on nunnery's land, forbidden lumbering and peat-cutting and of pursuing culprits, collecting the dues and leases.|$|E
25|$|Sir John Russell (died c. 1224) of Kingston Russell in Dorset, England, was a {{household}} knight of King John (1199–1216), {{and of the}} young King Henry III (1216–1272), to whom he also acted as steward. He served in this capacity as custodian of the royal castles of Corfe (1221 and 1224) and Sherborne (1224) in Dorset and of the castles of Peveril and Bolsover in Derbyshire. He served as Sheriff of Somerset in 1223-1224. He was granted the royal manor of Kingston Russell in Dorset under a feudal land tenure of grand <b>serjeanty.</b> Between 1212 and about 1215 he acquired a moiety of the feudal barony of Newmarch, (shared with John de Bottrel/Bottreaux) the caput of which was at North Cadbury, Somerset, in respect of which he received a summons for the military service of one knight in 1218.|$|E

5000|$|Some of the Domesday Book tenants {{may have}} been serjeants before the Norman Conquest, {{in the time of}} King Edward the Confessor. For instance, a certain Siward Accipitrarius (from Latin accipiter, [...] "hawk"), presumably hawker to Edward the Confessor, held from the king an estate worth £7 in Somerset and did so in an area {{appropriate}} to his occupation, close to a water habitat. J.H. Round ascribed the development of <b>serjeanties</b> in England to Norman influence, though he did not dismiss earlier roots. The Anglo-Saxon historian James Campbell has suggested that <b>serjeanties</b> such as the messenger services recorded in the 13th century may represent [...] "semi-fossilised remnants of important parts of the Anglo-Saxon governmental system".|$|R
5000|$|The legal historians Pollock and Maitland (1895) {{described}} it as being a free [...] "servantship" [...] {{in the sense that}} the serjeant, whatever his task, was essentially a menial servant. However the feudal historian Round objected that their definition does not cover military <b>serjeanties</b> and glosses over the honorific value of at least some of the services.|$|R
25|$|For {{the fiscal}} year 1625/1626 the overall {{revenues}} of the convent amounted to Mark 3,014 Shilling1 and Pfennig10, its expenses were Mk 3,118:14:7. For 1626/1627 the corresponding numbers were 3,498.14.7 and 3,617.11.10. By {{the end of the}} 17th century the convent's revenues divided into Mk 2,671.28.4 of fix and Mk 1,854.25.3 of variable receipts. The farmers in Himmelpforten were all subject to <b>serjeanty</b> to the convent and had to pay a lease for the land, which they tilled. All of the convent's estates (Meierhöfe) leased under feudal law were heritable under the principle of ultimogeniture (Minorat). Originally most dues were in kind, later they were monetised, and even partially collected by third parties such as publicans, sometimes being the collective of tax-payers themselves, such as the tithing farmers of Isensee, Twielenfleth, Uthwege, Großenwörden, , Kehdingen or Altes Land, who thus economised their charges.|$|E

50|$|Serjeants (servientes) already {{appear as}} a {{distinct}} class in the Domesday Book of 1086, though not in all cases differentiated from the barons, who held by knight-service. A few mediaeval tenures by <b>serjeanty</b> can be definitely traced {{as far back as}} Domesday in the case of three Hampshire serjeanties: those of acting as king's marshal, of finding an archer for his service, and of keeping the gaol in Winchester Castle. It is probable, however, that many supposed tenures by <b>serjeanty</b> were not really such, although so described in returns, in inquisitions post mortems, and other records. The simplest legal test of the tenure was that serjeants, though liable to the feudal exactions of wardship, etc., were not liable to scutage; they made in place of this exaction special composition with the Crown.|$|E
