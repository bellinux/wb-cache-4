40|$|Infusion of 400 /AI {{air into}} the left {{internal}} carotid artery of five anesthetized rabbits caused transient pial arteriole air embolism, an immediate 41. 9 ± 0. 8 % dilatation of the embolized vessels, suppression of the cortical <b>somatosensory</b> <b>evoked</b> <b>response</b> to 29. 4 ± 2. 7 % of baseline, and a progressive decline in ipsilateral cerebral blood flow (measured by hydrogen clearance) to 46 ± 4. 1 % of baseline after 2 hours.

40|$|Background and Purpose: Victims of air {{embolism}} often recover rapidly on hyperbaric treatment then deteriorate again, even if hyperbaric treatment is continued. In previous animal experiments, lidocaine {{has been shown}} to improve recovery of <b>somatosensory</b> <b>evoked</b> <b>response</b> amplitude after {{air embolism}}. However, animals in these experiments rarely deteriorated. We have shown that the induction of air embolism and transient hypertension in canines produces deterioration despite hyperbaric treatment, and we decided to test the effect of lidocaine on somatosensory evoked potential recovery and cerebral blood flow in this model. Methods: Dogs were treated with repeated doses of lidocaine or equivalent volumes of saline during hyperbaric therapy after internal carotid air embolism and transient hypertension. The investigators were unaware of treatment group assignment during the experiments. The amplitude of the median nerve somatosensory evoked potential and cerebral blood flow measured with carbon- 14 -labeled iodoantipyrine autoradiography were used to assess effect of therapy. Results: Lidocaine-treated dogs recovered 60 ± 10 % (mean± 95 % confidence limits) of the baseline somatosensory evoked potential amplitude 220 minutes after air embolism; saline-treated dogs recovered 32 ± 10 % (a significant difference atp< 0. 01).

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the dynamics of}} communication within the primary somatosensory neuronal network. Methods: Multichannel EEG responses evoked by median nerve stimulation were recorded from six healthy participants. We investigated the directional connectivity of the evoked responses by assessing the Partial Directed Coherence (PDC) among five neuronal nodes (brainstem, thalamus and three in the primary sensorimotor cortex), which had been identified by using the Functional Source Separation (FSS) algorithm. We analyzed directional connectivity separately in the low (1 - 200. Hz, LF) and high (450 - 750. Hz, HF) frequency ranges. Results: LF forward connectivity showed peaks at 16, 20, 30 and 50. ms post-stimulus. An estimate {{of the strength of}} connectivity was modulated by feedback involving cortical and subcortical nodes. In HF, forward connectivity showed peaks at 20, 30 and 50. ms, with no apparent feedback-related strength changes. Conclusions: In this first non-invasive study in humans, we documented directional connectivity across subcortical and cortical somatosensory pathway, discriminating transmission properties within LF and HF ranges. Significance: The combined use of FSS and PDC in a simple protocol such as median nerve stimulation sheds light on how high and low frequency components of the <b>somatosensory</b> <b>evoked</b> <b>response</b> are functionally interrelated in sustaining somatosensory perception in healthy individuals. Thus, these components may potentially be explored as biomarkers of pathological conditions. © 2012 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology...|$|E

Vasogenic brain edema was induced by exposing a cat's brain surface to air for 12 hours. The animals were divided into three groups as follows: the brains were not exposed to the air with Ld administration (unexposed group), the brains {{were exposed to the}} air without Ld (untreated group), and with Ld (Ld-treated group). In the unexposed group, Ld had no influence on either cerebral water content or the latency of N(1) component of <b>somatosensory</b> <b>evoked</b> <b>response</b> (SER). In the untreated group, the cerebral water content in the cortex, white matter and thalamus increased 12 hours after exposure. Local CBF decreased in these areas. The latency of N(1) component of SER was prolonged significantly 6 hours after air exposure. The amplitude of the direct cortical response (DCR) decreased significantly. In the Ld treated group, water content decreased and ICBF increased significantly in the cortex compared with untreated group. There was no significant prolongation of SER N(1) component latency even after 12 hours of air exposure. These beneficial effects of Ld on cerebral water content and ICBF of the cortex, and neuronal electrical activity were presumably due to the stabilizing effect on the cellular membrane and the improvement of microcirculation...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} an {{expanding}} supratentorial mass on the neural function and local cerebral blood flow (1 -CBF) in the brain stem were investigated. A balloon was into the supratentorial epidural space of 32 cats and inflated at a constant rate (0. 0197 ml/minute). The auditory brain-stem response (BER) and the short-latency <b>somatosensory</b> <b>evoked</b> <b>response</b> (S-SER) were employed to evaluate the electrical conduction through the auditory and lemniscal pathway, respectively. The blink reflex was also monitored to investigate the neural function of the brain-stem reticular formation. The 1 -CBF was measured in the inferior colliculus (IC), medial lemniscus (ML), pontine reticular formation (PRF) and reticular formation of the medulla oblongata (MORF) by the hydrogen clearance method. While the ICP was raised to 40 - 60 mmHg, the values of IC-and PRF-CBF markedly decreased as {{compared with those of}} ML- and MORF-CBF. Blink reflex R(2) disappeared at 40 - 70 mmHg ICP, prior to the disappearance of BER wave V, S-SER II components, and blink reflex R(1). At the stage of appearance of anisocoria, the BER wave V disappeared in all cats while the S-SER components were preserved in 4 of 18 cats. When both BER wave V and S-SER II components disappeared, 1 -CBFs in IC and ML decreased to less than 50 % of the control. The balloon was deflated within 15 minutes after anisocoria occurred. One hour after the deflation, blink reflex R(2) remained absent in all cases. S-SER II components and BER wave V recovered in 10 of 14 cats and 4 of 18 cats, respectively. The 1 -CBF of the brain-stem improved in the majority of the cats in which the neural function of the corresponding region recovered.

The restitution period was followed by continuous EEG monitoring and repeated tests for evoked potentials. After 180 min of recovery, the brains were frozen in situ with liquid nitrogen and analyzed for energy metabolism. In accordance with earlier metabolic studies from this laboratory, the recovery after 60 min of severe hypoglycemia was incomplete, with signs of permanent failure of energy metabolism.

To account for the different sensitivity profiles of EEG and MEG, we constructed a six-compartment fi-nite element head model with anisotropic white matter conductivity, and calibrated the skull conductivity via <b>somatosensory</b> <b>evoked</b> <b>responses.</b> Our results show that, unlike single mo-dality EEG or MEG, combined EMEG uses the complementary information of both modali-ties and thereby allows accurate source reconstructions also at early instants in time (epileptic spike onset), i. e., time points with low SNR, which are not yet subject to propaga...|$|R
40|$|Central pain {{syndrome}} (CPS) is {{a debilitating}} condition that affects {{a large number}} of patients with a primary lesion or dysfunction in the CNS. Despite its discovery over a century ago, the pathophysiological processes underlying the development and maintenance of CPS are poorly understood. We recently demonstrated that activity in the posterior thalamus (PO) is tightly regulated by inhibitory inputs from zona incerta (ZI). Here we test the hypothesis that CPS is associated with abnormal inhibitory regulation of PO by ZI. We recorded single units from ZI and PO in animals with CPS resulting from spinal cord lesions. Consistent with our hypothesis, the spontaneous firing rate and <b>somatosensory</b> <b>evoked</b> <b>responses</b> of ZI neurons were lower in lesioned animals compared with sham-operated controls. In PO, neurons recorded from lesioned rats exhibited significantly higher spontaneous firing rates and greater responses to noxious and innocuous stimuli applied to the hindpaw and to the face. These changes were not associated with increased afferent drive from the spinal trigeminal nucleus or changes in the ventroposterior thalamus. Thus CPS can result from suppressed inputs from the inhibitory nucleus zona incerta to the posterior thalamus...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Brain {{responses}} to auditory and visual stimuli have been previously shown {{to depend on}} the level of spontaneous brain activity in the 8 – 13 Hz range. Our aim was to determine whether <b>somatosensory</b> <b>evoked</b> <b>responses</b> are influenced by ongoing rhythmic activity in the 8 – 13 Hz frequency range originating in the sensorimotor cortex (mu rhythm). Methods: We used a whole-head 122 channel magnetoencephalography (MEG) system to record <b>somatosensory</b> <b>evoked</b> fields (SEFs) in response to median nerve stimulation in 11 subjects. Spontaneous oscillations in the 8 – 13 Hz band over the contralateral sensorimotor cortex were evaluated in 3 different pre-stimulus time intervals using wavelet analysis. Results: The N 20 m SEF deflection did not depend on pre-stimulus activity, while the amplitude of the P 35 m deflection, {{and to a lesser extent}} that of the P 60 m deflection, showed a small positive correlation with the amplitude of the pre-stimulus mu rhythm. Although the amplitude of the mu rhythm varied by a factor of 2. 3 – 5, the maximum variations in P 35 m and P 60 m amplitude were only 21 and 12 %, respectively. The latencies of the peaks were not affected by the strength of the pre-stimulus mu rhythm. Conclusions: It appears that the first excitatory cortical response (N 20 m) is independent of the oscillatory state (8 – 13 Hz frequency range) of the sensorimotor cortex. Later parts of the response (P 35 m and P 60 m) are also relatively stable compared with the large variations in mu rhythm...|$|R
40|$|Percutaneous {{electrical}} {{stimulation of the}} motor cortex {{was used to evaluate}} corticospinal conduction to upper-limb motoneurons in 29 patients with multiple sclerosis. Central motor conduction abnormalities were correlated with clinical signs and <b>somatosensory</b> <b>evoked</b> potentials. Muscle <b>responses</b> to cortical stimulation were altered in 20 patients. The most common abnormality was increased central motor conduction time; in two cases the responses to cortical stimulation were absent. Abnormalities were also present in patients with no clinical evidence of corticomotoneuron deficit. Alterations of muscle <b>responses</b> and of <b>somatosensory</b> <b>evoked</b> potentials were usually correlated, but may appear independently. Both testing methods are useful in the study of patients with multiple sclerosis...|$|R
