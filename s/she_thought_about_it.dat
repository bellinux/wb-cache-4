500|$|In {{the summer}} of 2000, Stevens was offered the {{opportunity}} to volunteer in the Butler basketball office. He ran the idea of quitting his job at Eli Lilly by then-longtime girlfriend Tracy Wilhelmy. <b>She</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> for two hours before telling him to go for it. [...] "Now, {{it looks like a}} great idea," [...] Stevens later remarked. [...] "At the time, I thought it was something I really wanted to try." [...] Tracy went back to school to get a law degree that could support the couple if things did not work out for Brad. [...] "We were 23 and realized this was our chance," [...] Tracy later said. [...] "Five years down the road, we were probably {{not going to be in}} a position to do that. The more success you had at Lilly, the harder it would be to leave." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{portion of}} the clip's premise was {{inspired}} by Jackson's then-relationship with record producer Jermaine Dupri, which was unconfirmed and had generated speculation within the media. Meyers explained, [...] "In the other video we were shooting, {{she came out of}} the trailer wearing a So So Def jacket, and that's when I got the idea, 'it would be great if you do a whole video if you look like you do now when you're going home'. It took her a minute, <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> she asked JD if he'd be okay with doing the video, 'cus I was begging and I was like, 'if I could get the two of you in a simple video together, it's gonna be gold.' She asked and he said yea, and that's when my video came to life." [...] Meyers also had the idea for Dupri's cameo due to persistent rumors of their relationship circulating in the media, saying [...] "That's the whole concept here, a real simple video and then the slam dunk is JD's in the video. He hasn't been in any of her stuff and all the rumors of 'are they together, are they not together.'" ...|$|E
60|$|Oh yes! {{the more}} <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> all, the more sure was she that Percy {{was already in}} Boulogne, and that he knew of her capture and her danger.|$|E
5000|$|How she {{had wanted}} to go on after setting fire to the apartment. Whether <b>she</b> had <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> If <b>she</b> had, in what way ...|$|R
60|$|She merely replied, {{and that}} evasively and hurriedly: Why should she? <b>She</b> had not <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> He seemed, to her, {{to have so}} {{little to do with}} it.|$|R
50|$|Balliett was {{inspired}} by the number 3, as it appeared in the triangles of Wright's windows on the Robie House. <b>She</b> then <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> how <b>it</b> was hard to communicate equally with three people and tried to weave the two together.|$|R
60|$|He {{occupied}} the post Austin had occupied. On the whole, Olivia was amused, but while <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> {{they passed the}} end of a path that turned off through the corn.|$|E
60|$|Full of her discovery, Mrs Craw set {{the candle}} on the table, {{and sat down}} on the chair by the bedside to think about it; but the more <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> the more puzzled she was.|$|E
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> {{all that}} afternoon, {{and in the}} evening she came to a resolution. She would {{write a letter to}} her cousin and persuade him if {{possible}} to desist. If he should again annoy her after that she would appeal to her aunt. Then she wrote and sent her letter, which was as follows;-- ...|$|E
60|$|Well, {{we talked}} {{it over a}} bit, {{and in the end}} I agreed to sound Prissy, and find out what <b>she</b> really <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> I didn't think {{it would be hard to}} do; and it wasn't. I went over the very next day because I saw Emmeline driving off to the store. I found Prissy alone, sewing carpet rags. Emmeline kept her {{constantly}} at that--because Prissy hated it I suppose. Prissy was crying when I went in, and in a few minutes I had the whole story.|$|R
6000|$|A {{week later}} Mrs. Boyd left for Vancouver, and Margaret, bending over her delirious patient, {{could not even}} go to the station to see her off. But <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> little <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> All her hopes were centred on pulling Freda Martin through; and when, after a long, {{doubtful}} fortnight, Dr. Forbes pronounced her {{on the way to}} recovery, Margaret felt as if she had given the gift of life to a fellow creature. [...] "Oh, I am so glad I stayed," [...] she whispered to herself.|$|R
60|$|Lucy {{was riding}} {{down into the}} sage toward the monuments with a whole day before her. Bostil kept {{more and more to}} himself, a {{circumstance}} that worried her, though <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> little <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Van had taken up the training of the King; and Lucy had deliberately quarreled with him so that she would be free to ride where she listed. Farlane nagged her occasionally about her rides into the sage, insisting that she must not go so far and stay so long. And after Van's return to work he made her ride Sarchedon.|$|R
60|$|All {{that day}} <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> to herself, {{and all the}} next day. On {{the evening of the}} second day she had all but brought herself to give in. Then came George's note, and the fancied tone of triumph {{hardened}} her heart once more. On the evening of that day she was firm to her principles. She had acted hitherto, and would continue to act, according to the course she had laid down for herself.|$|E
60|$|Accordingly, {{soon after}} breakfast the {{carriage}} {{was at the}} door. There was only room for four inside, and the archdeacon got upon the box. Eleanor found herself opposite to Mr. Arabin, and was, therefore, in a manner forced into conversation with him. They were soon on comfortable terms together, and had <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> she would have thought that, {{in spite of his}} black cloth, Mr. Arabin would not have been a bad addition to the Stanhope family party.|$|E
60|$|She {{knew now}} she had not loved Shillito. He had cunningly worked upon her ignorance, discontent, and longing for romance. Illumination had come on board the train, but {{although}} she had found him out and escaped, she had afterwards felt herself humiliated and set apart from happy girls who had nothing to hide. The humiliation was not altogether earned, {{and the people who}} knew about her adventure were not numerous, but they were all the people for whom she cared. When <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> she hated Louis Shillito.|$|E
60|$|Elinor, having once {{delivered}} {{her opinion}} on William's side, by which she offended Mrs. Ferrars and Fanny still more, {{did not see}} the necessity of enforcing it by any farther assertion; and Marianne, when called on for hers, offended them all, by declaring that she had no opinion to give, as <b>she</b> had never <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b>|$|R
50|$|During the cross-examination, {{counsel for}} Crowley tried to impugn May's character, asking her if <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> it {{fraudulent}} to publish Tiger Woman {{as her own}} work when she now admitted {{that she was not}} the author. May replied that <b>she</b> had not <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> <b>She</b> said that part of the work was written from articles she had provided to the newspapers and it was partly true, but when pressed admitted that much of it was fabrication.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>thought</b> much <b>about</b> <b>it</b> before <b>she</b> could resolve on {{what she}} would do. She could not ask old Mrs. Green to help her. Mrs. Green was a kind old woman, who had lived much in the world, and would wish to see much of it still, had age allowed her. Arabella Trefoil was at any rate the niece of a Duke, and the Duke, in this affair with Lord Rufford, had taken his niece's part. She opened her house and as much of her heart as was left to Arabella, {{and was ready to}} mourn with her over the wicked lord. She could sympathise with her too, as to the iniquities of her mother, whom none of the Greens loved. But she would have been frightened by any {{proposition}} as to Medean vengeance.|$|R
60|$|As for the Water Sprite, {{she was in}} a truly disconsolate mood, {{because she}} had left so soon the Land of the Lovely Lakes, where she had been so happy. The more <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> the more she grieved; and one morning, unable to bear her sorrow longer, she sprang into the great jet of the {{fountain}}. High into the bright air the fountain threw her, scattering her into a thousand drops of glittering water; but not one drop fell back into the basin. The great, warm sun drew them up; and, in a little white cloud, they floated away across the bright blue sky.|$|E
60|$|Old Mr. Gould {{would not}} be denied driving her home in his gig, and when <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> she found she had a strange relaxed aching of the knees, which made her glad of {{kindness}} for herself and the little ones. In the fine old kitchen she found that Armine had had an overpowering fit of crying, which had been kindly soothed by motherly Mrs. Gould, and the whole party were partaking of a luxurious tea, enlivened by mince pies and rosy-cheeked apples, which had diverted {{his attention to the}} problem why the next year's prosperity should depend on the number of mince pies consumed before Christmas.|$|E
60|$|But {{the more}} <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> the more bewildered she felt. Faster fell the snow, colder blew the wind, darker grew the night; and poor Effie {{made up her}} mind that she was quite {{forgotten}} and left to freeze alone. The tears were chilled on her cheeks, her feet felt like icicles, and her heart died within her, so hungry, frightened, and forlorn was she. Laying her head on her knees, she gave herself up for lost, and sat there with the great flakes fast turning her to a little white mound, when suddenly the sound of music reached her, and starting up, she looked and listened with all her eyes and ears.|$|E
50|$|Feeling {{severely}} {{guilty in}} sleeping with Wang-Chim, Ka-Lok convinced Big Ding to get married. Even though things were looking great, Ka-Lok's guilt over her infidelity was affecting her. She confided to Long-Kiu over what happened, explaining her debt to Wang-Chim was too great {{and she felt}} only her body {{was the only thing}} she can give him; it was guilt-sex and <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> admitting <b>it</b> to Big Ding, but Long-Liu was against it. She warned Ka-Lok that Big Ding hates liars and event worst, infidelity (due to his father cheating on his mother and having an illegitimate son); keeping it a secret {{is the only way to}} have a happy life with Big Ding. Unfortunately, Wang-Chim wouldn't let Ka-Lok go. He confronted Ka-Lok outside her building and tried to convince her they belonged to each other. Sadly, Big Ding saw and heard the whole thing and ragingly left in tears and shock, ending their relationship.|$|R
50|$|However, when Cline began {{recording}} the song {{a few weeks}} later in November 1960, <b>she</b> had second <b>thoughts</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> especially after <b>she</b> discovered that popular Nashville background singer group, The Jordanaires, would serve as the support vocalists. Cline was afraid The Jordanaires would drown out her sound, and as a result, she was not very friendly upon meeting them for the first time, according to Jordanaire member Gordon Stoker. Cline also felt that the Pop ballad style Bradley wanted it recorded in did not suit her own style, but Bradley was trying to make the song appeal to the Pop market, an idea that Cline rejected wholeheartedly.|$|R
60|$|Captain Frederic Folliott Aylmer was, in truth, {{the nephew}} of Mrs. Winterfield, whereas Clara Amedroz was not, in truth, her niece. And Captain Aylmer was also Member of Parliament for the little borough of Perivale, {{returned}} altogether on the Low Church interest,--for a devotion to which, and for that alone, Perivale was noted among boroughs. These facts together added not a little to Mrs. Winterfield's influence and professorial power in the place, and gave a dignity to the one-horse chaise which it might not otherwise have possessed. But Captain Aylmer was only the second son of his father, Sir Anthony Aylmer, who had married a Miss Folliott, sister of our Mrs. Winterfield. On Frederic Aylmer his mother's estate was settled. That and Mrs. Winterfield's property lay in the neighbourhood of Perivale; and now, on the occasion to which I am alluding, Mrs. Winterfield thought it necessary to tell Clara that the property must all go together. <b>She</b> had <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> and had doubted <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> and had prayed <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> and now she found that such a disposition of it was her duty.|$|R
60|$|All {{that night}} Saxon lay, unsleeping, without taking off her clothes, {{and when she}} arose {{in the morning and}} washed her face and dressed her hair she was aware of a strange numbness, of a feeling of {{constriction}} about her head as if it were bound by a heavy band of iron. It seemed like a dull pressure upon her brain. It was the beginning of an illness that she did not know as illness. All she knew was that she felt queer. It was not fever. It was not cold. Her bodily health was as it should be, and, when <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> she put her condition down to nerves--nerves, according to her ideas and the ideas of her class, being unconnected with disease.|$|E
60|$|Lucia's pretty {{blue eyes}} had looked up shyly as he spoke, {{and now a}} smile parted her rosy lips; and she stole a glance at her mother to see what <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> all; but the dame stood lost in amazement to find that her daughter, whom she could have {{declared}} had never been out of her sight, was already well acquainted with the handsome stranger, and quite willing to be his bride. Before she had done staring, this hasty wooer had smoothed his way by covering the shining table with gold pieces as a wedding gift to the bride's mother, and had filled Lucia's apron into the bargain; after which the dame made no difficulties, and the matter was speedily settled.|$|E
60|$|Kenwardine {{had then}} {{suggested}} that she make a long visit to her aunts, in the cathedral town. They had received her gladly but she soon found her stay there irksome. The aunts were austere, religious women, who moved in a narrow groove and ordered all their doings by a worn-out social code. Still, they were kind and gave Clare to understand that she was to stay with them always and have no {{more to do with}} Kenwardine than duty demanded. The girl rebelled. She shrank with innate dislike from license and dissipation, but the life her aunts led was dreary, and she could not give up her father. Though inexperienced, she was intelligent and she saw that her path would not be altogether smooth now that she was going home for good. While <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> the trap arrived and the shabby groom drove her up the hill with confused apologies.|$|E
60|$|Reddy Fox {{lived with}} Granny Fox. You see, Reddy {{was one of}} a large family, so large that Mother Fox had hard work to feed so many hungry little mouths and so she had let Reddy go to live with old Granny Fox. Granny Fox was the wisest, slyest, smartest fox in all the country round, and now that Reddy had grown so big, <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>about</b> time that he began to learn the things that every fox should know. So every day she took him hunting with her and taught him all the things that she had learned about hunting: about how to steal Farmer Brown's {{chickens}} without awakening Bowser the Hound, and all about the thousand and one ways of fooling a dog which she had learned.|$|R
6000|$|She said it so softly, {{with some}} womanly gentleness, yet with such lofty candor, that Alan couldn't help admiring {{her more than}} ever before for her {{translucent}} simplicity, and directness of purpose. Yet her suggestion frightened him. It was so much more novel to him than to her. Herminia had reasoned it all out with herself, as she truly said, for years, and knew exactly how <b>she</b> felt and <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> To Alan, on the contrary, it came with the shock of a sudden surprise, and he could hardly tell {{on the spur of the}} moment how to deal with it. He paused and reflected. [...] "But do you mean to say, Herminia," [...] he asked, still holding that soft brown hand unresisted in his, [...] "you've made up your mind never to marry any one? made up your mind to brave the whole mad world, that can't possibly understand the motives of your conduct, and live with some friend, as you put it, unmarried?" ...|$|R
60|$|And {{then that}} very clergyman himself would torment her;--he that told {{her from the}} pulpit on Sundays how frightfully vain were all {{attempts}} at worldly happiness. He would come {{to her on the}} Monday with a good-natured, rather rubicund face, and would ask after all her little worldly belongings,--for he knew of her history and her means,--and he would joke with her, and tell her comfortably of his grown sons and daughters, who were prospering in worldly matters, and express the fondest solicitude as to their worldly advancement. Twice or thrice a year Mrs. Ray would go to the parsonage, and such evenings would be by no means hours of wailing. Tea and buttered toast on such occasions would be very manifestly in the ascendant. Mrs. Ray never questioned the propriety of her clergyman's life, nor taught herself to see a discrepancy between his doctrine and his conduct. But she believed in both, and was unconsciously troubled at having her belief so varied. <b>She</b> never <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> or discovered that her friend allowed himself to be carried away in his sermons by his zeal, and that he condemned this world in all things, hoping that he might thereby teach his hearers to condemn it in some things. Mrs. Ray would allow herself the privilege of no such argument as that. It was all gospel to her. The parson in the church, and the parson out of the church, were alike gospels to her sweet, white, credulous mind; but these differing gospels troubled her and tormented her.|$|R
60|$|In {{spite of}} her {{hopelessness}} in regard to Mr. Quack, {{there is no doubt}} that Mrs. Quack felt better that night after she had eaten the corn left among the rushes of the Smiling Pool by Farmer Brown's boy. Now she had that very comfortable feeling that goes with a full stomach, she could think better. As the Black Shadows crept across the Smiling Pool, she turned over in her mind Sammy Jay's plan for helping her the next day. The more <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> the better it seemed, and she began to feel a little ashamed that she had not appeared more grateful to Sammy when he told her. At the time she had been tired and hungry and discouraged. Now she was beginning to feel rested, and she was no longer hungry. These things made all the difference in the world. As she thought over Sammy's plan, she began to feel a little hope, and when at last she put her head under her wing to go to sleep, she had made up her mind that the plan was worth trying, and that she would do her part.|$|E
6000|$|But Mrs. Sparsit's {{greatest}} point, {{first and}} last, was her determination to pity Mr. Bounderby. There were occasions when {{in looking at}} him she was involuntarily moved to shake her head, as who would say, 'Alas, poor Yorick!' After allowing herself to be betrayed into these evidences of emotion, she would force a lambent brightness, and would be fitfully cheerful, and would say, 'You have still good spirits, sir, I am thankful to find;' and would appear to hail it as a blessed dispensation that Mr. Bounderby bore up as he did. One idiosyncrasy for which she often apologized, she found it excessively difficult to conquer. She had a curious propensity to call Mrs. Bounderby 'Miss Gradgrind,' and yielded to it some three or four score times {{in the course of}} the evening. Her repetition of this mistake covered Mrs. Sparsit with modest confusion; but indeed, she said, it seemed so natural to say Miss Gradgrind: whereas, to persuade herself that the young lady whom she had had the happiness of knowing from a child could be really and truly Mrs. Bounderby, she found almost impossible. It was a further singularity of this remarkable case, that the more <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> the more impossible it appeared; 'the differences,' she observed, 'being such.' ...|$|E
60|$|But {{when she}} did make up her mind to look out of the windows, she became greatly interested, {{especially}} at the bow, where she could gaze out into the water illuminated by the long lane of light thrown out by the search-light. Here she continually imagined she saw things, and sometimes greatly startled the men on lookout by her exclamations. Once she thought she saw a floating corpse, but fortunately it was Sammy who was by her when she proclaimed her discovery, {{and he did not}} believe in any such nonsense, suggesting that it might have been some sort of a fish. After that the idea of fish filled the mind of Mrs. Block, and she set herself to work to search in an encyclopaedia which was on board for descriptions of fishes which inhabited the depths of the arctic seas. To meet a whale, she thought, would be very bad, but then a whale is clumsy and soft; a sword-fish was what she most dreaded. A sword-fish running his sword through one of the glass windows, and perhaps coming in himself along with the water, sent a chill down her back every time <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> and talked about it.|$|E
50|$|The next morning, Chandar comes {{looking for}} Pammi who was smoking. He asks {{what she is}} doing here alone. She asks why. He says he was worried for her, she asks then? He says he started to find her. She shows him a {{mountain}} and asks what is there. He says border. She asks if he doesn’t want to touch that border. He says he always like staying in limits. She says she always loves crossing borders. Pammi says they are so different, why are they friends. Chandar says <b>she</b> must have <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Pammi asks if he thinks there is some special reason. Chandar says he doesn’t think so, it could be anyone else as well. Pammi says she thinks if it wasn’t him, it would be no one. She says that everything that happens is for a reason, if they have meet, there must be some plan of life behind it. Chandar says he doesn’t accept it, he makes his own plans. There is a bomb blast near them, both roll down the snow.|$|R
50|$|In {{the cottage}} Rosie {{was greeted by}} Miss Kittie and Miss Rooke who offered her cake and a drink then Mr Robin Goodfellow, to whom the parcel was addressed, came in. Rosie went into the study to see him. Goodfellow who was {{actually}} the Djinn saw through Rosie's disguise {{when she tried to}} hand him the parcel and he revealed his walking stick to be a sorcerer's sword which only Djinn and Rosie could see. He tried to get Rosie to bow her head and swear obedience to him. When she refused he said he had time and read while he waited. The Djinn appeared to read Rosie's mind and tried to encourage her when <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> what <b>it</b> {{would be like to be}} a Djinn. When the Djinn tried to temp Rosie again Sidri broke in through the window and convinced her to stay on the good side. Rosie slipped the parcel into the Djinn's hand and while Sidri distracted him she escaped to her bike and the stuffed animals in his study came to life and chased after her. Rosie cycled as fast as she could whilst the animals led by the wolf pursued her. During the escape Rosie fell off the bike so she went into the wood trying to hide but the animals still found her. Rosie climbed a tree and the animals circled the bottom. The Djinn got the ivy on the tree to bind Rosie then he tried to force her to take back the Djinn Star. Rosie resisted him even when the ivy chocked and tortured her.|$|R
