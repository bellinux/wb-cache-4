The historian Benjamin Woolley theorised that: [...] "His actions suggested he had so enthusiastically sought Ada's involvement, and so happily indulged her... because of her 'celebrated name'." [...] Their friendship recovered, and they continued to correspond. On 12 August 1851, when she was dying of cancer, Lovelace wrote to him asking him to be her executor, though this letter did not give him the necessary legal authority. Part of the terrace at Worthy Manor was known as Philosopher's Walk, as it was there that Lovelace and Babbage were reputed to have walked while discussing mathematical principles.|$|E
