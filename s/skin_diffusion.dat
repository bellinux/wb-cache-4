Ibuprofen per se and its complex prepared with cows ghee (studied in our previous work) in dose 300 mg/Kg, were administered orally to Swiss albino male mice and comparison of concentration in plasma for first three hrs, obtained (by centrifuging of blood samples) and brain for first three hrs (by brain homogenization) as well as intestinal absorption (by cutting 1. 75 cm segment of jejunum, filled with 5 mg/ 0. 5 ml) and in-vitro skin permeability for 18 hrs (through 2 cm diameter excised epidermis (skin) of mice) were carried out and analyzed at UV spectrophotometer at λmax 264 nm.

40|$|A viable {{in vitro}} excised human skin model was {{developed}} to accurately assess cutaneous delivery and metabolism of two ester type compounds; tetracaine (TC) and methyl salicylate (MS). This model could maintain the viability of fresh <b>skin</b> in <b>diffusion</b> cells for 24 hours. Skin viability was assessed using two methods; oxygen consumption measurement and confocal laser scanning microscopy. Two fluorescent probes, calcein AM and ethidium homodimer- 1, were used as live and dead markers, respectively. General morphology and localization of nonspecific esterase activity in the <b>skin</b> samples from <b>diffusion</b> cell were checked histologically. Cutaneous delivery and metabolism of MS was evaluated with this viable skin model and compared to human skin homogenate model. A sensitive high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) assay using reversed phase ion pair was developed/refined to simultaneously analyze TC and its metabolite (4 -BABA). Several factors affecting this HPLC system were identified. The limit of detection for TC and 4 -BABA was 0. 3 ng and 0. 5 ng, respectively. The limit of quantitation for TC and 4 -BABA was 10 ng and 5 ng, respectively. Linearity was {{in the range of}} 10 - 120 ng for TC and 5 - 60 ng for 4 -BABA. MS was hydrolyzed to salicylic acid (SA) during absorption through fall thickness human breast <b>skin</b> in <b>diffusion</b> cells. The extent of MS hydrolysis was significantly higher in viable skin than in non viable. The extent of absorption of SA through viable and non viable skins was similar. In human skin homogenate, MS was hydrolyzed at the rate of 72. 31 nmol/h/[mu]g protein while the hydrolysis in phosphate buffered saline was very low. TC hydrolysis in human skin homogenate was not extensive due to substrate inhibition. From the kinetic study of TC hydrolysis in human skin homogenate, Km was in the 11 - 28 [mu]M range and Vmax was in the 2. 0 - 2. 8 [mu]mol/h/[mu]g protein range. Temperature over 60 °C substantially reduced esterase activity in both models therefore caution must be taken during preparation and handling of tissue samples to preserve esterase activity.

40|$|Background: Honeybush {{extracts}} (Cyclopia spp.) can {{be incorporated}} into skin care products to treat conditions such as skin dryness and can function as an anti-oxidant. Objective: To formulate Honeybush formulations and test it for antioxidant activity, skin penetration and skin hydrating effects. Materials and Methods: Semi-solid formulations containing either Cyclopia maculata (2 %) or Cyclopia genistoides (2 %) underwent accelerated stability studies. Membrane release studies, Franz cell <b>skin</b> <b>diffusion</b> and tape stripping studies were performed. Antioxidant potential was determined with the TBA-assay and clinical efficacy studies were performed to determine the formulations’ effect on skin hydration, scaliness and smoothness after two weeks of treatment on the volar forearm. Results: The formulations were unstable over three months. Membrane release, <b>skin</b> <b>diffusion</b> studies and tape stripping showed that both formulations had inconclusive results due to extremely low concentrations mangiferin and hesperidin present in the Franz cell receptor compartments, stratum corneum-epidermis and epidermis-dermis layers of the skin. Honeybush extracts showed antioxidant activity with concentrations above 0. 6250 mg/ml when compared to the toxin; whereas mangiferin and hesperidin did not show any antioxidant activity on their own. The semisolid formulations showed the potential to emit their own antioxidant activity. Both formulations improved skin smoothness, although they did not improve skin hydration compared to the placebos. Cyclopia maculata reduced the skin scaliness to a larger extent than the placebos and Cyclopia genistoides. Conclusion: Honeybush formulations did not penetrate the skin but did however show antioxidant activity and the potential to be used to improve skin scaliness and smoothness. [URL]...|$|E
40|$|In a novel {{application}} of two-photon scanning fluorescence microscopy, three-dimensional spatial distributions of the hydrophilic and hydrophobic fluorescent probes, sulforhodamine B and rhodamine B hexyl ester, in excised full-thickness human cadaver skin were visualized and quantified. Both sulforhodamine B and rhodamine B hexyl ester were observed to lie {{primarily in the}} lipid multilamellae region surrounding the corneocytes within the stratum corneum. From the two-photon scanning fluorescence microscopy scans, {{the changes in the}} concentration gradient and the vehicle to skin partition coefficient of each probe induced by the oleic acid enhancer action were calculated relative to the control sample (not exposed to oleic acid), and subsequently applied to theoretically derived mathematical expressions of transdermal transport to quantitatively characterize the oleic acid-induced relative changes in the <b>skin</b> <b>diffusion</b> coefficient and the skin barrier diffusion length of the permeant. For the hydrophobic probe rhodamine B hexyl ester, the permeability enhancement was primarily driven by an increase in the vehicle to skin partition coefficient, leading to an increase in the steepness of the concentration gradient across the skin. The primary oleic acid-induced changes in the transport properties of the hydrophilic probe sulforhodamine B included increases in the vehicle to skin partition coefficient and the <b>skin</b> <b>diffusion</b> coefficient. These findings utilizing the two-photon scanning fluorescence microscopy methodology and data analysis described here demonstrate that, in addition to providing three-dimensional images that clearly delineate probe distributions in the direction of increasing skin depth, the subsequent quantification of these images provides additional important insight into the mechanistic changes in transdermal transport underlying the visualized changes in probe distributions across the skin...|$|E

The US Navy has experienced in-flight failures of honeycomb components such as the rudder which {{are believed to be}} due to moisture induced degradation. A long-term (52 week) environmental exposure trial was conducted to determine the effects on the flatwise tension (FWT) strength of honeycomb sandwich structure. A conditioning temperature of 70 °C was chosen coupled with high-humidity exposure (85 % and 95 % R. H) to simulate a worst-case hot/wet environment. The trial simulated specimens in which moisture could freely enter the core (direct ingress) and those which were fully sealed and allowed only moisture diffusion through the epoxy matrix of the <b>skins</b> (<b>diffusion</b> ingress). The FWT strength was measured at 4, 9, 16, 32 and 52 weeks exposure. The FWT values decreased by about 40 - 50 % when tested at 104 °C and about 25 % when tested at room temperature after exposure periods greater than 16 weeks. Both the direct ingress and diffusion ingress samples showed similar FWT strength losses but markedly different modes of failure. Diffusion specimens failed cohesively in all cases while the direct ingress samples failed predominantly adhesively after an exposure time of about 9 weeks. Subsequent drying of the samples exposed to the conditioning environment showed that diffusion ingress samples recovered most of their original FWT strength but direct ingress samples recovered only about 70 % of their original baseline strength. This work shows that excluding water from within honeycomb sandwich structures is of primary importance in order to prevent permanent bond degradation and corrosion of the core...|$|R

40|$|Methotrexate (MTX), an {{effective}} systemic antipsoriatic agent, {{has been previously}} demonstrated to be ineffective topically, due to its polar nature, leading to poor stratum corneum permeability. A series of lipophilic MTX dialkyl esters were synthesized and characterized as to their physical properties including melting point partition coefficient, aqueous solubility, and aqueous stability. The compounds were also evaluated for their permeability through full-thickness hairless mouse skin, and permeability/bioconversion through tape-stripped hairless mouse skin. The compounds exhibited a parabolic relationship of permeability versus chain length in both systems, with the optimum compound being dimethyl MTX. In both the tape-stripped hairless mouse <b>skin</b> <b>diffusion</b> studies and in dermal and epidermal homogenates, the compounds demonstrated an increase in hydrolysis rate with chain length, without the regeneration of MTX. Dimethyl MTX, and dipropyl MTX produced no statistically significant effect on hairless mouse epidermal DNA synthesis rate versus control, upon topical application.

In the transport studies, a rapid transfer of BPA was observed across the term placentae and the BeWo cell monolayer. Further, transdermal transport of BPA was observed. These results indicate that fetal BPA exposure through placental exchange occurs with potential adverse implications for placental and fetal development.

40|$|Aims The {{penetration}} of active ingredients from topically applied anti-inflammatory pharmaceutical products into tissues below {{the skin is}} the basis of their therapeutic efficacy. There is still controversy as to whether these agents are capable of direct penetration by diffusion through the tissues or whether redistribution in the systemic circulation is responsible for their tissue deposition below the application site. Methods The extent of direct {{penetration of}} salicylate from commercial ester and salt formulations into the dermal and subcutaneous tissue of human volunteers was determined using the technique of cutaneous microdialysis. We also examined differences in the extent of hydrolysis of the methylester of salicylate applied topically in human volunteers and in vitro <b>skin</b> <b>diffusion</b> cells using full-thickness skin and epidermal membranes. Results The present study showed that whilst significant levels of salicylate could be detected in the dermis and subcutaneous tissue of volunteers treated with the methylsalicylate formulation, negligible levels of salicylate were seen following application of the triethanolamine salicylate formulation. The tissue levels of salicylate from the methylsalicylate formulation were approx. 30 -fold higher than the plasma concentrations.

In this study the influence of Pheroid™ technology, which is a unique colloidal drug delivery system, on the skin permeation and anti-melanoma efficacy of 5 -fluorouracil was investigated. Lotions containing Pheroid™ with different concentrations of 5 -fluorouracil were formulated then used in Franz cell <b>skin</b> <b>diffusion</b> studies and tape-stripping. The in vitro efficacy of 5 -fluorouracil against human melanoma cells (A 375) was investigated using a flow cytometric apoptosis assay. Statistically significant concentrations of 5 -fluorouracil diffused into and through the skin with Pheroid™ formulations resulting in an enhanced in vitro skin permeation from the 4. 0 % 5 -fluorouracil lotion (p< 0. 05). The stratum corneum-epidermis and epidermis-dermis retained 5 -fluorouracil concentrations of 2. 31 μg/ml and 6. 69 μg/ml, respectively after a diffusion study with the 4. 0 % Pheroid™ lotion. Subsequent to the apoptosis assay significant differences were observed between the effect of 13. 33 μg/ml 5 -fluorouracil in Pheroid™ lotion {{and the effects of}} the controls. The results obtained suggest that the Pheroid™ drug delivery system possibly enhances the flux and delivery of 5 -fluorouracil into the skin.

40|$|The {{efficient}} {{removal of}} contaminants from the outer surfaces of the body can provide {{an effective means of}} reducing adverse health effects associated with incidents involving the accidental or deliberate release of hazardous materials. Showering with water is frequently used by first responders as a rapid method of mass casualty decontamination (MCD). However, there is a paucity of data on the generic effectiveness and safety of aqueous decontamination systems. To address these issues, we have developed a new in vitro <b>skin</b> <b>diffusion</b> cell system to model the conditions of a common MCD procedure ("ladder pipe system"). The new diffusion cell design incorporates a showering nozzle, an air sampling port for measurement of vapour loss and/aerosolisation, adjustable (horizontal to vertical) skin orientation and a circulating manifold system (to maintain a specified flow rate, temperature and pressure of shower water). The dermal absorption characteristics of several simulants (Invisible Red S, curcumin and methyl salicylate) measured with the new in vitro model were in good agreement with previous in vitro and in vivo studies. Moreover, these initial studies have indicated that whilst flow rate and water temperature are important factors for MCD, the presence of clothing during showering may (under certain circumstances) cause transfer and spreading of contaminants to the skin surface...|$|E
40|$|A {{computational}} {{study of}} turbulent evaporating sprays is reported. The major focus {{is to examine}} the sensitivity of the vaporization behavior of turbulent sprays to the transient liquid-phase processes. Three models considered to represent these processes are the thin <b>skin,</b> infinite <b>diffusion,</b> and diffusion limit models. Favre-averaged equations with k-epsilon-g turbulence model are employed for the gas phase. The Lagrangian approach with a stochastic separated flow method is used for the liquid phase where the effects of gas turbulence on droplet trajectories and interphase transport rates are considered using random-walk computations. Also the variable-property effects are considered in detail. Results indicate that, depending upon the boiling temperature and heat of vaporization of the fuel considered, the vaporization behavior of turbulent sprays may be quite sensitive to the modeling of transient liquid-phase processes. Thus, it is important that for most hydrocarbon fuels these processes be adequately represented in any comprehensive spray computations. The present results also provide further support to the conclusions of earlier studies which have been based on simplified spray configurations...|$|R

Significant amounts of H- 3 -glucose back diffused only after complete removal of the stratum corneum by tape stripping, and it is likely that any future attempts to monitor blood glucose levels using non-physical techniques will require a certain degree of damage to the stratum corneum. The extraction through the skin of tritiated water and H- 3 -glucose after the application of, solutions with different osmotic pressures were consistent with the theory that solutions with high osmotic pressures dehydrate the stratum corneum which suggests that passive transport of these radiolabelled molecules through porous pathways was insignificant.

In parallel, we produced similar stable SLNs in which 20 % of the OMC content {{was replaced by}} the botanical urucum oil. When these SLNs were applied to the skin of human volunteers, no changes in fluorescence lifetimes or redox ratios of the endogenous skin fluorophores were seen, suggesting that the formulations did not induce toxic responses in the skin. Ex vivo (<b>skin</b> <b>diffusion)</b> tests showed no significant penetration. In vitro studies showed that when 20 % of the OMC was replaced by urucum oil, there was no reduction in skin protection factor (SPF), suggesting that a decrease in the amount of chemical filter may be a viable alternative for an effective sunscreen, in combination with an antioxidant-rich vegetable oil, such as urucum. There is a strong trend towards increasing safety of sun protection products through reduction in the use of chemical UV filters.

Objective: The {{aim of this study}} was to determine whether the novel Pheroid™ delivery system improved the transdermal delivery and/or dermal delivery of acyclovir and ketoconazole when incorporated into semi-solid formulations. Materials and methods: Semi-solid products (creams and emulgels) containing these drug compounds were formulated, either with or without (control) the Pheroid™ delivery system. The stability of the formulated semi-solid products was examined over a period of six months and included the assay of the actives, pH, viscosity, mass loss and particle size observation. Vertical Franz cell diffusion studies and tape stripping methods were used to determine the in vitro, SC-epidermis and epidermis-dermis delivery of these formulations. Results and discussion: Stability tests showed that none of the formulations were completely stable. Acyclovir showed a biphasic character during the in vitro <b>skin</b> <b>diffusion</b> studies for all the tested formulations. The Pheroid™ cream enhanced the transdermal, SC-epidermis and epidermis-dermis delivery of acyclovir the most. The average amount of ketoconazole diffused over 12 h showed improved delivery of ketoconazole, with the Pheroid™ emulgel exhibiting the best transdermal and epidermis-dermis delivery. Conclusion: The Pheroid™ formulae increased transdermal penetration as well as delivery to the dermal and epidermal skin layers.

40|$|Crocin, {{a potent}} {{antioxidant}} obtained fromsaffron, shows anticancer activity in in vivo models. Unfortunately unfavorable physicochemical features compromise {{its use in}} topical therapy. The present study describes the preparation and characterization of nanostructured lipid dispersions as drug delivery systems for topical administration of crocin and the evaluation of antioxidant and anti proliferative effects of crocin once encapsulated into nanostructured lipid dispersions. Nanostructured lipid dispersions based onmonoolein in mixturewith sodiumcholate and sodiumcaseinate have been characterized by cryo-TEM and PCS. Crocin permeation was evaluated in vitro by Franz cells, while the oxygen radical absorbance capacity assay {{was used to evaluate}} the antioxidant activity. Furthermore, the anti proliferative activity was tested in vitro by the MTT test using a human melanoma cell line. The emulsification of monoolein with sodium cholate and sodium caseinate led to dispersions of cubosomes, hexasomes, sponge systems and vesicles, depending on the employed emulsifiers. Permeation and shelf life studies demonstrated that nanostructured lipid dispersions enabled to control both rate of crocin diffusion through the skin and crocin degradation. The oxygen radical absorbance capacity assay pointed out an interesting and prolonged antioxidant activity of crocinwhile the MTT test showed an increase of crocin cytotoxic effect after incorporation in nanostructured lipid dispersions. Thiswork has highlighted that nanostructured lipid dispersions can protect the labilemolecule crocin from degradation, control its <b>skin</b> <b>diffusion</b> and prolong antioxidant activity, therefore suggesting the suitability of nano structured lipid dispersions for crocin topical administration...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} the nonionic surfactant, n -decylmethyl sulfoxide (NDMS), pH, and inhibitors on the metabolism and the permeation of amino acids, dipeptides, and the pentapeptide enkephalin, through hairless mouse skin. An HPLC gradient method was developed to identify the possible peptide and amino acid metabolites of leucine-enkephalin. NDMS increased the permeability of all amino acids and peptides tested. At neural pH, the enzyme activity within the skin was such that no flux of leucine-enkephalin (YGGFL) was observed and the donor cell concentration of YGGFL decreased rapidly. The major cleavage occurred at the Tyr-Gly bond. At pH 5. 0 the metabolic activity was reduced significantly and a substantial flux of YGGFL was observed. Enzymatically stable YGGFL analogues, Tyr-D-Ala-Gly-Phe-Leu (YDAGFL) and its amide, exhibited significant fluxes even at neutral pH in the presence of NDMS, but with substantial metabolism. YDAGFL amide was more stable to metabolism than YDAGFL. The rates of metabolism of the peptides in the skin homogenates were in the order: FL. >>YGGFL > GFL > GGFL >> YG, YGG >> YDAGFL amide. In the skin homogenates puromycin and amastatin showed the highest inhibitory effects, while FL and GFL were only slightly active. However, in the <b>skin</b> <b>diffusion</b> experiments, FL allowed the highest amount of intact parent compound to permeate, making it the most potent inhibitor. These results show that the complex proteolytic enzyme activities occurring during skin permeation are different from those in skin homogenates and that a combination of enhancer, pH adjustment, and inhibitors can increase the transdermal delivery of peptides...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} {{a new class of}} robust multilevel interface solvers for two-dimensional finite element discrete elliptic problems with highly varying coefficients corresponding to strongly anisotropic multigrade geometric decompositions. The global iterations convergence rate q < 1 is shown to be of the order q = 1 - O(log"-" 1 "/" 2 N) with respect to the number N of degrees of freedom on the single subdomain boundaries, uniformly upon the coarse and fine mesh sizes, jumps in the coefficients related to the original decomposition and aspect ratios of substructures. First we adapt the frequency filtering techniques [28] to construct robust additive/multiplicative smoothers on the unstructured coarse grid. As an alternative, some multilevel everaging procedure for successive coarse grid correction is proposed and analyzed. The resultant multilevel coarse grid preconditioner is shown to have the condition number independent upon the multiscale hierarchy of coarse mesh grading and jumps in the coefficients related to the coarset refinement level. The frequency cutting approach is applied for sparse approximation of the factorized cross terms (with respect to adjacent edges) related to the Schur complement on the edge space with an appropriate assembling [18] of parallel neighbouring thin strips. The proposed technique exhibited high serial and parallel performance in the <b>skin</b> <b>diffusion</b> processes modelling. It may be also applied in magnetostatics problems as well as in some composite materials simulations. (orig.)

40|$|Capacitive contact imaging {{has shown}} {{potential}} in measuring skin properties including skin hydration and skin texture. Our previous studies showed {{it also can}} be used for solvent penetration measurements, skin damage assessments, as well as hair and nail water content measurements, despite the low water content. Through calibration we also measure the absolute permittivity of the skin, and from absolute permittivity we then work out the absolute water content (or solvent content) in skin. In this paper, we present our latest study of skin characterization, i. e. dry skin, hydrated skin, sweating, and damaged skin etc., using a commercial contact imaging system, the Epsilon (Biox Systems Ltd, England). We will first present the theoretical background and measurement principles, then illustrate the Epsilon calibrations. We will use experimental results to illustrate how the contact images can be used for skin characterization. Through image processing we can focus on the area that we are interested and eliminate the areas that we are not. We will also show latest results on skin solvent penetrations, and how to calculate the absolute solvent content in <b>skin</b> and <b>diffusion</b> coefficient of the solvent...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this investigation was}} to evaluate phenobarbital transdermal delivery for possible use in paediatric care. In vitro experiments were performed using intact pig skin and barriers from which the stratum corneum had been stripped to different extents to model the less resistant skin of premature babies. Cathodal iontophoretic delivery of phenobarbital was superior to anodal transport and optimised delivery conditions were achieved by reduction of competing co-ion presence in the drug formulation. Phenobarbital transport across intact or partially compromised skin was controlled by iontophoresis which was more efficient than passive diffusion. Across highly compromised <b>skin,</b> however, passive <b>diffusion</b> increased drastically and iontophoretic control was lost. Overall, this study demonstrates the feasibility of phenobarbital transdermal delivery for paediatric patients...|$|R
40|$|A {{suitable}} emulgel {{formulation of}} piroxicam was prepared and its percutaneous permeation was investigated using Wistar rat <b>skin</b> and <b>diffusion</b> cell technique. The concentrations {{of the drug}} in receptor phase of diffusion cells were measured using HPLC method. The effect of three types of penetration enhancers (Myrj 52, cineol and Transcutol P) with different concentrations on transdermal permeation of the drug was also evaluated. Flux, Kp and enhancement ratios (ERs) of piroxicam {{in the presence of}} enhancers was measured and compared with emulgel base alone and simple commercial gel. The results showed a significant enhancement in the flux from emulgel base compared to hydroalcoholic gel formulation (9. 91 folds over simple gel). The highest enhancement ratio (ER= 3. 11) was observed for Myrj 52 at the concentration of 0. 25 %. Higher concentrations of Myrj 52 did not show any enhancement in the drug flux due to micelle formation and solubilization of the drug by micelles. The increase in solubility, in turn, increases the saturated concentration and reduces the thermodynamic activity of the drug. Transcutol® P with concentrations higher than 0. 25 % w/w showed burst transportation of the drug through the skin. All concentrations of cineol and Transcutol did not show any enhancing effects over emulgel base alone (ER < 1) ...|$|R
