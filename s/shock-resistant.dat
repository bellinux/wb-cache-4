2500|$|The {{blade of}} a cricket bat is a wooden block that is {{generally}} {{flat on the}} striking face and with a ridge on the reverse (back) which concentrates wood in the middle where the ball is generally hit. [...] The bat is traditionally made from willow wood, specifically {{from a variety of}} White Willow called Cricket Bat Willow (Salix alba var. caerulea), treated with raw (unboiled) linseed oil, which has a protective function. This variety of willow is used as it is very tough and <b>shock-resistant,</b> not being significantly dented nor splintering on the impact of a cricket ball at high speed, while also being light in weight. The face of the bat is often covered with a protective film by the user.|$|E
2500|$|Vacuum tubes (called [...] "valves" [...] in British English) were {{by far the}} {{dominant}} active electronic components in most instrument amplifier applications until the 1970s, when solid-state semiconductors (transistors) started taking over. Transistor amplifiers are less expensive to build and maintain, reduce the weight and heat of an amplifier, and {{tend to be more}} reliable and more <b>shock-resistant.</b> Tubes are fragile and they must be replaced and maintained periodically. As well, serious problems with the tubes can render an amplifier inoperable until the issue is resolved. In the 2000s, high-end tube instrument amplifiers (along with a small number of hi-fi power amplifiers used by audiophiles and high-end studio microphone preamplifiers) survive as the few exceptions, because of their perceived sound quality.|$|E

50|$|The Chef&Sommelier brand {{was created}} after Mikasa {{was sold in}} 2008, as a brand destined to the {{restaurant}} industry. It features wine-tasting glasses and tumblers made of Kwarx, plates, cups and bowls made of Zenix and porcelain, and stainless steel cutlery. All Chef&Sommelier products claim professional dishwasher resistant (2000 cycles claimed), products made of Zenix and Kwarx lines are thermal and mechanical <b>shock-resistant.</b>|$|E
50|$|There are six {{groups of}} tool steels: water-hardening, cold-work, <b>shock-resistant,</b> high-speed, hot-work, and special purpose. The choice of group to select depends on cost, working temperature, {{required}} surface hardness, strength, shock resistance, and toughness requirements. The more severe the service condition (higher temperature, abrasiveness, corrosiveness, loading), {{the higher the}} alloy content and consequent amount of carbides required for the tool steel.|$|E

5000|$|Tin-lead and tin-copper alloys such as Babbitt metal have a {{low melting}} point that is ideal for use as solder, but these alloys also have ideal {{characteristics}} for plain bearings. Most importantly for bearings, the material should be hard and wear-resistant and {{have a low}} coefficient of friction. It must also be <b>shock-resistant,</b> tough and sufficiently ductile to allow for slight misalignment prior to running-in.|$|E
50|$|In {{the summer}} of 1977, Richard Thalheimer (of The Sharper Image fame), chose Stack to be the poster boy for the Realtime Watch, which Thalheimer {{promoted}} as the first affordable, waterproof, and <b>shock-resistant</b> chronograph that could be reliably used by joggers. Thalheimer took out an ad in Runner's World featuring his friend Walt Stack, and sold thousands of the watches at $69 apiece, earning $1.5 million using Stack's image.|$|E
50|$|The {{locomotive}} provides optimum driving {{conditions with}} a spacious cab which offers the driver unobstructed external vision. The cab is separately air-conditioned to assure agreeable {{conditions for the}} driver and features fire-protection. The windscreen is <b>shock-resistant</b> to further enhance the driver's safety and also ensures minimum noise levels in the cab. An integrated crash system ensures that both the driver and the locomotive are protected {{in the event of}} a collision.|$|E
50|$|The International Organization for Standardization {{issued a}} {{standard}} for <b>shock-resistant</b> watches, which many countries have adopted. ISO 1413 Horology—Shock-resistant watches specifies the minimum requirements and describes the corresponding method of test. It is intended to allow homologation tests rather than the individual control of all watches of a production batch. It {{is based on the}} simulation of the shock received by a watch on falling accidentally from a height of 1 m on to a horizontal hardwood surface.|$|E
50|$|Netbooks {{typically}} have less powerful hardware than larger laptop computers {{and do not}} include an optical disc drive that larger laptops often have. Some netbooks do not even have a conventional hard drive. Such netbooks use solid-state storage devices instead, as these require less power, are faster, lighter, and generally more <b>shock-resistant,</b> but with much less storage capacity (such as 32, 64, or 128 GB compared to the 100 GB to 2 TB mechanical hard drives typical of many notebooks/laptop computers).|$|E
50|$|Shock {{resistant}} is {{a common}} mark stamped {{on the back of}} wrist watches to indicate how well a watch copes with mechanical shocks. In a mechanical watch, it indicates that the delicate pivots that hold the balance wheel are mounted in a spring suspension system intended to protect them from damage if the watch is dropped. One of the earliest and most widely used was the Incabloc system, invented in 1934. Before the widespread adoption of <b>shock-resistant</b> balance pivots in the 1950s, broken balance wheel staffs were a common cause of watch repairs.|$|E
50|$|In 1908, Eugene Sullivan, {{director}} of research at Corning Glass Works, developed Nonex, a borosilicate low-expansion glass, to reduce breakage in <b>shock-resistant</b> lantern globes and battery jars. Sullivan had learned about Schott's borosilicate glass as a doctoral student in Leipzig, Germany. Jesse Littleton of Corning discovered the cooking potential of borosilicate glass by giving his wife a casserole dish made from a cut-down Nonex battery jar. Corning removed the lead from Nonex and developed it as a consumer product. Pyrex made its public debut in 1915 during World War I, positioned as an American-produced alternative to Duran.|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} Windsurfer {{board had}} a body {{made out of}} polyethylene filled with PVC foam. Later, hollow glass-reinforced epoxy designs were used. Most boards produced today have an expanded polystyrene foam core reinforced with a composite sandwich shell, that can include carbon fiber, kevlar, or fiberglass in a matrix of epoxy and sometimes plywood and thermoplastics. Racing and wave boards are usually very light (5 to 7 kg), and are made out of carbon sandwich. Such boards are very stiff, and veneer is sometimes used {{to make them more}} <b>shock-resistant.</b> Boards aimed at the beginners are heavier (8 to 15 kg) and more robust, containing more fiberglass.|$|E
5000|$|The Kel-Lite was a highly-durable, weather- and <b>shock-resistant</b> {{flashlight}} (UK: torch), made {{of heavy}} 6061-T6 aluminium (commonly known as [...] "aircraft aluminium"). {{it was developed}} in 1968 by Donald Keller, a Los Angeles County Deputy Sheriff, who had tired {{of the lack of}} durability of the generically available, cheap metal flashlights of the day. It was later (1973) redesigned by Norm Nelson into the modern version with a battery charger, adjustable lens, baton lights, push button switch, and in three sizes (DKL (D-Cell Kel-Lite), MKL (Medium Head Kel-Lite), SKL (Small Head Kel-Lite)), and penlight versions. The company merged in 1983 with Streamlight. Kel-Lite had manufacturing capability and Streamlight a marketing team.|$|E

50|$|The Luminarc brand was {{introduced}} in 1958, first as a brand for glasses made of annealed glass, then expanding to a generalist tableware items brand with multiple glass materials (Opal, annealed glass, tempered glass, Zenix, vitroceramic). To date it includes glasses, cups, bowls, salad bowls, plates, storage boxes, under concepts such as Color Vibrance, which features organic inks, Zenix, Flashy Colors, featuring organic inks and metallic looks, Pure Box and Keep'N Box. All Luminarc products are dishwhasher safe, all dinnerware lines, tempered storage lines, salad bowls and hot drinks lines are <b>shock-resistant</b> and microwave safe. All major lines {{are made in the}} Arc International headquarters factory in Arques, France. Luminarc also features specific lines under license (Coca-Cola, Hello Kitty, Disney).|$|E
50|$|In recent years, {{with the}} {{resurgence}} of lampworking as a technique to make handmade glass beads, borosilicate has become a popular material in many glass artists' studios. Borosilicate for beadmaking comes in thin, pencil-like rods. Northstar, Trautman Art Glass, Glass Alchemy and Momka's Glass are popular manufacturers, although there are other brands available. The metals used to color borosilicate glass, particularly silver, often create strikingly beautiful and unpredictable results when melted in an oxygen-gas torch flame. Because it is more <b>shock-resistant</b> and stronger than soft glass, borosilicate is particularly suited for pipe making, as well as sculpting figures and creating large beads. The tools used for making glass beads from borosilicate glass {{are the same as}} those used for making glass beads from soft glass.|$|E
5000|$|After {{graduating from}} law school in 1974, Thalheimer passed the California bar exam and practiced law in San Francisco for a year. In 1977, Thalheimer {{discovered}} a product he believed would sell well in magazine advertisements — a special runner's watch, which was a waterproof digital chronograph. In the summer of 1977, Thalheimer chose legendary ultra-marathoner Walt Stack to be the [...] "poster boy" [...] for the Realtime Watch, which Thalheimer promoted as the first affordable, waterproof, and <b>shock-resistant</b> chronograph that could be reliably used by joggers ("The only chronograph that keeps up with the amazing Walt Stack").

50|$|Protective {{equipment}} in gridiron football ("football gear") consists of equipment worn by football players {{for the protection}} of the body during the course of a football game. Basic equipment worn by most football players include helmet, shoulder pads, gloves, shoes, and thigh and knee pads, and a jockstrap or compression shorts with or without a protective cup. Neck rolls, elbow pads, mouth guards, hip pads, tailbone pads, rib pads, and other equipment may be worn in addition to the aforementioned basics. Football protective equipment is made of synthetic materials: foam rubbers, elastics, and durable, <b>shock-resistant,</b> molded plastic. Football protective equipment has remained consistent in use for decades with some slight modifications made over the years in design and materials. The assignment and maintenance of football gear belongs to the team equipment manager.|$|E
50|$|The {{weapon was}} {{developed}} for use by engineer troops after the Siege of Port Arthur during the Russo-Japanese War of 1905. It illustrated the usefulness {{of this type of}} weapon in destroying bunkers and field fortifications otherwise immune to normal artillery. It was a muzzle-loading, rifled mortar that had a standard hydro-spring recoil system. It fired 50 kilogram (110 lb) HE shells, which contained far more explosive filler than ordinary artillery shells of the same caliber. The low muzzle velocity allowed for thinner shell walls, hence more space for filler. Furthermore, the low velocity allowed for the use of explosives like Ammonium Nitrate-Carbon that were less <b>shock-resistant</b> than TNT, which was in short supply. This caused a large number of premature detonations that made crewing the minenwerfer riskier than normal artillery pieces.|$|E
50|$|The {{introduction}} of the quartz watch in 1969 was a revolutionary improvement in watch technology. In place of a balance wheel which oscillated at 5 beats per second, it used a quartz crystal resonator which vibrated at 8,192 Hz, driven by a battery-powered oscillator circuit. In place of a wheel train to add up the beats into seconds, minutes, and hours, it used digital counters. The higher Q factor of the resonator, along with quartz's low temperature coefficient, resulted in better accuracy than the best mechanical watches, while {{the elimination of all}} moving parts made the watch more <b>shock-resistant</b> and eliminated the need for periodic cleaning. The first digital electronic watch with an LED display was developed in 1970 by Pulsar. In 1974 the Omega Marine Chronometer was introduced, the first wrist watch to hold Marine Chronometer certification, and accurate to 12 seconds per year.|$|E
50|$|It was {{developed}} for use by engineer troops after the Siege of Port Arthur during the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-05 illustrated the usefulness of this class of weapon in destroying bunkers and fortifications otherwise immune to normal artillery. The 25 cm schwerer Minenwerfer was a muzzle-loading, rifled mortar that had a hydro-spring type recoil system. It fired either a 97 kg (210 lb) shell or a 50 kg (110 lb) shell, both contained far more explosive filler than ordinary artillery shells of the same caliber. The low muzzle velocity allowed for thinner shell walls, hence more space for filler for the same weight shell. The low velocity also allowed the use of explosives like ammonium nitrate-carbon that were less <b>shock-resistant</b> than TNT, which was in short supply at the time. Shells filled with these substitutes nonetheless were the cause of many premature detonation accidents, making the Minenwerfer riskier for the gun crew than normal artillery pieces.|$|E
5000|$|The use of {{transistors}} {{instead of}} vacuum tubes as the amplifier elements {{meant that the}} device was much smaller, required far less power to operate than a tube radio, and was more <b>shock-resistant.</b> Since the transistor base draws current, its input impedance is low {{in contrast to the}} high input impedance of the vacuum tubes. It also allowed [...] "instant-on" [...] operation, since there were no filaments to heat up. The typical portable tube radio of the fifties was about the size and weight of a lunchbox, and contained several heavy, non-rechargeable batteries— one or more so-called [...] "A" [...] batteries to heat the tube filaments and a large 45- to 90-volt [...] "B" [...] battery to power the signal circuits. By comparison, the transistor radio could fit in a pocket and weighed half a pound or less, and was powered by standard flashlight batteries or a single compact 9-volt battery. The now-familiar 9-volt battery was introduced for powering transistor radios.|$|E
5000|$|The camera {{had to be}} {{converted}} to use parts from Rollei's suppliers, as Rollei did not maintain business relations with Metrawatt and Steinheil. A high-quality Tessar lens was made by Zeiss. Rollei's light meter supplier was Gossen. Whether to use either a photovoltaic selenium sensor or a CdS photoresistor, was finally decided in August in favour of the CdS. Gossen named the same measuring range for both solutions. A selenium-cell powered light meter was cheaper in production and did not need a battery. However, the much smaller CdS-photoresistor improved the stylish look of the camera, the battery powered light-meter was more <b>shock-resistant,</b> and the [...] "CdS technology" [...] {{could be used as}} a selling point in advertising.The housing needed to be changed just slightly, since Waaske unknowingly had adopted the appearance of Rollei's twin-lens reflex cameras, by placing the exposure time and aperture controls to the right and to the left side of the lens. Nevertheless, Rollei's designer Ernst Moeckl revised the housing, and by changing the edge radius made the camera body even smaller.|$|E

Typically, tube amps use one or more dual triodes in the preamplifier section to provide sufficient voltage gain to offset tone control losses and drive the power amplifier section. While tube technology is, in many ways, outdated, tube amps remain popular since many guitarists prefer their sound.|$|E
40|$|Heat <b>shock-resistant</b> mutants, {{which were}} {{isolated}} by {{their ability to}} withstand lethal heat treatment, were characterized. Resistance was demonstrated to be a consequence of insertion of retrotransposon Ty into either the 5 ' coding or noncoding region, close to the putative initiation codon of the adenylate cyclase gene CYR 1 (or CDC 35). These heat <b>shock-resistant</b> mutants contained about threefold lower adenylate cyclase activity than wild-type strains. The mutants were also observed to be resistant to other stresses such as UV light and ethanol. These results demonstrate that multistress resistance, which may confer a survival advantage to yeast cells, can be generated by transposition of a Ty element into CYR 1...|$|E
