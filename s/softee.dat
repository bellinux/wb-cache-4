2500|$|Mahoney {{left the}} company after the acquisition, and Lipton {{executives}} soon characterized Good Humor as a [...] "problem." [...] Much of the fleet purchased immediately after the war was now {{at the end of}} its useful life. Further, as the baby boomers matured, sales on many suburban routes declined. While almost from the beginning Good Humor faced competition from companies such as Jack and Jill Ice Cream, Bungalow Bar, etc., it was not until the advent of soft ice cream trucks operated by companies such as Mister <b>Softee</b> that competition impacted sales. Insurance costs also increased because courts found ice cream vendors responsible for pedestrian accidents while crossing streets to and from the truck.|$|E
5000|$|Mister <b>Softee</b> has {{in recent}} years defended its {{trademarks}} in well-publicized cases. In 2015 Mister <b>Softee</b> won a trademark infringement case in federal court against Dimitrios Tsirkos, a former Mister <b>Softee</b> franchisee in New York who had been operating a competing ice cream vending operation called [...] "Master Softee." [...] The next year, Mister <b>Softee</b> won a case against Dimitrios Konstantakakos, owner of [...] "New York Ice Cream," [...] preventing him from using the iconic Mister <b>Softee</b> jingle. With respect to defending the trademarks, Mister <b>Softee</b> vice president Jim Conway has stated, [...] "For 58 years we’ve spent our time, energy, and money developing brands. We’re {{one of the most}} recognized brands. The people who are infringing on our trademark are not only hurting Mr. <b>Softee,</b> but also hurting our mom and pop franchisees. We take these actions to protect them as much to protect our own brand." ...|$|E

50|$|The Mr. <b>Softee</b> jingle {{is written}} in E-flat major with 6/8 time.

In New York City, the trucks are permitted to only play the jingle while moving, to reduce noise.|$|E

50|$|Mister <b>Softee</b> is a United States-based {{ice cream}} truck {{franchisor}} {{popular in the}} Northeast. It was founded by William Conway and James Conway (October 30, 1927 - May 28, 2006) in 1956 in Philadelphia {{and is one of}} the largest franchisors of soft ice cream in the United States, with about 350 franchisees operating 600 trucks in 15 states. The company is headquartered in Runnemede, New Jersey and is still run by the Conway family, co-owned by cousins Jim Conway Jr. and John Conway.|$|E
5000|$|Postal workers {{also use}} them in larger deliveries. Parcel {{companies}} such as UPS and FedEx have used them for decades. Since 1966, Grumman Olson, and Southern, have made UPS trucks designed exclusively for that company. Ice cream distributors such as Mister <b>Softee</b> and others have found these types of trucks {{to be far more}} suitable than cowl-and-chassis-based pickup trucks. Many have been converted into [...] "Jitney" [...] buses. Some are converted into motor homes either by manufacturers or private citizens who buy used models.|$|E

5000|$|He toured playing guitar accompaniment {{for several}} gospel groups, and {{reckoned}} he first recorded with the Bells of Joy in Texas. Quattlebaum recorded solo in 1953, as a blues singer and guitarist, for the Philadelphia-based Gotham Records. He cut three tracks for the label, [...] "Don't Be Funny, Baby", [...] "Lizzie Lou", and [...] "Foolin' Me". The first two were released as a 78-rpm single by Gotham the same year; [...] "Foolin' Me" [...] was not released until many years later. The recording {{was not a}} success, and Quattlebaum fell into obscurity, but by 1961 he was back, playing accompaniment for the Ward Singers. In June the same year, he was [...] "rediscovered" [...] playing popular and blues songs through the public address system of his Mister <b>Softee</b> ice cream van. The blues historian Pete Welding, who became known for discovering talent in unusual places, heard his performances and arranged for him to record an album for Testament Records. For reasons unknown it was not released, but Welding recorded him again the following year for the album <b>Softee</b> Man Blues (financed by Moe of the Pep Boys), released by Bluesville Records in 1963. The front cover of the album displayed a photograph of Quattlebaum in his ice cream uniform.|$|E
50|$|In Hong Kong, {{ice cream}} vans {{operated}} by Mobile <b>Softee</b> serve soft ice creams and popcicles. As in the United Kingdom, the vans play The Blue Danube to attract customers. As the Hong Kong government no longer issues new mobile hawker licenses, {{the company is}} restricted to just 14 vans in all of Hong Kong. There is usually one ice cream van parked outside the Star Ferry terminal on Hong Kong island, and on Haiphong Road in Tsim Sha Tsui. Some organised crime syndicates used them for laundering the proceeds of crime and as a front for drug dealing.|$|E
5000|$|During {{the late}} 1940s, future UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher worked briefly as a chemist for food {{manufacturer}} J.

Thatcher's precise role at Lyons is unclear, but she is reported to have worked on the company's ice cream products, as well as cakes and pies. A common anecdote, probably spread by her political opponents, is that by [...] "inventing" [...] soft serve ice cream, Thatcher [...] "added air, lowered quality and raised profits", used as a metaphor for her policies later as prime minister.|$|E
