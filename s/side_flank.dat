50|$|Built at {{the request}} of Philip II Augustus at the {{beginning}} of the 13th century in the place of a wooden fortress, it is characteristic of the military architecture of this period. The castle is built on a square pattern, with towers at three of the corners and an isolated donjon at the fourth. The walls are punctuated by towers in the middle of each side, and two, on the east <b>side,</b> <b>flank</b> the gate. A deep stone-lined dry moat follows the outline of the castle. The donjon, the major defensive component of the castle, measures approximately 30 metres in height and 13.6 metres in diameter. It is the typical of the donjons being built by Philip Augustus at this time (e.g. Rouen), and by French nobility through the 13th century.The conception of the geometric pattern and isolated donjon was similar to that of the castle of the Louvre. A near identical castle is found at Seringes-et-Nesles, Aisne.|$|E

5000|$|In 1920, Wakefield {{made his}} England debut against Wales. He captained the Cambridge University team in 1922. In total, he {{appeared}} for England 31 times and was captain on 13 occasions. He led England to back-to-back Grand Slams. His final appearance for England was against France in April 1927. Through his career, Wakefield's {{influence on the}} game was pronounced. As an excellent all-round athlete he helped revolutionise {{the role of the}} back row forward. Prior to Wakefield their role was mainly static—pushing in the set scrum and winning the ball in loose scrums (or rucks, as they later became). Wakefield's athleticism enabled him to play a more dynamic role: pressuring the opposition half backs in defence and supporting the attacks of the three quarters, and these remain the prime responsibilities of the modern open <b>side</b> <b>flank</b> forward. Rugby historian Barry Bowker described Wakefield thus; [...] "A complete footballer, he had all the attributes - strength, weight and speed - of a great forward. He was a master of the art of dribbling with pace, was up with his backs to share in an attack and took and gave passes well".|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} {{the applicability of}} air jet assisted (AJA) machining to stainless steel and titanium alloy at high cutting speeds in terms of tool wear and tool life. A specially designed tool holder with an air nozzle {{very close to the}} tool tip was prepared for turning stainless steel. From the experimental results, {{it was found that the}} application of flood coolant from the side of the end flank face leads to better result in tool life in AJA machining of stainless steel than that from the side of the <b>side</b> <b>flank</b> face. The assistance of air jet can improve the tool life of the M 35 CVD coated insert in machining of the stainless steel by 36 to 100 % under the optimal conditions in comparison with wet machining. It was also found that the air jet assistance extended the tool life of the S 10 PVD coated insert by 48 % in turning titanium alloy. The tool life extension of the coated insert in AJA machining titanium alloy is much longer than that of an uncoated carbide insert...|$|E
40|$|On 15 Feb. 1978, the {{orientation}} of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) remained steadily northward for more than 12 hours. The ISEE 1 and 2 spacecraft were located near apogee on the dawn <b>side</b> <b>flank</b> of the magnetotail. IMP 8 was almost symmetrically located in the magnetosheath on the dusk flank and IMP 7 was upstream in the solar wind. Using plasma and magnetic field data, we show the following: (1) the magnetosheath flow speed on the flanks of the magnetotail steadily exceeded the solar wind speed by 20 percent; (2) surface waves with approximately a 5 -min period and very non-sinusoidal waveform were persistently present on the dawn magnetopause and waves of similar period were present in the dusk magnetosheath; and (3) the magnetotail ceased to flare at an antisunward distance of 15 R(sub E). We propose that the acceleration of the magnetosheath flow is achieved by magnetic tension in the draped field configuration for northward IMF and that the reduction of tail flaring is consistent with a decreased amount of open magnetic flux and a larger standoff distance of the subsolar magnetopause. Results of a three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulation support this phenomenological model...|$|E

40|$|To {{investigate}} the stratigraphy and structural {{evolution of the}} Variscan Orogen of the External Nappe Zone, Sardinia, Italy, field work and geochronologic analyses were combined to assess both regional and orogen scale issues. Geologic mapping, structural analysis, and sampling in the Flumendosa area coupled with high-precision U-Pb zircon geochronology {{were used to determine}} the duration of Ordovician magmatic activity and the structural evolution of the Variscan Orogen. To constrain the duration of magmatism for the Flumendosa area, U-Pb ID/TIMS zircon analyses were performed on samples from a lower volcanic flow of the Ordovician Volcanic Unit and an upper, syn to post-magmatic porphyry. The analyses yielded ages of 457 and 452 Ma respectively. The start of magmatic activity at 457 Ma also marks the end of an unconformity found throughout the External Nappe Zone and provides evidence for correlation with the Sardic Unconformity of the Foreland Zone. Associations of the data with similar-aged Ordovician volcanic rocks and metagranitoids from the Mediterranean realm suggest either: (1) a Rheic wide magmatic event assuming the Posada-Asinara Line (PAL) represents the suture between Laurentia and Gondwana, or (2) the Southern Variscides collisional system of Europe occurred between Gondwana-derived terranes that composed the Hun Superterrane and Laurentia, correlating microterranes throughout the Mediterranean with the northern Gondwanan margin Within the study area, field evidence exists for four phases of deformation related to the Variscan Orogeny. The initial deformational phase (D 1) is evidenced by a south-directed thrust fault related to the amalgamation of the composite Variscan nappe stack, indicating a N-S directed contractional event. The second phase of deformation (D 2) is defined by the folding of the D 1 thrust by the Flumendosa antiform, indicating a NE-SW directed contractional event. The third phase (D 3) is expressed by top-to-the-east-southeast movement of the upper thrust sheet evidenced by penetrative deformation, shear, and a domino style series of N-S striking, high-angle faults within the lower sheet. This phase is interpreted to represent a transition from contraction to extension involving orogen-parallel transport. The evidence for the top-to-the-east D 3 allows for a reinterpretation {{of the nature of the}} contact between the Sarrabus Unit, the last nappe sheet emplaced, and the Gerrei Unit as a strike-slip fault on the <b>side</b> <b>flank</b> of the indenting nappe. The fourth deformational event (D 4) produced brittle fractures within the shale that cross-cut the penetrative deformation. Slickensides indicate a transport direction of 014 °, 13 °, consistent with extensional reactivation of the N-dipping D 1 thrust surface during late stages of orogenic evolution. A post-D 3 dike that contains the brittle fractures of D 4 yielded a U-Pb ID/TIMS age of 302 Ma that constrains the transition between D 3 and D 4. A post-D 4 granitoid of the Sardic Batholith yielded a U-Pb ID/TIMS age of 287 Ma that constrains the end of deformation for the Variscan Orogeny within the External Nappe Zone. These new age constraints are consistent with existing geochronologic data for the Variscan Orogen of Sardinia...|$|E
