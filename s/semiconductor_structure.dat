5000|$|The optical {{emission}} {{properties of}} eFluor Nanocrystals are primarily dictated by their size, {{as discussed in}} the next section. There {{are at least two}} aspects to consider when discussing the [...] "size" [...] of a quantum dot: the physical size of the <b>semiconductor</b> <b>structure,</b> {{and the size of the}} entire quantum dot moiety including the associated ligands and hydrophilic coating. The size of the <b>semiconductor</b> <b>structure</b> is tabulated below, and reflects the diameter of the spherical quantum dot without ligands. eFluor Nanocrystals are rendered water-dispersable with a patented poly-ethylene glycol (PEG) lipid layer that functions as both a protective hydrophilic coating around the quantum dot, as well as reducing non-specific binding [...] By dynamic light scattering measurements, the hydrodynamic radius of all eFluor Nanocrystals ranges from 10-13nm.|$|E

50|$|The SBEs are {{particularly}} useful when solving the light propagation through a <b>semiconductor</b> <b>structure.</b> In this case, {{one needs to}} solve the SBEs together with the Maxwell's equations driven by the optical polarization. This self-consistent set is called the Maxwell-SBEs and is frequently applied to analyze present-day experiments and to simulate device designs.|$|E
50|$|Stress in the <b>semiconductor</b> <b>structure</b> {{involving}} evaporated {{thin films}} usually {{results from the}} thermal expansion (thermal stress) during the manufacturing process. Thermal stress occurs because film depositions are usually made above room temperature. Upon cooling from the deposition temperature to room temperature, {{the difference in the}} thermal expansion coefficients of the substrate and the film cause thermal stress.|$|E
5000|$|Electrically {{erasable}} programmable {{read-only memory}} (EEPROM) {{is based on a}} similar <b>semiconductor</b> <b>structure</b> to EPROM, but allows its entire contents (or selected banks) to be electrically erased, then rewritten electrically, so that they need not be removed from the computer (whether general-purpose or an embedded computer in a camera, MP3 player, etc.). Writing or flashing an EEPROM is much slower (milliseconds per bit) than reading from a ROM or writing to a RAM (nanoseconds in both cases).|$|E
30|$|The linear and {{nonlinear}} {{optical properties}} of low-dimensional <b>semiconductor</b> <b>structures</b> are of considerable current interest {{in connection with}} their potential applications in optoelectronic and photonic devices [8, 9]. It is worth mentioning {{that there are many}} novel optical properties in the low-dimensional <b>semiconductor</b> <b>structures</b> which are not in their bulk materials [10 - 12]. The linear and nonlinear optical properties of nanostructures have been widely studied theoretically by several authors [13, 14].|$|R

50|$|In 1996, Imamoglu et al. {{proposed}} such a novel type of {{coherent light}} source and explained the concept {{based on an}} effect closely related to Bose-Einstein condensation of atoms: A large number of bosonic particles (here: polaritons) form a condensate in a macroscopically occupied quantum state via stimulated scattering. The condensate of polaritons finally provides coherent emission of light. Thus, it is a coherent light source that owns a different working mechanism compared to conventional laser devices. Owing to its principle, a polariton-laser promises a more energy-efficient laser operation. The typical <b>semiconductor</b> <b>structure</b> for such a laser consists of an optical microcavity placed between distributed Bragg reflectors.|$|E
5000|$|In detail, the {{above-mentioned}} {{equation of motion}} of the polarization is solved numerically by calculating the first two terms on the right hand side from the input parameters and by computing the collision contributions. Then, the equation of motion is numerically time-integrated and the microscopic polarizations are summed over [...] to obtain the complex macroscopic polarization which then provides the gain and the refractive index spectra in semiconductor laser theory. It should be mentioned that present-day modeling assumes a perfect <b>semiconductor</b> <b>structure</b> {{in order to reduce}} the numerical effort. Disorder effects like composition variations or thickness fluctuations of the material are not microscopically considered but such imperfections often occur in real structures. Such contributions to inhomogeneous broadening may be included into the theory by convolution with a Gaussian broadening function for quantitative comparison with experimental data.|$|E
