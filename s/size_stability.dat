50|$|Several {{consoles}} {{such as the}} Master System and the TurboGrafx-16 {{have used}} different types of smart cards as an external medium. These cards function similar to simple cartridges. Information is stored on a chip that is housed in plastic. Cards are more compact and simpler than cartridges, though. This makes them cheaper to produce and smaller, but limits {{what can be done}} with them. Cards cannot hold extra components, and common cartridge techniques like bank switching (a technique used to create very large games) were impossible to miniaturize into a card in the late 1980s. Compact Discs reduced much of the need for cards. Optical Discs can hold more information than cards, and are cheaper to produce. The Nintendo GameCube and the PlayStation 2 use memory cards for storage, but the PlayStation Vita, Nintendo 3DS, and Nintendo Switch are currently the only modern systems to use cards for game distribution. Nintendo has long used cartridges with their Game Boy line of hand held consoles because of their durability, small <b>size,</b> <b>stability</b> (not shaking and vibrating the handheld when it is in use), and low battery consumption. Nintendo switched to cards starting with the DS, because advances in memory technology made putting extra memory on the cartridge unnecessary.

40|$|Considering the {{processing}} of case hardening steel components, the machining {{as well as the}} heat treatment offer great capability for cost savings. By increasing the carburising temperature from today approximately 940 °C up to e. g. 1050 °C significant process time reductions are achievable due to the acceleration of diffusion and absorption processes. While increasing the carburising temperature, the appearance of prohibited coarse austenite grains has to be avoided. However the former austenite grain size is an attribute of the overall process chain from steel melting to case hardening. In this work, the influence of the manufacturing process on grain <b>size</b> <b>stability</b> of case hardening steels has been investigated. To simulate the hot forming process in laboratory scale compression tests (Rastegaev samples) have been performed to different standard steel grades (16 MnCr 5 / 20 NiCrMo 2) as well as two micro-alloyed (16 MnCr 5 Nb / 20 NiCrMo 2 Nb) steel grades. An increase in grain <b>size</b> <b>stability</b> during carburising simply depends on the size of precipitates. Unfortunately the use of a mean precipitate size is not significant, because the size distribution is modified by every single process step - even the case hardening itself. The results of this work show, that if deformation is carried out by warm deformation below a specific temperature T 1 - which {{is a function of the}} chemical composition - grain <b>size</b> <b>stability</b> is assessed by the condition of precipitates upon delivery. The low temperature prevents a change in precipitate morphology by low diffusion. Increasing the deformation temperature the grain <b>size</b> <b>stability</b> during following case hardening depends on the deformation degree. The higher the deformation degree, the bigger is the risk of illegal grain coarsening. With a further increase of the deformation temperature - above a specific temperature T 2 - no dependence of grain coarsening temperature and deformation degree is observed, assumed that the material contains an adequate content of micro-alloying elements Nb and Ti as well as Al and N...|$|E

Functionality of these nanoparticles depends on their properties which are often changing as a function of particle size and surrounding medium. Widely used characterization methods, dynamic light scattering (DLS), and transmission electron microscope (TEM) have both their weaknesses. We hypothesize that conventional light scattering (LS) methods can be used for a rigorous characterization of medium sensitive nanoparticles’ properties, like <b>size,</b> <b>stability,</b> and porosity. Two fundamentally different silicon-based nanoparticles were made: porous silicon (PSi) from crystalline silicon and silica nanoparticles (SN) through sol-gel process. We studied the properties of these mesoporous nanoparticles with two different multiangle LS techniques, DLS and static light scattering (SLS), and compared the results to dry-state techniques, TEM, and nitrogen sorption. Comparison of particle radius from TEM and DLS revealed significant overestimation of the DLS result. Regarding to silica nanoparticles, the overestimation was attributed to agglomeration by analyzing radius of gyration and hydrodynamic radius. In case of PSi nanoparticles, strong correlation between LS result and specific surface area was found. Our results suggest that the multiangle LS methods could be used for the <b>size,</b> <b>stability,</b> and structure characterization of mesoporous nanoparticles.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{determine}} the effect of different cryoprotectants and their concentration on the physicochemical characteristics of chitosan nanoparticles (CS-NPs). The effect of coating of CS-NPs with hyaluronic acid (HA) and alginic acid (ALG) before and after lyophilization was also evaluated. The ionic gelation method was used for the preparation of NPs and six different types of cryoprotectants (sucrose, glucose, trehalose, mannitol, polyethylene glycol- 2000, and polyethylene glycol- 10, 000) were investigated at 5 %, 10 %, 20 %, and 50 % concentration levels. Coating of CS-NPs with HA and their protection with high amount of cryoprotectants indicated better particle <b>size</b> <b>stability.</b> Samples that were lyophilized without cryoprotectants resulted in an increase in average size due to high agglomeration. All cryoprotectants with varying amount provided some sort of <b>size</b> <b>stability</b> for the NPs except for the PEG- 10, 000 which had no protective effect at higher concentrations. Sucrose and trehalose sugars were found to have the highest protective effect with HA coated and uncoated CS-NPs.
