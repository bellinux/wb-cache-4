50|$|<b>Swinging</b> <b>Link</b> with Taps (bottom left). A <b>swinging</b> <b>link</b> {{inserted}} into the Fixed Link With Taps also allows fine adjustment with fewer coil taps. The <b>swinging</b> <b>link</b> {{is a form of}} variable transformer, that moves the input coil {{in and out of the}} space between turns in the main coil to change their mutual inductance. The variable inductance makes these tuners more flexible than the basic circuit, but at some cost in complexity.|$|E

50|$|The M19A used inboard coilover shocks for {{the front}} and rear suspension, which were {{actuated}} through a <b>swinging</b> <b>link</b> that gave an increasing spring rate as the springs were compressed. This linkage was dropped in favor of a conventional system with the M19C. The M19A and M19C both used a mid-mounted Cosworth DFV V8 and Hewland 5-speed manual gearbox.|$|E
50|$|The M57 pistol is short-recoil-operated, locked-breech pistol {{that uses}} a Browning-type action with <b>swinging</b> <b>link.</b> The trigger is of single-action type. Originally the pistol has no manual safeties except for a half-cock notch on the hammer. Due to BATFE import restrictions, a manual safety was fitted to surplus models.

50|$|The {{parts were}} {{arranged}} {{so that when}} the yoke was centered, the connection of the main link to the bellcrank was in a line with the two pivots on the yoke.

40|$|The {{terminated}} {{research programme}} {{was based on}} the following aims: Mechanization of roof support setting; parallelism of roof support setting with cutting and loading procedure; improvement of roadway stability. The roadheader E 250 embodying a novel <b>swing</b> <b>link</b> mechanism was developed in the scope of the research programme. The successful trials of the machine and the <b>swing</b> <b>link</b> mechanism took place at the Walsum colliery in 1989 where the best monthly rate of advance came up to a total of 259 m within 20 working days, i. e. 12. 95 m/d as an average. The best rate of advance per day was approximately 18 m. This has confirmed that the <b>swing</b> <b>link</b> mechanism considerably improves the efficiency of roadheading machines when driving roadways, especially in case of prevailing problematic geological conditions. (orig.) Das abgeschlossene Forschungsvorhaben basierte auf den Zielsetzungen: Mechanisierung der Ausbauarbeiten; Parallelisierung von Ausbau- mit Loese- und Ladearbeiten; Verbesserung der Standsicherheit der Strecken. Im Rahmen des Forschungsvorhabens wurde die TSM E 250 mit einem neuartigen Schwingensystem entwickelt. Die erfolgreiche Erprobung dieser Maschine und des Schwingensystems erfolgte im Jahre 1989 auf der Schachtanlage Walsum. Dabei betrug die beste monatliche Auffahrleistung 259 m in 20 Arbeitstagen, d. h. i. M. 12, 95 m/d. Die beste Tagesauffahrung lag bei ca. 18 m. Es hat sich somit bestaetigt, dass das Schwingensystem die Wirtschaftlichkeit bei der Streckenauffahrung mit Teilschnittmaschinen erheblich verbessert, insbesondere wenn problematische geologische Bedingungen vorliegen.

50|$|Loubser also {{modified}} the leading bogie to have <b>swing</b> <b>links</b> with three-point suspension which eliminated the side control springs {{that were used}} on earlier versions. As a unit, the modified bogie was interchangeable with those of earlier versions and {{with those of the}} Classes 15E and 23. The leading bogie had a side-play of 8 in while the trailing Bissel truck had a side-play of 9+3/8 in.|$|R
50|$|The {{method of}} locking and {{unlocking}} the barrel differentiates the {{wide array of}} short recoil designs. Most common are the John Browning tilting barrel designs based on either the <b>swinging</b> <b>link</b> and locking lugs as used in the M1911 pistol or the linkless cam design used in the Hi Power and CZ 75. Other designs are the locking block design found in the Walther P38 and Beretta 92, rollers in the MG42, or a rotating barrel used in the Beretta 8000 and others. An unusual variant is the toggle bolt design of the Borchardt C-93 and its descendant, the Luger pistol.|$|E
50|$|The Ganz {{form was}} {{used on the}} Hungarian-built Les Belles Hongroisses 2BB2 400 {{locomotives}} for the French PO. This had four links forming the triangle, with the two upper vertices mounted to the locomotive frame (through a short <b>swinging</b> <b>link)</b> and to the jackshaft crankpin. The lower apex of the triangle contained a short triangular link, which linked {{the sides of the}} triangle to the wheel crankpin. By tilting this link, the suspension movement was absorbed. This linkage ran well at speed and as it was composed entirely of pivoting joints with no sliding, there was no lost motion. It was however complex, heavy and unbalanced.|$|E

30|$|Top-coal caving {{hydraulic}} support {{is a key}} equipment for LTCC operations. During the last 20  years, top-coal caving {{hydraulic support}} was gradually developed from high position top-coal caving support, middle position top-coal caving support, to low position top-coal caving support. Currently, the low position top-coal caving support is widely used, which is a chock-shield hydraulic support with positive four-link bar, reverse four-link bar and single <b>swing</b> <b>link</b> bar.|$|R

The mechanical drives of the semi-finished product horizontal displacement based on combined linkage mechanisms, wherea pusher carries out the sheet semi-finished product from the magazine, are metal consuming because of the considerable dimensions of the <b>swinging</b> <b>links...</b>|$|R
50|$|The outer bogies had two-pin <b>swing</b> <b>links</b> and {{laminated}} {{side control}} springs which provided {{for a total}} side-play of 7 in. The outer pairs of bogie wheels were arranged with tyre flange watering gear. The inner bissel trucks were of the radial-arm type with helical spring side control and a total side-play of 4 in. The bogies and bissels both had Timken roller bearing axle boxes. The front engine unit had two 21 in diameter vacuum brake cylinders, while the hind engine units were provided with steam and hand brakes.|$|R
5000|$|Other early steam {{locomotives}} such as Murray's Salamanca (1812) and George Stephenson's Blücher (1815) and Locomotion (1825) {{also used}} return connecting rod engines. These all had heavy vertical cylinders set in tandem within the boiler barrel, driving through transverse crossheads above the locomotive, supported by swinging links. The complexity of this motion led to it being named [...] 'the knitting' [...] by drivers. The <b>swinging</b> <b>link</b> was simpler than Watt's earlier parallel motion {{and did not}} constrain the crosshead to move in such an accurate straight line. However the additional length of the connecting rods for a return connecting rod engine, relative to the piston stroke, made this angulation effect less serious. The Steam Elephant used a rudimentary set of slidebars to support the crosshead instead.|$|E
50|$|Unlike {{the heavy}} masonry engine house {{used to support}} the beam and pivot of a {{conventional}} beam engine, the grasshopper beam was pivoted on a <b>swinging</b> <b>link.</b> The crankpin was carried directly by the beam and moved {{in a straight line}} vertically, the beam pivot moving slightly sideways on its link to allow this. This simplified the need for a parallel motion linkage on the piston rod. Grasshopper engines were thus lighter than conventional beam engines and could be built completely in factories, rather than requiring considerable erection work to be carried out on-site. This encouraged the use of grasshopper engines for smaller sized engines. Some makers, notably Easton & Amos of Southwark, specialised in such engines. Many were used for pumping, but not for powering large mills.|$|E
50|$|Where a steam barring {{engine was}} used, {{this was a}} small {{twin-cylinder}} engine (to avoid its own dead centre problems) with a reduction gear of high ratio, usually involving a worm gear. Final drive was by a pinion gear engaging temporarily with the teeth or barring holes cut into {{the rim of the}} main flywheel. The drive pinion was arranged on a <b>swinging</b> <b>link</b> so that it was thrown out-of-mesh automatically, once the main engine started to rotate at full speed. As the ratio was perhaps 1000:1 and the main engine ran at 60 rpm, this would otherwise have been a disastrous overspeed. Some engines instead used a final pinion on a helical spline, similar to that later used for the starters of internal combustion engines: once the main engine started, the pinion would be thrown out of engagement axially along this spline as the flywheel over-speeded the pinion relative to the shaft.|$|E
50|$|The {{side frame}} of the bogie was usually of bar construction, with simple horn guides attached, {{allowing}} the axle boxes vertical movements between them. The axle boxes had a cast-steel equaliser beam or bar resting on them. The bar had two steel coil springs placed on it and the bogie frame rested on the springs. The effect was to allow the bar {{to act as a}} compensating lever between the two axles and to use both springs to soften shocks from either axle. The bogie had a conventional bolster suspension with <b>swing</b> <b>links</b> carrying a spring plank.|$|R
50|$|The leading bogie was {{controlled}} by two side-check springs and had 4 in of side-play in each direction. This arrangement was later modified on some locomotives by substituting it with <b>swing</b> <b>links.</b> The portion of the driving crankpins for the connecting rod big-ends was turned 1+1/2 in eccentric {{to that of the}} coupling rods to obtain the longest possible piston stroke which the wheel diameter would permit, while keeping the throw of the coupling rod to a reasonable amount. Since the piston rod and crosshead was forged in one piece, the connecting rod small-end had to be forked.|$|R
50|$|A {{feature in}} the design of the leading bogie was that the bogie frame was a single steel casting to which the cast steel horns were bolted to take the axle boxes. An {{innovation}} was the arrangement of the laminated side control springs in combination with two point <b>swing</b> <b>links,</b> which would be part of all Hendrie's subsequent designs. To prevent trouble which had been experienced earlier owing to the fracture of the smokebox saddle and frame stretcher castings which contained steam chest passages, and also leakage at exhaust joints, the blast pipe breeches were made separate castings and not integral with the centre stretcher casting.|$|R

25|$|The bogies for the {{new cars}} were a new design, {{specifically}} prepared by Vicers Ruwolt. The suspension was based on coil springs, with a secondary cast bolster with spring plank, supported on <b>swing</b> <b>links</b> and coil springs. Each bogie weighed 7000kg, with a wheelbase of 2,445mm and a maximum axle load of 14 tonnes, and were designed for operation at up to 130km/h. Tread brakes were fitted, operated by Westinghouse model 250WF brake cylinders. The axle boxes utilised spherical roller bearings, and {{all parts of the}} bogie, except the wheels and axles themselves, were designed for conversion to standard gauge. This latter function was finally used in 2009 when the Mangalore to Albury line was converted to standard gauge.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — With {{the need}} for {{decreased}} power consumption as link speeds have increased {{in this paper we}} propose a method of power saving using bit error rate (BER) measurement of the link. As of now, only wireless links have used BER as a metric for power optimization because the error rate for wired links is 5 - 10 orders of magnitude lower thus requiring a very long time to complete a BER measurement. An improved accelerated BER technique is used to bring the measurement time down to a manageable level. The accelerated technique is compared to existing methods in terms of ease of applicability to current low power link technology such as a current-sense low-swing architecture. For short haul interconnects, low-swing links are becoming a viable replacement for LVDS or CML. The current mode operation of low-swing links is well suited for applying the power saving methodology. The presented low-swing architecture enables faster speeds and lower power consumption over its predecessor. Experimental results are shown for the power optimization methodology applied to the current-sense differential low <b>swing</b> <b>link.</b> I...|$|R
50|$|On {{the trailer}} cars, the trucks {{are similar to}} those of {{ordinary}} passenger cars, but have shorter frames. They lack axlebox guides (the longitudinal movements of the axles relative to the truck frame are limited solely by the suspension springs themselves), the springs are softer, the central pivot is made of 3 segments (which gives it a degree of flexibility), and the axlebox suspension friction shock absorbers are mounted inside the springs (on the power car trucks, they are mounted outside). The leading truck of the driving trailer has brackets for mounting the cab signal receiver coils. The early ER2 trailer cars had KVZ-5/E type trucks (identical to those on the ER1); later examples had the KVZ-TsNII/E type. The latter had the following design changes: the springs were softer; the bolster was attached to the frame by means of 2 <b>swing</b> <b>links</b> with rubber/metallic elements; the weight of the car body was borne by the bolster only via the skid pads (on the earlier type, part of the weight was also borne by the central pivot).|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{traditional}} radial steering bogie with <b>swing</b> hanger <b>links</b> {{is known}} as track-friendly but heavy, expensive in investment- and maintenance-costs. Whereas the actual rigid axle bogies like Y 25 cause severe wear on wheels and rails in curves and also need high traction forces in curves. Bogies with rubbers springs like DRRS, LEILA and Gigabox are a new feature with good behaviour in curves and on straight tracks. Good experiences over many years with DRRS and 35 t axle load on the German RWE coal line prove the benefits. For the new designs LEILA and Gigabox, which are in market introduction now, even higher benefits can be demonstrated. The principle design features and the benefits regarding lateral track forces, wear and traction resistance are evident...|$|R
500|$|Fi {{was created}} before the {{implantation}} of Wii MotionPlus, {{when she was}} going to be part of some different undefined gameplay concepts unrelated to motion control. Her design was based on the design of the Master Sword, referencing her origins as the sword's spirit. [...] She also served as an alternative explanatory voice as Link was a silent protagonist. According to staff, Fi's technical dialogue for each area of the game was written by different people, verbal inconsistencies arose that needed addressing, so Fujibayashi adjusted them all so she sounded consistent. Nearly all of Fi's dialogue was ultimately written by Fujibayashi. Ghirahim was designed to be similar to the Dark Link character from Ocarina of Time: he could read Link's movements, requiring players to think strategically to defeat him rather than simply <b>swinging</b> <b>Link's</b> sword around randomly. Character designs were far more detailed than in previous Zelda titles. Clothing was frequently designed to complement backgrounds, such as Zelda's pink and red dress in the opening. The game's use of warm colors and brushstroke-like aesthetics was inspired by impressionist artwork, pioneered in the 19th century by painters such as Claude Monet: a particular element cited by Miyamoto was the sky, which he called a tribute to the work of Paul Cézanne. The basic starting point for the art style was the fact of it being a fantasy world. The final version was referred to as a balance between the more overt cartoon styling of [...] and Twilight Princess, where the cartoon shading was transferred onto an older version of Link.

50|$|Each car {{is mounted}} on the {{bolsters}} of 2 double-sprung 2-axle trucks; the trucks of the power and trailer cars have significant differences. The power car trucks have axlebox guides which prevent any lateral or longitudinal movement of the axles relative to the truck frame. The truck frame's longitudinal beams are reinforced in the middle to take the car's weight via the bolster and suspension springs. The transverse beams have a complex shape to accommodate the traction motors (which are mounted entirely on the truck frame). The truck frame rests on the axleboxes via the axlebox suspension, which consists of 4 coil springs per axlebox (2 on each end of each axle). In turn, the truck frame bears {{the weight of the}} bolster via the double central suspension; the bolster bears the weight of the car directly. The truck frame is additionally reinforced at the attachment points for the suspension <b>swing</b> <b>links.</b> On early trains, the central suspension incorporated elliptical leaf springs, but from 1965 onward they were replaced with coil springs, which increased the maximum suspension travel from 95 to 120 mm (which reduced the risk of bottoming). Both stages of the suspension incorporate shock absorbers: the axlebox suspension has 2 friction shock absorbers per axle, and the central suspension has 5 hydraulic shock absorbers (on trucks with coil springs only). The car body rests on skid pads on the cast side flanges of the bolster; these skid pads are made of layered plastic, and serve to reduce the rolling and yawing movements of the trucks and car bodies. The car body is also connected {{to the center of the}} bolster by means of the central pivot—a vertical steel rod mounted in the center of the bolster, which transmits the traction and braking forces from the truck to the car body, and also receives part of the car body's weight.|$|R
