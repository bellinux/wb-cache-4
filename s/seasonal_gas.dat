Resolving the problem will impose costs measuring in the billions of dollars. Based on evidence {{that the rate of}} vet sulfate deposition in eastern North America is higher in the summer half of the year than in the vinter half of the year, seasonal control of emissions is proposed as a means of minimizing acid deposition control costs. This paper evaluates the proposal that natural gas be substituted for coal and oil in electric pover plants during April through September. A model is presented that simulates the substitution of natural gs for coal and oil in pover plants in the eastern 31 state region so as to minimize total costs with respect to deposition reductions at an Adirondack receptor. The results of the model show: 1) changes in fuel coansumption as a result of substitution, 2) the increased effectiveness of seasonal versus year-round controls. and 3) the costs of achieving various levels of deposition reductioan at an Adirondack receptor. The costs of <b>seasonal</b> <b>gas</b> substitution. in terms of emission and deposition reductions, are compared to cost estimates for other proposed control methods and strategies. An example is given that calculates the cost with respect to deposition of a source-oriented control strategy, so that the cost of <b>seasonal</b> <b>gas</b> substitution can be fairly compared with it. The conclusion of these cost comparisons is that <b>seasonal</b> <b>gas</b> substitution is cost-competitive vith some other control methods. at least in some states. Thesis (M. S.)

40|$|For several years, {{residents}} of Cache County, Utah {{have suffered from}} the recurrence of {{what has come to}} be known as the winter-inversion, or “red-air-day” season. Each year during this season – which occurs primarily in the months of December, January, and February – particulate matter concentrations measuring two and half micrometers or less (commonly known as PM 2. 5) rise and languish (for periods of days or even weeks) above federally mandated standards, causing extensive harm to community health and confounding what have thus far been the relatively tepid control efforts undertaken by local and state policymakers. Through time-series regression modeling, we establish a statistical relationship between PM 2. 5 concentrations and vehicle use in Cache County, and further calculate a gas-price elasticity for the region. Next, we analyze the benefits and costs associated with a potential <b>seasonal</b> <b>gas</b> tax which, if set appropriately and enforced effectively, could decrease vehicle use and thereby lower health costs through concomitant decreases in PM 2. 5 concentrations. Specifically, we find a relatively strong positive relationship between percentage of vehicle trips reduced and associated reductions in PM 2. 5 concentrations, and a gas price elasticity of approximately - 0. 31 in what we call a “high price variability environment. ” Based upon these results, benefit-cost analysis suggests a potentially positive social net benefit for Cache County associated with imposing a <b>seasonal</b> <b>gas</b> tax to reduce PM 2. 5 concentrations during the winter-inversion season.

50|$|The <b>seasonal</b> soil <b>gas</b> fluxes {{show the}} {{emissions}} {{from the land}} under different crops, climate patterns and management practices. This is the main way that sequestered carbon returns to the atmosphere. Clifton et. al. studied Miscanthus for 16 years in southern Ireland. They examined soil cores for the ratio of 13C/12C in the top 30 cm of soil They determined that the sequestration over 15 years was 8.9+/-2.4 t C per hectare per year. To properly evaluate the C sequestration potential for any agricultural management system, the seasonal C fluxes should be considered. The low fertilizer, pesticide, and water requirements of Miscanthus means that the emissions associated with such typical agricultural processes are avoided. Miscanthus is a perennial grass, which allows it to avoid tillage that destroys soil structures and emits soil carbon. Other environmental issues that are caused by fertilizer run-off are also avoided. If the land under typical agricultural management is converted to a low-input alternative like Miscanthus, the change in land management would create a negative C land use change.

Analysis of results based on the NHGHGIFA, yielded two individual emission factors comprising both summer and winter months. These factors, namely the winter greenhouse gas intensity factor (WGHGIF) and summer greenhouse gas intensity factor (SGHGIF), {{were found to be}} 274 g CO 2 /kWh and 191 g CO 2 /kWh respectively and represent CO 2 reduction potential by the PV system within Ontario’s energy mix.

A secondary analysis using the GHGIFM was performed to determine the hourly CO 2 reductions possible through direct fossil to PV substitution.

The traditionally largest source of seasonal flexibility in Europe is indigenous gas production, mainly based in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. With the depletion of indigenous sources the market increasingly needs to rely on other sources for seasonal flexibility, such as gas storage facilities. We investigate the future need for gas storage as a source for seasonal flexibility provision using a dynamic gas market model (GASTALE) in which different potential sources for seasonal flexibility - gas production, imports via pipeline, LNG imports and storage facilities - compete with each other in a market-based environment. The inclusion of seasonal flexibility properties in a gas market model allows a more complex analysis of seasonal flexibility issues than previously documented in literature. This is demonstrated in an analysis of the future demand for gas storage in northwestern Europe until 2030.

For all species, optimum temperatures for gross photosynthesis showed little temporal variation. In addition, the shape of the temperature-response curves at suboptimal temperature was not optimized to temporal differences in water temperature. The only consistent <b>seasonal</b> trend in <b>gas</b> exchange was a gradual decrease in photosynthetic and respiratory capacity over time.

40|$|One of {{the issues}} {{concerning}} the replacement of natural gas by green gas is the seasonal pattern of the gas demand. When constant production is assumed, this may limit the injected quantity of green gas into a gas grid {{to the level of}} the minimum gas demand in summer. A procedure was proposed to increase the gas demand coverage in a geographical region, i. e. the extent to which natural gas demand can be replaced by green gas. This was done by modeling flexibility into farm-scale green gas supply chains. The procedure comprises two steps. In the first step, the types and number of green gas production units are determined, based on a desired gas demand coverage. The production types comprise time-varying biogas production, non-continuous biogas production (only in winter periods with each digester having a specified production time) and constant production including <b>seasonal</b> <b>gas</b> storage. In the second step locations of production units and injection stations are calculated, using mixed integer linear programming with cost price minimization being the objective. Five scenarios were defined with increasing gas demand coverage, representing a possible future development in natural gas replacement.

In New York, the ratios were 55 % and 35 % for GDSHPA and GDSHPB respectively...|$|E
40|$|A biologically-based {{secondary}} {{ambient air}} quality standard for vegetation in the U. S. is presently lacking. Analyses sensitive to the physiological conductivity of exposed plants as well as atmospheric and soil conditions were used here to predict the signature response of plants to ozone, foliar injury. Bel-W 3 tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L. cv. Bel-W 3) was used as an acute-response model while Asclepias syriaca L. was used as a chronic-response model to identify important controlling factors involved in foliar injury response to ambient ozone. Temperature, RH, PAR, wind velocity, soil moisture, soil matric potential, and vapor pressure deficit were investigated relative to their influence on injury development during simultaneous exposure to ozone. Several important factors were found to lead to overestimation of vegetation exposure to ambient ozone. These included use of a standard ozone measurement height, soil moisture deficits, asynchrony between diurnal stomatal conductance and peak ozone concentration, episodic exposures to elevated ozone concentrations during late-day weak sunlight (PAR 3 ̆c 500), and <b>seasonal</b> decline of <b>gas</b> exchange and ozone uptake in herbaceous plants. These results indicate the need for refinement of current indices to protect vegetation, which, if based solely on ozone concentration, e. g. AOT 40, SUM 06, W 126, will continue to lead to overestimation of ozone exposure. ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} seasonal variation of PAHs and their partition between gas and particulate-bounded phases in {{indoor and outdoor}} air in 4 schools in Serbia located at different locations. The sampling campaigns were conducted during one workweek at each school successively. Campaigns were conducted in schools during heating and non-heating seasons in December 2011 and June 2012. <b>Seasonal</b> variations of <b>gas</b> and particle-bounded PAHs concentrations were observed with higher levels during heating season. The highest total PAH values {{were associated with the}} gas phase in both sampling periods. The total PAHs concentration at indoor and at the outdoor sites, during heating season, ranged from 88. 45 to 447. 72 ng/m 3 and 201. 69 to 1017. 15 ng/m 3, respectively. During non-heating season, the total PAHs concentration ranged from 36. 91 to 271. 57 ng/m 3 in indoor environment and 27. 00 to 132. 32 ng/m 3 in outdoor environment. Most of the I/O ratios were less than 1, which indicated that the indoor PAHs were mostly from outdoor sources. The use of diagnostic ratio showed that traffic emission and coal combustion are the major sources of PAHs. Only the diagnostic ratios for the school, located near the industrial area, showed significant deviation compared to other schools. [Projekat Ministarstva nauke Republike Srbije, br.

40|$|The Uinta Basin {{of northeastern}} Utah {{has long been}} a {{prolific}} oil and gas producer. Commercial, locally consumed natural gas production began in the basin in 1925 at Ashley Valley field near Vernal. Utah’s first commercial oil production was established from deeper formations in the same field in 1948. Major oil company exploration efforts in the Uinta Basin commenced shortly after World War II and ultimately succeeded in discovering nearly all of the basin’s significant oil and gas fields by the early 1960 s. Prior to the construction of a transportation system for natural gas in the late 1950 s and early 1960 s, oil was the commodity of primary interest. Even after the pipelines were built, natural gas received little attention because of the weak market and <b>seasonal</b> demand for <b>gas</b> in the Rockies. Many exploratory wells encountered gas on the rugged south flank of the Uinta Basin during the major company exploration effort. Bar X, Westwater, Fence Canyon, Bryson Canyon, and San Arroyo fields were developed in this area early in the process because gas transportation was available on the Northwest Pipeline system a few miles to the east in Colorado. These fields, and many smaller fields in the area, produced gas from generally long-lived wells in the Cretaceous Dakota Sandstone and Cedar Mountain Formation and the Jurassic Morrison and Entrada formations, although the Entrada tended to produce low Btu gas due to contamination by carbon dioxide...|$|R
