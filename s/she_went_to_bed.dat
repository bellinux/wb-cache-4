2500|$|Thérèse's {{final years}} {{were marked by}} a steady decline that she bore resolutely and without complaint. Tuberculosis was the key element of Thérèse's final suffering, but she saw {{that as part of}} her spiritual journey. After observing a {{rigorous}} Lenten fast in 1896, <b>she</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> on the eve of Good Friday and felt a joyous sensation. She wrote: [...] "Oh! how sweet this memory really is! ... I had scarcely laid my head upon the pillow when I felt something like a bubbling stream mounting to my lips. I didn't know what it was." [...] The next morning her handkerchief was soaked in blood and she understood her fate. Coughing up of blood meant tuberculosis, and tuberculosis meant death. She wrote, [...] "I thought immediately of the joyful thing that I had to learn, so I went over to the window. I was able to see that I was not mistaken. Ah! my soul was filled with a great consolation; I was interiorly persuaded that Jesus, on the anniversary of His own death, wanted to have me hear His first call!" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "And hungry too, no doubt: let {{her have}} some supper before <b>she</b> <b>goes</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed,</b> Miss Miller. Is {{this the first time}} you have left your parents to come to school, my little girl?" ...|$|R

60|$|Upon {{the whole}} it seemed wiser {{not to act}} on a mere fancy. <b>She</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> again.|$|E
6000|$|... “Miss Bleek is {{not likely}} to be in a frame of mind to see ghosts,” said Hugo Norbury, “if <b>she</b> <b>goes</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> with her brain awhirl with royal spades and no trumps and grand slams.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm afraid I've kept {{everything}} waiting," [...] said Mary Gray apologetically, [...] "and now we {{must really}} say good-bye. Innocent is taking me to his aunt's over at Hampstead, and I'm afraid <b>she</b> <b>goes</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> early." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'No. I can't,' {{replied the}} girl; 'Missis Raddle raked {{out the kitchen}} fire afore <b>she</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed,</b> and locked up the kittle.' ...|$|E
60|$|But May Maylands did not stick {{her feet}} in hot water; neither did <b>she</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed,</b> or take any physic. Indeed there was no {{occasion}} to do so, for a clear complexion and pink cheeks told of robust health.|$|R
