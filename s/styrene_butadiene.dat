25|$|The {{most common}} {{application}} of 2-vinylpyridine is {{for use in}} the production of a latex terpolymer of 2-vinylpyridine, <b>styrene,</b> and <b>butadiene,</b> for use as a tire-cord binder. The tire cord is treated first with a resorcinol-formaldehyde polymer and then with a terpolymer made from 15% 2-vinylpyridine, <b>styrene,</b> and <b>butadiene.</b> This treatment gives the close bonding of tire cord to rubber essential in the production of tires.|$|R

50|$|As nucleophiles, organolithium {{reagents}} undergo carbolithiation reactions, {{whereby the}} carbon-lithium bond adds across a carbon-carbon {{double or triple}} bond, forming new organolithium species. This reaction is the most widely employed reaction of organolithium compounds. Carbolithiation is key in anionic polymerization processes, and n-butyllithium {{is used as a}} catalyst to initiate the polymerization of <b>styrene,</b> <b>butadiene,</b> or isoprene or mixtures thereof.|$|E

50|$|Chemicals in {{the bulk}} {{petrochemicals}} and intermediates are primarily made from {{liquefied petroleum gas}} (LPG), natural gas, and crude oil. Their sales volume is close to 30 percent of overall basic chemicals. Typical large-volume products include ethylene, propylene, benzene, toluene, xylenes, methanol, vinyl chloride monomer (VCM), <b>styrene,</b> <b>butadiene,</b> and ethylene oxide. These basic or commodity chemicals are the starting materials used to manufacture many polymers and other more complex organic chemicals particularly those that are made {{for use in the}} specialty chemicals category (see below).|$|E
5000|$|As a {{reactive}} monomer, {{ethyl acrylate}} {{is used in}} homopolymers and copolymers with e.g. ethene, acrylic acid and its salts, amides and esters, methacrylates, acrylonitrile, maleic esters, vinyl acetate, vinyl chloride, vinylidene chloride, <b>styrene,</b> <b>butadiene</b> and unsaturated polyesters. Copolymers of acrylic acid ethyl ester with ethene (EPA/ethylene-ethyl acrylate copolymers) are suitable as adhesives and polymer additives, just like ethene vinyl acetate copolymers. [...] Copolymers with acrylic acid increase the cleaning effect of liquid detergents, copolymers with methacrylic acid are used as gastric juices tablet covers (Eudragit®).|$|E
50|$|Materials science {{research}} efforts are underway to improve such properties of elastomers. For instance, this involves modifying the microstructure of the copolymer (for instance, using solution <b>styrene</b> <b>butadiene</b> rubber (S-SBR) {{to control the}} addition of vinyl butadiene units) {{as well as the}} macrostructure of the polymer (such as the width of molecular weight distribution (MWD)). Current investigation also involves looking at the functionalization of the elastomer through the addition of filler materials such as silica and carbon black, as well as testing other nano-fillers such as nanocellulose crystals, carbon nanotubes, and graphene.|$|E
25|$|Most {{butadiene}} is polymerized {{to produce}} synthetic rubber. While polybutadiene {{itself is a}} very soft, almost liquid material, copolymers prepared from mixtures of <b>butadiene</b> with <b>styrene</b> and/or acrylonitrile, such as acrylonitrile <b>butadiene</b> <b>styrene</b> (ABS), acrylonitrile <b>butadiene</b> (NBR) and styrene-butadiene (SBR) are tough and/or elastic. SBR is the material most commonly used {{for the production of}} automobile tires.|$|R

25|$|Several other {{copolymers}} {{are also}} used with <b>styrene.</b> Acrylonitrile <b>butadiene</b> <b>styrene</b> or ABS plastic is similar to HIPS: a copolymer of acrylonitrile and styrene, toughened with polybutadiene. Most electronics cases are made of this form of polystyrene, as are many sewer pipes. SAN is a copolymer of styrene with acrylonitrile, and SMA one with maleic anhydride. Styrene can be copolymerized with other monomers; for example, divinylbenzene {{can be used for}} cross-linking the polystyrene chains to give the polymer used in Solid phase peptide synthesis.|$|R
50|$|Polybutadiene rubber {{is seldom}} used alone, but is instead mixed with other rubbers. Polybutadiene is {{difficult}} to band in a two roll mixing mill. Instead, a thin sheet of polybutadiene may be prepared and kept separate. Then, after proper mastication of natural rubber, the polybutadiene rubber may {{be added to the}} two roll mixing mill. A similar practice may be adopted, for example, if polybutadiene is to be mixed with <b>Styrene</b> <b>Butadiene</b> Rubber (SBR). *Polybutadiene rubber may be added with Styrene as an impact modifier. High dosages may affect clarity of Styrene.|$|E
50|$|Seeking {{alternative}} sources of natural rubber, the U.S. Government purchased the Intercontinental Rubber Company's holdings in California, and also began the commercial scale up of polybutadiene and <b>styrene</b> <b>butadiene</b> rubber. Over 32,000 acres of guayule were commercially farmed in California and Arizona. While the yields from those stands of plants were not sufficient to be commercially viable, the demands of war supported the concept of rubber production at any cost and demonstrated guayule's excellent performance characteristics in a broad variety of applications.The U.S. Government abandoned guayule production efforts following the war.|$|E
50|$|The first {{synthetic}} {{grass was}} placed over concrete in 1964 and {{became known as}} “Chem Grass”. It was later named “Astro Turf” when it was installed in the Houston Astrodome in 1966. Athletes did not like playing on these fields because it was dangerous and not comfortable for their landings. Compared to only {{a thin layer of}} Astro Turf on top of concrete, a new artificial turf was developed in the early 2000s and was called <b>styrene</b> <b>butadiene</b> rubber, most commonly known as “crumb rubber.” This rubber was made of small black crumb pieces that came from old tires. The tire crumbs were poured in between the fake grass blades, giving the artificial fields more cushion and support. This was a better solution and satisfied athletes and aided in the prevention of major injuries.|$|E

50|$|Binders {{promote the}} binding of pigment {{particles}} {{between themselves and}} the coating layer of the paper. Binders are spherical particles less than 1 µm in diameter. Common binders are styrene maleic anhydride copolymer or styrene-acrylate copolymer. The surface chemical composition is differentiated by the adsorption of acrylic acid or an anionic surfactant, {{both of which are}} used for stabilization of the dispersion in water. Co-binders, or thickeners, are generally water-soluble polymers that influence the paper's color viscosity, water retention, sizing, and gloss. Some common examples are carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), cationic and anionic hydroxyethyl cellulose (EHEC), modified starch, and dextrin.Styrene butadiene latex, Styrene acrylic, dextrin, oxidized starch are used in coatings to bind the filler to the paper. Co-binders are natural products such as starch and CMC (Carboxymethyl cellulose), that are used along with the synthetic binders, like styrene acrylic or <b>styrene</b> <b>butadiene.</b> Co-binders are used to reduce the cost of the synthetic binder and improve the water retention and rheology of the coating.|$|E
