5|$|Milled sugars (known as confectioner's {{sugar and}} {{powdered}} sugar) are {{ground to a}} fine powder. They are used as powdered sugar (also known as icing <b>sugar</b> <b>or</b> confectionary sugar), for dusting foods and in baking and confectionery.|$|E
5|$|Refined {{sugar is}} made from raw sugar that has {{undergone}} a refining process to remove the molasses. Raw sugar is sucrose which is extracted from sugarcane or sugar beet. While raw sugar can be consumed, the refining process removes unwanted tastes and results in refined <b>sugar</b> <b>or</b> white sugar.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the 17th century Plymouth had {{gradually}} {{lost its}} pre-eminence as a trading port. By the mid-17th century, commodities manufactured elsewhere in England {{cost too much}} to transport to Plymouth, and the city had no means of processing <b>sugar</b> <b>or</b> tobacco imports, major products from the colonies. It {{played a part in}} the Atlantic slave trade during the early 18th century, although it was relatively small.|$|E

5|$|A type of refined cooking {{developed}} in the late Middle Ages that set the standard among the nobility all over Europe. Common seasonings in the highly spiced sweet-sour repertory typical of upper-class medieval food included verjuice, wine and vinegar in combination with spices such as black pepper, saffron and ginger. These, along with {{the widespread use of}} <b>sugar</b> <b>or</b> honey, gave many dishes a sweet-sour flavour. Almonds were very popular as a thickener in soups, stews, and sauces, particularly as almond milk.|$|E
5|$|Applesauce cake is {{a dessert}} cake {{prepared}} using apple sauce, flour and sugar as main ingredients. Store-bought or homemade applesauce {{may be used}} in its preparation. Additional ingredients include eggs, butter, margarine or oil, raisins and plumped raisins, dates, chopped apple, chopped nuts (such as walnuts and pecans), cocoa powder, and spices such as cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg and allspice. Some versions include dried or fresh, finely grated ginger. After baking, applesauce cake is sometimes topped with an icing, frosting or glaze, such as a caramel glaze. It also may be served topped with a dusting of confectioner's <b>sugar</b> <b>or</b> whipped cream. Gluten-free applesauce cake can be prepared using rice flour.|$|E
5|$|It may be {{prepared}} with toppings such as sugar, chocolate or maple glazes, dusted with granulated <b>sugar</b> <b>or</b> cinnamon-sugar, or served plain without any topping. The {{shape of the}} doughnut can lend to the retention of a greater amount of glaze or other toppings compared to other doughnut styles. The old-fashioned doughnut may have a similar texture {{to that of a}} buttermilk doughnut, may be crisp in texture, and typically has cracks and pores on its surface.|$|E
50|$|Defined in {{the narrowest}} sense, glycobiology {{is the study}} of the structure, biosynthesis, and biology of saccharides (<b>sugar</b> chains <b>or</b> glycans) that are widely {{distributed}} in nature. <b>Sugars</b> <b>or</b> saccharides are essential components of all living things and aspects of the various roles they play in biology are researched in various medical, biochemical and biotechnological fields.|$|R

5|$|In French medieval cuisine, banquets {{were common}} among the aristocracy. Multiple courses would be prepared, but {{served in a}} style called service en confusion, or all at once. Food was {{generally}} eaten by hand, meats being sliced off in large pieces held between the thumb and two fingers. The sauces were highly seasoned and thick, and heavily flavored mustards were used. Pies were a common banquet item, with the crust serving primarily as a container, rather than as food itself, {{and it was not}} until the very end of the Late Middle Ages that the shortcrust pie was developed. Meals often ended with an issue de table, which later changed into the modern dessert, and typically consisted of dragées (in the Middle Ages, meaning spiced lumps of hardened <b>sugar</b> <b>or</b> honey), aged cheese and spiced wine, such as hypocras.|$|E
5|$|Indigenous peoples {{living in}} northeastern North America {{were the first}} groups known to have {{produced}} maple syrup and maple sugar. According to aboriginal oral traditions, as well as archaeological evidence, maple tree sap was being processed into syrup long before Europeans arrived in the region. There are no authenticated accounts of how maple syrup production and consumption began, but various legends exist; {{one of the most}} popular involves maple sap being used in place of water to cook venison served to a chief. Other stories credit the development of maple syrup production to Nanabozho, Glooskap, or the squirrel. Aboriginal tribes developed rituals around sugar-making, celebrating the Sugar Moon (the first full moon of spring) with a Maple Dance. Many aboriginal dishes replaced the salt traditional in European cuisine with maple <b>sugar</b> <b>or</b> syrup.|$|E
5|$|The thicker {{end of the}} log, the {{end that}} was nearest to the tree's roots, may have a special significance. In Montenegro {{it is called the}} head of the badnjak; the main log is laid on the fire with its head {{pointing}} east. In central Serbia the badnjak is laid with its thicker end sticking out from the ognjište. The household's shepherds would kiss over it to ensure an abundance of lambs in the coming year. In Gruža it is coated with honey which is then licked by children. At the side of ognjište where the thicker end is situated, the family may place a plowshare, a round loaf of bread, a glove filled with wheat, <b>sugar,</b> <b>or</b> a sieve containing grain, honey, cakes, wine, salt, prunes, walnuts, and apples. The cut surface of the thicker end is in Čečava kissed by all the family members after the badnjak is laid on the fire.|$|E

50|$|Insects {{most often}} use <b>sugars</b> <b>or</b> polyols as {{cryoprotectant}}s. One species that uses cryoprotectant is Polistes exclamans (a wasp). In this species, the {{different levels of}} cryoprotectant {{can be used to}} distinguish between morphologies.|$|R
5|$|In {{vascular}} plants, the xylem and phloem are the conductive tissues that transport resources between shoots and roots. Roots {{are often}} adapted to store food such as <b>sugars</b> <b>or</b> starch, as in sugar beets and carrots.|$|R
5|$|Food {{preservation}} methods were {{basically the same}} as had been used since antiquity, and did not change much until the invention of canning in the early 19th century. The most common and simplest method was to expose foodstuffs to heat or wind to remove moisture, thereby prolonging the durability if not the flavor of almost any type of food from cereals to meats; the drying of food worked by drastically reducing the activity of various water-dependent microorganisms that cause decay. In warm climates this was mostly achieved by leaving food out in the sun, and in the cooler northern climates by exposure to strong winds (especially common for the preparation of stockfish), or in warm ovens, cellars, attics, and at times even in living quarters. Subjecting food {{to a number of}} chemical processes such as smoking, salting, brining, conserving or fermenting also made it keep longer. Most of these methods had the advantage of shorter preparation times and of introducing new flavors. Smoking or salting meat of livestock butchered in autumn was a common household strategy to avoid having to feed more animals than necessary during the lean winter months. Butter tended to be heavily salted (5–10%) in order not to spoil. Vegetables, eggs or fish were also often pickled in tightly packed jars, containing brine and acidic liquids (lemon juice, verjuice or vinegar). Another method was to seal the food by cooking it in <b>sugar</b> <b>or</b> honey or fat, in which it was then stored. Microbial modification was also encouraged, however, by a number of methods; grains, fruit and grapes were turned into alcoholic drinks thus killing any pathogens, and milk was fermented and curdled into a multitude of cheeses or buttermilk.|$|E

40|$|Current biofuel {{technologies}} utilize valuable foodstuffs, such as {{corn kernels}} and cane sugar, {{as sources of}} easily metabolized sugars. Microbes are used to ferment these sugars into bioethanol, a first-generation biofuel. However, {{in order to avoid}} diverting foodstuffs from the food supply, the development of second-generation biofuels technology is necessary. Second-generation biofuels are produced by converting structurally complex lignocellulosic biomass, such as agricultural and municipal wastes, to fermentable <b>sugars</b> <b>or</b> directly to biofuels. The major technological hurdle limiting the mass production of second-generation biofuels is the difficulty in efficiently converting structurally complex lignocellulosic materials to fermentable <b>sugars</b> <b>or</b> directly to biofuels. The discovery of novel thermophilic microorganisms and enzymes that have high activities or broad substrate ranges on plant polymers addresses this challenge...|$|R
