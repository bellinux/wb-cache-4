5|$|Acquisition {{of second}} and {{additional}} languages can come at any age, through exposure {{in daily life}} or courses. Children learning a <b>second</b> <b>language</b> {{are more likely to}} achieve native-like fluency than adults, but in general, it is very rare for someone speaking a <b>second</b> <b>language</b> to pass completely for a native speaker. An important difference between first language acquisition and additional language acquisition is that the process of additional language acquisition is influenced by languages that the learner already knows.|$|E
