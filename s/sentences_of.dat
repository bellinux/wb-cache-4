The festival attracted Israel's best musicians and bands until 18 July 1995, when three teenagers were crushed to death by a falling gate during a farewell concert by the popular band Mashina. Since then the festival has become a minor event. Five of the festival's organizers received prison <b>sentences</b> <b>of</b> up to one year.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of the trial, FRAP members VIadimiro Fernández, Manuel Blanco and José Humberto Baena {{received}} the death penalty for the killing of Lucio Rodríguez, an armed policeman, in Madrid on 14 July 1975. Humberto had been an activist in the then-illegal Communist Party of Spain and had been arrested and jailed following a student demonstration in 1970. His parents claimed that he had been in Portugal {{at the time of the}} killing and that one of the main witnesses was not allowed to attend the trial. Though the prosecution had sought the death penalty for all five accused, Pablo Mayoral Ronda and Fernando Siera Marco received <b>sentences</b> <b>of</b> 30 and 25 years respectively. Lawyers of the three sentenced to death appealed the sentences.|$|E
5|$|Cox faced 42 {{counts of}} fraud, in {{addition}} to felony charges for fleeing while on probation from a previous conviction. Facing potential prison <b>sentences</b> <b>of</b> over 400 years, he negotiated a plea bargain agreement that gave him a maximum of 54 years, and a $2 million fine. On November 17, 2007, federal judge Timothy C. Batten, Sr. sentenced Cox to 26 years in prison. He also ordered Cox to pay $5.97 million in restitution. He will not be eligible for release until 2029.|$|E
5|$|In that article, he {{attempted}} to show how mental representations, specifically sentences {{in the language of}} thought, are necessary to explain this relational nature of mental states. Fodor considers two alternative hypotheses. The first completely denies the relational character of mental states and the second considers mental states as two-place relations. The latter position can be further subdivided into the Carnapian view that such relations are between individuals and <b>sentences</b> <b>of</b> natural languages and the Fregean view that they are between individuals and the propositions expressed by such sentences.|$|E

5|$|Marshall was {{a strong}} {{opponent}} of Indiana's recently passed eugenics and sterilization laws, and ordered state institutions not to follow them. He was an early, high-profile opponent of eugenics laws, and he carried his opposition into the vice-presidency. His governorship {{was the first in}} which no state executions took place, due to his opposition to capital punishment and his practice of pardoning and commuting the <b>sentences</b> <b>of</b> people condemned to execution. He regularly attacked corporations and used recently created anti-trust laws to attempt to break several large businesses. He participated in a number of ceremonial events, including personally laying the final golden brick to complete the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in 1909.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{support for}} Louis' {{campaign}} was diminishing in France, and {{he concluded that}} the war in England was lost. He negotiated terms with Cardinal Guala, under which Louis would renounce his claim to the English throne; in return, his followers would be given back their lands, any <b>sentences</b> <b>of</b> excommunication would be lifted, and Henry's government would promise to enforce the charter of the previous year. The proposed agreement soon began to unravel amid claims from some loyalists that it was too generous towards the rebels, particularly the clergy who had joined the rebellion.|$|E
5|$|On 14 June {{the court}} acquitted nine medics and {{downgraded}} sentences against nine others. Ali Al-Ekri {{was sentenced to}} five years imprisonment, another doctor to three years and seven were given from one month to one year. Two other doctors did not appeal their <b>sentences</b> <b>of</b> 15 years' imprisonment, instead fleeing the country. On 1 October, the Court of Cassation, the country's highest court, closed the first case involving twenty medics by upholding jail sentences on the remaining nine. Although the verdict is final, activist Mohamed al-Maskati said that they could still be pardoned by the king.|$|E

5|$|Pitt's {{administration}} {{took the}} guilty verdict in Paine's trial {{as a sign}} that further prosecutions for sedition were possible, and began many. In the 17 months following the trial, 11 publishers of the Rights of Man were prosecuted, receiving prison <b>sentences</b> <b>of</b> up to 4 years. These acted as a prelude to the 1794 Treason Trials, in which a dozen reformers were indicted for allegedly conspiring to bring about a revolution. Erskine played a prominent role in defending many of them, including Thomas Hardy, John Horne Tooke and John Thelwall, all three of whom were acquitted.|$|E

In times of public emergency, the Governor may exercise emergency powers, including the mobilization of these military forces. In the area of criminal justice, the Governor may grant pardons to criminals, commute the <b>sentences</b> <b>of</b> prisoners, or remit fines and forfeitures imposed on people who have been convicted, jailed, or fined for violations of state laws.|$|E
5|$|The long <b>sentences</b> <b>of</b> the Gun Court and its {{restrictions}} {{on the rights of}} the accused have given rise to constitutional challenges, some of which have been appealed to the Privy Council in London. These cases have resulted in some modifications to the court, but have upheld it on the whole. The Gun Court system has also been the target of criticism because of its lengthy delay in hearing cases, and the continuing rise in gun violence since its adoption.|$|E

5|$|The second {{argument}} that Fodor provides {{in favour of}} representational realism involves the processes of thought. This argument touches on {{the relation between the}} representational theory of mind and models of its architecture. If the <b>sentences</b> <b>of</b> Mentalese require unique processes of elaboration then they require a computational mechanism of a certain type. The syntactic notion of mental representations {{goes hand in hand with}} the idea that mental processes are calculations which act only on the form of the symbols which they elaborate. And this is the computational theory of the mind. Consequently, the defence of a model of architecture based on classic artificial intelligence passes inevitably through a defence of the reality of mental representations.|$|E
5|$|The {{trials of}} the central {{committee}} of the Fasci, {{that took place in}} Palermo in April and May 1894, were the final blow to the movement. In spite of an eloquent defence, which turned the Court into a political platform and thrilled every socialist in the country, they were condemned to heavy <b>sentences</b> <b>of</b> imprisonment. On May 30, 1894, the leaders of the movement received their sentence: Giuseppe de Felice Giuffrida to 18 years and Rosario Bosco, Nicola Barbato and Bernardino Verro to 12 years in jail.|$|E

5|$|There {{were several}} avenues of appeal {{available}} to the Bali Nine. Lawyers had seven days post-sentencing to lodge appeals.

All appealed to overturn their sentence. The <b>sentences</b> <b>of</b> Chen, Czugaj, Nguyen, Norman and Stephens stand at life imprisonment and Lawrence's sentence remains at 20 years after appeal.

5|$|Under {{common law}} tradition, civilians could possess {{firearms}} except artillery and insidious weapons (e.g. firearms that had appearance of other objects, etc.). First gun control laws were enacted during early 18th century {{and dealt with}} illegal use of firearms for poaching. At the time, hunting was an exclusive noble privilige with little to no legal option for participation of common folk. Despite tough <b>sentences</b> <b>of</b> 12 years of hard labor or death introduced by a 1727 enactment, poaching with use of firearms remained widespread {{to the point that}} a 1732 Royal Gamekeeping Rules noted that gamekeepers were in constant danger of being shot by poachers.|$|E
5|$|After the war, five Croatian {{fighters were}} charged and convicted of eleven counts of murder, one of {{attempted}} murder, {{and one of}} torture of Serb civilians found in the JNA barracks, which surrendered on 15 September 1991.

Before the conviction became final in 2009, and to avoid extradition, Glavaš fled to Bosnia and Herzegovina, where he had granted citizenship. His sentence was reduced to eight years and became final in 2010, {{when he was arrested}} and imprisoned in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
