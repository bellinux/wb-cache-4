5|$|Australia {{headed into}} the First Test at Trent Bridge {{starting}} on 10 June with ten wins and two draws from twelve tour matches, with eight innings victories. It was thought that Bradman would play a specialist leg spinner, but {{he changed his mind}} on the first morning when rain was forecast. Bill Johnston, a left-arm paceman and orthodox spinner, was played in the hope of exploiting a wet wicket. This was the only change from the teams that Australia had fielded in the matches against Worcestershire and the MCC. Yardley won the toss and elected to bat. Pundits predicted that the pitch would be ideal for batting apart from some assistance to fast bowlers in the first hour, as the surface of the pitch had become moist following overnight rain, assisting seam bowling. Australia's <b>selection</b> <b>policy</b> meant that their reserve opener Brown would bat out of position in the middle order while Barnes and Morris opened, while Neil Harvey was dropped despite making a century in Australia's most recent Test against India.|$|E
5|$|The post-First World War years {{marked a}} decline in Welsh rugby. An {{industrial}} recession struck the principality, and hurt South Wales in particular. Welsh international results in the 1920s mirrored {{the performance of the}} economy: of their 42 matches they won only 17, with three drawn. Half-a-million people emigrated from Wales to find work elsewhere during the depression; this included many Welsh rugby union internationals who moved to the professional code of rugby league. Between 1923 and 1928, Wales managed only seven victories – five of them against France. However, even France managed to defeat Wales that decade; achieving their first victory over Wales in 1928. Welsh <b>selection</b> <b>policy</b> reflected the upheavals of the mid-1920s. In 1924, 35 different players were selected for Wales' four matches, with a different captain for each; and only Edward Watkins in the backs and Charlie Pugh in the forwards, playing in all four matches.|$|E

25|$|Croydon is {{also home}} to three single-sex Catholic state schools. The {{formerly}} independent John Fisher School in Purley has not charged fees since the late 1970s, but during the 1990s was selective, choosing boys via exams, interviews, tests, previous school reports and written statements. The school ended its <b>selection</b> <b>policy</b> in 1999, and now accepts pupils under a points system, which discriminates in favour of those who have high mass attendance and whose families are most involved in the Catholic Church. Coloma Convent Girls' School is one of England's Catholic girls' schools: formerly a grammar school, it has now, like John Fisher, adopted points-based admission criteria. St. Joseph's College, located on Beulah Hill in Upper Norwood, is a boys' school with a mixed sixth form.|$|E
40|$|Quota-based {{selection}} {{systems are}} viewed {{as a way to}} overcome biases; however, they may produce negative effects on the individuals {{as well as on the}} organizations that enact said procedures. To date, the processes underlying these negative effects have been relatively neglected in the literature and thus warrant further investigation. The current paper specifically seeks to address the process through which quota-based <b>selection</b> <b>policies</b> influence applicant evaluations of the organization and ultimately their decision to pursue employment. We demonstrate that quota-based <b>selection</b> <b>policies</b> negatively impact procedural justice perceptions, which in turn influenced perceptions of anticipated organizational support, organizational prestige, and organizational attractiveness. Ultimately, these organizational evaluations worked together to predict job pursuit intentions. The findings suggest that organizations need to carefully consider how they present their <b>selection</b> <b>policies</b> to applicant pools as they may harm organizational attractiveness and job pursuit intentions. The present study comes at a timely point in the discussion and implementation of quotas in Europe, and specifically in Germany, and provides some initial insights into how organizations are likely to be affected by such policies...|$|R

25|$|On 26 July 2004, Klinsmann {{returned}} to Germany {{as the new}} {{head coach of the}} national team, succeeding former teammate and strike partner Rudi Völler. Klinsmann subsequently embarked on an aggressive program to revamp the management of the team. Bringing fellow German striker Oliver Bierhoff on board helped diffuse public relations duties of the previous combined post away from the actual coaching aspect of the position. Furthermore, he created a youth movement to breathe life into an aging squad {{on the heels of a}} disastrous showing at Euro 2004. In the run-up to the 2006 World Cup, Klinsmann attracted criticism from German fans and the media following poor results, such as the 4–1 loss to Italy. A particular subject of criticism was that Klinsmann commuted to Germany from the U.S., which was the target of a campaign by the tabloid Bild. It should be noted Klinsmann previously eliminated some privileges Bild traditionally had with the national team, such as receiving the team lineup the day before a match and 24/7 exclusive access to the team. His largely offensive tactics have irritated some, who complained he ignored defensive football. He announced a squad of young players for the 2006 World Cup, basing his <b>selection</b> <b>policy</b> on performance, not reputation.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1996 Good tool {{management}} and job operating strategies {{will result in}} reduction in tool inventory and associated costs. Very little empirical {{research has been conducted}} on a Flexible Manufacturing System (FMS) as a whole in relation to its performances with tool movement approach, specifically in a dynamic job shop in a tool shared environment. This study evaluated job loading rules and tool <b>selection</b> <b>policies</b> in a tool shared environment with regards to the job shop performance as a whole. This research also examined the relationship between job loading rules and tool <b>selection</b> <b>policies</b> when tool movement approach was employed. A process oriented manufacturing system simulation procedure was used as the theoretical framework for this research, which was pursued in two phases. The first phase was focused on the development of a generalized simulation model and identification of the bottleneck conditions and merits of different simple rules. The second phase, then, was emphasized on development of bi-criterion rules and determining the "best" strategies used for bottlenecks under different simulation models and operating conditions. This research concentrated on heuristic rules. The nature of the study was observational, in which computer simulation outputs were collected and analyzed by multifactor analysis of variance, Fisher's Least Significant Difference method, and non-parametric tests. Experimental designs were used for comparing job loading rules and tool <b>selection</b> <b>policies,</b> as well as shop operating conditions. Significant differences were found among job loading rules, tool duplication levels, and tool <b>selection</b> <b>policies.</b> Furthermore, significant interaction effects were also observed between some independent factors. Job loading rules play the most important role in the system performance, specially with more tool copies. Tool <b>selection</b> <b>policies</b> affect the percent tardy jobs with single tool copy. It is noticed that in the multiple-machine and multiple-tool situations higher machine utilization can be obtained at higher tool duplication levels. The analysis of results showed that different processing time distributions also effect system performance measures...|$|R

Müller again played in every game of the season and scored 19 goals (12 in the league), but the season was less successful for Bayern, as they finished third in the league, and were knocked out of the DFB-Pokal in the semi-finals by Schalke 04 and in the round of 16 of the UEFA Champions League by Inter Milan; Bayern had won 1–0 at the San Siro, and Müller scored 31 minutes into the second leg to make it 3–1 on aggregate, but Inter levelled the score at 3–3 in the 88th minute to go through on the away goals rule.
