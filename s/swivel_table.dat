40|$|Measuring and {{compensating}} {{the pivot}} points of five-axis machine tools is always challenging and very time consuming. This paper presents a newly developed approach for automatic measurement and compensation of pivot point positional errors on five-axis machine tools. Machine rotary axis errors are measured using a circular test. This method {{has been tested}} on five-axis machine tools with <b>swivel</b> <b>table</b> configuration. Results show that up to 99 % of the positional errors of the rotary axis can be compensated by using this approach...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} and compare interactions between the abdominal musculature and intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) during controlled dynamic and static trunk muscle loading. Myoelectric activity was recorded in six subjects from the rectus abdominis, obliquus externus, obliquus internus, transversus abdominis and erector spinae muscles using surface and intra-muscular fine-wire electrodes. The IAP was recorded intra-gastrically. Trunk flexions and extensions were performed lying on one side on a <b>swivel</b> <b>table.</b> An adjustable brake provided different friction loading conditions, while adding weights to an unbraked <b>swivel</b> <b>table</b> afforded various levels of inertial loading. During trunk extensions at all friction loads, IAP was elevated (1. 8 - 7. 2 kPa) with concomitant activity in transversus abdominis and obliquus internus muscles-little or no activity was seen from rectus abdominis and obliquus externus muscles. For inertia loading during trunk extension, IAP levels were somewhat lower (1. 8 - 5. 6 kPa) and displayed a second peak when abdominal muscle activity occurred in the course of decelerating the movement. For single trunk flexions with friction loading, IAP was higher than that seen in extension conditions and increased with added resistance. For inertial loading during trunk flexion, IAP showed two peaks, the larger first peak matched peak forward acceleration and general abdominal muscle activation, while the second corresponded to peak deceleration and was accompanied by activity in transversus abdominis and erector spinae muscles. It was apparent that different loading strategies produced markedly different patterns of response in both trunk musculature and intra-abdominal pressure...|$|E
40|$|In humans, intra-abdominal {{pressure}} (IAP) is elevated during many everyday activities. This experiment aimed {{to investigate the}} extent to which increased IAP-without concurrent activity of the abdominal or back extensor muscles-produces an extensor torque. With subjects positioned in side lying on a <b>swivel</b> <b>table</b> with its axis at L 3, moments about this vertebral level were measured when IAP was transiently increased by electrical stimulation of the diaphragm via the phrenic nerve. There was no electromyographic activity in abdominal and back extensor muscles. When IAP was increased artificially to similar to 15 % of the maximum IAP amplitude that could be generated voluntarily with the trunk positioned in flexion, a trunk extensor moment (similar to 6 Nm) was recorded. The size of the effect was proportional to the increase in pressure. The extensor moment was consistent with that predicted from a model based on measurements of abdominal cross-sectional area and IAP moment arm. When IAP was momentarily increased while the trunk was flexed passively at a constant velocity, the external torque required to maintain the velocity was increased. These results provide the first in vivo data of the amplitude of extensor moment that is produced by increased IAP. Although the net effect of this extensor torque in functional tasks would be dependent on the muscles used to increase the IAP and their associated flexion torque, the data do provide evidence that IAP contributes, at least in part, to spinal stability.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited I This report describes the conceptual {{design of a}} direct pump-out facility for Corps of Engineers 1 hopper dredges. Operational conditions were a significant wave height of 6. 0 ft, wind velocity of 30 knots, I and a current velocity of 2 knots. The mooring system was designed for operation in a minimum depth of 30 ft and a maximum depth of 45 ft. The following operational criteria were also required for the mooring design: (a) transportation by truck or rail, (b) rapid assembly {{with little or no}} diver support, and (c) installation with a minimum of lift support. The report examines five alternatives: (a) a guyed tower, tension leg platform (TLP), (b) a single anchor mooring (SALM), (c) a three-leg catenary anchor leg mooring (CALM), and (d) a four-leg CALM. The four-leg CALM was selected for further study because it best met the operational criteria. To accommodate truck transport, a 28 -ft-long, I 1 -ft 6 -in. -high, 7 -ft 6 -in. -deep capsule buoy was designed.
