40|$|The {{terrorist}} attacks of 9 / 11 / 2001 and the ensuing anthrax attacks a month later resulted in intense and continuing fear within the United States, including within the U. <b>S.</b> <b>scientific</b> community, concerning {{the potential for a}} future bioterrorist attack that could have a far more catastrophic impact (Atlas 2002 a). As stated by Lane et al. (2001), “The civilian population in the U. S. may never be able to return to that state of false security, of believing that some acts are so repugnant that they are beyond human deed…A sense of complacency and safety is now replaced by a sense of unyielding urgency. ” This sense of public vulnerability has been reinforced by several leading members of the U. <b>S.</b> <b>scientific</b> community who have voiced concerns that advances in biotechnology will empower terrorists to carry out more harmful acts of bioterrorism. Even before 2001, prominent members of the U. <b>S.</b> <b>scientific</b> community had expressed the view that the threat of bioterrorism needed the attention of the scientific community and policy makers (Atlas 2001). On April 10, 1998, members of the scientific community met with President Clinton at the White House and warned that the nation was dangerously under-prepared for a biological attack and needed to develop and stockpile vaccines, antibiotics, and other therapies (Miller et al 2001). Some members of the scientific community, including Michael Osterholm— a public health microbiologist and former state epidemiologist for Minnesota—publicl...|$|E

40|$|Current {{accounts}} {{of the development of}} scientific reasoning focus on individual children 2 ̆ 7 s ability to coordinate the collection and evaluation of evidence with the creation of theories to explain the evidence. This observational study of parent–child interactions in a children 2 ̆ 7 s museum demonstrated that parents shape and support children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>scientific</b> thinking in everyday, nonobligatory activity. When children engaged an exhibit with parents, their exploration of evidence was observed to be longer, broader, and more focused on relevant comparisons than children who engaged the exhibit without their parents. Parents were observed to talk to children about how to select and encode appropriate evidence and how to make direct comparisons between the most informative kinds of evidence. Parents also sometimes assumed the role of explained by casting children 2 ̆ 7 s experience in causal terms, connecting the experience to prior knowledge, or introducing abstract principles. We discuss these findings with respect to two dimensions of children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>scientific</b> thinking: developments in evidence collection and developments in theory construction...|$|E

This research was conducted from January to June 2015. Sample in this research were 34 students of 2014 grade in FKIP Biologi UR used parameters were (1) scientific attitude with 4 indicators (curiosity, cooperative, carefulness and discipline); (2) creativity of product. Observation instrument managed by reseacher and the realibility values based Alfa Cronbach is 0. 70 - 0. 87. The creativity was scored through product (report) by using portofolio instrument, with descriptors were: Initiative (collecting information), inovation (environmental issues that are happening), variation of idea (way of display data), and suitable idea and their solution. The data analyzed was using SPSS. Descriptive statistic were percent, mean, standard deviation and inference statistic (Multiple regretion). Mean values shows that student 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>scientific</b> attitude was 79, 99 (good), and the creativity of product was 80, 10 (good).
