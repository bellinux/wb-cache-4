5|$|The {{committee}} {{signed off}} on all of Zahorchak's proposals except for his call to remove four principals in exchange for up to $15million in federal grants that mandate leadership or staff changes {{as a condition for}} receiving the money. Zahorchak proposed transferring the principals from the Allen and Dieruff high schools, Central Elementary and Harrison-Morton Middle School to the district's nonprofit foundation, then use the federal grant money to open a special school for advanced placement and honors students. The committee did not vote or comment on the matter on October 14. Zahorchak <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>still</b> planned to pursue the plan but apologized for speaking to the media about it on October 12 before discussing it with the district and staff, a move that caused angst among the staff and some members of the public.|$|E
5|$|The manga was {{not popular}} initially. Although he {{suspected}} the fighting genre would appeal more to its shōnen audience, Toriyama tried {{to stick to}} the Journey to the West adventure aspect which he himself enjoyed. Such as having the setting change each chapter, different enemies popping up, and different locations. It was only after he became tired of Torishima nagging about its popularity that Toriyama gave in and developed more battles with the first shown Tenkaichi Budōkai. Despite his reluctance, the author said it felt good when the series picked up in popularity at that point. However, he <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>still</b> tried to resist by returning to the adventure aspect with the Red Ribbon Army arc, and visiting Penguin Village from Dr. Slump to add comedy. When that did not work out, fighting became the main theme for the manga.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950–51 NBA season, Mikan was {{dominant}} again, {{scoring a}} career-best 28.4 {{points per game}} in the regular season, again taking the scoring crown, and had 3.1 assists per game. In that year, the NBA introduced a new statistic: rebounds. In this category, Mikan also stood out; his 14.1 rebounds per game (rpg) was only second to the 16.4 rpg of Dolph Schayes of Syracuse. In that year, Mikan participated {{in one of the}} most notorious NBA games ever played. When the Fort Wayne Pistons played against his Lakers, the Pistons took a 19–18 lead. Afraid that Mikan would mount a comeback if he got the ball, the Pistons passed the ball around without any attempt to score a basket. With no shot clock invented yet to force them into offense, the score stayed 19–18 to make it the lowest-scoring NBA game of all time. This game was an important factor in the development of the shot clock, which was introduced four years later. Mikan had scored 15 of the Lakers' 18 points, thus scoring 83.3% of his team's points, setting an NBA all-time record. In the post season, Mikan fractured his leg before the 1951 Western Division Finals against the Rochester Royals. With Mikan hardly able to move all series long, the Royals won 3–1. Decades later, in 1990, Mikan recalled that his leg was taped with a plate; however, despite effectively hopping around the court on one foot, he <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>still</b> averaged 20-odd points per game.|$|E

25|$|Less {{than a week}} later, Carpenter {{announced}} he would not travel to the club's Spring training site in Jupiter, Florida and instead remain in St. Louis, fearing {{he could be a}} distraction.

On February 22, the team placed Carpenter on the 60-day disabled list.|$|E
25|$|On November 1, 2007, {{the land}} swap deal with {{developer}} Kingston Gould III (first signed in January 2005) was finally approved. Although the City Council had {{signed off on}} the deal in June 2005, the city took another 25 months to change local zoning regulations so that Gould was exempted from building housing on his new site (as required by the agreement). Gould <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>still</b> had not decided what should be built there. The approval meant Gould could not begin considering what project to place on his land.|$|E

500|$|James Cameron had {{a fascination}} with shipwrecks, and, for him, the RMS Titanic was [...] "the Mount Everest of shipwrecks." [...] He was almost past the {{point in his life}} when he felt he could {{consider}} an undersea expedition, but <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>still</b> had [...] "a mental restlessness" [...] to live the life he had turned away from when he switched from the sciences to the arts in college. So when an IMAX film was made from footage shot of the wreck itself, he decided to seek Hollywood funding to [...] "pay for an expedition and do the same thing." [...] It was [...] "not because I particularly wanted to make the movie," [...] Cameron said. [...] "I wanted to dive to the shipwreck." ...|$|E
500|$|In October 2012, Universal Pictures {{announced}} plans for Schwarzenegger {{to return to the}} role of Conan for the film The Legend of Conan. The story will be a direct sequel of the original film, [...] "bypassing" [...] Conan the Destroyer and the 2011 film starring Jason Momoa. [...] In June 2013, Schwarzenegger <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>still</b> had plans to make The Legend of Conan, but after Terminator Genisys, which began shooting in 2014. In October 2013, Deadline reported that Andrea Berloff was to write the film's script. [...] In February 2015, IGN reported that Will Beall was writing the script. On May 24, 2015, Chris Morgan told The Arnold Fans website that the film's script is ready and revealed that at least three characters from the first film will be returning.

500|$|Confronted by a Puritan {{friend with}} rumours about his [...] "ungodly life", Dudley defended himself in 1576: I {{stand on the}} top of the hill, where ... the {{smallest}} slip seemeth a fall ... I may fall many ways and have more witnesses thereof than many others who perhaps be no saints neither ... for my faults ... they lie before Him who I have no doubt but will cancel them as I have been and shall be most heartily sorry for them. With Douglas Sheffield, a young widow of the Howard family, he had a serious relationship from about 1569. He explained to her that he could not marry, not even in order to beget a Dudley heir, without his [...] "utter overthrow": You must think it is some marvellous cause ... that forceth me thus to be cause almost of the ruin of mine own house ... my brother you see long married and not like to have children, it resteth so now in myself; and yet such occasions is there ... as if I should marry I am sure never to have [...] favour". Although in this letter Leicester <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>still</b> loved her as he did at the beginning, he offered her his help to find another husband for reasons of respectability if she so wished. The affair continued and in 1574 [...] Douglas gave birth to a son, also called Robert Dudley.|$|E

500|$|But Shankly soon regretted his {{decision}} {{and tried to}} continue his involvement with the club, mainly by turning up for team training at Melwood. He <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>still</b> wanted the involvement as the club had become his life. He soon stopped going to Melwood because he felt there was some resentment and people were asking {{what he was doing}} there. He felt unwanted, but [...] "I never resented the club after I left, as some stupid person wrote in the paper." [...] He still attended matches, but sat in the stand away from the directors and staff. He was especially annoyed that Liverpool did not invite him to attend away matches as the club's guest. When, finally, he was invited to travel with them to the away leg of the 1976 UEFA Cup Final in Bruges, he was accommodated in a separate hotel and said he found that insulting. Shankly contrasted Liverpool's attitude with what he encountered at other clubs, including Liverpool's great rivals Everton and Manchester United, where he was received warmly. He recalled Manchester United manager Tommy Docherty's reply to a Liverpool director: [...] "Aye, Bill's welcome here". About Everton, once his greatest rivals, he wrote: [...] "I have been received more warmly by Everton than I have by Liverpool. It is a scandal that I must write these words about the club I helped to build".|$|E

2500|$|After {{his loss}} to Pete Williams, Coleman went to train with former UFC {{champion}} Ken Shamrock and his Lion's Den training camp for his upcoming bout with feared Brazilian striker Pedro Rizzo at UFC 18.

2500|$|At {{the end of}} 1935 Walters {{resigned}} as secretary and captain of Worcestershire, but <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>still</b> hoped {{to play for the}} county as often as possible. However, as it turned out, his career was already over as he concentrated on his marriage. Even when Walters did not appear in first-class cricket in 1936, however, Worcestershire believed he would play regularly in 1937 and complement a bowling attack that in a few years had gone from woeful to excellent. However, he did not play at all, {{and by the end of}} that year Worcestershire finally knew he would not be seen in the cricket field again. He had [...] "married well" [...] and his wife's private income may have played a part in his not playing again. He was a sham amateur in the days of gentlemen and players.|$|E

2500|$|Beginning {{with the}} 1995-1997 solo {{acoustic}} Ghost of Tom Joad Tour and associated promotional media appearances, Springsteen radically recast [...] "Born in the U.S.A." [...] once again, playing an acoustic guitar version that was unlike both the original Nebraska and full band performances. [...] This was a stinging, snarling rendition that only included the title phrase twice. [...] This was both {{in connection with}} the Tom Joad Tour's wan moods as well as Springsteen's attempt to make clear the song's original and only purpose; in his introduction to the song in this shows he <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>still</b> wasn't convinced the song had been misinterpreted, but now as the songwriter he was [...] "going to get the last say." [...] Fan reaction was divided, with some greatly liking the new arrangement and others thinking the song's musical ironies had been lost.|$|E

Verdonk said she would continue in the House of Representatives and that she would not give up her seat. She also confirmed that she would not join the Partij voor de Vrijheid.

2500|$|As Molyneux {{had been}} made a Vice President of Electronic Arts, his {{corporate}} role and responsibility increased considerably and he began making frequent trips to San Francisco. Over time, he grew increasingly frustrated with the position and wished to return to being a game developer. In July 1996, Molyneux decided to resign from Bullfrog to focus on game design, rather than become a mere employee. In response, Electronic Arts banned him from their offices, forcing him to move development of Dungeon Keeper to his house. Molyneux speculated that this was because they were scared {{that he would take}} people with him. He decided to leave as soon as Dungeon Keeper was finished, and commented: [...] "My last day will be the day that this game goes into final test. I'm very, very, very sad, but also very relieved". He also said that Electric Arts were [...] "unbelievably patient", and thanked Vice President Mark Lewis for campaigning for Dungeon Keepers completion. Molyneux's planned departure was his motivation to make Dungeon Keeper good. He believed that he would enjoy being an executive, but said that it was [...] "an utter nightmare". Shortly after his departure, Molyneux <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>still</b> had feelings for Bullfrog, and wished them success. Despite his dissatisfaction with the corporate aspects of being a Vice President of Electronic Arts, Molyneux said that he had learned [...] "an enormous amount". In 2017, he revealed that his resignation was a result of his and technical director Tim Rance's drunkenness, and said he would take his resignation email back if he could.|$|E
