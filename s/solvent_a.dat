25|$|The {{solubility}} {{of organic}} compounds nearly always increases with temperature.

25|$|Nucleophilic attack: the carbocation {{reacts with}} the {{nucleophile}}. If the nucleophile is a neutral molecule (i.e. a <b>solvent)</b> <b>a</b> third step {{is required to}} complete the reaction. When the solvent is water, the intermediate is an oxonium ion.

25|$|The Rothemund {{synthesis}} is a condensation and oxidation {{starting with}} pyrrole and an aldehyde. In solution-phase synthesis, acidic conditions are essential; formic acid, acetic acid, and propionic acid are typical reaction solvents, or p-toluenesulfonic acid or various Lewis acids {{can be used}} with a non-acidic <b>solvent.</b> <b>A</b> large amount of side-product is formed and is removed, usually by recrystallization or chromatography.|$|E
25|$|For {{simulating}} {{molecules in}} a <b>solvent,</b> <b>a</b> choice {{should be made}} between explicit and implicit solvent. Explicit solvent particles (such as the TIP3P, SPC/E and SPC-f water models) must be calculated expensively by the force field, while implicit solvents use a mean-field approach. Using an explicit solvent is computationally expensive, requiring inclusion of roughly ten times more particles in the simulation. But the granularity and viscosity of explicit solvent is essential to reproduce certain properties of the solute molecules. This is especially important to reproduce chemical kinetics.|$|E
25|$|Similar to the {{previous}} technique, the TIPS phase separation procedure {{requires the use of}} a solvent with a low melting point that is easy to sublime. For example, dioxane could be used to dissolve polylactic acid, then phase separation is induced through the addition of a small quantity of water: a polymer-rich and a polymer-poor phase are formed. Following cooling below the solvent melting point and some days of vacuum-drying to sublime the <b>solvent,</b> <b>a</b> porous scaffold is obtained. Liquid-liquid phase separation presents the same drawbacks of emulsification/freeze-drying.|$|E

25|$|Supercritical {{hydrolysis}} is {{a method}} of converting all biomass polysaccharides as well the associated lignin into low molecular compounds by contacting with water alone under supercritical conditions. The supercritical water, acts as a <b>solvent,</b> <b>a</b> supplier of bond-breaking thermal energy, a heat transfer agent and {{as a source of}} hydrogen atoms. All polysaccharides are converted into simple sugars in near-quantitative yield in a second or less. The aliphatic inter-ring linkages of lignin are also readily cleaved into free radicals that are stabilized by hydrogen originating from the water. The aromatic rings of the lignin are unaffected under short reaction times so that the lignin-derived products are low molecular weight mixed phenols. To take advantage of the very short reaction times needed for cleavage a continuous reaction system must be devised. The amount of water heated to a supercritical state is thereby minimized.|$|E
500|$|The {{compound}} 2-chlorobenzalmalononitrile (also called o-chlorobenzylidene malononitrile; chemical formula: C10H5ClN2), a cyanocarbon, is {{the defining}} {{component of a}} tear gas {{commonly referred to as}} CS gas, which is used as a riot control agent. [...] Exposure causes a burning sensation and tearing of the eyes {{to the extent that the}} subject cannot keep their eyes open, and a burning irritation of the nose, mouth and throat mucous membranes causing profuse coughing, mucous nasal discharge, disorientation, and difficulty breathing, partially incapacitating the subject. [...] CS gas is an aerosol of a volatile <b>solvent</b> (<b>a</b> substance that dissolves other active substances and that easily evaporates) and 2-chlorobenzalmalononitrile, which is a solid compound at room temperature. CS gas is generally accepted as being non-lethal. It was first synthesized by two Americans, Ben Corson and Roger Stoughton, at Middlebury College in 1928, and the chemical's name is derived from the first letters of the scientists' surnames.|$|E

2500|$|The {{mobile phase}} {{composition}} {{does not have}} to remain constant. A separation in which the mobile phase composition is changed during the separation process is described as a gradient elution. One example is a gradient starting at 10% methanol and ending at 90% methanol after 20 minutes. The two components of the mobile phase are typically termed [...] "A" [...] and [...] "B"; A is the [...] "weak" [...] solvent which allows the solute to elute only slowly, while B is the [...] "strong" [...] solvent which rapidly elutes the solutes from the column. In reversed-phase chromatography, <b>solvent</b> <b>A</b> is often water or an aqueous buffer, while B is an organic solvent miscible with water, such as acetonitrile, methanol, THF, or isopropanol.|$|E
2500|$|... 1,1,1,2-Tetrafluoroethane is a {{non-flammable}} gas used {{primarily as a}} [...] "high-temperature" [...] refrigerant for domestic refrigeration and automobile air conditioners. [...] These devices began using 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane in the early 1990s {{as a replacement for}} the more environmentally harmful R-12 and retrofit kits are available to convert units that were originally R-12-equipped. [...] Other uses include plastic foam blowing, as a cleaning <b>solvent,</b> <b>a</b> propellant for the delivery of pharmaceuticals (e.g. bronchodilators), wine cork removers, gas dusters, such as Dust-Off, and in air driers for removing the moisture from compressed air. [...] 1,1,1,2-Tetrafluoroethane has also been used to cool computers in some overclocking attempts. It is the refrigerant used in plumbing pipe freeze kits. It is also commonly used as a propellant for airsoft airguns. The gas is often mixed with a silicon-based lubricant.|$|E
2500|$|Solid samples can be {{prepared}} {{in a variety of}} ways. One common method is to crush the sample with an oily mulling agent (usually mineral oil Nujol). A thin film of the mull is applied onto salt plates and measured. The second method is to grind a quantity of the sample with a specially purified salt (usually potassium bromide) finely (to remove scattering effects from large crystals). This powder mixture is then pressed in a mechanical press to form a translucent pellet through which the beam of the spectrometer can pass. [...] A third technique is the [...] "cast film" [...] technique, which is used mainly for polymeric materials. The sample is first dissolved in a suitable, non hygroscopic <b>solvent.</b> <b>A</b> drop of this solution is deposited on surface of KBr or NaCl cell. The solution is then evaporated to dryness and the film formed on the cell is analysed directly. Care is important to ensure that the film is not too thick otherwise light cannot pass through. This technique is suitable for qualitative analysis. The final method is to use microtomy to cut a thin (20–100µm) film from a solid sample. This {{is one of the most}} important ways of analysing failed plastic products for example because the integrity of the solid is preserved.|$|E
