The Ku-band antenna was deployed and the <b>self-test</b> was completed with satisfactory results. CAPCOM astronaut Barry Wilmore radioed the crew from mission control in Houston, reporting that a preliminary analysis found {{no signs of}} any significant debris or impact damage during the ascent. Commander Ferguson and Pilot Hurley also powered up the Shuttle's Robotic Arm and checked its functions ahead of next day's planned thermal protection survey.|$|E
25|$|A {{microprocessor-based}} digital {{protection relay}} can replace {{the functions of}} many discrete electromechanical instruments. These relays convert voltage and currents to digital form and process the resulting measurements using a microprocessor. The digital relay can emulate functions of many discrete electromechanical relays in one device, simplifying protection design and maintenance. Each digital relay can run <b>self-test</b> routines to confirm its readiness and alarm if a fault is detected. Digital relays can also provide functions such as communications (SCADA) interface, monitoring of contact inputs, metering, waveform analysis, and other useful features. Digital relays can, for example, store multiple sets of protection parameters, which allows {{the behavior of the}} relay to be changed during maintenance of attached equipment. Digital relays also can provide protection strategies impossible to implement with electromechanical relays. This is particularly so in long distance high voltage or multi-terminal circuits or in lines that are series or shunt compensated They also offer benefits in self-testing and communication to supervisory control systems.|$|E
25|$|On 17 October 1997, the mid-morning {{service to}} Wellington broke down 2.5km into the Rimutaka Tunnel from the Featherston portal after an {{electrical}} fault in locomotive DC 4951's control gear. The Rimutaka Tunnel is a radio dead-spot, {{and the train}} driver and guard found the Train Control telephones on the tunnel wall to be dead. Shortly afterwards, the tunnel alarm sounded at Upper Hutt signal box indicating the train {{had been in the}} tunnel for more than 15 minutes, and a full-scale emergency response was activated. The train was removed from the tunnel two hours later by a relief locomotive from the Featherston end after a haphazard response {{on both sides of the}} tunnel. There were no injuries, although some elderly passengers required medical treatment due to the distress of the event. After the incident, changes were made to the Train Control telephones so they would <b>self-test</b> and track occupancy rules were modified to allow trains to coast out of the tunnel (which has a gradient of 0.25% to 0.55%) if they became disabled. Emergency services on either side of the tunnel now carry out training exercises every 2â€“3 years in preparation for such a situation.|$|E
25|$|The {{keyboard}} LED uses blink codes: one blink {{means the}} keyboard ROM has a checksum error, two blinks means RAM failure, three blinks means watchdog timer failure. Using Caps Lock key {{and getting a}} response means CIA and the CPU works. There {{is no guarantee that}} every blinking state or color is accurate. Remember when the diagnostic codes are triggered it means the computer has some kind of fault and it can easily mis-interpret the fault and give false readings. For example, if the screen flashes green it can mean the Agnus is bad, the Agnus socket is bad, the logic connected to the Agnus is bad, the logic connected to the CPU is bad, the logic connected to the RAM is bad, a connection between CPU and/or logic and/or Agnus and/or Chip RAM is bad and/or some/all of the chip RAM is faulty etc. etc. Many of the issues with Amigas are caused by damage from corrosion or poor repair skills, especially the A500+ which has a Ni-Cad battery fitted and is always corroded if the battery has not been removed. Likewise a corroded battery on an A501 can cause faults on the A500 motherboard if the corrosion is very bad and has spread to the motherboard. The <b>self-test</b> chip RAM check is very brief and simplistic and all the other tests are minimalistic to minimize the start-up time (as documented in the Amiga Hardware Manual and many other official Commodore technical documents) so {{there is no guarantee that}} any of the diagnostic colours are 100% accurate.|$|E

2500|$|The {{question}} of who should be first to try the procedure in a new experiment is an ethical one. [...] However, according to Altman {{it is not a}} question that can successfully be legislated. [...] A law requiring <b>self-test</b> would force researchers to take risks that may sometimes be inappropriate. [...] A code forbidding it might inhibit valuable discoveries.|$|E
2500|$|Until early 2007, {{a notable}} feature of these {{machines}} was their frequent printer <b>self-test</b> routine, {{which resulted in}} the production of two test tickets (one from the main ticket printer, one from the receipt and card sales voucher printer) showing all of the printable characters. [...] These were also produced when the machine's underlying Microsoft Windows software is reset. [...] The test tickets would drop into the collection tray {{at the bottom of the}} machine.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are many}} reasons experimenters decide to <b>self-test,</b> but amongst the most {{fundamental}} is the ethical principle that the experimenter should not subject {{the participants in the}} experiment to any procedure they would not be willing to undertake themselves. [...] This idea was first codified in the Nuremberg Code in 1947, which was a result of the trials of Nazi doctors at the Nuremberg trials accused of murdering and torturing victims in valueless experiments. [...] Several of these doctors were hanged. [...] Point five of the Nuremberg Code requires that no experiment should be conducted that is dangerous to the subjects unless the experimenters themselves also take part. [...] The Nuremberg Code has influenced medical experiment codes of practice around the world, as has the exposure of experiments that have since failed to follow it such as the notorious Tuskegee syphilis experiment.|$|E
2500|$|Unlike the IBM PC, {{which uses}} 8 kB of system ROM for {{power-on}} <b>self-test</b> (POST) and basic input/output system (BIOS), the Mac ROM is significantly larger (64 kB) and holds key OS code. Much {{of the original}} Mac ROM was coded by Andy Hertzfeld, {{a member of the}} original Macintosh team. He was able to conserve precious ROM space by writing routines in assembly language code optimized with [...] "hacks," [...] or clever programming tricks. In addition to the ROM, he also coded the kernel, the Macintosh Toolbox, and some of the desktop accessories (DAs). The icons of the operating system, which represent folders and application software, were designed by Susan Kare, who later designed the icons for Microsoft Windows 3.0. Bruce Horn and Steve Capps wrote the Macintosh Finder, {{as well as a number}} of Macintosh system utilities.|$|E
2500|$|In {{built-in}} <b>self-test</b> (BIST) techniques, storing all {{the circuit}} outputs on chip is not possible, but the circuit output {{can be compressed}} to form a signature that will later {{be compared to the}} golden signature (of the good circuit) to detect faults. Since this compression is lossy, there is always a possibility that a faulty output also generates the same signature as the golden signature and the faults cannot be detected. This condition is called error masking or aliasing. BIST is accomplished with a multiple-input signature register (MISR or MSR), which is a type of LFSR. A standard LFSR has a single XOR or XNOR gate, where the input of the gate is connected to several [...] "taps" [...] and the output is connected to the input of the first flip-flop. A MISR has the same structure, but the input to every flip-flop is fed through an XOR/XNOR gate. For example, a 4-bit MISR has a 4-bit parallel output and a 4-bit parallel input. The input of the first flip-flop is XOR/XNORd with parallel input bit zero and the [...] "taps". Every other flip-flop input is XOR/XNORd with the preceding flip-flop output and the corresponding parallel input bit. Consequently, the next state of the MISR depends on the last several states opposed to just the current state. Therefore, a MISR will always generate the same golden signature given that the input sequence is the same every time.|$|E
