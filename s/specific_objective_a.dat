40|$|The {{availability}} of multiple {{images of the}} same scene acquired with the same radar but with different polarizations, both in transmission and reception, {{has the potential to}} enhance the classification, detection and/or recognition capabilities of a remote sensing system. A way {{to take advantage of the}} full-polarimetric data is to extract, for each pixel of the considered scene, the polarimetric covariance matrix, coherence matrix, Muller matrix, and to exploit them in order to achieve a <b>specific</b> <b>objective.</b> <b>A</b> framework for detecting covariance symmetries within polarimetric SAR images is here proposed. The considered algorithm is based on the exploitation of special structures assumed by the polarimetric coherence matrix under symmetrical properties of the returns associated with the pixels under test.

40|$|Training of an {{artificial}} neural network (ANN) adjusts the internal weights of the network {{in order to minimize}} a predefined error measure. This error measure is given by an error function. Several different error functions are suggested in the literature. However, the far most common measure for regression is the mean square error. This paper looks into the possibility of improving the performance of neural networks by selecting or defining error functions that are tailor-made for a <b>specific</b> <b>objective.</b> <b>A</b> neural network trained to simulate tension forces in an anchor chain on a floating offshore platform is designed and tested. The purpose of setting up the network is to reduce calculation time in a fatigue life analysis. Therefore, the networks trained on different error functions are compared with respect to accuracy of rain flow counts of stress cycles over a number of time series simulations. It is shown that adjusting the error function to perform significantly better on a specific problem is possible. On the other hand. it is also shown that weighted error functions actually can impair the performance of an ANN...|$|E
40|$|The initial {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to better understand the reasons for the substantial increase in filter DP that was observed after the gasifier recycle loop modifications. Beyond this <b>specific</b> <b>objective,</b> <b>a</b> secondary goal was to develop a meaningful method of evaluating the effect of particle size and other particle properties on dustcake drag and filter DP. As mentioned earlier, the effect of particle size on dustcake drag and filter DP can be a very important consideration in the selection and specification of a precleaner cyclone for use upstream of the hot-gas filter. Installing a cyclone ahead of a hot-gas filter will reduce the transient areal loading of dust to the filter, but the beneficial effect of the reduced areal loading may be offset by an increase in drag associated with a finer particle-size distribution. The overall goal {{of this study was to}} better understand these tradeoffs and to ultimately develop a procedure that would be useful in analyzing the performance of hot-gas filters and in sizing new hot-gas filters. In addition to the obvious effects of a cyclone on dust loading and particle size, other indirect effects on particulate properties and flow resistance may occur when the cyclone is incorporated into the gasifier recycle loop as was the case at the PSDF. To better understand the importance of these other effects, this study sought to separate the particle-size effect from these other effects by measuring the drag of size-fractionated char samples collected before and after the recycle loop modifications...|$|E

40|$|Ansai is {{a county}} {{characterized}} by hilly loess relief that experiences all problems typical to the Loess Plateau of northern China, such as population pressure, soil loss, over-use of marginal lands, and poverty and food insecurity problems. Alleviation {{of these problems}} needs an integrated consideration of different objectives. To learn about the potentials and limitations of agricultural development and conflicts between objectives, this study conducted a systematic and trade-off analysis of different policy objectives, based on a land use optimization model (linear programming) integrating biophysical, agro-technical and socio-economic information. The results can serve two purposes, i. e., to reveal the solution space {{for each of the}} objectives and to analyze trade-off relationships between pairs of objectives. The information also forms the basis for further scenario analysis in which several objectives are considered simultaneously. The study results show that from an agro-technical point of view large opportunities exist to reduce the serious soil losses induced by crop cultivation on marginal lands, while still achieving food self-sufficiency. This can be achieved by reducing the area of marginal farmlands and efficient use of the most suitable land units, or/and by use of soil conservation measures (terracing and agro-techniques of furrow-ridging, residue mulching and rotational cropping with alfalfa). In general, achieving soil loss control was largely in agreement with improving production efficiency. However, the goal for maintenance of employment in agriculture strongly conflicted with environmental and productivity objectives. An increase of employment was associated with a distinct increase of (marginal) land area to be used for cropping, soil loss, total production cost and use of agro-chemicals, but with an almost linear decrease of labor productivity. The trade-off results also indicated that for a <b>specific</b> <b>objective,</b> <b>a</b> small deviation from its optimum value could result in a great improvement for most other objectives. These so-called nearly optimum solutions could be appealing alternatives to stakeholders. The study suggests that to promote a sustainable development in Ansai, policies are needed that stimulate efficient resource use and create opportunities for off-farm employment and income.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} the theoretical and philosophical concepts of narration, experience, and the contemporary. In this study, I analyze works of Argentinean writers and film directors from the last two decades, principally those of Sergio Chejfec, Martín Rejtman, Lisandro Alonso, Diego Meret and Lucrecia Martel. The dissertation examines how being contemporary {{is not only a}} condition of the present, but also a critical confrontation with our own time. Through the concept of narrativa I argue that seemingly plotless texts can still narrate experience even though experience can no longer be grasped - as elaborated by Walter Benjamin and Giorgio Agamben. As I understand it, suspensión refers to the possibility of narrating experience, in spite of the inherently ephemeral and fleeting nature of human experience in the present age. Suspensión is related to a way of narrating experiences without following a storyline because these narratives do not progress towards an end. They are not attached to any <b>specific</b> <b>objective,</b> <b>a</b> position that I connect to Deleuze and Guattari`s views on desire analyzing capitalism. For these authors, in our current society all desires are attached to a specific object of desire. Through the detachment of the narration from a linear plot and an end these narratives break from the dominant impositions of capitalism. My dissertation explores how the selected works, by opposing the rapid pace of the technological and information era, &# 8213;suspend&# 8214; the linear plot. They choose instead to narrate through duration, which I define as a narrative that lingers in images (Chapter 2, Alonso y Chejfec), through inertia, a narrative that progresses following automated characters and moves forward through disjointed situations (Chapter 3, Rejtman), and through pause, a narrative that emphasizes inactivity and passivity (Chapter 4, Martel and Meret). In the context of entrenched neoliberalism and globalization, I propose these are three different aesthetics that show the sense of emptiness and lack of shock within our contemporary society. At the same time, I see these aesthetics as a way of dealing with the aforementioned features as they shed light on the shadows and obscurities of the present...|$|E
40|$|THE DETECTIVE IN CHILEAN POLICE FICTION IN THE 20 TH CENTURY The {{topic of}} this project is {{the figure of the}} detective 20 th century Chilean police fiction, studied from two central aspects: the {{different}} forms of assimilation and the ways how historical truth and social exclusion are constructed. Regarding the first objective, results were the predominance of varied and hybrid assimilation forms, with just one case of parody and one controversy. That is, Chilean authors do not merely imitate or stylize their Anglo-American and Latin-American referents, but on the contrary, develop new constructs to nationalize genre. Some authors even develop a certain critical distance from the genre. Regarding the second objective, the result was that the time of action most frequently chosen by these novels coincided with their publication date, which shows the interest of this popular literature for criticizing their time. Also, the venue chosen is predominantly Santiago and its surroundings. When the scenario chosen is the central coast and, especially, southern Chile, what is generally being sought is to present a conflict between rurality and modernity. This conflict with modernity in the 20 th century acquires specific Chilean characteristics such as xenophobia, classism and the failure of institutions such as educational institutions, the courts and family. Another set of novels developed scenarios not only Chilean but also European, thereby portraying globalization processes occurred in the late 20 th century. Considering the third objective: how are historical truth and social exclusion constructed, it was found that those marginalized by police novels of the early century are immigrants, to latter give place to the popular person. A second excluded group are the aristocrats who betray the values of their class, thus showing the historical truth of them being forged as a closed group. The third exclusion is made on popular persons when besides being popular they are also atheist or are receiving some kind of illustration. A fourth excluded group are the intellectuals and artists who betray the truth by the quest for fame and money, thereby showing a critique of the separation between ethics and aesthetics. A new group of outcasts is linked to their generic status: men who do not understand the new role of women. Another social actor is the business men enriched during the military government and members and former members of security agencies. Finally, in the globalized context, the excluded ones are Europeans with an ethically inappropriate behaviour. By observing the fourth objective, it was found that there is no significant contribution regarding the research methods; the characteristic feature that nationalizes the genre is emphasising social criticism beyond the traditional Anglo-American referents. For the last <b>specific</b> <b>objective,</b> <b>a</b> group of detectives who seeks the truth and assume the risks that this implies was found; another group, however, trades on the truth, whether by class solidarity, gender or intersubjective ties.

40|$|Regulation {{of water}} {{resources}} systems has become increasingly complex during the recent decades and {{there is evidence that}} the process will become more so in future. In the Mahaweli Project Systems, especially in a country short of natural resources this task will call for sophistication in planning the system for the future with consideration being given in complete allocation of available resources for maximization of area under cultivation and generation of electrical energy. However, the average planner and the decision maker has been provided with very few new tools and techniques to compensate for the added complexities. Once the water is made available for irrigation of lands, its use is limited unless water management aspects at field level are not implemented. In order that the results be successful, careful consideration of every aspect of water management including the cultural practices is necessary. In arriving at acceptable management practices, a brief review of ancient irrigation systems management practices are discussed in order to establish continuity with past traditions [...] The specific objective is the determination of the most efficient use of the water resources of Mahaweli and adjacent river basins within the limits- of constraints, fixed with regard to the priority to meet certain demands. This lays emphasis on minimizing the loss due to water deficits as regards the water demands for irrigation and energy and capacity requirements for hydro-power during the dry years and making a balance between water demands and flood control during wet years. A large number of components, variables and relationships define the system. In order to regulate water in such a system to achieve this <b>specific</b> <b>objective</b> <b>a</b> technique that is adequate to consider all the complexities has been devised. The method of System Analysis is used in this investigation to determine the most efficient use of the limited water resources available within the Project Systems. Systems Analysis in a sense, is a method of integrated thinking, and conceptually there is very little difference between mental and mathematical models. Systems analysis cannot replace experience, in fact, it augments it. The water balance study used to determine the availability of water to meet the demands within the system, necessitated the reviewing and processing of hydrological data for INFLOWS and factors affecting the consumptive use for DEMANDS. The basic sub-systems used to build up the Macro System of water use and allocation are described in detail. The methodologies used include basic operational rules, priority for irrigation of certain areas, rule curves, probability criteria for inflows, trial and error process and successive approximations. A rather detailed review was made of the crop water requirements and the diversion requirements for irrigated perimeters. The efficiencies of the irrigation applications, cropping patterns etc. are based on past experience as described herein. As the storage reservoirs are operated for energy generation the other river systems which generate major portion of electrical energy outside the Mahaweli Basin are also considered. The model was prepared to simulate the integrated operation of all the hydraulic structures and power stations using available input data for INFLOWS, DEMANDS, and POWER TARGETS. The model is run for each year in a historical hydrologic period of 28 years with time step as one week for specified system characteristics and selected operational rules. This is repeated for different combination of reservoirs, power stations, irrigated perimeters and different operational rules. Sensitivity calculations were done to ascertain the validity of the assumptions and limitations of the analysis. Further studies and investigations are recommended {{based on the results of}} these calculations. The results of the water balance study are presented for different combinations of reservoirs and irrigation areas. Study reveals that the total area that can be successfully cultivated without any reservoirs to be about 150, 000 ha. of land while the development of all the reservoirs will make it possible to cultivate about 350, 000 ha. of land. The total annual energy production will be about 2650 GWh...|$|E
40|$|The Sultanate of Oman {{has one of}} {{the highest}} road traffic {{accident}} (RTA) related fatality rates worldwide (Al Lamki, 2010). Since Sultan Qaboos addressed this issue in a speech in October 2009, research institutions, ministries and NGOs alike have strengthened their efforts to cope with this public health burden. Yet, still little is known about the factors contributing to the high number of RTAs. Evidence from research conducted in other countries suggests that the human factor and the interaction between the human factor and the road environment are among the most frequent contributors to the occurrence of RTAs. The ultimate goal of this thesis was therefore to provide recommendations on how to adjust the road design to the human factor. In order to meet this goal, two objectives were determined, namely to identify the main human factors that contribute to the occurrence of RTAs in Oman and to investigate the human road interaction as a contributing factor to the occurrence of RTAs in Oman. A total of 296 in-depth interviews were conducted in three Omani hospitals with road users who were involved in RTAs. The data collection took place between April 2011 and May 2012. Road and environmental information were collected by visiting the RTA locations and using Google earth. In addition, road data for each RTA location was requested and provided from Muscat Municipality and the Directorate General of Road and Land Transport. For the first objective, identification of the main human factors that contribute to the occurrence of RTAs in Oman, the study on human factors conducted by Gründl (2005) was replicated. The results revealed five human factors that significantly increase the risk of causing an RTA in Oman. These factors are according to the strength of their impact: (1) inappropriate speed, (2) fatigue, (3) unintended blindness, (4) annual mileage between 20. 000 and 40. 000 km and (5) having a conversation with the passenger. The second objective, investigation of the human road interaction as a contributing factor to the occurrence of RTAs in Oman, was split into four specific objectives. These objectives addressed the extent to which roads in Oman can be considered self-explaining, the subjective perceived safety of roads, road design elements that affect driving speed and the prevalence of selected human factors according to road design elements. For the first specific objective, the extent to which the Omani road design corresponds to the recommendation on self-explaining roads suggested by Matena (2006) was investigated. It was found that none of three recommendations are met and concluded that this discrepancy may add to the occurrence of the human factor inappropriate speed. For the second <b>specific</b> <b>objective,</b> <b>a</b> logistic regression analysis was calculated with the dependent variable subjectively perceived safety of a road and various design elements as independent variables. The results indicate that the number of carriageways is the only design element that predicts subjectively perceived safety of a road. For the third specific objective, correlations and linear regression models were calculated with self-reported speed as a dependent variable and various road design elements as independent variables. It was found that speed is significantly higher in rural environments. The effects of lane and shoulder width on speed differ between rural and urban environments. Interestingly, driving speed did not correlate with the number of carriageways. For the fourth specific objective, the prevalence of human factors according to various design elements was investigated using logistic regression models. Among others, the regression models revealed that the human factor fatigue occurs more frequently on roads with dual carriageway and that inappropriate speed occurs more frequently on curves without warning signs. Contrary to previous studies (Werneke & Vollrath, 2012), it was found that the human factor unintended blindness occurs more frequently at T-intersections characterized with a high traffic volume than at T-intersections with a low traffic volume. Based on a discussion of the findings, the suggested recommendations focus on the following aspects: •	Applying basic design standards on road design. •	Considering dual carriageways and overtaking lanes. •	Capturing the road users’ attention is insufficient for safe transitions. •	Reducing speed and restricting affordances at T-intersections. •	Improving visual guidance in curves. •	Marking roundabouts according to different categories. This thesis is the first scientific work that has investigated the role of human factors and their interaction with the road environment in the causation of RTAs in a Gulf country. Although specific recommendations are suggested, this thesis is to be considered a source for future research rather than a design guidelin...|$|E

However, recently, {{the more general}} question of whether results from a given studies {{can be used to}} predict the effect of different interventions in, possibly, different contexts has received a considerable amount of attention. The usefulness of such an exercise, if successful, is obvious. The ability to extrapolate success stories and avoid failures in different situations would obviously be highly desirable. Unfortunately, a rigorous and successful extrapolation is extremely dicult...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: All public systems {{look for}} the best {{organizational}} structure to funnel part of their national income into healthcare services. Appropriate policies may differ widely across country settings. Most healthcare systems fall under one of two broad categories, either Bismark or Beveridge systems. There is no simple ideal model for the organization of health services, but most healthcare systems that follow the Beveridge healthcare model are poor performers. The Libyan Health system is a low responsive, inefficient and underperforming system that lacks goals and/or SMART. (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, Time <b>specific)</b> <b>objectives.</b> <b>A</b> look at different organization models {{in the world would}} reinforce efforts to reorganize and improve the performance of the Libyan National Healthcare services. The French Health Care System (FHCS) ranked first according to the WHO and the European Health Consumer Powerhouse. The FHCS was described to have a technically efficient, generous healthcare system that provides the best overall health care. This makes the FHCS a practical model of organization having many of the essential aspects of a modern national health service. In this review, we describe the main features of the FHCS, current challenges and future trends with particular attention paid to aspects that could be of importance to the Libyan Healthcare System...|$|R
40|$|Despite the {{extensive}} literature available on laser at the present, {{there are few}} articles about the temperature of laser radiation and its propagation on dental hard tissues. The present study general objective is to evaluate in vitro the effect of temperature increase produced by the laser radiation of 940 nm on the dental hard tissues and, as <b>specific</b> <b>objectives</b> <b>a)</b> analyze current parameters using 940 nm laser on dental hard tissues b) assess the most appropriate criteria for this wavelength on dental hard tissues. 4 groups of 5 teeth each (lower incisors, upper incisors, canines and molars) were irradiated with 6 powers and frequencies (0. 1 to 0. 4 W, in continuous or pulsed mode). The {{results of this study}} allow us to ensure that, in the chosen parameters, major powers, but delivered in pulsed manner, generate less temperature rise. Extremely {{significant differences were found between}} groups of lower incisors and molars. 0. 1 W power, pulsed mode for 20 msec, with 20 millisecond intervals, generated less than 4 Celsius degrees of temperature increase in all the cases studied. In conclusion, the use of powers of up to 0. 4 W, in pulsed mode, generated thermal effects of less than 4 Celsius degrees...|$|R
