50|$|One form is the Marx generator, after E. Marx {{who first}} {{proposed}} it in 1923. This consists of multiple capacitors that are first charged in parallel through charging resistors by a high-voltage, direct-current source and then connected in series and discharged through a test object by a simultaneous <b>spark-over</b> of the spark gaps. The impulse current generator comprises many capacitors {{that are also}} charged in parallel by a high-voltage, low-current, direct-current source, but it is discharged in parallel through resistances, inductances, and a test object by a spark gap.|$|E
40|$|Sulfur hexafluoride (SF 6) gas {{has become}} the most widely used gas {{insulator}} in high voltage equipment. But it has global warming effect. The search for alternative insulating gases is carried out all over the world. In order to use alternative gas for the circuit breaker, it is necessary to acquire the insulating property at high temperature. To study the property of insulating gases at high temperature, we use laser-produced plasma to simulate the arc discharge. The use of laser-produced plasma enables us to collect the experimental data easily via controlled eperiments. In this paper, we report the results of basic experiments carried out to verify the new experimental system. We have measured <b>spark-over</b> voltage, neutral gas density, and optical emission spectra of CO 2 and N 2. From the measurements, relationship among <b>spark-over</b> voltage, gas density, and temperature has been derived...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{results of}} measurements made using modern digital instrumentation to simultaneously record current pulses and visible images associated with corona discharges in a 8. 255 mm point-plane gap in atmospheric air with 50 Hz applied voltages up to flashover. Discharge current pulses are recorded at a sampling rate of 200 mega samples per second by a digital oscilloscope with an estimated 14 nsec time constant for the total measuring circuitry. The effect of a 0. 2 mm sheet of silicone rubber insulation placed {{over the surface of}} the plane electrode is also examined. Analysis of the current measurements provides new information about the formation of pulses particularly double-peaked types observed only occasionally by previous researchers. Photographs from a digital camera with extended UV capability show images of the corona produced for each type of discharge and atomic emission spectra of the corona are obtained up to and including <b>spark-over</b> with a high resolution digital spectrometer with a fiber optic probe, for wavelengths from 200 nm to 1100 nm with an accuracy of +/- 0. 25 nm...|$|E
40|$|The waste {{incineration}} plants, power generation utility, chemical industry, etc. require the efficient removal of submicrometer particles from raw gases. Wet electrostatic precipitators (WESP) {{are the most}} effective control device for fine aerosol from the humid raw gases. They use less energy than mechanical collection devices, have no moving parts to wear, their maintenance costs are lower, production downtime is minimized and WESP compact design allows the integration with wet scrubbers. But WESPs suffer with clogging problems due to build up of fine particles on the high voltage and collection electrodes leading to <b>spark-over</b> and loss of efficiency. Electrostatic precipitators also suffer with decreasing of collection efficiency when dealing with corona discharge suppression. These problems are overcome in a novel wet electrostatic precipitator developed in the Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe. The unit consists of a DC corona discharge ionizing stage and of an electric field-free grounded collector. The use of high gas velocities (over 20 m/s) in the nozzles of the ionizing stage minimizes the clogging of the high voltage electrodes with fine particles and diminishes the corona suppression in the zone of particle charging. By redesign of the plenum chamber between the high gas velocity ionizing stage and low gas velocit...|$|E
40|$|The {{degradation}} of high voltage electrical insulation {{is a prime}} factor that can significantly influence the reliability performance {{and the costs of}} maintaining high voltage electricity networks. Little information is known about the system of localized degradation from corona discharges on the relatively new silicone rubber sheathed composite insulators that are now being widely used in high voltage applications. This current work focuses on the fundamental principles of electrical corona discharge phenomena to provide further insights to where damaging surface discharges may localize and examines how these discharges may degrade the silicone rubber material. Although water drop corona has been identified by many authors as a major cause of deterioration of silicone rubber high voltage insulation until now no thorough studies have been made of this phenomenon. Results from systematic measurements taken using modern digital instrumentation to simultaneously record the discharge current pulses and visible images associated with corona discharges from between metal electrodes, metal electrodes and water drops, and between waters drops on the surface of silicone rubber insulation, using a range of 50 Hz voltages are inter compared. Visual images of wet electrodes show how water drops can play a part in encouraging flashover, and the first reproducible visual images of water drop corona at the triple junction of water air and silicone rubber insulation are presented. A study of the atomic emission spectra of the corona produced by the discharge from its onset up to and including <b>spark-over,</b> using a high resolution digital spectrometer with a fiber optic probe, provides further understanding of the roles of the active species of atoms and molecules produced by the discharge that may be responsible for not only for chemical changes of insulator surfaces, but may also contribute to the {{degradation of}} the metal fittings that support the high voltage insulators. Examples of real insulators and further work specific to the electrical power industry are discussed. A new design concept to prevent/reduce the damaging effects of water drop corona is also presented...|$|E
