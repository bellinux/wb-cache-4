50|$|The GTS {{of early}} 1990 was a limited run of 510 units for the New Zealand market. Powered by the base 3.8-Litre V6 engine {{it was based}} on the Executive model but {{featured}} upgrades including a body kit, 5-spoke alloy wheels and FE2 sports suspension (with upgraded <b>springs</b> <b>and</b> <b>stabiliser</b> bar for the front end and gas filled shocks absorbers at the back), larger front brake discs and master brake cylinder. The front suspension geometry was also modified to lower ride height by 35 mm for improved road handling. Inside, the car had power windows, central locking, electric antenna and four speaker radio cassette sound system. Suggested retail was $35,995 GTS and $37,295 GTS for the manual and automatic versions, respectively. It was available painted Vivid White or GTS Blue metallic (in Australia, Alpine White or Imperial Blue).|$|E
40|$|The paper {{exhibits}} {{the examination}} of life quality evaluation of helical coil springs in the railway industry as it impacts {{the safety of the}} transportation of goods and people. The types of spring considered are: the external <b>spring,</b> internal <b>spring</b> <b>and</b> <b>stabiliser</b> <b>spring.</b> Statistical process control was utilised as the fundamental instrument in the investigation. Measurements were performed using a measuring tape, dynamic actuators and the vernier caliper. The purpose of this research was to examine the usability of old helical springs found in a railway environment. The goal of the experiment was to obtain factual statistical information to determine the life quality of the helical springs used in the railroad transportation environment. Six sigma advocacies were additionally used as a part of this paper. According to six sigma estimation examination only the stabilizers <b>and</b> inner <b>springs</b> for coil bar diameter met the six sigma prerequisites. It is reasoned that the coil springs should be replaced as they do not meet the six sigma requirements...|$|R
5000|$|The UZZ32 {{was the top}} of {{the line}} 30 series, {{featuring}} all of the options available on the UZZ31 and the addition of four-wheel steering and a complex, computer-controlled hydraulic Toyota Active Control Suspension. This did away with conventional <b>springs</b> <b>and</b> anti-roll (<b>stabiliser)</b> bars in favour of hydraulic struts controlled by an array of sensors (such as yaw velocity sensors, vertical G sensors, height sensors, wheel speed sensors, longitudinal and lateral G sensors) that detected cornering, acceleration and braking forces.|$|R
50|$|It was {{a complex}} hydropneumatic, {{computer-controlled}} active suspension system. This {{did away with}} conventional <b>springs</b> <b>and</b> anti-roll (<b>stabiliser)</b> bars in favour of hydraulic struts controlled by an array of sensors (such as yaw velocity sensors, vertical G sensors, height sensors, wheel speed sensors, longitudinal and lateral G sensors) that detected cornering, acceleration and braking forces. The system worked well and gave an unusually controlled yet smooth ride with no body roll. However, the additional weight and power requirements of the system affected straight-line performance somewhat.|$|R

50|$|The chassis is a {{traditional}} ladder frame with a roll bar integrated into the windscreen frame and behind the driver. The RS 1000 has independent front and rear suspension, coil <b>springs,</b> <b>stabilisers</b> <b>and</b> drum brakes. The gearbox is a manual 5-speed; the clutch {{is the same as}} in the Barkas B 1000. A water-cooled 992 cm3 AWE353/1 engine is used. Unlike the Wartburg engine, it has three carburettors instead of only one and a higher compression ratio. Therefore it produces 51 kW at 4500 min−1 and gives a maximum torque of 118 N·m at 3500 min−1. Fibreglass was used as the body material. The top speed is 165 km/h.|$|R

50|$|Food {{industry}} applications have markedly increased {{since the}} 1960s. For example, its bland flavor has lent to its {{use as a}} carrier <b>and</b> <b>stabiliser</b> of aromas <b>and</b> pharmaceutical products. Lactose is not added directly to many foods, because its solubility is {{less than that of}} other sugars commonly used in food.

50|$|Sorbitan esters (also {{known as}} Spans) are {{nonionic}} surfactants {{that are used}} as emulsifying agents {{in the preparation of}} emulsions, creams, and ointments for pharmaceutical and cosmetic use. When used alone they produce stable water-in-oil emulsions but they are frequently used with a polysorbate in varying proportions to produce water-in-oil or oil-in-water emulsions or creams with a variety of different textures and consistencies. Sorbitan esters are also used as emulsifiers <b>and</b> <b>stabilisers</b> in food.|$|R

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{delineate}} {{the contribution of}} adaptations in agonist, antagonist <b>and</b> <b>stabiliser</b> muscle activation to changes in isometric and isoinertial lifting strength after short-term isoinertial resistance training (RT). Following familiarisation, 45 men (23. 2 ± 2. 8 yrs) performed maximal isometric and isoinertial strength tests of the elbow flexors of their dominant arm before and after three weeks of isoinertial RT. During these tasks surface EMG amplitude was recorded from the agonist (biceps brachii short and long heads), antagonist (triceps brachii lateral head) <b>and</b> <b>stabiliser</b> (anterior deltoid, pectoralis major) muscles and normalised to either Mmax (agonists) or to maximum EMG during relevant reference tasks (antagonist, stabilisers). After training {{there was more than}} a two-fold greater increase in training task specific isoinertial than isometric strength (17 vs. 7 %). There were also task specific adaptations in agonist EMG, with greater increases during the isoinertial than isometric strength task (ANOVA, training x task, P= 0. 005). A novel finding of this study was that training increased stabiliser muscle activation during all the elbow flexion strength tasks (P< 0. 001), although these were not task specific training effects. RT elicited specific neural adaptations to the training task that appeared to explain the greater increase in isoinertial than isometric strength...|$|R

40|$|A {{pilot study}} {{investigating}} {{the influence of}} vibration during press ups on myoelectrical activity of both dynamic <b>and</b> <b>stabiliser</b> muscles. Nine male participants (21. 1 ± 3. 4 years, 1. 68 ± 0. 03 m, 72. 3 ± 9. 5 kg), performed press ups under 3 conditions: without vibration, low amplitude and frequency vibration (30 L; 1. 2 mm, 30 Hz) high amplitude and frequency vibration (40 H; 1. 9 mm, 40 Hz). Press ups were completed in a randomised order {{for a period of}} 15 s with 3 min rest. 3 D motion capture with synchronous surface electromyography (EMG) of dynamic muscles (triceps, pectoralis major) <b>and</b> <b>stabiliser</b> muscles (serratus anterior, lower trapezius muscles). The introduction of vibration to press ups did not result in kinematic changes to exercises. No muscles analysed displayed significant increases in mean EMG amplitude in response to 30 L VIB in the eccentric or the concentric phase of the exercise. 40 H Vibration significantly increased EMG amplitudes of all muscles (p < 0. 05) except the lower trapezius. Greater increases were observed during the concentric phase of movement. These results indicate that vibration influences muscle activity during press up exercises. However, further studies are required including additional information such as the transmission of vibration to the neck and head, should be completed...|$|R
50|$|Compared to the Galant, {{there were}} changes to 70 {{percent of the}} car to create a car more suited to the Australian market. Roads, {{legislation}} and consumer preferences were all driving forces behind the changes. The rear of the floorpan had to be overhauled to accommodate a full-sized spare wheel, and superior rear side members were required to improve towing capabilities. Body rigidity was also improved to deal with Australian road conditions. The improved body stiffness resulted in better vehicle dynamics, which were also supported through the use of sophisticated suspension designs, new shock absorbers <b>and</b> <b>stabiliser</b> bars.|$|R
