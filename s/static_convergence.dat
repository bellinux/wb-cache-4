40|$|A simple {{structure}} is investigated {{within the framework}} of the software tool for Finite-Element-Analysis ANSYS. The structure represents the windtunnel model of the clean wing of a four-engined commercial airplane (AIRBUS-like planform). The external definition of the wing shape is loaded by fluid forces given in terms of pressure acting on the surface of the structure. The loads lead to a deflected structure which is equivalent to new boundaries for the fluid. Iteration of the scheme forms the static or transient solutions. The approach is still in the process of being developed, and the paper reflects the author's current state of research in this field.

40|$|A general {{finite element}} method is {{presented}} to solve the Euler equations in a Lagrangian reference frame. This FEM framework allows for separate arbitrarily high order representation of kinematic and thermodynamic variables. An accompanying hydrodynamics code written in Matlab {{is presented as a}} test-bed to experiment with various basis function choices. A wide range of basis function pairs are postulated and a few choices are developed further, including the bi-quadratic Q 2 -Q 1 d and Q 2 -Q 2 d elements. These are compared with a corresponding pair of low order bi-linear elements, traditional Q 1 -Q 0 and sub-zonal pressure Q 1 -Q 1 d. Several test problems are considered including <b>static</b> <b>convergence</b> tests, the acoustic wave hourglass test, the Sod shocktube, the Noh implosion problem, the Saltzman piston, and the Sedov explosion problem. High order methods are found to offer faster convergence properties, the ability to represent curved zones, sharper shock capturing, and reduced shock-mesh interaction. They also allow for the straightforward calculation of thermodynamic gradients (for multi-physics calculations) and second derivatives of velocity (for monotonic slope limiters), and are more computationally efficient. The issue of shock ringing remains unresolved, but the method of hyperviscosity has been identified as a promising means of addressing this. Overall, the curvilinear finite elements presented in this thesis show promise for integration in a full hydrodynamics code and warrant further consideration...|$|E

A standard analytical framework is presented which illustrates the importance of the components of the real interest differential - namely capital controls, risk premia and the real exchange rate - as endogenous mechanisms for the transmission of policy.

40|$|The aim of {{the book}} is to study some aspects of {{geometric}} evolutions, such as mean curvature flow and anisotropic mean curvature flow of hypersurfaces. We analyze the origin of such flows and their geometric and variational nature. Some of the most important aspects of mean curvature flow are described, such as the comparison principle and its use in the definition of suitable weak solutions. The anisotropic evolutions, which can be considered as a generalization of mean curvature flow, are studied from the view point of Finsler geometry. Concerning singular perturbations, we discuss the convergence of the Allen–Cahn (or Ginsburg–Landau) type equations to (possibly anisotropic) mean curvature flow before the onset of singularities in the limit problem. We study such kinds of asymptotic problems also in the <b>static</b> case, showing <b>convergence</b> to prescribed curvature-type problems...|$|R

The GHP contributes to specific GEWEX objectives such as determining the hydrological cycle and energy fluxes, modeling the global hydrological cycle and its impact, developing a capability to predict variations in global and regional hydrological processes and fostering the development of observing techniques, data management and assimilation systems. GHP activities include diagnosis, simulation and prediction of regional water balances by various process and modeling studies aimed at understanding and predicting the variability of the global water cycle, with an emphasis on regional coupled land-atmosphere processes in different climate regimes. This talk will provide an overview of past, present and future GHP efforts to develop a water and energy budget synthesis over the individual CSEs. For example, during summer, atmospheric water vapor, precipitation and evaporation as well as surface and atmospheric radiative heating increase and the dry <b>static</b> energy <b>convergence</b> decrease almost everywhere. We can further distinguish differences between hydrologic cycles in midlatitude and monsoon regions like the Amazon. The monsoon hydrologic cycle shows increased moisture convergence, soil moisture, runoff, but decreased sensible heating with increasing surface temperature.

40|$|A {{series of}} {{low-speed}} wind tunnel tests on a 70 -deg, sharp, leading-edge delta wing undergoing ramp pitching motion of high amplitude {{were performed to}} investigate the aerodynamic forces and moments. Forces and moments were obtained from a six-component interanl balance. Large amplitude oscillatory motion was produced by sinusoidally oscillating the model over a range of reduced frequencies. Ramp motion was produced by pitching the model through a half cycle of sinusoidal motion at a root chord Reynolds number of 1. 54 million. The effect of ramp and oscillatory motions on the forces and moments are almost identical at matched pitch rates. Pitch rate had strong effect on {{the magnitude of the}} aerodynamic forces and moments. Upon completion of the model motion, some time is required for the forces and moments to decay to their <b>static</b> values.

40|$|In {{the spirit}} of the Newtonian theory, we {{characterize}} spherically symmetric empty space in general relativity in terms of energy density measured by a <b>static</b> observer and <b>convergence</b> density experienced by null and timelike congruences. It turns out that space surrounding a static particle is entirely specified by vanishing of energy and null convergence density. The electrograv-dual$^{ 1 }$ to this condition would be vanishing of timelike and null convergence density which gives the dual-vacuum solution representing a Schwarzschild black hole with global monopole charge$^{ 2 }$ or with cloud of string dust$^{ 3 }$. Here the duality$^{ 1 }$ is defined by interchange of active and passive electric parts of the Riemann curvature, which amounts to interchange of the Ricci and Einstein tensors. This effective characterization of stationary vacuum works for the Schwarzschild and NUT solutions. The most remarkable feature of the effective characterization of empty space is that it leads to new dual spaces and the method can also be applied to lower and higher dimensions.

40|$|Seasonal {{change of}} the {{atmospheric}} heat energy budget in the Antarctic sea ice area in 60 °S- 70 °S latitudinal belt in 1988 is obtained from ERBE radiation data and ECMWF global atmospheric data. Seasonal {{change of the}} net radiation {{at the top of}} the atmosphere, temporal change rate of <b>static</b> energy, <b>convergences</b> of meridional heat energy transport, and the surface heat energy flux are analyzed. To obtain atmospheric heat transport, two methods of correction are adopted. Net radiation {{at the top of the}} atmosphere heats the atmosphere in December and January, and cools it in the rest of the year with a negative maximum of - 170 W/m^ 2. The temporal change rate of static energy is positive in the former half of the year and negative in the latter half. Its amplitude is much less than those of other components. Convergences of meridional heat energy transport are uncertain about the yearly averaged level, but their seasonal cycle has two maxima (minima) in April and August (May and October) in which the circumpolar trough is located in higher (lower) latitude and is deeper (shallower) with lag of ± 1 month. The surface heat energy flux which was obtained as a residual of other terms is maximum in May and minimum in December or January with amplitude of about 200 - 230 W/m^ 2. It takes positive values, at least, during 8 months of the year from March to October. The surface heat flux decreases 33 - 68 W/m^ 2 from May to July, by which time solar incidence is near zero. Change of cloud amount only cannot explain this reduction. Meanwhile, sea ice concentration increases from 33 % to 60 %. This increase of sea ice appears to affect to the change of the surface heat flux. In this area, there are few observational data that can be directly compared with the present result. However, by combining observational data and assumptions for radiation term and surface condition, our estimation for the surface heat flux is within the scattering of the observations in autumn...|$|R
40|$|We {{develop a}} {{multiscale}} model of ductile damage by void growth in general materials undergoing arbitrary deformations. The model is formulated {{in the spirit}} of multiscale finite element methods (FE 2), that is, the macroscopic behavior of the material is obtained by a simultaneous numerical evaluation of the response of a representative volume element. The representative microscopic model considered in this work consists of a space-filling assemblage of hollow spheres. Accordingly, we refer to the present model as the packed hollow sphere (PHS) model. A Ritz–Galerkin method based on spherical harmonics, specialized quadrature rules, and exact boundary conditions is employed to discretize individual voids at the microscale. This discretization results in material frame indifference, and it exactly preserves all material symmetries. The effective macroscopic behavior is then obtained by recourse to Hill's averaging theorems. The deformation and stress fields of the hollow spheres are globally kinematically and statically admissible regardless of material constitution and deformation history, which leads to exact solutions over the entire representative volume under <b>static</b> conditions. Excellent <b>convergence</b> and scalability properties of the PHS model are demonstrated through convergence analyses and examples of application. We also illustrate the broad range of material behaviors that are captured by the PHS model, including elastic and plastic cavitation and the formation of a vertex in the yield stress of porous metals at low triaxiality. This vertex allows ductile damage to occur under shear-dominated conditions, thus overcoming a well-known deficiency of Gurson's model...|$|R
40|$|The {{simulation}} of Arctic cloud cover and {{the sensitivity of}} Arctic climate to cloud changes are investigated using an atmosphere–mixed-layer ocean GCM (GENESIS 2). The model is run with and without changes in three-dimensional cloud fraction under 2 3 CO 2 radiative forcing. This model was chosen {{in part because of}} its relatively successful representation of modern Arctic cloud cover, a trait attributable to the parameterized treatment of mixed-phase microphysics. Simulated modern Arctic cloud fraction is insensitive to model biases in surface boundary conditions (SSTs and sea ice distribution), but the modeled Arctic climate is sensitive to high-frequency cloud variability. When forced with increased CO 2 the model generally simulates more (less) vertically integrated cloudiness in high (low) latitudes. In the simulation without cloud feedbacks, cloud fraction is fixed at its modern control value at all grid points and all levels while CO 2 is doubled. Compared with this fixed-cloud experiment, the simulated cloud changes enhance greenhouse warming at all latitudes, accounting for one-third of the global warming signal. This positive feedback is most pronounced in the Arctic, where approximately 40 % of the warming is due to cloud changes. The strong cloud feedback in the Arctic is caused not only by local processes but also by cloud changes in lower latitudes, where positive top-of-the-atmosphere cloud radiative forcing anomalies are larger. The extra radiative energy gained in lower latitudes is transported dynamically to the Arctic via moist <b>static</b> energy flux <b>convergence.</b> The results presented here demonstrate the importance of remote impacts from low and midlatitudes for Arctic climate change. 1...|$|R
40|$|We {{observed}} a meso-γ-scale convective system in July 2007 using a 443 -MHz wind profiler radar (WPR) with a radio acoustic sounding system (RASS) at the NICT Ogimi observatory in Okinawa, Japan. We analyzed the virtual temperature, Tv, the Brunt–Vaisala frequency squared, N 2, and three components of wind velocity profiles from the WPR-RASS data. We also employed a non-hydrostatic meso-scale (NHM) numerical model. Although {{the island of}} Okinawa {{was covered with a}} Pacific high-pressure system from 21 – 26 July, the atmospheric condition was convectively unstable below about 5 km. A number of convective clouds generally appeared from 11 : 00 – 18 : 00 in local time (i. e., Japan Standard Time; JST) with a typical horizontal scale of 10 km and temporal scale of 40 – 60 min. We focused on the convective system that passed over the Ogimi radar site on 23 rd and 25 th July. Just before rain occurred on these days, a low N 2 region extended upward to 2. 0 km, and this characteristics is also commonly seen around a convective cloud in the NHM model. The cloud water content from the NHM model indicated that the cloud top height correlates with the low N 2 structure. Before the convective system was generated, N 2 decreased below an altitude of about 1 km, because air with low Tv intruded at 1 – 3 km, and the surface temperature increased due to solar radiation. The sea-breeze from both the east and west coasts of Okinawa collided to force the convergence below 1 km. Thus, the synergetic effects of the low <b>static</b> stability and <b>convergence</b> seemed to trigger the generation of a convective system, which eventually grew to 11 km over the radar site...|$|R
