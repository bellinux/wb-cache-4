40|$|<b>Stretching</b> is a {{stimulation}} of muscle growth. <b>Stretching</b> for hours or days {{has an effect}} on muscle hypertrophy. However, differences of continuous <b>stretching</b> and repetitive <b>stretching</b> to affect muscle growth are not well known. To clarify the difference of continuous and repetitive <b>stretching</b> within a short duration, we investigated the gene expression of muscle-related genes on <b>stretched</b> skeletal muscles. We used 8 -week-old male Wistar rats () for this study. Animals medial gastrocnemius muscle was <b>stretched</b> continuously or repetitively for 15 [*]min daily and 4 times/week under anesthesia. After <b>stretching,</b> muscles were removed and total RNA was extracted. Then, reverse transcriptional quantitative real-time PCR was done to evaluate the mRNA expression of MyoD, myogenin, and embryonic myosin heavy chain (MyHC). Muscles, either <b>stretched</b> continuously or repetitively, increased mRNA expression of MyoD, myogenin, and embryonic MyHC more than unstretched muscles. Notably, repetitive <b>stretching</b> resulted in more substantial effects on embryonic MyHC gene expression than continuous <b>stretching.</b> In conclusion, passive <b>stretching</b> for a short duration within a week is effective in increasing myogenic factor expression, and repetitive <b>stretching</b> had more effects than continuous <b>stretching</b> for skeletal muscle on muscle growth.

The athletes were randomly allocated into two groups: static <b>stretching</b> or dynamic <b>stretching.</b> All of them underwent an initial evaluation and were submitted to the first intervention.

The results analyzed using ANOVA showed that there was a significant decrease in agility time after dynamic <b>stretching</b> against no <b>stretching</b> in the acute phase; but, there were no significant differences between dynamic <b>stretching</b> and no <b>stretching</b> in the chronic phase.
