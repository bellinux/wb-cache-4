5|$|An {{orangutan}} {{has a large}}, bulky body, a thick neck, very long, <b>strong</b> <b>arms,</b> short, bowed legs, and no tail. It {{is mostly}} covered with long, reddish-brown hair and grey-black skin. Sumatran orangutans have more sparse and lighter-coloured coats. The orangutan has a large head with a prominent mouth area. Though largely hairless, their faces can develop some hair in males, giving them a moustache.|$|E
5|$|Although most {{researchers}} now consider Heterodontosaurus a bipedal runner, some earlier studies proposed a partial or fully quadrupedal locomotion. In 1980, Santa Luca described several {{features of the}} forelimb that are also present in recent quadrupedal animals and imply a strong arm musculature: these include a large olecranon (a bony eminence forming the uppermost part of the ulna), enlarging the lever arm of the forearm. The medial epicondyle of the humerus was enlarged, providing attachment sites for strong flexor muscles of the forearm. Furthermore, projections on the claws might have increased the forward thrust of the hand during walking. According to Santa Luca, Heterodontosaurus was quadrupedal when moving slowly but was able {{to switch to a}} much faster, bipedal run. Polish palaeontologists Teresa Maryańska and Halszka Osmólska supported Santa Luca's hypothesis in 1985; furthermore, they noted that the dorsal spine was strongly flexed downwards in the most completely known specimen. In 1987, Gregory S. Paul suggested that Heterodontosaurus might have been obligatorily quadrupedal, and that these animals would have galloped for fast locomotion. David Weishampel and Lawrence Witmer in 1990 as well as Norman and colleagues in 2004 argued in favour of exclusively bipedal locomotion, based on the morphology of the claws and shoulder girdle. The anatomical evidence suggested by Santa Luca was identified as adaptations for foraging; the robust and <b>strong</b> <b>arms</b> might have been used for digging up roots and breaking open insect nests.|$|E

500|$|The Simpsons fourteenth {{season was}} {{originally}} broadcast on the Fox {{network in the}} United States between November 3, 2002 and May 18, 2003. The show runner for the fourteenth production season was Al Jean, who executive produced 21 of 22 episodes. The other episode, [...] "How I Spent My Strummer Vacation", was run by Mike Scully. The season contains five hold-overs from the previous season's production run. The fourteenth season has met with mostly positive reviews and won two Primetime Emmy Awards, including Outstanding Animated Program (For Programming less than One Hour), four Annie Awards and a Writers Guild of America Award. On December 6, 2011, it was released on DVD and Blu-ray in North America. This season contains the show's 300th episode, [...] "The <b>Strong</b> <b>Arms</b> of The Ma".|$|E

According to Ben Rayner of the Toronto Star, [...] "It's {{very difficult to}} find a straight answer why milestone status has been bestowed on [...] Some rationalize that the 300 figure doesn't account for two early holiday specials, Fox maintains that there was some discrepancy between the original, scheduled broadcast date- {{deep in the heart of}} the ratings-mad February sweeps- and the number of episodes that were eventually aired leading up to it." [...] "Barting Over" [...] refers to the error when Marge tells Lisa [...] "I can't count the number of times (Homer) has done something crazy like this."

2500|$|The Forge emphasises the muscularity of the men, who are {{rendered}} as classically heroic with thick, <b>strong</b> <b>arms</b> {{and heavy}} masculine backs. Yet their faces indicate a coarseness of temperament—a device likely {{used to make}} them more identifiable to the common man. The figures are likely intended to represent the working class of the 19th-century Spain—hammering out {{the future of the country}} in a literal allegory to the then-popular saying [...] "on the anvil of history". In this way, the work evokes the imagery of resistance to the French threat from Napoleon, earlier examined by Goya in his 1808 painting The Knife Grinder, and may refer to the peoples' participation in drafting the Constitution. Though a court painter, Goya was sensitive throughout his life to the plight of common men. He often captured their everyday lives, usually emphasising the dignity of work or the suffering of war.|$|E
2500|$|The biographer Peter Washington {{described}} Blavatsky as [...] "a short, stout, forceful woman, with <b>strong</b> <b>arms,</b> several chins, unruly hair, {{a determined}} mouth, and large, liquid, slightly bulging eyes". She had distinctive azure colored eyes, and struggled with obesity throughout her life. According to the biographer Marion Meade, Blavatsky's [...] "general appearance was outrageously untidy". In later life, {{she was known}} for wearing loose robes, and wore many rings on her fingers. She was a heavy cigarette smoker throughout her life, and was known for smoking hashish at times. She lived simply and her followers believed that she refused to accept monetary payment in return for disseminating her teachings. Blavatsky preferred to be known by the acronym [...] "HPB", a sobriquet applied to her by many of her friends which was first developed by Olcott. She avoided social functions and was scornful of social obligations. She spoke Russian, Georgian, English, French, Italian, Arabic, and Sanskrit.|$|E
