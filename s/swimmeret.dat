5000|$|The term {{command neuron}} first {{appeared}} in a 1964 paper [...] "Interneurons Commanding <b>Swimmeret</b> Movements in the Crayfish" [...] by CAG Wiersma and K Ikeda in volume 12 of Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology vol 12 on pp 509-525. Wiersma and Ikeda used the term to describe how a single action potential {{in any of the}} four giant fibers that run along the dorsal margin of the crayfish nerve cord caused the crayfish to execute a tail-flip escape response. This concept came to epitomize the general neurobiological principle that complex information can be encoded on the level of individual neurons. Soon, researchers were finding command neurons in multiple invertebrate and vertebrate species, including: crickets, cockroaches, lobsters, and certain fish.|$|E

50|$|The {{members of}} the Euphausiacea are {{commonly}} called krill and are all marine shrimp-like species whose pleopods (abdominal appendages) function as <b>swimmerets.</b> They swarm and mostly feed on plankton. This group is composed of only 90 species, {{some of which are}} the most abundant species on the planet; in fact, it is estimated that the biomass of the Antarctic krillEuphausia superba is 500 million tons.|$|R
5000|$|P. argus have long, {{cylindrical}} bodies {{covered with}} spines. Two large spines form forward-pointing [...] "horns" [...] above the eyestalks. They are generally olive greenish or brown, {{but can be}} tan to mahogany. There is a scattering of yellowish to cream-colored spots on the carapace and larger (usually four to six) yellow to cream-colored spots on the abdomen. They have no claws (pincers). The first pair of antennae are slender, black or dark brown and biramous. The second pair of antennae are longer than the body, and covered with forward pointing spines. The bases of the second antennae are thick, can have a bluish tinge, and are likewise covered with rows of spines. The legs are usually striped longitudinally with blue and yellow and terminate in a single spine-like point. The somites of the abdomen are smooth and have a shallow furrow across the middle. Each has pairs of <b>swimmerets</b> on the underside that are yellow and black. The lobes of the tail are colored similarly to the <b>swimmerets.</b>|$|R
40|$|International audienceInfluence {{of walking}} on <b>swimmeret</b> beating in intact lobsters, Homarus gammarus, has been {{analyzed}} using a treadmill experimental device. Belt movement activates both leg stepping and <b>swimmeret</b> beating. The simultaneity of {{the onset of}} the two motor systems in this situation is demonstrated {{to be the result of}} a startle response initiated when the belt begins to move. This reaction consists of a non-specific motor activity involving several antagonist postural and dynamic muscles. Abdominal extension and vigorous <b>swimmeret</b> beating are the main features of this reaction. The main characteristics of the <b>swimmeret</b> beating as defined by Davis (1969) has been observed here in sequences without walking. However during long walking sequences a very different <b>swimmeret</b> beating pattern occurs. It is suggested that this slow <b>swimmeret</b> beating is completely subordinate to the walking rhythm during sequences of absolute coordination. In more rapid <b>swimmeret</b> beating a relative coordination with leg stepping is very common. The functional meaning of this linkage between legs and swimmerets is discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{crustacean}} red pigment concentrating hormone (RPCH) {{has been}} localized in neurons of the crayfish abdominal nerve cord and modulates the crayfish <b>swimmeret</b> rhythm. An antibody to RPCH labels a small set of cell bodies and axons in each abdominal ganglion. Physiological experiments in which RPCH was perfused into the ganglia of isolated nerve cords showed that RPCH modulated the <b>swimmeret</b> rhythm. In nerve cords that were spontaneously producing the <b>swimmeret</b> rhythm, RPCH lengthened both the {{period and the}} duration of bursts of action potentials, but did not alter the phase relationships between bursts in different segments. RPCH did not initiate the <b>swimmeret</b> rhythm in preparations that showed intermittent or no bursting activity. We believe that RPCH is released as a neurotransmitter in the lateral neuropil, where it exerts its effects on the local <b>swimmeret</b> circuits...|$|E
40|$|The {{branching}} {{patterns and}} {{profiles of the}} main sensory nerves of the swimmerets of Cher ax destructor are described. The innervation is generally {{similar to that in}} Pacifastacus but there are important differences that may be due to species variation or that may explain apparent differences in the physiology of the two species. The two large axons from the long strand of the stretch-receptor complex in Cherax give rise to non-spiking signals whereas those from the short strand are not active during passive protraction and retraction of the <b>swimmeret.</b> The rhythmic movements of one <b>swimmeret</b> are sufficient to entrain the fictive <b>swimmeret</b> rhythm of an otherwise deafferented ventral nerve cord. The para-meters of this entrainment match those of the known reflexes associated with <b>swimmeret</b> movement. Ablation experiments show that the stretch-receptor complex is necessary and sufficient for this entrainment and that input from the pleural plate hairs and <b>swimmeret</b> hairs is not required. Sinusoidal current injection into the non-spiking stretch receptors can also entrain the fictive rhythm of the deafferented cord. From these results it is argued that the non-spiking stretch receptors play an important part in stabilizing and adjusting the frequency of the <b>swimmeret</b> rhythm. The <b>swimmeret</b> system is therefore another example of patterned motor output generated by a distributed, multicomponent network and this may be a general feature of cyclically rhythmic systems...|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{hypothesized}} that the tail flip is derived from an ancient limb protraction driven (as opposed to tail flexion-driven) mechanism. This is because the SGs appear to be modified limb motor neurons whose peripheral axons affect the legs and <b>swimmerets,</b> but end blindly without any known function. It is known that another effect of Giant Fiber excitation is limb promotion {{which suggests that the}} premotor limb interneurons may be ancestors of the Giant Fibers.|$|R
2500|$|The {{bodies of}} {{crustaceans}} are segmented; {{there is one}} ganglion (cluster of nerve cells) per segment. Each ganglion receives sensory and movement information via nerves coming from the muscles, body wall, and appendages such as walking legs, <b>swimmerets</b> and mouthparts. The ganglia show great functional autonomy; information received by the ganglion is processed by the same ganglion, enabling a faster response than if the message had to travel {{all the way up}} the animal's body to the brain and then back. [...] Information can be exchanged between ganglia enabling the animal to perform coordinated movements.|$|R
50|$|Pleopods (also called <b>swimmerets)</b> are {{primarily}} swimming legs, {{and are also}} used for brooding the eggs (except in prawns), catching food (then swept to the mouth), and can sometimes bear their own gills. In some taxa, the first one or two pairs of pleopods are specialised in the males for fertilisation, and {{are referred to as}} the gonopods. At the end of the pleon is the tail fan, comprising a pair of biramous uropods and the telson, which bears the anus. Together, they are used for steering while swimming, and in the caridoid escape reaction.|$|R

40|$|Animal {{locomotion}} {{is driven}} by cyclic movements of the body or body appendages. These movements are {{under the control of}} neural networks that are driven by central pattern generators (CPG). In order to produce meaningful behavior, CPGs need to be coordinated. The crayfish <b>swimmeret</b> system is a model to investigate the coordination of distributed CPGs. Swimmerets are four pairs of limbs on the animal’s abdomen, which move in cycles of alternating power-strokes and return-strokes. The <b>swimmeret</b> pairs are coordinated in a metachronal wave from posterior to anterior with a phase lag of approximately 25...|$|E
25|$|Lobster anatomy {{includes}} the cephalothorax which fuses {{the head and}} the thorax, {{both of which are}} covered by a chitinous carapace, and the abdomen. The lobster's head bears antennae, antennules, mandibles, the first and second maxillae, and the first, second, and third maxillipeds. Because lobsters live in murky environments {{at the bottom of the}} ocean, they mostly use their antennae as sensors. The lobster eye has a reflective structure above a convex retina. In contrast, most complex eyes use refractive ray concentrators (lenses) and a concave retina. The abdomen includes <b>swimmerets</b> and its tail is composed of uropods and the telson.|$|R
25|$|The {{anterior}} five {{segments of}} the crayfish house the massive flexor and extensor muscles. Six abdominal ganglia run down {{the entire length of}} the abdomen and communicate with one another through projections. The first five abdominal segments each have their own ganglion, that contains three roots with outward projections. The first has mixed sensory and motor nerves innervating <b>swimmerets</b> while the second has sensory and motor neurons that innervate the extensor muscles, while the third root contains only motor neuron projections that extend into the flexor muscles. The last segment contains the fusion of two ganglia. The ganglia here also receive sensory input from the sensitive hairs on the tail fan.|$|R
2500|$|Shrimp are {{swimming}} crustaceans {{with long}} narrow muscular abdomens and long antennae. Unlike crabs and lobsters, shrimp have well developed pleopods (<b>swimmerets)</b> and slender walking legs; {{they are more}} adapted for swimming than walking. Historically, it was the distinction between walking and swimming that formed the primary taxonomic division into the former suborders Natantia and Reptantia. Members of the Natantia (shrimp in the broader sense) were adapted for swimming while the Reptantia (crabs, lobsters, etc.) were adapted for crawling or walking. Some other groups also have common names that include the word [...] "shrimp"; any small swimming crustacean resembling a shrimp tends to be called one.|$|R
40|$|Many {{behavior}} {{patterns of the}} crayfish involve the positioning of the abdomen by the tonic motor system. Movements and positionings of the swimmerets are coordinated with these abdominal movements. Evidence from extracellular analyses suggested that single interneurons of the abdominal nerve cord could produce motor outputs in both the <b>swimmeret</b> and the abdominal positioning systems. Our intracellular investigation has revealed that many single cells can evoke outputs in both motor systems. Interneurons which produced fictive extension or flexion of the abdomen or inhibition of abdominal movement were also able to modulate a variety of <b>swimmeret</b> behavior including cyclic beating and excitation or inhibition of episodic outputs. Although interneurons were dis-covered that evoked each of the possible classes of dual-output combinations, those that evoked combinations frequently observed in the freely behaving animal were more common than those that evoked infrequently observed combinations. Evidence also indicated that abdominal positioning inhibitors are present in greater numbers than previously suspected and that many are {{closely associated with the}} <b>swimmeret</b> circuitry. Interneurons with the ability to start and stop <b>swimmeret</b> cyclic outputs with current injections of opposite polarity are proposed to be higher-order cells, and some are shown to have the properties of trigger neurons. It is proposed that most dual-output cells are presynaptic to single-output cells and that groups of related dual-output cells may function together as command elements...|$|E
40|$|A {{machine was}} used to impose {{controlled}} movements, closely resembling natural movements, {{on some of the}} swimmerets of crayfish with their ventral nerve cords cut between thorax and abdomen. The rhythm of the unrestrained swimmerets could be entrained to the imposed frequency. Full entrainment occurred most readily when three or four swimmerets were controlled and was uncommon with two. When one was controlled, only partial entrainment was seen. A small proportion of preparations could not be entrained irrespective of the number of swimmerets controlled. Entrainment of the neural rhythm also occurred when movement was imposed on one or more swimmerets attached to an otherwise isolated nerve cord. This is the first demonstration that sensory input affects the periodicity of the <b>swimmeret</b> rhythm. In the light of this result, the hypothesis that <b>swimmeret</b> rhythm is largely controlled by a central pattern generator should be viewed with caution. It now appears that there is also an influential sensory component responsible for stabilizing and adjusting the timing of the <b>swimmeret</b> rhythm...|$|E
40|$|The {{anatomy and}} {{physiology}} of the segmental giant (SG) of the crayfish Pacifastacus leniusculus is described. The peripheral axon of the SG terminates in the 1 st root near {{the base of the}} <b>swimmeret,</b> and has no direct target organ. There is a tuft of fine dendritic branches in the lateral neuropile where the SG axon has its smallest diameter. The central region of the SG has a conduction velocity of l- 3 ms~ ', a length constant of 0 - 4 — 0 - 7 mm and an input resistance greater than 1 - 8 MQ. Dual microelectrode penetrations of pre- and postsynaptic neurones confirm that the SG receives input from the giant fibres through rectifying electrical synapses, and excites the fast flexor motor neurones of the abdomen, also through electrical synapses. The SG also excites a variety of <b>swimmeret</b> motor neurones, including power- and return-stroke classes. Attention is drawn to the similarity in anatomy between the SG and return-stroke <b>swimmeret</b> motor neurones, and a possible evolutionary explanation for the existence of the SG is proposed...|$|E

40|$|In crayfish, the {{movement}} of each <b>swimmeret</b> is monitored {{by a pair of}} nonspiking stretch receptors (NSR) with central somata and dendrites that are embedded in an elastic strand {{at the base of the}} appendage. I provide evidence that the neuropile segments of these primary sensory neurones receive synaptic input from the hemiganglionic central pattern generator for the <b>swimmeret.</b> In nonbursting isolated abdominal nerve cords of Pacifastacus leniusculus Dana, the membrane potentials of the NSRs (recorded in the neuropile) are stable; whenever the central pattern generator is active, they oscillate in phase with the motor output. Every perturbation of the central pattern generator's activity is precisely reflected in analogous changes (in phase and/or amplitude) of the NSRs ' oscillations. This activity must arise via central, synaptic input to the NSRs, because it occurs when all ganglia except the sixth are deafferented. Lucifer Yellow dye-fills show that the neurites of the NSRs are confined to the ipsilateral lateral neuropile, which is the region of the hemiganglion where <b>swimmeret</b> functions are integrated. These results imply that during rhythmic beating of the swimmerets, the NSRs receive an efference copy of the motor output to the limb whose movements they monitor. In vivo, therefore, the incoming sensory signal must be subject to modulation (gating) by the limb's central pattern generator...|$|E
40|$|A {{fundamental}} {{challenge in}} neuroscience {{is to understand}} how biologically salient motor behaviors emerge from properties of the underlying neural circuits. Crayfish, krill, prawns, lobsters, and other long-tailed crustaceans swim by rhythmically moving limbs called swimmerets. Over the entire biological range of animal size and paddling frequency, movements of adjacent swimmerets maintain an approximate quarter-period phase difference with the more posterior limbs leading the cycle. We use a computational fluid dynamics model to show that this frequency-invariant stroke pattern {{is the most effective}} and mechanically efficient paddling rhythm across the full range of biologically relevant Reynolds numbers in crustacean swimming. We then show that the organization of the neural circuit underlying <b>swimmeret</b> coordination provides a robust mechanism for generating this stroke pattern. Specifically, the wave-like limb coordination emerges robustly from a combination of the half-center structure of the local central pattern generating circuits (CPGs) that drive the movements of each limb, the asymmetric network topology of the connections between local CPGs, and the phase response properties of the local CPGs, which we measure experimentally. Thus, the crustacean <b>swimmeret</b> system serves as a concrete example in which the architecture of a neural circuit leads to optimal behavior in a robust manner. Furthermore, we consider all possible connection topologies between local CPGs and show that the natural connectivity pattern generates the biomechanically optimal stroke pattern most robustly. Given the high metabolic cost of crustacean swimming, our results suggest that natural selection has pushed the <b>swimmeret</b> neural circuit toward a connection topology that produces optimal behavior...|$|E

The pseudometanauplius stage is exclusive to the so-called [...] "sac-spawners". Until the metanauplius stage, the larvae are reliant on the yolk reserves, but from the calyptopsis stage, they begin to feed on phytoplankton. During the furcilia stages, segments with pairs of <b>swimmerets</b> are added, beginning at the frontmost segments, with each new pair only becoming functional at the next moult.
