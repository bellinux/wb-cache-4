50|$|A similar {{process is}} used in the salmon-farming section of this industry; juveniles are taken from {{hatcheries}} and a variety of methods are used to aid them in their maturation. For example, as stated above, {{some of the most important}} fish species in the industry, salmon, can be grown using a cage system. This is done by having netted cages, preferably in open water that has a strong flow, and feeding the salmon a special food mixture that aids their growth. This process allows for year-round growth of the fish, thus a higher harvest during the correct seasons. An additional method, known sometimes as <b>sea</b> <b>ranching,</b> has also been used within the industry. <b>Sea</b> <b>ranching</b> involves raising fish in a hatchery for a brief time and then releasing them into marine waters for further development, whereupon the fish are recaptured when they have matured.|$|E
50|$|Enhanced Stocking (also {{known as}} <b>sea</b> <b>ranching)</b> is a Japanese {{principle}} based on operant conditioning and the migratory nature of certain species. The fishermen raise hatchlings in a closely knitted net in a harbor, sounding an underwater horn before each feeding. When {{the fish are}} old enough they are freed from the net to mature in the open sea. During spawning season, about 80% of these fish return to their birthplace. The fishermen sound the horn and then net those fish that respond.|$|E
50|$|The Japanese sea {{cucumber}} is also cultivated {{on a commercial}} scale in shallow ponds and by <b>sea</b> <b>ranching</b> in northern China, where production reached 5,865 tonnes in 2002.

Hatchery techniques are being developed in Japan and China as are the preparation of suitable culture feeds and the investigation of the best methods of ranching. Albino forms and a thermally resistant strain that is less prone to aestivate are being developed in China.|$|E

50|$|<b>Sea</b> <b>ranching</b> {{is carried}} out in {{sheltered}} bays with seagrass in areas with few predators. The sea cucumbers can be kept in pens in shallow water made of fine wire mesh or bamboo, and in deeper water they are raised in cages made from fine woven mesh or in tub enclosures on the seafloor. They can also be kept and grown in ponds with appropriate water exchange and movement. Individual growth is density-dependent and is stunted at high densities. Monitoring water quality and growth characteristics are essential to survival during this phase. Sea cucumbers are ready to harvest after 12 months of grow out.|$|E
50|$|Research {{has been}} {{undertaken}} into the reproduction and {{life cycle of}} Holothuria spinifera {{with a view to}} breeding it commercially for aquaculture or for <b>sea</b> <b>ranching.</b> In a study in India, several adults were caught by hand and placed in a tank. Spawning took place spontaneously with a male liberating sperm in a white strand. A female responded by producing a spurt of eggs that were fertilized in the water column. The larvae were pelagic and developed rapidly, being fed on microalgae for the first ten days. For the next four days they passed through the non-feeding, barrel-shaped, doliolaria stage and moved about in the tank. They then settled on the bottom and underwent metamorphosis into pentactula larvae with five short tentacles at the front and two tube feet at the back. By day twenty, the tentacles and feet were more distinct and the first thorny protuberances were visible on the body. In the study, mortality of the larvae was about 95%, but this high rate was partly due to predation by copepods which the researchers were unable to eliminate from the tank. Other studies have investigated how best to stimulate spawning and the optimum conditions of temperature, pH and salinity for rearing the larvae, the best diet to feed and how to stimulate them to settle.|$|E

40|$|Mariculture {{production}} in Japan has grown recently to nearly one million tons per year. Mariculture {{production in}} the shallow coastal waters of Japan mainly consists of eight species of finfish, six species of shellfish, and three species of algae. Kuruma shrimp culture techniques are highly developed. Nevertheless, only 1, 800 tons of kuruma shrimp can be produced yearly. There is a demand for this species but culture grounds have become limited {{and there is not}} enough space to raise shrimp. In 1980, 600 million postlarvae were produced but one-half had to be released to the sea. The released shrimp that survived and grew have formed a new basis for the "Sea Ranching Fisheries" industry. The trial releases of postlarvae have proven that <b>sea</b> <b>ranching</b> of shrimp can be successful. To strengthen the foundation of <b>sea</b> <b>ranching</b> fisheries, there must be future research on ecological impact, as well as on physico-chemical water parameters. The life cycle, feeding habits, and predators of the shrimp must also be studied.

40|$|<b>Sea</b> <b>ranching</b> of lobster is a {{sustainable}} alternative to mere fishing. The method involves releasing hatchery-reared juveniles into their natural environment, usually at a geographically delimited area. With this {{addition to the}} native populations one hopes to raise the overall numbers of specimens and increase the catching rates and financial gain. Being small the juvenile lobsters are amongst {{the lower levels of}} the food chain. Predators are abundant all year round making the release process a dangerous affair. But the young lobsters size is not only a disadvantage {{when it comes to the}} food chain hierarchy; ocean dynamics such as currents may largely contribute to the dispersal, transporting the lobster miles away from the <b>sea</b> <b>ranching</b> site. These are amongst some challenges that if solved will increase the benefits of <b>sea</b> <b>ranching.</b> This thesis had the aim of addressing these problems and try to enhance the process focusing on release strategies. A literature survey was conducted to gain knowledge on ecology and behaviour of the European lobster Homarus gammarus and to get familiar with the practise of <b>sea</b> <b>ranching</b> by reviewing previous experiences and improvement suggestions. Based on previous research several biological models of juvenile lobster behaviour were made. These were incorporated with the fine-scale hydrodynamic model SINMOD to look at spatio-temporal spreading patterns. The simulated releases were conducted at a specific site with environmental data from the period of May 1. - May 14. 2012. Simulation data were analyzed in terms of biological model used, time of day and flow fields. Results reveled that the lobsters vertical placement in the water column (depth) is most influential in terms of the amount of current induced transport. Because of the scarce amount of conclusive information on lobster behaviour, no immediate conclusion could be drawn. Some suggestions however were made based on the knowledge gathered. Releasing of older stage IV juveniles, or stage V juveniles is encouraged as more lobsters will settle at the <b>sea</b> <b>ranching</b> site. Releases should be conducted at night due to predators impaired vision in darkness...|$|E

40|$|Marine stock {{enhancement}} {{is a set}} {{of management}} approaches involving the release of cultured organisms to enhance or restore fisheries. Such practices, including <b>sea</b> <b>ranching,</b> stock enhancement, and restocking, are widespread, of variable success, and often controversial.

Fisheries science and management, in general, and many aspects of fisheries enhancement have developed rapidly since the responsible approach was first formulated. Here we provide an update to the Responsible Approach in light of these developments. The updated approach emphasizes the need for taking a broad and integrated view of the role of enhancements within fisheries management systems; using a stakeholder participatory and scientifically informed, accountable planning process; and assessing the potential contribution of enhancement and alternative or additional measures to fisheries management goals early on in the development or reform process. Progress in fisheries assessment methods applicable to enhancements and in fisheries governance provides the means for practical implementation of the updated approach...|$|E

40|$|The {{growing number}} of {{countries}} investigating the potential for releasing cultured juveniles to augment coastal fisheries resulted in the First International Symposium on Stock Enhancement and <b>Sea</b> <b>Ranching</b> (ISSESR) in Norway in 1997.
