30|$|The ESE {{was used}} to {{position}} and control the roll up of tubes from strained InGaAs/GaAs bilayers. The patterning allowed us to create well-defined <b>starting</b> <b>edges</b> suitable for the illumination experiment (as in Fig. 1). By cleverly integrating this process, one can obtain both etched regions with rolled-up layers and unetched regions within a small area on the sample. Furthermore, this technique is useful for applications since, during the ES, the structures remain unchanged other than the “blocking” at the <b>starting</b> <b>edge.</b>|$|R

30|$|We {{believe that}} for the ESE found in samples etched with HF for shorter times under {{illumination}} levels close to the threshold value from Fig. 2, the strained bilayer remains intact because the sacrificial layer was not underetched at the <b>starting</b> <b>edge,</b> which may happen through the accumulation of solid As and As oxide following from a photochemical interaction at the GaAs surface {{in the presence of}} HF.|$|R

30|$|Here, the {{experiments}} were performed using 20 nm In 0.33 Ga 0.66 As/ 20 nm GaAs structures on AlAs grown on (001) GaAs substrates by molecular beam epitaxy, where {{the thickness of}} the AlAs was varied from 4 to 20 nm. For experiments pertaining to the measurement of the onset of the etch suppression and rolling distance, the <b>starting</b> <b>edges</b> were defined by mechanical scratching, whereas photolithography and wet chemical etching (by H 3 PO 4 :H 2 O 2 :H 2 O solution) were used for controlling the etch suppression. Our specially designed setup involved an HF-resistant trough for etching with HF under light focused by a Zeiss optical microscope using different objective lenses of 5 × through 50 × magnification (for sample evolution during this process, see Fig. 1 a and b). Other measurements were performed using illumination from a HeNe laser with maximum output power of 2 mW, as well as a laser with adjustable power (up to 20 mW) and wavelength (535 – 825 nm) with focusing optics or an optical fiber to illuminate the surface of the sample. For all measurements, the intensity of illumination was measured beforehand using a calibrated power meter. For samples that were etched, illuminated, and observed under the microscope, the settings on the illumination dial were used and the focused spot sizes for each magnification were assumed to be the same. For the quantitative measurements of tube rolling distance, optical images of the sample outside of solution once the etching was terminated were taken. From these images, the rolling distance could then be measured, which we define as distance from the <b>starting</b> <b>edge</b> {{to the center of the}} tube width, assumed to correspond to the stopping point of the underetching.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Through {{the set up}} of a {{calculation}} model on film cooling in the primary zone of an annular combustor, a parametrical study was made {{on the relationship of}} film cooling effectiveness and wall temperature with configuration parameters such as cooling slot height and TBC thickness. Through parametrical study, {{it can be seen that}} with all the parameters kept the same and even the resulting effectiveness of the outer liner slightly greater due to a slightly higher blow ratio, the outer liner temperatures are considerably higher than the inner liner temperatures. The calculation shows, with cooling effectiveness, there are optimum values of coolant injection angle and film cooling slot height, while there is a monotonous tendency for the relationship of cooling effectiveness with other parameters such as tapered angle on nugget lip, <b>starting</b> <b>edge</b> angle at nugget-slot exit and lip thickness. The study demonstrates that the higher the TBC thickness, the lower the highest value of base metal temperatures, but when the TBC thickens, it becomes heavier, and the possibility of TBC spallation gets greater...|$|R

30|$|Rolled-up nanotech [1, 2] {{has become}} a {{powerful}} technology with applications in {{a broad range of}} research fields, including optofluidics [3], micromachinery [4 – 6], magnetofluidics [4, 7], biophysics [4, 8], nanomechanics [9], and waveguiding for different spectral ranges and applications [10 – 12]. Large arrays of periodically ordered microtubes can be fabricated by a combination of lithography and deliberate self-rolling of strained layers upon selective underetching [1, 13 – 15]. However, in some cases, it might be important to stimulate tube formation in certain areas and suppress tube formation outside those areas. Precise control over the lateral positioning and the number of windings is fundamental {{for the use of the}} tubes in optical resonators for sensors [16 – 20], hyperlenses [4, 21, 22], or electrical transport (curved electron gases) [23 – 27]. Numerous existing studies offer highly sophisticated methods for precise lateral positioning of rolled-up semiconductor nanostructures by controlling the <b>starting</b> <b>edges</b> [13 – 15, 28, 29], but difficulties arise for thin layers due to the extensive, successive lithography steps involved, and ways to control the stopping point of rolling remain largely lacking without modifying the structure.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Anatomical {{structure}} tracing on cephalograms is {{a significant}} way to obtain cephalometric analysis. Cephalometric analysis is divided in two categories, manual and automatic approaches. The manual approach is limited in accuracy and repeatability {{due to differences in}} inter- and intra-personal marking. In this paper, we have attempted to develop and test a novel method for automatic localization of craniofacial structures based on the detected edges in the region of interest. Before edge detection of the particular region, the region was filtered by adaptive non local filter for noise removal by keeping the edge information undisturbed. According to the gray-scale feature at the different regions of the cephalograms, modified Canny edge detection algorithm for obtaining tissue contour was proposed. With the application of morphological opening and edge linking approaches, an improved bidirectional contour tracing method-ology was proposed by an interactive selection of the <b>starting</b> <b>edge</b> pixels, the tracking process searches repetitively for an edge pixel at the neighborhood of previously searched edge pixel to segment images, and then craniofacial structures are obtained. The ef-fectiveness of the algorithm is demonstrated by the preliminary experimental results obtained with the proposed method.
