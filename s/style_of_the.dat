The {{participants in this study were}} 103 students and five ESL teachers. A modified version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> PLSPQ has been used as an assessment instrument to determine <b>the</b> learning <b>styles</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> students. The results showed that Lebanese students have a preference for multiple learning styles, auditory, kinesthetic, tactile and visual and that age, gender, discipline and time spent studying English are variables that affect <b>the</b> learning <b>styles</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> students. The findings showed that there was no match between the teaching and learning <b>styles</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> teachers and students. Implications are made for the classroom. PublishedN/...|$|R
