40|$|Experiments were {{undertaken}} in the Large Air Sea Interaction <b>Simulation</b> <b>Tunnel</b> of IRPHE-IOA, Laboratoire de LUMINY, in Marseille, France, aimed at improving {{our understanding of the}} effects of breaking waves on gas transfer, and providing parameterisations for the transfer velocities. Detailed studies were made of breaking wave phenomena, bubbles and turbulence in water and air, and exchange rates of gases with a variety of physical properties (CO 2, CH 4, N 2 O, DMS, CH 3 Br, 4 He and SF 6). A simple scaling of air-water transfer velocities with friction velocity and Schmidt number breaks down at high wind speeds. A solubility-dependent enhancement of transfer velocity by bubbles can explain only part of the behaviour. An "interfacial resistance" model can explain much of the outstanding behaviour at high wind speeds. Bubble-mediated transfer, surface disruption by turbulence and surfacing bubbles, and interfacial resistance, are all identified as significant to air-sea gas exchange at high wind and sea states...|$|E

40|$|A {{mathematical}} simulation {{is presented}} which predicts the spontaneous shape evolution of cubic etch pits on aluminum as they develop into etch tunnels during anodic etching in chloride solutions. The simulation {{is based on}} a model for oxide passivation, according to which the rate of oxide film coverage increases as the potential at the dissolving surface is made more negative than the critical repassivation potential, which depends on the local chloride ion concentration. Mass transport calculations are used to predict the electrolyte concentration and potential in the pit, which in turn determine the rate of oxide advance and hence the shape change of the pit. The model predicts the pit‐tunnel transformation, as well as width expansion of tunnels near their mouths. The occurrence of these features is independent of the choice of the passivation rate constant, an adjustable parameter in the <b>simulation.</b> <b>Tunnel</b> width oscillations were found at relatively low values of the rate constant. In the model, the pit‐tunnel transformation is produced by rapid pit sidewall passivation, which is due to the relatively slower increase of the pit electrolyte concentration relative to the ohmic drop, during the pit 2 ̆ 7 s initial growth. A fully quantitative comparison of the model and experiment is possible with independent experimental information on passivation kinetics...|$|E

The extent of ovalization and the frequency of overlap of the two tunnel apertures were compared. Methods: The simulation of femoral tunnel drilling with the TT and the trans-AMP techniques was performed using three-dimensional computer aided design models from two volunteers. The incidence angle of drilling against the intercondylar wall, the femoral tunnel position, the ovalization, and the overlap were analyzed. The aperture and location of the tunnels were also examined in real anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction cases (n= 36). Results: The surgical simulation showed that a lower drill incident angle induced by the TT technique made the apertures of two tunnels more ovalized, located anteromedial tunnels in a shallower position to prevent posterior wall blow out, and led to a higher frequency of tunnel overlap. The trans-AMP group had tunnel places within the footprint and had less ovalization and overlap. The results of analysis for tunnels in the clinical cases were consistent with results from the surgical simulation. Conclusion: In the TT technique, the shallow anteromedial tunnel location and more ovalized tunnel aperture can lead to a higher frequency of tunnel overlap. Compared with the TT technique, the trans-AMP technique was more useful in preparing femoral tunnels anatomically and avoiding tunnel ovalization and overlapping in double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.

40|$|The {{changing}} and stricter regulatory environment {{has caused the}} mining industries in South Africa to re-look at their individual mine health and safety departments. In 1997, after {{the report of the}} Leon Commission of Inquiry (1995), the South African Department of Minerals and Energy (DME) sent out a directive to reduce the dust concentration level to below 5 mg/m 3 at the operator’s position for the sampling period. The reasons for the high levels of dust concentrations of dust are: long headings up to 35 m, inherently high dust generation rates of coal, and the increased use of highly mechanized equipment. To aid in developing systems to reduce high dust levels, a project was formulated under SIMRAC auspices with the title of “Underground Mechanical Miner Environmental Control” to address the dust problem. The project was executed in two phases. The first phase involved laboratory tests on a continuous miner model for different ventilation and spray systems at ventilation <b>simulation</b> <b>tunnel</b> at the Kloppersbos Research Center. In {{the second phase of the}} project, tests were carried out underground, based on the findings and recommendations from the simulated tests. This paper focuses on the results and findings of the hood systems, viz., retrofitted hood system and integrated hood system. The average dust concentration for the sampling period at the operator’s position for the retrofitted hood, integrated hood system-smaller scrubber and integrated hood system-larger scrubbers were 2. 33 mg/m 3, 6. 08 mg/m 3 and 5. 98 mg/m 3 respectively.

40|$|Yasutaka Tashiro, Ken Okazaki, Yukihide Iwamoto Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan Purpose: We {{aimed to}} clarify the {{distance}} between the anteromedial (AM) bundle and posterolateral (PL) bundle tunnel-aperture centers by simulating the anatomical femoral tunnel placement during double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using 3 -D computer-aided design models of the knee, in order to discuss the risk of tunnel overlap. Relationships between the AM to PL center distance, body height, and sex difference were also analyzed. Patients and methods: The positions of the AM and PL tunnel centers were defined based on previous studies using the quadrant method, and were superimposed anatomically onto the 3 -D computer-aided design knee models from 68 intact femurs. The distance between the tunnel centers was measured using the 3 -D DICOM software package. The correlation between the AM–PL distance and the subject&# 39;s body height was assessed, and a cutoff height value for a higher risk of overlap of the AM and PL tunnel apertures was identified. Results: The distance between the AM and PL centers was 10. 2 ± 0. 6 mm in males and 9. 4 ± 0. 5 mm in females (P< 0. 01). The AM–PL center distance demonstrated good correlation with body height in both males (r= 0. 66, P< 0. 01) and females (r= 0. 63, P< 0. 01). When 9 mm was defined as the critical distance between the tunnel centers to preserve a 2 mm bony bridge between the two tunnels, the cutoff value was calculated to be a height of 160 cm in males and 155 cm in females. Conclusion: When AM and PL tunnels were placed anatomically in simulated double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, {{the distance between the}} two tunnel centers showed a strong positive correlation with body height. In cases with relatively short stature, the AM and PL tunnel apertures are considered to be at a higher risk of overlap when surgeons choose the double-bundle technique.

40|$|Modelling of {{phosphorus}} donor-based silicon (Si:P) qubit {{devices and}} mesoscopic single-electron devices {{is presented in}} this thesis. This theoretical analysis is motivated {{by the use of}} Si:P devices for scalable quantum computing. Modelling of Si:P single-electron devices (SEDs) using readily available simulation tools is presented. The mesoscopic properties of single and double island devices with source-drain leads is investigated through ion implantation simulation (using Crystal-TRIM), 3 D capacitance extraction (FastCap) and single-electron circuit simulation (SIMON). Results from modelling two generations of single and double island Si:P devices are given, which are shown to accurately capture their charging behaviour. The trends extracted are used to forecast limits to the reduction in size of this Si:P architecture. Theoretical analysis of P 2 +:Si charge qubits is then presented. Calculations show large ranges for the SET measurement signal, &# 916;q, and geometric ratio factor, &# 945;, are possible given the 'top-down' fabrication procedure. The charge qubit energy levels are calculated using the atomistic simulator NEMO 3 -D coupled to TCAD calculations of the electrostatic potential distribution, further demonstrating the precise control required over the position of the donors. Theory has also been developed to simulate the microwave spectroscopy of P 2 +:Si charge qubits in a decohering environment using Floquet theory. This theory uses TCAD finite-volume modelling to incorporate realistic fields from actual device gate geometries. The theory is applied to a specific P 2 +:Si charge qubit device design to study the effects of fabrication variations on the measurement signal. The signal is shown to be a sensitive function of donor position. Design and analysis of two different spin qubit architectures concludes this thesis. The first uses a high-barrier Schottky contact, SET and an implanted P donor to create a double-well suitable for implementation as a qubit. The second architecture is a MOS device that combines an electron reservoir and SET into a single structure, formed from a locally depleted accumulation layer. The design parameters of both architectures are explored through capacitance modelling, TCAD <b>simulation,</b> <b>tunnel</b> barrier transmission and NEMO 3 -D calculations.
