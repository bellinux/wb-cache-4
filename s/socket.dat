5|$|According to {{the initial}} description, the eye <b>socket</b> of Euchambersia is rather small. The {{branches}} of the postorbital and jugal that usually surround the back {{and bottom of the}} eye <b>socket</b> in therocephalians appear to be either very reduced or absent entirely. Meanwhile, the top of the eye <b>socket</b> is formed by the prefrontal, and the frontal is also small. The skull does not bear a pineal foramen. Like Whaitsia, the pterygoid and palatine of the palate are not separated from the transpalatine, further {{to the side of the}} jaw, by any sort of opening.|$|E

50|$|Berkeley <b>sockets</b> evolved {{with little}} {{modification}} from {{a de facto}} standard into {{a component of the}} POSIX specification. Therefore, the term POSIX <b>sockets</b> is essentially synonymous with Berkeley <b>sockets.</b> They are also known as BSD <b>sockets,</b> acknowledging the first implementation in the Berkeley Software Distribution.|$|R
40|$|<b>Sockets</b> Direct Protocol (SDP) is an {{industry}} standard pseudo socketslike implementation to allow existing <b>sockets</b> applications to directly and transparently {{take advantage of the}} advanced features of current generation networks such as InfiniBand. The SDP standard supports two kinds of <b>sockets</b> semantics, viz., Synchronous <b>sockets</b> (e. g., used by Linux, BSD, Windows) and Asynchronous <b>sockets</b> (e. g., used by Windows, upcoming support in Linux). Due to the inherent benefits of asynchronous <b>sockets,</b> the SDP standard allows several intelligent approaches such as source-avail and sink-avail based zero-copy for these <b>sockets.</b> Unfortunately, most of these approaches are not beneficial for the synchronous <b>sockets</b> interface. Further, due to its portability, ease of use and support on a wider set of platforms, the synchronous <b>sockets</b> interface is the one used by most <b>sockets</b> applications today. Thus, a mechanism by which the approaches proposed for asynchronous <b>sockets</b> can be used for synchronous <b>sockets</b> is highly desirable. In this paper, we propose one such mechanism, termed as AZ-SDP (Asynchronous Zero-Copy SDP), where we memory-protect application buffers and carry out communication asynchronously while maintaining the synchronous <b>sockets</b> semantics. We present our detailed design in this paper and evaluate the stack with an extensive set of benchmarks. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach can provide an improvement of close to 35 % for medium-message unidirectional throughput and up to a factor of 2 benefit for computationcommunication overlap tests and multi-connection benchmarks. ...|$|R

5|$|Only {{the rear}} {{part of the}} skull is preserved. It likely showed a horselike, broad snout {{equipped}} with pencil-like teeth, as seen in related sauropods for which more complete skulls are known. As in other dicraeosaurids, the external naris (nostril opening) was situated in the posterior half of the skull, diagonally above the eye <b>socket,</b> which was proportionally large. As in most other dinosaurs, the skull featured three additional openings (fenestrae). The infratemporal fenestra, located below the eye <b>socket,</b> was long and narrow. Behind the eye <b>socket</b> was the supratemporal fenestra, which in dicraeosaurids was uniquely small and can be seen when the skull is viewed from the side. This contrasts with other diapsid reptiles, where these openings were directed upwards, thus being visible only in top view. The antorbital fenestra would have been located {{in front of the}} eye <b>socket,</b> although this region is not preserved. An unusual feature were small openings seen on the backside of the skull, the so-called parietal openings or fontanelles. In other tetrapods, these openings are usually seen only in juveniles and would close as the individual grows. Skull features shared with Dicraeosaurus but absent in other sauropods included the fused frontal bones and the notably long basipterygoid processes, bony extensions connecting the braincase with the palate.|$|E
5|$|Two skull bones, the {{lacrimal}} and postorbital bones, projected {{into the}} eye <b>socket</b> {{from the front}} and back, nearly dividing it into two compartments. The eye would have been located in the upper compartment, which was tilted slightly outwards in Carnotaurus, perhaps providing some degree of binocular vision. The lacrimal and postorbital also met above the eye <b>socket,</b> to form a ridge or brow above the eye.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the oval-shaped eye <b>socket</b> of Tanystropheus, the eye <b>socket</b> of Dinocephalosaurus {{appears to}} be peach-shaped, with a narrow {{anterior}} end. On {{the top of the}} skull, the parietal is broad and flattened, bearing no trace of the midline crest found in Tanystropheus. The jugal only has two processes, missing the third backward-projecting process present in most other reptiles. Also missing are the retroarticular process of the posterior (rear) lower jaw (another point of distinction from Tanystropheus), as well as additional teeth and a cavity between the pterygoid bones on the palate.|$|E

5|$|Alveolar osteitis is a {{complication}} of tooth extraction (especially lower wisdom teeth) {{in which the}} blood clot is not formed or is lost, leaving the <b>socket</b> where the tooth used to be empty, and bare bone is exposed to the mouth. The pain is moderate to severe, and dull, aching, and throbbing in character. The pain is localized to the <b>socket,</b> and may radiate. It normally starts two to {{four days after the}} extraction, and may last 10–40 days. Healing is delayed, and it is treated with local anesthetic dressings, which are typically required for five to seven days. There is some evidence that chlorhexidine mouthwash used prior to extractions prevents alveolar osteitis.|$|E

5|$|Deinosuchus had a {{secondary}} bony palate, {{which would have}} permitted it to breathe through its nostrils {{while the rest of}} the head remained submerged underwater.

40|$|Convenience <b>sockets</b> are {{a family}} of derived <b>sockets</b> {{provided}} in utilities namespace of TLM 2. 0 library which add additional functionalities to TLM 2. 0 <b>sockets.</b> As {{one of the goals}} of high level modeling is to part communication from computation, synthesizing communication mechanisms including <b>sockets</b> can be a primary step to synthesize each TLM 2. 0 design on RTL.

In this paper, algorithms are proposed to map TLM 2. 0 simple <b>sockets</b> down to RTL focusing on TLM 2. 0 blocking and non-blocking transport interfaces. The algorithms get TLM 2. 0 <b>sockets</b> as an input and generate an intermediate description of <b>sockets</b> in terms of ports.
