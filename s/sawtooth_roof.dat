50|$|Tubular steel posts are {{employed}} {{on the third}} level, while the top floor utilised steel ties to truss the vertical section of the <b>sawtooth</b> <b>roof,</b> thereby achieving a span of 30 metres which required only a central row of steel columns. The showroom also has square vents with timber louvers beneath the windows, and the customary <b>sawtooth</b> <b>roof</b> aligned {{from east to west}} for optimum lighting.|$|E
50|$|The Central Telephone Exchange, Melbourne {{provides}} an early example approximately 1919 of a reinforced concrete <b>sawtooth</b> <b>roof.</b>|$|E
50|$|Additional {{buildings}} {{include the}} fish hatchery lab, a 1967 brick building, the distinctive Sawtooth Building (ca. 1964) or Wet Laboratory, another hatchery {{building with a}} <b>sawtooth</b> <b>roof</b> profile, and several apartments.|$|E
50|$|The main {{building}} is a rectangular timber framed and chamferboard clad building with a slab on ground concrete floor throughout. The timber frame stands on a low concrete upstand that runs {{around the perimeter of}} the shed. A moulded timber cornice runs around the parapet that screens the <b>sawtooth</b> <b>roofs</b> behind. The <b>sawtooth</b> <b>roofs</b> are clad with corrugated metal sheeting and have south facing clerestory windows; most are glazed, some house fixed timber louvres or are clad with corrugated metal sheeting. An additional narrow rectangular raised gable roof with glazed windows to the east and west sits over part of the centre of the shed.|$|R
50|$|Deep plan {{buildings}} introduce complications {{for light}} and ventilation penetration that are relatively easily solved for single story buildings (for example using <b>sawtooth</b> <b>roofs)</b> but usually necessitate artificial lighting {{and air conditioning}} or ventilation if over one story.|$|R
50|$|In its layout the Alfredson's Joinery {{complex is}} {{important}} in demonstrating the linear operation of a timber manufacturing process. This {{is evident in the}} planning and organisation of the sawmilling and pre-fabrication workshop where timber was unloaded and worked in the sawmilling area and then moved by trolley to the fabrication area where the timber passed through a number of bench and cutting processes. The finished fabricated components were then dispatched through the western loading dock. The construction of <b>sawtooth</b> <b>roofs</b> to the prefabrication workshop and lantern to the joinery workshop are good examples of the standard design practice of introducing as much daylight as possible into workshop spaces, particularly southern light {{in the case of the}} <b>sawtooth</b> <b>roofs.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{roof of the}} {{building}} has a sawtooth structure with south lights which are not {{at right angles to}} the facade of {{the building}}. This <b>sawtooth</b> <b>roof,</b> from which the top floor showroom is suffused with light, is usual in woolstore construction.|$|E
50|$|The {{internal}} structure is reinforced concrete floors and steel columns, {{with a series}} of trusses supporting the <b>sawtooth</b> <b>roof.</b> It is understood that the river frontage necessitated piers to 28 metres below ground level. Each floor is over 4000 square metres in area.|$|E
50|$|Theodore Strawn, {{a native}} of Illinois, settled in West Volusia County and started an orange packing {{operation}} in 1882. In 1921, the original packing house burned and a metal structure with an iconic <b>sawtooth</b> <b>roof</b> was constructed to replace it. The walls were built from stamped copper alloy steel panels, and designed to be fireproof.|$|E
50|$|The {{museum is}} set in two {{buildings}} {{on the opposite side}} of the River Aa. The first is the spinning mill of Spinnerei Herding. The second is a reconstructed single storey weaving shed with its typical <b>sawtooth</b> <b>roofs.</b> In the weaving shed 30 looms remain operational.|$|R
50|$|<b>Sawtooth</b> <b>roofs,</b> {{in which}} opaque modular {{elements}} are combined with transparent surfaces, whether inclined or in various shapes, have become prevalent again. The exact dimensioning of these roofs {{is extremely important}} {{both in terms of}} energy savings, due to the reduction in electricity needed for artificial lighting, and as regards vision quality.|$|R
40|$|Natural {{lighting}} in industrial, {{commercial and}} sports buildings is usually provided by roofs with transparent surfaces. Sawtooth roofings, in which opaque modular elements are combined with transparent surfaces, whether inclined or in various shapes, are especially popular. The exact dimensioning of these roofs {{is extremely important}} {{both in terms of}} energy savings (less electricity needed for artificial lighting) and as regards vision quality. The paper illustrates a calculation method that accurately assesses daylighting performances of <b>sawtooth</b> <b>roofs.</b> The method allows detailed modelling of the sawtooth’s shape to be created and the transmittances and reflectances of all the materials making up the roofs to be taken into account. The calculation method was applied to eleven different <b>sawtooth</b> <b>roofs</b> supplied by different manufacturers; the results were compared and some technical solutions were suggested for optimizing the performances of the roofs analyzed. Experimental verifications were performed on the method in two industrial buildings, with different roofs; the results show that the calculation method being proposed is both accurate and reliable...|$|R
50|$|Before {{daylight}} was supplemented or {{replaced with}} electric {{light in the}} late 19th century, consideration of good daylight strategies was essential. The <b>sawtooth</b> <b>roof,</b> with its glass panels facing away from the equator, blocks the light and heat of direct sun exposure and provides uniform, natural light over a large area. It was particularly useful in design factories and manufacturing buildings.|$|E
50|$|The packing house {{design is}} {{predominantly}} in the Mission Revival Style, with Spanish Colonial Revival Style architectural elements. The main building measures 165 ft by 70 ft, with one story above grade {{and a full}} basement. The interior is lighted by two <b>sawtooth</b> <b>roof</b> monitors. The north side faces onto railroad tracks that run immediately adjacent to the packing house.|$|E
50|$|To {{the left}} of {{entrance}} is the main mill building. This structure is a large rectangular building constructed of light red common bricks laid in English bond. It has a <b>sawtooth</b> <b>roof</b> of sixteen sections. On {{the western side of}} the main mill building the wall is exposed and four inlaid brick features in cream brick made to resemble arched windows.|$|E
5000|$|The Avondale Mill Historic District is {{a former}} mill village in Pell City, Alabama. Architecturally {{significant}} as the first <b>sawtooth</b> <b>roofed</b> mill in Alabama, the mill village represents a relatively intact example of an early 20th century company town. The mill and its village were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000. [...] The mill closed in 2006, and burned in 2008 while being dismantled for scrap.|$|R
5000|$|Starting in 1924, Sutnar {{designed}} toys {{consisting of}} simple geometric structures {{of animals and}} puppets. He attempted to introduce modern aesthetics into children's toys by developing a building kit that consisted of <b>sawtooth</b> <b>roofs,</b> cones, and pieces in the colors of red, blue, and white (this remained a prototype). He also wrote a children's book {{on the future of}} traffic in Transport: Next Half Century. Sutnar created art-oriented toys, i.e. [...] "Apisonadora" [...] (construction vehicle).|$|R
50|$|A {{very long}} pavilion, which {{features}} an irregularly <b>sawtooth</b> shaped <b>roof,</b> houses the entrances {{to the station}} and is connected to a bus area. It {{is located on the}} south side of Vespucio Norte Express freeway.|$|R
50|$|The former Peck, Stow & Wilcox Factory complex {{was located}} {{west of the}} town center of Southington, and {{occupied}} most of a block bounded by Center, Water, and Mill Streets, and the railroad right-of-way now occupied by the Farmington Canal Heritage Trail. When it was described in 1989 for the National Register, its main buildings were a large forge with a <b>sawtooth</b> <b>roof,</b> and an equally large annealing building. These two were accompanied by an assortment of smaller one and two-story brick buildings. Buildings already demolished at that time included the company's original 1870 plant.|$|E
50|$|The {{top level}} (four) sits under a <b>sawtooth</b> <b>roof</b> {{at the front}} and two {{concealed}} gables at the rear. It is more open plan than the tenantable levels below, however its service spaces around the light well correspond to those below and a central hallway is delineated by columns. Aside from its windows on the south-eastern and south-western walls, there are clerestory windows oriented to Queen Street. A bulkhead disguising ducted air-conditioning has been installed over the central corridor space and in the toilets. Most wall and ceiling linings appear to be recent.|$|E
50|$|The {{showroom}} on the {{top floor}} has the customary <b>sawtooth</b> <b>roof</b> aligned from east to west for optimum lighting. However, this expanse is distinguished by a forest of slender octagonal columns with fretwork brackets, capitals and strings which support the roof of vertical glass and oblique tongue and groove lining. This floor also retains its panelled diningroom, changingroom, telephone booths and other client facilities, as well as lifts and chutes. The rear window openings have been enlarged to connect this top floor with others in the adjacent buildings.|$|E
50|$|The {{company was}} {{established}} by three Jewish entrepreneurs: Michal Gutman from Bedzin, Izrael Kahn from Kraków, and Wolf Luzer Glajtman from Olkusz. The partners leased the production halls from the factory of wire, mesh, and iron products with its characteristic <b>sawtooth</b> <b>roofs,</b> and purchased a plot at ul. Lipowa 4 for their future base. It was then that the following were built: the stamping room where metal sheets were processed, prepared and pressed, the deacidification facility (varnishing) where the vessels were bathed in a solution of sulfuric acid to remove all impurities and grease, and the enamel shop, where enamel was laid {{in a number of}} layers: the priming coat first, then the colour, and finally another protective coat.|$|R
40|$|Wind {{is one of}} the {{significant}} forces of nature that must be considered in the design of buildings. The actual behavior of wind is influenced not only by the surface (or boundary-layer) conditions, but also by the geometry of the building. All sorts of turbulent effects occur, especially at building corners, edges, roof eaves. Some of these effects are accounted for by the wind pressure coefficients. Wind pressure coefficients are determined experimentally by testing scale model buildings in atmospheric boundary layer wind tunnels. In this study, a series of wind tunnel tests with scaled building models were conducted to determine the wind pressure coefficients that are applicable to monosloped and <b>sawtooth</b> <b>roofs.</b> In the estimation of wind pressure coefficients, the effects of building height, number of spans and terrain exposure are considered and analyzed in detail. Both local and area-averaged wind pressure coefficients are calculated and compared with values in ASCE 7 design load guidelines...|$|R
50|$|A long, {{rambling}} {{timber and}} corrugated iron building sheltered {{by a combination}} of gable, <b>sawtooth</b> and skillion <b>roofs,</b> the former joinery complex steps down the slope from a ridge along King Street at the northwest end of Cooran. The property is set against a backdrop of treed mountains and grassed paddocks to the south, has small scale domestic/commercial buildings adjacent and overlooks the railway to the north. The building now accommodates an antique shop at street level and a joinery workshop and timber working areas below.|$|R
50|$|The {{showroom}} on the {{top floor}} has the customary <b>sawtooth</b> <b>roof</b> aligned from east to west for optimum lighting. This expanse is distinguished by the roof ventilators and tongue and groove lining and is supported by steel posts which had 1 metre timber cowls around their base. The top floor also retains its panelled refreshment and dressing rooms. Other unusual features of this wool store are the use of twin bearers to which the posts were bolted, rather than the usual capitals, and the several sets of stairs that include turned newel posts.|$|E
5000|$|Another roof-angled glass {{alternative}} is a <b>sawtooth</b> <b>roof</b> (found on older factories). Sawtooth roofs have vertical roof glass {{facing away from}} the equator {{side of the building}} to capture diffused light (not harsh direct equator-side solar gain). The angled portion of the glass-support structure is opaque and well insulated with a cool roof and radiant barrier. The sawtooth roof's lighting concept partially reduces the summer [...] "solar furnace" [...] skylight problem, but still allows warm interior air to rise and touch the exterior roof glass in the cold winter, with significant undesirable heat transfer.|$|E
50|$|The {{northern}} side of {{the workshop}} building was constructed {{at a later date}} and is noticeably different in that it has a <b>sawtooth</b> <b>roof.</b> This building and the front of both buildings are surrounded by a brick envelope with a flat topped parapet, of which the uppermost section is rendered. Horizontal louvre windows are located in the central section of the southern and eastern elevations. They are defined as a group by a continuous rendered hood which projects over the windows, rendered sills and by the brickwork in which they are contained, which projects slightly from the main plane of the building.|$|E
5000|$|A {{weaving shed}} is a {{distinctive}} type of single storey mill {{developed in the}} early 1800s in Lancashire, Derbyshire and Yorkshire to accommodate the new power looms weaving cotton, silk, woollen and worsted. A weaving shed can be a stand alone mill, or a component of a combined mill. Power looms cause severe vibrations requiring them to be located on a solid ground floor. In the case of cotton, the weaving shed needs to remain moist. Maximum daylight is achieved, by the <b>sawtooth</b> [...] "north-facing <b>roof</b> lights".|$|R
50|$|The Clark Brothers Factory No. 2 {{is located}} in Southington's Milldale section, {{on the east side}} of Canal Street, roughly midway between Burritt Street and Connecticut Route 322. It is a long and {{basically}} linear complex, most of which is sandwiched between the road and a railroad right-of-way that now carries the Farmington Canal Heritage Trail. The complex consists of eleven buildings, ten of which are connected, and one (a boiler house) that is located across the railroad right-of-way. Notable buildings in the complex include a large manufacturing building with an original <b>sawtooth</b> <b>roof,</b> and a heat-treatment and forge building with a monitor roof.|$|E
50|$|The Narragansett Mills {{complex is}} located north of {{downtown}} Fall River, {{on the east side}} of North Main Street at its junction with Narragansett Street. The complex consists of a series of attached buildings, most built out of brick. The main mill is five stories in height, with a shallow-pitch gabled roof. Decorative features include granite corner quoining and window sills, and a bracketed cornice. Attached to the north end is a large weave shed, originally two stories in height with a <b>sawtooth</b> <b>roof.</b> Projecting from the sides of the main mill are smaller engine, boiler, and picker houses, and a machine shop. The only detached building is the single-story main office, set directly at the street corner.|$|E
50|$|A {{traditional}} {{weaving mill}} {{would have a}} two- or three-storey preparation area for pirning the yarn, beaming and sizing attached to an engine house with a 500 hp mill engine, boiler house and chimney. The line shafts from the engine would pass into a large single-storey weaving shed with its characteristic <b>sawtooth</b> <b>roof</b> with north lights. Weaving was the principal activity here, the larger spinning mills of the Oldham Limited of the late 19th century ware built in towns further south. The Burnley loom was a narrow loom that produced grey cloth suitable for printing. Here we find many such stone-built mills such as the Waterloo Shed north of Trafalgar Street and the Wiseman Street Shed, the Sandygate Shed (c1860), and the brick-built Woodfield Mill (1886).|$|E
50|$|As {{usual for}} woolstores in Teneriffe, {{the ground floor}} is concreted and the upper {{flooring}} is heavily timbered with posts, beams and joists, the latter being cross-braced by herringbone struts. Internal timber staircases at the front corners and the original Johns and Waygood passenger lift near the entrance lead to the upper floors. Level 2 walkways connected Australian Estates No 1 and Goldsbrough Mort to this structure, but the latter walkway has been removed. The showroom {{on the top floor}} has square ventilators with wooden louvers beneath the windows, and the customary <b>sawtooth</b> <b>roof,</b> which is supported by tubular metal columns and aligned from east to west for optimum lighting. The roof is constructed of corrugated asbestos and reinforced glass.|$|E
50|$|The former Naushon Company Plant {{is located}} in the Valley Falls area of southernmost Cumberland, on 3.5 acre of land between Meeting Street (to the north) and the Blackstone River (to the south). The complex {{includes}} five interconnected buildings and one that is detached, of which four are brick, one is wood-frame, and the last is of concrete construction. The main mill building is a two-story brick structure, 339 x 170 ft. Its notable features are a significant number of original segmented-arch windows, and a distinctive <b>sawtooth</b> <b>roof</b> of a type commonly used on early 20th-century mill buildings but not often preserved. Along its riverfront elevation there also a series of pilaster-shaped venting flues, part of the building's original air handling system.|$|E
50|$|The former Warrenton Woolen Mill Complex {{is located}} north of {{downtown}} Torrington, {{on the west bank}} of the East Branch Naugatuck River. It is accessed from Main Street, which parallels the river on the east bank, via a drive that crosses the river. The mill consists of two large brick buildings, one two stories in height and the other three, connected by other structures. The site includes eight buildings in all, most of which date to the early 20th century. The two main mill buildings, each more than 250 ft in length, are set parallel to each other in a north-south orientation, and exhibit modest commercial Italianate style. A large portion of the weaving shed is topped by a <b>sawtooth</b> <b>roof.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{exterior}} {{walls are}} constructed out of translucent fiberglass, which allows diffused daylight to enter {{during the day}} and creates a soft glow outside at night. These translucent exterior walls do not permit outward views, but rather directs attention inward toward an exterior courtyard {{in the center of the}} building. The landscaped courtyard provides an outdoor space for reading and various activates for the library visitors. Inside the courtyard there is a sculpture designed by artist Thomas Scarff, Centura. [...] The sawtoothed roof profile incorporates long clearstory windows that collect soft northern daylight and shields the direct southern sunlight. The exterior façade expresses the structural pipe columns and <b>sawtooth</b> <b>roof</b> structure. Originally the exposed steel structure was painted white, but have since then been painted grey.|$|E
50|$|Horizontal rows of multipaned {{windows are}} {{subsidiary}} in overall effect to the vertical lines of quoined piers which separate the window columns. These piers are decoratively composed of cream coloured bricks alternating at every fourth row {{with a band}} of darker hue. Contrasting bricks are also patterned throughout the window columns. The twelve-paned sash windows have shallow arched heads, the top row featuring a brick keystone. They are unusual in being designed to pivot for maximum light and ventilation. An elaborate moulded cornice is surmounted by a simple but dominant rendered-brick parapet displaying the company name in bold lettering and hiding the <b>sawtooth</b> <b>roof</b> behind. A straight corrugated iron awning suspended by iron rods over the railway siding and loading bays emphasises {{the base of the}} Vernon Terrace facade.|$|E
