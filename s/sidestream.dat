5|$|Passive smoking—the {{inhalation}} {{of smoke}} from another's smoking—is {{a cause of}} lung cancer in nonsmokers. A passive smoker {{can be defined as}} someone living or working with a smoker. Studies from the US, Europe and the UK have consistently shown a significantly increased risk among those exposed to passive smoke. Those who live with someone who smokes have a 20–30% increase in risk while those who work in an environment with secondhand smoke have a 16–19% increase in risk. Investigations of <b>sidestream</b> smoke suggest it is more dangerous than direct smoke. Passive smoking causes about 3,400 deaths from lung cancer each year in the USA.|$|E
25|$|It {{was found}} in 2007 that while tobacco and {{cannabis}} smoke are quite similar, cannabis smoke contained higher amounts of ammonia, hydrogen cyanide, and nitrogen oxides, but lower levels of carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). This study found that directly inhaled cannabis smoke contained as much as 20 times as much ammonia and 5 times as much hydrogen cyanide as tobacco smoke and compared the properties of both mainstream and <b>sidestream</b> (smoke emitted from a smouldering 'joint' or 'cone') smoke. Mainstream cannabis smoke was found to contain higher concentrations of selected polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) than <b>sidestream</b> tobacco smoke. However, other studies have found much lower disparities in ammonia and hydrogen cyanide between cannabis and tobacco, and that some other constituents (such as polonium-210, lead, arsenic, nicotine, and tobacco-specific nitrosamines) are either lower or non-existent in cannabis smoke.|$|E

40|$|The {{paper and}} board {{industry}} (PBI) faces a series of challenges, ranging from shifts in the availability and quality of raw materials to the generation of large amounts of <b>sidestreams</b> whose disposal entails significant costs. The concept of the “Multiple Input-Multiple Output (MIMO) Paper Mill” is proposed here as an option for addressing these issues by introducing, on the one hand, flexibility regarding the types of fibre sources {{that can be used}} as raw materials and, on the other, a full utilisation of all fractions of the raw materials, including those that were so far considered to be <b>sidestreams</b> of papermaking. With regard to raw material flexibility, researchers have implemented various pretreatment and pulping methods on potential alternative, non-wood, fibre sources for the PBI, which can be found primarily in agro-industrial residues and plants specially cultivated for this purpose. Research on the conversion of various types of papermaking <b>sidestreams</b> into energy and material products has also been extensive, with the new products aimed at (re) use within both the PBI itself and other sectors. Given that technical aspects have gained the most attention so far, more focus should now be placed also on the economic and organisational sides of the concept. It is also crucial to start evaluating integrated MIMO cases, taking into account the interconnected effects that new raw materials have on the papermaking process and its <b>sidestreams,</b> instead of looking into isolated MI and MO examples...|$|R
40|$|Energy {{optimization}} {{is a hot}} research {{topic for}} design and operation of crude oil distillation plants. Optimum energy utilization in a multistage crude oil distillation process is achieved by optimizing the distillation load of each distillation column {{as well as the}} yield of the <b>sidestreams</b> of distillation columns. A generalized multistage distillation energy consumption model is proposed, and the optimal distillation load distribution is accomplished by minimizing the total energy consumption. Based on the optimal distillation loads, a nonlinear programming model is then formulated to determine the yields of <b>sidestreams</b> by maximizing the thermal exergy recovery for the crude oil plant. Finally, a four-stage crude oil distillation plant is investigated to demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach.

25|$|<b>Sidestream</b> tobacco smoke, or exhaled {{mainstream}} smoke, {{is particularly}} harmful. Because exhaled smoke exists at lower temperatures than inhaled smoke, chemical compounds undergo changes {{which can cause}} them to become more dangerous.

40|$|The minimum {{energy demand}} of a {{specified}} separation {{is a key}} parameter in process design. However, a simple and fast short-cut method applicable to all types of splits and mixtures in both simple and complex columns is not yet available. In this paper a new general method for calculating the minimum energy demand for distillation columns is presented. It stems from a geometric analysis of the plate-to-plate profiles and uses all pinch points of both column sections. No a-priori choice of relevant solution branches of the pinch equations is required. The computational effort is low since no rigorous plate-to-plate calculations are necessary.

40|$|Bio-refineries produce {{large volumes}} of waste streams with high organic content, which are {{potentially}} interesting for further processing. Anaerobic digestion (AD) can be a key technology for treatment of these <b>sidestreams,</b> such as molasses. However, the high concentration of salts in molasses can cause inhibition of methanogenesis. In this research, concentrated and diluted molasses were subjected to biomethanation in two types of submerged anaerobic membrane bioreactors (AnMBRs) : one with biogas recirculation and one with a vibrating membrane. Both reactors were compared in terms of methane production and membrane fouling. Biogas recirculation {{seemed to be a}} good way to avoid membrane fouling, while the transmembrane pressures in the vibratingMBR increased over time, due to cake layer formation and the absence of a mixing system. Stable methane production, up to 2. 05 L L_ 1 d_ 1 and a concomitant COD removal of 94. 4 %, was obtained only when diluted molasses were used, since concentrated molasses caused a decrease in methane production and an increase in volatile fatty acids (VFA), indicating an inhibiting effect of concentrated molasses on AD.

40|$|Determining {{the optimum}} number of trays in a {{distillation}} column {{has been an}} important process optimization problem for over fifty years. Over the past decade this problem has been addressed successfully as a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem. But tools for solving MINLPs are not widespread, especially in connection with detailed simulation models. This paper therefore addresses the question: is there an accurate tray optimization formulation that can be solved using current nonlinear programming algorithms? In this study we obtained a positive answer by introducing a differentiable distribution function (DDF). In this formulation, all streams around a column, except the top and bottom products, are directed to all of the column trays using the DDF. As a result, the distributed flowrate of the entry or exit streams is directed to a specific tray based on the value of its DDF at that tray. This approach allows the placement of feeds, <b>sidestreams</b> and number of trays in the column to be continuous variables in the DDF and in the optimization problem it eliminates the need for integer variables. Instead, we formulate the tray optimization problem as an NLP using the original MESH model. In this approach it is critical to deal with trays that have no liquid or vapor flows. To describe this phenomenon properly in the optimization, complementary constraints are formulated and added to the NLP, by taking advantage of a smoothing algorithm developed by Gopal and Biegler for phase equilibrium. Also, since pressure in each tray has a substantial affect on distillation calculations, the pressure drops across each tray depend on the optimal number of trays and a related smoothing function formulation is presented that removes the pressure drop on dry trays.

40|$|Excess of {{nitrogen}} in water bodies causes eutrophication. One important source {{of nitrogen}} is the effluent from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Nitrogen in wastewater is most commonly removed by nitrification-denitrification. During nitrification-denitrification, aerobic ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) oxidize ammonium to nitrite, which is in turn oxidized to nitrate by their syntrophic partners; aerobic nitrite oxidizing bacteria. Heterotrophic denitrifiers can then convert the nitrate to harmless nitrogen gas. Partial-nitritation anammox (PNA) is an alternative process for nitrogen removal which is today used for treatment of warm and concentrated <b>sidestreams</b> (reject water after anaerobic sludge digestion) at WWTPs, with potential to be used also for the mainstream of wastewater. PNA relies on bacteria capable of anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) using nitrite as electron acceptor. Together with AOB they convert ammonia to nitrogen gas. To increase retention of biomass in bioreactors, bacteria are often grown in biofilms, microbial communities attached to a surface. The overall aim of this thesis was to study nitrifying- and anammox communities in biofilms, using moving bed biofilm reactors as a model system. Reactor performance, microbial community dynamics and biofilm structure of PNA reactors operated a low temperature or low ammonium concentration were studied, showing community stability, but process instabilities. Differences in composition and ribosomal content between reject- and mainstream communities were investigated, showing that both abundance and bacterial activity are important for explaining differences in process rates. Basic question about biofilm ecology were also studied. Here, for the first time, predation of anammox bacteria in biofilms was demonstrated. Furthermore, it was shown how biofilm thickness influences nitrifying communities and biofilm functions, with differences in community composition and ecosystem function. Together these results help to unravel the link between community composition and bioreactor function for anammox and nitrifying biofilms, {{which can lead to}} development of new technologies and strategies for N-removal in wastewater...|$|R
40|$|Background: Volatile {{fatty acids}} (VFA) are {{building}} blocks for the chemical industry. Sustainable, biological production is constrained by production and recovery costs, including the need for intensive pH correction. Membrane electrolysis has been developed as an in situ extraction technology tailored to the direct recovery of VFA from fermentation while stabilizing acidogenesis without caustic addition. A current applied across an anion exchange membrane reduces the fermentation broth (catholyte, water reduction: H 2 O + e- → 12 H 2 + OH-) and drives carboxylate ions into a clean, concentrated VFA stream (anolyte, water oxidation: H 2 O → 2 e- + 2 H+ + O 2). Results: In this study, we fermented thin stillage to generate a mixed VFA extract without chemical pH control. Membrane electrolysis (0. 1 A, 3. 22 ± 0. 60 V) extracted 28 ± 6 % of carboxylates generated per day (on a carbon basis) and completely replaced caustic control of pH, with {{no impact on the}} total carboxylate production amount or rate. Hydrogen generated from the applied current shifted the fermentation outcome from predominantly C 2 and C 3 VFA (64 ± 3 % of the total VFA present in the control) to majority of C 4 to C 6 (70 ± 12 % in the experiment), with identical proportions in the VFA acid extract. A strain related to Megasphaera elsdenii (maximum abundance of 57 %), a bacteria capable of producing mid-chain VFA at a high rate, was enriched by the applied current, alongside a stable community of Lactobacillus spp. (10 %), enabling chain elongation of VFA through lactic acid. A conversion of 30 ± 5 % VFA produced per sCOD fed (60 ± 10 % of the reactive fraction) was achieved, with a 50 ± 6 % reduction in suspended solids likely by electro-coagulation. Conclusions: VFA can be extracted directly from a fermentation broth by membrane electrolysis. The electrolytic water reduction products are utilized in the fermentation: OH- is used for pH control without added chemicals, and H 2 is metabolized by species such as Megasphaera elsdenii to produce greater value, more reduced VFA.
