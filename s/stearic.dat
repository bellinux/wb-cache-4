5|$|The {{synthesis}} of unsaturated fatty acids involves a desaturation reaction, whereby a double bond is {{introduced into the}} fatty acyl chain. For example, in humans, the desaturation of <b>stearic</b> acid by stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 produces oleic acid. The doubly unsaturated fatty acid linoleic acid {{as well as the}} triply unsaturated α-linolenic acid cannot be synthesized in mammalian tissues, and are therefore essential fatty acids and must be obtained from the diet.|$|E
5|$|A {{chemical}} analysis of Mexican specimens has shown L.indigo to contain moisture at 951mg/g of mushroom, fat at 4.3mg/g, protein at 13.4mg/g, and dietary fiber at 18.7mg/g, much higher {{in comparison to}} the common button mushroom, which contains 6.6mg/g. Compared to three other wild edible mushroom species also tested in the study (Amanita rubescens, Boletus frostii, and Ramaria flava), L.indigo contained the highest saturated fatty acids content, including <b>stearic</b> acid with 32.1mg/g—slightly over half of the total free fatty acid content.|$|E

25|$|Fatty acids are classic {{components}} of candle-making. <b>Stearic</b> acid is used along with simple sugar or corn syrup as a hardener in candies.|$|E
25|$|In fireworks, <b>stearic</b> acid {{is often}} used to coat metal powders such as {{aluminium}} and iron. This prevents oxidation, allowing compositions to be stored {{for a longer period of}} time.|$|E
25|$|<b>Stearic</b> acid is {{a common}} {{lubricant}} during injection molding and pressing of ceramic powders. It is also used as a mold release for foam latex that is baked in stone molds.|$|E
25|$|An isotope {{labeling}} {{study in}} humans {{concluded that the}} fraction of dietary <b>stearic</b> acid that oxidatively desaturates to oleic acid is 2.4 {{times higher than the}} fraction of palmitic acid analogously converted to palmitoleic acid.|$|E
25|$|Being inexpensively {{available}} and chemically benign, <b>stearic</b> acid finds many niche applications, for example, in making plaster castings from a plaster piece mold or waste mold and {{in making the}} mold from a shellacked clay original. In this use, powdered <b>stearic</b> acid is mixed in water and the suspension is brushed onto the surface to be parted after casting. This reacts with the calcium in the plaster to form {{a thin layer of}} calcium stearate, which functions as a release agent. When reacted with zinc it forms zinc stearate, which is used as a lubricant for playing cards (fanning powder) to ensure a smooth motion when fanning. In compressed confections, it is used as a lubricant to keep the tablet from sticking to the die.|$|E
25|$|A 100 gram {{serving of}} milk {{chocolate}} supplies 540 calories. It is 59% carbohydrates (52% as sugar and 3% as dietary fiber), 30% fat and 8% protein (table).

25|$|Lanolin from sheep's wool {{is found}} in lip balm and moisturizers. <b>Stearic</b> acid is a common {{ingredient}} in face creams, shaving foam and shampoos; as with glycerine, it can be plant-based but is usually animal-derived. Lactic acid, an alpha-hydroxy acid derived from animal milk, is used in moisturizers, as is allantoin, from the comfrey plant or cows' urine, in shampoos, moisturizers and toothpaste. Carmine from scale insects, such as the female cochineal, is used in food and cosmetics to produce red and pink shades.|$|E
25|$|That {{same study}} {{discussed}} that a diet high in MUFAs {{is not the}} major determinant of erythrocyte membrane MUFAs, where most oleic acid in mammalian tissue {{is derived from the}} saturated <b>stearic</b> acid residue. Where key conversion is controlled by the Delta9-desaturase, which also regulates the transformation of the other common saturated fatty acids (SFAs) (myristic and palmitic). The study discussed that fat content of the diet has an important effect on Delta9-d activity, while high levels of SFAs increase Delta9-d activity by twofold to threefold, whereas polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) decrease.|$|E
25|$|The {{kernel of}} the egusi-itoo seed is 44% oil, 30% protein, 10% carbohydrate, 4% ash and 3% fiber. The oil of this seed is 64.9% {{linoleic}} acid, 12.4% oleic acid, 11.8% <b>stearic</b> acid and 10.9% palmitic acid. Vitamins Thiamin, Niacin, B1 and B2 are also {{prevalent in the}} seed, {{as well as many}} micronutrients. Notable minerals include phosphorus, as the largest mineral component, with potassium, magnesium, manganese, sulfur, calcium, iron and zinc to follow. The bulk of carbohydrates are starch and soluble sugars. Egusi-itoo is the perfect complement to the largely starch-rich grain diet of Africa, providing a high-protein and high-energy concentrate. The seed contains every important macro and micro-nutrient in quantities ideal for nutrition. The amino acid content of egusi-itoo proteins makes it a sufficient vegetable protein. This composition is ideal for sick and growing bodies, providing essential amino acids and calories. Just 100 g of seed daily provides essential fatty acid, amino acid and Vitamin E requirements. There is potential for these seeds as a critical tool for interventions in diseases such as marasmus and kwashiorkor.|$|E
25|$|The lipids {{found in}} green coffee include: {{linoleic}} acid, palmitic acid, oleic acid, <b>stearic</b> acid, arachidic acid, diterpenes, triglycerides, unsaturated long-chain fatty acids, esters, and amides. The total content of lipids in dried green coffee is between 11.7 and 14 g/100 g. Lipids are {{present on the}} surface and in the interior matrix of green coffee beans. On the surface, they include derivatives of carboxylic acid-5-hydroxytryptamides with an amide bond to fatty acids (unsaturated C6 to C24) making up to 3% of total lipid content or 1200 to 1400 microgram/g dried green coffee bean. Such compounds form a wax-like cover {{on the surface of the}} coffee bean (200 to 300mg lipids/100g dried green coffee bean) protecting the interior matrix against oxidation and insects. Further, such molecules have antioxidative activity due to their chemical structure. Lipids of the interior tissue are triglycerides, linoleic acid (46% of total free lipids), palmitic acid (30% to 35% of total free lipids), and esters. Arabica beans have a higher content of lipids (13.5 to 17.4g lipids/100g dried green coffee beans) than robustas (9.8 to 10.7g lipids/100g dried green coffee beans). The content of diterpenes is about 20% of the lipid fraction. The diterpenes found in green coffee include cafestol, kahweol and 16-O-methylcafestol. Some of these diterpenes have been shown in in vitro experiments to protect liver tissue against chemical oxidation. In coffee oil from green coffee beans the diterpenes are esterified with saturated long chain fatty acids.|$|E
500|$|This {{fairly large}} puffball is edible {{only when the}} spore bearing flesh is young, and white. It is said to lack texture, and the taste and odor of the young fruiting bodies are {{described}} as [...] "not distinctive". A 2007 study of the fatty acid composition of various edible Lycoperdaceae species determined the lipid content of H.utriformis to be quite low, approximately 1.8% (wet weight). The fatty acid content was largely linoleic acid (42.4%), oleic acid (23%), palmitic acid (12.2%), and <b>stearic</b> acid (3.6%); 17 other fatty acids of various chain lengths and degrees of unsaturation contributed to the total fatty acid composition.|$|E
500|$|Young, uninjured fruit {{bodies of}} L.deterrimus have sesquiterpenoides {{in the form}} of fatty acid dihydroazulene-esters. About 85% of the yellow-coloured dihydroazulene are esterified with <b>stearic</b> acid and about 15% with {{linoleic}} acid. If the fruit body is injured, the free sesquiterpene [...] – a dihydroazulene alcohol – is released enzymatically. Several products are produced from it through oxidation: the yellow-coloured aldehyde delicial (1-formyl-6, 7-dihydro-4-methyl-7-isopropenylazulene), the purple-coloured aldehyde lactarovioline (1-formyl-4-methyl-7-isopropenylazulene), and the blue-coloured alcohol deterrol (1-hydroxymethyl-4-methyl-7-isopropenylazulene). The milk is first maroon through mixing with the different colours and discolours green. The dihydroazulene alcohol and delicial are unstable compounds, which react to form further products. Delicial polymerises particularly slight.|$|E
500|$|The {{latissimus dorsi}} muscle of the {{springbok}} comprises 1.1–1.3% ash, 1.3–3.5% fat, 72–75% moisture and 18–22% protein. <b>Stearic</b> acid {{is the main}} fatty acid, accounting for 24–27% of the fatty acids. The cholesterol content varies from [...] per [...] of meat. The pH of the meat increases if the springbok is under stress or cropping is done improperly; consequently, the quality deteriorates and the colour darkens. The meat might be adversely affected if the animal is killed by shooting. The meat may be consumed raw or used in prepared dishes. Biltong can be prepared by preserving the raw meat with vinegar, spices, and table salt, without fermentation, followed by drying. Springbok meat may also be used in preparing salami; a {{study found that the}} flavour of this salami is better than mutton salami, and feels oilier than salami of beef, horse meat, or mutton.|$|E
500|$|The meat of {{a five-year-old}} {{dromedary}} has a typical composition of 76% water, 22% protein, 1% fat, and 1% ash.

500|$|Lycoperdon perlatum is {{considered}} to be a good edible mushroom when young, when the gleba is still homogeneous and white. [...] They have been referred to as [...] "poor man's sweetbread" [...] due to their texture and flavor. The fruit bodies can be eaten after slicing and frying in batter or egg and breadcrumbs, or used in soups as a substitute for dumplings. As early as 1861, Elias Fries recommended them dried and served with salt, pepper, and oil. The puffballs become inedible as they mature: the gleba becomes yellow-tinged then finally develops into a mass of powdery olive-green spores. L.perlatum is one of several edible species sold in markets in the Mexican states of Puebla and Tlaxcala. The fruit bodies are appealing to other animals as well: the northern flying squirrel (Glaucomys sabrinus) includes the puffball in their diet of non-truffle fungi, while the [...] "puffball beetle" [...] Caenocara subglobosum uses the fruit body for shelter and breeding. Nutritional analysis indicates that the puffballs are a good source of protein, carbohydrates, fats, and several micronutrients. The predominant fatty acids in the puffball are linoleic acid (37% of the total fatty acids), oleic acid (24%), palmitic acid (14.5%), and <b>stearic</b> acid (6.4%).|$|E
