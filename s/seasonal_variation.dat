40|$|Introduction Stem CO 2 efflux (E s) is a {{significant}} component of total ecosystem respiration, but there is only scant information on <b>seasonal</b> <b>variations</b> in E s in tropical rainforests and on the main factors explaining these variations. • Methods We conducted a comprehensive 18 -month study in French Guiana to try to better understand which environmental factors contribute to <b>seasonal</b> <b>variations</b> in E s in two habitats differing in soil water conditions. • Results In both habitats, large <b>seasonal</b> <b>variations</b> in E s were observed for most trees. The main variations occurred during climatic transition periods and were consistent with <b>seasonal</b> <b>variations</b> in soil and total ecosystem respiration. • Discussion <b>Seasonal</b> <b>variations</b> in atmospheric conditions, including air temperature, did not explain <b>seasonal</b> <b>variations</b> in E s. In contrast, <b>seasonal</b> <b>variations</b> in surface soil water content clearly induced <b>seasonal</b> <b>variations</b> in E s in each habitat. Both soil drought and flooded conditions induced a decrease in E s. • Conclusion Our results emphasize the need to integrate the influence of soil water content on E s into global models that simulate the response of forest ecosystem fluxes to climate changes...|$|R

Altogether 21 CRY 1 and 16 CRY 2 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped and analyzed in 5910 individuals from a Finnish nationwide population-based sample who had filled in the self-report on the <b>seasonal</b> <b>variations</b> in mood and behavior in the year 2000. In the year 2011, 3356 of these individuals filled in the same self-report on the <b>seasonal</b> <b>variations</b> in mood and behavior. Regression models were used to test whether any of the SNPs associated with the problematicity of <b>seasonal</b> <b>variations</b> or with {{a change in the}} problematicity from 2000 to 2011. In the longitudinal analysis, CRY 2 SNP rs 61884508 was protective from worsening of problematicity of <b>seasonal</b> <b>variations.</b> In the cross-sectional analysis, CRY 2 SNP rs 72902437 showed evidence of association with problematicity of <b>seasonal</b> <b>variations,</b> as did SNP rs 1554338 (in the MAPK 8 IP 1 and downstream of CRY 2).

5|$|Smallpox {{is highly}} contagious, but {{generally}} spreads more slowly and less widely {{than some other}} viral diseases, perhaps because transmission requires close contact and occurs after {{the onset of the}} rash.

In tropical areas, <b>seasonal</b> <b>variation</b> was less evident and the disease was present throughout the year. Age distribution of smallpox infections depends on acquired immunity. Vaccination immunity declines over time and is probably lost within thirty years. Smallpox is not known to be transmitted by insects or animals and there is no asymptomatic carrier state.|$|E

40|$|Surface urban heat island (SUHI) in {{the context}} of {{urbanization}} has gained much attention in recent decades; however, the <b>seasonal</b> <b>variations</b> of SUHI and their drivers are still not well documented. In this study, the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) urban agglomeration, one of the most typical areas experiencing drastic urbanization in China, was selected to study the SUHI intensity (SUHII) based on remotely sensed land surface temperature (LST) data. Pure and unchanged urban and rural pixels from 2000 to 2010 were chosen to avoid non-concurrency between land cover data and LST data and to estimate daytime and nighttime thermal effects of urbanization. Different patterns of the <b>seasonal</b> <b>variations</b> were found in daytime and nighttime SUHIIs. Specifically, the daytime SUHII in summer (4 °C) was more evident than in other seasons while a cold island phenomenon was found in winter; the nighttime SUHII was always positive and higher than the daytime one in all the seasons except summer. Moreover, we found the highest daytime SUHII in August, which is the growing peak stage of summer maize, while nighttime SUHII showed a trough in the same month. <b>Seasonal</b> <b>variations</b> of daytime SUHII showed higher significant correlations with the <b>seasonal</b> <b>variations</b> of ∆LAI (leaf area index) (R 2 = 0. 81, r = − 0. 90) compared with ∆albedo (R 2 = 0. 61, r = − 0. 78) and background daytime LST (R 2 = 0. 69, r = 0. 83); moreover, agricultural practices (double-cropping system) {{played an important role in}} the <b>seasonal</b> <b>variations</b> of daytime SUHII. <b>Seasonal</b> <b>variations</b> of the nighttime SUHII did not show significant correlations with either of <b>seasonal</b> <b>variations</b> of ∆LAI, ∆albedo, and background nighttime LST, which implies different mechanisms in nighttime SUHII variation needing future studies...|$|R

5|$|Solar power {{tends to}} be {{complementary}} to wind.

5|$|All post-1638 depictions {{appear to}} be based on earlier images, around the time reports {{mentioning}} dodos became rarer. Differences in the depictions led authors such as Anthonie Cornelis Oudemans and Masauji Hachisuka to speculate about sexual dimorphism, ontogenic traits, <b>seasonal</b> <b>variation,</b> and even the existence of different species, but these theories are not accepted today. Because details such as markings of the beak, the form of the tail feathers, and colouration vary from account to account, it is impossible to determine the exact morphology of these features, whether they signal age or sex, or if they even reflect reality. Dodo specialist Julian Hume argued that the nostrils of the living dodo would have been slits, as seen in the Gelderland, Cornelis Saftleven, Crocker Art Gallery, and Ustad Mansur images. According to this claim, the gaping nostrils often seen in paintings indicate that taxidermy specimens were used as models. Most depictions show that the wings were held in an extended position, unlike flighted pigeons, but similar to ratites such as the ostrich and kiwi.|$|E
5|$|Maraba {{coffee is}} {{grown in the}} south of Rwanda at {{coordinates}} , roughly 12kilometres (7mi) from Butare and 150kilometres (93mi) from the capital, Kigali. The project began in the Maraba District of Butare Province, but these entities were replaced under local government organisation in 2006, and the area is now part of Huye District in the Southern Province. The area is very hilly, due to its proximity to the Western Rift Valley and the montane Nyungwe Forest, and features rich volcanic soils. The coffee is grown at altitudes between 1,700 and 2,100 metres (5,577–6,889ft) above sea level, often on steep hillsides with terrace farming. The area experiences an average of 115centimetres (45in) of rainfall annually. The majority of this falls during the rainy season of March to May, the major coffee harvesting season. The high altitude lowers the temperature slightly to an average of about 20 °C (68 °F). There is little <b>seasonal</b> <b>variation.</b>|$|E
5|$|Observations of the Rodrigues {{solitaire}} in life {{indicate that}} they were highly territorial.

It has also been suggested that these fractures {{may have been the}} result of a hereditary bone disease rather than battle-injuries. But in all extant birds where carpal spurs and knobs are present, these are used as weapons without exceptions. Though some dodo bones have been found with healed fractures, it had weak pectoral muscles and more reduced wings in comparison with the Rodrigues solitaire. Since Rodrigues receives less rainfall and has more <b>seasonal</b> <b>variation</b> than Mauritius, which would have affected the availability of resources on the island, the Rodrigues solitaire would have more reason to evolve aggressive territorial behaviour. Several accounts state that they also defended themselves with a powerful bite.|$|E

5|$|The {{life-cycle}} of the phumdis {{has generally}} been subject to <b>seasonal</b> <b>variation.</b> During the monsoon season when the water level is high, the phumdis float, but during the dry season, as the water level falls, the phumdis touch the lake bed and absorb nutrients from it. When the wet season returns, they again float, and the biomass, which has enough nutrients stored in the plants' roots, survives. However, the contemporary situation, with high water levels in the lake throughout the year, has meant {{that the process of}} 'feeding' on lakebottom nutrients has been seriously disturbed, resulting in a loss of biomass and a thinning of the islands each year. In January 1999, it was reported that a large section of phumdi in the north of the park had shattered into pieces and drifted away from the park area, threatening the habitat of the sangai.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} of the {{behaviour}} of the dodo, as most contemporary descriptions are very brief. Based on weight estimates, {{it has been suggested}} the male could reach the age of 21, and the female 17. Studies of the cantilever strength of its leg bones indicate that it could run quite fast. The legs were robust and strong to support the bulk of the bird, and also made it agile and manoeuvrable in the dense, pre-human landscape. Though the wings were small, well-developed muscle scars on the bones show that they were not completely vestigial, and may have been used for display behaviour and balance; extant pigeons also use their wings for such purposes. Unlike the Rodrigues solitaire, {{there is no evidence that}} the dodo used its wings in intraspecific combat. Though some dodo bones have been found with healed fractures, it had weak pectoral muscles and more reduced wings in comparison. The dodo may instead have used its large, hooked beak in territorial disputes. Since Mauritius receives more rainfall and has less <b>seasonal</b> <b>variation</b> than Rodrigues, which would have affected the availability of resources on the island, the dodo would have less reason to evolve aggressive territorial behaviour. The Rodrigues solitaire was therefore probably the more aggressive of the two.|$|E
5|$|Planets {{also have}} {{varying degrees of}} axial tilt; they lie {{at an angle to}} the plane of their stars' equators. This causes the amount of light {{received}} by each hemisphere to vary over the course of its year; when the northern hemisphere points away from its star, the southern hemisphere points towards it, and vice versa. Each planet therefore has seasons, changes to the climate over the course of its year. The time at which each hemisphere points farthest or nearest from its star is known as its solstice. Each planet has two in the course of its orbit; when one hemisphere has its summer solstice, when its day is longest, the other has its winter solstice, when its day is shortest. The varying amount of light and heat received by each hemisphere creates annual changes in weather patterns for each half of the planet. Jupiter's axial tilt is very small, so its <b>seasonal</b> <b>variation</b> is minimal; Uranus, on the other hand, has an axial tilt so extreme it is virtually on its side, which means that its hemispheres are either perpetually in sunlight or perpetually in darkness around the time of its solstices. Among extrasolar planets, axial tilts are not known for certain, though most hot Jupiters are believed to have negligible to no axial tilt {{as a result of their}} proximity to their stars.|$|E
