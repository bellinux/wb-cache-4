40|$|AbstractThe Norwegian {{coastline}} is rugged {{with long}} fjords, and exposed to wind and waves from the North Sea. The fjords represent barriers to crossing traffic, and thus also to industrial {{growth in the}} coastal regions. Because of the many ferry connections in coastal regions, the Norwegian Public Roads Administration has always been searching {{for new ways to}} cross the fjords by fixed connections. During the last years limits have been stretched with regard to the use of slender suspension bridges as well as long and deep sub sea rock tunnels. However, there are still many ferry connections left. These are the most extreme fjord crossings, where existing bridge building technology has to be developed further, and in addition, new knowledge and experience from offshore technology turns out to be of great importance. To develop new alternative fjord crossing methods, the Norwegian Public Roads Administration, Western Region, has organized a conceptual feasibility study of how to cross the wide and extremely deep Sognefjord. The experience from this study will be of great value to other fjord crossing projects as well. In addition, the study may be of interest to projects in scenic inland lake areas and urban waterfront areas. The feasibility study focuses on crossing alternatives based on the use of water as a bearing element of the bridge structures. It includes different crossing methods such as suspension bridges, <b>floating</b> bridges, <b>submerged</b> <b>floating</b> <b>tunnels</b> (SFT), and combinations of these. The results from these studies, with focus on the use of <b>submerged</b> <b>floating</b> <b>tunnels,</b> as seen from the owners point of view are discussed in the paper.

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, a {{numerical}} analysis is performed {{to investigate the}} dynamic characteristics of <b>submerged</b> <b>floating</b> <b>tunnels</b> (SFTs) under seismic wave passage effect. The large mass method is examined firstly and then used to simulate numerically the dynamic response of SFTs. It is found that the dynamic response of SFTs is influenced remarkably by the multi-support excitation with the seismic wave passage effect and varies with the velocity of seismic waves in a non-monotone way. The numerical {{results show that the}} response under the multi-support excitation is much larger than that under the simultaneous excitation except for the displacement response in some velocities, and there exists a peak velocity of seismic waves that corresponds the maximum response of the structure. In addition, for every velocity, the most remarkable response appears near the shore connection corresponding to output end of the seismic wave. This finding reflects the unique behavior of SFTs under the multi-support excitations and is meaningful to the seismic design of SFTs as well as other periodic long-span structures...|$|R

For the realization of SFT, the structural response under extreme environmental conditions needs to be evaluated properly. This study evaluates the displacements and internal forces of SFT under hydrodynamic and three-dimensional seismic excitations to check the global performance of an SFT in order to conclude on the optimum design. The formulations incorporate modeling of ocean waves, currents and mooring cables.

40|$|In {{this work}} the {{activity}} of the research group active at Politecnico di Milano in the field of the dynamic behavior of <b>Submerged</b> <b>Floating</b> <b>Tunnels</b> (SFTs) is reviewed, with emphasis on the possibility to mitigate the dynamic response through structural control solutions and the modeling of seaquake effects. A SFT model, equipped with suitable passive control devices, is accounted as a case study to assess the vibration mitigation under strong seismic motions. Elastic-plastic axial springs restrain the tunnel at the shores, and bars made of inelastic material anchor the tunnel to the seabed. Earthquake and seaquake motions are introduced accounting for spatial variability of the seabed motion during an earthquake. Some conclusions are drawn from a comparison between the response of the case study SFT due to earthquake and earthquake plus seaquake, which point out as seaquake forces can be an important source of excitation for SFTs. The paucity of studies on this topic, as well as the extent of the effects induced, call for further researches and developments. © 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

This consists of a distributed ‘aerodynamic’ mass which is connected to the structural element and to a fixed reference system by distributed non linear spring-dashpot elements. Governing equations of motion are obtained substituting Galerkin-type decomposition of both the structure and the aerodynamic mass displacements; global equations of motion are integrated by a step-by-step procedure based on the Newmark method.
