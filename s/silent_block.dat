25|$|Primary {{stuttering}} {{behaviors are}} the overt, observable signs of speech disfluencies, including repeating sounds, syllables, words or phrases, <b>silent</b> <b>blocks</b> and prolongation of sounds. These {{differ from the}} normal dysfluencies found in all speakers in that stuttering dysfluencies may last longer, occur more frequently, and are produced with more effort and strain. Stuttering dysfluencies also vary in quality: common dysfluencies tend to be repeated movements, fixed postures, or superfluous behaviors. Each of these three categories is composed of subgroups of stutters and dysfluencies.|$|R

Time-frequency analyses, psychoacoustic metrics and models were applied to the Sound Pressure Level (SPL) time functions of the raw microphone signals and compared with threshold values from the literature. Scalar parameters quantifying the electric motor steadiness were also computed to characterize the noise excitation source while accelerometer signals were analysed in the frequency domain to extract modal parameters.

40|$|Research has {{demonstrated}} that the human cognitive system allocates attention most efficiently to a stimulus that occurs in synchrony with an established rhythmic background. However, our environment is dynamic and constantly changing. What happens when rhythms to which our cognitive system adapted disappear? We addressed this question using a visual categorization task comprising emotional and neutral faces. The task was split into three blocks of which {{the first and the}} last were completed in silence. The second block was accompanied by an acoustic background rhythm that, for one group of participants, was synchronous with face presentations, and for another group was asynchronous. Irrespective of group, performance improved with background stimulation. Importantly, improved performance extended into the third <b>silent</b> <b>block</b> for the synchronous, but not for the asynchronous group. These data suggest that attentional entrainment resulting from rhythmic environmental regularities disintegrates only gradually after the regularities disappear...|$|E

40|$|Modelling {{the dynamic}} {{performance}} of an elevator car system represents a complex task and forms {{an important step}} in the elevator system design procedure. The need to consider the behaviour of passengers travelling in the car complicates the procedure further. This paper presents an original approach to identify the stiffness and damping characteristics of an elevator car system in order to investigate the effect of passenger load on the dynamic response. A simplified model is developed and the experimental rig with a rectangular elevator platform fixed on the top of four <b>silent</b> <b>blocks</b> attached to a shaker is setup. The transmissibility measurements are carried out with a harmonic excitation applied first to a platform with no passenger load and then to the platform with one passenger within the frequency range of 1 – 20 Hz. A single person standing on the platform is employed in order to assess the passenger’s contribution to the dynamic behaviour of the elevator car system. Curve fitting technique implemented in MATLAB is used to determine the damping and stiffness coefficients both for the empty car system and the car-passenger system. Investigation on the tolerances for both parameters is carried out. An approach to simplify the experimental procedure and {{to reduce the number of}} individual tests is proposed...|$|R

40|$|Developmental {{stuttering}} is {{a speech}} disorder in fluency characterized by repetitions, prolongations and <b>silent</b> <b>blocks,</b> {{especially in the}} initial parts of utterances. Although their symptoms are motor related, people who stutter show abnormal patterns of cerebral hemispheric dominance in both anterior and posterior language areas. It is unknown whether the abnormal functional lateralization in the posterior language area starts during childhood or emerges {{as a consequence of}} many years of stuttering. In order to address this issue, we measured the lateralization of hemodynamic responses in the auditory cortex during auditory speech processing in adults and children who stutter, including preschoolers, with near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). We used the analysis-resynthesis technique to prepare two types of stimuli: (i) a phonemic contrast embedded in Japanese spoken words (/itta/ vs. /itte/) and (ii) a prosodic contrast (/itta/ vs. /itta?/). In the baseline blocks, only /itta/ tokens were presented. In phonemic contrast blocks, /itta/ and /itte/ tokens were presented pseudo-randomly, and /itta/ and /itta?/ tokens in prosodic contrast blocks. In adults and children who do not stutter, there was a clear left-hemispheric advantage for the phonemic contrast compared to the prosodic contrast. Adults and children who stutter, however, showed {{no significant difference between the}} two stimulus conditions. A subject-by-subject analysis revealed that not a single subject who stutters showed a left advantage in the phonemic contrast over the prosodic contrast condition. These results indicate that the functional lateralization for auditory speech processing is in disarray among those who stutter, even at preschool age. These results shed light on the neural pathophysiology of developmental stuttering...|$|R
40|$|Agricultural {{operators}} run a {{very high}} risk of exposure to mechanical vibration. To improve comfort, many different devices have recently been fitted to agricultural self-propelled machinery, especially on the most modern high-powered wheeled tractors. In contrast, agricultural tracklaying tractors are not equipped with a suspended cab floor and frequently poor or no seat suspension is fitted. Consequently, the levels of vibration measured in the driving seat of tracklaying tractors often widely exceed the limit stipulated by official national standards. The manufacturers of tracklaying tractors are currently trying to improve the level of comfort at the driver’s place by reducing both the production and the transmission of vibration. The vibration levels at the driving seat {{of a group of}} tracklaying tractors produced by some leading Italian manufacturers were so measured. The models examined in the study differed in having either 5 - or 6 -roller track support, different types and stiffness of seat suspension, and in {{whether or not they were}} coupled to an implement. The type of seat suspension, and above all its correct adjustment, dramatically influenced the level of vibration, as did the increase in the number of track rollers. In contrast, whether or not the tractor was coupled to an implement at the rear 3 -point linkage did not make any significant change to the vibration comfort during transport. Also on the best modern trackalying tractor models, vibration levels frequently exceed stipulated limits, so that a further reduction is urgently required. Possible solutions that could be developed may involve the universal adoption of rubber tracks and/or the fitting of <b>silent</b> <b>blocks</b> on the cab floor and suspension devices on one or both axles...|$|R
40|$|Stuttering, {{a disease}} process that hasnumerous academic, social, and oc-cupational implications, is {{described}} by the most recent version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disor-ders, revised 4 th edition, as a “distur-bance in the normal fluency and time patterning of speech, characterized by frequent occurrences {{of one or more}} of the following: sound and syllable repeti-tions, sound prolongations, interjections, broken words, audible or <b>silent</b> <b>blocking,</b> circumlocutions, words produced with an excess of physical tension, and mono-syllabic whole-word repetitions. ” 1 - 7 The disease process tends to begin between ages 3 and 8 years, but can present at any age. 8 Roughly 60 - 75 % of stuttering cas-es remit by adolescence; however, about 1 % of affected individuals can have a stutter continuing into adulthood. 4, 6, 9, 10 Stuttering is historically divided into 2 categories; developmental and ac-quired. 2, 3, 9, 11 Developmental stuttering, also known as common stuttering, tends to occur in childhood and is much more common in males. 2, 9 Acquired stuttering can occur at any age and is associated with an impairment of brain function such as trauma, stroke, medication ad-verse effect, tumor, or psychogenic effect; it has a more equal sex distribution. 2, 3, 9, 12 There are numerous theories that explain the etiology of developmental stutter. Most experts believe that it is the re-sult of a variety of neurotransmitter abnormalities in spe-cific areas of the brain. 8, 12 One of the most commonly ac-cepted theories revolves around an excess of dopa-mine. 4, 6, 13, 14 This hypothesis is supported by the clinical findings that dopamine antagonists such as antipsychotics tend to help stuttering, while dopamine agonists such as amphetamines tend to stimulate stuttering. 6, 13 One study found an increase in 6 -[(18) F]fluoro-l-dopa (FDOPA) up-take in the medial prefrontal cortex and limbic structures of stutterers. 13 Through the use of positron emission tomo-graphy, the uptake of FDOPA is correlated with dopamin...|$|R

40|$|Trypanosoma brucei mono-allelically expresses one of {{approximately}} 1500 {{variant surface glycoprotein}} (VSG) genes while multiplying in the mammalian bloodstream. The active VSG is transcribed by RNA polymerase I in one {{of approximately}} 15 telomeric VSG expression sites (ESs). T. brucei is unusual in controlling gene expression predominantly post-transcriptionally, and how ESs are mono-allelically controlled remains a mystery. Here we identify a novel transcription regulator, which resembles a nucleoplasmin-like protein (NLP) with an AT-hook motif. NLP is key for ES control in bloodstream form T. [*]brucei, as NLP knockdown results in 45 - to 65 -fold derepression of the silent VSG 221 ES. NLP is also involved in repression of transcription in the inactive VSG Basic Copy arrays, minichromosomes and procyclin loci.

The objectives {{of this study are}} to identify and describe (1) the types of dysfluencies, (2) the types of associated behaviors, and (3) the kinds of treatments experienced by the stuttering character in Rocket Science. The study was a descriptive qualitative study with the researcher as the main instrument and the data sheets as the secondary instrument. The object of this research was the stuttering character’s utterances in Rocket Science. The data were utterances in the form of words, phrases, clauses, and sentences of the character containing and reflecting the phenomenon of stuttering. Another data source was the script of the movie. After being collected, the data were categorized and analyzed based on each category in psycholinguistic study. To enhance the trustworthiness of the data in this study, theory and researcher triangulations were applied. The result of the research shows three important points. First, {{there are two types of}} speech dysfluencies, namely between-word dysfluencies and within word dysfluencies. In between-word dysfluencies, there are interjections, multisyllabic whole-word repetitions, revisions, and phrase repetitions. Then in within-word dysfluencies, there are <b>blocks</b> (<b>silent</b> pauses), monosyllabic whole-word repetitions, and repetitions of individual sounds and syllables. Interjections can rank as the highest phenomenon in between-word dysfluencies because it is the most usual type of dysfluencies. Even, normal people sometimes experience Interjections to delay the initiation of a word the speaker expects to get stuck on. Meanwhile, <b>blocks</b> (<b>silent</b> pauses) in within-word dysfluencies can rank as the highest phenomenon because it is also the most usual type of dysfluencies too; even normal people sometimes experience <b>blocks</b> (<b>silent</b> pauses). Then, there are four types of associated behaviors of a stuttering person, namely eye behaviors, visible muscle tension, head, torso, and limb movement, and audible inhalations or exhalations. Eye behaviors can rank as the highest phenomenon in the associated behaviors of stuttering because this phenomenon is the earliest and most frequently observed associated behaviors that typically involve the eyes. Some of the more common eye behaviors are blinking, squeezing the eyes shut during moments of stuttering, side to-side movements of the eyes, and consistent loss of eye contact with the listener during instances of types of speech dysfluencies. The last, there are three kinds of treatments experienced by the stuttering character in Rocket Science. They are manuevers that can induce fluency, cognitive-behavioral therapy, and speech therapy. In addition, for the stuttering character, the implementations of those treatments are successful enough in overcoming the stuttering although the film shows that the treatments just can help Hal induce his fluency, not to make him recover from his stuttering...|$|R
