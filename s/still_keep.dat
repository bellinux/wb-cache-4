5|$|May is 13, but {{she knows}} nothing, is unable to talk fluently, nor walk with ease due to for her bandy legs. Her father is dead and she has four elder brothers, all mentally retarded... The {{students}} are all disabled, retarded and of different ages. Teaching them is a hard job. They are of the 3rd grade {{but many of them}} find it hard to do the reading. Only a few of them can. Their pronunciation is distorted due to their twisted lips and their memory is quite short. They easily forget what they've learned... In the Village, it is quite hard to tell the kids' exact ages. Some in their twenties have a physical statures as small as the 7- or 8-years-old. They find it difficult to feed themselves, much less have mental ability or physical capacity for work. No one can hold back the tears when seeing the heads turning round unconsciously, the bandy arms managing to push the spoon of food into the mouths with awful difficulty... Yet they <b>still</b> <b>keep</b> smiling, singing in their great innocence, at the presence of some visitors, craving for something beautiful.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{plan from}} 1995 {{involved}} two intermediate stations, at Vevelstad and Kolbotn. The plans also suggested building {{the line in}} two phases, first between Ski and Kolbotn, and then from Kolbotn to Oslo. In 2008, the National Rail Administration announced two possible plans for the right-of-way—both predominantly in tunnel. The one proposal included Kolbotn, the other did not. Both excluded Vevelstad as a station on the new line, since the station could not develop as a hub, and would <b>still</b> <b>keep</b> services along the existing commuter line. A report from Det Norske Veritas published in 2008, and ordered by the Rail Administration, concluded that neither a station at Vevelstad or at Kolbotn could support the extra cost of construction. A direct line with no intermediate stops is estimated to cost NOK 11 billion, while a line via Kolbotn would cost 13.5 billion. The report also argued that the intermediate stops would decrease capacity and increase travel time for all passengers departing south of Ski and traveling north. The exclusion of Kolbotn would also increase the importance of Ski as a regional public transport hub. In 2009, the Rail Administration abandoned the plans to build the line via Kolbotn, stating {{that it was more}} important to secure a fast connection to Ski. At the same time, they promised to upgrade the existing station at Kolbotn.|$|E

25|$|May Day {{has been}} celebrated in Ireland since pagan times as {{the feast of}} Beltane (Bealtaine) and in latter times as Mary's day. Traditionally, bonfires were lit to mark the coming of summer and to banish the long nights of winter. Officially Irish May Day holiday is the first Monday in May. Old traditions such as bonfires are no longer widely observed, though the {{practice}} still persists in some places across the country. Limerick, Clare and many other people in other counties <b>still</b> <b>keep</b> on this tradition, including areas in Dublin city such as Ringsend.|$|E
25|$|After the biceps-to-triceps surgery the patient’s arm is immobilized for 3,5 {{weeks in}} slight flexion, this only counts for patient who could fully extend their arm before the operation. Otherwise {{the patient is}} immobilized in maximum {{extension}} and casted. This stays on for 10–14 days and a second cast is applied in further extension. After the immobilization the patient is given a protective polyaxial brace, which allows the patient to begin active limited flexion and <b>still</b> <b>keep</b> the full extension. This brace is worn by day and at night the patient wears a semi-firm splint that keeps the arm in maximal extension.|$|E

25|$|Although easy to ride slowly {{because of}} their high center of mass and the {{inverted}} pendulum effect, the penny-farthing is prone to accidents. To stop, the rider presses back on the pedals while applying a spoon-shaped brake pressing the tire. The center of mass being high and not far behind the front wheel means any sudden stop or collision with a pothole or other obstruction can send the rider over the handlebars. On long downhills, some riders hooked their feet over the handlebars. This made for quick descents but left no chance of stopping. A new type of handlebar was introduced, called Whatton bars, that looped behind the legs so that riders could <b>still</b> <b>keep</b> their feet on the pedals and {{also be able to}} leap forward feet-first off the machine.|$|E
25|$|Apicoplasts {{have lost}} all {{photosynthetic}} function, and contain no photosynthetic pigments or true thylakoids. They are bounded by four membranes, but the membranes {{are not connected}} to the endoplasmic reticulum. The fact that apicomplexans <b>still</b> <b>keep</b> their nonphotosynthetic chloroplast around demonstrates how the chloroplast carries out important functions other than photosynthesis. Plant chloroplasts provide plant cells with many important things besides sugar, and apicoplasts are no different—they synthesize fatty acids, isopentenyl pyrophosphate, iron-sulfur clusters, and carry out part of the heme pathway. This makes the apicoplast an attractive target for drugs to cure apicomplexan-related diseases. The most important apicoplast function is isopentenyl pyrophosphate synthesis—in fact, apicomplexans die when something interferes with this apicoplast function, and when apicomplexans are grown in an isopentenyl pyrophosphate-rich medium, they dump the organelle.|$|E

25|$|Many ethnic minorities, mostly Korean and Chinese, {{living in}} Japan adopt Japanese names. The roots of this custom {{go back to}} the colonial-era policy of sōshi-kaimei, which {{permitted}} many Koreans to change their names to Japanese names. Nowadays, ethnic minorities, mostly Korean, who immigrated to Japan after the WWII, take on Japanese names, sometimes called pass names, to ease communication and, more importantly, to avoid discrimination. A few of them (e.g., Han Chang-Woo, founder and chairman of Maruhan Corp., pronounced Kan Shōyū in Japanese) <b>still</b> <b>keep</b> their native names. Sometimes, however, these ethnic Chinese and Koreans in Japan who choose to renounce Permanent Resident status to apply for Japanese citizenship have to change the characters in their names, because not all characters are legally recognized in Japan for naming purposes.|$|E
25|$|The Gurjara-Pratihara {{came into}} power during the 7th century and founded a kyshatria dynasty in {{northern}} India which exceeded the preceding Gupta Empire. During this period, Emperor Nagabhata I (750–780 AD) and Mihir Bhoja I (836–890) commissioned various texts on martial arts, and were themselves practitioners of these systems. Shiva Dhanuveda was composed in this era. The khadga, a two-handed broad-tipped heavy longsword, was given special preference. It was even used for khadga-puja, ritualised {{worship of the}} sword. The Gurjara-Pratiharas continuously fought off Arab invasions, particularly during the Caliphate campaigns in India. The Arab chronicler Sulaiman wrote of the Gurjara ruler as the greatest foe to Islamic expansion, {{while at the same}} time praising his cavalry. The Gurjara people <b>still</b> <b>keep</b> up their tradition of gatka and kushti, and until today there are world-class wrestlers from the community competing at national and international levels.|$|E
