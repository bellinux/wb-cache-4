The invention in Germany of {{printing from movable type}} in a printing press c. 1440 was a great <b>stimulus</b> <b>to</b> herbalism. The new herbals were more detailed with greater general appeal and often with Gothic script and the addition of woodcut illustrations that more closely resembled the plants being described.|$|E

5|$|When bees become {{intoxicated}} from ethanol consumption or poisoned {{with other}} chemicals, their balance is affected, {{and they are}} wobbly when they walk. Charles Abramson's group at Oklahoma State University has put inebriated bees on running wheels, where they exhibit locomotion difficulties. They also put honey bees in shuttle-boxes that used a <b>stimulus</b> <b>to</b> encourage the bees to move, and found that they were less mobile as they became more intoxicated.|$|E

40|$|Social stimuli that {{function}} as reinforcers for most children {{generally do not}} function as reinforcers for children diagnosed with autism. These important social stimuli include smiles, head nods, thumb-ups, and okay signs. It should be an important goal of therapy for children with autism to condition these neutral social <b>stimuli</b> <b>to</b> function as reinforcers for children diagnosed with autism. There is empirical evidence to support both a pairing procedure (classical conditioning) and a discriminative <b>stimulus</b> procedure <b>to</b> condition neutral <b>stimuli</b> <b>to</b> function as reinforcers. However, {{there is no clear}} evidence as to the superiority of effectiveness for either procedure. Despite this most textbooks and curriculum guides for children with autism state only the pairing procedure <b>to</b> condition neutral <b>stimuli</b> <b>to</b> function as reinforcers. Recent studies suggest that the discriminative stimulus procedure may in fact be more effective in conditioning neutral <b>stimuli</b> <b>to</b> function as reinforcers for children diagnosed with autism. The present research is a further comparison of these two procedures. Results from one participant support recent findings that suggest the discriminative stimulus procedure is more effective in conditioning neutral <b>stimuli</b> <b>to</b> function as reinforcers. But the results from the other participant show no effects from either procedure, suggesting future research into conditions necessary to condition neutral social <b>stimuli</b> <b>to</b> function as reinforcers for children with autism...|$|R

5|$|A major <b>stimulus</b> <b>to</b> {{improving}} the {{accuracy and reliability}} of clocks was the importance of precise time-keeping for navigation. The position of a ship at sea could be determined with reasonable accuracy if a navigator could refer to a clock that lost or gained less than about 10 seconds per day. The marine chronometer would {{have to keep the}} time of a fixed location—usually Greenwich Mean Time—allowing seafarers to determine longitude by comparing the local high noon to the clock. This clock could not contain a pendulum, which would be virtually useless on a rocking ship.|$|E
5|$|A {{series of}} major bailouts were pursued during the {{financial}} crisis, starting on 7 September with {{the announcement that}} the U.S. Government was to nationalise the two government-sponsored enterprises which oversaw most of the U.S. subprime mortgage market – Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. In October, Alistair Darling, the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, referred to Keynes as he announced plans for substantial fiscal <b>stimulus</b> <b>to</b> head off the worst effects of recession, in accordance with Keynesian economic thought.

5|$|As {{with any}} war of such length, the {{drawn-out}} Byzantine–Arab Wars had long-lasting effects {{for both the}} Byzantine Empire and the Arab world. The Byzantines experienced extensive territorial loss, while the invading Arabs gained strong control in the Middle East and Africa. The focus of the Byzantine Empire shifted from the western reconquests of Justinian to a primarily defensive position, against the Islamic armies on its eastern borders. Without Byzantine interference in the emerging Christian states of western Europe, the situation gave a huge <b>stimulus</b> <b>to</b> feudalism and economic self-sufficiency.|$|E

5|$|Grand Theft Auto Online {{launched}} on 1 October 2013, {{two weeks after}} Grand Theft Auto Vs release. Many players reported connection difficulties and game freezes during load screens. Rockstar released a technical patch on 5 October {{in an effort to}} resolve the issues, but problems persisted the second week following launch as some players reported their character progress as having disappeared. Another technical patch was released on 10 October combating the issues and Rockstar offered a GTA$500,000 (in-game currency) <b>stimulus</b> <b>to</b> the accounts of all players connected to Online since launch as recompense. Because of the widespread technical issues present at launch, many reviewers bemoaned their Grand Theft Auto Online experience, but generally recognised its open-ended exploration and dynamic content as strengths.|$|E
5|$|In many {{accounts}} {{of the development of}} evolutionary theory, Wallace is mentioned only in passing as simply being the <b>stimulus</b> <b>to</b> the publication of Darwin's own theory. In reality, Wallace developed his own distinct evolutionary views which diverged from Darwin's, and was considered by many (especially Darwin) to be a leading thinker on evolution in his day, whose ideas could not be ignored. One historian of science has pointed out that, through both private correspondence and published works, Darwin and Wallace exchanged knowledge and stimulated each other's ideas and theories over an extended period. Wallace is the most-cited naturalist in Darwin's Descent of Man, occasionally in strong disagreement.|$|E
5|$|Unfortunately for the West India Company, {{the infant}} colony of New Netherland languished, the {{cautious}} Dutch people having very little inclination to emigrate to wild and uncultivated lands {{in which no}} substantial inducements were present. While the economic situation of the colony in the late 1620s {{could be considered a}} relatively good showing for a colony only newly started in a wilderness, its slow success was hardly sufficient to create much excitement among the directors of the West India Company. Within a few years, the Company realized that special measures which would afford a <b>stimulus</b> <b>to</b> colonization were indispensable.|$|E
