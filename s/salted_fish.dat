Salt was included among funeral offerings found in ancient Egyptian tombs from the third millennium BC, as were salted birds, and <b>salt</b> <b>fish.</b> From about 2800 BC, the Egyptians began exporting <b>salt</b> <b>fish</b> to the Phoenicians in return for Lebanon cedar, glass, and the dye Tyrian purple; the Phoenicians traded Egyptian <b>salt</b> <b>fish</b> and <b>salt</b> from North Africa throughout their Mediterranean trade empire.|$|R
5|$|The Sundanese author M.A.Salmoen classifies Joehana as a realist.

Joehana used real-life Bandung locations in his novels, and local figures prominent in the news (such as the pickpocket Salim) are mentioned in passing. There is also the possibility that the use of such names are a form of product placement, in which Joehana was paid to include the names of the products in his novels; this payment may not have been direct, but in the form of goods or services, or a donation to Sarekat Rakyat.|$|E
5|$|The main food staples in {{the diet}} of the lower classes {{remained}} rice, pork, and <b>salted</b> <b>fish.</b> Song restaurant and tavern menus are recorded which list entrées for feasts, banquets, festivals, and carnivals.

5|$|Poole {{established}} successful commerce {{with the}} North American colonies in the 16th century, including the important fisheries of Newfoundland. Trade with Newfoundland grew steadily {{to meet the}} demand for fish from the Catholic countries of Europe. Poole's share of this trade varied but the most prosperous period started in the early 18th century and lasted until the early 19th century. The trade followed a three-cornered route; ships sailed to Newfoundland with salt and provisions, then carried dried and <b>salted</b> <b>fish</b> to Europe before returning to Poole with wine, olive oil, and salt. By the early 18th century Poole had more ships trading with North America than any other English port and vast wealth was brought to Poole's merchants. This prosperity supported much of the development which now characterises the Old Town where many of the medieval buildings were replaced with Georgian mansions and terraced housing. The end of the Napoleonic Wars and the conclusion of the War of 1812 ended Britain's monopoly over the Newfoundland fisheries and other nations took over services provided by Poole's merchants at a lower cost. Poole's Newfoundland trade rapidly declined and within a decade most merchants had ceased trading.|$|E
