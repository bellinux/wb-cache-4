50|$|The first FGD is {{composed}} of 30 layers of 192 segmented scintillating bars, alternating between vertical and horizontal layers, while the second FGD {{is composed}} of 14 alternating layers of segmented scintillating bars and 6 water modules. Each bar has a hole down the center containing a WaveLength Shifting fiber which collects some of the light from scintillation and is read out by a MPPC at one end. The {{other end of the}} fiber is mirrored with aluminum in order to increase overall light yield reaching the MPPC. The mirrored end also has an LED light injection system for calibration and testing the integrity of the fibers. The second FGD is partially composed of water because the detector at Super-Kamiokande is water-based. This water is maintained under <b>subatmospheric</b> pressure to ensure that in case of a leak air will be sucked in rather than water spill out inside the FGD.

50|$|This {{system is}} {{especially}} {{significant in the}} kidneys, where the glomerular filtration rate (the rate of blood filtration by the nephron) is particularly sensitive to changes in blood pressure. However, {{with the aid of}} the myogenic mechanism, the glomerular filtration rate remains very insensitive to changes in human blood pressure. Myogenic mechanisms in the kidney are part of the autoregulation mechanism which maintains a constant renal blood flow at varying arterial pressure. Concomitant autoregulation of glomerular pressure and filtration indicates regulation of preglomerular resistance. Model and experimental studies were performed to evaluate two mechanisms in the kidney, myogenic response and tubuloglomerular feedback. A mathematical model showed good autoregulation through a myogenic response, aimed at maintaining a constant wall tension in each segment of the preglomerular vessels. Tubuloglomerular feedback gave rather poor autoregulation. The myogenic mechanism showed 'descending' resistance changes, starting in the larger arteries, and successively affecting downstream preglomerular vessels at increasing arterial pressures. This finding was supported by micropuncture measurements of pressure in the terminal interlobular arteries. Evidence that the mechanism was myogenic was obtained by exposing the kidney to a <b>subatmospheric</b> pressure of 40 mmHg; this led to an immediate increase in renal resistance, which could not be prevented by denervation or various blocking agents.|$|E

40|$|Objective: This article {{reports the}} first {{application}} of <b>subatmospheric</b> pressure management to a deep, partial-thickness human thermal burn. Methods: After cleaning the wound, {{the decision was}} made to treat the hand and distal forearm with <b>subatmospheric</b> pressure (V. A. C., KCI, Inc, San Antonio, Tex). The sponge was applied directly to the burned skin without additional interface at approximately 6 hours after injury. The dressing was maintained at a continuous negative pressure of 125 mm Hg over the next 40 hours, with interruption only for routine clinical evaluation at 5, 16, and 24 hours after initiation of treatment. This was accomplished by opening the dressing without completely changing it. The treatment was tolerated well by the patient, requiring no excessive pain medication. After the <b>subatmospheric</b> pressure treatment was stopped, the wound appeared to be of indeterminate depth and the patient was started on twice daily applications of silver sulfadiazine. Results: The clinical impression at this time was that the hand burn had not progressed but had stabilized and had minimal edema. He was followed as an outpatient and returned to work by 8 weeks. At approximately 4 weeks postinjury, his skin not only was functional but also appeared more normal, with less hyperemia than adjacent areas treated with topical antibacterials. Conclusion: The present case does not prove that <b>subatmospheric</b> pressure treatment prevents burn wound progression. However, when combined with the previously reported laboratory studies it suggests the need for further research.

40|$|International audienceCompact {{evaporators}} like plate {{heat exchangers}} can {{play a significant role}} in reducing the investment cost of low cooling power sorption systems. If water is used as refrigerant, their design remains mainly empirical. The objective of this paper is thus to investigate the specific characteristics of water pool boiling in narrow channel at <b>subatmospheric</b> pressure in order to acquire the fundamental knowledge needed to improve the design of compact evaporators in these sorption systems. An experimental test setup was thus designed and built to study water pool boiling in narrow channel at <b>subatmospheric</b> pressure (from 5 to 1. 2 kPa) on a vertical heated copper disk. The influence of the thickness of the narrow channel and of the pressure on the heat transfer is discussed. As the pressure and the channel thickness decrease the occurrence of a specific <b>subatmospheric</b> pool boiling regime is observed, degrading heat transfer coefficient. Nevertheless, the general trends of evolution are in agreement with those generally observed in the literature: heat transfer is enhanced as the thickness of the narrow channel decreases but, depending on the pressure, decreasing too much the channel thickness could lead to a deterioration of the heat transfer coefficient. A particle image velocity (PIV) device was implemented to the experimental setup in order to highlight the effect of the wake-induced flow on the heat transfer...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{pressure}} {{distribution in}} a flat spiral groove thrust bearing obtained from a straightforward solution of the Reynolds equation includes <b>subatmospheric</b> pressure in part of the grooved area. This is masked in the common theory {{based on the assumption}} of an infinite number of grooves. Furthermore, the negative contribution to the load capacity from this area is usually small, which may explain why the presence of <b>subatmospheric</b> pressure has not been given much attention in connectionwith these bearings. <b>Subatmospheric</b> pressure is, however, necessary for liquid-lubricated flat spiral groove thrust bearings of conventional design to work at all at low numbers of grooves, which in turn requires a non-zero cavitation pressure. Cavitation within individual grooves implies non-linearity in, for example, the relation between load capacity and rotational speed of the bearing and limits the obtainable load capacity. This is more pronounced and important to consider at low numbers of grooves (wide grooves) than at high numbers of grooves (narrow grooves), {{and it is difficult to}} determine for what number of grooves that reliable prediction of bearing performance can be expected. It depends on the actual value of the cavitation pressure and other parameters that are usually unknown or difficult to account for. To avoid this disadvantage a modified design of liquid-lubricated flat spiral groove thrust bearings is suggested...|$|E

Additionally, a device that provides instantaneous volume buffer capacity during hypovolemia was evaluated in relation to GME appearance.

Arterial bubble activity appeared at <b>subatmospheric</b> venous line pressures of - 200 mm Hg and less. A rising (pO) increased formation of GME (P = 0. 05). A rise in hematocrit, in contrast, did not affect embolic activity (P = 0. 22). With simulated hypovolemia, volume buffer capacity added to the venous line dampened fluctuations of venous line pressure by approximately 40 %, but a significant reduction in GME formation could not be found (P = 0. 22). Moreover, the device enabled a 14 % higher support flow. With ELS flow being related to patient volume status, hypovolemia can diminish support. A coherent decrease of venous line pressure triggers degassing of blood-dissolved gases and causes arterial GME, which can become massive during persistent conditions of limited venous return.
