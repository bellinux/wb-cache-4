The application for this method is to help art historians to identify the <b>drawing</b> <b>tool</b> used for a drawing. Since {{the style of a}} drawing depends on the <b>drawing</b> <b>tool</b> used, <b>drawing</b> <b>tool</b> recognition is an important step toward a style analysis. A dominant feature of a drawn stroke is its ending. Several features regarding curvature, proportions etc. are calculated out of the shape of the endings. These features are then used to classify stroke endings with a SVM classifier. ...|$|R

40|$|Tool {{making is}} a very time {{consuming}} and expensive operation because many iteration loops are used to manually adjust tool components during the try-out process. That means that trying out deep <b>drawing</b> <b>tools</b> is 30 % of the total costs. This {{is the reason why}} an active deep <b>drawing</b> <b>tool</b> was developed at the Fraunhofer Institute for Machine Tools and Forming Technology IWU in cooperation with Audi and Volkswagen to reduce the costs and production rates. The main difference between the active and conventional deep <b>drawing</b> <b>tools</b> is using piezoelectric actuators to control the forming process. The active tool idea, which is the main subject of this research, will be presented as well as the findings of experiments with the custom-built deep <b>drawing</b> <b>tool.</b> This experimental tool was designed according to production requirements and has been equipped with piezoelectric actuators that allow active pressure distribution on the sheet metal flange. The disposed piezoelectric elements are similar to those being used in piezo injector systems for modern diesel engines. In order to achieve the required force, the actuators are combined in a cluster that is embedded in the die of the deep <b>drawing</b> <b>tool.</b> One main objective of this work, i. e. reducing the time-consuming try-out-period, has been achieved with the experimental tool which means that the actuators were used to set static pressure distribution between the blankholder and die. We will present the findings of our analysis and the advantages of the active system over a conventional deep <b>drawing</b> <b>tool.</b> In addition to the ability of changing the static pressure distribution, the piezoelectric actuator {{can also be used to}} generate a dynamic pressure distribution during the forming process. As a result the active tool has the potential to expand the forming constraints to make it possible to manage forming restrictions caused by light weight materials in future...|$|R

40|$|CAD systems help in design, {{constructing}} and modelling of garments with rapidity {{and extra}} accuracy. The apparel design is very specific with its various <b>drawing</b> <b>tools</b> and tools for modification in CAD systems. The maximal aid {{is possible only}} after the optimum use of tools. This paper presents a classification of <b>drawing</b> <b>tools</b> and tools for modification in connection with 2 D apparel design, construction and modelling. Key words: CAD, apparel design constructing, apparel design modelling PROBLEM STATEMENT CAD/CAM systems made their debut in the garment industry in the 1960 s, but design constructing and modelling are last automated stages 1 Apparel constructing and modelling are bi-dimensional (2 D) and three-dimensional (3 D). The present paper views the 2 D apparel design. Bi-dimensional constructing and modelling are based on traditional hand design of garments. The traditional hand methodologies are transformed for automated design in conformity with the <b>drawing</b> <b>tools</b> and tools for modification. A study of systems and publication about 2 D apparel design show different using of <b>tools</b> for <b>drawing</b> and modification. There is no concrete information about use of a fixed tool and why it is chosen. One and the same construction is drawn in CAD using of very different tools. The paper presents a classification of <b>drawing</b> <b>tools</b> and tools for modification in connection with 2 D apparel design constructing and modelling. The purpose of this classification is optimum using of tools for design of garment...|$|R

This contribution points out {{to the importance of}} FEM simulation of drawing process in order to verify the design of production technology of drawpiece with shape of welded on concave bottom on the basis of technological calculations. Simulation programme Deform verified the construction design of <b>drawing</b> <b>tool</b> determined for drawpiece production by first draw, and also determined the drawing force actually consumed during plastic deformation of drawpiece shape.
