5|$|Drakengard 2 {{takes place}} in an unnamed land nearly two decades after the events of Drakengard: {{originally}} said to take place after the game's first ending, it was later retconned <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>took</b> place in an isolated timeline following events similar to Drakengard. In the original game, two powers, the Empire and the Union, {{were engaged in a}} religious war over the Seals, magical bindings tied to a chosen Goddess of the Seal that kept dark entities known as the Watchers from appearing in the mortal world and destroying humanity. Caught up in the conflict were Caim and Angelus, a human and a dragon who had made a pact (a magical ritual that linked their souls), and fought to try to keep both the Seals and the Goddess safe. Though they ultimately failed, Angelus became the new seal, averting the end of the world. Eighteen years later, the Seals are protected by the Knights of the Seal, who eventually grow to become a dominating force in the land.|$|E
5|$|The German Imperial Navy (Kaiserliche Marine) ordered Westfalen {{under the}} {{provisional}} name Ersatz Sachsen {{as a replacement}} for , the lead ship of the elderly s. The Reichstag secretly approved and provided funds for Nassau and Westfalen at the end of March 1906, but construction on Westfalen was delayed while arms and armor were procured. She was laid down on 12 August 1907 at the AG Weser shipyard in Bremen. As with her sister , construction proceeded swiftly and secretly; detachments of soldiers guarded both the shipyard and the major contractors who supplied building materials, such as Krupp. The ship was launched on 1 July 1908, underwent an initial fitting-out, and then in mid-September 1909 was transferred to Kiel by a crew composed of dockyard workers for a final fitting-out. However, the water level in the Weser River was low at this time of year, so six pontoons had to be attached to the ship to reduce her draft. Even <b>so,</b> <b>it</b> <b>took</b> two attempts before the ship cleared the river.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} {{commissioned}} on 22 November {{and became the}} flagship of Flag Officer Josiah Tattnall, commander of the naval defenses of Georgia. Under pressure from Mallory to engage the blockading ships, Tattnall attempted to engage them before any ironclads arrived on 5 January 1863, but army engineers could not clear the obstacles blocking the channel in a timely manner, despite early coordination being made by Tattnall to do <b>so.</b> <b>It</b> <b>took</b> another month to actually clear the obstacles and two monitors arrived {{before the end of}} January. Nonetheless Tattnall attempted to pass through the obstructions during high tide on 3 February, but high winds prevented the water from rising enough to allow the ship to do so. After Atlanta successfully passed through them on 19 March, Tattnall planned to attack the Union base at Port Royal, South Carolina while the monitors were attacking Charleston. Deserters revealed Tatnall's plan while he was waiting at the head of Wassaw Sound and he was forced to retreat when three monitors augmented the defenses at Port Royal. Dissatisfied with Tattnall's perceived lack of aggressiveness, Mallory replaced Tattnall as commander of the Savannah squadron later that month with Commander Richard L. Page. Page, in his turn was relieved in May by Commander William A. Webb; Atlanta remained the squadron flagship throughout this time.|$|E

25|$|Victoria {{qualified}} for the final after their 8 wicket win against Western Australia in round 9 of the competition. Victoria secured a home tie in the final, with an innings victory against Queensland in round 10. However, the Melbourne Cricket Ground was unavailable for the fixture, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>took</b> place at Traeger Park in Alice Springs.

25|$|While the {{earthquake}} {{quickly became the}} only subject on talkback radio, other early coverage relied on comments from Police and other 24-hour services who were immediately affected and needed {{to communicate with the}} media. Because {{the earthquake}} occurred early on a Saturday morning, with only overnight staff on duty, it took several hours for some media outlets to give the event full live coverage. <b>So</b> <b>it</b> <b>took</b> until mid-morning for some media outlets to have sufficient stories and staff on duty to allow them to commence continuous live broadcasts. One television producer later observed that if the earthquake had happened just a few hours earlier, or later, they would have had a full studio crew on duty and have been able to go live immediately.|$|E
25|$|In 1597, Jesuits {{arrived in}} the city, {{followed}} in 1606 by the Capuchins, to eradicate Protestantism. Only 5% of all the residents of Ljubljana {{at the time were}} of Catholic confession, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>took</b> quite a while to make it Catholic again. Jesuits organized the first theatrical productions in the town, fostered the development of Baroque music and established Catholic schools. In the middle and {{the second half of the}} 17th century, foreign architects built and renovated numerous monasteries, churches, and palaces in Ljubljana and introduced Baroque architecture. In 1702, the Ursulines settled in the town, where, the following year, they opened the first public school for girls in the Slovene Lands. Some years later, the construction of Ursuline Church of the Holy Trinity started. In 1779, St. Christopher's Cemetery replaced the cemetery at St. Peter's Church as the main Ljubljana cemetery.|$|E

500|$|In another interview, Sapochnik {{revealed}} that the wildfire explosion at the Sept of Baelor was originally going to only {{be seen from the}} outside, but after storyboarding the sequence with shots of the High Sparrow also being engulfed, Sapochnik was able to convince Benioff and Weiss to make the change for the sequence. Sapochnik also stated about the sequence, [...] "The main chunk of the sequence was essentially a courtroom drama and then lots of little scenes surrounding it shot in many different sets and locations and even countries <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>took</b> {{a long time to get}} all the pieces into the editing system and start actually editing." [...] He also said that the main goal of the scene was to [...] "bring all these intersecting storylines surrounding King's Landing together and end them," [...] and that the music in the scene played an important role in reflecting how the scenes played out on screen tonally, praising Ramin Djawadi's opening score. The Girona Cathedral in Girona, Spain stood in for the exterior shots of the Sept of Baelor.|$|E
2500|$|In 1906, Albert Stevens Crockett, a young {{reporter}} for the New York Herald, interviewed Stodder, who was retired and living in New York, the last surviving officer of the Monitor. Stodder was initially {{reluctant to talk about}} himself, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>took</b> some persuading by Crockett to get Stodder to provide a first-hand account of the Monitors history. Stodder's hair and mustache were now white, but Crockett noted that the former officer was still [...] "erect of figure and had the air and voice of a strict disciplinarian, though with a keen sense of humor and an enjoyment of life." [...] Stodder's account helped historians piece together the story of the short-lived Monitor.|$|E
2500|$|With a {{batch of}} new songs, the Replacements entered a {{warehouse}} in Roseville, Minnesota, to record their next album, with Twin/Tone co-owner Stark engineering. Westerberg wrote songs in stops and starts, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>took</b> several sessions of recording to finish the album. Stark's meticulous approach to recording contrasted {{with that of the}} Replacements, often frustrating the band. In one session, Mars and Westerberg switched instruments, and the band began to improvise, with Westerberg repeatedly shouting, [...] "It's a hootenanny." [...] The band then declared it to be [...] "side one, track one" [...] of the new album. According to Stark, the recording [...] "was a complete joke {{from their point of view}} — they did not care what they delivered".|$|E

2500|$|Tiffany {{was created}} as a new love {{interest}} for established character; Chris Warner. Alison James, who had theatre background, was cast in the role. After appearing on the show for three years, James decided to quit and the character was killed off. She stated, [...] "It {{took me a long}} time to decide to leave Shortland Street because it isn't easy to walk away from something you love. I also had this fear I'd never get work again – it's a real fear. <b>So</b> <b>it</b> <b>took</b> me a long time to wrestle with the idea that saying no to work wasn't unwise, and that if you actually want to grow and develop as an actor you do have to stop and move on." [...] She found her final scenes draining, [...] "Everyone was acting around me and I was there, but my acting had basically stopped. I remember lying there thinking, 'I’m going to miss all these people.' I was quite teary, actually." ...|$|E
2500|$|Alberta {{was settled}} {{relatively}} late in North American history and only became a province in 1905. Black rats cannot survive in its climate at all, and brown rats must live near people {{and in their}} structures to survive the winters. There are numerous predators in Canada's vast natural areas which will eat non-native rats, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>took</b> until 1950 for invading rats {{to make their way}} over land from Eastern Canada. Immediately upon their arrival at the eastern border with Saskatchewan, the Alberta government implemented an extremely aggressive rat control program to stop them from advancing further. A systematic detection and eradication system was used throughout a control zone about [...] long and [...] wide along the eastern border to eliminate rat infestations before the rats could spread further into the province. Shotguns, bulldozers, high explosives, poison gas, and incendiaries were used to destroy rats. Numerous farm buildings were destroyed in the process. Initially, tons of arsenic trioxide were spread around thousands of farm yards to poison rats, but soon after the program commenced the rodenticide and medical drug warfarin was introduced, which is much safer for people and more effective at killing rats than arsenic.|$|E
2500|$|On his {{recovery}} from illness Gartside returned to London {{and went straight}} into the studio with the group to begin recording the album {{at the end of}} 1980. It was recorded at Berry Street Studio in London, with the exception of [...] "Faithless" [...] which was recorded at Island Studios (now renamed Sarm Studios). The band were able to take their time with the recording and to employ guest musicians including Mike McEvoy and Joe Cang because their label Rough Trade paid each member a salary of £50 per week, as well as giving them a generous advance to record the album. Gartside explained that the album had taken several months to make because [...] "a lot of the ideas for this album, particularly lyrically, weren't finalised by the time we went into the studio, so we decided to do a couple of days at a time. Also, we were working with Adam Kidron, who was at the time committed to Delta Five [...] and Pere Ubu and Orange Juice, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>took</b> that much longer to complete.

2500|$|O'Neal {{was given}} jersey #6 for the Raptors since his number with the Pacers (#7) was already owned by Andrea Bargnani. While he was {{expected}} to combine with Toronto's three-time All-Star Chris Bosh to form a strong frontcourt and provide greater rebounding and interior defense for the Raptors, O'Neal's arrival was dwarfed by the Elton Brand signing pulled off by division rivals Philadelphia. O'Neal wasted no time in imposing his style on his new team: in the season opener at Philadelphia, he pointed to hecklers in the home crowd after making a dunk; in the team's second game, Toronto's center blocked a dunk from Golden State's Brandan Wright and thereafter waved a finger, as though to say [...] "Don't come back here again." [...] Even <b>so,</b> <b>it</b> <b>took</b> O'Neal some time to find his offensive game: he reached the 20-point mark just twice in his first 23 games, before notching three straight thereafter. By the All-Star break, injuries had ruled the big man out for almost a quarter of Toronto's games, while Bargnani regained his starting spot with a streak of solid performances. This, coupled with the Raptors entering the break placed 14th in the conference and 13 games under [...]500, Toronto General Manager Bryan Colangelo looked to move O'Neal to bring in a wing player and free up the salary space.|$|E
2500|$|Erich Honecker {{had hoped}} that the Soviets would enter the GDR, as by the Warsaw Pact, and restore the {{communist}} government and suppress the civilian protests. By 1990 the Soviet Government deemed it impractical for the Soviet Union to continue holding its grasp on the Eastern Bloc, and <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>took</b> a neutral stance regarding the events happening in East Germany. Faced with this ongoing civil unrest, the SED deposed Honecker on 18 October and replaced him with the number-two-man in the regime, Egon Krenz. However, the demonstrations kept growing – on Monday 23 October the Leipzig protesters numbered 300,000 and remained as large the following week. The border to Czechoslovakia was opened again on 1 November, but the Czechoslovak authorities soon let all East Germans travel directly to West Germany without further bureaucratic ado, thus lifting their part of the Iron Curtain on 3 November. On 4 November the authorities decided to authorize a demonstration in Berlin and were faced with the Alexanderplatz demonstration where half a million citizens converged on the capital demanding freedom in the biggest protest the GDR ever witnessed. Unable to stem the ensuing flow of refugees to the West through Czechoslovakia, the East German authorities eventually caved in to public pressure by allowing East German citizens to enter West Berlin and West Germany directly, via existing border points, on 9 November 1989, without having properly briefed the border guards. Triggered by the erratic words of regime spokesman Günter Schabowski in a TV press conference, stating that the planned changes were in effect [...] "immediately, without delay," [...] {{hundreds of thousands of}} people took advantage of the opportunity. The guards were quickly overwhelmed by the growing crowds of people demanding to be let out into West Berlin. After receiving no feedback from their superiors, the guards, unwilling to use force, relented and opened the gates to West Berlin. Soon new crossing points were forced open in the Berlin Wall by the people, and sections of the wall were literally torn down as this symbol of oppression was overwhelmed. The bewildered guards were unaware of what was happening, and meekly stood by as the East Germans took to the wall with hammers and chisels.|$|E
2500|$|Watermark {{opens with}} a same-titled {{instrumental}} track with wordless vocals, a tradition that Enya continued on her next three studio albums. Its title derived from a poem Roma was writing {{at the time of}} recording, which inspired her to name the track accordingly. However, the track was kept as an instrumental and the poem was left unused. It was printed {{for the first time in}} the liner notes for Enya's 2002 box set, Only Time – The Collection. During a meeting with Enya, Diana, Princess of Wales revealed that [...] "Watermark" [...] was a favourite of hers. [...] "Cursum Perficio" [...] came about after Enya and the Ryans had seen a documentary on American actress and model Marilyn Monroe, who once wrote the phrase on the tiles on her front doorstep. It means [...] "Your journey ends here" [...] in Latin, and Roma completed a set of Latin lyrics based around the phrase. Enya wanted her vocals to be [...] "bold and up-front" [...] like that of a choral piece, and realised early on that translating its lyrics into English or Gaelic would not complement the music, so Latin was used. [...] "On Your Shore" [...] refers to Magheragallon Beach at Enya's hometown of Gweedore, County Donegal that houses a cemetery where her grandparents are buried. Its emotional and personal connection to her childhood inspired her to write it. She explained, [...] "When the first people lived in Gweedore, there was a sort of shelter for the fishermen ... The sea came in when there was a sermon going on and everybody was wiped out. There are a lot of stories like that, where we would start to talk about them and a song would evolve." [...] It was written as an instrumental at first, but Enya and Nicky found lyrics suited the track better. Numerous [...] "vocal experiments" [...] were tried out for it, but neither suited the music, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>took</b> the more simple form of a single lead vocal with one synthesiser. The clarinet solo was originally sung on its demo, but Nicky suggested a clarinet was the most suitable instrument which suited the vocals she used when singing it.|$|E
