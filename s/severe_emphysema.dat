500|$|Chest-wall defects {{are usually}} evident {{in cases of}} injury to the chest wall, such as stab or bullet wounds ("open pneumothorax"). In {{secondary}} spontaneous pneumothoraces, vulnerabilities in the lung tissue are caused {{by a variety of}} disease processes, particularly by rupturing of bullae (large air-containing lesions) in cases of <b>severe</b> <b>emphysema.</b> Areas of necrosis (tissue death) may precipitate episodes of pneumothorax, although the exact mechanism is unclear. Primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP) has for many years been thought to be caused by [...] "blebs" [...] (small air-filled lesions just under the pleural surface), which were presumed to be more common in those classically at risk of pneumothorax (tall males) due to mechanical factors. In PSP, blebs can be found in 77% of cases, compared to 6% in the general population without a history of PSP. As these healthy subjects do not all develop a pneumothorax later, the hypothesis may not be sufficient to explain all episodes; furthermore, pneumothorax may recur even after surgical treatment of blebs. It has therefore been suggested that PSP may also be caused by areas of disruption (porosity) in the pleural layer, which are prone to rupture. Smoking may additionally lead to inflammation and obstruction of small airways, which account for the markedly increased risk of PSPs in smokers. Once air has stopped entering the pleural cavity, it is gradually reabsorbed.|$|E

The authors report a case of massive and rapid developing subcutaneous emphysema following chest tube displacement in a patient with spontaneous secondary pneumothorax and large air leak.

40|$|The <b>severe,</b> early onset <b>emphysema</b> {{that occurs}} in {{patients}} with circulating deficiency of α 1 -antitrypsin (α 1 -AT) attests {{to the importance of}} this protease inhibitor in maintaining lung parenchymal integrity. It has led to the powerful concept of protease:antiprotease balance being crucial to alveolar homeostasis. Pathogenic mutations cause α 1 -AT to self-associate into polymer chains that accumulate intracellularly rather than proceeding along the secretory pathway. Polymerisation of α 1 -AT abolishes antiprotease activity and confers toxic gain-of-function effects. Since α 1 -AT is predominantly synthesised in the liver, where it does not play a major homeostatic role, the directly toxic effects of polymerisation are clearest here. However, data from molecular, cellular, animal and ex vivo studies indicate that intrapulmonary polymerisation of α 1 -AT and inflammatory positive feedback loops may augment the destructive effects of decreased antiprotease levels in the lung. This review integrates the findings from these different approaches and highlights how multiple pathways may converge to give the <b>severe,</b> panacinar <b>emphysema</b> phenotype seen in α 1 -AT deficiency...|$|R
