50|$|Historically, in the United States {{motion picture}} cameras {{had been used}} since the 1920s for {{recording}} race-meets but were unsuitable for photo-finish photography as the frame rate was too infrequent to catch the critical instant horses or dogs reached the finish line. This record was achieved by using a special <b>slit</b> <b>camera.</b> Lorenzo Del Riccio, a Paramount Pictures motion picture engineer improved the circular flow camera, a device which had been invented in the 1930s especially {{for the purpose of}} photographing moving objects. The first racing club to make use of Del Riccio's 'Photo-Chart' camera for photo-finishes was the Del Mar Turf Club in California at its inaugural meeting in 1937.|$|E
50|$|Route {{panorama}} is {{a continuous}} 2D image that includes all the scenes visible from a route, as it {{first appeared in}} Zheng and Tsuji′s work of panoramic views in 1990. Different from a local panorama at a static viewpoint, a digital route panorama is constructed from partial views at consecutive viewpoints along a path. A general approach to obtain such a complete route panorama {{is to use a}} line camera or <b>slit</b> <b>camera</b> mounted on a vehicle moving along the path smoothly. The camera scans temporal scenes in the side direction of the path and connect them to the spatial image. This is realized by a program that processes temporal image data or video data in a computer. The route panorama can extend to a long distance for indexing scenes and navigation on the Internet. The long image can further be transmitted to and be scrolled on computer screens or handheld devices as moving panorama for access of geospatial locations, navigation, georeferencing, etc.|$|E

5000|$|Because the {{photograph}} {{is not at}} a single instant, the scene can change during the exposure, including such features as duplication of a single object. Notably, extreme ends may be quite separated in time. For example: in a rollout photograph of a head that makes more than one revolution, the subject’s expression may change each time; in a race photo, a racer may go behind the camera (or around the track a second time) and pass the finish line repeatedly, or reverse direction and cross the finish line in the opposite direction; in a panoramic photo, a subject (e.g., a person) may be captured at one side, go behind the camera (or behind some opaque part of the scene), and then re-enter the frame and be captured at the other side. Before the digital age, this was a common ploy on school photographs that were taken with a <b>slit</b> <b>camera</b> that rolled across the scene, the film moving by the same mechanism in the reverse direction. It {{can also be used}} to tell a temporally authentic story, as in a comic strip [...] - [...] events at one end, and consequences or reactions at the other, later in time and space.|$|E

40|$|Proton and {{ion beam}} therapies become {{increasingly}} relevant in radiation therapy. To fully exploit {{the potential of}} this irradiation technique and to achieve maximum target volume conformality, the verification of particle ranges is highly desirable. Many research activities focus on the measurement of the spatial distributions of prompt gamma rays emitted during irradiation. A passively collimating knife-edge <b>slit</b> <b>camera</b> is a promising option to perform such measurements. In former publications, the feasibility of accurate detection of proton range shifts in homogeneous targets could be shown with such a camera. We present <b>slit</b> <b>camera</b> measurements of prompt gamma depth profiles in inhomogeneous targets. From real treatment plans and their underlying CTs, representative beam paths are selected and assembled as one-dimensional inhomogeneous targets built from tissue equivalent materials. These phantoms have been irradiated with monoenergetic proton pencil beams. The accuracy of range deviation estimation {{as well as the}} detectability of range shifts is investigated in different scenarios. In most cases, range deviations can be detected within less than 2 mm. In close vicinity to low-density regions, range detection is challenging. In particular, a minimum beam penetration depth of 7 mm ￼beyond a cavity is required for reliable detection of a cavity filling with the present setup.

40|$|Quasi-monochromatic X-rays {{with energy}} in the 16 - 24 keV range have been {{produced}} in our laboratory by making use of a conventional W-anode X-ray tube and a monochromator optical system via Bragg diffraction.

The field size is about 10. 5 X 12. 0 cm 2 in the image plane. The introduction of an active optical component such as a mosaic crystal array may modify the imaging performances of the system. In order to investigate how the resolution properties of the quasi-monochromatic source are affected by the use of adjacent beams and the Bragg diffraction phenomenon, images of a hole pattern and a <b>slit</b> <b>camera</b> have been obtained with different magnification factors. The images of the hole pattern show duplication effects due to the partial superposition of adjacent beams. <b>Slit</b> <b>camera</b> images show an unexpected increase of the focal spot blurring along the diffraction plane.

40|$|The {{transient}} 500 s X-ray pulsar MAXI J 1409 - 619 {{was discovered}} by the <b>slit</b> <b>cameras</b> aboard MAXI on October 17, 2010, and soon after accurately localized by Swift. We found that the source position was serendipitously observed in 2000 during BeppoSAX observations of the Galactic plane. Two sources are clearly detected in the MECS: one {{is consistent with the}} position of IGR J 14043 - 6148 and the other one with that of MAXI J 1409 - 619. We report on the analysis of this archival BeppoSAX/MECS observation integrated with newly analyzed observation from ASCA and a set of high-energy observations obtained from the offset fields of the BeppoSAX/PDS instrument. For the ON-source observation, the 1. 8 - 100 keV spectrum is fit by an absorbed power law with a photon index Gamma = 0. 87 _{- 0. 19 }^{+ 0. 29 }, corresponding to 2 - 10 and 15 - 100 keV unabsorbed fluxes of 2. 7 E- 12 and 4 E- 11 erg/cm 2 /s, respectively, and a 2 - 10 keV luminosity of 7 E+ 34 erg/s for a 15 kpc distance. For a PDS offset field observation, performed about one year later and showing a 15 - 100 keV flux of 7 E- 11 erg/cm 2 /s, we clearly pinpoint three spectral absorption features at 44, 73, and 128 keV, resolved both in the spectral fit and in the Crab ratio. We interpret these not harmonically spaced features as due to cyclotron resonances. The fundamental energy of 44 +/- 3 keV corresponds to a magnetic field strength at the neutron star surface of 3. 8 E 12 (1 +z) G, where z is the gravitational redshift.

40|$|Purpose: The goal of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} a new method based on a coded aperture mask combined with a digital x-ray imaging detector for measurements of the focal spot sizes of diagnostic x-ray tubes. Common techniques for focal spot size measurements employ a pinhole camera, a <b>slit</b> <b>camera,</b> or a star resolution pattern. The coded aperture mask is a radiation collimator consisting of a large number of apertures disposed on a predetermined grid in an array, through which the radiation source is imaged onto a digital x-ray detector. The method of the coded mask camera allows one to obtain a one-shot accurate and direct measurement of the two dimensions of the focal spot (like that for a pinhole camera) but at a low tube loading (like that for a <b>slit</b> <b>camera).</b> A large number of small apertures in the coded mask operate as a ???multipinhole??? with greater efficiency than a single pinhole, but keeping the resolution of a single pinhole. Methods: X-ray images result from the multiplexed output on the detector image plane of such a multiple aperture array, and the image of the source is digitally reconstructed with a deconvolution algorithm. Images of the focal spot of a laboratory x-ray tube (W anode: 35 ??? 80 kVp; focal spot size of 0. 04 mm) were acquired at different geometrical magnifications with two different types of digital detector (a photon counting hybrid silicon pixel detector with 0. 055 mm pitch and a flat panel CMOS digital detector with 0. 05 mm pitch) using a high resolution coded mask (type no-two-holes-touching modified uniformly redundant array) with 480 0. 07 mm apertures, designed for imaging at energies below 35 keV. Measurements with a <b>slit</b> <b>camera</b> were performed for comparison. A test with a pinhole camera and with the coded mask on a computed radiography mammography unit with 0. 3 mm focal spot was also carried out. Results: The full width at half maximum focal spot sizes were obtained from the line profiles of the decoded images, showing a focal spot of 0. 120 ???mm× 0. 105 ???mm at 35 kVp and M = 6. 1, with a detector entrance exposure as low as 1. 82 mR (0. 125 mA???s tube load). The <b>slit</b> <b>camera</b> indicated a focal spot of 0. 112 ???mm× 0. 104 ???mm at 35 kVp and M = 3. 15, with an exposure at the detector of 72 mR. Focal spot measurements with the coded mask could be performed up to 80 kVp. Tolerance to angular misalignment with the reference beam up to 7 ° in in-plane rotations and 1 ° deg in out-of-plane rotations was observed. The axial distance of the focal spot from the coded mask could also be determined. It is possible to determine the beam intensity via measurement of the intensity of the decoded image of the focal spot and via a calibration procedure. Conclusions: Coded aperture masks coupled to a digital area detector produce precise determinations of the focal spot of an x-ray tube with reduced tube loading and measurement time, coupled to a large tolerance in the alignment of the mask...|$|E

In this method, the locus, which corresponds to a 3 D line, is extracted to calculate projection vectors. And, the parameters of 3 D lines are obtained from the relation between projection vectors and the parameters by recursive optimizing algorithm.

40|$|Streak cameras, either {{electronic}} or rotating mirror, {{are common}} diagnostic tools used to explore very fast phenomena. Often {{they are used}} to precisely time events or durations, and in most cases, {{it is important to have}} quality time marks on the film record. Many methods have been used to introduce time marks onto the film. Exploding bridge wires are frequently used, but they light up slowly and are difficult to read with consistent accuracy. It is also difficult to put more than a few bridge wires in the view of a <b>camera</b> <b>slit,</b> so there are only a few timing marks written to the film. In some cases the time scale on the film must be interpolated over long distances, creating a significant loss of accuracy. Interpolation is especially troublesome with those cameras that have a nonlinear sweep rate. Spark gaps located on the <b>camera</b> <b>slit</b> turn on a bit faster, but suffer from the same interpolation induced errors. A series of short duration laser pulses, accurately timed and introduced along the edges of the film, is a very fine solution. The problem with such a laser fiducial system is that the lasers are very expensive and difficult to maintain. There has been a need for many years for an inexpensive, very bright light source that can be repetitively pulsed accurately and with short duration. Various technologies have sufficiently developed over the past few years, allowing us to build a fiducial system based on light emitting diodes (LED) for the Cordin rotating mirror streak cameras...|$|R
40|$|AIM—To {{determine}} if 3  year treatment of hypercholesterolaemia with simvastatin causes {{an increase of}} lens nuclear back scattering.  METHODS— 160 patients with hypercholesterolaemia in the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study (4 S) were followed for 3  years. Half (80) of the patients took simvastatin and half (80) received placebo. The lens was photographed with a Topcon SL- 45 <b>slit</b> lamp <b>camera</b> {{at the beginning and}} at 1  year intervals. A common lens nuclear area was used for measuring lens nuclear back scattering.  RESULTS—Nuclear back scattering increased with age and there was more pronounced scattering in women than in men. Lens nuclear back scattering did not differ significantly between the simvastatin and placebo groups, but the power was low (0. 2). Lens nuclear back scattering increased during the study period independently of baseline back scattering, age, and sex for both groups.  CONCLUSION—Although no significant difference was found between the simvastatin and placebo groups, the currently available data are insufficient for exclusion of the possibility that taking simvastatin during a 3  year period increases nuclear back scattering. However, a possible minor increase of nuclear back scattering is clinically irrelevant considering known beneficial effects of simvastatin on coronary heart disease. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{a growing}} number of cutting edge centres around the world, {{radiotherapy}} treatments delivered by beams of protons and carbon ions offer the opportunity to target tumours with unprecedented conformality. But a sharper dose distribution increases the need for efficient quality control. Treatments are still affected by uncertainties on the penetration depth of the beam within the patient, requiring medical physicists to add safety margins. To reduce these margins and deliver safer treatments, different projects investigate real time range control by imaging prompt gammas emitted along the proton or carbon ion tracks in the patient. This thesis reports on the feasibility, development and test of a new type of prompt gamma camera for proton therapy. This concept uses a knife-edge slit collimator to obtain a 1 -dimensional projection of the beam path on a gamma camera. It was optimized, using the Monte Carlo code MCNPX version 2. 5. 0, to select high energy photons correlated with the beam range and detect them with both high counting statistics and sufficient spatial resolution for use in clinical routine. To validate the Monte Carlo model, spectrometry measurements of secondary particles emitted by a PMMA target during proton irradiation at 160 MeV were realised. An excellent agreement with the simulations was observed when using subtraction methods to isolate the gammas in direct incidence. A first prototype <b>slit</b> <b>camera</b> using the HiCam gamma detector was consequently prepared and tested successfully at 100 and 160 MeV beam energies. If we neglect electronic dead times and rejection of detected events, the current solution with its collimator at 15 cm from beam axis can achieve a 1 - 2 mm standard deviation on range estimation in a homogeneous PMMA target for numbers of protons that correspond to doses in water at Bragg peak as low as 15 cGy at 100 MeV and 25 cGy at 160 MeV assuming pencil beams with a Gaussian profile of 5 mm sigma at target entrance. This thesis also investigates the applicability of the <b>slit</b> <b>camera</b> for carbon ion therapy. On the basis of Monte Carlo simulations with the code MCNPX version 2. 7. E, this type of camera appears {{not to be able to}} identify the beam range with the required sensitivity. The feasibility of prompt gamma imaging itself seems questionable at high beam energies given the weak correlation of secondaries leaving the patient. This work consequently concludes to the relevance of the <b>slit</b> <b>camera</b> approach for real time range monitoring in proton therapy, but not in carbon ion therapy.

Towards the end of the observing period, a filament eruption occurs that forms the core of a coronal mass ejection. As the filament erupts, it impacts these high-lying loops, temporarily impeding these complex flows, most likely due to compression. This causes the plasma motions in the loops become blue-shifted and then red-shifted. The plasma motions are seen before the loops themselves start to oscillate as they reach equilibrium following the impact.

Due to {{the characteristics of the}} beam, a highly attenuating slit with variable aperture has been designed using Monte Carlo simulations of the X-ray beam and set up. Since the <b>slit</b> <b>camera</b> is far from the ideal model (negligible X-ray transmission and very thin aperture), a whole set of image profiles of the slit at different width sizes have been acquired and analyzed. Imaging correction procedures and data fitting lead to satisfactory experimental results according to the theoretical model...|$|E
40|$|High energy X-ray beams {{with broad}} band energy spectra allow {{performing}} radiographic analysis on different materials and objects of relevant interest that cannot be investigated with conventional X-ray sources. The {{quality of a}} radiographic image strongly depends {{on the characteristics of}} the radiation source as the size of the X-ray emitting area, or focal spot, and the energy spectrum of the radiation. In this work the characterization of a broad-band energy bremsstrahlung source obtained from a linac providing a 5. 5 MeV electron beam colliding with a tungsten target is presented. In order to measure the focal-spot size an ad hoc <b>slit</b> <b>camera</b> has been designed and built and a specific technique was used. Furthermore an analysis of the energy spectrum of the beam was performed using a method based on X-ray diffraction by a mosaic crystal...|$|E
40|$|This work {{achieves}} {{an efficient}} acquisition of scenes and their depths along streets. During {{the movement of}} a vehicle, a <b>slit</b> in the <b>camera</b> frame is set properly to sample scenes continuously for a route panorama. This paper proposes a novel method of depth estimation by analyzing a new phenomenon named stationary blur in the route panorama. We find its relation with the depth and evaluate its degree at local and global levels. The depth estimation through filtering avoids feature matching and tracking that are error-prone in the scanning of real and complex street scenes. Our method provides reliable results but requires much less data {{than that of the}} structure from motion. This keeps the elegance of the route panorama in data representation, and is suitable for real time sensor development. Utilizing the completeness of the route panorama in the scene archiving, we can generate planar models of streets, which will be used in city visualization. 1...|$|R
40|$|From its inception, the DuPont-Northwestern-Dow Collaborative Access Team (DND-CAT) at the Advanced Photon Source has had {{to adapt}} to the {{changing}} needs of industry as well as a diverse academic user base. This has resulted in a sector with support for a broad range of techniques and sample environments. Among the techniques supported at DND-CAT are small and wide angle scattering, reflectivity, spectroscopy, tomography, and powder diffraction. The D station on the insertion device line at DND-CAT (5 ID-D) is a general purpose hutch that is primarily used for small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). Approximately 10 12 photons/sec can be delivered to a. 04 mm 2 spot using multiple sets of <b>slits</b> with pinhole <b>camera</b> geometry. Scattering can be measured down to 2 θ = 0. 014 ° on a 10 m long camera with 1. 5 Å to 0. 7 Å radiation. Many 5 ID-D users are polymer scientists, thus standard techniques supported include SAXS and WAXS image collection simultaneous with thermal, extension/compression, shear, or calorimetric data. Often, an individual user will come with arrays of several sample types requiring different environments and/or camera configurations to fully analyze. This paper describes how the joint goals of flexibility and high throughput are balanced at 5 ID-D for small and wide angle X-ray scattering. A unique simultaneous SAXS/WAXS detector system for collecting anisotropic X-ray scattering is described. Also a method for calibrating sample to detector distance for long tanks using a silicon diffraction grating is presented.

40|$|In {{sounding}} rocket experiment CLASP, I have placed a slit a mirrorfinished around {{the focal point}} of the telescope. The light reflected by the mirror surface surrounding the slit is then imaged in Slitjaw optical system, to obtain the alpharay Lyman secondary image. This image, not only to use the realtime image in rocket flight rocket oriented direction selection, and also used as a scientific data showing the spatial structure of the Lyman alpha emission line intensity distribution and solar chromosphere around the observation area of the polarimetric spectroscope. Slitjaw optical system is a two offaxis mirror unit part including a parabolic mirror and folding mirror, Lyman alpha transmission filter, the optical system magnification 1 x consisting camera. The camera is supplied from the United States, and the other was carried out fabrication and testing in all the Japanese side. Slitjaw optical system, it is difficult to access the structure, it is necessary to install the low place clearance. Therefore, influence the optical performance, the fine adjustment is necessary optical elements are collectively in the form of the mirror unit. On the other hand, due to the alignment of the solar sensor in the US launch site, must be removed once the Lyman alpha transmission filter holder including a filter has a different part from the mirror unit. In order to make the structure simple, stray light measures Aru to concentrate around Lyman alpha transmission filter. To overcome the difficulties of performing optical alignment in Lyman alpha wavelength absorbed by the atmosphere, it was planned following four steps in order to reduce standing time alignment me. 1 : is measured in advance refractive index at Lyman alpha wavelength of Lyman alpha transmission filter (121. 567 nm), to prepare a visible light Firuwo having the same optical path length in the visible light (630 nm). 2 : The mirror structure CLASP before mounting unit standing, dummy <b>slit</b> and <b>camera</b> standing prescribed position in leading frame is, to complete the internal alignment adjustment. 3 : CLASP structure F mirror unit and by attaching the visible light filter, as will plague the focus is carried out in standing position adjustment visible flight products camera. 4 : Replace the Lyman alpha transmission filter, it is confirmed by Lyman alpha wavelength (under vacuum) the requested optical performance have come. Currently, up to 3 of the steps completed, it was confirmed in the visible light optical performance that satisfies the required value sufficiently extended. Also, put in Slitjaw optical system the sunlight through the telescope of CLASP, it is also confirmed that and that stray light rejection no vignetting is in the field of view meets request standing...|$|R
