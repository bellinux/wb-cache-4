40|$|Iron {{aluminides}} are candidate {{materials for}} a sustainable society {{since they are}} composed of abundant metals and have excellent corrosion properties in combination with high specific strength. However, there are some drawbacks that limit the practical use, e. g. low RT ductility and a drop in strength at high temperature. Twelve different FeAl materials were produced with mechanical alloying and hot isostatic pressing, HIP, with differences based on both B-doping {{as well as on}} oxygen content and at which production step the oxygen was introduced to the milling system. Various aspects have been dealt with, i. e. powder characteristics, oxygen content, oxide formation during processing, microstructural development, mechanical properties, diffusion and, finally, vacancy densities attained at elevated temperatures. The analysis is done with following methods: OM, SEM, TEM, EDS, electron diffraction, EELS, XRD, AES, ESCA, chemical analysis of oxygen content, tensile tests, four-point bending, hardness, model analysis and heat treatments. The main conclusions are as follows: The nature and thinness of the oxide scale on the alloyed powder is the most likely explanation for the successful use of HIP to consolidate FeAl, even with air exposed powder, a condition that could be compared to industrial production. Furthermore, the mechanical properties are not impaired by handling the powder in air, proved by the fact that a ductility of around 10 % could be achieved. There seems to be an optimum oxygen content that can be much higher than the content after manufacturing in an inert gas atmosphere. Grain boundaries are concluded to have a large effect on the global diffusion of Al in FeAl, even at 1150 ˚C, and the diffusion rate in a fine grained material can be 10 times as high as in a single crystal. It was found that thermal vacancy hardening is dependent on Al-concentration (strongly), oxide dispersion strengthening and additional alloying, while grain size seems to have only a slight effect. Concluding, thermal vacancy hardening, which is commonly accepted to be the <b>single</b> <b>hardening</b> mechanism responsible for the anomalous stress peak for FeAl alloys in the vicinity of 40 at. % Al, can not be the <b>single</b> <b>hardening</b> mechanism for lower Al-concentrations...|$|E

To this end, network hardening is a well-knowfn preventive security solution that aims to improve network security by taking proactive actions, namely, hardening options. However, most existing network hardening approaches rely on a <b>single</b> <b>hardening</b> option, such as disabling unnecessary services, which becomes less effective when it comes to dealing with unknown and unpatchable vulnerabilities. There lacks a heterogeneous approach that can combine different hardening options in an optimal way to deal with both unknown and unpatchable vulnerabilities.

We then apply security metrics designed for evaluating network resilience against unknown and unpatchable vulnerabilities, and consequently derive optimal hardening solutions that maximize security under given cost constraints...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{experimental}} {{findings on}} the mechanical behavior of clays with dispersed microfabric are indicative {{of the need for}} comprehensive evaluation of the constitutive theories being widely used in practice. The clay deposits can be found having all the stages of microfabrics in their natural state and the dispersed microfabric is one of those. Despite the fact that the effects of microfabric can be radical sometimes, those are seldom given due consideration during the design process. Since the success of numerical modelling of a geotechnical structure is strongly dependent on the accuracy of the constitutive equations, the results produced by commonly used constitutive models can be highly misleading. The present paper is focused on identifying such issues which make the study of dispersed clays important and show the need for incorporating the influence of microfabric into constitutive formulations. Two of the most widely known models, Modified Cam-Clay (MCC) model (Roscoe and Burland, 1968) and the <b>single</b> <b>hardening</b> (SH) model (Lade, 1990), have been calibrated for the Kaolin clay with dispersed microfabric and the predicted response has been compared with the experimental observations.

40|$|AbstractSteel alloys are the {{material}} that is most used in protective constructions today. The reason is the overall good properties of steels, with its high strength and hardness, high ductility, high formability and relatively low cost compared to other materials. Even though armour steels are affordable, work is done to limit expenses from production or {{come up with new}} and less expensive alloys. Case hardening is a technique for production of steel with a very hard and durable surface while still maintaining a tough and ductile core. Case hardened products have hard, durable and fatigue resistant surfaces and tough and durable cores. Case hardening is typically applied to machine parts that are exposed to heavy wear and high loads such as gears, bearings, screws and nuts, shafts, etc	In 2010, Lou et al. managed to significantly increase the penetration resistance of a low-cost steel (NVE 36) by case hardening. Encouraged by this, Hans Magne Thorseth wrote his master s thesis Optimalisering av stål i beskyttelseskonstruksjoner in 2010. His attempt to improve the ballistic strength of Hardox 450 steel by case hardening did not have the desired results. The ballistic limit velocity was reduced from approximately 800 m/s for the original Hardox 450 to approximately 770 m/s for the case hardened steel. The probable reasons for the reduction of the ballistic limit velocity was a too low carbon content increase from the carburizing and thus a too low hardness increase, in addition to deterioration of the metal core properties from the heat treatment. The objective of this master s thesis was to improve the case hardening process used by Hans Magne Thorseth in his master s thesis. The improvement work was divided into two parts, a preliminary project work and this master thesis. The project was carried out in the autumn of 2010, and the aim was to find the optimum case hardening process to produce steel with improved ballistic properties. This involved testing of different carburizing potentials to increase the surface carbon content of the metal and to find carburizing heat treatments that would retain the core properties of the carburized steel. Based on the results from the preliminary project it seemed possible to produce case hardened steel with surface hardness over 1000 HV, but a slight reduction of core hardness was difficult to avoid. The present master s thesis was written during the spring of 2011. The key results from the preliminary project work were used to determine a range of case hardening courses. A total of 11 case hardening courses were tested, of which six courses employed carbon potential of 0. 9 % and five courses employed a carbon potential of 1. 1 %. Different hardening courses were tested, including direct hardening, a modified <b>single</b> <b>hardening</b> process and traditional and modified versions of double and triple hardening. Before the case hardening the plates were sandblasted to remove a corrosion-resistant primer that was applied to the plates. The primer was believed to limit the diffusion of carbon into the steel. In the preliminary project the primer was ground away and grinding was the preferred solution in this work as well, however, due to capacity issues sandblasting was employed. The ballistic limit velocity of the case hardened and the original Hardox 450 target plates were calculated from results obtained by ballistic experiments. The ballistic limit velocities of the case hardened samples, with approximately 787 m/s as the highest, were lower than that of the original Hardox 450, being approximately 800 m/s. 	Surface hardness measurements of the steel revealed a poor effect from the carburization, the hardest surface was measured at 735 HV. This could be explained by a probable surface decarburization of the original Hardox 450, which was discovered by microstructure examinations and hardness measurements. In contrary to in the preliminary project where this layer was ground away, the sandblasting did not remove the decarburized layer. Due to this, the case hardening did not have the desired effect on the steel surface, resulting in a too low surface hardness. 	The core hardness proved difficult to retain, the highest core hardness value obtained was below 460 HV, compared to the original Hardox 450 with core hardness of 475 HV. This could be another reason for the lower ballistic limit velocity of the carburized steel plates. However, the original Hardox 450 did not have the highest cross-sectional hardness integral value, so the ballistic properties probably also depend to some degree on ductility. A main reason for the superior ballistic limit velocity of the original Hardox 450 was therefore believed to be related to cracking of the rear side of the case hardened target plates during projectile penetration. The cracking seemed to be a result of the harder, and thus more brittle, outer surface layer...|$|E
40|$|Thss thesis {{presents}} the results of an experimental programme on the static mono-tonic response of cohesive-frictional granular materials. The purpose of this experimental programme was to gain insight into the mechanical behaviour of uncemented sands, and sands with small percentages of cementation. With this objective in sight, the research involved understanding and delineating the e ects of four variables: the intermediate principal stress, stress inclination, cohesion (or cementation), and particle morphology. The hollow cylinder torsion (HCT) apparatus, which allows control over both the magnitude and direction of principal stresses, was used in this study to carry out a series of elemental tests on the model materials. The test results were analysed in a plasticity theory based framework of critical state soil mechanics. Drained and undrained HCT tests were conducted on a model angular sand to understand the combined influence of intermediate principal stress ratio (b) and principal stress inclination (). Sand specimens were reconstituted to a given density and confining pressure, and were sheared to large strains towards a critical state. The stresses at the critical state with varying `b' were mapped on an octahedral plane to obtain a critical state locus. The shape of this locus closely resembles a curved triangle. Also these specimens showed increased non-coaxiality between the stress and strain increment directions at lower strains. This non-coaxiality decreased significantly, and the response at the critical state was by and large coaxial. The effect of `b' and ` ' on the flow potential, phase transformation, and critical state was also investigated. At phase transformation, ` ' plays a more dominant role in determining the flow potential than `b'. The shape and size of the critical state locus remained the same immaterial of the drainage conditions. Next, small amounts of cohesion (using ordinary Portland cement) was added to this sand ensemble to study the mechanical behaviour of weakly cemented sands. The peak in the stress strain curve was used to signal the breakdown of cohesion further leading to a complete destructuring of the sand at the critical state. The response of the cemented sand changes from brittle to ductile with increase in confining pressure, while reverses with increase in density and `b'. Stress-dilatancy response for the weakly cemented materials shows the non coincidence of peak stress ratio and maximum value of dilation unlike purely frictional materials. This mismatch in peak stress ratio and maximum dilation diminishes with increase in confining pressure. The peak stress (cemented structured sand) locus and the critical state (destructured) locus were constructed on the octahedral plane from these HCT tests. The critical state locus of the cemented sand when it is completely destructured almost coincides with the critical state locus of the clean sand. Using this experimental data set, some important stress-dilatancy relationships (like Zhang and Salgado) and failure criteria (Lade's isotropic <b>single</b> <b>hardening</b> failure criteria and SMP failure criteria) were benchmarked and their prediction capabilities of such models were discussed in detail. The effect of particle morphology was also investigated in this testing programme. Rounded glass ballotini and angular quartzitic sand which occupy two extreme shapes were selected, and a series of HCT tests at different `b' values were con-ducted. A larger sized CS locus was obtained for angular particles and it encompassed the critical state locus of the spherical glass ballotini. Spherical particles exhibit a predominantly dilative behaviour, however present a lower strength at the critical state. The mobilization of strength as a result of rearrangement of angular particles and the consequent interlocking is higher. Even with contractive behaviour which is reflected in the higher values of critical state friction angle and the larger size of the yield locus for sand. Finally, a series of unconfined compression tests were performed to understand if there exists a scale separation in cohesive frictional materials. Specimens were reconstituted to a range of sizes while maintaining a constant aspect ratio and density. As the specimen size increased, the peak strength also increases, counter to an idea of a generalized continuum for all model systems. The observed secondary length scale (in addition to the continuum length scale) is obverse to the one observed in quasi-brittle materials such as concrete, rock. In order to ascertain the reason behind this phenomenon, a series of tomography studies were carried out on these contact-bound ensembles. The presence of cohesion between the grains brings about an " between the grains, which contributes to increase in strength, with increase {{in the size of the}} sample. This in e ect bringing forth a second length scale that controls the behaviour of these cohesive frictional granular materials. This experimental data set provides quantification of various aspects of the me-chanical response of both cemented and uncemented granular materials under myriad stress conditions. This data set is also extremely useful in developing and bench-marking constitutive models and simulations...|$|E

The {{different aspects of the}} <b>single</b> crystal <b>hardening</b> (self and latent hardening, dislocation storage and annihilation, mean free path, etc.) are taken into account both by the introduction of dislocation densities per slip system as internal variables and the corresponding evolution equations. Comparisons are made with experimental results for single and dual-phase steels involving linear and complex loading paths. Rice's criterion is then coupled and applied to this constitutive model {{in order to determine the}} ellipticity loss of the polycrystalline tangent modulus. This criterion, which does not need any additional "fitting" parameter, is used to build Ellipticity Limit Diagrams (ELDs) ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Interest in {{asynchronous}} circuits {{has increased}} in the VLSI research community due to the growing limitations faced during the design of synchronous circuits, which often result in over constrained design and operation. Albeit {{a wide variety of}} techniques for designing asynchronous circuits are available, quasi-delay-insensitive approaches are often preferable due to their simple timing analysis and closure. Null Convention Logic is a style that supports quasi-delay-insensitive design and enables power-, area- and speed-efficient circuits using a standard-cell methodology. However, the correct functionality of such circuits can be jeopardized by transients caused by single event effects, which can generate single event upsets. This work evaluates how Schmitt triggers on output inverters can help mitigating such problems in Null Convention Logic gates and if this approach is sufficient.
