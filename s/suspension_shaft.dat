50|$|The CB900c had a {{front and}} rear air {{assisted}} <b>suspension,</b> <b>shaft</b> drive, and a dual-range sub-transmission. The CB900C {{was derived from the}} DOHC CB750K, and is closely related to the CB900F and the 1983-only CB1100F, both derivatives of the CB750 line.|$|E

2500|$|The Indian 841 {{was heavily}} {{inspired}} by the BMW R71 motorcycle (which, though not used by the German Army later {{was the basis for}} the Soviet M72, which is the basis for the Ural and Chiang Jiang motorcycle) as was its competitor, the Harley-Davidson XA. [...] However, unlike the XA, the 841 was not a copy of the R71. Although its tubular frame, plunger rear <b>suspension,</b> and <b>shaft</b> drive were similar to the BMW's, the 841 was different from the BMW in several aspects, most noticeably so with its 90-degree longitudinal-crankshaft V-twin engine and girder fork.|$|R
50|$|The Lambert chassis of {{the high}} end {{employed}} a three-point suspension to save driving power by decreasing the lift required of the automobile body because of road surface variations. It saved {{wear and tear on}} the automobile body and its parts. The others used ordinary <b>suspension.</b> Sometimes a <b>shaft</b> drive was provided on some models, however most Lambert automobile models were with a chain drive to the rear axle.|$|R
50|$|In 1915 {{he began}} his {{training}} as an engineering draughtsman with Austro-Daimler. At {{the end of the}} 1920s, after completing his engineering studies, he designed the Daimler armoured car.Franz Xaver Reimspiess was remarkable for his precise work and his wealth of ideas. In 1934 he joined the Porsche construction office and developed the air-cooled opposed four-cylinder engine for the Volkswagen basing his design on Kalesâ€™s opposed four-cylinder engine for the NSU prototype. For the Auto Union P racing car Reimspiess designed new brakes and altered the rear axle to <b>shaft</b> <b>suspension.</b>|$|R
50|$|The first {{suggestion}} {{for a larger}} Infantry Tank was made in 1936, with specification A12. The design was produced by the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich, and Vulcan Foundry {{was selected as the}} manufacturer. A12 used a number of design elements of the A7, a medium tank that was built in limited numbers in the early 1930s whose mechanical layout was used for many following designs. With its greatly increased armor, a lack of power was seen as a problem. The solution was to use two AEC straight-six water-cooled diesel engines, used in London buses, providing up to 87 hp each. These were linked along a common <b>shaft.</b> <b>Suspension</b> was to use the 'Japanese Type' bell crank suspension used on the A7.|$|R
40|$|The current {{popularity}} of suspension and levitation stems {{no doubt the}} possibilities in high-speed ground transportation schemes. Although these are both challenging and exciting, there is considerable scope for application of suspension techniques to achieving frictionless bearing. The requirement {{in this case is}} often for close tolerances, low power consumption, small airgaps and ingeneral, compactness. Thus, magnetic suspension using DC electromagnets schemes have received more attention than the other techniques of repulsion levitation. Proposed prototype system consists of a conventional stator and its rotor without iron core, set of electromagnets for <b>suspension</b> of rotor <b>shaft</b> and set of compensation circuits feedbacked by optical-transducers. Prototyped system is aimed as a laboratory demonstration tool so there is no challenging to exceed the speeds of 1500 rev/min that is the speed of motor with mechanical bearings. Magnetic bearing suspension system provides a high impact visual demonstration of many principles in undergraduate educational programs in electrical education, e. g., electromagnetic design, PD controlled compensation of a unstable control system and power amplifier design. The system is capable of giving a good comparison between mechanical and magnetic bearing up to speeds 350 rev/min. Power losses without load show about 15 % reduction with magnetic bearing. The noise of the motor is also decreased to a low level...|$|R
40|$|Paper {{presented}} to the 3 rd Southern African Solar Energy Conference, South Africa, 11 - 13 May, 2015. A cart is a vehicle designed for transport, using two wheels and normally pulled by one or a pair of draught animals. A solar vehicle is an electric vehicle which supplies {{all or most of}} its required power by converting solar radiation into electricity with the help of solar cells. The aim of this work is to design and develop a solar assisted electric cart {{that can be used for}} carrying loads and transporting people by villagers and farmers and also to reduce animal drudgery. As an initial investigation, the physical data of conventional cart used by farmers are collected based on which the motor and various parts of vehicle namely; Chain drive, <b>Shaft,</b> <b>Suspension,</b> Brakes etc. are selected for final development of cart. The FEM analysis is carried out to study the stress and displacements of the cart in order to ensure the safety. The basic performance of cart is evaluated in terms of its range, acceleration and maximum achievable speed. The final weight of cart so designed is 620 kg and load carrying capacityis found to be 800 kg. The achievable acceleration of cart is calculated as 1. 2 m/s 2 with maximum achievable speed of 15 km/h with a power rating of about 1. 5 kW out of which about 11. 4 % power is derived from solar radiation. The range of the cart is calculated as 44. 75 km which seems to be reasonable for rural areas. dc 201...|$|R
5000|$|Aside {{from the}} new-for-1990 Touring Coupe model (see entry below) {{introduced}} {{later in the}} model year, {{it was a year}} of enhancement for Eldorado. A driver's side airbag was introduced as standard equipment, but as a result, the telescoping steering column was discontinued (although the tilt feature remained). Cruise control buttons were mounted on the center of the previous steering wheel, but {{with the advent of the}} air bag (mounted on a smaller diameter steering wheel), they were now moved to the turn signal stalk. A new multi-point fuel injection replaced the throttle-body style from last year, and horsepower jumped from 155 to 180, although the new system required the use of premium fuel. A new cast aluminum wheel design (not available with the Touring Suspension package) was optional for those customers who desired something different than the standard [...] "snowflake" [...] alloy wheel on the base Eldorado. Seating received numerous enhancements, including new molded trim panels, additional lateral and lumbar support, French seams, and revised front headrests. Full leather upholstery (formerly leather and cloth) was now standard on the Biarritz model, but the base model lost the seat-back map pockets. The cellular telephone disappeared from the option list, and the vinyl center armrest was revamped. The electronic climate control received an update in the form of three automatic and two manual settings. The optional leather upholstery package on the base model now included a power passenger seat recliner. Last year's [...] "Eldorado Option Package" [...] (which included new-style carpeted floor mats, body-color door edge guards, illuminated driver and passenger visor vanity mirrors, luggage compartment mat, and the illuminated entry system) was now standard. Additionally, previously optional items that were added as standard equipment this year included the rear window defogger with heated outside mirrors, and bodyside accent striping. New options for 1990 included a central-unlocking feature (from the outside door locks using the key) added to the automatic door locks. A revised deck-lid engine plaque now mentioned the port fuel injection, and the deck-lid itself held a chromed handle above the license plate opening. Also, the rear safety reflectors moved from the bumper onto the panel below the decklid this year. A new charcoal-colored vinyl strip accented the chrome bumper and bodyside moldings this year, while the front bumper guards changed from body-color to charcoal. In the front <b>suspension,</b> the stabilizer <b>shaft</b> was revised for ride and handling, while the tire jack located in the trunk had a new carpeted storage container. Price for 1990 was $28,885, with the Biarritz model an additional $3,180. Production dropped to 20,874 units, about 1/3 of which were the Biarritz model. An additional 1,507 Eldorado Touring Coupe models were made.|$|R
