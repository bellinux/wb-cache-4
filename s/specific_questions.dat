5|$|In 2014 Consumer Reports {{published}} {{results from}} a survey conducted with 19 secret shoppers that went to 85 dealerships in four states, making anonymous visits between December 2013 and March 2014. The secret shoppers asked a number of <b>specific</b> <b>questions</b> about cars to test the salespeople’s knowledge about electric cars. The consumer magazine decided to conduct the survey after several consumers who {{wanted to buy a}} plug-in car reported to the organization that some dealerships were steering them toward gasoline-powered models. The survey found that not all sales people seemed enthusiastic about making PEV sales; a few outright discouraged it, and even one dealer was reluctant to even show a plug-in model despite having one in stock. And many sales people seemed not to have a good understanding of electric-car tax breaks and other incentives or of charging needs and costs. Consumer Reports also found that when it came to answering basic questions, sales people at Chevrolet, Ford, and Nissan dealerships tended to be better informed than those at Honda and Toyota. The survey found that most of the Toyota dealerships visited recommended against buying a Prius Plug-in and suggested buying a standard Prius hybrid instead. Overall, the secret shoppers reported that only 13 dealers “discouraged sale of EV,” with seven of them being in New York. However, at 35 of the 85 dealerships visited, the secret shoppers said sales people recommended buying a gasoline-powered car instead.|$|E

25|$|Non-verbal {{behaviors}} {{are particularly important}} to forming first impressions when meeting a business acquaintance. Specifically, components of social expressivity, such as smiling, eyebrow position, emotional expression, and eye contact are emphasized. Straightening one's posture, leaning in slightly, and giving a firm handshake promotes favorable impression formation in the American business context. Other impression management tactics {{in the business world}} include researching the organization and interviewers beforehand, preparing <b>specific</b> <b>questions</b> for the interviewer, showing confidence, and dressing appropriately.|$|E
25|$|Most {{works were}} {{revealed}} {{in response to}} <b>specific</b> <b>questions</b> by Bábís. This is not unusual; the genre of the letter has been a venerable medium for composing authoritative texts {{as far back as}} the Paul the Apostle. Three quarters of the chapters of the New Testament are letters, were composed to imitate letters, or contain letters within them. Sometimes the Báb revealed works very rapidly by chanting them in the presence of a secretary and eyewitnesses.|$|E
50|$|A common {{technique}} used by anthropologists is “myth debunking.” In this process, anthropologists present a <b>specific</b> <b>question</b> and conduct {{a study to}} either verify or negate its validity. Research design is actually {{an important part of}} this process, allowing anthropologists to present a <b>specific</b> <b>question</b> and answer it. Being able to hone into such a broad subject specifically while remaining holistic is largely the reason why this technique is popular among anthropologists.|$|R

25|$|The {{interest}} in genealogical DNA tests {{has been linked}} to both an increase in curiosity about traditional genealogy and to more general personal origins. Those who test for traditional genealogy often utilize a combination of autosomal, mitochondrial, and Y-Chromosome tests. Those with an {{interest in}} personal ethnic origins are more likely to use an autosomal test. However, answering <b>specific</b> <b>questions</b> about the ethnic origins of a particular lineage may be best suited to an mtDNA test or a Y-DNA test.|$|E
25|$|As {{with other}} {{educational}} research (and {{the social sciences}} in general), mathematics education research depends on both quantitative and qualitative studies. Quantitative research includes studies that use inferential statistics to answer <b>specific</b> <b>questions,</b> such as whether a certain teaching method gives significantly better results than the status quo. The best quantitative studies involve randomized trials where students or classes are randomly assigned different methods {{in order to test}} their effects. They depend on large samples to obtain statistically significant results.|$|E
25|$|Around 1620 Galileo wrote a paper called On a {{discovery}} concerning dice that used an early probabilistic model to address <b>specific</b> <b>questions.</b> In 1654, prompted by Chevalier de Méré's interest in gambling, Blaise Pascal corresponded with Pierre de Fermat, {{and much of}} the groundwork for probability theory was laid. Pascal's Wager was noted for its early use of the concept of infinity, and the first formal use of decision theory. The work of Pascal and Fermat influenced Leibniz's work on the infinitesimal calculus, which in turn provided further momentum for the formal analysis of probability and randomness.|$|E

Each Zonal Forum provides a biannual report {{on the floor of the}} World Service Conference and, when requested by the conference, may also answer <b>specific</b> <b>questions</b> or address the body. In order to improve communications, the Zonal Forums are provided with conference participant mailings and send each Zonal Forum meeting record to World Services. In order to more effectively serve the fellowship, World Services and the Zonal Forums maintain an ongoing partnership in order to plan and conduct the Worldwide Workshop system.|$|E
25|$|The {{excavations}} {{had produced}} {{vast amounts of}} artifacts and data, but as yet there was no final publication. In 1978, Malcolm Bell, III, professor of classical art and archaeology at the University of Virginia, took over the project {{with the goal of}} publishing the Morgantina material. Bell was a former Princeton graduate student (Sjöqvist had been Bell's advisor until his retirement) who had written his dissertation on terracotta figurines found at Morgantina. He has conducted investigations on Serra Orlando since 1982, each time with the intention of answering <b>specific</b> <b>questions</b> raised by earlier work. Bell used his dissertation {{as the basis for the}} first book in the Morgantina Studies series published in 1983. Six volumes have appeared in the series, which is the main vehicle for the definite publication of the excavation results.|$|E
25|$|Differential item {{functioning}} (DIF), {{sometimes referred}} to as measurement bias, is a phenomenon when participants from different groups (ex gender, race, disability) with the same latent abilities give different answers to <b>specific</b> <b>questions</b> on the same IQ test. DIF analysis measures such specific items on a test alongside measuring participants latent abilities on other similar questions. A consistent different group response to a specific question among similar type of questions can indicate an effect of DIF. It does not count as differential item functioning if both groups have equally valid chance of giving different responses to the same questions. Such bias can be a result of culture, educational level and other factors that are independent of group traits. DIF is only considered if test-takers from different groups with the same underlying latent ability level have a different chance of giving specific responses. Such questions are usually removed {{in order to make the}} test equally fair for both groups. Common techniques for analyzing DIF are item response theory (IRT) based methods, Mantel-Haenszel, and logistic regression.|$|E

30|$|A {{systematic}} {{literature study}} is a systematic and repeatable approach to identify and study all relevant evidences, i.e. primary studies, on a <b>specific</b> research <b>question</b> or phenomenon[10]. The method consists of literature search, study selection, data extraction and synthesis. Systematic literature studies can be roughly divided in two categories[10]: systematic literature review (SLR) focuses on finding existing evidence on a <b>specific</b> <b>question,</b> while systematic mapping study (SMS) categorizes existing studies on the topic {{in order to show}} the gaps of knowledge.|$|R
25|$|Japanese espionage against Pearl Harbor {{involved}} {{at least two}} Abwehr agents. One of them, Otto Kuhn, was a sleeper agent living in Hawaii with his family. Kuhn was incompetent {{and there is no}} evidence he provided information of value. The other, Yugoslavian businessman Dusko Popov, was a double agent, working for the XX Committee of MI5. In August 1941, he was sent by the Abwehr to the U.S., with an assignment list that included <b>specific</b> <b>questions</b> about military facilities in Oahu, including Pearl Harbor. Although British Security Coordination introduced Popov to the FBI, the Americans seem to have paid little attention. It is possible that previous propaganda and forged or unreliable intelligence from the British contributed to J. Edgar Hoover's dismissing Popov's interest in Pearl Harbor as unimportant. There is nothing to show his assignment list was passed on to military intelligence, nor was he allowed to visit Hawaii. Popov later asserted his list was a clear warning of the attack, ignored by the bungling FBI. The questions in his list were rambling and general, and in no way pointed to air attack on Pearl Harbor. Prange considered Popov's claim overblown, and argued the notorious questionnaire was a product of Abwehr thoroughness.|$|E

500|$|According to Parley P. Pratt, Smith {{dictated}} revelations orally, {{and they}} were recorded by a scribe without revisions or corrections. Revelations were immediately copied, and then circulated among church members. Smith's revelations often came in response to <b>specific</b> <b>questions.</b> He described the revelatory process as having [...] "pure Intelligence" [...] flowing into him. Smith, however, never viewed the wording to be infallible. The revelations were not God's words verbatim, but [...] "couched in language suitable to Joseph's time". In 1833, Smith edited and expanded many of the previous revelations, publishing them as the Book of Commandments, which later {{became part of the}} Doctrine and Covenants.|$|E
500|$|In 1888 Lansbury {{agreed to}} act as {{election}} agent for Jane Cobden, who was contesting the first elections for the newly formed London County Council [...] (LCC) as Liberal candidate for the Bow and Bromley division. [...] Cobden, an early supporter of women's suffrage, was the fourth child of the Victorian radical statesman Richard Cobden. [...] The Society for Promoting Women as County Councillors (SPWCC), a new women's rights group, had proposed Cobden as the [...] candidate for Bow and Bromley and Margaret Sandhurst [...] for Brixton. [...] Lansbury counselled Cobden in the issues of greatest concern to the East End electorate: housing for the poor, ending of sweated labour, rights of public assembly, {{and control of the}} police. <b>Specific</b> <b>questions</b> of women's rights were largely avoided during the campaign. [...] On 19 January 1889 both women were elected; these triumphs were, however, short-lived. Sandhurst's [...] qualification to serve as a county councillor was successfully challenged in the courts by her Conservative Party opponents on the grounds of her sex, and her subsequent appeal was dismissed. Cobden was not immediately challenged, but in April 1891, after a [...] series of legal actions, [...] she was effectively neutered as a councillor by being prevented from voting on pain of severe financial penalties. [...] Lansbury urged her, during the hearings, [...] to [...] "go to prison and let the Council back you up by refusing to declare your seat vacant". Cobden did not follow this path. A Bill introduced in the House of Commons in May 1891 permitting women to serve as county councillors found little support among [...] MPs of any party; women were not granted this right until 1907.|$|E
500|$|The philosopher Frederick Suppe {{considered}} Sexual Preference a {{very important}} study that failed to duplicate the findings of Bieber et al. or the predictions of symbolic interactionism, labeling theory, and societal reaction theory approaches. Suppe considered Bell et al.′s sample of homosexuals, while highly biased, to nevertheless be the most representative ever made, and argued that biased samples can be adequate {{for the purposes of}} refuting theories propounded in other studies [...] "so long as the types of subjects used in those other studies constitute a subsample of the replicative study′s sample and the latter's population does not go beyond the claimed scope of the replicated studies." [...] He maintained that Bell et al.′s study meets these requirements, that their use of path analysis was appropriate, and that their procedures for developing a composite etiology model, which contained [...] "virtually all paths advanced in the literature", are legitimate. He argued that the only plausible basis for disputing that the study definitively refutes [...] "social learning theories of homosexual etiology" [...] is to challenge the adequacy of Bell et al.′s models and the questions they used. However, he questioned some of the details of Bell et al.′s methodology, including the questions asked. He wrote that while Bell et al. did not use the same <b>specific</b> <b>questions</b> that Bieber et al. employed, they did use [...] "questions directed at the same concerns." [...] He noted that Bell et al.′s data regarding subjects′ negative feelings toward and relationships with their fathers were based on open-ended interview questions, adding {{that it would have been}} preferable had they employed the same [...] "structured-answer questions" [...] used in Bieber et al.′s earlier study. He rejected Bell et al.′s claim that their study supports a biological explanation of sexual orientation. He wrote that since Bell et al.′s study, research into the [...] "social causes of homosexuality" [...] has become [...] "moribund." ...|$|E
