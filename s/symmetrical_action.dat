40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to show that the logical formula for equivalence, (A=A; but is not Al), originates in the early manual actions of the young child. Having two hands that are bilaterally opposed and initially function in bilaterally <b>symmetrical</b> <b>action</b> might serve to structure the form of early sensori-motor experiences and this structured experience serves as the base of the logical operation of equivalence. Subjects were 66 children ranging in age from 7 to 32 months. Each chila Has presented six different clusters. of five blocks each. dhildren were filmed at block Methodology and data obtained are discussed at length. In general the films revealed the gradual atemporalization of successive states and the dissociation of the logical from the contingent. The films also suggest that the physical constraints of material determine the early block structures, but block structures graduall...|$|E

For mobile devices, research suggests that users prefer to use only one hand than two hands together [26]. Some {{studies have suggested that}} while two-handed interaction with mobile devices (e.g., for typing and marking menus) can increase performance, the accuracy would get affected negatively in significant ways [25, 26]. Some efforts have also been made to develop interaction techniques for two-handed interactions using motion tracking devices [27]. However, it is shown that to be better than traditional input devices, they often require more training time and practice. This suggest that the design of such devices needs to be improved so that users could spend less time to get used to them.|$|R
40|$|A {{particularly}} {{simple and}} flexible mathematical {{framework for the}} study of proba-bility theory- classical, quantum and otherwise- is the notion of a test space, i. e., a collection of (possibly overlapping) discrete sample spaces (as developed in the 1970 s and 80 s by D. J. Foulis, C. H. Randall and others). “Quantum logics ” arise quite naturally as invariants of test spaces; however, the latter are much easier both to interpret and to manipulate. After providing a tutorial on test spaces, I’ll outline how this framework can usefully be enriched by the addition of topological and covariant structure. In particular, I’ll discuss topological test spaces that are highly <b>symmetrical</b> under the <b>action</b> of a compact group...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{deals with}} the {{tradeoffs}} between security, real-time and lifetime performance. Due to the multihop nature of communication wireless ad hoc networks are very vulnerable to attacks. Malicious nodes included in a routing path may misbehave and organize attacks such as black holes. Scaling the number of hops for a packet delivery we trade off energy efficiency against security and real-time communication. To study the multihop communication we propose a hierarchical communication model. The REWARD (receive, watch, redirect) algorithm for secure routing is employed as a main example for corrective <b>actions.</b> <b>Symmetrical</b> routing is a distinguish feature of protocols such as REWARD and we outline the threshold of conflict between power-efficient partitioning of communication links and symmetrical routing...|$|R
40|$|Computer {{classification}} of facial expressions requires {{large amounts of}} data and this data needs to reflect the diversity of conditions seen in real applications. Public datasets help accelerate the progress of research by provid-ing researchers with a benchmark resource. We present a comprehensively labeled dataset of ecologically valid spon-taneous facial responses recorded in natural settings over the Internet. To collect the data, online viewers watched one of three intentionally amusing Super Bowl commercials and were simultaneously filmed using their webcam. They answered three self-report questions about their experience. A subset of viewers additionally gave consent for their data to be shared publicly with other researchers. This subset consists of 242 facial videos (168, 359 frames) recorded in real world conditions. The dataset is comprehensively la-beled for the following: 1) frame-by-frame labels {{for the presence of}} 10 <b>symmetrical</b> FACS <b>action</b> units, 4 asymmet-ric (unilateral) FACS action units, 2 head movements, smile, general expressiveness, feature tracker fails and gender; 2) the location of 22 automatically detected landmark points; 3) self-report responses of familiarity with, liking of, and desire to watch again for the stimuli videos and 4) base-line performance of detection algorithms on this dataset.

40|$|This {{article was}} {{accepted}} for publication in the Journal of Biomechanics [© Elsevier] and the definitive version is available at: www. elsevier. com/locate/jbiomechTriple jumpers employ either an asymmetrical ‘single-arm’ <b>action</b> or <b>symmetrical</b> ‘double-arm’ <b>action</b> in the takeoff of each phase of the jump. This study investigated which technique is more beneficial in each phase using computer simulation. Kinematic data were obtained from an entire triple jump using a Vicon automatic motion capture system. A planar 13 -segment torque-driven subject-specific computer simulation model was evaluated by varying torque generator activation timings using a genetic algorithm in order to match performance data. The matching produced a close agreement between simulation and performance, with differences of 3. 8 %, 2. 7 %, and 3. 1 % for the hop, step, and jump phases respectively. Each phase was optimised for jump distance {{and an increase in}} jump distance beyond the matched simulations of 3. 3 %, 11. 1 %, and 8. 2 % was obtained for the hop, step, and jump respectively. The optimised technique used symmetrical shoulder flexion whereas the triple jumper had used an asymmetrical arm technique. This arm action put the leg extensors into slower concentric conditions allowing greater extensor torques to be produced. The main increases in work came at the joints of the stance leg but the largest increases in angular impulse came at the shoulder joints, indicating the importance of both measures when assessing the impact of individual joint actions on changes in technique. Possible benefits of the double-arm technique include: cushioning the stance leg during impact; raising the centre of mass of the body at takeoff; facilitating an increase in kinetic energy at takeoff; allowing a re-orientation of the body during flight...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{experimental and}} theoretical work towards {{the development of}} advanced integrated planar optical devices for wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) applications in optical communication systems. The presented work lies within {{a broad range of}} research areas, namely: design and simulation of novel Bragg grating based WDM passive devices, their performance characterization in simulated optical communication systems, fabrication and characterization of photosensitive thin films and finally device fabrication using ultraviolet induced refractive index changes. A complete model for the analysis of Bragg grating assisted devices in waveguide structures has been developed. Bragg grating based optical Add/Drop multiplexers (OADM) have been simulated and studied by using this modelling tool. A fully optimised design for an OADM based on null coupler and tilted Bragg grating has been proposed. This device can exhibit optimised Add and Drop actions with suppressed backreflections and crosstalk to a level lower than - 40 dB. A novel interferometric OADM configuration based on a full cycle full (100 %) coupler is also proposed. This design exhibits fully optimised and <b>symmetrical</b> Add/Drop <b>actions</b> in contrast to the compromised performance of traditional interferometric configurations. A software simulation tool has also been developed and employed for the theoretical characterization of optical filters, linking this way the proposed devices to real communication system issues related to high bit rate WDM networks. The effect of group delay ripple in WDM filters is studied for different modulation formats and a simplified figure of merit is proposed for the characterization of the effect. For the fabrication of photosensitive thin film structures, a prototype in-house Flame Hydrolysis Deposition facility was built and it was initially characterized. Further experimental work involved detailed analysis and characterization of highly photosensitive Lead Germanate glasses grown by Pulsed Laser Deposition. A developed direct UV-writing facility is presented and major issues around the functionality of the technique are discussed, by demonstrating solutions for the control of the optical system. A rapid heat treatment technique is also proposed for locking the enhanced photosensitivity in deuterium loaded germanosilicate glasses and successful preliminary results are demonstrated. This method should allow finally the fabrication of complex all-UV-written devices, which has been limited to date by the degrading photosensitivity during UV writing, due to rapid deuterium outdiffusion...|$|R
40|$|Spiral {{force was}} written in 1979 for the Young Musicians Foundation Competition and was awarded the Willard and Minna Coe Composition Prize. It was premiered by the YMF Debut Orchestra on April 13, 1980 at Royce Hall, UCLA. The most {{important}} and dominating structural tool {{in the composition of}} Spiral Force is the use of a nearly chromatic five note group of pitches (B, C, C#, D#, E). These pitches are free to appear in any order, instrumental combination, or octave transposition and always appear in a rising fifths transposition pattern with one exception. The triton transposition is occasionally used because it is the only group that does not repeat a pitch when combined. All melodic and harmonic actions are strictly governed by the underlying structure. It was my goal to create a unified work with limited pitch and transpositional structure, and to achieve a consistency from an overall perspective. My objective was realized by means of manipulation and treatments of the pitch group, variety in harmonic, dynamic, and textural elements, and repetition, often varied, of formal, sectional, and thematic behavior. Spiral Force begins with a section shaped by sustained pitches in a dynamic canon. This passage is characterized by a <b>symmetrical</b> crescendo-diminuendo <b>action</b> within the range of ppp to mf. Although this is of prominent structural significance in the work, it serves here as an accompaniment pattern for a melodic statement (in horns) at the triton transposition. After a repetition in an antecedent-consequent form, it is interrupted by a sudden massive furiouso lasting only one measure (m. 21). This contains a rapid rhythmic figure with five attacks which becomes increasingly dominant throughout the course of the work. Later repetitions are expanded to include an extreme high register followed by an extreme low. The other section of special formal importance is an agitato in the woodwinds (m. 32). It is a polyphonic texture in a five beat repetitive pattern. This section is later expanded to twice the length, combined with pitched percussion, harp and piano, and features some palindromic writing. Spiral Force effectively fuses its fundamental elements. The five note pitch structure, five note rhythmic figure, melodic statements, register and dynamic extremes are combined and consolidated. As a whole, the work is a study of limitations and consistency, getting the most from the least to result in a logical coherence, an agreement, a compatibility...|$|R
40|$|Background It was {{proposed}} by Rogers & Pennington (1991) that an early deficit in imitation, {{together with a}} cascade of developmental disorders in emotion sharing and Theory of Mind, could be important in understanding autism. Having already found that imitation appeared not to be specifically or universally impaired in autism, the present study tested whether there were distinctions between different types of actions, such as symbolic versus non-symbolic, one-handed versus two-handed or <b>symmetrical</b> versus asymmetrical <b>actions,</b> on a test of elicited imitation. Methods A large battery of tasks was used to elicit imitation from three groups of autistic children and adults (aged 4 – 34 years of age), two groups of typically developing children {{and a group of}} children with mild-to-moderate intellectual disabilities. Results The majority of children and adults with autism had few impairments relative to the controls, although certain actions did seem more difficult, especially for the youngest children. For example, actions within the categories of 'symbolic actions' and 'asymmetrical actions' seemed to give some groups more problems. Certain types of errors such as hand reversals and using body parts as objects were found in both autistic and non-autistic groups, but, for the most part, in the youngest children in the whole sample. A final analysis compared the number of partial imitations for eight specific actions. Conclusions The overall picture was not one of an autism-specific deficit in imitation, but rather of a normal (i. e. age-related) developmental trend. These results are discussed in terms of Rogers & Pennington's theory and other leading theories. ...|$|R
