Standard equipment included power steering and power front disk and rear drum brakes, as well as 15-inch wheels with fiberglass belted radial whitewall tires. The Eagle came base and upscale Limited trims, both of which carried the same features as the Concord DL and Limited, respectively.

50|$|They are {{generally}} made from carbon Steel or stainless <b>steel.</b> Stainless <b>steel</b> <b>belts</b> are corrosion resistant and provide excellent surface quality. Stainless <b>steel</b> <b>belts</b> are used {{primarily in the}} chemical, food, rubber, plastic, wood, and laminate industries. Carbon <b>steel</b> <b>belts</b> are energy efficient and ideal for applications necessitating radiant heating of products or in high-temperature applications that might exceed the annealing temperatures of stainless <b>steel</b> <b>belts</b> also carbon <b>steel</b> <b>belts</b> can more evenly distributed heat since most stainless steel alloys are comparatively poor heat conductors. Carbon <b>steel</b> <b>belts</b> are used primarily in food processing, transport, and bake ovens. Textured Steel is also a commonly found belt material. The main purpose of using textured steel material is for its non-stick capabilities. This works well in the laminate industry.|$|R
50|$|In this sector, {{continuous}} stainless <b>steel</b> <b>belts</b> are {{an integral}} part of continuous production processes. Unlike conveyor belts used purely for transportation purposes, <b>steel</b> <b>belts</b> used in this industry serve as media for transferring heat and/or pressure. Applications for <b>steel</b> <b>belts</b> in the chemical industry include casting, polymerizing of resins, waxes, para fins and many other substances.|$|R
50|$|<b>Steel</b> <b>belts</b> play an {{essential}} role in modern, continuous production processes for wood based panels (WBP) such as particle boards, OSB- and MDF boards, where they serve as heat and pressure transfer media at the same time. As the <b>steel</b> <b>belt</b> surface has a direct influence on the final panel surface quality, this application imposes high demands on <b>steel</b> <b>belts</b> regarding thickness uniformity and surface finish.|$|R

50|$|Although {{the overall}} size of 1974 Chryslers was barely {{larger than the}} {{fuselage}} generation that preceded it, weight continued to creep upward. Additional emission controls, safety features, and growing standard equipment lists were having {{the same effect on}} every automaker. The 3-seat T&C tipped the scales at just under 5,000 pounds, about 300 pounds heavier than ’72 fuselage generation T&C. With air conditioning, and a typical complement of power assists, the average ’74 T&C weighed about 5,200 pounds. Standard tires were size L78x15 bias belted on size 6.5x15 inch rims. <b>Steel</b> <b>belted</b> radials were optional.|$|E

5000|$|The {{failure of}} the subject tires [...] "begin as belt-edge {{separation}} {{at the edge of}} the second belt. This is the area of highest strain in a <b>steel</b> <b>belted</b> radial tire, primarily due to the structural discontinuity created by the abrupt change in modulus from steel to rubber." [...] Once a tread separation begins it can grow along the circumference of the tire or laterally across the width of the tire leading to cracks that grow between the belts. As separation progressed it could grow to form large crescent shaped areas along one or both sides of the tire. If those areas grew large enough they could separate catastrophically, especially at high speeds where the separation was aided by the centrifugal force of the spinning tire.|$|E
50|$|Solid {{stainless}} <b>steel</b> <b>belts</b> are, as standard, {{delivered in}} cold-rolled condition with a mill finish of Ra < 0,4 µm and have well-rounded edges.

50|$|Another {{use of the}} peening {{process is}} to flatten sheet metal and is {{specifically}} used as a primary technique to flatten <b>steel</b> <b>belts</b> used in industrial conveying and pressing operations. In this process a <b>steel</b> <b>belt</b> that has a cross curvature can be flattened by peening the concave surface to stretch it and thereby removing the cross-curvature by equalizing the surface length across the belt between the previously concave and convex surfaces. The shot peening of <b>steel</b> <b>belts</b> is usually achieved by a using specialised equipment and special peening shot.|$|R
5000|$|Dunlop Rubber, {{founded in}} 1889, was a British {{multinational}} {{involved in the}} manufacture of various rubber products. By the end of the Second World War, around 1946, starting with Fort Dunlop, Erdington, a suburb of Birmingham in Britain, Dunlop had manufacturing facilities in the United States, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, Ireland, South Africa and India. It had sales outlets in nearly every country in the world. Then the Monopolies and Restrictive Prices Commission forced some pricing changes. In the early sixties Dunlop opted for the cheaper textile radial tyres rather than the <b>steel</b> <b>belted</b> radial tyres. The British car industry declined and the 1973 oil crisis compounded matters. Dunlop started losing markets. As its business declined it started selling off many of its companies, including that in India.|$|E

Shorter vertical grille guards appeared {{in about the}} same position as before. Rear fendersides were flatter without the elliptical bulge. The thin beltline molding was positioned lower by several inches. The rear end had vertical bumper ends with the tail light built in. Both bumpers, especially the rear, protruded further from the body. Unlike the other [...] "C" [...] body GM coupes, the Coupe de Ville was no a longer true hardtop, instead sporting large wide [...] "coach" [...] windows giving a thick center pillar look. They retained their frameless door glass, however. The Sedan de Ville continued as a true hardtop however, and would remain so until the 1977 model. A new curved instrument panel housed a digital clock. New standard features included an integral litter container.

5000|$|Shot peening is a {{solution}} process for flattening a deformed <b>steel</b> <b>belt</b> in which {{the surface of the}} belt is hammered with small spherical stainless steel or carbon steel balls called peening shot. Every single small piece of shots hitting the <b>steel</b> <b>belts</b> functions as a small peening hammer, transmitting a small indentation or dimple on the <b>steel</b> <b>belt</b> surface. In order for the indentation to be formed, the <b>steel</b> <b>belt</b> surface layer must yield in tension. The compressed grains help to recover the surface to its real surface (original surface) producing a hemisphere of cold-worked metal extremely stressed in compression. Overlapping indentation create a homogeneous layer of residual compressive stress. It is well known that cracks will not lead up nor propagate in a compressible stressed zone. Because nearly all fatigue and stress corrosion failures create at the surface of a part, compressive stresses generate by shot peening provide very important increases in life time.Note that: ...|$|R
