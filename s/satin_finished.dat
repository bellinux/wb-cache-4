50|$|The StingRay bass was an {{innovative}} early instrument. Though the body design borrowed heavily from the Precision Bass, the StingRay is largely considered the first production bass with active electronics. The StingRay's two-band active equalizer, high output humbucking pickup, and smooth <b>satin</b> <b>finished</b> neck became {{a favorite of}} many influential bassists, including Louis Johnson, John Deacon, and Flea. Later, a three-band active equalizer was introduced on the StingRay. Music Man was active making amplifiers as well, but the HD-130 Reverb, designed {{to compete with the}} Twin Reverb, came {{at a time when the}} clean sounds of the Twin were going out of fashion.|$|E
50|$|Smith & Wesson {{changed its}} {{numbering}} {{system with the}} introduction of its third generation iteration, where a four digit numeral replaced the earlier three digit numeral designators. One of the first in this series was the 4505; this is essentially the 645 with only the safety catch ambidextrous and a blued finish. A Novak Lo-Mount rear sight was installed on a small number of 4505s. It was produced only in 1991. The Smith & Wesson Model 4506, is made of <b>satin</b> <b>finished</b> stainless steel, a Novak Lo-Mount rear sight later in the series, and a Xenoy wrap-around grip with either a straight or arched backstrap. After 1998, the 4506 had a rounded trigger guard profile, which replaced the earlier squared profile inherited from the 645. The 4506 was produced from 1988-2001.|$|E
40|$|Ceramic {{balls are}} {{expected}} to become useful for tougher bearings than conventional ones. However, the conventional ball lapping method which uses a couple of flat and V-groove lapping plates, needs so long machining time. In present paper, efficient lapping method of silicon nitride balls has been proposed. In this method, it is designed that V-groove lapping plate is separated into two parts and three plates are able to rotate independently. This lapping equipment enables the spin angle θ of ball to control from 0 ° to 90 ° It is found from the experiments that the spin angle θ of ball has great influence to lapping of silicon nitride one. Stock removal rate increases gradually with increase of the spin angle θ and surface roughness decreases considerably with increase of it in which lapping mode varies from the <b>satin</b> <b>finished</b> surface to scratched one. Experiments indicate that degree of the reduction of deviated diameter of ball from ideal one is dependent both upon the rotational speed and the spin angle...|$|E

50|$|<b>Satin</b> <b>finish</b> {{requires}} less polishing {{time and}} therefore {{is not as}} expensive to produce.

This way the blade will not be as expensive as a fully mirror finished one. Metal plating, using nickel or silver, is also used, but it is not preferred; the plating eventually erodes through use, revealing the underlying metal, which is often of inferior quality.|$|R
