5|$|<b>Solvation</b> {{of charges}} in the betaine by counterions such as lithium with greater <b>solvation</b> {{allowing}} more facile rotation in the betaine intermediate, lowering the amount of reversibility.|$|E
5|$|In aqueous solution, the {{alkali metal}} ions form aqua ions of the formula +, where n is the <b>solvation</b> number. Their {{coordination}} numbers and shapes agree well with those expected from their ionic radii. In aqueous solution the water molecules directly {{attached to the}} metal ion are said {{to belong to the}} first coordination sphere, also known as the first, or primary, <b>solvation</b> shell. The bond between a water molecule and the metal ion is a dative covalent bond, with the oxygen atom donating both electrons to the bond. Each coordinated water molecule may be attached by hydrogen bonds to other water molecules. The latter are said to reside in the second coordination sphere. However, for the alkali metal cations, the second coordination sphere is not well-defined as the +1 charge on the cation is not high enough to polarise the water molecules in the primary <b>solvation</b> shell enough for them to form strong hydrogen bonds with those in the second coordination sphere, producing a more stable entity. The <b>solvation</b> number for Li+ has been experimentally determined to be 4, forming the tetrahedral +: while <b>solvation</b> numbers of 3 to 6 have been found for lithium aqua ions, <b>solvation</b> numbers less than 4 {{may be the result of}} the formation of contact ion pairs, and the higher <b>solvation</b> numbers may be interpreted in terms of water molecules that approach + through a face of the tetrahedron, though molecular dynamic simulations may indicate the existence of an octahedral hexaaqua ion. There are also probably six water molecules in the primary <b>solvation</b> sphere of the sodium ion, forming the octahedral + ion. While it was previously thought that the heavier alkali metals also formed octahedral hexaaqua ions, it has since been found that potassium and rubidium probably form the + and + ions, which have the square antiprismatic structure, and that caesium forms the 12-coordinate + ion.|$|E
5|$|The classic view {{of water}} in cells is that about 5% of this water is {{strongly}} bound in by solutes or macromolecules as water of <b>solvation,</b> while the majority has the same structure as pure water. This water of <b>solvation</b> is not active in osmosis and may have different solvent properties, so that some dissolved molecules are excluded, while others become concentrated. However, others argue {{that the effects of}} the high concentrations of macromolecules in cells extend throughout the cytosol and that water in cells behaves very differently from the water in dilute solutions. These ideas include the proposal that cells contain zones of low and high-density water, which could have widespread effects on the structures and functions of the other parts of the cell. However, the use of advanced nuclear magnetic resonance methods to directly measure the mobility {{of water in}} living cells contradicts this idea, as it suggests that 85% of cell water acts like that pure water, while the remainder is less mobile and probably bound to macromolecules.|$|E
5|$|Lithium {{fluoride}} is {{the only}} alkali metal halide that is poorly soluble in water, and lithium hydroxide {{is the only}} alkali metal hydroxide that is not deliquescent. Conversely, lithium perchlorate and other lithium salts with large anions that cannot be polarised are much more stable than the analogous compounds of the other alkali metals, probably because Li+ has a high <b>solvation</b> energy. This effect also means that most simple lithium salts are commonly encountered in hydrated form, because the anhydrous forms are extremely hygroscopic: this allows salts like lithium chloride and lithium bromide {{to be used in}} dehumidifiers and air-conditioners.|$|E
5|$|The {{solubility}} {{is highest}} in polar solvents (such as water) or ionic liquids, but {{tends to be}} low in nonpolar solvents (such as petrol/gasoline). This is principally because the resulting ion–dipole interactions are significantly stronger than ion-induced dipole interactions, so the heat of solution is higher. When the oppositely charged ions in the solid ionic lattice are surrounded by the opposite pole of a polar molecule, the solid ions are {{pulled out of the}} lattice and into the liquid. If the <b>solvation</b> energy exceeds the lattice energy, the negative net enthalpy change of solution provides a thermodynamic drive to remove ions from their positions in the crystal and dissolve in the liquid. In addition, the entropy change of solution is usually positive for most solid solutes like ionic compounds, which means that their solubility increases when the temperature increases. There are some unusual ionic compounds such as cerium(III) sulfate, where this entropy change is negative, due to extra order induced in the water upon solution, and the solubility decreases with temperature.|$|E
25|$|An {{alternative}} to the explicit water models is to use an implicit <b>solvation</b> model, also termed a continuum model, an example {{of which would be}} the COSMO <b>solvation</b> model or the polarizable continuum model (PCM) or a hybrid <b>solvation</b> model.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to mixing, the substances {{in a solution}} {{interact with each other}} at the molecular level. When something is dissolved, molecules of the solvent arrange around molecules of the solute. Heat transfer is involved and entropy is increased making the solution more thermodynamically stable than the solute and solvent separately. This arrangement is mediated by the respective chemical properties of the solvent and solute, such as hydrogen bonding, dipole moment and polarizability. <b>Solvation</b> does not cause a chemical reaction or chemical configuration changes in the solute. However, <b>solvation</b> resembles a coordination complex formation reaction, often with considerable energetics (heat of <b>solvation</b> and entropy of <b>solvation)</b> and is thus far from a neutral process.|$|E
25|$|The silver halides have a {{wide range}} of solubilities. The {{solubility}} of AgF is about 6 × 107 times that of AgI. These differences are attributed to the relative <b>solvation</b> enthalpies of the halide ions; the enthalpy of <b>solvation</b> of fluoride is anomalously large.|$|E
25|$|Researchers {{have yet}} to fully {{characterize}} the <b>solvation</b> of hydronium ion in water, in part because many different meanings of <b>solvation</b> exist. A freezing-point depression study determined that the mean hydration ion in cold water is approximately : on average, each hydronium ion is solvated by 6 water molecules which are unable to solvate other solute molecules.|$|E
25|$|Several {{criteria}} {{influence the}} strength of the bonding: the nature of the cation, <b>solvation</b> effects, the nature of the π system, and the geometry of the interaction.|$|E
25|$|Solute-solvent {{hydrogen}} bonds {{in the first}} <b>solvation</b> shell are important for solubility of organic molecules and especially ions. Their average energetic contribution can be reproduced with an implicit solvent model.|$|E
25|$|When water {{molecules}} in the rigid <b>solvation</b> layer are brought {{back into the}} bulk phase through interactions with the added salt, their greater freedom of movement causes {{a significant increase in}} their entropy. Thus, ΔG becomes negative and precipitation occurs spontaneously.|$|E
25|$|The {{solubility}} of one {{substance in}} another {{is determined by}} the balance of intermolecular forces between the solvent and solute, and the entropy change that accompanies the <b>solvation.</b> Factors such as temperature and pressure will alter this balance, thus changing the solubility.|$|E
25|$|The {{effect of}} {{explicit}} solute model on solute behavior in biomolecular simulations has been also extensively studied. It was shown that explicit water models affected the specific <b>solvation</b> and dynamics of unfolded peptides, while the conformational behavior and flexibility of folded peptides remained intact.|$|E
25|$|Repulsive {{electrostatic}} forces also {{form when}} proteins are dissolved in water. Water forms a <b>solvation</b> layer around the hydrophilic surface residues of a protein. Water establishes a concentration gradient around the protein, {{with the highest}} concentration at the protein surface. This water network has a damping effect on the attractive forces between proteins.|$|E
25|$|A process {{based on}} a <b>solvation</b> {{extraction}} process using the triether extractant named above. This process has the disadvantage of requiring {{the use of a}} salting-out reagent (aluminium nitrate) to increase the nitrate concentration in the aqueous phase to obtain a reasonable distribution ratio. This process was used at Windscale many years ago. This process has been replaced by PUREX.|$|E
25|$|The {{nature of}} the solvent also determines the {{absolute}} and relative strength of the bonding. Most data on cation–π interaction is acquired in the gas phase, as the attraction is most pronounced in that case. Any intermediating solvent molecule will attenuate the effect, because the energy gained by the cation–π interaction is partially offset {{by the loss of}} <b>solvation</b> energy.|$|E
25|$|Protein {{precipitation}} {{is widely}} used in downstream processing of biological products in order to concentrate proteins and purify them from various contaminants. For example, in the biotechnology industry protein precipitation is used to eliminate contaminants commonly contained in blood. The underlying mechanism of precipitation is to alter the <b>solvation</b> potential of the solvent, more specifically, by lowering the solubility of the solute by addition of a reagent.|$|E
25|$|This is a {{liquid-liquid}} extraction process which uses {{methyl isobutyl ketone}} as the extractant. The extraction is by a <b>solvation</b> mechanism. This process has the disadvantage of requiring {{the use of a}} salting-out reagent (aluminium nitrate) to increase the nitrate concentration in the aqueous phase to obtain a reasonable distribution ratio (D value). Also, hexone is degraded by concentrated nitric acid. This process has been replaced by the PUREX process.|$|E
25|$|MWNTs have mesopores {{that allow}} for easy access of ions at the electrode–electrolyte interface. As the pore size {{approaches}} {{the size of the}} ion <b>solvation</b> shell, the solvent molecules are partially stripped, resulting in larger ionic packing density and increased faradaic storage capability. However, the considerable volume change during repeated intercalation and depletion decreases their mechanical stability. To this end, research to increase surface area, mechanical strength, electrical conductivity and chemical stability is ongoing.|$|E
25|$|The {{reference}} <b>solvation</b> {{free energy}} of i {{corresponds to a}} suitably chosen small molecule in which group i is essentially fully solvent-exposed. The integral is over the volume Vj of group j and the summation is over all groups j around i. EEF1 additionally uses a distance-dependent (non-constant) dielectric, and ionic side-chains of proteins are simply neutralized. It is only 50% slower than a vacuum simulation. This model was later augmented with the hydrophobic effect and called Charmm19/SASA.|$|E
25|$|Adding {{a second}} {{extraction}} agent, octyl(phenyl)-N, N-dibutyl carbamoylmethyl phosphine oxide(CMPO) {{in combination with}} tributylphosphate, (TBP), the PUREX process {{can be turned into}} the TRUEX (TRansUranic EXtraction) process. TRUEX was invented in the USA by Argonne National Laboratory and is designed to remove the transuranic metals (Am/Cm) from waste. The idea is that by lowering the alpha activity of the waste, the majority of the waste can then be disposed of with greater ease. In common with PUREX this process operates by a <b>solvation</b> mechanism.|$|E
25|$|The vast {{majority}} of nuclei in a solution would belong to the solvent, and most regular solvents are hydrocarbons and would contain NMR-reactive protons. Thus, deuterium (hydrogen-2) is substituted (99+%). The most used deuterated solvent is deuterochloroform (CDCl3), although deuterium oxide (D2O) and deuterated DMSO (DMSO-d6) are used for hydrophilic analytes and deuterated benzene is also common. The chemical shifts are slightly different in different solvents, depending on electronic <b>solvation</b> effects. NMR spectra are often calibrated against the known solvent residual proton peak instead of added tetramethylsilane.|$|E
25|$|In the {{original}} Franck–Condon principle, after the electronic transition, the molecules which {{end up in}} higher vibrational states immediately begin to relax to the lowest vibrational state. In the case of <b>solvation,</b> the solvent molecules will immediately try to rearrange themselves {{in order to minimize}} the interaction energy. The rate of solvent relaxation depends on the viscosity of the solvent. Assuming the solvent relaxation time is short compared with the lifetime of the electronic excited state, emission will be from the lowest solvent energy state of the excited electronic state. For small-molecule solvents such as water or methanol at ambient temperature, solvent relaxation time is on the order of some tens of picoseconds whereas chromophore excited state lifetimes range from a few picoseconds to a few nanoseconds. Immediately after the transition to the ground electronic state, the solvent molecules must also rearrange themselves to accommodate the new electronic configuration of the chromophore. Figure 7 illustrates the Franck–Condon principle applied to <b>solvation.</b> When the solution is illuminated by with light corresponding to the electronic transition energy, some of the chromophores will move to the excited state. Within this group of chromophores there will be a statistical distribution of solvent-chromophore interaction energies, represented in the figure by a Gaussian distribution function. The solvent-chromophore interaction is drawn as a parabolic potential in both electronic states. Since the electronic transition is essentially instantaneous on the time scale of solvent motion (vertical arrow), the collection of excited state chromophores is immediately far from equilibrium. The rearrangement of the solvent molecules according to the new potential energy curve is represented by the curved arrows in Figure 7. Note that while the electronic transitions are quantized, the chromophore-solvent interaction energy is treated as a classical continuum due to the large number of molecules involved. Although emission is depicted as taking place from the minimum of the excited state chromophore-solvent interaction potential, significant emission can take place before equilibrium is reached when the viscosity of the solvent is high or the lifetime of the excited state is short. The energy difference between absorbed and emitted photons depicted in Figure 7 is the <b>solvation</b> contribution to the Stokes shift.|$|E
25|$|It is {{possible}} to include a layer or sphere of water molecules around the solute, and model the bulk with an implicit solvent. Such an approach is proposed by M. J. Frisch and coworkers and by other authors. For instance in Ref. the bulk solvent is modeled with a Generalized Born approach and the multi-grid method used for Coulombic pairwise particle interactions. It {{is reported to be}} faster than a full explicit solvent simulation with the particle mesh Ewald summation (PME) method of electrostatic calculation. There are a range of hybrid methods available capable of accessing and acquiring information on <b>solvation.</b>|$|E
25|$|Poor quality {{diesel fuel}} {{has been used}} as an {{extraction}} agent for liquid–liquid extraction of palladium from nitric acid mixtures. Such use has been proposed as a means of separating the fission product palladium from PUREX raffinate which comes from used nuclear fuel. In this system of solvent extraction, the hydrocarbons of the diesel act as the diluent while the dialkyl sulfides act as the extractant. This extraction operates by a <b>solvation</b> mechanism. So far, neither a pilot plant nor full scale plant has been constructed to recover palladium, rhodium or ruthenium from nuclear wastes created by the use of nuclear fuel.|$|E
25|$|As an {{alternative}} to TRUEX, an extraction process using a malondiamide has been devised. The DIAMEX (DIAMideEXtraction) process {{has the advantage of}} avoiding the formation of organic waste which contains elements other than carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen. Such an organic waste can be burned without the formation of acidic gases which could contribute to acid rain (although the acidic gases could be recovered by a scrubber). The DIAMEX process is being worked on in Europe by the French CEA. The process is sufficiently mature that an industrial plant could be constructed with the existing knowledge of the process. In common with PUREX this process operates by a <b>solvation</b> mechanism.|$|E
25|$|Physics-based energy {{calculations}} aim {{to capture}} the interatomic interactions that are physically responsible for protein stability in solution, especially van der Waals and electrostatic interactions. These calculations are performed using a molecular mechanics force field; proteins are normally too large even for semi-empirical quantum mechanics-based calculations. The use of these methods {{is based on the}} energy landscape hypothesis of protein folding, which predicts that a protein's native state is also its energy minimum. Such methods usually employ implicit <b>solvation,</b> which provides a continuous approximation of a solvent bath for a single protein molecule without necessitating the explicit representation of individual solvent molecules. A force field specifically constructed for model assessment is known as the Effective Force Field (EFF) and is based on atomic parameters from CHARMM.|$|E
25|$|Models like PB and GB allow {{estimation}} of the mean electrostatic free energy but do {{not account for the}} (mostly) entropic effects arising from solute-imposed constraints on the organization of the water or solvent molecules. This is termed the hydrophobic effect and is {{a major factor in the}} folding process of globular proteins with hydrophobic cores. Implicit <b>solvation</b> models may be augmented with a term that accounts for the hydrophobic effect. The most popular way to do this is by taking the solvent accessible surface area (SASA) as a proxy of the extent of the hydrophobic effect. Most authors place the extent of this effect between 5 and 45 cal/(Å2 mol). Note that this surface area pertains to the solute, while the hydrophobic effect is mostly entropic in nature at physiological temperatures and occurs on the side of the solvent.|$|E
25|$|In general, {{polymeric}} mixtures are {{far less}} miscible than mixtures of small molecule materials. This effect results {{from the fact that}} the driving force for mixing is usually entropy, not interaction energy. In other words, miscible materials usually form a solution not because their interaction with each other is more favorable than their self-interaction, but because of an increase in entropy and hence free energy associated with increasing the amount of volume available to each component. This increase in entropy scales with the number of particles (or moles) being mixed. Since polymeric molecules are much larger and hence generally have much higher specific volumes than small molecules, the number of molecules involved in a polymeric mixture is far smaller than the number in a small molecule mixture of equal volume. The energetics of mixing, on the other hand, is comparable on a per volume basis for polymeric and small molecule mixtures. This tends to increase the free energy of mixing for polymer solutions and thus make <b>solvation</b> less favorable. Thus, concentrated solutions of polymers are far rarer than those of small molecules.|$|E
500|$|... {{where in}} aqueous {{solution}} H+ or H+(aq) denotes a solvated proton. Often this is written as the hydronium ion H3O+, but this formula is not exact because in fact there is <b>solvation</b> {{by more than one}} water molecule and species such as H5O2+, H7O3+ and H9O4+ are also present.|$|E
500|$|Specialized {{molecular}} dynamics programs, {{referred to as}} [...] "FahCores" [...] and often abbreviated [...] "cores", perform the calculations on the work unit as a background process. A large majority of Folding@home's cores are based on GROMACS, {{one of the fastest}} and most popular {{molecular dynamics}} software packages, which largely consists of manually optimized assembly language code and hardware optimizations. Although GROMACS is open-source software and there is a cooperative effort between the Pande lab and GROMACS developers, Folding@home uses a closed-source license to help ensure data validity. Less active cores include ProtoMol and SHARPEN. Folding@home has used AMBER, CPMD, Desmond, and TINKER, but these have since been retired and are no longer in active service. Some of these cores perform explicit <b>solvation</b> calculations in which the surrounding solvent (usually water) is modeled atom-by-atom; while others perform implicit <b>solvation</b> methods, where the solvent is treated as a mathematical continuum. The core is separate from the client to enable the scientific methods to be updated automatically without requiring a client update. The cores periodically create calculation checkpoints so that if they are interrupted they can resume work from that point upon startup.|$|E
500|$|The DNA {{double helix}} is {{stabilized}} primarily by two forces: hydrogen bonds between nucleotides and base-stacking interactions among aromatic nucleobases. In the aqueous {{environment of the}} cell, the conjugated [...] bonds of nucleotide bases align perpendicular to the axis of the DNA molecule, minimizing their interaction with the <b>solvation</b> shell. The four bases found in DNA are adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G) and thymine (T). These four bases {{are attached to the}} sugar-phosphate to form the complete nucleotide, as shown for adenosine monophosphate. Adenine pairs with thymine and guanine pairs with cytosine. It was represented by A-T base pairs and G-C base pairs.|$|E
500|$|Effects of the solvent and <b>solvation</b> {{should be}} {{mentioned}} also in this section. It turns out, these influences are more subtle {{than that of}} a dielectric medium mentioned above. For example, the expected (by electronic effects of methyl substituents) and observed in gas phase order of basicity of methylamines, Me3N > Me2NH > MeNH2 > NH3, is changed by water to [...] Me2NH > MeNH2 > Me3N > NH3. Neutral methylamine molecules are hydrogen-bonded to water molecules mainly through one acceptor, N–HOH, interaction and only occasionally just one more donor bond, NH–OH2. Hence, methylamines are stabilized to about the same extent by hydration, regardless of the number of methyl groups. In stark contrast, corresponding methylammonium cations always utilize all the available protons for donor NH–OH2 bonding. Relative stabilization of methylammonium ions thus decreases with the number of methyl groups explaining the order of water basicity of methylamines.|$|E
500|$|In stark {{contrast}} to this, all four silver(I) halides are known. The fluoride, chloride, and bromide have the sodium chloride structure, but the iodide has three known stable forms at different temperatures; that at room temperature is the cubic zinc blende structure. They can all be obtained by the direct reaction of their respective elements. As the halogen group is descended, the silver halide gains more and more covalent character, solubility decreases, and the color changes from the white chloride to the yellow iodide as the energy required for ligand-metal charge transfer (X−Ag+ → XAg) decreases. The fluoride is anomalous, as the fluoride ion is so small {{that it has a}} considerable <b>solvation</b> energy and hence is highly water-soluble and forms di- and tetrahydrates. The other three silver halides are highly insoluble in aqueous solutions and are very commonly used in gravimetric analytical methods. All four are photosensitive (though the monofluoride is so only to ultraviolet light), especially the bromide and iodide which photodecompose to silver metal, and thus were used in traditional photography. The reaction involved is: ...|$|E
2500|$|These cycles {{have been}} used for {{attempts}} at first principles predictions (solving using the fundamental physical equations) using physically motivated solvent models, to create parametric equations and QSPR models [...] and combinations of the two. The use of these cycles enables the calculation of the <b>solvation</b> free energy indirectly via either gas (in the sublimation cycle) or a melt (fusion cycle). This is helpful as calculating the free energy of <b>solvation</b> directly is extremely difficult. The free energy of <b>solvation</b> can be converted to a solubility value using various formulae, the most general case being shown below, where the numerator is the free energy of <b>solvation,</b> R is the gas constant and T is the temperature in kelvins.|$|E
