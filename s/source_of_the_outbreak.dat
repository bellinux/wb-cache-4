500|$|The {{earliest}} {{record of}} an epidemic caused by [...] virus was made by Lurman in 1885. An outbreak of smallpox occurred in Bremen in 1883 and 1,289 shipyard employees were vaccinated with lymph from other people. After several weeks, and up to eight months later, 191 of the vaccinated workers became ill with jaundice and were diagnosed as suffering from serum hepatitis. Other employees who had been inoculated with different batches of lymph remained healthy. Lurman's paper, now regarded as a classical example of an epidemiological study, proved that contaminated lymph was the <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>outbreak.</b> Later, numerous similar outbreaks were reported following the introduction, in 1909, of hypodermic needles that were used, and, more importantly, reused, for administering Salvarsan {{for the treatment of}} syphilis. The virus was not discovered until 1966 when Baruch Blumberg, then working at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), discovered the Australia antigen (later known to be [...] surface antigen, or HBsAg) in the blood of Australian aboriginal people. Although a virus had been suspected since the research published by Frederick MacCallum in 1947, David Dane and others discovered the virus particle in 1970 by electron microscopy. By the early 1980s the genome of the virus had been sequenced, and the first vaccines were being tested.|$|E
2500|$|Epidemiological {{fieldwork}} suggested {{fresh vegetables}} were {{the source of}} infection. [...] The agriculture minister of Lower Saxony identified an organic farm in Bienenbüttel, Lower Saxony, Germany, which produces a variety of sprouted foods, as the likely source of the E. coli outbreak. The farm was shut down. Although laboratories in Lower Saxony did not detect the bacterium in produce, a laboratory in North Rhine-Westphalia later found the outbreak strain in a discarded package of sprouts from the suspect farm. A control investigation confirmed the farm as the <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>outbreak.</b> [...] On 30 June 2011, the German Bundesinstitut für Risikobewertung (BfR) (Federal Institute for Risk Assessment), an institute of the German Federal Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Consumer Protection, announced that seeds of organic fenugreek imported from Egypt were likely the <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>outbreak.</b>|$|E
50|$|Fenugreek sprouts, {{cultivated}} from {{a single}} specific batch of seeds imported from Egypt into Germany in 2009, were implicated as <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 2011 <b>outbreak</b> <b>of</b> Escherichia coli O104:H4 in Germany and France.

2500|$|A {{spokesman}} for the agriculture ministry in Lower Saxony, warned people on 5 June to stop eating local bean sprouts, as they had become the latest suspected cause of the E. coli outbreak. A farm in Bienenbuettel, Lower Saxony, was announced as the probable source, but on 6 June, officials said this could not be substantiated by tests. Of the 40 samples from the farm that were being examined, 23 had tested negative.

[...] A cholera expert, John Mekalanos, supported the assertion that it was important to know where and how the disease emerged because the strain is a [...] "novel, virulent strain previously unknown in the Western Hemisphere and health officials need to know how it spreads."

2500|$|The largest {{outbreak}} of hepatitis A virus in United States history occurred {{among people who}} ate at a now defunct Mexican food restaurant located in Monaca, Pennsylvania in late 2003. Over 550 people who visited the restaurant between September and October 2003 were infected with the virus, three of whom died as a direct result. The outbreak {{was brought to the}} attention of health officials when local emergency medicine physicians noticed a significant increase in [...] cases of hepatitis A in the county. After conducting its investigation, the CDC attributed the <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>outbreak</b> to the use of contaminated raw green onion. The restaurant was purchasing its green onion stock from farms in Mexico at the time. It is believed that the green onions may have been contaminated through the use of contaminated water for crop irrigation, rinsing, or icing or by handling of the vegetables by infected individuals. Green onion had caused similar outbreaks of hepatitis A in the southern United States prior to this, but not to the same magnitude. The CDC believes that the restaurant's use of a large communal bucket for chopped raw green onion allowed non-contaminated plants to be mixed with contaminated ones, increasing the number of vectors of infection and amplifying the outbreak. The restaurant was closed once it was discovered to be the source, and over 9,000 people were given hepatitis A immune globulin because they had either eaten at the restaurant or had been in close contact with someone who had.|$|E
