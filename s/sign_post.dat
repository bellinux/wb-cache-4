Within days of the announcement, virtually every US666 sign had been stolen, some for sale on eBay. Officials in Utah reported that five entire sign assemblies had been cut down with a chainsaw and stolen, while New Mexico officials reported that even signs welded to metal posts, as a theft deterrent, had been stolen. Officials speculated from one scene that someone had intentionally crashed a car into the <b>sign</b> <b>post</b> to break the welds.|$|E

500|$|With Martin's form uncertain, the {{favourite}} for {{the race}} was Alejandro Valverde. As well as performing strongly in the early-season hilly classics in the 2015 season, he had been close to success in Il Lombardia in the past: he finished second in both 2013 and 2014. Max Sciandri, a directeur sportif for the , said that the increased difficulty of the 2015 edition suited Valverde: [...] "now it suits the climbers and good descenders rather the Classics riders ... can climb, can descend and is even fast in a sprint finish." [...] Cycling Weekly suggested that Valverde's ability {{to recover from the}} Vuelta in time for Il Lombardia would work in his favour. Joaquim Rodríguez (...) would also have been a strong favourite {{for the race}}: he won the 2012 and 2013 editions and had come second in the Vuelta. However, he injured his knee when he hit a <b>sign</b> <b>post</b> while training and was forced to withdraw from the race.|$|E

[...] This massive {{volcanic}} archway is called Echo Hall. [...] The smooth walls are remarkably symmetrical so sounds echo in the huge chamber.

60|$|The cross {{was pretty}} large, and {{was made of}} wood. It {{was set up by}} the road side, like a <b>sign</b> <b>post</b> in America.

This spear, of course, {{represented}} the weapon of the Roman soldier, by which the body of Jesus was pierced in the side. From the same part of the post out {{to the end of the}} opposite arm of the cross was a pole with two sponges at the end of it, which represented the sponges with which the soldiers reached the vinegar up for Jesus to drink. Then all along the cross bar were various other emblems, such as the nails, the hammer, a pair of pincers, a little ladder, a great key, and on the top a cock, to represent the cock which crowed at the time of Peter's betrayal of his Lord.|$|E
