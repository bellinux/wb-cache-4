She is furious as <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> killed had she not checked Langly the night before.

5|$|The Michiganensian {{described}} the defeat as follows:"There had been {{every reason to}} expect a victory from Chicago. Michigan had played strong and consistent foot ball throughout her schedule – Chicago had been erratic and unsteady. But there is certainly no sport more full of surprises than foot-ball, and the Thanksgiving Day contest of '96 furnished as sensational a surprise in as exciting a contest as had ever come off on a western gridiron. There was one great difference {{in the character of}} the play of the two teams. Michigan was playing her stock game of football, hard and steady, the game <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> depended on to play at any time. Chicago seemed to have been trained and nerved to this one game. There could have been little doubt what the result of a series of contests would have been. But this one game, Chicago won by good generalship, by the most advantageous use of her greatest resource – a magnificent player in a telling place.|$|E
5|$|Yuri, {{also known}} as , has a {{determined}} personality but is secretly very sensitive and protective. She invites Otonashi to join the SSS, an organization she founded and leads which fights against God. She is smart and decisive when making operations and decisions. She carries a silver Beretta 92. Not only is she skilled with a gun, but she is also capable in close range hand-to-hand combat, which is shown when she fends off Angel's hand sonic with a combat knife. She vowed to fight against God after her three younger siblings were murdered by burglars looking for valuables and never forgave herself for failing to prevent their deaths. She is an effective leader, but does not think so. She regrets even fighting with Kanade later in the story, because she feels <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> great friends with her. She disappears after the graduation ceremony.|$|E

Images of the victim's clothing have been featured on websites, National Center for Missing and Exploited Children posters, and in various news reports, in an effort to identify her. The victim had been walking or running through a wooded area before her death, as scratches on her body suggested.|$|E
25|$|Isabella di Morra {{was born}} into a noble family in Favale (now Valsinni, in the {{province}} of Matera), at the time part of the Kingdom of Naples. She was the daughter of Giovanni Michele di Morra, baron of Favale, and Luisa Brancaccio, a noblewoman belonging to a Neapolitan family. Her birthdate is uncertain: generally, reference is made to the study by Benedetto Croce which puts it around 1520, although <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> born earlier, about 1515 or 1516.|$|E
25|$|On February 16, 2010, Braintree {{officials}} {{announced that the}} files previously declared missing had been located and turned over to Norfolk County prosecutors. Norfolk County District Attorney William Keating concluded, based upon these files, that probable cause existed in 1986 to arrest and charge Amy Bishop for crimes committed after she fled the house. She had taken the shotgun to a nearby auto dealership shop and brandished it at two employees {{in an attempt to}} get a car. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> charged with assault with a dangerous weapon, carrying a dangerous weapon, and unlawful possession of ammunition.|$|E

25|$|Midna has {{received}} mostly positive reception {{from both the}} video game press and the public {{for her role in}} Twilight Princess. Game Informer editor Andrew Reiner stated that she, along with Link's wolf transformation, had incredible effects on Twilight Princess gameplay. Fellow Game Informer editor Billy Berghammer stated that he loved Midna, describing her as a cool character due to how she messed with Link throughout the game. 1UP.com editor Jeremy Parish stated that the supporting characters of Twilight Princess make up for Link's laconic nature, Midna more so than others. He described her as being acerbic and thoughtful, as well as an intricate character who moves the plot forward for her own means. While America's Intelligence Wire editor Dave Arey described her as intriguing, he felt that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> more so if Nintendo had developed her further. GamesRadar listed her as one of the 25 best new characters of the decade, stating that before Midna, the only characters they could relate to were Link, Princess Zelda, and Ganon. RPGamer editor Matthew Rickert stated that he found nothing intriguing or likable about her, complaining about how much more plot time she receives in spite of this, arguing that she offers little help to Link and that it felt like she had replaced Zelda in Twilight Princess.|$|E

In [...] "Homer's Paternity Coot" [...] (season 17, 2006), Marge states that Emerald would have been her birthstone if she had been born three months later, placing her birthday sometime in February. [...] In [...] "Regarding Margie" [...] (season 17, 2006), Homer mentioned that Marge was his age, meaning <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> anywhere between 36 and 40. In the season eighteen episode [...] "Marge Gamer" [...] she states that she and actor Randy Quaid share the same birthdate (October 1).|$|E
500|$|Kronshtadt (...) {{was built}} by the Shipyard No. 194, Marti in Leningrad. She was laid down 30 November 1939 and judged 10.6% {{complete}} when the Germans invaded. Her building slip was too short for her entire length so her stern was built separately. Some of her material was used during the Siege of Leningrad to repair other ships and in defensive works, but <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> finished {{after the end of}} the war. Proposals were made to complete her as an aircraft carrier and as a base ship for a whaling flotilla, but both ideas were rejected and she was ordered scrapped on 24 March 1947. Her dismantling began shortly afterwards and was completed the following year.|$|E
500|$|Yuuma is the reincarnation of Sirix's wife , a maiden who {{captured}} {{the hearts of}} men with her beauty and kindness. Yuuma retains Serena's feminine face and is often mistaken for a female. As a result, he aims to become more masculine to stop the confusion. [...] Yuuma develops a secret crush on Mii early in the series, but his feelings are not reciprocated. He decides {{to give up on}} those feelings believing Keidai and Mii belong together and tries to push them together in order to help Keidai move on from Serena. It is revealed that Serena was reborn as a boy because in her final moments she felt that had she been a man, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> at Sirix's side {{in the final days of}} Pompeii, rather than be left behind waiting for him.|$|E

500|$|Nefertiti (meaning [...] "the {{beautiful}} one {{has come}} forth") was the 14th-centuryBC Great Royal Wife (chief consort) of the Egyptian Pharaoh Akhenaten of the Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt. Akhenaten initiated a new monotheistic form of worship called Atenism {{dedicated to the}} Sun disc Aten. Little is known about Nefertiti. Theories suggest <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> an Egyptian royal by birth, a foreign princess or {{the daughter of a}} high government official named Ay, who became pharaoh after Tutankhamun. She may have been the co-regent of Egypt with Akhenaten, who ruled from 1352BC to 1336BC. Nefertiti bore six daughters to Akhenaten, one of whom, Ankhesenpaaten (renamed Ankhesenamun after the suppression of the Aten cult), married Tutankhamun, Nefertiti's stepson. Nefertiti was thought to have disappeared from history in the twelfth year of Akhenaten's reign, though whether this is due to her death or because she took a new name is not known. She may also have later become a pharaoh in her own right, ruling alone for a short time after her husband's death. However, it is now known that she was still alive in the sixteenth year of her husband's reign from a limestone quarry inscription found at Dayr Abū Ḥinnis. Dayr Abū Ḥinnis is located [...] "on {{the eastern side of the}} Nile, about ten kilometres north of Amarna." ...|$|E
500|$|Friday saw {{yet more}} {{witnesses}} for the prosecution, {{bringing the total}} brought by Davy to about 60. [...] The defence questioned several of those present at the original search of Wells's house. [...] Canning's uncle, Thomas Colley, was cross-examined about what his niece ate on her visit of New Year's Day, the prosecution apparently seeking to establish whether or not <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> sustained for a month by the bread she {{claimed to have been}} given. [...] On the third day of the trial, Mrs Canning was brought to the stand. [...] One possible line of defence for her daughter was simply that she was too stupid to have ever invented the tale, but under cross-examination by Davy Mrs Canning demonstrated that her daughter was capable of writing [...] "a little". [...] This, in Davy's view, was sufficient to demonstrate that she was certainly no imbecile. [...] Scarrat was questioned next, and admitted that he had been to Wells's house before Canning had disappeared. [...] Two of Canning's neighbours testified to her [...] "deplorable condition". [...] Her employer was questioned, as was her apothecary, who thought that Canning would have been quite able to survive on the pitcher of water and crusts of bread she claimed to have been given. [...] The defence responded with three witnesses, who each believed that they had encountered a [...] "poor, miserable wretch" [...] at the end of January, when she claimed to have escaped.|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to Woodstock, Joplin also had problems at Madison Square Garden, in 1969. Biographer Myra Friedman said she witnessed a duet Joplin sang with Tina Turner during The Rolling Stones {{concert at the}} Garden on Thanksgiving Day. Friedman said Joplin was [...] "so drunk, so stoned, so out of control, that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> an institutionalized psychotic rent by mania." [...] During another Garden concert where she had solo billing on December 19, some observers believed Joplin tried to incite the audience to riot. For part of this concert she was joined onstage by Johnny Winter and Paul Butterfield.|$|E
2500|$|Castor's defense team—attorneys Charles Keller and Todd Smith—was set on {{creating}} reasonable doubt in the jury's minds about Castor having committed the murders. They wanted to [...] "poke holes" [...] in Ashley's {{version of what}} happened and prove that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> capable of murder at age 11. They noted Ashley's father, Wallace, showing favoritism toward his younger daughter rather than Ashley and cited jealousy as a possible motive for Ashley having murdered {{at such a young}} age. For her stepfather, they noted his and Ashley's tumultuous relationship and how they did not get along with each other. Castor's mother believed her granddaughter Ashley to be guilty. In a final attempt to convince the jury that she was not guilty, Castor took the stand.|$|E
