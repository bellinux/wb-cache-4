Modern staircases have been installed in the building to contrast the old and new. A spiral staircase which leads to the roof of the old museum building was restored. The windows and doors were conserved and the original type and size of timber and 18th century carpentry techniques were used to restore the timber windows and doors.

50|$|The sludge {{age of the}} B-stage is {{typically}} between 8 and 20 days promoting the growth of nitrifiers. Therefore, complete nitrification is usually achieved in the B-stage. Complete denitrification is difficult to achieve, because of the low C:N ratio in the influent of the B-stage. Insufficient carbon supply of carbon source to the B-stage occurs due to the high efficiency of organic matter removal in the A-stage. The problem can be solved by decreasing organic matter removal in the A-stage, external carbon <b>source</b> <b>supply,</b> intermittent aeration or decreased HRT of the A-stage and/or on-line control of certain operational parameters. To achieve biological nitrogen and phosphorus removal anaerobic and anoxic compartments are introduced before the aerated zone of the B-stage.|$|E
5000|$|Series {{regulators}} {{are the more}} common form; they are more efficient than shunt designs. The series regulator works by providing a path from the supply voltage to the load through a variable resistance, usually a transistor (in this role it is usually termed the series pass transistor); {{it is in the}} [...] "top half" [...] of the voltage divider - the bottom half being the load. The power dissipated by the regulating device is equal to the power supply output current times the voltage drop in the regulating device. For efficiency and reduced stress on the pass transistor, designs try to minimize the voltage drop but not all circuits regulate well once the input (unregulated) voltage comes close to the required output voltage; those that do are termed Low Dropout regulators, A series regulator can usually only <b>source</b> (<b>supply)</b> current, unlike shunt regulators.|$|E

50|$|Umbelopsis isabellina, {{which used}} to be mis-classified as Mortierella isabellina, {{produces}} γ-linolenic acid, an important poly-unsaturated fatty acid. It was re-classified as belonging to the genus Umbelopsis in part based on its fatty acid profile, in addition to classical ribosomal DNA sequencing. Various poly-unsaturated fatty acids including arachidonic acid are produced by Mortierella alpina. Poly-unsaturated fatty acids contain two or more double bonds and are the acyl components of cellular lipids. Today, long-chain poly-unsaturated fatty acids are regarded as substances with beneficial potential in pharmaceutic and nutritional applications. They also serve a wide variety of purposes, from being a purely structural element in phospholipids to being involved in signal transduction, and as a substrate for a host of derivatives involved in second messenger function. Many species of the genus Mortierella have been found to yield exceptionally high quantities of arachidonic acid depending on the fermentation media and culture conditions. Fatty acids are normally produced in submerged culture with high carbon <b>source</b> <b>supply,</b> although this technique has drawbacks with respect to energy consumption and waste water production. In the long run, fatty acid fermentation needs to be done under economically reasonable solid-state fermentation conditions.|$|E

[...] "...uncovering the structure of connections among individuals involved in criminal enterprise will contribute {{to our understanding of}} how illicit markets function.

[...] The created network should capture the roles, functions, and structures of the groups involved in the illicit drug commodity chain and reveal the links in the supply chain (i.e. <b>source,</b> <b>supply,</b> sales, and feeders). Using the created network the resiliency is determined by assessing the clusters in subgroups, identifying pivotal individuals holding central positions, and quantifying the potential to disrupt commodity and information flow by identifying the specific nodes to be removed for maximum effect. This study has three hypothesis: [...] "Hypothesis 1: Individuals involved in production and transporting...will exhibit high small-world properties....Hypothesis 2: those involved in supplying drugs will be characterized by both small-world and scale-free properties as suppliers tend to belong to loosely organized clusters of people...with a few highly connected individuals - hubs.
