5|$|Allowing Madigan and Stillwell's parties a head-start, Mawson, Ninnis, Mertz and the {{seventeen}} dogs left Cape Denison {{early in}} the afternoon, reaching Aladdin's Cave four hours later. Stopping for the night, they took on extra supplies and rearranged the <b>sledges.</b> The first team of dogs would haul a train of two <b>sledges,</b> which collectively carried half {{the weight of the}} party's supplies. The remaining supplies were put on the third sledge, towed by the second dog team.|$|E
5|$|On 14 March, {{with the}} ship at 84°4′N, the pair finally began their polar march. This was their third attempt to leave the ship; on 26 February and again on the 28th, damage to <b>sledges</b> had forced them to return after {{travelling}} short distances. After these mishaps Nansen thoroughly overhauled his equipment, minimised the travelling stores, recalculated weights and reduced the convoy to three <b>sledges,</b> before giving the order to start again. A supporting party accompanied the pair and shared the first night's camp. The next day, Nansen and Johansen skied on alone.|$|E
5|$|Scott {{had decided}} on a mixed {{transport}} strategy, relying on contributions from dogs, motor <b>sledges</b> and ponies. He appointed Cecil Meares {{to take charge of}} the dog teams, and recruited Shackleton's former motor specialist, Bernard Day, to run the motor <b>sledges.</b> Oates would {{be in charge of the}} ponies, but as he could not join the expedition until May 1910, Scott instructed Meares, who knew nothing of horses, to buy them—with unfortunate consequences for their quality and performance.|$|E

5|$|Between November 1775 and February 1776, Colonel Henry Knox {{and a team}} of {{engineers}} used <b>sledges</b> to retrieve 60 tons of heavy artillery that had been captured at Fort Ticonderoga. Bringing them across the frozen Hudson and Connecticut rivers in a difficult, complex operation, they arrived back at Cambridge on January 24, 1776.|$|E
5|$|On {{the evening}} of 13 December Mawson and Mertz rearranged the <b>sledges.</b> The rear-most sledge, which had carried the most weight, was well-worn, {{and they decided to}} abandon it. The {{remaining}} supplies were re-distributed between the remaining two <b>sledges.</b> Most of the important supplies—the tent and most of the food—were stored on the new rear sledge; if they were to lose a sledge down a crevasse, they reasoned, it would be the front, less-vital sledge. As the rear sledge was heavier, the strongest of remaining dogs were assigned to pull it. At the camp they left a small amount of supplies, including the abandoned sledge and a tent cover, without the floor or poles.|$|E
5|$|After Mawson {{slipped into}} a crevasse, they began to tie {{themselves}} to their <b>sledges</b> as a precaution. Ninnis developed photokeratitis (snow-blindness), which Mawson treated with zinc sulfate and cocaine hydrochloride. They were also losing dogs; one broke his leg and was shot, another fell ill, and a third was lost down a crevasse. On 24 November, the party reached {{the eastern side of}} the glacier and ascended to the plateau.|$|E

5|$|In {{the past}} Mérens horses {{were used for}} farm work, {{particularly}} on steep or difficult terrain, as packhorses and for draft work in mining or hauling timber or <b>sledges.</b> Today, following breeding selection towards a slightly taller and livelier type, they are used principally as saddle horses, especially for trekking in mountainous areas; but have also proved successful in carriage driving.

5|$|Nansen's {{farthest}} north record {{lasted for}} just over five years. On 24 April 1900 {{a party of}} three from an Italian expedition led by the Duke of the Abruzzi reached 86°34′N, having left Franz Josef Land with dogs and <b>sledges</b> on 11 March. The party barely made it back; one of their support groups of three men vanished entirely.|$|E
5|$|On {{level ground}} again, {{they began to}} make quick progress. They awoke {{on the morning of}} 27 November to find another glacier (later known as the Ninnis Glacier) far larger than the first. As with the first glacier, they had to unhitch the dogs from the <b>sledges</b> and slowly make the treacherous descent. Once {{at the bottom of the}} glacier they spent four days {{crossing}} fields of crevasses, battling strong winds and poor light that made navigation difficult.|$|E

5|$|The aim of {{the first}} season's depot-laying was to place a series of depots on the Barrier from its edge (Safety Camp) down to 80°S, for use on the polar journey which would begin the {{following}} spring. The final depot would be the largest, and would be known as One Ton Depot. The work was {{to be carried out}} by 12men, the 8fittest ponies, and two dog teams; ice conditions prevented the use of the motor <b>sledges.</b>|$|E
5|$|The papery bark of {{the white}} birch tree (Betula papyrifera) was used {{extensively}} by Native Americans. Wigwams were covered by it and canoes were constructed from it. Other uses included food containers, hunting and fishing equipment, musical instruments, toys and <b>sledges.</b> Nowadays, bark chips, a by-product of the timber industry, are used as a mulch and as a growing medium for epiphytic plants that need a soil-free compost.|$|E
5|$|The second depot-laying party left Framheim on 22February, {{with eight}} men, seven <b>sledges</b> and forty-two dogs. Conditions on the Barrier had {{deteriorated}} sharply; average temperatures had dropped by 9°C (16°F), and rough snow had drifted across the previously smooth ice surface. In temperatures sometimes {{as low as}} , on 3March the party reached 81°S, where they established a second depot. Amundsen, Helmer Hanssen, Prestrud, Johansen and Wisting then continued with the strongest dogs, hoping to reach 83°S, but in difficult conditions they halted at 82°S on 8March. Amundsen {{could see that the}} dogs were exhausted; the party turned for home, and with light <b>sledges</b> travelled swiftly to reach Framheim on 22 March. Amundsen wanted more supplies taken south before the impending polar night made travel impossible, and on 31 March a party of seven men led by Johansen left Framheim for the 80°S depot with six slaughtered seals— of meat. The party returned on 11 April—three days later than expected—after they strayed into a field of crevasses.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the position of a <b>sledge</b> hockey player in their <b>sledge</b> using measurements of knee angle, seat height, and stability. Prior to this study, <b>sledge</b> hockey coaches and athletes used trivial methods to position a player in their seat. Proper positioning can enhance performance and function of the athlete. Nine different positions were evaluated using two on-ice <b>sledge</b> hockey specific tests. Four experienced male <b>sledge</b> hockey players from the London Blizzard who compete in the Ontario <b>Sledge</b> Hockey Association participated in this study. The results suggest a knee angle of 140 º with a medium knuckle height produced on average the fastest times (...|$|R

5|$|Assisting {{him on this}} Far Eastern Party {{would be}} Belgrave Edward Sutton Ninnis, a {{lieutenant}} in the Royal Fusiliers, and the Swiss ski expert Xavier Mertz. They {{were in charge of}} the expedition's sledge dogs—Greenland Huskies—who would be crucial if the party was to cover the distance at the speed Mawson intended. Ninnis and Mertz had spent the winter preparing the dogs for the journey, sewing harnesses and teaching them to run in teams with the <b>sledges.</b> Each of the parties was required to return to Cape Denison by 15 January 1913, to allow time for the Aurora to collect them and escape Antarctic waters unencumbered by the winter sea ice.|$|E
5|$|Built by Blohm & Voss {{at their}} yard in Hamburg, Derfflingers keel was laid in January 1912. She {{was to have}} been {{launched}} on 14 June 1913, but the wooden <b>sledges</b> upon which the ship rested became jammed; the ship moved only 30–40 centimeters. A second attempt was successful on 12 July 1913. A crew composed of dockyard workers took the ship around the Skagen to Kiel. In late October, the vessel was assigned to the I Scouting Group, but damage to the ship's turbines during trials prevented her from joining the unit until 16 November.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{eagerness to}} start out again, Amundsen waited until mid-October and the first hints of spring. He was ready to leave on 15October, but was held up by the weather {{for a few more}} days. On 19October 1911 the five men, with four <b>sledges</b> and fifty-two dogs, began their journey. The weather quickly worsened, and in heavy fog the party strayed into the field of crevasses that Johansen's depot party had {{discovered}} the previous autumn. Wisting later recalled how his sledge, with Amundsen aboard, nearly disappeared down a crevasse when the snow bridge broke underneath it.|$|E

5|$|Sverdrup's {{main task}} now {{was to keep}} his crew busy. He ordered a {{thorough}} spring cleaning, and set a party to chip {{away some of the}} surrounding ice which was threatening to destabilise the ship. Although there was no immediate danger to Fram, Sverdrup oversaw the repair and overhaul of <b>sledges,</b> and the organisation of provisions should it after all be necessary to abandon ship and march to land. With the arrival of warmer weather as the 1895 summer approached, Sverdrup resumed daily ski practice. Amid these activities a full programme of meteorological, magnetic and oceanographic activities continued under Scott Hansen; Fram had become a moving oceanographic, meteorological and biological laboratory.|$|E
5|$|The crew {{spent the}} rest of the 1894–95 winter {{preparing}} clothing and equipment for the forthcoming sledge journey. Kayaks were built, to be carried on the <b>sledges</b> until needed for the crossing of open water. Preparations were interrupted early in January when violent tremors shook the ship. The crew disembarked, fearing that the vessel would be crushed, but Fram proved herself equal to the danger. On 8 January 1895 the ship's position was 83°34′N, above Greely's previous Farthest North record of 83°24.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the {{expedition}} Nansen continued {{to experiment with}} equipment and techniques, altering the designs of skis and <b>sledges</b> and investigating types of clothing, tents and cooking apparatus, thereby revolutionising methods of Arctic travel. In the era of polar exploration which followed his return, explorers routinely sought Nansen's advice as to methods and equipment—although sometimes they chose not to follow it, usually to their cost. According to Huntford, the South Pole heroes Amundsen, Scott, and Ernest Shackleton were all Nansen's acolytes.|$|E
