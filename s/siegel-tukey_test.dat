40|$|Abstract The {{leopard shark}} (Triakis semifasciata) is an {{important}} predator in coastal marine ecosystems of Califor-nia, targeted by recreational and commercial Wshermen and of speciWc interest in Wsheries management. From October 2003 to August 2006, 169 leopard sharks were collected from the coast of California (between 40. 750 °N and 32. 678 °N) and analyzed for mitochondrial and nuclear genetic structure. Analyses of mtDNA control region sequences revealed relatively low levels of genetic variation (Wve haplotypes, average pairwise divergence = 0. 0067). In contrast, leopard sharks were highly polymorphic for inter simple sequence repeats (ISSRs), which characterize {{a broad range of}} the nuclear genome. The null hypothesis of panmixia in California waters was rejected for both genetic markers, and ISSRs displayed a statistically signiWcant pat-tern of isolation by distance (IBD) across the species range (P = 0. 002). A variety of analyses showed that divergence is most pronounced in the northernmost population of Humboldt Bay. Natal philopatry in T. semifasciata was <b>tested</b> using <b>Siegel-Tukey</b> <b>tests</b> on data partitioned by breeding site status, and sex-speciWc philopatry was tested by comparing IBD plots between sexes. Although there was some evidence for natal philopatry in leopard sharks (P = 0. 038), and population divergence {{may be related to the}} proximity of breeding sites (P = 0. 064), we found no support for sex-speciWc philopatry. In addition to identify-ing a novel set of highly variable genetic markers for use in shark population studies, these results may be used to better inform management decisions for leopard sharks in Califor-nia...|$|R
40|$|The author {{examined}} how, in {{the context}} of experimental design, one might become aware of the Behrens-Fisher problem (heteroscedasticity) in order to apply an approximate solution, such as the Yuen 2 ̆ 7 s statistic (1974). It was expected that both the Mood-Westenberg dispersion test (1948) and the <b>Siegel-Tukey</b> <b>test</b> (1960) would remain robust with respect to Type I and Type II error properties (and associated power levels) for detecting variance changes when their assumptions of equal means was slightly violated (i. e., the Behrens-Fisher problem). With the use of Monte Carlo Simulations, the author reviewed 34, 606 permutations composed of interactions between various sample sizes, alpha levels, distributions/data sets, variance changes and means shifts. While the Mood-Westenberg (1948) and Siegel-Tukey (1960) tests both remained robust under certain conditions with respect to Type I and II error properties, the <b>Siegel-Tukey</b> <b>test</b> (1960) was by far the most robust of the two statistics, able to handle a more diverse set of conditions and would therefore be the statistic of choice in identifying the Behrens-Fisher problem...|$|E
40|$|The exact {{distribution}} {{of a test}} statistic ultimately guarantees that {{the probability of a}} Type I error is exactly α. Several methods for estimating the exact {{distribution of}} a test statistic have evolved over the years with inherent computational problems and varying degrees of accuracy. The unique pattern of permutations resulting from using experimental data to sample within the permutation space without the risk of repeating permutations is identified. The method presented circumvents the theoretical requirements of asymptotic procedures and the computational difficulties associated with an exhaustive enumeration of permutations. Results show that time and space complexities are drastically reduced without compromising accuracy even when enumeration is not exhaustive provided error tolerance is achieved. The exact distribution of the <b>Siegel-Tukey</b> <b>test</b> statistic is examined as an illustration...|$|E

40|$|The R-package jmuOutlier, which {{contains}} functions for performing nonparametric statistical analyses, is introduced. This R-package is quite simplistic, and {{is intended to}} accompany undergraduate textbooks on nonparametric statistics. The main objectives of this R-package include the following: using R for running a permutation test on a mean, median, or any other statistic; running a permutation F-test on the dierence between location parameters, without using an asymptotic approximation to the F-distribution; running a permutation test on Pearson and Spearman correlation, without using an asymptotic approximation to the normal or t- distribution; running the permutation <b>Siegel-Tukey</b> <b>test</b> in both the forward and reverse directions and the ratio mean deviance test on the dierence between scale parameters. Additionally, this R-package provides exact power calculations using the binomial test, provides exact condence intervals on percentiles (based on the binomial test), plots two empirical cumulative distribution functions on the same graph, and produces van derWaerden and exponential scores. The aim is to perform these tests based on either all permutations or {{a large number of}} simulated permutations, to obtain p-values without using asymptotic approximations. The greatest contribution of this R-package is simplicity, in that an elementary understanding of R is sucient when using this package. We conclude that students can both learn nonparametric statistics and perform analyses using this R-package, with just a basic understanding of R...|$|E
