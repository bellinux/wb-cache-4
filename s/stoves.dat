5|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} is {{a product}} of combustion of organic matter under conditions of restricted oxygen supply, which prevents complete oxidation to carbon dioxide (CO2). Sources of carbon monoxide include cigarette smoke, house fires, faulty furnaces, heaters, wood-burning <b>stoves,</b> internal combustion vehicle exhaust, electrical generators, propane-fueled equipment such as portable <b>stoves,</b> and gasoline-powered tools such as leaf blowers, lawn mowers, high-pressure washers, concrete cutting saws, power trowels, and welders. Exposure typically occurs when equipment is used in buildings or semi-enclosed spaces.|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to determine the influence of <b>stove</b> characteristics to production cost price, sale price, and profitability. The research results showed that the <b>stove</b> characteristics influenced the production cost price of barong statue. The production cost price of barong statue by small <b>stove</b> was Rp 93. 495, 95 each unit, by medium <b>stove</b> was Rp 91. 423, 81 each unit, and by big <b>stove</b> was Rp 89. 040, 23 each unit. The cost price of production of barong statue decreased 2, 21 % for medium <b>stove,</b> and 4, 76 % for big <b>stove.</b> From the financial management side, the good management of financial resources in manufacturing barong statue could create more accurate the production cost price; the <b>stove</b> characteristics influenced cost price of barong statue. The sale price of barong statue by small size <b>stove</b> was Rp 121. 539, 54 each unit, by medium <b>stove</b> was Rp 118. 850, 95 each unit, and by the big <b>stove</b> was Rp 115. 752, 30 each unit. The sale price of barong statue decreased 2, 21 % for medium <b>stove,</b> and 4, 76 % for big <b>stove.</b> The determination of cost price exactly could create financial structure well because cost price is an element of sales; and the <b>stove</b> characteristics influenced the profitability of barong statue. The profitability of barong statue by small <b>stove</b> was 11, 54 %, by medium <b>stove</b> was 11, 54 %, and by big <b>stove</b> was 11, 54 %. The profitability of barong statue did not differ from the small, medium and big <b>stove.</b> The management of fire <b>stove</b> and productive assets effectively could increase profitability as part of financial management for short term, middle term, and long term...|$|R

5|$|The true {{number of}} cases of carbon {{monoxide}} poisoning is unknown, since many non-lethal exposures go undetected. From the available data, carbon monoxide poisoning is {{the most common cause of}} injury and death due to poisoning worldwide. Poisoning is typically more common during the winter months. This is due to increased domestic use of gas furnaces, gas or kerosene space heaters, and kitchen <b>stoves</b> during the winter months, which if faulty and/or used without adequate ventilation, may produce excessive carbon monoxide. Carbon monoxide detection and poisoning also increases during power outages, when electric heating and cooking appliances become inoperative and residents may temporarily resort to fuel-burning space heaters, <b>stoves,</b> and grills (some of which are safe only for outdoor use but nonetheless are errantly burned indoors).|$|E

50|$|Keeping the air flowing {{correctly}} {{through a}} wood-burning <b>stove</b> {{is essential for}} safe and efficient operation of the <b>stove.</b> Fresh air needs to enter the wood compartment to provide oxygen fuel for the fire; as the fire burns, the smoke {{must be allowed to}} rise through the <b>stove</b> pipes, and exit through the chimney.

5|$|Pig iron is not pure iron, but has 4–5% carbon {{dissolved}} {{in it with}} small amounts of other impurities like sulfur, magnesium, phosphorus and manganese. As the carbon is the major impurity, the iron (pig iron) becomes brittle and hard.

5|$|Since the Middle Ages, most {{dwellings}} were log {{houses with}} notched corners, carefully crafted to ensure {{protection against the}} elements.

5|$|Biomass {{for heat}} and {{power is a}} fully mature {{technology}} which offers a ready disposal mechanism for municipal, agricultural, and industrial organic wastes. However, the industry has remained relatively stagnant over the decade to 2007, even though demand for biomass (mostly wood) continues to grow in many developing countries. One {{of the problems of}} biomass is that material directly combusted in cook <b>stoves</b> produces pollutants, leading to severe health and environmental consequences, although improved cook stove programmes are alleviating some of these effects. First-generation biomass technologies can be economically competitive, but may still require deployment support to overcome public acceptance and small-scale issues.|$|E
5|$|Ever {{since the}} Han dynasty (202 BC – 220 AD), the Chinese had drilled deep {{boreholes}} to transport natural gas from bamboo pipelines to <b>stoves</b> where cast iron evaporation pans boiled brine to extract salt. During the Tang dynasty, a gazetteer of Sichuan province stated {{that at one}} of these 182m (600ft) 'fire wells', men collected natural gas into portable bamboo tubes which could be carried around for dozens of km (mi) and still produce a flame. These were essentially the first gas cylinders; Robert Temple assumes some sort of tap was used for this device.|$|E
5|$|Sinification of the Yue and Dian tribes {{was brought}} about by a {{combination}} of Han imperial military power, regular Han Chinese settlement and an influx of Han Chinese refugees. The military invasions and an influx Han Chinese immigrants created a culture that merged Han Chinese traditions with indigenous elements. Archaeological digs in the area reveal the extent of Han Chinese influence. Han dynasty tombs in Guangzhou, Guangdong show that the native tools and ceramics were gradually replaced by those modeled after Chinese styles by the Western Han. Excavations from the period have uncovered bronze mirrors, <b>stoves,</b> wells, incense burners, tripods, and lanterns manufactured {{in the style of the}} Han.|$|E
50|$|Franklin's <b>stove</b> {{contained}} a baffle {{directly behind the}} fire, which forced the fire's fumes to flow downward before they reached the chimney.

40|$|This study {{examined}} measures of clean cookstove adoption after improved solid fuel <b>stove</b> programmes in three geographically and culturally diverse rural Andean settings and explored {{factors associated with}} these measures. A questionnaire was administered to 1200 households on <b>stove</b> use and cooking behaviours including previously defined factors associated with clean cookstove adoption. Logistic multivariable regressions with 16 pre-specified explanatory variables were performed for three outcomes; (1) daily improved solid fuel <b>stove</b> use, (2) use of liquefied petroleum gas <b>stove</b> and (3) traditional <b>stove</b> displacement. Eighty-seven percent of households reported daily improved solid fuel <b>stove</b> use, 51 % liquefied petroleum gas <b>stove</b> use and 66 % no longer used the traditional cookstove. Variables associated {{with one or more}} of the three outcomes are: education, age and civil status of the reporting female, household wealth and size, region, encounters of problems with the improved solid fuel <b>stove,</b> knowledge of somebody able to build an improved solid fuel <b>stove,</b> whether <b>stove</b> parts are obtainable in the community, and subsidy schemes.
