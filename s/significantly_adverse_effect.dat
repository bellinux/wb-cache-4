40|$|To {{evaluate}} the prognostic impact of monosomal karyotype on post-remission outcome in acute myeloid leukemia, we retrospectively analyzed 2, 099 {{patients who had}} achieved complete remission. Monosomal karyotype was noted in 73 patients (4 %). Of these, the probability of overall survival from first complete remission was 14 % at four years, which was significantly lower than that reported in patients without monosomal karyotype, primarily due to a high relapse rate (86 %). Monosomal karyotype remained significantly associated with worse overall survival among patients with unfavorable cytogenetics or complex karyotype, and even in patients who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation during first complete remission. These findings confirm that monosomal karyotype has a <b>significantly</b> <b>adverse</b> <b>effect</b> on post-remission outcome in patients with acute myeloid leukemia treated with and without allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation in first complete remission, emphasizing {{the need for the}} development of alternative therapies for this patient population...|$|E
40|$|Twenty-one {{patients}} were followed {{for an average}} of 40 months following occlusion of femoropopliteal vein grafts. Serial recordings of the resting ankle pressure index and treadmill walking time were correlated with the patient's clinical status, and compared to the preoperative values. Graft failure resulted in a return to preoperative status in ten of 11 limb salvage patients. There were 5 amputations, 3 died of unrelated causes, and 2 were subsequently improved by further reconstructions. At last followup, 3 of 10 patients who were operated on for claudication were unchanged, 6 were improved, and one became worse. In no case did graft failure result in the development of advanced ischemia. Femoropopliteal graft failure did not have a <b>significantly</b> <b>adverse</b> <b>effect</b> on limb function or survival in patients presenting with claudication, nor did it complicate the subsequent course of patients in whom the initial aim was limb salvage...|$|E

40|$|When {{culturally}} different {{children are}} referred for suspected emotional/behavioral disorders, their native cultural customs and beliefs must be considered. The misuse or misinterpretation of assessment and referral data may have <b>significantly</b> <b>adverse</b> <b>effects</b> upon children, especially children from different cultures. Recently, educators have ex-amined {{the dynamics of}} the multidisciplinary team's decision-making process concerning placement into special education (Ysseldyke and Algozzine 1982). Specifically investigated was the impact of the reason for referral upon decisions to place a child into special education. Results suggest that the reason for referral may be a significant factor in the decision to place a child in special education. Also, children whose referral addressed behavior problems tended to be diagnosed and labeled as emotionally handicapped more frequently than when referrals addressed academic problems (Ysseldyke and Algozzine 1982). Culturally and linguistically different children who have learning disabilities may also have associated emo-tional/behavioral problems. Although a child may have both learning and behavioral problems, the reason for referral, in some instances, may relate primarily to the behavior problems.

Overall, minimum wages have no <b>significantly</b> <b>adverse</b> <b>effect</b> on employment. In particular, the results in the eastern region of China indicate few significant negative effects, which is consistent with the minimum wage theory in the competitive market. In contrast, the central and western regions experience few significantly positive effects, which is consistent with the theory in the monopsony model. The results are robust regardless of ownership (non-state-owned enterprises, collectives, private enterprises, and other types), industry type (manufacturing, wholesale and retail trade, hotel and restaurant), and gender of workers. Low real minimum wages, weak enforcement capabilities, and the buyer's labor marketâthe three factors that may account for the effects of minimum wages on employment in Chinaâare analyzed. ...|$|E

40|$|From near total {{destruction}} forty-one years ago, the Federal Republic of Germany {{has emerged as}} the fourth wealthiest industrialized nation.

The aversion of individual Germans to invest in equity securities can be explained on a number of levels. First, many investors find that fixed-rate bonds and similar securities provide equal if not better yields than stocks, without the concomitant risk. Another significant reason that many small investors in Germany shy away from stock investments is the widely-held belief that the markets are, to some extent, 2 ̆ 2 fixed; 2 ̆ 2 in particular, that insiders and speculators retain a significant advantage over the common investor.

40|$|This report {{examines}} {{the level and}} changes in female and male participation rates, employment segregation, and female wages relative to male wages across the world economy. It funds sufficient {{evidence to support the}} view that labor markets in developing countries are transformed relatively quickly in the sense that gender differentials in employment and pay are narrowing much faster than they did inindustrialized countries. However, the report evaluates the inefficiencies arising from persisting gender differentials in the labor market and finds them to be potentially significant. The estimates also indicate that the resulting deadweight losses are borne primarily by women while men gain mainly in relative terms-there are no real winners from discrimination. The paper concludes that growth benefits women at large, inequalities can have <b>significantly</b> <b>adverse</b> <b>effects</b> on welfare, and market-based development alone can be a weak instrument doe reducing inequality between the sexes. To break the vicious cycle of women's low initial human capital endowments and inferior labor market outcomes compared to men's, the report proposes greater access to education and training for girls and women, enforceable equal pay and equal employment opportunities legislation, a taxation and benefits structure that treats reproduction as an economic activity and women as equal partners within households, and a better accounting of women's work to include invisible production.

40|$|Abstract — Network {{contention}} has a <b>significantly</b> <b>adverse</b> <b>effect</b> on {{the performance}} of parallel applications with increasing size of parallel machines. Machines of the petascale era are forcing application developers to map tasks intelligently to job partitions to achieve the best performance possible. This paper presents a framework for automated mapping of parallel applications with regular communication graphs to two and three dimensional mesh and torus networks. This framework will save much {{effort on the part of}} application developers to generate mappings for their individual applications. One component of the framework is a process topology analyzer to find regular patterns and if found, to determine the dimensions of the communication graphs of applications. The other component is a suite of heuristic techniques for mapping 2 D object grids to 2 D and 3 D processor meshes. The framework chooses the best heuristic from the suite for a given object grid and processor mesh pair based on the hop-bytes metric. We show performance improvements using the framework, for a 2 D Stencil benchmark in MPI and the Weather Research and Forecasting model running on the IBM Blue Gene/P.

40|$|An {{intrinsic}} {{component of}} colorectal carcinogenesis {{may be the}} capacity to activate regenerative responses simultaneously with inhibition of apoptosis. Since apoptosis {{is known to be}} inhibited in colorectal cancer, this study sought evidence for the activation of the REG family of genes which are considered to be activated during regeneration of intestinal mucosa. Transcripts for the REG gene were found in 53 % of colorectal cancers and for the PAP gene in 60 % of colorectal cancers, by RT-PCR. Using in situ hybridization, the REG transcripts were found to be present in the tumour cells themselves rather than inflammatory or stromal cells. There were no significant correlations between the expression of these two genes and tumour stage, age or sex of the patient population or tumour site. However, in patients with non-metastatic disease who underwent ostensibly curative surgery, the expression of REG alone and co-expression of REG with PAP had a highly <b>significantly</b> <b>adverse</b> <b>effect</b> on survival. These data provide support for the concept that, in some tumours, carcinogenesis involves a regenerative process which co-exists with apoptotic inhibition and may provide a valuable selective indicator of the need for adjuvant therapy in those patients with early-stage colorectal cancer whose disease is destined to recur after curative surgery. © 2000 Cancer Research Campaig...|$|E

Aim: In the present study, the ability of lead to adversely affect the male reproductive system was investigated and tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum : Source of antioxidants) paste (TP) was administered orally to prevent the <b>adverse</b> <b>effects</b> of Pb. Materials and Methods: Fifteen Sprague Dawley rats, randomised into three groups (n = 5), were used for this study. Animals in Group A served as the control and were drinking distilled water. Animals in Groups B and C were drinking 1 % Pb (II) acetate (LA). Group C animals were, in addition to drinking LA, treated with 1. 5 ml of TP/day. All treatments were for 8 weeks. Statistical Analysis Used: A Mann-Whitney U -test was used to analyse the results obtained. Results: The obtained results showed that Pb caused {{a significant reduction in}} the testicular weight, sperm count, life-death ratio, sperm motility, normal sperm morphology, and plasma and tissue superoxide dismutase and catalase activity, but a significant increase in plasma and tissue malondialdehyde concentration.

40|$|Background: Several {{population-based}} {{and clinical}} studies report that stress incontinence has less impact on {{quality of life}} (QoL) than urge incontinence and overactive bladder. Aims: This research aimed to determine if this relationship held true for urodynamic diagnoses. Methods: Quality of life was evaluated by the King’s Health Questionnaire prior to urodynamic testing in 326 women presenting with lower urinary tract symptoms and who completed a 48 -h frequency volume chart. Urodynamic results were categorised as ‘normal’, ‘sensory abnormalities only’, ‘idiopathic detrusor overactivity (IDO) only’, ‘urodynamic stress incontinence (USI) only’ or ‘mixed (IDO and USI) ’. QoL data were compared using these diagnostic categories. Results: Women in mixed, USI and IDO categories had significantly worse QoL scores in the domain Severity Measures than women in sensory or normal categories (P < 0. 0001). Incontinence Impact was significantly worse in mixed and IDO categories compared with normal (P = 0. 006) but not compared with women with USI. Sleep/Energy scores were significantly worse for women in mixed and IDO categories compared with women with USI (P = 0. 003). Significant differences between urodynamic categories were also observed in the domains Role Limitations, Social Limitations and General Health. Conclusions: Mixed incontinence had the greatest adverse effect on QoL; however, any abnormal urodynamic diagnosis {{was associated with a}} <b>significantly</b> <b>adverse</b> <b>effect.</b> Although a normal urodynamic result was associated with less impact on QoL than an abnormal result, there was still an effect present.

40|$|The {{weld metal}} {{produced}} {{from a series}} of high productivity welds of 316 LN austenitic stainless steel plate was examined to evaluate the effects of the use of a higher heat input process (> 2. 5 kJ/mm). This high heat input process was aimed at maximising single sided weld metal penetration in a single pass using simple square edge preparations and minimising time consuming handling operations. The evaluation was undertaken by correlating the local microstructure with the local toughness and microhardness of the cap, middle and root of the weld. It was established that the intermetallic phases / carbides present did not appear to have a <b>significantly</b> <b>adverse</b> <b>effect</b> on either corrosion or toughness. The phases observed and confirmed by the use of SAED were predominantly chi (χ) with some sigma(σ). No identifications were made of M 23 C 6 which was observed in other studies of 316 LN welds. A series of impact tests with variations in the notch positions showed that the thickness of the delta ferrite had an effect on the weld metal toughness. As a result of this work it was established that similar volume fractions of delta ferrite did not necessarily produce similar levels of weld metal toughness, but ferrite thickness did appear to have a contributory effect. Welding of 316 LN stainless steel with a single sided single pass submerged arc welding process was satisfactorily undertaken up to 20 mm plate thickness without preheat or post weld heat treatment. The ability to achieve this resulted in significant economic savings within the process for ship panel production combined with satisfactory weld metal properties...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} {{the outcome of}} testicular biopsies {{as well as the}} etiology of azoospermia and severe oligospermia in Saudi men referred for tertiary care. To correlate testicular histology with patients′ clinical and hormonal profiles. Materials and Methods: Charts of men subjected to testicular biopsies in the last 10 -year period were retrospectively reviewed. Relative history and physical examination findings were reported. Results of male fertility profile tests and semen analysis of at least two ejaculates were collected. Reported histopathology was obtained. Results: Reports of 229 patients were included; 199 (86. 9 %) with azoospermia and 30 (13. 1 %) with severe oligospermia. The mean (SD) age was 30. 6 (6. 4) years. A small right or left testis was reported in 88 (38. 4 %) and 87 (38 %) of the patients, respectively. The mean (SD) testosterone and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) values were 17. 2 (7. 2) nmol/L and 13. 1 (10. 9) IU/L, respectively. Hypospermatogenesis was the most common histology encountered (36. 5 %), followed by Sertoli cell-only (SCO) histology (31. 5 %). Low testicular volume (P = 0. 000), high FSH (P = 0. 001) and high leutenizing hormone (LH) (P = 0. 001) were found to be of <b>significantly</b> <b>adverse</b> <b>effect</b> on spermatogenesis. Despite having bilateral small testes, high serum FSH and LH, 24. 3 % of our patients showed active spermatogenesis. Conclusions: Hypospermatogenesis was the most common pattern of spermatogenic defect in our patients. SCO histology was the most common pattern in patients with small testes, primary testicular failure, primary infertility and azoospermia. Low testicular volume, high FSH and LH are significantly associated with impaired spermatogenesis.

40|$|Background: The {{prognosis}} for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) {{is dependent upon}} tumour stage, performance status (PS), severity of underlying liver disease, {{and the availability of}} appropriate therapies. The unavailability of sorafenib may have a <b>significantly</b> <b>adverse</b> <b>effect</b> on the prognosis of UK patients with advanced HCC. During the study period, access to sorafenib was at the discretion of local health funding bodies, a process that may delay or deny access to the drug and that remains in place for Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. Here, we attempt to address the impact of this system on patients with advanced HCC in the United Kingdom. Methods: This is a retrospective study performed in the two largest specialist hepatobiliary oncology units in the United Kingdom. Funding applications were made to local funding bodies for patients with advanced HCC for whom sorafenib was considered appropriate (advanced HCC not suitable for loco-regional therapies, compensated chronic liver disease, PS 0 – 2). Results: A total of 133 applications were made, of which 57 (43 %) were approved and 76 (57 %) declined. Demographics and prognostic factors were balanced between the two groups. This cohort had a number of adverse prognostic features: patients were predominantly PS 1 – 2; the majority had multifocal disease with the largest lesion being 45 cm; and macroscopic vascular invasion, metastases, and AFP 41000 ngml 1, were each present in one-third of cases. The median time from application to funding decision was 17 days (range 3 – 260 days).

The main outcome measure was a global hyperactivity aggregate (GHA), based on aggregated z-scores of observed behaviours and ratings by teachers and parents, plus, for 8 / 9 -year-old children, a computerised test of attention. This clinical trial is registered with Current Controlled Trials (registration number ISRCTN 74481308). Analysis was per protocol. Findings: 16 3 -year-old children and 14 8 / 9 -year-old children did not complete the study, for reasons unrelated to childhood behaviour. Mix A had a <b>significantly</b> <b>adverse</b> <b>effect</b> compared with placebo in GHA for all 3 -year-old children (effect size 0 ? 20 [95 % CI 0 ? 01 – 0 ? 39], p= 0 ? 044) but not mix B versus placebo. This result persisted when analysis was restricted to 3 -year-old children who consumed more than 85 % of juice and had no missing data (0 ? 32 [0 ? 05 – 0 ? 60], p= 0 ? 02). 8 / 9 -year-old children showed a signifi cantly adverse effect when given mix A (0 ? 12 [0 ? 02 – 0 ? 23], p= 0 ? 023) or mix B (0 ? 17 [0 ? 07 – 0 ? 28], p= 0 ? 001) when analysis was restricted to those children consuming at least 85 % of drinks with no missing data.

40|$|Search for {{medicinal}} plants to treat kidney disorders {{is an important}} topic on phytotherapeutical research. Plumbago zeylanica L. is an important medicinal plant with hepatoprotective, anti-inflammatory, anti-diabetic, anti-cancer and anti-hyperlipidemic activities. In the present study, the protective effect of hydroalcoholic extract of P. zeylanica (HAPZ) in cisplatin induced nephrotoxicity was analyzed in Swiss albino mice. Treatment with higher dose (400  mg/kg) of HAPZ <b>significantly</b> reversed the <b>adverse</b> <b>effect</b> of cisplatin on kidney weight, serum urea and creatinine, indicating their renoprotective effect. The antioxidant effect of the drug is evident from its significant effect on Catalase, Glutathione peroxidase and lipid peroxidation activities...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} postharvest hot water {{treatment}} (HWT) {{on the quality}} of ‘Eksotika II’ papaya fruit harvested at different harvesting maturities were investigated. HWT is a method for fruit fly disinfestation which is a quarantine requirement for the fresh papaya exportation industries in Malaysia. Fruit at maturity stages Index 1 (H 1), Index 2 (H 2) and Index 3 (H 3) were harvested. From each maturity stage, one group of the papaya fruit batch was treated with hot water at 47 ± 1 ˚C fruit core temperature held for 10 minutes and another group was untreated. Fruit were left to ripen at ambient temperature (25 ˚C) and were taken into experiment at the subsequent ripening stages at Index 2, Index 3, Index 4 and Index 5. Physiological changes including skin colour (L*a*/b*), weight loss, fruit firmness, total soluble solids (TSS), pH and chlorophyll fluorescence were determined at each different ripening stages. Biochemical changes including total sugar, total reducing sugar, total non-reducing sugar and cell wall degrading enzymes activities such as polygalacturonase (PG), pectin methylesterase (PME), pectate lyase (PL) and cellulase were also investigated. HWT did not give any <b>significantly</b> <b>adverse</b> <b>effect</b> to the physiology parameters evaluated, such as L*a*/b* value, weight loss, TSS and pH. However, the treated Index 3 and Index 4 of H 1 fruit was slightly firmer than the untreated fruit. The chlorophyll fluorescence parameters have shown that within one hour after treatment, the treated fruit experienced heat stress which was reflected in the lower chlorophyll fluorescence parameters values, Fv/Fm. The heat stress was found to be more severe by 14 – 25 % in the H 3 fruit rather than in the H 2 and H 1 fruit. However, the Fv/Fm value in the H 3 fruit recovered by 25 % during the subsequent stages of ripening. Furthermore, the total sugar and the total reducing sugar content were not adversely affected by the HWT. The pattern of cell wall degrading enzymes activity showed that PME activity decreased during ripening, whilst PG, PL and cellulase activity increased progressively during ripening. It was also found that the application of the HWT affected the cell wall degrading enzymes activity whereby it was found to be lower in the heat treated fruit. Nevertheless, pulp firmness was not severely affected since some of the enzyme activities managed to recover during the ripening period. For maximum fruit quality, particularly for export markets, it is recommended that Index 2 fruit are selected for HWT rather than H 1 fruit since the H 1 fruit will ripen poorly. The Index 3 Eksotika II papaya is only suitable for the local market because of its short shelf life. In summary, these observations indicated that the overall Eksotika II papaya fruit quality is still maintained following HWT when the fruit is allowed to ripen at ambient temperature. This suggests that postharvest HWT at 47 °C (fruit core temperature, held for 10 minutes) can maintain the postharvest quality of Eksotika II papaya fruit...|$|E
40|$|Early-stage {{cutaneous}} T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) is a skin-limited lymphoma with no cure {{aside from}} stem cell transplantation. Twelve patients with stage IA-IIA CTCL were {{treated in a}} phase 1 trial of 0. 03 % and 0. 06 % topical resiquimod gel, a Toll-like receptor 7 / 8 agonist. Treated lesions significantly improved in 75 % of patients and 30 % had clearing of all treated lesions. Resiquimod also induced regression of untreated lesions. Ninety-two percent of patients {{had more than a}} 50 % improvement in body surface area involvement by the modified Severity-Weighted Assessment Tool analysis and 2 patients experienced complete clearing of disease. Four of 5 patients with folliculotropic disease also improved <b>significantly.</b> <b>Adverse</b> <b>effects</b> were minor and largely skin limited. T-cell receptor sequencing and flow cytometry studies of T cells from treated lesions demonstrated decreased clonal malignant T cells in 90 % of patients and complete eradication of malignant T cells in 30 %. High responses were associated with recruitment and expansion of benign T-cell clones in treated skin, increased skin T-cell effector functions, and a trend toward increased natural killer cell functions. In patients with complete or near eradication of malignant T cells, residual clinical inflammation was associated with cytokine production by benign T cells. Fifty percent of patients had increased activation of circulating dendritic cells, consistent with a systemic response to therapy. In summary, topical resiquimod is safe and effective in early-stage CTCL and the first topical therapy to our knowledge that can induce clearance of untreated lesions and complete remissions in some patients. This trial was registered at www. clinicaltrials. gov as #NCT 813320...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Albumin {{has been}} {{regarded}} as {{the gold standard for}} maintaining adequate colloid osmotic pressure in children, but increased cost, the lack of clear-cut benefits for survival, and fear of transmission of unknown viruses have contributed to its replacement by hydroxyethyl starch and gelatin preparations. Each of the synthetic colloids has unique physicochemical characteristics that determine their likely efficacy and <b>adverse</b> <b>effect</b> profile. This review will examine {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} the use of different colloid solutions in children with a particular focus on their safety profile. RECENT FINDINGS: Dextrans are rarely used because of their negative effects on coagulation and potential for anaphylactic reactions. Gelatin and albumin have little effect on hemostasis, but the disadvantages of gelatin include its high anaphylactoid potential and limited beneficial volume effect. Tetrastarches have <b>significantly</b> fewer <b>adverse</b> <b>effects</b> on coagulation and renal function than the older hydroxyethyl starches and are now approved for children. Dissolving tetrastarches in a plasma-adapted, balanced solution rather than in saline further improves safety with regard to coagulation and acid-base balance. SUMMARY: Tetrastarches offer the best currently available compromise between cost-effectiveness and safety profile in children with preexisting normal renal function and coagulation...|$|R
30|$|Age-related {{hydroquinone}} (NADH) oxidase (arNOX) is {{a recently}} discovered marker protein associated with aging in man (Morré and Morré 2006 a; Morré et al. 2009). A {{member of the}} ENOX family of enzymes (Morré and Morré 2003), it is unique in that it appears in man only after age 30 and generates superoxide (Morré et al. 2003 a). The protein is shed from the cell surface where it circulates to {{come in contact with}} serum lipoproteins (Morré and Morré 2006 a) and extracellular matrices (Kern et al. 2010) and membranes to potentially <b>significantly</b> contribute to <b>adverse</b> <b>effects</b> of aging on cardiovascular and skin health.|$|R
40|$|Fluoxetine (60 mg), a {{selective}} inhibitor of the reuptake of 5 -HT, was compared in a double-blind trial to amitriptyline (150 mg) {{in a sample}} of 34 patients fitting the Research Diagnostic Criteria for a major depressive disorder. Patients were studied after a drug washout period of 10 days and an active treatment period of 42 days. Sleep polygraphic recordings were performed before {{and at the end of}} the study. As indicated by the significant decrease in the Hamilton Depression scale and the Montgomery Asberg Depression scale, fluoxetine showed similar antidepressant effects to amitriptyline with <b>significantly</b> fewer <b>adverse</b> <b>effects.</b> Fluoxetine and amitriptyline decreased the amount of REM sleep, a well known effect of classical antidepressants. Fluoxetine showed some specific effects on sleep continuity (potentially dose related) as indicated by the significant increase in the number of awakenings and in stage shifts, without interfering with the therapeutic response.

40|$|Some {{specific}} {{features of the}} 24 -hour blood pressure (BP) pattern {{are linked to the}} progressive injury of target tissues and the triggering of cardiac and cerebrovascular events. Thus, there is growing interest in how to best tailor the treatment of hypertensive patients according to the circadian BP pattern of each individual. Significant administration-time differences in the kinetics (i. e., chronokinetics) plus beneficial and <b>adverse</b> <b>effects</b> (i. e., chronodynamics) of antihypertensive medications are well known. Thus, bedtime dosing with nifedipine GITS is more effective than morning dosing, while also <b>significantly</b> reducing <b>adverse</b> <b>effects.</b> The dose-response curve, therapeutic coverage, and efficacy of doxazosin GITS are all markedly dependent on the circadian time of drug administration. Moreover, valsartan administration at bedtime, as opposed to upon wakening, results in an improved diurnal/nocturnal BP ratio, increased percentage of controlled patients, and significant reduction in urinary albumin excretion in hypertensive patients. Chronotherapy provides a means of individualizing the treatment of hypertension according to the circadian BP profile of each patient, and constitutes a new option to optimize BP control and {{to reduce the risk of}} cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction and stroke) and of end-organ injury of the blood vessels and tissue of the heart, brain, kidney, eye, and other organs...|$|R
