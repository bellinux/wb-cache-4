In order to detect such signal and exploit it for <b>small</b> <b>angle</b> scattering investigations neutron detection with sub millimeter spatial resolution is required. Here an approach is reported where instead of a position sensitive detector an absorption grating is used to analyze the beam modulation stepwise.

40|$|Standard error {{correction}} techniques only provide a quantum memory and need extra gadgets to perform computation. Central to quantum algorithms are <b>small</b> <b>angle</b> rotations, {{which can be}} fault-tolerantly implemented given a supply of an unconventional species of magic state. We present a low-cost distillation routine for preparing these <b>small</b> <b>angle</b> magic states. Our protocol builds {{on the work of}} Duclos-Cianci and Poulin [Phys. Rev. A, 91, 042315 (2015) ] by compressing their circuit. Additionally, we present a method of diluting magic states that reduces costs associated with very <b>small</b> <b>angle</b> rotations. We quantify performance by the expected number of noisy magic states consumed per rotation, and compare with other protocols. For modest size angles, our protocols offer a factor 24 improvement over the best known gate synthesis protocols and a factor 2 over the Duclos-Cianci and Poulin protocol. For very <b>small</b> <b>angle</b> rotations, the dilution protocol dramatically reduces costs, giving several orders magnitude improvement over competitors. There also exists an intermediary regime of small, but not very <b>small,</b> <b>angles</b> where our approach gives a marginal improvement over gate synthesis. We discuss how different performance metrics may alter these conclusions. Comment: Author's final version. Extended analysis to higher levels of Clifford hierarchy.
