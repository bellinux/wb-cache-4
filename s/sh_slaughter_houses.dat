40|$|The {{livestock}} marketing {{methods in}} the Ryukyus are not operated satisfactorily. Butchers are taking multiple {{roles in the}} distribution of livestock products. That is, the butchers purchase live-hogs from producers, dress them at the <b>slaughter</b> <b>house,</b> and then directly sell the meat to consumers. The <b>slaughter</b> <b>houses</b> are the center of the hog transaction and occupy an important position in the local market. There are 31 <b>slaughter</b> <b>houses</b> of various sizes on the islands now : 27 in Okinawa Islands; 1 in Miyako; and 3 in Yaeyama. About 280, 000 head of hogs were slaughtered there in 1970. It is often said that the existed <b>slaughter</b> <b>houses</b> hamper the efficient livestock marketing activities. However, no studies were made for them to the present time. The {{purpose of this study is}} to grasp the present status of the <b>slaughter</b> <b>houses</b> and to find out problems that need to be improved. From the analysis of the present <b>slaughter</b> <b>houses,</b> the following problems are found out : 1) Based on the number of hogs slaughtered per year, the number of <b>slaughter</b> <b>houses</b> in operation is large, and in general, most of them are very small in size and operated inefficiently. 2) There are too many butchers in slaughtering work and hog marketing. 3) Management of the small sized <b>slaughter</b> <b>houses</b> is not done successfully, because of a small number of hogs slaughtered and a small income. 4) <b>Slaughter</b> <b>house</b> facilities are very poor in general. With few exceptions, hogs are slaughtered under poor sanitary conditions. Sanitary conditions of the large scale <b>slaughter</b> <b>houses</b> are considered adequate and hog slaughtering facilities are properly maintained. However sanitary conditions of the small scale are far from being adequate. For improving such a situation, consideration should be given reducing the number of the <b>slaughter</b> <b>houses</b> and also the number of the butchers. A new meat center should be formed in main area by a consolidation of the present <b>slaughter</b> <b>houses.</b> The center will have cold storage and operate an auction market for the meat. Therefore, the former methods of livestock and meat transaction should be changed. The Okinawan people have not yet acquired the taste for chilled (frozen) pork and there is little demand for the product. Therefore, a consumer education on chilled (frozen) pork consuption should be initiated by the GRI. Timely market information on supply, demand, and prices will be provided by the center to every producers. This information will assist producers develop a more efficient production and marketing system and make it possible to adjust shipments of hogs, thus contributing to the stabilization of prices. The establishment of a new meat center can eliminate unfair transactions between the butchers and producers such as unfair grading, price discrimination, and other harmful practices of the butchers...|$|R

Further south at Robb Jetty, <b>slaughter</b> <b>houses</b> operated by Forrest, Emanuel & Co, and Connor, Doherty and Durack existed, these <b>slaughter</b> <b>houses</b> essentially supplied all the meat to the metropolitan area and the expanding goldfields. The livestock arriving from the north-west of the state including the Kimberley Region and were unloaded from the ships onto the jetty.

To fulfill the above mentioned objective, the research work was conducted through the questionnaire survey, direct observation, face-to-face interview along with the random sample collection and relevant measures of different factors. The research finding reveals that the total quantity of waste produced from these <b>slaughter</b> <b>houses</b> was 2888. 45 tonnes/year. The management of this volume of waste was found as unsatisfactory by the most of the stakeholder groups due to fail of the conservation of public health and ecosystem of the local community.

This system provides slaughter manager to record the monitoring values of CCP (Critical Control Point) by connecting to Server through Internet. The system was developed by ASP.

Four HACCP models of poultry <b>slaughter</b> <b>house</b> including refrigerated chicken carcasses, frozen chicken cuts, refrigerated waterfowl carcasses, and frozen waterfowl cuts were offered by this system. Users could also append their monitoring items, adjust the control limits, and create new slaughter processes according to individual situation of <b>slaughter</b> <b>house.</b> After setting up of CCP, users selected the CCP items and input the values from monitoring data to accomplish the record. These input values compare with the values user set, to see if it is unusual or not, and saved into database. The output reports can either be selected by one period of a monitoring item, the records of batches, the records of dates, or the records of the abnormal monitoring item, and to help users to evaluate their HACCP system at <b>slaughter</b> <b>houses.</b> This system also provided the information of possible causes and executed the correction steps of common hazards so that could assist producers to promote the sanitation level of poultry <b>slaughter</b> <b>houses</b> and achieve the safety target of meat products. 本研究之目的，在建立家禽屠宰場之線上HACCP（危害分析與重要管制點）記錄與監控系統。經由網際網路連結至伺服器，家禽屠宰業者即可紀錄場內重要管制點之監測值。本系統以網頁之方式呈現，運用ASP.
