5|$|The Mayan {{language}} {{family is}} extremely well documented, and its internal genealogical classification <b>scheme</b> <b>is</b> widely accepted and established, {{except for some}} minor unresolved differences.|$|E
30|$|Numerical {{solutions}} for generalized Rosenau equation are considered and two energy conservative finite difference <b>schemes</b> <b>are</b> proposed. Existence of the {{solutions for}} the difference <b>scheme</b> has <b>been</b> shown. Stability, convergence, and priori error estimate of the <b>scheme</b> <b>are</b> proved using energy method. Numerical results demonstrate that two <b>schemes</b> <b>are</b> efficient and reliable.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we present {{new methods of}} {{constructing}} Non-Standard schemes. Two new logical ways for constructing the denominator functions for the discrete derivatives <b>were</b> introduced and <b>schemes</b> <b>were</b> constructed based on Non Local Approximation. The <b>schemes</b> <b>were</b> applied on sampled IVPs in ordinary differential equations to verify whether the <b>schemes</b> <b>are</b> computationally reliable. The results obtained show that the <b>schemes</b> <b>are</b> suitable for problems {{for which they were}} proposed. _________________________________________________________________________________________...|$|R

5|$|Carrow Road is {{approximately}} ten minutes walking distance from Norwich railway station, {{which is on}} the Great Eastern Main Line to Liverpool Street station via Ipswich. Although resident parking <b>scheme</b> <b>is</b> in force in the roads surrounding the stadium, a park-and-ride facility operates around the city centre enabling visitors to the ground to arrive by bus.|$|E
5|$|From Debian 5.0, the {{numbering}} scheme of point releases was changed, conforming to the GNU version numbering standard; {{the first point}} release of Debian 5.0 was 5.0.1 instead of 5.0r1. The {{numbering scheme}} was once again changed for the first Debian 7 update, which was version 7.1. The r <b>scheme</b> <b>is</b> no longer in use, but point release announcements include a note about not throwing away old CDs.|$|E
50|$|In 2014, another {{redundancy}} <b>scheme</b> <b>was</b> announced. The redundancy <b>scheme</b> <b>was</b> due to {{the sharing}} of functions with the Herald.|$|R
40|$|AbstractAn {{optimality}} condition which addresses “solution quality” {{is proposed}} for difference schemes approximating transport problems in 2 -D. It is {{shown that the}} optimal positive type <b>schemes</b> <b>are</b> particularly simple. These <b>schemes</b> <b>are</b> constructed, and one reasonable way to combine them with second-order <b>schemes</b> <b>is</b> exhibited...|$|R
50|$|Color <b>schemes</b> <b>are</b> often {{described}} in terms of logical combinations of colors on a color wheel. Different types of <b>schemes</b> <b>are</b> used.|$|R
5|$|Operation Stack is {{a traffic}} {{management}} {{system on the}} M20 through and near Ashford, which allows HGVs to queue for the Channel Tunnel and the Port of Dover when there is bad weather or industrial action. The <b>scheme</b> <b>is</b> controversial as it involves closing the entire eastbound motorway to through traffic. In 2013, Kent County Council sought funding to build a dedicated lorry park in Ashford.|$|E
5|$|Strensham {{was one of}} two test sites {{chosen by}} RoadChef for a new loyalty card scheme in 2005. The cards {{themselves}} used new technology to physically display the points total on the card. The loyalty <b>scheme</b> <b>is</b> no longer in use today.|$|E
5|$|There are on-site parking {{facilities}} for supporters (limited to 230 spaces) {{and the streets}} surrounding the ground allow parking only for residents with permits. The Car Parking resident parking <b>scheme</b> <b>is</b> operated by Liverpool City Council.|$|E
60|$|These <b>schemes</b> <b>are</b> true, {{and also}} these <b>schemes</b> <b>are</b> false! {{in the sense}} that new things, new phrasings, have to replace them.|$|R
50|$|On 6 July 2012, the National Ugly Mugs Pilot <b>Scheme</b> <b>was</b> launched. The <b>scheme</b> <b>was</b> {{a success}} and {{continued}} after the 12-month pilot period.|$|R
40|$|Three common finite {{difference}} <b>schemes</b> <b>are</b> used {{to examine}} the computation of one-dimensional nonlinear wave propagation. The <b>schemes</b> <b>are</b> studied for their responses to numerical parameters such as time step selection, boundary condition implementation, and discretization of governing equations. The performance of the <b>schemes</b> <b>is</b> compared and various numerical phenomena peculiar to each is discussed...|$|R
5|$|The cold opening {{features}} Michael {{trying to}} get {{various members of the}} office involved in a pyramid scheme, which is a non-sustainable business model that involves promising participants payment or services, primarily for enrolling other people into the scheme, rather than supplying any real investment or sale of products or services to the public. The <b>scheme</b> <b>is</b> generally considered one of various internet scams. Michael later reveals having also fallen for a Nigerian 419 scam.|$|E
5|$|The {{crossing}} {{had always}} been tolled, and from 1 April 2003 this became a charge, though since 2008 it has been free from 10 pm to 6 am. An automatic number plate recognition charging scheme (Dart Charge) began in November 2014. As a result, the charge {{can no longer be}} paid in cash and the old toll booths have been removed. A residents' <b>scheme</b> <b>is</b> available, offering further discounts for people living near the crossing.|$|E
5|$|The {{underground}} station was opened on 27 March 1907 by the Baker Street and Waterloo Railway {{under the name}} Great Central (following a change from its intended name Lisson Grove). The railway terminated here until the extension to Edgware Road opened on 15 June. The station was renamed Marylebone on 15 April 1917. The original name still appears in places on the platform wall tiling, although the tiling <b>scheme</b> <b>is</b> a replacement designed to reflect the original scheme.|$|E
40|$|If two <b>schemes</b> <b>are</b> {{isomorphic}}, {{then their}} $m$-jet <b>schemes</b> <b>are</b> isomorphic for all $m$. In this paper {{we consider the}} converse problem. We prove that if an isomorphism of the $m$-jet <b>schemes</b> <b>is</b> induced from a morphism of the base schemes, then the morphism of the base <b>schemes</b> <b>is</b> an isomorphism. But we also prove that just the existence of isomorphisms between $m$-jet schemes does not yield {{the existence of an}} isomorphism between the base schemes.

40|$|Staggered {{high-order}} compact (HOC) finite difference <b>schemes</b> <b>are</b> {{developed for}} modelling electromagnetic wave propagation in dispersive media. The main advantage of HOC <b>schemes</b> <b>is</b> their very low dispersion error, which is dominant in low-order methods. The high accuracy of HOC <b>schemes</b> <b>is</b> demonstrated by examples of wave propagation through first-order Debye and Lorentz media in one dimension...|$|R
50|$|The <b>scheme</b> <b>was</b> {{generally}} considered to be very successful. In 2002 the <b>scheme</b> <b>was</b> changed from a competition to an award to any applicant who met minimum criteria. This led to several regions exhausting their budget. In 2005 the <b>scheme</b> <b>was</b> shut down and replaced with the Grant for Research and Development which was again a regional competition.|$|R

Blakley's scheme can be tightened by adding restrictions on which planes are usable as shares. The resulting <b>scheme</b> <b>is</b> equivalent to Shamir's polynomial system.|$|E
