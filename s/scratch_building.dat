The overall cargo-compartment length was increased to 111 ft, and the improved fuselage and engines allowed for a maximum load of 52500 lb.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{explains}} {{our approach}} to building knowledgebased information agents. Instead of building an agent from <b>scratch,</b> we advocate <b>building</b> an agent by adding knowledge to a framework. Knowledge is classified into three categories- general knowledge, domain specific knowledge and site specific knowledge- which enables knowledge reuse and sharing. The paper details the agent architecture, the components of each category of knowledge and the main functions of the framework...|$|R

Keyboardist Diego Tejeida said he was inspired by the decade's heavy usage of synths, particularly by Vince DiCola's works.|$|R

50|$|MR is {{considered}} to be a general-interest hobby magazine, appealing to a wide range of hobbyists, rather than specializing in a particular scale, or facet of the hobby (such as prototype operations or <b>scratch</b> <b>building</b> and kitbashing). Model Railroader covers a variety of scales and modeling techniques for engines, rolling stock, right-of-way, structures, and scenery. It reviews products including ready-to-run models as well as kits, tools and supplies. The magazine presents blueprints and photographs of prototype equipment, as well as photographs of models and layouts.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Scratch</b> <b>building</b> is the {{creation}} of a model [...] "from scratch" [...] rather than a manufactured kit. True scratchbuilt models consist of parts made by hand and do not incorporate parts from other kits. These are rare. When parts from other kits are included, the art is technically called [...] "Kit Bashing." [...] Most pieces referred to as [...] "scratchbuilt" [...] are actually a combination of kit bashing and scratchbuilding. Thus, it has become common for either term to be used loosely to refer to these more common hybrid models.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{our work}} on rapid language adaptation of acoustic models based on multilingual cross-language bootstrapping and unsupervised training. We used Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems in English, French, German, and Spanish {{to build a}} Czech ASR system from <b>scratch.</b> System <b>building</b> was performed without using any transcribed audio data by applying three consecutive steps, i. e. cross-language transfer, unsupervised training based on the “multilingual A-stabil “ confidence score [1], and bootstrapping. Based on the confidence score we selected 72 % (16. 6 hours) of the available audio data with a transcription WER of less than 14. 5 %. The cross-language bootstrap achieves a word error rate of 23. 3 % on the Czech development set and 22. 4 % on the evaluation set. These results are very promising as the performance compares favorably to the Czech ASR system which was trained on 23 hours of manually transcribed data (21. 8 % on the development set and 21. 3 % on the evaluation set).

40|$|An {{increase}} in chronic diseases in Danish healthcare {{can be explained}} by the corresponding increase of population longevity. Health professionals will not be able to keep up with treating those diseases, due to the many existing and new cases of chronic diseases. This results in mistakes in treatment processes, compensations to patients due to medical negligence and duplication of work and effort. In order to address a solution for healthcare practitioners, a small sub-group of patients and diseases is chosen from all chronic diseases. Namely, children diagnosed with cancer. This research brings the methodology for child cancer treatment plan that produces an ontology to create a conceptual model and a database model. To construct the ontology, the “methontology ” method is used as a structured approach for the ontology process. The method guides the ontology developer from <b>scratch</b> to <b>building</b> a complete model. The ontology is developed in two phases. In the first phase, research from other countries and process models are reviewed and the generic model is built from this research. The generic model is adapted to the ontology for the Danish hospitals including the NOPHO-ALL 2008 protocol. To develop the ontology, a data dictionary is first proposed. Then, the relationships between concepts are identified and verified: the oriented graph, where nodes are concepts and oriented edges are dependence relationships...|$|R
5000|$|Team Challenge: The Gazebo: Jake and Nicole {{are given}} the job of leading the contestants through the task of {{building}} a prefabricated gazebo, along with making a picnic table from <b>scratch,</b> and <b>building</b> a barbecue out of an old oil drum. Jake assigns Fabian and Jesse to build the picnic table which, despite getting very little direction from Jake, they complete without any trouble. The barbecue is mostly handled by Steve, who also manages to finish it without any trouble, though considers Jake's leadership {{to be more than}} a little nitpicky. Nicole leads the remaining contestants in assembling the gazebo, and quickly gets very flustered and snappy, causing the build to progress slowly. Things speed up once the remaining contestants join them, despite Nicole continuing to maintain a negative attitude. However, after having already witnessed several safety violations (including Jesse and Fabian both needing to be reminded to wear eye protection, and Jake's unsafe use of the angle grinder), Rob drags everyone aside to reprimand them for failing to wear the safety gloves that they were specifically instructed to use. He warns them of dire consequences should he see any more safety violations, but minutes later Fabian is caught without his gloves on a critical part of the build. An infuriated Rob immediately shuts the build down and declares the project a failure; consequently, no team is named the best for this task, and no-one gets an advantage for the next challenge.|$|R
