40|$|We {{propose a}} novel {{associative}} approach for bilingual word lexicon extraction (BLE) from parallel corpora {{that relies on}} the paradigm of data reduction instead of data augmentation. The key insight of the approach is the effective usage <b>of</b> <b>sub-corpora</b> sampling and properties of low-frequency words in the task of lexicon induction, particularly in a setting where only limited parallel data are available. Word translation pairs are extracted from many smaller sub-corpora (sampled from the original corpus) according to several frequency-based criteria of similarity. We prove the validity of our data sampling approach, and show that this method outperforms IBM Model 1 and associative methods based on similarity scores and hypothesis testing in terms of precision and F-measure in the task of lexicon extraction. Additionally, we show that our sampling-based method can learn correct word translations from fewer data. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|We propose {{and assess}} the novel idea of using {{automatically}} induced constructions as a unit of analysis for corpus-based discourse analysis. Automated techniques are {{needed in order to}} elucidate important characteristics of corpora for social science research into topics, framing and argument structures. Compared with cur-rent techniques (keywords, n-grams, and collo-cations), constructions capture more linguistic patterning, including some grammatical phe-nomena. Recent advances in natural language processing mean that it is now feasible to auto-matically induce some constructions from large unannotated corpora. In order to assess how well constructions characterise the content of a corpus and how well they elucidate interesting aspects of different discourses, we analysed a corpus of climate change blogs. The utility of constructions for corpus-based discourse analy-sis was compared qualitatively with keywords, n-grams and collocations. We found that the unusually frequent constructions gave interest-ing and different insights into the content of the discourses and enabled better comparison <b>of</b> <b>sub-corpora.</b> ...|$|R

To this end an electronic corpus of 5 million running Zulu words — the University of Pretoria Zulu Corpus (PZC) — is queried. We indicate how PZC can be used to highlight previously under-emphasised and overlooked aspects of a seemingly well-documented language feature such as the class 17 locative prefix ku-. Analysing the output proffered by PZC — an organic corpus that has been organised chronologically, and that consists of a number <b>of</b> <b>sub-corpora</b> stratified according to genre — enables us to reach conclusions regarding not only the frequencies with which the variants ku-, kwi- and ko- of the class 17 locative prefix are used, but also regarding the possible changes in use that these prefixes have undergone with time.

40|$|Ambiguity complicates text processing. As for English texts {{there are}} a number of disambigua-tion methods based on {{application}} of the probability method, which gives high precision results. Regarding to the Russian texts the problem is not only in part-of-speech ambiguity specific for English texts, but also in morphological and lexical ambiguity. In view of the fact that it is difficult to create a mathematical model for Russian language with free order of words in a sentence, the disambiguation methods based on the rules have received a larger development. In order to define the results of support vectors method and hidden Markov’s model of a part-of-speech disambiguation and full disambiguation in Russian texts processing the experiment, which lies in the use <b>of</b> <b>sub-corpus</b> with the disambiguated national corpus of the Russian language, is set up.

40|$|Within the {{framework}} of Natural Spoken Dialogue systems, this paper describes a method for dynamically adapting a Language Model (LM) to the dialogue states detected. This LM combines a standard n-gram model with Stochastic Finite State Automata (SFSAs). During the training process, the sentence corpus used to train the LM is split into several hierarchical clusters in a 2 -step process which involves both explicit knowledge and statistical criteria. All the clusters are stored in a binary tree where the whole corpus {{is attached to the}} root node. Each level of the tree corresponds to a higher specialization <b>of</b> the <b>sub-corpora</b> attached to the nodes and each node corresponds to a different dialogue state. From the same sentence corpus, SFSAs are extracted in order to model longer contexts than the ones used in the standard n-gram model. A <b>set</b> <b>of</b> SF-SAs is attached to each node of the tree as well as a sub-LM which combines a bigram trained on the <b>sub-corpus</b> <b>of</b> the node and the SFSAs selected. A first decoding process calculates a word-graph as well as a first sentence hypothesis. This first hypothesis will be used to find the optimal node in the LM tree. Then, a rescoring process of the word graph using the LM attached to the node selected is performed. By adapting the LM to the dialogue state detected, we show a statistically significant gain in WER on a dialogue corpus collected by France Telecom R&D 1. 1...|$|R

The features focused on include temporal and locational deixis, visual and spatial imagery and the use of time and tense. Findings show that these discourse creation pro-cesses play a signiicant part in the multi-functional character of the presentations, in enacting evaluation, persuasion and the construal of corporate-professional roles and identities. They also reveal something about the nature of virtual professional, commu-nicative space, and the socially-situated creation of corporate-managerial discourse...|$|R

40|$|In our {{previous}} research, {{we have shown}} that prosody {{can be used to}} dramatically improve the performance of the automatic speech translation system VERBMOBIL [9]. The methods to classify prosodic events have been developed on the German <b>sub-corpus</b> <b>of</b> the VERBMOBIL speech database. In this paper we describe how the methods that we developed on the German sub-corpus can be applied to other languages. Preliminary experiments show that these methods are suited for English and Japanese, as well. Efficiency problems are addressed and a new <b>set</b> <b>of</b> features that eliminates most of these problems is presented. The new <b>set</b> <b>of</b> features facilitates a multi-lingual module for prosodic processing.

This multi-lingual module and the new feature set are evaluated w. r. t. computation time, memory requirement, and classification performance. Preliminary results show that the memory requirement can be reduced by at least 70 %, whereas the recognition accuracy does not decrease...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} unlimitedSeveral authorship attribution studies have speculated {{about the existence}} of a link between topic cues and author style features. This research presents a novel experimental protocol for measuring the impact of topic features on author attribution predictive models. We call our technique "novel topic crossvalidation," which consists of holding out a single topic in a test set and iterating over choices of held-out topic to compute an average performance score. Using the New York Times Annotated corpus, we perform a subset procedure to build a <b>sub-corpus</b> <b>of</b> 18, 862 documents, 15 authors, and 23 topics. With this sub-corpus, we perform a novel topic cross-validation.

Having a larger <b>set</b> <b>of</b> topics and authors should provide researchers with a greater opportunity to explore the variability of style cues represented in <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> authors, as well as the confounding influence of topic.
