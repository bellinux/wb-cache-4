5|$|American kestrels' {{response}} to environmental stress is measured as blood concentration of corticosterone (CORT,) a hormone {{produced by the}} hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis that releases stored energy for essential body functions. Extended periods of elevated blood CORT levels may direct metabolic energy away from growth and reproduction. Thus, high levels of traffic disturbance and human development surrounding American kestrel nests are found to increase <b>stress</b> <b>hormones</b> leading to reproductive failure. Among successful nests, however, nestlings do not typically experience a higher stress {{response to}} environmental human disturbance, suggesting that they can tolerate a considerable degree of human activity near the nest.|$|E

25|$|Chronic {{secretion}} of <b>stress</b> <b>hormones,</b> glucocorticoids (GCs) and catecholamines (CAs), as {{a result}} of disease, may reduce the effect of neurotransmitters, including serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine, or other receptors in the brain, thereby leading to the dysregulation of neurohormones. Under stimulation, norepinephrine is released from the sympathetic nerve terminals in organs, and the target immune cells express adrenoreceptors. Through stimulation of these receptors, locally released norepinephrine, or circulating catecholamines such as epinephrine, affect lymphocyte traffic, circulation, and proliferation, and modulate cytokine production and the functional activity of different lymphoid cells.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a number}} of {{metabolic}} and homeostatic changes which result from untreated pain, including an increased requirement for oxygen, accompanied by a reduction in the efficiency of gas exchange in the lungs. This combination can lead to inadequate oxygen supply, resulting in potential hypoxemia. In addition, a rise in stomach acidity accompanies the stress reaction precipitated by pain, and there is a risk of aspirating this into the lungs, further endangering lung integrity and tissue oxygenation. In cases of acute, persistent pain, the metabolism becomes predominantly catabolic, causing reduced efficiency of the immune system and a breakdown of proteins caused by the action of the <b>stress</b> <b>hormones.</b> In combination, healing of damaged or infected tissue may be impaired, and morbidity and mortality increased.|$|E
25|$|In general, {{hematocrit}} is {{the number}} of red blood cells (RBC) in circulation and is highly variable among fish species. Active fish, like the blue marlin, tend to have higher hematocrits, whereas less active fish, such as the starry flounder exhibit lower hematocrits. Hematocrit may be increased in response to both short-term (acute) or long-term (chronic) hypoxia exposure and results in an increase in the total amount of oxygen the blood can carry, also known as the oxygen carrying capacity of the blood. Acute changes in hematocrit are the result of circulating <b>stress</b> <b>hormones</b> (see - catecholamines) activating receptors on the spleen that cause the release of RBCs into circulation. During chronic hypoxia exposure, the mechanism used to increase hematocrit is independent of the spleen and results from hormonal stimulation of the kidney by erythropoetin (EPO). Increasing hematocrit in response to erythropoietin is observed after approximately one week and is therefore likely under genetic control of hypoxia inducible factor hypoxia inducible factor (HIF).|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The authors {{sought to}} {{determine}} how temporary insulin suppression might alter the catabolic effects of cortisol, glucagon, and epinephrine. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: The metabolic responses to injury include hypermetabolism, accelerated net skeletal muscle protein breakdown, glucose intolerance, and insulin resistance. These alterations are associated with increased <b>stress</b> <b>hormone</b> concentrations. Insulin elaboration is usually suppressed immediately after an injury but is abundant later during convalescence. An infusion of hydrocortisone, glucagon, and epinephrine increases both <b>stress</b> <b>hormone</b> concentrations and insulin levels. It induces many of the metabolic alterations seen in critically ill patients, {{but it does not}} affect net muscle breakdown. METHODS: Seven healthy adults received a <b>stress</b> <b>hormone</b> infusion for 3 days in two separate studies. During one study they, also received an infusion of the somatostatin analogue, octreotide (0. 005 micrograms/kg/min), to suppress insulin elaboration for the first 24 hours. During the other study (control), insulin was permitted to rise unchecked. RESULTS: <b>Stress</b> <b>hormone</b> concentrations, hypermetabolism (+/- 20 % above basal), and leukocytosis were similar during both study periods. When insulin elaboration was temporarily suppressed, whole-body nitrogen loss was increased during the first 48 hours, and the efflux of amino acids from the forearm after 72 hours of infusion was 60 % greater than the control level. CONCLUSIONS: Temporary insulin suppression during physiologic increases in <b>stress</b> <b>hormone</b> concentrations amplified whole-body nitrogen loss and {{led to the development of}} accelerated net skeletal muscle protein breakdown. Early hormonal changes after an injury may affect the development of later catabolic responses...|$|R
30|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to compare pain perception during and after surgery between abdominal hysterectomy (AH), laparoscopic hysterectomy (LH), and vaginal hysterectomy (VH). The secondary {{objective of this}} study is to investigate whether pain indicators during surgery predict pain perception and demand for analgesics postoperatively. Prospective observational analysis of intraoperative nociceptive state (by means of pulse transit time; PTT), heart rate, and <b>stress</b> <b>hormone</b> levels (adrenalin and noradrenalin) were correlated with postoperative pain scores and <b>stress</b> <b>hormone</b> levels and demand for postoperative analgesics such as morphine. Intraoperative PTT levels and perioperative and postoperative <b>stress</b> <b>hormone</b> levels did not differ significantly between AH, LH, and VH. During the first hours postoperatively, LH patients showed insignificant lower pain scores, compared to AH and VH. One day postoperatively, LH patients reported significantly lower pain scores. High intraoperative <b>stress</b> <b>hormone</b> levels predicted a significant higher demand for morphine postoperatively, accompanied with significant higher pain scores. No differences were found with respect to intraoperative pain indicators well as pain perception during the first hours after surgery between AH, LH, and VH. If VH is not applicable, LH proves to be advantageous over AH with respect to a faster decline in pain scores.|$|R

25|$|An older {{method of}} {{harvesting}} {{is to use}} a sweep net, which operates a bit like a purse seine net. The sweep net is a big net with weights along the bottom edge. It is stretched across the pen with the bottom edge extending {{to the bottom of the}} pen. Lines attached to the bottom corners are raised, herding some fish into the purse, where they are netted. Before killing, the fish are usually rendered unconscious in water saturated in carbon dioxide, although this practice is being phased out in some countries due to ethical and product quality concerns. More advanced systems use a percussive-stun harvest system that kills the fish instantly and humanely with a blow to the head from a pneumatic piston. They are then bled by cutting the gill arches and immediately immersing them in iced water. Harvesting and killing methods are designed to minimise scale loss, and avoid the fish releasing <b>stress</b> <b>hormones,</b> which negatively affect flesh quality.|$|E

40|$|We {{examined}} the relationship between <b>stress</b> <b>hormone</b> (cortisol) release and acquisition and consolidation of conditioned fear learning in healthy adults. Participants underwent acquisition of differential fear conditioning, and consolidation was assessed in a 24 -h delayed extinction test. The acquisition phase was immediately followed by an 11 -min psychosocial stress period (arithmetic test combined with a public speech). Salivary cortisol was sampled at various time points before and after acquisition and retention of fear conditioning. Results showed two effects of endogenous cortisol. Post-acquisition cortisol correlated with fear acquisition in male but not female participants. In addition, post-acquisition cortisol correlated with consolidation of fear but only in those participants with high cortisol levels. We conclude that in the short term, a robust and sexually dimorphic relationship exists between fear learning and <b>stress</b> <b>hormone</b> levels. For those participants whose fear learning is accompanied by high <b>stress</b> <b>hormone</b> levels, a long-term relationship exists between cortisol release and memory consolidation. These short-term and long-term effects may relate to the differential involvement of mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid receptor subtypes, respectively. The findings have implications for understanding the role of <b>stress,</b> sex, and <b>hormones</b> in different stages of fear learning and memory...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Isoflavones, {{the most}} {{abundant}} phytoestrogens in soy foods, are structurally similar to 17 beta-estradiol. Few {{studies have examined the}} nociception and <b>stress</b> <b>hormone</b> responses after consumption of soy isoflavones. Methods In this study, ovariectomized (OVX) female Long-Evans rats were fed either an isoflavone-rich diet (Phyto- 600) or an isoflavone-free diet (Phyto-free). We examined the effects of soy isoflavones on metabolism by measuring body weights, food/water intake, adipose tissue weights as well as serum leptin levels. Also, circulating isoflavone levels were quantified. During chemically induced estrous, nociceptive thresholds were recorded. Then, the animals were subjected to a stressor and <b>stress</b> <b>hormone</b> levels were quantified. Results Body weights were significantly lower in Phyto- 600 fed rats compared to Phyto-free values within one week and during long-term consumption of soy isoflavones. Correspondingly, Phyto- 600 fed animals displayed significantly less adipose deposition and lower serum leptin levels than Phyto-free values. However, rats on the Phyto- 600 diet displayed greater food/water intake compared to Phyto-free levels. No changes in thermal pain threshold or <b>stress</b> <b>hormone</b> levels (ACTH and corticosterone) were observed after activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) stress axis. Conclusion In summary, these data show that consumption of soy isoflavones 1) increases metabolism, demonstrated by significantly decreased body weights, adipose tissue deposition and leptin levels, but 2) does not alter nociception or <b>stress</b> <b>hormone</b> responses, as indexed by thermal pain threshold, serum corticosterone and ACTH levels in chemically-induced estrous OVX rats. </p...|$|R
2500|$|Studies {{have shown}} that {{learning}} and memory improve after consuming carbohydrates. There {{are two kinds of}} carbohydrates that you can consume, simple and complex. [...] Simple carbohydrates are often found in processed foods and release sugar into the bloodstream quickly after consumption. [...] Complex carbohydrates are digested more slowly and therefore cause sugar to be released into the bloodstream more slowly. [...] Good sources of complex carbohydrates are whole-grain breads, pasta, brown rice, oatmeal, and potatoes. [...] It is recommended that you consume more complex carbohydrates because consuming complex carbohydrates will cause the level of sugar in your bloodstream to be more stable which will cause less <b>stress</b> <b>hormones</b> to be released. [...] Consuming simple carbohydrates may cause the levels of sugar in your bloodstream to rise and fall which can cause mood swings.|$|E
2500|$|Glucocorticoids {{have also}} been shown to have a {{significant}} impact on vigilance (attention deficit disorder) and cognition (memory). This appears to follow the Yerkes-Dodson curve, as studies have shown circulating levels of glucocorticoids vs. memory performance follow an upside-down U pattern, much like the Yerkes-Dodson curve. For example, long-term potentiation (LTP; the process of forming long-term memories) is optimal when glucocorticoid levels are mildly elevated, whereas significant decreases of LTP are observed after adrenalectomy (low-GC state) or after exogenous glucocorticoid administration (high-GC state). Elevated levels of glucocorticoids enhance memory for emotionally arousing events, but lead more often than not to poor memory for material unrelated to the source of stress/emotional arousal. In contrast to the dose-dependent enhancing effects of glucocorticoids on memory consolidation, these <b>stress</b> <b>hormones</b> have been shown to inhibit the retrieval of already stored information. Long-term exposure to glucocorticoid medications, such as asthma and anti-inflammatory medication, has been shown to create deficits in memory and attention both during and, to a lesser extent, after treatment, a condition known as [...] "steroid dementia." ...|$|E

Sows in crates bite the bars, chew even when they have no food, and press their water bottles obsessively, all reportedly signs of boredom. The Post(uncited reference) writes that a report by veterinarians for the European Union concluded that abnormal behavior in sows [...] "develop when the animal is severely or chronically frustrated.
