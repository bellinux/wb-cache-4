40|$|In {{the modern}} world, billions of {{physical}} sensors {{are used for}} various dedications: Environment Monitoring, Healthcare, Education, Defense, Manufacturing, <b>Smart</b> Home, <b>Agriculture</b> Precision and others. Nonetheless, they are frequently utilized by their own applications and thereby snubbing the significant possibilities of sharing the resources {{in order to ensure}} the availability and performance of physical sensors. This paper assumes that the immense power of the Cloud can only be fully exploited if it is impeccably integrated into our physical lives. The principal merit of this work is a novel architecture where users can share several types of physical sensors easily and consequently many new services can be provided via a virtualized structure that allows allocation of sensor resources to different users and applications under flexible usage scenarios within which users can easily collect, access, process, visualize, archive, share and search large amounts of sensor data from different applications. Moreover, an implementation has been achieved using Arduino-Atmega 328 as hardware platform and Eucalyptus/Open Stack with Orchestra-Juju for Private Sensor Cloud. Then this private Cloud has been connected to some famous public clouds such as Amazon EC 2, ThingSpeak, SensorCloud and Pachube. The testing was successful at 80 %.

40|$|Abstract — Security {{problems}} related to Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) has directly influenced the credibility of WSN applications and its services. With the advancement and demand in the WSN applications such as in military, structural health monitoring, transportation, <b>agriculture,</b> <b>smart</b> home and many more, the system stands {{to be exposed to}} too many potential threats. Currently, WSN systems has mainly relied on software based security for protection against breach of systems and data integrity. As WSN systems become more ubiquitous, software based security is regarded as no more sufficient for WSN applications. This paper discusses security issues in WSN area and reviews work done on hardware base security. Based on the preliminary works that have been carried out, Trusted Platform Module (TPM) initiatives by Trusted Computing Groups (TCG) together with Trusted Zone technologies by ARM are seen as possible approaches toward better security implementation in WSN. Finally, this paper proposes new embedded security implementation utilizing 32 -bit ARM 11 processor with trustzone features to enhance the integrity of the sensor node platform.

40|$|Employing over 70 % of Tanzanians, {{many of them}} {{small-scale}} farmers {{earning less}} than US$ 1 per day, the agriculture sector is particularly vulnerable to climate change. While climate change undermines agricultural development in low income countries like Tanzania, globally, agriculture contributes 14 % of the anthropogenic greenhouse gases (GHG). Agricultural practices like shifting cultivation; use of fire during farm preparation; use of synthetic fertilizers; forest clearance; higher tillage and livestock keeping are examples of agricultural techniques that are commonly practiced in Tanzania and that contribute to GHG emissions. The study was conducted from December 2012 to March 2013 in 8 villages of Chamwino and Kilosa Districts as well as amongst district and national-level stakeholders. The study {{was a part of}} implementation of the Climate Change, Agriculture and Poverty Alleviation (CCAP) project, a partnership initiative between Action Aid Tanzania, MJUMITA, MVIWATA, TFCG and TOAM. It aimed to document understanding of climate change and climate-smart small scale (C 3 S) agriculture, assess the current uptake of C 3 S agricultural practices and support of the government in adoption of C 3 S agriculture. The study used structured and semi structured interviews; key informant interviews; direct observations and reviewing of reports and grey literatures. The study found that: the level of understanding on climate <b>smart,</b> small-scale <b>agriculture</b> is low amongst most stakeholders; and few farmers in the study villages have adopted C 3 S agricultural techniques. Support by the district authority for C 3 S agriculture is also low in the study villages. Instead the district targets ‘modernising’ projects that benefit a few villages each year. The survey also found that the National Climate Change Steering Committee does not see that it is its role to promote policy harmonization in relation to C 3 S agricultureProceedings of the International Conference on Reducing Climate Change Challenges through Forestry and Other Land Use Practices, 2014 Climate Change Impacts, Adaptation and Mitigation (CCIAM) Programme funded through the Norwegian embassy in Tanzani...|$|R

Due to their vast range of applications efficient design and implementation become the current area of research. A distributed network consists of certain number of processing elements called nodes. These nodes are distributed over a geographical area which collects the information for particular phenomena and communicates with other nodes of the network to arrive at estimation the parameter. A network needs effective and efficient designs to function properly with the limited available resources. In this thesis,we review some of the computationally efficient adaptive distributed strategies developed using incremental partial update techniques. The schemes mentioned here {{solve the problem of}} linear estimation with less number of computations in a cooperative fashion. In a distributed network each node contains local computing equipment which estimates and shares them with other nodes. The resulting algorithms are less complex in competitions and in communication because of Incremental partial update algorithms and each node communicate with immediate node only. Computational complexity analysis is evaluated and performance characteristics of each algorithm are given with computer simulations. Simulation results show that with a small degradation in performance, a considerable amount of computational complexity is reduced. ...|$|R

This technique additionally reduces {{the amount of energy}} required in terms of fuel. Although research activities have increased in this field, high camera prices reflect low adaptation to applications in all fields of <b>agriculture.</b> <b>Smart,</b> low-cost cameras adapted for agricultural applications can overcome this drawback. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) for each image pixel is an applicable algorithm to discriminate plant information from the soil background enabled by a large difference in the reflectance between the near infrared (NIR) and the red channel optical frequency band. Two aligned charge coupled device (CCD) chips for the red and NIR channel are typically used, but they are expensive because of the precise optical alignment required. Therefore, much attention has been given to the development of alternative camera designs. In this study, the advantage of a smart one-chip camera design with NDVI image performance is demonstrated in terms of low cost and simplified design. The required assembly and pixel modifications are described, and new algorithms for establishing an enhanced NDVI image quality for data processing are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Agroforestry is {{considered}} nowadays as a sustainable form {{of land management}} that is being promoted by different global institutions like FAO and its Global Alliance <b>Smart</b> Climate <b>Agriculture</b> to mitigate and adaptate to Climate change. The European Commission through the protection of landscape features, greening and Rural Development Programs is promoting the essential presence of woody vegetation across Europe, {{but in a way}} that is difficult to recognize by farmers. AGROFE and AGFORWARD projects are both demonstrating the important value of Agroforestry at European level, which together with EURAF are pushing European Commission to include measures enhancing Agroforestry. However, there is a need of a European Agroforestry Strategy that recognizes the drawbacks of Agroforestry to be implemented at European level. This strategy should include the main mechanisms to show farmers how to implement it and at the same time to get funded for the important ecosystem services that they provide when implementing agroforestry. AGFORWARD project has identified the main agroforestry practices in Europe, highlighting silvopasture, but showing the importance that others forms of agroforestry have to play like homegardens with multipurpose trees, or the adequate improvement of fallow lands where woody vegetation can enhance the levels of organic matter in the soil if adequately managed. AGFORWARD also shows the lack of information of the real implementation of agroforestry practices like forest farming, in spite of the important productive and ecosystem benefits it provides. EURAF through the participation in the different civil dialogue groups (CAP, Direct Payments and Greening, Forestry and Cork, Organic Farming, Arable, Environment and Climate Change and Rural Development) has included and promoted agroforestry within the European Agenda. The role of Agroforestry has been also enhanced in the Groups of experts of European Structural and Investments funds and as part of the European Network for Rural Development and its derived groups: innovation, evaluation and CLLD/LEADER. EURAF is pleased to announce that Agroforestry will be discussed as part of a focus group of the European Innovation Partnership, so, apply and join the group. This book represents the lastest findings on agroforestry in Europe, integrating the participation of researchers but also policy makers and farmers and farmers' associations.

The province shares the common features of the North-western Vietnam: terrain is complicated and are strongly fragmented by mountain and stream systems; climate is tropical and with different climatic sub- regions. Over 70 % of the population (over 70 %) are agricultural. Yen Binh district locates {{in the south of}} Yen Bai province, with the total area of 77, 262 ha, and is diverse and rich in natural resources. Having diverse agricultural production activities (including crop, livestock, aquaculture and forestry) and sharing the common features with the province, Ma village has been facing important challenges caused by natural resource degradation, environmental pollution and climate variability.

40|$|The {{diffusion}} of ultra-broadband (in terms of high bandwidth and low latency) connection, IT hardware advances, and growing availability of open-source software are causing {{a paradigm shift}} {{in the world of}} network architectures. In the last years, the number of devices and smart-objects connected to the network has grown exponentially and the so-called "machine intelligence'' {{has become part of the}} life-cycle of industries, <b>agriculture,</b> <b>smart</b> cities, and eventually public institutions. In this context, the initiative to integrate heterogeneous networks, including wired/wireless networks and smart-objects, from both the service management and control viewpoints is considered a critical aspect of Future Networks. The effect of all these drivers is the so-called "Softwarization" of telco infrastructures, where the approach to this integration is through the deployment of a flexible and programmable network infrastructure supporting software-driven network features that can be instantiated on-demand. These instantiations will be addressing the changing service requirements and resource constraints, yet be scalable across multiple services and multiple domains, can maintain QoS for end-users of a service, and that provide a level of isolation and security from one service to another. Research and development activities are currently clearly focused on several concepts such as programmable networks, network virtualisation, open interfaces and platforms, and increasing the degree of intelligence inside the network. The next generation of Software Defined Infrastructures needs to move from being merely Defined by software to be Driven by software and must be capable of supporting a multitude of players that exploit an environment in which services are dynamically deployed and quickly adapt over a heterogeneous physical infrastructure, according to chaining requirements. One of the main challenges includes the design and the implementation of specific mechanisms for run-time orchestration of logical resources in wired environments. In addition to mechanisms for controlling virtual resources in Software Defined Infrastructures, another challenge includes the design and implementation of specific algorithms for the efficient mapping of virtual resources onto physical resources. This thesis shows how network architectures based on open network features and resources abstraction offers innovative solutions addressing some of the challenges of Future Networks...|$|R
40|$|The current {{education}} system in Malaysia {{has been of}} great concern to the society. The conventional methods of education currently being used do not allow students {{to be actively involved}} in the whole learning process. Many researches were conducted to find the best ways to enhance the quality of education and mostly with the help of technology. This study implemented science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) as an integrated smart learning program for primary school students in Malaysia. A set of developed technologies were introduced to cope with the primary school syllabus. It consisted the heart diagnostic, modern <b>agriculture,</b> <b>smart</b> bicycle, monopoly game, speech technology and crocodile clip. In heart diagnostic, student learned how to capture the electrocardiography (ECG) signals, read the ECG graph, calculate the width of the graph and use mathematics to understand the characteristic of the ECG signals. In another technology that we have developed is named modern agriculture. Heat and water level sensors were used to measure the temperature and the water that is needed for healthy growth of plants. In the science subjects, they know that plants require light in order to secure and they are capable to quantify the amount of light in relationship to the temperature. Using the above concepts, several other technologies which we called smart bicycle, speech technology and crocodile clip software were used as a tools to assist learning for these primary school children. This project was implemented at Sekolah Kebangsaan Taman Universiti 1, Johor Bahru, Malaysia. Eight teen students were selected to participate in the trial. Since the current evaluation system is based on exam oriented learning in order to evaluate the performance of the student. This created stress for teachers and students as the passing percentage of the school reflects the current status of the school as being a top notch or below average standing. In order to address this issue, we developed a monopoly like game based system, where students are actually being evaluated by playing this game. In the game the student has to answer sets of questions as they program in order to win the game.
