500|$|Welling {{was cast}} in the WB superhero drama Smallville after a {{nationwide}} search for an actor to play Clark Kent. In {{an interview with a}} teen magazine, Welling spoke about the day he auditioned for the role: [...] "I was on my way back from the Warner Bros. studio, and I stopped in a gas station to call my manager and tell him how it went. I called and got him on the phone and he said, 'Can you hold on a second?' Next thing I know, there are literally seven people on the other line and almost in unison they say, 'Tom, you got it!'" [...] The pilot aired in October 2001 and became the highest rated debut for The WB, with 8.4 million viewers. Welling told TV Guide that he turned down the lead role twice, but after reading the script, decided to take the job. Like Christopher Reeve, he was not a Superman fan prior to being cast as Clark Kent. In fact, he said, he continues to not read Superman comics: [...] "I made a conscious decision to <b>stay</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>that</b> material. We're doing something different at a time before all that, I don't want that to affect what I'm doing, even subconsciously." [...] He did get the chance to meet two previous Superman actors: Christopher Reeve, who appeared in season 2: episode 17 titled [...] "Rosetta", and Dean Cain, who appeared in season 7: episode 4 titled [...] "Cure".|$|E

He deems it [...] "insufficient and slow" [...] for immediate and spontaneous creation and all his efforts [...] "are to <b>stay</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>that</b> beast". He considers that the contemporary civilization is living in a cultural [...] "dark age" [...] of [...] "musical pollution". He considers musical composing a science rather than an art, similar to Pythagoreanism. He has a mystical viewpoint on music as [...] "one of the greatest forces in the universe", that the [...] "music exists before we exist". Some consider that his experience of music {{is a kind of}} synaesthesia.|$|E
2500|$|Anger {{has always}} been an [...] "extremely private individual," [...] {{although}} he has given various interviews over the years, with one interviewer, David Wingrove, describing him in 2008 as [...] "a joy. Gentle, soft-spoken, immaculately tanned, he looks a good two decades younger than his 78 years". In such interviews, he refuses to disclose information on his name change from Anglemeyer to Anger, telling an interviewer who brought the topic up in 2004 that [...] "You're being impertinent. It says Anger on my passport, that's all you need to know. I would <b>stay</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>that</b> subject if I were you." [...] In a 2010 interview, however, he stated that [...] "I just condensed my name. I knew it would be like a label, a logo. It's easy to remember." [...] Anger is openly gay, with one of his friends describing how he [...] "was attracted to people who were either well endowed or the Arnold Schwarzenegger type." [...] He once joked that he was [...] "somewhat {{to the right of the}} KKK" [...] in his views about black people, opening him up to criticism for racism. He is a passionate supporter of the Tibetan independence movement.|$|E

2500|$|When {{asked why}} the game {{would not be a}} simulation, Dickson replied, [...] "Well, we wanted to <b>stay</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>that</b> because the games that are out there that do that do it well." [...] Developer Piranha Games wanted to ensure that players spent most of their time on the track, so aside from visual modifications, the ability to {{customize}} cars is limited. [...] "We don't want you to spend lots of time outside the game, we want you on the race track," [...] stated Dickson. The AI drivers in the game were designed to adapt to the player's typical racing style. [...] "If you're kind of an aggressive driver, they're gonna drive aggressive against you," [...] Dickson remarked. The game was released exclusively in North American regions for the PlayStation 3 on February 22, 2011, and for the Xbox 360 on February 25, 2011. A retail version of the PlayStation 3 version was bundled with the Blu-ray of the namesake movie, released on June 7, 2011. A portable version developed by Freeverse was initially released for iOS on February 5, 2009 [...] It was later ported to the PlayStation Portable on June 1, 2011. Mac OS X and Microsoft Windows versions were planned, but eventually cancelled.|$|E
2500|$|Tyler {{stated that}} his usual {{approach}} to taking over a franchise from another composer is to [...] "try {{to take from}} what's before me and also forge ahead". So, though Tyler [...] "was really married to" [...] the idea of reprising Silvestri's Avengers theme from the first film in the sequel and wanted to keep in-line with [...] "the language of what Alan had done in The Avengers", he instead began by composing a [...] "classic, epic" [...] suite of his own for the film. Titled [...] "Rise Together", Tyler said that it [...] "is much more about pageantry and a march, and there's a slight militaristic aspect. I tend to <b>stay</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>that,</b> but I felt that that, combined with a choir, would make them feel larger than life. And certainly, this is when they're 'rising together,' {{so you need to}} have that unifying heroic theme with them." [...] Elfman then took Silvestri's theme and [...] "pulled it into" [...] the new material for the sequel to make a [...] "kind of a hybrid" [...] theme for the film. Tyler also looked to reference his own Iron Man and Thor themes in the score, as well as previous Captain America material, [...] "in order to create a similar musical universe", especially since those character's post-Avengers solo films [...] "set up" [...] Age of Ultron.|$|E

For example, patients {{who need to}} avoid acid reflux, such as those recovering from esophageal surgery for achalasia, are also instructed to <b>stay</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> foods <b>that</b> can aggravate reflux, which include ketchup and other tomato products, citrus fruits, chocolate, mint, spicy foods, alcohol, and caffeine. Foods such as tomatoes and blackberries may be restricted because they contain small seeds.|$|R
50|$|Chris' first {{interaction}} with aerosols was in 1993, {{when he would}} tag many walls of Lima, Peru, where he would publicize {{the name of the}} street gang he belonged to (Sepulcro Crema). Chris younger brother Patrick (aka Peru 143) later started doing graffiti, so Chris <b>stayed</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>that</b> medium for many years, as to avoid brotherly competition. It was later in 2007, when the brothers became roommates in Montreal, that they started to jam in their backyard and Chris got addicted to that medium. These days, spray paint is one of Chris' main mediums, especially in the outdoor seasons and while on the road. His intentions are to beautify the world and leave his trace as he explores the globe. You can find many of Chris's bright colorful murals all over the planet. Though Chris' favorite jams are organically organized block parties, he has also been invited to paint murals for well respected festivals like MURAL Festival and Art Basel Miami.|$|R

60|$|Now when Blacky the Crow {{discovered}} that the eggs in the old tumble-down nest of Redtail the Hawk in a lonesome corner of the Green Forest belonged to Hooty the Owl, he straightway made the best of resolutions; he would simply forget all about those eggs. He would forget that he ever had seen them, and he would <b>stay</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>that</b> corner of the Green Forest. That was a very wise resolution. Of {{all the people who}} live in the Green Forest, none is fiercer or more savage than Hooty the Owl, unless it is Mrs. Hooty. She is bigger than Hooty and certainly quite as much to be feared by the little people.|$|E

They persuaded {{a lot of men}} to <b>stay</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>that</b> infernal dinner, and consequently it was spread about the town that I was ruined. The effect upon shares which I held was instantaneous and tremendous. The Mexican railway were at 117, and they fell from that in two days to something quite nominal,--so that selling was out of the question. Cohenlupe and I between us had about 8,000 of these shares. Think what that comes to!' Nidderdale tried to calculate what it did come to, but failed altogether. 'That's what I call a blow;--a terrible blow. When a man is concerned as I am with money interests, and concerned largely with them all, he is of course exchanging one property for another every day of his life,--according as the markets go. I don't keep such a sum as that in one concern as an investment. Nobody does. Then when a panic comes, don't you see how it hits?' ...|$|E
