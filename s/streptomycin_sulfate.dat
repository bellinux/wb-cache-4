To initiate the purification of DNA Polymerase, the scientists added <b>Streptomycin</b> <b>sulfate</b> to the E. coli extract which created a precipitate that consisted of nucleic acid-free supernatant (S-fraction) and nucleic acid-containing precipitate (P-fraction). It was discovered that the P-fraction contained Pol I and heat-stable factors that were essential for the DNA synthesis reactions to undergo extreme temperatures. These factors were identified as nucleoside triphosphates, {{the building blocks of}} nucleic acids. The S-fraction contained multiple deoxynucleoside kinases.

Early detection of contaminants saves time, effort, and money. Strawberry runner explants were screened for contaminants during June to August, 1994 and 1995. Most contaminants found were bacterial rather than fungal. Bacterial contaminants from 22 contaminated genotypes were isolated, purified, and identified to genus using standard biochemical tests such as Gram's stain, King's B medium, starch hydrolysis, and carbon source utilization (Biolog). From those 22 genotypes, 16 different bacterial strains were isolated. The majority were Gram-negative, motile, rod-shaped fluorescent pseudomonads. Xanthomonads, enterobacterium, and other unidentified Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria were also found. Minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) of single (Timentin, <b>streptomycin</b> <b>sulfate,</b> dihydrostreptomycin, and gentamicin) and combinations of two and three (Timentin, <b>streptomycin</b> <b>sulfate,</b> and gentamicin) were tested for inhibition of the bacterial isolates.

In the course of one year, 80 samples were taken at investigated farms from udder quarters of cows with clinical mastitis and 160 samples from udder quarters of cows with subclinical mastitis. The efficacy of three preparations, A, B, and C, was examined in the treatment of clinical and subclinical mastitis in cows. The investigations indicate that antibiotic preparation A (neomycin, polimixine B, oleandomycin and prednisolone) exhibited a greater efficacy in the treatment of clinical mastitis caused by Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus uberis and Micrococcus sp., but a smaller efficacy in the treatment of subclinical mastitis caused by Staphylococcus aureus. Preparation B (amoxicillin, clavulanic acid and prednisolone) exhibited a higher efficacy in the treatment of clinical mastitis caused by Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus uberis and Micrococcus, but a weaker effect in the treatment of subclinical mastitis caused by Staphylococcus aureus.

The enzyme was purified {{by a series of}} <b>streptomycin</b> and ammonium <b>sulfate</b> fractionations and by Sephadex and diethylaminoethyl column chromatography. The final preparation was purified 130 -fold, with a recovery of about 10 % of the initial enzyme activity. The enzyme had a wide pH range, with optimal activity at pH 6. 0 to 7. 0. The enzyme was stable in solution at pH 6. 5 to 7. 8 when kept at 30 C for 2 hr, but it was destroyed by temperatures above 55 C. At 58 and 60 C, the time required to inactivate 90 % of the initial activity was 16 and 6. 5 min, respectively. An activation energy of 9, 500 cal/mole and a Km of 1. 25 × 10 − 4 m were obtained by using p-nitrophenyl β-glucoside as a substrate. The Ki value and hydrolysis of cellobiose by the enzyme indicated a high affinity of the enzyme for the cellobiose. The enzyme had its specificity on β-glucosidic linkage and the rate of hydrolisis of glucosides depended upon the nature of the aglycon moiety. The inactivation studies showed the presence of sulfhydryl groups in the enzyme. The activity of the enzyme was easily destroyed by the Cu++ and Hg++ ions. The Michaelis-Menton relationship and the rate of heat inactivation indicated the presence of one type of noninteracting active site in the bacterial β-glucosidase. Molecular weight of the enzyme was estimated by gel filtration (Sephadex G- 200) and sucrose density gradient, and a value of 120, 000 to 160, 000 was obtained...|$|R

The most effective treatments involved dapsone plus <b>streptomycin</b> <b>sulfate</b> or sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim plus streptomycin. Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine plus streptomycin or rifampicin plus streptomycin also gave good results. Griseofulvin plus penicillin showed some promise {{in the management of}} maduromycetoma caused by Madurella mycetomi but at the present time this should be used only as an adjunct to surgery. All mycetoma patients undergoing drug therapy should be carefully monitored and treatment should be temporarily suspended if anaemia or leucopenia develop...|$|E
40|$|A {{quantitative}} {{technique has}} been developed to assay cotton soils for populations of Thielaviopsis basicola, a soil occurring fungus that causes the seedling disease of cotton known as Black Root Rot. The procedure utilizes a soil dilution technique with a carrot extract agar containing etridiazol, Mystatin, <b>streptomycin</b> <b>sulfate,</b> chlortetracycline, calcium carbonate and PCNB. Populations of the fungus have been monitored from April to December, 1986 in a heavily infested Pima S- 6 field in cooperation with Bob Cockrill, a Coolidge grower. When field soils containing approximately 600 propagules of the fungus per gram of air dry soil were planted to Pima S- 6 in the laboratory, 75 - 100 % and 50 - 75 % cortical decay occurred at 20 and 28 C, respectively. This seedling damage was related to subsequent reduced seedling vigor...|$|E
