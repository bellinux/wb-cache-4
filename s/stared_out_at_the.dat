Of this show, Gerard McCarthy, writing in Art in America, said: “Each subject <b>stares</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> viewer {{in a way that}} conveys the moment of encountering a weighty persona with the freshness and ephemerality of a glance, but the result is elaborately worked and structurally complex.” ...|$|R
5|$|Portrait of a Young Girl {{is a small}} oil-on-oak panel {{painting}} by the Early Netherlandish painter Petrus Christus. It was completed {{towards the end of}} his life, between 1465 and 1470, and is held in the Gemäldegalerie, Berlin. It marks a major stylistic advance in contemporary portraiture; the girl is set in an airy, three-dimensional, realistic setting, and <b>stares</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> viewer with a complicated expression that is reserved, yet intelligent and alert.|$|R

60|$|Winston rose, and she {{saw that}} one hand was closed as he looked down upon her.

50|$|A figure <b>stares</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> viewer {{from the}} scene of the taking of Christ. This scene is taken from Albrecht Dürer's Small Passion: Pilate Washing his Hands of 1512 where it is also used as a {{background}} motif and, in much the same way, implicates the viewer, through the staring soldier, in the foreground goings-on; there Pilate absolving himself, here Peter himself.A painting in the Shipley Art Gallery in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, England, attributed to Ter Brugghen, appropriates Dürer's composition directly and in reverse. This is again copied in another, nearly identical, painting by Ter Brugghen in the Lublin Museum, Poland.|$|R

60|$|She was late, {{for she had}} lingered with Polly, and {{she feared}} that patient watcher at the window would be gone. No; the brown head was there, but it lay wearily on the arms folded over a big book, and the eyes that <b>stared</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> wintry sky had {{something}} tragic in them.|$|E
60|$|So I grew {{silent and}} still <b>stared</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> sea. Indeed, I was {{wondering}} {{in my mind}} whether I dared ask leave to depart, for I felt her eyes burning on me, and grew much afraid. Suddenly I heard a sound, a gentle sound of rustling silk, and in another instant I felt Irene's arms clasped about me and Irene's head laid upon my knee. Yes, she was kneeling before me, sobbing, and her proud head was resting on my knee. The diadem she wore had fallen from it, and her tresses, breaking loose, flowed to the ground, and lay there gleaming like gold in the moonlight.|$|E
6000|$|He {{talked for}} a little while about house agents and solicitors and people of that sort, in the unjust, {{unreasonable}} way that so many people do somehow get to talk of these business calculi ("Of all the cranky things in this cranky world, it is the most cranky to my mind of all, that while we expect honour, courage, efficiency, from a doctor or a soldier as a matter of course, a solicitor or a house agent is not only permitted but expected to display nothing but a sort of greedy, greasy, obstructive, over-reaching imbecility--" [...] etc.)--and then, greatly relieved, he went to the window and <b>stared</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Sloane Street traffic.|$|E
50|$|The image's {{subject is}} Chase's 11-year-old daughter, Dorothy, {{wearing a white}} dress with {{full-length}} sleeves, a straw hat with a green bow, a black belt, black tights, and black shoes. She is standing against a brown background without any detail, so the viewer's eye is focused only on her. Dorothy <b>stares</b> straight <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> viewer, engaging them. With a 6' canvas, Dorothy is reminiscent of full-length Baroque paintings of emperors, giving the young girl a grandiose image.|$|R
50|$|They {{then call}} Peter, who is {{staying at a}} hotel with his father, and tell him. He attends the funeral and {{afterwards}} finds Jack in his study, weeping to himself. Jack is ridden with guilt, he says {{that it was his}} idea to come up there and he blames himself for the death of Charlie and now Max. He breaks down saying that he has nothing left, but Peter then tells him that has so much left and that he had not yet reached the event horizon (a concept of physics that Jack describes to Peter as the point of no return). The ending is left up to the viewer for interpretation. It shows Peter and his father having breakfast at a diner before leaving back for Los Angeles. A bus then pulls up outside as one of the passengers needs to use the bathroom. Peter then gets up - his father apparently assuming he is going to the bathroom - and heads outside and gets on the bus, which then leaves when the other passenger gets back. Peter <b>stares</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> landscape, not knowing where he's going and seemingly content with that.|$|R
40|$|George M. Sutton 2 ̆ 7 s baby bird portraits are {{his most}} {{captivating}} works. The subjects are isolated against a stark, raw-paper background, and they <b>stare</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> viewer with eyes typically naive but alert. Sutton 2 ̆ 7 s artistic {{mastery of the}} foot is integral to the underlying biology in these pictures: sturdy and sure against the table for a ruffed grouse, curled inward and near useless for a gallinule on dry land, and almost casually clutching a twig, the hallux resting loosely, for a newly fledged grosbeak. The match between these pictures and Paul Johnsgard 2 ̆ 7 s text is perfect. In his first two paragraphs, Johnsgard gives us a small taste {{of what it is}} like handling almost sacred materials (in this case the watercolors) in the hidden depths of a major museum 2 ̆ 7 s most secure rooms. And throughout the text, Johnsgard seems to respect the paintings as much as the birds themselves. Few other writers could bring such a breadth of literary and artistic experience to the task of making 2 ̆ 2 Doc 2 ̆ 2 Sutton 2 ̆ 7 s work available, in a very special way, to the general public...|$|R
60|$|The Angel {{lay upon}} {{the summit of}} the cliff above Bandram Bay, and <b>stared</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{glittering}} sea. Sheer from under his elbows fell the cliff, five hundred and seven feet of it down to the datum line, and the sea-birds eddied and soared below him. The upper part of the cliff was a greenish chalky rock, the lower two-thirds a warm red, marbled with gypsum bands, and from half-a-dozen places spurted jets of water, to fall in long cascades down its face. The swell frothed white on the flinty beach, and the water beyond where the shadows of an outstanding rock lay, was green and purple in a thousand tints and marked with streaks and flakes of foam. The air was full of sunlight and the tinkling of the little waterfalls and the slow soughing of the seas below. Now and then a butterfly flickered over the face of the cliff, and a multitude of sea birds perched and flew hither and thither.|$|E
6000|$|She put {{her face}} close to his. Her eyes troubled him, but he drew back. He {{thought she would}} be {{offended}} or persistent, but she was neither; {{just looked at him}} fixedly with a curious inquiring stare; and he leaned against the window, deeply disturbed. It was as if all clear and simple enthusiasm had been suddenly knocked endways; as if a certain splendour of life that he had felt and seen of late had been dipped in cloud. Out there at the front, over here in hospital, life had been seeming so--as it were--heroic; and yet it held such mean and murky depths as well! The voices of his men, whom he had come to love like brothers, crude burring voices, cheery in trouble, making nothing of it; the voices of doctors and nurses, patient, quiet, reassuring voices; even his own voice, infected by it all, kept sounding in his ears. All wonderful somehow, and simple; and nothing mean about it anywhere! And now so suddenly to have lighted upon this, and all that was behind it--this scared girl, this base, dark, thoughtless use of her! And the thought came to him: [...] "I suppose my fellows wouldn't think twice about taking her on! Why! I'm not even certain of myself, if she insists!" [...] And he turned his face, and <b>stared</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> moonlight. He heard her voice: ...|$|E
5000|$|Other details {{emerge in}} later accounts. In one, Emmett claimed that [...] "Suddenly, ... I {{jumped up and}} {{sat down at the table}} to work. In less than an hour I had the first verse and chorus. After that it was easy." [...] In another version, Emmett <b>stared</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> rainy evening and thought, [...] "I wish I was in Dixie." [...] Then, [...] "Like a flash the thought {{suggested}} the first line of the walk-around, and a little later the minstrel, fiddle in hand, was working out the melody" [...] (a different story has it that Emmett's wife uttered the famous line). Yet another variant, dated to 1903, further changes the details: [...] "I was standing by the window, gazing out at the drizzly, raw day, and the old circus feeling came over me. I hummed the old refrain, 'I wish I was in Dixie,' and the inspiration struck me. I took my pen and in ten minutes had written the first verses with music. The remaining verses were easy." [...] In his final years, Emmett even claimed to have written the song years before he had moved to New York. A Washington Post article supports this, giving a composition date of 1843.|$|E
60|$|The day wore on, and I did {{not disturb}} the sleeper. A dozen times, I suppose, I had to relight my fire of wet peats and roots; but I {{had plenty of}} time to <b>stare</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> window, plenty of time to think. Probably Gavin's life {{depended}} on his sleeping, but that was not what kept my hands off him. Knowing so little of what had happened in Thrums since I left it, I was forced to guess, and my conclusion was that the earl had gone off with his own, and that Gavin in a frenzy had followed them. My wisest course, I thought, was to let him sleep until I heard the cannon, when his struggle for a wife must end. Fifty times at least did I stand regarding him as he slept; and if I did not pity his plight sufficiently, you know the reason. What were Margaret's sufferings at this moment? Was she wringing her hands for her son lost in the flood, her son in disgrace with the congregation? By one o'clock no cannon had sounded, and my suspense had become intolerable. I shook Gavin awake, and even as I shook him demanded a knowledge of all that had happened since we parted at Nanny's gate.|$|R
60|$|Yet surely, and {{especially}} to another scientific man, there was nothing so horrible in vivisection as to account for this secrecy; and by some odd leap in my thoughts the pointed ears and luminous eyes of Montgomery's attendant came back again before me with the sharpest definition. I <b>stared</b> before me <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> green sea, frothing under a freshening breeze, and let these and other strange memories {{of the last few}} days chase one another through my mind.|$|R
50|$|All {{his work}} is {{designed}} to illustrated non-existent, shadowy social groups, engaged in ambiguous activity. They {{appear to be a}} group of Europeans who have gone feral in a tropical jungle. Covered wholly or partially in mud, they <b>stare</b> dully <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> camera through elaborate necklaces and garlands of brightly coloured, sensuous flowers. Phallic and vulval forms dominate the arrangements (pitcher plants and orchids). The figures are passive and unthreatening, but also generate frissons of evil and madness and exert a horrid fascination. Mud was the medium of Orjis' graduation show in 2006, My Empire of Dirt. Using mud and water, he did a fey series of works on paper depicting semi-clad figures singly and in groups. Some scenes were set in woodland, and the heads of some figures seemed to have morphed into grotesque wood galls while others wore helmets.|$|R
40|$|Environmental Writing and Great Lakes LiteratureLater that day, Mark {{led us to}} {{his house}} {{in the small town}} of Pinos Altos. While dinner cooked, we sat outside and <b>stared</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same forest we had been {{overlooking}} just a few hours earlier. Now we could hear the birds singing and the bees buzzing. The pine trees loomed over our heads, and mountains rose up in the distance out of the darkening blue sky. I rocked back and forth in my chair and let my thoughts wander. For the past two years I had been stuck inside myself. I wasn’t happy. I had become dull and inert, and because of that, I had lost my creativity and passion for learning. Reflecting on the trip though, I came to realize that there is so much to be inspired by in nature. I saw the vastness of the forest, which contained animals of all habits and sizes. I saw the sun melt into the sky, blending its colors flawlessly. I felt the rhythm of the pouring rain and heard the beat of the thunder. I realized that I had a choice; I could isolate myself from nature’s marvels, and continue on in the lull that I was in, or I could immerse myself in them, finding joy and wonder in each new discovery...|$|E

Then a foot tapped the floor; one shoulder lifted; he wheeled, and began the short quick double-shuffle--the war-dance of Stalky in meditation. Thrice he crossed the empty form-room, with compressed lips and expanded nostrils, swaying to the quick-step. Then he halted before the dumb Beetle and softly knuckled his bead, Beetle bowing to the strokes. McTurk nursed one knee and rocked to and fro.

Images appearing in the published version of this article have been removed. Performance Research is available online <b>at.</b> During <b>the</b> extended prologue of the Berliner Ensemble’s 1995 production of Bertolt Brecht’s The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui, directed by Heiner Muller, actor Martin Wuttke’s Arturo Ui moves around the stage like a salivating dog. Bare-chested and in military breeches, with white gloves making paws of his hands, and with his tongue stained red and hanging out, Wuttke’s body, is part pointer-dog, part-wolf, panting, impatient and on guard. The following year Müller's final work, Germania 3 Ghosts at Dead Man, is staged <b>at</b> <b>the</b> BE and directed by Wuttke. In the first scene, two male performers in top hats, black T-shirts, jackets with tails and bare feet, enter the stage. They could be clowns or Shakespearian grave diggers. They <b>stare</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> auditorium and deliver the play's opening line – 'The mausoleum of German Socialism. Here is where it's been buried'. This article explores the performative representations of post-reunification German theatre through an analysis of the textual, visual and aural image-making of these two Berliner Ensemble productions. It suggests that the theatrical representation of historical and legendary twentieth century figures, that we find in these performances, such as Hitler and Stalin, old communist leaders and the mythical Erlkönig, form part of the re-mapping and re-configuring of culture that is taking place in contemporary Germany. This is especially so in regard to the inter-relations between the past and the changing political borders in the present that connect with the broader historical transitions affecting ‘east’ and ‘west’ Europe. These include the end of the Cold War, the eastwards expansion of the European Union and the movement into a globalised economy. This article contends that Müller's post-reunification theatrical offerings <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Berliner Ensemble, now separated from the state that funded it, are acutely and tellingly situated <b>at</b> <b>the</b> intersection of culture and politics.

40|$|DIFFERENT WAYS OF VIEWING A MONUMENT Wandering through Keystone {{an evening}} {{not long ago}} and looking above the trees, I could see Mt. Rushmore in the distance. Apparently the {{lighting}} ceremony had just ended, and as I looked at those faces of Washington, Jefferson, T. R., and Lincoln, I felt a tinge of excitement. But why? I had seen them many times before. In fact, I spent a summer working for <b>the</b> concessionaire <b>at</b> <b>the</b> monument, serving food in the old Buffalo Dining Room. Every day I stared at those faces as I asked people if they wanted fried chicken or beef and gravy. In recent years, I {{have lived in the}} vicinity of the mountain. By now that carving should be old news. But obviously, those faces say something to me, and until I read these books by John Taliaferro and Jesse Larner, I never considered exactly why Mt. Rushmore moves me or exactly what the monument means, or should mean, to the millions of people who visit it each year. Like the nearly three million others who gaze at Rushmore annually, Taliaferro and Larner made their own pilgrimages to the mountain, each shaping a personal narrative as part of his story. But looking <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same mountain, they come away with entirely different experiences. In general, Taliaferro liked what he saw, and his book praises not only the quality of the sculpture, but the meaning behind it. His history covers all aspects of Rushmore 2 ̆ 7 s past, from inspiration to consternation. On the other hand, Larner virtually ignores the monument itself, dwelling instead on the sins it seemingly hides. To him, Mt. Rushmore represents an American ideology of conquest, and he wants to debunk the myths he sees embodied in it. Recounting his visit, Taliaferro explains that the carving aroused 2 ̆ 7 in him such basic questions as who were these four men whose faces <b>stare</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> landscape, why were they chosen, and who was the person who carved the mountain? He builds his account around these questions. But this is not just a story about Mt. Rushmore, for Taliaferro realizes that any telling requires examining the life and times of its contentious sculptor, Gutzon Borglum. Indeed, Taliaferro has combined two books in one: a biography of Borglum, and the actual history of the project, in which, of course, Borglum plays a major role. Taliaferro hints at this dual function in his title: 2 ̆ 2 Great White Fathers 2 ̆ 2 naturally refers to the presidents; 2 ̆ 2 The Story of the Obsessive Quest to Create Mt. Rushmore 2 ̆ 2 most clearly points to Borglum. But there is overlap. Since Borglum saw himself as a 2 ̆ 2 great man 2 ̆ 2 and fully believed in the role of great men in history, he too can be seen as a 2 ̆ 2 Great White Father. 2 ̆...|$|R
