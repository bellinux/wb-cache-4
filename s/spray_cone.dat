40|$|A {{computational}} {{analysis of}} flow in simplex fuel atomizers using the arbitrary-Lagrangian–Eulerian method is presented. It {{is well established}} that the geometry of an atomizer {{plays an important role}} in governing its performance. We have investigated the effect on atomizer performance of four geometric parameters, namely, inlet slot angle, spin chamber convergence angle, trumpet angle, and trumpet length. For a constant mass flow rate through the atomizer, the atomizer performance is monitored in terms of dimensionless film thickness, <b>spray</b> <b>cone</b> half-angle, and discharge coefficient. Results indicate that increase in inlet slot angle results in lower film thickness and discharge coefficient and higher <b>spray</b> <b>cone</b> angle. The spin chamber converge angle has an opposite effect on performance parameters, with film thickness and discharge coefficient increasing and the <b>spray</b> <b>cone</b> angle decreasing with increasing convergence angle. For a fixed trumpet length, the trumpet angle has very little influence on discharge coefficient. However, the film thickness decreases, and <b>spray</b> <b>cone</b> angle increases with increasing trumpet angle. For a fixed trumpet angle, the discharge coefficient is insensitive to trumpet length. Both the <b>spray</b> <b>cone</b> angle and the film thickness are found to decrease with trumpet length. Analytical solutions are developed to determine the atomizer performance considering inviscid flow through the atomizer.

The {{objective of this}} study is to characterize palm olein/diesel blends spray in terms of spray angle and SMD under different injection pressures using a hollow cone pressure swirl atomizer. The physical properties of five diesel/palm olein blends, namely B 5, B 10, B 15, B 20 and B 25 were measured and their spray characteristics were tested at injection pressures of 0. 8 MPa, 1. 0 MPa, and 1. 2 MPa under ambient atmospheric condition. The results were compared to spray established using petroleum diesel fuel. The SMD was measured using a phase Doppler analyzer (PDA).

Periodic pressure oscillation across the injector changed the air core diameter as much as 15 % and the <b>spray</b> <b>cone</b> angle as much as 6 % downstream from the nozzle exit plane.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} some of {{the most}} important problems in modelling metal spray deposition processes: a spatial mass flux distribution within the <b>spraying</b> <b>cone</b> produced by the source, and a spraying efficiency in depositing material onto the substrate. The model is based on a continuous approach of the liquid metal spraying. The mass flux distribution function is derived from experimental observations and the mass preservation constraint. It depends on the source spray parameters and modelling functions. Upon impinging the substrate, liquid metal droplets disintegrate in a complex way. A fraction of the total mass arrived at remains in the point of impact, while the rest is splashed and re-deposited elsewhere. The ratio of the mass retained over the total mass arrived at is called the sticking efficiency. This parameter is found to be the solution of an inverse problem. The non-linear inverse problem is transformed into a boundary value problem, which is solved using methods for a curvilinear grid generation.

40|$|Droplet {{collision}} occurs {{frequently in}} regions where the droplet number density is high. Even for Lean Premixed and Pre-vaporized (LPP) liquid sprays, the collision {{effects can be}} very high on the droplet size distributions, which will in turn affect the droplet vaporization process. Hence, in conjunction with vaporization modeling, collision modeling for such spray systems is also essential. The standard O'Rourke's collision model, usually implemented in CFD codes, tends to generate unphysical numerical artifact when simulations are performed on Cartesian grid {{and the results are}} not grid independent. Thus, a new collision modeling approach based on no-time-counter method (NTC) proposed by Schmidt and Rutland is implemented to replace O'Rourke's collision algorithm to solve a spray injection problem in a cylindrical coflow premixer. The so called ``four-leaf clover'' numerical artifacts are eliminated by the new collision algorithm and results from a diesel spray show very good grid independence. Next, the dispersion and vaporization processes for liquid fuel sprays are simulated in a coflow premixer. Two liquid fuels under investigation are jet-A and Rapeseed Methyl Esters (RME). Results show very good grid independence in terms of SMD distribution, droplet number distribution and fuel vapor mass flow rate. A baseline test is first established with a <b>spray</b> <b>cone</b> angle of 90 degrees and injection velocity of 3 m/s and jet-A achieves much better vaporization performance than RME due to its higher vapor pressure. To improve the vaporization performance for both fuels, a series of simulations have been done at several different combinations of <b>spray</b> <b>cone</b> angle and injection velocity. At relatively low <b>spray</b> <b>cone</b> angle and injection velocity, the collision effect on the average droplet size and the vaporization performance are very high due to relatively high coalescence rate induced by droplet collisions. Thus, at higher <b>spray</b> <b>cone</b> angle and injection velocity, the results expectedly show improvement in fuel vaporization performance since smaller droplet has a higher vaporization rate. The vaporization performance and the level of homogeneity of fuel-air mixture can be significantly improved when the dispersion level is high, which can be achieved by increasing the <b>spray</b> <b>cone</b> angle and injection velocity.

Atomisation of liquid spray occurs through the internal atomizer that can produce many forms of spray patterns and two of these, hollow-cone and full-cone sprays, are evaluated in this study to determine which spray pattern produced greater deposition in the middle regions of the nasal cavity. Past studies of spray particle deposition have ignored the device within the nasal cavity. Using computational fluid dynamics (CFD), two computational models of human nasal cavity model were reconstructed from CT-scans, where {{the difference between the}} two models was the presence of the nasal spray device accounting for the airway blockage at one of the nostrils. Experimental measurements from Particle Droplet Image Analyser (PDIA) were taken in order to gain confidence in determining the initial particle conditions for the computational models. An airflow field is induced through a negative pressure flow condition applied at the pharynx instead of constant flow rates at the left and the right nasal cavities. Subsequent airflow patterns and its effects on particle deposition, with and without a spray device, are compared. Contours and streamlines of the flow field revealed that the presence of a spray device in the nasal vestibule produced higher levels of disturbed flow, which helped the dispersion of the sprayed particles.

Unconfined water sprays operated at lower water pressures of ? 689 kPa (? 100 psig) can be very effective at wetting the mine product at the dust source and significantly {{reducing the amount of}} respirable dust that becomes airborne. However, unconfined waters sprays can be somewhat ineffective in actually removing airborne dust from the air. On the other hand, water powered scrubbers operating at higher water pressures of ? 1, 724 kPa (? 250 psig) in physical enclosures or ducts have previously been demonstrated to be very effective in removing airborne dust from the air. These higher operating water pressures are uncommon in many mines and mills, so their use is limited. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) recently investigated the performance of a lower-pressure, water powered inline series spray scrubber for removing localized airborne dust emitted at the source. Results showed noticeable improvements in airborne dust capture efficiency through the operation o f multiple inline series hollow <b>cone</b> <b>spray</b> nozzles within a round duct or pipe at the same water pressure as a single <b>spray.</b> Operating hollow <b>cone</b> <b>spray(s)</b> at higher water pressures noticeably improved airflow through the scrubber and yielded some additional scrubber efficiency improvements. Thus, in-line spray scrubber efficiency trade-offs were observed to be made by altering spray power components of water pressure and/or quantity (number of sprays). Results show that, on average, up to 0. 23 and 0. 32 m 3 /s (484 and 679 cu ft per min) of airflow at 0. 81 and 0. 69 dust capture efficiencies can be achieved with three 8120 and 3320 hollow <b>cone</b> inline series <b>sprays,</b> respectively, operating at 1, 655 kPa (240 psig) ...|$|R
