40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the naturally occurring concentrations of metals in unimpacted wetland soils at the Savannah River Site located near Aiken, <b>SC.</b> <b>Soil</b> samples were collected from three broad categories of wetlands: (1) large stream floodplain wetlands, (2) small stream floodplain wetlands, and (3) upland bays and depressions. Samples were collected from 75 locations to a depth of 3. 1 m. All samples were analyzed for selected metals using EPA protocol and standard methods. Additionally, the pH, exchange capacity, and total organic carbon content of each sample was determined. Standard summary statistics were calculated and results are presented for each constituent. Box plots were also created relating metals concentrations to grain size distribution. Metals concentrations were found to increase with increasing silt and clay content. This increase in concentration was attributed to increasing cation exchange capacity and increasing organic matter content...|$|E

In the UK, grassland soils account for 30 % of total emissions, 22 % of which are estimated to come from urine and dung patches. These patches are possible sources of ‘hot-spots ’ (area ca. 1 m 2) of N 2 O fluxes. Spatial and temporal heterogeneity of N 2 O hot-spot fluxes were investigated in three grassland fields (grazed with dairy cows (DG), grazed with young stock (YG) or cut for silage (SC)) using gas sampling chambers surrounding historic hot-spots to establish their size. Fluxes from old dung and urine patches were measured, as well as freshly applied dung and urine to simulate the creation of hot-spots. Potential chemical and physical drivers were also measured. Large spatial variability of N 2 O fluxes was seen in all three grassland fields. Mean N 2 O fluxes for the historic hot-spots in the grazed fields (DG and YG) were significantly greater than (SC). The mean N 2 O fluxes in DG and YG (117. 9 and 243. 5 ng N m- 2 s- 1) were 15 to 30 % greater than for <b>SC.</b> <b>Soil</b> temperature (15 - 20 °C) was the most significant driver of N 2 O production with a 1 °C rise in soil temperature increasing emissions under DG and YG. N 2 O fluxes were enhanced by the fresh dung but not by urine. However, in the urine treatment, the nutrient input increased the microbial respiration response for the CO 2 flux. Hot-spot N 2 O {{emissions from}} old urine and dung patches were persistent several months after application...|$|E
40|$|Although {{the impact}} of sheet erosion on the {{evolution}} of soils, soil properties and associated ecosystem services across landscapes is undisputed, there are still large uncertainties in the estimation of sheet erosion, as the results obtained are highly scale dependent. Consequently, {{there is a need to}} develop a scale-explicit understanding of sediment erosion yields, from microplot to hillslope through to plot, to surmount actual erosion modelling flaws and to improve guidance for erosion mitigation. The main objective of this study was to compare sediment yields from small and large plots installed under different environmental conditions and to interpret these results in terms of the main mechanisms and controlling factors of sheet erosion. Fifteen 1 x 1 m(2) and ten 2 x 5 m(2) plots were installed on a hillslope in the foothills of the Drakensberg, South Africa. Data of runoff, sediment concentration (<b>SC),</b> <b>soil</b> loss (SL) and rainfall characteristics obtained during the 2009 - 2010 rainy season at the two spatial scales and from different soils, vegetation cover, geology and topographic conditions were used to identify the main controlling factors of sheet erosion. Scale ratios for SC and SL were subsequently calculated to assess the level of contribution of rain-impacted flow (RIF) to overall sheet erosion. The average runoff rate (n?=? 17 events) ranged between 4. 9 +/- 0. 4 ?L?m- 2 on 1 ?m 2 and 5. 4 +/- 0. 6 ?L?m 2 on 10 ?m 2, which did not correspond to significant differences at P?<? 0. 05 level. Sediment losses were significantly higher on the 10 ?m 2 plots, compared with the 1 ?m 2 plots (2. 2 +/- 0. 4 vs 1. 5 +/- 0. 2 ?g?L- 1 for SC; 9. 8 +/- 1. 8 vs 3. 2 +/- 0. 3 ?g?m- 2 for SL), which illustrated a greater efficiency of sheet erosion on longer slopes. Results from a principal component analysis, whose two first axes explained 60 % of the data variance, suggested that sheet erosion is mainly controlled by rainfall characteristics (rainfall intensity and amount) and soil surface features (crusting and vegetation coverage). The contribution of RIF to sheet erosion was the lowest at high soil clay content (r?=? 0. 26) and the highest at high crusting and bulk density (r?=? 0. 22), cumulative rainfall amount in the season and associated rise in soil water table (r?=? 0. 29). Such an explicit consideration of the role of scale on sediment yields and process domination by either in situ (soil and soil surface conditions) or ex situ (rainfall characteristics and antecedent rainfall) factors, is expected to contribute to process-based modelling and erosion mitigation...|$|E

40|$|M. <b>Sc.</b> <b>Soil</b> erosion is {{a serious}} problem in South Africa and correct veld {{management}} is therefore very important for the preservation of plant and animal communities, to preserve the soil, as well as to maintain a sustainable tourist attraction. The Ben Lavin Nature Reserve, south of Louis Trichardt, has a problem with the invasion of sicklebush (Dichrostachys cinerea), that takes over and wipes out the natural vegetation communities and reduce the soil quality. It was considered necessary to conduct a soil analysis in the area, since the application and efficacy of chemical herbicides is greatly dependent on the clay content of the soil, which can be determined during a textural analysis. The objective of this study, therefore, was to conduct an analysis of the soil types iii the reserve according to certain physical and selected chemical parameters. By comparing certain parameters with one another, a holistic view of the soils in the area was obtained, as well as the identification of areas with unique soil qualities. A method to reach optimum veld conditions and to reduce soil erosion by wiping out the sicklebush invaders, was also suggested. A total of 240 soil samples were collected by means of augering along six representative routes in the reserve. The samples were analised during the field work, followed by subsequent laboratory analyses, computer analyses, a cartographic phase and a GIS-phase. It was determined that the soils in the reserve are generally very weakly developed (5 - 25 cm in depth), and also relatively immature, with sub-angularly rounded particles dominating. The maturity increases with soil development, which shows that chemical weathering is the main soil forming prdbess in the area, and that the soils are formed in situ. The median (central particle size), as well as the average particle size, fall mostly in the course soil particle size class (0, 5 - 1 mm diameter), which indicate a high permeability, porosity and infiltration, and low water retention capacity and subsequent low run-off in the area. The soils are generally slightly acidic (pH 5 - 6). The low silt and clay content, generally between one and five percent, with a maximum of 12, 9 %, means that the potential fertility is low and small amounts of plant nutrients are released. The relatively low pH (not too acidic), and low silt and clay content, prove that chemical weathering is taking place at a very slow rate. This can probably be attributed to the relatively low rainfall in the area. Carbonates are absent or occur in very limited quantities in the area, but can be observed where chemical weathering has exposed calcretes and released carbonates. The fact that the soil maturity also increases as the grading of the soil particles improves, supports the fact that the soils in the reserve were formed in situ, and do not consist of transported material. Fluvial erosion thus did not play a role in soil formation the area...|$|E
40|$|Lateritic unpaved {{roads are}} widely spread in Malaysian territory. These red-yellow {{lateritic}} layers normally have poor engineering properties such as large settlements, low shear strength and bearing capacity. Major difficulties may arise during {{the construction of}} a lateritic layer which are deterioration and diffusion of dust on the road surface, and also durability problems associated with cyclic loading repetition. Waste tires are encountered all over the world in increasing numbers. Shredded scrap tires and crumbssoil mixtures are currently used {{in a wide range of}} civil engineering structures like lightweight fills for slopes, retaining walls, embankments etc. This thesis presents and discusses the condition of lateritic soil stabilized by using the shredded tires, tire crumbs and traditional active additive materials such as cement and lime for unpaved road application. Experimental tests such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), california bearing ratio (CBR), consolidated undrained (CU) triaxial, permeability, and highway accelerated loading instrument (HALI) tests were carried out to evaluate the microstructures, elements, durability and geotechnical strength properties of tropical laterite soils. These tests were conducted to determine the influence of stabilizers on the surface of the lateritic soil layers in terms of loading cycles, and short term behaviour. The quick undrained triaxial and CBR tests were carried out on samples at different curing times to establish the optimum mix design. The strength parameters were determined from CU triaxial tests on unsoaked samples. The HALI test was used to study the strength, durability and deformation after determination of the best formulation for each stabilizer in combination with laterite soils under accelerated trafficking load, simultaneously. The close range Photogrammetry technique was also used to capture images of deformed untreated and treated surface. The camera data were analysed using software known as Australis, and Surfer 10 were used to evaluate the performance of unpaved road stabilization with traditional active additives and waste tires. After eliciting of results and data and use of the comparison curves, the behaviour of stabilized soil with different combination were determined. The highest and lowest permeability were STc (soil and tire crumbs) and <b>SC</b> (<b>soil</b> and cement) at 14 days, respectively. The highest CBR values occurred for SC on unsoaked condition in 14 days. The HALI test shows that the highest reduction in settlement was exhibited by SL (soil- 6 %lime) after 14 days curing. Also, the experimental results show that 6 % of lime/cement and 6 % of shredded tires/tires crumbs changed the soil strength, durability, and permeability properties of the lateritic soil for unpaved road applications. The results indicate that the shredded scrap tire and crumbs mixed with active additive had reduced the settlement significantly and also had increased the strength. The analysis of data by close range Photogrammetry technique shows a close approximation to the data obtained from LVDT’s equipment (less than 4. 5 % variance). The numerical simulation results carried out using ABAQUS 6. 11 show a noticeable similarity to the results obtained by full scale HALI model and it is recommended using ABAQUS to simulate the unpaved road behaviour under cyclic loading to save time and cost...|$|E

However, little information is available on (i) to what extent compost amendment concurrently affects the activity, size and composition of soil microbial community, (ii) the relative effect of the addition of a material rich in organic matter versus addition of compost-borne microorganisms in explaining the effects of amendment and (iii) the resilience of community characteristics. We compared five treatments in microcosms: (i) control soil (S), (ii) soil + low level of compost (<b>Sc),</b> (iii) <b>soil</b> + high level of compost (<b>SC),</b> (iv) sterilized <b>soil</b> + high level of compost [(S) C] and (v) soil + high level of sterilized compost [S(C) ]. The actual C mineralization rate, substrate-induced respiration, size of microbial community (biomass and heterotrophic cells number), and structure of total microbial (phospholipid fatty acids) and bacterial (automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis, ARISA) communities were surveyed during 6 months after amendment. Our results show that (i) compost amendment affected the activity, size and composition of the soil microbial community, (ii) the effect of compost amendment was mainly due to the physicochemical characteristics of compost matrix rather than to compost-borne microorganisms and (iii) no resilience of microbial characteristics was observed 6 – 12 months after amendment with a high amount of compost...|$|R

The tests on the shear strength properties of <b>SC</b> <b>soils</b> were carried out by using large, medium and small scale direct shear equipment with shear box dimensions of 60, 100 and 300 mm. The undistributed samples, having almost the same properties, were tested in three square shear boxes of varying sizes.

The results show the effect of scale on the test. The large and medium scale direct shear produces a higher cohesion and lower friction angle compared with the results of the small-scale direct shear test. The tests indicate that the friction angle and cohesion increase when soil density {{in each of the three}} boxes increases. Therefore, these observations suggest that strength parameters are controlled by the scaling effect and physical properties of the soil.

Despite cleavage and avid binding, PrP Sc bound to Mte remained infectious.

To improve and develop my professional skills, a wetland assessment and delineation was performed for Lakewood Heights, a proposed residential subdivision consisting of 133 hectares, more or less, located in northeast Harris County, Texas. The subject property was evaluated for its content of jurisdictional wetlands, based on U. S. Army corps of Engineers criteria, using interpretation of historical aerial photography, topographic maps, hydrology indicators, and data gathered from site reconnaissance activities. The identified wetland areas were delineated as accurately as possible, based on available information, and were mapped on a survey plat of the property. These areas were contrasted with surrounding uplands, which were mapped as well. Broad scale mapping of soil types by the SCS appears to have been moderately accurate. Through site reconnaissance activities, I verified the <b>scs</b> <b>soil</b> mapping, identified previously unmapped hydric soils, and evaluated and documented vegetation communities that further delineated wetland/upland boundaries. By employing the methods outlined in the 1987 Corps of Engineers Delineation manual that call for evaluations of hydric soils, hydrology indicators, and hydrophytic vegetation, I concluded that approximately 14. 68 hectares of the subject property were jurisdictional wetlands. The remaining 118. 32 hectares were classified as upland (non-wetland). The wetland delineations made on the subject property were approached in a conservative manner, taking into account transitional or overflow areas which are sometimes hard to define. Those areas which appeared adjacent to a saturated or inundated wetland within the same hydrologic and hydrophytic vegetation regime were included in wetland boundaries. This method of delineation, in my opinion, provides the highest reliability for, even under varying seasonal circumstances, those areas that would appear as jurisdictional waters of the United states. upon completion of the field assessment, the data were assembled into a technical report and presented to the client for his use. we discussed my findings, reviewed the methodology used to determine that wetlands did, in fact, exist on the property and examined land management options, including u. s.

The soil moisture content models for multiple textures (M_SMC models) were based on selected hyperspectral reflectance data located around 1460, 1900 and 2010 nm and resulted in R 2 values higher than 0. 933. Meanwhile, the soil salt concentrations were also accurately (R 2 > 0. 748) modeled (M_SSC models) based on wavebands located at 540, 1740, 2010 and 2350 nm.

In Urussanga (<b>SC),</b> Brazil, <b>soil</b> samples were collected from a 4 -year-old and 15 -yearold vineyard, and from a forested area. In the soils, the chemical characteristics of Cu and Zn were analyzed by the EDTA method, which determines the fraction available in soil; 3050 B method of the USEPA for total concentrations, which represents the pseudo-soil contents in the soil; and chemical fractionation, which estimates soluble fraction, exchangeable fraction, fraction associated with clay minerals, fraction associated with organic matter and residual fraction. The results show that there is accumulation of Cu and Zn in sandy soils cultivated with grapevines and with frequent fungicide applications. These higher levels were found in soils with longer cultivation time (15 years old), but were restricted to the superficial layers of the soil. Most of the Cu was extracted by EDTA method, and it may be considered as available to plants. The EDTA also extracted a small part of Zn. Most of the Cu in the vineyard soils can be characterized by low geochemical mobility, but in the uppermost soil layers of the oldest vineyard, there was an increase in Cu content associated with soil organic matter. Most of the Zn in the vineyard soil was associated with minerals, which indicates low mobility and also low potential for toxicity to plants and microorganisms...|$|R

The area is underlain by the Crystalline Basement rocks composed of Granite Gneiss with late Diorite, Basalts and Pegmatite intrusions. The older units have been intruded by the Biotite Granite of the Younger Granite province, occurring as a ridge bordering the northeastern margin of the area. Structures observed in the area include fault/shear zones, pegmatite dykes, basaltic dykes and fractures. The dominant trend is in the NE-SW direction with local deviations in NNE-SSW, WNW-ESE, NW-SE and NNW–SSE. The joints are generally vertical with few dipping steeply to the SE or SW. Thus it is evident that the early NNW-SSE trending foliation in the granite gneiss guided the regional structural development in the area. This feature thus controlled all the other structures (anticline, shear zones, fractures and the river channel), all of which are oriented in the same direction. This dominant NE-SW trend may be associated with development of the Benue Valley of Nigeria.

40|$|In recent decades, {{agriculture}} is challenged to develop strategies for sustainability which conserve non-renewable natural {{resources such as}} soil. Soil improving conservation systems aim at improving soil functions {{and at the same}} time ensuring high productivity. Such soil management systems have to be adapted to climate and soil specific conditions, and may include reduced tillage, balanced crop rotation, retention of crop residues, cover crops, and appropriate timing of field operations. Changes in soil functions have huge impacts on environmental flows like hydrology, crop production, solute transfer, and CO 2 emission at macroscale. Soil structure is considered as one of the key factors for soil functioning. The effect of different land management on soil structure and consequently on soil hydrodynamics is not fully understood and still under investigation. The main aim of this thesis was to evaluate the effect of crop residue management on soil structure by measuring soil hydraulic properties in pedon and core scale. The agronomic context was different crop residue management in a reduced tillage system. The experimental field is named as Solresidus located in Gembloux, Belgium. Since 2008, the field has been under conservation system. Different residue management includes reduced tillage with incorporation of crop residues (RT-in) and without incorporation (RT-out). A large part of this thesis was methodological development to obtain accurate results from experimentations. Many studies have been made and documented in literature to develop indirect methods to predict soil hydrology from soil water retention curve (SWRC). There is no measuring device available which can determine the SWRC over the entire soil moisture range. Therefore, one of the methodological developments was to obtain complete SWRC by combining three different methods in core scale: X-ray computed microtomography (X-ray CT), HYPROP evaporation and Richards pressure plate method to obtain the entire SWRC. The combination of these methods found well justified to obtain the accurate and complete SWRC. Saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks), specific connectivity (<b>SC)</b> of <b>soil</b> pores and bulk density of the soil were also measured in core and pore scale. There were soil moisture sensors (capacitance sensors) in the field to observe the soil moisture dynamics in pedon scale. Another important methodological development was to obtain the calibration results with the moisture sensor according to the soil texture and horizons. Calibration results found quite satisfying to get the accurate moisture content of the field; it was also noticed that it could be over estimation of soil moisture without the calibration. Significantly, average higher moisture content was observed by the moisture sensors in RT-in than RT-out during the canopy formation to harvest of winter wheat in 2014. The SWRCs also showed that plant available water content was higher in RT-in than RT-out. <b>SC</b> of <b>soil</b> pores was also significantly higher at the surface soil of RT-in than RT-out. RT-in found to have significant positive effects on soil structure by reducing bulk density, increasing SC, Ks and retention of soil moisture during the observation period of this study. Crop yield was marginally higher and organic matter content was significantly higher in RT-in than RT-out (results from close collaboration). Therefore, reduced tillage with residues incorporation found to have better soil hydraulics together with better crop yield than reduced tillage without incorporation of crop residues...|$|R
40|$|Background: For {{sustainable}} {{improvement of}} wheat-based farming {{systems in the}} North Africa, {{there is a need}} to improve plant health, soil health and fertility. One approach to achieve this is by integrating subsidiary crops (SC) as living or dead mulches or cover crops with the main crops in rotations, which will increase plant species and microbial diversity and reducing water demand in dry climates. Methods: A collaborative research project funded by EU FP 7 (Project No. 289277) was initiated in April 2012, in partnership with European Union (public research organizations and private sector small and medium enterprises of Germany, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, the Netherland, UK, Poland, Switzerland and Italy), Brazil and Morocco (INRA-Morocco and ICARDA), in order to enhance understanding and use of SC systems, develop suitable farm technologies, increase the range of SC species, and enhance understanding of impact of <b>SC</b> on <b>soil</b> ecology, biology and microbial diversity and crop pests and diseases. Results: Based on two field experiments in Morocco (Sidi AI-Aidi and Sidi Allal-Tazi), the project will assess the economic and ecological impact including legume root health and soil health, fertility and microbial diversity and compare the results with other sites in Europe. Screening of new species and genotypes will result in identification of range of potentially useful plant species for SC for the North Africa and Europe. The identified SC species will be tested for their potential as forage and for extraction of useful biochemicals. Conclusion: The results of the project as a whole will be of use for and improve sustainability in low-input, organic, and conventional farming systems in the North Africa, Latin America and Europe. ...|$|R

Contents of SOC, total nitrogen (TN), particulate organic carbon (POC), and labile organic carbon (LOC), and their stratification ratios (SR) and carbon management indexes (CMI) were determined on soil profiles from 0 to 200 cm. Results showed that the SOC, TN, POC and LOC stocks of RP were significantly higher than that of <b>SC</b> in <b>soil</b> layers of 0 - 10, 10 - 40, 40 - 100 and 100 - 200 cm (P 2. 0 in most cases of RP, CK and AB. Moreover, CMI values of RP, CK, and AB increased by 11. 61 - 61. 53 % in soil layer of 100 - 200 cm compared with SC. Significant positive correlations between SOC stocks and CMI or SR values of both surface soil and deep soil layers indicated that they were suitable indicators for soil quality and carbon changes evaluation. The Grain-to-Green Program (GTGP) had strong influence on improving quantity and activity of SOC pool through all soil layers of converted lands, and deep soil organic carbon should be considered in C cycle induced by GTGP. It was concluded that converting slope croplands to RP forestlands was the most efficient way for sequestering C in LHR soils...|$|R

Soil carbon {{plays an important role in}} soil water holding capacity, soil structure and overall soil health. Soil is also a significant store of terrestrial carbon. This study examines total <b>soil</b> carbon (<b>SC)</b> concentration at the hillslope and catchment scale in the Tin Camp Creek catchment, Arnhem Land, Northern Territory, Australia. The catchment is largely undisturbed by European agriculture or management practices and is located in the monsoonal tropics. Results show that SC concentration along hillslope transects has remained consistent over a number of years and it is strongly related to hillslope position and topographic factors derived from precision surveying and provides a baseline assessment. Poor relationships were found when using a good quality medium resolution digital elevation model to derive topographic factors. This finding demonstrates the need for high resolution survey data for the prediction of total C at the hillslope and catchment scale. There was little difference in SC concentration between years and overall, SC down the hillslope profile varies little temporally suggesting that concentrations are relatively stable in this environment. An assessment of the relationship between <b>SC</b> and <b>soil</b> erosion using ¹³⁷Cs and erosion pins demonstrates that sediment transport and deposition play little role in the distribution of SC in this environment. Vegetative biomass appears to be the major contributor to SC concentration with vegetative biomass being strongly controlled by topographic factors. While the SC concentration is constant over the study period further sampling is required to assess decadal trends...|$|R

A soil conductivity meter (EM 38) {{was used to measure}} EC a under four soil Moisture Contents (MC) (4. 965. 336. 94 and 8. 0 %) and a range of <b>Soil</b> Compaction (<b>SC)</b> levels (on the average, from 220 to 2070 kPa). At each MC and SC level, EM 38 measurements were recorded at three EM 38 heights above the ground (0, 20 and 40 cm) and at vertical and horizontal device orientation. Except at the MC of 8. 0 %, results revealed that the measured EC a was proportional to SC at all considered soil conditions and modes of measurement (EM 38 orientation and height). For all soil conditions and modes of measurement, an overall mean of the coefficient of correlation (R 2) of 0. 66 was observed between SC and EC a at soil MC of up to 6. 94 %. Thus, EC a measurement can be an indicator of soil compaction, given that the MC is below 7 % in sandy soil. For both EM 38 orientations, higher correlations between <b>SC</b> and <b>soil</b> EC a (average R 2 of 0. 90) were observed with the EM 38 placed on the ground (0 cm height) compared to those achieved at 20 cm and 40 cm height, where the average R 2 values were 0. 62 and 0. 47, respectively. At 0 cm height and MC of up to 6. 94 %, higher correlations between SC and EC a were obtained at vertical EM 38 orientation (average R 2 of 0. 98) compared to those at horizontal orientation (average R 2 of 0. 81) ...|$|R

The data came from 36 soil samples from 0 to 20 Â cm depth, and 36 groundwater samples in the Tikanlik Oasis on the lower reaches of the Tarim River, northwest China. The objective was to provide a scientific basis for understanding the heterogeneity of the spatial distribution of soil properties on a large scale with the goal of accelerating the sustainable development of agriculture in the oasis. The results showed that the SC and SM of the surface soil varied greatly, but the SOC and total N varied very little. A possible reason for the low variability of SOC and total N was the relatively consistent human activities within the typical agricultural oasis with more than 75 % land used as cropland and orchards, because there was no significant effect of land use types on soil total N and SOC. Geostatistical analysis and the kriging estimator showed that SC and SM had a strong spatial autocorrelation. One-way ANOVA and LSD suggested that land use was the main structural indicator that resulted in the spatial autocorrelation of SC and SM within the 0 - 20 Â cm soil depth through its significant differences in soil texture, irrigation and groundwater. In particular, croplands and orchards had significantly higher SM, silt and clay particle percentages and lower SC compared to other land uses due to regular irrigation. Additionally, irrigation could effectively relieve the degree of the hazard from soil salt and soil water stress in cropland.

Several feedbacks exist between overgrazing, vegetation, soil infiltration by water and soil erosion that need to be better understood. In this study of a sub-humid overgrazed rangeland in South Africa, the main objective was to evaluate the impact of grass cover on soil infiltration by water and soil detachment. Artificial rains of 30 and 60 mm h(- 1) were applied for 30 min on 1 m(2) micro-plots showing similar sandy-loam Acrisols with different proportions of soil surface coverage by grass (Class A: 75 - 100 %; B: 75 - 50 %; C: 50 - 25 %; D: 25 - 5 %; E: 5 - 0 % with an outcropping A horizon; F: 0 % with an outcropping B horizon) to evaluate pre-runoff rainfall (Pr), steady state water infiltration (I), sediment concentration (<b>SC)</b> and <b>soil</b> losses (SL). Whatever the class of vegetal cover and the rainfall intensity, with the exception of two plots probably affected by biological activity, I decreased regularly to a steady rate < 2 mm h(- 1) after 15 min rain. There was no significant correlation between I and Pr with vegetal cover. The average SC computed from the two rains increased from 0. 16 g L- 1 (class A) to 48. 5 g L- 1 (class F) while SL was varied between 4 g m(- 2) h(- 1) for A and 1883 g m(- 2) h(- 1) for F. SL increased significantly with decreasing vegetal cover with an exponential increase while the removal of the A horizon increased SC and SL by a factor of 4. The results support the belief that soil vegetation cover and overgrazing plays a major role in soil infiltration by water but also suggest that the interrill erosion process is self-increasing.

This research was aimed at assessing the potential of 5 % (w/w) of three organic waste amendments (biowastes) [tea leaf (TL), soy cake (SC) and potato skin (PS) ] to enhance degradation of diesel in contaminated soils for a period of 270 days. Addition of biowastes, especially <b>SC,</b> to contaminated <b>soil</b> planted with P. polystachyus rapidly increased the rate of removal of diesel fuel by 90 % and 84 % in soil contaminated with 1 % and 2. 5 % oil, respectively. Loss of diesel fuel at 53 % and 43 % were recorded in treatments without organic waste amendment and planted with P. polystachyus in 1 % and 2. 5 % contamination, respectively. Diesel fuel degradation was more rapid in the <b>soil</b> amendment with <b>SC</b> than in other organic waste amendments. P. polystachyus roots did not accumulate oil from the contaminated soil, but the number of hydrocarbon utilizing bacteria (HUB) was high in the rhizosphere, thus suggesting that the mechanism of the oil degradation was via rhizodegradation or phytovolitilization.

40|$|Potato {{productivity}} {{in the northeastern}} US has been relatively constant for over 50 years, raising questions about what factors are limiting productivity. Research was initiated in 2004 to identify key constraints to potato productivity by evaluating Status Quo (SQ), <b>Soil</b> Conserving (<b>SC),</b> and <b>Soil</b> Improving (SI) cropping systems under both rainfed and irrigated management, and {{it was found that}} addition of compost or irrigation substantially increased yield. In this study, we employed partial budgeting to determine cost differences and their impact on net revenue for these cropping systems. Differences in systems were primarily associated with rotation length, tillage operations, compost and application ex penses, and water management practices. When compost (as composted dairy manure) was annually applied at 19 Mg haf - 1 and evaluated over the entire 3 -year crop rotation cycle, the compost-amended rainfed SI system was more expen sive to maintain than the irrigated SC system if compost cost exceeded $ 3. 63 Mg - 1. Average marketable yields were used to calculate gross and net revenue for each system. Because average potato yield for the irrigated SQ system (28. 4 Mg·ha - 1) equaled that in the rainfed SI system (28. 3 Mg·ha - 1), we were able to compare cost of irrigation versus com post for achieving comparable yield. The compost-amended SI system under rainfed management generated more net revenue from the potato crop than the irrigated SQ system when compost costs were less than $ 7. 42 Mg - 1. When com pared to the commonly used rainfed SQ system, rainfed SI achieved higher net revenue as long as compost cost was less than $ 22. 95 Mg - 1. The rainfed SI system achieved higher net revenue than the irrigated SC system when compost cost was $ 9. 43 Mg - 1 or less, but generated greater net revenue than the rainfed SC system regardless of compost costs, due to substantially higher yields associated with compost amendment. This investigation demonstrates that compost is a po tentially viable substitute to irrigation for potato in the northeastern US; however, such potential is highly dependent on suitable compost sources and application costs. </span...|$|R

A randomized split-block design with three replications was used. The treatments were combinations of three summer cropping sequences - corn/corn (Zea mays L.) (CC), soybean/soybean (Glycine max L. Merryll) (SS), and soybean-corn (SC); and seven winter crops - corn, sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.), oilseed radish (Raphanus sativus L.), pearl millet (Pennisetum americanum (L.) Leeke), pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp), grain sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench), and sunn hemp (Crotalaria juncea L.). Soil samples were taken at the 0 - 10 cm depth after eight years of experimentation. <b>Soil</b> under <b>SC</b> and CC had higher mean weight diameter (3. 63 and 3. 55 mm, respectively) and geometric mean diameter (3. 55 and 2. 92 mm) of the aggregates compared to soil under SS (3. 18 and 2. 46 mm). The CC resulted in the highest soil organic C content (17. 07 g kg- 1), soil C stock (15. 70 Mg ha- 1), and rate of C sequestration (0. 70 Mg ha- 1 yr- 1) among the summer crops.

The effect of stand age on Fs was examined using a replicated chronosequence approach in which stands ranging from 1 to 25 years since planting were investigated. Soil CO 2 efflux was measured on both VA and SC sites for over a year using a closed dynamic system. Multiple linear regression was used to evaluate Fs correlates and examine the relationship between candidate explanatory variables and Fs. Soil temperature (top 10 cm) was the major correlate with Fs on both locations. We observed a positive age effect on Fs in VA stands and no relationship between age and Fs in <b>SC</b> stands. Annual <b>soil</b> C efflux declined with stand age in SC due to both reductions in soil temperatures as crown closure occurs and a diminishing heterotrophic C substrate pool.

To investigate the variabilities and distributions of soil water and salt contents at various groundwater level (GL), soil columns with planting Tamarix chinensis Lour were established at six different GL. The results demonstrated the following: With increasing GL, the relative soil water content (RWC) declined significantly, whereas the salt content (<b>SC)</b> and absolute <b>soil</b> solution concentration (CS) decreased after the initial increase in the different soil profiles. A GL of 1. 2 m was the turning point for variations in the soil water and salt contents, and it represented the highest GL that could maintain the soil surface moist within the soil columns. Both the SC and CS reached the maximum levels in these different soil profiles at a GL of 1. 2 m. With the raise of soil depth, the RWC increased significantly, whereas the SC increased after an initial decrease.
