500|$|When Pretty in Pink co-star Molly Ringwald told Out {{magazine}} in 2012 {{that she believed}} Cryer's character was gay, Cryer defended Duckie and other [...] "slightly effeminate dorks," [...] and said {{he has had to}} live with others' [...] "faulty" [...] gaydar. Also in 2012, Joyner told Jeff Probst that when she and Cryer started dating, <b>she</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> might be gay because [...] "he never kissed me." [...] Cryer was asked in 2014 if he was [...] "mistaken for gay"; he again called himself [...] "an effeminate heterosexual dork" [...] and cracked a joke about never being propositioned: [...] "Fellas, you're dropping the ball." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ishida and Abe {{returned}} to Ogu, where they remained until his death. During their love-making this time, Abe put the knife {{to the base}} of Ishida's penis, and said she would make sure he would never play around with another woman. Ishida laughed at this. Two nights into this bout of sex, Abe began choking Ishida, and he told her to continue, saying that this increased his pleasure. She had him do it to her as well. On the evening of May 16, 1936, Abe used her obi sash to cut off Ishida's breathing during orgasm, and they both enjoyed it. They repeated this for two more hours. Once Abe stopped the strangulation, Ishida's face became distorted, and would not return to its normal appearance. Ishida took 30 tablets of a sedative called Calmotin to try to soothe his pain. According to Abe, as Ishida started to doze, he told her, [...] "You'll put the cord around my neck and squeeze it again while I'm sleeping, won't you... If you start to strangle me, don't stop, because it is so painful afterward." [...] Abe commented that <b>she</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had wanted her to kill him, but on reflection decided he must have been joking.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> would laugh--it {{sounded so}} silly. But he did not.|$|E
5000|$|In his office, Gunn {{encounters}} Eve, {{who says}} that things were a lot simpler {{when he was just}} hunting vamps on the street with his gang. <b>She</b> <b>wonders</b> <b>if</b> <b>he’s</b> ready for “the next step” and he confirms that he is; she hands him a business card and says, “You’ll feel like a new man.” ...|$|R
50|$|Gabriela recounts how {{she fell}} in love with Benito. They were running from some skinheads who had picked a fight with Benito. Despite the danger he still paused and took time to remark how {{beautiful}} the moon was. She recalls this as the moment {{she fell in}} love with him. <b>She</b> <b>wonders</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> still notices the moon- and <b>if</b> <b>he</b> is in fact still the man she loved.|$|R
5000|$|The story {{centers on}} Sana Kashimura, a little orphan {{girl who is}} one of the {{children}} that holds the power of [...] "Alice's Dream," [...] a special ability that enables her to materialize anything she imagines. After escaping a lab where she was a test subject, she ends up in the outside world where she encounters a grumpy old man named Zouroku, but <b>she</b> <b>wonders</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> will help her.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{had really}} spoken in sincerity, or if he, too, were mocking fate. They walked {{slowly through the}} broiling sun towards their lodging.|$|E
6000|$|She flushed. <b>She</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> was {{thinking}} of the child they would have when, as he put it, they were [...] "sure they could afford one." ...|$|E
60|$|Tess {{could not}} get on with her digging after this; she felt restless; <b>she</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{had gone back to}} her father's house; and taking the fork in her hand {{proceeded}} homewards.|$|E
50|$|While {{visiting his}} mother in the hospital, he again meets the medical student Mira, whose father (Jerry Adler) is also a camp survivor. Lukas asks Mira {{to go out with}} him. She agrees, but is upset by his {{obsession}} with holocaust memories, especially since he is not Jewish. <b>She</b> <b>wonders</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> is a voyeur. He insists the memories are important. She asks him about his own childhood, and Lukas replies that he cannot remember one good memory from his own childhood.|$|R
50|$|Polina is {{frustrated}} that she cannot repay her debts to the Marquis. While Alexei continues to protest that <b>he</b> loves her, <b>she</b> <b>wonders</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> has any other interest than greed. The General interrupts their conversation. Polina challenges Alexei {{to prove his}} love, and to see <b>if</b> <b>he</b> would truly do anything for her, by making a pass at a German Baroness sitting in the park. Alexei does this, to the anger of the Baron. In the ensuing fuss, the Baron and Baroness leave.|$|R
50|$|Before {{the family}} leaves on their trip, Stella {{and her father}} work on their plan to ask Gramps's wealthy twin brother for a loan to repair the {{crumbling}} Abbey. Maisie slips away, spying Lucas furtively leaving for Cambridge on Julia's bike. <b>She</b> <b>wonders</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> has stolen it. Maisie then overhears a passionate argument between Dan and Finn, followed by an equally passionate embrace. The house is filled with fear, distrust and despair. Maisie doesn't know {{what is wrong with}} her family but decides she must take action to help them.|$|R
60|$|When {{she woke}} up she was {{thinking}} of Alexander. It was such a long time since she had thought of him. <b>She</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had a right to be angry with her.|$|E
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{had already}} landed in Boulogne! Again {{she remembered the}} vision on the landing stage: his massive figure, the glimpse she had of the loved form, {{in the midst of}} the crowd! ...|$|E
60|$|He sprang up, {{strode to}} her with a nervous step, {{smoothed}} her hand. She wondered if {{she ought to be}} offended by his caress. Then <b>she</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> liked her hat, the new Oriental turban of rose and silver brocade.|$|E
500|$|Musically, [...] "Radar" [...] {{runs through}} a midtempo dance groove. Spears' vocals are auto tuned and {{accompanied}} by sonar pulses and a heavy usage of distorted synthesizers. The lyrics refer to an attraction between the protagonist and a man, while <b>she</b> <b>wonders</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> knows what <b>she</b> is feeling. [...] "Radar" [...] received mixed reviews from critics; some called {{it one of the}} highlights of Blackout, while others felt that it was over-produced and also criticized her vocals for being processed. In July 2008, [...] "Radar" [...] charted in the top forty of Ireland and New Zealand, and inside the top-ten in Sweden. After it was released as a single from Circus, the track performed poorly on the charts and did not manage to enter the top forty in most countries. However, it became her 21st hit on the US Billboards Pop Songs chart, the most for any artist of the decade.|$|R

50|$|Angua assists Vimes {{in another}} {{diplomatic}} mission in Monstrous Regiment, and is mentioned in Going Postal as being difficult for criminals in Ankh-Morpork to avoid. Angua also {{appears in a}} supporting role in Thud!, where she gains a rival {{in the form of}} the Watch's first vampire officer, Sally. Angua is an extremely practical and level-headed person. While not as cynical as Commander Sam Vimes, she balances out Carrot's naïveté (although <b>she</b> occasionally <b>wonders</b> <b>if</b> <b>he's</b> really as innocent as he appears). In human form, Angua is a strict vegetarian. In wolf form, she has a tendency to go after chickens, but she is always careful to go back and slip some money under the door the next day.|$|R
60|$|She {{saw that}} his boots were all clayey, even his {{trousers}} were plastered with clay. And <b>she</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had made footprints all the way up. He was a very strange figure, standing in her bedroom, near the tossed bed.|$|E
60|$|This was a fresh {{surprise}} {{and almost as}} great a shock as {{the loss of her}} little dog, who had been so faithful to her ever since the first day she had seen him. <b>She</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had strayed away or if the old man had stolen him.|$|E
60|$|Unconsciously and involuntarily he infused so much triumph {{into the}} simple monosyllable that even old Robert felt it. Mrs. Williamson, who was cutting bread {{at the end}} of the table, laid down her knife and loaf, and looked at the young man with a softly troubled {{expression}} in her eyes. <b>She</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had been back to the Connors orchard--and if he could have seen Kilmeny Gordon again.|$|E
60|$|It {{was in this}} wise that Lucy battled {{with the}} {{intolerable}} shame that oppressed her. In that quiet corner of Hampshire in which her early years had been spent, among the memories of her dead kindred, the pride of her race had grown to unreasonable proportions; and now in the reaction she was terrified lest its decadence was in her, too, and in George. She could do nothing but suffer whatever pain it pleased the gods to send; but George was a man. In him were placed all her hopes. But now and again wild panic seized her. Then the agony was too great to bear, and she pressed {{her hands to her}} eyes in order to drive away the hateful thought: what if George failed her? She knew well enough that he had his father's engaging ways and his father's handsome face; but his father had had a smile as frank and a charm as great. What if with the son, too, they betokened only insincerity and weakness? A malicious devil whispered in her ear that now and again she had averted her eyes in order not to see George do things she hated. But it was youth that drove him. She had taken care to keep from him knowledge of the sordid struggles that occupied her, and how could <b>she</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> was reckless and uncaring? She would not doubt him, she could not doubt him, for if anything went wrong with him there was no hope left. She could only cease to believe in herself.|$|R
60|$|Barbara {{watched him}} covertly, {{and once more}} noticed the slight {{hardening}} of his lips, and the very faint deepening of the bronze in his cheeks. It was only just perceptible, but though the sun and wind had darkened its tinting, Brooke had a clear English complexion, and the blood showed through his skin. His companion remembered the old house in the English valley, with its trim gardens and great sweep of velvet lawn, where he had {{admitted that he had}} once been long ago. The statement she had fancied at the time was purposely vague, and <b>she</b> <b>wondered</b> now <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had meant that he had lived there, for Barbara possessed the not unusual feminine capacity for putting two and two together. She, however, naturally showed nothing of this.|$|R
50|$|Doctor Scott {{comes to}} the house to check on Emmerline. He doesn’t allow Charity to come into the room with him while he checks on her heart and current condition. While he is in there, all <b>she</b> panics while <b>wondering</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> will come back to say that her {{daughter}} needs to have surgery, which she cannot easily afford. To her dismay, the doctor comes back to reveal that the operation is Emmerline’s last chance at survival, and that he will perform the surgery at a discount. The doctor exits allowing Charity {{to decide whether or not}} Emmerline should have this operation.|$|R
60|$|Then she {{sat down}} to watch her mother die, and to think. Could there be any good God, <b>she</b> <b>wondered,</b> <b>if</b> <b>He</b> allowed such things to happen. Poor girl! it was her first {{experience}} of the sort, and as yet she did not know what things are allowed to happen in this world in obedience to the workings of unalterable laws by whoever and for whatever purpose these may be decreed.|$|E
60|$|The woman noticed {{nothing of}} all this. She was small, very pretty, still young, and gowned in a quite unmistakable way. She studied the man's profile furtively. He looked older than {{when she had}} seen him last--there were some silver threads gleaming in his close-clipped dark hair and short, pointed beard. Otherwise there was little change in the quiet {{features}} and somewhat stern grey eyes. <b>She</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had cared at all.|$|E
6000|$|Both the retort and the {{rejoinder}} {{had come}} quicker than anything previously exchanged, {{and they were}} followed, on Maggie's part, by a momentary drop. But she was not to fall away, and while her companion {{kept his eyes on}} her, while <b>she</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> weren't expecting her to name his wife then, with high hypocrisy, as paying for his daughter's bliss, she produced something that she felt to be much better. [...] "I'm talking about YOU." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Good-bye, Mr. Gereth--I {{must get}} on!" [...] she {{declared}} with a cheerfulness {{that she felt}} to be an unnatural grimace. She broke away from him sharply, smiling, backing across the grass and then turning altogether and moving {{as fast as she}} could. [...] "Good-bye, good-bye!" [...] she threw off again as <b>she</b> went, <b>wondering</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> would overtake her before she reached the gate; conscious with a red disgust that her movement was almost a run; conscious too of just the confused, handsome face with which he would look after her. She felt as if she had answered a kindness with a great flouncing snub, but at any rate she had got away, though the distance to the gate, her ugly gallop down the Broad Walk, every graceless jerk of which hurt her, seemed endless. She signed from afar to a cab on the stand in the Kensington Road and scrambled into it, glad of the encompassment of the four-wheeler that had officiously obeyed her summons and that, at the end of twenty yards, when she had violently pulled up a glass, permitted her to recognize {{the fact that she was}} on the point of bursting into tears.|$|R
6000|$|... "Quite ready, James," [...] she answered, {{keeping her}} eyes on her work. For some months past she had felt ill at ease when she was alone with this rough, stern son of hers. Her shallow secret nature was troubled when their eyes met. <b>She</b> used to <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{suspected}} anything. The silence, for he made no other observation, became intolerable to her. She began to complain. Women defend themselves by attacking, just as they attack by sudden and strange surrenders. [...] "I hope you will be contented, James, with your sea-faring life," [...] she said. [...] "You must remember that it is your own choice. You might have entered a solicitor's office. Solicitors are a very respectable class, and in the country often dine with the best families." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 2010, to {{celebrate}} Neighbours 25th anniversary Sky, a British satellite broadcasting company profiled 25 characters {{of which they}} believed were the most memorable in the series history. Toadie is in the list and describing him they state: [...] "Toadie - or Jarrod, to his bogan mother - has taken the mantle from Harold of looking after the Ramsay Street flock, ending his time as the errant child of the Street. After all, he entered the show as a bad influence on pretty boy Billy Kennedy, and there was that weird period when he ran a bikini store, Bounce, with House of Trouser co-member Connor. There's something a little Ian Beale about the character - he's slightly annoying, it's difficult to care about his plots and you dread the day he's going to attempt a sex scene, but the show just wouldn't work without him." [...] They also describe his most memorable scenes as {{the death of his}} wife Dee; looking after Callum; on-off relationship with Steph. Holy Soap also described Dee's death scenes as his most memorable. Roz Laws of the Sunday Mercury said Toadie and Callum shared an [...] "unlikely love" [...] for wrestling. <b>She</b> also <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> was actually up to the challenge of looking after Callum full-time.|$|R
60|$|So she {{had heard}} surmises as to the {{remaining}} crew of that unfortunate ship, where, perhaps, Moses had a father. And sometimes <b>she</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> were lying fathoms deep with sea-nymphs ringing his knell, and whether Moses ever thought about him; and yet she could no more have asked him a question about it than {{if she had been}} born dumb. She decided that she should never show him this poetry--it might make him feel unhappy.|$|E
60|$|Marguerite {{wondered}} at what particular spot, on this lonely coast, Percy {{could be at}} this moment. Not very far surely, for he had had {{less than a quarter}} of an hour's start of Chauvelin. <b>She</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> knew that in this cool, ocean-scented bit of France, there lurked many spies, all eager to sight his tall figure, to track him to where his unsuspecting friends waited for him, and then, to close the net over him and them.|$|E
6000|$|What {{a strange}} contradiction of a man! <b>She</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> would come with lowered visor, {{for she was}} still curious to see the face that lay behind the cold, steel mask. She would ask him this night to let her see his face, or would that be cruel? For, did they not {{say that it was}} from the very ugliness of it that he kept his helm closed to hide the repulsive sight from the eyes of men! ...|$|E
50|$|Drake is {{actually}} {{a member of the}} World Security Board. That night, he mentions to Rose that Tholan had been asking around about him before the visit, and intimates that he is there to see him, not Rose. Intrigued, and entertaining the possibility Tholan is an imposter, the next day Rose reads some of Tholan's work which causes her to abandon that notion. She begins to consider whether the disease was created on Earth as a form of biological weapon, but rejects it as almost impossible given their almost complete lack of understanding of alien physiology. Considering Drake, <b>she</b> begins to <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> married her specifically to meet Tholan, but again rejects the possibility as too wild to consider. Reviewing the entire conversation between Tholan and Drake the previous night, she notes that there is one extremely odd moment, Drake's seemingly overreaction to Tholan's polite mention of what a good hostess she was.|$|R
60|$|Miss Trotter {{raised her}} dark eyes and looked {{steadily}} at him. Accustomed as he was to men and women, the look strongly held him. He saw in her eyes an intelligence equal to his own, a knowledge of good and evil, and a toleration and philosophy, equal to his own, but a something else that was as distinct and different as their sex. And therein lay its charm, for it merely translated itself in his mind that she had very pretty eyes, which he had never noticed before, without any aggressive intellectual quality. And with this, alas! came the man's propensity to reason. It meant of course but ONE thing; he saw it all now! <b>If</b> <b>HE,</b> in his preoccupation and coolness, had noticed her eyes, so also had the younger and emotional Chris. The young fellow {{was in love with}} her! It was that which had stimulated his recovery, and <b>she</b> was <b>wondering</b> <b>if</b> <b>he,</b> the doctor, had observed it. He smiled back the superior smile of our sex in moments of great inanity, and poor Miss Trotter believed he understood her. A few days after this, she noticed that Frida Jansen was wearing a pearl ring and a somewhat ostentatious locket. She remembered now that Mr. Bilson had told her that the Roanoke Ledge was very rich, and that Calton was likely to prove a profitable guest. But it was not HER business.|$|R
5000|$|White Dog {{quickly became}} a bestseller in the United States after its English release. Phoebe Adams of The Atlantic felt the story was ironic, and noted that it was [...] "presumably" [...] true. She felt the {{depiction}} of Marlon Brando was [...] "tartly funny" [...] and that story as a whole served [...] "as an excuse for Mr. Garys comments on racial affairs in this country, a matter on which is somewhat less pessimistic than the natives {{and a good deal}} more sensible." [...] The Globe and Mails H. J. Kirchhoff considered it a [...] "riveting, thoughtful work" [...] that serves as a metaphor for American racism. Julien Roumette felt Romains depiction of the racial tensions in America at the time was [...] "meticulously reconstituted, with a realistic, even documentary, rather exceptional dimension." [...] Julia Weldon of Harpers Magazine remarked with amusement that the events of the novel were ones that [...] "only a Frenchman" [...] could have found himself in. She felt the novel was a [...] "decathlon event" [...] in which Gary turned a [...] "household crisis into a full-scale allegory." [...] Overall, she praised the book as a [...] "memorable portrait of guilt and largess in black and white", noting she felt Gary had lived to [...] "witness his own maturity" [...] though <b>she</b> also <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> stretched the truth to [...] "make himself a legend in his own time." ...|$|R
