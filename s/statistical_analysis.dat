It develops, supports and markets a suite of analytics software also called SAS (<b>statistical</b> <b>analysis</b> system), which captures, stores, modifies, analyzes and presents data. The SAS system and SAS programming language are used {{by most of the}} Fortune 500. The SAS software includes a Base SAS component that performs analytical functions and more than 200 other modules that add graphics, spreadsheets or other features.

5|$|SAS Institute {{started as}} a project at North Carolina State University to create a <b>statistical</b> <b>analysis</b> system (hence the proper name, <b>Statistical</b> <b>Analysis</b> System) that was {{originally}} used primarily by agricultural departments at universities in the late 1960s. It became an independent, private business led by current CEO James Goodnight and three other project leaders from the university in 1976. SAS grew from $10 million in revenues in 1980 to $1.1 billion by 2000. A larger proportion of these revenues are spent {{on research and development}} than at most other software companies, at one point more than double the industry average.|$|E

Toward the end of his career, he played about 2,000 innings at third base and about 1,175 innings in the outfield, excelling at both.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s, Butinov and Knorozov had {{performed}} a <b>statistical</b> <b>analysis</b> of several rongorongo texts and {{had concluded that}} either {{the language of the}} texts was not Polynesian, or that it was written in a condensed telegraphic style, because it contained no glyphs comparable in frequency to Polynesian grammatical particles such as the Rapanui articles te and he or the preposition ki. These findings have since been used to argue that rongorongo is not a writing system at all, but mnemonic proto-writing. However, Butinov and Knorozov had used Barthel's preliminary encoding, which Konstantin Pozdniakov, senior researcher at the Museum of Anthropology and Ethnography of the Russian Academy of Sciences in Saint Petersburg (until 1996), noted was inappropriate for <b>statistical</b> <b>analysis.</b> The problem, as Butinov and Knorozov, and Barthel himself, had admitted, was that in many cases distinct numerical codes had been assigned to ligatures and allographs, as if these were independent glyphs. The result was that while Barthel's numerical transcription of a text enabled a basic discussion of its contents for the first time, it failed to capture its linguistic structure and actually interfered with inter-text comparison.|$|E

5|$|The {{results of}} <b>statistical</b> <b>analysis</b> will be {{strongly}} affected by any errors {{in identifying the}} inventory of glyphs, {{as well as by}} divergence from a purely syllabic representation, such as a glyph for reduplication.

40|$|Abstract — Due to {{increased}} variability trends in nanoscale integrated circuits, <b>statistical</b> circuit <b>analysis</b> and optimization has become essential. While <b>statistical</b> timing <b>analysis</b> {{has an important}} role to play in this process, it is equally important to develop die-specific delay prediction techniques using postsilicon measurements. We present a novel method for postsilicon delay analysis. We gather data from a small number of on-chip test structures, and combine this information with presilicon <b>statistical</b> timing <b>analysis</b> to obtain narrow, die-specific, timing probability density function (PDF). Experimental results show that for the benchmark suite being considered, taking all parameter variations into consideration, our approach can obtain a PDF whose standard deviation is 79. 0 % smaller, on average, than the <b>statistical</b> timing <b>analysis</b> result. The accuracy of the method defined by our metric is 99. 6 % compared to Monte-Carlo simulation. The approach is scalable to smaller test structure overheads and can still produce acceptable results.

40|$|Tyre cavity {{resonance}} was studied using {{a combination}} of deterministic <b>analysis</b> and <b>statistical</b> energy <b>analysis</b> where its deterministic part was implemented using the impedance compact mobility matrix method and its statistical part was done by the <b>statistical</b> energy <b>analysis</b> method. While the impedance compact mobility matrix method can offer a deterministic solution to the cavity pressure response and the compliant wall vibration velocity response in the low frequency range, the <b>statistical</b> energy <b>analysis</b> method can offer a statistical solution of the responses in the high frequency range. In the mid frequency range, a combination of the <b>statistical</b> energy <b>analysis</b> and deterministic analysis methods can identify system coupling characteristics. Both methods have been compared to those from commercial softwares in order to validate the results. The combined analysis result has been verified by the measurement result from a tyre-cavity physical model. The analysis method developed in this study can be applied to other similar toroidal shape structural-acoustic systems...|$|R
5|$|Although the {{fracturing}} {{process is}} not yet known, the altitudinal <b>statistical</b> <b>analysis</b> indicates that the caldera had formed just before the eruption. The area of the island was smaller, and the southern and eastern coastlines appeared regressed. During the eruption, the landscape was covered by the pumice sediments. In some places, the coastline vanished under thick tuff depositions. In others, recent coastlines were extended towards the sea. After the eruption, the geomorphology of the island was characterized by an intense erosional phase during which the pumice was progressively removed from the higher altitudes to the lower ones.|$|E
