5|$|Diverse life exists {{within the}} range, {{including}} endangered species like Larch Mountain Salamanders and spotted owls. Amphibians like salamanders and frogs are common, as are birds. Mammals {{in the area}} consist of elk, mountain lions, deer, and black bears. Eastern Cascades fish include Lost River <b>suckers</b> and short <b>suckers,</b> which are both endemic species.|$|E
5|$|Most {{fish species}} in Johnson Creek {{tolerate}} {{warm water and}} disturbed conditions. These include red-sided shiners, sculpin, <b>suckers,</b> and speckled dace.|$|E
5|$|The eight {{arms are}} thick, {{tapering}} {{to a narrow}} point. They are unequal in length, with arm pair I the shortest, followed by arm pair II and arm pair IV, and arm pair III the longest. All of them possess two rows of <b>suckers.</b> Each sucker has a diameter less than , decreasing distally, and a ring of 17 to 28 sharp acute teeth. The left arm of pair IV in males is modified into a sexual organ known as the hectocotylus. They bear long fleshy protrusions (papillae) with toothless <b>suckers</b> at the distal portion. The tentacles are thick and long, extending {{the length of the}} mantle when retracted. They are slightly compressed laterally. A prominent ridge (a keel) is present on the outer surface of each of the tentacle clubs (the wide tip of the tentacles). There are four rows of <b>suckers</b> on the manus (proximal part of the club) and the dactylus (distal part of the club). The larger <b>suckers</b> in the centre of the manus have 17 to 18 widely spaced teeth.|$|E
50|$|The Blue <b>Sucker</b> {{also goes}} by the name blackhorse, the bluefish, the muskellunge, the razor back, the sockerel, the gourd seed <b>sucker,</b> the Missouri <b>Sucker,</b> the slenderhead <b>sucker,</b> and the sweet <b>sucker.</b>|$|R
50|$|Other {{common names}} for the white <b>sucker</b> include bay fish, brook <b>sucker,</b> common <b>sucker,</b> and mullet. The white <b>sucker</b> is often {{confused}} with the longnose <b>sucker</b> (Catostomus catostomus), because they look very similar.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to Chinese high-fin banded shark, {{it is also}} known under many other common names, including Chinese banded shark, Chinese sailfin <b>sucker,</b> high-fin (also spelled hi-fin) banded loach, high-fin loach, Chinese high-fin <b>sucker,</b> sailfin <b>sucker,</b> topsail <b>sucker,</b> Asian <b>sucker,</b> Chinese <b>sucker,</b> wimple carp, wimple, freshwater batfish, Hilsa herring, rough fish, Chinese or Asian zebra high-fin shark, Chinese or Asian zebra high-fin <b>sucker,</b> Chinese emperor, Siamese <b>sucker,</b> Chinese banded shark, and Entsuyui in Japanese. Despite its common names, it bears no relation to real sharks except that they are both fish.|$|R
5|$|Boxelder, Fremont cottonwood, maple, and willow {{dominate}} riparian plant communities. Animals such as bank beavers, flannel-mouth <b>suckers,</b> gnatcatchers, dippers, canyon wrens, {{the virgin}} spinedace, and water striders all make {{their homes in}} the riparian zones.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fall}} of 2000, twelve species of fish were {{observed}} during electrofishing. They included eastern blacknose dace, northern hognosed <b>suckers,</b> shiners, smallmouth bass, and rock bass.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} {{surfaces of}} the arms are covered with circular, adhesive <b>suckers.</b> The <b>suckers</b> allow the octopus to anchor itself or to manipulate objects. Each sucker is usually circular and bowl-like and has two distinct parts: an outer shallow cavity called an infundibulum and a central hollow cavity called an acetabulum, {{both of which are}} thick muscles covered in a protective chitinous cuticle. When a sucker attaches to a surface, the orifice between the two structures is sealed. The infundibulum provides adhesion while the acetabulum remains free, and muscle contractions allow for attachment and detachment.|$|E
30|$|In {{contrast}} to steel <b>sucker</b> rod with relatively heavy weight, fiberglass <b>sucker</b> rod is much lighter. So it {{can reduce the}} polished rod load (Hicks 1986). Considering that fiberglass <b>sucker</b> rod cannot bear compressive stress, a length of steel <b>sucker</b> rod is needed {{to be connected to}} the bottom of the fiberglass <b>sucker</b> rod.|$|R
50|$|The Yaqui <b>sucker</b> (Catostomus bernardini) is {{a species}} of ray-finned fish in the Catostomidae family.It is found in Mexico and the United States. Catostomus bernardini or Yaqui <b>sucker</b> belongs to the family Catostomidae. The Yaqui <b>sucker</b> could {{possibly}} be a subspecies of the Gila <b>sucker,</b> and it is definitely a relative of the Sonora <b>sucker.</b>|$|R
30|$|Carbon fiber <b>sucker</b> rod {{and wire}} rope <b>sucker</b> rod are also {{lightweight}} <b>sucker</b> rod; however, their application is limited {{compared with the}} fiberglass <b>sucker</b> rod. So we chose fiberglass <b>sucker</b> rod as a representative technique to study. The research of wire rope <b>sucker</b> rod started in 1960 s. Some field tests showed that it could greatly reduce the polished rod load and energy consumption (Tan and Zhang 2005); however, it is rarely used in fields and seen in the studies nowadays. Carbon fiber <b>sucker</b> rod {{seems to be a}} potential technique to resolve some problems for deep-rod pumping, though it is not used as commonly as fiberglass <b>sucker</b> rod. Xinjiang oilfield in China has started to conduct the field test recently, and carbon fiber <b>sucker</b> rod shows good performance (Zhao et al. 2016).|$|R
5|$|These starfish are deep-sea {{dwelling}} {{and have}} particularly flexible arms. The inner dorso-lateral {{surfaces of the}} arms contain characteristic longitudinal muscle bands. In some species, the tube feet lack <b>suckers.</b>|$|E
5|$|Banksia aquilonia regenerates after bushfire by regrowing from epicormic buds {{under its}} bark. Regeneration from root <b>suckers</b> {{has also been}} recorded. Unlike many banksia species which release their seed after bushfires, Banksia aquilonia sets seed when the follicles mature.|$|E
5|$|Birds in the Buffalo Creek {{watershed}} include raptors, waterfowl, songbirds, {{and wild}} turkeys. Mammals in the watershed include rodents, foxes, raccoons, opossums, skunks, white-tailed deer, and black bears. The colder streams in the watershed contain brook trout and brown trout, while the warmer streams contain <b>suckers</b> and smallmouth bass.|$|E
5000|$|Three {{subspecies}} {{have been}} identified: the White River desert <b>sucker,</b> Catostomus clarkii intermedius (sometimes known as White River mountain <b>sucker,</b> Pantosteus intermedius), [...] Virgin River desert <b>sucker,</b> Catostomus clarkii utahensis, and the Meadow Valley Wash desert <b>sucker,</b> Catostomus clarkii (unnamed).|$|R
30|$|Development of {{fiberglass}} <b>sucker</b> rod {{for use in}} <b>sucker</b> rod pumping {{oil wells}} was started in 1973, based {{on the need for}} a <b>sucker</b> rod that could pump under highly corrosive and heavily loaded condition (Saul III and Detterick 1980). In contrast to standard steel <b>sucker</b> rod with relatively heavy weight, fiberglass <b>sucker</b> rod bodies are much lighter. That is because fiberglass has a low density. Thus, using fiberglass <b>sucker</b> rod can significantly reduce the gravity load acting on the polished rod.|$|R
40|$|In 2004, a {{population}} of dwarf longnose <b>sucker</b> was discovered co-existing with the normal form within the Elk River Watershed of south-eastern British Columbia. This thesis evaluated morphological, genetic and life history characteristics of this dwarf longnose <b>sucker</b> form {{to determine whether the}} dwarf morphotype warranted designation as an evolutionary significant unit and to determine any special habitat requirements. In addition to size, distinct morphological differences were indicated between Elk River Watershed dwarf and normal adult longnose <b>sucker,</b> with dwarf adults appearing to retain morphological features of juveniles and sharing morphological features with Salish <b>sucker,</b> which is a separate dwarf longnose <b>sucker</b> form that is considered endangered. Slight, but significant, genetic differences were indicated between Elk River Watershed dwarf and normal longnose <b>sucker</b> forms, and compared to Salish <b>sucker,</b> suggesting some basis for separate designation of the dwarf form. Dwarf longnose <b>sucker</b> are widespread in the Elk River Watershed, and most abundant in small, cool lentic water bodies that contained dense vegetative cover, potential oxycline fluctuation and/or limited fish species diversity. Dwarf adult longnose <b>sucker</b> showed some habitat preference differences compared to normal longnose <b>sucker,</b> with the findings suggesting that dwarf longnose <b>sucker</b> have adopted a more opportunistic life-history strategy than normal longnose <b>sucker.</b> It is postulated that an ontogenetic niche shift has allowed dwarf longnose <b>sucker</b> to more successfully exploit habitats experiencing periodic disturbances (e. g., hypoxia) that, in turn, has led to the occurrence of two longnose <b>sucker</b> morphotypes in the Elk River Watershed...|$|R
5|$|Members of {{this small}} group have either a single divided sucker or a row of <b>suckers</b> that cover the underside. They infest the guts of bony or {{cartilaginous}} fish and of turtles, and the body cavities of marine and freshwater bivalves and gastropods. Their eggs produce ciliated swimming larvae, and the life cycle has one or two hosts.|$|E
5|$|Most {{species in}} this order have five arms and {{two rows of}} tube feet with <b>suckers.</b> There are {{conspicuous}} marginal plates on the arms and disc. Some species have paxillae and in some, the main pedicellariae are clamp-like and recessed into the skeletal plates. This group includes the cushion stars, the leather star and the sea daisies.|$|E
5|$|Octopuses mainly {{move about}} by {{relatively}} slow crawling, with some {{swimming in a}} head-first position. Jet propulsion, or backwards swimming, is their fastest means of locomotion, followed by swimming and crawling. When in no hurry, they usually crawl on either solid or soft surfaces. Several arms are extended forwards, some of the <b>suckers</b> adhere to the substrate and the animal hauls itself forwards with its powerful arm muscles, while other arms may push rather than pull. As progress is made, other arms move ahead to repeat these actions and the original <b>suckers</b> detach. During crawling, the heart rate nearly doubles, and the animal requires ten or fifteen minutes to recover from relatively minor exercise.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sucker</b> Free, {{known as}} <b>Sucker</b> Free Daily on weekdays and then <b>Sucker</b> Free Countdown on Sundays, was MTV2's sole hip-hop video block. Previously, <b>Sucker</b> Free aired weekdays for one hour, then {{eventually}} sporadically until the week leading to February 28, 2010. <b>Sucker</b> Free Countdown, its 2-hour top 15 countdown, aired Sundays at 11AM ET/PT and 11PM ET/PT. <b>Sucker</b> Free originated from a block branding of hip-hop videos on MTV2 Sundays (called <b>Sucker</b> Free Sundays) in 2002, and eventually became the branding of MTV's main hip-hop program weekdays from 2006 until 2008. In October 2012, {{the show was}} re branded as The Week in Jams.|$|R

5|$|Seven {{species of}} fish inhabit Messers Run. These include a highly {{substantial}} population of brook trout. Upstream of the Lofty Reservoir, there are two {{species of fish}} inhabiting the stream: brook trout, eastern blacknose dace. The 1990 survey observed these two species as well as white <b>suckers</b> and pumpkinseeds. Three species of fish inhabit the stream between the Lofty Reservoir and the Blue Head Reservoir. These species are brook trout, brown trout, and blacknose dace. Six species of fish inhabit the stream below the Blue Head Reservoir: brook trout, blacknose dace, tessellated darters, brown trout, white <b>suckers,</b> and sculpins. However, only the first three species were observed during the 1990 survey of the stream.|$|E
5|$|Some nemerteans, such as L. longissimus, absorb {{organic food}} in {{solution}} through their skins, which {{may make the}} long, slim bodies an advantage. Suspension feeding is found only among the specialized symbiotic bdellonemerteans, which have a proboscis but no stylet, and use <b>suckers</b> to attach themselves to bivalves.|$|E
5|$|These parasites' name {{refers to}} the {{cavities}} in their holdfasts (Greek τρῆμα, hole), which resemble <b>suckers</b> and anchor them within their hosts. The skin of all species is a syncitium, a layer of cells that shares a single external membrane. Trematodes are divided into two groups, Digenea and Aspidogastrea (also known as Aspodibothrea).|$|E
50|$|A monostome is a worm {{with one}} <b>sucker</b> (oral). Flukes with an oral <b>sucker</b> and an {{acetabulum}} at the posterior {{end of the}} body are called Amphistomes. Distomes are flukes with an oral <b>sucker</b> and a ventral <b>sucker,</b> but the ventral <b>sucker</b> is somewhere other than posterior. These terms are common in older literature, when they were thought to reflect systematic relationships within the groups. They have fallen out of use in modern digenean taxonomy.|$|R

25|$|The most {{distinctive}} aspects of goby morphology are the fused pelvic fins that form a disc-shaped <b>sucker.</b> This <b>sucker</b> is functionally {{analogous to the}} dorsal fin <b>sucker</b> possessed by the remoras or the pelvic fin <b>sucker</b> of the lumpsuckers, but is anatomically distinct; these similarities {{are the product of}} convergent evolution. Gobies can often be seen using the <b>sucker</b> to adhere to rocks and corals, and in aquariums they will stick to glass walls of the tank, as well.|$|R
5|$|In 1997, brook trout, brown trout, {{and white}} <b>suckers</b> {{inhabited}} Scotch Run in its upper reaches. Two decades earlier, {{this part of}} the stream was also inhabited by pumpkinseeds and eastern blacknose dace, but not by brown trout. The reason for the disappearance of the blacknose dace is unknown. The pumpkinseeds were only present in the 1970s due to their escape from nearby farm ponds.|$|E
5|$|North American river otters, {{like most}} predators, prey upon the most readily {{accessible}} species. Fish is a favored food among the otters, {{but they also}} consume various amphibians (such as salamanders and frogs), freshwater clams, mussels, snails, small turtles and crayfish. The most common fish consumed are perch, <b>suckers,</b> and catfish. Instances of river otters eating small mammals, such as mice and squirrels, and occasionally birds have been reported as well.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species have}} other modes of feeding. Grimpoteuthis has a reduced or {{non-existent}} radula and swallows prey whole. In the deep-sea genus Stauroteuthis, {{some of the}} muscle cells that control the <b>suckers</b> in most species have been replaced with photophores which are believed to fool prey by directing them towards the mouth, making them {{one of the few}} bioluminescent octopuses.|$|E
30|$|However, {{relatively}} heavy, stiff steel <b>sucker</b> rod must be run on {{the bottom}} of the fiberglass <b>sucker</b> rod interval, because fiberglass <b>sucker</b> rod is weak when loaded in compression. If the fiberglass <b>sucker</b> rod is subjected to compression, the rod string body could be crushed beneath the wedges and a pullout failure could occur (Gibbs 1991).|$|R
30|$|Enzyme {{localization}} {{activities were}} surveyed using enzyme-histochemical techniques. The {{results showed that}} the ALPase and ACPase are highly active in the oral <b>sucker</b> in both Schistosoma species, while these enzymes are highly active in the oesophagus and testes of S. haematobium only and in the intestine of S. mansoni. ACPase is present in the ventral <b>sucker</b> in both Schistosoma species. In addition, ACPase activities are localized in most tested organs (oral <b>sucker,</b> oesophagus, ventral <b>sucker,</b> gynaecophoral canal edge, intestine, muscles, tegumental folds, testes and excretory pore) of S. haematobium. The enzyme activities of G- 6 -Pase are present in the oral <b>sucker</b> and ventral <b>sucker</b> in both Schistosoma species. The intestine, tubercles and tegumental folds contain this enzyme in S. mansoni only, but in contrast, S. haematobium contain this enzyme in the ventral <b>sucker</b> rim and gynaecophoral canal edge. 5 ′-Nu is widely distributed in the oral <b>sucker</b> and intestine in both Schistosoma species, whereas the same enzyme was present in most organs of S. haematobium. 5 ′-Nu showed a strong enzyme activity in the S. haematobium intestine and S. mansoni ventral <b>sucker.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The June <b>sucker</b> was federally {{listed as}} an {{endangered}} species in 1986. The lower 5 mi of the Provo River is the only known spawning location for the species.
