5|$|The <b>spelling</b> system, or orthography, of English is multi-layered, with {{elements}} of French, Latin, and Greek <b>spelling</b> {{on top of}} the native Germanic system. Further complications have arisen through sound changes with which the orthography has not kept pace. Compared to European languages for which official organisations have promoted <b>spelling</b> reforms, English has <b>spelling</b> that is a less consistent indicator of pronunciation and standard spellings of words that are more difficult to guess from knowing how a word is pronounced. There are also systematic <b>spelling</b> differences between British and American English. These situations have prompted proposals for <b>spelling</b> reform in English.|$|E

5|$|Though {{it might}} seem as if the Bible {{translation}} set a very powerful precedent for orthographic standards, <b>spelling</b> actually became more inconsistent during {{the remainder of the}} century. It was not until the 17th century that <b>spelling</b> began to be discussed, around the time when the first grammars were written. The <b>spelling</b> debate raged on until the early 19th century, and {{it was not until the}} latter half of the 19th century that the orthography reached generally acknowledged standards.|$|E

5|$|Akeelah Anderson, an 11-year-old <b>spelling</b> enthusiast, attends Crenshaw Middle School, a {{predominantly}} black school in South Los Angeles. She {{lives with her}} widowed mother Tanya, her older sister Kiana, her older brothers Devon and Terrence, and her infant niece. Her principal Mr. Welch suggests that she {{sign up for the}} Crenshaw Schoolwide <b>Spelling</b> Bee. She follows his advice and wins. Soon after, Dr. Joshua Larabee, a visiting English professor and Mr. Welch's friend from college, tests Akeelah and decides that she is good enough to compete in the National <b>Spelling</b> Bee. Nevertheless, Dr. Larabee declines to coach her because she is rude to him. As a result, Akeelah studies on her own to prepare for the district <b>spelling</b> bee. Although Akeelah misspells her word during the final round of the bee, she qualifies for the regional bee when Kiana catches the other finalist cheating. Akeelah also meets and befriends Javier Mendez, a 12-year-old Mexican American boy and fellow speller. Javier invites her to join the <b>spelling</b> club at his Woodland Hills middle school.|$|E

5|$|Following {{rumors of}} cast members from Beverly Hills, 90210 {{appearing}} on the spin-off, The CW confirmed that Shannen Doherty, Jennie Garth, Tori <b>Spelling</b> and Joe E. Tata would be returning in recurring roles as their original characters. Sachs was familiar with Garth, and talked to her about a possible role in the series. Garth agreed to star on the series without reading a script after brainstorming ideas with Sachs. The producers offered Garth a role as a series regular, but she opted to sign on as a recurring character. Doherty decided to appear after talking with Sachs, but her appearance {{was moved to the}} second episode. Sachs described Tata's casting as an accident; a friend told Sachs that he had seen Tata in a store, which led to the offer of a recurring role in the series. Sachs said that Tata was ecstatic about the idea and agreed. After reading the script, <b>Spelling</b> expressed interest in returning, and the writers decided to give her character her own fashion line. <b>Spelling</b> was scheduled to appear in the premiere, but due to personal reasons and the birth of her daughter, she opted to appear later in the season. On August 11, it was reported that <b>Spelling</b> had pulled out of the series after discovering that she was receiving less pay than Garth and Doherty. <b>Spelling</b> asked for her salary of $20,000 per episode to be increased to match their salaries—$40,000 to $50,000 per episode—but when denied she left the show altogether.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two types}} of magic <b>spells</b> in Might and Magic: Sorcerer <b>spells</b> and Clerical <b>spells.</b> Sorcerer <b>spells</b> are {{available}} to Sorcerer and Archer characters; Clerical <b>spells</b> are available to Cleric and Paladin characters. Daily spellcasting ability is limited by a character's <b>spell</b> points. For users of Sorcerer <b>spells,</b> the number of <b>spell</b> points available depends on that character's Intelligence statistic. For Clerical spellcasters, the number of <b>spell</b> points depends on the character's Personality statistic.|$|R
50|$|<b>Spells</b> are {{purchased}} {{in this stage}} as well, each <b>spell</b> is purchased as a separate skill. Several professions have a Professional Sphere of <b>spells,</b> and any character may purchase <b>spells</b> from the Universal Sphere. <b>Spells</b> are powered by Power Points, {{and in order to}} be able to cast a <b>spell,</b> a character must have a rank in that <b>spell</b> equal to the power points needed. <b>Spells</b> can be scaled upwardly, thereby increasing the required power points and skill ranks needed to cast the scaled version of the <b>spell.</b>|$|R

5|$|French naturalist Charles Alexandre Lesueur {{originally}} {{described the}} bluntnose stingray from specimens collected in Little Egg Harbor off the U.S. State of New Jersey. He published his account in an 1817 {{volume of the}} Journal of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, and named the new species Raja say in honor of Thomas Say, {{one of the founding}} members of the Academy. The species was moved to the genus Dasyatis by subsequent authors. In 1841, German biologists Johannes Peter Müller and Friedrich Gustav Jakob Henle erroneously gave the specific epithet as sayi in their Systematische Beschreibung der Plagiostomen, which thereafter became the typical <b>spelling</b> used in literature. Recently, there has been a push to use the correct original <b>spelling</b> again, though it has also been proposed that the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN) officially emend the <b>spelling</b> to sayi, for consistency with previous usage.|$|E
5|$|In July 1877, Young tried {{one more}} time at a <b>spelling</b> reform, {{ordering}} lead type designed for the orthography of Benn Pitman (Isaac's brother) {{with the intention of}} printing an edition of the Book of Mormon and Doctrine and Covenants using it. Most of the type had arrived by August, but with Young's death, the translation was never undertaken and the type never used. Young's death thus marked the end of the Mormon experimentation with English <b>spelling</b> reforms.|$|E
5|$|Lin Yutang's Chinese-English Dictionary of Modern Usage (1972) {{incorporated}} {{a number of}} innovative features, {{one of which was}} a simplified version of GR. Lin eliminated most of the <b>spelling</b> rules requiring substitution of vowels, as can be seen from his <b>spelling</b> Guoryuu Romatzyh, in which the regular -r is used for T2 and a doubled vowel for T3.|$|E
50|$|Runestaffs {{are special}} staffs that allow a spellcaster to {{substitute}} an uncast <b>spell</b> slot {{of the appropriate}} level for a <b>spell</b> on their <b>spell</b> list in the staff. This can be done up to three times per day per <b>spell,</b> depending on the staff. Spontaneous casters can use runestaffs to expand their known <b>spells,</b> while casters who prepare <b>spells</b> can access their more esoteric <b>spells</b> (which they can substitute for more generic <b>spells</b> in their runestaffs).|$|R

5000|$|Each wizard {{is given}} a random {{selection}} of <b>spells</b> {{at the start of}} the game with which to defeat the other wizards. <b>Spells</b> are either Lawful, Neutral, or Chaotic, and have a difficulty value expressed as a percentage chance of success when cast. A <b>spell</b> can only be cast once, with the exception of the [...] "Disbelieve" [...] <b>spell</b> which is always available to every wizard. New <b>spells</b> can only be acquired via the [...] "Magic Wood" [...] <b>spell.</b> During the game, the type of <b>spells</b> cast affects the subsequent difficulty of other <b>spells.</b> Casting many lawful <b>spells</b> results in a more lawful environment, which in turn makes other lawful <b>spells</b> easier to cast. The same principle applies to chaotic <b>spells.</b> <b>Spells</b> of the opposite alignment are not more difficult to cast however. Neutral <b>spells</b> are unaffected either way, and are always cast at the same difficulty percentage. This feature has a big impact on the strategy of the game, as a viable tactic is to cast lots of easy <b>spells</b> of a certain alignment, in order to make it easier to cast the more powerful <b>spells</b> of that alignment.|$|R
50|$|There are {{two types}} of skills in the game, Normal <b>spells</b> and Ultimate <b>Spells.</b> Normal <b>spells</b> cost 1 <b>spell</b> point to learn while {{ultimate}} costs 2.|$|R

50|$|Magic {{is divided}} into Mage and Priest <b>spell</b> types. <b>Spells</b> for attacking can be only be cast in Combat Mode. Some <b>spells,</b> such as Light <b>spells,</b> can be cast at any time. Other <b>spells</b> can only be cast {{outdoors}} or in town when not in Combat Mode. Players can create a character equipped with <b>spells</b> up to level 3, but higher level or certain <b>spells</b> must be purchased or found in special encounters.|$|R
50|$|<b>Spells</b> are {{distributed}} in three <b>spell</b> trees, namely Soul Magic, Blood Magic and Summoning. Soul Magic <b>spells</b> are primarily ranged <b>spells</b> like projectiles or walls of fire. Blood Magic refers to <b>spells</b> that primarily increase or cause close combat damage with the staff. <b>Spells</b> include common ones for poisoning, inflaming or freezing. Less common <b>spells</b> like leeching life or tossing the opponent backwards, {{who in turn}} will knock other opponents he collides with over, are also included. The Summoning tree features <b>spells</b> for summoning creatures that will fight on the players side.|$|R
50|$|Clerics {{differ from}} other spellcasters {{in that they}} can use an {{unprepared}} healing <b>spell</b> (or harming <b>spell,</b> for evil aligned clerics) in lieu of another <b>spell</b> of the same level. For example, Good-aligned clerics can transform a prepared (non-domain) <b>spell</b> into a healing <b>spell</b> of the same level (for example, a Chaotic Good cleric can transform Protection from Evil, a first level protective <b>spell,</b> into Cure Light Wounds, a first level healing one). Evil aligned clerics can perform a similar feat but convert prepared <b>spells</b> into Inflict <b>spells</b> that cause similar damage. Neutral clerics must choose one type of <b>spell</b> conversion or the other at first level, which is subsequently permanent.|$|R
5|$|Tonal <b>spelling,</b> Gwoyeu Romatzyh's most {{distinctive}} feature, was first suggested to Y.R. Chao by Lin Yutang. By 1922 Chao had already established the main principles of GR.|$|E
5|$|Variations {{are also}} found with the <b>spelling</b> of unit names in {{countries}} using the same language, including differences in American English and British <b>spelling.</b> For example, meter and liter {{are used in the}} United States whereas metre and litre are used in other English-speaking countries. In addition, the official US <b>spelling</b> for the rarely used SI prefix for ten is deka. In American English the term metric ton is the normal usage whereas in other varieties of English tonne is common. Gram is also sometimes spelled gramme in English-speaking countries other than the United States, though this older usage is declining.|$|E
5|$|Crocodilia and Crocodylia {{have been}} used interchangeably for decades {{starting}} with Schmidt's redescription of the group from the formerly defunct term Loricata. Schmidt used the older term Crocodilia, based on Owen's original name for the group. Shortly after, Wermuth opted for Crocodylia as the proper name for this redescribed group, basing it on the type genus Crocodylus (Laurenti, 1768). Dundee—in a revision of many reptilian and amphibian names—argued strongly for Crocodylia to be the <b>spelling</b> for the group. However, {{it was not until}} the advent of cladistics and phylogenetic nomenclature that a more solid justification for assuming one <b>spelling</b> over the other was proposed.|$|E
50|$|Priest's <b>Spell</b> Compendium Volume Three is {{the last}} volume in the series, and {{contains}} <b>spells</b> from spike growth to zone of truth. The book includes an introduction and brief definitions of the various <b>spell</b> schools. It also includes <b>Spell</b> Appendices which cover very powerful Quest <b>spells</b> to the far less powerful Orisons, and <b>spells</b> that deal with Psionic Enchantments (from 8th to 10th level) adapted from the Dark Sun setting (with rules on using such <b>spells,</b> {{as well as an}} extended cleric <b>spell</b> casting list). The <b>spells</b> from the Sphere of War, which tend to rely on the Battlesystem miniature rules, have been given their own section.|$|R
50|$|The Mana Pool may be {{purchased}} for 40,000 points; {{it allows the}} user to train wizards, which allow <b>spells</b> to be cast by selecting the desired <b>spell,</b> then selecting the enemy on whom one wishes to inflict the <b>spell.</b> The more wizards one has, the more <b>spells</b> can be cast. (the first <b>spell</b> is gained with 1 wizard, the second with 35, and the third with 100) The first <b>spell</b> is an instant kill <b>spell,</b> instantly killing an enemy. The second <b>spell</b> is an explosion that inflicts massive damage to all units within range. The third <b>spell</b> allows the player to instantly convert an enemy unit to their side.|$|R
50|$|The {{key element}} of the game are the Wizards. Wizards are very {{powerful}} at magic, but rather weak at close combat. Every player has one Wizard, each with a sphere of magic (Life, Death, Fire, Water, Air, Earth, Cosmos and finally Chaos/Secret), which decides which <b>spells</b> the Wizard can research. Some Wizards have multiple spheres, but can only learn less advanced <b>spells.</b> <b>Spells</b> range from passive <b>spells</b> (for instance, blessing a unit with additional strengths), to direct <b>spells</b> (i.e. healing <b>spells</b> or attack <b>spells),</b> to summoning <b>spells.</b> Wizards are the only units in the game who can't level up or gain medals. Instead, they improve by researching new <b>spells</b> and skills.|$|R
