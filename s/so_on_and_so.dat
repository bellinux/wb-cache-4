5000|$|Here is {{an example}} of {{definition}} by transfinite recursion on the ordinals (more will be given later): define function F by letting F(α) be the smallest ordinal not in the set , that is, the set consisting of all F(β) for β < α. This definition assumes the F(β) known in the very process of defining F; this apparent vicious circle is exactly what definition by transfinite recursion permits. In fact, F(0) makes sense since there is no ordinal β < 0, and the set [...] is empty. So F(0) is equal to 0 (the smallest ordinal of all). Now that F(0) is known, the definition applied to F(1) makes sense (it is the smallest ordinal not in the singleton set [...] = [...] ), <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>on</b> (the <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>on</b> is exactly transfinite induction).

40|$|Two {{important}} Ras {{guanine nucleotide}} exchange factors, Son of sevenless (<b>Sos)</b> <b>and</b> Ras guanine nucleotide releasing protein (RasGRP), have {{been implicated in}} controlling Ras activation when cell surface receptors are stimulated. To address the specificity or redundancy of these exchange factors, we have generated Sos 1 /Sos 2 double- or RasGRP 3 -deficient B cell lines and determined their ability to mediate Ras activation upon B cell receptor (BCR) stimulation. The BCR requires RasGRP 3; in contrast, epidermal growth factor receptor is dependent <b>on</b> <b>Sos</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Sos</b> 2. Furthermore, we show that BCR-induced recruitment of RasGRP 3 to the membrane and the subsequent Ras activation are significantly attenuated in phospholipase C-� 2 –deficient B cells. This defective Ras activation is suppressed by the expression of RasGRP 3 as a membrane-attached form, suggesting that phospholipase C-� 2 regulates RasGRP 3 localization and thereby Ras activation.
